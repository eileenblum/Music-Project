Nothing's free in this world, motherfucker
This life is not what you see on your screen
Your 5x3 reality
Before you double tap on what you wish you could be
Understand it might not be what you think
You want it so bad but you don’t know what it means
There’s no turning back once your in to deep
Can you handle it? Here’s the cold hearted truth
Only craving the money, the power, the fame will never satisfy you
This life is not just the views from the top
Because the higher your head gets, the faster you’ll drop
Can you handle it? Here’s the cold hearted truth
Only craving the money, the power, the fame will never satisfy you
Nothings free in this world, motherfucker
5x3 reality
You want it so bad but you don’t know what it means
There’s no turning back once your in to deep
Can you handle it? Here’s the cold hearted truth
Only craving the money, the power, the fame will never satisfy you
Can you handle it? Here’s the cold hearted truth
Only craving the money, the power, the fame will never satisfy you
