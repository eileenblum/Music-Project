If the Lions want war we got fight until the battle ends
If tigers come we will fight and battle
If the tigers come running we got fight them to the bloody end
If tigers come we will fight and battle
When the elephants come they got bow to my brethren
If elephants come we’ll fight in rage
Lock 'em in a cage parade them to the lion’s den
If human come we’ll fight and obliterate
If lion’s come we’ll fight until the end
If tiger’s come we’ll fight and battle
If elephants come we’ll fight in a rage
If humans come we’ll fight and obliterate
I breathe fire like a dragon killing demons
Am I go hard 
Yeah we gonna seize the day
Hellfire rain  it down upon my people
If ya gonna bring the evil we could bury it today
We all been lost we all been called
Everyone rise to a brethren code
We got your back we all been low
Let’s all rise to the brethren code
We all been lost we all been called
Everyone rise to a brethren code
We got your back we all been low
Let’s all rise to the brethren code
If you come with evil intentions we’ll give you a fight
Ten of us will strike you as thunder
Hundred of us will shatter your hearts
Thousand of us will destroy and obliterate
Ten thousand of us will hand you the wrath of heaven
If you come as a flood we’ll fight until death
If you come swarming we’ll scatter around
If you come flying we’ll shoot you down with our archery
If you come charging we’ll slice you with our swords
We all been lost we all been called
Everyone rise to a brethren code
We got your back we all been low
Let’s all rise to the brethren code
Let’s cut through them as the fly of falcons
Let’s burn within as the hearts of wolves
Let’s stampede with our horses
Let’s defeat them with the wisdom of our great Knaan Chinggis
We all been lost we all been called
Everyone rise to a brethren code
We got your back we all been low
Let’s all rise to the brethren code
Let’s all rise to the brethren code
Let’s all rise
