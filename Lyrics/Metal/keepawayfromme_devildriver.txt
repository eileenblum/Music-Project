So sick of all the sorrow
Put down all my dreams 'til tomorrow
Watched you slowly slip away
While I try to live my life without you
Let these thoughts and words rip out the sutures
Let this light burn my way, into the future

Whatever you do
Just do it away from me
Whoever you want to be
Just be it away from me
Wherever you go
Just go there away from me
Whoever you are now
Just stay clear away from me

These shackles that hold us all here
This burden so heavy it's not clear
Look into your eyes, it's just a vacant stare
Looking back I can tell you never cared

Whatever you do
Just do it away from me
Whoever you want to be
Just be it away from me
Wherever you go
Just go there away from me
Whoever you are now
Just stay clear away from me

The reluctant and broken road
Beaten down and bruised
Deaf, dumb and blind
From all the endless abuse

Whatever you do
Just do it away from me
Whoever you want to be
Just be it away from me
Wherever you go
Just go there away from me
Whoever you are now
Just stay clear away
Just stay clear away from me
