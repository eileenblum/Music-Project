For a moment I can wait
It's a fight I guess I'll never know
For a moment I can wait
I'm holding onto hope
And I know you're stoned, I can see it
The struggle's getting old
For a moment I can wait
'Cause you said you're sober
Lying and I can't get closer
Tell me, should I let you go?
Tell me, should I let you go?
'Cause you said you're sober
Lying and I can't get closer
Tell me, should I let you go?
Tell me, should I let you go?
Every moment I'm awake
It's a fight that you could never know
Every moment I'm awake
I'm clinging onto hope
And I feel so low, but I'm dealing
The struggle's getting old
Every moment I'm awake
But I'm getting sober
Trying but I can't get closer
Baby, did you let me go?
Baby, did you let me go?
Now I'm getting sober
Trying but I can't get closer
Baby, did you let me go?
Baby, did you let me go?
On and on we pray
Thinking 'bout time and our mistakes
Thinking 'bout time, thinking 'bout time
'Cause it's about time
On and on we pray
Thinking 'bout time and our mistakes
Thinking 'bout time, thinking 'bout time
'Cause it's about time
So don't say it's over
Waiting here while you get sober
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
So don't say it's over
Waiting here while you get sober
I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
On and on we pray
Thinking 'bout time and our mistakes
Thinking 'bout time, thinking 'bout time
'Cause it's about time
On and on we pray
Thinking 'bout time and our mistakes
Thinking 'bout time, thinking 'bout time
It's about time
