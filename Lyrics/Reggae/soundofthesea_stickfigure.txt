This boat is sinking, down to the ocean floor
We're still drinking, drinking from the night before
I'm wishing, I'm wishing right now I was fishing
I'm thinking, I'm thinking but my mind's not listening
I never felt so far away
I never lived before today
It's been a while, since I've seen your face
It's been a while, time to turn the page
I wanna go home, I wanna go home
I wanna feel the way I did
I wanna go home, I wanna go home
Back, back to the way it was
I got a feeling, and this feeling won't go away
I'm not leaving, I'm waiting for a brighter day
I'm not leaving, and good things are coming my way
So keep dreaming, I'm feeling like I'm dreaming always
It never felt so strange to me
And my guitar is all I need
It's been a while, since I've been down this road
And it's been a while, and good things come and go
If the sun is getting closer
Then why does it feel so cold
And in the eyes of the world I'm older
And I can't sing it much longer
I wanna go home, I wanna go home
I wanna feel the way I did
I wanna go home, I wanna go home
Back, back to the way it was
I'm just a little bit longer
The music making it stronger
I'm just a little bit longer
My music making it stronger
I'm just a little bit longer
My music making it stronger
I'm just a little bit longer
In the eyes of the world
