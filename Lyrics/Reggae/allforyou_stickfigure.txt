As long as I can remember
So long ago
It feels like time is forever
When you're on your own
I didn't know I was lost
But now our paths have crossed
These eyes have fallen
I do it all, I do it all for you
I do it all, I do it all for you
This beating heart's been sleeping
The stars are always awake
Wake me up I'm still dreaming
And show me the way
I didn't know what to believe
Now it's clear as can be
For here I am I've been calling
I do it all, I do it all for you
I do it all, I do it all for you
All for you
All for you
All for you
I do it all, I do it all for you
