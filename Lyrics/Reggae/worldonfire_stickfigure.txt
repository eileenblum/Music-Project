If I had all the money in the world
I'd probably burn it all
If I had all the riches in the world
I'd surely burn it all

One in a million, money gonna kill a man
Why must we lose control?
Blaze up a fire storm, the people getting higher from
The smoke of another man's gold

Who set the world on fire?
Who set the world on fire?
Who set the world on fire?
It was me, I set the world on fire

If I could rule the world
You know I'd love you all
If a smile could save the world
You know I'd heal you all

Burn like a wildfire, lighting up the night sky
Love is not never enough
Maybe in another life, I'll see them on the other side
The people them all singing about love

Who set the world on fire?
Who set the world on fire?
Who set the world on fire?
It was me, I set the world on fire

Who wants control over everything?
If money steals your soul then only trouble it will bring
Loving as a whole, only thing that conquers we
So let it be told, let the world them sing

Who got a light? you put them light up to them herbs
We can smoke and get more higher when your mind it gets disturbed
We can set the world on fire and then watch as it all burns
Or light it up and pass it, smoking all be taking turns
Don't ever need no money, don't need silver don't need gold
Only thing them ever wanted is some herbs that they can hold
If the only thing you loves the kind of green that you can fold
We can set it all on fire, let the fire fill your soul

Who set the world on fire?
Who set the world on fire?
Who set the world on fire?
It was me, I set the world on fire
