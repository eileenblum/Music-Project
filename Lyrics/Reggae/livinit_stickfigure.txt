Whoa, yeah yeah, whoa whoa
I feel the love coming over you
It gets inside your head, then you know
And then then you know
I feel the power coming over you
It gets inside your head, then you know
And then then you know
Peaking around the corner and I know nobody's watching
I can see I'm all alone, I'm all alone, I'm all alone
I'm working on the night shift, smoke a little cigarette
A marijuana cigarette, I've got my girl on the phone, I'm all alone
I turn on the radio, I'm listening to the night show
They're playing my favorite song so I turn it up, and I sing along
I look at my watch, I'm almost off, it's almost three fifteen
I can't believe what a wonderful night it has turned out to be
I've been livin' it up, and livin' it out, it's the way I live my life
Sit back and relax and love and make yourself feel right
Livin' it, oh livin' it, oh livin' it, mhmm
I get home real late
I see no one's awoken
And I know I'm all alone, it's all I know, it's all I know
My girl is asleep, dreaming her dreams, and smiling at me
So happy I'm home, it's all I know
I walk in to my studio, step up to the microphone
And start to write this song, I just let it out, the words just come along
I got thoughts in my head, my baby's in bed, and music is there for me
I just want to write what a beautiful night it has turned out to be
I've been living it up, and living it out, it's the way I live my life
Sit back and relax and love and make yourself feel right
Every time I hear your voice, it puts a smile upon my face
I've got to carry on, got to get back to that place
And every time I hear that song, it brings a feeling deep inside
I never had no choice, you are the one that I was supposed to find
Oh oh, oh oh
