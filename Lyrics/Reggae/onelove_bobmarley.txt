One love
One heart
Let's get together and feel alright
(hear the children crying)
One love (hear the children crying)
One heart (sayin')
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright (sayin')
Let's get together and feel alright
(whoa whoa whoa whoa)
Let them all pass, all their dirty remarks (one love)
There is one question I'd really love to ask (one heart)
Is there a place for the hopeless sinners
Who has hurt all mankind just to save his own (believe)
One love (what about one heart)
One heart (what about love)
Let's get together and feel alright (as it was in the beginning)
One love (so shall it be in the end)
One heart (alright)
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
(one more thing)
Let's get together to fight this Holy Armageddon (one love)
So when the Man come, there will be no no doom (one song)
Have pity on those whose chances grows thinner
There ain't no hiding place from the Father of creation (sayin')
One love (what about one heart)
One heart (what about love)
Let's get together and feel alright (I'm pleading to mankind)
One love (what about one heart)
One heart (oh oh)
Give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright
Let's get together and feel alright
(give thanks and praise to the Lord and I will feel alright)
