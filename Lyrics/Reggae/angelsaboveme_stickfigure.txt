Run run river, carry me home to the ocean
The river and the road, take me home to the ocean
The friends in my life, like stars in the sky, leave the lights on
I'm trying to get back home, the river keeps on flowing to the ocean
The angels above me they sing that they love me, oh Lord
I'm traveling alone
So far from home and love
Oh no, angels, angels please don't leave
I'm trying to get to her with the love she deserves, Lord please
I've been playing my guitar laying underneath the stars for you
In the light of the moon I'll be forever singing tunes for you
When the stars are aligned
Like the colors in your eyes, greens and blues
It's not when or whether, we'll always be together, it's true
And the angels above me they sing that they love me, oh Lord
I'm traveling alone
So far from home and love
Oh no, angels, angels please don't leave
I'm trying to get to her with the love she deserves, Lord please
And sometimes I feel like my heart's gonna burst at the seams
And sometimes I think it's just love that we want, or we need
And sometimes I feel like I'm living too much in my dreams
And sometimes, oh Lord, let me be
Let me be oh
Are you feeling like I'm feeling?
Searching for the meaning of it all
I spend all my days trying to make some sense of it all
The ocean and the seas and the windblown trees are changing
And your love for me, is all I need to keep believing
And the angels above me they sing that they love me, oh Lord
I'm traveling alone
So far from home and love
Oh no, angels, angels please don't leave
I'm trying to get to her with the love she deserves, Lord please
Oh please
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
