I've been around long enough to know
I've heard the story told
I've seen this life unfold
I heard a sound, a voice I don't recall
A stranger I don't know
My back against the wall
I'm done running away
I'm coming, I will escape
Take me away
This place is never the same
Never the same
This is once in a lifetime
I've been running in circles
I've been chasing the sun
I guess I'm looking for something
But I just don't know what
Everything has a purpose
Everyone has their doubts
Why's it feel so uncertain
Why you running around?
It ain't easy, leave it up to me
A perfect place to be
A perfect place to be
I'm done running away
I'm coming, I will escape
Take me away
This place is never the same
Never the same
This is once in a lifetime
Something's happening, this feeling's setting in
I refuse to give in, hold on, hold on
There's a vibe in the air, when the truth comes clear
You can find it here, hold on, hold on
I'm done running away
I'm coming, I will escape
Take me away
This place is never the same
Never the same
This is once in a lifetime
Yeah but I'm done running away
It's something I can't explain
Ready for change
You know that I can't stay
It's never the same
This is once in a lifetime
