It seems this world is not for me
When the cold wind blows and I hear the scratching of the leaves as they rustle
They say it’s not easy
So evident in the city
Man I just can’t used to the hustle and bustle

The stars wait for me in the night sky
I hear them sing their siren song
And I don’t have to ask why
I don’t feel that I belong
Cause I tried to run and I tried to hide
But I cannot control what I feel inside
Don’t feel human or even animalian
God damn, I must be an alien

It seems that earth is not for me
When the snow falls down
And I hear the silence of the night wrap around me
They say it don’t come cheap
But I would give anything to get back to the place where my mom must have found me

The stars wait for me in the night sky
I hear them sing their siren song
And I don’t have to ask why
I don’t feel that I belong
Cause I tried to run and I tried to hide
But I cannot control what I feel inside
Don’t feel human or even animalian
God damn, I must be an alien
