Why do the best people leave too soon
Why do the rest of us feel this gloom
Why is there pain in my chest every single time I think of you
What do you do when you have no words
And every day seems to be a blur
Think you’re okay 
you’re not too sure you’re not too sure
And you’re thoughts aren’t pure but 
Now that you’re gone I can move on
Move on
Now that you’re free
I can rest easy
How do you heal from a wound so deep
How do you rest when you just can’t sleep
Don’t wanna cry Still you weep Still you weep
You didn’t get to say goodbye
Cherish the days when we were so young
Thinking back on the songs we sung
Feel the warmth of the midday sun
Wish that you could feel it too
Now that you’re gone I can move on
Move on
Now that you’re free I can rest easy
You know I hate to see you hurting from the pain
Wishing that my love and strength could take it all away
I know that you’re tired
Go on and lay your head right next to the father
He’s gone prepared your bed
And if your got a single pass down from heaven 
Would you come and spend it with your sister and your bredren
Know that we miss you Loving you is hard
Sending butterfly kisses from the earth unto the lord
And its safe to say 
Now that you’re gone I can move on
Now that you’re free I can rest easy
