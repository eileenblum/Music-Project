Medication
Your medication makes me high
Just be patient
I'm like a patient trying to find
Levitation
Run your fingers down my spine
Elevation
Your medication makes me high
Hey
Such a short way up and such a long way down
Chalice it a bubble like we deh ya right down
The way you somethin' nuff it haffi weigh five pound
Inna fields of marijuana that is my playground
I love you, Mary J
You're the prettiest of flowers
Girl, me can't complain
When I'm with you, I feel so high, I rise above the rain
And you no do people damage, like that bitch cocaine, no
And if them lonely, feeling only pain
'Cause, your DNA is of the highest strain
Your effect is so potent, it's so insane
You so gummy and sticky like a plasticine
When me grind out your body, only stems remain
And to love you is so risky, I might get detained
You always keep me flying on the highest plane
And anybody know, will always proclaim

Your medication makes me high

Hey
Your leaves of green, your purples and blue
A short little kids, adore women too
And I say to myself, what a wonderful herb
And I say to myself, what a wonderful herb
Look how Babylon so duppy, dem fight you fi years
Fi your love whole heap a man serve years
Babylon so duppy, dem fight you fi years
And now the whole a dem a buy shares
You should be a celebrity, amongst any tree
Across the seven seas, for your energy
But you're an enemy, catching felonies
Of the remedies in your recipes, whoa

Hey
Ask me how you feel, splendid indeed
With a likkle bit a black splendid weed
Her parents grow indoors, not a stick nor seed
And she never force-ripe, it was a real slow speed
No fertilizer, natural baby feet
No cross pollination, she's a real pure breed
Cultivated in love and she's not grown for greed
She's everything I want and also all I need
