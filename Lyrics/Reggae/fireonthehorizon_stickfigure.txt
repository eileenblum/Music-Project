There's a little old town and it's tucked away on an island on the sea
So far away from everything, where time it don't mean a thing
And time moves slow and certainly we got no place to be
Where's there's love there is life, there is a hope and a dream
This is the place for you and me
We can go, we can stay
We can hide, we can run away
We can feel, and swim in the ocean
We've fallen, life keeps calling
I found love in the strangest places, where all is meant to be
Jamming to the sounds favorite song, I said good love is all we need
And when you get down, turn it up loud, and soon we'll feel at peace
When the world does you wrong, you listen to that song, like the birds listen to the trees
There's a fire on the horizon
There's a fire, so let it burn
We can get higher over the mountain
We've fallen, life keeps calling
In this jungle, we are all just animals
We're criminals, but we're innocent always
In this jungle, we are all just animals
We're criminals, but we're innocent always
So many miles I've walked
So many rivers I've crossed
So many battles I've lost,
Make me who I am today
And when tomorrow it comes,
There'll be a brand new sun
This song is not over,
It's just begun
There's a fire on the horizon
There's a fire, so let it burn
We can get higher over the mountain
We've fallen, life keeps calling
