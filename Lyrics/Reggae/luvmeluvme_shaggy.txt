Naw (Mr. Lover), sugar
Sweet, succulent and fine
A twinkling eye on my darling divine
I love the way you move and all the way you're designed
Your only lines are my mind, forget that corny line
Now let me hit you off with this question sign
You seem to be the type for me to wine and dine
A little candlelight dinner toasted over some wine
Well, I will hot you off now with this lyrical rhyme
Now Mr. Lover keep her rockin',
Mr. Lover keep her rockin'
Mr. Lover keep her rockin' and swing
Now Mr. Lover keep her rockin',
Mr. Lover keep her rockin'
Mr. Lover keep her rockin' and swing,
Sing out
Oh, boy, I love you so
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go

Once I get my hands on you
(Luv me, luv me, luv me, sex machine)
Ooh, boy, I love you so
(Mmm, hmm)
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go
(That's right, uh)
Once I get my hands on you
(You know what)
Step in my caravan of love
So I can love, gonna give you hotter rubs
Dem ever wet kisses with dem brazen hugs
And now your sweet silky body on my Persian rug
While we be sippin' Coke from the same ol' mug
I'm readin' fortune cookie from the Chinese proverb
It said some great ? it with some cool rub-a-dub
A little old reminisce in the hot tub, huh
Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover
(Let's fog up some window sills, girl, uh)
Mr. Lover
(Catch a groove back, girl, catch a groove),
Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover
Ooh, boy, I love you so
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go

Once I get my hands on you

Ooh, boy, I love you so

Never, ever, ever gonna let you go
(Tell 'em, tell 'em)
Once I get my hands on you

Girlie, girlie, you woke on a real love machine
Girlie, girlie, I live to make your beat

Girlie, girlie, woo, I'll hit you between the sheets
Girlie, girlie, girl, you love to moan and scream
Girlie, girlie, you know what I'm sayin' (Yeah), shuh
Girl, you're unique
Now let me take a whiffle for that sweet physique
Your the only girl allowed to make my heart stop beat
Let me, ? let's kickin' heartlessly
To be the lady of your colour is an honour indeed
Leave a lastin' impression for weeks and weeks
I want to throw rose petals to your humble feet
Lay you gently on my sheet and sex-ercise you to sleep,
Huh
Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover
(Uh, yeah)
Mr. Lover
(Catch a groove back, girl, catch a groove),
Mr. Lover, Mr. Lover

Ooh, boy, I love you so
(Yeah, yeah)
Never, ever, ever gonna let you go

Once I get my hands on you

If you come wit me, you me can retire
Anytime you model, girl, a instant fire
Somehow you're power with Tommy Hilfiger
Nuff dat designer wan know your name

Want to feel your body man can't put no fame
Some model, oh mi girl, and go enjoy your fame

Get moist for the sound of the baritone voice
