In the afternoon when the sun is strong
I try to close my eyes and get lost in thought
I got a company, I got a lot of men
I try my best to share and take care of them, well
But it's never enough
Oh it's never enough
But it's never enough
I got a brand new car, got the perfect house
And when I get home my kids laugh and shout
How can I still want more, how and I feel this way?
Human nature takes over me, and it goes like this
But it's never enough
Oh it's never enough
But it's never enough, yeah
When I find some time, not enough to do
I might buy that house down in Malibu
How can I still want more, how can I feel this way?
Human nature takes over me, and it goes like this
But it's never enough
Oh it's never enough
But it's never enough, yeah
Rare guitars and fancy cabernet
I guess the grass is always greener
At least that's what they say
Oh it's never enough
It's never enough
Oh it's never enough
It's never enough
