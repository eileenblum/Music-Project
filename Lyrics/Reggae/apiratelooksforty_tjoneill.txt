Mother Mother Ocean
I have heard your call
Wanted to sail upon your waters since I was three feet tall
You’ve seen it all you’ve seen it all
Mother Mother Ocean
I have heard your call
Wanted topsail upon your waters since I was three feet tall
You’ve seen it all you’ve seen it all
Watched the men who rode you
Switch from sails to steam
And in your belly you hold the treasures few have ever seen
Most of em dreams most of em dreams
Yes I am a pirate
A few hundred years too late
The cannons don’t thunder there’s nothing to plunder
I’m an over forty victim of fate
Arriving too late arriving too late
Well I’ve done a bit of smugling
And I’ve run my share of grass
I made enough money to buy Miami but I pissed it away so fast
It’s not meant to last it’s not meant to last
Well I have been drunk now for over two weeks
I’ve passed out and I’ve rallied and I’ve spring a few
Leaks but I gotta stop wishing I’ve gotta go fishing
Down at rock bottom again
With just a few friends just a few friends
