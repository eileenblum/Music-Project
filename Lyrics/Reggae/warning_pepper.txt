I know your face but I don't know your name
I'm outta place but I don't know who to blame
So I, took a trip and now I'm stepping out over the border
Now I feel so cold in a really warm place
There's a million lights in a very tight space
She always wondered how the Milky Way would taste
Cause we're still here waiting
But the sun he's still hiding
This is a warning, we've got to get down to this place
This is a warning, we're calling from miles away
This is a warning, we've got to get down to this place
This is a warning, we're calling from miles away
I see the pieces but I don't know where they go
And I'm running fast but I've never moved so slow
High in the desert but I'm rolling in the snow
Now I feel so warm in a really cold place
A million lights in a very tight space
She's looking up and she's waiting on the big bang
Cause we're still here waiting
But the sun he's still hiding
This is a warning, we've got to get down to this place
This is a warning, we're calling from miles away
This is a warning, we've got to get down to this place
This is a warning, we're calling from miles away
Well I've been holding on to everything you saying
Your words and your melodies to the music that you're playing
I try to live my life each and every day
Making the most of every moment and the rest will go away
You know we always still got work to do
And all the reasons in the world are bringing me back to you
And I would like to leave you all with this feeling
Said if you want love, you give love that's all you really need
This is a warning
This is a warning
