Take me to the ocean
Take me to the sea
Wash away my worries
Let my soul be free
Take me to the ocean
Take me to the sea
Wash away my worries
Let my soul be free
Wash away my worries
Let my soul be...
What now is coming around
You're feeling cut down into the ground
And so we all come together
We're making a sound, we sing
Look at all this love we've found
Gotta raise 'em up, toast to the sweet life
If it's wrong I don't wanna be right
See the sun giving me the green light
Kick back, relax, and soak up the sweet sights
Take me to the ocean
Take me to the sea
Wash away my worries
Let my soul be free
Take me to the ocean
Take me to the sea
Wash away my worries
Let my soul be free
There's something in the air
Yeah come and take away my cares
I close my eyes
And remember these dreams that we shared
I wash it all away
You gotta give us all a break
Let the troubles of tomorrow
Wait till another day
Take me to the ocean
Take me to the sea
Wash away my worries
Let my soul be free
Take me to the ocean
Take me to the sea
Wash away my worries
Let my soul be free
When life's moving too fast
We can make this dream last
Just let the past be the past
Take me to the ocean
Take me to the sea
Wash away my worries
Let my soul be free
Take me to the ocean
Take me to the sea
Wash away my worries
Let my soul be free
(Let my soul be free yeah)
