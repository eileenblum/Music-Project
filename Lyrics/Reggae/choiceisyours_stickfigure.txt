Your mind's long gone, and you're run down, you're all out of smoke
Light me up a cigarette, before I go
Your whole world fits inside of the palm of your hands
I try to tell 'em man, but they just don't understand
The choice is yours, when your ready
The choice is yours, oh oh
The choice is yours, taking it easy
The choice is yours, the choice is yours
Your arms wide open, the walls are caving in
Don't bury your secrets deep within your skin
When you focus on the good things, all things under the sun
You free yourself from negativity and then the good shall come
The choice is yours, when your ready
The choice is yours, oh oh
The choice is yours, taking it easy
The choice is yours, the choice is yours
The choice is yours and the choice and mine
You can't please everybody all of the time
Can hope and pray things will be just fine
But might not know 'til the end of the line
Happiness is only a state of mind
Open your eyes and in time you will find
Open up your heart and let your love light shine
And it don't cost a penny, nickel, or dime
Give a little love and get a little ain't the way that it goes
What goes around it comes around and everyone knows
What you give is what you get
So take a look 'cause it shows
Pickin' up your brother any time he feelin' low
Smokin' up a chalice or a spliff of pacalo
Rollin' up the best with nothin' less than hydro
When I'm smokin' on my spliff don't burn it fast, I like it slow
Movin' up in a style and in a fashion I'm supposed
Open a another door any time another door is closed
Move into the light from in the dark now exposed
When I'm reachin' into sky and spread it out to let it grow
Never do a thing because somebody's sayin' so
The choice is yours, way-o, yours
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
The choice is yours
The choice is yours, when your ready
The choice is yours, oh oh
The choice is yours, take it easy
The choice is yours, the choice is yours
