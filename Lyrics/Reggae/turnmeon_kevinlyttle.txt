Oh yeah
Is ah big dancehall song in know
Madzart alongside Kevin Little
You know how it is,
You Know how we go
You know
For the longest while we jamming in the Party
And you wining in on me
Pushing everything up
Right back on top of me
But if you think you're gonna get away from me
You better change your mind
You're going home
You're going home with me tonight
Let me hold you
Girl caress my body
You got me going crazy
You turn me on

Girl wine all around me
You got me going crazy
You Turn me on

If she think madd man nah go fight

Now she whar come fly way like kite
One hand on the ground and
Bumper cock sky high
Wining hard on me
Got my Python
Hollerin' for mercy, yeah
Then I whisper in her ear
So wine harder
And then she said to me
Boy just push that thing
Push it harder back on me
So, let me hold you
Girl caress my body

For the longest while we jamming in the Party
And you're wining on me
Pushing everything up
Right back on top of me
But if you think you're gonna get away from me
You better change your mind
