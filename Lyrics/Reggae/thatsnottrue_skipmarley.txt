Now greetings to the world
Voice of the one called Skip Marley
Alongside the lion in the jungle
Big Gongzilla, the youngest son
I know you drunk in power brother that's not juice
I see you chasing mils my brother that's not food
When the banana peels, I tell you that's not fruit
Another brother shot down, but that's not news
Don't you fall from grace
Brother don't throw it all away
A wise man used to say
Money ain't life so take it easy
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
You're lying with the liars, baby that's not you
The way you're never smiling, baby that's not cute
I see he got you crying, baby that's not smooth
The chaos and the violence, baby that's not cool
Don't you fall from grace (No way)
My love don't give your heart away (No way)
A wise man used to say
If she's amazing she won't be easy
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Better you build a bridge than instead of you build a wall
Better to love and lost than to never have loved at all
Better to do today than instead of you putting it off
Tomorrow not sure and that is for sure so better you give it you all
Better you stand up and better you get up and rise whenever you fall
Better you smile instead of you cry and even better you laugh
Embarrassment better than gas pain me friend so better you fart
Anything better than hungry, wisdom better than smart
Better them go, but that one let them talk 'cause I bet when you check it them soft
All of them bad and a buck like bull, but I bet when you check he's a calf
Real is better than fraud
Freedom better than bought
Gold is better than bronze
Bronze is better than brass, but
Health is better than wealth, and
Peace is better than war
Now is better than later
The present is better than past
Prevention better than cure, and
Long life better than fast
Question better than answer
Better you answer, this tell me yours
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
Tell me that's not true
