We're grooving
Alright, we're moving
Woah oh, yeah ay
Woah oh oh oh
We're grooving
Nothing like roots reggae music
Now turn it up, I wanna lose it
Nothing like roots reggae music, oh oh
We're grooving
Nothing like roots reggae music
Now turn it up, I wanna lose it
Nothing like roots reggae music
Higher self-meditation
The music brings upon me
Mixed with the healing of the nation
Well, now that's all I need
'Cause it's the perfect combination
We're moving at our own speed
We're talking higher concentration
So keep it moving with me
Yeah let me tell you now
We're grooving
Nothing like roots reggae music
Now turn it up, I wanna lose it
Nothing like roots reggae music, oh oh
We're grooving
Nothing like roots reggae music
Now turn it up, I wanna lose it
Nothing like roots reggae music, yeah ay
We're grooving
Feel the vibes of the music, it's alright
Woah oh
'Cause when the music hold, ears filled all night
Yeah ay
You wanna jump, you wanna shout, you wanna skank
You wanna shout it all about
I'll let the whole world know
The music has got you, oh oh
We wanna move, we wanna groove
We wanna move, we wanna play it non-stop
We wanna move, we wanna groove
We wanna move, we wanna play it non-stop
Because you can't stop this feeling
You can't stop this groove
Can't stop this music
You can't kill this mood
Music in the message
The message in the music
Never leave sight, in the right time
It'll give light, well let me tell you now
We're grooving
Nothing like roots reggae music
Now turn it up, I wanna lose it
Nothing like roots reggae music, oh oh
We're grooving
Nothing like roots reggae music

Nothing like roots reggae music
Oh oh, oh oh
Woah oh, woah oh

Grooving
We're grooving
