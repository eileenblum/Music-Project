Minal z wiatrem czas
Odwracanych Krzyzy
Poznikaly z placow grozne
Szostki trzy
Nowa przyszla moda
Teraz rzadza pentagramy
Kazdy chce miec wizerunek
Glowy Kozla

Nie drecz diablow
Nie drecz demonow
One nie chca straszyc
Nie drecz diablow
Nie drecz demonow
One chca odpoczac

Spieszysz sie do piekla
Tam juz miejsca brak
Do czego dazysz
Czlowieku puknij sie w glowe

[English translation:]

[Three Little Sixes]

Time with wind has passed
Of inverse crucifixes
Menacing six six six
Disappeared from backs
New fashion has come
Pentagrams govern now
Everybody wants to have a portrait
Of Goat's head

Don't oppress devils
Don't oppress demons
They don't want to haunt
Don't oppress devils
Don't oppress demons
They want to rest

You hurry to Hell
There is no place for you
What for are you going there
Hey, guy, knock in your head

Don't oppress devils
Don't oppress demons
They don't want to haunt
Don't oppress devils
Don't oppress demons
They want to rest
