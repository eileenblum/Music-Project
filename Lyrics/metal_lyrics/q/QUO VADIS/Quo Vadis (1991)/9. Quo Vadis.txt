Zajrzales do swiadomosci swej
Wtargnales na sciezki mysli
Dokad idziesz ?
Dokad gnasz ?

Dotarles do granic mozgu
Dotarles tam - co ujrzales ?

Po co idziesz ?
Dokad gnasz ?

Dlaczego nie chciales mi wierzyc
Dlaczego nie chciales mnie sluchac
Tak trudno jest ludziom umierac
Jak trudno bylo Ci zyc

[English translation:]

[Quo Vadis]

You have looked inside your head
You have invided to idea's paths
Where - do you go?
Where - do you chase?
You have reached to the end of brain
You have reached there - what do you see?
What for - do you go?
Where - do you run?
Why didn't you want to trust me
Why didn't you want to hear me
It's hard to die to people
As it's hard to live to you

You didn't want to belive in love
And you made the last step
Where - do you go?
Where - do you run?
