One belief that gave rise to a nation
Etched in our history
A future carved in stone

Foundation of what was
Yet to come to light
A people reduced to slaves
Never given the right to say

I believe
I believe you can never take that away
I believe I cannot lie blind
To fight for a right to be
I will give my life
Believe

With dove amongst a murder of crows
A martyr in disguise wearing a robe of gold

Outstretched arm hides
Cracked smile lies
Pleasant words try
But no one can deny that

I believe
I believe you can never take that away
I believe I cannot lie blind
To fight for a right to be
I will give my life
Believe

Beneath the star, the battle lines are drawn tonight
A child runs for cove, holds his mother tight
To take a life comes too easily
How can one live when you must die for your beliefs

Can't control myself
I see something else
Gotta control myself
Take me away

Gotta speak my mind
Too many walking blind
Gonna have to speak my mind
I believe
