Here I stand

On the shores of abandomnent,
Waves quietly at my feet.

All I see is venom!
Venom is all I see
Surrounding me!

Venom!

Oddly it sooths (me),
Quiets my needs
New answers rush at me.

With hateful vengeance,
I throw my soul away,
Conclusions might as well
Be carved out in stone,
(In a) flash of clarity
From exiled sanity-
My mute witness and detested consort
With singularity of my purpose

It quiets my mind!!!
Sinful ecstasy feeds my skin!!!!
As I throw my soul away!!!
Twisted logic of foul play.

Here I stand of sound body and foul mind
Composing my manifesto of silence.
A twisted requiem by the mute for the deaf.
A lunatics symphony of absonance
Discordant cadences of a chaotic mind.

It quiets my mind!
Sinful ecstasy feeds my skin!!!!
As I throw my soul away!
Twisted logic of foul play.

I threaten the universe with murder and rape
In hope of obtaining some sort of reaction.
Lucidity purged
(By) fever (thick with) hate, chaos, deceit and other peoples pain

Here I stand throwing fists at the sky
Ready to claw back
What is rightfully mine
Amidst the ignorance of the sillborn world about me.
