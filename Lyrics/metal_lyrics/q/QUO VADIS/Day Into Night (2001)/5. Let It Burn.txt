So many things are hidden
A question that has no rhyme
Walking in a circle
Too many things we can't define

Wandering thoughts
Wonder what thet must mean
Mind finds no peace
The whole keeps going, can't be seen

We try to find our way out
There's no escape from a mixed up life
We keep trying to push on
Just gotta let it burn

Let it burn
We gotta keep trying to push on
Let it burn

Existence lined
With diligence it should make sense
So simple it cannot be
So empty it ends up dead

Choking
Seething
We suffocate ourselves in shame
Running from our dreams

We try to find our way out
There's no escape from a mixed up life
We keep trying to push on
Just gotta let it burn

You feel that there's no way out
That there's no refuge for you
You feel that there's no way out
That there's no end in sight

To win you've got to shine
Taste the life inside
No holding back

Past regrets can't breath
If not allowed to seize
A lifetime full of promise

Exquisite painting hides
Mistakes and first drawn lines
The colors that have run
The canvas that has turn dry

Never do
Never cry
These are the words of those
Who never had the guts to try

We try to find our way out
There's no escape from a mixed up life
We keep trying to push on
Just gotta let it burn

Let it burn
We gotta keep trying to push on
Let it burn

Time has a way of forgetting
All the times we took wrong turns
No need to keep on reliving
Ready to burn

Take a chance

Just gotta keep pushing on
No need to keep on reliving
Gotta let it burn
