Think you've got the control?
A string of words I've heard before
Tread the path, walk the line
You let yourself believe the lies
Your whole life is just an empty shell
Abandoned soul, angel from hell

Eyes fixed on you
I see your thoughts pierce the darkness
Words flow from your soul
Bring to life the lifeless
No image can replace, the dark fall from your grace
Dreams last as long as it takes to remember
They always fade

When all is said and done
You'll see that there's still only one
Pain you caused, hate you filled
There's not much left of you so called will
So now you look, and now you find the truth in a cesspool of lies

Wake up
You're in disorder
Wake up
You've got nothing to give

Eyes fixed on you
I see your thoughts pierce the darkness
Words flow from the wounds
Bring to life the lifeless
No image can replace, the dark fall from your grace
Dreams last as long as it takes to remember
They always fade
