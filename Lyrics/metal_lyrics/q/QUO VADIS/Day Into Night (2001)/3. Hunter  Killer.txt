On the twilight of life, the sky shed tears
Knowing too well of what lay ahead
Fate revealed

Pale shadows danced as the night caught fire
No turning back, one glance ahead
What was void now turns to red

Responsiblity discarded
A snake always sheds it's skin
Push away the pain we cause
Live to sin, we are

Hunter/killer
Blinded by our hate, deafened to cries
Hunter/killer
Only one has the right to survive
Hunter/killer

Faith in conviction of lies
When all that's left is a sigh
Then we'll wonder why no one asked why

A truth that cuts deeper than the lies that bind
Souls hardwired to serve one god
Backbone made of fear tranlates to lack of control

Responsiblity discarded
A snake always sheds it's skin
Push away the pain we cause
Live to sin, we are

Hunter/killer
Blinded by our hate, deafened to cries
Hunter/killer
Only one has the right to survive
Hunter/killer

Faith in conviction of lies
When all that's left is a sigh
Then we'll wonder why no one asked why

Torn apart who can we look to for answers?
One more loss will bring is closer to the edge
Unwritten chapter, a final tale
Are we the only one's who cannot comprehend?

Can't you see we've only just begun
No second chance, there's only one
No turning back, what's done is done

Look into the eyes of madmen
Pools of blackness lie beyond
Drowning the soul, drowning cries

Ties that blind, lineage that's last so long
Must be overcome before
Time is revoked, curtains fall
