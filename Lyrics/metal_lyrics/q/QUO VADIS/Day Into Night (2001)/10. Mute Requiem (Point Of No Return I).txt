Over there lies the body,
Of false hopes and unfulfilled desires.
It inspires only loathing

Silence, irony
Becomes it's only testimony,
Contrary to the envisioned outcome and the desired result

Pity, this final outcry for sympathy
Committed with such self-indulgent finality, is doomed to failure.
So pathetic, unreversable and blind...

Irony and contempt
For the failed life
Seems fitting of this Mute Requiem...

Emptiness cries out my name!
Emptiness cries out my name
In vain

As i turn my back and walk away
Maggots
Assemble
To begin their song.
