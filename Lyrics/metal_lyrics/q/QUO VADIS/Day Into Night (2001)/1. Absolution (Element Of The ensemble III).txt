As I am following your footprints in the dead of night
The fog is thickening the air and as the rain falls down
I feel your presence nearby and as I search the grounds
I see you trembling with fear lying on the ground

I walk up to you, look into your eyes
I see pain and sorrow and that you will never rise
Regretting all events that you have lived 'till this day
There's no turning back, nothing you could do nor say

The understanding of certain decisions
May sometimes be difficult
A fear which could last all eternity
I enter your mind, see the world from your eyes

I reach out, touch your soul: I close my eyes to feel
The rumbling pain that runs within you, which now cannot be healed
Our minds are correlated in space of tranformed state
Your body levitates by my hand, I read your thoughts at infinite rate.

The understanding of certain decisions
May sometimes be difficult
A fear which could last all eternity
I enter your mind, see the world from your eyes

You seek forgiveness from God and people surrounding
You've just realized the pain and sorrow you have given
Love was something you were getting, never giving
Now your soul is forever scarred and weakened

Soon, you will understand the time has come today
For you to learn from your mistakes, for you to learn the ways
Willing to see through the heart, beauty and brightness of the mind
Knowing how to use the sight, the ability to find.

The understanding of certain decisions
May sometimes be difficult
A fear which could last all eternity
I enter your mind, see the world from your eyes

Chemical sorting and pair creation
Intervention takes place, memory to ashes
The mind reborn, you seek your true purpose
It lies within you...
I feel peace within as your soul meets a new world
A world where you may step up to a higher learning
Take my hand and walk down the path of forgiveness
