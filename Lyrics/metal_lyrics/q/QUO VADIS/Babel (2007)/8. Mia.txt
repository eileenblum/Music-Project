I know you bitch, Your name is Mia
Where are you now ? I want your touch
You little bitch Take a look at the mirror
Queen of the night You've stolen my heart

You look so pretty Come closer Mia
Let's do it now I'll pay you twice
There's your move I see your butt at the mirror
The paradise Changed into hell
