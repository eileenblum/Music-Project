Chaos, time of need political prophecy,
Pions adultery, New gods come to life
Suffering for you and I, contradictious, Heresy!
Competing faiths collide, politicians supervise
Love, hate intertwined

Condemnation, intolerance is their unifying point
Condemnation, intolerance is their unifying point
Shedding their tears at the hostile crowds!
Choose to avoid, choose to ignore...
Gods must weep!

New philosophies arise, exhibiting intolerance,
With religious intensity.
Once ideals are outlined, belief systems are defined
Faith organized!!! Pions hate in the name of god
Noble hate in the name of good
Pions noble hate: opium of the masses!

Condemnation, intolerance is they unifying point
Condemnation, intolerance is they unifying point
Shedding their tears at the hostile crowds!
Choose to avoid, choose to ignore...
Gods must weep!
