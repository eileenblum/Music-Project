I just can't take it anymore
Knees and hands bolted to the floor
The smoke is coming down on me
Will I just suffocate or be?

The room now empty as I see
Locked doors, no windows, dark to be
Lightning and thunder I do feel
As my worst nightmare becomes real

And now that I've been left alone
I get my chance enter the zone
In which my deepest thoughts occur
And where I speak in silent words

Wonder what will become of me
Will I just suffocate or be

Help me!

Wonder what will become of me
Will I just suffocate or be?

Silence spreads, I hear my gasp for air
My heart beats fats with seconds few to spare
I feel the pain, eyes strongly shut together
I stand up now and then I feel the power

Wonder what will become of me
Will I just suffocate or be

Help me!

A sheet of paper lies in front of me, blank
Emotions trapped inside, infinite rank
Cannot seem to extrovert the feel
Imprisonment of days turns into years
