In the darkness of the night
I stop and wonder if my existence
Has changed the world in any way

Have I been noticed
Or am I just another, whose flesh and blood,
Presence on Earth
Is only for the sake of another soul
Drifting away with time.

In the darkness of the night
I stop and wonder if my existence
Has altered the world in any way.
