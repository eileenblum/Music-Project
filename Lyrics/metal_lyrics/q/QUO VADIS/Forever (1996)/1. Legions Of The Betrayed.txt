In the ruins of my mind
I curse your name with hatred
I cast you down, throttled
With a burden of a thousand sins.
As you drown in lakes of my tears
Sentenced to inhale my misery
I reject!!!

Condemned, broken,
Your mangled body beaten to a pulp
Unmoved my blows of hatred
Your trusting eyes remain fixed on mine
As you fade, I charge you with my crimes!
I betray!

I can not comprehend
The logic behind your sacrifice
As you caress me with your broken hands
I break them again,
Spitting venom into your tired eyes

Contorded from my vile hate
You remain unfallen

Condemned, broken,
Your mangled body beaten to a pulp
Unmoved my blows of hatred
Your trusting eyes remain fixed on mine
As you fade, I charge you with my crimes!
I betray!

To the chorus of a thousand moans
Traitors
Leading the legions of the betrayed
