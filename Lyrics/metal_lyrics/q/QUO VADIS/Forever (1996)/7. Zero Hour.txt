A lost age of forgotten dreams
Reflections in a broken mirror
Hiding the images of hway might have been
Time stands still as the glass water shatters
Beneath the strain of humanity's dying voice

No hope, no fear, no choice
Lost hope, one fear, last chance
Welcome to zero hour

The gods look on, desperate to comprehend
The moment it all failed
Their tears fall to the earth
Polluted with humanity's sins
And they close their eyes
Their children have lost their way.

No hope, no fear, no choice
Lost hope, one fear, last chance
Welcome to zero hour

Time begins anew, the gods awaken
&gt;From their sleep
And with it a new dream
Like the Phoenix we are reborn from the
Ashes of the past
The choice is ours, a new dawn, a new hope,
A new age
As we begin at zero hour.
