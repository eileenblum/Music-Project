Silence,
Filled to the brim with unspoken words
Menacing,
Burning,
Unspeakable...

Kiss of fire soothe me!!!

I smile for the last time
To the universe behind your eyes
Letting The Final Minute slither towards us
As it lifts it's ugly head,
Judging with it's icy gaze,
Ready,
Imminent,
Unstoppable...

I taste your lips letting you go,
Perhaps for the last time.
Smiling silently, forcing my tears inward
I turn around and walk away.
My heart frozen motionless in a chocke-hold
Like the streets around me,
Barren and cold.
Just before you disappear behind the corner
I hide beneath the earth.
