Mystery of the endless time
Neverending ringing bells
Coming back and passing by
Mystery of the endless space
We all live in the tension
Damaged souls - damaged hearts
Heroes of the creation
Slowly we fall apart

Black horizon - it's amazing view to me
Black horizon - there I must go - leave me be

The earth craves for love
Follow the sun
Many deaths, it survived
Now it's gone
Temple of information
Turned to temple of doom
Heroes of the creation
The nuclear fuel

Black horizon - there I must go - where i'll die
Black horizon - there I go to the darkest side
Black horizon - it's amazing view to me
Black horizon - there I must go - leave me be
