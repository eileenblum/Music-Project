They help by tanks
They release by air raids
They feed by guns
They heal by bombs
They talk by tortures
They build by shells
They teach by soldiers
They convert by grenades

Blood for oil
Oil for blood

They help by barrels
They release by planes
They love by shots
They peace by battleships
They repair by repressions
They reward by guns
They apologize by prisons
They thank by graves
