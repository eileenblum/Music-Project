With every single blinkin'
With every thought I'm thinkin'
With every toil I'm coming through

I feel I can get higher
By power of desire
Which I can only owe to you

With every passing hour
by unstopable fire
Which purifies my nasty soul

I feel I am immortal
i feel I'll never fall down
if you will let me stay by you

You... make me stronger
Make me colder
Deep inside
You... make me filthy
make me quilty
Make me blind

I'm hypnotized
By charm of your eyes
But I've found the lies
Hidden beetwen the lines

We need to stop
We have to live on

By morning resurection
With superior direction
Avoid your chilly empty eyes

I'm like the faded colour
I'm like the wilted flower
But I know I am happy now
