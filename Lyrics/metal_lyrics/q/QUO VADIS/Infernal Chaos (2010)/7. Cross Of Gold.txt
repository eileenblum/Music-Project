On our shoulders cross of gold
Everywhere we see a flash of gold
A golden nail stabs our heart
Make a bow before golden god

Put golden bridle on your neck
The golden vice will squeeze your brain
Who only keeps gold in his heart
On cross of gold will end his path

On cross of gold is hanging
Greedy hell
At the gallows of gold's standing
Executioner

On our shoulders cross of gold
Everywhere we see a flash of gold
A golden nail stabs our heart
Make a bow before golden god
