Deep to the bottom of the glass - I go
With each and every draught I fall - I know
She's screaming I'm dreaming
About my perfect world
She doesn't see it but I do

Dreams, dreams, dreams
Of my drunken mind
I should thought about my life
When I started the ride

The alcohol goes around into - my veins
I drink the spirit and I feel - the flame
She's sleeping I'm creeping
I don't know where I am
I've lost my way - I've lost my aim

Dreams...

One shot, one more, I kill myself... hahahaha

My body's shaking and I cannot - see
The world has, turned into the place - of fear
She's craying I'm dying
She's screaming full of tears
I reached the point of no return

Dreams...
