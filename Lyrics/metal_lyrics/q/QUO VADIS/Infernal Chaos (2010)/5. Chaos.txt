My name is chaos, chaos
I can't bear peace in my life
And when nothing is going on
My comments are close to the bone
I don't like when I know
What i'll meet behind the corner
I don't like when I know
Who will be the new day's owner

And I don't like when the days are the same

I destroy silence
I destroy peace
I destroy violence
I destroy rules

Walls, squares, lines
Hours, days, years
These things are invented
Man establishes them
But chaos will distort all
Will pull down and will dime
The chaos likes to rule
The chaos loves chaos

I am a man
I am a fool
When there's peace I'll make war
I am a man
I am a fool
When there's peace I'll start a fight
