In my little body
You're still looking for
Ohhh am your daughter
Dead and without soul

In dirty prison
Alone with my shame
I can't find a reason
Father - you're to blame

I'm lost with my pain
Hey hey dad
Hey hey dad
Hey hey dad
I hate you

Now around my body
Sun is shining bright
You're in prison now
Bye - father - bye

You'll suffer all the time...

Hey hey dad
Hey hey dad
Hey hey dad
I hate you

Hey hey dad
Hey hey dad
Hey hey dad
I hate you

No more lies and no more lies and no more lies and evil dad
