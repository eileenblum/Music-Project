At the edge of the world tangled fate
Of miserable man
Was to be love but tyrant instead
Wants only bloodshed
Two is enough for fight to begin
Hate untill death
Through centuries the ulcer grew
Of misunderstanding

Million miles and million years
We stand million stars away

A man found a foe in another man
From the top of the mountains to the deepest grave
Everything parts
Like fire and water like life and death
Mental poles
Like drought and flood like black and white
We are so different

Million...

Once holy crusade once holy dzihad
Sheds blood
This is our destiny this is our fate
This is our history

Million...
