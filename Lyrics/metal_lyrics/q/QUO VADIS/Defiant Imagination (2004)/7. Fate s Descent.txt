[Lyrics: Bercier, Music: Frydrychowicz]

My body rests in a dark chamber
As I am receiving final farewells
A saddened silence fills the air
The smell of flowers, the smell of death

The latch is opened, my skin reflects the light
A short prayer is recited in my honour
Some take a step forward, their stares descend
Looks of deception, looks of despair

Some are faceless, some are caught in the moment

Communication at light speed occurs
faster than words can be expressed
One-way telepathy provides the living souls
a sense of presence when left alone

A mental sketch is tattooed on their minds
time to say their "adieux" arrives
My vessel sealed, a cold breeze strikes the world beyond
I am imprisioned from the world of light

Some induce tears, hostage to emotion

Looking from above, I can feel their pain
... I will guide
Purity resists, faith will overcome
... I survive
They forgive my sins, I can feel the peace
... Of my life
Looking through their souls

Timeless sense of loss, overtaking thee
... I will guide
With a mere remorse, they will call to me
... I survive
Tell the secrets of an unforgotten past
... Of my life
Looking through my soul...

Voiceless.. but present...

Some can feel it, some ignore the forces

As I descend into the depths of goodbyes

[solo: Seghers]

The raining earth is bestowed upon my being
As I watch over and comfort thee

[solo: Frydrychowicz]

A last prayer in unison begins

[solo: Frydrychowicz]

Forever lasting, words do not die
Priceless balance

"You feel I have abandoned you, but it is you who left me behind"

[*music written in honour of Chuck Schuldiner*]
