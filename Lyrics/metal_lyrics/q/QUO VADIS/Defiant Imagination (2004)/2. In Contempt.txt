[Lyrics &amp; Music: Frydrychowicz]

Committing to sound
what words will not express
What lies can not divert
and rip into shreds

Living snapshots of events,
A violent maze of lies
like silence standing still

A testimony of accusations
carving out a frozen landscape
filled with twisted form
of faceless cowards and frozen faces...
Cowards and frozen faces

The arrogant and hollow crumble
beneath the boots of truth
Like shadows standing still

A testimony of accusations
carving out a frozen landscape
filled with twisted forms
of faceless cowards and frozen faces...
Cowards and frozen faces

A crumbling image, an empty shell
lies of which sustain
like statues standing

[Solo: Frydrychowicz]
[Solo: Seghers]

Committing to sound
what words will not express
What lies can not divert
and rip into shreds

Arguments ablaze!
the stress turns the minds alive!
Alive!
