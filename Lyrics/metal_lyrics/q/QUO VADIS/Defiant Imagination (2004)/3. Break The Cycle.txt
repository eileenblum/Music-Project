[Lyrics &amp; music: Frydrychowicz]

[Solos: Frydrychowicz]

The road to hell is paved
with good intentions
Dreams can only sustain for so long
turning away with apprehension
life passes you by as you
trip over another lost cause...

Life goes on...

Open your eyes, break the cycle
Open your eyes, alone in the crowd (of unscrupulous minds)
Open your eyes, break the cycle
Open your eyes, open your mind

Hours turn into days of endless struggle
on the road to nowhere
What was once clear, now a distant shadow
why effort alone is not enough
to stop the tide from washing you away...

Life goes on...

The acrid smell of deceit
the fuel that transforms notions into sound
Absorbed and fused, minds confused
into catalytic tone...
Condemns and decries the mistakes
and the lies, and the pain

[Solo: Seghers]
[Solo: Frydrychowicz]
[Solo: Seghers]

The road to hell is paved with good intentions,
dreams can only sustain for so long
Open your eyes,
and break away from your restraints
Let the blind guide your path no more
break free from your past.

Open your eyes, break the cycle
Open your eyes, alone in the crowd (of unscrupulous minds)
Open your eyes, break the cycle
Open your eyes, open your mind

Hours turn into days of endless struggle
on the road to nowhere
What was once clear, now a distant shadow
why effort alone is not enough
to stop the tide from washing you away...

Life goes on
to the road to hell
to rest, after life in pain
