[Lyrics: Bercier, Music: Frydrychowicz]

[Present:]

I feel the fear reveal its core
A darkened past caused by inner war
The years have come and gone and i see
the Inner Capsule still haunting me

The future must hold a brighter end
I must prevail, I must descend
The intervention run from within
to annihilate my future sins

The stars above are shining down
The crying voices, i hear their sound
I feel a journey come to an end
The faces revealed, I make amends

Like a dark-world warrior who sees the light of day
fights inner demons to control the right of way

A new journey is about to begin
... as the Ensemble calls for me
Many dreams to be fulfilled
... as the Ensemble calls for me
The years to come will bring new life
... as the Ensemble calls for me
Their purpose lies within the stars
... as the Ensemble calls for me

Element, the Element, the Element surfacing
a challenge of mental strength overtakes the mind

As I seek for the quantum leap
The elements plan their retreat
I see a pattern begin to form
in the dead of night, my soul reborn
With hopes that a sense of purpose and love
will descend upon me from the eyes above

Like a dark-world warrior who sees the light of day
fights inner demons to control the right of way

A new journey is about to begin
... as the Ensemble calls for me
Many dreams to be fulfilled
... as the Ensemble calls for me
The years to come will bring new life
... as the Ensemble calls for me
Their purpose lies within the stars
... as the Ensemble calls for me

[Past:]

Wonder if i'll be among the troops who'd risk their lives
Defend the sash of honour, fight for truth, have them rise
To form a coalition, have the enemy turn to dust
Will combat solve the conflict?
Which side will I grow to trust?

Which side will I grow to trust?
Which side will I grow to trust?

[Present:]

Like a dark-world warrior who sees the light of day
fights inner demons to control the right of way
Like a warlord spreading the word: Increase in power
With eyes wide open, the spirit craves to conquer

A new journey is about to begin
... as the Ensemble calls for me
Many dreams to be fulfilled
... as the Ensemble calls for me
The years to come will bring new life
... as the Ensemble calls for me
Their purpose lies within the stars
... as the Ensemble calls for me

Element, the Element, the Element vanishing
a challenge of mental strength overtakes the mind
