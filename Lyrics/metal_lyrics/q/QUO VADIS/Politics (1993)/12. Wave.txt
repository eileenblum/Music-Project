From time to time
Such a day returns
Not knowiing from here
Indecision appears

Sad moments hard time
Sad moments hard time

Through grey streets
Melancholy passed by
Through grey doors
Nostalgy come through

Sad moments hard time
Sad moments hard time

A wave of memories comes
And awakens anger
Brings with itself glommy pictures
Not always of nice days

Sad moments hard time
Sad moments hard time

Old wounds bleed again
Old wounds fresh pain

Endure time of these mean days
Earthing feelings
Don't let the wave carry you
As it come it will go away
