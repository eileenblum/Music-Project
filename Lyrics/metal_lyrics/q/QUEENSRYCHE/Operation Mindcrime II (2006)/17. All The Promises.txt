[Lyrics by Geoff Tate]

Is there some other way out of here?
Somewhere I could find myself?
Can't sleep enough, can't stay high.
All the promises... just another lie.

I've always been afraid except...
In the moments that I loved you.
The only time I felt strong
Was when you stood next to me.
I could make a stand if...
I could hold your hand again...

The road I've traveled is the hard way down,
Always playing another man's fool.
They offered a way inside
With the promise of forgiveness. It's a lie.
Could you forgive what I've done?

We had it all, but couldn't see anything.
The blind leading the blind
Through the darkest night.

When you said you loved me
It made me feel alive.
When you said you loved me it made me feel...
Like I could fly.

I've always lived afraid except...
In the moments that I loved you.
The only time I felt strong was when you stood next to me.
I could make a stand if...
I could hold your hand again.

We had it all, but couldn't see anything.
The blind leading the blind
Through the darkest of nights.
When you said you loved me it made me feel alive.

When you said you loved me
It made me feel... like I could fly.

I've always been afraid except in the moments that I loved you.
