[Lyrics by Geoff Tate]

Wonder where'd the time go?
There it was, gone in the blink of an eye.
See how much life is left staring back in my face?
But I know it now as clear as, clear as a window.

Never thought this day would come,
I never thought I'd see.
Half my life is gone.
Thought I'd never live to see...
Never thought this day would come...
I never thought I'd see half my life is gone
Thought I'd never live to be... much of anything.

Everything moves faster now.
We're living at the speed of light.
I stand here fascinated,
Watching as it all goes by.
Maybe I should live what's left... like it was my last.

Never thought this day would come...
I never thought I'd see half my life is gone.
I'd never live to see...
Never thought this day would come...
I never thought I'd see half my life is gone
I'd never live to be... much of anything.
Everything moves faster now.

Where are you now?
Feeling small.
Can't live without it?
You call this your best?
I made my life a mess.
And everyone but you sees it.
What a fool.
What are you gonna do,
Make more excuses?
"Don't worry,
I'll kill the bastard!"
