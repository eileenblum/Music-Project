[Lyrics by Geoff Tate]

I gotta have it,
Gotta drink the high life.
I'll buy a new suit, black skinny necktie.
I'll mingle with elite and imitate
And they'll never even get it 'til I hit 'em.

I've got no fear 'cause I've weathered the breakdown,
San Quentin to the edge of the Big Town.
I'm a man of the people,
In the home of the brave, and I'm no man's slave.

Because I'm free,
I deserve everything I can get.
I'm American.
I'm American.

If you voted for the man you're wasting time.
He's got his fingers dipped in everyone's pie.
The news can't wait to promote
All the bullshit this government is selling.

I've got this plan in motion, countdown.
Assassinate, terminate, smack down.
There's a war in my head and it needs to be said.
If they think they can take me they're dead.

Because I'm free,
I deserve everything I can get.
And I'll get everything I can get.
I'm American.
I'm American.

What do you believe in?
What are you living for?
Do you want what they're selling you,
Another television war?

I can't stop! I feel I gotta have more!
That's right, more!
I want more!
More!

Because I'm free,
I deserve everything I can get.
I'm American.
I'm American.

Because I'm free,
And I'll get everything I can get.
I'm American.
I'm American.

Are you free?
You deserve everything you can get.
I'm American.
I'm American.

Yeah I'm free,
I deserve everything I can get.
I'm American.
I'm American.
