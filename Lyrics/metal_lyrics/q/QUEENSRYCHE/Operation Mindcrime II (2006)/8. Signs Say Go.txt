[Lyrics by Geoff Tate]

Imagine if you will, what it means...
This worthless life.
Tried my best to the scratch the surface
Got bloody broken fingernails.

Convincing stories of achievement, lies.
All expectations smashed,
Never could comply.
Generations come and go.
And what will I be,
The failure they see here?

Now, I can't remember!
All the signs say go!
Would I surrender?
To try to save your soul?
I can't remember!
All the signs say go!
I'll never surrender!
Time for heads to roll!

Do you think I've got to have one good reason?
The question stands,
How does he keep getting into my head?

I know I'll never see.
I've got to get free.
No matter what's said,
I'd rather see him dead!

You might be wondering why...
I can't take any more?
I can't take any more.
I'll tear him down! I'm gonna tear him down!

I've been called so many things
Now what do you see?
A failure dares to dream?

Now, I can't remember!
All the signs say go!
Would I surrender?
To try to save your soul?
I can't remember!
All the signs say go!
I'll never surrender!
I can't remember!
All the signs say go!
Would I surrender?
To try to save your soul?
I can't remember!
All the signs say... go!

Convince me, mesmerize me
Feed me more lies.
I'll get stronger!
How do you get him out, out of your head?
I know I'll never see.
I've got to get free.
No matter what's said,
I swear I'll see him dead!

I can't remember!
All the signs say go!
Would I surrender?
To try to save your soul?
I can't remember!
All the signs say go!
I'll never surrender!
It's time for heads to roll!

I can't remember!
All the signs say go!
Would I surrender?
To try to save your soul?
I can't remember!
All the signs say... go!
