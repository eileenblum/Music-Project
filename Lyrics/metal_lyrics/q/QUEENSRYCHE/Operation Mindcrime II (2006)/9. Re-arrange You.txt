[Lyrics by Geoff Tate]

Last time, missed my chance but never again.
The further away you slip, the more I'll dig in.
All things come around again
And this time I'll be ready and waiting.
You can't imagine dedication that I now possess.

There's no one left to save you.
Where you run I will follow.
I'll step by step re-arrange you.
There's nowhere to hide.

You'll never see me coming but
You'll feel the fear from my shadow.
With intensity, yeah, you'll bleed.
Before it's over you'll age ten years older.
Time flows like a river... deep.
I'm going to take you down.

There's no one left to save you.
Where you run I will follow.
I'll step by step re-arrange you.
There's nowhere to hide.

They say let the world change you
And you can change the world.
They'll bit by bit re-arrange you.
I can't change the world.

It's taken me years to get to this place.
I found you hiding inside a persona
You built from my pain.
Fortune has finally come and
Vengeance is mine I've won.
I'll take the world now by storm.

Do I let the world change me?
Do I lead or follow?
They'll step by step re-arrange me.
Let them all try!

If I let the world change me,
Step by step re-arrange me.
If I focus on tomorrow,
Maybe I could change the world!
