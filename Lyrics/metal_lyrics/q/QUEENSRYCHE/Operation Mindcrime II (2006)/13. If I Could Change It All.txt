[Lyrics by Geoff Tate]

She said, "Baby, where you been?
Why'd you have to leave me?
I'm on the other side... just looking in."
I've been so high; I climbed to the mountaintop,
Looked at myself and...

I'd tell you anything you want to hear.
And I'd desert you when I'm through.
I'd say anything because true love
Don't mean a thing to a man who's not a man, but a fool.

Look at me!
You're a model of efficiency.
I'm always doing what he tells me.
How can you change it now?

I'm always looking for it down deep inside,
I thought that this would change my life.
Have you found out?
I remember more...
Can you change?
I can change.

For years he must have cried a river of tears.
In his dreams he saw himself...
A dying man drawing figures, arrows in the sand.
Mmm, I don't think he understands.
Never thought that it would last forever.
One glance back... there's nothing much to say.
He watched as it all began spinning further and further from the truth.

And nothing really matters, when your heart doesn't lead the way.
