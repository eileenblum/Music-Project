Hey, I'm okay.
Another day, another nightmare begins.
And the sound that I hear is the relentless firing in my head.
Shifting gear in the driver's seat as the finger of g'd signals me and this concrete bloodline carries me.
Never thought I'd bring the war back home.
I'm a number; I'm a casualty of war for a cause I never had the chance, didn't understand the score.
They told me that I'd be okay, assume civilian life, live day to day.
But when I think about it my hands still shake, and I know what I am...
Man Down!
I'm in overdrive, barely alive!
As long as I keep moving, I'm all right.
Was that a muzzle flash from my past or just my mind misfiring?
With one eye in mirror I see the 'Cavalry of g'd" coming up on me.
Bumper to bumper, traveling fast, waving Satan over...
I'm a number; I'm a casualty of war, for a cause I never had the chance,
never understood the score.
They told me that I'd be okay, assume civilian life, live day to day.
But when I think about it my hands still shake, and I know what I am...
Man Down!
