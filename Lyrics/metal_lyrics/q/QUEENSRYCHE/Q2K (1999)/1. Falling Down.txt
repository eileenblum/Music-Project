Today is just the same as any other day to me.
Walking wall to wall to pass the time, I picture what it's
like on the other side.
Because I'm here on the inside of blue, without you.

Day in day out on and on ... I'm missing you.

Nothing seems to work as well, my face in the mirror looks
like hell. I think I need to see a doctor.
I watch the slow hand move line by line.  I can't even
think of the words that rhyme.

Day in day out on and on ... I'm missing you.

Some days it feels, just like falling down.
Some days it's easy, just like falling down.

Some days it's real, just like falling down.
Some days it's easy, just like falling down.

Day in day out on and on ... I'm missing you.
