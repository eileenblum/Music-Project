There you were like a ghost from my early days, staring
straight ahead at me.
How could I ever guess, from that moment on, just how
everything would change.

How could I know?

I recall something strange coming over me, somewhat at a
loss for words.
I'd been around and had my share of what I thought my soul
could bare, but never seen what I saw in your eyes.

How could I know?
We never took it slow.
We gave it all we had and more.

How could I know?
We never took it slow.
We gave it all we had and more.

Looking back at where we've been, the road ahead is so
uncertain.
We keep passing open windows forever.

I've tried before I'll try again, I never know where were
going.
I only know that I'll be yours forever ... yours
forever ... forever ... forever.

How could I know?
We never took it slow.
We gave it all we had.
We gave it all we had.
