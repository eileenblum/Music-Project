Wait for me I'll understand
I just need time to comprehend your changes
There's always been these changes in you
I remember that there was a time when
Fears we had we left behind and we danced
But it seems the more we learn
We learn that it's

Over, over
It's dangerous this game we play
You're killing me with words

Forget if you can
The way you moved when our hands touched
You forced me to force you
Do you remember the dreams,
the nightmares we shared?
The poison of love so pure it's deceiving
And deceit is all we have it's got to be over

Over, over
It's dangerous this game we play
You're killing me with words
Over, over
Too late to take a chance again it's over

Now the wireless in my hand is ringing
The distance of our lives keeps spreading
The pounding of my heart, I'm not listening
Your voice from far away is screaming it's over

Over, over
Too late to take a chance again
It's over
Over, over
It's dangerous this game we play
You're killing me, killing me
Over, over
You're too late to take a chance again
It's over
