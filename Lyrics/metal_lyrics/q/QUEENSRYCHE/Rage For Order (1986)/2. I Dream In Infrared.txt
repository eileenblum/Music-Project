As you awoke this morning
and opened up your eyes
Did you notice the tear-stains
lining your face were mine

Don't you wonder, can't you see
what's happening to our lives
I can't keep living this masquerade
When my lonely eyes see only your face at night

I only see in infrared
I can't dream anymore
Can't you see I need, too
I can't stand the pain

You've gathered all my secrets
and I don't know who I am
I even feel alone when you're near
'cause you'll never understand

When we first met I must have seemed
a million miles away
It's strange how our lives have touched
But the time is right
I'll leave tonight
Don't look in my eyes
'Cause you've never seen them so black

I only see in infrared
I can't dream anymore
Can't you see I need to
I can't stand the pain
