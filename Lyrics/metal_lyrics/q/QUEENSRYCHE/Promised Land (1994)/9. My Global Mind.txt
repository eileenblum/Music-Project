There's hunger in Africa,
and anger on assembly lines.
At the touch of a button
I'm miles away.
I want no connection, just information,
and I'm gone.

I feel so helpless,
so I turn my gaze to another place.

My global mind reaches out for the truth.

Why try holding back the wave?
You'll only drown in the changes.
You've got to learn to let go.
Just let go and experience the flight.
Try to see from a different side..
If balance is the key
maybe we'll see
a future understanding,

then we won't feel so helpless,
an turn away and hide from the change.

My global mind searches for something new.
My global mind zeros in on news.

Time and rules are changing.
Attention span is quickening.
Welcome to the Information Age.

I feel so helpless,
so I turn my gaze to another place.

My global mind searches for something new.
My global mind zeros in on news.
My global mind reaches out for the truth.
My global mind zeros in on you.

It's searching everywhere,
across the mountains,
across the oceans,
across every man made line.
No boundary gonna keep it from you.
