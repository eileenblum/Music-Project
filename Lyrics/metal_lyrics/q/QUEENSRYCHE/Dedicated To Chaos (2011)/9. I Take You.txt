You can't forgive me with blood on my lip?
I've feasted on your innocence, left you like trash on the floor.
You follow blindly, I run on empty.
I'll be the savior you crave.

If my language seems backwards then your vision is so unclear.
Your heartbeat in my hand begins to slow, way down ... I take you!
I take you ... slow.

And I take you!

Fade in memories convenient to forget.
Tasted what you hid from me and I'm on to the next.
Automatic, catatonic I won't moralize with excuses ... for âwhy me?â
I love the fear in your eyes.

It's all from memory and I'm running on empty.
I'll be the savior you crave.

If my language seems backwards, your vision is so unclear.
Your heartbeat in my hand begins to slow.
It's over! I take you! I take you ... slow.

If my language seems backwards, your vision is so unclear.
Your heartbeat in my hand begins to slow way down.
I take you! I take you ... slow
