[Special Edition Bonus Track]You're broken. Broken like a promise...
Can you remember sunny days and the smiling face of love?
My love, do you remember me?

Hush now, hush now, silly girl don't cry, just put your hand in mine.

I remember, the way you laughed and how we danced... all night.
Wish I could have died in your arms.

Hush now, hush now it's almost time.
There's no more pain, no fear, put your hand in mine.
All your wishes, all those kisses are here waiting for you. Come to me.
