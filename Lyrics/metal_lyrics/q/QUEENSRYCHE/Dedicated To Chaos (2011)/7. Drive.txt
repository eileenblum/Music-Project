I got a mind to make you mine. All mine.
I got a mind to make you mine. All mine oh.
I'm driving with my eyes closed. Show me a sign.
Driving with my eyes closed, I can feel your fire.

Always trash talking, you look so good when you go down slow.
Yeah you're acting like you got nothing to live for.
I'm driving with my eyes closed, weaving like I'm blind.
You can't be driving when your eyes are closed. I can't lose it now.

If we ever make it out alive, we may never see the light again.
We keep on trying. We keep trying.
It could all just end tonight. Can't you see the possibilities?

I got a mind to make you mine. All mine.
And I'll keep trying to make you mine. All mine oh.

Now you're back seat driving. Keep your hands off the wheel.
Who's in control? I love it when you act like your world is gonna end.

I love you baby but your driven me mad, and I know it's bad, better take it slow.
Don't know which way is up when my eyes are closed.

If we ever make it out alive, we may never see the light again at least we tried.
We keep trying. We've got to make it through this time.
Keep on trying. Keep trying. We gotta make it.
