Standing in line again, 
Waiting to buy the latest thing. 
Convinced that I'm worthless without it. 
I need this like I need a hole in my brain. 
Who gives a hoot about green solutions 
Or if there's food for the Chinese to eat?

I want what I want when I want it. 
I need gratification, adulation, self-flagellation.
I need it, I need it! I need another one

I'm busy filling the hole in my soul, it takes all my time.
Can't pay attention to what's going on,
The world is spinning faster then I can keep up.

Sell it to me. Sell it to me. I'm so down today. 
Need some retail therapy. I've got cash in hand to buy happiness.

It's my plan to find a bargain on a new cell phone.
Gotta talk to someone soon. 
Can't stand to be alone to long without feeling like
I'm going to come unglued.
I text and I text my every thought but I'm getting nothing back. 
I've got 62 apps to keep me happy but what about tomorrow?

Got to get me some more, hit the store, I'll save so much time. 
Standing in line got my credit card ready one more time. 
I swear I'm just trying to keep up. I'm so down today. 
Need some retail therapy. I've got cash in hand to buy happiness. 

I'm busy filling the hole in my soul, it takes so much time. 
ADD keeps happening to me, the world is spinning faster than I can keep up.

Sell it to me. Sell it to me. I'm so down today.
Need some retail therapy. I've got cash in hand.

Sell it to me. Sell it to me. I'm so down today. 
Need some retail therapy. I've got cash to burn. 

Wish there was something else for me.
