[Special Edition Bonus Track]I've been delt this hand but
I gotta know more ...
Got big plans for you.
Baby can't you see
What you do to me?
You've got me face down on the floor.
Your love takes me so high.
Why do you want to bring me down?
Ever since I met you I can't resist you.
Never gonna quit until I make you mine.

Loving you is like a card game, the odds are 6 to 2.
Loving you is like a freight train rolling over everything.
Loving you baby, loving you is hard to do.
So hard to do. Loving you the way I do.
Living life like the throw of the dice, I love the way you roll.
I dig your action, some fatal attraction that
Keeps me coming back for more.
Ooh, you send me higher and
You bring me down.
Once I had you I can't forget you.
Never going to quit until I make you mine.

Loving you is like a car chase,
Can't win whatever I do. I'm in the fast lane trying to stay in the game.
Loving you baby, loving you is hard to do.
So hard to do. I'm so in love with you.
So hard to do. I'll do whatever it takes Luvn U.
