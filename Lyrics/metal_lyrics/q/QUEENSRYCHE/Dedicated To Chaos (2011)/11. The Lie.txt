Read the writing on the wall.
Same story, only the names have changed.

It's all around you.
Selling fear to keep us down and while we're down, they give our jobs away.
What a shame they say.
It's all around you.
It's a LieÂ !! Lie! Lie! Lie! Lie! It's a crime!

Bankrupt the country and just walk away.
Two wars on tv, a debt our children pay.
Those elected in confidence give us illusions that freedom is our right.
Freedom is a choice!
On the outside things seem right until you stop and question why.
Another crisis situation. Another crime.
On the outside things seem right until you stop and question why.
We better look in all directions we've been sold a Lie!

It's all around you! Lie! Lie! Lie! Lie! It's a Lie!

I'm confused. Which side am I on? Blue state, red state? It's just a state of mind.
It's all around you. Why this obsession with categorization?
Why so quick to jump up paint your face?

Stop the madness, this ain't a race.

On the outside things seem right until you stop and question why.
We better look in all directions because we've been sold a lie.
On the outside things seem right until you stop and question why.
Another crisis situation. Another lie.
It's all around you! It's a LieÂ !! Lie! Lie! Lie! Lie!
