The wifi wave, I'm addicted to the wifi wave.
An indispensable satellite tool I abuse. I abuse.
The world wide web and all the pictures on YouTube, there's no escaping it.
Keeps on crawling under my skin.

Can't look away from the screen, might miss what's happening.
I'm busy surfing for some other kind of fantasy.

My mind's a river flowing don't know which way to run.

I'm wound up tight I'm like a hot spot junkie with a down loaded gun.

This Wifi frenzy world revolutionary cyber world.
Ready get some air time, air wave time. You got it under your skin?

The world wide web has the local news on YouTube.
The connectivity is crossing the threshold, crossing the threshold.

Encrypted codes and filters but there's no time to rest.
A revolutionary modern world in distress.
Just like a fire glowing, don't know how much will burn.
A WiFi knuckle hot spot junkie.

Do you feel electric rising?
Do you feel your thoughts are shattered into a million pieces?

Get some wave time, air wave time. This wifi frenzy world.
Get some wave time, air wave time. This wifi crazy world.
