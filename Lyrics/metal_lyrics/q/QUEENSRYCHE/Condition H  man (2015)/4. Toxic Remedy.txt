[Wilton, Rockenfield, La Torre]

What symbol would you choose to decorate your final breath
You contemplate then choose the misery that serves you best
Itâs too late to realize you canât dismiss your past

So look around the time is now itâs time to beware
A liquid toxic remedy itâs time to beware time to beware

Every breath you take might be the last youâll get
Looking back do you see sad eyes like who you are drowning in regret

Look around the time is now itâs time to beware
A liquid toxic remedy itâs time to beware

Melting faces upside down confinement is your friend
Solitude that's ever found forgive me father I live in sin

Itâs too late to realize you canât dismiss your past
So look around the time is now itâs time to beware
A liquid toxic remedy itâs time to beware
