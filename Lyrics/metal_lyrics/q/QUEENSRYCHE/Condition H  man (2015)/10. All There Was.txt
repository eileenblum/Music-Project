[Rockenfield, Lundgren, La Torre]

I I am the one thatâs been keeping you alive
Who am I to even try caught in the middle again
Sacrifice I give and I give and you take
Paid the price needles to say it was never enough

Lift lifting the veil revealing the mask in disguise
For you are the star no one can see a comical tragedy

Sacrifice I give and I give and you take
Paid the price needles to say it was never enough

With hope Iâll find a way
No turning back itâs to late
With love and hope you can find a way
Time will reveal whoâs left and whoâs dying alone
