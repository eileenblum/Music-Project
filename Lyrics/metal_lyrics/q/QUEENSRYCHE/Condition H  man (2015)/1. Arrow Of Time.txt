[Wilton, Jackson, La Torre]

What will you do when its right upon you like a ring of fire
Why ask why no need to justify who really cares anyway
Ethical tragedy rabid humanity learn from the past so they say

Now is the time to make up your mind and find out what is real
Fight or flight you canât run, you canât run from yourself

One reason to survive with a thousand ways to die when youâre living on the wire
Reaching the threshold near system overload caught on the red eye again

Now is the time to make up your mind and find out what is real
Fight or flight you canât run, you canât run from yourself

Close your eyes, and hear the voices in your head
Grand disguise this mass confusion revered illusion

Some grid the mast on their final descent into the darkness below
Other will fight, kick and crawl their way out, there is no heaven below

Now is the time to make up your mind and find out what is real
Fight or flight you canât run, you canât run from yourself

(FIGHT) You canât run
(FIGHT) From the arrow of time
