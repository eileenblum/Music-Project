[Wilton, Jackson, Lundgren, La Torre]

Do we ever stop and wonder whats around us
Do we take for granted what some may dream to have
Broken words of yesterday feels like I'm standing still
Promises don't mean a thing like a hunt without the kill

Do we ever take the time to see what comes and what goes by
Do we ever stop to see just who we'll leave behind who are you leaving behind
Broken words of yesterday feels like I'm standing still
Promises don't mean a thing like a hunt without the kill

As the wise man waits the widow prays searching remnants of yesterday
and the shadow cry when darkness fades we try to understand under moonlit skies

Welcome to a generation divided unity of man
Disconnected circuitry pull the trigger on demand
No remorse they have no sense of apathy
Critical mass on it's way who is searching for the truth
Desensitize the innocence quick to medicate the youth

As the wise man waits the widow prays searching remnants of yesterday
and the shadow cry when darkness fades we try to understand under moonlit skies

A chapade in broken frames gather pieces from the past
shape the species over time moralities collapse
Millennia of holy wars suppress the meek and mild
Profits of the corporate whores who will teach the child
Illusions cast in complex forms death creates new life
No reception tonight

Welcome to a generation
We are all condition hÃ¼man
No remorse they have no sense of apathy
