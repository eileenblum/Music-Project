[Wilton, Rockenfield, La Torre]

Man down into the darkness they hunt you tracking blood upon the streets
Security is breached political elite whoâs the savior when the martyr knows your name

GUARDIAN

Pixels of light infrared from the sight that shed upon you
Facing the enemy fascist supremacy fight to live another day

Itâs time to rise up, united, we stand divided we fall, evolution calling

Insurrection this time were playing for keeps
Arming police like the military its obscene and theyâre stalking the streets


Itâs time to rise up, united, we stand divided we fall, evolution calling

Torn inside weâve fallen to another side
Are we so cold and out of love
Keep on trying hold the child
Faces crying changing times

Itâs time to rise up, united, we stand divided we fall, evolution calling
