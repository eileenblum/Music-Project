[Wilton, Rockenfield, La Torre]

The metronome of rain on the rooftop
Velvet draped across the floor
Was a time when we measured but never up to our fathers
The sorrow cuts and as I stare at the blade youâve reached the dark we fear

Locked stitches in time nothing can break apart our seams
You were humble and kind pondering times as I sit in a shrine never meant to be

Rebuilding a passion that never saw a highway
How many more miles would you bare my friend
Like a jab to the throat surrealism silenced the voice but what is left to say
And all I can think is thank you for your time as I reflect with pain

Locked stitches in time nothing can break apart our seams
You were humble and kind pondering times as I sit in a shrine never meant to be

Spiraling the hourglass

You have loved you have seen through the darkest nights that steal your dreams
You have gone slipped away
Only time will help to ease the pain

Spiraling the hourglass
