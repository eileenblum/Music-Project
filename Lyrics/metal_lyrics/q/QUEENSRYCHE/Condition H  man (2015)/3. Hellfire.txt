[Wilton, La Torre]

Lock down what do we make of this madness itâs a world gone mad
Shot down identity unknown mistaken for the enemy
Artillery placed in the hands of a few psychosomatic rebellion
Collateral damage here comes the shrapnel again piercing screams in my head

Blackened shattered remains a season of change
Anger and fear fuel the fire

Blinded blind to the eyes of the world under a jaded sky
Rapture heaven of hellfire we are fractured again
Silenced from the underground
Robbing the blind and steal from the dead

Blackened shattered remains a season of change
Anger and fear fuel the fire
Hellfire

Blackened shattered remains a season of change
Anger and fear fuel the fire
Tragic, loss and despair no rhyme or reason
Blackened shattered remains black are the souls that tear down humanity
What will you do when they come for you
Theyâre closing in, theyâre coming, fight for your life
