[Wilton, Rockenfield, La Torre]

Silence whatâs that you speak reform the rights til theyâre tired and weak
Suppress the information
Confine the skeptics segregation
Strangers passing by tunnel vision under the eye in the sky
Who do you trust itâs on the currency man
What is so hard donât you understand

Selfish lives gone are the days of familiar smiles
Will we ever find our way

Do you wanna be a slave to the system full metal jacket the only position
Pick em of as easy as one, two, three
Time to amend the ideology

Selfish lives gone are the days of familiar smiles
Will we ever find our way
Selfish times a parasite of the satellites
Are we better of today

Whatâs your wavelength it is not a hard drive
Come to life inside yourself now

Selfish lives gone are the days of familiar smiles
Will we ever find our way
Selfish times a parasite of the satellites
