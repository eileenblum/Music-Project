[Wilton, La Torre]

What could I say to you thereâs nothing I wouldnât do
Weâve travelled so far now itâs just us once again
Pictures appeared from the dark
Of days long ago when we made a start
Like a gift to a stranger bring a smile to the face
Youâre my solitude my serenity with an angels face
Hearing the sound of a cry peacefully sleep to a lullaby

A silent movie scene a capsule in time
The days when we were young all we had was time
Weâll ride this train all the way to the heavens
Just you and me hand in hand
My mothers voice calling out to me from the other side patiently
Slip inside my dream carry me away

Time goes by no matter what you say or do I still love you
Time goes by but with you now the days get longer

Reflections of time theyâre yours and mine
The things that used to be still remains so fine
Is the face of a child your calm embrace
Youâre my shining star of the darkest nights a saving grace
Seeing the sings of the times forever is now thereâs no rewind

Slip inside my dream carry me away
Time goes by no matter what you say or do I still love you
Time goes by but with you now the days get longer
