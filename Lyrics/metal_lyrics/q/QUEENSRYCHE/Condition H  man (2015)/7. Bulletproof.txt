[Rockenfield, Lundgren, Jackson, La Torre]

How many times must we try
Lost in the gaze of your watering eyes
How many times have we questioned all weâve ever known
I stood right by your side but my love was not enough

Now youâre aiming thereâs no use in waiting
You know the triggers right in front of you so pull it out now and make a move Iâm bulletproof

The cleanse of surrender has freed me no longer victim of change
With secrets inside the cosmos is watching your every move
Iâm still in your sights mo matter how much I try

Now youâre aiming thereâs no use in waiting
You know the triggers right in front of you so pull it out now and make a move Iâm bulletproof
As day bleeds to night Iâm still in your sight
You know the triggers right in front of you so pull it out now and make a move Iâm bulletproof

Now youâre aiming thereâs no use in waiting
You know the triggers right in front of you so pull it out now and make a move Iâm bulletproof

And now whoâs to blame life is give and take
Searching for that special break
Only finding it was never there
