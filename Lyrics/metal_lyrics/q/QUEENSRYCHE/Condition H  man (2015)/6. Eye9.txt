[Jackson]

Running out of time nowhere to go
Iâve been searching blind through these hollow walls

Escape these boundaries hanging by a thread
Breathe through the cracks of this tunnel youâll find appeared to be here all along

Lost in the labyrinth of life stuck in the middle of the truth
Crawl through the walls of this passage youâll find the state of your mind

Thereâs nothing left thereâs nothing left for you where am I

Thumbing through these pages patterns shifting slowly moving
This consecrated ground that I stand a misunderstanding a misunderstanding

Lost in the labyrinth of life stuck in the middle of the truth
Crawl through the walls of this passage youâll find the state of your mind

Running out of time

Lost in the labyrinth of life stuck in the middle of the truth
Crawl through the walls of this passage youâll find the state of your mind

Thereâs nothing left
Eye nine
