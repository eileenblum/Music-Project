Iâve known love but I lay here empty
My eyes are closed but I find no rest
I clutch the phone like a jealous lover
I feel the weight of the world upon my chest

The sirens wail and my heart is raging
My clothes are soaked, canât catch my breath
Voices that hang on for a little longer
I feel the weight of the world
I feel the weight of the world

This story might be close to over
But thenâ¦ then again every story ends
Donât show me the light
âCause Iâm not ready to go
Iâve got so much more to say
So much more to do

Youâre alive
Iâm alive
Youâre alive
Iâ¦ Iâm alive
Iâ¦ Iâm alive

I feel the weight of the world
I feel the weightâ¦ weight of the world
If life is our message
Will they remember
Weight of the world
When Iâm gone
When Iâm gone
What was the message?

World
World
Decide

When Iâm gone
It goes on without me
Weight of the world
When Iâm gone
It goes without me
Weight of the world
When Iâm gone
When Iâm gone
What will they remember?
What will they think? What will theyâ¦?

Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember
Remember

Weight of the world
Weight of the world
Weight of the world
Weight of the world
Weight of the world
Weight of the world
Weight of the world
