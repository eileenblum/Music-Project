Butane and gasoline
Light it up and take it to extreme
When you hit, it never slows me down
I donât give a fuck, about the pressure throwinâ round

Wonât take it anymore
Wonât take it anymore

You dance around your intent
If you take me out of context
Iâll put you down, take you out

What do you got?
What do you got to show?
You canât look me in the eye, thatâs how I know

[Chorus]
You wouldnât dare
You wouldnât dare
You wouldnât dare hurt me
âCause you just might get hurt yourself

Positively guaranteed
Thereâs no one there when you bleed
Scrape away what little is left.
Gotta get your hands dirty.
Not a chance

All this time that I let you slide
Iâm just waitinâ for the day
Iâve got nothing but time

You wouldnât dare
You wouldnât dare
You wouldnât dare cross me
Or you might end up on that cross yourself

Uh, you just might get hurt
Yea, you might get hurt yourself

Gotta get your hands dirty
Gotta get your hands
Gotta get your hands dirty
Gotta get, Gotta get your hands dirty

To live in fear with every breath
I hope itâs worth it
I hope itâs worth the threat.

You think youâre different but youâre the same
Donât stand there with your folded arms
And look for someone else to blame.

You wouldnât dare
You wouldnât dare
You wouldnât dare hurt me
âCause you just might get hurt yourself.

You wouldnât dare
You wouldnât dare
You wouldnât dare hurt me
âCause you just might get hurt yourself.

Hurt hourself
Hurt yourself,
Yeah, hurt yourself
You wouldnât dare.
