She gonna grace the place you bring
Donât you love the way she sing?
Love the way she sing to me

You getting mafia dues, and the rent too
Youâve been living large in my heart
I getâ¦ I get back to you
What you gonna do when it all falls apart?
Yeah, yeah

Iâd give it to you but youâd take it too far
Yeah, you know
I wanna give it to you
But youâd probably break my heart

When Iâm there you look right through me
Donât be surprised when lightning strikes you dead
Oh, yesterday I tried to tell you again
I whispered in your ear, how do you like me so far?
Oh, how do you like me so far?
So far

All these busy strangers
Empty houses
nothing left, no fire burning here
No, no, no fire burning here

I give it to you but you take it too far
Nothing burning here
I wanna give it to you
But youâd probably break my heart

When Iâm down you look right through me
Donât be surprised when lightning strikes you dead
You dead, you dead

Remember yesterday when I whispered in your ear
And I said - how do you like me so far?
How do you like me so far? So far
How do you like me so far? So far
How do you like me so far? So far
Soâ¦

Donât be surprised when lightning strikes
Donât be surprised when lightning strikes
Donât be surprised when lightning strikes
Donât be surprised when lightning strikes

You look right through me
Youâre dead, youâre dead
Remember yesterday when I whispered in your ear
Donât be surprised when lightning strikes you dead
You dead, you dead

Remember yesterday when I whispered in your ear
And I said - how do you like me so far?
How do you like me so far? So far
How do you like me so far? So far
How do you like me so far?
