At the top of the world
In the packs of glass
Decisions made for everyone
And theyâre built to last
At the bottom landing list
Everything you want
And you canât move either way
And they know it.

Youâre a slave to the light
Yeah youâre a slave to the light
It doesnât matter what you say
Imagine what theyâd do
Turn your back, theyâre coming for you

Youâre a slave dragging your chain
Slave, youâve come pretty far.
Slave, you thought you were a superstar
But youâre just a slave.
They own you.

(Young and rich)
(Young and rich)
(Young and rich)
(Young and rich)
(Young and rich)
(Young and rich)

Thought you had them
In the palm of your hand
Even though youâve become master
What your masterâs plan
Theyâve got you tied up
Yeah, they got you bound up
Youâre left for dead
Nothing like a bitch for the bushman to fuck
Looks like youâre out of luck

Slave to the light (you're a bitch, you're the...)
Slave to the light
I got a bet, I saw everything
Give it all away
Iâd rather live with nothing than be a, be aâ¦

Slave, dragging your chain
Slave, youâve come pretty far.
Slave, you thought you were a superstar
But youâre just a slave

Youâre a slave
Nothing but a slave
Youâre a slave
Nothing but a slave
you thought you were a superstar

Slave, dragging your chain
Slave, look out for youâll fall
Slave, you thought you were a superstar
But youâre justâ¦ youâre just
A slave, dragging your chain
Slave, youâve come pretty far
Slave, you thought you were a superstar
But youâre just a slave
