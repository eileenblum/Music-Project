I just wanna bring you back somehow.
We can begin with a brand new start
We had something good for so long.

I was looking for signs
When I saw myself fall
I looked in your eyes
And I saw evil.

We could have everything and more
Anything that we can imagine
If we lean that way
I know it could happen

I never meant to break your heart
I never meant to pull my rubble with it
I want to trust that our love is real
I want to believe in this good sin

Letâs start over now
I donât want to wait
The future is ours
Itâs never too late

We could have everything
We could have everything

We could have everything
We could have everything
If you believeâ¦
Dreams do come true

We could have everything and more
Everything that life has in store
Wonât you come back to me?
I know it can happen

We could have everything
Anything that we can imagine
Just lean that way
You know anything can happen

We could have everything and more
Everything that life has in store
I swear Iâll find a way
Iâll find a way

We could have everything
We could have everything
We could have everything
We could have everything
