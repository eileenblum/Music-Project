Iâve seen the look in your eye
And thereâs noâ¦ no easy answers
You gave it all you had
But thereâs soâ¦ so many questions

Questions, questions

Through this insane desire
Through this unbearable lie
Lies and empty promises
All this just fades. Fade to grey

Yes, I know
Fade to grey
That youâre falling, falling
I believe you could say anything
Anything, youâd say anything
When youâre fallen, fallenâ¦

Whatâs buried inside must speak
An innocent victim
The echoes of your past
Will someday grow silent
The hardship you have wonât last

Through this insane desire
Through this unbearable lie
Close your eyes and look inside
All this will fade

Fade to grey
Yes, I know
That youâre fallen, fallen
I believe youâd say anything
Youâd do anything, youâd say anything
When youâre fallen, fallenâ¦

Fade to grey

I believe you could say anything
Anything, youâd say anything
When youâre fallen
When youâre fallen, fallen
When youâre fallen, fallen
When youâre fallen, fallen
