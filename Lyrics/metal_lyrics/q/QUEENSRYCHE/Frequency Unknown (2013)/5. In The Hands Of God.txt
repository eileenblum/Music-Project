One, two.

This is the day
Familiar voice on the phone
Are you ready? Yes

Donât give a damn,
Consequences of the plan
Are you ready? Yes

Ready, are you?
Iâve thought of every, everything possible
Iâve thought of every way out of this, every way out

Wonât you tell them the truth when they find me?
Wonât you tell them itâs in the handsâ¦ the hands of God?

Mired in
Night vision switched on
And Iâm ready
Ready, are you ready?
My God will know me
Convinced of my righteousness
My God will know by my actions
This was necessary

Wonât you tell them the truth when they find me?
Tell themâ¦ tell them itâs in the handsâ¦ the hands of God.
Iâm the one that they want
When you see what Iâve done,
Wonât you tell them itâs in the hands, itâs in the hands of God?

Iâll stop at nothing
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood
The blood is on yourâ¦
Youâll speak of what Iâve done
The blood is on yourâ¦
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood
No oneâs innocent
They call me a madman
The blood, the blood, the blood, the blood
Your handsâ¦ itâs on your hands
No oneâs innocent
No oneâs innocent
Innocent

Wonât you tell them the truth when they find me?
Iâm the one, the one they want.
Itâs in the handsâ¦ the hands of God

Burn in the fire, Iâm the one, the one they want.

Itâs in the hands of Godâ¦ the hands of God

Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Are you?
