You couldnât take any more
I heard the lock click
You closed the door
Like a rat in a trap of my design
Then they played our song,
donât play that song again on the radio

The chances that we take,
The promises we break
Thereâs no life without you
Life without you, life without you
Whatâs there left to say?
When words get in the way
Thereâs no life without you
Life without you, life without you

Revolution was in the air
It was everywhere
On the streets, on your lips
Itâs hard to believe
Believe itâs over

I believe
I thought, âThis is all I want.â
But I was so young
I wanted so much more

The choices that we make
The promises we break
Thereâs no life without you
Life without you, life without you

The challenge that we face
Actions without grace
Thereâs no life without you
Life without you, life without you

The chances that we take
Life without you

Theyâre playing our song again
And it plays over and over.
In my mind Iâm reminded of life without you.

Thereâs no life without you
Life without you, life without you
Whatâs there left to say?
Whatâs there left to say?
Life without you, life without you
Whatâs there left?
