Last time I looked you werenât feeling too good about love
Said âIâve had it up to here, really had enough,
Been a rough go.â
When I asked âWhat happened next?â You said,
âThis wonât do,â you said âNah, nah, nah, nah, nah."

Old, memories gather pain
Screaming through the back door, running
If you could, youâd nail him to the wall
Keep running, keep running backwards

Running backwards
Running backwards
Running backwards
Running backwards

Had you on your on your back before you knew what was wrong
Face down in the dirt, innocence gone.
That was the day you said the same thing: âThis wonât do,"
You said, âNah, nah, nah, nah, nah."

Youâll never get away from feeling that itâs your fault,
Youâre the one to blame. If you could, youâd
Take a blaze onto his balls
Keep running, keep running backwards

Running backwards
Running backwards
Running backwards

Running backwards
Running backwards
Running backwards

Old memories gather pain,
Screaming through the back door
The back door
If you could, youâd nail him to the wall
Keep running, keep running backwards
Youâll never get away
From feeling that itâs your fault, itâs your fault
If you could youâd nail him to the wall
Keep running, Keep running
Keep running backwards
