All alone still searching
Patiently holding on
She cries and cries
Wondering when will it end
She tries and tries
Hopes and dreams will fade

The sky lost in grey
No light to find your way
Still she pulls through another day

The hurt he wears broken
Lines on his face, emptiness
He cries and cries
Hoping she'll be there again
He tries and tries
Never to surrender

When you're lost and lonely and you're reaching for me

The sky lost in grey
No light to find your way
Only time will tell

The sky lost in grey
No light to find your way

When you're lost and lonely and you're reaching for me
