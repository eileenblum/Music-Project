Hear the voices in your head
Do they speak of grand delusion
Moral truths to comprehend
The soul's contusion, the scarred reunion

And you dream, can you feel me, can you feel me?

Colors change from black to red, I'll never remember
Still you search for the meaning
Strange lies hypnotize me you know, I'll never surrender
And still you scream from madness

And you dream, can you feel me, can you feel me?
Fantasy, dreaming, can you feel me?

There are many truths behind these eyes that you see
On one side love and laughter, the other darkened disbelief
Searching for the sunset clause for my release
Sincerely, Mr. Post-traumatic looking for some peace

And you dream, can you feel me, can you feel me?
Fantasy, dreaming
And you dream, you know I'm dreaming
Fantasy
