Lightning (charging with a vengeance)
Strikes you (spreading like fire)
Takes you down, down, down
Sell me what's real become desensitized
Pushing their own point of view

Lies, shoving it down, down, your throat, lies

System (no communication)
Broken (poisoned motherfuckers)
Spins you round, round, round
Media persuasion, speeches and names
Paved by the one's with the crown

Lies distort your mind, makes you blind

Tonight your freedom dies
The scars to prove it no reason or no rhyme
The twisted web of lies
Just take your time and hurry up
You're free to do what you're told

Propaganda fashion
Propaganda fashion

Lightning strikes, tension builds
Social cancer rots you away
Crimes, what's it take to realize

Tonight your freedom dies
The scars to prove it no reason or no rhyme
The twisted web of lies
Just take your, just take your time

Propaganda fashion
