Light, great rays of light
Speak from the sun
Now it's your turn
Find the echoes of time
Warping your mind
Conscious to all your senses

Stranger than illusion
Sifting through the hands of time

And when you reach for the stars, hold on
And when you think that you can't go on, don't let go

Come, now what do you see
Can we imagine life without you
All that's changing and rearranging
The suffering is what we've come to now

And when you reach for the stars, hold on
And when you think that you can't go on, don't let go

Fear not what you've become
Not what you see
Nor things that could never be

And when you reach for the stars, hold on
And when you think that you can't go on, don't let go
