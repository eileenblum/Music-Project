Light-years and shadows, you'll never see the end of day
Distant horizon, far beyond the past you cannot save

Whispers, no silence, echoing the sounds from far away
Sequenced pariahs, following the footsteps to your grave

Pulling me down the undertow
It's dragging me now, I'm paralyzed
Beyond the distance is out of reach
There's no more I can take

Light-years, you'll never see the end of day
Distant, it's far beyond you cannot save

Pulling me down the undertow
It's dragging me now, I'm paralyzed
Beyond the distance is out of reach

Pulling me down the undertow
It's dragging me now, I'm paralyzed
Beyond the distance is out of reach
