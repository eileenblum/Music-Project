Foresight, casting the stone, no forgiving
Transcribed, immoral objective engaged
What I see, hold them down for not believing, tyranny

Subscribe, question what stares in your eyes
Quick to derive what makes of the sinner or saint
Right or wrong, weak or strong

Walls binding, reason holds the key
Taught violence, reconditioning
Find the solution, destiny
To be free again you justify the sin
Launder the conscience
