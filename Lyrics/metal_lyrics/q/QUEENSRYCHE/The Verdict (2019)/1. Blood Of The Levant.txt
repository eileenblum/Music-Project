Stuck in the middle of a warzone
I feel your cry
Knee deep, I hear the sound
Lighting up the sky

Shelling, the cowards let it rain
From a tag on the wall
The violent coloration on the faces of the youth
Enraged them all

Lies, feeding lies
We are the rebels
Lies, feeding lies
We are the rebels

Dying (hit the ground)
Hiding (face first down)
Are we too far from no return?
Dying (hit the ground)
Hiding (face first down)
Where's the path to sovereignty

[English transliteration:
"nahn lasna aleadua
nahn nurid alsalam"]
[English translation:
"We want peace.
We are not the enemy."]

Turned to ashes
Our paradise reduced to dust
We are not the ones to fear
Misunderstood in sadness
Painted blood-red stains
We breathe the same
And we bleed the same

Dying
Hiding
Are we too far from no return?
Dying (hit the ground)
Hiding (face first down)
Where's the path to sovereignty
