Shakin' time, she needs
Taking rides...to somewhere
Let's lose our minds, no hurry
I'm the wakeful night,
with dreams...or something

Chasing blue sky,
We're chasing blue sky

Taking time from all this worry
Mesmerized by the waves of your smile
I wish that i could say something

But you're the rose colored glass i see through
I'll see you through

Chasing blue sky, we're chasing blue sky
Chasing blue sky, we're chasing blue sky

Chasing blue sky, we're chasing blue sky
Chasing blue sky, we're chasing blue sky
