[Wilton/La Torre]

The ignorance of youth, the pawns of corporate greed
The raping of our mother earth, no planting of a seed
A revolution on the brink, distracted masses writhe
Another human born to kill, inherent to survive
Have you seen the vibrant shades of green
Or is your mind a blood red haze which cries and only grieves

Don't look back, I won't be standing here...I'm lost but not afraid
Marching on beyond the sun, you've gotta free your mind you are the master or the slave

The innocence and purity consumes the starving child
The mother's pain filled tears they fall, yet still she bears a smile

Don't look back, I won't be standing here...I'm lost but not afraid
Marching on beyond the sun, you've gotta free your mind you are the master or the slave

You're in a sea of deceit in a body of lies

Don't look back, I won't be standing here...I'm lost but not afraid
Marching on beyond the sun, you've gotta free your mind you are the master or the slave

Magnetize what you conceptualize because your thoughts become things
This is the Law of Attraction
