Taking what they will feed you
Ingesting lies they claim as true
Reflection, desperation
You pave the path that you tread

Traveling at Light Speed
Manipulation, fueled by Greed
Social Discontent and Hate,
Population regulate

[Chorus i]
Search and youâll find the answers
To be the change that you want to see
A mind as narrow as the road I walk
Always upright but always wrong
They foresee violation of the law and suicide of remorse

[Spoken:]
Unreflecting human kind, justification for the crime

Reaction against control
The corporate stranglehold
Tear down their walls of fallacy
Be willing to surrender what you are
For what you could become
Altering your destiny

Traveling at Light Speed
Manipulation, fueled by Greed
Social Discontent and Hate,
Population regulate
Evangelize the simple minds
Tithing from the weak and blind
Arrogate through media
Instigate acedia

[Chorus II:]
Search and youâll find the answers
To be the change that you want to see
Grant the serenity reclaiming honor and dignity
Canât you see whatâs going wrong?
Donât you feel it growing strong?
Donât let go, keep holding on
Working forces kneel you down
Authority and power ruling out

[Spoken:]
Mass regimentation
A phenomenon of industrialization
Reaction against control
Striving to attain a common goal

[Chorus III:]
Search and youâll find the answers
To be the change that you want to see
Grant the serenity reclaiming honor and dignity
A mind as narrow as the road I walk
Always upright but always wrong
Working forces kneel you down
Authority and power ruling out
Always upright but always wrong
Always upright but always wrong
Always upright but always wrong
They foresee violation of the law and suicide of remorse
