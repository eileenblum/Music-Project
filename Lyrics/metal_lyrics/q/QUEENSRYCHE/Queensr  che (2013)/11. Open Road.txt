[Rockenfield/La Torre/Wilton]

Shades of grey were the colors of my soul
Accepted miseries embraced for oh so long

The hands of time sweeping all my dreams away
Lost in a circumstantial maze

Moving on to another day
Searching for a brighter shade of grey

A somber silhouette displays the beauty of a dream
Until I realized your open eyes in front of me

You color my life with everything you do
And this open road only leads me back to you

Moving on to another day
Searching for a better way (a better way)
Seek and you will find the cure a blessing in disguise right before your eyes
