[Rockenfield/Jackson]

I've walked for miles down empty roads, today
Lighting the way the fireflies, unafraid
I try to escape and learn to survive, somehow the rain changed me by surprise
I recognize from the crying sky, the road to nowhere as I follow seems to haunt me

I'll break the chains for you but only to remind me, no preservation no paradise
The pounding of the rain with thunder and its lighting
The storm's reflection like a mirror on my face

Where did it all go wrong, when will it all go right, someday
I've been searchin' for answers all my life, to rise above a jaded world that seemed to haunt me.

I'll break the chains for you but only to remind me, no preservation no paradise
