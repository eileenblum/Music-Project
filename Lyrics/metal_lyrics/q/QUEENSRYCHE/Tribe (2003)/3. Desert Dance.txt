[Music by:  DeGarmo / Rockenfield / Tate / Wilton]

With a simple wave,
her hand creates my universe.
She spins and dances around the fire.
Eyes search the open road,
caught up in the sound of
transmissions burning down the wire.

We reach out for the sky
and were never coming down.
We reach out for the sky
and were never coming down.

Live life in extreme
better then any magazine could ever hope to describe.
Ripped, we sweat this desert dance, baby do your best.
We're on our way to higher consciousness.

We reach out for the sky
and we're never coming down.

Keep reaching, keep reaching.
We're never coming down.

High on a million breaths of her,
I surrender to the magic all around me.

We reach out for the sky
and we're never coming down.
