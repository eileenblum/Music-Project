All eyes were staring
you floated through the room.
Armed with your razor smile
cutting to the bone.
My voice fell useless
you flashed a quick "Hello."
Feeling the fool,
could you tell it showed?

But that was "Sometime Ago."
A memory vague and fading slow,
of somewhere I'd been.

Hand On Heart
A promise, a word and a voice
Hand On Heart
A rhythm of hope and choice, will keep us together.

I don't know if I,
can reach that high.
It's a long way to fall
Hauntingly holding
my fate with a gaze.
Like a child, mesmerized
by the candle's flame.
Oh what lies behind those eyes
I could only guess.
That certain way you stood
apart from the rest.

Now where is "Sometime Ago?"
When everything moved in slo-motion.
Caught by my watering eye

Hand On Heart
A promise, a word and a voice
Hand On Heart
A rhythm of hope and a vision of choice
Hand On Heart
Promising, I'll never go.
Hand On Heart
For reasons you'll never know.

Together through thick and thin
lose or win, I'll be there for you.
Strange how the mind changes
time and time again.
Things once important, now
pale in comparison.

Hand On Heart
A promise, a word and a voice
Hand On Heart
A rhythm of hope and a vision of choice
Hand On Heart
Promising, I'll never go.
Hand On Heart
For reasons you'll never know.

I promise girl, Hand On Heart.
