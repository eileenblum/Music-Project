Don't slam the door, on your way out
Don't leave without saying goodbye.
Another long distance night alone,
you leave me wanting, always leave me wanting more.
Last word today, coming home to stay?
Wouldn't that be nice, for a while?

But now my take-out food is growing cold,
and the candle's burned a hole in the floor.
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone.

I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Guess I'll leave a light on for you.
It's just another rainy night, without you.

Listen, there's a foghorn blowing
from the coast tonight
Remember making love in the rain?
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound
Raindrops taste like tears without the pain.
I'm not much without you, can't leave
if I wanted to. maybe that's why you stay around

But tonight I'll sit here tending the fire
and pace the floor one hundred times in an hour.
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called.

I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Waiting by the phone. Alone.
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Guess I'll leave a light on for you.

I know I've said it before
hate the sound of the closing door
and your footsteps walking away.

[solo]

But now my take-out food is growing cold,
and the candle's burned a hole in the floor.
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone.v
I'm all alone
It's just another rainy night, without you.
Waiting by the phone. Alone.
And it's another rainy night, without you.
Guess I'll leave a light on for you.

It's just another rainy night, another rainy night,
another rainy night without you.
