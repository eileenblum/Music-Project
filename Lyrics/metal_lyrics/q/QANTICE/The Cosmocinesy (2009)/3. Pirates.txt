Tavern on a land in the sky 
Beyond the Oeuclarine border 
That's where the lawless come to hide 
they would do anything to live longer 
To gain the science of immortals 
They steal, they abduct, they slaughter 
Now it's time for me to infiltrate them all 

Flying pirates we brave the ones 
Who wanna rule the air 
Flying pirates we help ourselves 
Roaming over the world 

I've played my part and joined the crew 
For my investigation 
I have come here following a clue 
My dear planet Shyphelia has been stolen 
With a mysterious device 
Maybe in their possession 
Now they're taking me with them on a ride 

Flying pirates we brave the ones 
Who wanna rule the air 
Flying pirates we help ourselves 
Roaming over the world 

Sailing away, beyond gliding oceans 
Search for a prey, ready to fire guns 

This is the place 
Where they hide all the loots 
Unlock the cells 
Prisoners, go ! Break out ! 

We are threading our way 
In the frame of the star manor 
Stalking until we may 
Swoop down on each sailor 

Flying pirates inside your brain 
A lead I'm holding tight 
Flying pirates enslaved, for me 
You will obey and fight 
Flying pirates you've lost with those 
Who wanna rule the air 
Flying pirates you'll serve the peace 
Roaming over the world
