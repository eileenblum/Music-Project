The air is gathering cells 
There's a force awakening a spell 
Back up of the ancient being that 
Was me 

Streaming worlds along my way 
Onslaught of memories gone astray 
Over a land that is never ending 

Synnaxis, the dimension 
Where my will to shape 
Can be read 
Space I feel, in my vision 
Whatever I conceive 
Can be made 

If I recoiled 
If the frame sent me back 
Should I still grope my way in the dark 
If I recalled 
If I knew what I lack 
Would I forever reel on the track 

Come to you, friends of the Haven 
Rest by you, and I'm gone 

If I recoiled 
If the frame sent me back 
Should I still grope my way in the dark 
If I recalled 
If I knew what I lack 
Would I forever reel on the track
