Our continent's wearing in mourning 
Insect ocean has torn our lives 
(Insect ocean) 
The land is black, the wind is moaning 
Today, millions of people died 
(Under an insect ocean) 

Burial wave came from the sea 
Dismaying eyes looked up and saw 
Impending death was coming nearer 
And some would never see the sun 
Anymore 

Among the dust creatures are creeping 
Al covered by itches and bites 
(Insect ocean) 
The smoke has cleared, a kid is crying 
Under the heavy bleeding sky 
(Under an insect ocean) 


Burial wave came from the sea 
Dismaying eyes looked up and saw 
Impending death was coming nearer 
And some would never see the sun 
Anymore 

Swaying bodies grow and crack 
Inside out 
The breed is ready for the light 

And now a new era has begun 
Over the land of the mutants 
(Insect ocean) 
Delivering red hot religion 
Pretending they are still humans 
(Under an insect ocean) 

Burial wave came from the sea 
Dismaying eyes looked up and saw 
Impending death was coming nearer 
And they will never be the same 
Anymore
