City of metal and light 
Black sea witnessing the risind of the 
Chaos, what have they become 
Mad ground 
Puppets on a string playing some 

War games from the past 
Barbarian fights 
Tearing down a whole society 
Star ships in the air 
Hits everywhere 
But I don't feel anything 

Yes, I'll be the hero that you need 
Concern I can even fake 
Wiring my spirit for the deed 
I will break into the world of fright 
Compassion and hate 

Changes, all along the trail 
Crazy, could there be a link with the 
Stranger, concealed in a veil 
Who's she 
Why would a megantrop need some 

War games from the past 
Barbarian fights 
Tearing down a whole society 
Star ships in the air 
Hits everywhere 
But I don't feel anything 

Yes, I'll be the hero that you need 
Concern I can even fake 
Wiring my spirit for the deed 
I will break into the world of fright 
Compassion and hate 

Between opponents I intervene 
Creating a diversion 
Since I am propelled by empathy 
'Til sacrifice I'll go on 

Overflowing feeling in my mind 
Narrow the field of conscience 
Torn by anguish, my reason is blind 
Powerless, avenger ennemies 
Jump on the chance 

Killing me would make my clone appear 
They won't do me the favour 
Unthinking masses led by the fear 
Keep me in pain forever
