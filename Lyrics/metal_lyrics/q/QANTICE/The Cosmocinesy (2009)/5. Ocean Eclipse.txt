Wrapped in a cloack she came to me 
No light or sound escaped her sphere 
The sea, filtering, celestial delight 
But you're remaining in the dark 

Open your veil 
Step in the light 
Show a smile 
Let me carry your pain 
Just for a while 

There used to be a world right here 
Sailing within the tail of the comet 
Aplace where all the scars would heal 
So follow me and we'll find it 

The sea, filtering, celestial delight 
You're dreaming until comes the end 

Open your veil 
Step in the light 
Show a smile 
Let me carry your pain 
Just for a while 

Leave your veil on 
Do what you want 
For a smile 
I would carry your pain 
More than a while 
Leave your veil on 
Let's play hide and silk 
Now you smile 
I can feel rainbow lights 
Spring from your tears 
Don't fly away
