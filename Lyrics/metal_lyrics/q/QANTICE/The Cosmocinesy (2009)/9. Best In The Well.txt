Dropping for a cliff 
Slackening with time 
Falling leaf deep down the mine 
Bottom light-years from me 
Below, frozen decades strech avay 
Sorry I can not return 
a star drowning in the delay 
Now I know, I found where you are 

And we will again 
Weave ourselves into the ring 
Stargazing roundabout 
Like a wraith 
We'll saddle the orbiting winds 
Haunting the roundabout 

Syphiads and fairies 
Budding on the trees 
Wipe out all the grief 
Blowing wonderful breeze 
Cloning is our chance 
Atoms one by one, in outerspace 
Will outlive us as we go down 
Now I know, I found where you are 

And we will again 
Weave ourselves into the ring 
Stargazing roundabout 
Like a wraith 
We'll saddle the orbiting winds 
Haunting the roundabout 

But I wish to go, for I need to solve 
The mysteries and find the keys 
To breathe a real love 
Interrogation, all the lies you contain 
Wrongness I hunt 
On and on, forever again 

And we will again 
Weave ourselves into the ring 
Stargazing roundabout 
Like a wraith 
We'll saddle the orbiting winds 
Haunting the roundabout 

And we will again 
Weave ourselves into the ring 
Stargazing roundabout 
Like a wraith 
We'll saddle the orbiting winds 
Haunting the roundabout
