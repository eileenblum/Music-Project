Regenerated 
I'm following a trace 
Reaching for a weird 
Astronomical maze 
Suddenly a voice 
Telling the ga^me is open 
Leaving us no choice 
Hostages are taken 

Puzzle's riddles 'n trials 
I have played the game 
On and on 
Harder 'n faster, crazier 
Tensions in my brain 
Overload 
One last enigma before 
Syphelia can soar 

Capturing, duality, returning 
You may see more of me 
If you put me in abyss 
Capturing, reality, returning 
With me you will find who I am 

How long have I been 
Deep down in my thoughts 
Standing on a green 
Infinite glassy road 
Suddenly it shines 
I got the solution 
Just had to open my eyes 
And use my reflection 

Puzzle's riddles 'n trials 
I have played the game 
On and on 
Harder 'n faster, crazier 
Tensions in my brain 
Overload 
One last enigma before 
Syphelia can soar 

Capturing, duality, returning 
You may see more of me 
If you put me in abyss 
Capturing, reality, returning 
With me you will find who I am 

Capturing, duality, returning 
You may see more of me 
If you put me in abyss 
Capturing, reality, returning 
With me you will find who I am
