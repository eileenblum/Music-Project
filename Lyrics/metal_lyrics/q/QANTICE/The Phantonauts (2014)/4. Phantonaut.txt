[or "The Formidable and Intoxicating Benefits of the Ultimate Cloaking Armor"]

I'm holding my breath
As I fly through the vault
Beyond the reach of death
I'm a Phantonaut

I'm invisible
Fully permeable
For my diving armor
Subsoil is water

No way to feel me
No touch, nothing to hear
Inside my mandorla
I'm here for no one

I am far too wise
To risk losing my life
Sheltered in my new skin
I will always win

No one can hurt me
No one can save me
All locked up in my shell
You can't hear me yell

I'm holding my breath
As I fly through the vault
Beyond the reach of death
I'm a Phantonaut

To better fathom
The world's actuality
I have cut myself from
Its reality

No one standing on my way
For I am the hyper ghost
To no force I will obey
No one kills a Phantonaut

I can dive in the underworld
Lurk among the rising dead
Even stars can't get me burned
Shot my body into space

Is it just a dream?
Am I or am I not
A Phantonaut?
