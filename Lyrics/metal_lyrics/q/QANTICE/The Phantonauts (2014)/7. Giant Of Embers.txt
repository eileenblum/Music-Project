[or "The Walking Mountain Looking for a Meaning to His Life"]

Listen to the story of the insolents
Long ago they were flying giants
But they crashed to the ground
And got turned into stone

Now the legend has awakened

[Chorus:]
Giant of embers
Gamboling mountain
King of the awkwards
Is shelling our plains

While under the crust
The magma in his veins
So ingenuous
Is looking for a brain

The monster terror
Is freezing the people
Gazing at the lava tears that fall
They have a deadly crush
And get burned into dust

Cause the legend has awakened

[Chorus 2x]

While under the crust
The magma in his veins
Has found a new voice
Ringing out like a brain
