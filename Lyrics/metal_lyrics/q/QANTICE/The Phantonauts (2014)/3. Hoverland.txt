[or "The Overview of Weird Events in an Already Weird World"]

Welcome to the least worst
Imperfect universe
Allowing anything to occur
A never-ending ground
Planets seeding the clouds
Showering in the flying rivers
And the powers of a stone
Mutants breeding new clones
Toying with the landscapes, and their homes,
The Cautious are amazed
They are racking their brains
Hanging on trying to understand

The Misfortune-Drillers
Interlace together
In a shadow gliding through the dawn
The Reckless put his mind
In the fury outside
Found out new colors but lost his own
The Expert will surmise
That the dead can arise
In a hollow city underworld
And they're causing the flares
Mountains thrashing the air and the sun

But I don't know

[Chorus:]
Over land, I do not believe, I hover
Understand, I don't disbelieve, I wonder
In the end, the questions laugh at the answers, forever

From the border of ice
To the whirl in the sky
A wind of puzzlement's passing on
In the heat of a strife
A legend came to life
Crumbled our line of the horizon
Are there limitations
But imagination
Tunnel visions of reality
The walls of dissonance
Ruts of least resistance
What is leading the dance? Are we free?

The Misfortune-Drillers
Interlace together
In a shadow gliding through the dawn
The Reckless put his mind
In the fury outside
Found out new colors but lost his own
The Expert is certain
Megantrops are villains
And they're pulling the strings
Of the world

And they're causing the flares
Mountains thrashing the air and the sun

But I still don't know

[Chorus 3x]
