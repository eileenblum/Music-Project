[or "The Instantaneous Travel to a Very Warm Place Far Far Away"]

Portal cutting space
Before our eyes
Cancel the distance
Through your doors
We are going to fly

[Chorus:]
Light-years away
Beyond the sky
In the ballet
Glittering in the night

Stars, all the forms
You can hatch
In the depths
Of your cores
Coming to life

Harbour far behind
A sun we find
So strange from outside
In your heart
We are going to dive

[Chorus 2x]

Light-years away
Beyond the sky
In the ballet
Enchanting the night
