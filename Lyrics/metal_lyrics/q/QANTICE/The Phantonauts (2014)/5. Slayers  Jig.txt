[or "the Nuisances of a Killing Feast to a Pirates' Quest in the Empirion of Mey"]

Rite has begun
Everyone is hunter and prey
Start to run
Stay away from the trumpeting jowls
The caress of razor claws
Don't you expect no mercy
For them it's just a party

Welcome to us
The numerous
The warm and glorious
Be one of us
Until the hearse

They have a planet plugged in the ground
Guardian of ancient memories
Ruined civilization
We wanna solve your mysteries

[Chorus:]
We're the unwise
Dust in a whim
Risking our lives
Chasing a dream
Who's gonna be
The survivors
After the jig of the slayers
Who's gonna be
The survivors
After the jig of the slayers

Welcome to us
The numerous
The warm and glorious
Be one of us
Until the hearse

Chased by the crowd
We are still riding
If one gets caught
The fight begins
Violently
Cheerfully
Fatally, fatally

[Chorus]
