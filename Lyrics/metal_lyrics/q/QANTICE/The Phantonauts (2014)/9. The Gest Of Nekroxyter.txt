[or "The Twists and Turns of the Afterlife"]

Wake up my friend
Cause you are not so dead
This is your chance
To go back on stage
Regrets, wishes
Who else could you be?
Explore your deep
Potentiality

Beyond the path of the whispers
Where your journey's begun
Through gears 'n spirals you fall
Becoming a cell puzzle

Among the misshapen creatures
You're just another grotesque
Beware of the neighbors
Chaining up puppets

[Chorus:]
Mess in the underworld
Shaken by a storm
Bursting out, disrupting the grace
Rolling upside down

Mess in the underworld
Stale criterions
Sorting out the flaws in a fuss
Healing the breakdown

Some old friends might be around
Skewed echoes from the past
In the crypted nightmarish scenes
It's up to you to find out

The rumor bubble is racing
Against the invisible
The Phantonauts are attempting
The impossible

[Chorus]

The fog's fallen
On the story
Foam of serenity

Free and safe
In this haven
Until the storm is back again

[Chorus]
