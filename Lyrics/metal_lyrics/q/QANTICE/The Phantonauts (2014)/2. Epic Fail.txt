[or "The Misty Reversal of the Bushel People's Invasion of Ontreno"]

Bushel troopers
Are you ready to strike?
The outlaws with the shape of a star
Ignoring us
Mocking the rules of fight
As if they'd never heard about war

[Chorus:]
Fire harvesting the soil and the sky
Whipping the ancient and the wild
Against the danger of the
Dire increase of the poisonous clowns
The mutants who burst into clouds
Cause only the strong will survive

Meanwhile, higher,
Moved by sorrow,
The pirate island's reviving heroes

In this madness
Find the helpless
Take them on your board
Fly away from

[Chorus]

[Chorus:]
Fire harvesting the soil and the sky
Whipping the ancient and the wild
Against the danger of the
Dire increase of the poisonous clowns
The mutants who burst into clouds
The puffs that bite

See the return of the peace
Rising up from the mist
With a new mutant breed
