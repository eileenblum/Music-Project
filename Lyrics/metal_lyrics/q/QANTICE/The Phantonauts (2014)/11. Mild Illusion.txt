[or "Reunion in an Abyss"]

Emerging from the ground
Milky rain in our eyes
Slow motion all around
Is it real or a mild
Illusion
Uniting us
On a lone
Fairy world
Falling down

From above the abyss
A spaceship has arrived
Heroes born from
The mist
Are they real or a mild
Illusion
Reminding us
Of a lone
Fairy world
Falling down

Just a mild illusion
Uniting us
On a wonderful world

Just a mild illusion
Uniting us
On a wonderful world
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
