Celestial conscience
Away from the flow
Losing my radiance
To this void in the low

Whispers on my skin
Melting one by one
I'm the waste of a dream
Drifting down, all alone

My fading halo dissolves into space
My rays into darkness are freezing to death

Even my torments
Are slowly falling
Into deep drowsiness
Dying eternally

My fading halo dissolves into space
My rays into darkness are freezing to death

My fading halo dissolves into space
My rays into darkness are freezing to death

My fading halo dissolves into space
My rays into darkness are freezing to death

My fading halo dissolves into space
My rays into darkness are freezing to death
