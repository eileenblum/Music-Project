Tumbles all over the place
Glidings and rolls
Watch out for yourself
You are part of the show
Spreading the pranks everywhere
Bubonic chaos
Is getting on your nerves
All your marks have been lost

From the ground to the cities in the clouds
All the world is our playground arena
No, there are things you'll never know
For this game is knowing no limit

Embrace the madness
Be wild and boundless
And dive to the sky
Nobody will die, unless
You stop trusting yourself
Again
Embrace the madness
Be wild and boundless and dive

Try to comply to the rules
That won't be told
If you follow the fools
You might fit in the mold
With us nothing is for sure
Through the unknown
The poison is the cure
To survive with the clowns

From the ground to the cities in the clouds
All the world is our playground arena
No, there are things you'll never know
For this game is knowing no limit

Embrace the madness
Be wild and boundless
And dive to the sky
Nobody will die, unless
You stop trusting yourself
Again
Embrace the madness
Be wild and boundless and dive
