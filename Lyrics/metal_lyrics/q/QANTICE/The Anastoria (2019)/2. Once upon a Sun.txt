Duel has begun it's for real
Find the nerves to control your fear
The freaks of fire want me dead
Destroyed, ingloriously blazed

I have come from so far away
Broke some laws I don't understand
Beyond the point of no return
I'm trapped in this burning world

Face-off between life and death
Nowhere to flee, I am

Gone astray into the unknown
Space and time are merging together
Froze my life in an endless now
Confronting my fears once upon a sun

All this time I've been safe in my shell
My foe is just myself

Gone astray into the unknown
Space and time are merging together
Gone astray into the unknown
Space and time are merging together
Froze my life in an endless now
Confronting my fears once upon a sun
