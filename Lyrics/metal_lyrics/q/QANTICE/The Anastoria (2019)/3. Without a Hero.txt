Echoes of you are still sparkling
Upon the dust in the air
Ghost memories are reflecting
Into the sea of despair

Since you've been gone in the abyss
Balance of power has died
Fearing the wind of a crisis
Lands have fallen to our skies

But someday you will return
From the dark you will blast like a sun

Can we live without a hero?
Can we steer our destiny?
Seeking light into a shadow
Haven't we learnt anything?

You always said you'd be leaving
Lone wanderer of the stars
Needless to cry we'll be fighting
And carry on with your path

'Til the day you will return
From the dark you will blast like a sun

Can we live without a hero?
Can we steer our destiny?
Seeking light into a shadow
Haven't we learnt anything?

Fly on the winds
Awake in the dusk
Carried by your wings
In reflections I have seen
The hero under my skin

We do wanna be victorious
Everyone is gonna fear you
Gather powers of a Megantrop

Unite the only way is to
Unite the only way is to
Fight, unleash thunder
Fight, unleash thunder

Can we live without a hero?
Can we steer our destiny?
Seeking light into a shadow
Haven't we learnt anything?
