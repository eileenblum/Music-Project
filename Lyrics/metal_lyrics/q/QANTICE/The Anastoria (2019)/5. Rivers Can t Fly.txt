I am the spell gushing from
The engine room of the world
I am wild splashing drops getting speed
Racing high with the chimes of the wind

My awareness is a dream
Shattered figures on a screen
As I'm snaking my jets through the sky
All is one, no more wondering why

Tensions heighten the waves of the
Oceans bumping the clouds and the
Islands sailing the air I am

Flowing forever I'm
Flowing through storms I am
Flowing in serenity
Flowing so lawless but
Flowing impossibly
Flowing through reality

Travel the veins of the trees
Flapping their leaves in the breeze
Spin away from yourself for a while
Gravity is just another lie

Tensions heighten the waves of the
Oceans bumping the clouds and the
Islands sailing the air I am

Flowing forever I'm
Flowing through storms I am
Flowing in serenity
Flowing so lawless but
Flowing impossibly
Flowing through reality

Fountains in the air
Are rising everywhere
Chanting for the ones
Who sail away
Colors of the ghosts
Explode in the rain

Flowing forever I'm
Flowing through storms I am
Flowing eternally
Flowing so lawless but
Flowing impossibly
Flowing through reality
