Look me in the eyes
I'm the clever one
Don't you realize I've uncovered the master plan
I am the advanced
Lone researcher
Right behind your smile I see your fears trying to hide

Underneath the mysteries
Link the dots and you will see

Through the other side
Forces will arise

Arcane, vortex
My trek will take me to the place
Where the tech behind the spells
Falls into my hands

You have questions
I have answers
Everything you know is wrong
So you'll need to unlearn
If you disagree
Then you're against me
Now I understand
You are a pawn under command

Underneath the mysteries
Link the dots and you will see

Arcane, vortex
My trek will take me to the place
Where the tech behind the spells
Falls into my hands

Arcane, vortex
My trek will take me to the place
Where the tech behind the spells
Falls into my hands
