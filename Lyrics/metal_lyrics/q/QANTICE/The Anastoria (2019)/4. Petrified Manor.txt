Friendly blades turned my skin
Into lace of frozen life and empty bliss
Sealing the dam within
Holding back my tears

Fissure veining the glass
Shivers spreading the gash
I'm resigned, there is no end
Pieces will gnash but stand

Alive I'm flayed in a jar
I am soaked in greenish mud drilling my scars
Paralyzed with awe
Death stuck in my craw

Fissure veining the glass
Shivers spreading the gash
I'm resigned, there is no end
Pieces will gnash but stand

Fissure veining the glass
Shivers spreading the gash
Fissure veining the glass
Shivers spreading the gash
Resigned, I'm petrified for good
