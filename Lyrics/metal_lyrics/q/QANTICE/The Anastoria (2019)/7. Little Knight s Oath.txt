Little knight is out on a quest
Shielded from the doubt and the rest
The snickers of the cowards
Belittle what they can't understand

Little knight is out on a quest
Shielded from the doubt for the best
His frailties do not matter
A goal has made him stronger today

Sledging in the silt
Crawling to the crest
I will take the heat
I'm on a quest
I never seek a fight
I honor my foes
For I am a knight and I will keep my oath
For I am a knight and I will keep my oath

From the day you trust yourself
Your demons creep away

Little knight is out on a quest
Shielded from the doubt and the rest
The snickers of the cowards
Belittle what they can't understand
Little knight is out on a quest
Shielded from the doubt for the best

A goal has made him stronger today
