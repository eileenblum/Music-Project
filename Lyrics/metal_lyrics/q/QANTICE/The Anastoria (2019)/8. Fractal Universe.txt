I am all, all in one
Once inside, inside my mind
Don't you mind yourselves, your cells are mine
Mine to serve and die, to make myself survive

You're the link in my chain
Chain of thoughts and thoughts of pain
To expand myself, I'm self-aware
Everywhere I spread the waking nightmare

I am the realm, I am the world
I am the living, the fractal universe

Be my ears and my eyes
As my tears tear up the skies
Showing the unseen, the scenes I missed
Mystify the sea that budded from the mist

I am the realm, I am the world
I am the living, the fractal universe

I am the realm, I am the world
I am the living, the fractal universe
