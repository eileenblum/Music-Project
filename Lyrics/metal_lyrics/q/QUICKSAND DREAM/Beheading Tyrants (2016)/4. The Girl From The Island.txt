Ten years of sorrow and ten years of war
The villages burnt down, the forests are no more
A tyrant king would veil the land in snow and blood and ice
Turn brother against sister, to rule with fear and lies

Winter it came but would never pass
The years would go by, the deep freeze would last
From hunger and suffering a legend was born
A girl from an island would come with the thaw

She was the guardian of the meek
A gentle sorceress, a cunning heroine
She still haunts the powers that be
Saviour princess in our dreams
Hope still springs, we still believe
In the Girl from the Island

Ten years of sorrow and ten years of war
The king's men were sent out with brutality and force
They'd hunt her in the fields and hunt her through the woods
The Girl from the Island was killed as she stood

The Girl from the Island
We still believe
