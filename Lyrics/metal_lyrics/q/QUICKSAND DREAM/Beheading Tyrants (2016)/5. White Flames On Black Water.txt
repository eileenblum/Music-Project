The drowning screams won't leave me be
From lifeless streets, they're pouring down on me

I've failed to see reality
I've failed to serve society
I fell apart before your eyes
Could not afford to live your lies

Pier lights â Reflections on the water
Cold fathom calls, this time I won't falter
I turn around to seek your smile
But no one's there, you're a thousand miles away

Not fit to speak of heart and mind
Not fit to shine among your kind
To leave this land, 'twas not my will
The void seems so much warmer still

White flames on black water
Flickering over me
White flames on black water
Finally I am free
White flames on black water
Flickering over me
White flames on black water
Finally I am free

What did you find beneath the waves?
What answers lay in troubled graves?
You took the step, went out and thus
Your questions will resound in all of us

In all of us
