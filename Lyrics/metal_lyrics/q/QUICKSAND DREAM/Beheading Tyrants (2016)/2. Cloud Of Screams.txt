A black veil hung before you
It hinders you to dream
A web of hands conforms you
Of tyranny it seems

A shadow dances
Beneath your skin
The Necromancer
Conducts a rite
To raise the dead within

In your contorted haven
The poisoned grail shall gleam
The pain is all you crave for
Inside your cloud of screams

How safe the darkness
How fierce the light
You stay inside of
Your comfort zone
A life that holds no life

To these halls of fire
Tempests never reach
My inner cloud gives comfort
The vows I had to breach
Now all lies clear before me
The journey must begin
I can sense the end now
The walls come closing in
