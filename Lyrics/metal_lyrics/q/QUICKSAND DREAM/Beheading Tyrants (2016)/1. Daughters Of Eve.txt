Behind the gates
The priests are summoned
To spill their hate
To seal your fate with false ideals and superstition

They abuse
Then write the laws
They accuse
Then execute the punishment upon your kind

Fathers decide
The curse shall live on for all time
But the bitter tears you shed corrode
The chains are bound to burst

Daughters of Eve
Reach for your swords
The temples shall crumble
The masters must fall

Out of the shadows they rise
To let fire rain over man
Over the earth they must ride
To bring justice upon all lands

Daughters of Eve â Break out of your cages
Daughters of Eve â Defy ancient laws
Daughters of Eve
Reach for your swords

The scriptures tell
You were born of sin
Not of the well
The gates of Hell stand open wide before you

Awake their needs
Awake their lust
On your knees, you have to please
The hunger's theirs and you're to blame

It's such a shame
You've suffered through the ages, all in the father's name
But deep inside the embers glow
It's time to dry your eyes

Fear them in the shadows of the night for soon your time will come ...
