Underneath
Brittle skin
Enduring pain
Best kept within
It is the shadow that bleeds

Washed upon
Hostile shores
A breathless child
Left on the floor
Soon awakes its rage

Left with a choice to perish or to cope
Trading safety for a tiny glimpse of hope

No one's seen
Your shadow bleeds
No one knows
The pain you feel

Beneath the iron hand you've turned the other cheek
A submissive masque to hide the fact that you're not weak

No one's seen
You've sown the seeds
No one knows
Now hatred breeds
