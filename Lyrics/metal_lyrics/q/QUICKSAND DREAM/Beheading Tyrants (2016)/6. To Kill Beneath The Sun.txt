We're divided
And we'll never be as one
Still denying
As we kill beneath the sun

The blood that stain my sleeves
The haunting screams of agony
The bitter taste of victory

It's all a part of me
It's something I don't want to see
It's all a part of me

In denial
We're pretending we can choose
Floods of dire deeds
Sweep us further from the truth

We can never be apart
It is our destiny to fall
And we'll never be as one
Divided â One and all
