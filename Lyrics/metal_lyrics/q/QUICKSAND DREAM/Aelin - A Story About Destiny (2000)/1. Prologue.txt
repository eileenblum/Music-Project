Words from the Mighty One âThe Days are shorter and tomorrow is only a breath away. It is time for you to find a child who can learn to turn darkness into day. You must teach him all there is to know.â

Sorcerer âWhere shall I go? Where can I find the child? If I look to the east I can only see my dreams. If I look to the west my eyes are blinded by reality. If I look to the north I can only see the sea and in the south there are only barren fields.â

The Mighty one spoke âListen to the winds and follow your heart. I will be inside you to guide you in your quest. Now close your eyes and dream away, fly away to Alonvarâ¦â
