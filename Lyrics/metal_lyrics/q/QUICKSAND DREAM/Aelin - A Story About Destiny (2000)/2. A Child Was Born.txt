It was dawn when the sorcerer arrived in Alonvar.
He had heard the wind whisper that a boy was to be born.
And the wind had said
âNow is the time when you should teach a child the powers of old.â

He left his horse upon a hill then went down to the harbour.
There he asked the harbourmaster about the birth.
In a deep voice the man said
âGo to the house where the candles are burning.â

Golden light â A new horizon appeared
Fires burning bright â Ancient powers revelead

He found a house with burning candles in the window.
The time was right so he knocked at the door and went inside.
The sorcerer spoke
âGreetings my friends, I am the sorcerer from the land of eternity.â

Golden light â A new horizon appeared
Fires burning bright â He will guide the people into light
Chosen one â The time had come
A child was born to bring light to the dawn.
