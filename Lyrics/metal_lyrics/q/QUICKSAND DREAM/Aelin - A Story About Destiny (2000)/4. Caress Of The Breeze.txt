When Aelin was twenty years old he had the basic knowledge
of sorcery. The sorcerer was pleased because Aelin had learned
faster than expected. The light of life shown in the house of
wisdom was shining so bright. But something was wrong and
the sorcerer searched beneath his mind for an answer.

Aelin âI donât know why, but I only care for the sea.â
Sorcerer âYou cannot fail me now when you are so close.â

Aelin believed that the sea would purify him from the magic and
sorcery. Another day and night went by and the sorcerer mourned.
But he thought that he could do something to make Aelin understand
that he was the chosen one to be a sorcerer. That it was his destiny.

Aelin âDo you think you can stop me from sailing away?â
Sorcerer âMaybe I cannot do so, but I have plans for something else.â

Wiser and wiser as time marched on.
But Aelinâs love for the sea grew stronger.
He didnât want to have eternal life.
He only wanted to feel the caress of the breeze.
