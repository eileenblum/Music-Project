[I. The light appeared]

Aelin âIâm looking for a man, heâs a sorcerer all dressed in white.
I wonder if you my friend have seen him? He is waiting for me.â

An old man spoke âI think I saw him a few days ago. He rode a snow-
white horse. You must go to the seven hills beyond the forests and plains.â

Now he went to the town and traded his boat for a horse that could carry
him far. He rode one day, he rode one night and finally he saw seven hills
beneath the sky. He rode towards the hills and found the sorcerer sitting by
a warm fire. Aelin sat down on the other side and looked deep into his eyes.

Aelin âI have found myself now, and I am ready to follow you. I can see the true
heart of magic inside of me. But before we continue with the sorcery we must go
to Alonvar. I want to see my parents one more time.â

They looked upon a rising sun that began to bring light to they day.

Sorcerer âThen we must go to The Mighty One where I will teach you
true sorcery. Remember Aelin, that itâs still a long way to go to win the powers
that can keep the light of life shining on our world.â

Before they rode away Aelin took an oath.
âThe light of life will keep shining bright.â

[II. Epilogue â The last journey]

They arrived safely in Alonvar, and went to the house
where Aelin was born. He said goodbye to his parents
forever. He knew that time was short.

Hand in hand they went down to the harbour where their
ship was waiting. Wind in hair and with tear-stained eyes
his parents were left all alone (again).

When they sailed away their ship suddenly rose above the sea.
With the wings of a dream they were carried away by the breeze.

And Aelinâs last words echoed away
as they sailed to The Land Of Eternity.
