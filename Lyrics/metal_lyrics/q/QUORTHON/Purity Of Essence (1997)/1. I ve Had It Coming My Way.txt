Standing on the balcony, trembling like a friggin' leaf
Its freezin' cold I must be mad its 4AM and gettin' really f*ckin' bad

There's an end to everything
Some folks are best at when they sleep
More than can be said 'bout me

This is what I asked for and what I need but there's always a price to pay
For quite sometime I've known for sure I've had it coming my way
Coming my way I've had it coming my way
Coming my way I've had it coming my way

Starring blind into thin air eternity one step from here
Pardon me I must have blown a fuse I'd really like to be excused

There's an end...
This is what I asked for...
Coming my way...
This is what I asked for...
Coming my way...
I've had it coming my way
