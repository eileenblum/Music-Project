I'm not made perfect I don't know everything
From time to time my mind is on the virtual brink
I've had my moments when I've prepared for all
I've even failed to have a woman given my number to call

Some say that life without a little sh*t is no life at all
Is no life at all

Even my pubic hair has got it's share of split ends
I've felt at times that every ounce of me was made from f*ckin' lead
But I have never felt I had to take that easy way out
By putting some damn f*ckin' stotgun to my head

Some say...

Is no life at all
