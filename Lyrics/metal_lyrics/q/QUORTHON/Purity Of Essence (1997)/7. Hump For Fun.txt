Listen I may well I hear what you're sayin'
But you know we're not the bread &amp; butter
Anymore these days everything's changed there's no use in arrangin'
Some kinda thing it's all enough to hump for fun these days

Once upon a time I just can't figure why
I was such a sorry sucker for that never lastin' feel inside
Now we don't talk 'bout if we should stay or walk
We're just f*ckin' now or should I say hump for these days

Now too long ago I was walking out your door
We had parted we had called it a day
Someone else had comed around and we should share your scarce time
And even though you two would not prevail

This has set a new scene there's no use in f*ckin' dreamin'
I'm afraid too much has changed now that we're both free
Why bother to feel why don't we just enjoy the screwing
And keep on to hump for fun these days

One of these days we are gonna have to set the pace
Should we go on pumpin' or say goodbye to the humpin' days
