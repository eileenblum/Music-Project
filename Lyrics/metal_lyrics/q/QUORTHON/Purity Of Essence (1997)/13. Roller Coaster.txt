I was the straw to which you hung on
I came to enlight your silly life as far as I can see
I taught you everything I know
Still you're stupid as before so far as I can see

Life is like a roller coaster hang on pretty tight
Up'n down'n wrong'n right now hang on for your life

I had you sense the major thrill
I elevated you from filth it was there for all to see
I had you accepted I got you right but bet your ass there was
A lot I had to sacrifice and still I hurt and bleed

Life is like...
