Honestly I don't believe I've ever been this weary
My thinking is really tearing my whole inside outside and in
I wish I had the nerve to do just something firm about it
I'm sure I could live without it but now it seems that we begin

To toss an eye exchange a smile from miles apart it seems
And yet it's hard to tell what's really happing from dreams
Is it just that we've both thinking is this stuff for real
And what if in the midst of this all what if some would see

If this real it seems to me to be good ol' infatuation
What if I am wrong and mix the facts with my imagination
Knee deep in this mess no wonder I don't sleep too good at night
Yes still I've never felt more all right

Hey, were you looking my way or was I standing in the way
I'm like a moth hot for the flame I just can't help it

I've been thinking should you accept an invitation
Can't help this fascination and yet if you were here I'd freexe
I count the days 'til I'll see you again and wish you'll be there
And yet if you would come near again I'd get those jelly knees

So we toss an eye exchange a smile but we never move too close
And yet make sure to make it short we want no one to know
Can I help that I am wondering is this for real
Are you thinking much the same as I then you must feel like me
Until the two of us have come to terms with how to act from now on
We are gonna have to walk in quite wide circles 'round each other
Can not wait until the day when you and I decide
What to do 'til then I guess I'll be allright

Hey, were you...
