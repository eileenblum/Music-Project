I stumbled on and almost fell across your moosehead-slippers
The other day sometime ago on the radio
They played that song again it still sounds the same

Outside my window all the rain is pouring down again

The night is still its way past three
Another cup of tea coz I can't sleep
In two hours you'll get out of bed
Chocolate milk with cheese on toasted bread

And outside my window all the rain keeps pouring down again
Washing all the dirt and hurt away so they say
And outside my window all the rain keeps pouring down again
Washing all the dirt and hurt away
Outside my window all the rain keeps pouring down again
I wonder if where you are it is raining just the same
Just the same
