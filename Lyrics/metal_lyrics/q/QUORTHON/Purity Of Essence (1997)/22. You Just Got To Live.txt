As I'm sitting out here basking looking up into the sky
Well, I'm amazed

How it all just hangs together I watch the clouds slowly float fly
Well, ain't it great

So here we are now it's got this far
I trust you're all just fine
Ain't this life and place just great
No wonder we just won't get 'nuff time

But though we know we can't stay

The world will still turn I wish you all the best
No need to return leave the past to rest
You just have to earn it's not to get but to give
And there's one thing I've learned

You just got to live to see the sun go down on everyone
You just got to live to see that gentle smile and feel alive
You just got to live to see the moon arise and the stars in the sky
You just got to live to take the pain sometimes and to leave it all behind

The world still turns...

You just got to live...

The world still turns...

You just got to live
