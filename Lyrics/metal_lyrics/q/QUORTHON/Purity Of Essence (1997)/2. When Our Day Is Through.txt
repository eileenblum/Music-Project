You're running at too great a pace
You're hurrying way too fast these days
I wish there was a way that i could turn back time and then set off a new start
I wish that I could make you understand what really always kept us apart

Baby through the walls would stand
There was enough of cracks to let the rain come in
Maybe that's why I never held your hand
Because it all began where it all begins

You know it was a hard thing to do to forget when I always would see you
It's funny how we always seem to end up hurting someone when our day is through

You're speeding too fast for me now
You're leaving you were always lost somehow
It's like we always seemed to bet on different horses
Arriving as the other one would leave
It's as it our fired fed from different sources
I would be up missing you while you'd sleep

Baby...

You know it was...

You know it was...

And I realise I always seemed to hurt much more than you
