Well, I can still recall the first time that I first laid my eyes on you
I can't believe all the years that have passed since
Or just how little we then knew

But as the ways of fate would have it well in the end we sure did meet
I am a man so high on this feeling I feel like dancing in the streets

I'd hoped you somehow would have always known
Though I know I would let it show
I can't believe this is really happening
Please someone punch me and ask me what day we have today
What day we're having today

I'm sure that I would not reply coz I would not if I was dreaming
Still this feels good to be a lie

Coz when I look deep into your big brown eyes
It's like a flash outta clear blue sky
And then that gentle smile when your eyes meet mine
It's like I loose all sense of time

Oh, how I wished for all these years, how I've longed

How out of place all words will seem at times
It's like we don't need to talk at all
I get off quite allright from just looking into your eyes
From looking into your eyes from just looking into your eyes

It feels like I could surely fly
It happens every time you're near me
This feels so good it must be right

Coz when I look deep...

Oh, how I've wished...

I can't believe I've wished I'd died
That was before that you had called me
This feel so good it must be right

Coz when I look deep...

Oh, how I've wished...
