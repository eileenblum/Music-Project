Higher the boy is swinging
He's watching silently
Madness is all that he can see
He stands alone, solo
Now when my big wide bring ???
He's lost for will to relieve
They built me up, this dreaming
They turn these things that he is needing
Too many fight this one man war

The boy in the bubble
He wants a gun
I bet you didnt know know
For the boy in the bubble
All is very wrong
I bet you didnt know know

The school that he had played in:
This kid is sick beyond belief
This boy did not care to give back just to receive
They trod on him sat hiding
From all of the terror and the scorn
That he was never asked to be born
Destroying his youth and feelings
They tore his trust is no more than leaving
They push this kid way too far

The boy in the bubble
He wants a gun
I bet you didnt know know
For the boy in the bubble
All is very wrong
I bet you didnt know know

In sudden death he somehow
He has got to fight betrayal
