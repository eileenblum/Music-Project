A desperate cry and humanity's lament
There is no-one to see, listen or repent
No guiding paths - only traces in the frost
Never to return - for we are truly lost

Fading away into the crimson dark night
Gone is our star who shone so bright
And all we forgot - our knowledge and all
Even we must dwindle - and then fall

No shed tears, elegies or woes
For our journey to the white meadows
So ends our time in this world - for alas
All things must pass - our lives, the hourglass
