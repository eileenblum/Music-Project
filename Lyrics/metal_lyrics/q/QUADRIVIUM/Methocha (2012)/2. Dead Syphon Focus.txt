The spiritually dead species
We hold you in great envy
The drums are calling us
We cannot resist

A grand design, our finest creation
We created you, gave you life
But we cannot control you
Cannot wield you

Please don't lead us
Into an even greater darkness
Awaiting the fast rising moon
Calling for the great march

Do not speak of him
Never take his shape
Never assume his form
A statue of derision in art

His cause is not yours
We are for him a special cause
Ignorant, deceptive
We are

You disappear from view
What madness is this
A disturbing pale space
A shore for dead thoughts

Who dare create such a thing
No mind no spirit no heart
Can imagine such a place
Such a sense of abhorrence and awe
