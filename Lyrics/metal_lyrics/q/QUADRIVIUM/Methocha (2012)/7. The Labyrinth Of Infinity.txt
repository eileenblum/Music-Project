The demon sheds his skin
His star does not dwindle
A menace to graceful amity
A Rasputin murder legend

Cascades of venomous doctrines
The poison complex dissolves
Rise up and renounce
A collapsed and dying star

Bereft of all coherence
Affixed to disgraced icons
Convicted to dwell within
Blizzards of the insufferable

Limbo hath no agony
Like the void
Of sub-mortal existence
Aeternum

Our spirits collapsed
The elements recombined
Into a titanic pulse
Of energy

For our sun
To implode into dusk
And from the ruins
The blackbird arise

Before infinite justice appear
And our species defend
To have gone in circles
In the labyrinth of infinity

Yet again
