A most depraved and vicious tongue
Misfortune finds him in eternal loops
A true cynic a bona fide misanthrope
There is no reward, salvation nor hope

The integrity and conscience of man
A torment placed upon him by himself
Let his bells of truth and wisdom chime
His words will echo in the dark hall of time

His eyes smile while his soul howls
He is for whom the clock ticks
He is for whom the world turns around
Send in the jester, send in the clown
