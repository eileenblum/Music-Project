From that moment until now
I feel drained and weary
Disheartened with no sense of purpose
Blackened eyes, I can see clearly

Flowing through all ages
For not to be there ever again
Shards of an experiment failed
Desperate tears now, moments of zen

A ripple in the endless silver sea
An image of my soul's reflection
Such an unpleasant and painful truth
It was a sham, my on projection

Abnormal like a Phobos Anomaly
On ever-changing paths seeking a cure
Though I thought it would change
The world became distant, reality obscure

Cast adrift into the soul sphere
Winds of time lifts me ever higher
Towards the spark that ignited it all
It stares into darkness, breathing fire

A burst of thunder in the skies
To herald the end of my era
One last grand marvelous homage
To this, an existence ephemera

My time here is over now
Enter the hall of Eidolon Ultimate
I hoped it would not be like this
It is all shrouded, and infinite
