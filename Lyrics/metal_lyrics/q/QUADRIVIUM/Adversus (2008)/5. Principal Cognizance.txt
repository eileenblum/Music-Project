Does he guide the ones that are astrayDoes he offer peace for those who pray Does he walk with those in the shadeDoes he tend to the light that now shall fade Does he walk with those in the shade I, the itinerant mentorOffer guidance and reliefFor you who meander throughThis labyrinth that is life I, the glow of the sunHurls the vapor awayThe mist that makesThe night even darker His shade that makes you all shiverThe freezing cold of his stare For you who knew nothing but fearThere is nothing for you in here On this cold northern winter nightOn the winter plains so whiteYou reach out with your frostbit handsFeel your mind transcend Out of this world I, the voice in the windsHear me roar through the woods I, the storm that crush the giantsThe storm that leave the small standing
