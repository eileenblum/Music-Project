I, the ancient philosopherHas laid his hands on your shouldersI welcome you, the tired and misunderstoodRelease yourself from this hell that is all your own Fear not fire or brimstoneFear idle hands and mindsFear not phantoms or wraithsFear the plains that shine Mirrors your heart End this harping of the same old chordsTorment awaits for those who linger in the pastReverence is the virtue of the damned End this journey in his fieldHis permeating cold fieldLift the mist from of your mindsSurrender to the domain of the soul End your existence in this realmCease to be the object of ridicule I, the ancient philosopherHas laid his hands on your shouldersI welcome you, the tired and misunderstoodRelease yourself from this hell that is all your own
