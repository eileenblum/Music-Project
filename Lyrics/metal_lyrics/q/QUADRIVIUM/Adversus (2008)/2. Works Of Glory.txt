Roam in the domains sublimeExplore the mysteries of conceptionGaze upon the mesmerizing hollowAbsurd as anything you ever saw Smell the organic, divine vapoursLike euphoria it feelsTaste the stream of forces Touch the walls of higher dimensionsLike glass it rings Listen to its eerie harmoniesLike sirens it sound Watch the flow of timeLike water it flowsFeel your ties to the elements Like an entity divine Leave this self-imposed abattoirFree from torment and derisionBe held in acclaimLike water it purges Hear my call to youCast away your twisted chainsSoar on your phoenix wingsTake my outstretched hand
