Stare into the white eyes
Thrust yourself into the field
Permeate through space and time
Tear the almighty strings

Welcome to the endless void
An existence defined not by pain
Symmetric in all its shades of grey
Ruled by the sovereign ghost

The soul he bestowed upon you
Adhered into a single abstract
Of the hate you all nurtured inside
Merely a faint memory now

You are all but ancient beings now
The storm has settled now

Feel no obligation to be concerned
Fear not what has become of home
The syntrophism between mankind
And the old man is severed now

Contemplate while you fade away
Did he act like a redeemer

Lost in the endless void
