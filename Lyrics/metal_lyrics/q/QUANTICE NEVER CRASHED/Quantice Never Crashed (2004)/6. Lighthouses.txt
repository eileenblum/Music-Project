The ties that bind can gag and I'm bound by boundless insignificance.
Set yourself on fire if you can't feel this burn.
Did you run out of ink so soon?
Let my roots be my guide - and my heart as my eyes.
This light will lead you home.
There's not enough apathy in my soul: my heart refuses to grow cold.
Just remember - you could fake this feeling forever.
Nothing is sacred where hearts aren't beating
(Where is your spine?)...
If my dreams must die, let them die in me,
For the sake of understanding what I could not see.
For what I'll never say, for what I'll never be: this was never for you, it was always for me.
You'll never see: We're just flesh after all.
