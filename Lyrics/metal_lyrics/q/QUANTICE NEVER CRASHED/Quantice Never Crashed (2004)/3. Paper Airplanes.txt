Where do we go from failure? There's no way but up from here.
Your morals can't help me now.
This time, there's no room for dissonance.
Why do we ask what we already know? - Just to hear when something is real.
(The question:) What if things change when and why? Who first, who's left behind?
("It's nice to know when something is real.")
Ask: Where do we go from failure? There's nowhere but up from here.
This time, there's no room for dissonance.
You are only worth what your heart is willing, so tell me, are you willing?
This lesson's learned: to have retrospect.
And "c'est la vie"- I can't accept.
It's safe to say your valor was more of a pose.
And it's safe to say that if it was said, then it was meant to be said.
What if things change? When and why?
Who goes first?
Who's left behind?
"C'est la vie" won't change a thing.
