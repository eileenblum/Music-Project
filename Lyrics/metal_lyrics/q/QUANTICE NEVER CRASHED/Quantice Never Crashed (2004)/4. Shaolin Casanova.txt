Fuck you.
I want to know how it feels that I'm the best you could ever have,
So tell me when you lose your nerve.
So what'd you go looking for and why?
How long did it take before you stopped?
Don't worry.
It suits you just fine.
You would think after all this time
Your taste would have lifted from my lips
And I would forget your eyes were out for gold and all the rest.
And I won't forgive - because I can't forget the weight I carry in my chest.
I'm far too far from giving up - I swear.
I swear.
My wishes remain the same: for steady hands to be held.
Hands to hold, and to be held.
But what's left to heal?
What's left of me?
You'll get what you deserve - and when the time is right,
you'll see it's funny how little it takes for you to become everything you say you hate.
But don't worry.
It suits you just fine.
When you're out of sight - you'll be out of mind.
Just like you showed me.
I'll never admit how hard I fell.
(So close, but not this time.)
So after all this time, what can you say for yourself?
You fell so far, and for what?
You took more than time.
(I'll never be this sick again.
You have to know this is tearing me apart.)
You took more than time.
You know damn well I wasn't ready for this.
