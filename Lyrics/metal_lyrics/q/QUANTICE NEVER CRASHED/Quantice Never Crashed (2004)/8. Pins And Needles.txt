Picture a parade of mannequins: ivory white.
Straight black ties to harden crooked spines: single file.
Holes for eyes as useless as 2000 yrs of evolution.
We have no ears.
We have no eyes (to see what's in front of us.)
It's a new plateau of cost-efficient living.
There's no funding for free will and we're not budging.
And no one cares.
No one listens.
Plastered between nine and five there is a pulse that ticks in time -
It's neutral and it's centralized.
We found it safer inside the lines.
And no one cares.
No one listens.
