I've built walls around me.
I've surrounded myself with everything that's gotten me here.
But I'm tired of apologizing, and I'm tired of running from the things that I can't hide from.
It's hard to believe in yourself,
And it's hard to believe anything
But I've learned forgiveness, and I've learned sincerity.
"Burn a bridge or be left behind.
Spread your wings and be proud of who you are."
And I've burned bigger bridges than you.
I'm not afraid to let go this time.
It's hard to believe good intentions, but I'm not afraid -
I'm looking for something I don't know how to ask for.
"Spread your wings and be proud of who you are.
You choose what you carry with you."
And I've burned bigger bridges than you.
I've built walls around me.
I've moved on from everything that's gotten me here.
"The end justifies the means."
I've left you behind.
I know you've been waiting for the right chance to stick this knife in my back.
This chance is mine.
I've left you behind.
This is the last time you will make me painfully aware of how humiliated these open arms
I've held for you have made me.
