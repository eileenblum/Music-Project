You made a list today of all the things I could never be and you said
"Try living with this, its all yours, its all yours."
Please don't make this harder than it already has to be,
Let's just turn our backs on ourselves and the things that we've made.
And no, I've never seen myself like this before.
Maybe it scares me too - to know that different things take different times to fall apart,
But they always do.
(They always do.)
I made a promise to myself that I wouldn't miss you.
I know why I left and why I'm never coming back.
I promised myself that I wouldn't miss you.
Please don't make this harder than it already has to be -
Let's just turn our backs on ourselves and the things that we've made.
And no I've never seen myself like this before and maybe it scares me too -
To know us, to know me, to know that this is where.
This is the part where we say goodbye and walk away.
This is where we say goodbye and walk away.
