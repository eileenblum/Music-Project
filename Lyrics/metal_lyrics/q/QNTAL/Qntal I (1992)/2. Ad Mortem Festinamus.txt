Scribere proposui de contemptu mundano
Ut degentes seculi non mulcentur in vano
Iam est hora surgere
A sompno mortis pravo
A sompno mortis pravo

Vita brevis breviter in brevi finietur
Mors venit velociter quae neminem veretur
Omnia mors perimit
Et nulli miseretur
Et nulli miseretur.

Ad mortem festinamus
Peccare desistamus
Peccare desistamus.

Ni conversus fueris et sicut puer factus
Et vitam mutaveris in meliores actus
Intrare non poteris
Regnum Dei beatus
Regnum Dei beatus.

Tuba cum sonuerit dies erit extrema
Et iudex advenerit vocabit sempiterna
Electos in patria
Prescitos ad inferna
Prescitos ad inferna.

Ad mortem festinamus ...

[English translation:]

I set out to write about world's contempt,
So that those who live in this century won't rejoice in vain
It's time to rise
From the evil slumber of death
From the evil slumber of death

The short life will shortly be over
Death comes swift and respects nobody
Death annihilates everyone
And has mercy for none
And has mercy for none

We are approaching death
Let us stop our sinning
Let us stop our sinning

If you shall not convert and become as a child
And not change your life committing better acts
You will not be able to enter
Into God's blessed reign
Into God's blessed reign

When the trumpet will sound and will be the ultimate day
And the judge will come, he will call for eternity
The elect in motherland
And the predestined in hell
And the predestined in hell

[Note: By motherland it most likely refers to humanity's motherland, which is Paradise]
