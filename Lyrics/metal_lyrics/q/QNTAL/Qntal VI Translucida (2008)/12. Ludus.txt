[Limited Edition Track][Lyrics: Carmina Burana]

Erat arbor hec in prato
Quovis flore picturato

Herba, fonte, situ grato,
Sed et umbra, flatu dato.
Stilo non pinxisset Plato
Loca gratiora.

Hic dum placet delectari
Delectatque iocundari

Et ab estu relevari,
Cerno forma singulari
Pastorellam sine pari
Colligentem mora.

Estivali sub fervore,
Quando cuncta sunt in flore,
Totus eram in ardore.
Sub olive me decore,
Estu fessum et sudore,
Detinebat mora.

Que respondit verbo brevit:
âludos viri non assuevi.

Sunt parentes michi sevi
Mater longioris evi.
Irascetur pro re levi.
Parce nunc in hora!â

Subest fons vivacis vene,
Adest cantus philomene
Naiadumque cantilene,
Paradisus hic est pene,
Non sunt loca, scio plene,
His iocundiora.

In amorem vise cedo,
Fecit Venus hoc, ut credo.
âades!â inquam ânon sum predo,
Nichil tollo, nichil ledo,
Me meaque tibi dedo,
Pulchrior quam Flora!â

[English translation:]

In the summer heat,
when everything is blooming,
I was feeling all hot.
Under the beauty of an olive,
heat, sweat and fatigue,
drove me to take a break.

That tree was in a meadow,
adorned by all kinds of flowers,
the grass, a fountain - a marvellous place,
being there breeze and shadows too.
Plato, with his stylus, could't have painted
a more pleasant place than this.

Down was the source of the lively torrents,
you could hear the singing of Philomena,
and the chant of the Naiads.
I felt in paradise,
there are no places, this I'm certain,
merrier than this one.

While delighted by the bliss,
enjoying my delight,
recovering from my fatigue,
I notice a shepherdess, one of a kind,
gathering blackberries.

I fall in love at first sight,
Venus made her, I believe.
"Come!", I say, "I'm not a thief,
nothing I steal, nothing I hurt.
I give all myself to you,
who are more beautiful than Flora!"

She answers briefly:
"I'm not used to men's games,
my parents are stern,
my mother is very old,
she is angered by the mildest things.
Now back off!"
