[R. Pierce / J. K. / F. Rose]

Lately I've been thinkin' about my life
Tryin' to figure out what I could do
I was born without a father, lived without my mother
I had no desire for the silver spoon
But like so many of the others
Living under cover
There's only one thing that I really want to do

I wanna rock on, rock on!
I'm gonna get my chance tonight!
I wanna rock on, rock on!
I wanna rock till the day I die!

Someday you will look up here
See me on the stage and say
Hey, I used to know that guy!
I wonder if he remembers tellin' me that one day
His name would be up in the lights
But like so many of the others
Living under cover
There's only one thing that I really want to do

I wanna rock on, rock on!
I'm gonna get my chance tonight!
I wanna rock on, rock on!
I wanna rock till the day I die!

wanna rock on, rock on!
I'm gonna get my chance tonight!
I wanna rock on, rock on!
I wanna rock till the day I die!
