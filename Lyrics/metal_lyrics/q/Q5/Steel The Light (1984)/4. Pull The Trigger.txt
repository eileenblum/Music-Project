[F. Rose / J. K.]

Get ready to meet your maker
Make a date with the undertaker
You got your money, now let's get some action
No mistakes, you're a trained assassin

Loaded guns got you in his sight
Pulls the trigger, he's cold as ice

Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger

You realize that there's no one like him
Steely eyes in the darkness coming
He's got a secret and a reputation
His only goal is your termination

Loaded guns got you in his sight
Pulls the trigger, he's cold as ice

Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger

Gun is hot with a killing fire
No other game can take him higher
Steady now there'll be no exception
He's your guide to the last reception

Loaded guns got you in his sight
Pulls the trigger, he's cold as ice

Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger
Pull the trigger

Shoot!
Shoot!
