[F. Rose / J. K.]

She was just sixteen, she was so sweet and clean
She walked like she knew where she's been
She set my blood on fire, I said are you for hire?
That's when she turned on me and screamed

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a lady

She had a southern smile and a New York style
I couldn't let her get away
She was the girl of my dreams because I was mean
I had to listen to her say

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a lady

I had to have her bad, but she'd left me mad
That ain't the way it should be
I'm gonna find that girl, take her around the world
I'm gonna love her till she she screams

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a lady

Don't tell me what to do!

That ain't no way to treat a lady
That ain't no way to treat a lady

To treat a lady, to treat a lady, to treat a lady
