[F. Rose / J. K. / E. Sheeley]

Fallen angels and fallen dreams
Pay the price of mystery
The gods declared that man lived by night
And never shall they see the light

But in the heart of one deemed pure
Came the challenge of the fight
To return the days of gold
He must try to steal the light

Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Turning darkness into light

The gods have hidden well the golden sun
Inside the lands of the evil one
He walked the maze of the endless blight
Passed empty rooms where sirens cried

Close at hand his destiny
He feels the power of the light
And as the shadow falls on him
Draws his blade to face the night

Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Turning darkness into light

Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Turning darkness into light

The clash of steel was heard across the seas
Like no time in history
The dark one blinded by the sword of light
The final blow did take his life

Walked in silence to the golden door
Threw it open to the night
There in his hands our hopes and dreams
That this day would steel the light

Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Steel the light!
Turning darkness into light

Turning darkness into light
Take the darkness from our lives
Turn the darkness into light
