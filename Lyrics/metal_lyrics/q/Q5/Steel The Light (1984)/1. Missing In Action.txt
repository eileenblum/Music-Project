[R. Pierce / J. K. / F. Rose / F. Morisette]

Well he lost his mind behind enemy lines,
Always running, always under fire
Taken prisoner in a land of dreams
That was a nightmare in disguise
Never been so scared, so filled with pain,
His life passed before his eyes
No one thought that he would be the one
To surrender to all their lies

That's why you're

Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you go
(You're) Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you be
Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you go, no
Missing in action
Don't you know that I will never let you go

He was taken by surprise, he was paralyzed,
Losing all his will to live
He told them all everything he knew,
Till there was nothing more left to give
Locked alone in an empty room,
His plans are finally made
In the glaring light of a single flame,
Reality begins to fade

That's why you're

Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you go
(You're) Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you be
Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you go, no
Missing in action
Don't you know that I will never let you go

The kiss of death lingers on his lips,
He's headed for an early grave
Cause the end of a needle and a rusty spoon
Are the only life he has to crave
I can see he's a casualty
Of a freedom that's never free
He's a missing person in a sea of dreams,
Dreams not meant to be

That's why you're

Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you go
(You're) Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you be
Missing in action
Don't you know that I won't let you go, no
Missing in action
Don't you know that I will never let you go
