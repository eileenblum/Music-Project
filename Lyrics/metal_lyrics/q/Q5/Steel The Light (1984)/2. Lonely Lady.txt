[F. Rose / J. K.]

This is the challenge of a lifetime - lifetime
I saw her standing in the cold - twilight

She's never been in love
She always gave it all away
Lonely lady, lonely lady,
Lady on my mind

This is no ordinary love affair - love affair
Her memories she tries to hide - inside of her

She's never been in love
She always gave it all away
Lonely lady, lonely lady,
Lady on my mind

I give her everything and all my love - all my love
This is a perfect chance to show - all of them

She's never been in love
She always gave it all away
Lonely lady, lonely lady,
Lady on my mind
