I got a hunger, a feeling that can't be fed
For the good looks and the charms of a woman
A woman dressed in red
My body hurts, my heart it aches
My hands a quiver, my knees start to shake
If she's feeling nasty I've got good news
She's not alone just stand in my shoes

Nothing ventured - nothing gained
Nothing ventured - nothing gained

When I needed money, they told me go find a job
So I gave it a try, worked all day like a dog
My body hurts, my heart it aches
My hands a quiver, my knees start to shake
When I walk out, I never go back
If that makes you sorry, just stop in your tracks

Nothing ventured - nothing gained
Nothing ventured - nothing gained

Nothing ventured - nothing gained
Nothing ventured - nothing gained

I had a friend, his head always in the sky
One day he said to me, c'mon and give this stuff a try
My body hurts, my heart it aches
My hands a quiver, my knees start to shake
That stuff hit me so bad, I'll never be the same
But what does it matter cause I'm always game

Nothing ventured - nothing gained
Nothing ventured - nothing gained
