You may be proud, so sentimental
You think too hard but the answer's simple
Got what I'm askin', I got the feelin'
I got to know now, body you must decide

Cause I'm waiting, waiting for your love
Cause I'm waiting, waiting for your love

When the time comes, I hope you're ready
Make your mind up, try not to cry
I'll take it easy, I'll make you feel it
When you know there can be no compromise

Cause I'm waiting, waiting for your love
Cause I'm waiting, waiting for your love

I've made my mind up
I'm gonna have you
Cause I don't care what your best friend will say
You're what I need to set my life free
You know what it takes to make me stay

Cause I'm waiting, waiting for your love
Cause I'm waiting, waiting for your love
