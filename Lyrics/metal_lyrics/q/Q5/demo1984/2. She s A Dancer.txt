Now here's a story about a lady
You know she's one of a kind
She works a nightclub in the city
But she doesn't really seem to mind

She makes me hot when she takes it off
She's a dancer, midnight romancer
Yeah, she'll steal your heart when she takes it off
She's a dancer, midnight romancer
She's a dancer, midnight romancer

She'll take your money because she needs to
But she wants to be a star of the screen
I've seen her leaving with all her lovers
To her it's just the same old thing

She makes me hot when she takes it off
She's a dancer, midnight romancer
Yeah, she'll steal your heart when she takes it off
She's a dancer, midnight romancer
She's a dancer, midnight romancer

So that's the story about the lady
Who does it for me night till dawn
She makes you love her like no other
You know you're gonna miss her when she's gone

She makes me hot when she takes it off
She's a dancer, midnight romancer
Yeah, she'll steal your heart when she takes it off
She's a dancer, midnight romancer
She's a dancer, midnight romancer
