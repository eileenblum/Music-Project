When the mirror cracks
guess whoâs really looking back at you
What an abomination
Donât you people know your race is through

[Chorus:]
How can we survive
when everything you hear is just a lie
How can we survive
when everything youâre telling us is lies

Does your blood run cold when thinking
that someday you will be old
Faster than the speed of light
those images that run our lives are told

[Chorus]

No one knows who runs the show
We donât have time we got to goâ¦ goodbye
Following the masterâs voice leading us
to make the choicesâ¦ lies

[Chorus]
