It never made any difference
I can see what you do to me
I was so empty in love with you.

You always said that you love me
But the words couldnât mean that much
I only know the way you treated me.

[Chorus:]
Livinâ on the borderline,
Livinâ on the borderline with you.
Livinâ on the borderline,
Livinâ on the borderline with you.

You got yourself a new image
And parade it so gallantly
I really tried but didnât understand.

Now it seems much better
If I just turn and walk away
Thereâs no reason to go on and on.

[Chorus]

There always was something
Always was something that got in my way
When I felt your love I never knew
If it was night or day.

There always was something
Something that got in my way
I looked in the mirror and didnât know
If it was night or day.

You never had any reason
For the way you led me to believe
You would always be in love with me.

Now it seems much better
If I just turn and walk away
Iâll always know just what you meant to me.

[Chorus]
