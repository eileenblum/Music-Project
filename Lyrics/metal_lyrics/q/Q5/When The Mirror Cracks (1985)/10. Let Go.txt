In the darkest hour, tangled with despair
I looked around and I was dreaming
I walk the border of the other side
And all the time a heard a screaming

[Chorus:]
Let goâ¦ let go!
If you want to get back to the place
you were atâ¦ let go!
Let goâ¦ let go!
If you tear at your heart
It will rip you apartâ¦ let go!

And in the mirror I saw a shining light
It beckoned me with distant hunger
A rage thatâs burning consumed by itself
I couldnât stop it now or ever.

[Chorus:]
Let goâ¦ let go!
If you want to get back to the place
you were atâ¦ let go!
Let goâ¦ let go!
Well he laughs at your pain
Youâve got nothing to gainâ¦ let go!

And when I woke up I had a gun in my hand
I just canât do it
I want this dream to end

[Chorus:]
Let goâ¦ let go!
If you want to get back to the place
you were atâ¦ let go!
Let goâ¦ let go!
If you tear at your heart
It will rip you apartâ¦ let go!
