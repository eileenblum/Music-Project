Thoughts about our love have sent me
Higher than Iâve ever been before
Can you feel it baby ?
Doesnât matter where you are
Iâve got to have you more and more with me
Think about it baby

[Chorus:]
I want you to stand by me
Together we can make it happen
Stand by me
Cause only in your arms I feel it
Think about our life of loveâ¦ Oh God
Iâve got to have you stand by me

When a shadow passes by
Remember all the lies youâve heard before
Listen to me baby
I wonât try to change you cause I love you
and what you give to me
Can you feel it baby ?

[Chorus]
