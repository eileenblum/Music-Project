Neon lights, line the clouds that haunt your dreams
All alone, steppinâ out onto the streets
Motherâs call, babyâs gone and canât be found
Comes the night, thatâs the time it hurts the most

Oh, Runawayâ¦ you canât hide from the night
Runaway, everybody wants to fight your love

Memories, of a family somewhere crying
Carry on, while inside emotions dying
Children lost, fantasies of days gone by
Runaway, whereâs the love you want to find

Runawayâ¦ memories have grown so cold
Runawayâ¦ frozen in a heart that feels no love
