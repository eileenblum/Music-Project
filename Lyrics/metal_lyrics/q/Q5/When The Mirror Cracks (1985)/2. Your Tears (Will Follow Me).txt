Opening the letter you sent to me
I found a teardrop framed to see
You asked me how am I now
And could I find a way
To come and see you
Just for a day, for a day

[Chorus:]
Your tears will follow me
And they fall like rain
Your tears will follow me
Theyâre like rain from your heart

Our time was a heaven
A dream undisturbed
By waves of reality
We couldnât share
But you were my lover
And I was your friend
Ooh we had it that sweet innocence
In a senseâ¦

[Chorus]
