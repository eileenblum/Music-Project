Secret shadows, watch them shimmer
Soft reflections in your eyes

Will you see me ?
Will you touch me ?
In the rain.

Restless feelings as I watch you
Try to hold them deep inside

Will you love me ?
Will you hold me ?
Why canât you tell me if you want me
In the rain.

Touching softly in the darkness
Your lips tasting passions rise

Will you love me ?
Will you leave me ?
In the rain.

Secret shadows, still reflections
Drawing me into your eyes

Will you love me ?
Will you leave me ?
Why canât you tell me if you want me
In the rain, in the rain.

Breathless waiting, as I wonder
Tasting passions, kiss goodbye

Will you love me ?
Will you leave me ?
In the rain, in the rain.

Will you love me ?
Will you leave me ?
Why canât you tell me if you want me
In the rain, in the rain.
