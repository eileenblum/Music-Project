Is there any reason
Is there any chance
Is there anybody
Isnât there a dance

Why do I feel so helpless ?
What is there left for me ?

[Chorus:]
Iâm never gonna love again
Iâm never gonna love again

Isnât there a proverb
Isnât there a rhyme
Everything is gone now
Thereâs no reason why

Why do I feel so helpless ?
What is there left for me ?

[Chorus]

I canât hear the birds sing
I canât see the sky
Isnât there somebody
Someone who still cries

Why do I feel so helpless ?
What is there left for me ?

[Chorus]
