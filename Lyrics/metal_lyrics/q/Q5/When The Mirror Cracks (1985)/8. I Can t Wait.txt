Late at night, feeling so right,
all my senses exploding inside
Drivinâ home, feeling so lowâ¦
I canât take it much longer alone
I need you so bad, Iâve just got to haveâ¦
thoughts of you feed my desire
I want to believe when you say that
you needâ¦ Soon Iâll be inside of youâ¦

[Chorus:]
Well I canât wait
I canât take it
Got to hold you
I canât wait
I canât take it
Got to hold you

You and me passions freeâ¦
heat running down your sweet skin
Fantasies rage inside a cage
that quivers as Iâm cominâ in
Donât take it away, I love how we play
on each otherâs emotions in tune
I need you so bad itâs drivinâ me mad
Iâve just got to make love to you

[Chorus]

Hold on to me Iâve come to see the
tenderness locked inside you
Just one more timeâ¦ give me a sign so
I know that youâre feeling it too
I wonât let go lovinâ you so,
we only live for each other
I need you so bad itâs drivinâ me mad
Iâve just got to make love to you

[Chorus]
