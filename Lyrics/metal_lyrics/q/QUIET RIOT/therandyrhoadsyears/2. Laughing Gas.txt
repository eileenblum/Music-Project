[Rhoads, DuBrow]
[Previously unreleased]

Stay alive, just laugh the time away
You'll survive, do what you do your way

Burn the fire like a flame and knock 'em out in a hot flash
They'll all think that you're insane, it's just a laughing gas

Bombs away, they won't do you no harm
Help me babe, I have ..... of your charm
