[Rhoads]
[Originally from: Quiet Riot (Japan Only)]

You'd better beware
He'll catch you when you're unaware
Look out, he's gonna stare
Catch him, he won't care

Look in any window
Hold yourself back
He's gonna look in any window
It's a visual attack

He's spying he's thinkin'
He's craving for sin
Open up your window
Go on and let him in

Look in any window
Hold yourself back
He's gonna look in any window
It's a visual attack, that's what it is

What a desire
His mind is on fire
He sweats and he pants
The love he can't have

Look in any window
Hold yourself back
He's gonna look in any window
It's a visual attack

A collection of early songs by Quiet Riot (late 1970's), featuring Randy Rhoads on guitar before he moved on to play for Ozzy.

"Afterglow (Of Your Love)" is an unreleased acoustic version.
"Picking Up the Pieces," "Breaking Up Is a Heartache," and "Force of Habit" are all unreleased tracks, with "Force of Habit" being the earliest available Quiet Riot recording.
"Laughing Gas" is a live guitar solo that was never recorded in the studio because Rhoads kept changing it.
All tracks not mentioned in this paragraph are the original album versions.
