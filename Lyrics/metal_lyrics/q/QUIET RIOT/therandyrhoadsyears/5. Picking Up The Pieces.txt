[Previously unreleased]

Take cover, young lovers,
fall apart at the seams
It's stainless steel, that's how I feel,
you're the girl of my dreams

Well I tried to call you on the phone,
your dad said that you weren't at home

But we are, picking up the pieces of our lovin'
over and over again
Picking up the pieces let's do it again
We're picking up the pieces,
picking up the pieces of our love

Well, I need your lovin'
to show me what I am
And I want your body
to make me feel like a man

You know that I'm down on my knees,
you know it's you that I want to please, please

Picking up the pieces of our lovin'
over and over again
Picking up the pieces let's do it again
We're picking up the pieces,
picking up the pieces of our love
