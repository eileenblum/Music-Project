Love is all around me everywhere
Love has come to touch my soul
With someone who really cares
No one can deny us
People who once passed me by
Will turn their heads 'round

I'm happy just to be with you,
And lovin' you the way I do
'Cause everything I need to know,
Just resting in the afterglow of your love

You, as you have always been here
A feeling deep inside
A feeling that I could not see or touch
Or try to hide

My love is in and around you
I bless the day that I found you
So listen baby

I'm happy just to be with you,
And lovin' you the way I do
'Cause everything I need to know,
Just resting in the afterglow of your love

Love is like a voice in my head
Keeps turning around the things we've said

I'm happy just to be with you,
And lovin' you the way I do
'Cause everything I need to know,
Just resting in the afterglow of your love
