The chicks in the town been runnin' around
On the loose
Legs they'll spread for free or for bread
On the loose
Can't get enough to satisfy their lust
On the loose

Killer girls waitin' in line for me
Blood thirsty, get home in time for tea
Killer girls for all you boys to see
Easy action, get what you want for free

Never ease up, got a stick shift disease
Turn me loose
Hypnotized when they give me the eye
Turn me loose
In their disguise I see murder and lies
Turn me loose

Killer girls waitin' in line for me
Blood thirsty, get home in time for tea
Killer girls for all you boys to see
Easy action, get what you want for free

Killer girls in a frenzy on me
No more juice
Take my advice, you'd better think twice
No more juice
They'll hump and bump you, forget your name
No more juice

Killer girls waitin' in line for me
Blood thirsty, get home in time for tea
Killer girls for all you boys to see
Easy action, get what you want for free
