Walking 'round the town with nothing to do
Rock-n-roll ringin' in my ears
Work just 'til nine I'm singin' the blues
Got to find a way out of here

It's not so funny
Just a kid, nobody listens to me
Ain't got the money to do what I want
Something's got to set me free

You say when you grow up you'll have what you want
And everything that you need
What is the use of having it all
If you listen and never be seen

It's not so funny
Just a kid, nobody listens to me
Ain't got the money to do what I want
Something's got to set me free

If I could suddenly be older
I'd show them all and bring them down to my size

My parents tell me you're not the only one
There's a lot of kids around like you
If all of us kids got together for fun
We'd show you a thing or two
No no no

It's not so funny
Just a kid, nobody listens to me
Ain't got the money to do what I want
Something's got to set me free
It's not so funny
I ain't got no money
It's not so funny
I ain't got no money
It's not so funny
I ain't got no money...
