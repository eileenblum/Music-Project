I got a letter in the mail sayin' that I'm gonna go to jail
Someone's got an axe, lookin' out for me
I was feelin' pretty nice didn't have to think twice
Finders keepers, baby, keep it away from me

You're gettin' me in trouble
Gettin' me in trouble
Gettin' me in trouble
Every day and night
I'm all right

Well I'm a high speed king I never think about a thing
Now all I can do is moan, Oh no
Everybody takes their turn from the trash I have learned

You're getting' me in trouble
Gettin' me in trouble
Gettin' me in trouble
Every day and night
I'm all right

You try to put the weight of the world on top of my shoulders
You got to know that you're a little girl who wants to feel older, feel older
Trouble, trouble, I'm in trouble baby
You're gettin' me in trouble

Gettin' me in trouble
Gettin' me in trouble
Every day and night

Nothin' I can say and nothin' I can do
Will get me off the road that leads to you

I'm in trouble, trouble, trouble
I'm in trouble, trouble, trouble
I'm in trouble, trouble, trouble
