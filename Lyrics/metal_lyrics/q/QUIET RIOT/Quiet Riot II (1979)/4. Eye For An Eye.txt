You turned me over now I'll turn you around 
Mistakes are made, foul play 
You have givin' is what I found 
You'll be my queen for a day 
I'm no matinee idol 
You put it in the wrong way 
If I was Valentino 
It'd been the same 

It's like an eye for an eye 
Give me some proof 
Speak up now or it's a tooth for a tooth 
An eye for an eye 
Give me some proof 
Time is runnin' out on you 

Watcha gonna do? 

No need to smile while I make my advance 
But please don't turn away 
Your reputation got me into your pants 
But you weren't that great 
Well now you turned the tables 
It's the other way 
I've got my revenge baby 
And you want to stay 

It's like an eye for an eye 
Give me some proof 
Speak up now or it's a tooth for a tooth 
An eye for an eye 
Give me some proof 
Time is runnin' out on you 

Watcha gonna do? 

It's like an eye for an eye 
Give me some proof 
Speak up now or it's a tooth for a tooth 
An eye for an eye 
Give me some proof 
Time is runnin' out on you 

Watcha gonna do? 
Watcha gonna do? 
Watcha gonna do? 
Watcha gonna do? 
Watcha gonna do? 
Watcha gonna do? 
Watcha gonna do?
