Now I've got a chick who will be with me 
Anytime, day or night 
But I won't put up with no runnin' around 
You know it just ain't right 
I'm going down... 
To the town - 
Out to go drink with the clowns 
You stay at home... 
All alone - 
And don't you talk on the phone 

You're comin' face to face with the guy that's gonna knock you dead 
Face to face with the guy that's gonna bust your head 
I'm gonna knock you on the floor 
You'll beg me for no more 
You're comin' face to face with me, like it or not 

When I got to town 
The words going 'round 
That you've been seen on your back 
I open the door and you were on the floor 
Spreadin' for the clowns in my pack 
Now you were wrong... 
If you thought - 
I'd take it lyin' down like a dog 
I put a match... 
In her snatch 
She thinks she's such a hot little vamp 

You're comin' face to face with the guy that's gonna knock you dead 
Face to face with the guy that's gonna bust your head 
I'm gonna knock you on the floor 
You'll beg me for no more 
You comn' face to face with me, like it or not 

Tear your face apart 
Waste you in the dark 
Rip you like a shark 
Won't think you're so smart 

Face to face (face to face) you disgrace 
Face to face (face to face) you disgrace 
Face to face (face to face) you disgrace 
Face to face 
Face to face 

Face to face with the guy that's gonna knock you dead 
Your're comin' face to face with the guy that's gonna bust your head 
I'm gonna knock you on the floor 
You'll beg me for no more 
You're comin' face to face with me, like it or not 

You're comin' face to face makin' humble pie out of your head 
Face to face you'll eat all the words that you said 
I'll knock you on the floor 
You won't get up anymore 
You're comin' face to face with me, like it or not 
And you won't like it at all, look out! 

I told you once before 
I ain't gonna tell you no more (no no) 
Face to face with me, like it or not!
