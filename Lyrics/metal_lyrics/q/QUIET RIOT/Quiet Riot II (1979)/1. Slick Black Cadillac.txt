Ooooo, Just a big black set of wheels 
Is what it takes to get me off 
I'm gonna drive all night 
Spin my wheels all night 
It feels all right 
It feels all right 

I don't need no drivers license 
I'm too reckless to survive 
It's like a carburetor instigator 
Feels all right 
Feels all right 

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac 
It's got solid gold hubcaps 
It makes me feel like a king 
I only need one thing 
And that's a Slick Black Cadillac (get up) 

You know I got a fully equipped rock 'n' roll machine 
At speeds that take me high, high, high 
At dead man's curve 
I only hear one word drive, drive, drive 
Drive, drive, drive 

My machine is making headlines 
It gives me love and everything 
It's like an institution of revolution 
It feels all right 
Feels all right 

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac 
It's got solid gold hubcaps 
It makes me feel like a king 
I only need one thing 
And that's a Slick Black Cadillac (pull over, woooo) 

I got the coppers on my tail 
Just for me an A.P.B. 
The sirens spinnin' 
Though it's me who's winnin' 
There're after me 
There're after me 

Before they know just what happened 
I disappeared to their surprise 
I got a Cadillac monkey on my back 
And I don't mind 
No, I don't mind 

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac 
It's got solid gold hubcaps 
It makes me feel like a king 
I only need one thing 
And that's a Slick Black Cadillac (hold on) 

Slick Black Cadillac 
It's got solid gold hubcaps 

Slick Black Cadillac 

I lay it down, spin wide and get laid in back, oh yeah 

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac 
It makes me feel like a king, alright!
