(This is a hidden track that can be found on some imports
of this album. This is NOT the updated version that can be found on
the 'Metal Health' album. This is an outtake version, it's
almost identical to the first version but with very subtle differences) 

Ooooo, Just a big black set of wheels 
Is what it takes to get me off 
I'm gonna drive all night 
Spin my wheels n' lights 
It feels all right 
It feels all right 

I don't need no drivers license 
I'm too reckless to survive 
It's like a carburetor instigator 
Feels all right 
Feels all right 

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac 
It's got solid gold hubcaps 
It makes me feel like a king 
I only need one thing 
And that's a Slick Black Cadillac (Oooo, give it up) 

Now I got a fully equipped rock 'n' roll machine 
At speeds that take me high, high, high 
Dead man's curve 
I only hear one word drive, drive, drive 
Drive, drive, drive 

My machine is making headlines 
Gives me love and everything 
It's like an institution of revolution 
It feels all right 
Yeah it feels all right 

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac 
It's got solid gold hubcaps 
It makes me feel like a king 
I only need one thing 
And that's a Slick Black Cadillac (pull over, woooooo) 

I got the coppers on my tail 
Just for me an A.P.B. 
Sirens spinnin' 
Me who's winnin' 
There're after me 
There're after me 

Before they know just what happened 
Disappear to their surprise 
I got a Cadillac monkey on my back 
And I don't mind 
No, I don't mind 

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac 
It's got solid gold hubcaps 
Feel like a king 
I only need one thing 
And that's a slick Black Cadillac (hold on) 

Slick Black Cadillac 
It's got solid gold hu-hubcaps 

Slick Black Cadillac 

I lay it down, spin wide and get laid in back (huh hahaha) 

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac 
It makes me feel like a king, alright!
