Ugh
Sweetness
Huh

I saw her standin' on the corner
As I was drivin' my car
She said, Hey there boy
So I pulled over
She asked, Are you goin' far?

She got right in
Oh oh I wasn't lookin' long
Just one touch warm and tender
Takes me to that moment of surrender

I'm falling, I'm fallin'
Baby I'm fallin' for you
I never thought it could happen
I'm fallin, I'm fallin'
Baby I'm fallin' for you

Well I took her home
She asked me in
She said, Can you stay for a while?
Cause behind closed doors
I know what's in store

Babe, I can tell by your style
I can taste your lips, oh oh yeah
I can see your face
My gun is fully loaded
Here's what I've got to do
Shoot you full of love, baby
That's what I got planned for you

I'm fallin, I'm fallin'
Baby I'm fallin' for you (oh no)
I'm fallin, I'm fallin'
Baby I'm fallin' for you
I never thought it could happen

I'm fallin, I'm fallin'
Baby I'm fallin' for you (oh no no)
I never thought it could happen
I'm fallin, I'm fallin'
Baby I'm fallin' for you

Hey
I can taste your lips, ah
I can see your face
I'm all beside myself
What am I gonna do
You're the only one for me
And I'm the only one for you

I'm fallin, I'm fallin'
Baby I'm fallin' for you (oh no)
I'm fallin, I'm fallin'
Baby I'm fallin' for you
I never thought it could happen
I'm fallin, I'm fallin'
Baby I'm fallin' for you (oh no no no)
I'm fallin, I'm fallin'
Baby I'm fallin' for you

I'm fallin, I'm fallin'
Baby I fallin' for you
