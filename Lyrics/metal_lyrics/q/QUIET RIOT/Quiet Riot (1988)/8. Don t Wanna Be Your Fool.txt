Ooh ooh ooh
I'm a victim of love
When there's too many heartaches
And too many tears

It's cold and dark
When I'm all alone
Through the shadows
Where no light shines
Oh, I'm all out of love
And so lost without you

How could something so good
Hurt so bad
Where did we go wrong
With what we had
You're cold as ice
A stranger to me
What's it gonna take
To change our destiny

Cause I don't
Wanna be your fool anymore
No I don't
Wanna be your fool anymore (oh no)

When I feel so lonely
And I need you only
You always seem to come my way
But if I ever leave you
It's because you've been untrue
All your cheating and lies
Who can believe you
No no not me
Not me anymore

Cause I don't
Wanna be your fool anymore
No I don't
Wanna be your fool anymore

You know I'm hurting
You know I try
You claimed me for a fool
Took me for a ride

Broken promises and a broken heart
If we pull together
They could tear us apart
No oh

I don't
Wanna be your fool anymore
No I don't
Wanna be your fool anymore
No I don't, baby
Wanna be your fool
