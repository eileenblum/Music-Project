Cut it
Hit me

I am the joker in the pack
Fun to be around
Bring you luck, full of love
When the chips are down
It ain't no use, now
Play the game
Man, I'm not your king
Cause when there's a joker
In your hand
This card can't be beat, oh no

(Ohohoh, I'm the joker)
Don't you know I'm the coolest
(Ohohoh, this joker's wild)
And you know I'm fun
(Ohohoh, I'm the joker)
Everybody everywhere's talking about me
(Ohohoh, this joker's wild)

Oh, 5 card stud in a loaded deck
With one card up my sleeve
That one-eyed jack is lookin' back
This joker takes his queen
Aces high, the deuce is down
The joker's having fun
You see, win or lose
I'm the face card, dude
I'm the talk of the town
That's right

[Repeat Chorus]

Oh yeah

Hey the face card's cool
The king is mean
And what do you know
That queen she's kind of sexy
So we'll play it right
Hit this hole in one
You and me in the back of the taxi
Oh oh

(Ohohoh, I'm the joker)
I'm so cool, ha ha

[Repeat Chorus]

The joker's wild

Oh yeah
(Ohohoh, I'm the joker)
Ah, don't you know I'm the coolest
(Ohohoh, the joker's wild)
(Ohohoh, the joker's wild)
Hey mmhmm
G-g-g-g-get it
G-g-g-g-get it down
Oh yeah, ow
G-g-g-g-get it
G-g-g-g-get it
Oh oh oh get it down
G-g-g-g-get it
G-g-g-g-get it down

Ha ha ha ha ha ha
