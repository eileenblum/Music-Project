Holdin' me close
On a hot summer night
Clothes are drippin' wet, babe
You feel so nice
Teach me, teach me darling
Teach me something new
Oh oh I wanna make love to you

We'll fit together
My hand in your glove
Little little girl
I need your woman's touch
My hot desire
Is runnin' away with me
Come on baby
Set it free

Stay with me tonight
Stay forever
Stay with me tonight
You'll discover
That this feeling's right
Like no other
Stay with me tonight

All my life
I dreamed of this
My satin sheets
And your satin dress
My hot desire
Is runnin' away with me
Come on baby
Set me free

Repeat Chorus

Oh oh oh
Oh

[Repeat Chorus]

Stay
Stay with me
Stay with me
Baby
G-g-g-g-get get
Closer closer closer
Closer to you

(Stay with me tonight)
Stay with me tonight
Oh oh oh

You don't need to hurry baby
On my satin sheets
Take off your satin dress

Too much to handle
