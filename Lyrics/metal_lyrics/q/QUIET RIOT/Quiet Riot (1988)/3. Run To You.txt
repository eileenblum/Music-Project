Oh, on a night so long ago
She left me and went away
Why did she have to go
Don't know, she wouldn't say
Everything is changed
Oh oh oh this time
I guess that's it for me

Yesterday is gone
My love's so far away
And she's gone gone gone gone
And it's time I face the day
All these restless days
Turn to sleepless nights
Angel of my life
Come back to me
And make it right

I'm gonna run to you
Won't you come to me
I'm missing you
Are you missing me
Wanna run to you (wanna run to you)
Won't you come to me (come to me)
I'm missing you
Are you missing me tonight
Oh, are you missing me baby

Somewhere in time
Two hearts will meet again
Together you and I
Baby, baby can we find out the names
Before the curtain falls
And the shows about to end
Will you be there for me
The way I've been there waiting for you

I'm gonna run to you (gonna run to you)
Won't you come to me (come to me)
I'm missing you
Baby are you missing me
I'm gonna run to you (gonna run to you)
Won't you come to me (come to me)
I'm missing you, are you missing me
I don't know (gonna run to you) Oh

Baby I'm gonna run to you
Oh, run with me
I'm gonna run to you
Run to you, baby
Baby baby baby
Please
