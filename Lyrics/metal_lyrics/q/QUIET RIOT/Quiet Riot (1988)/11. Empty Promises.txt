In a funny looking glass
Reflection of a face
One that I've seen before
I knock wood
I see you're using me

Always trying to read the score
When you're leading me on
The truth comes then it's gone
With you there's no certainty
In your private schools
You've broken all the rules
Don't you try doing the same thing to me

Oh, you're giving me promises
What did I ever do to you
Empty promises
When am I ever gonna get the truth, oh oh
What am I gonna do, yeah

The first time I kissed you baby
I kiss you in the back of my car
You lead me to believe that
That it's nothing like I see
Honey, that's the way things are

You promise me romance
But that was just a dance
A chance til you took control, yeah
Let me be your private school
I'll teach you the rules
Maybe by the end of the summer

So don't be giving me promises
What did I ever do to you
Empty promises
When am I ever gonna hear the truth
No more promises
What did I, what did I ever do to you
Empty promises
When am I ever gonna get the truth, oh oh
What am I gonna do
Oh, what am I ever gonna do

And you promised me the world
But you dance to a different drummer
Let me be your private school
And I'll teach you the rules
Baby by the end of the summer

Then there'll be no more promises
What did I ever do to you
Empty promises
When am I ever gonna hear the truth
Promises oh oh
Empty promises
When am I gonna hear the truth
Oh oh oh oh
When am I gonna hear the truth
(Promise)
When am I gonna, gonna get the truth
Empty promises
What did I ever do to you
