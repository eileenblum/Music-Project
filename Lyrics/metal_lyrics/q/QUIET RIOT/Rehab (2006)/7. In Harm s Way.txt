[Verse 1:]
You told me no lies, you talking no evil
It's time to let you go
Wondering why is it too much trouble I really want to know
I gotta cold fever, I gotta new bag, I got it down in Mexico
Should have known better, sugar in the pie
I really want to know

[Chorus:]
In Harms way and it feels so good
And I don't know which way to turn
In Harms way and it feels so good
Nothing more needs to be said

[Verse 2:]
You been my jailer, took me for a while
But you weren't built to last
I need a little comfort I got your remedy
I really want to know
You told me no lies , you talking no evil
But it's time to let you go
