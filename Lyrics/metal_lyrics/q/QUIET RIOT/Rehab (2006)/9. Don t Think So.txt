[Verse 1:]
You sucked religion from my life
When we met I believed you were hell
take the knife from my back
I know you'll use it again
Don't Think Of Me
I won't think of you
Don't Think Of Me
I won't think of you
You don't give
You just take
You don't give
You just break

[Verse 2:]
We were never friends
a one act play
I had to stop pretending
My heart don't ache since you've been gone
It's like you never left
Don't Think Of Me
I won't think of you
Don't Think Of Me
I won't think of you
You don't give
You just take
You don't give
You just take

[Bridge:]
My time and my money but money ain't love no
The evil within shines without a light
I know what I see and I mean what I say
