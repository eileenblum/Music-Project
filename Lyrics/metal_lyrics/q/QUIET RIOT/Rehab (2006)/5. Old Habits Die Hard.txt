[Verse 1:]
I never felt it coming, but you love in a supernatural way
Now you got me running, babe I'm running and I can't get away
And I feel like I lost control of my very soul , yes I did
Does it mean that much to you And all the things we've been through
What's a poor boy to do
And I just wanna let you know that I love you

[Chorus:]
Now I'm face to face in the mirror
And I see what love has done
Let me tell you my thoughts and my visions
Old Habits, Old Habits Die Hard

[Verse 2:]
Now I really should have known better
Everytime I look at you I believe you could do no harm
Sometimes the voice inside my head say's get away, get away.
You know you live inside my mind, am I cursed am I blessed or am I blind?
I never did you no wrong, what am I supposed to do?
Bride
Over me you must carry on
I know what your coming to me you must carry on

[Repeat Verse 1]
