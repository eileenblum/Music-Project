[Carlos Cavazo - Kevin DuBrow - Frankie Banali]

When it's kill or be killed baby
I sometimes wish we ate our young
If fear was clear, then just maybe
All your sweet dreams will make you strong

Babe, you need some help
Babe, not by yourself no
Hey, a plea for mercy
Hey, your winter's here to stay

Dig a hole, dig it deep
Bury yourself alive
Say a prayer, say one for me
Then kiss your ass goodbye

All out of time, your luck's on empty
Your pain if flows like falling rain
It's never ending
Your faith comes from the damage done
Never ever thought you did no wrong
It seems so strange that you're complaining

You say, you have a vision
But hey, you lack conviction you know
You think you're on a mission from God
But look at your condition you know

Dig a hole, dig it deep
Bury yourself alive
Say a prayer, say one for me
Then kiss your ass goodbye

Dig a hole, how do you sleep
Holding your fears inside
Say a prayer, say one for me
Then kiss your ass goodbye

Dig a hole, dig it deep
Bury yourself alive
Say a prayer, say one for me
Then kiss your ass bye-bye

Dig a hole, how do you sleep
Holding your fears inside
Say a prayer, say one for me
Then kiss your ass goodbye

No more fears - No more lying
It's so clear -- He more crying

No more fears He more lying
All your fears keep on trying

Keep on trying
No use, no use, no use crying
Oh!
