[Carlos Cavazo - Kevin DuBrow - Frankie Banali]

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon

They're out to get you anyway they can
It just might hurt you, but then again
It's just a token of the extreme
Listen, that pain won't gain you nothing
Don't turn your back or something
Will come back to haunt you
Ain't no rule, says you'll be their fool

Hell or high water
We rebel when we call for
I said Hell or high water

Don't try too suck me into a trap
Don't try to bite my baby cause I bite back
What were you thinking, you turn me loose
Well, it's mind over matter
I don't mind and you don't matter
Can't take no prisoners who don't want to be
I can't see whose hand it feeds

Hell or high water
We rebel when we call for
I said Hell or high
Water down the drain is of no use to me
Don't cry over spilt milk, it makes me wanna scream

Hell or high water
We rebel when we call for
I said Hell or high water

Nothing's gonna stop me now - No! No!
No one's gonna push me around - Alright!
Hell or high water

Hell or high water
