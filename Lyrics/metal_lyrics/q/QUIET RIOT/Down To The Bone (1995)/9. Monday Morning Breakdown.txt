[Carlos Cavazo - Kevin DuBrow - Frankie Banali]

In the darkness your heart is breaking with no one there
There's a sadness, you shed a tear but no one cares
Keep on running from the shattered dreams you can't repair
Look for comfort, your empty life's so hard to bear

In the middle of the night when you think you can't go on
Can't you take it
In a broken state of mind, will you make it
When the waves of loneliness rush to tear your life apart
Will they drown you
Is it freedom that you want

Take me away, Monday morning breakdown
You can't escape, early warning cry

At the crossroads, the breaking point it all too near
In your madness, the road to nowhere seems so clear

If every single day brings you closer to the edge
Look around you
Get out if you can, do you want to
It's a matter of time and you're gonna draw the line
That surrounds you
When you're out on a limb, hold on

Take me away, Monday morning breakdown
It's here to stay, early warning cry
You can't escape, that Monday morning breakdown
Come on Take me

You can't change the world, you can't change the past
You can't change your mind, so this one's got to last

In the middle of the night when you think you can't go on
Can't you take it
In a broken state of mind, will you make it
When the waves of loneliness rush to tear your life apart
Will they drown you
Gotta get out! Gotta get out!

Take me away, Monday morning breakdown
Early warning cry
You can't escape, that Monday morning breakdown
