[Carlos Cavazo - Kevin DuBrow - Frankie Banali]

Dancing on a tightrope
Walking with the moonshine
Sneaking up the wrong road
Making up an alibi

Clawing, scraping, living ain't easy
Looking for a friend
Dancing madly backwards and forwards
Searching for the bend

Keep on rollin', let it flow
Got a feelin' I want you to know
Rock the river, shake the lake
We're gonna do whatever it takes

Making no apologies
Out of mediocrity
I'm feelin' like a dynamo
With no particular place to go

Good times, bad times, nothing can stop me
Got the will to survive
Get up, stand up, won't be afraid of
All the fear that's inside

So keep on rollin', let it flow
Got a feelin' I want you to know
Rock the river, shake the lake
We're gonna do whatever it takes

In the corner, holding court
There's a fever we all sport
Rock the river, shake the lake
We're gonna do whatever it takes
Whatever it takes

Clawing, scraping, living ain't easy
Looking for a friend
Dancing madly backwards and forwards
Stop!

Keep on rollin', let it flow
Got a feelin' I want you to know
Rock the river, shake the lake
We're gonna do whatever it takes

In the corner, holding court
There's a fever we all sport
Rock the river, shake the lake
We're gonna do whatever it takes
Rock the river, shake the lake
We're gonna do
Nothing to lose every days

Think I want
Shake for me
Baby, Mamamamamamama
Living in the fantasy
In the all
