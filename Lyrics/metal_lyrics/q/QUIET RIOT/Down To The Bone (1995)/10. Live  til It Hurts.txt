Mama, mama, mama, mama yeah all right

Can't take a look in the mirror, it's gonna bust the beast
But I am alive
I only flirt with danger until I feel the heat
That's how I survive

The slave that I can't master
Eternal life thereafter
Sick of it all

Live! Live! Live! Live 'til it hurts
Give! Give! Give and take all you deserve
Do what you do till your black and blue
Live! Live! Live! Live 'til it hurts

And when my body hungers I feed my passion first
Demand my supply
We're each a savage hunter on this collision curse
I'll take you alive

All magic, all illusion
Your love is my transfusion
Never say die

Live! Live! Live! Live 'til it hurts
Give! Give! Give and take all you deserve
Do what you do till your black and blue
Live! Live! Live! Live 'til it hurts
All right

No matter what you do you gotta make a sacrifice
Let 'em take a bite of you, everybody's got a pray the price, oh yeah

The slave that I can't master
Eternal life thereafter
Sick of it all - Live 'til it hurts

Live! Live! Live! Live 'til it hurts
Give! Give! Give and take all you deserve
Do what you do till your black and blue
Live! Live! Live! Live 'til it hurts

Live! Live! Live! Live 'til it hurts
Give! Give! Give and take all you deserve
Come on
Live! Live! Live 'til it hurts
Live! Live! Live 'til it hurts
Oh yeah, oh mamamama
Live 'til it hurts
