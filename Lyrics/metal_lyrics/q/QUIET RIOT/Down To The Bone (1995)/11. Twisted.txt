[Carlos Cavazo - Kevin DuBrow - Frankie Banali]

Whoa! Whoa! Tied up and twisted

When trust turns to rust
You only have instinct to count on
Passion is fashioned to crash and burn
Just when you found some
It's like the sound of falling rain
Nothing to lose and so much to gain
Ecstasy or misery, my destiny what will it be

Tied up and twisted - Screamin' in the night
Tied up and twisted - The bark that makes you bite
Whoa, tied up and twisted! Whoa, tied up and twisted!

If sin is the shoe that fits, we're all born to wear it
Restrictions create a conflict for souls who can bear it
The pressure's getting hard to take
Something's got to give or I'm gonna break
My purgatory fears, the madness now seems so clear

Tied up and twisted - Screamin' in the night
Tied up and twisted - The bark that makes you bite
Whoa, tied up and twisted! Whoa, tied up and twisted!

Ecstasy or misery, my destiny what will it be

Demented incentive is my main motivation
I walk down a rocky road, there is no salvation
Gonna put it in, gonna pull it out

Tied up and twisted - Screamin' in the night
Tied up and twisted - The bark that makes you bite
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa, tied up and twisted!

Twisted, twisted, twisted, twisted
Yeah got me all time dirty yeah, oh yeah
You got me tied up and twisted!
