[Carlos Cavazo - Kevin DuBrow - Frankie Banali]

Baby walks, baby talks
Baby got them voodoo thoughts
Baby pants, baby chants
Baby does the back street dance

She swoons in the moonlight
She screams in the sunlight

You got voodoo - Voodoo Brew
You got voodoo - Voodoo Brew

Mojo moves, cajun grooves
Cast a spell with magic brews
Sleep the day, pump the night
Get the girs-gris, do it right
It right, oh yeah, oh right

She crawls like a king snake
She howls like a wolfgang
She gives as much as she takes
Sort of pulls but she won't break

You got voodoo - Voodoo Brew
I want voodoo - Voodoo Brew
You got voodoo - Voodoo Brew
I want voodoo - Voodoo Brew

Baby walks, baby talks
Baby got them voodoo thoughts
Baby pants, baby chants
She does the back street dance
Oh mine, oh yeah, oh precious baby

I want voodoo - Voodoo Brew
I want voodoo - Voodoo Brew
