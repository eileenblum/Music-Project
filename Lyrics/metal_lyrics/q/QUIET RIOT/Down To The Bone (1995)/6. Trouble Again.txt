[Carlos Cavazo - Kevin DuBrow - Frankie Banali - Bobby Rondinelli]

I hear a black cat moaning
In the middle of the night
Like a smoke stack lightning
That's burning bright
I went down to the crossroads
Where I met a man
He said: I'll show you the way
If you take my hand
I ain't superstitious, but maybe I should
I'd cast a spell on you if I could, if I could

Oh no, here it comes
Looks like I'm in trouble again
Bad luck ain't heaven sent
Looks like I'm in trouble, trouble again

Standing in the shadows
In the middle of the night
Knee deep in quicksand
It's getting really tight
I got a voodoo woman
Down Louisiana way
She said: The devil gonna find you
Nothing you can do, better get on your way
You're on the wrong road at the right time
There's a bad moon on the rise, on the rise

Oh no, here it comes
Looks like I'm in trouble again
Bad luck ain't heaven sent
Looks like I'm in trouble again

Oh no, here it comes
Looks like I'm in trouble again
Bad luck ain't heaven sent
Looks like I'm in trouble, trouble again

I'm in trouble, trouble again
I don't know when I'll be back again oh no
Bad luck follows, it never ends
The winding road can't take me home

Oh no, here it comes
Looks like I'm in trouble again
Bad luck ain't heaven sent
Yea get in trouble again

They find do They find don't
Looks like I'm in trouble again
Look out It's way a goes
Looks like I'm in trouble again

Voodoo ahead, witchcraft behind
Looks like me and trouble are two of a kind
The die is cast, I can't break the mold
Trouble's gonna follow me wherever, wherever I go
