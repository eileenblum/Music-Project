I don't think I'll hang around here
Maybe I could
Flying so high, no landing gear
Don't do nobody good
You slide around this sleazy town
Nose pressed to the sky high
You slide around this funky town
Thinking you'll never die

Lies, Lies! It's all a pretty pack of lies
And when you're falling down
Watch out as you hit the ground
Lies, Lies! It's all a pretty pack of lies
And when you're falling down
Watch out as you hit the ground

I don't think I stand a chance of
Watching you grow old
Pin cushion Lucy she died
And the ice is flowing cold
You fly around this rocket town
Way high late at night, high, high, high, high
You slide around this funky town
Ain't never gonna die, die, die

Lies, Lies! It's all a pretty pack of lies
And when you're falling down
Watch out as you hit the ground
Lies, Lies! It's all a pretty pack of lies
And when you're falling down
Watch out as you hit the ground
Head down as you hit the ground
Head down as you hit the ground

I know, I know you try some live and some will die
I know love will find a way when it comes to you another day
I know I know you'll see when it brings you to your knees
I hope, I hope you see it's all lies

I said Lies, Lies! It's all a pretty pack of lies
And when you're falling down
Watch out as you hit the ground
Lies, Lies! It's all a pretty pack of lies
And when you're falling down
Watch out

It's all lies! It's all lies! It's all lies! It's all lies
Lies a pretty pack of lies yeah
