[Lieberman -- Cesario]

I was wrong baby, you were right
That doesn't make us enemies tonight
I'm so sorry for the things I've done
Acting too big to see the damage I've done
Those crazy nights are dead and gone
I never knew my heart could be so strong baby

Love can change you
Won't you let me love you tonight oh baby
Love can change you
I can't hold back this feeling inside oh no

I made promises I couldn't keep
Never thinking I'd get in so deep
I thought love was just a state of mind
A place where lonely people wasted precious time
Well, you showed me how to rise again
And you made me see just what I've been missing

Love can change you
Won't you let me love you tonight oh baby
Love can change you
I can't hold back this feeling inside oh no

I didn't want to let you see
Just how bad you got to me
Now I need your touch
Cause I'm too much in love

Those crazy nights are dead and gone
I never knew my heart could be so strong baby

Love can change you
Won't you let me love you tonight oh baby
Love can change you
I can't hold back
I can't hold back no, no, no
Love can change you
Let me love you baby
You drive me my through heart crazy
