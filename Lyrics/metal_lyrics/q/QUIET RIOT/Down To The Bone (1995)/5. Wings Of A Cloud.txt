[Carlos Cavazo - Kevin DuBrow - Frankie Banali]

Flying far from the scene of the crime now
Nothing more that I want to be part of
Gonna break the chains that been holding me down
Gonna spread my wings and I'll fly now
Gonna set my sights on the velvet moon

I can hear my train is a comin'
I can feel my blood is a boilin'
I see my fate on the wings of a cloud
Wings of a cloud Wings of a cloud
Wings of a cloud

You can keep your vision of a perfect world
It's just a matter of time, it's gonna crash and burn
Shooting stars are gonna be my only friends
In the wink of an eye I'll be gone now
Gonna get it right and none too soon

I can hear my train is a comin'
I can feel my blood is a boilin'
I see my fate on the wings of a cloud
Wings of a cloud
On the wings of a cloud
Wings of a cloud, gonna get you

Gonna break the chains that been holding me down
Gonna spread my wings and I'll fly now
Gonna set my sights on the velvet moon

I can hear my train is a comin'
I can feel my blood is a boilin'
I see my fate on the wings of a cloud
Wings of a cloud
On the wings of a cloud
Wings of a cloud

I'm gonna get forever in sight
Gonna hold my soul up to the light
I can ride the wind
On the wings of a cloud
Here I come baby!

Oh babe, think
On the wings, on the wings
