Take action â gotta raise a fisted glove
Domination â can't continue acting like doves
You're serving others intents
With only words for defense
There is no freedom to speak

Rise or fall
You're the ones who make the stand
Rise or fall
Take the word from this promised land

Your reaction â sticks and stones are no match for steel
This rebellion â win or lose, it's in your hands
Now listen â so it's called apartheid
Do you know what that means?
Is it a separate nation?

[Chorus:]
Rise or fall
You're the ones who must take the stand
Rise or fall
Take the word from this promised land

Strength in numbers can alter your fate
Take the action before it's too late
Make a stand

[Chorus]

Rise or fall
You're the ones who must take the stand
Rise or fall
Take the word; take the word from this land

Rise or fall
