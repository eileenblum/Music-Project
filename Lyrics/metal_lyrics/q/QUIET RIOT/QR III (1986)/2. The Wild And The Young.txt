Times are changing â nothing stays the same
For this jukebox generation
Into fashion â their computer games
Modern day communication
The news of today â will fade in tomorrow
They are the strong â they'll survive

[Chorus]
The wild and the young
They all have their dreams
The wild and the young
They've got to be free
The sun never sets
For souls on the run
The wild and the young

Yeah
Hah!

Burning passion â with no guilt or shame
It's accepted education
Misbehaving, no regrets â no blame
With a bold kind of sophistication

So close to the edge
And high on the wire
They are not wrong
They're alive

[Chorus]
The wild and the young
They all have their dreams
The wild and the young
They've got to be free
The sun never sets
For souls on the run
The wild and the young

Ha!

So close to the edge
And high on the wire
They are not wrong
They're alive

Look out!

Wild, wild
The wild and the
Young, y-y-y-young

The wild and the young
They all have their dreams
The wild and the young
They've got to be free
The sun never sets
For souls on the run

The wild and the young
They all have their dreams
The wild and the young
They've got to be free
The sun never sets
For souls on the run
The wild and the young

Oh yeah

The wild and the young
Oh

Right
