Midnight masquerade
An assortment of fantasies
Never ending from room to room

Dressed up for charades
Every guest has a part to play
And their roles are understood

Undercover â a secret rendezvous
They won't discover â that it's me and it's you

At the Twilight Hotel
Check your soul at the door
They've got memories to sell
And so much more

Last call at the bar
Fast-talking and promises
Never reading between the lines

A scene so bizarre
Such a twisted reality
This place full of manic minds

It's like a dreamland â with time standing still
So make your big plans â they've got all the frills

[Chorus:]
At the Twilight Hotel
Check your soul at the door
They've got memories to sell
And so much more
In the Twilight Hotel
Cries of life still echo
It's a twilight magic spell
Where anything goes

Undercover â a secret rendezvous
They won't discover â that it's me and it's you

[Chorus]
