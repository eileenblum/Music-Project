She's a dancin' girl who brings out the heat
Inside all the men
She knows how to move and make you feel
Like you wanna get into sin

On top of the bar she was going real far
Really made me catch my breath
When I saw what she had, I knew I'd be glad
To get down â a duel to the death

Down and dirty â you're down and dirty
She's down and dirty â you're down and dirty

Situation erect; thought I'd get direct
Talking dirty was the girl's forte
Whispered in my ear what I wanna hear
Come with me baby; let's play â ole

She went to the back to get her traps
My sixth sense was bothering me
She kept her word; somethin' I heard
Things were gonna get kind of mean

Down and dirty â she's down and dirty
Get down and dirty; get down â down and dirty

Well, there was somethin' a-goin' on
Something I'd never known before
Leather and lace is all that I could see
I lost my power of will
You know she shook me still
Never thought I'd get in oh so deep

I started to plead; have mercy on me
I'm feelin' just a bit distressed
What you're doing to me is so obscene
Got myself into a mess

She started to dance; I grabbed my pants
Found my way to the door
Hot on my trail, a thousand females
Screaming âBaby, More more more!â

Down and dirty â down and dirty
Down and dirty; low down and dirty

Get down and dirty â get down

Get down and dirty; get down â down and dirty
