You've got to believe we can change the world
Don't turn a blind eye to tomorrow's world
We're on the good side looking out
Don't take for granted this silent shout

The hands of time are rolling fast
To turn the tide, we must move fast
Let's share the hope and pull some strings
We hold the answer, this vision sings

They're holding on, but for how long?
Let's set them free!

[Chorus:]
Put your helping hands together
Rocking on for survival
Got to take a stand â time to make a plan
Don't sit idle
We hold the key to the dreams
It's not as hard as it seems
Get up and put your hands together
All your helping hands

We're three steps on, yet two steps back
No more waiting and that's a fact
A call to arms â let's take a stand
It's up to you to lend a helping hand

They're holding on, but for how long?
Let's set them free!

[Chorus]

We are the thunder in the storm
That brings the winds of change
Together we can overcome and start a brand new day

Put your helping hands together
Rocking on for survival
Got to take a stand â it's time to make a plan
Don't sit idle

Put your helping hands together
Rocking on for survival
You got to take a stand â time to make a plan
Don't sit idle
