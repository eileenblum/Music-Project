We're not the ones to blame
Burning passions mixed with pain
Past the point of no return
Nothing stays the same

The streets become our home
Restless souls out on our own
Trapped by rules â made by fools
Chasing the unknown

[Chorus:]
In the still of the night
With nowhere to turn
We took a roll of the dice
And we learned thatâ¦
In the still of the night
Streets of fire will burn
As we run for our lives
To survive

Voices in the dark, calling us to play a part
Living on the razor's edge
Have we gone too far?

With every chance that we take
There is a price that must be paid
It's easy come and easy go
But we're here to stay

[Chorus 2x]

To survive; to survive; to survive

And where do I turn in the still of the night?
And what did I learn in the still of the night?
The fire's gonna burn
