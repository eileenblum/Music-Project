Get readyâ¦

You got body percussion â don't need no discussion
Think you know just what I mean
No words were spoken, but rules were broken
Had to be seen to (be) believed

As a preacher of lust, you gotta do what you must
I practiced what you preached
If ya got a limitation, we'll change the location
Gotta have room to breathe

I want love
Whole lotta love
Give me love (all your love)

[Chorus:]
Well let's pump, pump, pump, pump
Strike it rich â what you've been dreamin' of
Pump, pump, pump, pump
We're gonna hunt for gold â gonna dig for love

The more I get, the more I want
Blood rushes out my brain
She's got a bowl full of soul
I didn't know the girl was gonna drive me insane

She had a real cool cat â I know where it's at
Has to be the ultimate find
At the end of the score â ready for more
I knew that the pump was the prize

I want love â give your love
Whole lotta love
Give me love (all your love)

[Chorus]

I want love â all your love
Whole lotta love
Dig down for love

[Chorus]
