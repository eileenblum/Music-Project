There's a light at the end of the tunnel â it's rock and roll
There's no fight â words into action â your life is your own
The curtains rising â take the thunder â it's yours to hold
(I say) let's celebrate it â we can generate it

The main attraction â satisfaction
Guaranteed to rock the chains that bind you

Keep the faith â your time has come feel the beat
Don't play safe â the sky is the limit â no need to retreat
So take your best shot â and place your bet on what you know (nothing to lose)
The stage is set now â you've got the know how

(for the) main attraction â satisfaction
Guaranteed to rock the chains that bind you
The main attraction â your reaction
Guaranteed to leave your tracks behind you

In the end â we'll stand in the spotlight â we are the show (here we go)
We'll defend â here's the performance â it's all we know
We've captured the moment
The power and the glory â is ours to hold (and we'll never let go)
It's a celebration â the instigation

It's the main attraction â satisfaction
Guaranteed to rock the chains that bind you
The main attraction â your reaction
Guaranteed to leave your tracks behind you
