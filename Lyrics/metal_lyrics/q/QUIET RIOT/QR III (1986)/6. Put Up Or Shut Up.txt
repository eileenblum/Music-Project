She's got hurricane eyes
And you know what she sees
She's got love in her thighs
And she gives it for free

She makes it shiver and shake
And don't need no advice
She won't put on the brakes
And you be her device

She's gonna tease you, up and down now
Gonna play for keeps

I said put up â or shut it up â now
Put up â or shut it up

She's got hounds on her trail
And they follow her scent
She's the kind of female
That don't need no consent (she's wild)

She's got a license to thrill
And she shoots from the hip
Takes your power of will
And your passion is sure to drip

Here's a package built for speed now
What will be the price?

I said put up â or shut it up â now
Put up â or shut it up

Want a piece of the action
And I don't want to be teased
Gotta feel the connection
She's turning on the heat

She's got hurricane eyes
And you know what she sees
She's got love in her thighs
And she gives it all away for free

She's gonna tease you, up and down now
Gonna play for keeps

You've got to put up â or shut it up â now
I said put up â or shut it up â now
Why don't you put it up â or shut it up?
Why don't you put it up â or shut it up?

Why don't you put up â or shut it up â now
Put it up â or shut it up â now
