You're the hunter and I'm the game
Since we met, I'm not the same
The hunger in you can't be satisfied

You planned a secret strategy
To take control and capture me
I lost my will and now I'm paralyzed

Been made a slave to love
That's what I'll always be
A victim of your touch
You stole my soul and now I'm just a slave to love

It took one night at your hotel
To fall from grace â into your spell
I can't believe you brought me to my knees

You kissed me once and loved me twice
A monumental sacrifice
Your tiger's touch was hot and aimed to please

Been made a slave to love
That's what I'll always be
A victim of your touch
You stole my soul and now I'm just a slave to love

I've been used â been held hostage for so long
Is this one-way love affair really wrong?

Been made a slave to love
That's what I'll always be
A victim of your touch
You stole my soul and now I'm just a slave to love

A victim of your touch
