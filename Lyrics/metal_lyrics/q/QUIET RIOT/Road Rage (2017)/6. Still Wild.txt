Days are shorter, nights are long
I never looked back and I didn't reload
It takes my mind and I come undone
Stop, dead end, nowhere to run
A tear in my heart
And my eyes are open
Doors are locked and no one knows
Mother nature's son is gone
In this place, un-caged, unknown

Why pull the blankets over
While you've got the time to run
The beast is coming closer
Only fear what you've never known

(Still wild)
Outta control
As the animal's haunting my mind
And I'm
(Still wild)
Never felt more alive

Time still faster, I'm in darkness
Can't escape the path I'm on
Hate breeds deep inside, it's solace
Goes down burning like the sun
I hear the sounds of terror rising
Instinct tells me it's my call
The howl is sent, the hunt is mine to
Pass the curse to one and all

Why pull the blankets over
While you've got the time to run
The beast is coming closer
Only fear what you've never known

The monster calls you over
No way out and no way back
There's no escape to hold you
Only way out is to join the pack

(Still wild)
Outta control
As the animal's haunting your mind
Now you're
(Still wild)
The moon is full tonight
(Still wild)
Living this hell feels more like heaven inside
Now you're
(Still wild)
Never felt more alive

Why pull the blankets over
While you've got the time to run
The beast is coming closer
Only fear what you've never known

(Still wild)
Outta control
As the animal's haunting our minds
We are
(Still wild)
The moon is full tonight
We are
(Still wild)
Living this hell feels more like heaven inside
We are
(Still wild)
Never felt more alive
