We're never gonna stop
Go another round
They try to set us up
We knock 'em down
They wanna make us stop
Bring 'em back around
They try to set us up
We knock 'em down

Caught up in all of the day to day
Fed up with all that you've gotta say
Fuck it up and give up. You're all alone
Stand my ground where we belong

I don't believe it for what you want
Get out forget in this time you're wrong
Light up and let up and get away
Give it away get out of my face

They are lining up to get me
I'm a mess I'm a mess
But I'm locked and ready
They are going to fall like the rest

We're never gonna stop
Go another round
They try to set us up
We knock 'em down
They wanna make us stop
Bring 'em back around
They try to set us up
We knock 'em down

If they gonna, let 'em come and
Try to stop us hanging around
We knock 'em down
Huh!

I'm ready and waiting for what you got
Another level that I don't believe you want
When they unchained me
You're facing me in the eyes
Even the devil could never contain this fire

They're lining up to get me
I'm a mess I'm a mess
But I'm locked and ready
They are going to fall like the rest

We're never gonna stop
Go another round
They try to set us up
We knock 'em down
They wanna make us stop
Bring 'em back around
They try to set us up
We knock 'em down

If they gonna, let 'em come and
Try to stop us making a sound
(Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
Get in back, the line is stretching,
All attacking all around
Well knock 'em...

While you are off in your head
We thought we'd give you what you wanted
Just to make you give up on it
Where we are going instead
We know some things are gonna change
But we will always be the same yeah

Wanna piece of me?
Get down with a lick on my guitar!

Caught up in all of the day to day
Fed up with all that you've gotta say
Fuck it up and give up. You're all alone
Stand my ground where we belong
Ya know that it's over
Your time is up
Surrender the ending the final drop
You never knew I was a warrior
The winner, forever victorious!

They're lining up to get me
I'm a mess I'm a mess
But unlocked and ready
They are going to fall like the rest

We're never gonna stop
Hit the final round
They try to set us up
We knock 'em down

They wanna make us stop
Bring 'em back around
They tried to set us up
We knock 'em down
