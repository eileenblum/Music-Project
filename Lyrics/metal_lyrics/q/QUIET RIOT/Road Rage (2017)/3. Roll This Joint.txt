Break it all up now
Like crumbling leaves
Bring us all together my little pieces
Smooth it all down
Or we could pack it all in
Anybody, everybody, or just myself

There's so many ways
That I can get to know ya
There are so many vibes
And I'll give 'em a try

Hold each end uh loosely
Lick it up and give it a twist
Caught me in a blue dream
Strike a match with a flick of the wrist
If you're missing the point
After I rock this house, I'm a roll this...

We're lifting off now
Packed to explode
Take 2 to pass. We're riding with the joker
Well, do you wanna
Stick to the road?
Ain't no telling where exactly we will go to

'Cause there's so many ways
That I can get to know ya
There are so many vibes
And I'll give 'em a try

Hold each end uh loosely
Lick it up and give it a twist
Caught me in a blue dream
Strike a match with a flick of the wrist
If you're missing the point
After I rock this house, I'm a roll this...

Join the crowd
They'll tell you where I'll be
I'm with Cheech and Chong
And Willie and Marley
Get stoned!

If you feel for the truth
Now reach for your light
I think it's time we get some "feel good" in your system
Fire up for freedom
Burn up all night
'Cause now we're going twice as high
In half the distance

There's so many ways
That I can get to know ya
There are so many vibes
Come on and give 'em a try

Hold each end uh loosely
Lick it up and give it a twist
Caught me in a blue dream
Strike a match with a flick of the wrist
If you're missing the point
After I rock this house, I'm a roll this joint
Gotta keep on rolling!
I said you're too uptight
And you're missing the point
After I rock this house, I'm a roll this joint
