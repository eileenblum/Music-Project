The day to day is so mundane
Instead of reachin' outward
Just to find a different outlet
I don't wanna no no no

Well, big boss man's
Got the upper hand
Big bully for the company
Ain't truly who you want to be? Tell me! No no no

Waiting here
Our days are longer
Take a chance and
Make or break it

I don't need no invitation
I just want to getaway

I disagree
You're not the boss of me
Were getting tied
Of the enemy
And how it's never gonna be
The way we want it no no no

My mind is made
We are on our way
And they're never gonna get it
If they don't know
Where we're headed
Taking off for worse or better
Getting lost with no agenda
We've been waiting
For the same thing
Like it's taking,

Disappearing days, no longer
It's our chance to
Make or break it

Get back to your native nature
Got no time to hesitate
I don't need no invitation
I just want to getaway

Well, it's time I was
Packing my bags
Got to get me some of that
Got a new reason to celebrate
Getting out of this
Getting outta that
Got a getaway!

Ooh let's fly

Taking off, no telling
When I'll be home
Where we are, on a getaway,
I gotta let it roll

Get back to your native nature
Got no time to hesitate
I don't need no invitation
I just want to getaway
