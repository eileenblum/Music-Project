Take it out, take it all
Like a hypocrite
Make a fool out of yourself
Waste of time, waste of life
Like an idiot
Blame yourself in your own farewell

I know the story
You don't deserve the glory
Dug your grave
And there's hell to pay

(Take your shot)
What you had could've made it
(Take your shot)
But you're false and faceless
(Take your shot)
With nobody left to save you
Gotta face it
You're the wasted

You're never wrong, always right
But you're counterfeit
I've seen the light and it shines straight through you
I'm not alone and on the edge
It's no surprise you're living dead
So change your name
Third times the charm
We all know who you are

I know the story
You don't deserve the glory
Dug your grave and there's hell to pay

(Take your shot)
What you had could've made it
(Take your shot)
But you're false and faceless
(Take your shot)
With nobody left to save you
Gotta face it
You're the wasted

We are the fight, fire off
You're the enemy
You make a lot of noise but you're deaf to reason
Strike a match, burn yourself
And your legacy
Save your prayers when you face the demons

I know the story
You don't deserve the glory
Dug your grave and there's hell to pay

(Take your shot)
What you had could've made it
(Take your shot)
But you're false and faceless
(Take your shot)
With nobody left to save you
Gotta face it
You're the wasted
