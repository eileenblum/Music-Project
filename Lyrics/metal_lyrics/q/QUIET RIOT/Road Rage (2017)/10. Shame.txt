Trip down where they're taking you now
Loss of all your sense of control
They'll crawl down on hands and knees
Beggars and thieves, believe
Believe

Misuse of punishment
To me is a waste
Come taste the shame

Promises don't matter at all
With the loss of all
Your sense of control

The entertainers kicked down, damned with the friends
The dream is never as real
As it seems to be

So lost inside your head
You're not the one to blame
Misuse of punishment
To me is a waste
Come taste the shame

Taste the shame
Waste away

Methods in madness
Got a hold on me
The truth will never
Be a guarantee
Sign up for fame
Trade pleasure with greed
Kicked off the upper class
Tough luck in a dream
Beggars and thieves believe
Believe

So lost inside your head
You're not the one to blame
Misuse of punishment
To me is a waste
Come taste the shame
