Voices are calling me
I'm under the attack
Sounds like a memory
Feels like we just got back
I kiss my family
Before we're out the door again

We're running blind in the dark
We are together, apart

Cities and streets
Fading in the night
Colors and noise
In a rage of light
People we reach
Always come and go
Where everything becomes the road

Another aeroplane
40,000 miles
I can see your face
In the passing clouds
Unforgiving times
Always another show to play

We're running blind in the dark
We are together, at heart

Cities and streets
Fading in the night
Colors and noise
In a rage of light
People we reach
Always come and go
Where everything becomes the road

Cities and streets
Fading in the night
Colors and noise
In a rage of light
People we reach
Always come and go
Where everything becomes the road
