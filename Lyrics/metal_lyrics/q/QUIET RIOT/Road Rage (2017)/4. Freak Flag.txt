Cast out and all alone
In this barren wasteland
You never been so far from home
But now we're on our way there

It takes heart to bleed your veins
From what they make us into
We're rising from the flames
To break the chains around you

Locked out, shut down
We'll never be the same (hey) again
We're running through them
Don't look back, throw down
Get ready
They're about to meet the revolutions

Forget what the world thinks
We are the chosen
We live. To ride
Our freak flags flying
Nobody owns you
Fight to be free
Put your hands up
And your freak flag flying

Mistreated far too long
Just the opposite of adulation
But we're rising to this song
Never fear, the used generation

Thrown out, locked down
We'll never be the same (hey) again
We're running through them
Shut down, locked out
Get ready for the end (hey)
To make its retribution

Forget what the world thinks
We are the chosen
We live. To ride
Our freak flags flying
Nobody owns you
Fight to be free
Put see your hands up
And your freak flag flying

With your metal masks on
And boots laced tight
Let me see your hands up
And your freak flag fly

Forget what the world thinks
We are the chosen
We live. To ride
Our freak flags flying
Nobody owns you
Fight to be free
Put see your hands up
And your freak flag flying

Put your hands up
(With your metal masks on)
Put your hands up
(And your boots laced tight)
Put your hands up
(Let me see your hands up and your)
Freak flag flying
(Ha ha ha ha ha ha)
