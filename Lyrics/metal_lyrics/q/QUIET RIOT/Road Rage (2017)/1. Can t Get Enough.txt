Momma didn't want me
To be like him
Momma didn't want me to know
She didn't have a choice
She had to give in
'Cause all he ever wanted
Was to rock n' roll

Daddy was a greaser and a
Rambling man
Daddy wasn't under control
We couldn't get a hold
We didn't understand
He put the pedal to metal
Got addicted to the road

People try to get along
But didn't go there
I took another road
Don't give me the noose
You give me that no disrespect
I'm coming back
You're outta track
Not in it for you
I'll win and I'll lose but

(I can't get enough) of these illusions
(I can't get enough) of this life
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Give me what you wanna
I'm here for the fight and the love
And I can't get enough

Momma had to give in to madness
Momma got a hand-me guitar
A product of abandoning
6 strings to callus me
Knew what I wanted
Didn't know what for

Daddy, he was running
From something
Daddy chased the dragon too far
I'm picking up his pieces
I know what I believe in
Makin' daddy proud and mamma's never too far

People try to get along
But I didn't go there
I took another road
Don't give me the noose
You give me that no disrespect
I'm booming back
You're outta track
Not in it for you
I'll win and I'll lose but

(I can't get enough) of these illusions
(I can't get enough) of this life
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Give me what you wanna
I'm here for the fight and the love
And I can't get enough

(I can't get enough) of these illusions
(I can't get enough) of this life
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Give me what you wanna
I'm here for the fight and the love
And I can't get enough

18 years ago
I thought I'd never relate
But now those days are gone
We're here for the day
I'm coming in late

(I can't get enough) of these illusions
(I can't get enough) of this life
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Give me what you wanna
I'm here for the fight and the love
And I can't get enough

(I can't get enough) of these illusions
(I can't get enough) of this life
Tell you what I'm gonna do
Give me what you wanna
I'm here for the fight and the love
And I can't get enough
