Line up all degenerates
Just to prove their innocence
In this the world we're born
To fall into?
Bow down like an animal
Scavenging to feed their rule
Feelings lost for fear
They'll take us all

Freedom comes
Not far away

Keep your violence
We won't fight it anyway
We stand silent
It's not our problem
Your reliance
Will fall down in disarray
And in silence
We're rising, renegades

We're marching on
Marching on
For the sake of heart
Together we stand
Never torn apart
Shreds of hope they are sewn to burn the light
Reign down, from the sky
Like meteors
Staring death in the eyes
You'll be feeling yours
Never ending
Never dying for a lie

Freedom comes
Not far away

Keep your violence
We won't fight it anyway
We stand silent
It's not our problem
Your reliance
Will fall down in disarray
And in silence
We're rising, renegades
