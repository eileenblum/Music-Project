Ooooo, Just a mean black set of wheels
What it takes to get me off
I'm gonna drive all night
Spin my wheels of light
It feels all right
It feels all right

I don't need no drivers license
I'm too reckless to survive
It's like a carburetor instigator
Feels all right
Feels all right

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac
It's got solid gold hubcaps
It makes me feel like a king
I only need one thing
And that's a Slick Black Cadillac (get it up)

Slow down

You know I got a fully equipped rock 'n' roll machine
At speeds that take me high, high, high
At dead man's curve
I only hear one word drive, drive, drive
Drive, drive, drive

My machine is making headlines
It gives me love and everything
It's like an institution of revolution
It feels all right
Feels all right

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac
It's got solid gold hubcaps
It makes me feel like a king
I only need one thing
And that's a Slick Black Cadillac (pull over, woooo)

Cadillac, Cadillac, Cadillac

Got the coppers on my trail
Just for me an A.P.B., yeah yeah
The sirens spinnin'
It's me who's winnin'
There're after me
There're after me

Oh, I know just what happened
I disappeared to their surprise
I got a Cadillac marquee by my back
And I don't mind
No, I don't mind

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac
It's got solid gold hubcaps
It makes me feel like a king
I only need one thing
And that's a Slick Black Cadillac (wait a minute)

Slick Black Cadillac
It's got solid gold hubcaps

Slick Black Cadillac

I lay it down, spin em wide and get laid in back, oh yeah

Drivin' in a Slick Black Cadillac
It makes me feel like a king, alright!
