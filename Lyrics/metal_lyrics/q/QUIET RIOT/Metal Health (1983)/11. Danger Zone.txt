[Bonus Track]Watch out !

I'm back on the streets again
Breaking the law
Reason apart tell me just
Search for me once more

Oh, no, try to lock me in my room
Oh, no, and throw away the key
Oh, no, they think they've found the missing link tonight
They're out to be

In the danger zone
The sky is black
In the danger zone
I he growing crack
In the danger zone
And lightning strikes my brain

Count me once forget me twice
My old rockers are here tonight
The world is out, the time us right
Run ahead and take a bite

Oh, no, it doesn't really beat you
It's just another scare
They're only to bleed you
Step up and take what you can

In the danger zone
The sky is black
In the danger zone
I he growing crack
In the danger zone
And lightning strikes my brain

In the danger zone
There's no way out
In the danger zone
You're running round and round
In the danger zone
There's nothing you can do
No, no, no, no

On the run
Out in the cold
On the run
In the danger zone

On the run
On my own
Out in the cold
In the danger zone

In the danger zone
The sky is black
In the danger zone
I he growing crack
In the danger zone
And lightning strikes my brain

In the danger zone
There's no way out
In the danger zone
You're running round and round
In the danger zone
There's nothing you can do

In the danger zone
You got nowhere to hide
In the danger zone
You know you're trapped inside
In the danger zone
There's nothing you can do

In the danger zone
