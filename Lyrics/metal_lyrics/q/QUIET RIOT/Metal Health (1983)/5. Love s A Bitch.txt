Oh!...oh!

Loves got me by the ass again
I've been in love since I don't know when
I keep a-runnin' and I don't know why
Love's givin' me a crock of lies
Out of breath and I'm out of time
Misery is what I find

Love's a bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, yes it's crazy
Love's a bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, yeah it's crazy
Love's a bitch!

Like a cat with diamond eyes
Love's power it can hypnotize
Done me in (ha)
More than twice
She'll make you think that it's over night
Your all alone in a room that's wrong
Your body shakes
Your feet are cold

Love's a bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, yeah it's crazy
Love's a bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, yes it's crazy
Love's a bitch! (whoa, ooh ooh, yes it is)
(Oh, oh, oh)

Such a bitch (oh)

Don't you wait, don't stand still
Gotta keepa movin' or you'll pay the bill
Go by car, go by train
You gotta keepa runnin' or you'll feel the pain
Keepa runnin', keepa runnin'

Love's a bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, yes it's crazy
Love's a bitch, bitch, bitch, baby
Love's a bitch, it's crazy
Love's a bitch! (NO!)
It's a bitch!!!!
