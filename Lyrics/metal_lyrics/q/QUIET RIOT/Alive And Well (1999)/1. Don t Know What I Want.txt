Pissed off - Got nothing to say,
Nothing to do
Why do I feel this way ?
Mixed up - The will to survive
But I can't tell if I'm dead or alive
A no win situation
What can you do ?
Of my own creation
I don't have a clue.

I don't know, don't know,
Don't know what I want
I don't know, don't know,
But I want it now
Right now !

Hang on - Don't know if I can
How much can I take
How much can I stand
Tied down - By things that I hide
I bite my lip I swallow my pride

Emptiness ivades me
Tries to push you auround
Happiness escapes me
Here's what I found

I don't know, don't know,
Don't know what I want
I don't know, don't know,
Don't But I want it now
Yes I do !

Don't wanna go but but I gotta get away
Damned if you do
And damned if you don't
My cross to bear if I stay this way
Your power of will has left you alone,
All alone

Lookin' for an answer
I can't believe where I've been
Headed for disaster
The way that I see
