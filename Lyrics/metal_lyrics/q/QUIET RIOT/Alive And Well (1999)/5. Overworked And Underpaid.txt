I wake up-and try and
Face another day
Here we are-just another
Link in the chain
It's so tough-to reach the top
From down on your knees
here we go on this road-were
onlytryin to make ends meet
They throw you a bone
Take your piece of the pie
And reap what you've sawn
As we reach for the sky

Overworked and underpaid
Same old problem, a diffrent day
You bust your ass for
A minimum wage
It really sucks...your life away

Dead end job-from the craddle
To the grave
Break your back-say hello to the
American way
Black and blue-had my ass
Handed to me
The time card of life keeps
You runnin dead on your feet
Your taxed to the max
And knee deep in debt
Your credit is trashed
Still we reach for the sky

Overworked and underpaid
Same old problem, a diffrent day
You bust your ass for
A minimum wage
It really sucks...your life away

Gimme gimme, your power
And your greed
Come on come on, I'll show
You how it feels
Stand back, it cuts both ways
The table's turned
It's pay day
Get paid !
Paid-up !
