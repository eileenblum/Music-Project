Call of the wild has been
Draggin me down
Spirit controls what's inside you
Tears flow like blood
in a hot open flame
A sign of the fire inside you
We gotta give it up-We can't resist
We gotta get away

[Chorus]

Time stands still
When your having fun
But you pay the price
When the day is done
Kindred Spirits come one by one
When the day turns black
We will become-
The ritual

Down in a hole
When the sky closes in
And darkness will fall upon you
Walk into the light
To be free from the spell
Let the ritual surround you

Is it at the rainbow's end
Out in the cold
Is just a breath away

Time stands still
When your having fun
But you pay the price
When the day is done
Kindred Spirits come one by one
When the day turns black
We will become-
The ritual

We couldn't give up
We still persist
We couldn't get away-no
