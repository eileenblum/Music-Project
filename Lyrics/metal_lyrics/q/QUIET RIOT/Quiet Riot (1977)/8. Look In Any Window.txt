You'd better beware 
He'll catch you when you're unaware 
Look out, he's gonna stare 
Catch him, he won't care 

Look in any window 
Hold yourself back 
He's gonna look in any window 
It's a visual attack 

He's sly and he's sneaky 
He's craving for sin 
Open up your window 
Go on and let him in-(yeah yeah yeah) 

Look in any window 
Hold yourself back 
He's gonna look in any window 
It's a visual attack, that's what it is 

What a desire 
His mind is on fire 
He sweats and he pants 
The love he can't have 

Look in any window 
Hold yourself back 
He's gonna look in any window 
It's a visual attack (that's what it is, yeah... hahahahaha)
