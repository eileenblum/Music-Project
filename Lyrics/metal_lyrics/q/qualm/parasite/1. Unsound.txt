Awakened 
Dishonored and mislead
Worse than our bodies our souls bled

Phanthasmal thoughts blend with hurtful memories
Ascending fog that leads us to bane
In ravenous cold
A bloodshed that tries us shoulder to shoulder
And dries out
Dries out the vains

Could we all lie here dead
With torn open chests
Could I ever shed my wings
For the safety of a nest

Weâve lost the sight of what weâve been through
I see no way
These living nights of my dreamless sleep
Iâm without trace
Weâve gone astray

Beyond all reference
But sensation of pain
We are wizen, wrinkled, tried
Weâve been rusting in vain

Look how clear is the sky above us
See the valley caressed gently by the wind
Feel how beckoning is the distance 
How soft is the grass beneath our feet
Each step of ours that trembles the ground
Gets us more and more obsessed by fear

White with fear
Through dreams divine
Led ourselves astray

Doubtful triumph is ours
How can our hands still be tied
The heat feels to be expiring
Misbegotten sons of might

Weâve lost the sight of what weâve been through
I see no way
These living nights of my dreamless sleep
Iâm without trace
Weâve gone astray
Weâve gone astray
