[Lyrics: AOP]

Fall...........
Seasons of crippling pain as I walk the corridors of hell
A disturbing contortion of the mind revered
Unending hypocrisy when faith removes your eyes
Fall..........
Stretch your fingertips and feel the barbed shell of your prison
Huddle freezing on the immaculate steps to my temple 
Which lead in intertwining spirals to your nightmares 

Burn the havens that justify the light
And watch the smoke invite the shadows in
Shadows so deep they are infinite chasms
The foetid jaws of hell

A mummified god clinging like a parasite
To an earth that pathetically complies 
Shall be swallowed by that gaping maw
All that lives shall die

Fall and fall again into the horrific maze of your undoing 
To me it is a reflection of my supremacy
