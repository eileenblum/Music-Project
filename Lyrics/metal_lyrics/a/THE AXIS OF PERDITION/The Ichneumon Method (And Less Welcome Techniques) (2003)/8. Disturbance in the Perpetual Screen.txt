[Lyrics: Tetsuo Unit BRJ]

[Note: not all of these featured in the final song]

I, wide asleep at 00:13 or so it seems
As my eyes roll back to inspect the optic nerves
The walls breathe with my exhalation
Disgorging our insects to unravel your world   
My skin attempts to flee
A technological trail of vomit, blood and sperm
Snakes toward the rotten core
Maggots swaying to the rhythm of the universe

Tear my fingernails out from their tombs
Underversal architecture unfolding
The sky is pooling on the floor
A star or two screams abuse at my face
Reach down and pluck a thorn from my side
The placenta next to her upon the floor
Incapacitated?

A naked thought, incandesant and burning
Primal like the sun, nuclear
Will power beaten into submission
Instinct rise in domination
The insects are gathering to watch intensively
Creator of maggots rises, writhing and spitting
Pulls me down and in 
Burrow into rotten flesh, vomiting and twisted in ecstasy

Teasing amplitudes of nothingness
Spun from the unreality chambers
I visualise deconstruction as the paramount of my fears
Who was this place?

Interjections of god, trapped in its own creation
The unbeliever reels
Intelligent equations decimate divinity
Formulated infusions of horror

Peering in they are pleased 
The torment of the individual
Their weapon of mass destruction is the creation of new paradigms
No one saw it coming save the sightless messiah

And who gave it credence?
Who stopped to pay attention to a warning of cataclysm

No one 

And now the end is here and no more cards can be played
You have no one to blame but yourselves for your weak hand 

No one.
