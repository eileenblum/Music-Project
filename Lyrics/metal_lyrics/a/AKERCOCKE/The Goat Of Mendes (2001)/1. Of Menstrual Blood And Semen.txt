Goat of a thousand young
Goat of mendes divine
Under the sigil of bephomet
we pray of thee, we invoke thee
I orate with due clarity
our brutal philosophy
Curse the right of the altar
and drink of the chalice of ecstacy
Satan

I drink deep of my sisiters blood
Phallic benediction
Purify the air with bells
unholy steps thirteen
of ceremonial darkness
Utilize the power of Sheol
Satan 

[solo - Paul Schanlan]

I smite the blasting wand to thee
unholy steps thirteen
In the name of Satan ruler of the Earth
Grant me the power
Grant me the power
Of the forces of darkness

I drink deep of my sister's blood
Prophecy
(Incantation to the Infernal Duke Gomory)
Take them down
within the pentagram
come with me

Prince of the north - Belial
Eastern Prince - Lucifer
Leviathan - Prince of western shores
Prince of the south
Satan
