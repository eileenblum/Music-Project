Sister Cunegonde
Novitiate veiled in black 
Immaculate
Pure
Devout

Hear the melody of the night
feel the winter through your robe
Regain custody of dead senses
and escape into the woods
escape into the woods

The intimacy of the darkness
reveals the spirits strength
reveals the twisted horns of the lord
Demogorgon, the eldritch goat

[Sister Cunegonde:]
"Grant me a skin for dancing in 
Grant me a skin for dancing in 
dark master"

Proceed the path of Agarthi, alone 
Recite enochian canto, sister

[Sister Cunegonde:]
"Grant me a skin for dancing in
dark master"

and receive unholy jism
Goat of mendes Ahriman
carnal inspirer and lord
Infernal prophet

The scent of her hymen
potent and pure presents
temptation beyond heaven
and into Hell

Shemhamforash
The visible melts into the unseen
The abyss below Malkuth
Embrace vital existence
and the dark ones of the pit

Beneath the beast the naked soul
the visible melts into the unseen
between her thighs
such sweet delights

Rejoice in the fleshly life
sweet sister in darkness
Rejoice in the fleshly life

[solo's Paul Schanlan &amp; Jason Mendonca]
