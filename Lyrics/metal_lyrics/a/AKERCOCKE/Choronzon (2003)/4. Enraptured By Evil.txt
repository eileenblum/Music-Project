Beast of revelation
Tool of desecration
Take flight on leather wings
It is he that wields the black flame
Tell your king
That we come for him
I curse the cross and trinity
As the beasts have allowed me
To personify their Goat Lord God
The honour is mine

Coming for your son
To drink his fucking blood
And humiliate the corpse
Black messiah
I dedicate the blood to Beezlebuth
Lord of rebirth and evil
you must open the way inside
For Satan
Sacrifice to the princes
Of the watchtowers
Who opens the way
Speaking the secret name of God
Who dissipates the barrier
Between shadows that dance
In the candlelight
Whispering tongues unheard of
With language like warm rain
Without compunction
Entranced enraptured
In the heat of lust

Coming for your son
To drink his fucking blood
And humiliate the corpse
