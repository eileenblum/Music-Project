Mephistopheles
Extract from concealment
Enlightenment
A plethora of Cacodaemons
Emerge to defile me
Debase me
I dare not resist
But celebrate the pain

[Solo- P.S.]

Drops of blood fall in time
With the beating of your heart
Foctid breath whispers
Are you the messiah?
Satan

Lacerate the soul
Dissect the ego
Naked I confront
The sheer cliff face of sanity
On which I gain no purchase
Attempt to climb
And make no progress
I am a blasphemy to Christ
Am I Jesus?  Am I messiah?
Stone statue speaks
The winter of life too cold
Twisted Debaser
As the winds from the
Furthest reaches of Belial
Stir winter clouds across the moon
I hear the words of the master
For you and Satan

[Solo- P.S.]
