As the heaven shatter
Carries on the breeze
On the edge of the great abyss
In the pause occupying the space
That seperates lightning and rainfall
Not unlike the echo of murder
That travels on the wind
Satanus- summon the sleepwalker
The silence in a world that screams
Celebrate me
For I am your new Christ
There can be no Heaven without Hell
There can be no truth without pain
The divinity mirrors
Reflect her slender frame
The awakening avatar
With alabaster skin
Life with perfect shape
White and smooth
Eesome sleepwalker
You bestow such pain and madness
The like of which I can barely conceive
As sharp as a speaer
From the pit of my soul
To the horns of the master
Crucify me
If you dare
Sagacious prophet
To be with you here is to be alive
I want to hear the words from your lips
Before I dispatch my devotion
Into your eager mouth
She steals my breath and I fall
Beyond death
Devils await me
