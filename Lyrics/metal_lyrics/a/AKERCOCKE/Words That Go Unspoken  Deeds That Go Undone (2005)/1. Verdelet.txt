Inspiring men to envy
Murder and vanity
Nurturing conceit and pride
Hollow inside but dreaming
I curse this World
That it should keep turning
I curse this God
Who decrees that I should die
I will give you Hell
Avail the sins of the past
I curse this God
I will give you Hell
...that it should keep turning
After I have passed away...
âDo you recognize me?â
As I wake you from your sleep
Open your eyes...
âDo you recognize me?â
Nymphets demand coition
Aching for penetration
On this solstice night
A catastrophic cadence
Nymphets demand coition
Aching for penetration...
