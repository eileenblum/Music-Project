A moment when reason
Has gone astray
Suspended by threads
That begin to fray
What Iâve seen I canât forget
Yet the World keeps turning
Am I left without regret
An eye for an eye
Hollowed apathy
Weakened will
Emotional Mendicants
Blood to spill
It is folly to accept
These deeds unchanging
When itâs your turn to reflect
Youâll too late realize
A moment when reason
Has gone astray
Suspended by threads
That begin to fray
