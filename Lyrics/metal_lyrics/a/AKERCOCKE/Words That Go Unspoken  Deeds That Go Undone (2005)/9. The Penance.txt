At the threshold of the dark
Whispering adoration
Like the breath of a lover
Longevity
Even though we know life
Is perfected by death
Longevity

[Solo Wilcock]

Potent priapic protrusion
Thick black crescent of semen
Anoint the female devoted
Swollen breasts dripping
Coated tongues
Insatiable dark angels
Naked ecstatic
Celebrate Satan
In every eager orifice
Slick wet orifice
Insatiable dark angels
Celebrate Satan!
Within this pentagram of blood
âHis is the voice of truth,
The voice of reason...â

[Solos Wilcock, Mendonca]
