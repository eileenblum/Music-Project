Exact, total circle
Without defect
Perennial cycle
As Solomonâs temple
Percipient plane
Panacea to proportion
Suck on the breast of an Angel
Kiss perfect scars
Spread lips wide apart
Sweat cools and dries
Set not much faith in the crucifix
Holy man
A faith too young
Suck on the breast
The breast of an Angel
Her sweat, sweat cools and dries

[Solo Wilcock]

Suck on the breast of an Angel
Kiss perfect scars
Spread lips wide apart
