Believe in everything and nothing
My lushest of orchids
To scratch beneath the veneer
To see beneath the surface
Singular rose with a secretive smile
Calonice, green eyes aflame
To scratch beneath the veneer
To see beneath the surface
Somewhere in between
The idea and the action
Everything is real

[Solo Mendonca]

Dissolving in darkness
And autumnal embers
Wormwood and salt as pain
The goat that walks as a man
To whom the debt must be paid
Willingly or unwillingly
To whom the debt must be paid
"I lay drowning in the Euphrates
When history was young
Sinking amongst sephira
Perfect portrait in perpetuity
Of human war without end"
Buxom Calonice, Green eyes aflame
Irresistible breasts
Cumbersome, imposing
I lay drowning in the Euphrates
When history was young
Amongst sephira
