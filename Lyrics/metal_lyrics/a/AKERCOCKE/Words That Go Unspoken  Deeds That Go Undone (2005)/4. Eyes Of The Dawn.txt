"I give you my hands to your work
I give you my eyes to see as you do
I give you my tongue
To speak your words
I give you my mind
That you may think in me..."
But it is not the face of Leviathan
Staring back from the mirror
Elusive serpent with eyes of the dawn
Is it not Luciferi that kisses
The tips of her fingers
Shining one among stones of fire
It is not the whisper from Belial
I shall exercise my right to be hateful
Cleanse the tired mind
Protect this fragile mind
For it falls upon me
To break the seventh seal
To break the seventh seal
"I give you my hands
To do your work
I give you my mind
That you may think in me..."
