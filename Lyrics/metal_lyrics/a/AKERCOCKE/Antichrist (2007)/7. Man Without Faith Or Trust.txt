Walking on water
Water into wine

Fear is the opiate that inspires

Clotted screams to scab
Never ceasing repeating

Silence words of righteousness
Fill the angels mouth
The angels mouth.....
Fuck the mouth

[Solo Mendonca]

Immerse the soul in oblivion
An abyss of hallucinations
With time standing still
Standing still

Waiting patiently
Waiting patiently
Under a Judas goatskin
Waiting patiently

To catch the life you throw away
With time standing still
Observe chaos in action
Confront the real and ideal

[Solo Wilcock]
