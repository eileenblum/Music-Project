Master, take wing over the desert
And parched land
Master, the art of suffering
A divine dance

Summon The Master...

Mouth incendiary evocation
Black flame engulfs
Filth and maggots of humanity
Hair burning, faces melt

Summon!
Master!

The inexhaustible beauty
The incomparable gift
Satan has made to the human race
In his only child
Antichrist

[Solo Wilcock]

Mouth incendiary evocation
Black flame engulfs
Filth and maggots of humanity
Hair burning, faces melt

Obscene ritual
Totems sacrosanct
Divine Baphomet
Worship the Goatlord
Divine Lucifer
Worship the Goatlord

Swarming, the spirits of the pit
Infernal, arise from the abyss
Absonant, within the pentagram
Ritually summon the Antichrist

The wings of The Master...
