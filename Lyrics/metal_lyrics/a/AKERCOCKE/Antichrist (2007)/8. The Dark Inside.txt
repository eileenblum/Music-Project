Drink the blood
Shadows cast
Formless flesh
Your disguise

Divine Hell
Ritual
Crush your shape
Unholy dance

The captive angel
Flailing still
Inside the dark
The dark inside
Taste of the necrotic cadaver

See the blood
Obscene prayer
Intoxicate
Seraph pure

Evil Sublime
Agony
Purified by
My perversion

The captive angel
Flailing still
Inside the dark
The dark inside
Taste of the necrotic cadaver

A perfect suggestion
You understand despite
The words you can really hear
My carnal intention
Unfolds before your very eyes

The night is cold and clear
I cast my gaze to see
Your voice is warm and near
But it means nothing to me
Sea breeze turns to gale
It's harder now to see
Your words are like a veil

Hours drip by
Time burning
Your wine spills from
The glass you barely hold
Disrobing
Sublimely
Reaching down to claim the prize

The night is cold and clear
I cast my gaze to see
Your voice is warm and near
But it means nothing to me
Sea breeze turns to gale
It's harder now to see
Your words are like a veil
But they mean nothing at all

Breathing
Scratching
From the inside

Untouchable
Unreachable
Uncertainty

[Solo Mendonca]

The night is no disguise
The darkness is a mirror

I was feeling blind
Everything seemed new to me
You made up my mind
Lies were really truth you see
