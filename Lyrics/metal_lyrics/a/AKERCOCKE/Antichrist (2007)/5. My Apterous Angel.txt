If I couldn't see before
I see quite clearly now
This world opens up to me
Wretched and insincere

Further regressing
Into the arms of the delusional
Traditions, religions
Of perpetual mendacity

In deference to
A non-existent God
Souls hesitant and full of fear

A death culture
Dead culture
Sacrament of Holy Orders
Of infamous artifice

The testament of Man
Meeting his monsters

Should we choose to listen
Should we choose to see

Adding clarity and focus
(of) what you are
What you want to be

The subtle distinction
Between human and inhuman

And if couldn't see before
I see quite clearly now
I see quite clearly now

Should we choose to listen
Should we choose to see
