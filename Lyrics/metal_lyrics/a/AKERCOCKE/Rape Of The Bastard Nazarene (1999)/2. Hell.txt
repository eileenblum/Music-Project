Melting into the crowd, the basaclica
the bells of rome proclaming
in the mid-day heat

"Hosanna! Holy Father! Benedictus!"
the face of a man who never considered an angel...

sint mihi dei acherontis propitii, valeat
numen triplex jehovae
may the gods of acheron look with favour upon me
away with the spirit of the three fold Jehovah

a sleep like the ages 
a sleep like death 
like gog and magog
blood flowing like dreams

black stole and black chasuble. black cope
angelic perfection
perfect pope murder

pre-sanctification
Hell. God. Devil. Amen. Hey.

a sleep like the ages
a sleep like death
like gog and magog
blood flowing like dreams

pre-sanctification
Hell. God. Devil. Amen. Hey.

hereupon, I defy God and his Christ 
the angels of heaven 
rejecting all that lives in gods name

death is meaningless, pain is endless
satanic succubus

profane, deranged
we descend into the catacombs...
