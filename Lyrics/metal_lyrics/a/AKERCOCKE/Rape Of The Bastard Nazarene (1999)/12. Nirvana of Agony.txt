[bonus track]

Adorn and embellish
Holy idol macabre
Kneel prostrate before
The icon twisted
Agony...
Corruption of the Eucharist
Lord of lies
I spake the truth
Prayers for chastisement
Raping minds
To twist the Nazarene
Divine corruption
The purest evil
Delightful molestation
How beautiful the virgin mother lies
Bathed in blood in semen
The brutal abuse
Of the holy homonculus
You see, cringing filth
Your God hasn't saved you
Crudely tearing the Christian flesh
Of the mother
So we may consume the food of dog
The malformed child of Christ
...Mother and child lay brutalised...
Pleasure of perishment
Evangelical charlatans
Cult of Lies
Instigate Zamiels rise...
