Cold eyes, full of steppes
And wolves and snow
Grey eyes, lifeless sight
Poison of God
Kether, Chokmah, Binah
The nightmare pulse exposed
My ego dissipating
The great abyss absolves
My sybaritic mind
"I feel the unclean adoring me!"
I sense the collapse of reason within me
Nothingness, emptiness
Unbecoming, un-being
The disunion of the reflection
Decomposition
Manifest Mephistopheles
Manifest...
Shadow face in the image of God
In the body of Christ
Midnight Angelus
"Who is the damned?
 Who is the saved?"
Depart thou cursed faceless one
Dark allure, different voices
But the same song
The succubae sing for me
Kether, Chokmah, Binah
