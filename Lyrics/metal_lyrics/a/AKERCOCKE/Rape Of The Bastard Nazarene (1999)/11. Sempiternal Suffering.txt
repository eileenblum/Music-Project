[bonus track]

Satan, In your name
Pestilential king of holy Hell
Satan, Archaic overlord
 From the divine pit of Hell
Mesmerised, entranced
Your warmth
The heat of our blood
Spewing forth
Willingly i defile myself
And am defiled
To dance barefoot
Upon cold flagstones
To the cacophony of twisted fate
Pray tell the priest will hear me
Drowning on dry land
I am obscene, I am unclean
Your flesh betters the void
Willinglt i defile myself
And am defiled
And this is my bidding
And this is my...
O Sempiternal majesty
Dissipate the refulgent force
His omnipotence.
Black Messiah
Twist our flesh to your evil vision
Dissonance and disorder
Destroy the weak
Ina rite of pain
Broken, the virgin mother
As we rape the bastard son of God
Heavenly resurrection
The hated one has defied death
Although the seven years have passed
I will return in another form
The Anti-Christ arise
Evil beyond infinitum
Amusement of naivety lost
A hate that can not be defeated
Mesmerised, entranced
Your warmth
The heat of our blood
Spewing forth
Willingy i defile myself
And am defiled
The scyclad priestess
Raises the athame
High above my welcoming flesh
O sweet Lucifer
We praise thee
As my blood flows free...
