There's a place
To which I go
Far from here
No one knows
A pure retreat
Bereft of noise
Regain centre
Regain poise

Anger
Is just a symptom of the pain
Anger
In which so many years were lost

But there's an answer
To it all
Requires conviction
Commitment to the cause

Beware the falls
Beware the pitfalls of the lost
Just don't despair
Many time we fall to rise

Desperation is fought with reason
Drag the threads out
One by one

Don't give up
Give up trying

The sanctuary
Is in my mind
A place to heal
Ubound by time

Individual to us all
