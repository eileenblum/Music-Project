In the movement from
Present to past
I simply disappear
There was despair
Beyond care
Now I must disappear
There can be no more triumph
Only defeat
Only defeat
Like a breath upon a mirror
I have come to accept
No more beginnings
No more to give
There can be no other way
I must believe, please let me believe
The memories fall behind
There can be no other way
I simply cease to exist
I disappear
A rain of purification
Onto trophies of defeat
