Means to channel pain
Catharsis in the main
A feedback loop
A fear of change

Hate, hate and anger
Born from wounds
Felt irrepressible
From ancient mind
Animal mind
Unleash the possible

There seems like no escape
The toughest choice to make
Inaction spells an end
Chance what you have to lose

I watched the light grow cold
And felt my soul grow old
Yet I could not forsee
How strength would come to me
