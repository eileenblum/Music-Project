Climbing
Rebuilding
Lifted high
Absorb, achieve
Unknowingly reach a zenith
Change your perspective
Assimilate
Educate
Review the mode
Forging on
Achieve your ideal
Become all that you can be

Its been too long
Too long away
Shake of the past
And understand

When the time is right
Be prepared to toil
Your right to win
Dont give up the fight
From darkness comes light
Unbound by sin

Cast off
Your chains
Release
Potential

The will to win
Never give up
Never Compromise
