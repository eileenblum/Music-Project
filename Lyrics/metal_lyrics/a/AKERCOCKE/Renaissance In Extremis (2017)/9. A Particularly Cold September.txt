Essential pleasures
Curtailed &amp; denied
Desperate measures
Regrettably tried

The evening twilight
Close its eyes
Incomplete circle
Divisions arise

Being paid to keep the memories
No one else would ever want
Recompense for the sights
You cannot un-see

To fatalistic fears
The circle incomplete
Determined to let go

Rejected, decayed
Protected &amp; saved
From further incident or tragedy

To fatalistic fears
The circle incomplete
Determined to let go

Strange to be strangers once more
Palpable distance between us all

Strange to be strangers once more
