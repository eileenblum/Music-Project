A phase of life
Blighted by stasis
Suspended and hanging by a thread
Kiting like a spider
Reluctant to go

Then I feel my spirit rise
And I know it's not my time
I can see it in your eyes
This is not my time

Watch the blood meld
With warm water

Watch the blood meld
With warm water
Lassitude not sorrow
Bereft of feeling
Beyond despair

Then I feel my spirit rise
And I know it's not my time
I can see it in your eyes
This not my time

One chapter closing for another to begin
