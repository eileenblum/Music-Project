I can't breathe
From thinking of you
I can't breathe
From seeing the truth

Suffocate
Devoid of life
Asphyxiate
Now I'm blind

Veritas
Semblance of truth
Evidence
Without proof

Break, this wall of lies
Curse your intent
I, will defy
With heresy

Abort the bile
That you spew forth
Perpetual lies
I deny

Purity spoiled by filth
Pierce poison mask
Crushed by intent
Without mercy

Don't be fooled
Because I walk &amp; talk
Don't be fooled

Don't be fooled
Because I'm dead inside
Don't be fooled
Just dead inside

Emptiness belongs here
Here inside
