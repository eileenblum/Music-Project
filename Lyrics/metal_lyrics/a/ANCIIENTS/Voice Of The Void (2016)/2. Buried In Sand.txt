Burning bridges surround you
Mark the words, your world will
Crumble, become one with the sand

You had it all, but now you fall
Plagued by disease they vow to overcome

Burning empire below you
Summoning the vigour, to vanquish
And eradicate the ones who held them down.

You took it all, but now you fall
Abuse of rule, but now your time has come.

I split your skull tearing the heart out
Holdin your soul up to the sky
Rise of the sheep, who swear to prevail,
And witness the death of genocide.

Break the chains and live your lives
The dark age is gone

Thrown in to the fire
Flames melting your skin
Rise up from the ashes
A new age has come

Your silver spoon
Should've been poisoned
Erased from the past before it began
Snakes in disguise, legions of liars
Misguided wisdom
Now passed on

Break the chains and live your lives
Embrace your fate
Leave death behind

Thrown in to the fire
Flames melting your skin
Rise up from the ashes
A new age has come

No remorse

The day of the suffering
Breaths bile
No rule
As the bodies are piled
