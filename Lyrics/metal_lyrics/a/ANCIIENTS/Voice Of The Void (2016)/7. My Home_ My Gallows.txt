Brick by brick I create
A life I was born to hate
My home, my gallows oblivion awaits

Spill my guts, bind my wrists
The rope tightens

Place your trust in another
Put no faith in me
I will only abandon
What you want me to be

Spill my guts, bind my wrists
The rope tightens
Body of lies
The way of the fates

My home, my gallows
Delusions of grandeur

The path I take leads nowhere
