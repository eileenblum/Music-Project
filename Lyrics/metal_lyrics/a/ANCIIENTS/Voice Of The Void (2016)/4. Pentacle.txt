You hold the key
You have the knife
Stand in the doorway
Cut out your eyes

Ram's head grain of sand
Centre of my hand
Black wolf, writhing snake
Triangle of flame

Crawling out from caves
Beas now falls onto the blade

High on blood
Gnawing your tongue
Ritual
Altar of stone

Death's hand, sorcery
Bow only to me
Black earth, crucifix
Slit wrist lunatics
Crawling out from caves
Beast now falls onto the blade
Lamb waits to be slain
