Many nights I have wasted
Watch the sun rise
As my heart beats faster

Gruesome world my eyes see
Thoughts that race will never sleep

Hate the light, lie in wait
My curse is mine to create

Sweat soaked skin, darkened hallways
Stay inside, hide with my demons

Dangerous game
Can't get away
Full of regret
I am a slave

Hate the light, lie in wait
My curse is mine to create

Will crushed by disease
Losing sanity
Feel I have no choice
Following the voice

Damage done
Death roll
Blood soaked
Dead soul

Sliced flesh
Brains cut
Arms twitch
Eyes shut

There is no hope
