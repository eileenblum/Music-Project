The roots are deep
Poisonous core
Kings of the shadows
Speak with split tongues

Voice of the world
The mouth of infinity
Two headed serpent crown this cup
Of blood your destiny

Since dawn of time

The scales of hatred lie
Underneath your skin
Hands that feed
Will spread disease
And the world is bound

Ungodly veil
Infectious minds
Torturous power
Will form the lines
Now bite the hand
Drink sands of divinity
The golden thrones are turning black
Silence the enemy

Since dawn of time

The scales of hatred lie
Underneath the skin
Hands that feed
Will spread disease

And the world is bound
