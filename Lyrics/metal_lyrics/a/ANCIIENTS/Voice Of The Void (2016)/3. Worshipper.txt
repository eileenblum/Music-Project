Villainous realm
Down deep in the ground
In fire lit caverns
The chanting will sound
Forgotten souls wait
To one day be found
Drink from my wounds
Now you will drown

Spectre's of light form all around you
Drawing you in to steal you away
Taken from us pulled in to the darkness
Trapped from within upon you they prey.

I hear your voice
Come through white noise

Can you not feel the infinite anguish
Madness and wisdom are on in the same
Lock up your lies hoarder of hatred
Greed is your pride the essence you drain

I hear your voice
Come through white noise
Suddenly vanished
Without a trace

Wash the brains
Then lead them to the slaughter
Seals your fate
Erasing sons and daughters
Built on bones
Mass grave has been forgotten
Conceal the tomb

The entity waits its power grows stronger
Unleashes a wrath that blackens the days
Stalking the living
Now deep inside you
Mythical beast causing
Your sun to fade

In to the void, there is no choice
Suddenly vanished
Without a trace

Wash the brains
Then lead them to the slaughter
Seals your fate
Erasing sons and daughters
Built on bones
Mass grave has been forgotten
Conceal the tomb
Where they lay to rest

Stray from the path
Descend in to the gateways

In secret and solitude
All will align
They steal your mind away
Cursing the night
