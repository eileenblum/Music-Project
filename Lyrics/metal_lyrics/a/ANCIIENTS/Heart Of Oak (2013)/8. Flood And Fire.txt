The Earth shakes
Nature's fate
Creeping death
Beneath the sea
Destruction waits

Minds awake 
Crrashing waves
Seeking death
Beneath the sea
The life will fade

Wish someone
Could save you
Buth there is no hope
If someone
Could save you now
Would you
Walk through the

Flood of fire
Drowning decay
Waves of vengeance
No life is saved

dead waves
Blood reigns
