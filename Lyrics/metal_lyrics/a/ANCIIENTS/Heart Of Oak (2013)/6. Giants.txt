Behold the giants
On the horizon
They cast their shadows
Upon the world
Over the wall of your mind
Such beauty exists

I'm flying through
An endless midnight
Armed with
weaons of light
Over the rings
Of fire and smoke
the ice planett hides

It's time to test your soul
Make their blood run cold
Over the backs
Of the giants
We will soar

Death to the 
Sun killing race
Crush them all
In your wake
Over the seas
Of endless ice
Immortals awake

Sundown
Gunned down
Surrounded by the giants
