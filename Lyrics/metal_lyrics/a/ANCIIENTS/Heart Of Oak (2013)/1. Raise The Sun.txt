Hear me now
See the sunrise
Walk upon the Earth
Rise and shine
Breathe out

Hear me now
See the mountain
And the spine
Of the Sky
Claw your insides
Demon

The future design
Will blacken the eyes
The spiralling mind
The pathways align

See as one
All is none
Reaching for
Passage home
Breathe again
Speak in tongues

We will rise
Choose the path
Face the eye
The light
