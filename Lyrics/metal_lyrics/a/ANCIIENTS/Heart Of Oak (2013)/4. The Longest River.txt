Wandering nomad
Stare at the Sun
Seek your forgiveness
behold the one

All roads lead to
The mighty river

Walk through
This wasteland
Crawl to your hhome
Stumble in darkness
Dust you shall own

all roads lead to the longest river

Fear the earth
Open your eyes
You cowards

Screaming from beyond
the sealing of the tomb
Ruler of the soul
The river running true

Rising in the east
The serpent
Is unleashed
Fills your heart
With dread
The river running red

Demon of the fog
Bound by the rising tide
Demon of the mist
Cast down by
Sacred light
