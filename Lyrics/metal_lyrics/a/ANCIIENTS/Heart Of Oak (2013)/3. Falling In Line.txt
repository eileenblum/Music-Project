Driven
Driven away
Immortal
Immortal slave

Falling away
Spiralling Ffaster
Alone in this place
My heart is my master

Cast down
Cast down in flames
Lost
Lost on this plane

Battle of eons
Changing of seasons
Baptized in blood
Defying reason

All we are is dust
Cast into the sea
Fall in line
Or face the wrath

Feel your soul fall
Through the cracks

Cursed journey
Broken honour
Monolithic
Quest for answers

Hail to fire
Crooked smile
Crystal vision
Seeking knowledge

Tear your soul apart
Show the world
Your heart
Chant immortal rites
Give the Earth your life
