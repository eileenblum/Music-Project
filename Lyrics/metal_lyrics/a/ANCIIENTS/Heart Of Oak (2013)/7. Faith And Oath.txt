The arth to ascension lies
Deep inside this
Mortal mind

Sacred law
Faith and oath

Thrown to the lions
Nowhere to run

My intent cannot hide
Through the eye
Spheres of light

Ancient law
Heart of oak

Thrown to the dragon
Nowhere to hide

Obey the laws of old
Crushing the
Serrpent's throat

Flames reaching
For the sky
Burning the beast alive
