Lost in space
Can't find home
Once were kings
On our thrones

Lost our mind
Lost control
Lust for fire
Takes its hold

Sail away
On wings of jade
You don't have
To be afraid

Stay away
Until the day
Thrones of old
We will reclaim

Overthrown
Poisoned home
Overgrown
Fortress of stone

Mind entombed
Face your doom
Seek the dead
Welcome end

We've been gone
For so long
We've been lost
Can't find home
