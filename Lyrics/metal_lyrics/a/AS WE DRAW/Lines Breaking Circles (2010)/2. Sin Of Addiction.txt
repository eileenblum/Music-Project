When your mind stays awake and your body cries for sleep, disillusioned from the pain
you're in way too deep. As the chains bind your soul, don't submit to addiction. You
can't escape the whole world. You're just looking for something you can't find in a
bottle. You live in disguise. Make a promise to stop now because you can't even look your
own reflection in the mirror.
A freak, a cruel lie, you've been fooling yourself in this reflection that you've justified.
Breaking these circles surrounding you. There's a great white light at the end. Now you
believe in the knowledge and now you're in the light. Breaking these circles. Don't
repeat all your mistakes again and again.
Still in the same place, your sin of addiction began.
