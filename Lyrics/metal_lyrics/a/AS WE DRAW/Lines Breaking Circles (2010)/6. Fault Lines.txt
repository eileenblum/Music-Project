Here, drawings are blurred, commotion in your eyes. Only one color dominates filling
all your field of view. You walk under water, on the trembling guts of this world.
You're too slow and the pressure is too high. Skull oppressed, lungs full of blood, missing air,
you're falling in depth and this bloodstream carries you away.
It's not a dream anymore.
Now earthquakes begin, pieces are separating following lines. Everything is torn.
World is in crumb, earth's bones are broken. Stopped by these ruins you can't leave the
spine which is the origin of this disaster, the cause of this failure.
We will all die in these fault lines.
Here, drawings are erased, this color disappeared. On the way to the beyond you just
can listen to this heart beating faster than yours.
