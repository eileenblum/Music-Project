Anger building up, so close to exploding, I am so close to the edge. No second thoughts
before knowing. My body shakes. The line is so close. Slowly starting to overstep that
line, my eyes start to tear up. Softly falling down my cheeks, anger invades me. Where
has this peace gone ? Instead the overwhelming sense of hurt and anger, and fear... This
ill temper I have is making me mad. I blow up and I don't know why. I wish for just a
moment I could handle it. It's a mist of despair in the undergrowth of my mind, an
undergrowth of fear, anger, and hurt. In a world hungry for anger, the mist of despair
is the only shield for a broken mind.
