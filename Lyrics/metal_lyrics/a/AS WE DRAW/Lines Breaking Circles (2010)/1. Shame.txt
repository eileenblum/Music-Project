These nights are longer, we stay under the flood. The sea is calling but nobody should
answer. We all have those lights in our eyes. So in the end, the truth will descend on our
head like a rain from above. Why are we waiting ? the storm has been lifted. Look up to
the mountain. The whole thing falls away. Just fight with your both hands, it's all
coming to an end. The suffering you'll endure will surely get your spirit in.
We were offered conscience at the altar and now we are flying away.
And all of the things that the world has told, I lend a deaf ear, we all feel the same.
This is an homage to a shame, a testament to an awareness.
