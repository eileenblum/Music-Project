I live in both worlds. Listening and absorbing, reacting and inventing. Colour and
textures speak and express myself. Dream and reality, now in harmony. Taking a very
black and white picture, trough and relentless, unpredictable yet hypnotic. Adding light
and shade. Burst of colour. Difference and waves.
Taking it and making it fly. This is what my dreams are made of :
A daydream on a stave.
