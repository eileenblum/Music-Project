Legs tied to bed.
Ass spread for my shotgun barrel to slide in
Ass spread for my shotgun barrel to slide in
Buttcheeks tightly clenching with fear of inexplicable pain
Pouring hot-sauce down the crack for torturous lubrication
As I twist it in as far as it will go, I watch your brain
Fly out into bits. I fucking squeezed the trigger too early
I don't understand how one head covers an entire room
Looking at the walls, I notice strung out pieces of your guts
I blew holes out your back. Now they're smoking from the massive boom
I blew holes out your back. Now they're smoking from the massive boom
Building a rage. You're dead too early At least I got to fuck your pussy
I empty my gun into your ass
Your stomach bursted onto the sheets
Yeah! I just can't stop playing with myself
While I gulp down your flesh, not chewing
I can't breathe from swallowing so fast
Huge veins in my neck just keep swelling

Shotgun
Blasts
In The Ass

I push intestines down my throat. They're so smooth on the way down.
I cleanse my face with your shit. Left in shame, you will be found.
