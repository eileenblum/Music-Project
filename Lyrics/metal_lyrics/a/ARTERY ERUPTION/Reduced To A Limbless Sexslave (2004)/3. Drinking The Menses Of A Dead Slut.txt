Drinking menses of a fucken' slut
That I stabbed a thousand times to death
Guess what her face looked like before this
You can't, cause there's nothing to look at
Then why can't I take my eyes away
I'm free to to do what I fucking want
Those who I feel are against me
Will die as I find them in their sleep
I wish I could bring you from the dead
You needed to feel each fucking blow
I cut out your tit to reach the heart
You destroyed mine, this is a new start
Chewing the arteries. Snapping the valves apart
I have taken revenge to the next sick extreme
Gulping your fucking juice. Lower than your level
Unexplained pain you gave. I can't imagine yours
Nourishing my life by tasting cunt cum
Drinking menses of a fucken' dead slut
Hydrating myself with chunky, thick blood
Savoring the pussy with my eyes shut

Arteries exposed. Veins pulsing blood loose
Wet and slimy pussy mangled by me
Ran over your body repeatedly
Covering my tracks of guilt. No one sees.
