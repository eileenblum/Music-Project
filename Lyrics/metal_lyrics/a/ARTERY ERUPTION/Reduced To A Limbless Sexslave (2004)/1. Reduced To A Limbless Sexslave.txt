Every time I see you, I want to kill you Nothing holds me back, now that I have no life
Nothing but true violence can keep me going
I sock your face so hard as I clench my knife
Realizing nothing is left for me here
Battering your back with my wooden ball bat
I am so sick of always being shit on I punctured your gut, to see oozing out fat
(Repeat all above)

I shoved my bat straight up your fucken' asshole
It disappeared up to the fucken' handle
You're a cock-whore, that just needs painful pleasure
Feel my cock as it enters your man-made cunt
I took my fun too far for your sick standards
My hate for you can not be put into words
You could never understand my fucking hate
Now you're learning, as I increase your torment
From my knives, you're made limbless
You're reduced to my sex slave
I will keep your wound open
Massive loss of blood I crave
I will let you die pleading
Still erect from your bleeding
With a grin, I stab my cock
Once again, faster I fuck
I jerk my cock off directly in the stomach puncture hole
My semen does not agree with your daily diet of cum
It drools out your nose, after forcing it's way up through your throat
It drools out your nose, after forcing it's way up through your throat
You were smothered with my hand over your mouth. You have no pulse
You were smothered with my hand over your mouth. You have no pulse
