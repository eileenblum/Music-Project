You spread your filth like a disease
Your home is Hell your mind is weak
You bite &amp; tear the hand that feeds
You only live for selfish means

Gave up on our hopes &amp; dreams
Only care about yourself
The more &amp; more I try it seems
The more &amp; more that I just fail

Fucking hate all of you
For coming into my life
Making me believe in you
All your bullshit &amp; your lies

No feelings
For vile humans
Fucking worthless
Pieces of shit
