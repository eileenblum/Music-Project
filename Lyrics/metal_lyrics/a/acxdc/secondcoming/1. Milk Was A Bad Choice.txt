We're just gonna have to agree to disagree
You say San Diego &amp; I say San Diago

Hey everybody come see how good I look
How self centered I am &amp; egotistical
I am trapped behind a mustache
I'm a goddamn glass case of emotion

Unique New York [2x]
How now brown cow [2x]

We've been coming to the same party
For 12 years now &amp; it's not depressing
I don't know just how to put this
But people know me I'm kind of a big deal

Milk was a bad idea
Milk was a terrible choice
