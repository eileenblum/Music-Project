Driven by hate
Fight to survive
Escape your captors
Gut them alive

Heathen mute
Silent warrior
Wrath of a brute
One eyes blood thirst

The imagined Holy land
In Jerusalem
If you live or die
You're still absolved of sins

Savage Christians
Men of God
On a crusade
Swallowed by fog

Convert the world
By the almighty sword
Destroy all life
In the name of the lord

Live or die
You're still just a fucking pawn
