Don't even know why i try
I fail to see why i should care
When all you low life parasites
Fuck my body into disrepair

All this hatred inside my head
I want you bloody i want you dead

You deserve nothing less
Than a bullet through your chest
I want to hear you beg
Choke the life out of your neck
Bulging eyes are torn from socket
Jugular stabbed &amp; you're spewing vomit

No more tolerance
No more acceptance
No more bullshit
Just pure fucking hatred
