Rip off all of my skin
Find something new within
Try just to not give in
To pain I feel again
No joy right before the fall
Destroy to escape it all
Create an alternative
Escape from a life of shit
I am trying to find a way
To stop my life from slow decay
Gave up on myself
Had to hit rock bottom
Created my own hell
An end I never though of
Im so sick
Of all of it
Someone please
Kill me quick
