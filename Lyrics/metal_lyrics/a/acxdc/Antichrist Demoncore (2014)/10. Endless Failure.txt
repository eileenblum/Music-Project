Nothing I do
Nothing I say
Nothing I try
Seem to ever go my way
No motivation
Too weak to be strong
I don't know why
I cant seem to go on
I feel that everything I do is fucking wrong
Like no matter what I try its just seems to prolong
A string of deterioration thats been lifelong
I just want to disappear and be more withdrawn
Misadventure filled with strife
How I linger I don't know why
Endless failure thats my life
Boundless anger is always rife
Why do I keep trying
