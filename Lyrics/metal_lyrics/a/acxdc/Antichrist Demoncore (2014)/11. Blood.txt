Life of greed
No meaning
I thank god
I have none of you in me x2
You are not my holy father
Ego, vanity
Pain, cruelty
For all your wealth
You've death, insanity x 2
You are not my holy savior
We cannot be bought
We cannot be sold
The land is not yours
Or the blood that we pour
You are not my savior
I am a false prophet
God is a superstition
Money is your savior
I'm am fucking finished
You're methods are fucking heinous
