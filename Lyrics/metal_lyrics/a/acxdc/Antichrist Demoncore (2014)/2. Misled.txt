You hypocrite piece of shit
You cannot
Ever say
That you're perfect
No one is
But it's bullshit
That all
Your favorite goddamn bands
Are filled with basic doods
Asking every girl they meet
On tour to send them nudes
Spending all your money
On strippers after shows
They don't want your sing along
They want you on a pole
Fake emotion pouring out
Screaming fake ideals
I may not be a perfect
But at least I know I'm real
Every single one of you
Has been duped by all the lies
I won't have anything to do
With your bullshit hardcore pride
Women have a place
Not just hangers for your coat
It's for them to decide
For them to choose their role
