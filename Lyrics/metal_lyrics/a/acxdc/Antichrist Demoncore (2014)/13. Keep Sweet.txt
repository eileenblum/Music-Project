Pontificate
Divide devastate
Isolate
Lie and manipulate
At the expense of your diginity
Choose your fate
Try to escape
Break away
Break the faith
Disobey and your troubles fly away
Cannot question any of their prophets
Sacred doctrine of you'll be punished
This is no way
For anyone to live
They always take
You always have to give
Time to reclaim your humanity
