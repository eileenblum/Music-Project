Fuck your self righteous egotism
Your aggrandized self importance
Just because you don't partake
Of substances it does not make
You the savior of everyone
Theres in fact nothing you have done
Stop defining your self worth
Based on lack of actual work
I don't care how long its been
Since you've had an alcoholic drink
I cant stand you enough to associate
Please break edge and walk away
