Rational fear of failure
Insecure behavior
Pushing away all negative thoughts
Cant overcome fearing all loss
Moving forward I have to try
My life is no longer only my life
All these contradictions that are inside my head
Trying not to fuck up and just do my best
Disregard my plan
Do everything I can
