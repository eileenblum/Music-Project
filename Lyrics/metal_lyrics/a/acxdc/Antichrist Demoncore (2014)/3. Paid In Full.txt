Blood on the lips of yet another priest
Lies vocalized in the sermon that you preach
Impervious to the shit you teach
Taught from birth in the ways of non belief
How can you say your religion teaches love
When you're obsessed with atonement paid in blood
Your crucifix sustained by all your greed
World populace hurt irrevocably
Idealize all of his cries
Identify with all his pain
If jesus died crucified
Its for the lies spoken in his name
