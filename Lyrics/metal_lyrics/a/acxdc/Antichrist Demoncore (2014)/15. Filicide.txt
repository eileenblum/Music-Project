Trying to save his soul
Your praying does not console
Your son is dying
You're wasting time
To make amends
For all your crimes
You should have never been allowed to give birth
When you don't have a clue what lifes really worth
I hope you pay for all the things that you said
About your sweet young boy who's now lying dead
Gasping
Searching for breath
Waiting
Waiting for death
A life is lost because you called him a fag
You'd rather be a good christian than be a good dad
Every passing moment slipping away
Because you told him it was wrong to be gay
