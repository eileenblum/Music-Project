No gods no masters
All cops are bastards
Cheap shots cheap slogans
Cheap art cheap tokens
Practiced rebellion it makes no difference
To all cultures that are affected
Excess and chaos
Don't help any of us
Organize and take action
Practice not fashion
Keep on buying whatever they're selling
Your superficial life doesn't change anything
