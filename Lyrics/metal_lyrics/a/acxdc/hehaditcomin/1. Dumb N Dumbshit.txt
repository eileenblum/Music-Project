Harry The Destroyer
Met Lloyd The Wicked

Their union
Was of Satanic
Proportions
Consider this
A story of carnage
Of a journey to Aspen

They went to find Miss Samsonite
She was the love of their lives
On the way they met some babes
Then Lloyd set himself ablaze

Responsible for destroying
Gave a dead bird to a blind kid
Have a horrible sense of fashion

The diarrhea flowed out of his asshole [2x]
