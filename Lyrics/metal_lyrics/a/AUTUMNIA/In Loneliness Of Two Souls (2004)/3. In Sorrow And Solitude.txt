Filled by the gift of human death
This grief is brighter the thousand suns
I'll stay with you for ever
In loneliness of two souls

By an image and likeness
Of chagrins and losses
To leave in order to return never
To leave for endless awaiting

In grief and sorrow
In anxious emptiness
In dejection and loneliness
There where you don't want to be with me

I'll stay with you for ever
But only I shall stay alone

In loneliness of two souls
And only I shall stay alone
You disappear like the sun
Not to be worthy of the human life
