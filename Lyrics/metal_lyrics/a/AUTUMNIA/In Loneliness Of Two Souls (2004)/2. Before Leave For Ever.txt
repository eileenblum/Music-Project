It's our last instant, it's our final sigh...
And someone from us will leave the first
in order to not return never
And in loneliness of two souls (to harden by sad recollection)
It's our final beat of heart ...one for two

Hopelessness of despair
Nothing happen such that will force to believe in the miracle
...Birth ...Sufferings ...Death...
This that what never to change

The fatal call inside the heart
reminding the anxieting uncertainty
This is like a final sigh before leave for ever
The dying away stars in the autumnal sky
reminding of death - some day it will happen
Here under this sky
Here on this ground

The mournful end of vital way
And now is nothing except the silence
And now is nothing except the eternal oblivion
...except the prayers that aren't comprehend for the livings

It's our last instant, it's our final sigh
And someone from us will leave first
in order to not return never
And in loneliness of two souls (to harden by sad recollection)
It's our final beat of heart ...one for two

The mournful end of vital way
And now is nothing except the silence
And now is nothing except the eternal oblivion
...except the prayers that aren't comprehend for the livings
