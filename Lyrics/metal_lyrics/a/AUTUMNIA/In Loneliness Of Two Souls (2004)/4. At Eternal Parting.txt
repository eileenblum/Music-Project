Into the grave...
Into the constant haven (of the transitory body)
...the eyes are closed forever
...the lips are closed forever

I any more don't feel your last kiss at eternal parting
...the eyes are closed forever
...the lips are closed forever...

And "where will cry and gnash of teeth"
Your tears will become the vivifying dew

Downwards...
Into the depth...
Somewhere far away from you
Into the darkness...
There where never will no light
Somewhere far away from you
Into the darkness

...the voices becomes more silent...
Your weeping becomes more silent...
And I any more don't feel your tears are flowing on my face
...Only the icy silence of a grave

And only Christ silently walks beside
And hiding the pain I following Him
I concealing in His shadow from the intolerable light
...Now this light will become a new life for me

The forgiveness of heaven let become my punishment
And the silhouettes of the relic to burn out the tearless eyes
It's the blessing beyond eternity
It's a last kiss at eternal farewell

P.S. It not I go away from here: it you remain here...
