In the broken mirrors of eternity
...your eternity
False infinity
...the lie ...is your lie
The paralysed reflections of youth are smoldering
...are burning down
It would seem : happiness so beside
...is so near

Pain ...in the broken mirrors of eternity
I will never see you .

The cold torments a soul brought sacrifice
...for your ...the only one
Hardly were seen the lights of salvation
(salvation ???)
The hope slowly disappears turning into a pain
...an intolerable pain
...in the broken mirrors of eternity
by your hand
It would seem: happiness so beside
...is so near

In the broken mirrors of eternity
I will never see you.
