Time is remain ...it is simple we go away
Our lives by one instant fly by through eternity
Remember me the same as you see me now ...for ever
What to recollect me when we'll meet again

...and God leave my hand
In order to forget me for ever
Pray for me before dug tomb
You see, I was your last dream

Any more there will be no light:
the sun never will rise again
And you more never will hear the words of my frankness

It is time to depart ...there, whence there is no return...
...and you will not keep me...
...Never...

But remember one: by this song I shall live in you...
eternally

Pray for me...
