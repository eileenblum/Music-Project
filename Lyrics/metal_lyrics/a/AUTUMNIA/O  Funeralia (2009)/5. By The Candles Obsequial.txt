I bow my head to your scorched feet
I kiss the ashes among the grey wreathes
Your sun has burnt like a spell...in my heart
Now your dream is eternal...like my sorrow

Your face is in my closed eyes
And angels turned back to me
They take you away
Your face is in my closed eyes
You're looking back at this place
Where I have remained without you

These heavenly epitaphs
My Bible is falling asleep
Forever...you are...
Forever...lost and not read
By my leprosy,by my defeat

...by my heavenly wax,by my candles obsequial
by my heavenly wax,by my candles obsequial...
