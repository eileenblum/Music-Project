Allow me to see you like the sun
Allow me to hear what's inside of me
Keep me on the edge of my grave
Don't allow me to look downward

Carrying away in myself the tortures in my bones
Falling asleep with the broken entreaty
Cover me with coverlet of Funeralia
...if you are...if you're here...

If you are...give me your hand
If you're here...give me your hand

Last words...a palm have touched the lips
Farewell...we fall asleep together [forever]
If you are...I pray, take away it from me
If I am...I'll never wake up again

If you are...give me your hand
...please...
