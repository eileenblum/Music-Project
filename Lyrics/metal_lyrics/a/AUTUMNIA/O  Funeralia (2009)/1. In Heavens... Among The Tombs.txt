The death unplaits your plaits...
My death unplaits your plaits
By the wind of eclipse...
By the voice of water

Don't look back, don't look ahead
I stand there ... praying to you
Don't look back, don't look ahead
I stand there... kneel down
Don't look back, don't look ahead
I stand there... praying to you
Don't look back, don't look ahead
I stand there...on the edge of your tomb

The death unplaits your plaits...
My death unplaits your plaits
By the wind of eclipse...
By the voice of water

And I wander here...in loss, forever
In regrets...grieving for...
Filled and wasted...in oaths and words
...there is no calm for me...

Cover me with your Funeralia
Disperse me with your sick breath
But...never look into heavens
I stand there...
Cover me with your Funeralia
Disperse me with your sick breath
But...never look into heavens
...on the edge of your tombs
