Once... our ways will unite
And will turn in one path of sufferings
Once... we'll become a flame of one candle
Which becomes obsequial for us

Once... we shall damn each other
Not halved the sun
Once... we'll become this sun
What to burn out each other

...but only not here
And only not now...

Hand to a forehead... hand to a stomach
From top to down... from heavens to the earth
From a shoulder to a shoulder
From right to left
From you to me
Three crosses over the uncrossed flesh...

Hand to a forehead... hand to a stomach
From top to down... from heavens to the earth
From a shoulder to a shoulder
From right to left
From you to me
Increasing the grief terrestrial...

...but only not here
And only not now...
...and only here
And only now...

Increasing the grief terrestrial...

We returns into this earth
The fetters are throw off, but one cross for two
Embracing the earth and eating the dust
All earthly poison and our bones
Forever here...
