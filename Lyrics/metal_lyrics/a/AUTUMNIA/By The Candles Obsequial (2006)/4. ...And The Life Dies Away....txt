And the life dies away...
Like a candle on the wind
Lonely candle obsequial
In my palms... I Am...

... and no more the light
Nor here,nor in heaven, nor there under the ground
Only there in graves... muteness and deafness
Only there in mother womb... I Am...

Now I bring a light into this world
In order to sadden it and make it lonely
Yes the light will arrive... a light of life
I?ll put out it breathe out for the last time... I Am...

The words of mine... embrace the sky
Incinerate them for me
For my approach to the line
There is no return... (but only a way of returning)...

Now the silence bless me
I Am here: I Am the one
I Am the first... I Am the last
Appear before your world

...And the life dies away...

Now the silence bless me
I Am here: I Am the one
I Am the first... I Am the last
Appear before your world
And the life dies away...
Now the silence bless me
I Am here: I Am the one
I Am the first... I Am the last
Appear before your world
And the life dies away...

And the life dies away...
Like that as you deplore me
Like that as you mourns by autumnal leaves
I already shall hear nothing
And the life dies away...
Like that as you deplore me
Like that as you mourns by autumnal leaves
I already shall hear nothing
And the life dies away...
Like that as you deplore me
Like that as you mourns by autumnal leaves
I already shall hear nothing
