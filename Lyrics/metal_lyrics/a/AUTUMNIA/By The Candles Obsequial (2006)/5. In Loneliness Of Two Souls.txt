Beyond the sky
So much away
There where you're not...
I stay alone... I stay alone
I stay alone... alone
I stay alone... alone

Beyond the sky
So much away
In loneliness
Of two souls

Farewell!!!
I could make nothing
I (too for a long time) looked in your eyes
I (too for a long time) couldn't understand that they're dead... dead
Farewell!!!
I... too for a long time... looked in your eyes
They any more don?t see me... but cry about me

You pray for our souls
By tears of the candles obsequial
We are so lonely in the death
We are so lonely among the misfortunes

Someone's grief was knocked at my window
By broken wings... by your hand
So it's disturbing and it's persevering
I have let... it appeared mine

On horizon your shadow
But the sun blinds my eyes
There can be I confuse?
There can be I becomes blind?

The first dawn alone with loneliness
Pursues me languor
There's no echo at heart beat
There's no reflection in my eyes

...there can be I confuse?
...there can be I becomes blind?
...there's no echo at heart beat...
...there's no reflection in my eyes...

I stay alone

Beyond the sky
So much away
In loneliness
Of two souls...
