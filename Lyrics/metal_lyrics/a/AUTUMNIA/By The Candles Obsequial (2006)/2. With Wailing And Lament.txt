There is no sense to search for hope in cried eyes
The mourning has held down us by the candles obsequial

The falling snow don't thaw on the cooled down flesh
Cold to a cold... now all is the same
The cooled down heart... (for ever), without pain and regret
The death separates what to unite

By widow tears
By widow prays...
...By widow tears
By widow prays...

There is no sense to search for hope in cried eyes
The mourning has held down us by the candles obsequial
The wrinkles in the rays of sun... so it's a lot of calmness
So much all remained here...

The falling snow don?t thaw on the cooled down flesh
Cold to a cold... now all is the same
The cooled down heart... (for ever), without pain and regret
The death separates what to unite

By wails and moanings
By pangs and rebukes

There are no words for farewell, the candles die away on a wind
Last touches to cold hands... last touches to cold hands
The sun falls into the ground behind my back
Together with last part of me... together with my hope
