You never forget "to live is to fight"
If you feel you're lost against life
Up your head and look to the sky

You don't forget to live is to fight
You never forget to live is to fight

The real glory is to fight for the pride
Lightness or darkness, no matter wherever you are
Up your head and look to the sky

You don't forget to live is to fight
You never forget to live is to fight.
