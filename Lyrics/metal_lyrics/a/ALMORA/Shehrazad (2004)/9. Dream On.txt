Sweet child you call the sleep
And look into the dreams
Listen the fairy tales
Teach the land of the dreams

Tomorrow wake in a sunny day
Listen the lullaby of the sky
Singing angels are waiting for you
Listen the calling of life

Dream on, dream on,
And you believe in the tale of life
Dream on, dream on,
Trust only your heart.
