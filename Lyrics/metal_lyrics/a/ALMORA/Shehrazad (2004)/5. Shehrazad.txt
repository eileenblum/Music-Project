She tells the tales from the land of the fairies
From the land of the fairies, and from the land of the genies
Tales of angels, tales of demons
Darkness of hell &amp; lights of heaven

She enchanted the sultan with her magic stories
And each night she told him the tales as the dreams
She was beautiful like the voice of the rain
Hate of the sultan ends the cause shehrazad's tales

In the thousand sleepless nights
Tell a tale for your life,
Until sunrise, one more night
Tell a tale Shehrazad

Demons and angels, heaven and hell,
Tell a tale for your life
Until sunrise, one more night
Tell a tale Shehrazad.
