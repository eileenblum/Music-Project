No victory without the pain and agony
No glory without fighting for the pride
No victory till rising of the honesty
Don't stop running after the right

The men never survive who are fighting for the dark
No one wins against the power of the light
If you trust in your heart and freedom's fire
You'll know the meaning of life

The rainbow is waiting for you
In the place where all dreams come true
The rainbow is waiting for you
In the fairies' land

The rainbow is waiting for you
In the land where angels smile
Trust in your heart and you must walk through the light

Anger of darkness can't bring you down
No resist against the power of the light
If you believe that you reach the lightness' sign
Don't stop walking on your line

The men never survive who are fighting for the dark
No one wins against the power of the light
If you trust in your heart and freedom's fire
You'll know the meaning of life

The rainbow is waiting for you
In the place where all the dreams come true
The rainbow is waiting for you
In the fairies' land

The rainbow is waiting for you
In the land where angels smile
Trust in your heart and you must walk through the light.
