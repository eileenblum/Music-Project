Close your eyes, feel the power of the fantasy
Into the dreams, see the colour of the mystery
Turn to light, cause darkness is your real enemy
Close your eyes and tell me what you see

All of those dreams are bright as stars
That flame in the twilight
You never give up to follow those lights

Close your eyes and tell me what you see
To have a dream's to wonder like to be free
You hear the voice of eternity
Feel the power of the fantasy

You remember the old stories in your memory,
Into the dreams, listen the call of the fairies
See the light, only you can change your reality
Close your eyes and tell me what you see

All of those dreams are bright as stars
That flame in the twilight
You never give up to follow those lights

Close your eyes and tell me what you see
To have dream's to wonder like to be free
You hear the voice of eternity
Feel the power of the fantasy
