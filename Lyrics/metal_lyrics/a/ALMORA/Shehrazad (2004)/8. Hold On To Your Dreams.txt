can you smell the scent of life
up your head and see the light
can you feel the heat of the sun
have a dream is to reach the sky

let's make something just for you
don't listen what others said

hold on to your dreams, hold on to your dreams
trust only the force of your heart

hold on to your dreams, hold on to your dreams
never surrender to darkness of the night

hold on to your dreams, hold on to your dreams
trust only the force of your heart

hold on to your dreams, hold on to your dreams
never surrender to dark

can you feel the wind of life
up your head and see the light
can you feel the heat of the sun
have a dream is to reach the sky

let's make something just for you
don't listen what others said

hold on to your dreams, hold on to your dreams
trust only the force of your heart

hold on to your dreams, hold on to your dreams
never surrender to darkness of the night

hold on to your dreams, hold on to your dreams
trust only the force of your heart

hold on to your dreams, hold on to your dreams
never surrender to dark
