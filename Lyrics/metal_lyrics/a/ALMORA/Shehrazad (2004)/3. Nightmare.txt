Becomes the nightmare
My soul is cold in the terrible night
This silence is wounding my heart

Infinite fear
Now it's controlling all my mind
The fear that deep inside of my heart

The darkness is hurting my soul
And it's scaring me like the dark tales
My shoulders are shivering with fear
My soul is sailing to far away
And it's fading in the nightmare

Becomes the nightmare
My soul is searching for the light
All i want is to wake up

Infinite pain
Now it wants to punish my mind
Lights of life are fading in my eyes

The darkness is hurting my soul
And it's scaring me like the dark tales
My shoulders are shivering with fear
My soul is sailing to far away
And it's fading in the nightmare

Fear, pain, curse and the darkness
Cries, tear, grief and the blindness
My soul is searching for the light
My eyes can't see in the night.
