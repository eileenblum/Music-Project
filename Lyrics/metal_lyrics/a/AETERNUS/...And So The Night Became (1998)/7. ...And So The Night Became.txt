Cold earth
Blackened souls blessed by etenity
Dwelling under unholy ground
Forbidden thoughts and dreams
Provided by strong storms
Of bold beliefs and black
Souls of immortality
The demons are dancing

Creeping on the path
Clinging to the fairytale
Which they call religion
They are slayed by our demons
Of war and hurling storms
These are human creatures
Of a filthy and weak kind

As we crawl up and out
Of our cold earth with blood
On our hands and faces
We greet our brothers
With horned wings and cold minds
The dwelling and feeding
It is complete
Now we rise
