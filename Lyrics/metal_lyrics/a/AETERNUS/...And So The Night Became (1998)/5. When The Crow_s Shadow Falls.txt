At dusk a stillness falls
Defeated warriors seized from life
Shielding the landscape, they lie
As legions have before them

The crow spirals down
From it's tower of dominion
It's eternal quest is the blood of the slain
It sees battles, victories and visions foretold
It's eyes hold the secrets of eternity

Devouring warriors 
Seeking spilled blood
The triple figure of war shall arise
A shape of black shadows
And wind blown leaves
It shall sweep the endless domain

Snowflakes soar on the northern wind
Figures transform to crystal and ice
The voice of the future
Cries out across the land

I am the wind that rolls from the sea
I am the darkness that cloaks your soul
I am the whisper that drifts through the trees
I am the fate that compels you all
