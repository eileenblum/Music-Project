My pale soul
Shines under my moon
On one of my bold mountains
I stand
I hold my torch high
Up against my black sky
The skulls in my belt
Glow in the light of the moon
As does my sword
More and more as the unpure blood
Runs off and down on my bold strong mountain
It runs

My mountain drinks
It calls the rain
It calls my father
Brutally they come

As thunder
They slam their powers
Deep into my pale soul
I scream in pain and lust
My wind brings the rain
From my mighty oceans
My black sky is still clear
I scream and laugh

As I dance the dance of war
Under my moon
In my storm
On one of my seven mountains
