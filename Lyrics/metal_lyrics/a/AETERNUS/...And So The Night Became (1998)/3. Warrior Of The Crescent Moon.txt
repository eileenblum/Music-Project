In shimmering circles of silver light
In icy wind and spitting fire
Through flowing stream and ancient mountain
Thou alone dost see me

By lightning, thunder, hail and wind
I conjure thee
By sword of fire that can never fail
I conjure thee

I fall into the dark ravine
The clash of swords fills my spirit
Thou who shinest by night on the see
Casts the shadow of the arc over my soul

By ravens wings and serpents venom
Bestow your gifts upon me
By eye of wolf and dragons flame
Grant me your strength

I scream
The ravens battlecry
The powers of old embrace me
The arc of the crescent moon
Casts a shadow over my soul
