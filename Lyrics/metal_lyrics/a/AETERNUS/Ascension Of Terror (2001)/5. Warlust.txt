i break the chains that holds the storm
i feel its pulse it hammers the sky

volcanic winds of blooded rage
mind tearing frost
shall provide brutal death
once again you shall feel
the darkened realms
warriors

by our will you will kneel
beneath us you will always stand
your poisoned soul belongs to me

war - war - war
warlust

remembrance
we know you know the pain
intensified it shall become

drenched the fields of war
know what we possess

dimensions of pain
intensified suffering
dimensions of pain
intensified suffering

volcanic winds of blood red rage
mind tearing frost
shall provide brutal death

by our will you will kneel
beneath us you will always stand
your poisoned souls belongs to me

war - war - war
warlust

remembrance
we know you know the pain
intensified it shall become
