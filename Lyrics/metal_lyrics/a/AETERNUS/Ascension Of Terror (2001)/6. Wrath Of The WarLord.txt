time for gathering
beware of the barriers they are weak
blinded we were led astray
behold as the truth of might returns

manipulation
open your eyes and see your failure
the whirlwinds of my destiny
blackened might
the eternity has no throne for you

you pretended to be a god
you carved lies into minds
now the lies shall die with you
i will show you the face of a god
the wary lust for torture
roars inside of me

now you will die
the whirlwinds of your destiny
feel the blade of fire
as it cuts your mortal soul

fragile souls yet blessed by eternity
find strength in unity
there is none above and none beneath
you are the gods
the lords and queens of darkness
and glorified immortality
