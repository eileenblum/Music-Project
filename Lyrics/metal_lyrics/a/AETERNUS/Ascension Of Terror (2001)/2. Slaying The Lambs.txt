i walk the landscape
as a newborn plague
i see the land infested
by gods holy worms
scattered around they lie
christ's soldiers

untameable flames rage
over distant horizons
shades roar across the crimson sky
demons - seeking their prey
christ's lambs

ash - death - fire - chaos
see the murdered children
their faith in christ
being crushed by darkness
natures truth

mortals and nightmares
blood and bones
flames and corpses
the world burning
in a merciless godless mayhem

piles of corpses
monument of war
thrilled by the stench
of christian blood
mother earths men march
the power of darkness
glows in their blackened eyes
the lies of christianity
shall no longer be heard
not ever again
shall our world be branded
by lies

ash - death - fire - chaos
see the murdered children
their faith in christ
being crushed by darkness
natures truth
