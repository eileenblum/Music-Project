breathe the scent of death
tombs of ancient souls
lie in sacred forms

ruler of the dead
speak the names of might
hold the sacred rite

once you walked the earth
now to dwell in the
chambers of a lost
time

hear me see me
do my will
arise arise
from the realm of death

stand to judge
the souls
off those who pass
through your
funeral chamber

weigh the hearts
of those
who enter into your
kingdom of eternity

anoint their bodies
with sacred oils
depart your knowledge
from the sacred - scripts

command
your darkened
battalions of
messenger - demons

hear me - hear me - hear me - hear me

arise - arise
from the realm of death
hear me - see me
do my will
