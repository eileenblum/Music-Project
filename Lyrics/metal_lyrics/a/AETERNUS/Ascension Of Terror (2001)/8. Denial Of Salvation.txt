for all the thousands i've killed
for all the children i've tortured
for all the souls i've burned
hear a demons cry

the darkened lusts
you carved into me
suffocates the remains
of my human sanity why me
this i never desired

see me
free me
unchain me

this life eternal
is not what you spoke off
why this horned, grim face
this cold, black body
i want to be
set free

save me free me unchain me

i am a demon
i serve the wicked
i'm trapped eternally
now i must return
to dimensions of
rage - pain - war - -hate
where's my god
