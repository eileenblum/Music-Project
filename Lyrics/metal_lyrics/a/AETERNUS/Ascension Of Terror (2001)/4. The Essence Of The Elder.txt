leaving the dismay of the world behind
traveling in the essence of chaos
time and matter dissolving about me
a journey beyond death

your blood pulses with a thousand years of existence

standing proud before those who's ageless blood
flows through my veins
their spiraling souls empower me
visions of chaos
illuminating the shadows of old
as endless links weaved
into a web of existence
each thread providing a spectrum of lives

a union of blood, a union of souls
an endless bond sworn and upheld

i walk with you
over the fields you bled red
through fires that finally devoured you
through your dreams and your nightmares

as wolves we run
as eagles we fly

as your blood and honor flow through me
so will i honor you
through incarnations of strength
eternally

leaving the dismay of the world behind
traveling in the essence of time
time and matter dissolving about me
a journey beyond death
