within you it lies since the rise of your time
you've feared it ignored but truth never lies
its existence marked at the birth of time
the darkness inside
the shadows
that dance in your soul

to deny is to fear
embrace the darkness
reveal in its power
within it lies the harmonious truth
a voyage into the cave of shadows
yields the jewels of knowledge and wisdom

does not the night
and the silver moon
enchant your being

the caressing whisper of the night
no harm will come to those who are true of heart
look to the sun and the brightness shall blind you
stare into the black embrace
the sight deepened with wisdom

free your consciousness
accept the reality of darkness
it has never been a place of dread
knowledge and wisdom
is given to those who seek
achieve the empowerment
of endless mysterious nights
