i am hear to bring fear into your life
like the icy north wind i live
no matter where you run
i will be there

i will tease you endlessly
you will feel the pain
you will know my name
you are bound by might

i will feel you with terror
i will hunt you with delight
you will know i'll be stalking you
you'll be trapped in my cold embrace

i will tease you endlessly
you will feel the fear
you will know my name
you are bound by might

as my prey you will feed my infinite hunger
i will gaze into your eyes and devour you
in bliss i will shred your existence
beyond panic - you will - die
