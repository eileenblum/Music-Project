Destroy the life of grace and create damnation
For thine brethren hath forsaken thee
Their tongues hath spoken with split intentions
Uttered visions words that slithers down the spine

For amongst the damned you must wander
And conjure the seven demons within yourself
Hath not thine heart felt the yearning 
To unleash the hell that weighs you down?

The lesser of minds are the oppressors of the self
Sleepwalking angels blindfolded and pinioned
Thy righteous power that exonerates the seven
Is to feed upon the mundane delights

O joy be thy name incarnated by the light og the bearer
May his weapon of delight be thine evidence enshrined
Rejoice in thy name and welter in cardinal sins
For thee rometh again to pester and to create tribulaion
