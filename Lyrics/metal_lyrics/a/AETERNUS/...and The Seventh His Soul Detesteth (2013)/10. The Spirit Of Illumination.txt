And as the Devil splits open thine veins
A feverish rush of solitary rivers
Oh yes indeed, the Lord hath thee granted
And so thy will must be abandoned

Harken, creature of the beast
In the light of the bearer shineth
Alas, tonguesplitten lier in peace
Thine flesh is weak and tired

The spirit that worketh in the children of disobedience
The dragon and the tempter, the power of the air
The poison of God and the morning star
Lifts thine spirit high in illumination

Eyes turn white, the skin molten grey
Open chest with a black heart pounding
For what hath thee forsaken
Cut the flesh that are the soil

Ares: guitars, vocals, bass
Phobos: drums
Specter: guitars
