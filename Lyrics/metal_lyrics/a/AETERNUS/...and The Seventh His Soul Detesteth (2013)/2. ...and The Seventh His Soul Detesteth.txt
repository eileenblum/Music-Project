Take a look at the face of vanity and pain
For it is the fate of pride that the Lord hateth
Listen to the tongue of lies and deceit
For it is the tongue that the Lord hateth

Feel the hands that shed innocent blood
For it is the hands that the Lord hateth
Listen to the heart that deviseth ruined plots
For it is the heart that the Lord hateth

See the feet that are swift to run into mischeif
For it is the feet that the Lord hateth
Listen to the deceitful witness the uttereth lies
For it is the witness that the Lord hateth

Watch me Lord,
For I am him the soweth
Discord among brethren 
And this the seventh his soul detesteth
Watch me Lord,
For I am him that soweth
Discord among brethren
And this the seventh his soul detesteth
