Channeling your deepest internal powers
To obtain a state of self-awareness beyond the I
Sewing your eyes closed with sharpened threads
No greater the feeling than the sting of harm

Slithering senses as the darkness becomes a cloak
Colorless without motion to the world outside
What beckons the eyes of the beholder?
Than mere detest for the unintelligible

Forevermore and beyond all there is
Time is collapsing and the mind expanding
The breath doesn't  mean life
The eyes doesn't meansight
Reap the energies from the cosmos within
Eat the light and swallow the darkness

Then all became nothing
And nothing became everything
Then the mind fell apart
And became one with the earth
