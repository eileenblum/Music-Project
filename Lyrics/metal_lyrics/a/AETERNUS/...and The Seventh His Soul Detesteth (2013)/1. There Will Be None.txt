A shamelessness beyond any reason
We ought to scalp the insidious disease
To unravel and to annihilate the needless
To eradicate and to destroy in numbers

Raising monuments on foreign fields
In enormous numbers from barren lands
preaching insanities built on dust and bones
A disillusioned reality - a pissed upon life

I am the spectator with a wolfen grin
Rejoicing every death, every life deceased
The more the merrrier, the less a burden

Stone upon stone
Mountains of bone
My will be done
There will be none
