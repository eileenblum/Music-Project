I will smite whom opress thine words
For truly their tongues are corrupted with doubt
The manure throne are possessed by ifidels
Those whom uterth the righteous ways

Seperate the flesh from bone to cleanse
Joyous is the liberation of the mind
Existence must cease to be
Sever the bonds of creation

There are none above the none
And thus all are below the nothing
For man must in its fullest awareness
Speak and obey according fo him

Necroapocalyptic visions of withering soil
The light illuminates the earth 
The hand that severs the bonds of creation
Is the hand that rules the world
