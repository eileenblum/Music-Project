There breeds an ancient pride
Like clusters of blue eyes staring
Spitting and cursing and burning
Eating the face of God in one gulp

It wasn't carved in stone
Yet immortalized in mind
With forever burning eyes
And a need to conquer yet again

Could you see those teeth?
Grinding your flesh like the poison in a vein
Face the fury, face the ruin
Drown in the darkest of misiries

In a rabod fury with runnig white saliva
Dripping death from the hole called mouth
Resurrected for the Semper Aeturnus
Dead for the worlds without soul

Rise and grasp the horrid laughter's 
Rise and fall forever and for all
Ruin yourself with the decadence within
