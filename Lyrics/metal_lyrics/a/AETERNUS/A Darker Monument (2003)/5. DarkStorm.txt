where tie is tortured
where suns and moons are pitch black
where demons fear the darkness
where cold is death
mystic god
unholy wars
no honour in death
the black dawn is here
fight here to pledge your soul
the second gate unlocked
blackened might
see it rise
realize
deaths truth
mystic god
unholy wars
no honour in death
the black dawn is here
this land shall be scarred
battle hymns we sing
call upon our storm
it is time for battle
to open the second gate
to enter the eternity
honourably
to give ourselves
to this elder wind of might
to absorb and breathe
the essence of true darkness
fight for glory
no mercy shall be given
hammer their skulls in
molest their bodies
sound the battlehorns
for this final battle
mystic god
unholy wars
no honour in death
the black dawn is here
