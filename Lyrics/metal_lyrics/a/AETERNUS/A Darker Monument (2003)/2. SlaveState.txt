i have decreased your freedom
abhorrence and decay spat forth by me
i will make your living hell in this realm of torment
slavestate
i will nourish you on undying pain
teach you ways you've never seen
walk the path of my misanthropy
each step a greater pain
i am the air you breathe
i decide your state of consiousness
i am the world you see
i decide which ground to walk on
how does it feel to be a part of my one man slavestate
to be my only victim
from this day on and forever
