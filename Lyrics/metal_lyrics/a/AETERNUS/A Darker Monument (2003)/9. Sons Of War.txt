as the sky cracks open
newborn fear descents
hordes of death
led by two sons of war
born to conquer
born to kill
doing my deed
phobos - deimos
sons of war
their bloo burns as fire
darkened is their rage
as their father 
they feed
of the essence of war
born to conquer
born to kill
doing my deed
phobos - deimos
sons of war
watch them now
my sons of war
hate is strong in them
they serve their father well
see them spillthe blood of my enemies as we fight
see them concouering
the golden lands
like their father
they kill with lust
raise your hammers
an era has begun
with a newborn fear
