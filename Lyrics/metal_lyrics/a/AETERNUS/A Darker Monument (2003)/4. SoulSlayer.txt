i am the one that walks in your dreams
screaming for justice you will not provide
you always lie
slaying the souls of people who do not know
why do you do this you cowardly bastard
you cannot provide what people desire
lie after lie yet people believe
to me you are nothing i long for you death
forever in hatred
i will be stalking you
soulslayer
soulslayer
why do you do this you cowardly bastard
you cannot provide what people desire
lie after lie yet people believe
to me you are nothing i long for you death
severe is my punishment
it shall hurt
lie your last lie
as i'll crush your throat
never again you will lie and deceive our kind
none of my kinds needs your fake god as he does not 
exist
(slayer of souls)
