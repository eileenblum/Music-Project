i am a daimon among twelve
you say "you will", i say "i am"
the ouranic and the cthonic
your world will crumble at our feet
i can destroy all of earth
my mighty sea may drown you all
give us sacrifice, keep the rite
and forever you'll have day and night
none defies me in my domain
nor do i mock my brothers names
i am one in the cosmic order
divided in fate and honour
the sea is my weapon
the honorless my foe
the water you are upon
is the trident, conos' son
