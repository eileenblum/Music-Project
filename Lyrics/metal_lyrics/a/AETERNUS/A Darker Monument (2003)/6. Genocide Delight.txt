breed
the warriors
forge
their darkened minds
carve 
the runes of death
prepare
we are at war
we'll strike them down
we shall show them fear
within
we fight for blood
and they
fight in the name
of a lie
smell their blood
taunt their god
impale them hard
genocide delight
slay them all - kill them all
genocide - genocide
slay them all - kill them all
genocide - genocide
