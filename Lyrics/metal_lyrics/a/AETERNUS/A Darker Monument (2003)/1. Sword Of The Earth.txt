i am the creator of devestation
i rule the underworld and all above
i am your maker and undertaker
among you i have never walked
despised i am - still mortals bow to me
my strength and wrath
spawned of human hypocrisy
indestructible i am - no wars will do
untouchable i am - ruler of existence
flesh is melted by my blood
when i breathe - bones are crushed
my roar for revenge - thunderbolts strike
inworthy slime - wither and die
i am myself - no less no more
the symbol of might - the greatest one
my disguise is of many - you have never seen me
among you i shall never walk
weak and blinded, you believe in lies
my anger will dismember and devour you
i collect your souls and tear them apart
the sword of the earth i have become
i deny them
mirage-gods
i demolish
the labyrinth of lies
fire
wind
water
earth
i show no mercy
betrayers are slain
victorious and proud
alone i stand
resurrection through self-destruction
like a snake 
i am shedding skin
cleansing myself
