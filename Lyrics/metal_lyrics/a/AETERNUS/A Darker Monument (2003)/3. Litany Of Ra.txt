i am one of you
a vulture i have been
the falcon is my face
you'll see that i am more
i am one of all
all that we see as sacred
they are all in me
all of mans divinties
deceased i am from the mortal world
yet i resurrect in the depths below
i am many
my limbs are gods
from horus of the neverworld
to the weary of the heart
the mistress of the western desert
nurtures me with the strength i need
the gods have themselves
transformed into my body
i am entirelya god
no limb of mine is without god
i enter as a god
i exit as a god
