I drift reveal darkness
I feel see me glow
You give I absorb it
Close the door I seek more

Drawn to might I am
Judge me not I say

I crave power for me
I ask no I take
See reach out I give back
Unity force we dwell high

Drawn to might I am
Judge me not I say

Walk with me we shall wander
Dark and strong we'll never know

Drawn to might I am
Judge me not I say

I fear nothing
Forge the soul again
