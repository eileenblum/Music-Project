Far beyond the regions of the sun
Beyond light and creative word
In the level of the underworld
In the third dwells oblivion

The eye has lost it's sense
Darkness it's beyond itself
The abyss â neverending
Farthest depths of primordial darkness

The destruction of the body
Is the destruction of the ba
Effacing the shadows of the damned

To nonexistence

Where the sun shines
And no breath of life stirs
Where hearing and sight fades away
And the being itself is shattered

Before the black hole of nonbeing
In which the world will dissolve in the end
In the third step of the underworld
In the third dwells oblivion
