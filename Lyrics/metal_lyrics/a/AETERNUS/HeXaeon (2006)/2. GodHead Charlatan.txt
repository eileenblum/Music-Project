Weakling, the apprehensive tortoise bound
Tomfool, the wretched spawn chained
Idle, the oblivious indulgent collapsed
Infatuated, the duplicate of submission

Plains of flames, cleansing of vermin
I snort the souls of ash

Godhead charlatan

Coma suicide dismantled from witfulness
Loss of obstinacy, loss of power
Displayed in a pilloty to be mocked

All is legerdemain brough upon us
The reason of distrust and famine wars

I will be the leviathan
The pest of murder the rats of the ridicule

Revocation of the godhead charlatans
They breed like rats

Weakling, the apprehensive tortoise bound

Godhead charlatan
Godhead charlatan
