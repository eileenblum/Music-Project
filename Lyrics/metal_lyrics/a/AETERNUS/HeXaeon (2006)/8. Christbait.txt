Born abuser alone weak
Torn apart away bleak
Dreams of death needle seek
Loss of will addictive reek

Love lost sucking on self-pity
Dirthead, the lowest of lives
Filthbait, a grand statistic
Christbait, religious worms to feed

Exordium to a new form of disgust
Suction of life-filth into another succumed
Christbait sulcated vermin
A circle of submission into comfort

Body erused â trust in god
Weak flesh â weak in mind
Have nothing â subdued in lies
Empty shell â life is dead
