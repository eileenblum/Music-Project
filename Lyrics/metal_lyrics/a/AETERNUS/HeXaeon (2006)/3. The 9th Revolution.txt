In those days man will seek death
And not be able to find it
And soon after to die
And death will fly away from them

I... the man of many names
Will help these the human race
I... exterminans the angel of destruction and will
Leads man into his death

I will not convert from my deeds of murder
Nor from my art of sorcery
Or my theft and adultery

For I am the angel
Of the bottomless pit
As when time is near, will lead my family
Through the hole to my kingdom
Therefore I taunt mankind as swarms of insects

I am not the king of Jews
Nor I am a cult leader
I am what you've made me to be
For my inner eye lits my thoughts
My fires in your cities
