Puissance in the abstract
A band can't reach obstances
Mundane, such invisible pillars
The human horror obsolete

Abstract life and all therein
Implode the matter senseable
The will without meaning
Ageless the void of old

The ultimate throne of none-existence
The rabid dog of pandemonium
The king of martyrs and man
The condition we name nothingness

Absorbing the stars
The leper planets fall
Before us, after us
Aeternus â in aeternum
