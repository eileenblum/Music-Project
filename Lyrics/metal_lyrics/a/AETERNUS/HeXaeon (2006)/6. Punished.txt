Again I shall force pain
On you for lies maggot

Your false words grants you pain

I will make you want death cry out his name

Reality will unfold
As my blade sinks into your flesh
No sweet goodness â to save you from the pain

You are being punished
Through this dark pain does not

Rise form what you can hell

No hell guides me
As you I do as I please

Reality will unfold
As my blade sinks into your flesh
No sweet goodness â to save you from the pain

Punished godless abandoned
