Alone in the silence with the trees sleeping
I am waiting patiently I am waiting for the storms
Fresh and pure strength, I desire, and I will recieve
from the mighty storms fresh and pure strength I am waiting
My soul is empty there are many rooms to be filled with my majestic masters
strength now, as I watch the woods in the valleys far away
I see the trees dancing soon, I will gain my strength
Come, my lord of the storms I am waiting for your storms
come, my lord of the storms I am waiting for your storms
waiting for the storms
