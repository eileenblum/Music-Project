Through winter storms, be rode through icy mountains and cold valleys, be rode
fear in his mind fear of death this fight could be his last
one mans battle against forces of evil this was his destiny
He had spoken with the dark, the evil itself he could not be turned
and a choice was made in the realm of darkness to cut this warrior away
with his sword and armour he will fight the dark if he can.
He will be remembered for his great courage
he will fight for his honour and pride, until the end.
