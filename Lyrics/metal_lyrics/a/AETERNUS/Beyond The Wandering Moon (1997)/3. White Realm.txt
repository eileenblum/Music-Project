Ice, snow, cold, hear me now I am in agony I scream your name
I wish to speak with you all lords of the winter
Cold, come and freeze the mighty oceans give birth to your brother, ice
make me feel, the ice grow in my veins snow, cover the land
with your white veil make my realm beautiful
Wind, blow your storms dance with the snow bring the cold to my soul
fly through my soul with the lords of the winter on your wings
fly over my realm give birth to my desire give me a white realm
of ice, snow and frost
