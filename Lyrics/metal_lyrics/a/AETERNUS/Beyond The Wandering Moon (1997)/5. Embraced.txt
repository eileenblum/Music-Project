The mountains are cold and strong the snow is pure and fresh
this provides me with strength embraced by the grey mountains
and the strong king winter, I am.
I am the stone, I am the snow
I am the ice, I am as the mountains - mighty.
The eagles above, they see me, I hail them.
As they are my brothers and sisters.
I will not die, I must live to guard my mountains - my winter
this is all mine, I am their warrior. I belong here.
Embraced by the grey mountains and strong king winter, I am.
