My thoughts are dark they speak of deep anger among the tombstones, I walk.
The remains of my people is entombed here. There's no one left - but me.
I have sworn by my own blood that this undoing will be revenged
by my fathers sword. I will speak to the god of war
and my hail shall be heard
I will hunt these weak infidels. My people's souls must be
given their rest, they must be given their rest, I will hunt!
Through sorrow and hatred I will gather my strength
never shall I rest, until my dying day I will hunt!
