Castle of ice, a majestic sight. Falcons, eagles and mighty ravens
circling above guarding this enchanting sight built out of dreams and wishes
dreams and wishes from people of the mighty land
Sorcerers, finishing this bold creation see what they make
gigantic demons of hate a threat to unworthy worms
The wise men's chants call the wolves out of deep winter forests
winter owls, arriving and two mighty goats appear
to the gate they go, to defend the castle of ice
