Under fire were you born
Son of god and mortal
Under warrior's moon
Shining one of an age gone by

Throw the spear of destiny
Spill the blood
Victorious you stand
In flames

Live to kill
Creature of war
Divine is thy soul
Of fire

Oblivious to your mortality
Battle frenzy possesses you
By axe - by sword you slay your enemies

Ride through the night
On your blazing chariot
With torches held high
Their smoke spirals to the heavens
A threatening omen
To those who would dishonour you

Drink the blood - devour the heart
The glory of death shall flow through your veins
With strength were you born
With strength shall you rise

Carrion crows circle the skies
Hungry for the flesh of your prey
Scattered - sun bleached bones
Mark your trail of terror

Throw the spear of destiny
Spill the blood
Victorious you stand
In flames

Live to kill
Creatre of war
Divine is thy soul
Of fire
