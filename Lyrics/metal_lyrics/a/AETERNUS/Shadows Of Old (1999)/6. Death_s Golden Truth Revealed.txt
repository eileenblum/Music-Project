In solitude I stand
Awaiting a manifestation
A sign to cross the threshold of life
A spirit guides my way
Unmasked death speaks to me
His venomous tongue revealing truths
Reality stabs its jagged blade
Through my ancient heart

The last trace of innocence
Has been stripped away
Only burning hatred remains
A shadowed aura of my mortal life

When all that is lies
Has been burned to the ground
A purity unbound remains

To cross the threshold
To commit the soul to darkness

To cross the threshold
To commit the soul to darkness
