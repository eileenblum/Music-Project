The dark veil of a man's hate
Remains as the true glory
Within a warrior's heart

See the blackened sky
The ravens as they fly
Prophecy

Chaos and majesty
Revealed from the dust
Of village that fell
Under stormy skies

Flaming banners
On desolate land
Still - yet alive

Ancient symbols
Arise once more
Blazing - mighty
Empowered by darkness

Shattered remains
Pierced by deep earth
Dreams of mortals
Enclosed in flames
Ruptured images
Awaiting an end

The blood drips endlessly

From battle shrines
To feed the thirst
Of the barren war field

In union - yet desolate
In glory - yet sorrow
Beneath the skies we stand
Awaiting our reign
