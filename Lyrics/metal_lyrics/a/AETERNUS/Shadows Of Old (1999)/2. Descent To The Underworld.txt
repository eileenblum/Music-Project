From blood-drenched earth
The mighty oak arises
From its roots
Flow rivers of death

Shadowed bodiless forms
The rotting cores of the damned
Drifting - howling to blackened skies
On rushing waters of time

Enter the misty depths
Of the underworld

Where blizzards rage
Through fiery storm
Where magic reigns
The waking dawn

Where ram and serpent
Stand guard
Waiting to taunt the souls
Of those who spent lifetimes
Worshipping lies of a false truth

In vain - they sought return
Protesting their fate
They knew not
The course of the wind
Through which region it roared
On which place it died
