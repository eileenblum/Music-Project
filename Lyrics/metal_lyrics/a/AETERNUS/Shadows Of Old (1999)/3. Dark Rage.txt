Sacrilege
By my hand
As a worthless pale memory
They look upon the old
The defiling of our land
And glorious nature
Shall become their undoing
As we lay our hate
And powers upon them

The dark eternity

I am veiled in wind
I am not alone

Unleashed hate and anger
By mountains strength
We shall prevail by our unity
And for the old - for the old

Battle cries shall rage up
From all our valleys
Unleashed hate and anger
By mountains strength
We shall prevail by our unity

Our hurling storms of hatred
Curse their wretched souls
Our great spirit of strength
Shall battle to the death

With wisdom we walk
With might we slay

And their spiritless bodies
We shall dance upon
Peace shall never be thine

And we shall feast
And we shall sing
In our neverending glory
On our path of the wise
We shall dance on our hallowed ground
Our souls are as one
With earth - spirit
And the old - the old
