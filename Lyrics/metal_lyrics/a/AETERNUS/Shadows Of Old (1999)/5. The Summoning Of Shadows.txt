Thundering chains of truth
Entwining the immortal souls
Of those darkened through eras
Of hatred - war and betrayal

Coming forth their fiery passion
Sweeps through the night
In agony they await
The glory of destiny's grasp

The truth - 
Sought by those
Who dance with infinite darkness

The one dream - 
Conjured by torturous lifetimes
A time not ours

Deeper - deeper we shall dwell
Higher - higher we shall rise

Floating - 
In a maze of darkened desires
Their eyes alone
Reveal the scars of an eternal existence

Awaiting - 
The unveiling of the highest realms
Where the soul
Is freed in honour and pride
