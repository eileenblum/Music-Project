Cold winds forged through time
By clash of thunder in the night of storms
An unborn power is invoked
Of ancient times - yet young
By the full moon's rays

The storm's song is alone this night
For this night arise the creatures of darkness

The wings of darkness unfold
The sky shall black remain
The age of strength shall be born
Fierce winds guard this night

The mountain's creatures shall wander
Their torches glowing from the forest's depths
For war are they armed
For war they serve

The storms truth
The night's lust
The dead's sombre tones
Shall thunder from all mountains
Ancient war cries
Shall freeze the weak warrior's will
Elf flutes sing the battle song
The queen of ice is called upon
Only the true remain in her gaze
For tonight shall the mortals die

The souls of darkness to be praised
