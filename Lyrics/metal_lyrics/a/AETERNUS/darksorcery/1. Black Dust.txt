"human dreams - such a fruitful place to plant the seeds of terror."

child i arise
in your dreams
as a creature - of dread
as a demon - or a wicked witch
what pleases me - i choose
i am the master - of terror
i create your nightmares
child - i am tearing you - apart
my mastery - can not be escaped
black claws tears your mind
black chaos - black terror
child - i am your pain

i'll engrave pain - into your soul
i will set your soul on fire
black flames will rise - as the gate
opens - into the realm - of the dead
here - you will sleep - eternally
and in your never ending dream
i will dance - and laugh
and i will feed
again - and again
