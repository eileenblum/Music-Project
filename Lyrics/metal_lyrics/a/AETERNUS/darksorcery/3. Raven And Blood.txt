high fathers - teaching
knowledge - increasing
wandering through lands
listening - mysterious folk lore
enchantment - through books

desire - to learn the truth
to seek the raven - and the blood

travelling for many days
i find the place - where the elves hide
i must seek their knowledge
elves of wisdom - knowledge of mystery
faith growing - deeply
raven and blood - await me

time goes on - i have no longer guidance
have i failed - is this folk lore
confusion within my mind

i look up - and in the tree i see
the raven
and i see the land - covered with blood
raven and blood - they came to me
finally - the eternity

[spoken]

...and the raven became my king
...and the blood embraced me
...and entered my veins
...and provided me with the strength of 
ares
the god war
