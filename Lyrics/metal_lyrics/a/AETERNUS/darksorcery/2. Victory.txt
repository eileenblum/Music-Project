once again - we have prevailed
under the sun - we have fought
for our belief

hurling our swords
into our foes
drinking their blood
as it spurts - and covers the grass
with the colour red

once again - our tribe dominates
the green steppes - the grey mountains
and the dark deep valleys
there can be only one tribe
the strongest survive
hail
we will defend our domicile
forever

there's a feast tonight
where we will celebrate
our victory - as we have done
so many times before
hail - to our gods - they are with us
we know
they have always led us
to our - victory
