With a stroke came the haze of twilight 
Shadows all around 
Am I blind or is it just a blackout? 
Closing doors, building walls around me 
Losing heart and soul 
Someone save me from this endless journey 

Stuck on a cycle, Iâm going round and round 
Riding to nowhere, get me off the ground 

You, you got me riding on a killer carousel 
You, you got me riding round a killer carousel 

Broken bones with the chest ripped open 
Dodging bullets of death 
Let the blood flow to this wounded heart 
Pushing limits to the maximum threshold 
Going nowhere fast 
Someone save me from this endless journey 
Take me back to the start 

Stuck on a cycle, Iâm going round and round 
Riding to nowhere, let me hit the ground 

You, you got me riding on a killer carousel 
You, you got me going round a killer carousel 
You, you got me riding on a killer carousel 
You, you got me going round a killer carousel
