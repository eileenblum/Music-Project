The chill of death you feel is real 
A vision all too clear 
Dreams of sick imagination 
Trust the fear you feel inside 
Escape from Deathâs design 
Could this really be your final destination? 

I donât believe in your psychic ways 
I donât believe the lies 
The innocence we lost is written in your eyes 

Fight with nothing left to lose 
Death is coming after you 
Stop and ask yourself 
Is today your day to die? 

Flight 180 burned the night 
Premonition saved your life 
But death is on your trail 
You've got to keep your head 
You've got to look out for the signs 
This is your final chance 

I donât believe in your psychic ways 
I donât believe the lies 
The innocence we lost is written in your eyes 

Fight with nothing left to lose 
Death is coming after you 
Stop and ask yourself 
Is today your day to die? 

Fight with nothing left to lose 
Death is coming after you 
Stop and ask yourself 
Is today your day to die? 

Fight thereâs nothing left to lose 
Death is chasing after you 
Stop, today might be 
The day youâre meant to die
