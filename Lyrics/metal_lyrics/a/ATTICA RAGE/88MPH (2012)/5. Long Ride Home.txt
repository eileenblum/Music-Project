I've been away such a long time 
A stranger out on the road 
Falling further away from 
The life that I used to know 
Losing sense of direction 
Burning out of control 
I know I need to come in out of the cold 
And find my way back home 

Of all the people and all the places I've seen 
There's only one place I know 
Iâm coming back to where I belong 
Iâm on the long ride home 
The long ride home 

I feel the distance between us 
There's still a long way to go 
Sometimes my heart feels so empty 
So tired of being alone 
Well, Iâm a travelling road dog 
This was the life that I chose 
But I miss the me that I am with you 
More than you'll ever know 

Can you hear me calling? 

So many people surround me every night 
But Iâve never felt so alone 
Iâm coming back to your loving arms 
Iâm on the long ride home 

Iâm calling, Iâm on way, on the long ride home 

Can you hear me calling?
