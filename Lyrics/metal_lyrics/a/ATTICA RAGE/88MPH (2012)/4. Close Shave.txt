I ainât wasting your time, I think Iâll play away 
Keep on telling the lies, I know youâll find a way 
Mental, rewind, pull it, go blind, yeah 
Keep all the dogs away now 
Youâll find Iâm here to stay 

You people dig the grave 
No secrets left to save 
Youâll find Iâm just a god with a gun 
Lookin' for some fun 
Lovin' the close shave 

No surprise youâre pullin' away 
Given all I've said n' done 
Think it out before you make a big mistake 
Relapse, short tongue, have one, then some, yeah 
Keep all the dogs away now 
Youâll find Iâm here to stay 

You people dig the grave 
No secrets left to save 
Youâll find Iâm just a god with a gun 
Lookin' for some fun 
Lovin' the close shave
