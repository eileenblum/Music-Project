This could be the beginning of the end of the world 
This could be time for my confession 
Time to tell you my story, I want to let you in 
Time to answer all the questions 

I've said a lot but never told you 
the words you really need to know 
We are the ones who'll live forever in the shadows 
We are the true immortal souls 

I'll be here waiting 
Waiting til the dawn shines down on you 
Beyond forever 
Forever we are one, we'll see it through 

These eyes are the window into my open soul 
Look inside and tell me what you see 
So if we face the destruction of the human race 
Let's make this night our lasting legacy 

I'll be here waiting 
Waiting til the dawn shines down on you 
Beyond forever 
Forever we are one, we'll see it through 

I'll be here waiting 
Waiting til the dawn shines down on you 
Love me forever 
Forever starts today, we'll see it through
