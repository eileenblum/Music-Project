I've been remembering the times that you told me 
what you had always believed 
Now I am the one who has risen above you 
You have been left with the dream 

Youâre always going to be the same 
The master plans will never change 
But itâs too late to pass the blame 
No-one remembers your name 

When youâre alone, way down below 
Preaching to yourself because nobodyâs gonna listen 
Look up ahead, look into yourself 
Take your curtain call cos youâre in concert with the mirror now 

You wanted it all but you didn't want the trouble 
of working your way to the top 
Where are you now, I wonder what youâre doing 
Are you living in the land of the lost? 

Youâre always going to be the same 
The master plans will never change 
Itâs too late to pass the blame 
No-one remembers your name 

When youâre alone, way down below 
Preaching to yourself because nobodyâs gonna listen 
Look up ahead, look into yourself 
Take your curtain call cos youâre in concert with the mirror now
