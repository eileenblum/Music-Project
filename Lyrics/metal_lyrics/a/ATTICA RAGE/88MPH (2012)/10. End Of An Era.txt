I lie awake, I lie awake 
This is the day 
Sometimes we all need to understand 
Sometimes things donât go the way we plan 

Saying goodbye, time to say goodbye 
This is goodbye 
Looking back, I know weâll find a way 
Looking forward to a brighter day 

Our time has come 
And itâs only just begun 
Our time is here 
Itâs the end of an era but the best has yet to come 

Our time has come 
Take my hand, itâs only just begun 
Whatâs done is done 
Itâs the end of an era but the best has yet to come
