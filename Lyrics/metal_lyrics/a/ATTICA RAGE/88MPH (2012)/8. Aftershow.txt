Midnight in Soho at the aftershow 
Getting high on beer &amp; whisky 
Pour me a shot and cut another line 
Been here before, this could get nasty 

Welcome to the aftershow 
Leave your liver on the door 
No-one will ever know 
What goes on, who goes down 
What goes down at the aftershow 

5 AM, I think Iâve had too much 
Everything in triple vision 
One last shot but Iâve had enough 
Hit the last one in the middle 

Welcome to the aftershow 
Leave your liver on the door 
No-one will ever know 
What goes on, who goes down 
What goes down at the aftershow 

Welcome to the aftershow, oh yeah 
Pour me just one last shot for the road, oh no 
Welcome to the aftershow, oh yeah 
Been here too many times before, oh yeah 
and I love it, hell yeah!
