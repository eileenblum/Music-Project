Complain? Youâre insane 
Your stings rank above the impossible 
My instinct's to flip you off 
And reign supreme like a son of a gun, a son of a gun 

Yesterday ainât a mile away so you can sit behind your mask 
And point the finger of blame, I can see through your brain 
So welcome to the night youâll be proved wrong 

I want it, I feel it, Iâm giving it all 
I want it, I need it, get back to the core 
I want it, I feel it, Iâm giving it all 
I want it, I need it, going back to the core 

I took a trip today, looking at the world in a different way 
I travelled time today at 88 miles an hour 

Heâs a hero, Double zero 
Double 8âs just the make of the man 
Miles per hour, Your taste is sour 
The only way is gettin back on the horse and running to the top of the hill 

Heâs a hero, double zero 
Double 8âs just the make of the man 
Miles per hour, your taste is sour 
The only way is getting back on the horse 
and running to the top of the hill 

I want it, I feel it, Iâm giving it all 
I want it, I need it, get back to the core 
I want it, I feel it, Iâm giving it all 
I want it, I need it, going back to the core
