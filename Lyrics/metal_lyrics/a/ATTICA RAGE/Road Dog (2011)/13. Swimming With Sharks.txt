Threat is all around
Sharks on higher ground
Circling for bait
Knocking at the gate

I believe that we can light the sky
High above the deep blue sea
If we drop beneath the safety line
You'll be there to stop us falling down

Promises abound
Reaching higher ground
Blood drips from the sweat
They come crashing in through the iron gates

I believe that we can light the sky
High above the deep blue sea
If we drop beneath the safety line
You'll be there to stop us falling
(save us when we're falling)
there to catch us falling down
