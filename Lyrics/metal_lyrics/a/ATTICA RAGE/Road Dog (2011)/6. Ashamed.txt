Disappointed, aggravated, consumed by hatred
Self-despising, agonising, always compromising
Choices made, cards I played, price is yet to be paid
Still I cry, I lived a lie and I can't hold my head up high

I'm sorry for the things I've done
I'm sorry for the person I've become

Standing up, standing out, I'm free from doubt
Changes made, no longer going with the crowd
To pay the price, you got to sacrifice
Don't get me wrong, the road is long
But you can make it if you stand up strong

I'm sorry for the things I've done
'm sorry for the person I've become
This isn't me, inside I know that I must change
Like night to day, to no longer feel...

I'm sorry for the things that I have done
I'm sorry for the person I've become
This isn't me, take a look inside and make that change
From night to day and no longer feel so ashamed
So ashamed
