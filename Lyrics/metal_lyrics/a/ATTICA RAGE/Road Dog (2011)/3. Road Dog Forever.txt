Ten years gone before me, seems like yesterday
One part of my life over, another new part to play
It's been heavy duty, I've got the scars to prove
But I've still got the hunger and I've still got the groove

Through all the fears, broken hearts and bitter tears
Nothing kills the fire inside me
As time goes by, part of me will never die
I'll be a road dog forever

I never used to worry about the world today
I never used to bother about the cards I played
From innocence to suspicion, these years taught me
Looking through the mirror, I'm still who I used to be

Through all the fears, broken hearts and bitter tears
Nothing kills the fire inside me
As time goes by, part of me will never die
I'll be a road dog forever

Through all the fears, broken hearts and bitter tears
Nothing kills the fire inside me
And when times change, rock n' roll still bears my name
I'll be a road dog forever
