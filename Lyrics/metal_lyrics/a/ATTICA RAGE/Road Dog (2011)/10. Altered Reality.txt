Trapped in a world of dreams
Knowing my life is far from how it seems to me in my head
Sometimes I think I'd be better off dead 'cos then I'd be free
From the life of an altered reality

This has to end some day
Can't go on living my life this way, I must be real
It's the only way for me to feel that I'm truly free
From the life of an altered reality

Now since the day I stood tall, I took heed of the call
To be myself and that's how I'll always be
No longer living in lies, time has come for the truth to arise
Now I'm free
From the life of an altered reality
