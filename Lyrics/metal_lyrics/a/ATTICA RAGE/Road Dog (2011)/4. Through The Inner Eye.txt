Quiet reflection, taking in the view
Reading between the criticising few
Who to trust and what to listen to
Darkness surrounds searching for the truth

In the depths of secret thought
March the shadows of doubt
Looking through the Inner Eye
Who am I anyway?

Wandering questions occupy the mind
Struggle for balance, imitation by design
Who to trust and what to listen to
Darkness surrounds searching for the truth

In the depths of secret thought
March the shadows of doubt
Looking through the inner eye
Who am I anyway?
