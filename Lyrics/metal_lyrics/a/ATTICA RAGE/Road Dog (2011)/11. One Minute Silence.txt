Another candle lit, black ribbon on the wall
A country's nation cries, protests in city hall
Innocence shot dead for a piece of land through time
All for an independent state, where will they draw the line?

Nobody saved us in a world that lost control
Hard to believe in truth and justice anymore
Searching for reason, look at the human race
One minute silence to respect those gone before

Two days on death row, covered on TV
Cries for hostage's release and one side to concede
But we all knew it was coming, they won't give into blackmail
As the shot rings out, we'll always fail

Nobody saved us in a world that lost control
Hard to believe in truth and justice anymore
Searching for reason, look at the human race
One minute silence to respect those gone before

Why are we living in a world so out of control?
I can't believe in truth and justice anymore
Searching for reason, look at the human race
One minute silence to respect those gone before
