Revving up the engine on the road again
3500 miles to the lion's den
Across the channel waters on through the lonely night
Crossing country borders at the speed of light
Take the road rage through the summer rain
36 is insane

Navigation chaos in a foreign land
Satellite shutdown, no back-up plan
36 hours, tired eyes
Seeking destination, Hell over Paradise
Take the road rage through the summer rain
36 insane

Nobody knows where this road may end
No-one knows the way back home
Dreams of tomorrow and the path we tread
Chasing brighter lights ahead
