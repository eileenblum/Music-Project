All aboard the plastic train, the eternity of youth
No more the aging skin, no more the snaggletooth
Lay me down, mark the line, draw the blade

Buying into the image of the static horror smile
Selling into the surgeon for a piece of foolish pride
Lay me down, mark the line, draw the blade

All aboard the plastic train and the everlasting youth
Knock the balance of nature, reject the awful truth
Fall in love with the ego, skin-deep insanity
Hide behind the illusion, hacked for vanity
