Someone switch the light one, bring me out the dark
Someone tell a story, pick my brain apart

Take me places I have never seen before
Let me live inside your head free to explore
All this time I've been so foolish to ignore
High on life now you brought me through the door

Lonely as the night hawk, circling round the sky
Inject me with your colour, let me fly

Take me places I have never seen before
Let me live inside your head free to explore
All this time I've been so foolish to ignore
High on life now you took me in let me live inside
Free to fly, high on life, you set me free

Take me places I have never been before
Let me live inside your head free to explore
All this time I've been a fool to ignore
High on life now you took me in, let me live inside
Free to fly, high on life, you set me free
