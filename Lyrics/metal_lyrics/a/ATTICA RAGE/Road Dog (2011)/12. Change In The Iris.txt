A picture in black, a burning nightmare
Harbouring the clay of my heart
Sins of the unborn, giving to Hades
You comfort me, soul to hold
Granting you power of control
Soft yielding flesh that you provide
A burning nightmare

You give to me what you took from yourself
You're broken inside, you'll never be whole
Driven back by your conscience
You're giving it all

The passage of time, a change in the iris
The clutches of cold in my heart
Forgive and forgotten and never spoke of
I reject the soul you once knew
Taking control, forcing you over
The guilt that flesh provides
A change in the iris

You're broken inside, you'll never be whole
Driven back by your conscience, you're giving it all
