Little girl lost, looking for the answer
Photograph in hand of who she used to be
But the hatred deep inside is all she feels tonight
Little girl looks through the empty mirror
Wonders where she might have lost her happiness
But the hatred in her heart...

I know I let you down
Left you lost in a world in your head
I know it's too late now
For the words that I wished I had said

Left alone, crying out for help
Falling, drowning in an empty bed
While the hatred of her self blinds any hope left
Little girl looks through her empty eyes
Softly breathing but barely alive
And the heart that once beat strong...

I know I let you down
Left you lost in a world in your head
I know it's too late now
For the words that I wished I had said

Only time will heal the suffering
Put the darkness in the past now
Light a candle, breathe in deeply and remember
Life never started out in this way

Little girl finally found the answer
Feels the sun on her pale and healing skin
And the hatred is all gone....

I know I let you down
Left you lost in a world in your head
I know it's too late now
For the words that I wished I had said
