Trust was built up with confidence
Security and a true belief
Giving back just as good as you got
With an eagerness to please
But the feeling just ain't there anymore
My allegiance has gone
I'm standing on the other side of the door
And no-one told me I was wrong

You took it all away, black and white turned to grey
Should have known still I asked the questions
There are two faces on your head, double-sided razor's edge
Only held up by your contradictions

Question mark after whatever was said
Don't tie up with the voice in my head
Cutting comment to the star in my eye
Then a kind word about the ones I despise

You took it all away, black and white turned to grey
Should have known still I asked the questions
There are two faces on your head, double-sided razor's edge
Only held up by your contradictions
