A revolution to the old school days
Raise a clenched fist and bang your heads
A senior class of raising hell and bleeding ears
Born into madness, taught through the golden years

Heroes sang of devils and crazy times
A little too much for the sober minds
An ever constant, the lifeblood in our veins
This is our history and always will remain

Throw your hands up, feel the rage inside of you
This is who we are and are proud to be
Crank it up now, feel the noise take over you
Take it back, back to the old school
