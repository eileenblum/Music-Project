"You Better Honour Him, Don't Jeopardize Your Stay
Put On That Perfect Smile And Start Sucking Up!
Hey! Mr. Landlord, Nice To See You Again
Always A Joy When You're Dropping By
We Pretend To Appreciate Wicked Games That He's Playing"

This Edifice, It Rocks Because Of
Worries Are Growing Large
All Its Inmates, They Fear The One Who's
Striking The Gavel Hard

All Dressed Up, Tailor-Made Suit
And A Tie From Giorgio Armani, He's Striding With A Smile
He Is Overjoyed, Swelled With Loftiness
As He Bites The End Of A Large Cuban Cigar

[Repeat]

Screaming, Pointing And Telling Them How
A True Tenant Should Be
Threatening With Turning Off Hot Water, Cable And Power Too
Privacy Is Not Possible, It Doesn't Matter If Door's Closed
Somehow He Is Watching You

He's The Landlord, The One With All The Strength
It Doesn't Matter If You Don't Like What He Says To You

[Repeat]

Then Suddenly One Of Them Screamed Out Loud
Hey Neighbours Look, I Think We're Being Watched
Who Is Responsible For This, All Agreed On One Man
Everybody, Now Listen To Me, Let Us Play Along
Greet Him When You See Him
Let's Slowly Beat Him Down

"Hey! Mr. Landlord, Nice To See You Again
It's Always A Joy When You're Dropping By
You Better Honour Him, Don't Jeopardize Your Stay
We Pretend To Be Unaware Of It All"
