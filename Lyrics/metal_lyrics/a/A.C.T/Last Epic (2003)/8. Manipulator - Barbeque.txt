Can't You See I Don't Want This?
To See, Your Eyes Must Be Open
You See Your Own Truth In My Kiss
You're Feeding Me, You're Kissing Me, You're Tasting Me
Manipulator!

These Four Walls Like A Prison
They're Closing In Every Minute
I Know My Life Is Your Passion
You're Mocking Me, You're Blocking Me, You're Sucking Me
Manipulator!

It Is Time To Wake Up
You Think You Know What I Want But You Are Wrong
You Can't Hold Me Forever
Some Day Mr. Grumble Will Set Me Free
How I Long For That Day, Then I'll Be Gone

She Won't Let You Go
No One Really Knows Where I Am

Get Out Of Here, You've Gone Too Far
My Life's A Mess, Locked In Your Jar
Get Off My Back, This Is My Life
Get Off My Track, My Soul's Still Mine

Do You Think That She Bought It?
The Message's Clear Like Crystal
I Saw A Ripple On Her Eyelid
She Is Like A Tiger, Looking At A Bloody Peace Of Meat

I Don't Think I Can Face Her
This Time I'm King Or Loser
As True As Her Name Is Amber
She Will Leave Or She Will Kill Me, Either Way I'm...

It Is Time To Wake Up
You Think You Know What I Want But You Are Wrong
You Can't Hold Me Forever
Some Day Mr. Grumble Will Set Me Free
How I Long For That Day, Then I'll Be Gone

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
