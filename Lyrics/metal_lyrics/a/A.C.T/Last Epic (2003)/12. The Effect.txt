From The Stairs, Through The Door,
With The Wind
A Sudden Atmosphere
Woke Her Up And Made Her Realize
A Dream It Wasn't, No That Was A Call

From A Floor, Through The Wall,
To Her Room
A Desperate Cry Arrived
Stuck In Bed, She Could Not Move At All
She Wished The Dream
Was Still Inside Her Head

And Everyone Knew Who He Was
But No One Did A Thing
And The Building Appealed
There's No Time To Be Selfish Tonight

Your Question Would Be Why
But Now I Say Goodbye
Figure This Out For Yourself, Let's Try
The Answer's In The Sky
This Is My Final Day
And Soon I'll Fly Away
Something To Learn
You Might See That Soon
What Did Have To Say?

Remember Me Now You Will
The Memory Of Me Will Not Fade Away..."

Could He Feel What They Thought,
Had He Known
They Did Not Care At All
Was His Crying All Because Of That?
Who Is He To Bother Them At Night?

Morning Came, Brought No Light, To A Life
That Had Begun To Fall
He Would Never Walk This Earth Again
His Final Words Are Still Inside Their Minds

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
