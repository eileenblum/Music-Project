I Tell Myself That I Wasn't That Involved
And Put Away Problems That Are Not Solved
Still I Recall What We Did That Day
It's Clear Why You Ran Away
My Conscience's Gone

I Get The Feeling That I Am Not Alone
A Glance At The Wall, Did I See Him Frown
I Feel He's Aware Of What We've Done
Destroying His Favorite Son
He Read My Mind

I Will Not Ever Forget A Smile That Dies
The Look On Your Face When You Took Our Lies
But You Were The One To Blame
I Cannot Stand The Shame

I Guess He Sees Me Through
Feel Him From Above
How He's Starting From The Ceiling

Ted, I Let Her Use You Too
Nothing She Said Was True
What Have I Done To You?

You Sat Beside Me, We Talked About Your Style
I Mentioned The Garden, That Made You Smile
A Lie From This House Was The Latest Trend
I Said That I Was Your Friend
Please Rewind

I Think He's Coming To Get Me, Can't You See
A Whisper At Night - You Will Not Be Free
Reminding Me Of What We Did That Day
It's Clear Why You Left That Away
I've Lost Control

A Memory Of A Smile That Died
How Do You Think That I Feel Inside?
But You Were The One To Blame
She Won Her Stupid Game

[Chorus]

[Repeat]
