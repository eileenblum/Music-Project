By Myself, I'm Here Alone In Tears, Now Days And Weeks Gone By
Still It Feels The Same, I Wonder What Made It Go Wrong

Loneliness And Silence And My Soul Is Aching, Torn Inside
Will Great Emptiness Heal; Will Love Cherish Me Once Again

Everything's So Different Now, Even Water Taste So Strange
I Close My Eyes, It Hurts Too Much To See

You Came And Gave Me Love
I Thought That It Was Meant To Be
Somehow It Had To End
I Couldn't See That What I Treasure Had Gone

This Is All, Still News To Me, Engravings Cut Inside My Head
These Are Drawings That Will Not Be Erased Or Fade By Time
Thinking Of The Life We Shared A Smile Across My Face Appears
All Joy We Shared It Ended When You Spoke Those Words

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

Trying To Be Strong Although I'm Weaker Than I've Ever Been
Longing For You, Dreaming Of You, Everything Is Gone

Since That Day It Seems Like Life Has Lost Its Spark In Me
I Am Lost In This Chapter, Tell Me When It Ends
