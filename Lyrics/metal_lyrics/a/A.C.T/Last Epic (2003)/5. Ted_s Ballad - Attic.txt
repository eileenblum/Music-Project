Watching Your Walls, Your Cracks And Your Flaws
They Are All Beauty Marks As Far As I See
One Drainpipe Is Loose, Like A Tile On Your Roof
But Your Heart Is As Great As Camelot's

Standing Here Tall, In All Your Grace
You Emanate Hope To Me

You Make Me Want To Live
You Give Me Strength To Want To Give
I Know You Feel My Love
I Can See It In Your Aisles

Your Bricks Shining Red - Can You All See The Irony?
On Your Fine Flowerbed - They Are Laughing Behind His Back
I Mend It With Deep Respect And Loving Care
Your Windows Are Clean - All The Need Is A Friend Who Cares
By The Man No One Have Seen - He's The Man No One Sees A Friend
He Too Can See Through Your Thick Concrete Walls

Standing Here Tall, In All Your Grace
You Emanate Hope To Me

[Chorus]
