Close Your Eyes
You're Not Alone
Remember Your Size
Can Somebody Hear Your Moan?
Like That Wall Could Protect You
Rings On Water, Close Description
Be Aware My Son,
Cause Your Hate Is All Around

What You Hear
That Could Be True
That's Why I Fear
I See What Your Mind Construe

I Do Not Judge You, I Only Observe
You're Still My Soul
But I'm Wailing Inside
When My Spirits Try To Hide
It's Time To Wake Up, Time To Make A Change

I Can't Deny
That You Make Me Cry
If I Ask You To Decide
Would You Choose My Side?
To Be Honest, You Are No One I Can Trust

What Your Mind Will Radiate
Someone Will Find
And Spirits Illuminate
But Your Thoughts Aren't Happy
What You're Spreading Through My Organs
Will Reverberate
And Soon Affect You Fate

What You Think, Is Energy
Remember The Link
And How It Recoils On Me

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
