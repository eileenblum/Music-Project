"We need to stand up better against competition", the manager
said and nodded to himself. Then he pointed at her. "You understand
that, right?"
The girl didn't reply, she continued to stare down at the ground.
"Well, anyway", the manager continued, "I've decided to do the whole show without safety nets. You know, I'd like to give the audience
a true authentic experience. I want them to be scared, to be
afraid, and to actually fear that something will happen. Nobody
else in this business does it without nets, we will be alone, and we
will beat all our opponents. We will have the best show in the
world." The manager held out his arms, cocked his head and smiled.
"I've never done it without..."
"Ah, come on", the manager cut her off. He did a dismissive gesture.
"You never fall, you can do it. You will do it, don't you want to be
part of the best show in the world?"
"Yes", she said and took a deep breath.
"That's the attitude, that's the spirit, baby".

The spotlight on her naked neck
The crew removing the safety nets
And mumblings from the seats beneath
All makes her tremble with fear

High above the solid ground
She hesitates but she takes the leap
In unison the crowd inhale
As she leaves the unsafe ledge

Don't even dare to think
Don't even dare to think one thought

Across the tent from side to side
Above their heads like a bouncing ball
Nothing in her act reveals
How she actually feels

She sets up a fictive net
Preparing for the final step
She shuts her eyes and leaves the bar
he audience cheer

Don't even dare to think
Don't even dare...

There's an angel up in the sky
The lady in white, they say she can fly
She floats around, she moves with grace
A glowing light, a shining star in space
