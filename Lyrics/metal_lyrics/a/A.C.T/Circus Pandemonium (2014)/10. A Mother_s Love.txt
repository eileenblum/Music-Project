Where no one can see, where no one can hear, my heart is beating
so hard it hurts. No one saw me, no one has realized that I've escaped.
The coldness from the hard stonewalls doesn't bother me. The difficult
decision that lies before me weigh heavily upon my shoulders.
A possibility of a fate far worse? Darkness and anxiety increase
and sharpen my senses. The evening dew makes the air do damp
and cold, allowing my breath to create tiny, white veils that surround
me - or is it something else? Sense a presence that doesn't
scare. My heart's not pounding anymore, calmness rinses through
my body and I clasp my hands, collecting myself in hopes for an answer.

I cry out to you, like I've done many times before
I hope you listen to my prayer tonight
I'm in desperate need of help. I can't decide all by myself
The crossroad's here, which path shall I stride?

I've been watching you since the day that I died
Can you not feel my love just breeze by your side?
But I can not help you to make that choice 'cause your destiny is sealed.
My heart, my son.

How can I go back? Meeting just pain and misery
No one should live the life that I do
But what will wait ahead? Maybe something even worse?
God! Try to see it from my point of view

I've been watching you since the day that I died
Can you not feel my love just breeze by your side?
But I can not help you to make that choice 'cause your destiny is sealed.
My heart, my son.

Life is not fair, I should have told you all along from the start
You have to go back, he needs your help, he is your father

There's no choice. He'd do it for me
