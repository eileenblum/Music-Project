Warning! We take no responsibility for bloodstained clothing. And
a reminder - you did enter at your own risk!

This is what you've all been waiting for
Can you feel it in the air?
You will get what you want and a little more,
Just sit back, we will get you there

We have all kinds of creature,
More than your eyes have probably seen
They all have supernatural features
Supernatural, believe in me!

What is this?!
Are you not done?!
You should should have done it long before
Wash it now!
I don't care how!
I won't put up with this no more!

Our show is not what you're used to
Sometimes you'll probably laugh
More importantly, we will make you
Feel sick, throw up and incredible scared

Our clowns don't need no makeup
They are just made that way
The strong man is so beefed up,
He can lift himself up in the air

Is this not gone?!
Oh, now you're done!
You will taste my rage unleashed!
Prepare yourself,
For the bomb
I will slap you until you bleed

I am your master,
I know you're all afraid
I will burn you,
If you won't obey
I am your master,
and I will always be
You can run but I will find you

We never ever should have put our trust in him this way
Now we know we're damned forever

I think that he saw me
Her eyes looked my way
Words can not even explain
When her hair sways
Might be mine some day

I know that you're all so eager
To see what we've got in store
Tonight is a special evening
A man who's here will be no more

Hold on to a friend or a neighbour
Oh, this will not be nice
I assure you, he won't suffer
It's his personal sacrifice

Let this be,
A lesson to learn
For you who're not obedient
Look at her
That way she's burned
Listen to my acknowledgment

I am your master,
I know you're all afraid
I will burn you,
If you won't obey
I am your master,
and I will always be
You can run but I will find you

We never ever should have put our trust in him this way
Now we know we're damned forever

I think that he saw me
Her eyes looked my way
Words can not even explain
When her hair sways
Might be mine some day
