The first thing he felt was the cold hard ground he was lying on.
He opened his eyes and stared straight into an endless darkness.
Then he heard the wheezing breath. It sounded like someone was
breathing through a tube into his ear. It was his own breath. He tried
to move his hand, but it was pulled back with a jerk. The wrist cracked and something scraped against the floor. The chain, he remembered.
He was stuck.

A man leans down and whispers:
"You can't stay. This is your chance, now take it, run away"
The stupid creature grunts and thinks, I'll try
They says a word, it's sounding like goodbye

"Straight ahead, never turn around
Don't look back, back where you began
Through the woods, through the fields you'll run
Don't go back to that awful man"

A clumsy figure flees into the night
He's tired, turns, and glimpses a distant light
He's rushing now, towards a waving man
That foolish thing, runs back where he began

"Straight ahead, never turn around
Don't look back, back where you began
Through the woods, through the fields you'll run
Don't go back to that awful man"
