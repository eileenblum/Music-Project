- He's so ugly! - Oh yes! I've heard his father is a horse. - Do you recon
he has feelings? - Oh no! One that ugly can't feel anything, or can
he?

Look at the freak, everyone, look at the freak, everyone, look at
the way he is scaring the people
He is bringing in the money
And for that we're all quite happy

It's the way his eyes hang out. His ears are way too Long
His arms are way too short and he has no nails

Don't miss out to see the freak. He's so ugly you'll go blind

Look at the freak, everyone, look at the freak, everyone, look at
the way he is scaring the people
He is bringing in the money
And for that we're all quite happy

You'll never forget his face. Forever in your mind
Haunts you in your dreams. No one like his kind

Don't miss out to see the freak. He is so ugly you might go blind
