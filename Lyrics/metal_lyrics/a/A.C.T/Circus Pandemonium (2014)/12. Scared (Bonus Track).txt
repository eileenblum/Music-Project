Are you still here?! Why not in there?!
People can't wait, they want us to entertain
This will be a really magic evening to remember
Now it's your turn to enter the stage

Didn't you hear?! What I just said?!
Won't say it again, soon I will go insane
What is the problem? You've done it a j=hundred times before
Now quit your whining and get out there

Please give me strength to show
It's time for my last and final dance
Please, God, don't make me go
Grant me my wish: Just one more chance

Is this how it all will end?
Sentenced to death, without knowing
Give me a note to send
Telling my son, it's not my doing

If I could just get one more day to make it right
I'd tell the truth. It's all a lie!

Don't try to delay, soon you'll be slain
It all will be quick, probably not much pain
You can trust me, your secret's safely buried with me
Now, no more pondering, time to go

Please give me strength to show
It's time for my last and final dance
Please, God, don't make me go
Grant me my wish: Just one more chance

Is this how it all will end?
Sentenced to death, without knowing
Give me a note to send
Telling my son, it's not my doing

If I could just get one more day to make it right
I'd tell the truth. It's all a lie!

So if I should get one more chance
I'd probably do it all over again

Please give me strength to show
It's time for my last and final dance
Please, God, don't make me go
Grant me my wish: Just one more chance

Is this how it all will end?
Sentenced to death, without knowing
Give me a note to send
Telling my son, it's not my doing
