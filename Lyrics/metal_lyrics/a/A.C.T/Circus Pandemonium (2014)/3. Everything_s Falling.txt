The cage was too small. The creature was in pain. He tries to turn
around to change position, but it just wasn't possible. He didn't
remember much of yesterday. He had been beaten, then he had
woken up in this cage, probably as a punishment. But a punishment
for what? He didn't understand. What had he done?
At a distance, he could see Louis coming towards him. Louis sat
down close to the cage.
"What have they done to you?" Louis whispered while patting the
creature on the head. The creature made a deep sound and shook
his head. Louis nodded.
"There's nothing to understand, he's an idiot, a very bad person",
Louis said and looked at the other cages. "Just look at my animals."
Louis sighed.
"We need to get you out of here."
The creature made another sound, and Louis replied:
"I know, this whole place is broken, it is falling apart, it's falling to pieces."

A tent that's filled with holes
Raised by broken homesick souls
On a field that is somewhere far away from here

A constant drunken clown
A freak that has been beaten down
What they share, a pent-up anger deep inside

All alone in the dark they weep
They turn around in their worried sleep
They're passengers on a sinking ship
It's the end of a lifelong trip
(They all know)
It will crack!
It will fall!
It will not hold!

Animals are chained
Some of them are sick and drained
In a cage a lion licks his new whip wounds

The leader will demand
Even though you are injured, stand!
That is how they bring in money for the show

All alone in the dark they weep
They turn around in their worried sleep
They're passengers on a sinking ship
It's the end of a lifelong trip
(They all know)
It will crack!
It will fall!
It will not hold!

Everything's falling, falling to pieces
They try to hold out
Try to hold out, but they're broken
Everything's falling, falling to pieces
They try to hold out
Try to hold out, but they're broken

Moving on from town to town
They're building up, they're tearing down
A shifting landscape, but the pain's the same

All alone in the dark they weep
They turn around in their worried sleep
They're passengers on a ship
It's the end of a lifelong trip
(They all know)
It will crack!
It will fall!
It will not hold!

Everything's falling, falling to pieces
They try to hold out
Try to hold out, but they're broken
Everything's falling, falling to pieces
They try to hold out
Try to hold out, but they're broken

(Nobody hears them and nobody sees them
Try to hold out 'cause it's all that they know)
