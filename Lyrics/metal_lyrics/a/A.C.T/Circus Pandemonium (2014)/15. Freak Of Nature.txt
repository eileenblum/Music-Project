The odor scent from the circus surrounding me causes ambiguous
feelings. My home, a scenery of degeneration and morbidity. Filthy
money feeds me. Your visits in this stronghold of humiliation seem
to awake no pangs of conscience. Your fresh bodies in beautiful
cases are prepared for a journey of enchantment and horrors, despise
and intoxicating scam. Every laughter caused by the sight of
me causes pain in my soul, distancing me from those worthy and
dignified. None of you believes there is a story to tell.
This is me!

Feeling lonely, worn out entirely
Scared and afraid, troubled and offended,
Cheated, abused, betrayed, confused,
Threatened, beaten, insulted, humiliated
My life is insignificant

Welcome Sire, you can admire,
All freaks of nature, feel free, just to hire
You may laugh and we will disgust you
As long as you pay what we want you to
You're allowed to take our pictures

If you could see me behind the mask I'm always wearing
You will find a man who's been abused 'cause he is different
If we could swap just one day you'd understand

Who took him from me, something was wrong
They have always been his dearest friends
Why now? So raw, his flesh, their claws
Someone must have shown them what to do
Please, let this nightmare end now!

If you could see me behind the mask I'm always wearing
You will find a man who's been abused 'cause he is different
If we could swap just one day you'd understand

Sire, I am sorry I was
In the way of your spit, -who is monstrous!?
Maybe I should spit back at you
Just to prove I am human too
I'll take my vengeance upon you!

How can I go on in this life?
You left me here, now I'm all alone
These scars won't heal, never, I feel
So lost, it's not fair. You should have been here!

If you could see me behind the mask I'm always wearing
You will find a man who's been abused 'cause he is different
