She Grew Up, Became A Man, What's Going On?
Parents Told Her:
Disappear, Don't Turn Around.
Please, Never Come Back,
Go Away, And Pack Your Bags, Filthy One.

Filled With Sorrow She Threw Out Some Of Her Old Clothes.
All Her Skirts She Now Had Drowned In Gasoline.
Flames Touching The Sky,
Burning Up Her Old Life, No Regrets.

Growing A Beard, Finally A Man.

Please Accept That She Is Nothing But A Normal Guy.
We Can't Help That She's Been Raised In A Narrow-Minded World.
Scratching His Crutch, Just Like Real Men Do.
Filled With Strength, Takes Another Step.

To Become A Full-Grown Man She Needed Help.
A Crazy Little Swedish Surgeon Took Her Case.
Cut, Pasted And Sewed, Changing Her Totally, Renewed And Gay.

Shoulders Now Broad, Finally A Man.

Please Accept That She Is Nothing But A Normal Guy.
We Can't Help That She's Been Raised In A Narrow-Minded World.
Scratching His Crutch, Just Like We All Do.
Filled With Strength, Entering The World!

Something Appeared.
What A Nice Surprise That Was.

[Chorus 1]
