Trapped Inside And Filled With Fear,
He's Sitting In His Chair.
So Lonely And So Cold, But He Knew.
Cuz' All Those Years With All Those Tests
Had Finally Shown Result.
That They Are Not Alone,
Repentance For What He Had Done.

It Seems Like It Won't End, I Don't Know What To Do.
It Feels Like It Won't End, I Don't Know What To Do.
Doesn't Matter If I Try To Close My Eyes.

Even Every Second Is Too Much For Me To Take.
Losing My Mind In A Room This Dark.
Please Make Them Go Away.

So Many Years, Now You Are Here.
When You Replied, All Pleased Inside.
There Is Nothing Else That We Can Do.

They Forced Him To The Fetching
Of The Unknown To Be Explored.
Extinction For Them All, But He Knew.
The Consequences It Would Bring,
He Tried To Make Them See (Don't You Understand That?).
Shut Your Mouth And Work Or You Will
Be Put Away For Life.

[Bridge]

Now When All The Consequences From This Have Been Shown.
Not An Earthly Chance For Us, What Can We Do?
Please Make Them Go Away.

So Many Years, Now You Are Here.
When You Replied, All Pleased Inside.
But It All Turned Out, This Is The Last Dance,
There Is Nothing Else That We Can Do.

In This Room He Locked Himself
In And Knowing It Would Extinct Them All
From The Face Of The Earth.

Everything Is My Own Fault,
How Selfish Of Me, They Threatened Me With My Own Life.
Everything Will Now Soon Be Gone, I'm Crying Here
On My Own But It Won't Help Us Out At All.

He Had Known From The
Very First Start That It Would Extinct Everyone From
The Face Of The Earth.

I Really Cannot Manage No More,
All The Guilt That I Have In My Heart For What I've Done.
Now When I'm Fading Away,
I Hope You Can Forgive Me
For What I Have Done To Them All.
Closing My Eyes Now.

[Chorus]
