I Might Seem Strange, How I Act And How I Talk.
I Don't How To Socialise.

A Neat Surprise, The Way She Moved.
She Broke My Heart In Two.

I Really Don't Know Why I Had To Make That Donkey Mine.
She Looked Like She Could Need A Drink.
She Drank A Six-Pack; Plastic, Cans And All.

I Thank The Skies, I Found Her.
She'll Beat Up The Guys Who Used To Harass Me.
This Woman Of Mine, She's Problably The Brightest Star Of All.
Once I'm In Her Arms, She Knows Just What To Do.
I Feel Her Biceps Close To Me, And One Thing Is For Sure.
Those Things Ain't Small!

Well, We're A Bit Odd So What!
We Differ Quite In Height,
I'm Only Five Foot Four.
And She's Almost Ten.
Almost Ten!
Don't Wanna Lose My Girl,
This Shot-Putter Of Mine.
She Will Protect Me And She's
A Real Gourmet Cook Too.
Feed Me More!
Oh, My Svetlana.
Maybe Cupid Is Blind.
