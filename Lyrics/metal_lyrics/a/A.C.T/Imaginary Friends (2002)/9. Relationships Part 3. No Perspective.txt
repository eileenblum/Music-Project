You Made A Fool Of Me Last Night.
Left Me Alone At The Table You Did.
Not Very Bright!

And You Made It Obvious For Sure.
Dancing And Smiling That Might Be All Right.
But You Gave Him More!

Please Let Me Tell You Something About That Guy.
He's Not As Friendly As He Seems To Be.
He Makes You Feel So Free.
But Something Else On His Mind, That's Why He's Kind.

Awkward Behaviour Like That.
Suit You It Doesn't At All.
So Jealous That You Might Fall.
Wake Up, Grow Up And See.
That You Will Never Again
Question My Love For You.
Why Can't You See?
Just How Much You Mean To Me?
