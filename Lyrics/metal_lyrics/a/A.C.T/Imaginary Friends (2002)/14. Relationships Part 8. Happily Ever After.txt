Finally We're Here,
The Moment We've Been Waiting For.
Carry You Inside,
Now I Know I Have It All.
A Perfect Night,
The Two Of Us Enjoying You.

CATHERINE

Catherine, please, don't you cry.
I'll see you in two weeks.
Now kiss Daddy goodbye.
Your mummy and I have hurt you so bad.
Gone is our love and the things that we shared.

I'm on my knees for you, Catherine.
Words don't reveal
The things that I feel,
Catherine.

It seems that I have lost, all that I once had.
I think that you know, your eyes seem so sad.

I'm on my knees for you, Catherine.
Words won't reveal
The things that I feel,
Catherine.

And one day you'll grow and you have children of your own.
Then cherish your luck, dear Catherine.
Please erase this memory.

Catherine, please, don't you cry.
I'll see you in two weeks.
Now kiss Daddy goodbye.

I'm on my knees for you, Catherine.
Words won't reveal
The things that I feel,
Catherine.
