It's getting dark, I hear a voice
It's whispering
I turn around but no one's there
Against my face I sense a breath
I close my eyes, I'm flying
A mellow smell, I taste the air
I realize someone's lying next to me
I feel a hand against my hair, it makes me weak
I'm crying

No one's there to tell you when the moment's coming
You will ever hear when there's a thunder drumming
A tenth of a second, that is all it takes

Everyone says they know how I feel
But I have a wound that won't heal

I see your eyes in every face
You look at me, but I'm afraid to look at you
I'm filled with guilt, I'm filled with grief
It hurts me so, it's painful
I hear your voice in every sound
You talk to me, but I'm too weak to talk to you
They say that time will heal wound
How do they know? It's my wound

No one's there to tell you when the moment's coming
You will ever hear when there's a thunder drumming
A tenth of a second, that is all it takes

Everyone says they know how I feel
But I have a wound that won't heal

Are you there?
I am here
Everywhere
You're in the end
Are you there?
I am here
Everywhere
You're in the end

Life isn't fair, you would taking away far too soon
I have to move on, I've got a wound that won't heal
