Now tell me have you ever heard a more pathetic kind of man?
All of this self-pity and lonely self-despise that i can't stand

I think it's time you two must throw away the hash
And become friends, right now
For all sake, but he's fake
I won't break
I think it's time for my speech

I am so tired of it all
Why can't he be more like me?
Always sober, kind of weak
He's the opposite, more like a freak
You can never get me down

Can you believe this leads of end strand to metal with my mind
I'm crushing like the lids of lying is between these hands of mine

Why can't the two of you just throw away the hash
And become friends, right now
For all sake but he's fake
I won't break
Now it's time for the speech

I am so tired of it all
Why can't he be more like me?
Hidden raised and running five miles
Like me would be his cup of tea
Oh no, always acting bad

For all sake
But he's fake
I won't break
Now it's time for the speech

I am so tired of it all
Why can't he be more like me?
Hidden ride and running five miles
Like me would be his cup of tea
Always sober, kind of weak
He's the opposite, more like a freak
Oh no, always acting bad
So sad
