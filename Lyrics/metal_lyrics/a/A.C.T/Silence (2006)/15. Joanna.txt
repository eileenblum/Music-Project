Joanna looked at me and smiled. I dreamt about a child
She was twenty twenty eight.
With the longing so hard she couldn't wait
She felt frustrated that I wasn't ready
She started to cry then i walked away
Not saying goodbye

Along with the bay
Along with the bay

Exausted by the misery
She looked but couldn't see
The sadness made her unaware
Though the driver's too drugged to even care
He crunched, scorned and demolished her body
She died on his hand
Was it my fault? I miss you my Joanna

Along with the bay
Along with the bay [*CAR CRASH*]
