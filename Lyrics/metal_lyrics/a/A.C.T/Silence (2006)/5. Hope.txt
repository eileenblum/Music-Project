Surrounded by family and friends
A picture what life's like at your end
In my dreams i cannot imagine
The horror you must have seen
If I could tell these words to you
I know that probably it won't do
I try to give some conforting but
I don't know what do
One thing is for sure
I will be there for you

Hope is the last thing you cannot give up
Faith keeps us strong through it all

To all of you out there who have lost
We cannot predict what it will cost
Listen your parents or your children
Too much to comprehend
I feel a constant need to help
What more than money can be sent?
Where will I find the words of comfort
I don't know what to do
One thing is for sure
I will be there for you

Hope is the last thing you cannot give up
Faith keeps us strong through it all

Can anybody please tell me what it's about
Helpless people dying, I just wanna shout
Is this something you are trusted to really see
I see no solution, so what can it be?

Hope is the last thing you cannot give up
Faith keeps us strong through it all
[2x]
Faith keeps us
Faith keeps us strong through it all
