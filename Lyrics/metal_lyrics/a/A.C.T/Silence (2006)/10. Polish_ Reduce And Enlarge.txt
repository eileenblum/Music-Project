You look good, that's right
I have to know just in case
Who did you pay to get that perfect face

God, I think you're cool
You always do what is right
But have to say, your skin looks awful tight

So you say that you are way too fat
And your hair looks like a sewer rat
Guess there's only one thing to do
It's clear what you need, see no options for you

Polish your bone
Reduce your chin
'Cause your face looks a little uneven
Silicon, yes, enlarge your breasts
It's a painful procedure, well who really cares?
Doctor's surprise
Lips blown up in size

You look good, yeah right
I really think you've got style
Don't get me wrong, I like your plastic smile

Oh, you are my god
You've got it all, you're my star
Your age again? You start to look bizarre

No expression, not a single line
Still you're looking for a new design
Guess there's only one thing to do
It's clear what you need, see no options for you

Polish your bone
Reduce your chin
'Cause your face looks a little uneven
Silicon, yes, enlarge your breasts
It's a painful procedure, well who really cares?
Doctor's surprise
Lips blown up in size

Polish your bone
Reduce your chin
'Cause your face looks a little uneven
Silicon, yes, enlarge your breasts
It's a painful procedure, well who really cares?
Doctor's surprise
Lips blown up in size
Oh, you are my god
You've got it all, you're my star
Your age again? You start to look bizarre

No expression, not a single line
Still you're looking for a new design
Guess there's only one thing to do
It's clear what you need, see no options for you

Polish your bone
Reduce your chin
'Cause your face looks a little uneven
Silicon, yes, enlarge your breasts
It's a painful procedure, well who really cares?
Doctor's surprise
Lips blown up in size

Polish your bone
Reduce your chin
'Cause your face looks a little uneven
Silicon, yes, enlarge your breasts
It's a painful procedure, well who really cares?
Doctor's surprise
Lips blown up in size
