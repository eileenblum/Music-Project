Gone are the day's we spent out at the lake
Seized the day, no appointments to make
The sun shows up brightly as anywhere else
Life was good, no sign of hell
I wasn't there for you, always unknown
Working night and day
The relation you had with your mother was strange
What did you do when I wasn't there?

Now you are gone, left is the anger
Will the scars ammend?
And a father's love of a daughter who's fraught
As I cannot believe what you've done
He will consider the truth
Will I believe what you've done?

If I could turn back the time just one year
It would have been different i swear
But time can't be changed as far as i know
I need a sign from far beyond

Now you are gone, left is the anger
Will the scars ammend?
And a father's love of a daughter who's fraught
As I cannot believe what you've done
He will consider the truth
Will I believe what you've done?
