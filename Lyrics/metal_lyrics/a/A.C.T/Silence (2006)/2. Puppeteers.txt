They never seemed to figure the radar out
But no even more have to be seen
Leaders are ruling, mocking and caring, just using you
Still you dream of glad utopia

Just like puppeteers
Forgive but I'm not well now you're in tears
I am sorry I can't help you
Tell me what I felt
With this attempt i want a happy tale
So please can you give me a helping hand
I'm on my knees... for you

Used to be so fun just watching you try
I Have to say it was forbidden ride
Gave you a heart so you would feel what's right
Still try to be creative
You knew that it didn't
Have a playoff by a sarcotic wound

Never give up will time make me give in

Just like puppeteers
Forgive but I'm not well now you're in tears
I am sorry I can't help you
Tell me what I felt
With this attempt i want a happy tale
So please can you give me a helping hand
I'm on my knees... for you

Don't you see what's done is wrong
Will you wait the look beyond
Trust will grow I'll wait someone
Dont I have just win my one

That you dream
Is what I want

Just like puppeteers
Forgive but I'm not well now you're in tears
I am sorry I can't help you
Tell me what I felt
With this attempt i want a happy tale
So please can you give me a helping hand
I'm on my knees... for you
