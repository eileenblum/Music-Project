Hey my dear old friend, do you remember me?
You seem very sad, anything I can do?
You tried to run away but you cannot hide from me
There somewhere inside coming right back at you

There like a sudden impulse don't persist let it out
You cannot fight me, I'm pushing you back
You're up your road
Reach up you hand, grab your goals

Feed me, with your hunger
Storm me, wake my anger
Free me, I sense your eager
Leave me, like you've tried before
You know it's pointless, it's in your heart

There, I say you miss, things that we talked about
You with all your ideas, that's how I came to life
All of your visions are gone, You are lost
You are running round in circles
I'm pushing you up when you are down
Reach up you hand, grab your goals

Feed me, with your hunger
Storm me, wake my anger
Free me, I sense your eager
Leave me, like you've tried before
You know it's pointless, it's in your heart

You are the voice inside of me, I gave your life but kept you far away
Please tell me you will stay
Our elevating dialogue, dead am I the sound of everyday
I've got to let you out
You seem to think it's too late don't give up
We're not dead he cannot kill me
I am your life your voice within
It's time to break loose, to make up your mind
It's time to stop feeling alone

Feed me, with your hunger
Storm me, wake my anger
Free me, I sense your eager
Feel me, go on that dreamer
Feed me, with your hunger
Storm me, wake my anger
Free me, I sense your eager
Leave me, like you've tried before
You know it's pointless, it's in your...
