Don't wake me up, let me stay in bed
(Weekend's over)
Don't wanna work, can I call in dead
(No way under!)

What happened to you ?
Now take a look at the something
Look savarty forty
You think you have frowned your life away

Everyday over and over again
(Over and over)
Doing the same thing, I'm going insane
(I just want to go)

Look at you now, he's trying to
Borrow my bliss when we spent on a day
Spend some time on a sun that would never end

Sorry is that we've done with all you food
Your yellow shirt look kind of cute
Guess that is not what you want out of life
Parking at Banana's Cottonly
You career has reached its peak
This is what happens when parents arrive

Gonna be sneezing, get ready
There's a lady hearing about that twice
I know what you're thinking but that would be wrong
Remember to be nice

When customers whining that they can't find
I've got a spy that I hide behind

Where is the coffe that's in your Aaaaaaaaaaaad
(This is my own fault !)

Well this is your life
Just try to thought about this
when we spent all the days
spend some time on a sun that would never end

Sorry is that we've done with all you food
Your yellow shirt look kind of cute
Guess that is not what you wants out of life
Working at Banana's Cottonly
You career has reached its peak
This is what happens when parents arrive
This is what happens when parents arrive
Better call in dead!
