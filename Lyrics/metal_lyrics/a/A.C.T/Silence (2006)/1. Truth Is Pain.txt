Once it was great, just be alive
Life was so simple, I was satisfied with myself
You were a friend, it was crystal clear
I would have walked through fire for you, oh I swear

Look at me, I came to be the one you loath
Now I know, it all makes sense
No defence, no more lies or alibis
Thuth is pain
I feel for you no more

Then I was lost, it broke my heart in two
Couldn't believe that you would sacrifice what we had
Now I get by, time will heal my wounds
Vengeance is mine when time will banish you into despair

Look at me, I came to be the one you loath
Now I know, it all makes sense
No defence, no more lies or alibis
Thuth is pain
I feel for you no more
