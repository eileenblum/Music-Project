This endless tale takes its toll and life begins
to wonder what will you do?
You live this whole life through, favour your path,
though many times it may (seem hard).

Be men of soul, flesh and blood is proof in glory,
you may rule the victory inside,around you
faith lies thick, in the presence you play the fool.

Hold on tight, you think that you are right
the things you did last night, sentences ment
to harm, cut up something deep inside,
memories that you tried to hide.
You'll believe their awful lies, luck many turn so roll the dice.
Then you'll find, piece of your mind, in love.

(Blues according to Asp)

Be men of soul, flesh and blood is proof in glory,

memories that you tried to hide.
You'll believe their awful lies, luck may turn so roll the dice.
Then you'll find, piece of your mind, in love.

(Hermans ballet lesson break)

Hold on tight, you think that you are right
