Do you know what I just saw?
People walk around with concrete in their jaws.
It's a new method that dentists use.
Keep the teeth in place when they get loose.

So look into my eyes, you'll see the lord of lies,
cross my fingers I swear this is true.

Something weird occurred today,
the president called me up and said, come out and play!
He's got a new toy from the CIA
guaranteed to blow your mind away.

So look into his eyes, he is the lord of lies,
with just one look you can tell he's a crook!!

You'll believe in all I say,
even if I'd tell you that my wife was gay!!
Some might say that I've blown a fuse.
Some might even call it wife abuse!!!

So look into my eyes, I am the lord of lies,
cross my fingers I swear this is true.
