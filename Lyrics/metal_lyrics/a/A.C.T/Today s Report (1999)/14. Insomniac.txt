(He's awake.)
Oh, will you believe him; he just can't fall asleep.
(Something's wrong.)
He's so very tired; still he can't fall asleep.
Walking about in he's search for
something to make him go numb.
He's already tried every pill in the pharmacy.

(He's awake.)
He's twisting and turning, soon he will see the dawn.
(Fast asleep.)
By now they're all sleeping, is he the only one (still awake)?
Counting them sheep will not help him,
math only makes him confused.
The timer is set; he'll be up with the morning show.
(Good morning Kentucky.)

What is he gonna do, to fall asleep just like you do?
Is it worth crying for the nap that he is dying for?
While we are in Utopia, he is lost in Insomnia.
So goodnight, please sleep tight.
You'll never know if it's day or night...
Close your eyes.

(He's awake.)
Oh, God I am tired, still I can't sleep at night.
(Still awake.)
My sore eyes are aching I've been awake too long.
Medical treatment that's what I need.
Put me in bed and give me a dream.
Maybe if I hit my head on a stone I'll faint...

What is he gonna do, to fall asleep just like you do?
Is it worth crying for the nap that he is dying for?
While we are in Utopia, he is lost in Insomnia.
So goodnight, please sleep tight.
You'll never know if it's day or night...
Close your eyes.

What if the ruler of dreams can't find?
The place he goes to control my mind.
Maybe he's lost his ability
to fascinate the world above me...

While we are in Utopia, he is lost in Insomnia.
So goodnight, please sleep tight.
You'll never know if it's day or night...
Close your eyes.
