Welcome to the abandoned world
where the people never say a word
they just close their eyes.

My life starts as a restless heart
mind and soul where never left alone.
I was fearful and so I would hide.

Then one day as I sat to pray
I was heard by something high above.
It's coming even closer, I know.
Will it help me out?

Sometimes I think that I'm losing
all my senses
frightened of what I'm becoming.
But I know that I can't help them if they just
make way for kingdoms that I've heard of.

People heard me wherever I went,
the voices that were calling me
could be heaven sent.

Passing on this sacred word people came to
hear me more and more, so I struggled on
saving their souls.

Sometimes I think that I'm losing
all my senses
frightened of what I'm becoming.
But I know that I won't sacrifice ???
I'm not sure if they believe me
is it really my soul that they'll see?

(Tune your guitar to D and pick as
hard as possible on the strings!)

What have you done, can't you see?
I'm in complete misery.
What have you done, can't you see?
I'm in complete misery.

Will insanity stop me from saving myself?
Oh, please hear me cry
as I pray for you to save me, please,
don't abandon me...
