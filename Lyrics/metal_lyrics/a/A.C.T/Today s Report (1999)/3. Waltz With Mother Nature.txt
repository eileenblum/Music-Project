As you look into your mind
Think about the things that you might see
Vision from the great beyond
Clearly your react, you'll respond

And as the moon will tell it's tales...
You will never fail

Now is the time to open up
(Now is the time to open up)
To look into your precious universe

Something inside is calling you
Believe it or not you will know what to do
To fly oh to fly so high
Something inside is calling you
Believe it or not you will know what to do
To fly, to feel a natural high

Precisous is the mask you wear
You call it skin you also call it hair
Breathing is to give and take
Her love will fill our lungs as he'll wake

And mother nature tells her tales
We will never fail

Now is the time to open up
(Now is the time to open up)
To look into your precious universe

Something inside is calling you
Believe it or not you will know what to do
To fly oh to fly so high
Something inside is calling you
Believe it or not you will know what to do
To fly, to feel a natural high

Something inside is calling you
Believe it or not you will know what to do
To fly oh to fly so high
Something inside is calling you
Believe it or not you will know what to do
To fly, to feel a natural high
