Take my hand and we'll walk through eternity,
what is there left to give?
Nobody ever takes you seriously.
Lift up your arms and we'll jump right out
through empty space.
You took your own life,
but there's no one here left to blame.
At the final stage, there's no one you can get past through,
my destiny, I'm glad to see you all.

Why bother? Why even care?
You're gone now, there's nothing left to say.
Who cared for you? Who really did?
You're gone now, there's nothing left to say.

Smell the air as you run through the clouds with me.
Can you believe it's true?
Nobody ever really cares for you.
Laugh as we fly, punch a hole right
through the clear-blue sky.
You'll hold on to life so tight,
you'll never see the day turn into night.
And at the final stage, there's nothing left to hold on to,
you cannot see, the sadness in us all.

Why bother? Why even care?
You're gone now, there's nothing left to say.
Who cared for you? Who really did?
You're gone now, there's nothing left to say.

(motto vivo con fuoco a piacere)

Why bother? Why even care?
You're gone now, there's nothing left to say.
Who cared for you? Who really did?
You're gone now, there's nothing left to say.
