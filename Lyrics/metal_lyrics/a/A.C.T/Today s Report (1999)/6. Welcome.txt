All these people that I've gathered,
they all have one thing in common.
And they know it will fulfil their dreams.

As we travelled through the ages,
all we saw was death and hunger.
Still we knew we would succeed at last.

We started to hear voices all around us,
saying things we had never heard before.
They told us that humanity was falling,
then we knew what we were supposed to do.

Come visit me,
everyone is welcome here.
Don't be afraid,
I will stand by your side.

Come dance with me,
everyone is free to join.
If you join my world,
nature will support you.

You can watch us on the TV,
the preacher on the program that's me.
Now I have a house in Beverly.

If you're blind, unable to see.
You just send some money to me.
With my hands in perfect health you'll be.

We claim that we hear voices all around us,
nothing else but a trick for media.
We told you that humanity was falling,
might be true but there's nothing we can do.

Come visit me,
everyone is welcome here.
Don't be afraid,
I will stand by your side.

Come dance with me,
everyone is free to join.
If you join my world,
nature will support you.

(symphonic beauty)

Come visit me,
everyone is welcome here.
Don't be afraid,
I will stand by your side.

Come dance with me,
everyone is free to join.
If you join my world,
nature will support you.
