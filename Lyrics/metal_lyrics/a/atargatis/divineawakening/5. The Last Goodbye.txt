The sea out there is calling my name
In a time when the moon is guiding my way
When the waves seem to reach for my hands
Goodbye my friends I have to go
To a land like a dream I know
And if love makes you blind you make me see
And if pain needs a victim it turns to me

I'll remember you youhave shown me the way
I have to go

Now I've reached the final end
I hope I have gone the way you've meant
When the sea is pouring my blood on the shore
I hope you were worth to die for

Love,regret,fear and hate.
All these emotions never will fade......
