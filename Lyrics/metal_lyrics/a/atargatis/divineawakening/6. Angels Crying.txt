Love, regret, fear and hate
All these emotions never will fade
Hear, they are calling from the other side
And are wondering just who we are
With eyes so full of pride

Pain is to bleed as the worn flesh decays
Life torn apart, the end's on its way

Never let this happen
Hear the angels crying

In darkest blood, through despair left concealed
Suffer unfulfilled dreams out of wounds never healed

Never let this happen
Hear the angels crying

Force fed by chaos, erupting disease
Fragments of scattered realties

You have never thought about losing your soul

Forlorn souls echo through visions surreal
Stifled hoarse cries with salvation's last tear

And now you've found it out
You are lying on the ground

At one cold dark night, no stars glittering
Lost souls whimper with fright
And voices are singing

In the ashes of a tortured world
They cease to be emerging
From the ashes in a fatal sympathy
And for the last time
Hear them scream in never-ending pain
The mightiest wings even cannot escape
Hell's wrathful flame

Fed by human arrogance, no regard to nature
They trusted in manmade hate

Angels crying
Angels crying
My angel's crying
When angels crying
The taunting demons arise

Now their loud cries echo through the night
While they beg for remission by the spherical might
No one will forgive this hate bred misery
And the angels are still crying, their eyes are full of tears
