A burning nova in far spheres expands and burns
Out of the inner core and sending comets through the skies
Shot with flaming trail

Boundlessly they rush through the spheres and enter earth
The atmosphere ablaze with massive fireballs
That crush into the ocean tides

Nova comets burst the sea
Earth crust burning, waters steam
Nova comets burst the sea
Waters flooding irresistibly

Come, drift into the wonder
Into the last shining of the light
Come, drift into the coldness
Into the silent eternal night

A burning nova in far spheres expands and burns
The atmosphere ablaze with massive fireballs
That crush into the ocean tides

Waters invade the seashore life and territy
Creatures on their run from the invasion in their realm
But in vain
