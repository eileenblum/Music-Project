I'm crucified
For the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away

Prophets I've been reading
Stories I've been told
Before I end my breathing
I travel in the soul
Where thorns are a teaser
I've played a double jeu
Yherushalaim at Easter
I cry I pray mon Dieu
I cry I pray mon Dieu
I cry I pray mon Dieu
Adieu mon Dieu

I'm crucified
Crucified like my Saviour
Saintlike behaviour
A lifetime I prayed

I'm crucified
For the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away

I'm crucified
Crucified like my Saviour
Saintlike behaviour
A lifetime I prayed

I'm crucified
For the holy dimension
Godlike ascension
Heavens away
