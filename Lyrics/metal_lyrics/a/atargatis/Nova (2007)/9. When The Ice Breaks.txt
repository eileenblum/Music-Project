Don't feel too safe, but don't hesitate
Ice breaks you if you walk too fast
Although you followed the right way
And have been so cautious

Sometimes all seems to be so secure
Oh but the ice breaks
You've ever felt so safe
In the warmth around you
But when the ice breaks

The ice breaks
The ice breaks

You think that you stand on secure ground
Confirmed it in a million times
But the ground below your life
Is made of oh so breakable ice

Underneath your feet
Underneath your life

You have never done anything wrong
Oh but the ice breaks
You have never thought
It would happen to you
But soon the ice breaks
