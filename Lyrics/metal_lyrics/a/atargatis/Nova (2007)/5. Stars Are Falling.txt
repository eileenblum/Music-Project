You never wanted
To be so alone in this life
No one is near you
You're carried away from your fate

You ever wanted
To feel only warmth at your side
There's only grey clouds
That darken your firmament inside

A black hole is calling for you
The moon envies your light
See the stars falling beside you
Leave pale faces with no eyes

A dead sun, already burnt out
Is the only fellow near
See the stars falling beside you
Leave pale faces with no eyes
