Trails of comets burst through the void
Inflaming worlds, pervading the core
Erupt an atmospheric surge
They're falling falling as ashen rain

Didn't he come like an angel - firebird
Didn't he come like our savior

Mighty wings
The firebird
Bear a sacred aim
Firebird's trail
Trailing us
Float through the orbit
And set our hearts on fire

Determined mind
The firebird
From nameless worlds
The firebird emerged
Emerge and shine
He had left his red mark
On our blue earth

Millions of lightened sparks, free like fire doves
Leave earth to welcome our makers from afar
All the primal that we knew from our blue earth
Renewed by a red genesis that sets our hearts on fire

Bear a blazing secret within
And merge it into heat and the wind
For the sacred recreation of life
Emerging, emerging once again
