Why is your mind
So divided and blind?
Whatever's facing me
Is a dark reality

You hold in one hand
Such a promising fate
But your other hand
Hides a disillusioned hate

You're riven inside
You're torn into fire and ice

Your soul, it screams
A fever's smouldering
But it can't enlight
Your heart that's frozen to ice

Your cold eyes
Show no feeling inside
All they say to me
Is lost in eternity

You're riven inside
You're torn into fire and ice
