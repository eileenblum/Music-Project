His love to Fate angered mother nature
A nymph who's hidden on a green lake's ground
To avoid her binding to this human
To avoid soiling nature's majesty

"I'm here on the green lake's ground
Can't you hear me, there's no way out
I'm held behind, under the surface
Am kept away from your honest love"

He asked the wind if it ever had played in her hair
And the grass if it ever felt her touch
Asked the green lake if it mirrored her amber eyes
And lay in silence to hear his innermost

Under the surface he saw her silhouette
Sparkle through the silent surface of the lake
Saw her lying motionless on the waters ground so deep
He despaired for she could not be alive anymore

"I'm here on the green lake's ground
I am still alive, water's magic protects me
Don't you take your last breath
Just continue your life without me"

And he spoke...:
"My only wish has been to share my life with you
In eternity I will bind my heart to yours
I'll be lying next to you so silently
On the green waters ground, oh so deep..."

Not knowing that she was still alive
Well protected by nature's magical might
His only wish has been to get so close to her
He hurled himself into the depth
without taking a last breath

And he jumped...
