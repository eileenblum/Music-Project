Once the island lay
In between the oceans
Peacefully laid to sleep
By the waves' harmony

Waves kissed softly the shore
Ocean's might was held behind
Still trying to keep waters
Divided from land

But by the comets' force
The ocean gathered all its strength
Tremendous waves invade the lands
Cover stones and sand

Once the island held
Shelter for all life forms
Bearing sand and wilderness
Now all is swallowed by the sea
