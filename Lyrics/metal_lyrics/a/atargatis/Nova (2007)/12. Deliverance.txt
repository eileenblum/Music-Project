Who wants to feel deliverance
Whose deepest aim is remission
Let your soul sink and fall into
Just let it fall into the inner me

Memories pass your mind
Journey in your dreams

Who wants to feel deliverance
Has to walk through the twilight fires
Has to give up the own identity
Has to lean back in the storm

And I feel my heart it burns
Will I survive my purifying
Will I raise my hand
For the Lord and my forgiveness

Will I stamp my feet
For the One, the Fallen One
Receive his attention first
Will I choose the wrong
