A whispering eternal, a feather in the winds
Dreaming of tomorrow, to bind your heart
Fever of temptation, a soft sigh in the winds
Dreaming of tomorrow, to find you heart

What you've got you'll never let go
Obsessively bind all to you
No emotion in your life
No living soul inside

What you've said you'll never take back
Hey, are you still breathing?
No emotion in your life
No living soul inside

And then temptation fell into your life
All repressed feelings
burn to come upside

Burn! Burn! Burn!
Burn to feel alive

Hey, what d' you think
You have achieved in the moment
Your innermost is burning, there's fire inside
Never lose control, temptations all around you
Your innermost is burning, there's fire inside

Never lose control
Your innermost is burning

The wind blows away all the ashes of your soul
Your innermost is burning, there's fire inside
A spark heats the blaze flaming in your breeze
Your innermost is burning, there's fire inside
