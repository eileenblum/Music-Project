Side by side, the legions draw nigher
Can't you hear the marching of the Fey?
Step by step through wild raging fires
Can't you hear the marching of the Fey?

Once they wore the angels' gown
Listened to our prayings patiently
Now they come, from heavens down
They arise just for this one more time
To take revenge for all
For all our sins against the divine

Just listen, and fear no more
Everyone of us will pass the edge of time
The earth beneath is rumbling
Bore it such a long, long while
To take revenge for all
For all our sins against the divine
But I won't share your fate

Seek no light for what's lost in the end
Hear it coming, the final command

Leave burning fields, set flames afree
They come to wipe our reality
The angels' sword to clean us all
Clean us from all humans' vast depravity
