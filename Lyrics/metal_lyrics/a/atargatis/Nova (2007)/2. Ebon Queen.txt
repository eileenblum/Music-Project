The strong fore is cutting wave and water
Clashing waves bite into the Ebon Queen

Groaning, she's drawn down and pulled to her side

Ghost voices echo in the canvas
Linens get torn by rain and storm

Dark waters burst in and crush her defenses

I will lead you through the dark storm
I will lead you to your end
Follow me along the lifeline
To your nemesis

Water's ghosts arise
Unleash the wave

The storm in me arises
The storm in me arises
Now the Ebon Queen is mine
The storm in me arises
The wave in me arises
Now the Ebon Queen declines
The storm in me arises

Aimless crew on board is rushing around
Desperately try to save the Ebon Queen

Groaning, she's drawn down and pulled to her side

Ghost voices pleased sing in the rain
Can't await being joined by a new crew

Dark waters burst in and crush her defenses
The voices cry out in their triumph again
