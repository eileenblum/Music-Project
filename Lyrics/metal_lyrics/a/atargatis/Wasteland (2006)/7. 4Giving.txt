You are leaving - never giving,
Take only anger with you.

You're fearing - not forgiving;
At least have to run away, run away!

[1. Str. :]
You are fortuned when life elected you,
It will surround your soul.
Feels like a little kiss
Of a gentle breeze.

So lay down
your heavy coats and move on within its covering,
When fortune touched you
And carries you along.

You are leaving - never giving,
Take only anger with you.

You're fearing - not forgiving;
At least have to run away, run away!

[2. Str.]
Move on fortuned;
beware its kiss on your cheek.
So loose all
burden from your soul

And seize the chance
That life may give you to open you the right way.
When fortune touched you
And carries you along.
