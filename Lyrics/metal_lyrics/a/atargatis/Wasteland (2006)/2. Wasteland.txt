Dryness fell over the land of Man,
For they have turned the landscape by their wasting hand.
Dried up earth and only fruitless soil,
Every look you take shows that they have lost control.

Only bare feet left that are wandering through red sand,
only bare feet left, that walk on.

Wretched creatures in former times called Man
Try to hide their knotty limbs from the burning sun.
They are naked, their skin is like parchment,
still wandering to discover fertile land.

Only bare feet left that are wandering through red sand,
only bare feet left, that walk on.

"Tell us the way out of this odyssey.
Fill the oasis for you are the water's heir!
Forgive the destruction for our fathers 've failed.
Don't turn our quest into an infinite, wrong way!"

No one's left to continue mankinds trace,
That marked the land so unpardonably,
The seekers lose the last human domain,
Evolution will wipe out their pace!

Only bare feet left that are wandering through red sand
only bare feet left, that walk on.

I can't hear you anymore, my patience is lost.
You are the sons of hate, for your fathers failed.

Be at least as wise to give up and let
Nature heal itself without your destructiveness!
