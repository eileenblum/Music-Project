The tears the heaven cries
Drop down to the earth
And take with them a spark of life!

While they are falling,
they melt into the sea,
where his mortal body lies.

"Ascend and spread your wings
to find back to the cheerful
heart that you belong to.

Ascend and you will feel the glory,
as now your tears of life
pour into the sea"

One of this myriad tears
Brought him back to his life.
And a flash went through his limbs.

He absorbed the
ascending essence of the light,
And his bright silhouette arised.

"Arise, ascend and spread your wings
to find back to the cheerful
heart that you belong to.

"Ascend and you will feel the glory,
as now your tears of life
pour into the sea"
