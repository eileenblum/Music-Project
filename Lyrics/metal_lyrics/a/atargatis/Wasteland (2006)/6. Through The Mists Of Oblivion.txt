Fall into the mists of oblivion.
Dive through the sea of oblivion.

Upon a wish I crawl, upon a will I call to thee
Upon the might I fall and shall not belong in here

Lay your body down, the moon will save your soul.
Fall through the mists of oblivion.

Sleep in the mists
Inhale their scent so mystic
Weep upon immenseness
Shivering beneath the tears shed

Upon a wish I crawl, upon a will I call to thee
Upon the might I fall and shall not belong in here

Melt into the one
The unexpected is to come
As massive tides descend upon us
A new era has begun in here

Awakening the force
Bound to propel this process forth,
Bound to unleash this sacred scent
The loss of somethin innocent it has born.

Hear the winds silently whispering,
Fear of unborn entities revealed, with frozen eyes they stared at you
Far too long the tides are turning, the night is burning
With frozen eyes they stared at you

Upon a wish I crawl, upon a will I call to thee
Upon the might I fall and I shall not return to the ruins left in here
