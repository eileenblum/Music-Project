Tormented souls mark her rise.
For as they mold through a dark, lonely sigh
Into a glow

Who's not enchanted by the trembling light,
Selina's moon is sending to the earth?
See her, walk side by side,
the widow leads you into the night.

Who's not enchanted by the fateful sound,
Her voice gets through your innermost part.
See her, walk side by side,
the widow leads you into the night.
Feel no warmth in her veins,
only the lust for your life beats in her heart.

The moonrays are wandering over the waves,
They follow her footpath into the sea.
Selina - bright widow of the pale moon
Selina's darkness may embrace you soon.

See her, walk side by side,
the widow leads you into the night.
Feel no warmth in her veins,
only the lust for your life beats in her heart.

Selina - follow her into the night
Selina's face is so pale but so bright
Selina's shadows are floating through the night
Selina's hair catch the silver moonlight
Selina's face is so pale but so bright
Selina - follow her into the night, into the night
