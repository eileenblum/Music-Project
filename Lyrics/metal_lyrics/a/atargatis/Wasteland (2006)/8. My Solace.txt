Be sorrowless - you may find your solace in Them.
Feel carefree - and don't hide your despairing face in your hands.

Be sorrowless - don't bury your memories beside Them
Feel carefree - and you may
follow Their sacred path, follow Their pace.

A shiver is running down your spine
as They walk beside of you, but they can't be seen.
They take all harm away, like you are in mothers arm,
watch every step you take and keep fortune apart.

They expect no word of grace to dignate all Their care.
Just on the other side we'll recognize
Their loved faces as the familiar ones
of our beloved dears, we've lost in life.

Be sorrowless-In their embrace you'll be able
to guard your nearest, and now they can find their solace in you!
