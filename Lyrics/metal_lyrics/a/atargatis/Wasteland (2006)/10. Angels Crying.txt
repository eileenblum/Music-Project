Love, regret, fear and hate,
All these emotions never will fade.

Hear, they are calling from the other side.
"And are wondering, Just who we are, With eyes so full of pride

Pain is to bleed as the worn flesh decays
Life torn apart - the end's on its way

Never let this happen, hear the angels crying!

In darkest blood, through despair left concealed
Suffer unfilled dreams out of wounds never healed

Never let this happen, hear the angels crying!

Force fed by chaos, erupting disease
Fragments of scattered realities.

You have never thought about losing your soul.

Forlorn souls echo through visions surreal.
Stifled hoarse cries with salvation's last tear.

And now you've found it out, you are lying on the ground.
At one cold dark night, no stars glittering,
Lost souls whimper with fright and voices are singing.

In the ashes of a tortured world they cease to be.
Emerging from the ashes in a fatal sympathy.
And for the last time hear them scream in neverending pain.
The mightiest wings even cannot escape hell's wrathful flame.

Fed by human arrogance, no regard to nature,
They trusted in manmade hate and abused their earthen life.

Now their loud cries echo through the night,
While they beg for remission by the spherical might.
No one will to forgive this hate bred misery.
And the angels are still crying, their eyes are full of tears.
