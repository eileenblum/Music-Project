[Music: Stelios Nomikos, lyrics: Hel Pyre]

Diabolical pyre in me
Setting me alive, reflecting the free
Devour, I am relentless
I'm raising high what's down below

Enslaved in dark shadows
As the outcast I march alone
Covered in desire
To empower with my sins and destroy

I have lived through blood
I have lived through fire
Endured the pain of fake desire
Alone with raw, immense power
I free myself from the biggest liar
Shaming the gods
Show the world
I am the one
Marching on
Breathe every weak soul
Bring them underground
To the creator of all

Walk on flesh and bones
With crooked wings
As the earth exhales blood and breathes in souls
Where time is ice and its cut burns
Staring into the dust of all flesh

Listen to my echoes
In my perfection
And pray for my wrath
I am divine power
I'm burning higher
Than any martyr god
