[Music: Stelios Nomikos, Lyrics: Hel Pyre]

Fighting me in my ground
To my ego I am bound
Reaching now the lowest of the low
And only down is left to go
It's the enemy in me
I just need to break free

I'm dwelling under my skin
I lead the trap I'm in

Fighting through my deep depression
Screaming through my darkest thoughts
I need to reach the surface
Need to be more than a ghost

Feel my body decaying
Away from the sun
Sinking in with every breath I take
Seek salvation in the toxic hands

I feel my mind rotting, aching
I'm now done
Need no redemption
In a dream that's never ending
In the nightmare of my soul
I'm lost, I'm slowly fading

I'm dwelling under my skin
I lead the trap I'm in

Fighting through my deep depression
Screaming through my darkest thoughts
I need to reach the surface
Need to be more than a dying ghost
It's never been so dark and cold in here
I need to reach the surface before I'm really gone
