[Music: Stelios Nomikos, lyrics: Hel Pyre]

Forging the mind
Human designs
Succeed in world sanity
Hypnotic eyes
Deafening lies
Deny the soul clarity

Orbiting in a sick dying world
Who forms the toxic, who leads the weak on
Defend against forced oblivion
Misleading trails of pain to walk on

Bonding us with insecurity
Breathing screams in silent agony
Repetitive patterns bound to fade in time
Pride is key in blind authority

Burning skies falling down as we crawl
In mind corruption, in desolation
Degenerates of a lost perfection
Deciding dead fates for generations

Bonding us with insecurity
Breathing screams in silent agony
Repetitive patterns bound to fade in time
Pride is key in blind authority

Desolving kind
In empty smiles
Align to force gravity
Deserted shrines
Distorted rights
No god survives vanity

Bonding us with insecurity
Breathing screams in silent agony
Repetitive patterns bound to fade in time
Pride is key in blind authority
Trust the past
The circle coming back
Arrogance is bound to never last

Decaying, fading
Decaying, down below
