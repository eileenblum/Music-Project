I remember when I was just myself
When the voices were quite in my head
What a blurry image
I can't understand
How much time has passed
Since I lost my mind

No God
No God can judge me now
No Man
No Man can heal me
It is just distorted memories
I'm left with my lucid dreams

All I have now is my agonies
Everywhere I see my worst enemies
I know there's no turning back
After everything turned black

No god no!
You can't leave me here
I don't belong here
No god no!
You can't be real
This ain't happening

There are reasons
That brought me in this place
I don't care how
It never made sense
Suddenly I stop
Recognizing
My face is gone
Can't see anything else

All I have now is my agonies
Everywhere I see my worst enemies
I know there's no turning back
After everything turned black

'Well there are those little voices...
They tell me to behave...
And then there are those louder voices...
They tell me to kill myself and find others to slay...
I try not to listen but it's getting kinda hard...
I cannot escape they keep telling me...
Maybe it's you the first that should die by my hand...
Or maybe not the first...
I must be losing track...'

[Solo - Cyan]

No god no!
You can't leave me here
I don't belong here
No god no!
You can't be real
This ain't happening

Leave me alone
Get outta here
You've no idea
This must be a mistake

No stop no!
You can't lock me here!
This can't be happening to me
