I am my own illusion
I thrive in my delusion

Crawling and weeping and blame the unfair,
You are the weakest in times of despair
Can't find your own self under that skin,
Lazily waiting on others to lean

You're almost hypnotized
You're living in trance
You go by the clock, you leave nothing in chance
You work and consume, you live and you die
You follow the circle, youÎ²â¬â¢re blind by a lie

I am my own illusion
I thrive in my delusion

I want my safety, my future of lies
I want my comfortness, my hunger for lies

You should pay more attention, you should listen closely
It is your soul talking, it's aching to break free

Stop living quietly
Stop thinking yourself
This can't be the world you want
This is your personal hell

It is you
About you
This is what happens to you
Think!
Before time runs out
Wake up and Think!

[Solo - Cyan]

Do now something about it
This can't be the world that you want
Go ahead, do something about it
This can't be the place you belong
