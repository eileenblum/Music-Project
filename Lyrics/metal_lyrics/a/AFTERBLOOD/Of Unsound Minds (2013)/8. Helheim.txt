Stig inn i hennes rike
Dra til Hel
Mot din endelige dom
Dra til Hel

Annihilation for all unworthiness
Remuneration, few chosen are the blessed
Is this the ending
I walk the path of Death
The Queen of Nine worlds
I stand before the Judge of Fates

Half human, half dead
Guardian and ruler
Beware the two-face head
Hel awaits to judge your soul
Offspring of light and plague of the underworld

Daughter of Loki fulfil your gruesome deeds
Fallen from Asgard, in Niflheim she's lurking deep
Bringer of sorrow, of sickness and decay
I stand in horror
My death has just began its way

You stand before me
For showing fear before your enemies
For deserting your brothers in battle
For shaming the blood of your ancestors
To the lowest level
I condemn you to my domain

[Solo Î²â¬â Cyan]

Half human, half dead
You see her face,
You know this is the end
Hel awaits to judge your soul
Hel awaits to make the final call

[music: Cyan]
[lyrics: Hel Pyre]
