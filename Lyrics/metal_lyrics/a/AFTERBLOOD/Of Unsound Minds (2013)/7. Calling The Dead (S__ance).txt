Ache and agony
Can't take no more
I can't deal with this
On my own and now
Rise from the beyond
Make right my wrong
I don't care what it takes
Just talk to me

I command the league of darkness
Join
I'm the chaos, the art of madness
Join

Peaceful life in return of my soul
Tell me what you want
I will deliver
Pain and sorrow has taken its tall
End my misery
Take my life

I command the league of darkness
Join Me, Join Us
I'm the chaos, the art of madness
Join

Calling the dead, I am calling the dead

Calling what I shouldn't have called
Getting greedy
Now with my soul in your hands I'm alive
I no longer act on my own
Getting crazy
Time to let my senses go numb, they arrive
Leaving my despair in the past
Getting better
Is it me or is it just them, can't decide
WonÎ²â¬â¢t look back
No matter the cost make it happen
No more pain
I'm ready to start my new life

[Solo - Cyan]

I command the league of darkness
Join
I'm the Chaos, the art of madness
Calling the dead

[music: Cyan]
[lyrics: Hel Pyre]
