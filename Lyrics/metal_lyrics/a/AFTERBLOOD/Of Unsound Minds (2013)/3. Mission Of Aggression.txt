[feat. Tom Angelripper][Hel Pyre &amp; Tom Angelripper]
I need a miracle
[Hel Pyre]
That's what I'm looking for
[Tom Angelripper]
Without caring how
[Hel Pyre]
Without knowing when
It's what will save me
Will bring me back to life
It's what will heal me
Force me to open my eyes
[Hel Pyre &amp; Tom Angelripper]
I need a miracle
[Hel Pyre]
(and) I need it now
I cannot wait much longer
[Hel Pyre &amp; Tom Angelripper]
My patience's now over

[Hel Pyre]
It cannot start without you
It can't exist beside you

[Hel Pyre &amp; Tom Angelripper]
Suffering unites
Our right for better lives
The only true obsession
Our sole obligation
Words regain their power
Voices screaming louder
The mission of aggression
Society at war

[Tom Angelripper]
Look into your soul
[Hel Pyre]
Stare into your mind
Find the reason
[Hel Pyre &amp; Tom Angelripper]
Why you're so fuckin' blind

[Tom Angelripper]
You know that something's wrong
[Hel Pyre]
You feel it deep inside
You see it all around
[Hel Pyre &amp; Tom Angelripper]
then why you try so hard to hide

[Hel Pyre]
Suffering unites
Our fight for better lives
The only true obsession
Our sole obligation
Words regain their power
Voices screaming louder
The mission of aggression
[Hel Pyre &amp; Tom Angelripper]
Society at war

[Hel Pyre]
It cannot start without you
It can't exist beside you
You close your eyes then so do all
You keep them open
Avoid the fall

[Solo - Cyan]

[Hel Pyre &amp; Tom Angelripper]
Suffering unites
[Hel Pyre]
Our right for better lives
The only true obsession
Our sole obligation
Words regain their power
Voices screaming louder
The mission of aggression
[Hel Pyre &amp; Tom Angelripper]
Society at war
[Hel Pyre]
War
