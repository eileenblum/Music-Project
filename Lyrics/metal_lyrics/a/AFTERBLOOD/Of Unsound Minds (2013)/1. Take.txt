What I can offer is never enough 
All you do is take and never give back 
You limp your way around and I am your stand 
Devour all my thoughts and leave me blank 

And it's just came to this 
Where all you do is 

Take, all I give 
And then take more, take everything 
Leave me with nothing left to feel 
Because you can 

You know you are broken 
You feel so wrong 
You should be underground 
You should be gone 

One way to end this now, 
Kill all the sickness 
You're like the world to me, 
The world is useless 

And it's just came to this 
Where all you do is 

Take, all I give 
And then take more, take everything 
Leave me with nothing left to feel 
Because you can 

[Solo - Cyan]

You hopeless vulture 
You bag of meat 
You crawling maggot 
You spineless creep 
You son of cowardice 
You mindless sheep 
You broken human 
You piece of shit

[music: Cyan]
