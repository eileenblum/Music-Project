[feat. Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen][Hel Pyre]
Break the masks, this is your perfect moment
[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
Raise the masks, find the perfect moment

[Hel Pyre]
Hide the real you, stand there and look amused
[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
Hide your true self, pretend to be amused

[Hel Pyre]
Forbid from others to see just who you really are
[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
Forbid from others to see just who you really are

I know you feel now stronger, this is the guide against the mass
[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
The mask will make you stronger, this is the guide against the mass

[Hel Pyre]
The more I hide
[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
Raise the masks
[Hel Pyre]
The more I hide my emptiness
The more I lie
[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
I know
[Hel Pyre]
Is the reason of my last regrets

[Hel Pyre]
The blank paper's written, the empty wall is carved
[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
The blank paper's written, the empty wall is carved
[Hel Pyre]
My identity's moulded, through the countless different human hands
[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
My identity's moulded, through countless different human hands
[Hel Pyre]
Awaits for me to claim it, make it mine in this life
[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
Awaits for me to claim it, I'll make it on my own
[Hel Pyre]
To cover up my urges, to hide my savage nature
[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
To cover up my urges, to hide my savage nature

[Hel Pyre]
The more I hide
[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
On my own
[Hel Pyre]
The more I hide my emptiness
The more I lie
[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
Hide your true self
[Hel Pyre]
Is the reason of my last regrets

I slowly learn to forget
My bare skin, my true self
Blur image, fading in the past
This innocence was never meant to last

[Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
I know I'm limitless, if only I wasn't me
[Hel Pyre]
I know I'm limitless, if only I wasn't flesh

[Hel Pyre &amp; Antony HÃ¤mÃ¤lÃ¤inen]
I fight with older versions, I struggle with new rules
What truly lies inside will never be revealed
