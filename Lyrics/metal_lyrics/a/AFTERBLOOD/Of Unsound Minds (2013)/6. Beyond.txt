[feat. Waldemar Sorychta]I've been living this life
In pursue of a dream
Endured sorrows and hardships
Never losing my faith
As the years are passing by
And the time flies away
I'm longing to see my own fate
Promises made, soul is eternal, energy will never fade

Beyond my existence
I seek for the truth

I spent my life wanting
To find a destination
I wasted it all waiting
For the god of my salvation

And in the end I'll know
What lies beyond and more

Over and over again
I've been told the same words
There's a reason to live
There's an answer for all
Even when there's no hope and at desperate times
Your belief is what keeps you alive
You will know when it's time, you must never forget
God works in mysterious ways

Beyond my existence
I want to know what is true

[Solo Î²â¬â Waldemar Sorychta]

I spent my life wanting
To find a destination
I wasted it all waiting
For the god of my salvation

And in the end I'll know
What lies beyond is
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing
Nothing

Rust
Rust
Rust
Rust
