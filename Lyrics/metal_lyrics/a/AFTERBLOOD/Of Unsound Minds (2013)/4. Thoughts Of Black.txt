Beginning of the end
Mr. Black got the call
Contract made, signed in blood
Someone is about to die

AssassinÎ²â¬â¢s paid, he's got you in his sights
No remorse, no feelings, no hesitation
They think he's in for the money, no, it's the thrill of the kill

Moves in shadows, he cannot be seen
He takes his place for one more hunting
Target locked, the finger's on the trigger
One more time to make his hunger deeper

AssassinÎ²â¬â¢s paid, he's got you in his sights
No remorse, no feelings, no hesitation
They think he's in for the money, no, it's the thrill of the kill

If only I had a consciousness
If only I gave a damn
What if the victim knows
What if they saw me on my way over here
Thoughts of Black
And then a smile

He holds his breath
This moment, he senses death
(intoxicating)
This is the time
The time he's waiting for
Gently squeezes the trigger
Hears screams in the distance
Sweet music in the air
The sign that the job is done

No remorse, no feelings
No regrets, no escape
They think he's in for the money, no!
It's the thrill, the thrill of the kill
