Beware the only the great the one beware the only the great the ape
Ape eyes open wide from the summit watching the scum
Left beneath and boiling behind something must be done
In the enlightened evolved mind between the fire the wheel and the fright
The grinding machine turns gold into ash
Beware the only the great the one beware the only the great the ape
We march claim enslave rape burn and progress
March claim enslave rape burn and progress

From the hills that I once climbed I am leading legions disease and blight
I will bless the herds of my kind with steel fire and light
I shall return on the flesh of my kin the path to heavens across your skin
I have shown you the steel and left you the light
So march claim enslave rape burn and progress
March claim enslave rape burn and progress

My God, I am unworthy, I am nothing I am scum
My God I urge you teach me now come
Bring steel bring fire bring legions of doom
And groom me and raise me and I will be you
God to Ape God to Ape God to Ape God to Ape
