My enemies are everywhere out in the dark ready to strike
The mighty God was just a dream we have finished the doomsday machine
A million fingers on million triggers million dead angels of million leaders
The enemies are everywhere holding the light ready to strike 

The time has come alarm the rest 
Unleash the apes send angels of death Doomsday Machine 
Terrifying simplicity convincing credibility of Doomsday Machine
