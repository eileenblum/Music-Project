Fire and the straws
I am crawling out of your mind
I am crawling into you house
I will devour your wooden tower
And digest you and leave denied
Fire and the straws
I am coming I am near
I am coming I am here

I enlighten light up the path crawling tamely between ape's eyes
Silent means in hidden wars I am fire and you are the straws
Ungrateful child of gods relentless hateful vine
Treachery in my blood and murder in my mind
Fire and the straws I walk among you
Fire and the straws I crawl onto you

Onto you into you
I have begun the age of joy when gods dance at night
And I descend to bring the end destroyer in the light
