I have come down from the tree and learnt everything
Made a long winding road with curbs of misery
Led your flesh with myself until it is done
Until the road is wide enough for just one ape to god
I come down winding road now it is time fire lit the mould
I will break the shell and deep my fingers in the well
I will use my rules to change you into evolved tools

I break your legs now you shall kneel
I twist your arms and harness your will
I come down winding road now it is time fire lit the mould
I will break the shell and deep my fingers in the well
I will use my rules to change you into evolved tools

Evolve evolve
Ape to god ape to god
Ape to god ape to god
Ape to god ape to god
The horror just began destruction by Apeâs hand
