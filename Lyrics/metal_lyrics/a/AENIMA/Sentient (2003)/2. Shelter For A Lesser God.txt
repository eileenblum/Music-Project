I am the air
The tides, the phases of the moon
I feel your footsteps on Earth
Watch the candlelight
Feel the peace surrounding you
Deliver yourself
Here is the place where you can rest
Far from madness of men
Forgive them all
They will never understand you
And when you leave, forget me not
Iâll always be here
Waiting for you
