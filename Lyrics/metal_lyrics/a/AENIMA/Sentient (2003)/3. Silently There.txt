Here comes the dark
To kiss our eyes
Here comes the dark
To kiss my mouth

I am silently there
You canât reach me
Iâm swimming in the moonlight
Beneath the stars

Here comes the dark
To kiss our eyes
Here comes the dark
To kiss my skin

Sister moon
Come and play with me
Sister moon
Come and dance with me
Sister moon
Come play with me
