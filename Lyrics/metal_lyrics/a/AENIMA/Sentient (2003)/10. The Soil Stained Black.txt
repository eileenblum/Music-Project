A shackled mind awakens from itâs urban slumber
To find the ancient dungeons of its existence
An unforgiving sun lays bare
The concrete that blandly shapes the bitter real
And the question lingers
Is there life after love?

Loveâ¦

Come with meâ¦

Weâll flee from this cold steal decay
And sail across an ocean of pain
To find restful solace
In a remote land of dreams

And in drifting away
Weâll lift the darkest veils
To uncover the morbid mysteries
In the innermost depths of the soul

Soulâ¦

Enter the forest
Touch the universe and all its stars
Gaze at the pale moon
In all of its subtle charm
And your melancholy eyes
Will come to realize
That unbridled beauty may grow
From this soil stained black
