Wherever you are, I wonât be far

There lies the sun, right behind the moon
Dancing with the stars
There lies the moon, right behind the sea
Here lies my heart in your hands, so you could last forever
I spilt my blood in your path, so you could be immortal
Here lies my hear in your hands
Here lies my blood in your path
This is my eternal love
Remember once I was yours
