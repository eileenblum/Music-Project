In a hidden place two lovers mourn
Behold this tear for you, it will be the last one
If I could have the power to enlarge the night
So I can watch you forever, so pale, under the moonlight
And I know this will be your last glance of radiance to me
Your light is fainting in my eyes as I watch you leaving
Stayâ¦ wonât you stay with me?
And lay here by my side
Stayâ¦and let me feel your skin
As pale as the moonlight
In a hidden place two lovers mourn:
âIf you look to the stars, will you mourn with me?â
But your words are so cruel that they could smash my soul
And again, and again, but I could never live without
I rather stay, than to be alone
Stayâ¦ wonât you stay with me?
And lay here by my side
Stayâ¦ and let me feel your skin
As pale as the moonlight
Stayâ¦ why donât you stay with me?
And lay here by my side
Stayâ¦ and let me feel your skin as pale as the moonlightâ¦
Here the song of the night
The nightingale is singing for meâ¦
