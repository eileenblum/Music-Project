Iâm watching, clearly, your reflection on the mirror
I feel scared to dance with you on your limbo
Lilith, thereâs no joy in my mornings
Only tears and confusion of mind
Even the sun will shine no more
Silent, I watch
You spread your fear, then lay beneath the clouds
Silent, I watch
You cast your spell through the crowd
And I watch you smiling
And I watch
You cast your spell on me
