Do you remember me
When we ran like kids through those long halls?
Do you remember me?
You said our souls would be one forever
Do you remember me?
You healed all the wounds I had for years
You showed me there was a light at the end of the world
So guide me into your light

I remember your eyes undressing my soul, unveiling my soul

You said there was a light at the end of the world
That you would be my guardian angel forever
You told told me we would never be apart again
How I would like to believe in youâ¦
