Donât go
Donât leave me here, in this state of apathy
For all that once was or might have been
Once I felt the warmth of your lips
Now Iâm standing all alone while youâll be with someone else
Youâll see
As Iâm regretful now, you shall be, too
For all that once was or might have been
Once I felt the warmth of your lips
Now Iâm standing all alone while youâll be with someone else
I stand here all alone
I know youâll be with someone else
