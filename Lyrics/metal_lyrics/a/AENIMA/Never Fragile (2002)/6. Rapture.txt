To be a part of your smile
To be a part of your heart
To take away the pain from your heart
Who knows, someday, I will understand you
Iâm looking at your soul
I close my eyes to your twisted mind
Who knows, someday, I might understand you
For you, I burned down my sacred garden
I drowned my hopes and dreams
And everything that I believe in is all dust now
How come I lose my pride so easily?
And once again I close my eyes
I donât mind letting myself go
And feeling the joy when you laugh
