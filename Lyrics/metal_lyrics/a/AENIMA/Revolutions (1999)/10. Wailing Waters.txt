And she looked into the woods for the last time
The waves will cry her name forever
She covers her eyesâ¦ she can see the trees no more
She covers her earsâ¦ she can hear the wind no more

Turn around, walk away
And close your heart, youÂ´ve lost your path

Where is the blaze of your eyes?
Now it's lost in mists of Time
When you swim in the waters
Maybe your sorrows are left behind
Where is the blaze of your eyes?
Now it's lost in mists of Time
Where is the blaze of your eyes?â¦
Tell meâ¦ You can't stand the cold inside
You're dyingâ¦

Do you remember the first day when you walked into the woods?
