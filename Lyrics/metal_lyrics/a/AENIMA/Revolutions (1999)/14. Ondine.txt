Eyes like silver beholding the one who plunged into the sea
He felt there was someone there, behind the greenish seaweeds
A forthcoming, so magical
Serenity is surrounding herâ¦
She is singing to youâ¦
She gave you the kiss of life
Give her your hands and go with her
For you shall see the surface never againâ¦
