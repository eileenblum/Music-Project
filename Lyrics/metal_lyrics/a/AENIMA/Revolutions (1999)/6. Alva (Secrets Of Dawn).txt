When the first ray of sunshine comes
The morning dew refreshes my skin
My warm breath against the cold air
My bare feet tread upon the fallen leaves
Before the sun rises and fills the sky
The shadowed woods are delighting my eyes
Here, the wind whispers riddles
Now I know all lost secrets

I search for the treasure in the woods of Mother Earth
I found the answer in the dawn â¦Alvaâ¦

I am near a fountain
Silver drops are baptizing me
I write my name in the water
A smell of roses in the air, so sweetâ¦
