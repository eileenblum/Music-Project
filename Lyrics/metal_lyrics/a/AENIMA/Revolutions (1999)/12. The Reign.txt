I'm with the coldest God watching the joys of mortals
I'm hidden in the fog, in fear that they'll hear my sorrows
I'm at the gates of dreams, although my hopes are empty
While my soul turns into frostâ¦

The wasteland is my kingdom
All I hear is silence
There's just the desolation of a reign of bitterness and sorrow

I'm with the coldest God, watching the joys of mortals
I'm hidden in the fog, because it brings me comfort
I'm bound to my own grave
There is no one to pray for me
I chose to be alone

Fairies are removing the green circles from the forest
They know there is no place for them anymore
Fairies know they have to leave the forest
Where is my faith? Oh, my guardian angelâ¦
Where is my hope?
