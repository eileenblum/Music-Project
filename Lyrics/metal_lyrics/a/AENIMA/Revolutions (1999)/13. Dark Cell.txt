Wanderingâ¦ lonelyâ¦ in this dark cell

I want to leave them all
But they don't let me go away
Slowly I die in this place
But no one cares, no one wants to know
And angels of tranquility, floating
Above me, soothe me once again
I close my eyes, but I'm still feeling
...that I'm confined to this cage

â¦And I close my eyesâ¦
When I fall asleep,
I feel relieved,
I'll be away from those empty eyes,
I fall asleep,
I will not see
...those empty shells surrounding me

And I close my eyesâ¦
While the spirit's misery is growing
I try to warn them all
But they were already dead
