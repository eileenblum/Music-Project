I live far away
My home is in the wilderness
I deceive the pain
I sing to soothe the dreamers
I long eternally for so divine a feeling
Sleep haunts me no more
I watch my love forsaking meâ¦.

You can see a void inside of me
The moon conforts me while I'm so lonely
I dance between the stars they light my way in dark filled skies

Silently when no one's watching I'll leave
I've realized thereÂ´s nothing left for me
And the rain starts to fallâ¦
