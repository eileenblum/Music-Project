Awakened in a dream
Surprised but not rested
Unexplained loss of time
One day one week or more
Prowling through the ruins
Greener more sinuous
Why did the notes lead me here
Time will tell

No birds no sound but my feet
Won't know the purpose
(of the maze)
Until I reach the end of it

Outbreak
The arch I see
Something is coming
And then I feel catatonic

(In the maze of a nightmare)
You can forever wait
For the time to awake
(In the maze of a nightmare)
It never happens
The scars hurt for real
(In the grip of a warlord)
His four red arms grasp you
And shred your flesh
(In the maze of a nightmare)
Nothing left but unfurl
A white flag and flee

Endless turmoil of dementia
All the exits lead to the fight
Damned town without
Any landmark
All is done to feel an outcast
Oh why I'm here?
One more stone
For the last fine trip
Yes the shrine
The only fleeing place
Ready to confront
The glorious desert of jewels...

(In the maze of a nightmare)
You can forever wait
For the time to awake
(In the maze of a nightmare)
It never happens
The scars hurt for real
(And when retracing your steps)
Nothing's left but to swallow
Your pride and stray
(In the maze of a nightmare)
'Lost a lot and realize it was in vain...
