First I'm too shocked to see
What is surrounding me
The place that wasn't
Supposed to be is still here
(What was that trip?)

The same old statue is watching
Door lonely dreams demolished
The green queen now has begun
Her total recovery

From this dead town emanates
Such powerful destiny
The wind in tall grasses
Is kind caressing my body

I've been running for so long
Why don't I just rest a bit
Tender cushion is waiting
For me, in this field
I just can close my eyes...
