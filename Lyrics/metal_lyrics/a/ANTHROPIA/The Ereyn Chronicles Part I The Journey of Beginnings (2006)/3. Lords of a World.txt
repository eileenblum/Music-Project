We are the ones
Who tuck you
In your unsuspected slumber
You poor little pawn
Blinded by fake hopes
We gave you

For the kingdom
For its glory for its splendour
It doesn't matter
The footpath you stride
What's important is to make
Your goal your pride

"I, pure heir of Paon
I swear to defend
The interests of my land
Of my Empyr
The foes' in my way
Still yield under my arm
I'm ready to summon
The dark Chaos of War!"

Lords of a world we'll be
Pushed by our endless greed,
We grow
Abusers of the minds
Storm the rich to the blind
We rule
Ereyn won't resist, no!

We'll soon now control this earth
(we'll be lords of the world)
All will fall, one by one

Glory to our young majesty
Lead us to our great destiny
Glory to our young monarchy
Lead us to the doomed anarchy

Lords of a world we grow
Helped by our silent monks
So strange
Keepers of all our tomb
They will stand
By our swords sharp-edged
Ereyn should shake right now

We'll soon now control this earth
I, Myrrac, the great emperor...
