Places you're not
Supposed to be in
Ancient walls and fantasy
A place where I stand now

The brook falls out
Of the cave of twins
Stone colossus
With eyes gleaming
Tears on breast
Fountain from high

But why, what is that?
Glints of jewels in their hands
Is this the end

(No way I am lost
front of giants ghosts)
Crawling in chaos

I want to know I am sure
I must fly but I need more
And those eyes staring of me
What's beyond oh mystery

But now!
It's been too many times
I was apart from games
From the lies of rulers
The mirror in hands
Will solve the riddle and...
No what's happening?

(My blood flowing out
The door opens wide)

No eye has seen that
Where the secrets lie
Beyond our minds
(No way we are lost
front of open doors)
One step to the stone
I know I'll be gone

Leaving this fake world...

The answers lie forward
The fountain of tears
The secrets lie here
Beyond Wonderland
Fresh welcoming grounds
Holy shining towns
All our dreams unbound

I'll find the answers
I'll remove the chaos curse
(The way we have found front of giants blind)
Crawling to find...

We'll find the answers
We'll remove the Chaos curse
'Cause there's no end
(Our blood wasted out
the doors open wide)

No eye has seen
Where the secrets lie
Beyond our minds
(The way leading to
Magic is not far)
One step to the stone
And forever gone
Leaving this fake world...
