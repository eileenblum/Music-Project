Transcending the black forest
Step by step
Following the dark instructions
Of Arquel
I stray in these green quicksands

Quench my hunger
With some savage pigs
As Sylvester sprites
Run around me
They toy with me and
Say I will never leave

I captured one to
Stop this masquerade
He begged for mercy
Cried its people's guilt
And their doomed fate
Caused by a lion-snake

"Help us seek and
Kill this bad omen
We'll unlock
The doors of the exit"
Started my hunt my bow
In my left hand

Never been confronted
To such a monster
As I saw this endless body
Twirling round a trunk
Wounded bleeding beast
Fleeing and surrounded
And trapped
As I draw the bow but it shifts

(Shift) (Blurred) (Shape)
The angel is hiding the snake
(Pure) (Grey) (Lamb)
Possessed by a lion consenting pupped

"I'm sorry Amryl... I'm doomed
and the sprites have to pay for
me, it's my burden. But drink,
drink and rest, my mirror is yours,
My house, me, and you're mine!"

Oh mother
Forgive my soul my departure
The tears on your cheeks
But my only guide
Is my instinct now
I cannot even try to flee

Endless dream
Madness cries its scream
Unknown frontier
Pleasure or pain and tears
Wet by shame
Used for an inversed rape
Surrealist scene
Will I even wake up

(Shift) (Blurred) (Shape)
The angel is hiding the snake
(Pure) (Grey) (Lamb)
Doomed mirror's mine
Blood will open the gates
