In a time when the monsters
Meet the dwarfs
In a far aeon of tumult
Ereyn is losing its honour
Under the torn mask of Empyr
People don't risk to walk alone
Eaten raw by their own race
A council seems a bit late now
The only answers lie
With the dead

Where is it gone?
All the wisdom?
Knowledge and art?
It has to stop
We have to find
A way leading

To the Oracle
Deep down beneath the world
Far away to the west
Beyond mounts
Where answers dwell

Now that Chaos is rising up
And the coming days
Will be darker
Only one chance is left for us
And I, Amryl, will take up
This burden
My father Arquel was so safe
His age wasn't troubled
By one threat
I have to dig up
The tomb of the pure
The only answers lies
With the dead

Our sky has changed
No more wisdom
But pain and hate
It has to stop
We have to find
The way leading

To the Oracle
Deep down beneath the world
Under peculiar skies
Beyond mounts where the evil lies

It's just a question of honour
That today seems almost lost
For a question of control
Over the realm that we all love
(Let us live now)
To control us...
