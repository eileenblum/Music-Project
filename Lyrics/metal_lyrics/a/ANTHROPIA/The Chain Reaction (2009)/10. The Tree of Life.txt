As revelation told us
The apocalypse has begun
An open portal fills the sky
Leading to the tree of life

24 thrones in the sky
Are paying tribute to the one
He stands among the seven stars
A sharp two edged sword out of his mouth

His eyes ablazed as a flame of fire
Lightning, thunder, voices rise
Four beasts full of eyes behind
A lion, a calf, an eagle and a man

The breach occurred due to our love
The new physical element yeah
Finally able to touch your hand

I am the alpha and the omega, the first and the last
The beginning and the ending, the one who is
The one who was, the one who is coming, the almighty

Wrapping bliss, this time for real
Our tangled souls warm up again
Astral mating so fusional

Hand in hand
Like this doomed evening
Beyond the gate
Leading to the Garden of Eden

Snake, tempt us
Forgive us (God)
Tree of life
Feed us now!

The consensus is now broken
All the souls gather
And drift away far from Earth
Without return, never...

Like a new Eve and Adam
We condemn our race, doomed our children
Forced to abandon our ground
Bid farewell to the Garden of Eden!

All is lost his word has been spoken
The eight day he destroyed all his work
