First crucial cries in this new strange place
You must not forget...
...the plan of him is suddenly escaping

Your next life won't be as expected, soul
You have to change it

Strange sensation to lose all I was
Remnants of some lives, resetted as I call to mind
Feel I've been brave, not remunerated
You will be some day...
You'll see some change

In the shift, beyond the portal
Incarnation suppresses all thoughts
At our state karma is somnolent
How could we act without remembering all?

Soul 52889, good job!
It was your 665th life, they were all full of joy
Love and happiness
Congratulations, your place near him
Is almost assured now
Nevertheless, pay attention
To your next and last trip to Earth!

In the shift, beyond the portal
Incarnation suppresses all thoughts
At my state karma is obsolete
A new self, a new mind, all I need to rule them all

Yeah, see the change
