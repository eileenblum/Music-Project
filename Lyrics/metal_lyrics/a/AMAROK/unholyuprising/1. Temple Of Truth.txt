I have a one master, which
Stands before me, when
I'm looking in the mirror.
My body is a temple in
Which  my volution reigns.

I entertain in her satan,
Which eyes burns ...with fire
Of aversion and contempt  for mendacius carcasses ...

Church :
Clogged ears
Clossed eyes
Poisoned mind

Open your eyes and look on
The truth,  ...truth you are
You oneself.

Satan - he is reflection humanity
Satan - he knows truth of the world
Satan - he tramples and kill fools
Satan - he strokes smart and brave

Once again will come his era:
Day of truth and glories.
