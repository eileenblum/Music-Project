Will come soon, era of unholy fire
A new uprising...
Uprising of antichristian nations.

Churches will come burn, priest will come drivien away...
Far away from our fatherland.

Unholy fire, spilled blood
...Blood envoys of catholic church
Unholy fire, burning temples
...Temples of ideological lies

Will become avenged like before ages fathers blood.
We will repay for criems of catholic church.
We will release people under depravation.

We will flare up churches as before years
We will put end to christianity
We will  destroy moloch of abstraction.
This day is only matter times.
