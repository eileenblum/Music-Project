Rise,

Rise up nations of the world
And reject dogmas,
Inculcated to you by these
Whiches conceal truth.

Burn, cross of lies and hypocrisy
Burn, cross of innumerable fights
Burn, cross of temples of debauch
Burn, cross of counterfeit god

Awaken yours mind from
A dream and looks:
Crucified saviour never existed
Crucified saviour :
Never rose from dead...
He never existed.

Burn, cross of lies and hypocrisy
Burn, cross of innumerable fights
Burn, cross of temples of debauch
Burn, cross of counterfeit god

Rise again...
