Art of war, art of existence
Destruction of civilizations belongings...

Deformed of value and moral principles exterminate overpopulated lands, the arms race,
Greedy heads, political dispute different states, hostile blood, homeland glory,
Pried and honour in all of us.

...War art, dark side of mankind
Animal craving of blood, shoot murder insanity and anger,
...In all of us.

War versus governments and importunity expansion of imperialistic nation,
Versus promoted culture and religions, war art...
...Existence way to freedom.
