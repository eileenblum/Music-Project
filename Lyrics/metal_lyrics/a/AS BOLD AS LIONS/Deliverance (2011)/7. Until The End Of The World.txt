Inhabit the praise of your people,
Bring Your glory down

Lord fill this room and break these chains that bind us

In a moment that will last for a lifetime
We make our stand and we draw the line

The peace of God will drive his holy resurrection
Our lives are changed, not just for now
But forever and always

Always You are faithful
And never, ever break your promises
In your presence I am still and I know you are God

We who kneel before you, God
We can stand before anyone
Let them fear death,
The ones who do not fear sin

Before there was light, there was sound
Spoken from the mouth of God
With a word He made everything
In a moment we squandered it all

Amazing love, how can it be
That you, my God, would die for me?
