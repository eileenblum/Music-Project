So much adversity in this world
So many voices that would lead me astray
I am surrounded by the weak and the hopeless
I have direction while others go without

I donât have to justify my beliefs to anyone

You criticize the words I live by,
When you donât know them at all
I walk the straight and narrow
Youâve set yourself up to fall
I refuse to believe that this life holds nothing more for me
So you say I am weak and you call me ignorant

Youâre dead wrong

I have deliverance from a life of apathy
Deliverance from the clutches of vice
Deliver my mind from a world that doesnât makes sense
I have deliverance

So much adversity I see in this world Iâm in
So many voices that would lead me into sin
