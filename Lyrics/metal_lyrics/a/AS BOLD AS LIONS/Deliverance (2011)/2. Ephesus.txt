This is the strength of my conviction
This is my will to stand against the flood
Iâm going to dig my heels in
I will never turn my back on you

We are the named
We are fulfillment of a prophecy
Where is your heart?
Where is your courage?
And by the Word of God we stand against the hurricane
Where is your heart?
Where is your courage?

Why do we give up our childhood dreams in favour of becoming cynical?
Our time is short, any day it could run out
So while weâve got life, letâs live it in full

Weâll live life to the full

Where is your heart?
Where is your courage?

You want to know how far Iâll take what I say?
Test me

Iâd give my life before I would step down

I pray we would find the courage to stand up for one another
To follow in God, our Fatherâs footsteps
To bring love to this world

To bring love to this world
To stand up for one another
Letâs bring love to this world and stand up for one another

Bring love to this world
Stand up for one another
Bring love to this world
Stand up
