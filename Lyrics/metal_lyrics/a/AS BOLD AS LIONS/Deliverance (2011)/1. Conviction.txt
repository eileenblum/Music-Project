The conviction of my heart is unbreakable
The strength of my mind is unstoppable
These words that I say carry the weight of all eternity
Stand together right now, this is us chest to chest with the world
Constantly under attack so we fight on
We canât afford to look back

We are As Bold as Lions

The conviction of my heart is unbreakable
The strength of my mind is unstoppable
These words that I say carry the weight of all eternity
