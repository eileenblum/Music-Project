[feat. Jordan Greiner of Stand United]Itâs hard to go on dreaming as my pockets get lighter
My friends all got older and left me alone
But Iâm still holding on to what Iâve always known

I donât want to fit in
I donât care about popular opinion
Donât tell me what this life is
Because I was made for this

My life is not a failure
These dreams will never die
My words wonât go unspoken
While I am still alive

Our time is short
Itâs hard to make a mark
And do something that matters
But when this world forgets my face
I hope they donât forget this

The hope in my heart gets me back on my feet
I will conquer my fears
I spit in the face of defeat

I spit in the face of defeat

I need Your strength when my feet wonât carry me
When Iâm failing and Iâve fallen
Your strength is what I need
You carry me

Itâs hard to go on dreaming but I still try
My friends all got older and left me alone
But Iâm still holding on to what Iâve always known

My life is not a failure
These dreams will never die
My words wonât go unspoken
While I am still alive
