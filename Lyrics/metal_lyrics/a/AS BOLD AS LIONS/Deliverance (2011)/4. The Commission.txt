Iâm so fed up with what I see
People around me arenât living for anything
Distracted, destructive
I wonât stay quiet while things get worse

I mean every word that I say
This world is always against me but Iâm staying the same
If you donât stand up for whatâs in your heart,
Time will see the end of us
But take heart

When your life begins to bring you down
Youâll always find the will to stand
Shoulder to shoulder we will stand together
Donât waste a moment of the time we have

Give me the power to take up my cross
I need Your strength to shine a light to the lost
And when the weight of the world begins to crush me
Fill me with righteous anger

Come and fill me up with righteous anger
I need a hand when my guilt gets me down

In this world you will have trouble
But I have overcome this

I have overcome this world

Behold; I am with you always, until the end of the age
