Here In This Land - My Blood And My Life
But I'm Banished And Cursed For All Time
"Where's Your Brother?", He Asked
And The Sky Turned To Black
"I Am No Guard For Him!", I Replied

So I Walk To The East
The Land Of Dead Barren Hills
Blood-Red Sunset's Left Behind My Back
If You'll Meet Me, My Friend,
You'll Be Cursed Like I Am
Burning Seal On My Heart And My Head

I Cannot Die
It's The Last Final Chord
On My Wrist With My Blade
That I Cannot Play

And I'm Sentenced To Wander
Alone In The Shades

My Brother's Blood
From The Earth It's Calling For Me
All My Offspring Is Damned
Till The End Of All Days
And There's No Repentance, I See...

Bleeding Vicious Light
Pours From Heaven Above
And Horizon's Enshrouded In It...
Father, Your Gift Is Cruel
And So Immense Is Your Sympathy
Like A Stone, Dropped From The Skies
I Am Pounded Down Into Dust

Yes, I Knew It, My Friend,
But Couldn't Believe
Breathless Silence Is All That Will Be...
