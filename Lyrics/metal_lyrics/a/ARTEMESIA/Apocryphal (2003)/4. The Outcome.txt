Time's Close At Hand, When The Blood Will
Wash The Whole Face Of This World
In Crimson Flood Of This Madness
All The Past Life Will Be Gone

Again And Again You're Searching For Mercy
Believe Me, My Friend, You Will Never Succeed
Here Comes The End Of This Infamous Show
On Each Quivering Form A Final Curtain Will Fall

Charred Remains Washed Away By The Rain
Bloody Waves All Around, Waves Of Pitiless Tide
End Of Sorrowful Tale, In It's Horrible Wake
Drifting Shadows On Shore, Ocean Of Human Pain
Screaming Swarming Demise, Tearing Up Through The Ground
No One Shall Stay Alive, Nothing's Left To Enshrine

We're Just Dust In The Wind Blowing The Of This World

We're Just Wandering Shades On Cascading Shattered Walls
I Know There Will Be A New Dawn And Dark Will Be Gone
But Now Emptiness Shines, Abyss Unfolds Before Your Eyes
