Ancient vultures, sentinels, guardians of a future yet to pass
Watching over everything, silently waiting for their time en masse
Stare into the rift of creation
Face what you must fear in the end
Portal, gateway, yielding source, of the ichor, breathing life
Dead and buried, soil born, sepultural resting place of the wraiths of old
Plagued life force, internal parasite
Forced, severed, ethereal third eye
Blinded to the visions of a paradise lost
A blank tapestry, no lesson could heal this frost
Our Earth, we walk alone, the teachings of a past aeon
Breathing life into the dead tongues of elders gone
Sculptured discord, erratic pulse, the slumber of the ancients halts
Arctic winds, solar flux, the roots form entombment, spiritual faults
We have been wrought by our hubris
Our teachings are naught in the eyes of god
Blinded to the visions of a paradise lost
A blank tapestry, no lesson could heal this frost
Our Earth, we walk alone, the teachings of a past aeon
Breathing life into the dead tongues of elders gone
And the stars will blanket our sky
Our warning, heed, the time is nigh
The old ones weep for us
The old ones weep for all of our time
And our stars will shine forevermore
And our ships of light upon the shores
But you must not weep for us
And you must not weep for us all
Our passing glance, our shining source, the precipice we dance upon
Our passing glance, our shining source, the precipice of life enspawned
Our passing glance, our shining source, the precipice we dance upon
