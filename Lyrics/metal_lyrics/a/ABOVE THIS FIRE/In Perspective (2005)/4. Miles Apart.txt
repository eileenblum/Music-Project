You can't see the distance you created has torn us up it's so hard to take and you can't see as the days go on time will be your arsonist time will be your eulogy so what went wrong through everything words went unheard did we fall apart?
Or was it out of sight,
Out of mind I wish I knew how we fell away so fast I know the reasons are few an far between as far as you an me goes it has lost all meaning and value I must move on I cannot give you all of me now because you decided to walk away I must move on and I can't let this happen to me again and for the sake of myself letting go while I watched you fade into thin air I disapprove because of all the heart I invested I seem to play a smaller role now and that's what happens when the days pass so I keep looking forward and keep my eyes on the horizon consider this my farewell note a reminder of yesterday I'm cutting myself loose I'm letting go and this has to stop so reflect back on the past I know this has to be the last time that I resurrect this part of my life for now I'll close this chapter for now,
I'll set myself free and prepare for your reasons the reasons why you turned your back on me I'm cutting myself loose I'm letting go
