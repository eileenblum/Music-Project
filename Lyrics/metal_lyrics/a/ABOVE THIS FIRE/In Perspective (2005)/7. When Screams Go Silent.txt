Sunlight stops the nightmare so it starts again I breakdown by myself your footsteps fade away you'll never know what it's like to see the world through these eyes I look up and wish you'd just fade away I reach out you watch me fall with needles that can't break the skin with words that won't hit their mark this whole time I believed in myself while you were full of doubt you'll never see the world through these eyes I reach out you watch me fall now that it's all clear the very presence of you make me nauseous you decay everything you touch when I leave this place I'll be the stronger one you'll never see the world through these eyes I'm the stronger one
