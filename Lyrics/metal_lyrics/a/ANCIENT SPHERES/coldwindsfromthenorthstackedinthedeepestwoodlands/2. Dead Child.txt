[Lyrics: Jorgen Gonzalez, Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

He betrayed his clan by a mortal's love
He was enslaved by her eyes and
She is a demon who still kisses him
In the nightmaresâ¦
Crying her blood, crying her blood
While the forest sleeps, under the mask of pain
Smiling with pain, now she feels alone
Sleeping in the fog, in her wedding gown
Her dead child, her dead child, her dead child
The moonlight mother
She guard us by our side
We rest waiting for the end
In this chamber of hateâ¦
âDamien Thorn speechâ
The moonlight mother
She guard us by our side
We rest waiting for the end
In this chamber of hate
Now she feels alone, alone
With the soul of her tyrant
While she torment his dreams
Now forest sleep
She only remains dust and bones
While her body rest in the shadows
Her dead child, her dead child, her dead child
She builds everything
And took it away
Remaining only dust and bones
While her body rest in the shadows
The moonlight mother
She guard us by our side
And over the body
We rest waiting
Chasing a feeling she made
Now she feels alone
Resting in the shadows
In the graveyard fog
