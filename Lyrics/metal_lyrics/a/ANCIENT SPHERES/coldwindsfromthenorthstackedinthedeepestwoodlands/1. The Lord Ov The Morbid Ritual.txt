[Lyrics: Jorgen Gonzalez, Music: Adolfo Bejarano and Jorgen Gonzalez]

âCeremonyâ
Death path, your destiny itâs in my hands
All your souls in desperate cry for mercy
My wings fill the sky with bloody rage!
Try to see, crimes of blood, in your sins
Lord, Morbid, Ritualâ¦
My throne your temptation
My breath burn your dreams
Like a cloud of fire in this ceremony of death
Thirstâ¦
Try to see, crimes of blood, in your sins
Lord, Morbid, Ritualâ¦
The blackness embraces our steps
I swear you will remember this day
When the sour god cry in my throne
And I set the eternal nigh
I am the lord ov the morbid ritual
My wings will burn your soul
I destroy your eternal hope
In the mist of sodomize destruction
Blood filth mighty cobra
The blackness embraces our steps
I swear you will remember this day
When the sour god cry in my throne
And I set the eternalâ¦ nightâ¦
