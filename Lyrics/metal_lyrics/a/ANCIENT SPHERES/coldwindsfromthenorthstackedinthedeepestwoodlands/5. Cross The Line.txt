[Lyrics: Ron V.Li. and Jorgen Gonzalez, Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

When we cross the line the day has become!
Light has turned into darkness and pleasure is only madness
I don't feel my legs walking through this placeâ¦
We cross, the line
No place, to hide
We cross, the line
Dying, now!
Emptiness smashing my soul
I don't want to live anymore
Then I look behind the wall
And your voice sound like a door
I open I heart to see and you still there alive
I remember the nights and the days
I was sharing my life with you
You just left the bittersweet feeling
In my chest
We cross, the line
No place, to hide
We cross, the line
Dying, now!
Emptiness smashing my soul I don't want to live anymoreâ¦
