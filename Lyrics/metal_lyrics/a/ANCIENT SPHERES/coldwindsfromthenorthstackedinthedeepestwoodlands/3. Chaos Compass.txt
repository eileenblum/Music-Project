[Lyrics: Ron V.Li. and Jorgen Gonzalez, Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

From depths of hell, from the gates of heaven
A new generation is rising
No order, good an evil merge in one song
Chaos to adore!
Chaos ... Compass
Chaos ... Compass
Angels and Demons that have lost their swords
Beasts of the new world
No reason, no rhyme only chaos compass
Of the new desecration
A new universe full of hate
But nothing to offer
And nothing to take
A chance to save your soul has disappeared
The time has gone and everything has came a mess
No heaven, no hell
A new word ruled by my words
Existence or nothing!
Chaos ... Compass
Days are passing by and the day has become night
A chance to save your soul
Has disappeared
Only chaos compass from my world for a new generation
