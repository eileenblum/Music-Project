[Lyrics: Ron V.Li. and Jorgen Gonzalez, Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

In the darkest chambers of our minds
When the love and hate become one
And the moonlight seems to arise
Invoking our deepest fears
The moonlight has taken our spirits tonight
Moonlight men and beast as one
Moonlight ancient fall
Moonsorrow, Sorrow to our ancient one
Moonsorrow, Sorrow to our ancient one
Why you gave us power?
Power we cannot deny
You make us feel like angels, we feel like fallen stars
Hating everything
No love inside
Putting our reasons aside
Our own freedom has made us die.
Unless we change our thoughts and ways
The moon and the sorrow will merge as one
Phobias...tonight
Phobias...tonight
Moonsorrow... Moonsorrow
Moonlight... men and beast as one
Moonlight...
In the darkest chambers of our minds
When love and hate become one
And the moonlight seems to arise
Invoking our deepest fears
