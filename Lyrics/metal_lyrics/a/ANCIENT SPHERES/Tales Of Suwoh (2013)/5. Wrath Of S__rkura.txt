[Music: Adolfo Bejarano. Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano]

Spirits of thy endless woodlands
I invoke to you, each of you
Attend to my call and become one
A legion beyond the hatred

We were the first
In all this realm
We were here
In the begin of time
Before the time
And the first in times
We were the dark
Lords of these domains

SÃ³rkura's offspring
Wrath of SÃ³rkura

We were the masters
Of all domains
Controlling from shadows
In the night
Countless legions
In the endless dark
Reaching freedom
Ancient spirits, SÃ²rburu

SÃ³rkura's offspring
Wrath of SÃ³rkura

SÃ²rburu legion we are
Countless dark warriors
Ancient spirits prepared
To fight as one
Sentenced by SibÃº
To the underworld
Erased from the face
Of SurÃ¡yum

SÃ³rkura's offspring
Wrath of SÃ³rkura

Wrath of SÃ³rkura...

SÃ³rkura's offspring
Wrath of SÃ³rkura

Prepare to die by the wrath of SÃ³rkura
Prepare to die by the hand of SÃ²rburu
Shining bright is the sword of SÃ³rkura
Shining bright is the sword of SÃ²rburu

Your spherical protection makes us furious
That spherical protection is not secure
You think you are secure? But you are not
That spherical protection is about to fall

Oh mighty incantation
From deeps of the rebellion
Oh mighty incantation
For this wicked protection!

Prepare to die by the wrath of SÃ³rkura
Prepare to die by the hand of SÃ²rburu
Shining bright is the sword of SÃ³rkura
Shining bright is the sword of SÃ²rburu

Your spherical protection makes us furious
That spherical protection is not secure
You think you are secure? But you are not
That spherical protection is about to fall

Oh mighty incantation
Hear the call of the rebellion
Oh mighty incantation
Destroy this sacred protection!

Mighty incantation
Wrath of SÃ³rkura
Mighty incantation
Wrath of SÃ³rkura
Mighty incantation
Wrath of SÃ³rkura
Mighty incantation
Wrath of SÃ³rkura

Fight!
Fight!

Mighty incantation
Wrath of SÃ³rkura
Mighty incantation
Wrath of SÃ³rkura
Mighty incantation
Wrath of SÃ³rkura
Mighty incantation

Destroy!
Die!

Oh mighty incantation
From deeps of the rebellion
Oh mighty incantation
For this wicked protection

Fight!
Fight!

Spirits of thy endless woodlands
I invoke to you, each of you
Attend to my call and become one
A legion beyond the hatred

"The arrival of SibÃº from the stars was fought by SÃ³rkura grandfather of the ancestral spirits, but through spells and rituals these were sent to the underworld after a fierce battle and they are watched through the cosmic temple UsurÃ©, the magical threshold"
