[Music: Adolfo Bejarano. Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano]

I am the eternal
I am the almighty
I am the omniscient
Who commands, who orders

I'm omnipresence
I see the future
I predict death
Nothing is beyond me

I am the immortal haze from the woodlands
I am who can ascend as black cloud
I am who can descend as the storm
I am who can run as a cold streams

I am the eternal
I am the almighty
I am the omniscient
Who commands, who orders

I'm omnipresence
I see the future
I predict death
Nothing is beyond me

I am the immortal haze from the woodlands
I am who can ascend as black cloud
I am who can descend as the storm
I am who can run as a cold streams

Here I amâ¦
Great SibÃº
Here I amâ¦
Great SibÃº
Here I amâ¦
Great SibÃº
Here I amâ¦

I am the eternal
I am the almighty
I am the omniscient
Who commands, who orders

I'm omnipresence
I see the future
I predict death
Nothing is beyond me

I am the immortal haze from the woodlands
I am who can ascend as black cloud
I am who can descend as the storm
I am who can run as a cold streams

Here I amâ¦
Great SibÃº
Here I amâ¦
Great SibÃº
Here I amâ¦
Great SibÃº
Here I amâ¦

The shining...
Will return the magic...
Granted life to...
The ancient spheres...
And only the pure shall know...
The true knowledge!
