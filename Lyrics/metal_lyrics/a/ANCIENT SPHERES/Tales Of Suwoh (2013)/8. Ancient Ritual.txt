[Music: Adolfo Bejarano. Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano]

Here I am...
From the stars
Guided by...
The ancient spheres

Did you knowâ¦
Of my existence?
Now here I am
Ancient spirits

Ancient shadows
Ancient forces
Ancient masters
Ancient slaves

Did you knowâ¦
of my existence?
Now here I am
Ancient spirits

Ancient shadows
Ancient forces
Ancient masters
Ancient slaves

Ancient shadows
Ancient forces
Ancient masters
Ancient slaves

Oh, the thresholdâ¦
Oh, open the thresholdâ¦
Oh, the sealâ¦
The UsurÃ©â¦

We need a ritual
Open the threshold
Give us a ritual
Destroy the UsurÃ©
Lord of the stars
Release your spell
Master of doom
Begin the ritual!

Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind
Ancient spheresâ¦
Into mind

Now the ritual is completed
With the spell of ancient spheres
Now the UsurÃ© is in ashes
By the fire of your mind

Here I am...
From the stars
Guided by...
The ancient spheres

Now the ritual is completed
With the spell of ancient spheres
Now the UsurÃ© is in ashes
By the fire of your mind

Now the ritual has been done...
With the spell of the ancient spheres...
The UsurÃ© has been broken...
With the power of your mind...

Now the ritual has been done...
With the spell of the ancient spheres...
The UsurÃ© has been broken...
With the power of your mind...

"The start of the bloody and brutal battle destabilizes both worlds eight Heavens into one, UsurÃ© is destroyed, the underworld and the physical world are united, the magic of the ancient spheres are depleted, SibÃº was not ever seen again..."
