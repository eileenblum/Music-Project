[Music: Adolfo Bejarano. Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano]

I see the lightning
I see the magic
I hear the bullets
Bullets from the sky

Here is our salvation
Here is our protection
Time to go in the shadows
Tara is blessing us

I am the spirit of thunder
You will hear my voice
You will taste my bullets
Magic bullets from the sky
Shadows still terrorizing
Shadows from the darkness
Shadows still terrorizing
Shadows from the darkness
All these magic spheres are burning me
They are thrown from your giant blowgun in the sky
Guided by the lightning from the gray sky
Tara someday you will pay for this pain
I will keep you away from this domain
Always you will stay under my power
You will never see to my black eyes
You always belong to the dark side
All these magic spheres are burning me
They are thrown from your giant blowgun in the sky
Guided by the lightning from the gray sky
Tara someday you will pay for pain

I see the lightning
I see the magic
I hear the bullets
Bullets from the sky

I am the spirit of thunder
You will hear my voice
You will taste my bullets
Magic bullets from the sky

I see the lightning
I see the magic
I hear the bullets
Bullets from the sky

"With the fall of Diwo at the West, there is only one place that can protect you from dark and cold nights, the only place where the fire will keep warm and keep the ancestral spirits away, that physical shelter which has its reflection in the underworld, the threshold itself"
