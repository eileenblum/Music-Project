[Music: Adolfo Bejarano. Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano]

In the deepest of the haze...
There is something...
And is calling my name...

Oh, is a weak signalâ¦
Oh, it is calling meâ¦
Oh, in the deeps of the hazeâ¦
Oh, it is a magical call!

In the deepest of the haze...
There is something...
And is calling my name...

Oh, is a weak signalâ¦
Oh, it is calling meâ¦
Oh, in the deeps of the hazeâ¦
Oh, it is a magical call!

Wake up!...
The call!...

This magical attraction
Now I can figure it out
Now I feel some different
Iâll follow the call

The journey...
To the call...

Wake up!...
The call!...

This magical attraction
Now I can figure it out
Now I feel some different
Iâll follow the call

The journey...
To the call...

I must to follow this magical call that is calling for me now
There is a mighty magic behind and I can to follow up
That mighty magic that I feel and is waiting for me there
In the dark behind that unknown haze in a distant place

The journey
To SurÃ¡yum

I must to follow the sinister force that is guiding me to it
The call of the mighty magic will tell me what to find up there
Some ancient spheres full of magic I will find up there
In the dark behind the haze is the entrance to the underworld

Wake up!...
The call!...

This magical attraction
Now I can figure it out
Now I feel some different
Iâll follow the call

The journey
To SurÃ¡yum

I must to follow the magical call from the ancient spheres now
There is a mighty magic behind in connection to the underworld
That mighty magic gathered by the ancient spirits in the shadows
In the dark the ally of SurÃ¡ will appear from the star castle

The journey
To SurÃ¡yum

"Your arrival will be eagerly awaited by ancestral spirits, waited for many years, Oh lord of the stars, grant us the power of your castle in the stars, oh SurÃ¡, this malignant presence, only you, can break this curse"
