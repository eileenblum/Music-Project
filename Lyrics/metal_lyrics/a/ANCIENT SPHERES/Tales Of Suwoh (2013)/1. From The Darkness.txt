"Since immemorial times, in cold and dark nights, the evil forces of the ancient spirits leave their abodes to roam freely, bringing destructive winds and freezing waters in the mountains and plains of SurÃ¡yum, name of the sky and land, where SibÃº placed the sacred corn seeds called DitsÃ¹, planted in pairs, of which born the Bribris, and other tribes"

[Music: Adolfo Bejarano. Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano/Jorgen Gonzalez]

This realm was involved in darkness...
Always there...
Theyâll be free...
They will possess this land...
The ancient spirits of darkness will arise...
Silence...
