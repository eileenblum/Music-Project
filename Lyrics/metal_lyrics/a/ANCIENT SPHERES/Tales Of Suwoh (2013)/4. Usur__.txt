[Music: Adolfo Bejarano. Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano]

Eight are its strong pillars
Eight are its old clans
Palms woven on long beams
Its ties as the constellations

Four are these levels
Each a level is a heaven
Four are these heavens
One is the secure place

The mirror...
UsurÃ©...
The mirror...
UsurÃ©...
The mirror...
UsurÃ©...
The mirror...
UsurÃ©...

This is the mirror
Can you see the reflection?
These four physical levels
Existing in the underworld

Eight are the levels
Each a level is a heaven
Eight are these heavens
Eight are the consciousness

The mirror...
UsurÃ©...
The mirror...
UsurÃ©...
The mirror...
UsurÃ©...
The mirror...
UsurÃ©...

Looking the head in the central pillar
It marks the exit route for all the magic
This old place is a sacred refuge
But is a passage to the underworld too

The great and majestic domain of SibÃº
The great and malignant domain of SurÃ¡

Omnipresence alternation of those gods
Converge in this sacred UsurÃ©

The great and majestic domain of SibÃº
The great and malignant domain of SurÃ¡

Looking the head in the central pillar
It marks the exit route for all the magic
This old place is a sacred refuge
But is a passage to the underworld too

The mirror...
UsurÃ©...
The mirror...
UsurÃ©...
The mirror...
UsurÃ©...
The mirror...
UsurÃ©...

This is the mirror
Can you see the reflection?
These four physical levels
Existing in the underworld

Eight are the levels
Each a level is a heaven
Eight are these heavens
Eight are the consciousness

The mirror...
UsurÃ©...
The mirror...
UsurÃ©...
The mirror...
UsurÃ©...
The mirror...
UsurÃ©...

"Relentless winds, waters uncontrollable, DuLu tree of creation, threatens to destroy the UsurÃ©, then SibÃº, give orders to cut it and joins at the ends and ensures the periphery, reinforcing the magical protection to the UsurÃ©, as round as spheres, protection against the ancestral spirits"
