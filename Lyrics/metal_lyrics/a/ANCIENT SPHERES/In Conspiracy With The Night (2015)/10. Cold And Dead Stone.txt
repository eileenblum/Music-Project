[Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano. Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

You areâ¦
So coldâ¦
You areâ¦
So deadâ¦
Cold stoneâ¦
Empty symbolâ¦
Dead stoneâ¦
Hollow lieâ¦

Cold as the winds from the north
In those mysterious days
Dead as those rotten woods
Without a sign of life

An unfeeling look
Full of mystery
Cold and dead stone
Tell me something
You're not real
Give me a sign
I wait for you
You are just nothingâ¦

Only get the lamentsâ¦
The prayers of the weakâ¦
Selfish and petty requestsâ¦
All those hopes and liesâ¦

In the throne of liars
Made based on lies
Last hope of the weak
Stone of innocent ones

Walking on
An absurd ritual
By sacrificing
All their forces
By their faith
Show your truth
You are nothing
Just a cold and dead stone
