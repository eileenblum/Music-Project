[Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano. Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

Old forests
Cold nights
Ancient rituals

From the oblivion
Close to me
Ancient arts

Mystical secrets
Revealed to me
Ancient rituals

Delve in the forest
Follow me
Ancient arts

Amidst the forest
Calling the occult
Ancient rituals

Cold winds
Surrounded by fear
SibÃº is here...

He is hereâ¦
As the coyoteâ¦
Must follow him!
To the riverâ¦

Only you know the secrets of the ancient arts
The ancestral mysterious arts in the cold nights
Ventured in the mighty old forest full of magic
Ancient rituals beyond the comprehension

My domainsâ¦
My ritualsâ¦
My secretsâ¦
My magicâ¦
My forest!
