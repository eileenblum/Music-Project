[Lyrics: Yeudiel ChacÃ³n. Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

Oh you being
Imaginary
You came out
From the fools
Human mind
Ignorance
They are stuck
In the stupidity

Etherealâ¦
Etherealâ¦

Always praying
For not to fall
In disgrace
In the underworld
They are denigrating
Our ancestors
Who fought
In those lands

Cryingâ¦
Confusedâ¦
Terrifiedâ¦

You still
Confused
Without
Comprehension
Searching for
Response
Without
Salvationâ¦
