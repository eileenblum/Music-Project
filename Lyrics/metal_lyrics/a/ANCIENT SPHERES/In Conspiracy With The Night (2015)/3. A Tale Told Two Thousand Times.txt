[Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano. Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

Ancient times but not ancient ages
They have seen many things pass
Old trees still standing witnesses
They have seen and heard many things

Tell me a storyâ¦
Of ancient timesâ¦
So far untoldâ¦
In this winter night!

A tale will vary through the times
Guiding you through inhuman feelings
Walking aimlessly following its hand
Singing dark verses in your earsâ¦

A taleâ¦
A taleâ¦

A tale told...
Two thousand times
A tale told...
Two thousand times

Repeated tales and distorted tales
Altered over the time, again and again
Let me say that is not the same
There is a tale told two thousandâ¦ times!

Singing dark verses to scare you
Countless callings to the ancient spirits
Trying to absorb you and take your mind
And offering a convenient salvation

Tell me a storyâ¦
Of ancient timesâ¦
So far untoldâ¦
In this winter night!
