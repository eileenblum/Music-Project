[Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano. Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

Doomed by my darkest feelings
I am dominated
Seduced by the most pure hate
My ancient spirits!

I can't feel my essence
I feel only hate
Again, itâs is a dark pleasure
I am blinded byâ¦

My ancient spiritsâ¦
Only my hatred deepensâ¦
My ancient spiritsâ¦
Only my hatred deepensâ¦

My ancient spiritsâ¦
Senses become sharperâ¦
My ancient spiritsâ¦
Senses become sharperâ¦

Ancient spirits full of knowledge
Now I am possessed
Ancient spirits inside
Doomed by the ancient one!

Ancient spiritsâ¦
Ancient spiritsâ¦

A spirit has chosen me
A spirit is my guest
My body is stronger
A magical moment

There is no return
This is my desire
Make your will
There is no repentance!

No clemency!
No forgiveness!
No repentance!
No return!

Donât leave me!
