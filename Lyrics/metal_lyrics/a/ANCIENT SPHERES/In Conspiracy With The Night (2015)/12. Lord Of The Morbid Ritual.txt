[Ceremony]

Your destiny in my hands
In desperate cry for mercy
All my soul is being filled
With those bloody rage

Lord of liesâ¦
Try to seeâ¦
Crimes of bloodâ¦
In your sinsâ¦

Lordâ¦
Morbidâ¦
Ritualâ¦

My throne your inspiration
My presence in your fears
Like a rain of fire
In this ancestral ceremony

Lord of liesâ¦
Try to seeâ¦
Crimes of bloodâ¦
In your sinsâ¦

Lordâ¦
Morbidâ¦
Ritualâ¦

The darkness embraces our lands
I swear you will remember this life
When the fallen cry in my throne!

I am the lord of the morbid ritual
My presence will burn your soul
I destroy your eternal reverence!

[Enchantment]

The darkness embraces our land
I swear you will remember this life
When the fallen cry in my throne
