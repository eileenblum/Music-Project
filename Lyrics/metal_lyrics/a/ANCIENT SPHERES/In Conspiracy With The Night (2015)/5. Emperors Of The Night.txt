[Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano. Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

They came into the deep of the night
With their ships into uncertainty sea
Guided by greed and corrupted orders
Under the symbol of the hypocrisyâ¦

They arrived in the middle of the night
Under the symbol and by the symbol
Tales of terror of these sacred lands
Many concerns into their old mindsâ¦

Those ancient tribesâ¦
Tribes to conquerâ¦
Those sacred lands â¦
Lands to devastateâ¦

Past achievements reflect a destination
Destination of devastation
The uncertainty sea has no end
As the silence of the hypocrites

We are the emperors of the nightâ¦
Rulers of the darkest nights!

We are the emperors of the nightâ¦
Rulers of the darkest nights!

Riders of the cold winds
Bringers of the revenge
Shadows in the dark
Masters of the night
Riders of the cold winds
Bringers of the revenge
Shadows in the dark
Masters of the night

The cold winds
Of these winter nights
Embracing trees
And the conquerors bodies

Those symbols lie
On the floor
Trampled by
The emperors of the night!
