[Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano. Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

Under a splendorous full moon
The night is cold as no other
There are no sounds in the darkness
I have no more wood on the fire

How many days have passed?
Since I decided to be here
I am alone with this madness
Just seeing the time pass

Since the last time
How many times?
I can't to remember
That last night

Many times and again
Only my presence
No sounds in this place
In solitude I die

I donât want to remember
How many times persecuted?
How many times confronted?
Here in the dark I belong

The UsurÃ© is in ashes
Dispersed in these lands
In all my sacred lands
Where I have to dieâ¦ again

In solitude...
I die...
One more time...
I die...
In solitude...
I die...
One more time...
I die...

Again...
