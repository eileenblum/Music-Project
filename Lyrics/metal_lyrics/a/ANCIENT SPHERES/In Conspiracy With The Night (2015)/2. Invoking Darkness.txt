[Lyrics: Yeudiel ChacÃ³n. Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

Ancient spirits
Are invoked
In the dark

Cold nights,
Dense forest,
Cries of death

Ancient spirits
Searching for
A new life

Some captures,
Some rituals,
A possession!

Now they
Guide to
A new life

In the dark
Among the
Old forces

We will live
Forever in
This darkness

In the bowels
Of the night
Riding winds

Invoking darknessâ¦
Invoking darknessâ¦

(Voyage into the darkness)

For this night
The ritual
Is gone

There is not
Cries of death
In the dark

Ancient spirits
Are alive
With us

And we shall
Live forever
And everâ¦
