[Lyrics: Yeudiel ChacÃ³n. Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

In a year of a past age
Some innocents survived
There was a terrible crying
Due the light in the sky

Was a signâ¦
In the skyâ¦
Was a signâ¦
In the skyâ¦

Unbeliever make your best bet
You can bet your poor life
Ensured by the grey sages
Our presence is in the stars!

The scale of your poor wit
Will never make you understand
Secrets of the universe
Stored in the ancient minds

In a year of a past age
Some innocents survived
There was a terrible crying
Due the light in the sky!
