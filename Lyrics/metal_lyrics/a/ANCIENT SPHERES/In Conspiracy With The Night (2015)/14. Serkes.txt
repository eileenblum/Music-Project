[Bonus Track][Lyrics: Adolfo Bejarano. Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

In the cold of the dark
In the dark of the night
Iâm the voice in the night
Iâm a presence in the night
Something you cannot deny
Something you wonât to deny
Those spirits in the dark
Ancient spirits in the night

Serkes...
Serkes...
Serkes...
Serkes...

Lashed with strong winds
Slammed with cold winds
Everything is clinging to the earth
Shakes and shudders
Hear the stronger trees
Hear the force in my voice
Now you feel the last day
Now you want the end arrives
Let me feel your deep breath
Let me feel your fear again
Let me feel it more
Let me enjoy your horror
You cannot run
You cannot pray
You are mine
You know who I'm!

I want your fear...
Stay away evil shadow...
I want your fear...
Stay away old shadow...
I want your fear...
Stay away ancient shadow
You cannot run...
Damn ... get away shadow!

Serkes...
Serkes...
Serkes...
Serkes...

Shadows...
Arise...
Shadows...
Arise...
Shadows...
Arise...
Shadows...
Arise...

Donât you hide, I will hunt you
I feel your fear is filling me
Donât you hide, I will hunt you
I need your life; your fear is mineâ¦

I am spirit of the gales
I am the spirit of the hurricane
I am spirit of the gales
I am the spirit of the hurricane

Donât you hide, I will hunt you
I feel your fear is filling me
Donât you hide, I will hunt you
I need your life; your fear is mine...

Lashed with strong winds
Slammed with cold winds
Everything is clinging to the earth
Shakes and shudders
Hear the stronger trees
Hear the force in my voice
Now you feel the last day
Now you want the end arrives
Let me feel your deep breath
Let me feel your fear again
Let me feel it more
Let me enjoy your horror
You cannot run
You cannot pray
You are mine
You know who I'm!

In the cold of the dark
In the dark of the night
Iâm the voice in the night
Iâm a presence in the night

Serkes...
Serkes...
Serkes...
Serkes...
