[Bonus Track][Alternative lyrics: Yeudiel ChacÃ³n / Adolfo Bejarano. Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

From the depths of the underworld
From the gates of the universe
The new order isâ¦ fighting!
No order, God an Evil merge in one tribe
Chaos to follow!

Chaosâ¦
Compassâ¦
Chaosâ¦
Compassâ¦

Ancient warriors that have lost their swords
Beasts of the new order
No reason
No rhyme
Only chaos compass

All of the universe full of hate
Nothing to offer
Nothing to take
Without a chance to saveâ¦
You soul!

Time has gone and everything has finished
No heaven, no underworld
A new world ruled by other worlds
Fight or die!

Chaosâ¦
Compassâ¦

Years are passing by
And the days has become night
Only chaos compass
From my sword
For a new beginning!
