[Lyrics: Yeudiel ChacÃ³n. Music: Adolfo Bejarano]

In one night
And suddenly
Came the chaos
By the trespassers
With their weapons
Bloody slaughters
Everything is consumed
By the destruction

Ancestors and trespassers
Fight to death
Suffering and dying
Without fear in their minds
Warriors of faith against
Warriors of these lands
No one be defeated
With the powers of theâ¦

Darknessâ¦
Darknessâ¦

Lying on the floor
The air is very coldâ¦

Voices from the past
Are coming to meâ¦

Slaughters!

Slaughters!

Great masterâ¦
Of the darkness!

Slaughters!

Slaughters!

Master of Darkness
Bring me the key
Of the ancient arts
Share that power
To the warriors
Of these lands
For the revenge
Of the slaughters!
