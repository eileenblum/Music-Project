From darkest depths
Where time is not
The fear gave birth to first gods
Creatures of corners and crossroads

Alien to all human
The coldness of cosmic winds
Streams from their empty eye halls
When they watch over you

Coming out of corners, of shades
They stay folding hands over you
When youâre sleeping
...drink your blood

The fear of first gods gave birthâ¦
To the shades above me
They circle telling me something
Persecuting me persistently

The fear of first gods gave birth
To the forceless silence
It links me each time

When they stay over meâ¦
Watching with their empty eye halls
Thereâre no stars in this sky

Vae victis!

Thereâre no stars in this sky
Our fear gave birth to Death
Taking us away to darkest depths
Where cold cosmic winds
Start making noise in our eye halls
...to spill
When we come out of shades
To look at ourselves.
