The inflamed consciousness is infected
With stereotypes of humanity
Sincerity makes me run
To hide from the world

It makes me be another one
The glare is turned through prison walls
Despair entices to a dead-end

Wounds from our sins
Will bring the perdition
Before rebirth
âcos even a stone
Can be filled with life

I hear spheres calling me
Flames are swallowing the skies
The global collapse is coming
Fire will cleanse us

Did they know where the pathway goes?
Storm-clouds gather around,
And only darkness is inside!

"Cataclysmus, quod nos diluvium vel irrigationem dicimus,
cum factum est, omne genus humanum interiit praeter..."
Hygini, Fabulae

My screams will shake the arch of Heaven
Poisoned the world with lies
Iâve been waiting for this...
Escape to stars!

The gateways were left behind
I will satisfy my greed
The eternity Iâll find...
I know it will be my last deed!

Iâve heard spheres calling me
Iâve seen the world the last time
I dared to escape
From the prison of life
