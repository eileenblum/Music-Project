[And God said, Let there be lights in the arch of heaven, for a division between the day and the night, and let them be for signs, and for marking the changes of the year, and for days and for years.
Genesis 1:14]

Can you read signs in the night sky?
The way begins with aspiration to justice
And ends with rescue
A great illusion becomes
The reason of recovery of sight

But only the one with strong spirit
Will subordinate vices and weaknesses
A new consent will be attained
A new power will rise

Just the one, who has chosen the right way
Will be faithful to his Aim
Otherwise dignities will become troubles
And the one who obtained more can fall lower

Finding the balance
Youâll clash with the highest trial
The biggest danger catches at that time
Fear will be the main barrier
On the joint of ages

The greatest changes come
The one who hasnât turned off the way
Will be similar to the Sun
Will be able to Create

Only than the reason will be cleared
Neo Aeon. Time Enthroned...
