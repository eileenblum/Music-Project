Youâll be given the new eyes
To see endlessly up and down...
Another pestilence, another war,
Another epidemic...

Wounds will cleanse you
And will raise you above the world
Where embryos cover 
Their faces with hands
Before being ruptured with forceps...

Youâll be given the new eyes to see
Is the light shining in you not dark
On the burnt way
Our unforgivens slay us

Another alchemy, 
Transformation of spirit and soul
New eyes to see above the world 
Of dying children

The way keeps its follower
We are what we strive for
