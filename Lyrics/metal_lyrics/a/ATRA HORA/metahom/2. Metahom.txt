Life ruins being mixed with death
Death remains here, she is walking these places
Each second is eternal in the struggle for life
We die...

After death we go to the place
Where we scout path during the life
Death with no end... eyes like dark lakes
She laughs before dying... everytime
She brings her own fire to the Hell!

Stellar cemeteries without any bounds 
We are an obstacle between ourselves and things we search 
We are the children of the Immensity which is stretched above 
...and a blindman will see those who watch 

A child hidden in a secret cave 
A son of skies with Earth body 
A cheerful one in those who sleep 
In the center of a house 

When a blindman see a sighted one... 
A solar area where everything becomes forever known... 
Some miracles have no soul, some others are bodiless... 
An impotence of gold! 

Thanatos is cutting a strand of hair 
A radiant king, who was hidden from us, 
You are in the sword that strikes you 
And in the hands which embrace!
