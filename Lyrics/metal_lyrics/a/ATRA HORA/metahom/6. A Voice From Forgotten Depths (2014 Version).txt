As deeper you down so less you shine
From the temples and the tombs without exit out
From timeless voids, forgotten towns
Where is no place for the breath of life
Each one who's watching through the eyes of dead can see
The kingdom of moonlight beneath the layer of bones
My death will go through endless centuries
And once we'll hear forgotten void's voice
There won't be boundaries for darkness
When we open the gateways of night
As deeper you down so more the emptiness around
Open the gateways of night
The face with 10000 eyes
Calls me from the depths and I follow
The inner pale sun, the empty life
The empty death and I know
Of the shadows
Everything's made of the shadows
Everyone's made
Who did teach you to hide your preys?
The inner pale sun's slowly dying
Live my life and wear your mask
In the shadow the black star's shining
