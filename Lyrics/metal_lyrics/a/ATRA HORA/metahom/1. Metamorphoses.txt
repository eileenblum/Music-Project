A temple with no god, a body with no soul 
In your desires you lose yourself 
Nobody can take away what we have not 

"There's nothing covered that shall not be revealed
And hid that shall not be known" M 10 26 

Trying to discover the world around you 
You face a contradiction
 The search ends only when you find 
Aesthetics instead of truth 
You're linked in chains of so-called reality 
Ashes are drifting above the dusty labyrinth 

And water will turn into wine 
And a blindman will see 
And ash will turn into soil 
To grow a seed 

Death can't be conquered by death! 

Everyone is free to decide what to bring 
Everything has its causes and consequences 
If we fill it with meaning it makes sense 
The reality is limited with our consciousness!
