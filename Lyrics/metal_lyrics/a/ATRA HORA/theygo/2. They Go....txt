They go, and I hear screams and groans
The wind is crying, I hear
The blood will flow out of the wall
And it will wash me
They've turned to ashes the world
The rotten is spread by the ones
Going unto my call
Unseen in shades, they're raised by the word
They bring the end to the age
Of forceless god
They'll go through time and through space
Destroying the matters
And eye can't see the flame
Burning upon the placeâ¦ They go
Someone is behind the mirror
Just like before
The dust covered my arms
I know I'm dead
The world is full of silence
Storm clouds around
And dark is inside us
They go and shaking the earth
They go and I hear screams and human groans
I hear the wind rushing in despair
The end of days has come
The circle now is closed
In the beginning
There was chaos
