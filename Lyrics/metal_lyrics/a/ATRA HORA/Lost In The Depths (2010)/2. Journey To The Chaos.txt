Stay here scoped by fear
Before the stones of the gates
The eyes will burst
And the guts will fall away
Of the one who will dare to enter here
Infringing the rules and the laws
Stay here scoped by fear
Contemplating for five rings
Around the dawning sun
And the moon is like rotting skin
Stay here scoped by fear
But don't step back
Before the face of your soul's death
Your soul's just a revival
The revival is eternal
Make the altars in the places where the skin of earth is thin
On the edges of swamps and on the tops of cliffs
Lay your gifts upon it and prophesy will come true
And inhabitants of stars will answer you
From nine edges of oblivion
From seven wells of void
Come, oh, lord
ia!
I worship thee
ia!
I serve thee
ia!
I praise thee
The sun will grow dim
And it will fall to pieces
The Ancient fear slept before
Comes to us again
The facelessâ¦ the unseen
