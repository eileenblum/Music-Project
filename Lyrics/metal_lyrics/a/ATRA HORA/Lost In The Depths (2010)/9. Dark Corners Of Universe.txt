I close my eyes and go back to the time
To age of great ancient battles
Where the corpses fell from the sky
Where was war of omnipotent giants
They're still falling down
Their bodies are broken
They are smashing
Their souls are burning
Their terrible faces deep in my mind
I remember their screams
I saw how they've died
But dark transformed them, took off doubts
Wrapped them up in cold shadows
I gave them tongues
Of dirty liars
Hearts of slaves
Souls of betrayers
Their fixed glare
Opens my veins
And drinks my blood
I feel I've changed
I hear the strange call
Whispering in my ears
With rain I've been falling
For thousand of years
I've found my way
The knowledge is inside of me
I'm standing before the closed door
The guardian's giving me the key
I hear everything
I can see through
And world will disappear
When I enter the room
