I'm falling into the sky
Leaving fathomless abyss behind
I'm flying by among the clouds
Recovering the powers I drink blood of stars
The darkness wraps me up
My demons are singing the hymn to me
And warming me with their breath
Not downing to the earth I send death
To the sun and to light
To day and to night
To the moon and to stars
To spirits and to gods
And to you human tribe which respects only its image
Everything dies being once polluted by you
Your stinking blood poisons existence
Your damned seed will be destroyed
Everything will come back to its beginning
From your decease
You carry lies, you hail the weakness
Killed yourself and the universe
Damn you untill the end of the centuries
The hands of those who sleep
Have touched my face
I was a snake, I crawleth through grass
Sometimes I went through it
In the places where I've been
The snow's still falling on
It's cold of my own
