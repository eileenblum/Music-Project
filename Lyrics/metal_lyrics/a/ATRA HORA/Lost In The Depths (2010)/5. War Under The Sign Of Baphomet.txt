I stayed before the thousand of mirrors
And in each one I saw death
There's no more differences between dead and alive
The face of earth is mutilated by wars
The wounds are bursting
The endless agony has become a new form of existence
Dead embryos ripen in the crippled wombs
To go out and to step through the mirrors
Didn't you want it?
Didn't you go to it?
In your rooms without mirrors, windows and doors
It will come one day
When our power rises
When we're able to strike off
The folded mankind
Life begins to disappear
Under the force of nuclear wastes
The sky becomes bloodred
It's the mourning for mankind
Our dark shadows are portending your death
Apocalyptic war
Under the sign of Baphomet
Will accompany new world
Since it's creation's time
And the aeon of oblivion will come
