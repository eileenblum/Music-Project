Forests' blood filled the rivers
The portending of madness soars in the air
It's another age, the age of evilness
It's the end of the era of man
Wind spreads the smell of rotten
Black legions are rising
Blasphemous anger is in their hearts
It's coming of the unholy one
Ancient spirits awake from their sleep
Bringing the world to the abyss
Their domination has no boundaries
There is no way back from thisâ¦
Lay down before your lord
Whose shape is like the fog
Worship the one who speaks
The dialect of the dark world
Honour the ones who brought
The destruction to rule of the dead gods
And total death
To their mindless admirers
