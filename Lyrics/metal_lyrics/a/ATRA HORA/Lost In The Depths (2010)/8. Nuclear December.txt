Blowing over the labyrinths of destroyed cities
The wind of emptiness is covering with snow
The streets, the houses, the buildings
This ruin that were left lying
Like the wounds on the body of dead
Mother earth
Mutilated life forms
Make their way through the snow
Through the lifeless cold of nuclear december
Being the remembrance of pain and rotten of mind
Which humanity could not survive
Eternal turns to dust in distance
Only their fucking graves
Dead bodies are everywhere
And death is dancing her wild dance
Dark grey cloud has covered sky
There's no more light
There's no more life
Nuclear december has come
Nuclear december has come
It has wiped off the life from the face of earth
Nuclear december has become
The remembrance of dead mankind
Dark grey cloud has covered the sky
There's no more light no more life
Nuclear december has taken it away
Nuclear december has come
