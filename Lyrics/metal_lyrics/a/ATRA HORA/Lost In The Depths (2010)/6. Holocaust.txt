Where's no wind blowing at the mountain's top
No sun shining in the morning sky
Another life form will born
Old one will disappear in time
Do you feel the fear of a pitiful prey?
See the agony in its eyes?
Through its pain and death it will pay
The civilization has died
The last scream of a dying man and his abandoned soul
Will split the heaven for pieces
The eyes are openedâ¦ the puppet's strings
Now you can see them
The peace will be created on bones
Cos this world is too odd
Streams of red blood will wash the earth
Everything will be covered by time
