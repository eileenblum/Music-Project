Turning away
From God and people
Not finding yourself...
You love only your reflection

But look at these empty eyes; the one
You see in the mirror is not you
Hard dark nightmares drift above the town
Like the storm clouds ready to spill

Right behind my eyes...
Lies are everywhere
Lies about all-forgiving love

Come to you friend and look at his eyes
Can you atone his sins with your blood?
While you fight each other
Iâll drink the blood of gods

Far... Behind the horizon
Behind the blue sky
Right behind my eyes...
Left towns
Cars becoming coffins
Empty ruins
Unburied bodies
Thatâs all weâll leave
On a way to neo aeon

Look at the sky where the sun and the moon pass their sacred path
Look inside of yourself, where the sun and the moon shine to their liking

Millions of constellations
In you went out
And millions will flare
This is the eternal revival

Do not leave sacred things to dogs;
Do not turn off your way
Dance and youâll slam the mouth of a lion
And do not come upon thee the vengeance of gods
