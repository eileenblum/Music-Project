Blast

A part of my life
We were once out in the streets
And hang out
That is what the kids do
With them guns,that's what the kids do

The collapse of their lifeless hope
Pray with guns in their hands
God bless

They just want to raise their kids to
Misshapen icons
Sons make their daddy proud
Defaced by hollow tips

Five years have now passed my kid
You know what your father's up to
I introduce to you my hottest cat
Take it as it were your own child

Peacemaker
That's what they call him with awe
Be proud
My father's genes will make you proud
