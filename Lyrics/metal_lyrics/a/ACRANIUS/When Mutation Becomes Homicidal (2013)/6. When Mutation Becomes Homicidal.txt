It has to breathe
Work,don't insult

Passion made me murder
Whatsoever

It loves on its own
The work is now done

A glare in eyes unveils many stories
And so are yours

I'm wrecked down
Striked on the ground
I nearly faint
But I don't deserve to get spared

I feel it bleed
I feel it bleed

Now the floor gets covered in my guts
I can't hold them back with my hands

Nature takes back what it belongs
With hate it strikes

It stands proud in front of me
Presenting his love for what we have done
