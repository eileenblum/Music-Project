These aren't my words
Rather words of fate
Announcing to destroy you
Or what's left

As I go on,bereft of my soul
Grappling for the achievements
Of your so called past

In upper class they call me
Your majesty

Loyal,they won't be despised
Majesty

I gather around all my owns and belongings
I gather around all my owns and belongings

I don't caress your 
Lives is what I pile
Need them for every
Crime I have done

Majesty and proud of it
