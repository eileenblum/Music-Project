It cracks

I'm audiophile,but just to one sound
A cracking chest of virgins makes me cum
It's a fetish the most aren't used to
I don't blame anyone who dislikes it,though

Most times,when I got a load left
Hang out in clubs,check what's there
Don't care for tits,neither her ass
Need the chest,that I want to blast
It's all planned,I hate to get interrupted
Drug that bitch till she passes out

Her friends don't mind
I look educated and nice
Seem to be gentle
While I put her into my trunk

The back alley is a safe place
To prepare my equipment
Right before the bitch wakes up
Her ribcage breaks through my love

It makes me cum,the sound raises
Through the streets in bangs
The echo of her cracking chest
