The world has lost its orders
Plague is raging like never before
Unable to stop her
It's all hopeless

Life has become so worthless
She is abominating

And infants fall,one by one
Mothers rest in broken Sights
Fathers left just holding
Their lifeless remains

She is abominating

She taught us everything
Now we are drugdes of her great
Enslavement
Is we live
With my duty we fall,one by one

For her sanctuary
She is abominating

She is the shanty towns hooker
