Banned for names they gave you
And every gesture comes
Like the best duet

Be honest,it's all your fault
Is is the subhuman soul within you
I will take care of you

Let's start with all the dirt
I left in my basement
You better clean the whole spot
Or it will be your tomb too

Since a long time
I create a home
For all the unloved
Who got put off
This is my vocation
I have to protect the
Citizens who got
Annoyed

Hold your breath and accept it
