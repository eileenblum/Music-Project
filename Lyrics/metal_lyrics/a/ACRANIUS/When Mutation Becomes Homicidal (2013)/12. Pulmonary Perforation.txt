I do remember every second
Of our last relationship
The end of abrupt
Not as usual as the classic standards

And no one
With any exception
Is allowed
To touch my cats

But what were you thinking?
It's my love since father's death
He showed me her nicest sides

You love it
Straight into your fucking head

She wants a load like lovers do
Deserves a treat like lovers do

The sound of its blast
Is what will make me cum

This is a story
I keep to myself
I'm honest to myself,not to others
They shall stay on distance
