The firmamentum, malediction of my presence, 
within each star there is a devil 

The firmamentum, malediction of my presence, 
within each star there is a devil, 
When the empty will fill the one, 
god-devils will unite in the flames

The blood will turn black, and the moon will hide 
in the shadowed corner of the universe.

I fall down blind in the blood 
when I will wake up again 
between masses singing feral litanies

I will leave my father, kill my brother, 
and spread his limbs far away rejuvenate,
washing and cleaning my sons 
before sacrifice them to the blade
redeeming my soul.

I commend myself to death, 
instead of a hopeless redemption
