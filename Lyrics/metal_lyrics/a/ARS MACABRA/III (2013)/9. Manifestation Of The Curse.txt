As above I am so below
I am the universe therefore the life force in us,
beautiful flame in a pool of still water.
The ophidian circles leads the way to create my obsession.
I am still I am motionless
I am that I am not [4x]
Climbing the mountain of my dead selves,
look down the empty stairway
Laughter follow me,
I sing the sadness and cynicism,
where is my sword?
Laughter follow me
I shatter my mask of clay, the dog gently protect its bone.
The single grain on the shore moves
toward the manifestation of existence.
The message is from the null, the physical strive
is the end and the beginning
The message is from the null, the physical strive
is the end and the beginning
I am that I am not [4x]
In a pool of still water the ophidian circles leads the way
to create my obsession. I am still I am motionless
I am that I am not [4x]
