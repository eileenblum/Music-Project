Spreading my wings, 
toward zero side where nothingness resides,
ourselfs appear manifesting  the true god form, 
Lucifer resides
Lucifer resides

Khaomeras of the neural pantheon, 
freedom of the mistic fire
Worlds within us, I make you ..Lucifer
you make me, saturnine ruler

Eagle Dragon fly
Eagle Dragon fly 
over outside the 7, toward Apophenia
I can tell you by the planets

The solitary genious that only want the black light of Pan

Eagle Dragon fly
Eagle Dragon fly 
over outside the 7, toward Apophenia
I can tell you by the planets
