We have gods within us , 
we have swords and the thunder of Wotan
the fire of Set and the rage of Ra, 
we have gods within us.

We praise death as we venerate cosmic void
Polymorphous perversion 
arouse from the pantheistic apostates

Prophets, messiah born 
Logo against Mythos serpentine dominion 
arise the damnation through my blood.

Fornicating priests swarming through dark ages
leaving the fifth Aeon, vitriolic hatred
Goat of fire, Kabbhalistic invocation,

Quadrads, serve the Uranian evocation
Banish through my blood.

We praise death as we venerate cosmic void
Polymorphous perversion 
arouse from the pantheistic apostates

Prophets, messiah born 
Logo against Mythos serpentine dominion 
arise the damnation through my blood.
