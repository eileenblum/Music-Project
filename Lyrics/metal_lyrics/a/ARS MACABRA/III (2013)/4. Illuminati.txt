Three muses bring you inspiration
now you can burn the sacred icon
We are the only one arriving from space
Three muses bring you inspiration

The moon in your eyes
Entangled in the limitless darkness,
Isis she can augury from entrails
seeking mysterious connections disorder your crafted expectations.

Blasphemic pentacles in the air, now!
in the air nor!

The moon in your eyes
Entangled in the limitless darkness,
Isis she can augury from entrails
seeking mysterious connections.

Planes and numbers in your hands, can you deny it?
Random illusion entangled imagination, do sex do death.
