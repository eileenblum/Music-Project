Because of you speak in tongues
And feel like mourning
Feel my wrath of my crown
Love my cold blade, on my throne
Because of you speak in tongues
And feel like mourning

Enchant my enemy insanity khaos new reign supreme
Who are in the gathering of the utmost

Ride the tidal wave
Rejecting contrite uniformity
Never exhaust it!

Death pentagram is going to raise
Conjuration of an entropy rite
Create destroy enjoy

Because of you speak in tongues
And feel like mourning
Feel my wrath of my crown
Love my cold blade, on my throne

Because of you speak in tongues
And feel like mourning
