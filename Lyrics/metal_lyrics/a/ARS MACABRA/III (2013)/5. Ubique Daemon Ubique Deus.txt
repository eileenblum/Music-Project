Twisted by talons of gnosis
A void of darkness burns , brooding into my veins
Wild laughter twisting of time and space.

Twisted by talons of gnosis
A void of darkness burns , brooding into my veins
Wild laughter twisting of time and space.

âNothing is true everything is permittedâ
Open wound, self inflicted

Divine scars possession unveiled
I wade on this qlipothic scum

Divine scars possession unveiled
I wade on this qlipothic scum

This is my story no hope no chance of change
Stray through nebular planesacross

The mayhem speaks to me louder than the vision of life.
Seeing the aura casting the circle

âNothing is true everything is permittedâ
Open wound, self inflicted
