I reincarnate the spirit essence of trinity, mystical equilibrium
I move my limbs in the sealing dance I am, I create, I am divine

In the taste of death 
I relish the divine essence from my lips from my oath
I spread the Word, the divine mantra I rule the high spiral

Son of chaos, sperm of light, 
I fecundate the legions  now, on my command
I am the one who asked

Whom you have called I am his voice, his command 
The transcended chaos is in force, my scepter rules,
my will thunders in the manifestâs nature,
my essence his voice, his command

Son of chaos, sperm of light, 
I fecundate the legions  now, on my command
I am the one who asked

Whom you have called I am his voice, his command 
The transcended chaos is in force, my scepter rules,
my will thunders in the manifestâs nature,
my essence his voice, his command

I reincarnate the spirit essence of trinity, mystical equilibrium
I move my limbs
