These are my weapons 
expression of my will stars khaos and thunderbolt

No breath on my lungs 
only visualization of the black light
Geburah!

Is my will to invoke Seraphim preparing the battle
He stands in a chariot chains and shields, 
cleansing decay and stagnation from the universe

Vortex of end the blood will fill forever
fiery serpents kneeling to me

Damned on fire voices curling the void
Storm-god of chaosphere.

Movement of the Universe 
is the Fullfillment of thine Energy
Banish with laughters, Banish with laughters!!
