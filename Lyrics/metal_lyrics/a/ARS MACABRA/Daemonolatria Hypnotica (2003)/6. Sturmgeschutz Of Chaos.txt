I am the panzersmasher of your spirit
I do my blasphemies and truth inherit.
I come from a world of dread and utter darkness,
Abhorrent distortions bred from disasters.

Atomic holocaust, battlefield whores
Spawning Armageddon and inflicting sores.
Humanity in chaos and blessed with madness,
Dominions of the worst immorality through ages I master!

Screaming for pain, atrocities and tortures
I slain the creed's meat, I am your
demonic vultures.
Blackening the purity of light to fuck the human race.
We exterminate the life of all wicked ones,
To bring the word of fire on this world shames.

A mist coming from my tomb. I call...endless lust
Of blood purifies my soul.
I am the wanderer, the malignant blasphemer,
Creation bathed in blood to celebrate your total decadence.

Screaming for pain, atrocities and tortures
I slain the creed's meat, I am your
demonic vultures.
Blackening the purity of light to fuck the human race.
Deliriums of war will be my only joy
To feed myself off dead on this
Dying soil.
