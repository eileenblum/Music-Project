A dream so intense.
Parallel existence
To his persistence
There's no resistance.

There's no resistance
To his persistence
Paranoid existence.
A dream so intense.

I see a new clear world
After a nuclear war.
There was a nuclear world
Before a new clear world.

Nihil tam praepostere
Tam incondite, tam mostruose
Cogitari potest
Quod non possimus somniare

UmanitÃ  microbiologica
DivinitÃ  d'immane statura
(...RealtÃ  entropica...)
UmanitÃ  macrobiologica
DivinitÃ  d'umana statura:
RealtÃ  entropica ciclica.

Every kind of perverse
Future possibilities.
Cross the door of my self
As I turn my psy-key.
A delirious nonsense
Of catastrophic reveries
In spiral form multiverse
Descends my insanity.

In my soul no law no fate.
In my soul half Pope half mad.
In my soul no gold no lead.
In my soul as love as hate.
