Here I am...
For many a prisoner of my steel rage
For me as free as a man can't be.
For them a desperate, visionary cripple
For me a champion of evil and hate.
Dead to this world
Reborn to my own.
I savour my tasteful revenge.
Your pity I don't need
Since humanity I lost
Yet farther my eyes now can see.

Bellator in aeternum ero, machinae bellator.

Imprisoned in my new metal world
Still boundless and almighty I feel.
Into a (h)armless human trunk I was turned.
As disgusting as it may appear
All this steel architecture can think.
For them a pitiful tank-like still-life
For me finally one with the machine.

I'll roar my hate
My "here I am"
To you conceited animals.
Once I approached my last page
And tasted my "The end"
But some perverted bastard
Judged the game too fun to stop.
Now I'm back as a machina
And as such I declare war on mankind.

Imprisoned in my new metal world
Still boundless and almighty I feel.
I didn't choose this dimension (this permanent prosthesis).
As disgusting as it may appear
All this steel architecture can think.
For them a pitiful tank-like still-life
For me finally one with the machine.

Forever damned who first created me.
Twice as damned who reassembled me to life!
