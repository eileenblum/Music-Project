I've been taught, I've seen the plague
mastering prophecy and fulfilling destiny.

Ascending to unknown fields of eternal cursed suffering
We are indeed the few armed with
the source of sin
blessed by cold and wind.

Can you all ever comprehend
The teaching from a dark land?
Those cursed words infested us from within.
Lies and thorns....we spread as seeds!

Indomitable blasphemers from shattered graves
Ancestors of a fallen crusade.
As ghosts through the world, contradiction of life
Virtue of torment grown from pain and demise.
I hear the wizard call as the storm brings the words upon bewildered
Masses from the pestilential coil.

Will you ever understand
The power of blood flowing through my hands?
Holy words shall declare your defeat.
Lies and thorns to spread as seeds!
Preachers...ever waiting for the grace
Yet the wind is announcing our swearing names.
The irresistible fascination of pain
Drawn towards insanity lands once again.

Teaching revealed to blackened souls
We lay the oath for those who are bounded in thorns.
Far away, from a non-existing fate
We summon the gods of ignorance and hate.
