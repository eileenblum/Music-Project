By fire and sword did the divided legions of Anu wage war
And the might of Enki's serpent prevailed
A golden age came forth
And the dragon rose to the seventh heaven

Aeons had passed when the angelic legions of Elohim
Allied with draconian and cetacean parasites
Once again from heaven to earth came
To attack our kingdom with fire
Their numbers forced us to retreat to the Duat
In the far reaches of the black void
Our books were buried in the Far East
