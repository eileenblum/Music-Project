The angelic legions of the Elohim reviled the bloodline of Adapa
And decreed that they remain servile before them
And not partake the fruits of the tree of life or knowledge, lest they become alike and be free of their tyranny
And be reduced to ash after bearing the yoke

But the Brotherhood of the Snake stood at the side of man
Unto humanity Enki bestowed seven towers of light, a magic stone
And a great serpent of fire
And I, Samyaza, taught man the art of sorcery
So was Enki's covenant given to his creation
And so began the âwar in heavenâ
