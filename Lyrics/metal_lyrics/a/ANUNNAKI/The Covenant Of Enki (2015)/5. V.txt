Mirroring Enki's creation â the draconians of YHWH conjoined their blood to flesh
And summoned a vile abomination into existence
And the Elohim sealed the serpent in the underworld
Their servants defiled the image of Ananta

And desecrated the scriptures of the gods
To blot out the past
To bring forth strong delusion, that humans might believe a lie
That they might all be damned
And thee became as fallen angels

The sign of the water bearer shall be the harbinger of the time
When the temple of death is destroyed
The temple of the soul rebuilt
The watchtowers opened, the serpent's seal broken
And YHWH's servants, iniquitous upon their stolen throne doth sink
Fire shall rain down upon them and they shall reap as they have sewn
And a new age shall be brought forth under the glow of a black sun
