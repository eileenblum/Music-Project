I, Samyaza, speak to mortal man of the Nephilim's creation
Those blood bound to the heathen gods,
Whose ascension wrought a war in heaven
Listen as I tell thee the story of an infamous rebellion
Of anathema cast among the ranks of Anu
Aeons ago, the Anunnaki and Igigi descended from heaven to earth
To extend their dominion behind the realm of the hunter
When the lots were cast, Anu ruled the sky, Enlil ruled all that flies, And Enki ruled the Absu

âGrandiloquent lord of heaven and earth, Father Enki,
engendered by a bull, begotten by a wild bull,
Great dragon who stands in Eridug,
Your great house is founded in the Abzu, the great mooring-post of heaven and earth. â
[Enki and the World Order]
