Enlil assigned dingirs their mission
The weight too great, they revolted against the most high
âWhen the gods like men
Bore the work and suffered the toll
The toil of the gods was great,
The work was heavy, the distress was muchâ.
[Enuma Elish]

Nammu fashioned A Wise Birthgiver from blood and clay,
And Enki created four substances, four times, and four corners
To creature give life, to create a primitive worker
The mark of our essence would define him
That he may bear the yoke assigned

âYou have slaughtered a god together
With his personality
I have removed your heavy work
I have imposed your toil on man.
â¦
In the clay god and Man
Shall be bound,
To a unity brought together;
So that to the end of days
The Flesh and the Soul
Which in a god have ripened â
That soul in a blood-kinship be bound.â
[Enuma Elish]
