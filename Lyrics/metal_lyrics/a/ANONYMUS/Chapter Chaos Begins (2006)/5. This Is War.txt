[Lyrics: Oscar &amp; Daniel Souto]

Bombs are being dropped
People drowning in a pool of blood
For greed and power
The world is set on fire
Ruled by a bunch of pitiful liars
While they're watching from
Their ivory towers
We die

Under attack
This is the end
Once again
We'll never learn
Terror is back
History repeats itself
This is war
This is hell
This is pain
We all shall pay

Pay false innocence
Taking lives without any sense
Illusive freedom
The evil never sleeps
Taking advantage of the weak
Still we let the fools decide
For us

Hopes to see you down
Lock you up, demented crowns
The rise and fall
The end of all
No freedom in sight
We all will die
