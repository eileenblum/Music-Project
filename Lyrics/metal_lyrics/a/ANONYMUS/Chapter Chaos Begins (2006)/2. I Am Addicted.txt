[Lyrics: Oscar Souto]

Always more and more
The war is going on
No one will stop it
I can't control it
Dig the hole myself
While pain crawls through my neck
I am no exception
Contamination
A shadow on my back

Hostage forever to be found
Searching many ways to put me down
Half of me is very sane
The other one has just gone insane

So hard to resist
Can't get over this
I'm just another victim
I'll cease to exist
And still I insist
No matter what
No matter when
I know how this is going to end
I Am Addicted

System overload
Behaviour uncontrolled
I'm getting weak
Tied with a leash
Becoming someone else
Refusing any help
Blood turns to hate
All through my veins
A shadow on my back
