[Lyrics: Oscar Souto]

Creation of new needs
Bite the hand that feeds
Losing all the will
Technology...

Kills
Everything we are
Everyone you know
Everywhere it goes
Kills
Everything we hate
Everyone you love
Everywhere it show
Situation is so critical
Action taken so minimal

Lying that we're dying
From the wounds we're hiding
Kill... Technology Kills
Without a trace
Kill... Technology Kills
Our race
Kill... Technology Kills
Such a disgrace
Victimized, Computerized
Falsified, hypnotized
Paralyzed, Dehumanized

We're our own enemies
Still we beg on our knees
Mercy... Please
Technology...

Kills
Everything we see
Everyone you care
Everywhere it hides
Kills
Everything we fear
Everyone you lied
Everywhere it kills
Our conclusion is not
Optional
No solution, dysfunctional

Kills
Who we are
What we know
Where it goes
Kills
What we hate
Who we love
Where it shows
Kills
What we see
Who we care
Where it hides
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill
Kill
