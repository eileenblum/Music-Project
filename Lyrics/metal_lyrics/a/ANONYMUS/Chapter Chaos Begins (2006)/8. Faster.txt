[Lyrics: Oscar Souto]

We live in a time
We're nothing last
Always looking
Something new
Always searching
Something true
Obsession brings
Frustration
We're never gonna make it
Possession of the last version
Our salvation

Faster
Everything has to be faster
Everything's done
Faster
Everything has to be
Better than the day before

They're taking control
You just pay the toll
Update warning
One more time
One way ticket to paradise?
Obsession brings
Frustration
We're never gonna make it
Possession of
The last version
Our salvation

Competition has no end
Not now
The only thing that counts is performance
Stand tall, alone in the field
Power, Control
A scene so obscene
Do as you please
Take what you need
Empty our pockets for your own greed
