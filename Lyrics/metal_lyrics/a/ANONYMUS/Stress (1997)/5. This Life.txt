[Parole - Marco Calliari]

A choice is made and it ain't no game
One life to gaze in this world we praise
Choose to make a new life you say
Make it, breed it, teach it and believe in it

A situation so fragile
It needs to be well thought out
Well what do you know?
You gave this life...

Everything you had to give
You gave it with your own heart
You gave this world a new born life
Raise it, free it, see it and love it

A situation so fragile
It needs to be well thought out
Well what do you know?
You gave this life... everything...
oh yes you did!

Is this it? Is this the key of life?
The only way to beIs this it?
Is this the key of life?
The only way

The choice was right without a doubt
The life you made has made you strong
It made you see, it made you feel
All the love you had inside

A situation so fragileIt needs to be well thought out
Well what do you know?
You gave this life... everything
