[Parole - Oscar Souto]

Too scared to know, what the truth is
Ignorance is growing, anxiety is exploding
Questions and questions, frightening answers
Contamination of an uncertain future

Both of us are to blame
We were two in this game
There's no way we're gonna choose
This is it... win or lose

My mind is in decay, my soul in disarray
Should I cry? Deserving to die?
Unconscious murder, brings no more reactions
Reckless situation, provokes the slaughter

Both of us are to blame
We were two in this game
There's no way we're gonna choose
This is it... win or lose
I don't want to be a killer
Even though I am a sinner
Stop me before I do it again

Voices in my head
Screams from the dead
Is there any chance
To see light at the tunnel's end
Step by step to the unknown

Both of us are to blame
We were two in this game
There's no way we're gonna choose
This is it... win or lose
I don't want to be a killer
Even though I am a sinner
Stop me before I do it again

Voices in my head
Screams from the dead
Is there any chance
To see light at the tunnel's end
Step by step to the unknown
