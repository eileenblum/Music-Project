[Parole: Marco Calliari]

Open the book of rules
That's if therre's one to find
Follow the path that's traced
And don't you look behing

Can't take this
Won't take that
Don't you point at me or trry to make me be
Somekind of puppet I should not be
And I'll ask you

Why ? Not Why ? Not why ? Not
Why be the judge of thisWhy ? Not Why ? Not why ? Not
Why be the judge of that

Too many minds to feed
So little time to think
You like to cheat your way
Without even a blink

Can't take this
Won't take that
Don't you point at me or trry to make me be
Somekind of puppet I should not be
And I'll ask you

Why ? Not Why ? Not why ? Not
Why be the judge of thisWhy ? Not Why ? Not why ? Not
Why be the judge of that

Got nothing better to do
Ain't nothing you can say
Nothing to lose
It's my life so judge me not
