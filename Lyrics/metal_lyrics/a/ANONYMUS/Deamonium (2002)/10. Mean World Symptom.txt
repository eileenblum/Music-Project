[Parole: Oscar Souto]

Life ends now, the number on our back
Fall down, the rising of the dark
We have a target on our head
Found dead, no nothing, no regrets

This is it
We have reached the point of no return
Mean world symtom

All hope's gone, a thing we can't deny
Is lost, the meaaning of our life
Through time, a gentle lullaby
Fake things, no future, no respect

This is it
We have reached the point of no return
Mean world symtom

Stop now
We have to keep the circle intact
We have to be prepared for impact
Improved version of ourselves ??
In this mad world in terminal
Every day is so critical
We are getting infest
We are faiting the test
