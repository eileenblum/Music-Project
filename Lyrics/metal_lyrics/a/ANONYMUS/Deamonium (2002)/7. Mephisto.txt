[Parole Oscar Souto]

I'm all alone wondering why
Should I go on... go on with this life
Incomplete, completely,deplete
I have no fear, It's all so dear
Stopped...by laughters and singing of joy
Decisionn within iis destroyed

Mephisto
By my side, a dark ride
Alone in the deeps of the night
Mephisto
Beholdd him noww as his laughters echoes

Satan hear me calling
Hell is on... is on the risen
Be my guide eye for an eye
Aa game to play, lost anyway
Damn...the price to pay is my soul
For a youth I can control

Mephisto
By my side, a dark ride
Alone in the deeps of the night
Mephisto
Beholdd him noww as his laughters echoes back

Fill all my illusions
Break my hesitations
Showing all the beauty
That your world is differing me
I'll sign your deal with hell
On me you cast a spell
Giving me the chance
To live free, youg &amp; to fall in love again
