[Parole : Oscar Souto &amp; Marco Calliari]

There's nothing, not a thing to be
No one around, no sound surround
Then !!! Rigth in my face, before my eyes
Blinding me, wicked wheels

Scenes from a vision already seen
Memories are pushing, out of my dream
When you don't know what the verdict's gonna be
Well no, take me out let me be

Get out the way, Get out the way
Mindless is my head, can't seem to think
Nothing behindd me, just foward in a straight line
No one, nothing in sight
Doing other things might not be the right time

In your face... I'll be, In your face.... I'll be
In your face... I'll be, In your face.... I'll be

Face the fact there's no turning back
Can't get out of track, feeling this attack
Wake up, wake up now, stop draining all my life

Face the fact, there's no turning back
Can't get out of track, feeling this attack
Wake up, , Wake up now, we might not make it back

In your face... I'll be, In your face.... I'll be in your face

There's something, running over me
It's all around, the sound surround
Bang !!! Rigth in my face, before my eyes
Killing me, wicked wheels

In your face... I'll be, In your face....
I'll be in your face
