[Parole Oscar Souto]

Lost all control
Dive in this hole
Gyes opened wide
This is so real
Sole survivor your liffe is burning laster
Weakness crawls into you deeper

Caught in a trap
Out of attack
Think for yourself
Becomingg someone else
Perfection should be your ennemy
Determination... obsessive injury

Same, it's always the same
Decay, day after day
Figth on, gotta get some power
Dream on, everything seem doser
The futher you go
The longer you burn

Think...harder than it seems
Witness that you have no more dreams
Starvation...your soul is running dry
Assassination...wondering what's your crime

Same, it's always the same
Decay, day after day
Figth on, gotta get some power
Dream on, everything seem doser
The futher you go
The longer you burn

Burn...Burning the candle both ends
Burn...Burn...Burning the candle both ends
