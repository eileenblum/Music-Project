[Parole - Oscar Souto]

Invisible man, invisible man
Invisible man deat man ... dying !!!

Let me be the martyr of this ceremony
Injected fear, infest tour reality
Crushing your stability to the ground
I am, I am everywhere... I'm all around

Just another victim, no warning ever given
Disciple under command, fight as an invisible ...

Man from impure civilization
building up a war to stop us from salvation
Watching your security tumbling down
I am, I am everywhere ... I'm all around

Just another victim, no warning ever given
Disciple under command, fight as an invisible ...

The sign shined so bright
That I since blindly follow
My hands to the sky
I'm the closen one to beat him hollow
I am contagious, you're not my friend
Pleading guilty for a crime against humanity
You shall diie !!!

Can you feel the rope... the rope around your neck
Ready to do anything... kill... kill to protect
Crushing your stability to the ground
I am, I am everywhere... without a sound

Just another victim, no warning ever given
Disciple under command, fight as an invisible ...

Invisible mans, Invisible mans,
Invisible mans... dying for a god !!!
