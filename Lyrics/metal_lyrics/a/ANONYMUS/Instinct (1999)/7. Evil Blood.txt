[Parole - Marco Calliari]

Blood will follow blood!!!

A natural excitement
For some of us will provoke
A thirstiness inside us
Is awakened at it's sight
From the mystery and feel for the bite then...

Blood will follow blood
Death will do us part
Life will never die
Time can never end

Mortal lives will be damned
All our sins will be denied
Take our pleasure
Take our pain
Immortal sins can be used
To make us live through the night then...

Blood will follow blood
Death will do us part
Life will never die
Time can never end
Evil blood... will rise

Dracul! you've starded it all with your mythical
Obession for blood and terror
You've terrorized enough souls for a lifetime
Of hellraising pain, will it ever end ?
Will they ever learn that blood will follow vlad!!!
