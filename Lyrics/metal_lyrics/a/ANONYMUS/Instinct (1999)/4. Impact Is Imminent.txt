[Parole - Daniel Souto]

You're the snake who's tempting me
You're the lock throw away the key
I'm the fool I assume but i quit despite the promises
Cause we are who we are

Nobody's gonna change us a part of us that atays intact
Nobody's gonna fake us for a greater impact

You're the devil in disguise think you're perfect so wise
I'm the tool of your plan but i quit despite tje promises
Cause we are who are

Nobody's gonna change us a part of us that atays intact
Nobody's gonna fake us for a greater impact ... is imminent

Stronger now
Just let me be just let me be
Show you how
Just wait and see just wait and see
We are who we are
