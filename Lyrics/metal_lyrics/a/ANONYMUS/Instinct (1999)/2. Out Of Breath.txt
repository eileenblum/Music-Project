[Parole - Oscar Souto]

I never stop always on the go
Doing your job is why i waste my time for
Being fed up you've become a vicious foe
Can't you see t hat ...

I'm exhausted
I'm out of breath
I keep on cause i always try to do my best
I'm exhausted
I'm out of breath
Don't push i'm falling in excess

You always hide never on the run
Forever behind is your main position
Waiting in line
For something to be done
Can't you see that ..

I'm exhausted
I'm out of breath
I keep on cause i always try to do my best
I'm exhausted
I'm out of breath
Don't push i'm falling in excess

Want to do something
Find a way
Don't wanna do anything
Nothing more

I'm exhausted
I'm out of breath
I keep on cause i always try to do my best
I'm exhausted
I'm out of breath
Don't push i'm falling in excess

Out of breath out of breath !!!
