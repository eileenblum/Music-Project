[Parole - Daniel Souto Marco Calliari]

No you're gonna take me No you're not gonna tame me
Cause everytime i try to look deep into your eyes
You blink and run away without a whisper
Still obsessed with all this excess
Heading to happiness without success

Take me for granted I'll use you to the core
Take me for a fool I'll abuse youy to the core

My life has been broken my dreams have been stolen
Cause everytime i seem to have the energy to fight
You loose again without a battle
Still obsessed with all this excess
Heading to happiness without success

Keep the fire burning, Feed the dragon within

You feed my anger that tears me up inside
It's my obsession thar eat's me to the bone
Take me for granted, i'll use you to the core
