[Parole - Oscar Souto]

Far beyond the limits challenge the time
Numbered and living through statistics
Divine creation re-born generation
The new millenium will bring a different race

Another pawn in the game
Plugged into to see to feel to be
A new anomaly our history is the same

Waste away
By this hi-tech resurrestion
Lead the away
We're living constant modifications

On and on to progress reaching new heights
The completion is now in process
Our own creation recerse situation
The new millenium will bring a different race

Another pawn in the game
Plugged into to see to feel to be
A new anomaly our history is the same

Waste away
By hi-tech ressurrection
Lead the way
We're living constant modern modifications

Victims once again
Of our intelligence
Foolish to believe
That we are getting better
