[Parole - Oscar Souto]

I can see forever forever in my brain
Images and words that caused so much pain
I just wanna know I just wanna go
Wherever this may take me
Break the bounds that holds me

I'm virtually insane
Every day in every way
More the same
I'm going insane
Every day in every way
I play the game

I can see the whole world
Through a new perspective
Eyes of another
Becoming so addicted
I just a little more
Fulfill the need
That haunts me
I am gettinf bored

I'm virtually insane
Every day in every way
More the same
I'm going insane
Every day in every way
I play the game

Look...Look...Look how he suffers
Need...Heal... Feed my hunger
The urge is stronger
I'm feeling weaker
Total disorder

Watching from a safe place on the other side
Through the wavy waves witness of a crime
Control my own potential try to fix the mental
Take me to the scene open the machine
Took to much for granted we should be ashamed
But on the other hand tell me who's to blame?
