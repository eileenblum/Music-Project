[Parole - Marco Calliari]

A game of passion with a little twist
For all the glory of a brave new world

What started out a simple game
Appears to have broken into shame
Fanatically proven to be insane
Is no excuse to create ...
... create some pain

Sport of madness adrenaline rush
For a major victory is worth the shot

What started out a simple game
Appears to have broken into shame
Fanatically proven to be insane
Is no excuse to reach ...
... reach a goal
Goal!!! Goal!!!
