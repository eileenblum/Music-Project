[Parole - Oscar Souto]

The other me the me in you
Same or different shame on you
Double part double mind double vision out of sight

This is what you've become
I am winning again
Don't feel sorry i don't repent
Your time came to an end

Who am i ? Be the other
Fight... strike... die... beat the other

Saw you from the corner of my eye
Did I give you a piece of my mind ?
Copy this copy that you're just an opposite
Personality split

This is what you've become
You are struggling again
Feelling weaker day by day
My reign as I say

Who am i ? Be the other
Fight... strike... die... beat the other

Things don't seem to be as bad as I exepted
This is giving me a lot of self-respect

One for all but I walk alone
I'll make you crawl under the stone
Don't know why we're living this lie hatred inside

This is what we've become
We are fighting again
Growing stronger rigth in my face
Learning more from my mistakes

Who am i ? Be the other
Fight... strike... die... beat the other
