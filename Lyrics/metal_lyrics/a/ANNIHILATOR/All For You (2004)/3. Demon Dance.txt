I've had it with confession, I've had it with the priest
I'm tired of all the doctor's and I want to be deceased
I can't control the madness and I don't wanna face the day
No artificial numbness, the pain is here to stay

Can you understand what it is like to be me
Climb the highest mountain and then sink in the sea
Won't you come and take a look, I give you the chance
Wrap your arms around me and we'll do the demon dance

A steady black, it multiplies, attacking sanity
A psychological battering, a relentless enemy
Things are getting brighter and the color's turning red
I'm swallowing this nightmare, the demon shall be fed

I can't hold on much longer
There must be another way
Give me something stronger
Or take my breath away

A deep depressive episode, you know not when it strikes
Is this the one to be all, end all, is the end of the fight
