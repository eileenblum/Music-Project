Stop your screaming, get out of my way
Your lips are moving they got nothing to say
Always steaming but you're cold to the bone
So negative, just leave me alone

No more crying, no more dying
No more bleeding me
No more screaming, no deceiving
No more bleeding me

You smell the bleeding, moving in for the kill
The way you treat me, you make me ill
Push me to the maximum, do it again and again
But I won't let you suck me in
Look at your mother, your father too
Same damn same shit that you put me through
But I'm stronger and I got the balls
I ain't sticking around for it all

Something's coming over me tonight
It's time to take this wrong and make it right
No time to lose before I die
This is my very last good bye

You say you loved me, you say that you cared
But what you need is a billionaire
You sat on your ass and now you wonder why
You need some money but you bled me dry
