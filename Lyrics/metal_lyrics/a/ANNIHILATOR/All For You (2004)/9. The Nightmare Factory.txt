I am drifting off to somewhere
Anywhere sounds good to me
But as I fade into darkness
Something's happening to me
Slipping, failing, demon's calling
Spiders crawling, dogs are mauling
Walls are closing, tumor growing
Reaper's sewing, blood is flowing
Wake up screaming
As I lay my head back down
Soaked and shaking, trembling
Please just let me slip into a
Good night's rest
Vision failing, broken railing
Tumbling off the wall you're scaling
Skin is peeling, body stealing
Total loss of any feeling

Guilty pleasure, daedly weather
Terrified to be together
Snakes are hissing, kid went missing
Crying out but no one's listening
