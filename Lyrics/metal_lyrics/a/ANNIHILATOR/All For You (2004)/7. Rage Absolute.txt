I'm felling anger, I feel rage
You see it coming from a mile away
Built up inside, I lose control
My blood boils, I can't take it anymore
Do what I want, do what I say
It's you that makes me act this way
You are my reason to un load
And I am ready to explode

Someone tell me why I'm feeling
Like I want to give a beating
Rage absolute I got rage

This fury, it starts to biuld
An eruption set to blow
The explosion and the aftermath
Never happened, you know
So irritating and so frustrating
I hate everything that you do
But you can't leave me, you can't deceive me
Or I'll run you

It's in my blood, is what you say, they're all like me
Perfectly acceptable to rage in the family

You keep my secret, until you die
They won't believe you, I will deny
So run away and tell someone
Cause I will finish you and you'll be done
You made me do it, you brought me to it
That's all I have to say
Forget about it, it's all your fault
And wipe those tears away
