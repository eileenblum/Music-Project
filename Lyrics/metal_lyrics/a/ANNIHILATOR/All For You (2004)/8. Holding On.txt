It's getting harder to make it on my own
This empty felling, I feel so all alone
But from the darkness, the reason I am here
You try to help me wipe away a tear
And you ask me why I'm crying, you ask me why I'm sad
So I tell you that there's nothing wrong, don't need to understand
I'm holding on for you

I'm really sorry for what you've been put through
I try the best I can, it's all that I can do
But I know you must be frightened, I know you must be scared
But I promise to protect you, I promise to be there

It's getting harder to make it on my own
This empty feeling can feel so all alone
But I know things will get better and I know they'll be alright
And as long as we're together, I know we'll be alright
