I'm drifting off into nothingness,
So terrified of what will be
Tomorrow is the day, I can't back out
But I'm scared of what will happen to me
They say a simple procedure
It's supposed to be all so routine
But what if the doctor was evil and very, very mean

Just call me doctor, just call me pain
I'll show you horror that you've never gonna see again
Pass me the scalpel, pass me the knife
You don't need no medicine cause I'm gonna take your life

Please wake me out of this nightmare,
I've got to get out of this dream
A victim of the Dr. Psycho,
Like nothing that you've ever seen

As I begin to cut you, screaming out in fear
There's no one to help you, no one's gonna hear
This ancient operation, extracting part of the brain
There's no way to turn it back
You're never gonna be the same

Thought I'd be in a cosmetic bliss
Now I smell the stench of my own piss
All I wanted was to look real good
Just one more chance, I'll leave it like I should

I am the doctor and I'll kill your pain
This is my specialty, extracting part of the brain
