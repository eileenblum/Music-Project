[music Waters/ lyrics Waters]

tossin, turning in the darkness
you try so hard to get to sleep
your mind is racing, seems so hard to tell
is this the end or is this hell

torture in the head, going round and round
spinning in the brain as you hit the ground
you got a fever but it feels like a freeze
i'll bring down, down to your knees
a full blown insomniac
you're getting ready for the next attack
so go on and try to rest your head
but you just can't, just can't can't get to bed

say goodbye and try to slip away
you close your eyes but suddenly you wake
