[music and lyrics Waters]

war, welcome to
war, the garden of
war, can you smell
war, can you taste
hate, no release from
hate, psychological
hate, can you tolerate
hate

look at the devastation,
fear of annihilation happening right before
my eyes
now that the end is near,
tell me what i'm doing here,
looking for answers from the divine

flesh, welcome to
flesh, the garden of
flesh, can you smell
flesh, can you taste
blood, welcome to
blood, the garden of
blood, can you taste
blood

i don't want to kill anymore, i won't kill

the sky above is raining red from a
hundred thousand dead
but the general wants a hundred thousand
more
move out and take that hill, the order is to
maim and kill
it's time for us to even up the score

as i race into the fire, i have only one
desire
let me see the light, another day
bombs bursting all around, shell-shocked
as i hit the ground
i struggle to my knees and start to pray

can't tell if my brother's breathing, and i
just can't stop the bleeding

i am my mothers' only son

torture, welcome to the
torture, the garden of
torture, can you smell
torture, can you taste
pain, no release from
pain, psychological
pain, can you tolerate
pain
