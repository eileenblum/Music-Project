[music and lyrics Waters]

silent, waiting for the kill,
stalking, prey on weak and ill
smell the fear in the air
ending life without a care

i see you, i hear you, i will not stop, i need you
i will attack and take you down
i am the one who makes your flesh creep
and then i'll drink your blood
i am the hunter killer

got the victim now in sight
taken down without a fight
tightening the bloody screw
there is nothing you can do

die out, submission is the rule
you cry out, but your time is through

die out, i'm gonna hunt you down
you cry out, hunt, hunt, hunt you down
