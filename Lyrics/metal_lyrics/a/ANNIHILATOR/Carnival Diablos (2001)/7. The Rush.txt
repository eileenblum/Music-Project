[music Waters - lyrics Waters/Comeau]

take me, take me to the top of the world
please me, got to pick me up, i'm miserable
feeling, like nothing ever felt before
dealing, it's got me coming back for more

can't stop, you can't stop the rush
spreading out and taking all control
one taste and your'll need it
once in, you never leave it
so don't try to stop the rush

slow kill, i know i'll never be the same
evil, the torture, gonna drive me insane
feeding, the ritual begins again
breathing, overload of adrenaline
