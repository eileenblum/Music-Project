[music Waters - lyrics Waters/Comeau]

condition critical
condition grave
target invincible
target insane
built to terminate
built to kill
to crush its' victims
destroy at will

a plague of agony
of sacrifice
bodies, they multiply
deadly device
creation, time bomb
creation red
un-holy overkill
one billion dead

die screaming, bleeding, pleading
