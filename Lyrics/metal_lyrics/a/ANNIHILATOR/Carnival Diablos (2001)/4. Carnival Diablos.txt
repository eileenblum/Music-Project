[music Waters/lyrics Comeau]

the devil has a play ground, nothing you can see
wickedness disguised for you and me
darkness rules the day, the circus comes to town
slowly riding in, come to take us down

carnival diablos

a fire in the field, smoking out the sun
minions throw their chains on everyone
caught in by the crossfire, sky is turning red
adding up his souls as we count our dead

creeping, sneaking, he tries to deceive
fighting off the devil, got a hold on me
he won't let me leave

freaks, thieves and jesters, they all know your name
calling out for you to play their game
caught in by the crossfire, sky is bloody red
adding up his souls as we count our dead
