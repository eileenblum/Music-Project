[music and lyrics Waters]

creeping through the system
spreading like a disease
a cancer-like affliction
to bring us down to our knees

created for the masses
systematic crash and burn
to pillage and to plunder
this cyber-hungry world

circulate, devastate,
re-create the perfect virus

entering the main-frame
like a rogue, killing, hunting machine
weaving its' web of destruction
like nothing before ever seen

artificial intelligence
wiping it all as it learns
crucial data corruption
the chips are down and they burn

i will deploy and terminate
i will expand and annihilate
you will scramble to vaccinate
you will find out that it's too late

picking up the pieces
in the aftermath of the war
a technological genocide
the likes never seen before

seeking restitution
as the world comes crashing down
the creator of this trojan horse
has vanished, never found
