[music Waters/lyrics Comeau]

welcome to darkness the future is here
destruction and pain are my friends
explosions and fires that rip through the night
surrounded by bodies of death

burning, crying, helpless
burning, dying, in the dark
burning, crying, helpless

fire in the sky
watching and praying and waiting to die
fire in the sky
no hope for tommorow, denied

smoldering ashes and flames rise again
nothing to breathe from this life
flesh is beginning to pour in the streets
death is my saviour tonight

final solution of means to and end
a product of science and man
no way to take back, just what have we done
fire in the sky rules the land
