[music Waters/lyrics Waters/Comeau]

i've really got some vices, the way you spread your disease
all the lying and deceiving, look what your're doing to me

i'm down in the gutter
i think i'm going insane
the next step i'm taking
i'll be headed for a shallow grave

just forget about the money, cause my addiction is for free
you're pulling me in every direction, why can't you see

i'm down in the gutter
and i'm going insane
the next step i'm taking
i'll be headed for a shallow grave

hight steppin and high rolling
c'mon and roll the dice
you think you're not coming with me
you better think twice

so get down in the gutter
so get down in the pain
the next step we're taking
we'll be headed fore a shallow grave
