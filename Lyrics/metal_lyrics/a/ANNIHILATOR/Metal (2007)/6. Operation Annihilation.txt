You tried so hard to break me
To make me bend
But I have stood the test of time

Well I've had a taste of glory
And I've seen the hell below
It's time for me to take what's mine

Target acquired
We open fire
This operation
Annihilation

So many come and go
They're changing like the wind
A product from a factory

Well I've only got one mission
And I will stand my ground
Something called integrity

This is a retribution
This is my revenge
This is a resolution
Committed 'til the end

I stand here in my silence
Content, my soul at rest
This is what I do it for

But to the leeches
The liars and the thieves
Just know I always win the war
