Another day, the same old story
There's nothing left to do
Watching life go by without me
I sit here in my room
All alone I pray for something
To get me out of here
I talked to God, I talked to Jesus
They told me what to fear

I've got this burning feeling
Building up inside
There ain't no way to stop in overdrive

Detonation

I'm going to set this place on fire
It's time to lose control
I'm going to be alive for once
And satisfy my soul

I'm okay, give me a chance to breathe
Just give me a chance to breathe
The world's insane
Look what you're doing to me
Just look what you've done to me
