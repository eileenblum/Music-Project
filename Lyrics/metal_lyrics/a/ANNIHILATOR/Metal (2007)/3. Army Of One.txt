Just one big family
Been around since the nineteen eighties

Old school, we are living in the past
They said it would never last

A few dozen of the strong survived
On a mission, to keep it alive

Hell bent, ignoring the trend
While many pretend

We stand united for something we believe in
We are the army of one
It is in our blood, this is our life
It is why we are breathing
We are the army of one

Anthrax and Motorhead
Exodus, Slayer, bang your head

Dedication when the going got tough
Was never enough

Priest, Metallica, Megadeth
Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath

They tried to kill it
Force it underground
You cannot take it down

Volume blasting
Drums are crashing
The guitar is screaming
Never give it up, never giving up
Right to the end
Sacrificing, no compromising
Is what we are bringing
Never give it up, never giving up
Fight to the end
