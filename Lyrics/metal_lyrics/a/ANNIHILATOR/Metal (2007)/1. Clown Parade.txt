One by one, the fools suck you in
Like many others before
No guilty conscience, just another sin
They're truly rotten to the core

Contracts with criminal intent
Spelling out the things they're gonna do
Liars, taking back their word
Draining the life right out of you

Over and over, they do it again
A network of thieves try to bring you an end
Never believe any promises made
Look at the crooks, they're the clowns on parade

Paid for the service
Signed the dotted line
But then get nothing in return
Result, I'm sinking and running out of time
Response, it's none of my concern
When you're exposed
The first reaction, defend it with another lie
Attempted character assassination
You cannot kill me but you try

Payback is mine
You tried to make a mockery
It's payback time
A failed attempt to bring an end to me

Two-faced, these sad little people, enjoy the spotlight while you can
Disrespecting, those who you deceive, you're just a flash in the pan
Evil, to take you for a ride, then try to damage all you've got
Pure scum and headed for a fall, karma will catch up and then you'll rot
