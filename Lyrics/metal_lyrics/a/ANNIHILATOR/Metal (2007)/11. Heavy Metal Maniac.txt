[Japanese Bonus Track]Hey little honey come along with me wont you take a free ride 
I'm living in the lust of the power of love want you by my side 
Going to make you sweat, going to make you burn heavy metal thunder is rising fast
You got to take your turn break the chains I am coming out, I am moving fast 
Looking for a hot time here tonight got to make it last
Going to wreck the town, going to make you burn 
Come little honey for the time it takes got to make you learn
Heavy metal maniac I am a heavy metal maniac stand back heavy metal maniac

Charging like thunder for your love got to make you hot 
Looking for a hot time here tonight show me what you have got 
Going to break the chains, going to break away 
Heavy metal thunder is rising fast got to make you stay
Break the wall I am coming out got to kill tonight 
Better stay back I am a maniac looking for a fight
Going to track you down you are shot to hell 
Come on little honey for the time it takes got to make you tell
Heavy metal maniac I am a heavy metal maniac stand back heavy metal maniac
