I can't tell, I think I might be going crazy
Just wanna leave it all behind
Been on the brink for many years, I'm thinking
Feels like I'm running out of time

I'm getting sick and tired, giving everything I've got,
I get nothing in return
I can't breathe
This never-ending madness,
Raining down on me like a ton of bricks,
Face in the dirt

Childish delusions, they say it's just a fantasy
You're no good, no chance, you'll never learn
Just give it up and come back to reality
Your dreams are none of my concern

I'm getting sick and tired, giving everything I've got,
I get nothing in return
I can't breathe
This never-ending madness,
Raining down on me like a ton of bricks,
Face in the dirt

What do you think you doing in your life?
You should be ashamed of yourself
I don't know why you just don't give up
You got those ideas, these dreams but know what?
You're nothing but a loser
No wonder you get no respect
You're not smart enough
You don't speak the right language
Your skin is not the right color
You're too tall, you weight too much, you're too short
You're too fat

Why you don't give up this stupid ideas and do something right for once?

Lined up, one by one
They try to bring you down
Don't ever listen what they say
Determination, the battle will be won
And all the pain will go away

[2x]
I'm getting sick and tired, giving everything I've got,
I get nothing in return
I can't breathe
This never-ending madness,
Raining down on me like a ton of bricks,
Face in the dirt
