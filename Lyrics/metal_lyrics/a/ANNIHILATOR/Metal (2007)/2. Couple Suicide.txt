We can make it something
But both know that there's nothing
It's like couple suicide, it's not going right
We ain't got no feelings, so why don't we stop dreaming
Shake it up a little bit to sleep a little better at night

We had to take two steps back, just to make it something
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out
We had to take two steps back just to make it something
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out
And I know you know it too

And we can make it something
But both know that there's nothing
It's like couple suicide, it's not going right
We ain't got no feelings, so why don't we stop dreaming
Shake it up a little bit to sleep a little better at night

We had to take two steps back, just to make it something
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out
We had to take two steps back just to make it something
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out

And I know that you know too
You know I know you do
Now what we gonna do about it
What we gonna do

When you said goodbye you can't say I didn't try
To make it all better
Something had a hold on me and I couldn't see
But now I can and now I know I'm free

We had to take two steps back, just to make it something
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out
We had to take two steps back, just to make it something
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out
We had to take two steps back, just to make it something
Get back the thing that lacked, the fact it's never gonna work out

You know I know you do
And the only way to end this thing
Is if we drive it six feet underground
