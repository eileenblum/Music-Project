["there are so many people in my mind, all trying to speak at once. how can it be so quiet on the outside when there is such a confused noise in my head? my brain is racing, pounding. I want to be free and happy, but the voices are so angry, they contradict my wish to be content. voices. voices. will I never be alone?"]

["schizos (are never alone) part I"]

Schizos are never alone
Schizos are never alone

["schizos (are never alone) part ii"]

Schizos are never alone
Schizos are never alone
