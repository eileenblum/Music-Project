Turned on the television
What did I see?
A selfish evil psychopath
Blackened eyes looking at me

On trial fight for your life
One big waste of time
A shot to the head sliced throat
A stab in the back the crime

Testified, crucified
There is no way out
Suicide, suicide
There is no way out for you

Lies lies manipulation
Too many stories to keep
But this time it's bit you in the ass
You're in too deep

Arrogant, self-loving bitch
The center of the world
Into the pits of hell girl

Testified, crucified
There is no way out
Suicide, suicide
There is no way out for you

Blacken the name of your victim
And drag his name through the mud
No regret for your actions (no regret)
And no remorse for the blood (blood)

So tragic we wonder why
You sentenced a man to die (die)

[Solo]

Pre-meditation
You tried to cover your tracks
Without hesitation
Clean up the scene of attack

Convenient memory loss
Acting like this is fun
Can't seem to remember
What the hell have you done

[2x]
Testified, crucified
There is no way out
Suicide, suicide
There is no way out

...for you
(For you)
