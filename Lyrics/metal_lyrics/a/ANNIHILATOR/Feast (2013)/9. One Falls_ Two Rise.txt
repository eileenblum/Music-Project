Alone in the darkness alone in the shame
The feelings of guilt they haunt me
Can't live with the pain
Repeating the same old story over and over again
I'm trying to find the answers will this ever end

Alone in the darkness alone in the shame
The feelings of guilt they haunt me
Can't live with the pain
Repeating the same old story over and over again
I'm trying to find the answers will this ever end

I try my best to do what's right but it's never good enough
Every day is like a fight getting through it's so tough

It's like a struggle to survive
I win the battle stop the war
But I need to stay alive tell me what it's all for

One falls two rise I shall survive
One falls two rise I shall survive

It's fight or flight feels like there's nothing I can do
I'm so cold and numb I'm so down and blue
Feels like I'm at the breaking point pressure pushing me
Is it luck is it fate why have you chosen me

One falls two rise I shall survive
One falls two rise I shall survive

Cold sweat pain in my heart
Spinning around and around
Picking me up falling apart
Kicking me when I am down
Cannot go on everything's wrong
The end of the road
Full of confusion so disillusioned
I am about to explode

Cold sweat pain in my heart
Spinning around and around
Picking me up falling apart
Kicking me when I am down
Cannot go on everything's wrong
The end of the road
Full of confusion full resolution
I am about to explode

[Solo]

We all fuck up make mistakes try not to carry the weight
Try to learn from the past it's never too late
Life is full, adversity on that you can depend
If you try to do your best it all works out in the end

One falls two rise I shall survive
One falls two rise I shall survive
