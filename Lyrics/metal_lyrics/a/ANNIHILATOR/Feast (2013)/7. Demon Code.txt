I've got a little secret my brains on fire
I can't stop the taunting voices coming from the devil's own choir (devil's choir)
Feels like I'm just pretending that everything is fine
Am I the only one with this or is it mine all mine
Say is it mine

Deep in the dark
Thoughts they haunt you
Born in the blood
They come when they want to
Push them aside
And try to control them
Waiting inside
To rule you once again

She looks so fuckin good but I could never tell
My fantasies imagination would sent me right down to hell (they sent me to hell)
Push me as hard as you like but if you only knew
I might be at the breaking point and if I am your time is through
Yeah, your time is through

Deep in the dark
Thoughts they haunt you
Born in the blood
They come when they want to
Push them aside
And try to control them
Waiting inside
To rule you once again

Screaming for attention am I the only one who sees
Twisted illusions reality is my disease

[Solo]

Demented frantic visions try to take control
This evil passenger it's living deep down in my soul (in the soul)
They say it lives in all of us living on the edge
Gotta keep it all together now or it will push you off the ledge
Will push you off the ledge

Deep in the dark
Thoughts they haunt you
Born in the blood
They come when they want to
Push them aside
And try to control them
Waiting inside
To rule you once again
