Can't resist / Can't put me down
Head is spinning / Round and round
Feeling heaven / Feels so good
I know you want me / I knew you would

I will take control
I will bleed your soul
Now it's time to feed
I am what you need

There will be no surrender
No second chance for you
My name you will remember
There's nothing you can do

Waking up / To another day
Head is screaming / I know the way
Come and get me / It's time taste
Your addiction / You can't erase

I will take control
I will bleed your soul
Now it's time to feed
I am what you need

There will be no surrender
No second chance for you
My name you will remember
There's nothing you can do

Got to get it I need some more
I got to get it gimme some more

Got to get it I need some more
I got to get it loss of control
Got to get it gimme some more
I got to get it loss of control

I don't know what i'm going to do anymore
I can't breath I can't eat I just..
I just need some more
Somebody try to help me
I love you all by the way
I can't take this anymore..please
Please god help me!

[Solo]

Devastated / Such a mess
The devil's bait / You must ingest
Life is over / You wonder why
The only answer / Is never try

I will take control
I will bleed your soul
Now it's time to feed
I am what you need

There will be no surrender
No second chance for you
My name you will remember
There's nothing you can do
