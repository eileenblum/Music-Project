I gotta tell you what's on my mind
The time that I just spent with you
Never felt this good it's never felt so right
I hope you feel the same way too

But the darkness that you see
In your perfect angel eyes
And all the pain throughout the years
Your smile and that pretty face
But I see through your disguise
Let me wipe away the tears

You're beautiful inside and outside too
A new beginning, me and you

But the darkness that you see
Through your perfect angel eyes
And all the pain throughout the years
Your smile and that pretty face
But I see through your disguise
Let me wipe away your tears

I hope you can turn to me in your darker days
When you're feeling all alone
I know a love this strong
Just cannot be denied
The time has finally come to spread your wings and fly

The darkness that you see
Through your perfect angel eyes
And all the pain throughout the years
Your smile and that pretty face
But I see through your disguise

The dark you see from those perfect angel eyes
Just let me take away the fear
That smile and your pretty face
Like a shining star at night
Let me wipe away the tears
