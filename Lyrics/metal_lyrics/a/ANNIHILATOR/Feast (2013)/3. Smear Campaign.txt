Cut me down / To make me bleed
Underground / To fill your need

Propaganda / Your personal war
Your evil slander / Hard to ignore

Preach your hatred fill the world with lies
Feels so good for you to victimize

Fantasize / You're a shooting star
Hide away / Like the coward you are

Defamation / A smear campaign
Restitution / Never blacken my name

Preach your hatred fill the world with lies
Feels so good for you to victimize
Try your best to break me can't you see
You will never suck the life from me

Demonize jeopardize
Spreading your disease
So glad you've had your fun
Making up your stories spewing them with ease
But now your time is done

Can't look in my eyes
You won't apologise
Judge you should not
But now I hope you rot

Sad, weak and insecure
Your life is just a fail
Bitterness and jealousy
Fabricate now too late,
The coffin and the nail
It's time for remedy

Can't look in my eyes
You won't apologise
Judge you should not
But now I hope you rot

Words can kill (kill) / Never thought about that
Confrontation / You run, run like a rat

Man up / It's time to testify
Stand up / It's time to say goodbye

Preach your hatred fill the world with lies
Feels so good for you to victimize
Try your best to break me can't you see
You will never suck the life from me
