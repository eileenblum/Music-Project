I wanna leave you cold in front of all your friends
I wanna break your will and leave you an empty shell
I'll make that mouth of yours take an early trip to hell
There'll be no remorse no regrets from where I stand

I wanna drive you off the nearest cliff in town
I'll be the only one laughing when you're six feet underground
I'll make certain when you fuck up it's for good
So when I say stop I'll make damn sure it's understood

You got me wrapped around your finger
So go ahead and pull it pull that trigger do it

Somebody get me outta here
Cause I'm dead in the head
And I ain't getting out of here alive
Baby being with you is like committing suicide

You got me wrapped around your finger
So go ahead and pull it pull that trigger do it

Somebody get me outta here
Cause I'm dead in the head
And I ain't getting out of here alive
Being with you baby is like committing suicide

I wanna leave you cold in front of all your friends
I wanna break your will and leave you an empty shell
I'll make that mouth of yours take an early trip to hell
There'll be no remorse no regrets from where I stand
