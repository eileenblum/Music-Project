Waking up again to face the day
I can't go on like this I'm in decay
Anxiety abound I'm in distress
My life is all about stress

Gotta fight the world
Fight
Gonna fight the world

The pressure's building up can't take the load
I don't know what to do so alone
Trapped in darkness with no way out
Just feel like screaming shout

Gotta fight the world
Fight
Gonna fight the world

Save my soul
Blackened hole / Lost control
Ashes to ashes dust to dust
I'm dying from deep within
Panic attack can't hold it back
Waiting for it to begin

[Solo]

It's easy to give up to lose all hope
To use a substance to cope
I pick myself up turn this around
I'll win this battle you won't take me down

Gotta fight the world
Fight
Gonna fight the world
