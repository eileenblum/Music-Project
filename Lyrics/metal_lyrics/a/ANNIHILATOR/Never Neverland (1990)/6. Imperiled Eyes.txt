["although a cliche subject in metal, fear of annihilation is something we've all experienced at one time or another. in this case, we try to decipher, lyrically and musically, a set of reoccurring nightmares i used to frequently have."]

centuries of war and waste
have dealt a mortal blow
mother earth begins to rot
humanity on death row
life does slowly cease to be
death seems so surreal
as earth becomes a vacant lot
there's nothing left to heal

no colour in the skies
no one left to blame
and we thought we were wise
as i fade, i feel revived
shocked back into life
opening imperilled eyes
imperilled eyes

cessation of physical life
blackness rains from above
what right did power have
to annihilate the earth i loved
now a barren wasteland
the die is cast
a planet that once did teem with life
no evidence of a past

no colour in the skies
no one left to blame
and we thought we were wise
as i fade, i feel revived
shocked back into life
opening imperilled eyes
imperilled eyes

centuries of war and waste
have dealt a mortal blow
mother earth is now no more
there's nothing left to heal

no colour in the skies
no one left to blame
and we thought we were wise
as i fade, i feel revived
shocked back into life
opening imperilled eyes
imperilled eyes
