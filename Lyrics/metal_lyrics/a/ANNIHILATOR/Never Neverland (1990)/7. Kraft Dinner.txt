["a popular north american delicacy, this macaroni and cheese dinner is probable the heavy metal musician's best friend! by 'living' off this stuff, i saved enough money to pay the rent on a rehearsal space and buy cigarettes each day! boy, what a happy teenager i was!! 'kraf dinner is full of love and butter!!!'"]

cupboard's bare, i'm so hungry
life ain't fair, give me some money
macaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack

i love, i love, i love, i love
kraf dinner

boiling water, i can't wait
it's getting hotter, it feels so great
macaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack

i love, i love, i love, i love
kraf dinner

well that was fun, but now that i'm all done
now sedate, i think i'll buy a crate
macaroni maniac, a cheddar cheese heart attack

i love, i love, i love, i love
kraf dinner

kraf dinner

kraf dinner
my dinner

i want it now
