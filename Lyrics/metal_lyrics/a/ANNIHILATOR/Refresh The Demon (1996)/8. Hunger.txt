I like to feast on thoughts of anger
I like to prey on evil minds
And I like to rip the very fabric
That keeps them all intertwined
I'm full of lies, just hold me as you die
I wrench this vice, my human sacrifice
You beg and I feed, your blood is all I need
Rapture, ecstasy, it's time to bleed for me

I love the dark and screaming madness
No one can see through my disguise
The sewer rats are just a snack
But I'm here to crush your petty lives
I'm full of lies, just hold me as you die
I wrench this vice, my human sacrifice
You beg and I feed, your blood is all I need
Rapture, ecstasy, it's time to bleed for me

I am a never-ending nightmare
And I dream of swallowing the sun
My eyes burn to embrace you
Nowhere to hide, nowhere to run
I'm full of lies, just hold me as you die
I wrench this vice, my human sacrifice
You beg and I feed, your blood is all I need
Rapture, ecstasy, it's time to bleed for me
