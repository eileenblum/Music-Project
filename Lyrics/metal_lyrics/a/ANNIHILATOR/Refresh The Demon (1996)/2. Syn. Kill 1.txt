I kill for god, and I kill for power
For propaganda, the news hour
You know my cause so don't turn your
Back you see my anger, fear my attack

Assassinate kidnap and murder, I will terrify
The death of an innocent, I will justify
Target you are now in my sight
You'll never know what hit you, you're blown by dynamite

I'm gonna overthrow you, burn to the ground
Hijack or with a bomb, I'm gonna shoot you down
Arson, ransom, I got a gun to your head
You do what I want or bang bang you're dead

I kill for god and I kill for power
For propaganda, the news hour
You know my cause so don't turn your back
You see my anger, you better fear my attack
