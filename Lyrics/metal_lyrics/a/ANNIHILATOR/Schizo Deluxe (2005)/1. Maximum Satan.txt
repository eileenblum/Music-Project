Have you heard the story
Have you heard the news
They say he's coming, you better choose

Visual horror on the tv screen
Nothing but madness ever seen

I am the beast, evil
I will install
I shall ignite the fire
Burn you all

Enter my blackened kingdom
You'll serve me well
Turn it up, maximum satan
Going straight to hell

Politicians stealing, dissapearing kids
Bribes and blackmail, for winning the bids

Crimes of passion and crimes of hate
Buy the new drug, before it's too late

I'll make you believe
That the world is like tv
I will supply you
With only negativity

I am not real
I'm just imagination
I feed on your fear
Of human devastation

One by one I'll take you down
Down

Natural disaster, you better fear
The end is coming, the end is here
