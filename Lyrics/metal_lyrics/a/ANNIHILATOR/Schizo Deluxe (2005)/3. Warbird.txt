War, the name of the game
Take you down to the wire
There's gonna be hell to pay
Gonna set you world on fire

Bombs, blowing it up
The order, annihilation
This is the way we'll fuck you up
Welcome to your devastation

Fly with the warbird
Die by the warbird

Fire, give it all you got
We're gonna make the fuckers burn
Raining death from high above
Way past the point of no return

Rush, unleash the power
You'll never see the coming attack
At three thousand miles an hour
You'll never feel the god-damned impact

Perish in a fiery hell
No turning back
You'll never live, no story to tell
Get ready, second attack

Boom, they begin to strike
The ultimate supremacy
Never before have seen the like
It's the ultimate insanity
