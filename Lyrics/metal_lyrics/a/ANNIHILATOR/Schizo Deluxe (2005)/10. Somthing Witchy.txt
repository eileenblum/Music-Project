Why can't you see what I am going through
Why are you screaming at me
What are you talking about
I can't hear you and I can't understand when you shout
Why can't you see what you have put me through
Why are you screaming at me
What are you talking about
I can't hear you and I can't understand when you shout

There's something witchy about you
What it is, I can't explain
Maybe it's your blackened eyes
Or maybe you're insane

I cannot take you mood swings anymore
You're so abusive
You make me miserable
Throwing things and now it's time getting physical
I've had enough I'm heading for the door
You're so abusive
You make me miserable
Throwing things and now it's time getting physical

Gone, gone, gone
So sick and tired
Gone, gone, gone
This ain't a home
Gone, gone, gone
Just one desire
Gone, gone, gone
Leave me alone

I can't believe that I was gonna stay
Get some help
You're really gonna need it
So good luck, I really do mean it
So glad I moved a million miles away
Get some help
You're really gonna need it
So good luck, I really do mean it
