The adrenaline that you get
From the pain that you inflict
Does it make you the man
Does it make you the shit

The feeling that I get
Is like the pain that's in my neck
When you're treating me like I'm a child
And you're talking to me like I'm a pet

I don't want you, I don't need you
Wasting all my time
I don't want you, I don't need you
Messing with my pride

Unnecessary actions
To make you feel like a man
I'll never have all the answers
I'll never meet your demands

What exactly is it that you want
I've given all that I can
Was it part of your headtrip
Was it all in the plans

I can feel it in your eyes
All the weakness I despise
I can see past all your lies
You're the devil in disguise

The feeling that I get
Is like the pain that's in my neck
Does it make you the man
Does it make you the shit

Come on and break me down
So you can build yourself up higher
Add more to the flames
Add more to the fire
