Try it if you must, to change my destiny
Can't you see that this is part of me
The pressure's building, I can't take the load
The more you push me, the more I explode

Never gonna break you
Never gonna shake you
From the path you're on
Cause you're too far gone

A test of will and a test of might
The target's set, my goal in sight
Hell-bent, I got a one-track mind
Get in my way, I'll leave you all behind
Hell-bent, I got a one-track mind
I'll do what I want cause this is my time

They're gonna try to break you
They're gonna try to shake you
From the path you're on
Cause you're too far gone

They'll always try to break you
They'll always gonna shake you
