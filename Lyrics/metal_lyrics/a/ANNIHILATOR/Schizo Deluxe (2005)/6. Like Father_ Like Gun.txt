Born into the violence
The cycle begins again
Bred to carry on
A lesson that never ends

Spoon-fed propaganda
To the children of the damned
Spreading it like a disease
Spreading across the land

Hate, intimidate, fear
A violent education
Hate, intimidate, fear
A hopless generation

Like father, like gun

Marching in the streets
Preparing another attack
Incendiary devices
Strapped to the back

Justifying their actions
All in the name of a god
But what kind of religion
Condones a killing squad

No more sorrow, no more pain
Let these children live again

Born into the violence
To the children of the damned
Bred to carry on
Spreading across the land
