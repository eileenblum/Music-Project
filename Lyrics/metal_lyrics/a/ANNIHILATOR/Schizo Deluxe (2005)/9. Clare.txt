Time keeps on ticking away
Another day in disease
I'm looking for someone special
Crawling on my hands and my knees

Somebody turn the lights on
I can't breathe the air
Won't someone help me find my
Little Clare

I want you to see me when the lights go down
I wish I could be me when the lights go down
I'm running out of time, I'd do anything at all
I want you to see me when the lights go down

I can't stop thinking of you
Always on my mind
I see you in the shadows
All the time

You never talk to me
And you're never there
I'm getting tired of all this
And you don't even care

Twisting and turning
My body is burning
Their position runs deep down inside
No one will listen
They make the incision
Now something inside me has died

Come take Alice now
Look at Alice now

I wrap my arms around you
Protect you from the night
I'll save you from this madness
Make everything alright

Get back, don't come any closer
I'll crush you with all of my might
White men with a needle, a cocktail
A schizo delight
