The lamb and the lion - I destroyed you
I tore your world apart
I left the pieces bleeding in the dark
The light and the darkness - come between us
I built a wall of tears
I built it straight through your heart
it's in the blood - running through my veins
the pain inside is driving me insane
I've done it all before and I'll do it again and again
cause it's in the blood - it's in the blood
the dream and the nightmare
lay on the pillow beside you every night
cause what you see is what you get - from me
The light and the darkness - come between us
I built a wall of tears
I built it straight through your heart
it's in the blood - running through my veins
the pain inside is driving me insane
I've done it all before and I'll do it again and again
cause it's in the blood - it's in the blood
deep in my dreams
I'm all you want from me
I'm all of light, I'm electricity
The light and the darkness - come between us
