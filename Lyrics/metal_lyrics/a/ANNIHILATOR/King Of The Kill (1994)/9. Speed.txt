I'm on a mission, I'm gonna break the speed of sound
My pulse is racing, I'm gonna have to hunt you down, hunt you down
Acceleration I gotta, gotta go faster
Give me more speed
They say I'm crazy and I'm headed for disaster
Give me more speed
No competition,left in my dust - they'll never learn, they'll never learn
This is my rocket, my aviation fuel is set to burn, she's set to burn
Acceleration I gotta, gotta go faster
Give me more speed
They say I'm crazy and I'm headed for disaster
Give me more speed
Go
You wanna rock and roll at a million miles an hour
Just put your foot to the floor, c'mon and feel the power
I know exactly what I'm after
I know exactly what I need
I need the speed
I'm on a mission, I'm gonna break the speed of sound, sound
My pulse is racing, I'm gonna have to chase you down, chase you down

Acceleration I gotta, gotta go faster
Give me more speed
They say I'm crazy and I'm headed for disaster
Give me more speed

Acceleration I gotta, gotta go faster
Give me more speed
They say I'm crazy and I'm headed for disaster
Give me more speed

Acceleration I gotta, gotta go faster
Give me more speed
They say I'm crazy and I'm headed for disaster
Give me more speed
