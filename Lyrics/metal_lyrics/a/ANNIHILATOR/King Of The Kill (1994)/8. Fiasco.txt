You take the time to cut me down
you're a fool, you're the talk of the town
so jealous, can't you see
it's your own insecurity
your life is a mess, slightly obsessed
are you a paranoid schizo?
what a fiasco
looking for scandal, you're under the gun
cause I'm having so much fun
they say you're missing a screw
this laugh is just for you, ha!
I don't hold any grudges
I'm such a nice guy
forgive and forget or better yet
goodbye
