I am a box, I am a screen
I'm every nightmare, I'm every dream
I am the window over your land
so turn me on, come take my hand
don't push me
I offer you scandal, I offer a wealth
of gratuitous violence, hazardous to your health
I give the vision, of how life should be
I choose your heroes, come follow me
Come follow me
it's just a box, it's just a screen
it's only a nightmare, it's only a dream
we give the vision, of how life should be
we choose our own heroes, come follow me
