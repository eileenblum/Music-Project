My father tried to tell me son just get your feet on the ground
you're in deep way over your head just turn your life around
poor mother, all I ever gave to her was pain - I didn't realise
the last thing I remember was the tears running from her eyes
something happened along the way - I was a bad child
something happened they'd always say - I was a little wild
I was a bad child

playing hookey, drinkin octane, I didn't care anymore - no
always running against the grain, I was rotten to the core
I could live forever - until they threw me out the door
I was sleeping on the floor
something happened along the way - I was a bad child
something happened they'd always say - I was a little wild

I was a bad child

My father tried to tell me son just get your feet on the ground
you're in deep way over your head, I've turned my life around
my mother was the best to me, I guess I never realized
one thing that I'll never forget was the tears running from her
eyes
something happened along the way - I was a bad child
something happened they'd always say - I was a little wild
some along the way now I'm living for a better day
something happened along the way - I was a bad child
running wild
