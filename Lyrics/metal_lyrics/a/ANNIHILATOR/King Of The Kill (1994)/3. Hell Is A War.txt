hiding in the darkness, sheltered from the rain
my mom and dad are gone now, I'm alone again
is anybody out there? does anybodycare?
I don't wanna live here anymore, I don't wanna live

see the people suffering, watch the children die
doesn't it make you wonder why?
money and power, the television's red
one by one, they collect the dead

hell is a war, hell, what is it for?
they'll slay the innocent and every mothers son
to get the ethnic cleansing done
hey Mr.Politician, what are you gonna do?
this nightmare's up to you
stopping for nothing, I fire at will
in the name of my religion I shoot to kill
to kill
Hell is a war
