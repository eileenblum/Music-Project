Welcome to the hothouse, the game is called 21
I was in debt right up to my neck, I wasn't having any fun
but then the dealer turned around, she looked me right in the eye
I got no time for messing around, but you know I had to give it
a try

she got me under the gun - she can't have 21

she asked me why I wasn't taking my time, sweat running down my
neck
I had the 6, the lady got 9 from the bottom of the deck
a 4 for me, it was a good thing, but she was sitting on a face
I said hit me with your best shot and she gave me the ace

she got me under the gun - she can't have 21
I've got to be the chosen one - she can't have 21
I've gotta win, I've gotta win or I might as well be dead
God let me win, just let me win, or I might as well be dead
Deuce's up, dealer has 21
