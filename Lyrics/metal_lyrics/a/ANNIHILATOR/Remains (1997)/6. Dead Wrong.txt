tar me, feather me and push me around
punish me and correct me
kick me when I'm down crucify me and stone me
hang me out to die
well light a fire and burn me
all because of a lie
all these years you have taken away
you don't wanna listen
don't care what I say
you're making a mistake
ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I'm tired of doing the time
I shall return, then you will learn
vengeance will be mine
try me, judge me and put me to your test
use me and abuse me
come on and do your best, gas me
shoot me, destroy me if you can
slice me up and dice me
then bury me in the sand
all these years you have taken away
you don't wanna listen
don't care what I say
you're making a mistake
ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I'm tired of doing the time
I shall return, then you will learn
vengeance will be mine
connect me, fry me, electricity
well off with the head
then hold it up for all to see
boil me and screw me, stretch me open wide
injecting the poison, cook me from inside
all these years you have taken away
you don't wanna listen
don't care what I say
you're making a very big mistake
ashes to ashes, dust to dust
I'm tired of doing the time
I shall return, then you will learn
vengeance will be mine
