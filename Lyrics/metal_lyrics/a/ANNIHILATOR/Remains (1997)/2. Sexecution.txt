I've heard a lot about you
and I've heard all about your disease
well they say you're an animal
with a rabid desire to please
I'm on the hunt, you're on the prowl
do you wanna do the time
come on, we've got nothing to lose
let's commit the crime
I want your flesh

sexecution

so the feeling is mutual
the huner's gonna turn into a feast
got to cool the fire, control desire
it's time to unleash the beast
I wanna sex you up, sex you down
I wanna do it all over and all around
russian roulette at a hundred degrees
I don't wanna die but you sure can please
I want your flesh

sexecution

now that it's over the temperature falls
reality begins to rise
what have I done, under the gun
never should've rolled the dice
how do your feel, miss sex appeal
have your played this game before
a nail in the coffin, a bullet to the head
take the chance and wind up dead
