accidental intake, down the throat
the chances of survival can be remote
extreme reaction, I got to medicate
must inject the dose, I hope that I'm not late
push the plunger all the way
pray to live another day
feel the rush through the veins
got to, got to un-invite the pain
panic setting in, the waiting has begun
frustration, the damage has been done
it's getting hard to breathe, the swelling is intense
the last shot, it's the end of my defence
push the plunger all the way
pray to live another day
feel the rush through the veins
got to, got to un-invite the pain
