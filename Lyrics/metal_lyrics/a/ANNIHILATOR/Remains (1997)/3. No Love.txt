You nail yourself like Jesus
posing on a cross
you're waiting for the saviour
you're waiting to get off
I seen you in the movies
I've passed you on the street
I saw you walk on water
or was that make-believe
there is no love anymore
I am hanging helpless here
in front of you

a broken toy, a puppet
that no one wants to use
I try to wake you slowly
you push me to the ground
loathe the final round
there is no love anymore
I throw myself at the sky
and fall back to the ground
I throw myself off the earth
and you don't hear a sound
trapped in rage, but you won't listen
bursting veins, but you won't listen
there is no love anymore
