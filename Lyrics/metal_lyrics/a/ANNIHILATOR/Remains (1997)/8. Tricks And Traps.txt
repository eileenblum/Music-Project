Hey you, I need a friend, I hope you feel the same
this life is sucking me dry, how do you deal with the pain
step closer, my friend, come and hear my pitch
I understand, just how do you feel, well ain't life a bitch

tricks and traps, slice you to nothing
tricks and traps, never let 'em get to you

they'll drag you down, down to the bottom
tricks and traps, you better beware
I bring you pleasure, I'll bring you pain
I heal and disease, play-time, I like to ruin for fun
I'll bring you down to your knees
illusions and dis-illusions, I make them up for real
the damage is random, so believe me, it's time to kneel

tricks and traps, slice you to nothing
tricks and traps, never let 'em get to you

they'll drag you down, down to the bottom
tricks and traps, you better beware
can you feel the madness, racing through the brain
psychedelic to the core, tell me, are we not insane
I try to make you fail, I'll put you to the test
there's one thing, you should never forget, is that life never
rests
