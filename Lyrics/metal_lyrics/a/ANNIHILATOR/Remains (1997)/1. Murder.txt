Six feet under
no longer alive
this is your destiny
cause I have arrived
I am not a nightmare
I am disease
and I'll bring society
to it's knees

murder the world
I was born to murder the world

the fools and the innocent
they're all the same
to me, I thrive on
pleasure and pain
it's not a war of attrition
I never lose the games
feel the grand invasion
feasting in the veins
I was born to murder the world
your strenght devoured
just wither away
'til the final hour
the battle is won
march to the beat
I am the plague, invincible
that you can't defeat
I was born to murder the world
