That old man's waiting in the snow again
he knows what he knows
but it isn't the same, watching insults
launched over his head
he's out of the game but he isn't quite dead

the human remains
he fought fear with hope but you'll eventually know
one day you are the man in the snow
and it doesn't matter what fills you with dread
the game is a game and life is a thread
the human remains
