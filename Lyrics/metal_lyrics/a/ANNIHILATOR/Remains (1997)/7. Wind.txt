I'm walking in the darkness, I'm trying to un-wind
just the kind of peace, I need to soothe my mind
I'm tired of all the noise, tired of all the pain
escape in the night, just to face another day

I'm talking to the wind

I can feel the calm, the pressures start to go
and I can feel the life, it now begins to flow
there's something round the corner
there's something in the air
a cool, cool chill but I really don't care

I'm talking to the wind

showers, under moonlight, try to rain on the parade
don't fight the feelings, try to drain them out
wash them away and they'll end without a doubt

I'm talking to the wind

notrhing's going to stop me cause I'm heading for the sky
release the tension, it's good to be alive
don't try to limit me, don't try to bring me down
cause I've found a way to soar above the clouds

I'm talking to the wind
