Psychological warfare
The best I've ever seen
Caught in the clutches
Of the queen of mean
Spewing your madness
You make me ill
This kind of abuse
Drives one to kill
Another day breaks
Can't you see
Your dedication
To destroy me
I won't break, I'm not gonna take
I won't break for you
I won't break, I'm not gonna take
What you put me through
So damn brainwashed
The dirty tricks
Inflicting torture
To get your kicks
Assert your power
Take control
Try to drag me
Down the hole
Another day breaks
Can't you see
Your dedication
To destroy me
I won't break, I'm not gonna take
I won't break for you
I won't break, I'm not gonna take
What you put me through
I won't break, I'm not gonna take
I won't break for you
I won't break, I'm not gonna take
What you put me through
You're goin' down
You're goin' down
You're goin' down
It's judgment's day
Punishment and pain
You'll never be the same
Leave you in the dust
Your twisted dreams are crushed
Crushed

You tried your best
To intimidate me
Emotional blackmail
In the first degree
Manipulation
I'll testify
If I hadn't escaped
I would have died
Another day breaks
Can't you see
Your dedication
To destroy me
Another day breaks
Can't you see
Your dedication
You won't destroy me
