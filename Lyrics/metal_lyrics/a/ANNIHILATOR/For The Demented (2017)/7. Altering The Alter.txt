A new religion with a guarantee
A new condition destroying me
Another gateway for the youth
Intervention, it's time for the truth

Do your best, defend and testify
Psychoactive consequence, try to justify
Altering the altar, the great debate
Overdone, damage done, too late

Motivation sits in the back
Anxiety, panic attack
Another round, another hit
Unreliable, you cannot commit

Psychotic break, another episode
Memory loss, pure overload
Paranoia, and not fantasy
Hallucinations, why can you not see
