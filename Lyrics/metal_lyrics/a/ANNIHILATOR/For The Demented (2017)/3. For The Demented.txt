I wanna live like there's no tomorrow,
And I don't care what the people say.
They say I'm mad, and completely loco,
But I wouldn't have it any other way.

I went to see a respected doctor
To find out just what was wrong with me,
She made fun of my black shirts and music.
She took my money.

We try to judge and diagnose you,
Your dreams and passions,
It's time to give them up.
You gotta fade into society.
Change, or else you're out of luck.

Challenge unfairness, humanity,
One life's essential, you'll see, you will see.

Sometimes I feel like I'm the only one,
My head is racing,
But I don't want to come undone.
It's your life,
So make it your own,
Remember you're not alone.
