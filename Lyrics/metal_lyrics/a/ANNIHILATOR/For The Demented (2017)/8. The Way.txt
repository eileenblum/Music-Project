It all began with a big dream
And a very long way to go
Thirty-three years of ups and downs
More than you'll ever know
Therapy, a drug-free drug
Channelling out my aggressions
Sympathy, I don't need none
But I'm up to my neck in obsession

I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna do it my own way
Cause that's the way I like it

I don't need to be the main attraction
I'm happy just to get a piece of the action
And that's the way I like it

One-track mind, never lookin' behind
Change it up, Just to cause a commotion
I can't wait to put the next one out
I gotta set it in motion

The years gone by, don't question why
Cause the past is over and done
I don't worry 'bout the end of days
Cause it feels like I've just begun

I don't care what the people say
We're gonna do it our own way
Cause that's the way we like it

We don't need to be the main attraction
We're happy just to get a piece of the action
And that's the way we like it
