The war inside my brain
Help me stop the pain
Torturing the head
All I see is dead

Welcome of the doctor, but you can call me god
Insanity experiment facade
Won't you be my guest in these elegant procedures
Help me make them all believers

Twisted lobotomy

All get to a room
See the hands of doom
Camera shows the knife
Slashing out the life

Welcome of the doctor, but you can call me god
Insanity experiment facade
Won't you be my guest in these elegant procedures
Help me make them all believers

Twisted lobotomy

Waking from the dream
I can hear a scream
Wait, I cannot feel
Oh my God, it's real

Welcome of the doctor, but you can call me god
Insanity experiment facade
Won't you be my guest in these elegant procedures
Help me make them all believers

Twisted lobotomy
