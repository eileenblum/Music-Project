Pieces of you, they lie on the floor
But I can't put you back together no more
Unspeakable things come over me
I don't know what's real or fantasy
I gather you up in a white sheet
I go to the kitchen, get something to eat
You lie on the table, torn limb from limb
Your head on the counter, my sweet, little Kim
A terrible thing has come over me
I can't remember anything
I told you to stop but it's too late
Deep inside, these pieces I ate
A terrible thing has come over me
I can't remember anything
I told you to stop but it's too late
Deep inside, these pieces I ate
How dare you complain,
Attack and annoy
You played with my mind
I'm nobody's toy
The yelling the screaming, you gave me no choice
Just look what you've done, you made me shut up your voice
I ask you why you made me angry again
You tell me I'm mad and committing a sin
The voices said to stop your bitching
Son now you're quiet, your pieces are twitching
A terrible thing has come over me
I can't remember anything
I told you to stop but it's too late
Deep inside, these pieces I ate
A terrible thing has come over me
I can't remember anything
I told you to stop but it's too late
Deep inside, these pieces I ate
Deep, down inside,
I set you free
Silence, I love it now
No more madness at all
Let's eat
Mayonnaise and some pepper, a bit of salt
Join me in this romantic dinner-for-two
Now it's you and me together
We can be as one, forever, digest
I really don't know why you think it's my fault
This bloody mess is all because of you
A meal and a drink, the color's so red
There's blood all over, I need to be fed
A silver of meat, kept alive in me
To silence you has been a giant relief
To taste, to chew, done right and rare
I'll bet you don't know that I just didn't care
The hate, the garbage that you spewed at me
The torture, abuse, insanity
A terrible thing has come over me
I can't remember anything
I told you to stop but it's too late
Deep inside, these pieces I ate
A terrible thing has come over me
I can't remember anything
I told you to stop but it's too late
Deep inside, these pieces I ate
Over, it's over
Over, it's over
Over, it's over
Over, it's over
