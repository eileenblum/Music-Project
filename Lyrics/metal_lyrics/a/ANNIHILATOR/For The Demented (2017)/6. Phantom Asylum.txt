Sentenced to live in the mind but I'm gonna break free
Psychic violence all around, they're coming for me

Creepy crawlies under the skin, I gotta scratch them out
This is taking far too long, I'm gonna slice a quicker route

Phantom asylum
Voices in my head
Phantom asylum
Flee or be dead

Dark shadows and white coats, gotta get away from the door
Screamin' like a demon, try to disappear in the floor

Injection, prevention, I can't let them get me sedate
They're bursting through, with a blinding light, I can't wait to make my escape

Waking up, white coats surround me, tell me what have you done
Paralyzed, I'm hypnotized by the light of the sun

Sentenced to live in the mind but I'm gonna break free
Psychic violence all around and they're coming for me
