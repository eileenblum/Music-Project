Something's wrong with this kid, it's plain as it can be
Can't pay attention, must be ADHD
Hyperactive, inattentive, impulsivity
Spaced out and distracted, living in a dream

I try to concentrate and I try to sleep
My mind is racing then sinking much too deep
No one understands me but I don't really care
Cause I'm not all there

Constantly in motion, I just can't settle down
Everything seems wrong with me, I can't fit in the crowd
Well, I try so hard to listen to the words they speak
When I can't remember things, I'm labelled as a freak

All the struggle with the madness, try not to give a damn
This silent pain and suffering has made me what I am
Take this curse amd maximize, we are the chosen few
Use it to advantage, a gift from me to you

I never wanted to be like this
I just wanna be free, genesis

Focusing intensely, on things that interest me
But everything else is scrambled, aplologies
Confusion, an illusion, things aren't what they seem
Never judge from the outside, intelligence supreme

Thanks to revorn613 for sending track #4 lyrics.
