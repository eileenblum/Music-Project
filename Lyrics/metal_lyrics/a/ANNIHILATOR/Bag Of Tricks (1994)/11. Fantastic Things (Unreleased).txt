A new day lies before me
And something doesn't seems to be the same
My life's so full with so much dark affection
I realize I'm the only one to blame

Fantastic things speaking to me
I've opened my eyes to the new reality
The pain I've known, slowly fade away
Fantastic thing speaking to me

Lost in a endless dream
That's haunted me forever
This feelings I didn't show
Brief the confusion
Will I can daily those just eating away
Theres so much in life I need to know

Fantastic thing speaking to me
I've open my eyes to new reality
The pain I've known, was slowly faded away
Fantastic thing speaking to me

As I awaken, it all become so clear
and you're so good, so deep inside
Just look around and listen, the tales of agony
The season of my life this time, is seted free

A new day lies before me
Echoing those twisted senseless memories
I've had the time to stop and wonder
Of the world it's sorting out
And what there is to see

Fantastic thing speaking to me
I've open my eyes to new reality
The pain I've known, slowly fades away
Fantastic thing speaking to me
Fantastic thing speaking to me
Fantastic thing speaking to me
The pain I've known, slowly fades away
Fantastic thing speaking to me
Fantastic thing speaking to me
