Here we are at the gallery of the grotesque
Come a little closer just a few more steps
As we enter now we see the neophyte of life 
Looking for the saviour living on the knife

Gallery of the grotesque
Where your fears are brought from rest
Grotesque gallery of the grotesque
Strength survives this fatal test
Grotesque gallery of the grotesque
Where your fears are brought from rest
Grotesque gallery of the grotesque
Strength survives this fatal test grotesque

Feel the rhythm pounding on madly through your veins
Are you willing to come with me to go insane
Who here will try to die no echo no last goodbye
Psychic revelations welcome to your death 

There we are at the gallery of the grotesque 
What is alive inside your brain 
You can leave would not you play my game
In your room dream too much blood 
Scream what is out there
