Hey man, you got a dollar, maybe some change?
No sorry man I don't have any money, I'm in a hurry leave me alone.
Honest, all I want is something to eat.
Yeah right, the way you smell you'd probably spend it on booze.
I wasn't always like this.

I woke up this morning I could not get out of bed
I had a couple of drinks last night I guess it went to my head
I slept through my wake up call forgot to feed the cat
There is only one thing wrong I do not know where I am at

Excuse, no use, it does not work for me
You have had your chances so why bother me
Tic toc, just look at the clock, your life is passing by
You have had your chances, do not bother me
One drink is all need you do not care about the life you need
You got an evil appetite to feed

I have got to get a move on it is a quarter to ten
I cannot find my keys at all forgot my suit again
I get to work, the boss says "late" this happens everyday
Once more, you have lost your job I do not care anyway

Yesterday I lost my job it does not bother me
I will do what I want and I will do it again you just wait and see
Time for a drink and no time to think with a bottle of rum
Well I am running low and it is time to go out to get me some
