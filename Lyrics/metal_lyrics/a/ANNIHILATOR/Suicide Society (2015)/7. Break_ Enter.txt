I came home in the afternoon someone kicked in the door
Three little rats they came back for more
Nine one one theyÂ´re on the run instincts kickinÂ´ in
I start the chase of human waste the race begins

No remorse no respect for what you do
Traumatize victimize karma will catch you

Break enter break and enter yeah

Split up I take two sprinting down the road
Grab one throw her in the bushes rage and explode
One down and one to go I got him in my sights
IÂ´m gonna get you punk IÂ´m gonna make it right

No remorse no respect for what you do
Traumatize victimize karma will catch you

Break enter break and enter
Break break and enter and enter 
Break break and enter yeah

Who do you think you are to break into my place
These are my private things and this is my own space
IÂ´m in shock but I know one thing
I think you better get the fuck out now
I think you better run and run real fast 
Yeah yeah Â´cause youÂ´re gonna pay
IÂ´ll pay you back for this here I come

You and you IÂ´m talkinÂ´ to you
You wanna cross that line invade where I dwell
Try again just one more time
IÂ´ll send you to hell yes I will yeah

Yeah I got you taking to the ground 
Blood on your face blood on your face
TimeÂ´s up police show up youÂ´re such a damn disgrace 

No remorse no respect for what you do
Traumatize victimize karma will catch you

Break enter break and enter
Break break and enter and enter 
Break break and enter
