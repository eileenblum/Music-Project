Yeah ooh wakinÂ´ up to another day my one track mind
IÂ´ve got to have it I gotta feed where will I find
Medication I need sedation somethinÂ´ for the pain
I gotta get me what I want or IÂ´ll go inside

Fight for survival death on arrival huh

I tried to quit nut I know itÂ´s wrong and itÂ´s killinÂ´ me
Oh maybe next week IÂ´ll give it a try 
WeÂ´ll just wait and see in that one
My heart is racinÂ´ I canÂ´t stop pacinÂ´ but I know what to do
Just take a walk down the block narcotic avenue

Fight for survival death on arrival
Fight for survival death on arrival

Feel the rush inside your veins
No concern of what remains
You cannot stop donÂ´t blame me
IÂ´ll be the last thing you see uh

Yeah IÂ´m cominÂ´ down another round time to up the dose
But now youÂ´re dead the headline read fatal overdose
Now youÂ´re dead and itÂ´s over and done
