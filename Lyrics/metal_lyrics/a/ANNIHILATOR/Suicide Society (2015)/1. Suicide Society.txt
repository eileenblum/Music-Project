A suicide society
We've all gone bloody mad

Welcome to the dark side
The human race
Crumbling before us
Ending in disgrace

Politicians, corporations
A slap on the wrist
Spewing toxic chemicals
Now mother earth is pissed

What have we done?
It's only just begun
This suicide society is getting out of hand
We'll never learn
Until we burn
A suicide society
We're all just fucking mad

Give me everything I want
Never satisfied
Extreme religion
Hell-bent on genocide
Pesticide
Open wide
Poisoning the well
Radiation
Medication
We're all just going to hell

What have we done?
It's only just begun
This suicide society is getting out of hand
We'll never learn
Until we burn
A suicide society
We've all gone bloody mad

Whoa, no respect for what we're given
Humanity just wasting away, wasting away

Take the blame
Feel the shame
Play your games
Down in flames
We're going down in flames

Going down

We're runnin' out of time
But we can't wait any longer

What have we done?
It's only just begun
This suicide society is getting out of hand
We'll never learn
Until we burn
A suicide society
We're all just fucking mad

What have we done?
It's only just begun
A suicide society
We've all gone bloody mad

Are we just gonna sit around and watch it all go away,
Decay,
Or are we gonna come together and do something about this mess we made?
