Dedicated to the chosen craft
I made the choice there is no going back
I never deviated from the goal
And I never doubted givinÂ´ up my soul
Try to take it down and to offend
It will not break and it will never bend
What you give you get back in return
Cross me fool and you will learn

Fight on survival clawing away til the end
Fight on survival this is how I get my
This is how I get my get my revenge

Spitting in your face verbal attack
Daggers in the air behind your back
Try to stop me if you think you must
The mirror looks back at you in disgust
Slam it all and drag it through the mud
You cannot shut it down itÂ´s in the blood
Critics itÂ´s not what you expect
But show some goddamn respect

Fight on survival clawing away til the end
Fight on survival this is how I get revenge
Fight on survival clawing away til the end
Fight on survival this is how I get my
This is how I get my get my revenge

Sometimes it gets lonely lonely
And sometimes itÂ´s full of pain full of pain
But if I could go back in time back in time
Would I do it all again yes I would

Yeah I donÂ´t give a damn what you say
Â´cause nothingÂ´s gonna get in my way
ThereÂ´s time to kill and nothinÂ´ left to do
Just sit and judge who the fuck are you

Fight on survival clawing away til the end
Fight on survival this is how I get revenge
Fight on survival clawing away til the end
Fight on survival this is how I get my
This is how I get my get my revenge ooh my revenge
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah this is it yeah so long
