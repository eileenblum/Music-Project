Freak show
Welcome to this haunted house of horror
Nightmares to begin, just around the corner
Victim, target, I slip inside your mind
You'll never see me creeping up behind

Over and over the same song and dance
Trying to not fall asleep
Somebody help me, it's creeping again
And it wants to feed

Hiding in shadows, moving around in the dark
Waiting like an animal to rip you apart
Panic, try to escape, run, run, open the door
The sandman awaits scream as you hit the floor

Over and over the same song and dance
Trying to not fall asleep
Somebody help me, it's creeping again
And it wants to feed

Parasomnia, am I dreaming?
Parasomnia, wake up screaming
Parasomnia, deadly dreaming
Parasomnia, I wake up screaming

That's right

Demon, incubus
Underneath the bed
You better get up now or you'll be dead
Awake, open your eyes
And tell me what you see
Let me introduce myself, insanity

Over and over the same song and dance
Trying to not fall asleep
Somebody help me, it's creeping again
And it wants to feed

Over and over the same song and dance
Trying to not fall asleep
Somebody help me, it's creeping again
And it's time to feed
