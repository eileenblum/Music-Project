Yeah aah I creep into you like a perfect disease
I prey upon your state of mind uh
I come to get you in your moment of weakness
ItÂ´s only time until youÂ´re mine

Follow me donÂ´t you see
That this is what you deserve

Just sit back as I sink in my teeth
I get my hooks into your soul
YouÂ´ll never see me until itÂ´s too late
And I will never let you go

Follow me donÂ´t you see
That this is what you deserve
Bow to me canÂ´t you see
IÂ´m the one you serve ooh
IÂ´m the one you serve serve me

Medicate intoxicate I feel so numb
Rapture ecstasy second to none
Tyrannize victimize corrupt the brain corrupt
Consequence death sentence or drivinÂ´ you drivinÂ´ you
DrivinÂ´ you drivinÂ´ you insane yeah yeah yeah

Welcome to your new obsession
Another self destructing slave
Swallowing the poison one by one
IÂ´m gonna take you to your grave aah

Follow me donÂ´t you see
That this is what you deserve
Bow to me canÂ´t you see
IÂ´m the one you serve
You serve serve I said you serve
