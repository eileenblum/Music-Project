I canÂ´t believe this is the end
IÂ´ve so many thing left to do
When itÂ´s over and when itÂ´s done
Will you remember me too
I donÂ´t wanna know I donÂ´t wanna hear
I gotta find something to blame
Too blind to see the writings on the wall
So was it all in vain uh

Our destiny oh canÂ´t you see
The bell begins to chime
ItÂ´s not too late so donÂ´t hesitate
WeÂ´re runninÂ´ out of time

Try to give it give it all you got
Live every minute before itÂ´s time to rot
Try to give it Â´cause death is calling you
Live every minute before your time is through

Yeah so many chances and so many dreams
Too many regrets to ignore
And IÂ´m begginÂ´ for mercy IÂ´m begginÂ´ on my knees
I canÂ´t take this anymore

Our destiny oh canÂ´t you see
The bell begins to chime
ItÂ´s not too late so donÂ´t hesitate
WeÂ´re runninÂ´ out of time

Try to give it give it all you got
Live every minute before itÂ´s time to rot
Try to give it Â´cause death is calling you
Live every minute before your time is through

Please say a prayer for the dyinÂ´
And now I must say goodbye
My time is up and IÂ´m full of regret
DonÂ´t let life pass you by

Our destiny oh canÂ´t you see
The bell begins to chime
ItÂ´s not too late so donÂ´t hesitate
WeÂ´re runninÂ´ out of time

Try to give it give it all you got
Live every minute before itÂ´s time to rot
Try to give it Â´cause death is calling you
Live every minute before your time is through 
Ooh ooh ooh yeah huh huh huh haa
Â´cause death is calling you itÂ´s calling you
Your time is through your time is through calling you
Death is calling for you ooh
