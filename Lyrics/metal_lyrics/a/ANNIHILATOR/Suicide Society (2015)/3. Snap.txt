Save me save me take me take me to another place 
I donÂ´t wanna see your face anymore oh

Aah ss you try hard to annoy me to creep under my skin
Slowly destroyinÂ´ the end of me it begins

SomethingÂ´s building up inside a rage IÂ´ve never known
God help me please help me IÂ´m losinÂ´ control yeah

Save me take me to another place 
DonÂ´t wanna see your face anymore no ooh

I just want you to go away
Hate shame and degrade me
I gotta get you out of my head
The abuse that you give me
I think IÂ´d rather be dead yeah uh

SomethingÂ´s building up inside a hope youÂ´ll never know
God help me please help me IÂ´m losinÂ´ control yeah

Save me take me to another place 
DonÂ´t wanna see your face anymore no
Save me take me to another place 
I donÂ´t wanna see your face anymore no

Snap itÂ´s time to end the nightmare and put you behind 

Save me take me to another place 
DonÂ´t wanna see your face anymore no
Save me save me take me take me to another place 
I donÂ´t wanna see your face anymore no oh snap
