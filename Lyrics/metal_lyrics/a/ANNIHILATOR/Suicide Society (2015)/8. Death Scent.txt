Aah target the weak plan the attack
Recruiting them for a violent attack
Spreading your lies planting the seed
Violence and force to get what you need

Arming the bomb strapping it on
Time to move in for the kill
The freaks come out to play

Death scent fear is in the air
Death scent thereÂ´s blood everywhere

Vultures on a warpath
First prize for a bloodbath
You ready to die are you ready to kill
The more the better fire at will

Arming the bomb strapping it on
Time to move in for the kill
The freaks come out to play

Death scent fear is in the air
Death scent thereÂ´s blood everywhere
Death scent fear is in the air
Death scent thereÂ´s blood everywhere
I want you to breathe for me go

Whoa pure scum radical
Roaming the earth like an animal
Pre emptive streke assassinate
Kill them all before itÂ´s too late 

Arming the bomb strapping it on
Time to move in for the kill
The freaks come out to play

Death scent fear is in the air
Death scent thereÂ´s blood everywhere
Death scent fear is in the air
Death scent thereÂ´s blood everywhere
