Set up, sole intention only to use
When you want out, threaten abuse
The perfect family, but it's all for show
False accusation, The lowest of the low

[Chorus:]
Betrayed. Like A Rat

Just feed them drink drugs and anything they want
The perfect mother, it all comes back to haunt
Dad's just a liar, scheming from the start
Watch your twisted world as it falls apart

[Chorus]

Liar!

[Solo]

To make them something, to relieve your guilt
Would you stop at nothing and would you even kill?
your only dynasty is, lies and scum
All you've done is taught them, evil they become
