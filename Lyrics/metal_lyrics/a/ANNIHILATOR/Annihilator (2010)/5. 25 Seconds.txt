No one to help me, I can't explain
No one to make a translation
Where do I go, What do I do
So tired and full of frustration

[Chorus:]
25 Seconds to Die
(You gave him)
25 Seconds to Die

Where is my mother, I cannot see
I break this table and chair
Whipped into frenzy, I cannot think
Why doesn't anyone care

[Chorus]

No one took the time to evaluate
No physical force, no pepper spray
Four on one with a tazer gun
Fifty thousand volts deliver pain

Convulsing, but shot again
Excessive force has been applied
No pulse, the heart has stopped
No attempt to revive

[Solo]

The fault of police, security
The YVR and immigration
The airline, travel agency
A disgrace to the nation
