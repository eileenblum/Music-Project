Dress the part, plagiarize
but you can't fake, you can't disguise
flash in the pan, make believe
sold your soul, so damn naive

[Chorus:]
Stealing from a generation
how do you sleep at night?
disgrace the institution
just a parasite

En Vogue, Pretend, Follow The Trend

Try your best, impersonate
play your part, masquerade
fool the young, play them well
counterfeit shit, is what you sell

[Chorus]

En Vogue, Pretend, Follow (Jump On) The Trend [x2]

(Hey man I think they're having a sale down at Hot Topic let's go!)

[Solo]

We bring it back, is what they say
true to the core, so what were you yesterday?
false pretense, coporate lie
ride your wave, and watch it die
