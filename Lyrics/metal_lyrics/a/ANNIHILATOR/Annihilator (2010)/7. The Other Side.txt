I thought I had it all, living the dream
The perfect union, or so it seemed
Eternal commitment, sealed with a kiss
But you said you loved me, with an open fist

[Chorus:]
The anger the rage, locked (trapped) in this cage
It happens again and again
The violence and force, denial of course
The time (cycle) has come for an end

Other Side
So Fucking Tired

So fucking tired you being told what to do
Don't need your blackmail, and I don't need you
Blood dripping from the head, hit with the phone
Again the sirens wail, and you call this home?

[Chorus]

The Other Side [x2]

[Solo]

Condition critical, you turn and run
(Run!) to another victim, continue what you've done
Violence is justified, in your twisted head
Someday someone will end up dead
