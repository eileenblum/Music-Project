[Van Halen cover]

I told her "Never in hell, no special reason"
Musta lied 'cause I ain't leavin'
We're in for a very long night
Heard a vicious rumor from your mama's tongue
You a desperate woman, need a man with a gun
High crime zone, in the city o' lights
Baby please, can't take it anymore
Ah! Baby please, can't take it anymore

I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight
And I'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze. Uh! Uh!
I hear you're lookin' for somebody to fight
Baby, don't get uptight
Baby please

Wanna see my ID? Try to clip my wings
Don't have to show you proof o' anything
I know the law, friend
At the 'leventh hour I'm goin' back outside
Ooh, give it a try. I'm your last loose end

Baby please, I can't take it anymore
Oh, baby please, I can't take it anymore

I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight
An' I'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze. Uh! Uh! Uh!
Hear you're lookin' for somebody to fight
Baby, don't get uptight
Baby please
Yeah!

[Guitar Solo]

Wow!

Oh, baby
Oh, baby
Oh, baby

Uh feel my heartbeat
Feel my heartbeat
Feel my heartbeat
Oh, yeah

Feel my heartbeat
Feel my heartbeat (Ah)
Feel my heartbeat
Feel my heartbeat
Feel my heartbeat

Baby please, I can't take it anymore. Oh!
Yeah, baby please, (Ah-ha!) I can't uh take it anymore (Wow!)
Baby please, can't take it anymore
Whoa baby please, (Yeah) I can't take it anymore. Whoa!

I'm takin' whiskey to the party tonight
An' I'm lookin' for somebody to squeeze. Uh! Oh! Ow!
Hear you're lookin' for somebody to fight
Baby, don't get uptight
Baby please, yeah!
Baby please
