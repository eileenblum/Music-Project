Convicted, a brutal act of sin
The sentence did not fit the crime
Outrage, screaming bloody murder
Released, done the time

[Chorus:]
Hey You!
Remember Me?
I am the last thing
you'll ever see

Payback, I'll make you suffer
In their name, I shall avenge
Hunted, just like an animal
The innocent shall have their revenge

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Payment due
Payment is you
Payment is due
The payment you!

Cowardly acts of violence, the ultimate betrayal
An eye for an eye, true justice will prevail

Squeal, how does it feel to you
Like a pig, down upon your knees
Scream, as I squeeze your life out
And rid the world of your disease
