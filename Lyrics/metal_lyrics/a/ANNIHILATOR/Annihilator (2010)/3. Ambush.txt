Mission, to hunt the evil down
Creeping in without a sound
Prepare for silent attack
There will be no turning back

[Chorus:]
Penetrate, Isolate, Decimate, Ambush
Silent supremacy

Stalking picking up the trail
Never retreat and never fail
Got the target move in for the kill
Take him out fire at will

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Campaign over, battle won
Supremacy second to none
Vanished, gone without a trace
Assassins for the human race
