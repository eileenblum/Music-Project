A teenage throw-away
Sleeping on the street
Addiction paradise
You cannot defeat
Each day a nightmare
Surviving, only hope
Gotta get some food to eat
Gotta get the dope

[Chorus:]
No one to help me
They don't wanna know
There's nowhere to run to
Nowhere to go

No protection from the heat
And no protection from the rain
No asylum from the freeze
Just need to kill the pain
Hiding from the bad kind,
The abuse and the rape
Given up and almost dead,
Taken all you can take

[Chorus]

[Solo]

These are forgotten children, without a choice
Slaves to a broken system, without a voice
It's time for sanctuary, give them a chance
finance a place for them to end this dance
