I'm your new religion, penetrate your mind
Focus on your weakness, victimize your kind
You can call me father,
And I can ease your pain
Giving me your deadly sins and
Take my name in vain
It's a ritual
I can take you higher and
We'll soar above the land
Trust in me, I am the savious, take my hand
Ruler of temptation, I'll satisfy your need
Supply you with the poison,
The hell on which you feed

I'm your new religion, penetrate your mind
Focus on your weakness, victimize your kind
I can take you higher and
We'll soar above the land
Trust in me, I am the saviour, take my hand
