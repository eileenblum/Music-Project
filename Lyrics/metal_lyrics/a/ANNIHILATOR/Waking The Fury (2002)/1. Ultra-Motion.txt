Pure speed in thermal overdrive
Performance always set to the hilt
Ignition, time to ignite
The ultimate machine ever built
High-octane adreanaline rush
Nothing's gonna get in my way
Time-bomb, hell-bent for destruction
There will be hell to pay

Speed and aggression, a deadly obsession
Joining together in ultra-motion
Born out of fire, they into one
We all come together in ultra-motion

Burn, electricity
Ripping through the air-ways
The direction's not an issue
It is the energy that I crave
Forces un-natural
Conquering the speed of light
Charging, invincible
I am the power and the might
Hell racer
I gotta go, I got the speed
