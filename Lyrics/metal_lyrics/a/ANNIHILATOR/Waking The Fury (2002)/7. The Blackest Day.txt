In the break of the morning,
Coming in with no warning,
Striking from the high
Like the size of a city,
Comes this mountain of stone
From a different sky
There was a torturous vision of a deadly collision,
We watched in agony
An inconceivable terror, a celestial invader,
Innocent casualties
Burning fire, screams of pain and fear
Piercing higher, hell on earth is here
Man-kind is melting, life just drains away
Darkness, death, this the blackest day
Obliteration, disintegration,
It's all turning to dust
From the force of the impact,
Humanity beginning to rust
The world begins to crumble,
It's all just a matter of time
This is the untimate chaos,
This is the end of the line
In the break of the morning,
Striking from up high
This is the ultimate chaos, this is the end
