The seeds of my life have been planted
Buried deep within
My veins are like the deepest roots,
My darkest sins
All my thoughts are cast in stone,
A castle I have built
It's walls have just begun to crack,
I am full of guilt
Over and over the nightmare never ends
I have been ripped, I have been torn
Over and under, to hell and back again
The demon deep inside re-born
The time has come for me to conquer
everlasting rage
To free me from my suffering,
Break me from my cage

I have seached deep within
down in my soul
I have found myself, myself,
I have found

A restitution for my sins
This castle I've re-built
The walls are now un-shakeable
I am free of guilt
