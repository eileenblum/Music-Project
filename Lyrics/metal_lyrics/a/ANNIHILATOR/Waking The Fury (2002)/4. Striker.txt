Waking the fury, the power, the beast
You challenge the best in the land
I'll show you no mercy, prepare for a fight
The ultimate force is at hand

Slithering into position,
Moving in for the attack
Forging ahead with precision,
Now there is no turning back
Charging ahead with conviction,
Let no one dare stand in my way
Conquering all opposition,
The battle is mine once more

Striker

Crushing opponents, I'll silence them all
With a hunger that's second to none
Intimidation is my reputation
It's over before it is done
