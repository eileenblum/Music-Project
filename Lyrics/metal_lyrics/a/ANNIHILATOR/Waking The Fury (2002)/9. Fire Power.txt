I am the war machine marching on your soul
Command and conquer, I shall take control
There won't be prisoners
Survivors of my wrath
Infernal devastation.
Prepare for the attack
Fire power
Armed and ready to roll,
The target's now in sight
Master precision,
As you crush with all your might
Scream in terror, as I breathe down your neck
Run, run the masses but your destiny is set

A pure-bred arrogance,
Nature takes it's course
Onslaught, invasion, un-holy use of force
I pleadge allegiance to rule you all
World domination is my never-ending call
