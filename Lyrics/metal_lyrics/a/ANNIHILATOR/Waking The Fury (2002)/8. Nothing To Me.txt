You really got me screaming
You got a lot of nerve
All the using and abusing
Taking what you don't deserve

So tired of the commotion
You think it's all for free
I'm just going through the motions
But you mean nothing to me

You can't slide the shit by me
I've seen it all before
Just try to push a little harder
I'll kick you right out the door

I'm getting tired of your emotions
You think the ride's for free
I'm just going through the motions
But you mean nothing to me

So you think you can ride my wind
And then dis-respect me
Well I can understand all the excitement
But get a grip on reality
