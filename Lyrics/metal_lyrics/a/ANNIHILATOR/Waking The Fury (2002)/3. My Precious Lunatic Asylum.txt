Take a trip inside
To my precious lunatic asylum
Welcome, enter the house of hell
My precious lunatic asylum
You can get anything you need
At the the precious lunatic asylum
Hang on as we take the ride
Into the precious lunatic asylum

Prepare to descend
Into my precious lunatic asylum
The ultimate insanity awaits below
In my precious lunatic asylum
Look at all the tortured souls
In the precious lunatic asylum
Here we are so let the fun begin
In my precious lunatic asylum

Gone, your mind is gone
It now belongs to me
Your mind is gone
I am insanity
