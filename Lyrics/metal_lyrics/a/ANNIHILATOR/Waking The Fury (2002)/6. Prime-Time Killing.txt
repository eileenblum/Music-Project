I rule the kingdom of the dead
Die, I'll paint the sky a bloody red
You, I now command you at my feet
Hail unto the one your can't defeat 

The killing of the soul
Losing all control 

I'll take you and break you
Destroy, annihilate you
Prime-time killing
Excite you, delight you
Welcome, I do invite you
Prime-time killing

I will now release you from your pain
Ram, slam the needle in your vein
Burn in this narcotic symphony
Die, you all shall serve unto me

I am the ruler of the street
Die until infection is complete
You lay there dying all alone
Hail unto the one you can't de-throne
