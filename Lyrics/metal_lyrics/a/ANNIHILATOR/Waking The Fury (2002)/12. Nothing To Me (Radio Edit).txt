[Bonus Track]You really got me screaming you got a lot of nerve
All the using and abusing taking what you don't deserve
So tired of the commotion you think it is all for free
I am just going through the motions but you mean nothing to me

You cannot slide the shit by me I have seen it all before
Just try to push a little harder I will kick you right out the door
I am getting tired of your emotions you think the ride is for free
I am just going through the motions but you mean nothing to me

So you think you can ride my wind and then disrespect me
Well I can understand all the excitement but get a grip on reality
So tired of the commotion you think it is all for free
I am just going through the motions but you mean nothing to me
