I am the one that has chosen to lead,
The power that grows within me
A force that has come to inherit the earth
My calling
A time and a place for sadistic intent,
I know for when you will bleed
Saving your life is beyond your control,
Wait for my eternal greed
Shortage of time, you are next,
Prepare to die
Power grows in my, look to my supremacy
Force fed in line, death-row,
Prepare to die
Cold-blooded murderer,
Strengthened by the massacre
Destroying the lives of the ones I forsake,
Scour the earth as I take
Searching to quench, thirst of my soul,
It hungers
Cauldrons of blood filing up in the rim,
Enemies die by my hand
Feeding is done, nothing left but the bones,
Left to rot and turn to sand
Building up the walls of the kingdom
Building up the walls of the king
Stronger I grow as I suck out your life,
Pleading as I watch you kneel
Abduction of strength,
I am now in command, I rule
Cities of flesh lay in my path,
Watch as the innocent die
My nation is built from
The souls of the dead,
Born of life to terrify
