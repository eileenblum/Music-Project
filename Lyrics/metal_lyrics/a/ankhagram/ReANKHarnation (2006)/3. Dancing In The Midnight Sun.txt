There was a time when I could see 
Dancing in the midnight sun
When I could breathe by virgin air of my life

But now my soul is dead
Now all another in my head
Wounded heart
Wounded life
But I still hope to see sometime... 

...Dancing in the midnight sun
I wait for you there...
It is so unfair...

Dancing in the midnight sun
I wait for you there...
It is so unfair

To me
