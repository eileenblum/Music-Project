What do you feel
When I have said, that I dying
What do you say
When my heart dies and cries

What you will think
When I'll say that I love you...

You will forget about me...

Yes, I am sure.
I am sure in your indifference.
I know that you will think
When I'll say that I love you

What do you feel
When I have said, that I dying.
What do you say
When my heart dies and cries

You will forget about me...
