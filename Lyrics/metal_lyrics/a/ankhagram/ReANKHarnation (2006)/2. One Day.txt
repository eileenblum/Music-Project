One my life as if one day.
One night and one hundred ways to death...
One lie and one reason for escape from this cruelty world...

Nobody can not will stop me
Nobody will not miss me 
Nobody will not come to my tomb

The loneliness is a reflection of my dirty wounded soul
One day in this life of silence...
As if heavens fall

Nobody can not will stop me
Nobody will not miss me 
Nobody will not come to my tomb
