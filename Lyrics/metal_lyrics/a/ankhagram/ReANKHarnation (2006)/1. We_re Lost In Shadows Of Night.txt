And again...
And again...
... We were lost in shadows of night
And often we cry...
All this time we went to death
And now we came to this
The ending is so close
But we were lost in shadows...

We were lost in shadows of night
And how much we not fight
We'll die alone in our world
And it wholly our fault

The fear of loneliness makes death more painfully
The ending is so close
But we were lost in shadows...

We were lost in shadows of night
And how much we not fight
We'll die alone in our world
And it wholly our fault

We were lost in shadows of night
And how much we not fight
We'll die alone in our world
And it wholly our fault
