In dark autumn night
I paralysed in my mind...
Eternal spilling rain...
Cold autumn days

Cold waves of autumn grief
Flow from the lonely sea
The wind brings a smell of death
And spirit of loneliness

...Dark autumn night...
...Rainy autumn sky...
...It is high time to cry...
...It is high time to die...
