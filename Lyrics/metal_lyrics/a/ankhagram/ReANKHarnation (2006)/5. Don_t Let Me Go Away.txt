Your cruelty does not know borders...
Your heart burns by the cold...
Yours angelic face draws others...
Let me tell you, please, don't let me go away...

Don't let me go away
Don't let me go away

Don't let me go away
Don't let me go away
It's not too late
cause my last way it my grave

You were last string, which held me in this world...
You have refused my free heart...
Now I have remained alone with my pain
Let me tell you, please, don't let me go away...

Don't let me go away
Don't let me go away
It's not too late
cause my last way it my grave

Don't let me go away
Don't let me go away
It's not too late
cause my last way it my grave
