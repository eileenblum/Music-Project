I, I want to die
To die in darkness of night and light of the moon.
I always searched and waited for you but my desire nothing means.

All these years in search
I waste my time

All these empty tears...
All the same I die

I, I want to die
To die in darkness of night and light of the moon.
I always searched and waited for you but my desire nothing means.
