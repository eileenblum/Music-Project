He lived in home
....Nobody has come to him
He lived alone
....Alone in his dreams and his fears

The life was empty and silent
Lonely as if the moon
He silently cried looking on the dark sky
And wanted to die

The people were souless 
....To him and to his life
He lived in loneliness
....Nobody gave him by love

His life was empty and silent
Deprived of any hopes
He silently cried looking on the dark sky
And wanted to die

He is buried alone
In cold grave
....Nobody came
He has found rest
From a pain and loneliness...
