I have got used to all...
To feelings that were at me,
To emotions which were gone
In a haze and oblivion

In me emptiness
And grief about the lost
Waves of my heart...
Life's ocean...

In it all has drowned,
That was my dear to heart...
The childhood... Such kind...
I've not forgotten it...

Has not forgotten, as loved, was afraid
As life enjoyed...

And has not see, how it began to drown
To disappear...
Madness...
