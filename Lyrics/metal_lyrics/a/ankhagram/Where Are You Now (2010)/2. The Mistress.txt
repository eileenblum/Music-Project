I thought that I live...
I saw light, a shade, hatred, love.
I felt it
Was live, and thought that really.

Everything that was close to me - 
It already is not present.
Life has disappeared, was gone.

I've understood that I still had only death,
My death, and I its carrier.
The mistress of soul. Thoughts.

I damn that hour that was my birth,
That hour which has given birth to my death.
