I look at you from ...
And I see oblivion, emptiness...
What with you became?
Where you now?

I cannot leave you such...
Where the real you?
Where you now?

You loved life which has betrayed you.
It has made of you a shade.
Shade you.

You were full of feelings,
Different, bright.
They are not present.
Where they now?

All real, now only a dream,
Nightmare, suffering.
You siluet has disappeared, was gone...
I know, where you now...
