[2006 "When The Shadows Die" Single Track]Walk along the street
Hundreds usual people
Whom I can be?
The feelings will prompt me
I wanna be lonely
I wanna be a secret
I wanna be dead
I falling in darkness
I falling in a hell
I falling in gothic
My feelings is well
People do not understand me
I not from their world
Their eyes from a glass
But my heart from a cold
My life is a grief
The life is filled by fear
I spill many tears
And sufferings
I falling in darkness
I falling in a hell
I falling in gothic
My feelings is well
I am so lonely in this world
I can not live in loneliness
What if I should die?
I falling in darkness
I falling in a hell
I falling in gothic
My feelings is well
I falling in darkness
I falling in a hell
I falling in gothic
My feelings is well
