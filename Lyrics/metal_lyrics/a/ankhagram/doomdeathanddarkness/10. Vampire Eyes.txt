... so deep and dark,
Shine in night...
Your vampire eyes...

... so bright like fire
Never cry...
Your vampire eyes...

They inspire fear
But so fascinate...
They shout about the pain
And want to die

... so deep and dark,
Shine in night...
Your vampire eyes...

... so bright like fire
Never cry...
Your vampire eyes...

They cold like ice
But burn like a flame
They force to fly
But bring to me a pain

... so deep and dark,
Shine in night...
Your vampire eyes...

... so bright like fire
Never cry...
Your vampire eyes...

Hungry and passionate
Malicious and perfect
Angry and beautiful
Sweet and horrifying
Lonely and hot as the sun
Sexual and erotic
Painful and womanly

Divine and devil
Paradise and infernal
Doomed but never crying
Lovely and wishing to die
Immortal and weak
Are afraid of day time light
Dreaming to fly so high

... so deep and dark,
Shine in night...
Your vampire eyes...

... so bright like fire
Never cry...
Your vampire eyes...
