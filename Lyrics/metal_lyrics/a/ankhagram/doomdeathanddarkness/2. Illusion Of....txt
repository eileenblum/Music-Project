Inside...
Inside my heart begins illusion of love and I lust 
of ressurection of my soul 
Destruction.... 
The destruction approaches to me and soon I will see 

My broken heart
My empty hope
Mine wasting time
And I die

Inside...
Inside my heart a pain
And millions voises will not whisper my fucking name

Inside...
Inside my heart begins illusion of love and I lust 
of ressurection of my soul 
Destruction.... 
The destruction approaches to me and soon I will see 

My broken heart
My empty hope
Mine wasting time
And I die
