Throne of grief
... sadness of dawn
Kingdom of darkness
... Oceans of forgotten hopes
Lonely voices sing the sad songs.
where is that kingdom?
where is my home...

This place, where the rivers flow from blood and tears
This place, where the moon shines more brightly than sun
This place, where dark night is longer than day
This place so far away

This place, where the black birds never sing
This place, where the pleasure brings sufferings
This place, where pours an eternal rain
This place of an eternal pain

Fields of black flowers
... Rich fog above the river
Kingdom of darkness
... One believer
Millions voices whisper my name
Where this kingdom?
Where is same?

This place, where the silent shadows never die
This place, where the lonely people never cry
This place, where are not afraid to be alone
This place always will be unknown

This place, where the spirits dance
This place, where the phantoms make the perfect graceful ritual
Dedication in a kingdom where at last believers find long-awaited freedom

Throne of grief
... sadness of dawn
Kingdom of darkness
... Oceans of forgotten hopes
Lonely voices sing the sad songs.
where is that kingdom?
where is my home...

Fields of black flowers
... Rich fog above the river
Kingdom of darkness
... One believer
Millions voices whisper my name
Where this kingdom?
Where is same?
