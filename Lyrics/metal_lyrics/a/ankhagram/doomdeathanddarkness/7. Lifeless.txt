And it's only rain...
... Last rain in my life
And it's only tears...
... Spilling from the sky...

Please, tell me, why I so lifeless!
Please, tell me, why I so dead!

And I still remember...
The memory keeps my pain...
And I still here,
But I want run away.

Please, tell me, why I so lifeless!
Please, tell me, why I so dead!

... To wake up and 
To be alone...
... To fall asleep and
To be in my world...
... To wake up and
To be alive...
... To fall asleep and
Never to wake up in fucking life!

Please, tell me, why I so lifeless!
Please, tell me, why I so dead!
