Tell me, what are you think
What are you see
What are you feel to me
It's not too late...

One step to hate
It's one step to hate
I wanna something say
It's one step to hate

Tell me, what are you do
What are you feel 
What are want for me
It's not too late...

One step to hate
It's one step to hate
I wanna something say
It's one step to hate
It's one step to hate
I wanna something say
It's one step to hate

Tell me, why you ready to die
Tell me, why you ready to feel my pain
Why you ready run out from this world
Now it's too late...

One step to hate
It's one step to hate
I wanna something say
It's one step to hate
