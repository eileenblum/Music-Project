I stand at a cold old window. 
On empty streets pours a rain. 
The emptiness in my heart gives rise to a wild pain. 
But now is does not matter.

Does not matter that I hope and I want love.
Does not matter that my hopes doomed on destruction.

I always look in my reflection in a mirror.
It seems to me so lifeless...
I on the way to suicide...

Last time I stand at a cold old window. An empty street as if my heart....

Nobody can keep me alive. 
Too late for excuses.
