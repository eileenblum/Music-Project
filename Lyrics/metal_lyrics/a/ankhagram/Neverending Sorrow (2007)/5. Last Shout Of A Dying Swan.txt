Soaring in heavens, dark as night...
Flying in dreams, as if an angel...
Raped by own life,
Falling in a chasm of hopes.
... Last shout of a dying swan...

Crying in emptiness and despair...
Spilling dark tears of the wounded soul...
Betraid by own life
Falling in a chasm of hopes.
... Last shout of a dying swan...

Disappointed in this life..
Dreaming to find rest...
With a cold sight and dead heart..
Looking own death...

Not knowing rest
Not felt caress,
Sleepless nights looking the death..
With a cold sight 
Dreaming to find rest...
Looking own death...

Soaring in heavens, dark as night...
Flying in dreams, as if an angel...
Raped by own life,
Falling in a chasm of hopes.
... Last shout of a dying swan...

Crying in emptiness and despair...
Spilling dark tears of the wounded soul...
Betraid by own life
Falling in a chasm of hopes.
... Last shout of a dying swan...

Died in loneliness
Not knowing rest
Not felt caress, in an empty life.
Flied in dreams
Fallen in a chasm of hopes.
... Last shout of a dying swan...
