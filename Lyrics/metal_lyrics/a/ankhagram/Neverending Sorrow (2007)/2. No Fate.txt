I wait for my death...
I am hidden from myself...
So coldly to live in emptiness...
Death already close to me...
... So it is close to me...

I do not have present
I do not have future
There is only a past
Which has died

I am lost in this life
I live in sorrow
Only one way is open
It's my suicide

I do not have present
I do not have future
There is only a past
Which has died

So it is much lost 
In my senseless life
There is only
