I don't wanna talk about the things
We've gone through
Though it's hurting me now it's history
I've played all my cards and that's what
You've done too
Nothing more to say no more ace to play

The winner takes it all
The looser standing small
Beside the victory
That's her destiny

I was in your arms thinking I belonged there
I figured it made sense building me a fence
Building me a home thinking I'd be strong there
But I was a fool playing by the rules

The gods made throw a dice their minds
As cold as ice
And someone way down here looses
Someone dear

The winner takes it all
The looser has to fall
It's simple and it's plain
Why should I complain

But tell me does she kiss like i used to kiss you?
Does it feel the same when she calls your name
Somewhere deep inside you must know I miss you
But what can I say rules must be obeyed

The judges will decide the like of me abide
Spectators of the show always staying low
The game is on again a lover or a friend
A big thing or a small the winners takes it all

I don't wanna talk if it makes you feel sad
And I understand you've come to shake my hand
I apologize if it makes you feel bad
Seeing me so tense no self-confidence
But you see
The winner takes it all
The winner takes it all...
