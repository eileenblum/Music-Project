Chasing the evil
Is like chasing a dream
Haunting the bad
Is like a poem with no theme
Race with no end
Fight you can?t win
Try to defend
Or you'll pay for your sins

Darkness has come
Spreading it's wings
But you're the chosen to lose or to win

Chasing a dragon
That's the war of your life
Eye of the eagle
That cuts like a knife

Sharp like a razor
To tear down the bad
The force will be with you
When you fighting like mad

That's why call you the DRAGONCHASER
Call you the DRAGONCHASER

You cover your skin
With the blood of your victim
But the leaf of an oak
Leaves woundable spot

The blood that you bleed
Is liquid as steel
The wounds that you cause
Will never heal

Chasing a dragon
That's the war of your life
Eye of the eagle
That cuts like a knife

Sharp like a razor
To tear down the bad
The force will be with you
When you fighting like mad

[Chorus]
