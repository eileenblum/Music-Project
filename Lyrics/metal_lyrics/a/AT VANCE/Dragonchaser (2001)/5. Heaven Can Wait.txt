My heart is empty
And my soul stone cold
Ages have past
Since I've been told
What's right or wrong
What to win or loose
I've lost my view
And I've paid my deuce

So know I'm fighting all alone
I'm on my knees
I'm down to the bone
You're nowhere near
You're out of reach
I've lost my words
I've lost my speech

But I'm surrounded
By walls of hate
And my loves trades into fear
But
HEAVEN CAN WAIT

There's no direction
No guiding light
I'm running blinded
Straight into the night
I loose my balance
And I'm failing my goals
Right into nowhere
Won't you lend me your hand

So know I'm fighting all alone
I'm on my knees
I'm down to the bone
You're nowhere near
You're out of reach
I've lost my words
I've lost my speech

But I'm surrounded
By walls of hate
And my loves trades into fear
But
HEAVEN CAN WAIT
