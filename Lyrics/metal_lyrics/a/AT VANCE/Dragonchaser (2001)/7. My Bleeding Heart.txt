Now all that is left
Are these broken pieces of my life
And I'm asking myself
Was it all worth it
Were I was wrong
What was my mistake
I gave you all I had (to give)
But your love was just a fake

Can't you see
What you've done to me
You took all of me
But you didn't answer my call
You never knew me at all

[Chorus:]
My bleeding heart
Will tell you
All the pain you've caused
You've torn me apart
And my soul is crying
To bring back our love

Maybe you thought
That nothing in this could
Bring me down
But the truth is here for you
Cause my heart's not made of stone
I'm not the man
That I used to be
You toughed me
What sadness means to me

What you see
Is what you've done to me
You just took my heart away
But I couldn't make you see
I could not make you stay

[Chorus]
