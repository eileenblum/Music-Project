You still believe that you are innocent
But all the pain you've caused will never end
You're like a demon and I'm under your spell

You promised the god
But you gave me the bad
And now you're alone
'cause I'm gone

[Chorus:]
Did you ever save your tears
And did you fight against your fears
Then would know the reason why
My love for you has died

Did you ever try to see
Then you would still believe in me
But it's time to face the truth
That it's too late for love

So now you're crawling to me on your knees
I cant forgive you can't fullfill your needs
I'll never trust in you again

You promised the good
But all you gave me was bad
So now you're alone
And I'm forever gone

[Chorus]

Too late
Too late

[Solo]

[Chorus]
