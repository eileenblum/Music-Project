Raising like brothers
Sharing their dreams
Feeling protested
(but) it's not like it seemed

Jealousy grew
As time went on by
Nobody knew
That their love was a lie

Unspoken hate
Tor them apart
They had to wait
The fight couldn't start

Slaved by their descent
Unable to solve
Searching the reason
Searching the truth

Destiny paid it's dues
And they have nothing left to loose

(so they) both build a kingdom
Reigning different worlds
They were like
FIRE AND ICE

One have the poverty
One lived in luxury

They ruled
HEAVEN AND HELL

Both ruled their nation
With power and strength
Darkshaded warriors
Waiting to strike
Like vultures who circle
On the top of their victims
Patient they are waiting
'til their time has come

Tagedy took it's all
And the winner took it all

[Chorus]
