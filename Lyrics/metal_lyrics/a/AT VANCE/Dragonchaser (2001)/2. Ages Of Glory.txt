Peaceful they lived
In a world without war
Everything seemed to be clear
Riders approaching
Raming all down
Bringing them sadness and tears

Nothing was left
And all was gone
So they had to start their war

Ages of glory
So tells the story
They couldn't win
Because that were born to loose

Kingdom of madness
Filled with their sadness
They were (the) chosen
To give their life away

Nobody argued
Nobody talked
They had their weapons to speak
Fields stained with blood
The battle was done
And the tears just melt in the sand

They lit a light
For those who had gone
They all knew
It was sad but true

[Solo]

[Chorus]
