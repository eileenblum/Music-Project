Heading towards your wildest dreams
But you don't reach the end
You'll be on a never ending journey in this land
Time will tell if it's worth to carry on
Until the day of truth you'll be the lonely one

It's a race you can't win
A fight with no end
But where are you now

Open your eyes
Take away these lies
Cause you have been alone too long
Caught in your dreams

Fly to the rainbow
Unbreak the darkness around you
Out of the black bow
Into the light that surrounds you

...out of the dark into the light

You keep on searching for the answers
You may never find
Until you learn to face the truth
You try to leave behind
You won't see until the day you'll learn
To turn around and try to cross
The bridges that you've burned

It's a race you can't win
A fight without end
But where are you now

Open your eyes
Take away these lies
Cause you have been alone too long
Caught in your dreams

Fly to the rainbow
Unbreak the darkness around you
Out of the black bow
Into the light that surrounds you

...It's a race you can't win...
