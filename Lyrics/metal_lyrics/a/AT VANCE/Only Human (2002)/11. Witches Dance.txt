Moon is arising the night is to come
Dancing with fire ' til their work is done
Praying to evil ignoring their gods
Lord of the darkness is waiting to come

Pray to the moon
Read from the runes
They have given their souls to the dark

Dancing with fire
Is their only desire
They will keep on
Dancing the witches dance
Ruling their nation
Of desperation
They will keep on
Dancing the witches dance

Demons and wizards are ruling their thoughts
Whispering spells that they have been taught
A candle is burning for every sin
For every soul they took with a grin

They hide from the sun
'Til daylight is gone
And when the night comes you will see the sparks

Dancing with fire...
