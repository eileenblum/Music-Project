Somewhere beyond
In the dark there's a light
Taking my fears
And my dreams out of sight
Gives me the power
And the will to survive this fight

I've travelled for ages
In search of the truth
Thousand of pages
Have paid off their dues
But they can't tell
What i am longing for

And when the dawn of the victory
Is rising with dignity
And then i'll know where to go

Take me away
Into infinity
I just cant stay
Realese my tragedy
And i swear
That i'll take more than i can bear
So take me away

Deep down my soul
There's a fire that burns
I won't hesitate
I'll always return
surrendering all of the duties
That i was chosen for

I've conquered it all
And so what is the price
I bag for delieverence
Now that i'm wise
Why don't you ease my pain
And free my soul

So i'm laying my weapons down
Do i deserve the crown
Cause i'm here to take my place

Take me away.......
