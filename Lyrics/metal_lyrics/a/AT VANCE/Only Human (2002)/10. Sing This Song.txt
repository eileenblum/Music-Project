Do you believe in honesty
You'll have to find your desteny
There may be times when things go wrong
You're gonna win if you are strong

So many boundaries to break
A million tasks you'll have to take
The road that leads you there is long
But in the end you'll be the one

Just raise your voice and sing

Sing this song
THEN  You'll be the one
WHO  Takes the victory
Take your time
AND  Try to hold the line
THEN  You will get it all

The years of innocence are gone
You've gotta show where you belong
You know what's wrong and what is right
Just force your goals and hold on tight

There'll be no mountain that's too high
You'll never fail so won't you try
The battle only just begun
And if you win you'll be the one

So let me hear your voice

Sing this song
THEN  You'll be the one
WHO  Takes the victory
Take your time
AND  Try to hold the line
THEN  You will get it all
