There's a river dark and deep
Holding visions you can't keep
But the water flows too slow
Where it end you'll never know

Like a clock that's spinning round
Only ticking is the sound
Like an endless wheel of fortune
And you're losing the ground

And it seems
There's never an end
And all your dreams fade into nowehereland

And you're lost between time
And your live ain't worth a dime
When you're crossing the line
And your lifelight stops to shine

As you walk right thru the boarder
Between dead or alive
Prisoners from over yonder
Daring to strive

Like a touch without a soul
And an aim without a goal
So you try to break away
But they force you to stay

And you know
That chances have passed
Water Flows
But this moment won't last

And you're lost between time
And your live ain't worth a dime
When youAre crossing the line
And your lifelight stops to shine

(... time will never turn forever )
