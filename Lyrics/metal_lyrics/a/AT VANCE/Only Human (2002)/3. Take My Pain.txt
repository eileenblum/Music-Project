I can feel the heat
as it burns my skin
can you hear my creed
I'm paying for my sins
Rainy days and sleepless nights
I've been thru it all
Watch me now as i fall
Can't you hear my call

You have gone away
I could not make you stay
And all that is left is

P A I N - Release me
P R I D E - Don't tease me
S H A M E - Why don't you take away my pain

The chances that i've dared to take
Couldn't pay their dues
The words i've said the good and the bad
Why did you refuse
Now i'm here all by myself
You coldn't bring me down
Watch me now i'm ten feet tall
There goes out my call

You have gone away
There's nothing left to say
All that is left is

P A I N - Release me
P R I D E - Don't tease me
S H A M E - Why don't you take away my pain

So tell me why did you leave me
Where was i wrong
Tell me why did you break my heart
What was the reason

P A I N - Release me
P R I D E  - Don't tease me
S H A M E  - Why don't you take away my pain
