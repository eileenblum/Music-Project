[Japan Bonus]

Risin' up
Back on the street
Did my time took my chances.
Went the distance. Now I'm back on my feet
Just a man and his will to survive.
So many times it happens too fast.
You trade your passion for glory
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past.
You must fight just to keep them alive.
It's the eye of the tiger. It's the thrill of the fight
Risin' up to the challenge of our rival.
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
And he's watchin' us all with the eye of the tiger.
Face to face
Out in the heat
Hangin' tough
Stayin' hungry.
They stack the odds
Still we take to the street .
For the kill with the will to survive.
It's the eye of the tiger. . . .
Risin' up
Straight to the top.
Had the guts
Got the glory.
Went the distance.
Now I'm not gonna stop
Just a man and his will to survive.
It's the eye of the tiger. . . .
The eye of the tiger
Eye of the tiger
Eye of the tiger.
