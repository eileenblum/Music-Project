Once upon a time he was born into a family
Growing with the right to fight
When he became a man he felt the strong desire
To satisfy his restless soul

Heading for tomorrow he followed up his heart
But the only thing he found was war and hate
So he took all of his pride and started his adventure
Towards foreign countries into no man's land

Disbelieve could not make him strong enough
Always on his neverending search for the truth

Friends he could not find
Hate and fear was all he got
Still he is on his way

Sailing on the seven seas
Searchin for my destiny
Travelling all around the world
Always on his lonely search
For the truth

So the years passed by and he became more wise
Knowing all about the uncovered mysteries
By the time he realized that he's been running 'round in circles
Didn't care for the things that he should have kept

Disbelieve could not make him strong enough
Always on his neverending search for the truth

Friends he could not find
Hate and fear was all he got
Still he is on his way

Sailing on the seven seas
Searchin for my destiny
Travelling all around the world
Still can't find the truth in me

[Solo]

Friends he could not find
Hate and fear was all he got
Still he is on his way

Sailing on the seven seas
Searchin for my destiny
Travelling all around the world
Still can't find the truth in me
Far beyond the distant sky
Nowhere near but he couldn't denie
Heading towards his wildest dreams
Always on his lonely search
For the truth.......
