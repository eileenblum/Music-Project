You know I've always tried
To keep all of your dreams satisfied
But still there's one thing I denie
To give my heart for you and die
And thou you give me a reason to live
There's so much more to give
It hurts so much this kind of human touch
That touch too much

You're drinking my blood
And you're eating my soul
You're not healing my wounds
I can't believe that this is your goal

Because I die in your arms
But your eyes still look the same to me
Blinded by your charms
Cause you're my beloved enemy

Yes, I die in your arms

The words you said the things you did
Are driving me insane
I just can't take my hands from you
The pain remains the same
It seems to be my worsed mistake
To love you more than I could take
Oh, tell me will I ever learn
A touch that never stops to burn

You're drinking my blood
And you're eating my soul
You're not healing my wounds
I can't believe that this is your goal

Because I die in your arms
But your eyes still look the same to me
Blinded by your charms
Cause you're my beloved enemy
Yes I die in your arms
But your eyes still look the same to me
Blinded by your charms
Cause you're my beloved enemy

Yes, I die in your arms

[Solo]

Because I die in your arms
But your eyes still look the same to me
Blinded by your charms
Cause you're my beloved enemy
Yes I die in your arms
But your eyes still look the same to me
Blinded by your charms
Cause you're my beloved enemy
