Can you imagine
To live your live
Without fear
No pain just pleasure
No attack
From the rear

Keep on believing
In the things that you can't see
You'll be deceiving
The crown amongst your enemy's
And in the end
Your dreams will come true
Just put your fears aside
And try

So we sing this song
That makes us feel strong
We will unite in our kingdom
In our hearts we believe
That the strong will survive
Power and glory f o r e v e r [2x]

In times of darkness
When fear and anger rules the world
There's only sadness
That causes pain and makes you cry

Don't stop believing
Only you can find the way
You'll be receiving
The key to your destiny
And in the end
Your dreams will come true
Just put your fears aside
And try

So we sing this song
That makes us feel strong
We will unite in our kingdom
In our hearts we believe
That the strong will survive
Power and glory f o r e v e r ....... [ to be continued ]
