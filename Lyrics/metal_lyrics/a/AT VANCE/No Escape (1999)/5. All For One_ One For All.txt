A thousand miles away from home
It seems that all your dreams and hopes are gone
You're at the point of no return
Oh, tell me will you ever learn

Can't you see that we all belong together
Only we stay strong forever

All for one and one for all
We stand and fight, we'll never fall
Raise your voice and try to sing this song
All for one

Too far away to bridge the distance
You're growing weak, you need resistance
You're standing out there in the cold
You're all alone, you don't know where to go

Can't you see that we all belong together
Only we stay strong forever

All for one and one for all
We stand and fight, we'll never fall
Raise your voice and try to sing this song
All for one, all for one
