[Japan Bonus]

Shout shout!
Let it all out!
These are the things I can do without.
Come on
I'm talking to you
come on!
Shout shout!
Let it all out! . . .

In violent times - you shouldn't have to sell your soul.
In black and white - they really
really ought to know.
Those one track minds that took you for a working boy
Kiss them good-bye. You shouldn't have to jump for joy
You shouldn't have to jump for joy.

Shout shout!
Let it all out! . . .

They gave you life
and in return you gave them hell as cold as ice.
I hope we live to tell the tale
I hope we live to tell the tale.

Shout shout!
Let it all out! . . .
Shout shout!
Let it all out! . . .
Shout shout!
Let it all out! . . .

And when you've taken down your guard
if I could change your mind
I'd really love to break your heart
I'd really love to break your heart.

Shout shout!
Let it all out! . . .
Shout shout!
Let it all out! . . .
Shout shout!
Let it all out! . . .
Shout shout!
Let it all out! . . .
