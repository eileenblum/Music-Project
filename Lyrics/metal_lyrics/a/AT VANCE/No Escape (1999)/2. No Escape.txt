When you're caught up in darkness
You're searchin for life
And you reach out for every ray that's inside

You're diggin the dirt for some pieces of gold
Remember what you have been told
When you trying to find it there
Out in the cold

There is no escape
There is no escape

So you're trying to hide where the streets have no name
But whereever you look you see faces of shame

Addicted to madness they burn kill and die
Selling there souls for a lie
Then they pray for forgiveness
They fall down and cry

There is no escape
There is no escape

You've got to open up your eyes and see reality
That you can run but you just can't break free

[Solo]

There is no escape
There is no escape
