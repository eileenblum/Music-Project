You never see what's inside of me
That's why you won't face the truth
Fighting forever a fight you can't win
Touching my soul ain't like touching my skin

Open your mind don't you ever slow down
Spread out your wings and reach out for the crown

It's not made out of gold
Cause it's the crown of thorns
Not made for human soul
Ashes to ashes
Thats where it ends
Nobody could get more far beyond

Flying high I can see the years pass by
And I won't return to the same old places
That I've been before
Is it still the same old face
I can see no more
O' see no more

Out in the gutter like a fox on the run
Everone's after your dreams
So did you learn your lesson well
If you did not they will send you to hell

Inside your heart you will never forget
How things went wrong and made you feel so sad
But the path is to small noone's gonna hear your call
As you wander by yourself

Ashes to ashes
Thats where it ends
Nobody could get more far beyond

Flying high I can see the years pass by
And I won't return to the same old places
That I've been before
Is it still the same old face
I can see no more
O' see no more

[Solo]

Flying high....
