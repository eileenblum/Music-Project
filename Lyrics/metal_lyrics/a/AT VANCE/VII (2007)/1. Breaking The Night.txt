Lying awake watching the pale white moon
Darkness and silence still cover my dreams
And I can't get nowhere near
Do these pieces go together at all

Face the fear, can't you hear
Voices are calling, but no one's here
Waste no tear screaming the night to break free

Before the dawn night spread their velvet wings
Don't be afraid morning will come for you
Breaking the night with the sun

But even you know illusions can fool your mind
Daring to see what is behind the mask
So what's on the other side
All these faces keep their eyes on you

Face the fear, can't you hear
Voices are calling, but no one's here
Waste no tear screaming the night to break free

Before the dawn night spread their velvet wings
Don't be afraid morning will come for you
Breaking the night with the sun
