I can't get a hold of all of these thoughts
They just keep running into my mind
Surrounded by dreams, closer than it seems
They just take me away

On and on, heading for your call

Shine - Break the night with fire, open up the sky
Burn - Light a candle so that I can find my way
Holding our world in your hand
Live - Living for the moment, don't live day by day
Truth - Face yourself and don't you try to run away
Taken our dream to eternity

Hiding the mask, never to be found
Freeing your soul from the ground
As I move on tryin' to get where I belong
Dyin' to find my way

On and on, tryin' to get it all

Shine - Break the night with fire, open up the sky
Burn - Light a candle so that I can find my way
Holding our world in your hand
Live - Living for the moment, don't live day by day
Truth - Face yourself and don't you try to run away
Taken our dream to eternity
