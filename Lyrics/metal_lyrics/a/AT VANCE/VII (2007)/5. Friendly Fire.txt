They were young at heart
Wild and free
Faith was their belief
To kill their enemies
They were marching on and on

Together as one, unite to be strong
Heading where they belong

They were crossing the field
With a gun in their hand
Raisin' their shields
As they walk across the land
Now and forever

They were born to fall, for the sake of war
Heading towards the call

One for all and all for one
Friendly fire has taken them all

Come on

I just run without directions
Hours feel like days
I've been hunting like a madman
Blindly in the haze
For my God and country

Together as one, unite to be strong
Heading where they belong

Burning all my bridges
Just can't find my way out
My life is torn in pieces
I just I just gotta shout
For my God and country

They were born to fall, for the sake of war
Heading towards the call

One for all and all for one
Friendly fire has taken them all
