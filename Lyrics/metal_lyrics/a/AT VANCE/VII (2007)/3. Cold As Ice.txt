I saw many faces as I turn these pages
But I don't know where we went wrong
Tell me now what I can do, I'm saving all my prayers for you
We both know that we can turn the wheels of time

You're cold as ice, I've seen your eyes
And you never try to tell me lies

You know that I'll never take less than forever
Why won't you stay, what can I say
Don't you make a fool of me, show me all so I can see
We're just friends but I can't take your lies again

You're cold as ice, you've rolled the dice
And you never try to tell me lies

Through the eyes of darkness I can't see the light
Standing tall against the rain that I will fight
Never share the secrets leading to your soul
Behind the mask of wisdom lies a big black hole

You're cold as ice, I've seen your eyes
And you never try to tell me lies
You're cold as ice, you've rolled the dice
And you never try to tell me lies
