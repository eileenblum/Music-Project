Who do you think are you going to be
What will you do, can't you answer me
Winter or summer I will take the fame
From chaos to mayhem and you are to blame

Can you enlighten the dark
Do your words tell the truth
Do we share the same point of view
So why is your face full of doubt... tell me the truth

Who will take the victory
Into his heart and his soul
Tell me who wants to live

Who gave you the right to just point and decide
Who's gonna live on the other side

Choosing this life to be free out of hell
Running and fighting till I hear the bell
Winter or summer I will take the fame
From chaos to mayhem and you are to blame

Can you enlighten the dark
Do your words tell the truth
Do we share the same point of view
So why is your face full of doubt... tell me the truth

Who will take the victory
Into his heart and his soul
Tell me who wants to live

Who gave you the right to just point and decide
Who's gonna live on the other side
