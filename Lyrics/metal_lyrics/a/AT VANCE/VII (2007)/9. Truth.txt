Run away, dry a tear, tel a lie, I'll be listening
Hunting high, you and I, take a ride, into forever

I can see what you're thinking
So don't you try to convince me

Can you feel all the strength that's in your heart
Speak the truth and you'll never fall apart

LIE, and all your wishes come true
TRUTH, at the edge of extinction
SCREAM, and they always remember

I believe, you'll see, just a game, that I'm playing
Never die, don't you cry, there will be no more sorrow

No one knows what you're seeing
So I will forever believe you

Can you feel all the strength that's in your heart
Speak the truth and you'll never fall apart

LIE, and all your wishes come true
TRUTH, at the edge of extinction
SCREAM, and they always remember
LIE, and all your wishes come true
