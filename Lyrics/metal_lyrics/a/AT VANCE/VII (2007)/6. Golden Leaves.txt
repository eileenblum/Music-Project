Don't you remember that seasons may change
Did you forget 'bout the summer's joy
Where's all the power an' where is the strength
This ain't a road with no end
...Keep on tearing down these walls
To reveal all your hopes and your dreams

Summer's dream is gone with the wind
Pages will turn and time still moves on
But you have to believe what the future will bring

And when those golden leaves are fallin' down
They carry all your dreams and hopes
For pride and glory
And when you see those fields in autumn burnin'
If fills your heart with sorrow
And you can't escape from here

Winter is coming, so prepare your mind
You can't imagine what cold will destroy
Weaker and weaker it comes from behind
So there's no way in your life for you to survive
And reveal all your hopes and your dreams

Summer's dream is gone with the wind
Pages will turn and time still moves on
But you have to believe what the future will bring

And when those golden leaves are fallin' down
They carry all your dreams and hopes
For pride and glory
And when you see those fields in autumn burnin'
If fills your heart with sorrow
And you can't escape from here
