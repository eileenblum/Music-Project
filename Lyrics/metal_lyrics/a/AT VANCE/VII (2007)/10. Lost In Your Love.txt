The summer breeze in your hair
It seems to be so warm and tender
Is your love really true
That it can't stand anything

Where we gotta go through
Then I'll send my love to you

Through the dark and the night
Through the day and the light
I will hold you forever
Anywhere that you go
I would share all my dreams
But it seems that you don't understand

That I am lost in your love
Cause you
Came like a force from above
So I will open my heart
Won't you try
Try to make a new start

But times may change as they say
But my love for you is far beyond their range
Nobody's with me and as I'm on my way
Watchin' the waves in the sea, searchin' for my destiny
