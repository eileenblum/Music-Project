Though your blood runs through my veins
I have a hard time to play this game
You have seen me fall before
I still need you to let me go

Shivers the spine when I'm alive
Shivers the spine when I die

Please don't leave me all alone
I have love that I've never shown
All those years I lived in vain
Please don't force me through all this pain

Why can't life be fair - War is in the air
I can't seem to find - To God I am blind

Shivers the spine when I'm alive
Shivers the spine when I die

All this pain... All this pain... All this pain...

Shivers the spine when I'm alive
Shivers the spine when I die
