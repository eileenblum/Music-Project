[Music: Lenk, Lyrics: Levï¿½n, Lenk]

I can tell wrong from right
The stories you tell
The sound of a thousand lies
Don't tell me I'm out of line
I know every move
Heard every alibi

Your destiny's calling
It's only a matter of time
Before you start falling
Losing what's left of your mind

Don't tell me you are sorry
Don't tell me you are true
Cause I don't believe in you
I used to believe
Don't tell me you are changing
Don't tell me your truth
Cause I can't believe in you
Like I used to believe

You are the accident
Just waiting to happen
Too late to save yourself
It's over and we both know
That you're back on your own
Out of your comfort zone

You're tradding old waters
Playing your game 'till the end
A lamb to the slaughter
Losing again and again

Don't tell me you are sorry
Don't tell me you are true
Cause I don't believe in you
I used to believe
Don't tell me you are changing
Don't tell me your truth
Cause I can't believe in you
Like I used to believe
Tell me, who will believe in you
