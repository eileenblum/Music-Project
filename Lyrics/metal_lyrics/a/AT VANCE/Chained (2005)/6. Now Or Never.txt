[Music: Lenk, Lyrics: Levï¿½n, Lenk]

Look into the mirror
Search inside your heart
You will find the one you really are

Any way but backwards
Heading for the truth
Nobody can tell you what to do

Live your life
Just open up your eyes

Now or never
You must choose your destiny
Live forever
Trust your soul and
Seize the day
You're in control
It's all in your mind
Live your life

Face a new tomorrow
You've got everything to win
From today your new life will begin

The only trusted ally
Is noone but yourself
Standing tall, prepared to risk it all

Live your life
Just open up your eyes

Now or never
You must choose your destiny
Live forever
Trust your soul and
Seize the day
You're in control
It's all in your mind
Live your life

Now or never
You must choose your destiny
Live forever
Trust your soul and
Seize the day
You're in control
It's all in your mind
Live your life
