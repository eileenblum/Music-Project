[Music: Lenk, Lyrics: Levï¿½n, Lenk]

I lost my mind
I lost myself
I kept on falling
Straight down to hell

Stood at the crossroads
I needed a sign
To find my way
Out of the night

As the light seemed to be too far away
The answer to every prayer
Looked into my eyes and took my hand

(It took)
Two hearts but only one wish
Two hearts, together we're strong
(It took)
Two hearts but only one wish
Two hearts, together we're strong

The wheels of life
Spinning around
I kept on'falling
No feet on the ground

Reached out for something
But I forgot to give
It took an angel to show me how to live

As the light seemed to be too far away
The answer to every prayer
Looked into my eyes and took my hand

(It took)
Two hearts but only one wish
Two hearts, together we're strong
(It took)
Two hearts but only one wish
Two hearts, together we're strong
