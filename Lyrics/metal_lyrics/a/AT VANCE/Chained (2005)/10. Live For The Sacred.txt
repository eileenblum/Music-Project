[Music: Lenk, Lyrics: Levï¿½n, Lenk]

The cry's been heard before
It's evil to the core
Chanting in the distant
Calling out for more

Always - hunted - wanted
It's an everlasting chase
Always - hunted - wanted
Ages since it started

A scream of ecstasy
As they smell the enemy
Hunting human souls
But they can't catch me

I live for the sacred
I'll die for the truth
Fighting the dark 'till the
Light comes shinning through

Centuries of fear
So many dissapeared
But finally the time has come
The reckoning is near

Always - hunted - wanted
They are in it for the chase
Always - hunted - wanted
I'll finish what they started

So lead them on to me
I let them sense the enemy
Let them hunt my soul
Cause they can't catch me

I live for the sacred
I'll die for the truth
Fighting the dark 'till the
Light comes shinning through
The light comes shinning through

I live for the sacred
I'll die for the truth
Fighting the dark 'till the
Light comes shinning through
I live for the sacred
I'll die for the truth
Fighting the dark 'till the
Light comes shinning through
