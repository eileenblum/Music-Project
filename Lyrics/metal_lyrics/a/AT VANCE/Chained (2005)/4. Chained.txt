[Music: Lenk, Lyrics: Levï¿½n, Lenk]

Don't try to change me
Don't try to stop the roll of the dice
The fate of mine
Choices I'm making, the plays I act
I don't expect you to understand

Now, I can tell you must be hurting
Don't think I don't, keep hangin' on
Hide in my shadow, but you should know
You got me...

Chained
Release me from this slavery
Chained
You'll never get the best of me
Chained
Our days are numbered can't you see
Chained
That is nothing, but a game to me

It's in your hearbeat
Every word you speak
You fear the moment you'll watch me leave
No matter how much you are burning
You're still too cold
Well, my love can't be trusted
You ought to know

I feel the pain in your denials
Don't think I don't, telling yourself it
Isn't over, but we both know
You got me...

Chained
Release me from this slavery
Chained
You'll never get the best of me
Chained
Our days are numbered can't you see
Chained

Release me from this slavery...
It's nothing but a game to me, you got me

Chained
Release me from this slavery
Chained
You'll never get the best of me
Chained
Our days are numbered can't you see
Chained
That is nothing, but a game to me
