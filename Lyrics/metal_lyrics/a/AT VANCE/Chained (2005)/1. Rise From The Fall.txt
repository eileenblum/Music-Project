[Music: Lenk, Lyrics: Leven, Lenk]

Invisible faces
Whisper to me in the night
They're speaking of places
Men have spent lifetimes to find

As if out of nowhere
Their shadows appeared
Fathers and sons in search for the one
Souls of eternity

Into the night, Reach for the sky

Guide me: You are the wise
Take me away to your kingdom of light
Time will prove to us all
If I'm the one, the rise from the fall
The rise from the fall

The journey seemed endless
Answers were so far away
I was running on empty
I was down on my knees in prayer

And just out of nowhere
The shadows appeared
Opened the gate, they showed me the way
The road to eternity

Into the night, Head for the sky

Guide me: You are the wise
Take me away to your kingdom of light
Time will prove to us all
If I'm the one, the rise from the fall
The rise from the fall

As if out of nowhere
Their shadows appeared
Fathers and sons in search for the one
Souls of eternity

Into the night, Reach for the sky

Guide me: You are the wise
Take me away to your kingdom of light
Time will prove to us all
If I'm the one, the rise from the fall
The rise from the fall
