[Music: Lenk, Lyrics: Levï¿½n, Lenk]

Thunder and lighting roaring outside
Voices keep calling your name thru the night
The wind carries these whispers away
It's almost like a spell

Will you ever break free
From the chains of the past
If you believe in yourself
There's freedom at last

Run for your life
Run from the dark to the light
Run for your life
Run with the speed of light

The beginning of the end
Cause now your fate is in your hands

Closing your eyes to focus the thoughts
You'll do anything not to get caught
Leave while you can and don't get confused
By demons inside your head

Will you ever break free
From the chains of the past
If you believe in yourself
There's freedom at last

Run for your life
Run from the dark to the light
Run for your life
Run with the speed of light

The beginning of the end
Cause now your fate is in your hands

Run for your life
Run from the dark to the light
Run for your life
Run with the speed of light

The beginning of the end
Cause now your fate is in your hands
