[Music: Lenk, Lyrics: Levï¿½n, Lenk]

Lay down your arms
This fight you cannot win
Don't go too far
Might be a rude awakening

We're wordls apart
I can't help what I don't feel
Don't trust your heart
I'm everything that you don't need

(You might as well)
Run / Leave
Cause I'm not your destiny
(You know you better)
Run / Break free
From you own worst enemy
I know you're confusing me
With the one I used to be
(You might as well)
Run / Leave me
No, I'm not your destiny

I know myself
The dark mind of a restless soul
The road to hell
So tell me what you're waiting for

Don't hesitate
There's still time to save yourself
Before it's too late
Get a life, get someone else

(You might as well)
Run / Leave
Cause I'm not your destiny
(You know you better)
Run / Break free
From you own worst enemy
I know you're confusing me
With the one I used to be
(You might as well)
Run / Leave me
No, I'm not your destiny

Lay down your arms
This fight you cannot win
Do not trust your heart
Might be a rude awakening

(You might as well)
Run / Leave
Cause I'm not your destiny
(You know you better)
Run / Break free
From you own worst enemy
I know you're confusing me
With the one I used to be
(You might as well)
Run / Leave me
No, I'm not your destiny
