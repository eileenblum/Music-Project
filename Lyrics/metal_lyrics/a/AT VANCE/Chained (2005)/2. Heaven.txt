[Music: Lenk, Lyrics: Levï¿½n, Lenk]

Too many questions runnin' through your head
Speaking a language I don't understand
Blame me as always with that look in your eye
The sound of your silence asking me why

How many times must I try to tell you
For every tear that you cry my heart dies
There's no return for me

Heaven is somewhere beyond
A place you don't know, so far from here
Heaven is somebody else, no I can't pretend
Take my word, you're not the one

Now you're begging me to cure you from the pain
But the fats remain the same
The years that we had that you treasure in your heart
Was just a mistake from the start

Too many times must I try to tell you
For every tear that you cry my heart died
There's no return for me

Heaven is somewhere beyond
A place you don't know, so far from here
Heaven is somebody else, no I can't pretend
Take my word, you're not the one

Cause all that I need is to find some peace of mind
Oh can't you forgive and try

Heaven is somewhere beyond
A place you don't know, so far from here
Heaven is somebody else, no I can't pretend
Take my word, you're not the one
