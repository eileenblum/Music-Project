[Bonus]

[Music: Lenk, Lyrics: Levï¿½n, Lenk]

The words that I have chosen
May have caused you pain
But how could you expect me
To hide my eyes from the truth

You'll never know
If there'll be one more try

The world we had is too far away
Could you please give me a reason to stay
And my hands longing to touch your face
As I fall in your embrace

I can feel that you close to me
But you're gone and I don't wish you back

Who is foolin who can you tell me
Who's the one, who's true

I'm trying to reflect my memories
In search of my mistakes
But it seems that I'm the only one who sees
If our love was just a fake

Am I chasing just fantasies out of reach
Like a dream that fade

Who is foolin who can you tell me
Who's the one, who's true
Who is foolin who can you tell me
Who's the one, who's true
Who is foolin who can you tell me
Who's the one, who's true
