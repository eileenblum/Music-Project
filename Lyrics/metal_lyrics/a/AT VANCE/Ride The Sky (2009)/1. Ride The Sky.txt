Ever since you went away
I feel so empty, cold and bare
And all that I can do is wait
Pray to give me peace of mind

Sacred heart what I long to get
I'm losing the ground
The earth starts to quake
Doors open up
I see the burning gate

But I tear down these bridges
I keep fighting for our love

Ride the sky
Rising higher above the clouds
Ride the sky
Following the decent name

We thought we could rule the world
Nothing that we couldn't bear
Side by side we walked the line
It felt so strong your hand in mine
Sacred heart I just can't regret

Where is my heart
I lay down the cards
Until the day
We will fall apart

I keep tearing down these bridges
I keep fighting for our love
