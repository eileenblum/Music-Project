I've been searching for so long
For all the things to come
Now that I realise it's all been said and done
Worrying through my memories is all that I can bear
And I'm picturing those faces I won't tempt today

I shiver when I think
I'm feeling so alone
Nothing left to say
And all the fame is gone
Time can't mend
These broken memories

Power! Power!
Standing out to live and know your pain
Power! Power!
Waste the tears gone
So you hear is
Power of truth

It's a rollercoaster ride
Emotions upside down
Falling through the sense of time
This feeling comes around
Memories are haunting me
Piercing through my soul
It worries me into the bones
The stories will be told

I can stay insane
If you won't stay alive
It's a piece of sadness shot
Straight into my heart
Some won't heal
These broken memories
