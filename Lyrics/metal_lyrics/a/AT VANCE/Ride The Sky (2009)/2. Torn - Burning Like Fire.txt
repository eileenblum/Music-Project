I thought love could be a healer
But love just gave me pain
Time just made me wonder
And my pain remains the same

Now that I feel all broken inside
And I can't believe I'm closing my eyes
Tell me where the truth can be found
And heaven must be somewhere around

But I'll carry on
I will keep fighting for
Until the day my restless heart tells me why

Torn - burning like fire
Torn - under the privilege moon
Torn - deepest desire
Torn - under the moon is rising

I just can't seem to freer
In your eyes
I see the sorrow
One day we'll make it
Not now I just can't take it

Now that you feel all broken inside
I can't believe that you are closing your eyes

But I'll carry on
I will keep fighting for
Until the day my restless heart starts to cry

Torn - burning like fire
Torn - under the privilege moon
Torn - deepest desire
Torn - under the moon is rising
Torn - you keep me burning
Torn - under the privilege moon
Torn - deepest desire
Torn - under the moon is rising

Why don't you take me in your arms?
You besief all do know home
Spread your wings of destiny
Now and forever
Take my freedom
Into your hands
