Fallin'
Fallin'

Running on the edge
Taken one by one
Forces of ave but the battle's just begun
Be numb and ready
With an anger to kill
Taken all your chances
Sharpening your skills

One man to another
Kill eye to eye
You don't have to bother
Telling them goodbye
View to a kill
Using all your skills
Face your enemy
Trade our love against your

Fallin'
Fallin'
Callin' your name
There I'm down on my knees
I'm down on my knees and pray

Fallin'
Fallin'
Callin' your name
Just give me another chance
Please come tell me to leave

Losing your religion
Throw away your fears
Tear away your sorrow
There'll be no more tears
Daring that you struggle
But you kill to survive
Hearing all your troubles
To protect your life

No one will be there
To care about your thoughts
Nothing that you dare
To take away the odds
One man to another
Kill and survive
Face your enemy
Trade our love against your

Fallin'
Fallin'
Callin' your name
Oh, why don't you take my pain away
I can't take it no more

Fallin'
Fallin'
Callin' your name
I can take whatever you are saying
Just soul kept telling me lies

Fallin'
Fallin'
Callin' your name
Words are easy to say on and on
But so hard to understand

Fallin'
Fallin'
Callin' your name
Now that you tore me apart
Don't keep telling me lies
