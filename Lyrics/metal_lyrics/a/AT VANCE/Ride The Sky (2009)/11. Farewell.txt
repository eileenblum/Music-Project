Knowing each other for quite a long time
Feeling so numb
It shivers my spine

Keeping my memories like jewels and gold
Finding the answers before we get old

Where were you
When I needed someone
To shelter my pain
I can't stay
I need to know
Who loses game
Playing like children
Who live for the day
That's what I needed
You took it away

My farewell
Stays for eternity
This living hell
Seems to be destiny

I've lend you a hand but you always deny
I kept on fighting all love had to die
Taking the fire and keeping me blind
Was it all worth living behind

Where were you
When I needed someone
To shelter my pain
I can't stay
I need to know
Who lose this game
Playing like children
Who live for the day
That's what I needed
That's what I pray

Where were you
When I needed someone
To shelter my pain
I can't stay
I need to know
Who's ruling this game
This living hell
