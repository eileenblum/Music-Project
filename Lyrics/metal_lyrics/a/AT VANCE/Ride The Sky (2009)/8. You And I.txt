All by myself
With a tear in my eye
Trying to find
The words to explain
The sorrow that flows
In my heart, in my soul
But the river
Seems to be too deep

Time slips away
As I haze through my thoughts
But you gone and I can't turn back the time
What did you do?
Tell me
Why did you leave me

You and I
Truth or a lie
Is it all worth the tears that I cry
Tell me why
You have denied
All of my dreams are made in your hands

I thought I've seen
The truth in your eyes
But I was wrong
You made me wise
How could I be so blind
Tell me
What do you feel in your mind
