The air that I breath
Is icy and cold as I'm facing the challenged
Keep in my view across the burning horizon
Feeling the times running fast

My name is strength and I can't find the way
Darkness is closing my mind
Focus ahead I just can stay
Hope I'll get there in time

Nothing is real
And nothing seems right
There'll be the day
Things turn out right

Then you will see things to be seen
Until the dawn lights up the scene
And then you'll know
All has been done
Time doesn't wait
Telling no tales
Words have been written
Carved into stone
Now you will see what they mean

Passion and war was all they adore
Facing the sun with their violence and hate
Raising their heads
High in the sky
On salvation day

Hands out of hell
Longing for me
Trying to take me away
Struggle with madness
I'm running insane
As they soakin' my life away

Scared by the rain
Of fire around
Trying to find a way out
The heat is increasing
Boiling my skin
The pain starts taking its dues

Nothing is real
And nothing seems right
There'll be the day
Things turn out right

Then you will see things to be seen
Until the dawn lights up the scene
And then you'll know
The deal has been sealed
Time doesn't wait
Telling no tales
Words have been written
Carved into stone
Do you believe what you see?
