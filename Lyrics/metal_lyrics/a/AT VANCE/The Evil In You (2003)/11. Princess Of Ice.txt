She's got a smile that is made out of ice
No one's here to save the tears she cries
As she dances in the moonlight
Behind those windows

Every little move she makes
Seems like magic in your eyes and
You are lost between two worlds
Shadows from near or far

And when you close your eyes
You're trying to be near
Without all your fears
But there's no way to her
No way to her

Princess of ice
Will I ever find the way to your heart
Will I survive all the dreams for my
Princess of ice

And even though the years pass by
Something in my mind still calls your name
And still I'm blinded by the charms you spread
Behind those windows

Every now and then I'm reachin' out
But you don't answer all my calls
How can I get to you
When I melt the ice

All I'm aiming for is
Trying to break free
Will I ever see
But there's no way to you
No way to you

Princess of ice
Will I ever find the way to your heart
Will I survive all the dreams for my
Princess of ice

And when you close your eyes
You're trying to be near
Without all your fears
But there's no way to her
No way to her

Princess of ice
Will I ever find the way to your heart
Will I survive all the dreams for my
Princess of ice
Princess of ice
Will I ever find the way to your heart
Will I survive all the dreams for my
Princess of ice
