Running on empty the road is too late
You'll never get there where you belong
Chasing the shadows that you'll never see
Falling in love with your enemy

You just can't hide
&gt;From your tears inside
You've got to try
Facing the truth eye to eye

But your body is weak so is mine

Right - I still don't know were you're going
Wrong - I'll never find out the way
Right - is this the truth that you're showing
Wrong - what should I believe

Heart full of sorrow that tears you apart
Vultures behind you right from the start
They keep on waiting for the moment you fall
Time is against you it's building a wall

And in the end
No one will lend you his hand
You'll be alone
Chained on this silly throne

And your heart is losing the fight

Right - I still don't know were you're going
Wrong - I'll never find out the way
Right - is this the truth that you're showing
Wrong - what should I believe
Right - then I just fall into nowhere
Wrong - and I'm losing my way
Right - why don't you say that you care
Wrong - what should I believe

Right, wrong, right, wrong...
