I can hear the sound of your feet
Coming closer to the place where we meet
I raise my weary head
And I open my eyes

And in the silence of my lonely room
A clock is ticking and it's near high noon
Outside my window the thunder roars
I feel it's time to enter the door

Can you hear the echoes in my brain
Driving me mad I'm running insane
They call your name on and on
But then I wake up and you're gone

But you didn't seem so far away

One million miles away
So my call goes over the ocean
One million miles away
Will I ever be near to you

I try to make this moment last
To see your face behind this mask
I feel I'm falling back asleep
So I'm closing my eyes

My body shivers and my souls starts to ache
I try to wake up before it's to late
Calling your name but it's lost in the air
Running on aimless to weak to dare

And your picture fades far beyond my range

One million miles away
So my call goes over the ocean
One million miles away
Will I ever be near to you
