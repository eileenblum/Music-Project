There may be times when all your life seems full of pain
But deep inside you you've got power in your veins
Just try not bring it out let it see the light
Just find your destination don't give up this fight

There'll be the day when your star will shine
Then you won't be the last in the line

So did you learn your lesson well
If you did not time will send you to tell

Stronger than you think
No mountain high enough
Stronger than you think
And the victory'll be mine
Stronger than you think

Trading your fears against the forces that you hide
Then you will find out 'bout the power deep inside
Just try to break the borders, chains that rule your life
There'll be a new horizon for you to arise

Some day your star will shine
Then you'll be the first in the line

Broken hearts and desperate souls
I just wish you could see me

Stronger than you think
No mountain high enough
Stronger than you think
And the victory'll be mine
Stronger than you think

Broken hearts and desperate souls
I just wish you could see me

Stronger than you think
No mountain high enough
Stronger than you think
And the victory'll be mine
Stronger than you think
