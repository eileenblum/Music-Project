This is my world where I live
And I won't let you into my mind
I won't open my heart
I am the king in this world
I'm the ruler of thoughts in my soul

Now that I'm here and you're there
But I'm holding the key to my heart
I still treasure my dreams
Get out of my way better pray
Cause there won't be no mercy for you

Unchain my heart so my spirit can fly
Leave me alone in my world and on my throne
Then you may find me
On the street of your dreams

I'm on the street of my dreams
Or on the road to hell
Street of my dreams
Or just the road to hell

Throughout the years in my life
I have learned what is wrong and what's right
No one stood by my side
Time made me wise and so now I can see
The aim of my strains

Just take a look in my soul
And then maybe you'll know
What there words are about you to tell
You caused the spell that I'm trying to break
To release myself

Unchain my heart so my spirit can fly
Leave me alone in my world and on my throne
Then you may find me
On the street of your dreams

I'm on the street of my dreams
Or on the road to hell
Street of my dreams
Or just the road to hell
