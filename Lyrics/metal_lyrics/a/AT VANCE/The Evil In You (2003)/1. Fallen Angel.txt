Now that I see myself without the shades of fear
The tears of bitterness taste strange but now it's clear
And I used to think I've owned a wall that's build with love
But you have torn it into fragments stone by stone
Then you gave me a bouquet of roses
They where black and seed with hate
You treated me like I'm your enemy
You where the one who opened the gate

The robe that you're wearing now
Carries all my dreams and I hope that you can bear
That you're just a

Fallen angel - digging the dirt
Fallen angel - what is the word
Fallen angel - down to the bone
Fallen angel - now you're alone

Down to the bone, you're just a fallen angel

The words you've chosen were like arrows in my heart
What's your intention did you plan that from the start
I thought I've laid out all my dreams in your hands
And I truly hope that you know where this ends
Jealousy seemed to be master
The reason that caused this disaster
I feel like I'm reading an epitaph
You've buried our friendship and love

The robe that you're wearing now
Carries all my dreams and I hope that you can bear

Fallen angel - digging the dirt
Fallen angel - what is the word
Fallen angel - down to the bone
Fallen angel - now you're alone

Down to the bone, you're just a fallen angel
