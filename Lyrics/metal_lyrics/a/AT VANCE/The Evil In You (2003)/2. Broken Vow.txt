Watching the tears melt
With the rain on my skin
What was my mistake
What was my sin
Will you be there
Just to show me the way
Who do you dare the
Long and winding road
There is hardly anything
You could compared

Don't you see
What you've down to me

You left this broken vow
But why did you break my heart
We could be closer now
But why did you break my heart

Unspoken words
Violence and hate
We've been through it all
But now that's it's too late
So I'm sending out this prayer
Towards the heaven that we owned
So much higher than the mountains
And the fields of love we roamed
Running towards eternity
In search for peace of mind

Don't you see
What you've down to me

You left this broken vow
But why did you break my heart
We could be closer now
But why did you break my heart
