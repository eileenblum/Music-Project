What is the taste of rain in may
What is the name of the god you pray
Where is the end of the road that I'm on
Can you tell me if there'll be a new dawn

A thousand questions
Will you answer me
God if I only could make you see

You're my shining star
That I will hold forever
Weather near or far
I'll be there 'til the end of time
Cause you brighten up my day
And the love that we share
Is here to stay

Well I can see the light
It shines right through the night
But it's all so far away

Will you stand another thousand years
And can you dry all my painful tears
Will the stars still shine for you and me
And will there be a world where we can be free

My love will take you
Far beyond the sky
God if you'd only give us a try

You're my shining star
That I will hold forever
Weather near or far
I'll be there 'til the end of time
Cause you brighten up my day
And the love that we share
Is here to stay

A thousand questions
Will you answer me
God if I only could make you see
My love will take you
Far beyond the sky
God if you'd only give us a try
