I can see right through your evil eyes
I never knew that you're the devil in disguise
The game you've played as far beyond the rules we've made
Now that we're through all your excuses are too late
Getting closer right here with me
I take you over then I'll make you see
What you've caused inside of me

So the curtain will fall
And you'll be there with your back to the wall
I won't recall all the pain I will conquer it all

I have tried to lend my hand to save your soul
Walking side by side towards to reach our goals
The chains you've put me on went rusty through the years
Now that I hold the and teared away my fears
Getting closer right here with me
I take you over then I'll make you see
What you've caused inside of me

So the curtain will fall
And you'll be there with your back to the wall
I won't recall all the pain I will conquer it all

So the curtain will fall
And you'll be there with your back to the wall
Don't you recall the days of joy
That we shared after all
I will conquer it all

And then the shades appear from the dust
They're longing for your soul
And there's no way
To ease your pain they will linger on

So the curtain will fall
And you'll be there with your back to the wall
I won't recall all the pain I will conquer it all
