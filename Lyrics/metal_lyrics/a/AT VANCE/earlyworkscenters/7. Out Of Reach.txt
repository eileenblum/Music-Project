Shining so bright, rising from the dawn
Voices gently and quiet, you're the one I call
No other, nobody, nothing I want more
But I can't get what I'm dying for

You're like a shadow of my thoughts
I'll never touch-take my heart and soul
Still you're out of reach for me
And you'll never be mine
You're a vision of my dreams
And I'm dying to give my thoughts a shape

I'll never look into those eyes
Cause one look or touch of you
I'm chained by my desire
You will never let me go
I'm like a slave to your touch
Please release my pain

Still you're out of reach for me
And you'll never be mine
You're a vision of my dreams
And I'm dying to give my thoughts a shape

I'm flying above the clouds
But the sky is dark and no rainbow is in sight
So I spread my view to get a hold of the blue
Which is too far behind, too far to reach
Still you're of reach-you will never be mine

Still you're out of reach for me
And you'll never be mine
You're a vision of my dreams
And I'm dying to give my thoughts a shape

You're like a shadow of my thoughts
I'll never touch-you take my heart and soul
