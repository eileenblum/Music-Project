Can you feel my hands?
Longing for you
But they can't reach
What they desire

I keep my dreams safe and warm
Don't let nobody know
You're still in my soul

But dreams are just dreams
They fade like waves in the sea
Nothing can take me there
Where I long to be

I just stay by myself
Don't tell nobody but you
are still in my soul

I won't cry no tears
My wounds will heal through the years
And in the end is just you and me
I'll write your name in a tree
'Cause you're my one and only love

As the years go by
I took your picture in my hand
It lost a bit of the colour
But the magic still remains the same

I keep my dreams safe and warm
Don't let nobody know
That you're still in my soul

I won't cry no tears
My wounds will heal through the years
And in the end is just you and me
I'll write your name in a tree
'Cause you're my one and only love

I won't cry no tears
My wounds will heal through the years
And in the end is just you and me
I'll write your name in a tree
'Cause you're my one and only love
