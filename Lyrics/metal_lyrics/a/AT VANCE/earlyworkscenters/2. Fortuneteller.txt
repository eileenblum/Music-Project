Out of the dark and into the light
That is were you belong
You'll never know what tomorrow will bring
It's like a race with no destination

Isn't there someone to answer your questions
Someone out in the fields
But the desert skies doesn't hold the key
You're no fortuneteller
Unspoken words... unanswered questions

Fears with no name caused by sorrow and pain
It seems that your goals get out of sight
But wherever you'll fly on the wings of your dreams
You'll never get too high

Isn't there someone to answer your questions
Someone out in the fields
But the desert skies doesn't hold the key
You're no fortuneteller
Unspoken words... unanswered questions
