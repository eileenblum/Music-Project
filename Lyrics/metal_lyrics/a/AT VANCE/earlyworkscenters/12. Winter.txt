A cool breeze in my hair
The year has gone
All the leaves are falling
And you wish yourself back to the summer
To the fields of green

The winter spread his arms
And you can feel his ice cold breath
The clouds are grey and filed with rain
The pale light of the sun

A misty fog of gold dreams
Shades of the past
My heart is lost in memories
In a season where love can find it's place
As I wonder through the fields
It seems to be stone cold

I close my eyes and thoughts get wings
And let them fly to you
