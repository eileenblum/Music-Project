When you smile at me, you touch me so deep
With your blue eyes as clear as the sea
And when you take my hand
It looks so small in mine
I'll catch you when you fall
Just like a falling star
Whenever and whatever you want me to
There's nothing I wouldn't do

Your tender touch, your pretty smile
It means so much, is all in your hands
And there's a long way to go
There'll be tears along the way

I catch you when you fall
Just like a falling star
And I can give you the moon
Girl, I swear I can do
I can give you my deepest everything
Whenever and whatever you want me to
I guide you through

I catch you when you fall
Just like a falling star
I'll wipe your tears away, I'll dry your eyes
Whenever and whatever you want me to
I guide you through
I guide you through
