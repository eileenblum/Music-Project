They've swarm in to die for their land
Displacing all their fears
With their arms in the same direction
Tearing down the lands and the fields
Where they could have build their home

Falling one by one and fighting eye to eye
Losing your faith and your religion
Marching on and on and rambling down
The tree of life
You're right on the center of another one's
Foolish vision

They could have built houses and fields
With the spirits of their hands
But now they're forced to march in a row
They're burning and raping
What they could have loved

Falling one by one and fighting eye to eye
Losing your faith and your religion
Marching on and on and rambling down
The tree of life
You're right on the center of another one's
Don't be the fool of another one's foolish vision

As I wonder through the fields, memories of the past
Fade away like shadows white and pale
Too far away like dreams made of sand
Melting in your hands
