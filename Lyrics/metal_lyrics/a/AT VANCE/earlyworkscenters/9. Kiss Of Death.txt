Can't you see
Nothing lasts forever
Things won't change just try to watch behind the scenes
Take a look
Where the river runs
Water trades
For poison
No one cares, no one sees,
Maybe you won't too but don't we have a given
mission
Save up all we have for a better world in a better time
Every little thing has got its destination

Take good care
Watching every move
Good and bad is so close together
Everytime when you don't think they use you
Doesn't that refuse you

As time moves on
Thoughts are rushing through your head
Minutes and seconds
Seem to be an endless time

Kiss of death
They will never learn
Destroying and burning what they have

Suddenly your visions getting clearer
And you start to get things sorted out
You try to change what went wrong
But do you really know
where the path is leading you

The only thing you see
Is a dark deep horizon
The clouds are filled with rain
They drag away the blue

Kiss of death
They will never learn
Destroying and burning what they have
