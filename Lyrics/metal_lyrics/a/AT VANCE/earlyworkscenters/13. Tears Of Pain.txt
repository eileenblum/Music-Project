I can hear your breath when I'm lying by myself
The ticking of the clock
Feels like a hammer in my head
I can smell your body, I'm dying to feel your touch
Caught up in my visions, you seem to be so near
You hurt me so deep, you're mistreating my soul
But this addiction won't let you go
So I'm crying tears of pain
Listen to me and understand
So I'm crying tears of pain, don't ever hurt me again

You're under my skin, much too far beyond to reach
You own my heart, you're like poison in my veins
I can never leave, I'm always in your chains
I'm down on my knees and I'm chained by your love
And I won't let you

So I'm crying tears of pain, don't you do that again
I'm crying tears of pain
Don't you ever hurt me again
So I'm crying tears of pain
Please don't ever do that again
I'm crying tears of pain, listen to me and understand

Deep in my heart the flame still burns inside
You've torn me, you've torn me apart
You've broke my will I can't control
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, don't hurt me again

Deep in my heart the flame won't stop burning
I can smell your body, I'm dying for your touch
Caught up in my visions, you seem to be so near
You hurt me so deep, you're mistreating my soul
But this addiction won't let you go

So I'm crying tears of pain
Don't you ever do that again
So I'm crying tears of pain
Listen to me and understand
So I'm crying...
