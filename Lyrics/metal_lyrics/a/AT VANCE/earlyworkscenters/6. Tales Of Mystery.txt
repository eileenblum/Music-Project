Take your time enjoy your youth
Changes don't come overnight
You'll find the truth it's all in me
Don't believe a word they say
Fight for what you think
Keep the flame it's your delight

Don't let it burn out keep the faith
Nothin' comes the easy way it's a hard race
You struggle over right and wrong
And black seems to be white
Don't give in stayin' strong
When nothing is in sight

Tales of mystery
Where you don't belong
You can make the seasons change
Find your destiny
It's anywhere you want
Somehow you will get through

I can see myself
Through the shadows of the past
I'm walking the fine line
Between pleasure and pain
I'm trying to find my way
Through all the troubles that pass by
No one's here no one's near

You don't have to cry
Trouble comes and goes
Time will show you why
And where you have to go
In your world and in your mind
Nothin' stays the same
Now and here that's where you are
You've got to fight the pain

Tales of mystery
Where you don't belong
You can make the seasons change
Find your destiny
It's anywhere you want
Somehow you will get through
