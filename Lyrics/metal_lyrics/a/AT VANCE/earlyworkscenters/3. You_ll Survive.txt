I know a place not far away
Letters are written but the words don't make sense
I've got the strength and I've got the power
I'm still alive I'm gonna wait for the hour

When my chance has come
I won't let it just pass by
Reach out, I will be there

Rain and shine
Dark and light

Keeping all my dreams in sight
For good and bad
Happy or sad
Never struggle to get the fortune
Keep on searching'
Never fail you will survive
And in the end you'll reach the goal
Your time will come

Impressions trade against reflections
You never loose your direction
Fantasy is like path
In your thoughts

Where you're not supposed to step
Don't you move aside
It's hard to keep and hard to handle
Try to keep and look straight

Rain and shine
Dark and light

Keeping all my dreams in sight
For good and bad
Happy or sad
Never struggle to get the fortune
Keep on searching'
Never fail you will survive
And in the end you'll reach the goal
Your time will come
