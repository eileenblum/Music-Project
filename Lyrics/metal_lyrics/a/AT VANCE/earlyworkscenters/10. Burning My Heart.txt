Deep in your eyes I can see your dreams passing
Like shadows white and pale
So hard to get a hold on
But your dreams are made of sand
They're melting in your hands
Keep on trying and hold on tight
Don't let them fade away, don't let them fade away

You're burning my heart, you're burning my soul
You're the reason of my pain
Babe you got me in control
You're like the thunder and you're like the rain
Your love keep driving me insane

Desire burns so strong, it tears me apart
My soul is like an ocean, my feelings getting lost
Endless ways, endless dreams
It seems to be so invisible
I'm poisoned by your love, blinded by the light

You're burning my heart, you're burning my soul
You're the reason of my pain
Babe you got me in control
You're like the thunder and you're like the rain
Your love keep driving me insane
