The flowers in my hand
I used to bring to open your heart
They could not show what you meant to me
But the way we had to go
Seemed to be in two different directions
So now I'm just by myself
And all I have are these sad and lonely memories
So here is my heart

Things won't stay the same
They can't be forced by you
Time will make you wise
Time will make you see
Where your love belongs
There'll someone who owns your heart
It might be any when
You'll meet him someday
And in the end you'll find the one for you

So the seasons of my life
Are passing by in front of my eyes
But I can't get a hold of them
Like I couldn't get of you

But throughout the years
I'm trying to get over it
Cause I realize
That love can't be forced
So now I know
Yeah
That I'm not the one

It's cold outside
As I'm walking through the field
I don't have any kind of destination
My heart is empty
How is it to you
And all my thoughts run into a dead end road

It seems that I've reached the end
But I still can see that little light
That is what I'm longing for

So the flowers are all gone
And all that is left are just these words
They might not mean anything to you
But the more they mean to me

I didn't expect you
To understand all of this
I just want to make you think
Maybe about you or maybe about me
So here is my heart

The flowers in my hand
I used to bring to open your heart
They could not show what you meant to me
So here is my heart
