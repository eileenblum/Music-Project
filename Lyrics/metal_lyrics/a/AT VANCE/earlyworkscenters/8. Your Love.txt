Pick me up from the ground again
To believe in all your love
You feel the cold when it comes down like rain
In the middle of my heart

All my fears just hold on for a while
And all my tears just vanish when I see you smile
If we ever say goodbye - it's not forever
Baby you know I can't deny I'm lost without your love

You know the way to open my heart
Some things are deeper than it seems
You're miles away and oceans apart
But I will keep you in my dreams

All my fears just hold on for a while
And all my tears just vanish when I see you smile
If we ever say goodbye - it's not forever
There is nothing worth to hide - when we're together
If we ever say goodbye - it's not forever
Baby you know I can't deny I'm lost without your love
