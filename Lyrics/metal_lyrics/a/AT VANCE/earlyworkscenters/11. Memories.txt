A fly on the wall, the light is low an so is the mood
Pictures fade and I'm unable to keep my memories
Traded into walls of stone, nothing there

Fields of green and tears of joy - it's getting so cold
There's nothing there to remind me, oh
Everything seems to be broken in a millions pieces
And thousand parts
I can't put them back together
A puzzle with no solution

Memories, have you forgotten
Where we used to play
Memories, do you remember where we used to play
Where we used to play

Grey and dark, there's no place for emotions
Seasons change just like a life so don't let it pass by
No time to rest and pay the price
And make your life with dime

Fields of green and tears of joy - it's getting so cold
There's nothing there to remind me, oh
Everything seems to be broken in a millions pieces
And thousand parts
I can't put them back together
A puzzle with no solution

Memories, do you remember where we used to play
Memories, have you forgotten
Where we used to play
Memories, can't you remember
Say did they fade away
Memories, memories
