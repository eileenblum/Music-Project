I've travelled much more than a billion miles
My only aim was to conquer the world
In countless fights i had to pay my dues
That was the war of my life

The years of fear and anger
Have caused scarfs in my soul
But I can't wait no longer
Tryin to break the wall

I'm gonna try
I'll never denie
Just listen to me
Cause it's the last good bye

I'll tell you why
Your life is a lie
Here's what I say
Just a last good bye

There must be million faces I have seen
I just passed by and didn't spend a word
There's so much pain which couldn't touch my heart
But afterall I realized where I was wrong

The years of fear and anger
Kept me locked inside my room
The time has come and I feel stronger
To tear away the doom

I'm gonna try
I'll never denie
Just listen to me
Cause it's the last good bye

I'll tell you why
Your life is a lie
Here's what I say
Just a last good bye
