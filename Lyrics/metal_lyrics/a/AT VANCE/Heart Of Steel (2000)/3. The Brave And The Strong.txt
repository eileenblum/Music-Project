There's something evil in the sky
it's haunting me and I just can't hide
it's getting closer more and more
to start the war

Fight and believing
that's what I'm aiming for
so tells the story
there goes out my prayer

The brave and the strong
will always be on my side
nothing can tear me apart
when darkness surrounds you
I'll be your shining star
even thou the battle rages on

the fear arises with the night
nowhere to run there's nowhere to hide
the time has come to raise your sword
against the evil unknown

fight and believing
I'll have the victory
Last of the chapters
I'm the one who stays
