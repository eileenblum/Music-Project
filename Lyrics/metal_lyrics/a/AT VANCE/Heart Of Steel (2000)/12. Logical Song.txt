When I was young, it seemed that lilfe
was so wonderful,a miracle,
oh it was beautiful, magical.
And all the birds in the trees,
well they'd be singing so happily,
oh, joyfully, oh, playfully watching me.

But then they sent me away,
to teach me how to be sensible,
logicalm oh, responsible practical.
And they showed me a world
where I could be so dependable,
oh, clinical, oh, intellectual, cynical.

There are times when all the world's asleep,
the questions run too deep for such a simple man
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned?
I know it sounds absurd. Please tell me who I am

I said, now watch what you say or
they'll be calling you a radical,
a liberal, oh fanatical, criminal.
Oh, won't you sign up your name,
we'd like to feel you're acceptable,
respectable, oh, presentable, a vegetable!

At night, when all the world's asleep...

[Outro:]
Please tell me who I am who I am who I am who I am
