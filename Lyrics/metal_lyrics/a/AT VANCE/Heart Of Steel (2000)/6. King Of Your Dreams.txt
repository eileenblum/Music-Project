Somewhere between
The day and the night
You're hidin your aim's
Waitin to fight

Face of an angel
old to be wise
but you are hidin
the devil in disguise

where does it end
and where do you want to go
the borders you'll bend
I guess you will never know

Open your eyes
try to be wise
and you'll be the king of your dreams
tryin to see
what you want to be
then you'll be the king of your dreams

Violence and hate
is the harvest you' ll get
pay close attention
they might take your head

don't play with fire
you won't stand the pain
they call you a liar
they call you a shame
