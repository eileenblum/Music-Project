Maybe I was wrong
I said too many things that I should have left unspoken
But where do you belong
There are so many reasons to hold on what we?ve got

So why should I pay the price
And why should I roll the dice
Deep inside I feel the shame
You name the pain and thats the shame

So why do you cry
I gave you my heart but you denied
So please tell me why
You're throwing our love away tonight
So why do you cry

Now you're standing in the cold
And the tears you cry will turn the ice into stone
Enlight the candle cries the flame in my hand
Just to make you see the things that you have done

So why should I pay the price
And why should I roll the dice
Deep inside I feel the pain
But you're the only one to blame

So why do you cry
I gave you my heart but you denied
So please tell me why
You're throwing our love away tonight
So why do you cry
