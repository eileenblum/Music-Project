shadows so pale
in the heat of the night
fading to grey
cause they're scared by the light

shootin their arrows
with the wings of pain
restless unkind
but they keep on fightin in vain

tryin to be who you are
the harder you try the closer you'll get
when you fight with a heart of steel

bloodstains in red
that cover your clothes
telling the truth
'bout the souls that have passed

the things that you see
as you read between the lines
won't let you be
'cause they're just partners in crime

tryin to be who you are
the harder you try the closer you'll get
when you fight with a heart of steel
fightin a war you can't win
the only things that stay are you're sins
but you fight with a heart of steel
