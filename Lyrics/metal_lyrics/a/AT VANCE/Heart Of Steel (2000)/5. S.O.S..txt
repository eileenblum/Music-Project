Where are those happy times - they seem so hard to find.
I try to reach for you but you have closed your mind.
Whatever happened to our love ?
I wish I understood.
It used to be so nice, it used to be so good.

[Chorus:]
So when you're near me, darling can't you hear me, SOS
The love you gave me, nothing less can save me, SOS
When you're gone, how can I even try to go on ?
When you're gone, though I try how can I carry on ?

You seem so far away though you are standing near.
You make me feel alive but something died, I fear.
I really tried to make it up - I wish I understood.
What happened to our love, it used to be so good.
