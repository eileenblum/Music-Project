Facin the day on my own
I'm movin all alone
To get where I belong

Where can I run to now
Why can't you take me in your arms

I'm burnin my soul
Cryin over you
These days seem so dark
I'm fightin to get thru

Feelin your heart beat 
Right next to mine

Take me away
To a world we can stay
Save me from here
There'll be only you and me

See me cryin
(See me cryin)
Feels like dyin
(Feels like dyin)
I am bleeding
(I'm bleeding for you)
When you're leaving
(I'm cryin over you)

As the years go by
And I grow colder deep inside
The scars getting older

Learning to live
Without all the love you give

I can't seem to find
The bridge back to you
The river's so dark
I'll never make it thru

Where can I run to now
(I've) got to break free from the dark

can't you take me away
To a world we can stay
Why don't you
save me from here
There'll be only you and me

See me cryin
(See me cryin)
Feels like dyin
(Feels like dyin)
I am bleeding
(I'm bleeding for you)
When you're leaving
(I'm cryin over you)
