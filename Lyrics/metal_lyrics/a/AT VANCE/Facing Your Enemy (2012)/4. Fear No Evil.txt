Here in the shadows
Where my heart
Is livin without fear
I keep runnin on and on
How long does it take
Before it stops to ache
And when it takes
That pain away

And in the dark
The shining star
Take me as I am

Fear - no evil
Face - the eye of the storm
Fear - no evil
Face - The truth is plain to see

And when there's nothing
I can't hold back
I can't hold back these tears
I've bee fightin all those years
I'm fightin against the odds
Betrayed by all these gods
And the demons of the dark

And then the light
Cracks the sky
It brings me to my knees

Fear - no evil
Face - the eye of the storm
Fear - no evil
Face - The truth is plain to see

[Solo]

Fear - no evil
Face - the eye of the storm
Fear - no evil
Face - The truth is plain to see
