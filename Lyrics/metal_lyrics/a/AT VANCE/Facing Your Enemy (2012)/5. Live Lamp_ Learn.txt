Her mind so cold
Like a restless heart
I can't go on
Tearin my world apart

Innocent victim of circumstance
Tradin the good
For this devils dance

I keep on losing
The faith to believe

Into the riot of this dungeon
Out of these fairytales
You'll see the desert sky's
Livin in an ocean of lies

Live and learn
Take my heart and burn
Live e die
It's your love I can't deny

Open my eyes
When I want to believe
The chains seal the gate
My life's so unreal

Fight to survive
Straight from your heart
Feeling the evil
Facing the time

I keep on losing
The faith to believe

Into the riot of this dungeon
Out of these fairytales
You'll see the desert sky's
Livin in an ocean of lies

Live and learn
Take my heart and burn
Just live &amp; die
It's your love I can't deny

[Solo]

Live and learn
Take my heart and burn
Just live &amp; die
It's your love I can't deny
