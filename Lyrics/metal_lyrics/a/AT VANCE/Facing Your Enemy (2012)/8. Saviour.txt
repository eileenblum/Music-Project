I have been playin
The games that you play
But now that
I'm rollin the dice
All of the fortune
Right in my hands
Prayin it's me all to win

Rollin and fallin
Time standin still
But in the moment of truth
That's where my future begins

Wait
Try
Keeping the fame
And the fortune in your hands
And I can't wait to tun away

Tonight
I'm on the run
Beware
The future has just begun

And you'll be save
Right
here in my arms

I am the saviour of your soul
I'll bring you fortune if you call
Take my hand
Believe in your dreams

Why can't you see
That I'm broken inside
Been in your chains for too long
Begging for freedom
From this misery
Escaping from this living hell

Screaming and callin
Thou there is nothing to say
No one will ever believe
The tortures you're put me thru

Right 
Wrong
Hope that forever
I can make you see
That you became
Just a vision for me

Tonight
I'm on the run
Beware
The future has just begun

And you'll be save
Right here in my arms

I am the saviour of your soul
I'll bring you fortune
If you call
Take my hand
Believe in your dreams
