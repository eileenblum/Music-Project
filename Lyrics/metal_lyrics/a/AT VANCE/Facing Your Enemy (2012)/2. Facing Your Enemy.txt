When it's time to pray to heaven
When it's time to reach the sky
You try to reach for something better
And you try to say good bye

When you look into the mirror
Tell me what you see
Don't you see I'm bleedin
Cause feelin is believe

Why don't you take me
Where the love has gone
Facing your enemy
Take me
Where the destiny lives
Facing my enemy

Send a priest to find salvation
Crucified in evils name
Feeling weaker more than ever
Pray to god to end this game

When you look into the mirror
Tell me what you see
Don't you see I'm bleedin
Feelin is believe

So can't you take me
Where the love has gone
Facing your enemy
Take me
Where the destiny lives
Facing my enemy

[Solo]

Why don't you take me
Where the love has gone
Facing your enemy
Take me
Where the destiny lives
Facing my enemy
