Take a long hard look at my face
Take away the thing I can't replace
Take my heart, go on take it away
I've got nothing to say

Take away this sense of regret
Take the things I need to forget
Take the mistakes I haven't made yet
They're all I have left

I don't want to be the one
Who lets you down
All I did was run myself around
I wish I could have seen
Through your eyes
Maybe the I would have realized
I'm the only one who's bleeding
For the things I never needed
The things I never needed

Take a good long look at yourself
Take the weight off everyone else
Take the hardest blow that was dealt
It's all on your shoulders
