You Know everytime
I look into those eyes
I can't deny the feel
That you're the devil in disguise
And when darkness spreads
The Wings of destiny
I keep runnin blind
Can't you make me see

I know that you 
Came to rescue me
But you keep wantin more
More than I can be

I know
You will never run for cover
And I know
You will never take another

Keep holdin on
Take the chance right now

Heaven is calling
And you will be falling
Hell is waitin
'Till dawn is breaking
I know
Heaven
I know heaven is calling
Calling

And when those years have past
You could not turn away
As I was runnin thru your head
You could not stay

The wings of tragedy
A neverending game
And the mystic poetry
Callin out your name

I know that you
Came to rescue me
But you keep wantin more
More than I can be

I know 
You will never run for cover
And I know
You will never take another

Keep holdin on
Take the chance right now

Heaven is calling
And you will be falling
Hell is waitin
"Til dawn is breaking
I know
Heaven
I know heaven is calling
Calling

[Solo]

Heaven is calling
And you will be falling
Hell is waitin
"til dawn is breaking
I know
Heaven
I know heaven is calling
Calling
