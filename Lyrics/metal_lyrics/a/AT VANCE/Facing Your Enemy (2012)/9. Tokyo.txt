City lights shine out on me
I'm feelin you close
Hold me on these crowded streets
a sound in the night

Spending my time
Here with you 
I've got nothing to loose
Again and again
I have to give in
I might have to choose

Cause I felt in love
With a Japanese girl
And I've got a woman at home
Guess it's time to face the truth
Can't take no more

Tokyo Tokyo
Time of my life

Look into my eyes and see
That I wanna stay
I don't mean to make you cry
You know I've got to return

Cause it's waiting on me
In a different world
And can't stand the pain
Never believe in miracles
But I'm gonna try

Tokyo Tokyo
Time of my life
