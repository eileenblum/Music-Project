It's always the same
When you're facing a new day
You're hiding your pain
You try to break away

All these doors are locked
Sealed with a wall of hate
Hiding all these tortures
And the pain
You're thru

With the eyes
Of a stranger
Can they look into your soul
There'll be tears of anger
But don't believe a lie

They told you to stay
The words they said
Made you turn away
Underneath the heading lies
You cold not send your prayers

Then a ray of light
Spreads like an open roach
Promising peace of mind
Four your soul

The eyes of a stranger
Can they look into your soul
Tears of anger
But don't believe a lie

They told to stay
But you sent out your prayer
They keep callin

[Solo]

With the eyes of a stranger
Can they look into your soul
There'll be tears of anger
But don't believe a lie
