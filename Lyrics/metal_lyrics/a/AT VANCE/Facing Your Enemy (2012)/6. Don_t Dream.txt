Dream on
Believe

All the times
That I've cried
Keeping all the things
I knew inside

Don't dream
Cause it's now or never
Don't dream
It won't last forever
Our love
Can't die
Don't you dream
It won't last forever

Well I've been around here
For so long
And I just can't see
Where I went wrong
Won't you tell me
Who I am

Don't dream
Cause it's now or never
Don't dream
It won't last forever
Our love
Can't die
Don't you dream
It won't last forever

Holdin on
To the moments that we shared
And in my dreams
I see the love
That we cared
All I can be
Is the man that I am

Don't dream
Cause it's now or never
Don't dream
It won't last forever
Our love
Can't die
Don't you dream
It won't last forever
