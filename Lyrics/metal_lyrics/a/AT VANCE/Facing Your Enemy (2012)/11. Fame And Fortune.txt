I have been fightin
For too many years
And I have been wastin
So many tears
But time can not erase
Things that you have done
All the words you said

I can't see who I am
Don't you take me as I am
My life that is what I want from you
My heart isn't bound until forever

Fame and fortune - In your eyes
Fame and fortune - Take me higher
Fame and fortune - No more lies
Fame and fortune - Take me higher

Nothing came easy
We've had our fights
Takin our chances, livin our lives
Love could not reveal
Things that you have done
Words that you said

I can't see who I am
Don't you take me as I am
My life that is what I want from you
My heart isn't bound until forever

Fame and fortune - In your eyes
Fame and fortune - Take me higher
Fame and fortune - No more lies
Fame and fortune - Take me higher
