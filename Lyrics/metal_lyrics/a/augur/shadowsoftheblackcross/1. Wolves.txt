Our spark cast a great shadow...
The spark becomes a flame
Within our left hands
And lights his great halls

Imperishable, omnipresent, devourer of cowards

We travel quickly to cross his threshold
Moved by hunger, divine inspiration, and transformation
Wandering in discord and disharmony

Inscribing sigils by gnawing bone
To erect our temple and otherworldly throne
Blazing wolves with flaming jaws
Indwells our lawlessness

Power of solace is transmitted
And our howls are heard through the wind
We lose our forms as our eyes whiten
Creatures of totality
And endless vanity
Sons of Death
Godheads!

Godheads, here to give wailing warning!

We are night
We are silence
We are war
We are strength
We are death

Blurred figures amongst the trees
Hunting by the light of the moon
Or the glorious black sun
This flaming water energizes our bloodline
Through this lifeless forest
To the nethermost gate
At the kingdom of Nod
We rest...
