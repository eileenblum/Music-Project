Eleven!

Wielder of the Trident Torch
Eradicator of the finite forms
Serpent bearer, serpent seed
Destroy the cosmic illusion

Fire-crowned king
Burn all to ash
Holder of the keys to liberation
Venom of God, open eyes of fire!

Mistress of the black moon
Snatch away the Sons of Adam
Mother of tears, weaver of enchantments
Let us follow your ladders of ascent!

Eleven masks made to shift throughout time
Centuries pass in thoughtless divinity
Spiritual enlinkment brings forth the Elevenfold curse

The heads of Azerate and their formless essence
Bearers of the black light!

Activating points of magical altercation
For the liberation of the spirit
Throne seal, seat of power builds foundations
Throne seal, angle key - point of power

Oh seeker of the other side
Communion will bring
Fullfilment upon this path of thoughtless fire
The formulae of the Qliphoth
Is emanated and destroyed
To Naught...
