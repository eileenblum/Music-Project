Darkness descendsUngodly unlightAntichristian storm of evilRaging thunder and lighting Satanas! As the wind spits rainI see horned evilTearing the church buildingBreaking the roof cross upside down NIGHT OF INVERSIONturn the cross upside down Fear in the christian hearton this Satanic stormy nightChurch belongs to Satan nowAs it's cross hangs upside down NIGHT OF INVERSIONCrush the cross - upside down This will stand as a signTriumph of the Dark LordInversion of christianityMajestic dark tyranny
