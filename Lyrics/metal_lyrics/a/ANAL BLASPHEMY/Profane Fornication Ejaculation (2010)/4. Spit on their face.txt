Walking these streets Full of empty peopleForgotten holy pathsAdjusted lifestyle of sin Still I stumble on themthe knights of the weak lambWith the endless joy of loveHope and belief for a place in heaven I SPIT ON THEIR FACE!Looking down on their weaknessSPIT ON THEIR FACE!Triumph in disgust and hate Failing to see their lost causeFaith crumbling to shitPathetic whores like their godDefeated in desecration I SPIT ON THEIR FACE!Hear the cursings on my soulSPIT ON THEIR FACE!Damned and marching onwards
