Transformation, re-formation, desecration
The perverse butterfly is reborn
Through the art of mutilation
Inversed is God's creation

Transformation, deformation, abomination
No longer a man of God
Embodiment of blasphemous modification
Twisted fucking freak of unnature

Transformation, malformation, profanation
The cherished abnormality
And the dogs howl hallelujah
Defiling his gospel with him

Praised perverse butterfly
Under the wrath of God
