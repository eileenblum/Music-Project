Praise of Strength!Weak minds shall perish!Survival of the fittestChosen ones with enlightment of LuciferStrong is praise of selfnot bowing for deitiesAll you lower cunts beneath me!Fuck off and die, decay away Losers of lifeWhining weaklingsTake that knifeTrip to eternity, oblivionAnd avoid of being crushedBy the elite of SatanI recommend eutanausiaAs a bullet in the neckFor all those weaknot smart enough to kill themselves
