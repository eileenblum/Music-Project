Despair lures the demons out of me the hopeless, nameless nightmareThe desire to hear screams that are not my ownTo see blood that is not mineIm your faceless terror Can your god hear you better when you scream?Can your tears wash away your agony?Only one thing could sate this needTo beget your torment and watch your seetheI am the nameless the faceless The hopelessness that drives meAnd the hatred that holds me togetherA disease i fight with every dayAn ailment i feed every nightMakes me the nameless faceless Some feel guilt, I DON'TSome feel remorse, I CAN'TYour terror you could not nameYour fears that had no faceWe'll meet one of these daysAnd you will know my nameAnd you will know my face
