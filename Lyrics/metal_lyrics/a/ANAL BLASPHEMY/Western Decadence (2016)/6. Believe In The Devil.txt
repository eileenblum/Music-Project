They say the Devil's greater power is disbelief
They say that Hell is reserved for the forsaken
But what is this world if not Hell on earth
Realm of true suffering for the human soul

Hear the word of my lord and don't disregard it
Hear as his fallen angels
Blow the trumpets of Armageddon

He is the true adversary and king
His kingdom waits in the purifying flames of eternity

Believe in the Devil

I am a disciple, a noble servant in religious ecstasy
I've felt his presence since my early days of youth
Disbelievers of today can't see my passion
They will see the true divine horror

Believe in the Devil

The Devil has many faces
Many masks, many veils
I am the one to explore, to worship
I am the one who will be his messenger

Believe in the Devil.
