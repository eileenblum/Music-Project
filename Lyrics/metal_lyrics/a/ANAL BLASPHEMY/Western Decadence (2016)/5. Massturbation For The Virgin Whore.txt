From youthful eyes, from youthful times
From the glorification of innocence
A bird of freedom walking to a cage
For the entertainment of the masses

Beauty can be a blessing
But more often a curse
Blessings and curses guide your path
And on this path energies gather towards you

Mass-turbation
Spewing sexual energies towards one soul to taint and ruin
For the virgin whore
Astral rape mutilation the tortured mind in confusion

Teasing with the female sexuality
Your body an instrument of a global erotic spell
This is fresh fruit now turned to sour
Crawling with maggots of lust

Mass-turbation
Spewing sexual energies towards one soul to taint and ruin
For the virgin whore
Astral rape mutilation the tortured mind in confusion

Tearing the veil of felinity
Embracing the visions of insanity
Losing touch with reality
Masses gloat with mockery

Mass-turbation
Spewing sexual energies towards one soul to taint and ruin
For the virgin whore
Astral rape mutilation the tortured mind in confusion

She opens her eye
She is now one with the universe
She has the understanding
She whores on and on.
