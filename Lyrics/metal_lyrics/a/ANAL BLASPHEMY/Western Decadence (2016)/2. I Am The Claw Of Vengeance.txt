Walking on two and despising the four
The one with the self-claimed soul is the fool
His kingdom will crumble and fall
I am the wildernessâ howling call

Turn of the tide, rise of the wild
Back to the primordial law
Unleash the rage, demonic hate
The hunted become the hunters

I am the vengeance, I am the dawn
I am the wildernessâ howling call
I am the hatred, I am the blood
Blood of the mankindâs impending fall

I am the paw of the bear
I am the jaws of the shark
I am the talons of the eagle
I am the claw of vengeance

Cruelest is the one with no humanity
No mercy is granted without emotions
Predatory hunger is the one to dominate
No man made laws will prevent this fate

Turn of the tide, rise of the wild
Back to the primordial law
Unleash the rage, demonic hate
The hunted become the hunters

I am the vengeance, I am the dawn
I am the wildernessâ howling call
I am the hatred, I am the blood
Blood of the mankindâs impending fall

I am the paw of the bear
I am the jaws of the shark
I am the talons of the eagle
I am the claw of vengeance

Violence of the forgotten
Brutality of the conquered
Vengeance of the enslaved
Rise of the dethroned.
