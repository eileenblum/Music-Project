On the peak of progress
Celebration of evolution
Knowledge brings power
Yet dwelling in the deepening ignorance

All barriers fade to non-existent
Perversion and nauseam
Hordes of dull-minded non-believers
Sing in praise of material splendour

Forgotten are the ways of the ancient when cultures were born
Ecstasy of the spiritual blindness is a bliss to embrace
Like a pack of mindless wild instinct driven animals
Masses join the grand orgy of the western decadence

These are the days that bring Sodoma &amp; Gomorrah to a shame
The age of glorified sodomites and sexual deviants
Falling to equality with our 4-legged brethren
Yet sinking so that even they stand above us

Forgotten are the ways of the ancient when cultures were born
Ecstasy of the spiritual blindness is a bliss to embrace
Like a pack of mindless wild instinct driven animals
Masses join the grand orgy of the western decadence

Life is a time of torture in between of toxicated celebrations
There is no meaning other than raping your karma
Fuck this world, join the party, letâs degenerate to animal existence
To breed is to live, to fuck your brain is to breathe

Forgotten are the ways of the ancient when cultures were born
Ecstasy of the spiritual blindness is a bliss to embrace
Like a pack of mindless wild instinct driven animals
Masses join the grand orgy of the western decadence.
