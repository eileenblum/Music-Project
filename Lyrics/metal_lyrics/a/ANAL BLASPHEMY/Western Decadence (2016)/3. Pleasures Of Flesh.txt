Carnal world, carnal desires
To consume, to satisfy
Body of flesh, boundless hunger
Spirit in a cage, must also feed

Bring me that pork, sinful swine
Dripping grease, unholy shine
Gluttony be thy name
Pleasures of Flesh

Dead flesh of the once living
Pleasing me on this feast
Smear myself with pig fat
To keep the Muslim plague away

Bring me that beef, sinful meat
Barbecued to please, now Iâll eat
Gluttony be thy name
Pleasures of flesh

Oh donât give me that shit about ethics
Iâm a ravenous carnivore, hungry beast
Nourishment of the body is energy of the soul
Blessed with flesh is this Satanic feast.
