My Satan is strength and wisdom
The physical and mental excellence to exceed others
And more importantly yourself

My Satan is the darkness of the soul that
Exists in every man, hidden, often denied

My Satan is the God that does not speak in words
But is your tormentor to improve you to a greater self

My Satan is Lucifer, bringer of true light
Fallen Angel to rebel against the impotent god

My Satan is nature, raging and wild, untamed, unleashed
One that man can never truly understand

My Satan is the eternal fire that burns those afraid of it
And ignites those who feel the flames in their hearts

My Satan is the one true Satan behind all ideas of the Devil
Wearing a thousand masks to unveil His true essence
Trembling the foundations of earth.
