Ah yes, the bibleThin paper stuffed heavy with liesBabblings and insane writings, carvingsAssholes high on somethingthen translated a 1000 times by a different fuckerThe basis of this religion!I've seen houses of cards more solid Ah yes, the qur'anDesert rats' written shitpileAbstinence in a new level for sureTowelheads rambling and ravingterrorists, low-life scumfuck your sand prophet of blind visionsmay darkness take you all from Allah I shit on the words of godI shit on the scriptures of the holy All these empty writings and scripturesmake a hellova good toiletpaperThe holiness on their pages feels so warmthe blasphemic defecation ritual!I cover your teachings in excrementsMay my asshole be more pure than your shit propaganda I shit on the words of godI shit on the scriptures of the holy I shit on the words of godI shit on the holy
