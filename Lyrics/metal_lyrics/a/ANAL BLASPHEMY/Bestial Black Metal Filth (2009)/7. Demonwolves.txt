Eyes glinting with evil lustThey come from the mountainsNear the monastery, in the hillsideNuns in the herb farm don't knowThey're already surroundedSoon they'll pray to their god Pack of violent wolfmen attackThey pin the fleeing nuns to the groundWith fangs and claws they rip open the robesNow breasts and vagina exposedMalformed cocks already hardBrutally thrust into quivering virgin cunts They cry and scream for god to hearBut oh no, he isn't even near They've come from the mountains to ravage the landTo rape and desecrate the nunsThey're the Demonwolves under Satan's commandUnholy cum will fill the cunts They've come from the darkness of the woods and the wildsTo molest and to ruin them allThe Demonwolves blessed by the magicks of SatanBlack semen will fill the Earth
