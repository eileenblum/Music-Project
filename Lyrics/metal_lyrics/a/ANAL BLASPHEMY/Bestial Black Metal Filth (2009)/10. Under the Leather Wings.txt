Burning blackSodomized by darknessWandering in the shadowsIn endless times This path will bury me deeperand feed the fireRape my souland tear away all remains of god Forever - under the banner of SatanForever - cursed to darkness and hateFOREVER - I am the flaming torch and Black Metalis the canister of fuel Burning witchBlacker than beforeDon't cross my wayAwaken the great dragonAnd he shall guide me with wrath and revenge When I cease to beand the maggots will feastI wait for the desolate wings of SATANTo carry my soul awayTo the infinite unlightTo the Black shine of Lucifer
