[performed by Anal Blasphemy]Once again a plague
From the southern deserts
Rages wild on the world
And pollutes our free air

I grab my hammer of vengeance
And invert the moon and star
For where shall you bow to
When the city of holy is erased
With nuclear devastation?

In the horder of our lands
Stands the impaled Muslim prophet
Dead and desecrated as your beliefs
A warning sign you should not pass

With my hammer I'll crush your faith
And rape your women in the dark
You will weep in sperm and blood
And in terror watch your God bleed

In the storm of desecration
Bleeds the Muslim prophet
Slain with the iron fist of Satan
Sand turns to the color of triumph

May Islam die together with its believers
May the world belong to its rightful master
Once again...
