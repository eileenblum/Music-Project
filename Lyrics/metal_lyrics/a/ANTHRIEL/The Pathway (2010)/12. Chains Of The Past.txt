Bourned in a place I didn't belong
Surrounded by faces I never used to know
Never used to know

Never learned to trust, never learned to love
I've chained my heart behind cold bars, sealed with scars

An innocent child reaches up to the sky,
He doesn't realize the size of his dreams
Old man always said:
"You can't understand the pain that comes up with a broken dream"

I just have to leave to fullfill my dreams
I just habe to see is out there a task for me

Too long I've been inside these walls,
Too long been trapped behind sealed doors, forevermoore

There's nothing left for my soul to see
I open up the gates and I am finaly free
Finaly free

At one ice cold night, I finally saw a distant
Ship arriving to the shore
Cold tear in her eye, the mother finds a silent
Ship sailing to it's dawn

I just have to leave to fullfill my dreams
I just habe to see is out there a task for me
Is out there a task for me

Chains of the past are fading behind as my
Spirit leads me into my dawn
But how could I leave without a wound in the
Spirit that carries me on

I set my sails at night, a doubt in
Mind as home falls behind.
My journey's just begun,
With head up high I fate this life

I sence a storm drawing near,
Waves keep rising as fear fills
The air
The lightning cracks the sky,
Can't fight it back, just hold on
Tight

Once again I gaze the sunset without a friend
For years I've sought my task to 
Fill my emptyness
I've been so lost on my journey,
I've felt my lonelyness growing
I can't go on but I can't go back
Alone I am flowing in the sea of 
Desperate dreams
The clouds of reality rolling 
After me
Rolling after me

Chains of the past are fading
Behind as my spirit leads me into
My dawn
But how could I leave without a
Wound in the spirit that carries
Me on
Carries me on
Carries me on
Carries me on
Carries me on
