Rage of the wind is calming, the storm is gone at last
Now I see this strange light in the atmosphere

The clouds I've been dragging with me, are finaly far behind me
And for the first time I've done something right

I'm a puppet of divine hands
They spend their time just pulling the strings of my life
Their laughter is all I hear
As they test my fate by inventing traps in my way

But today I won't cry
Today the angels are by my side
Got to live this day that I hopped and prayed
'Cause tomorrow this all might be gone

Let it harden my shield, let it bless my wings
Let it give me the knowledge to see throught the lies
Let it lighten my load in times of despair
Let it give me the strenght to go on, into the light divine

A blink of an azure sky, reminds of what's behind
Now I feel this warmth inside my frozen soul

The chains I was trapped for so long, are nothing
But distant memories
There's nothing in my way misleading me

I've fallen into their traps
I've risen again to thank for the lesson of life
But this time I can't go wrong
Signs are so clear and I've got this feeling inside

They are loosening their strings
Today I fly with the divine wings
Today I can die with a smile I can't hide
I've finally set myself free

Let it harden my shield, let it bless my wings
Let it give me the knowledge to see throught the lies
Let it lighten my load in times of despair
Let it give me the strenght to go on, into the light divine

Divine
