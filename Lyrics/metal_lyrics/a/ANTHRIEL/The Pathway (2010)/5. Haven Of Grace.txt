Give your hand to me
Before I fade away
I feel so weak inside

Heal the scars inside
I need to hide
Then make the curtain fall

I'm flying higher
So much higher than before
Reaching the sky above

Something life hurts
Ways you never felt before
Tears pouring from your soul

How will I carry on
If you fade away
I'm alone in the dark

Won't you take me hand
Give some peace for my poor soul
Guide my way once more

I'm flying higher
so much higher than before
Reaching the sky above

Something life hurts
Ways you never felt before
Tears pouring from your soul

There was a time when I was free within my soul

I want to see
A new dawn rise again
Haven of grace
Have passed aside

I sail towards to the land where dreams
awake...

There's a storm up ahead drawing near
Full of power and rage, rising fear

I'm holding on to my life by a thread
Waves rising so high, the end is near

I want to see
A new dawn rise again
Haven of grace
Have passed aside

A new dawn rise again
Haven of grace
Have passed aside
Haven of grace...
