A memory from my past
Reminds me what I once had
Countless days I've searched for something
To remind me who I was then

Now alone I walk the pathway
Newer knowing where I'm heading for
Yet still I'm searching for something
To fill this emptyness within

A scenery from my future
Reminds me what I've done wrong
Countless years I've searched for something
To guide me on my way

Still alone I walk the pathway
Newer knowing what I'm searching for
Yet still I'm waiting for something
To fill this emptyness within

It calls my name
Carries me far from pain
Angel of night beside me
As it shelters my state of grace again,
Come what may...

A glance into a mirror
Reveals me who I am now
Countless days I've searched for something
Which has always been inside of me

It calls my name
Carries me far from pain
Angel of night beside me
As it shelters my state of grace again,
Come what may...

It calls my name
Carries me far from pain
Angel of night beside me
As it shelters my state of grace again,
Come what may...
Come what may...
