This life has stoned my fallen tears,
To the path I grumble everyday
Runnin' throught the rolling stones,
Away from the shades of gray

Controversial euphoria
Rushing throught my head
The last piece of humanity
Hanging by a thread

All this time I wanted night to take me
Far away in it's soothing grace,
But now the time I must leave the shadows
Of night behind, come the day

I'm crawling on my knees
Under thy clouds
Gazing up to the sky

So lost within myself
Purifying rain will fall
Wash away this pain

Taken away from my safe and sound cell,
Where I sheltered my poor soul
Lost inside this delirium
Will I be safe out here?

Trapped inside this panic
I nearly lost myself again
The last scent of security,
Like the dust in the wind

All this time I wanted night to take me
Far away from this hellish pain
But now's the time when I must leave the shadows
Of night behind, come the day

I'm crawling on my knees
Under thy clouds
Gazing up to the sky

So lost within myself
Purifying rain will fall
Wash away this pain

Rain falls, let it wash away my pain
Bring a new dawn, where all my fears have gone away

Let the rain fall, let it wash away my pain
Bring a new dawn, where all my fears have gone away

Come the day
