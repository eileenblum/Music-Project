Fallen angels
The rite of an ancient calling
The cry of the desperate, crawling alone

Locked inside
The maze of athousand labyrinths
This twisted minds delirium

Now the darkest night draws near,
As the souls keep on drifting
To the edge of this world
Trying to find some peace within

Useless slaying
The madness within is rising
Invisible chaos raging inside

Without warning
The madness within is rising
Invisible chaos raging inside

Now the darkest night is here,
As the souls keep on falling
To that other world
Trying to find a riason for living

Falling to the other side of their divided minds
Circling the turbulent waves, of their dark divided minds

Falling to the other side of their divided minds
Circling the turbulent waves, of their dark divided minds
