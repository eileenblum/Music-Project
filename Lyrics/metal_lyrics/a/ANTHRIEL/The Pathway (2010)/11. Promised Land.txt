Adventurer I am, like any other man
I'd like to be proud of my past
Tools of life in hand,
I search for promised land
To settle down in peace at last.

Once a king a fool for a lifetime
I paid my prize and paid it with pride
People change as they grow old
I refuse until my world is whole

I'm still on my way, but closer day by day
To the land where dreams awake
I'm still on my way,
For years I've searched the way,
Into the land where dreams awake

Most ignore my path,
Some spit their hate in my back
A few have seen behind my mask
Tools of life in hand I search
The promised land
To build a future from my past

Divine or not it's all I got
I followed the signs right from the start
I trust my fate into your hands
To lead me out from my deserted mind

I'm still on my way, but closer day by day
To the land where dreams awake
I'm still on my way,
For years I've searched the way,
Into the land where dreams awake
Into the land where dreams awake

I'm still on my way
I'm still on my way, but closer day by day
To the land where dreams awake
I'm still on my way,
For years I've searched the way,
Into the land where dreams awake
