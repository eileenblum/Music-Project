Reflecting mirror shows a man
His empty look and filthy hands
The broken picture of his plans
Lies on his feet in splinters

The face reminds me of a boy
Who was always filled with light and joy
He seized the day he got with pride
Keeping fragile hopes so high

He never learned to live
Between this world and his daydreams
Now the child has turned into a beast
Fragile mind and yield into the sin

Every door was open wide
His future shining bright
What faded light out of his azure eyes?

He left doors open wide
Attractions caught his mind
Shadows are dancing devil's lullaby

Stuck in his comfort fantasies
Twisted mind sealed from reality
There's no way out that he could see
Now shadows whisper what will be

Cold piece of metal in his hands
He stares and wants to understand
Is that reflection really me
Or just my minds created beast

Mirror reflects the fact
The closing door behind his back
Now the child has turned into a beast
Fragile mind and yield into the sin

Every door was open wide
His future shining bright
What faded light out of his azure eyes?

He left doors open wide
Attractions caught his mind
Shadows are dancing devil's lullaby

Every door was open wide
His future shining bright
What faded light out of his azure eyes?

He left doors open wide
Attractions caught his mind
Shadows are dancing devil's lullaby
