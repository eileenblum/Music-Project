Middle age the sword is the law,obscure theocracy of darkness and fear
In france they clame the carnage,in the name of baphometic god they shall kill

Kill all the muslims till the last man.
his women most be ripped and children slaved.
to the glory of thirst blood god.
mountains of skulls in the holy land

Eleventh century knight of the templar,fanatic monks of war assassins priests
Satanic blodshed for godâs pride,Jerusalem was the cursed land and grave from them all

The slaughter is not enough,blade need much more fuck heads
This is the brutal kingdom of terror,the dark kingdom of two throusand years

The black cross is his symbol of faith and death,the down of a new age of eternal war and theocracy madness.
