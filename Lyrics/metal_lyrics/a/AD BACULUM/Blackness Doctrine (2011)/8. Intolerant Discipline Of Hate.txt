We are the true believers of Power and Black metal might
We will born this town to the ground there is anger in my heart
Tyrants of underworld intolerant discipline of hate

Come see the delightful land of baphometic goat inside
Marching in the streets with leather and metal
Living as hellbanger till end of days grind without mercy all posers in the way

Looking for meat to eat the assholes and wimps
Love to put a bullet in your fucking heads
Hell breaks loose bloody lord of chaos
Leave behind the streets no witness alive

Your soul will be consumed and make peace apart
Speed demos warriors wants cut your throat
Hell patrol unleashed crushing bones merciless
Destroy the enemies one by one, one shoot one kill.
