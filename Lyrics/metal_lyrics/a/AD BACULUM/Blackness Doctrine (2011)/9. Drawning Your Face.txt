Blood Roman game Shell Begin to witness delight
Before fight two mens choice your weapons
Only one survive in the carnage hole
The smell of death around the air coliseum

Hammer versus blade begin choque himself
Die with honor and donât clame for mercy
Inside the walls only groly of death prevails
A brain smashed by hammer finished the first fight

The cry of crow thrist blood,another mutilated warrior falls
Breaking bones before open you head apart, one heart still beating showed to all see

Gradiators barberians dogs of war, intense brutality of blood sport game
The collector will drowning another face with pleasure
Piles of skulls without face let to rot inglorious
