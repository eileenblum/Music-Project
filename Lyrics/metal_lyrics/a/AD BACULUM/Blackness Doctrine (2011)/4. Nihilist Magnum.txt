Through the darkest hell weâre here to Hunter all enemies
Armed till the teeth with powerful guns and blades
.44 magnum opening fire out all in sight
One shoot tear your head apart,dark crusade of metal brigade

The art of killing sending your fucking soul to hell
In the night thereâs no escape
Another victim dies into the pandemonium
Fooled blood flows like rain

Submission or death it is the choice, Moving fast and killing all we can
Take no prisoners in fight only bloody cadavers,
the sound of .44 magnum the rage of steel gods

As the war rages the humans pigs are destroyed,now all know the end is near
Motherfuckers running panic within a black void
.44 magnum take you as fast to meet satan in hell.
