In brutal European Middle Age rules genocide 
Hallowed be thy name Knights templarian soldiers 
Rotting corpses lying in the cemeteries of battlefield 
Consumed by hate I'll drink the blood of the enemies 
I will shit on your dead face and lacerated body 
I want to see your suffering before horrible death 
Carnage in the holy temple Muslims headless cadavers. 
Don't wait for the saviour
You'll never see the day 
Storm troopers of death!
It's too late
Run riper strikes back to kill you all.
My cold hart and cruel eyes are full of hate. 
Storm troopers in brutal land we live and die by the sword 
Elimination without mercy and village devastation 
Showing the planet the real war lord of chaos 
No one can save to live another day. 
Killing in cold blood till the last one 
Those who die by my steel will fell the power of barbaric hoards.
