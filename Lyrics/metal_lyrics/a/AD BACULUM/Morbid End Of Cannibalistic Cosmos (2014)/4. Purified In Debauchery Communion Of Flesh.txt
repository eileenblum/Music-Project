In nomine dei nostri Satanas...
Luciferi excelsi!

Concupiscence engulfs me in mysterious emptiness.
Commandments shall burn with your congregationâ¦
Contagious disease of jaws, arrogant fanaticism.

The semen within eclodes 
And spreads the organic chaos 
Drink the vaginal holy blood 
Purified in baculous communion 

Natural order engulfed by theological cancerâ¦
Corruption of church putrefaction of malign templeâ¦
Innocence has been destroyed, lies spoken in tonguesâ¦
I deny salvation, the irrational absurd.

Oppressive presence the loss of spiritual freedomâ¦
Archaic inspiration sacrilegical lies of the holy bookâ¦
Concupiscence the mark of the beast, amen!
Voluptuous penis of Baal the sacred communion of fleshâ¦

Blessed are the dead â those who rest in disobedience 
Universal damnation redeemer of mankind's obscurantism
Catholical dogmatic hate against freedom of the will
Heretic deuterocanonical books
The prophecy of contradictionâ¦
Roman apostolic tradition 
Abomination followed without hesitationâ¦
Macabre ecumenical councils scripture builded in flesh and blood.
