Desolated and frenetic intensity of cannibalistic cosmos
The power that creates it in eternal circle and self-destruction 
Divine beginning in extension whose devour into a dark uterus
The obscurity splendor outbreaks the ultimate paradigm.
Like almighty serpent of 7 heads the ancient nameless born again
Macrocopus immaterial entity â the annihilation of everything.

Obscure phenomenon destroying life in the cosmos
In the end of time there will be not substances and atomic fragments
Remains in astral desert â the equilibrium of chaotic lifeless
The pestilence of all creatures will disappear forever

No order or purpose for the universal desolation circle 
Retrograde laws spread around the essence of shadows

Nihilistic destiny of all substances and foetid life procreation
No remembrances or past: everything ends in morbid collapse 

[Repeat 1 and 2]

Nothing has any sense or connection, it is the final point, obviously
The fate of nonsense homo sapiens civilization â predestination to extinction
Harmony of lifeless silence, a glacial emptiness.
Chaos restore the universal order without organic life.
