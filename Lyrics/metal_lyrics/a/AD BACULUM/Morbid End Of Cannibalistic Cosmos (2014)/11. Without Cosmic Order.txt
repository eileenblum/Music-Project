The ghost wanders arising from annihilation 
Nihilistic nature of absolute power 
Reigning in the depths of chaos without bio-life trace
The splendor of the obscene and unlight dimension
Extreme wring.
Bizarre echo sound.
Nuclear collision.
Lifeless molecular.
Magnificence power spreading annihilation in darkness
It's absurd and make no sense to limited human mind
Mistaken perceptions of homo-sapiens about hell horizon
We're worms whose existence disease the cosmic design

Negative force without trace of primitive life.
Lord of emptiness the essence of eternal night engulfs light
Neutron essence spreading dangerous vibrations in death form
Phantasmagoric horizon the obscure mystery
