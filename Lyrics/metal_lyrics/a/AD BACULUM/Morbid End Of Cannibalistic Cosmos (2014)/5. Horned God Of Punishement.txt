Feel on flesh the scepter of damnation and bloody steel.
I see you end with morbid delight and satisfaction.
The poisonous hate fall above apostolic dogma.
Demons with cruel eyes outbreak the hell's legion.

[Chorus:]
Horned God of Punishment delightfully
Steal your soul.
In the cannibalistic abyss prevails the lamentation and eternal night.
The odious essence destroying false hope of heaven.

Faceless demons of underworld spreading the true Gospel.
Hear the tenebrous voice of might majesty.
Luciferian opposition now fell the purgatory desolation.

[Chorus]

In blackened reign of tears you will never rise to light and life.
There is no way back to lacerated souls in torment. 
Hell's fire will burn those who blasphemy against me. 

I'm Baphometic Goat the master of this world.

[Chorus]
