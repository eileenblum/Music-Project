Semitic lies will be banned from the world foreverâ¦
They infest the world with filth theologyâ¦
And now they will pay for all their crimesâ¦
Purifying the world against hysterical abraamic theocracy.

Rise!
The chalice with blood and celebrate the wisdom of archaic spiritsâ¦
The holy ghost of all fevers and plaguesâ¦
We rise the chalice
Wine and laughter of your dead godâ¦
We are worshippers of the thelemic serpent of seven headsâ¦
I could feel abysmal wisdom and chaotic power around meâ¦
I was freezing but I don't fear you.
I've kept the cabbalistic mysteries.
The majestic vision of infinite cosmosâ¦
Too much impossible for human comprehensionâ¦
I was the chosen one and can understand the purposeâ¦
There is no more secrets between us because I am now mixed with your essenceâ¦
Hallelujah chaos!
Negative power will never dies and lives through the millenniumâ¦
In my dreams I could hear the voice of strange languagesâ¦
I can see the manifestation of the almighty forceâ¦
Blackness doctrine against the failed homo sapiens' civilizationâ¦
Hallelujah chaos!
