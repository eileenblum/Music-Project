Crucified and beheaded.
Devoured merciless by demons.
Obliterate the holy ghost.
Followers blinded meet their end.

[Chorus:]
The messiah rotting in the gates of heaven.
Eradication catholic delirium.
Angelic bloodshed suffering and pain.
Horrific prophecies in paradiseâ¦ 
Satanic retaliation divine sufferingâ¦
Catastrophic rebellion and tortured soulsâ¦
Demonic creatures
Disintegrating bodiesâ¦
Reincarnate evil spirit the hell goatâ¦

[Chorus]

Brutal butchering and chaotic visionsâ¦
Maggots crawl mortify them allâ¦
Flesh and blood manifestation into pentagramâ¦
By the Hammer of Satan
Darkness reign supreme.

[Chorus]

Your devotion in false dogma and idolâ¦
Blind sheep will feel the desolationâ¦
Satan proudly sits on the throneâ¦
There's no redemption to Jesus Christ the dead God 

[Chorus]
