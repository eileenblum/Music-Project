Sinister Roman unholy liturgy.
Shine us night spirits of immortality.
Ancient fallen angel of damnation.
Feel the hell's gates open now. 

Caesar allegiance shall be glorious.
Caligula impetuous rage the triumph of madness. 

Human devoured by beast in Coliseum.
Fucking disciples burn till annihilation. 
Blessed are centurions the Christ killers.
Soldiers of luxurious prince of hell. 
Rotting on the grave of maggots.
Rigor mortis deterioration steal your lifeâ¦
In human flesh their name was cursed in sins,
Sacrilegious conception eternal doomâ¦ 
Caligula soldiers show no mercy.
The destroyers of Jew's temple.
In torment hills the sacred blood flows
The false messiah was killed in cross.
God is dead and we kill him.
