Triumph of fallen angels 
Celestial bloodshed 
Consumed by flames 
By the Hammer of Satan.
Burning down the church of atrocity. 
Desolation in paradise.
Obliteration of heaven tyranny. 
Hail Lucifer! 
Death to god the enemy of beautiful and human nature.
The last seraphim is dead
Before claim for mercy.
Headless cadaver of god shall fall from the heaven 
Slaughter and death to fooled weak worshipers 
Your tears and blood.
Is wine for my chalice 
The prophecy was completed.
They can't resist the power from hell.
Hail Lucifer!
