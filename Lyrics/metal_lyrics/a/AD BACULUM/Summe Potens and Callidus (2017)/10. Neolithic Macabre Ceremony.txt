Neolithic macabre ceremony
Moloch want child sacrifice
Killed in cold blood

The servant wants to die
In honor of the gods and his master
To live in the afterlife

His remains will be devoured
The whole tribe will consume your flesh
Dead skulls on the altar
Thousands must be killed
Knife on the throat
Red blood drips in the bowl
Entombed in the walls
Immolation in sacrificial hill
Archaeological evidence
Ritualistic decapitation
