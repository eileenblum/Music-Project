I'm the creator of wickedness
I'm the malevolent god
Everyone should be humiliated before me
I demand the sacrifice of your children

Omnipotent evil genius
The creator of malignancy
Master of deception
Lord of uncertainty

Suffering and despair I spread the world
I want to hear your cries for forgiveness
I have the illusion of after life paradise
I reign by terror and the doubts

I control all of you for deception
I hate my own imperfect creation
Keeping the light of wisdom buried
Keeping the world an obscure grave
