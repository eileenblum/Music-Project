Paradoxical existence
God does not care about the man
Faith the illusion of the fools
There is no heaven and the afterlife

God can to prevent evil but unable?
God is able, but without desire?
God is not able to do it?
So god is own evil in the world.

Only sense of fear and despair
Old questions with irrational arguments
Zombified from birth to death
Builds its inner wall as jail

Then he is not omnipotent.
Then he is malevolent god.
