Outside our solar system
Paranormal emanations of the underworld
Breaking physical laws
Hidden forces of the unknown

Primitive manifestation form
Annihilate all matter in the universe
Cellular life unbalances the cosmos
The countdown to extinction is near

Pathetic lifetime
Insignificant existence
Parasitic life form
Returning to the dust

Incinerated by cosmic radiation
Entropy melancholic evidence
Closing the cycle to emptiness
