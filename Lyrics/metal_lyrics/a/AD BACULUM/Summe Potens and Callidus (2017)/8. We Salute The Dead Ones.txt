We salute the dead with full glasses
Rain and thunder follows us on the road
Leather dresses we accelerate 'til hell
Riding horses of steel and guns holstered

We salute the dead ones
In memory of all who died on two wheels
Another beer and shots we salute those who die
We have built our own paradise and hell in this place

Our dead friends are waiting for us proudly
We do not fear the devil every day he rides with us
Tattoos on the skin and sound loud engines
Fuck you all the assholes who do not like our way

Every drink old remember and salute the dead warriors
Never break the chain
The legacy of the past remains strong
The true covenant of the skull
Forever strong as steel
