I hate you deceiver god.
I hate their falsehood.
Do not try to seduce me.
My soul belongs to hell.

You is a cold and absent god.
You turned your back on the mankind.

Hopeless fools seek your mercy.
I woke up a terrible nightmare.

You can not see the evil.
You can not make yourself.
You live in the memory of the past.
You was a bad dream for all mankind.
