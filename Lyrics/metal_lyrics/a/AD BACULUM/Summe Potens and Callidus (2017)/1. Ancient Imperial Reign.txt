Ancient imperial reign
Age of iron and blood
Not monotheistic civilization
Guided by conquest and plunder

No place for wimps and cowards
Assyrian empire built on bones
Riding fast black horses
Steel swords cutting heads unmercifully

Destroying and burning villages on the way
Reign of terror in the Middle East
Assyrians prisoners are skinned alive
