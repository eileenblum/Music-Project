Bloodlust and orgiastic massacres
Consuming all internal parts
Guiding the souls to paradise
Murderes consuming their victims

Some degree of sexual satisfaction
The compulsion to eat human flesh
Widespread among ancient cultures
Post=mortem dismemberment in funeral rites

Their enemies were eating till the bones,
digesting the flesh and the defecated

Butchered humans.....
Scalped skulls....
Roast beef.....
Bloody feast....

Woman miscarries devour the abortive
Consumed children by their own parents
To symbolise unification with a higher power
The sacrament of the human carcass
