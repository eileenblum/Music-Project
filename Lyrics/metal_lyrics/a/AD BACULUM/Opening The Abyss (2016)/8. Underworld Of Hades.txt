Dead souls wander in his kingdom
He is associated with darkness and obscure
Only the penitent man crossed his realm
In afterlife land all his past is revealed

Elysium where the blessed heroes may dwell
Tartarus the place reserved to fooled one
Acheron the deceased come crossing
Styr forms the line between the two worlds.

Only blood sacrifice can reawaken them
Your dread kingdom causes terrible fear
