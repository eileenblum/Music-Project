War Lord army is read to kill
In this full moon satan night
The church of atrocity will burn
They all will die and beheaded

We have our delightful vengeance
Against all religious pigs
They will pay in hell for his sins

Inside my head demons takes control
Mentally insany I will make the work
Chapel full of blood will burn tonight

Black Metal against the brainwashing
Satan take my mind with pure hate
Hellbanguers Legion clame for blood
The children of the Antichrist came to stay
