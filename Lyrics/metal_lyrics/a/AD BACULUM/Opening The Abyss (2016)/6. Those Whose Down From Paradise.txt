They deliberately build rebellion in Heaven
Mens and fallen angels become like God
Why I created human beings?
God prostrate himself and ask

They can choose and became
God itself
Having free will angelic and demonic blood

God canÂ´t meddle with the human world
But the Heaven was doomed and Destroyed

The Fallen Angels and Humans became like one
God admits his terrible mistake
The primal master was exiled forever
Lucifer and his domain is now complete
