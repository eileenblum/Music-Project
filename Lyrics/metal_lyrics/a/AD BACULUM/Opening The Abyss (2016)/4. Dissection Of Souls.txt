Oh Lord cast your evil light on us
We have sharp sword into fists
We do not feat death because
she walks with us
And the end the meat is stronger
than steel

Give us the strenght to kill them all
Because the night is dark
and full of terrors
Oh Lord accept our blood sacrifice
Oh Lord We are forged in the war carnage

Delight with the sound of sword in shock
I have the head of my enemy in my hands
We will drink wine in their skulls dried
Their souls will burn in hell at the stake
