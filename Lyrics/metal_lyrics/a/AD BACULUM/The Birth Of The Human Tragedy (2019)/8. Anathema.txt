Excommunication of the lost souls
You must bleed in the name of God.
You must pay cash for salvation.
You can not disobey the church authorities.
Burn at the stake!
Monasteries the houses of madness and abominations
Sexual immorality is hidden behind the walls
The dogma and holy tradition of the church
Give your soul to the master
Systematic persecution and theocratic intolerance
Sacramental orthodoxy of religious fanatics
Penitent must shed his blood by faith
Apostasy must burn at the stake of heresy
You must suffer for your sins!
Burn at the stake!
