Now I'm leaving this melancholy world.
I do not want a named grave
There will be no more memories
Crying and suffering have been in the past

A pale lifeless and cold figure
My hard body shell belongs to the worms.
Smell of putrefaction and flowers
Returning to the womb of the earth

Vision in the garden of naked dead
I'm in love with you Mrs. Death
Surround me with your arms
I'm listening your macabre symphony
