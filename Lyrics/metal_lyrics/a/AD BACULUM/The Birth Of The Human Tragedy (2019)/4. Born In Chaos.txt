I am the one whose previous book
I bring plagues and death to all mankind.
I am the one wrought in the fire of hell.
In the shadows waiting for doomsday

I'm not made of flesh and blood.
I have reigned since the beginning of time.
I'm emerging from chaos now.
To make your world into ashes.

Outside the nihilistic dimension.
The last kingdom of desolation.
Annihilating all life forms of the universe.
Your prayers will not be heard.
