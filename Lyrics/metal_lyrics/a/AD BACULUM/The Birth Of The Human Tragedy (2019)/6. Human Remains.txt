A rotten body infested by maggots
There is no more human form
I will unpack your carcass
I love looking into your dying eyes.
Your skull now belong to me

Coffin violated and profaned
Vision of pure atrocity
I need your remains.

Sinister phantasmagoric manifestation
Evil spirits speak through the dead
Bones and skulls along with candles
Remembered voodoo ritual of the past

Now you know it's a human garbage.
I'll use your mortal remains.
My rituals need bones and blood
I do not feel remorse for this...
I'm so sorry!
