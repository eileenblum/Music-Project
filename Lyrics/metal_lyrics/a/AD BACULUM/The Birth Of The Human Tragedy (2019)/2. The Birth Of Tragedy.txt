Watching the human misery
Slowly falling into their graves
Feel the emptiness of existence
Only legacy of pain and suffering
(The birth of tragedy)

The curse of denial of life
Dreadful tragedy of mankind
Slave from the womb to death
Feeding on fantasy

Always behind happiness
Like hungry butchers
Life is a natural mistake
Biological existential illusion

This fallen empty world
No hope for the promised land
Close your eyes and embrace the darkness
