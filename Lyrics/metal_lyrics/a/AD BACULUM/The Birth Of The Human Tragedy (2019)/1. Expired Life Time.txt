Deadly disease reaps my body
Malignant biological life form
Bacteriological infestation
My last hours of life

Do not cry for me
Now it's too late for this
I'm on a trip with no return.
Maybe I'll find you somewhere.

Putrefaction spreads over my body
Rigor mortis. It is my last night
The world belongs to the parasites
The mortal remains must be cremated

There are no friends at the funeral
My rotten body shell burn
The flames must take away all the evil
Melancholic destination....
