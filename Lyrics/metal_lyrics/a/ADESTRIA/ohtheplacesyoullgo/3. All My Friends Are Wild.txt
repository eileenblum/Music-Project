They call me wild thing, wild thing
Vines and trees, replace my walls
And oceans fill my floors

I sail through day, i sail through night
I sail right through that open door
And in and out of weeks, almost over a year now,
To where the wild things are

Terrible roars, terrible eyes,
Terrible teeth, terrible claws

Oh!

All my friends are wild!

They say "Oh please dont go,
We'll eat you up. we love you so.
Oh please dont go,
We'll eat you up. we love you so"

Be still!

They call me the king of all wild
Be still,
They call me the king of all wild
Be still,
They call me the king of all wild

Be still [2x]

We'll eat you up. we love you so

Far across the sea, into the day and into the night
Far across the sea, into the day and into the night
Far across the sea...
