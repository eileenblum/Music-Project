Dreamer, Dreamer,
You've got your head in the clouds!

Let's go!

Dreamer.

These hands use to shake
Under all the weight of past
Mistakes I thought I made

But see how calm, no trembling palm,
I steadied the pen long ago
But at what cost, what have I lost

These words lost their teeth,
They cut my mouth
And made my gums bleed

But I kept them in,
Couldn't spit them out,
No not again,
No not this time
And I swallowed all their knives

I hope you never forget me,
I hope you never forget me

I could have been the one!

I could have been the one to knock you down where you belong
I could have been the one to knock you down where you belong
I could have been the one to knock you down where you belong

These words lost their teeth,
They cut my mouth
And made my gums bleed

But I kept them in,
Couldn't spit them out,
No not again,
No not this time
And I swallowed all their knives

All their knives!

Pick it up!
