Look into my eyes!

Wake up wake up, get out of your bed
Leave your town, see the world,
Love the life that you live

Wake up! Wake up!

Live until you cant
Scale those mountains, sail the seas
All we have are the memories
Tomorrows not a guarantee

When you're on the ground,
Your goals can seem so far away
Step by step, one at a time, make me proud boys,
It's time to shine

Don't let them take that from, you
Pay no attention to the jackals you'll find,
They've given up they've all been let behind

Don't hope for karma or the stars to align,
Look into yourself find something inside
Stay young, grow old, don't be distracted
The fame, the gold, Its all worthless

Live until you cant
Scale those mountains, sail the seas
All we have are the memories
Tomorrows not a guarantee

You only get one chance to prove that you're worth something
and people will try to take that away,
And we say, and we say
Get out while you can, take your scrapes
And take your bruises
Get out while you can, love your scars,
You fucking earn them
Get out while you can, take your scrapes
And take your bruises
Get out while you can, love your scars,
You fucking earn them
Get out while you still can,
Take your scrapes and take your bruises

Get out! Get out!

Look into my eyes.
