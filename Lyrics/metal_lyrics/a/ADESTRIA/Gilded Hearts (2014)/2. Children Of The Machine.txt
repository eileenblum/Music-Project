We're a nation of expectations, entitled children who have more than most.
Gluttons with an insatiable greed who feel entitled to the wealth of their fathers ghost.
Our grasp surpassed by our reach. Our ends don't justify the means.
Copy and pasting what we're told, instead of thinking on our own.
There's no more common sense. There's only indifference.
Everyone wants a helping hand, but when the role is reversed we put our heads in the sand.
What has become of us? United in fear, divided by mistrust.
Taking what we feel we deserve. Motives hide like wolves in the herd.
Ostracize those who don't agree. Vilified by fraudulent decree.
Copy and pasting what we're told, instead of thinking on our own.
There's no more common sense. There's only indifference.
Everyone wants a helping hand, but when the role is reversed we put our heads in the sand.
What has become of us? United in fear, divided by mistrust.
We're no longer individuals. We're all part of the plan.
We are the infernal machine. Fueled by oil and driven by greed.
We are the all seeing eye. Scorching the earth and burning the sky.
Have we forgotten what separates us from the beasts?
Are we too complacent to bite the hand that feeds?
