This is where I belong. It may not always feel right, but it never feels wrong.
I appreciate everything you do, this gift you've given me, this dream you've helped me pursue.
This life that I lead is not something that I want, it's something that I need.
Without this I'd be lost. That's not to say that I've found my way, but I'm starting to see through the fog.
That doesn't mean that' I've learned anything about who I'm supposed to be,
but in this moment all that matters is that I'm free.
I am free. I am free to be me.
I found a home, the only place that I don't feel alone. (found my security)
Without this I'd be lost. That's not to say that I've found my way, but I'm starting to see through the fog.
That doesn't mean that' I've learned anything about who I'm supposed to be.
This is who I'm supposed to be.
When even home feels strange, this is my escape, a thousand miles away. (I am free)
A place I can hide from the weight of the world and the vices inside. (I am free)
This life that I lead is not something that I want, it's something that I need.
Without this I'd be lost. That's not to say that I've found my way, but I'm starting to see through the fog.
That doesn't mean that' I've learned anything about who I'm supposed to be
