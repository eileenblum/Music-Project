Ignorance is bliss.
How many chances do we need to turn the tides? Instead of living we're just striving to survive.
We're all smiles. Ignorance is bliss. I don't want to live like this.
Don't let them make your choices for you. They're making choices that we can't undo.
We saw the clouds roll in. They said there's no storm within. Just watch the screen, it will be over soon.
They told us not to take shelter from the rain, but then we wonder why we washed away.
We eat up their lies, do what we're told. We're accustomed to a sugar-coated world.
We're so scared that things aren't what they seem, we let those fucking liars tell us what to believe.
How many chances do we need to turn the tides? Instead of living we're just striving to survive.
We're all smiles. Ignorance is bliss. I don't want to live like this.
We tune in so they can feed us hope. There's nothing wrong as long as we don't know.
We refuse to question because we're scared of the answers.
Our eyes are open, but we look away. We'd prefer to be distracted than see the world for what it is today.
My eyes are open.
My eyes are open.
A gilded world is all I see, but gold can't hide what's underneath.
