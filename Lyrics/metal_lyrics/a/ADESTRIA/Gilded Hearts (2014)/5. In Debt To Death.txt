White knuckle grip on the world, and we're not letting go.
Never living outside of the moment, we're young and out of control.
We cut the strings and set ourselves free. We are a dying breed.
In debt to death, we live, and whether seconds or years we all pay, we'll pay in the end.
So we live at the edge just to see how close we can get, so when we're put in the ground we'll have no regrets.
We stand above the soil, because we're not finished yet.
Like the flame of a candle we live on borrowed time, so we burn quick and burn bright.
Youth is a commodity that you can't take to your grave. If you don't spend it all then it's taken away.
We cut the strings and set ourselves free. We are who we want to be.
In debt to death, we live, and whether seconds or years we all pay, we'll pay in the end.
So we live at the edge just to see how close we can get, so when we're put in the ground we'll have no regrets.
We stand above the soil, because we're not finished yet.
No one looks back in time, when they're frail and thin, on how quiet their life was and how safe they'd been.
Cut the strings and set yourself free.
In debt to death, we live, and whether seconds or years we all pay, we'll pay in the end.
So we live at the edge just to see how close we can get, so when we're put in the ground we'll have no regrets.
