Look at my life, tell me what do you see.
Someone that's given up, or someone that still believes?
I find meaning in what you try to avoid. You've come to build it up, but I've come to destroy.
I go through life one day at a time. I'm at piece with the filth and the grime.
No possessions, but Ive seen the world. I smashed the oyster and found my own pearl.
We don't live for the future, and we aren't held back by our past, We are uncommon trash.
We don't live according to your plan. You can't judge what you don't understand.
You live your life in constant fear. We took a hammer to your standards. We don't need them here.
We don't live for the future, and we aren't held back by our past, We are uncommon trash.
You don't matter here. I'm not concerned with what you think of me.
I don't matter here. I'm not concerned with what you think of me.
We don't matter here. I'm not concerned with what you think of me.
Nothing matters here. I'm not concerned with what you think of me.
We don't live for the future, and we aren't held back by our past, We are uncommon trash.
We're not going anywhere.
