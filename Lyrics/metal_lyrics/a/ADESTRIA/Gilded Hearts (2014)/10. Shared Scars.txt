There's no hope, no goals. It's like we've lost all control. No meaning. No dreams.
It's like we've lost any reason to be.
You get so sure that it's the end that you forget to try. You forget to live.
You've seen the worst, thought there was nothing left. You've felt alone, felt left for dead.
But we have been there too. We've seen the walls close in, the light leave the room.
We've seen the world turn their backs, turn their backs on me.
We've been through far too much just to give up now. Life is too uncertain to be sure that things won't change.
Don't wait for your life just to happen.
But we have been there too. We've seen the walls close in, the light leave the room.
We've seen the world turn their backs, but the fact that we all share this bond
Is all the strength that I need to keep moving on.
To prove to them that I won't remain on the ground.
All of us have been knocked down before. Use the strength of each other to get off of the floor.
You're not alone. We know who you are. We all have the same scars.
So when you've lost the will to carry on, know the night is darkest before the dawn.
You can't carry the weight of the world on your own.
