When it began, this was a place for the outcasts with nowhere to call their home.
It was about a release. The world ceased. It was a shelter from the outside.
Now it's about the moves you make. Now it's about the games you play.
It's not about the dedication. It's about the industry.
You chose the lie over honesty. You put the hype before integrity.
Take me back to the days of honest hearts. It was about the passion. It was about the art.
(Take me back)
Now it's your image and who you know instead of talent that defines your growth.
(Take me back)
We had to learn from our stumbles and falls, when it was all so beautifully flawed.
It used to be about expressing your mind, but now that message is harder and harder to find.
You're more concerned with what they'll think then truly saying anything.
What once was pure, you tainted. Indifference, you've created.
Now gimmicks lead to fame. Now everybody sounds the same.
You chose the lie over honesty. You put the hype before integrity.
Take me back to the days of honest hearts. It was about the passion. It was about the art.
(Take me back)
Now it's your image and who you know instead of talent that defines your growth.
(Take me back)
We had to learn from our stumbles and falls, when it was all so beautifully flawed.
Take me back to the days of honest hearts. Take me back to when the passion fueled the art.
