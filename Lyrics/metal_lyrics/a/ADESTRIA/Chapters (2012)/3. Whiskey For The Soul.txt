I've used your trust for target practice, and I used your lust to fulfill mine.
The buzzards pick at names I used to know, but my path is set and I will die alone.
You should've ran me out when you had the chance, but now I'm here to stay.
The man in black said "Boy don't take your guns to town" but I've never been one to listen to reason, this heart, this act of treason.
I gave my soul to this steel, because the dead can feel no guilt.
Gave purpose to the lifeless, to fill what can't be filled.
I'll peak through broken fingers, attempt to slant my view,
amazed by their indifference, but I knew just what they'd do.
They'll leave a hole in your chest before they lay you to rest.
This town will never be the same.
I've used your trust for target practice, and I used your lust to fulfill mine.
I wanted you to know the truth. This is what I was born to do.
I can't explain what goes through my head, but when the dust clears, you'll all be dead.
It was the guns. It was the guns, so wipe the stain from off my hands and see what they've done.
It was the guns. It was the guns, so wipe the stain from off my hands and see what I've done.
I can feel them start to betray.
I can feel them start to aim my way.
