Welcome to the show.
Please don't look at me, I can't bear to show you what's underneath.
you wear a mask to shield us from who you really are.
It's no surprise they idolize you, they think it's true that you're a star.
You define your life by the beast that you project.
Oh, what a facade. No shame! No respect!
You're on the stage, you play out your part.
You're life's a party, but you've got no heart.
Every time I scream, every word I say, it's all a piece of me that I leave up, that I leave up on the stage.
This is just to let you know from those of us you thought you'd fooled,
every emotion that you fake is just another lie that I see through.
you'd have them worship you.
Who do you think you are?
You came in to suck the life from this room.
Those easily swayed were the first to go.
Made sure that all eyes were on you.
You're not happy till you steal the show.
Every time I scream, every word I say, it's all a piece of me that I leave up, that I leave up on the stage.
This is just to let you know from those of us you thought you'd fooled,
every emotion that you fake is just another lie that I see through.
I'm no angel. We all have horns.
I'll never stand on high. I wear no crown of thorns.
I'll drink my whiskey, and burn a cigarette, but I refuse to define myself by the nights that I forget.
You won't take me.
I see through your hollow words.
You are a fake.
