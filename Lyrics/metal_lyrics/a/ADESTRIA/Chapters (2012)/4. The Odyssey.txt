These shadows will lead us back. Their silhouettes point to the west.
I will not be kept from the life that I was meant to lead.
It's hard to trust an aching body sealed with rust,
but we've come too far to fall today. The end will be delayed!
We'll make it home if we have to crawl on our hands and knees.
Our minds may grow tired, but these feet know the way.
We've wandered for too long.
We've seen the gates of hell.
There are those that would see us fail,
place us in our coffins, strike the final nail,
but who's to say we wouldn't do the same?
We can't be stopped.
You'll fall apart. We'll just move on.
It's hard to trust an aching body sealed with rust,
but we've come too far to fall today. The end will be delayed!
We'll make it home if we have to crawl on our hands and knees.
Our minds may grow tired but these feet know the way.
You speak with silver, but you leave an ugly stain
on all you touch, on everything you say.
We will be legend!
