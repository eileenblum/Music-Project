Denial surrounds a naive boy, as he plays in the field.
Precious time escapes him, ignorant to what is real.
There's a thief in the shadows waiting to breed.
To take away what is his, to take from him what he needs.
"Now my son, be strong (along the path of life)." In his flesh these words have carried on.
She worries for him, to keep him calm. Her love runs through forever on, forever true.
He fights the truth he has within.
Refuses to let the sea of reason in.
A father grows numb, his weakness he dare not show.
A child robbed of love, too young to know.
The chasm grows too wide as they struggle to save a precious life for another day.
She sat through nights, and held him tight, thankful for the years.
Knowing the end was in sight accepting what she'd feared.
"Now my son, be strong (along the path of life)." In his flesh these words have carried on.
She worries for him, to keep him calm. Her love runs through forever on, forever true.
As time runs out, everything he never said, every chance he never took, plays over in his head.
And he screamed at the sky!
The body of a woman that he still loves, lays lifeless before his eyes.
A hollow vessel at rest, opens up to the skies.
Does death give way to peace, or just oblivion?
Another life cut short. Another victim of the villain.
My heart has struggled to comprehend how I'll stick through 'til the end,
but even the deepest sorrow will lose it's scalpel edge.
