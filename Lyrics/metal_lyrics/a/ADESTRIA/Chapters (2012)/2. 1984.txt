These man made morals, like perfectly paved sidewalks,
force direction and safety, as they watch us like hawks.
They teach us to walk with blinders,
like the horses they wish we were,
to carry their causes on our backs
without questioning what they're for.
We simply nod and agree, we are bred to be lazy.
They set the world on fire, and we are the gasoline.
We're told to accept these give proofs.
We're fed a diet of lies and unproven truths.
I know that we've been herded together.
To be different leaves us alone.
They've put our minds to sleep, our dreams are not our own.
Like a thief, they came in the night,
to remove our will to fight.
We simply nod and agree, we are bred to be lazy.
They set the world on fire and we are the gasoline.
We're told to accept these given proofs.
We're fed a diet of lies and unproven truths.
They sit above, cast judgement down.
Offer no help to those that will surely drown.
They cast me out because I don't feel the same.
I'm not content seeing the world aflame.
And if to stand for something that's not a trend leads me to my end,
then I'll smile as I leave, because I fought for something that I believe.
