You've burnt this bridge
Fallen from grace
Just like the ties
That you severed to this place
Our bonds (our bonds), were written in blood (written in blood)
But your veins grew pale
But your veins grew pale the day you lost my trust

I hope you're happy with the choices you've made
Because after what you've done
You're not worth being saved
Not worth being saved

Enjoy the burden you've strapped to your back
I hope it weights you down (weights you down)
To a point where you realize what you lack
I hope you burn in your crown (burn in your crown)

You've let him take your tongue
So you can't speak of what your life's become
You've let him take your spine
As you sit next to the king you're forced to worship his shrine

You turned your back on the only way out
Turned on those you used to care about
You took his name, you took his side
You left the rest of us in doubt
I said that I'm done, I said it's enough
I said I won't be there when the going gets ROUGH

Your demise isn't something that I want to see
Cut you out of my life
THE DAY YOU LIED TO ME

Enjoy the burden
You've strapped to your back
I hope it weights you down (weights you down)
To a point where you realize what you lack
I hope you burn in your crown (burn in your crown)

You've let him take your tongue
So you can't speak of what your life's become
you've let him take your spine
As you sit next to the king you're forced to worship his shrine

Hey little hole in my heart
You've grown so cold
You've run out of soul
So pump to my veins
So you might as well turn to stone

You've shown me
How wrong I was to put my trust
In someone that I loved
Now I know to leave the past alone
