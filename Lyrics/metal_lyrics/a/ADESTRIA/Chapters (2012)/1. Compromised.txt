You've lost the light, that I thought I had found.
Given up on the flight and settled to remain here on the ground.
Force comfort and rest. Adjust to unpleasantness.
You gave up on what you had.
You know that your greatest compromise weighs heavy in your eyes.
I can see that it's something you cannot hide.
You fenced yourself in with these white posts,
given up on what you needed the most.
He clipped your wings, you no longer sing. You allowed the worm to make you it's host.
A cage is a cage even when their are no bars, and if you keep your head down then there's no way you'll see the stars.
You've let him become the weights that keep you tethered to the floor.

A cage is a cage even when their are no bars, and if you keep your head down then there's no way you'll see the stars.
A house can't make you whole, and the bottle won't return what he stole.
Sleeves to cover wrists, bruised from heavy fists.
You can't say you're complete when what you're missing still exists.
There's hardly a shadow of who you once were.
What have you become?
Lost and alone!
But you live for the crash. You ache for the flames, the pity it brings.
What have you become?
