For the day will come...upon emblazoned red seas
For the day will come...bearing plague and disease
For the day will come...when nature reclaims
For the day will come...enwreathed in flames

For the day will come...with suffering replete
For the day will come...with the cycle complete
For the day will come...for all to lie in their graves
For the day will come...mankind is erased

For the day will come...with horizons afire
For the day will come...no more

A world forsaken long forgotten...not even a memory
