Providence, rejoice in the kingdom of lies
Ordinance borne of deceit
Credulous minions to serve the betrayer
As oblivion seals their fate

Veneration of a concept malign
Pragmatism carved in sin
Black is thy flame at the heart of the Abyss
A guide for the misanthrope

Truth is devoid of all hope

So harvest this dead and dying race
Sickly is the earthen child
Prevarication anoints the redeemer
My axiom cast in exile

[Psalm 69:1:2:3]

"Save me, O god, for the waters have reached my neck.
I have sunk into the mire of the deep, where there is no foothold.
I have gone down to the watery depths, the flood overwhelms me.
I am weary with crying out, my throat is parched.
My eyes have failed searching for my god."

With forked acidic tongues you spit forth your lies
A paradox vocation belies...the divine.
Thy infernal scythe...cleanse us of this plague

Deus Mortuus

Remnants of the Holy
Beg for redemption
'Neath the bones of salvation

AMEN
