Crowned in lies and scarred in deceit
Their god and his glories
Burn the veil and scour beneath
Deception...their journey

Vessels of skin
Foundations in flesh

Crowned in lies and scarred in deceit
Their god and his glories
Burn the veil and scour beneath
Revelation...your journey

Vessels of skin
Foundations in flesh

Confinement of skin
Our foundations in flesh

Slaves unto faith, Pious subjugates

A hollow decree thus betrothed
Forsaken...thy kingdom of man
Glorified illusions for spiritual lepers

To cure this disease
One must erase impure flesh

The final catholicon

I long to see through the eyes of God
(A vision omnipotent)
In the absence of mortal form 
We return to the Abyss adorned

To hearken the call primordial
