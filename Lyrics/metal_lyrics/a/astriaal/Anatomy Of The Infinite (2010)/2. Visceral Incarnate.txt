Anatomical lust
Encryption made flesh
Reflections of foreboding divination

Like sinews from the past
Enriving ether
Imbuing colossal formations

The human equation, The cosmic plague
A sentient creation, A mind deranged

Resplendence illdefined
The liege continuum
Crowned in astral exaltation

Licentious in design
Genesis primordium
Enduring anatomic constellations

The human equation, The cosmic plague
A sentient creation, A mind deranged

From the pathogenic birth of man
To the paradigm birth of stars
Trans-integration dominus

Man must awaken
Prostrate and proclaimed
In Abyssal theology

Exsanguination
The Cimmerian age
Of human anatomy

Embellished in surreption
Clandestine involution
Dominion borne of darkness and of light
And thus the great creator shall rise the grand destroyer
The cerement swathe...extinguishing life

Eminent cold volition lustrates the ancient flames
Enlightened in labyrinthian ways
Terminal transmissions expelled from aeons past
Remnants of the void exuberant

Eternal doth writhe the bane of man...obsequious

For the stars decayed
Silence remained
All life erased
To rise in flame

The resolute death of man lies mirrored in the stars
In transempirical seas presides thy seething heart
As the darkest void unleashed this paragon formed syntax
The sequential reign of God haemorrhaging in black
