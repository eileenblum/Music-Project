From an ocean so vast, to an ocean so deep
A union of chaos, a union of order complete
Behold its beauty, behold its majesty
To avow its power, to avow its mystery

A transient journey, the spectral inception begins
So cold and reverent
Creation as virtue, destruction the end of all
Maleficent
To question the question, perceptions beyond belief
Consecution
Celestial relics shrouding the architect...unseen

The enthrallment of pelagic acquiescence

Disavowing the Ovinus horde
Expelled from the womb divine
Adherents of liege and lord
Betraying the grand design

FORLORN

Unrivalled in nature, Unrivalled in sovereignty
Defining creation, Defining our destiny

Revenant forces extolling the primal seed
Consecration
Surrogate doctrines erased from cerebrum vaults
Vanquished

"An entity bound; thus not of itself but that of comprehension"

Beholdeth - Exalted - Opulence
Manifest - Supernal - Oblivion

Enlightened...I bear the scars of aberration

Ominous - Inherent - Dominion
Ontology - Proclaiming - Adoration

The internal is external...thus eternal
