Within shadows forsaken, the dying flame
Mortal expiration, sovereignty over flesh
For I am the reaper's blade, bearer of carrion winds
The puritan formation of anti-absolution
I wield extinction, for I am the fate of all
Ageless, faceless... a seer of death!
The final call

Benighted thus dwell the fallen in life
Return to the womb of the Earth
The final atonement of will and demise
A journey towards death and beyond

The purulent race of Man, incarnate of the weak
An ephemeral child decaying
Gasping for life at its dying mother's teat...
...Already dead are we!
