Engaged beyond celestial essence
To draw upon the spirit of the night
A sovereign moon ancient... arises!
A scarlet flare devours the landscape

Aeon's reflection scars my eyes

Veins flow with the strength of hate...
...For the end of All is at hand

A season turning... a cleansing in blood!
Extinguish the flame, Rape the light
Prayers for the dead
Escape... for none!

For the blood I yearn
A sign of lunar enslavement

A burning storm
Thy bleeding night
Prophetic immersion in time
The cosmic urge... desire!
Extinction divine

For the blood I yearn
A sign of lunar enslaved worlds

When the blood flows and devours the Earth
All shall fall before the reign of death
...Of death!

Allure, The blood of night
Redemption denied
Crimson streams of light
Lay waste to this world

Immortal souls embracing the night...
...I behold an eclipse in blood!
