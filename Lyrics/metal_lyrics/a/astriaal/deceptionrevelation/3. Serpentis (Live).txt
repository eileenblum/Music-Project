Talons unfurl... dragon magic rise
Spectral shadows, cast beyond all light
Interstellar caverns, dwells a beast devine
It dreams creation
Oh... to stare through eyes so old!
Into vast kingdoms ablaze
Sovereign empire, void of light
Serpent spread thy wings... ARISE!

A palace where the souls of dead dream
Ancient, of thy darkness within
Writhing essence bleeds
From thy depths, thy beast is unleashed

Serpentine... summon thee!

To soar as a raven, through endless spheres of light
Leviathan dimensions, eclipse the realms of ice
Transcend these cosmic ruins, for eternity I roam
Of ancient gates before me, immortal I enter... alone!

Writhing essence bleeds
From thy depths, thy beast is unleashed

...Serpentis
