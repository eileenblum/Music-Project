[originally by Burzum]My eyes are shut I cannot see
though clear is thy despair
I drift away - far away
from places of which you seek

Though I seek thy hell
yuo close the gate before me
Your life is right, and I'm to
follow to your paradise

I cannot fall in love
love is for them
Lusting for the sky -
Heaven

Why did I come to this world
of sorrow why is this true
Where is my dagger of sacrifice

I will open the gates to Hell one
day...
