Mortal seeping of wounds
Conjuring seasonal decline
Ominous reflections
Chapters written in blood
Of the earth, Condemnation in flesh
The ancient soil reveals so many tales

An artifice... divine!

Dying spectral emissions reside
Colossal apparitions

Primal convergence of time
It writhes, contorts, decays
Invariant transmissions
Into thy subconscious descends
A vision... the beginning... the end!
The eye... the coming... the iconoclast!

What have we learned from life?
...A life forlorn!
The essence remains asunder
Enigma divine... the key lies beyond!

Desire... the source of dreams
Corroding the balance of time
Astral revelation... the deception tide
Eternal... dying within
