Nazarene!
The holy disease... a plague upon mankind!
Christendom!
Salvation to some, Christ... worthless to me!

Prophetic incarnate
Sworn martyr to the weak
The cunting children [of light]
Empty vessels chained to deceit
A deity to the fallen
Visions for the blind
Condemned to suffer
Mass deception divine

Perish... the throne!

Vanquish iconic persecution
Hate scars the saviour idolised
Betrayed by thy Father in heaven...
...Betrayed by Christ!

Jesus, I eat of your flesh
Jesus, I drink of your blood

Remnants of faith deceased
The thousand year reign vanquished
Judgement delivered
For I bow before... none!

Inoculated souls for the burning
Vestal convocation in flesh
Reinvent your saviour
God's millennial son
Christ... a figure forlorn!
Withered, Nailed to the cross
I bear the mark of purity
Reviled... I bear the scars of sin!

For your priests will die
Your Christ has died
And your God must die

Subservants of faith... abandon all hope!
There is no salvation... only lies!

AMEN
