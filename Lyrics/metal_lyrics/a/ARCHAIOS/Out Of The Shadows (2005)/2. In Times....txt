From all these years behind
We ash ourselves for reason
Searching for the cure
Without having a vision.

We dwell in lucid minds
But live our own asleep
Demanding our demise
For secrets that we need.
Enthroned in darkness sight
We call out our desire
Of spirits left behind
And our fallen empire.

And one more time once
We drink the holy fire
Rejoicing in the could
As we feel madness rise.

The power in their words
Their smile pictured inside
Of ages we encore
We gather and revive

And all the years to come they vanish in a blink
And wisdom though our eyes is nothing but a dream

Soon we'll leave behind all that's ashes and dust
And many years from now we'll still wander in the Cold.
