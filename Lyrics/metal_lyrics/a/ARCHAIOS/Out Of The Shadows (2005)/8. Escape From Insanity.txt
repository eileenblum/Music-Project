Lost inside a mystic world
No idea of where I've gone
It's a matter of life and death
After all it's just in my head

Dandified, in death I lie,
With no hope of salvation,
I keep fear within the fields of my soul
And rejoice my inventions.

Locked away,
Thrilled by impure beliefs
Descending state,
At least I've found a way to be free

[Chorus 1]
Moving on, here inside
There's a feeling in my mind,
A heathen one, sacrifice,
All my thoughts to heal my nights,
Empty looks in my face,
I've seen it all turn red,
To overcome this pain I feel...

In my turret of madness,
Through my window the moonlight
Reflects from the sea,
Influencing my Dearing
I surrender to the call of the deep.

Scratching my way out,
I take a leap from the peach
Insanity's left behind
"Mare Mortis" my dying release.

[Chorus 2]
Moving on, here inside
There's a feeling in my mind,
A heathen one, sacrifice,
All my thoughts to heal my nights,
Empty looks in my face,
I've seen it all turn red,
To overcome this pain I feel...
