In the times of the past
When my life was nothing
[I] could restrain my mind
From the truth in my eyes

A blissful sight
Trapped of my ignorance
Suddenly changes took
A different turn in this path

The vision of fate
I had built in my head
Was no longer conceived
As a human thought

And the ashes of eons
The remains from the dark
Came to haunt me
In my deepest, longest, wildest night

[Chorus 1]
In an aura of light I am drowned
All alone in these night
Entities of the fallen
Had come to show me "The Land"
Cannot tell from the truth
And what my eyes behold
Could it be what I see
The true shape and form of my...

Amazed at my descending guests
Questions are Doan in an unusual way
And fear of the end I had not
As it was so precious the time we talked

But the darkness went through
And so they left
And of his resurrection
None I'll say
Like the spirit of madness
Was carved though time
The torment of demons
Haunt me all my nights

[Chorus 2]
In an aura of light I am drowned
All alone in these night
Entities of the fallen
Had come to show me "The Land"
Cannot tell from the truth
And what my eyes behold
Could it be what I see
The true shape and form of my... GOD!
