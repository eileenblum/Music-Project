The servants of the dammed
The demons of the mind
The Styx is drawing nearer
Does hope fade in this hour?

The moon is shattered, dyed in red
In presence of the end
The river of light in flames ignites
Since the beginning of wisdom times.

Ideas cannot have perfection
All horror calls you name
And you do not seem to dear it

Death comes crawling for your soul
The eternal bleeding begins,
Heavens crying in your name
The holocaust is at your feet.
