Don't you see I'm crying
Can't you see I'm dying
My eyes, they stare,
As you turn your back on me

It's my mourning hour
I know time will pass
You'll forget 'bout my name soon, but...
I'll be waiting in my side

Your time will come
The depths of hell shall be your fate
For years to come
You will live, standing in the night shade

For years to come,
For broken dreams
For hearts undone
You will live, standing in the night shade

Alive inside, all minds behind
I'll remain forever as a memory in time
Meant to dwell beyond, as a part of one
It's time to start my journey to become
And live 'mongst the celestial kind.
