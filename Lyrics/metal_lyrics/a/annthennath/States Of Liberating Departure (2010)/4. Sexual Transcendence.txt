To evolve in tribes,
Social affrontment.

Introduction to transgression.
Pleasure of the flesh and soul.

Establish customs,
Moral and immortal,
A mind free of illegalities,
Everything under will.

Broken vows from the past,
Constituting everlasting ethics.

Discovering an unknown radiance,
Through recurrent ecstasies
Orgasms without restriction,
To break habitual boundaries.

Primitive but enriching mating,
Love only exists through sex,
Consciousness now making,
Disintegration of guilt.

Culture must be transmitted
Across the streams of aeons,
reproduction is unnecessary,
No shame to drown in sin.

No trust in others,
The sign of maturity.

Objectivity so pure,
A control on destiny,
Realizing into quietness,
That divinities are falsehood.

The rules are concentric then,
Embodied in sexual transcendence.
