Back to the world in three dimensions,
Made of animal reactions,
Constructing the wealth of the mind,
troubled by mankind.

Learning from reality,
To achieve derterity,
Rejecting clumsiness,
And other forms of blindness.

Controled predictions,
Generating inventions,
Out of the environment,,
Setting aside all torments.

A conception of the universe,
Above mediocrity,
Against inferiority.

Attaining knowledge,
Helped by hallucinations,
Increased perceptions.

Concentration...
Comprehension...
Aim of the soul...
Structured beliefs...
Imaginary myths...
Real or unreal...
Nothing holy....
Self-devotion...
Beyond the body...
Close to wisdom...
Differentiate from lies...

Conceiving time,
Surrounding logic,
Artifacts and systems,
Symbolic awareness.
