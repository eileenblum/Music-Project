Deities and demons...
Infernal and fighting.
Rationalization...
Of all the visions..

Protected from the chaos,
anxiety has disappeared,
Master of serenity,
Correct selections done,
Unshackled trip,
Capable of carrying on.

Partly unexplored,
Towards elevation,
And self illumination.

Delivered from dread,
Into the emotional balance.
