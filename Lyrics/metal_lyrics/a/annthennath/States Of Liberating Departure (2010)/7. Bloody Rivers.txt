Out of the body,
Close to the white light,
The cycle continues,
An impression of immortality.

Repercussions...
Without importance.
In harmony...
Guided by hatred.

Facing the nightmares,
In a virtual Hell.

Genetic memory under way,
Past lives surfacing,
Allegories of wisdom,
Magic created by the soul, 
Understanding that after all,
This is fully illusory.

Against the collective unconscious,
The spirit is raised above all.

Evolution depends on this, 
Not on the randomness.

A universe so blind and impersonal,
Below an individual enlightenment.

Sanity is abstract,
No other judge than the mind.

Whatever happens,
Uncertainly vanishing,
Pain is meaningless,
The mastery is unbounded.

The ways to superiority,
Trailed as if they were,
Bloody rivers.
