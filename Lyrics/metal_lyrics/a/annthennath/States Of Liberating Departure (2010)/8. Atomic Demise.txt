Free from dogmas and theories,
To attain the supreme liberation,
The intellect rose and fell
After a life deprived of contrition.

The clear light must be extinguished,
To eliminate reality and dreams,
Intentional rejection of reincarnation,
To break the wheel rebirth.

To be psychic is not supernatural,
With practice and experiment.

The highest scepticism,
To gain the greatest purity,
An intergalactic consciousness,
Before the definitive departure.

Abortion of the astral projection,
To end the sojourn with alien entities.

I am my own god and overlord,
Enlightened by darkness and death.

Quantum acquaintance,
Let each atom return to nothingness.

Chaos theory,
Destroy a world constantly in flux.

When everything has been done,
When hope is forever gone,
Its time to get to the black hole,
To dissolve my life as a whole.

Do not underestimate,
The power of the spirit,
But do remember
That each particle is mortal.

And the last state leads me
To my atomic demise.
