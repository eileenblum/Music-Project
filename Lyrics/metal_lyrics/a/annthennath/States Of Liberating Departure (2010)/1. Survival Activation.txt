In the early stages,
Choices must be made.

Trust or suspicion?
Constant doubts
To build thoughts.
Harmful or safe?
Empiricism
To build existence.

Determine what is spiritually  possible
For all forthcoming experiences.

Feel the passion and desire flowing a river.
Pride as basic pathway.

Light...

Light will disappear in the end.
High pressure augmenting.
Coldness and heat.
Elementary sensations.
A journey so long yet short.
Beginning of the tunnel

Liberate the ego,
Dawn of energy, 
Survival activation.
