Reprogram the mind,
To know it perfectly, 
Encompassing all cells.

Excited nervous system,
Happiness and sadness are merged
In a voluntary contraction.

Dominate the emotions,
In sensory rapture, 
Humble and high.

Liberty is near,
Satisfaction is never total, 
But bring to superior levers.

In a decadent free fall,
Chemical delight,
Taste strong desires,
Outburst of senses,
Erotic whirl,
lust glorified.

Multidimensional glee,
Overlooking the spacetime continuum.

Spiritual possessiveness,
Hungry and thirty for the void.

Detached from the world so dull,
To live in somatic hedonism...

Somatic hedonism....
