Full of contempt.
What is needless must be ignored.

Murder is natural component of terrestrial life,
No grief to kill any kind of living creatures,
Even family and other human circles.

Death and famine are a motivation,
Intoxicating any form of vitality,
A mediation so futile,
A nonexistent exit.

Independent from other patterns,
On top of the previous adjustments,
Decisions are made instinctively,
Standard doctrines put appart.
Relationships
Like telepathy
An own fate,
To foresee.

To decide coincidences
No luck or misfortune.

Instead of complaining,
Power and creativity.

A pictorious mental battle,
Immunity to normality.

Now eyes can see
An electric destiny.
