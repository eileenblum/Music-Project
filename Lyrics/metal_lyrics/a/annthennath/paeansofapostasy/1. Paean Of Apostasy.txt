Retreated into obscurantism,
Followers blinded by the Creed.

Heterodoxy...
Heresy...
Profanity...
Glory.

Few are the dissidents,
Desecration shall be the way.

Heterodoxy...
Heresy...
Profanity...

Salvation comes from the excrements of their mind,
False hopes to forget the fears.
Blasphemy as a reaction against mediocrity,
An oath to curse them all.

Satan is the hegemonic tool and weapon.

Addicted to icons created by man,
Disciples of immature beliefs.
Intolerance against weak human creations,
Sacrilege is the key.

I am the Abomination,
The anathema of all religions.

Chant the Paean of Apostasy...
