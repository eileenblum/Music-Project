A constant decline of humanity,
Yet a growing number of parasites.
The epidemic of life never ceases,
And let the vermin proliferates.

An inferior race
So arrogant.
A total flaw
In the evolution.

Anti-human terror...
Let the world perish.

Repugnant procreation of abject beings,
Vomit on those thoughtless natural instincts.

Anti-human terror...
Let the world perish.

Annihilation of all future generations,
No exception for this mad expansion.

Anti-human terror...
Let the world perish.

No remorse for a global infanticide,
To exalt the genocide of mankind.
Hate against philanthropy,
The pestilent mass eradicated.

Anti-human terror...
Let the world perish.

The climax to see people die in torment,
The almighty doom as a triumphant ending.
