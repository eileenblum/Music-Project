Moaning, gasping and screaming, suddenly waking up in a harsh way.
Impossible to realize what is this glacial and dark place deprived of light.
Only a repulsive stench and this penetrating noise that never seems to stop.
The impression of having been tortured and left naked on the floor.

The moment to move and search for a way out.
Alone and crawling through this labyrinth.
Still no sign of light, hallucinations start.
All senses confused, as an overwhelming horror.
Paroxysm of pain, drowning into the unknown.

Trapped without any concrete explanation, no answer.
Scratched hands on endless walls without door, a frantic search.
Making the choice of eating dejections as a survival instinct.
No memories, the past has been erased, the material world vanished.

Patience is lost in a flood of anger.
Heart beats tearing the harrowing silence.
The concept of time does not exist anymore.

Slow suffocation, devoured from the inside.
A pathetic quest leading to nowhere but insanity.

Finally doubts disappear,
No nightmare here but life itself.
A soul imprisoned in a body,
With death as the only escape.
