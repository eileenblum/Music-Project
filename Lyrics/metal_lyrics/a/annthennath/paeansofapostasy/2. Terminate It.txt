No meaning to life, death is almighty and rules the macrocosm.
Human myths made as a denial of the simple truth.

A dust among dusts, man is unaware of his true condition.
The joy of breathing so futile and pretentious.

Waste of flesh...
Worthless creatures...
Aversion for existence...
Consumed by an utter hatred.

A moment will come, with no turning back,
Preceded by a feeling of relief.

My soul is prepared to join the nothingness.
Immortality is a lie, nothing before, nothing after.

No possibility to hear the cries of the remaining ones.
The final end to the suffering and illness that is life.

Tired of waiting...
Permanent nausea...
Unbearable agony...
Everything is so useless.

Waste of flesh...
Worthless creatures...
Aversion for existence...
Consumed by an utter hatred.

Useless world ...
Useless life...
Terminate it.
