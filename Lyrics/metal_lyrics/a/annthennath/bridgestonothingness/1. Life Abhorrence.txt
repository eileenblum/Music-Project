Close your eyes and imagine the world in which you live in
Open your eyes and admit to believe in hope is vain

Truth has been corrupted by time, the future is of no importance now
Only earthly pleasures are left, optimism disappeared forever
No reason to keep on fighting, no more, no less than a daily disgust

Dissapointed, immense anger, poisoned mind, lost expectations

Life abhorrence

Only negative thoughts remain, alone yet surrounded by crowds
I face the reality with repulsion, disturbed by human futility
Wishing the devil would exist to create a new concept of life

Sorrow turned to hate, innocence gone, twisted desires, supreme rebellion

Fading appearance, life abhorrence

Emotions are a part of the blind ones, naive fancies such as love and happiness
A lifetime is a detestable illusion, it only leads to nothingness
