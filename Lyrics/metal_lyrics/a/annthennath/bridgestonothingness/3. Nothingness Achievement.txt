Finally it replaced life, even death is no more
Why did it take so much time?
Answers are pointless, words are not enough
Why don't you come with me?

Nobody came back from this mysterious void
Abstact concept, but deep and absolute
An invisible violence and a destiny so certain
Human vanity is crushed eternally

Eyes can see what once was palbable, uselessness is before you
Flesh and bones rot and turn to dust, time will take everything away

You can't understand, you can't realize
Don't even think, don't even try

A fear of death so dim but there is only one way
To be saved fatefully, cross the bridge right away

One solution to erase humanity and all the rest towards emptiness

What is next has no relevance, no escape from the nothingness achivement

Nothing dreadful will happen now, mortality is a satanic intent

By my own hands or not, I will rich oblivion soon
