Glorification of death

The beginning of a life, a kind of extended funeral
Relieved by the sovereign of all, yet so concrete and obscure
On the last step as a pedestal, the monarch can be met only once
Time to abandon everything forever and leave this shell without regret

I could kneel down in front of you, but I'll join your arms with my head high

A presistent grief is over, then the path to nothingness

Any torture will be pleasant because this is the end at last

Exaltation of all senses, a final orgasm, the ultimate ecstasy

Like a real bliss, intense and blind, ejaculation of the soul and no cosequences
Nothing has a meaning when confronted to death

Glorification of death
