She brandished the knife above them,
And stuck it in the screaming pieces of flesh.
Soon silence could be heard again,
A necessary act has ended.

Praise mass abortion,
And slaughter of newborns.
Time to revive the tradition,
Their fate must be sealed.

Pour the blood of the offspring,
Each new birth is a shame.
Decimate the foetus out of the womb,
And any living human larvas.

Massacre of fellow men is instinctive,
The natural selection shall begin again.

For a voluntary extinction of our species,
To generalise children sacrifices.

Condemned by all religions
For unjustified reasons,
A practice among animals
That should be common for all.

Male or female...
Healthy or disabled...
Buried alive or suffocated...
Drowned or thrown to dogs...
Stop the process of evolution.

Abandon the influences of creationism,
Let your own Satan guide your hand.
Glorify the infanticide,
Death to useless beings.

The race is destined to die,
So cease to breed now,
Or kill with vehemence.
