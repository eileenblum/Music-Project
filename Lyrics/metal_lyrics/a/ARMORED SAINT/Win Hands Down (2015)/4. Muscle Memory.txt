I read the news every day or I try
Switch back and forth between
A scowl and a smile
People lift me up or drop me
Flat like a stone
But still I want to believe in them
My clan comes number one in the fight
We brought souls in this world
And we'll do it right
Though my moods they swing like a pendulum
They know where my heart comes from
Like our dear departed friend Andy told me
It's only water off a ducks
Back in the stream
Face it like a man face it like a wimp
But either way you're facing it

Burying your hero underneath
Your feathers
Signals a swan song
Yes the ride is short but your
Heretage is long

Muscle memory
Is what I use to carry me
Muscle memory
Ain't no way I worry 'bout a thing
Muscle memory
I reference stuff I know
Muscle memory
Then put my feet down and go

I want music to bring me down to my knees
Make me sob like an infant make me angry
Rip me to shreds clue me back up
Make my mind explode
Things that matter I can afford
Get my shit together and get onboard
Shed every pound, melt it away
Rid that overweight load

Burying your head underneath the sand
Is succumbing to the words I can't
Ok the ride may stall but your legacy
Stands tall

Muscle memory
Is what I use to carry me
Muscle memory
Ain't no way I worry 'bout anything
Muscle memory
I reference stuff I learn
Muscle memory
Disfigurement I've earned

And I wear it like a badge of honor
No stone unturned
Yeah it's the bane of my existence
To pass the torch in a world of nonsense

Shot a miss
So many nights I've toiled over this
Once around
Crotchety young man make it count

I make my own news out on the fly
Do much more than I need to get by
People lift me up
Don't let me drop
Or at least have a net there

Burying your hero in your hands
Looks like a deserted plan
Yes the ride is short
With temptations to abort
ok the ride may stall
You still sound off the bugle call

Muscle memory
Is what I use to carry me
Muscle memory
Ain't no way I worry 'bout anything
Muscle memory
I reference stuff I know
Muscle memory
Then put me feet down and go

And I go, yeah
There I go
