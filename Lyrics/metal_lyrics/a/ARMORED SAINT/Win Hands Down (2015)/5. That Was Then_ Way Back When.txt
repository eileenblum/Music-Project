I'm taking a walk to the neighborhood psychic
Want to find out what's in store for the day
Got all my pictures strewn across facebook
Want to be liked in a desperate way
I market myself it's a foregone conclusion
I dish out winks in this busy foray

Living vicariously, living vicariously
I live through every single
Stranger that I meet

Somebody knows me
Guess again
Someone likes me
Guess again
Love being famous
Guess again
My fifteen minutes it came and it went

That was then
I got lost on purpose so I could be found
Way back when
I got lost on purpose so I could be found

I drift on back a couple of decades
And regress to a time I was king
The future seems so uncertain
But the past is a place I could do anything
Give me a phone call send me a text
I even gave you, your own unique ring

Living harmoniously, living harmoniously
We live through every crappy
Song that we sing

That was then
I got lost on purpose so I could be found
Way back when
I got lost on purpose so I could be found

So I'll buy a round
Drown
Se we can drown, all our sorrows
Mosey up chumps let's all hit the bar
I'll tell old war stories when I use to be a star
You remember then
Don't you remember then?

Someone knows me
Guess again
Someone loves me
Guess again
These are my friends
I can't accept that I'm a has been

That was then
I got lost on purpose so I could be found
Way back when
I got lost on purpose so I could be found

Man I was lost
Damn I was found
Suffer the cost
So I could be found
