Carpe diem seize the moment
Era fleeting keep on breathing

The fragility of life
Curve balls fall from out of the sky
And as you stare and ponder why
It accelerates then passes you by

If in an instant it turns south
Can't retract what flew out of your mouth

Do you give all
Grab life by the balls
Or bathe in fear
Voices you can't really hear
It comes testing of your will
Is your spirit made of steel

The fragility of time
There's no clear reason no sure rhyme
Although everything appears fine
It can drive the strongest
Out of their minds

And in an instant it turns south
Pinned to the mat and now you're out

Missed the boat with the red flag waving
Rhetoric seeped in and scathing
Sorry for always saying sorry
Way too much or never enough

Fist to the jaw and your knocked out
Although you're down, got to reborn

Do you give all
Grab life by the balls
Or drown in fear
Voices you can't really hear
It comes testing or your will
Is your spirit strong as steel

The fragility of life
It can change with the blink of an eye
And as you gaze and wounder why
It accelerates then passes you by
Don't let it pass you by

When in an instant it turns south
True to yourself you can't
Ever doubt yeah

Even if your head is spinning
Even if your head is reeling
