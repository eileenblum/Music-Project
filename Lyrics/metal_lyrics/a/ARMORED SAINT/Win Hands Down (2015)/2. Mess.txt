Paralyzing chains of tradition
Let the decadence marinate
Farmers with a dire prediction
Who planted massive seeds we ate
Flower, grower, cultivating seeds we ate
Pilfer, slower, inching closer to checkmate

There's many been bought before, lots before
And this ain't no different
There's many who've fought before, and lost before
And this ain't no different
The price of an all you can eat buffet
Will put you away
You ain't no different, I ain't no different
There ain't no difference
Between the likes of us
Except were all gonna bust

The mess, the mess that we continue to make
Living in our culture of waste
The mess that we all make will
Annihilate
The mess, the mess that we continue to make
Mom said better clean your plate
The mess that we all make will
Annihilate

Waste

Fat the hero modus operandi
Gluttons eat all in their path
Sell the public items they must buy
Use 'em once then they get the shaft

There's many been bought before, lots before
And this ain't no different
There's many who've fought before, and lost before
And this ain't no different
The line at the all you can eat buffet
It blows me away
You ain't no different, I ain't no different
There ain't no difference
Between the likes of us
Except we're all gonna bust
