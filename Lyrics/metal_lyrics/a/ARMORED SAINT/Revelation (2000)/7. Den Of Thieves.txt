These living quarters are off limits to you
These guarded borders are all subject to choose
Passive not my tone of voice no way
Not my choice, here to make a point

Inside - you will find all that you need
In the den of thieves
Inside - you'll always find ecstasy
In the den of thieves

This propaganda can be hell against you
This four leaf clover can be lucky for you
Freedom and fortune waits for all time to
Climb the wall and watch the old ways fall

Inside - sleep always comes easily

Radical changes are there pushing you through
Severing ties a big decision for you
What will you do

Power, by rank and file, you must learn to smile
Lonely in the wind

Inside - things aren't always what they seem
