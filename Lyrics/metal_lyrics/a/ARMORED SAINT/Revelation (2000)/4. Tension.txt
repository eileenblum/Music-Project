Brass hat, CEO
Only appears for a cameo
The camp is so clean
And it keeps raining green
The scent is strong
But yet something's wrong
Everything is too much right

Tension, need tension
God forsaken
Godawful place
The falling house of cards
That I love to embrace
I'm saving face

Four star everything's comped
We steer the peddlers clear
Lessons in decorum given out
First class, top notch, no fear
Announcing every heroic feat
Large praise and make it quick
Good as it is it's never great
This health is making me sick

Wrapped up the report is done
The addle brained just can't get enough
The scent is strong but yet something is wrong
Everything just ain't right
This house of cards is erasing my face
