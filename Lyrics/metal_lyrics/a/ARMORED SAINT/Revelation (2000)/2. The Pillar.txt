Dressed in a shroud
Preparing the stand-off
A meeting of the minds must be understood
Benevolent grin couldn't be kinder
The ceremony guest is unveiling his hood

Draining power straight from the pillar
A grisly affection no one denies
The darker the room
The warmer the climate
For an unsuspected thrill homicide

Openmindedness
You're old enough - to know
Narrowmindedness
Lethargic is thought
Your brain slowly rots
Lust for the taste, no time to waste

It gives me, it gives strength
It gives strength over you (yes i do)

Waited the day
That I'd be discovered
Oblivious fools take the longest time
Endless travels
Through laws of nature
Opening boxes, oh what a find

Maximum pain with minimal pleasure
Strive for the things that you never can have
Chasing a dream that seems so appealing
Only to awaken on the wrong path

Begging to be the servants pet
Breaking free from the horde of norm
Futile transition, plenty of residue
The cheerful flesh is rolled into form
