When the final bell is rung
And the game's declared over
We speak the words goodbye
And I know it's forever

An empty pit inside my chest
Was more than a small clue
No, you'll never see me again
Something I gotta get used to

But you left much behind
Some peace and vital signs
Food for a busy mind
And souvenirs to hold tight

Just a passenger on your jetliner
Crashing to the ground
But the impact doesn't make a sound

Well, a lesson to be learned
From your departure
Funny thing but when you went away
I lost part of my cure

And now I'm searching hard
Underneath every card
Hoping with best regards
You'll bail me out of this dream state

Oh but what I feel
Unfortunately is real
Feeling the sting of pain
Not a damn thing can erase the stain

I'm leaving here
And you'll know why when I'm gone
I'm leaving here
Translate your knowledge through this song

I won't forget
Why our words were meant to mesh
Why I'm glad we shared a glass
I gave something to your soul
And you gave me more than you will ever know

Are my senses clear?
Do I feel it here?
Sometimes the past is insincere

I'm leaving here
And you'll know why when I'm gone
I'm leaving here
Translate your knowledge through this song

I won't forget
Forget why our words were meant to mesh
Why I'm glad we shared a glass
I gave something to your soul
And you gave me more than you will ever know
Than you will ever know
Than you will ever know
Than you will ever know
