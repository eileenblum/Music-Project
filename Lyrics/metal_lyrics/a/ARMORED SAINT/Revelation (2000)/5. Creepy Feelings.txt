Imagine every morbid thought
You've had throughout your life
Becoming real in the eyes
Every sucker with a weak mind
You're invited to a place
A sinister fearful haven
Where a human sacrifice
Is some stupid ass religion

What the hell is wrong with the world
Views are so distorted
No regard for human life
No law and order

Darkness - sure can be a rude awakening
No guest - has ever escaped the torturing

Creepy feelings - coming over you
Creepy feelings - lock 'em away in a room

This is all created from
Their wild imagination
The difference between truth and false
Depends on your fascination

Creepy feelings - coming over you
Protest - fools who will lead you into it
