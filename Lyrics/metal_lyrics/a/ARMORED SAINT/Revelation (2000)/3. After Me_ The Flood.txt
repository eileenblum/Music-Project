Help me write these words down
I'll write a great song to die to
Cause my days are numbered
And it's certain that I'm gonna drag you
I don't plan on going alone
I need a friend like a typhoid Mary
We'll walk with a goose step
With vigor and might that's scary

There I go (down)
And I'm lovin' it

Dig way deep in
Bid farewell to a world I can't live in
I scratched the surface
And found pride was paper thin
I tried evil
I wish it had more of and impact
Cause faith ain't helping
To rid the apes on my back

After me come the flood
