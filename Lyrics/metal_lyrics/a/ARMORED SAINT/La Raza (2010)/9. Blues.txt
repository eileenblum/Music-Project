Would you feel shallow if I cast your thoughts aside
Or pick yourself up and dust off that dirty hide
The game we play together ain't a typical run and hide
Would you mind a lot if I join you
From out of the blue I get a gushing bloody nose
The only way to clean myself is wash it with the garden hose
Each move I make will take the best curve I throw
But my friend that might still not be enough bro
Would you mind much if I join you

Yeah
Would you mind a lot if I join you

Yeah
Would you mind a lot if I join you
Is it farfetched if I join you
Is it mindless if I join you
Time to boogie California

You can try to escape but that shell you're in is still there
Now matter how far you go in your mind and your soul
You're still in there

It's useless
Futile and useless
Futile and groundless
And there ain't a damn thing left now

But never the less
Would you mind much if I join you
Would you mind much if I join you
Is it mindless if I join you
Yes it's mindless but I warned you
