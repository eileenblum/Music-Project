Get in your bubble then you travel
At lightning pace for the day
Your self importance and disregard implies
Better get out of my way
A hectic morning and awful planning
Again you're running late
So laws don't apply
And people can drive like shit you do

Regardless of all
Your lack of respect is a chain and ball
When behind the wheel
Out there dragging your loose cannon
Regardless of all
The dangers will rise and victims fall
When behind the wheel
Out there dragging your loose cannon

Yeah cause and effect
With someone self absorbed as this
Dancing from bullets yet getting away
Avoiding every single near miss
Demented odyssey
Gets a rise from everyone you meet
So rules don't apply
And you continue to drive like shit you do

A bottomless pit
Is where victims fall

Get in your bubble then you travel
At lightning pace for the day
Your self importance and disregard implies
