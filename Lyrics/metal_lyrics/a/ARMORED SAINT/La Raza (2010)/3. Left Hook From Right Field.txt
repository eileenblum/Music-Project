Looks like I'll burn at the stake and you'll float
Unless I swim across this holy moat
you say your castle's the only way
To gain access through the heavenly gates

Rabble rouser rabber rouser
Stirring up doubt wherever I turn
Pedaling fast pedaling slow
just to get away
it's a lot of energy just to not get saved

Ruined
I is a goner

Left hook from right field
Left out with no appeal
You think I'm not getting into heaven
Left hook from right field
Left to rot and no last meal
You know I'm not getting into heaven

your approach is politely rude
And such a condescending view
Other beliefs are invalid
Convert if I want to raise from the dead

You want this you need this
you want this you need this
this whole thing is making me tired again
God does this God does that
What has he done
All these preachy people make me haul ass and run

Ruined
Apparently I am a goner

Left hook from right field
Left out with no appeal
You believe I'm not getting into heaven
Left hook from right field
Left to ponder why I ain't healed
I guess I'm not getting into heaven

It's not between some so called father and I
It's not between me and some deity in the sky
Whether my heart is good
it's good
it's not between some so called father and I
it's not between me and some deity in the sky
Whether my soul is good
It's a competition with myself

Left hook from right field
they're not letting me into heaven
Left hook from right field
left out with no appeal
I'm being turned away from heaven
Left hook from right field
Left out with no appeal
You believe I'm not getting into heaven..heaven
Left hook from right field
Left to fight without a shield
I guess I'm not getting into heaven
Heaven..Heaven..Heaven
