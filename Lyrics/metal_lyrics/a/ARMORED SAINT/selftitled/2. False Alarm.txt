Look out the window, the sounds in the wind 
You hear the siren, again and again 
Screaming a whine 
Deep in your mind 
Follow the signs and you'll soar 
A piercing shrill that keeps you awake 
You're the example, he's ready to take 
Though it seems wild 
Go for the ride 
A change has been made, for you on the other side 

Another false alarm, another false alarm 
It won't do any harm, just another false alarm 

Deep in a sleep, you're awoken again 
This time departure is scheduled at ten 
Not a bad deal 
This ones for real 
I can't let it go 

A piercing shrill that keeps you awake 
Your the example he's ready to take 
Laugh when you lose 
Hung by the noose 
Anyway, the fire still burns to the core...... 

Another false alarm, another false alarm 
It won't do any harm, just another false alarm 
False alarm......Repeat till end
