Hold on to that vision 
There'll always be some friction in your life 
But you gotta keep your head high 
and beat the odds with a sigh, my friend 
Keep pushin' to the plateau 
Find gold at the end of the rainbow, begin 
Feel the sweet sensation 
Suddenly you've taken charge of your life 
No one can surpass 
Feeling good, you're on the road at last 
Yes, you're made of Armor 
And Saints will conquer 
And you ask what this thing could be 
Just jump on the road and follow me 
I knew that one day I would reach you 
And show you lives worth living for 
sometimes you'll go through hell first 
But at the end you'll be at heaven's door 
Do you realize your on the way 
To an everlasting day 
Don't turn your head on the ones who placed your crown 
or soon you'll find yourself going down!!
