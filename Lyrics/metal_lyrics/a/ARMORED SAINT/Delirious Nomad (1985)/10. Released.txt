Aren't you 
waitin' for me to take command 
Well listen 
Woman 
I would if I could make me stand 
Don't you 
Think I 
Feel so downright low 
To think I'm nude with you 
And can't even make the show 
Ooh she waits for me 
With open knees 

At last 
I find 
That I am ready to go 
Impatient 
She lies there 
With an anxious hole 
I last 
And last 
For two hours straight 
But I can't 
Seem to 
Release this tired prostate 
First it wouldn't salute 
And now it wont shoot 

Release me
