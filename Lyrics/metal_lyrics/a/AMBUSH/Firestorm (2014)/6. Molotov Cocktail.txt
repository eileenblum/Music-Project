Two decades of peace
Since we last had a go at it
I hear roars from the east
Oh yes, I've heard them before
And now you're looking for trouble
As you're marching our way to rebel
But as you cross the border
You're heading straight for Hell

'Cause a falling star is coming your way
A foreign war is here to stay

One, two, three, cocktail treat - for Molotov
Sovereignty, we fight for it - Under cover, under cover of night

Now you are running for cover
But there is nowhere to hide
Just like sheep to the slaughter
Hundred thousands have died
Fields of snow, covered in red
Meet my deep blue eyes
It doesn't matter living or dead
You've got to pay the price

'Cause a falling star is coming your way
A foreign war is here to stay

One, two, three, cocktail treat - for Molotov
Sovereignty, we fight for it - Under cover, under cover of night

One, two, three, cocktail treat - for Molotov
Sovereignty, we fight for it - Under cover, under cover of night
One, two, three, cocktail treat - for Molotov
Sovereignty, we fight for it - Under cover, under cover of, under cover of night
