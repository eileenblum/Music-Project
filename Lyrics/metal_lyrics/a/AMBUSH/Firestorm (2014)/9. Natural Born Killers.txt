Night falls, on deadly grounds they're standing
Dressed to kill, with hunger in their eyes
Strike hard, no mercy for the weakened
Feel their wrath, they leave no man alive

There's no place to hide
There's no place to go
There's no way out
When they aim for the kill

Natural born killers
Natural born killers

Oh they are the natural born - killers

Be quick or you're the next in line
Do or die, the thrill is what they need
Full speed - always on alert
Sweat for blood, they're ready to strike in the night

There's no place to hide
There's no place to go
There's no way out
When they aim for the kill

Natural born killers
Natural born killers

Natural born killers
Natural born killers
Natural born killers
Natural born
