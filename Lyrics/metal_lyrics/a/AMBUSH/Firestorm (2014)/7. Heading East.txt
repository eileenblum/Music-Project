Snowflakes are falling from wicked skies
Embracing our tormented flesh
North winds are screaming as brothers fall
Engulfed by salvation of death

Riding through the fog
Hundred thousand men
One for all

Heading east - Attack
Heading east - Attack
Russians retreating beyond the horizon

Heading east - Attack
Heading east - Attack
We've gone way too far to turn back

Hunger craves as we're marching on
Further through the ashes of Hell
Scorched earths greet the anxiety
And the teardrops of horses and men

Riding through the fog
Hundred thousand men
One for all

Heading east - Attack
Heading east - Attack
Russians retreating beyond the horizon

Heading east - Attack
Heading east - Attack
We've gone way too far to turn back

Riding through the fog
Hundred thousand men
Kill them all

Heading east - Attack
Heading east - Attack
Russians retreating beyond the horizon

Heading east - Attack
Heading east - Attack
We've gone...

Heading east - Attack
Heading east - Attack
Russians retreating beyond the horizon

Heading east - Attack
Heading east - Attack
We've gone way too far to turn back
