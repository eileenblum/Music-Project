Silent screams, you know they are for real
When our bullets cut through the night
Enemies for years, a battle once again
On this day the bloodshed begins
Running through the fields, wires in the way
Take cover, Ambush ahead
Crawling through the mud, firing my gun
Adrenaline pushes me through

Target dead ahead, my flame is burning strong
Got you in my sight, prepare to meet your maker
All lined up to die, concrete cold as Hell
Trapped inside their cage, my fire will light up the night

Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn

They all deserve to die

The battle rages on, our enemies are back
We have to defend our front
Killing just for fun, what have I become?
A hero without no regret
Why do I feel so lost? This pain I cannot stand
Focus, there's no turning back
We're breaking through their lines, bodies everywhere
Let's burn them and finish the job

Target dead ahead, my flame is burning strong
Got you in my sight, prepare to meet your maker
All lined up to die, concrete cold as Hell
Trapped inside their cage, my fire will light up the night

Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn

They all deserve to die

I fight to come home, I fight to be free
I fight for my brothers forever with me
Side by side to the grave

I fight to come home, I fight to be free
I fight for my brothers forever with me
Side by side we stand as one

Target dead ahead, my flame is burning strong
Got you in my sight, prepare to meet your maker
All lined up to die, concrete cold as Hell
Trapped inside their cage, my fire will light up the night

Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn

They all deserve to die

Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn
Don't shoot - Let 'em burn

They all deserve to die
