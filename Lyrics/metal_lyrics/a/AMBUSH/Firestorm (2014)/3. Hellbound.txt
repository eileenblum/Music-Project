Struck down by light and thunder
Paralyzed by the spell you're under
Ice cold still fires are burning
You've crossed a line of no returning

Watch out - They're coming to get you
Dark shadow - Watching over you

Hellbound
Hellbound

Lost track, stuck down below
Terrorized by wicked souls
Slaving under eternal torture
Poor child, there's no one there to hear you

Watch out - They're coming to get you
Dark shadow - Watching over you

Hell's fire burning, in the afterlife
Hell's fire burning, in the afterlife
Hell's fire burning, in the afterlife
Hell's fire burning

Hell's fire burning, in the afterlife
Hell's fire burning, in the afterlife
Hell's fire burning, in the afterlife
Hell's fire burning
