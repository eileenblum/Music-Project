Here we stand, together unite
Come on boys, we're ready to fight
See how we rise into the air
Shining bright, like an evening flare

Stand up - Let's fight for king and queen
Shout out - Let us hear you scream
Hear up - The voices are for real

So come with us tonight and make your wrong things right
Ambush are there for you, ready for the fight
Into the night, were the wrong is right
Ambush are there for you, ready for the fight

So get ready!

See the stars, they all shine for us
We play all night as long as you're in sight
See how we rise into the air
Ambush is the name, this is our game

Stand up - Let's fight for king and queen
Shout out - Let us hear you scream
Hear up - The voices are for real

So come with us tonight and make your wrong things right
Ambush are there for you, ready for the fight
Into the night, were the wrong is right
Ambush are there for you, ready for the fight

So come with us tonight and make your wrong things right
Ambush are here for you, ready for the fight
Into the night, were the wrong is right
Ambush are there for you, ready for the fight
