His eyes are watching over me
They follow me whenever I go
But I'm hiding in the shadows of insanity
Depending on the bottle when the night so cold

I was looking for someone to break the fast forward living
You said we've all got the power to come home

I closed my eyes
And dreamed away
To my darkest hour
To hide my shame away

To blind to see the world in front of me
Standing with my back against the wall
Illusions breaking loose and take control of me
I'm living for tomorrow, delirium

I was looking for someone to break the fast forward living
You said we've all got the power to come home

I closed my eyes
And dreamed away
To my darkest hour
To hide my shame away

I closed my eyes!

I was looking for someone to break the fast forward living
You said we've all got the power to come home

I closed my eyes
And dreamed away
To my darkest hour
To hide my shame

I closed my eyes
Into my darkest hour
I hide my shame away
