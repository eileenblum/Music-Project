The night has come
I'm feeling shivers from the dark
On empty streets the mist is gone
I'm hearing footsteps I begin to run
A creature shows
A shadow is rising, I can see his eyes
I turn my head to find my way
My mind is black, now I want to stay

The world is turning black - Turn black
And the sun won't shine tonight
The world is turning black - Turn black
And the sun won't shine through this darkness

I kneel for the crown and the ring
Kneel for the kingdom of whom I hail
I hail you thy master of pain
Are you from Heaven or Hell?

He is closing in
His arm is reaching out for me
My nemesis has got me now
This I my time I know for sure

It's back in black again - He's back
And my mind is full of fear
The arm that reaches out - Reach out
Takes my soul back into darkness

I run the crown and the ring
I run from Heaven or Hell
I'm running alone in despair
Am I gonna survive here?

Go! Go away
I can't run, run from him
From the dawn, dawn of time
He has been here watching you

Fight, fight my way
Away from this plague chasing me
The fog blows away I see a light
Here we're all gonna die someday

I kneel for the crown and the ring
Kneel for the kingdom of whom I hail
I hail you thy master of pain
Are you from Heaven or Hell?

I run from the crown and the ring
I'm running away from him
Running alone in despair
And I'm gonna survive here?
