Bound by chains of metal in their heads
Human lives so brittle, soon be dead
From the mist she rises, leaving ground
Vengeance strike upon thee, evil sound

Nothing last forever
When nature is in for the kill

Fire raging downhill, spits out Hell
Prayers count for nothing, hear death knell
Helpless in this chaos, run in vain
Like a lightning striking, scream in pain

Nothing last forever
When nature is in for the kill

Firestorm, Firestorm
Striking hard and striking fast
Firestorm, Firestorm
Striking hard and striking fast

Bound by chains of metal in their heads
Human lives so brittle, soon be dead
From the mist she rises, leaving ground
Vengeance strike upon thee, evil sound

Nothing last forever
When nature is in for the kill

Firestorm, Firestorm
Striking hard and striking fast
Firestorm, Firestorm
Striking hard and striking fast

Striking hard and striking fast!

Firestorm, Firestorm
Striking hard and striking fast
Firestorm, Firestorm
Striking hard

Firestorm, Firestorm
Striking hard and striking fast
Firestorm, Firestorm
