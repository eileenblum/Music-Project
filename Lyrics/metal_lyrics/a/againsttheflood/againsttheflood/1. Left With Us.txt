Submerged
Condemned, alone again
A last attempt to change your ways
And so fucking desperate to keep your new hopes above the waves
Forced to take your last breath
Forced to take the last step
Bound to a fate, in an instant made to choose your god
Your pulled beneath

Awaiting a sign as your life draws to an end
with  an open mouth and with closed eyes
you lose direction, a glazed perception
is this drowning?
A gasp of air and a moment to breathe
Your Last chance at faith

Out of shadows you crawl, secure your sins are forgiven
Forgotten but still left with us Still left with us!
A sudden change of heart leaves desire within reach of tomorrow
is this too late!

You can taste the air, you can see the light
youâve gained direction, a new perception
Am I alive?
A gasp of air and a moment to breathe
Are second chances always enough?
Are second chances always enough?
A reason to make a change
when scars and bruises stain the lives of us
Stain the lives of us
Scars and bruises
Blacken the lives of us

Out of shadows you crawl, secure your sins are forgiven
Forgotten but still left with us Still left with us!

Condemned, alone again
A last attempt to change your ways
And so fucking desperate to keep your new hopes above the waves

A sudden change of heart leaves desire within reach of tomorrow
is this too late!
