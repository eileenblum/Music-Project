Weak, Powerless
These things can only be said so many times before they turn to fears
We all suffer from our insecurities
Take a shot before they tear us apart

speak out in a world so cold
Were sick of this fucking shit
and with nothing to prove
Letâs make one thing clear
Take my hand
Weâll find ourselves again

Its only a matter of time before these feelings bring you to your knees
Its so easy to be mislead when dying to be saved
Dying to be saved

What would it take to see this through
to know youâre not alone
follow me out to reach the end and save yourself
what would it take to see this through
to restore a piece of mind
and make a change

speak out in a world so cold
Were sick of this fucking shit
and with nothing to prove
Letâs make one thing clear
Take my hand
Weâll find ourselves again

they brought this on themselves
they should have know by now we cannot take this
we cannot take this
draw a line in the sand  and choose your side
they brought this on themselves
they should have know by now
we cannot take this

we stand together
take a shot before they tear you apart

thereâs no reason behind this
follow me out to the end
Iâll draw a line in the sand choose your side

speak out in a world so cold
were sick of this fucking shit
with nothing to prove
Letâs make one thing clear With nothing to prove
