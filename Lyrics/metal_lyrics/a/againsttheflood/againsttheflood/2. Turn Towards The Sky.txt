Lost,
dead to the world,
itâs too late to make amends,
alone were helpless

I wonât waste another moment in this place
we canât take it back
The time we seek we cannot hold in our hands
itâs always gone in the blink of an eye

dead to the world
too late to make amends,
alone were faithless

we count the seconds as the world passes by
standing still fading with the days

as darkness fills my eyes
and In this moment I grasp If this is the end I know I am not afraid
I turn towards the sky as the meaning becomes so clear

No point turning back

seasons change no matter what pain weâve suffered
in the light of a new day make your move

we count up the seconds as the world passes by
standing still fading with the days

I stand here alone staring straight into the distance
it was all simple once the further we fall the more desperate we search for forgiveness
my path left in ruin behind me,
hope still awaits Iâve made it this far

and In this moment I grasp If this is the end I know I am not afraid
I turn towards the sky as the meaning becomes so clear No point turning back
seasons change no matter what pain weâve suffered
with the light of a new day make your move

make your fucking move

Itâs Too Late
I stand here alone staring straight into the distance
it was all simple once
the further we fall the more desperate we search for forgiveness
my path left in ruin behind me, hope still awaits Iâve made it this far

Weâve made it this far
