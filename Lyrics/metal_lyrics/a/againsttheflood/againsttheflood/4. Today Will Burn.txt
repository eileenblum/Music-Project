How can you turn your back on this                
Leave me standing here alone
with a head full of broken dreams
And my heart in my hands

Thereâs nothing left for me now
I Have nothing left to lose

Youâve taken everything
I canât wait to see the change in you
With heartless intentions iâll drag you down
I would have pulled you apart by now

Pulled you apart by now

How can you turn your back on this
Leave me standing here alone

And all these memories will slowly fade away
The circumstances will never be the same again

A new day will come
And today will burn
Today will burn

With heartless intentions iâll drag you down
I would have pulled you apart by now
