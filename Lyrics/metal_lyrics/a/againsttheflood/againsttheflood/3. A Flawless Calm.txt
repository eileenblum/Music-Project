How can you stand there and expect me to believe the lies
a flawless calm
so quick to change your mind

Bite your tongue
The tables turn no more
For I can see its guilt that holds your halo high

Without a trace Iâll place these hands around your neck
Iâve tried my best in leaving you
Gave myself too many chances to see this through

If only you would see
Another attempt to open your eyes
you back away
Blinded by the truth you fail to see the reason why
It turned out this way
Shading the fold before you fall

Thereâs nothing left
but you continue to scrape the surface
Thereâs nothing left
You got what you came for

The tables turn no more
For I can see through your twisted point of view

You got what you came for
Iâve felt this way before
I thought you were better than this
you got what you came for
I thought you were better than this
The tables turn no more
If only you would listen

Without a trace Iâll place these hands around your neck
Iâve tried my best in leaving you
Gave myself too many chances to see this through
Without a trace Iâll place these hands around your neck
Iâve tried my best in leaving you
Gave myself too many chances to see this through

If only you would see
Another attempt to open your eyes
you back away
Blinded by the truth you fail to see the reason why
It turned out this way
