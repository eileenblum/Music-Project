[music: Etelavuori, lyrics: Joutsen]

I, I woke up
The God of fire woke me up
At the edge of burning ground
I'm, I'm damned
To put out the fire
My hand is a trap for that fire

It won't surprise me in my dream
My dream wakes me up, instantly
Without a word my hand is a trap
Trap for that fire

I, I drown it with water
I kill it on the spot
It won't have time to run far
It won't get away from me
