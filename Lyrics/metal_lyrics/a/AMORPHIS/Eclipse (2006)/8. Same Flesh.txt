[music: Kallio, lyrics: Joutsen]

That's what my sister says
And during that day
Came spring and summer
Oh, when did you fly here?
It was you that I found
The same flesh and blood

(My flesh) It was you that I found
(My blood) It was you that I met
One just like me, same flesh and blood
(My flesh) It was you that I found
(My blood) It was you that I met
One just like me, my flesh and blood

A hard place, this world
And nowhere else
Does one make so many mistakes?
What's done is done
Done and gone
The same flesh and blood
