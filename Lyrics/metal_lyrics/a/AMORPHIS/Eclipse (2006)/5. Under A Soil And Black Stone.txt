[music: Kallio, lyrics: Koivusaari]

No longer I was breathing
No more bleeding
Inside the urn
Under a soil and black stone
Under a soil and black stone

And I was listening
And felt no pain
To the sunrise to east
I'll leave my grief

To the stars shine
Casting my eyes by the long nights
Blessed I was
To rest then
Inside the urn
Under a soil and black stone

Soil upon me
So fragile
As a veil
Without secrets
The staring
Space so wide
