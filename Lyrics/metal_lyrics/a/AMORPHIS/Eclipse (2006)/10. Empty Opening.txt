[music: Holopainen, lyrics: Joutsen]

A beautiful day when it's over
Clouds high up in the sky
A beautiful day when it's over
Nobody will bury me

In this wicked world the war I live
In this wicked world to war I go
Here's my good life, the best I ever have
How did I get here?

Beautiful yard, trees up against the sky
There is an empty opening
They only live for one summer
This world is too good for me
