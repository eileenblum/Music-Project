[music: Holopainen, lyrics: Joutsen]

Fate changed
Life healed like a wound
How does the kind of life heal
That leaves such a scar?
I cover myself, I uncover myself

Now I know how to do things
Now longer will I listen to any talk
Now I know and it's working
Everything hurts inside of me

Out from the frozen lake
She finally grew into her full might
She grew from a tiny thing
On this lake as I drove there to meet her
