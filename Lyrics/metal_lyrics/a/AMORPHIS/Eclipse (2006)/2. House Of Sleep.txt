[music: Holopainen, lyrics: Joutsen]

I will never sleep alone (never without you)
Whatever you say to me
I already know
If I said something to you
You would take those words
There's so much power in those words

(You don't know) You don't know nothing yet
About the dreams I have
I will make you sleep
(You don't know) You don't know nothing yet
About the dreams I have
Sleep is a house for lovers

You will be the mistress (of that house)
You will be given the wide belt
And the big key to the gate
If I said something to you
You would take those words
There's so much power in those words
