[Bonus Track]

[Lyrics are based on a single tale from Kalevala, Kullervo's Story]

[music: Koivusaari, lyrics: Joutsen]

You have a woman here
One made of stone
You made her for yourself
You piled her up
Made a stone face
Stone fingers and eyes

There's no room beside her
For another woman
Alive and breathing one

It makes me sad to see
You have made a woman
Out of rock and wood
Grasses and tree bark
To lie beside you, beside you

I made that stone woman
For you to see me and say
I am here
