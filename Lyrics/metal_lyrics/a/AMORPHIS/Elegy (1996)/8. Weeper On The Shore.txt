In the vale where I once listened out for the light
Where the little birds warble
The ptarmigans babble
And my heart looked for some rest from its trouble

I cast my eyes downward upon the seaside
And a fair young girl on the shore I espied
Who was sitting and weeping
To see the waves leaping
And over the skyline sad vigil was keeping.

O why are you weeping alone on the shore?
Now still from your eyes I can see the tears pour.
What sorrow and smart
So pierces your heart
That even at midnight it will not depart?
