Mother wept for her son
she wept and sang
anxiously pndered fate
his and her own

A sun's ray, in through the eye
glimmered in the room of mind
changing the woman shape
sorrow fled her face

From the shaman into shaman

From the chimney a witch flew out
shaman dived across the sky
under her the woods and lakes
till she saw the Northland gates

I have come for my son, where is my son?
I accept no lies, no falsehoods or deception
I'll send you plagues unnumbered
destruction upon your house
I lay to waste your treasures
and slay your fairest daughter

The queen of north told the way
the road to River Black
impossible and incomplete
the path of no return
