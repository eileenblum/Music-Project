You live only for yourself
Or send your soul to the heaven's grace
Been weak as the autumn leaves
Or strong as the growing seed
Swallowed into the black
Search for entrace

[Chorus:]
Watch to the eyes of morning star
Beckon for the savior
But it's much too far
Reach for the infinity
The only thing that remains is decay
