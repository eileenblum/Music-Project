My soul is bleeding
I feel so small
Afraid that this will never end
I can't understand the pain in my bones
I sleep through another trance

Climb over the rainbow
From here you can see so much
I need someone to take me down
But who can you trust

[Chorus:]
Got so many things to say
But it's something I don't wanna be
Gotta get away case it's time to shine
Like a fallen angel I run
I won't ever see the sun
See the circle is now complete
Yet the harvest remains undone

Where hemlock grows and vermin crowl
All dreams descend with fear
Crushed by the darkness that wells inside
That beast I hold so dear
