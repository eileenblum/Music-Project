When I am broken, when I depart
When my eyes stray from yours
When I no longer know you, my love
When I am broken, when I depart

Fear not for me, weep not for me
For finally I am released
Fear not for me, weep not for me
To the heaven of all earths
I am released

When from my head my mane is torn
When my hair is blowing in solar wind
When into my eyes driven are the nails
When weighted boots march across my grave

Donât you fear
