Silk of blue woven by the moon
Red spun by the sun
Of the sunâs gold

Silver in wrists and in her rings
Hair braided in red
Her shoes featherlight

As reeds and straws on the shore
As bark and foliage
As clamshells and sand

My maidenâs flesh
Now fish in the lake deeps
Her blood now waters blue

Oh god of sleep
Tell in my dream
Where has my maiden gone
Where lies my mermaid now

Rise above the waves
From the watersâ grave
From the side of spottled stones
Become alive again

These shores are for memory
These waters not for baiting
No shallows for the thirsty

No sun beheld above these shores
No reflection of the moon on these waters here

My maidenâs hair
Grass on the watersâ edge
Now willows on a shore
