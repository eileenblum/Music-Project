I have a wish to sing
Of time before the beginning
When nothing was all
But how to sing of nothing?

So I sing of the beginning
The birth of all creation
The borders of nothingness
The substance of inception

The solitude of space my uncaring mother
My father salt of the sea

Still unborn I remained
Unopened the narrow gate
Unborn in my hiding place
No release by my maker

Wrapped around my darkness
I knew my that time was waiting
I felt the passage of days and nights
And northern stars

The solitude of space my uncaring mother
My father salt of the sea
The void and infinity were never ending
Time had no beginning

The songs were born into my mind
The knowledge of the stars
The stories before and after
The spells of war and peace

The birth of the world was my birth too
I found the land, began the time
From shorelessness of the sea
From underneath the space

I have a wish to sing
Of time before the beginningâ¦
