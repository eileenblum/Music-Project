On the blue waters of mermaids
I was sailing on the blue
Brought up a catch of strangest wonder
On the blue

And I drew my knife to gut
What I had taken from the blue
But it was gone, back to the lake
And vanished into the blue

The waters, they parted
As she rose to shine

She was my maid, my wife-to-be
Returned to me this one time
I did not know her, I made her flee
Flee from me

Beneath the waves and marbled rocks
Watery canyon of blackest depths
My hope was sunk
My dream taken away

Woe to you, she said to me
As she broke cover of the blue
Donât you know me?
I couldnât be yours after all
I never knew
