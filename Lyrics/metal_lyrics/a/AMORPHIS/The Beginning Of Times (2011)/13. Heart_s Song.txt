[Bonus Track]The spirit of clouds I am...
and the spring creeks singing...
A stillness within a river great...
A rainbow on the falls...
A blackness of waters...
The spirit of man...
In a warrior straw-haired

I am not a god...
I am not a god...
A man I'm not...
I am my people, the song of my tribe...
The wisdom and the skills...
A sword turned into poem...

I am the oaken sage...
The bone-hurting one...
The boulder on some riverside...
The eye of the golden hawk...
The embrace of red bear...
The song in the heart...
In the heart of the man...

I am not a god...
I am not a god...
A man I'm not...
I am my people, the song of my tribe...
The wisdom and the skills...
A sword turned into poem...

I am not a god...
I am not a god...
A man I'm not...
I am my people, the song of my tribe...
The wisdom and the skills...
A sword turned into poem...
