From all the four corners
From the heights beyond the changing skies
From in between the golden stars
From lands of dead below

I seek the magic for my spell
The power for my charm
For want of three words
For want of three words for my song

Three words for my magic song
A boat for love Iâd carve
Three words for my magic song
A craft of life Iâd build

Along the Tuoni pathway
To gloomy shore
Across the lands of dead
To find the missing charm

Deathâs maiden showed the way
To deathâs grim abode
Where deathâs wife offered me
Deathâs drink to have

Three words for magic
Three words from Death
