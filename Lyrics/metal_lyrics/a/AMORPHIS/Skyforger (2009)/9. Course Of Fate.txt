Got a maid from the lands of north
A wife from lands of strange
The work of gods was at last replaced
By days and nights of men

She wakes beside me
She stands by me
She stares at our sky
She lives our lives

In the beginning of all time the sounds of war
I sanctified for work
Cries of terror harmonized to a song
Spirits of wrath restrained

And now dead is my wife
Ripped apart by iron teeth
Slashed by the claws of steel
The ancient venom surfaced again

She lies in the ground
She's gone from me
She stares without eyes
She stares at me

Poisoned by the bane of riches
Betrayed by lies manifold
Slain by avenger
The ancient venom turned the course of fate

She woke beside me
She stood by me
She stared at our sky
And lived our life
