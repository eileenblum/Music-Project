Sparks sent flying, my mind thundering
The room of my heart flashing to the sky
The flaring of fumes fill my senses
Pervade this room and this space

The days they blend into the nights
The moon, the sun unite
Order of stars expires
A wonder is born

I listen and aim, I observe
I use all the forces and let it transpire
I confront the darkness absolute
And blinding, dazzling brilliance

From roaring flames the shapes emerge
Come forth they do with vile charms
Their poisoned core hides in beauty
But I see and perceive their deceit, I see

Into the blaze I shove them back
To lose their forms to the hungry fire
Again and yet again
I start my work anew
Again and again
I start my work again
