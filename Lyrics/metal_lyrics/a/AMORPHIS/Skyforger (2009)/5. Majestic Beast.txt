In the bowels of rocky mountain
A fiery bird I forged
Forged from iron, from molten steel
A flaming eagle majestic beast

On the wings of my eagle
To black river I flew
To the dale of the dead
To the stream that grinds all flesh

The eagle soared sky high
Touched the vault of heaven
The sky sparkled
Cracked and creaked

The eagle soared sky high
Soared my flaming griffin
The thunder crashed and rolled
Rolled the monster's head

I found a monster, a black giant pike
From it's jaws my eagle saved me
Dragged the fish under the sun
Split it's belly, ripped the head off

I rolled the pike's head to the house of the north
I threw the bony skull at they haughty queen
Here's a throne for you to rest your frozen bones
I have done my share, now keep your promise

I had made the heavens
Forged out a miracle
The snake infested field of death turned over
Slayed the wolf of shadow lands
Shackled the bear of death
I captured the impossible
The pike from the black river
