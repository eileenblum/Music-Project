Excursing from existence
Life flows away
Locks for arching will confused
Reach me stares pain

Ex-salvation dismal function
Life like dream fault really

Rebel decoying in ecstasy
We have propelled, we don't cry
Time with mercy
With alive past

Excursing from existence

I come out from other side
I come from sun feast upon
Domination of the other side... side
Excursing from existence


Thanks to r_baas for sending track #6 lyrics.
