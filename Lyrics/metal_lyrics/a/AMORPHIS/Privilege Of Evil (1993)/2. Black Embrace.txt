[Music: Koivusaari, Holopainen, Lyrics: Rechberger]

Terror, when the darkness binds your limbs
Terror, when the fear freezes your nerves
Horror, when the pain climbs up your veins
Darkness, creeping under you skin

Moment of life,
When we all have to choose,
Which way to go
And for whom to sacrifice your life

Invoke the god - pray
To lead you back to life - pray
Cursed by religion - hate
Learned upon church - fake

In the verge of hell,
Of human mind
Redemption of your soul,
As darkness binds you tight

Moment of life,
When we all have to choose,
Which way to go
And for whom to sacrifice your life
