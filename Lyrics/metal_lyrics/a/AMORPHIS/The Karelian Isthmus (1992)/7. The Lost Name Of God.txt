[lyrics: J. Rechberger]
[music: E. Holopainen, T. Koivusaari &amp; J. Rechberger]

We have to know, we have to see
Religions so many, which one of them are so real,
That it makes us to believe ?
Crushing the chains of faith

To find the way of immortality,
We're hiding behind the cross
To find shelter,
we're searching for the name of god

In this maze of hatred
The name of god is lost

Under the flag of salvation
we are cleared this land of pagans
Under the cover of Christianity,
we stained our hands in blood

At these times of anguish
The name of God is lost

"I saw the coming of the end,
 Sun stopped its shining,
 Air is no longer fresh,
 Then it was too late to realize,
 that we can't breathe our hate."

The lost name of God
