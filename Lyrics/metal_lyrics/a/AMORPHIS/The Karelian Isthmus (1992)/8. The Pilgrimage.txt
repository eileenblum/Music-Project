[lyrics: E. Holopainen]
[music: T. Koivusaari]

In his eyes
The evil spirit rise
Turns to darkness with Satan's name

"As the time is right
 dead bodies rise up from their graves
 And when the time comes near
 Oh, I see the prince of glory"

Holy month
Sacred hounds
Under the hill
Do you hear their call
