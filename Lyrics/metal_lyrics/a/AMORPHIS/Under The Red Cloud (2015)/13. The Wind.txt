You are the wind, my wind
A portent of good things to come
You bring me warmth in your breath
Make me believe in tomorrow
Guide me
On my path

When you drive the storm clouds in the sky
Even then you are my wind
Even then you are my wind
When you drown all my hopes in snow
Even then you are my wind
Even then you are my wind

When you cool my fevered brow
Cradle me in evening's peace
When you awake in the night
And tear the leaves from the trees

You bring me warmth in your breath
Make me believe in tomorrow

Guide me
On my path

When you drive the storm clouds in the sky
Even then you are my wind
Even then you are my wind
When you drown all my hopes in snow
Even then you are my wind
Even then you are my wind
Guide me
On my path

When you drive the storm clouds in the sky
Even then you are my wind
Even then you are my wind
Scare away the sleeping birds below
And root out the ancient trees
Even then you are my wind
