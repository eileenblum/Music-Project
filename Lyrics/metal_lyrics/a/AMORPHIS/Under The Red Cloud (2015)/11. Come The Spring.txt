Dream weavers above me
The wildfowl arriving
As a crane flies through me
I know that she will come
Leaves sprout from my horns
And sap flows from my eyes
Crackle the gravel and sand
In the pits of me white ribs

Come the spring
I and reborn
The wind lays down beside me
My dream already fades
Oh come the spring
Iâll live again
The blackened ice is melting
Swirling in my eyes

The boulders of giants
Are rolling down my slopes
In the streams of my old veins
I carry sand for the golden reefs
As blood-red buds in the snow
Flowers will rise from the ground
The deer will come a-grazing
And the bear must be awake

Come the spring
I and reborn
The wind lays down beside me
My dream already fades
Oh come the spring
Iâll live again
The blackened ice is melting
Swirling in my eyes
