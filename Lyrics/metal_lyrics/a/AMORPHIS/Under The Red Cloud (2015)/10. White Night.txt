Our lady of the sun
Sees to us day and night
Our lady of the moon
Sees to us night and day

Our way of warmth and light
Night will not becloud our path
The spirits of our kin
Wisdom flows through mystery

Only the stars
Only the stars are gone
Only the stars
Only the stars are gone
Enchanted we bow
To a dewdrop on the grass
Glowing with hidden fire
Of our burning midnight sun

Only the stars
Only the stars are gone
Only the stars
Only the stars are gone

In the white night of the north
The pearl-white spirits are lost
Strayed from their summery path
Into the frail twilight
In the white night of the north
The pearl-white spirits are lost
Strayed from their summery path
Into the frail twilight

In the white night of the north
The pearl-white spirits are lost
Strayed from their summery path
Into the frail twilight
In the white night of the north
The pearl-white spirits are lost
Strayed from their summery path
Into the frail twilight
