Somewhere thereâs a tree of ages
Havens hanging from the branches
Cradling worlds beneath its shadows
It seeds give birth to tomorrow
Universes coil its trunk
And heavens rush above its crown
It dances without moving
It is the tree of ages

It is the tree of ages

Like our promises and wishes
Die its flowers along with its leaves
Like drops of blood the leaf buds open
Like sights the fruit falls down
Universes coil its trunk
The dawn shimmers on its crown
Day turns to gold its leaves
It is the tree of ages

It is the tree of ages

Night call the solitary god
Night falls all lights shall bow in awe

Night call the solitary god
Night falls all lights shall bow in awe
Night call the solitary god
Night falls and these lights shall bow in awe
