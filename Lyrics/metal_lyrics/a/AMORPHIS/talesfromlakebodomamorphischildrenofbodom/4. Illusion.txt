[performed by Amorphis]I stand in the outskirts
Of a blazing central fire
I blend into shadows
And hide withing the night
At this final moment
It appears in front of me
Like swelling of the bones
And horns emerge from the skull

The world's distance song
And the cries from the dark
Can't hear them anymore
It's all an illusion
The song forms the world
And the dark hides the cries
Can't hear them anymore
It's all an illusion

I touch my forehead
I feel the scars on my wounds
Why don't you speak to me now
Have you come from within

Have you come from within
To show me the way
