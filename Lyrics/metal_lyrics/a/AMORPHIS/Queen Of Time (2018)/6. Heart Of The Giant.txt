The sky had rustled red
The birds grew quiet and fell
The day no longer turned
Night fell on the world
The river ran murky with poison
The land was desolate and black
The bees had left the valley
The orchards were hacked down

The huts and castles were deserted
The dusty roads were crowded
In another direction I ran

Through a deep crack in the
Mountain I slipped
Descended into the otherworld
Through a deep crack in the
Mountain I slipped
Into dark death in Manala's stream I dove

I was carried by the rapids
And my blood began to rush
Then the river turned into a vein
The vein into a crimson hall

And on its walls flickered the pictures
Of our world, eternally dancing
The hall pealed and rumble

Through a deep crack in the
Mountain I slipped
Descended into the otherworld
Through a deep crack in the
Mountain I slipped
Into dark death in Manala's stream I dove

And on its walls flickered the pictures
Of our world, eternally dancing
The hall pealed and rumble
For deep down in the mountain of time
They painted out our lives
Songs of triumph silenced
Faded and died

Through a deep crack in the
Mountain I slipped
Descended into the otherworld
Through a deep crack in the
Mountain I slipped
Into dark death in Manala's stream I dove
