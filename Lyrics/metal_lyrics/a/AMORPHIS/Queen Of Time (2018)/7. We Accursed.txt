Sat on our throne
On the top of the mountain
In the nightside of the world
Under a crown of stone
We the doomed
To our boulders we are chained

We accursed
Turned to stone
We accursed
Shackled to our thrones
We accursed
Bound to each other
Shackled by hatred
Shackled to our thrones

Turned to stone
We the enchanted
We lost, we lost our lives
Cast in the mould of death
Forfeit what was dear to us
Gave away our hearts and sealed our fate
Our fate

We accursed
We accursed

Forfeit, what was dear to us
Gave away our hearts and sealed
Our fate

We accursed
Turned to stone
We accursed
Shackled to our thrones
We accursed
Bound to each other
Shackled by hatred
Shackled to our thrones

Shackled to our thrones
