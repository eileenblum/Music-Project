The mountains crumble
Turn to dust in the breeze
Fade in solar winds
Plunge into the depths
Boulders crack
Ground by mills of time

But on the verge of the chasm of time
Crawling, the spider of chaos
And its spark of divine beauty
Snatches the last grain of sand

Overwhelming and eternal
The highest peaks of mountains
Turn the strips of dust
As the heavens turn
The mountains tumble
And seas will come to boil

But on the verge of the chasm of time
Crawling, the spider of chaos
And its spark of divine beauty
Snatches the last grain of sand

And all will be born again
As the shores of time takes shape
The seed of iron will sprout
And the sea will sing its song

But on the verge of the chasm of time
Crawling, the spider of chaos
And its spark of divine beauty
Snatches the last grain of sand
