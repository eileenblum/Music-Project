[Tomi Joutsen]
Close your eyes now
And give in to the night
Soar above the stars
Forget what's behind
Don't stare up at the setting sun
Or the light of dawn

[Anneke van Giersbergen]
Follow the thread of gold
Drift on its tide
It's a path of stars
Ride on the golden stream
And break the waves
In a gilded trail of stars

[Tomi Joutsen and Anneke van Giersbergen in turns]
Rise, Rise
Above the golden way of stars
Rise, Rise
Beyond the trail of stars

[Tomi Joutsen]
The light will lure you
To lands forged by demise
To the shores of death
The blooming meadows
Seduce and intoxicate
With a deceiving scent

[Anneke van Giersbergen]
Follow the thread of gold
Drift on its tide
It's a path of stars
Ride on the golden stream
And break the waves
In a trail of stars

[Anneke van Giersbergen]
I've seen the lights up in the sky
Like beacons from another shore
So don't look back, don't look a head
Just close your eyes, give in to the night

[Tomi Joutsen]
Close your eyes
And give in to the night
Soar above the stars
The blooming meadows
Seduce and intoxicate
With a deceiving scent

[Anneke van Giersbergen]
Follow the thread of gold
Drift on its tide
It's a path of stars
Ride on the golden stream
And break the waves
In a gilded trail of stars

[Tomi Joutsen and Anneke van Giersbergen in turns]
Rise, rise, rise
Above the golden way of stars
Rise, rise, rise
Beyond the trail of stars
