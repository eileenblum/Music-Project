The night thickened into black earth
The ground sparked under my feet
I didn't know the stars had tumbled down
And that earth had turned into sky

I should have understood
I should have seen it coming
The signs on the road have changed
The fires on the mountain died

I should have understood
I should have seen it coming
The signs on the road have changed
The fires on the mountain died

I felt ascending but I really sunk
Everything had turned upside down
As I was traveling to the mountain peak
I had dug into the grave of all hope

I should have understood
I should have seen it coming
The signs on the road have changed
The fires on the mountain died

I should have understood
I should have seen it coming
The signs on the road have changed
The fires on the mountain died

Why did I not follow the bear-star
Why did I shun the advice of my brothers
Why did I not study the signs of the heavens
Why did I silenced the words of my sisters

I should have understood
I should have seen it coming
The signs on the road have changed
The fires on the mountain died

I should have understood
I should have seen it coming
The signs on the road have changed
The fires on the mountain died

Why did I shun the advice of brothers
(The fires on the mountain died)
Why did I silenced the words of sisters
(The fires on the mountain died)
