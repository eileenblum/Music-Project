Do not doubt her wisdom
Don't resist her call
Just follow in her footsteps
For she will not wait
She bears her treasure
Carries it before her footsteps
Be ever alert
For she will not wait

The keeper of fleeting moment
She's the Golden Elk
The mother of time and tide
The shaper of destinies
The keeper of fleeting moment
She's the Golden Elk
The mother of time and tide

Do not hesitate then
Don't resist her call
Be ever alert
For she will not wait
The Queen of Time
Gives you the direction
Predicts your path
The one that you must follow
The Queen of Time

The keeper of fleeting moment
She's the Golden Elk
The mother of time and tide
The shaper of destinies
The keeper of fleeting moment
She's the Golden Elk
The mother of time and tide

If you see her as a ghost in
Winter's blizzard
Sense her in the shy sunset of spring
Hear her as a rustle in summer's night
See through her autumn wood's disguise

The keeper of fleeting moment
She's the Golden Elk
The mother of time and tide
The shaper of destinies
The keeper of fleeting moment
She's the Golden Elk
The mother of time and tide
The shaper of destinies

If you thought you heard her voice
If you think you saw her shape
The Queen of Time
If the wind brought you her scent
If you tracked her on your trail
The Queen of Time
