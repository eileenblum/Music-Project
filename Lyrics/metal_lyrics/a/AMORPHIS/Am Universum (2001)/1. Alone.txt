Tear dimmed rememberance
In a womb of time
Breath upon me
Possessed by the passion
Fate will set you free
Infertile
Chased be the precious
When flesh is an enemy
Fair weather man

[pre-chorus:]
Step aside from the way of a better man than you
So you fall at his feet he's the one who betrays you
It's the servants devotion for the decay
Stand up

[chorus:]
There are no flowers on your grave
There are no chains
There I keep chanting for the forgotten name

Why you feel so empty
And still have everything
It's fullfilment
I've got more companions
When I'm all alone
Flesh is fetching
