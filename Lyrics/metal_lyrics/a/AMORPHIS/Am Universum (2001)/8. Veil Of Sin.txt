For the cold pale women
I leave some of my goodness
I leave the veil of sin
And let go my dreams

[pre-chorus:]
Eternity follows me everywhere
Your words so hollow won't go anywhere
Distant shadows disappears
It searches the gate beyond the stars

And there I can see her again

[chorus:]
Tell me why you have to be so pure and wrong
And I'm alive to be here

Is it just an omen
Is it me walking blindly
I will find the answer
When I wake up from my dream

[pre-chorus]

And there I can kill her again

[chorus]
