Once I was there
Standing outside
Looking in
Beside my window
Smiling face, shattering
It's an old man's pride
That climbs over understanding
It wasn't your child
That I was hurting

[pre-chorus:]
And I turn my back to the world
Well I don't care
What can I say if I see you all as dead

[chorus:]
Under the dying sun it comes
Weaving fear but I have none
I know that mushroom cloud
Won't come very near
What do you have to believe in
And all the poison you breath in
The crystal heart shatters within

Once I was there
Standing outside
Moving in
Inside my window
Crying face, shattering
Take all that you have
And leave the rest for today
It's the old folk's sign
That took away your chastidy

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]
