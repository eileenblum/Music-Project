Your helping hand is killing me
If you see me suffer it's not your victory
Sadistic forms of new way discipline
Like I love myself I love to sin

[pre-chorus:]
And I want more
And I want it low
Of course you wont forgive me
But I wont crawl

Look out for number one
I pray on you it has begun
Let the night stand one thousand years
Longstanding, everlasting
Breathless masquerade
I'm your devil in disguise

[pre-chorus]

[chorus:]
Grieve stricken heart
Calls upon you
Grieve stricken heart
My only look you fools
I love my misery too

I'm the one to see your collapse
I'm on the side of destruction
On the side of black and I love to sin
Mentally transmitted disease
Rotten wretched attraction
And I love myself

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]
