I walk down to the seashore
To bury my hate
I wait till the morning of the mourning
But it's too late
Down to the seashore
Through the illuminous gate
You wait for tomorrow but today is today
No one can understand my pain

[chorus:]
Find me the ocean
Where waters stand still
Nothing can befall evermore
Find me the ocean which swallows all that floats
It's time to prevail your conspiracy

It's a whisper of a dead man
I've heard it before
It's yearning my emotions
Before I was born
It was only delusion
Of illuminous gate
Left only confusion
'cause today is the day

[chorus]

Calm is the breath that breaks the circle of silence
Like the whisper of a dying man
Who was born in his own funeral
Time is right for the twisted one
Guide me to the center of the vicious goal
You're my prey, kiss my arrow the silver
