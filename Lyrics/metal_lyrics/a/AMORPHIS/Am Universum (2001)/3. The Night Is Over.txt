We craved the light from the darkness
It's a morning of misfortune
The dawn of a mankind
Listen to me instead of a blind folk's speak
Forget the mature plan
We are but humans you'll see

[chorus:]
I can hear the silence
See invisible emptiness
Tarnish the halo of your guidance
And the night is over

That women in grief
Luxurious gehenna
And what I have become
What I have done to you
Listen to me instead of a blind folk's speak
Forget the mature plan
We are but humans you'll see

[chorus]
