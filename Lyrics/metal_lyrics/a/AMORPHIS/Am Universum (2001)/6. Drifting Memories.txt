How does it feel
Blessed to receive
Be modest and forgiving
How does it feel
You can try to hate me
But you're only hurting yourself

[chorus:]
Drifting in your shady memories
Where to go when sorrow breeds
Let the fear run through
Breath in black and stiffling air
All those words they disappear
No need to rest it's too early to die

You don't have to say
Why rue for that day
When you've open up your eyes again
Now it's your fate
Face your heart ache
You wish to make it unreal

[chorus]
