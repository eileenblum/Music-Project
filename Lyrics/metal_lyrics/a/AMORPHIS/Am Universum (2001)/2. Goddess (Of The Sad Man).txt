Astonishment when I bend over you creep
Put a noose around my neck
Which side I deside it's my time to reap
It's your side wicked and deaf

Take me to the place I can sleep
Wipe away all misery
Turn my path away
From the mind tearing tragedy
Consuming range of vision
I can see they decline
It's a stay of execution
I fly free tonight

[chorus:]
New moon laughs on it's own
Without compassion
I crawl through the realms unknown
And kneel to the goddess of the sad man

Inhale all mists from the shadows
And hide before the dawn
Face your mortal horror
You won't be reborn

Is he a proud man or just a fraud
Fooling himself with a losers talk
Punished to eternal vanity
It's thy destiny to cry for purity
You infidel slime
I grace insanity

Satisfy my agony
I know what my goddess needs
I bet there's something wrong
Inside my psycho creep
Fire burns within her eyes
Take me to the deadly ride
I remember how she was
When she choked on her own pride

[chorus]
