Go, look at the moon
And inspect the sun!
Now they are in the sky
Right in their old places

Hail, moon, for gleeming
Fair one for showing your face
Dear sun for dawning
And daylight for coming up!

Dear moon, you're out from the rock
Fair day from the cliff
You've risen as a golden cuckoo
As a silver dove
Up to where you used to live

Fare well now upon
Your way, upon your journey
Sweetly end your curve beautifully
Come at evening into joy!
