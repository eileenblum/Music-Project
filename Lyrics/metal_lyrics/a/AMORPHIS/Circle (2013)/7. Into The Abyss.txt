[Composition: Kallio, Santeri]
Â 
This long road
Paved with victories
These monuments
Named after heroes
On this spring-like night
When the trees are blooming
I languish upon this road
I perish on the icy path
Â 
Who are you
Why have you called me here
(And the wind steals the sound)
And this long road
Where are you leading me
(And the snow erases the tracks)
Â 
It leads the way
Tireless through the dusk
Forces me to carry on
Flowers witherâ¦ lights and stars go out
I blindly fall down
Into the abyss of sleep and death
Â 
Why Iâm the one
The chose oneâ¦ When Iâm no one
Â 
I strain to, to hear the call
But the wind steals the sound
I strive to, to keep on trail
And the snow erases the tracks
