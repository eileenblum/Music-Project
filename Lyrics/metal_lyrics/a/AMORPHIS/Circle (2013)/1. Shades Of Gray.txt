[Composition: Holopainen, Esa]

Mountain tops and red, red clouds
Aflame with flaring gold
Silhouetted against the eastern sky like a God
The trees now blue under the duskâ¦
The cooling flood of evening shade
The lights recede, the sounds subdue
Predators emerge from their caves

[Chorus:]
Grayness holds my mind at stake
And the lakeâs golden mirrorâs dim
The last rays fall into darker shade
The night coils around the day
Shadows turn the light into the shades of gray
The sun bades the world farewell

The queen of the night, her attire aglow
Before her beauty I, too bow
These nights I should fear
These lights I should not follow
This road to nowhere leads
I wander around in circles

[Chorus:]
Grayness holds my mind at stake
And the lakeâs golden mirrorâs dim
The last rays fall into darker shade
The night coils around the day
Shadows turn the light into the shades of gray
The sun bades the world farewell

The lights recede, the sounds subdue
Predators emerge from their caves

[Chorus:]
Grayness holds my mind at stake
And the lakeâs golden mirrorâs dim
The last rays fall into darker shade
The night coils around the day
Shadows turn the light into the shades of gray
The sun bades the world farewell
It controls my mind
And the lakeâs golden mirrorâs dim
The last rays fall into darker shade
The night chokes the day
Shadows turn the light into the shades of gray
The sun bades the world farewell
