[Composition: Kallio, Santeri]
Â 
A narrow path
Now overgrown
Covered by grass
Almost gone
Â 
It whispers an invitation to me
Unveils a new direction
Â 
Around me the forest sings
The sun gilds the road
Â 
Hereâs my place
This is my world
Hereâs my future
I make my fire here
Â 
The trail leads me to the sea
The stones feel so familiar
On this cliff Iâve been before
And heard the song of the waves
Â 
The path turns to a road
The river flows into the sea
Around me the forest sings
The sun gilds the road
