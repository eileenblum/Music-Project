[Composition: Koivusaari, Tomi]
Â 
Whispering of the trees
And nightbirdâs wistful song
My heart is growing still
The silent warriors arise
Â 
From beneath the shadows blue
From behind the shrouded veil
The ghosts step in front of me
The silent ones creep through me
Â 
They run beneath the stars
They rush on the road of night
They glide on the glass of time
They ride on a pale and frozen lake
Â 
Arise, the silent warriors arise
Arise, from the black soil
Arise, from the nightbirdâs song and screams
Â 
From the solar winds of my soul
From the moonlit matter of my bones
From shivering of my flesh
From leaden weights of my memory
Â 
The ghost of time are born
Step forth the immortals
Emerge the envoys of the depths
Silently the warriors arise
