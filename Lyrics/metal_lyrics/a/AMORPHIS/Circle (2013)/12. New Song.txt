[Japanese Bonus Track]In the light
Light of the fire
Blaze of my life flame
I watch the sunrise

I watch the moon
It's passing by
I watch the sparkling stars
Lights of the sky

Sing me a new song
Sing the ancient warriors' song
On this cliff
On the seashore
I am born again

Sing me a new song
(The ancient warriors' song)
Sing me a new song
(The ancient warriors' song)

I hear
The waves of time
I hear the questions
And answers of tide

I hear the voice
Voice of your soul
I listen to you
I reach for you

Sing me a new song
Sing the ancient warriors' song
On this cliff
On the seashore
I am born again

Sing me a new song
(The ancient warriors' song)
Sing me a new song
(The ancient warriors' song)

Ride

This is the shared moment
Of the living and the dead
Of all ages and times
Ages and times

Rise

The sun rises
The moon rides
The stars sown
Across the sky
