[Bonus Track]I was invited
Upon this shore
Where the past
Meets the future

So it found me
So it reached my mind
Helped me find the way
That leads to right place

I heard the call
I knew the form
It reached my mind
On this timeless shore
I heard the call
I knew the form
I ran no more
From what I can't escape

This is our moment
This is the past
This is our moment
This is our future

I heard the call
I knew the form
It reached my mind
On this timeless shore
I heard the call
I knew the form
I ran no more
From what I can't escape

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)

I heard the call
I knew the form
It reached my mind
On this timeless shore
I heard the call
I knew the form
I ran no more
From what I can't escape
