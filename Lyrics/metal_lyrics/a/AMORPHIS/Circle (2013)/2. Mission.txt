[Composition: Holopainen, Esa]
Â 
Up high in the north
At the end of my rocky road
I heard the call
My feet had betrayed me
I was carried forth
to a place of healing
Where I was made again
and they sang me my song
While they told me all the tales
Then they showed me my mission
and I heard it whisper my name
Â 
They took me to their side
and gave me back my life
Blew the sounds into my ears
and lit the light on my path
Â
