[Bonus Track][Music &amp; lyrics are by Kallio, Santeri]

On opening my eyesâ¦
The world dark as my soulâ¦
Nothing moves, nothing flows
A dream of a dead man

The moss of thoughts fill my mouthâ¦
Lichen grows on my bonesâ¦ Vertebrae detachâ¦
Teeth lost in the grit

The night has swallowed my nameâ¦
Taken my time, taken my place
The dusk has covered my traceâ¦
The rain has washed my memories away

I have disappearedâ¦
I am no moreâ¦ Turned into voice of storm
The roaring song of spaceâ¦
Behold the wavesâ¦ They roll over themselves
Behold the wavesâ¦ There lies the lap of time
