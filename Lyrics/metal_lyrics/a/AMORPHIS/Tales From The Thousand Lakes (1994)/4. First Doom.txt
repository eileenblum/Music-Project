The mountains of North
Shall erupt and flames
Of darkland will raise
Hail to one who hails
Blood for one who bleeds

O you mistress of northland
Queen of darkland
I may wash my hands of the
Evil master's blood

For that is no man's doom
Which I bring
That is child's doom
And it shall be the First doom
