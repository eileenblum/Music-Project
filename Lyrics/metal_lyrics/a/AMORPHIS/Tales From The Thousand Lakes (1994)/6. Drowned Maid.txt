I went to wash at the shore
I went to bathe in the sea
And there I, a hen, was lost

I, a bird
Untimely died
Let not my brother
Ever in this world
Water his war-horse
Upon the seashore!

Waters of the sea
So much blood of mine
Fishes of the sea
So much flesh of mine

Such the death of the young maid
End of the fair little hen
