I can hear your yearnings
your anguished cries
let the nourishment pass you by
as it leaves you without
without a trace
it leaves you without the scars

it's a day of the ruins
the time of your relief
it's a day of the judgements
the day of your beliefs

bitter is the end
the end of your cry
let your nourishment pass you by
it'll leave you without
without your faith
it'll leave you without your grace

it's a day of the ruins
the time of your relief
it's a day of the judgements
the day of your beliefs
