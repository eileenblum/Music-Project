There's no existing misery
that just fades away
faint hearted mindless tracks
through the wicked world
the world of today

and all the people
wait too long
makes them hate too much
foolishness fills this empty space
misgiving all the fortune
misgiving all the luck

stay clear of the killing goodness
the greed of the dying gods
can't you feel the raging darkness
the eyes stare at your heart

I see you dancing with the doomed
backwards to the womb
the spiral of life comes to the end
darkness will descend
it will descend

and all the people
wait too long
makes them hate too much
foolishness fills this empty space
misgiving all the fortune
misgiving all the luck

and all the people
wait too long
makes them hate too much
foolishness fills this empty space
misgiving all the fortune
misgiving all the luck
