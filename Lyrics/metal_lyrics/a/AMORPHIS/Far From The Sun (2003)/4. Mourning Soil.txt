Feel the ground
the mourning soil
close your eyes and lay

confront the passage of time
eternity which you cannot betray

barter away this haziness
down to earth this sparkling distress
thereafter you calling me hallowed

barter away this haziness
down to earth this sparkling distress
thereafter you calling me hallowed

sadness eclipsed
passing your heart
calling out the shadows from the dark

you still believe
that your life was empty
and now all that has gone

barter away this haziness
down to earth this sparkling distress
thereafter you calling me hallowed

barter away this haziness
down to earth this sparkling distress
thereafter you calling me hallowed

down to earth this sparkling distress
down to earth this sparkling distress
