Kiss the devil's mark
like a self-denial without temptation
she suffers from shame
prodigious perversions
it's her final dimension

feel affection for her longings
lamentation for no reason why
deep mistrust over matter
seduce it's will to melt away

she's plagued with pain
making me insane
passionate repulsion
kiss the evil inside
that you cannot deny
smiling at your sufferings

feel affection for her longings
lamentation for no reason why
deep mistrust over matter
seduce its will to melt away
