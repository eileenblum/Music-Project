[Kingston Wall cover]

I must be out of my mind as I hear you call
My name is even though I can't see you anywhere

Surely this feeling must be coming from something
Someone gave me yesterday as I searched for you

And I hear you call
I hear you call my name
But when I turn around
There's nothing to be found

I must be dreaming a dream of a lunatic
My fingers taste like some strawberry ice-cream

I hear you call my name but I don't think it's
The same I heard you whisper in my ear
