[Hawkwind cover]

In the darkness I will shine, cast no shadows, not define
I walk on water, float on air, there's no other to compare
I have this fascination, no cause for deviation
It's called levitation

There's no cause to start and scream, nor rub your eyes,
This is no dream

Although I sit upon this chair, I rise and float up in the air
I have this fascination, no cause for deviation
It's called levitation
Magnetic force, repel-attract, once it starts, there's no turning back
I offer you this chance to learn, take it now there's no return
