Where are the Warriors
Rested by my trunk
To sharpen their blades
Why didn't they stay on this dark land filled by fray
I see them come and go
Listen to all of you
Who felt my breath of death
Why didn't they stay and becoming a part of it

On stormy, bare hill I found my grave
In the darkest jour, my only voices are rattling chains
Brothers in arms, finalize for what I die
No enemy of us should claim this pass to our land !

So mighty our woods
So powerful the trees
Growing on our soil
Why don't we stay on this dark land filled by fray
I die for defending
My homeland and my roots
It's our greatest gift
Why don't we stay and becoming a part of it

My branches are long
My roots are strong
Standing here for a while to guard our land
Not knowing fear of the pungent wind
Raise your weapons high
Glowing in the sky
To defend the claim, our fathers laid
To protect the miracle of our hills
Raise your weapons high
Glowing in the sky!
