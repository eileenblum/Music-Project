Oh, they are coming
In silence they seem passing
The portal to our ancestors

No look behind in sorrow
In honour they are leaving
Knowing, I will follow

So silent are their movements
With pale faces of void
But well-known touch of closeness

Paralyzed by the appearance I stand
Even the smell of death is real
No scream wakes me up from this nightmare

No more quest of time, hour zero
The court is open, certain the sentence

Tonight my destiny will rise from the shadows
Of my doubts
Dead faces point my way
I will follow as they say
Passing the Portal

Follow the child with the cross
Follow the priest and the funeral march

Look in the eyes of your past
Tasting the smell of decay
