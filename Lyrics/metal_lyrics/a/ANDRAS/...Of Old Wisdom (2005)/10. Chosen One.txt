Long ago, the purity of your blood - so clear and unharmed
Renewed my hope for your weak and diseased kind
It's not the death nor the journey that I've came
That makes my hand feels stone cold
Oh no - it's the pain of my past I carry for lives

Want you hear me now, my warning voice
I am the chosen one
To fill your mind with truth and brighten your heart
I am the chosen one

Now that I'm gone, my breath will never return to your halls of despair
To fail again seems to be my destiny and the curse of mortals
