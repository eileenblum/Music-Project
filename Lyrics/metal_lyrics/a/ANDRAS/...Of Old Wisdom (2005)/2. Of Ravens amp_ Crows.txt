Three ravens in the haze of black night
Heralds of a darker force
Surrounding by clouds of fate
Announcers of ruin and death

Other side a grey and black crow
Sentence to death by hearing
The screams from a world beyond
The croak from the depths of the wood

I'm the reincarnated shadow
Of the man I used to be
Riding through me former homeland
In endeavour to set my spirit free
