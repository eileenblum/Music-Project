They came from a dark horizon
In the year of the holy war
Bearing swords of blood lust
Unbelieving fools!

Die on the pillory!

We are no mighty warriors
But we fight with sacred words
Our lord cover this hills

Die on the pillory!

You can't hope we forsake this castle
Built on strong beliefs
My cross and cup are witness

Die on the pillory!

Faster and faster you fight
But till now I stand
Soon will be my hour
In union with god

Die on the pillory!

Already the bridge is taken
You beasts will fear my cross
In flames your flesh will burn

Die on the pillory!

Betray of my saviour
I retreat to last edge
My cross as last friend

Die on the pillory!

Never give up faith
Never sway
With my cross I die
In one last fly

Flying in deepest gorge
As times stands still
Flying on divine wings
My final wish
