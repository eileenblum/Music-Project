The sjy was clear and calm the night
No clouds hide the stars and no wind roams the trees
When a black stripe appear
High in the sky, terrifyinf and in casket like style
Splitting into two, with hands and spike uncounted and wild
Two riders apper and behind them the armed forces follow

We're the armies of the world, from hell and heaven gates
Fighting for the control over human race
Fighting for your souls
We're marching this endless path since the beginning of time

We are the figures making our moves on the chessboard of life

Painless, ready for the final attack, our blades are strong and sharp
Blood red, the sky turning into a mass grave, no mercy, no prisoners

We're the armies of the world, from hell and heaven gates
Fighting for the control over human race
With swords of divine hate and spikes of hellish rage
Playing our game in this timeless cage
