Lay aside your wearying load
Gathered in dark acreages, far from native land
Close your eyes and suspire
Hear the well-known voices of your brotherhood

By the sight of the hilltops
By the mighty maple trees
In the shadow of the mountain chains
We stand, our blades glare in the sky

Not a twig has lost its charm
Nor reveal its magic since I disappeared
Standing here among these rocks, smell the versant meadows
Truly, I'm home

On my way I counted every day went by
Coming nearer to the hills of my birth
Moving faster as my heart calls to return
Leading me to where I started before
