The haze above the forests
The crest beyond the dale
Carved in stone by aeons

Pale and mighty glow the mountains
Across a sleeping world
Guarding over endless
Chains of blackened crowns

The wheel of fate has bound us to these valleys
Across those highlands I will walk
The tidal wave will never reach our landscape
Across those highlands I will walk

Saddle the horse and sharpen the blades
The boundaries of conspired pacts
Must stand against the hordes
Drenched in blood, in grimly rage we judge
The scum in front of our walls
Must fall one by one
