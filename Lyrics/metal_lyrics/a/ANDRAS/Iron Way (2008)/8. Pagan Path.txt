Your path through this woods will lead you to your grave
Spare my soul, we take your sins and bring you guidance
We known our way, the path of our fathers
Sons of god, proclaim your gracious salvation

Through the cold days of ice, while the storm wind whips
The only thing that warms, is the fire made by us.
No god will fir you up, when you shatter on a rock
But the herb behind the stone that cut scars in your bones.

Take your cross and spill your blood to step closer to him.
If we meet again as you say, we may see who has sinned.

Fall astray into an empty space
No Savior and no divine redemption

Desperate cry, fade away in the distance
Leave all behind, your signs of immortality
The wind roams the trees, while flames light up the hill
Silence prevail and soon the pagan path appear
