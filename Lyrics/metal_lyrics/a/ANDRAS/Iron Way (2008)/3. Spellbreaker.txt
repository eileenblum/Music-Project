Staring with bleak eyes
Behind a pale white face
The cape of sin has bent down their backs

Begged in life and serve in death
Below a wooden cross
Betrayed by the almighty Sign of Christ

When turret clock comes near midnight
The church bell calls for their servants
Among the sad gaze of the dead
Damned to see them all again

Right in the middle
Of this well known crowd
I feel the weakness in every heart

Nearly saying these creatures
Get what they deserve
I recognized we finally must burn
Down the spell of lies and greed
Crush the church and hang these goatfucking Priests

Free the sons and raise
The daughters of our soil
To claim what is ours
