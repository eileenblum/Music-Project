With a last croaking gasp, I came to you in darkest hour
Weak limbs, nearly dead, my misty way seemed endless to me

An anguished path in dark bohemian woods
Hope to escape the Miasma track

Hear my words, don't retreat, while others fall I've got salvation
Through the banned mile I crept, hunted by eyes, I surely know too well

My wounded bones haven't failed till now
Against the time that clasped my beloved
Sentenced to death by the fog of deceased
Like a merciless storm of hellish rage

By the life of mine, give me the dear serum
Blessed be thy name, in the coming days of our recovery

In the days of joy, when a cold wind will arise
To scour the land and blow the stench away
