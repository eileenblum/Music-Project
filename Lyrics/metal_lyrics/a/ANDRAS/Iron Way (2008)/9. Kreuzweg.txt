They cross the land from north to south, pass the
Lowfields and escape the marshes.
But on this forest their journey ends,
These hills will stay unbent.

Lay among faithful alliance,
Covered by an unseen hand
To ensure what has been ours since
The day the forests breathe

This path will force you down,
Inevitable, as uncounted times before
You fight, hack, bleed, crawling through
The dust, in the shadow of the wall
