From a dawn in real world to a sunset in the mid
Like the darken reason - depraved. weak. blind
But the age of old wisdom will reconquer the throne
By the force of our bloodrage

We are the new bringers of shattering deletion
Hear the challenge. this is war!
Harrow minded basterds
But the final payment starts

Beyond the gates of mystic reigns
Above a solitary field of crosses
We catch a glimpse of old born light
Through the eye of the seer

IÂ´m laying down. Haunting by a shivered dream of loss
Above my head opens up the blazing darkened sky
But I know too well that whis will not ever taking back
The painful lies surrounding me till the final breach of mine
The gift of foreseeing poisoned every rising wish of hope
