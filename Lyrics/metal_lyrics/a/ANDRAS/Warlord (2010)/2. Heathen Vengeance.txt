Hall a bloodline from our great fathers of the heathen alliance
To the brothers in arms who stand faithful side by side till now

Fight. torn canting perfidy
To renew our true heritage
We must march - Heathen vengeance is rising

Countless aeons of purity awake an unbending pride
For soil and for honor we raise the banners
against the scum of Christian weakness
