IÂ´m looking back while the ocean weeps a song
of the wild and everlasting waves on distant shores
What if this ineffable wind will fade and all the glorious lands
IÂ´ve seen eclipse right now

When solid rocks are melting
The oceans boil and unshaken trees combust
No more denial of the omens
When even bells and crosses burst this time

Behind a calm and wide open land
A wall of flames and blackest thunder rise from the dusty ground
What if this mighty tale ends here this day and within the final hour no savior appears

When solid rocks are melting
The oceans boil and unshaken trees combust
No mor denial of the omens
When even bells and crosses burst this time - so letÂ´s raise the flag of decline
