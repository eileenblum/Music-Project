Refracted is the silence
When the dark gate is open
And the souls escape from hell
The reek of death and sulphur
Ascend out of the dark
The crys of sacrifice
From the open gate of hell

When the seal and the fire break down
When the forest hold one's tongue
Posses the death and the obtain

Fear in her eyes
When the death comes near
he will steal your soul
Down to pain go away
The quest of deliverance
Is immedialety deceased
