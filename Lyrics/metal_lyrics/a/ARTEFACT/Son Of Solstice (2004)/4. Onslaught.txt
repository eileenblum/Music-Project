Black ships on fire, haunting the sea
Definding their homes, against the wind
Battalions of fear, resisting the onslaught
Retriving the faith, in deep agony
Our minds are lying my friend, we'll never survive
The nearer death is, the more the ship dives
In this resurrection, we tried to resist
So never forget, and rest in peace.
