Fire, end of disease
The gloomy shadows are now released
And in the twilight I fear my sight
But I am mad, and yes, I like kingdom of monsters, chapel of ghouls
Devastating the land, delirium of pure destruction, I am deep insane
My eyes are full of blood, soon it will be my hands
Kingdom of monsters, chapel of ghouls, my pleasure !
I am back, more evil than before
I am cruel, my heart is down the floor
Don't ask me why, I tell no lie
I am the son of solstice.
