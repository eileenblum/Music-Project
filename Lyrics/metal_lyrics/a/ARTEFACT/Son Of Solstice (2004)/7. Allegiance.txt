Spit in a graveyard, after having lived hell
Live at the mercy of an evil gloomy spell

Possessed by an overactive force
Guided through a hole of perversion
Misunderstanding the reasons for this hate
But loving, suffering and demanding ever more

Power from the owner of supremacy
The god of fear is knowing your needs
All the passions you'll have to forget
To become the toy he will get

[Solo guitare]

Your mind is empty and your words have now left
Unable to express like in death

To kill your envy, to possess your soul
Demonic order / shattering road
Let you fall deeper in this sweet kind of hell
Never a come back that soon you can tell
