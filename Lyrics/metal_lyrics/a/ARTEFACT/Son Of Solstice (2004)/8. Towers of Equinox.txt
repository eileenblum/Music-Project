To a all setherials, the weaker ones
To shatter and kill and make the world fall in the dark
Call me insane, make me starve, but you can't make me fight for your 
evil desire
Satanic weak souls, not even stronger than anyone else's intentions
Falling from grace and what else ?
Stronger ones will never follow you
Warriors of the cosmic light, shadows who will keep on fight
Defending your throne, and preaching, singing your croon

To a all setherials, the weaker ones
To shatter and kill and make the world fall in the dark
Call me insane, make me starve, but you can't make me fight for your 
fucking stupid goals
With your culture, your knowledge, how can you believe such a calamity ?
Disintegrate, erase, torture, we can't build a world founding our faith 
on this stuff
Dismembering, the order could be the solution
Prince of darkness should help us find a solution
But poetries and utopias are not made to be realized
Could we believe something
All is neverending.
