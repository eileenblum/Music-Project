What if everything you know is just a made-up truth?
Every word written in history are part of a big black lie
We are not made from Adamâs rib; thereâs no biblical God
No more descendants from the ape, might be something else

[PRE-CHORUS:]
Premeditated cradle
And so,
We are
Descendants from the stars

[CHORUS:]
Years of investigation canât find the words to explain why we are so special
What is the Human Race?
Designed in laboratories light years away from here
Imperfect masterpiece of alien architects

So selfish to say that weâre alone in the space immensity
Weâre just an insignificant dot into the infinity
Part of a bigger chain of life, massive master plan
Maybe we are not a coincidence
And someone else put the seed on Earth

[PRE-CHORUS:]
Premeditated cradle
And so,
We are
Descendants from the stars

[CHORUS:]
Years of investigation canât find the words to explain why we are so special
What is the Human Race?
Designed in laboratories light years away from here
Imperfect masterpiece of alien architects

Maybe wrong foundations of modern science
The missing link is right before our eyes

[CHORUS:]
Years of investigation canât find the words to explain why we are so special
What is the Human Race?
Designed in laboratories light years away from here
Imperfect masterpiece of alien architects
