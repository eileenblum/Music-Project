Conspiracy. Large corporations dominate the lie
What we can't see, are indeed
(The) Revolutionary thoughts for a better life

Cut the band that blinds our eyes
(And) Realize there's something else

Truth hurts. It is more comfortable to remain in ignorance
Just believe what you see, what you read, never question what it means

The yellow road is covered with blood, brick by brick it disappears
Building up the untruth, more and more, distorting evidence

Free the knowledge, break the walls of this crystal cell
Fall into the rabbit hole - catch the hidden evolution
Let the secrets be revealed, the truth must be told
Fall into the rabbit hole - catch the hidden evolution

Hypocrisy. It seems to be more profitable blocking up the progress
As we can read, history was written in detriment of the human race

Turn off your TV, think for yourself, freedom is at your fingertips

Truth hurts. It is so easy way out to escape from ignorance
Don't believe what you see, what you read, and always question what it means

The yellow road is covered with blood, brick by brick it disappears
Building up the untruth, more and more, distorting evidence

Free the knowledge, break the walls of this crystal cell
Fall into the rabbit hole - catch the hidden evolution
Let the secrets be revealed, the truth must be told
Fall into the rabbit hole - catch the hidden evolution

[Solo: Izquierdo, Izquierdo, Ãlvarez]

Reality. Close down the unbreakable tower of lies
The more you think, the more you see, unmask the real face under the veil

Cut the band that blinds our eyes
(And) Realize there's something else

Truth hurts. It is so easy way out to escape from ignorance
Don't believe what you see, what you read, and always question what it means

The yellow road is covered with blood, brick by brick it disappears
Building up the untruth, more and more, distorting evidence

Free the knowledge, break the walls of this crystal cell
Fall into the rabbit hole - catch the hidden evolution
Let the secrets be revealed, the truth must be told
Fall into the rabbit hole - catch the hidden evolution
