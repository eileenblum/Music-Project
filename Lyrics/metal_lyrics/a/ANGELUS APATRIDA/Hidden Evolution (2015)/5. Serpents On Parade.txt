They speak in the parliament with venomous words
Infecting the future we fought for
Poisoned weapons, their tongues cheat the world
Assuring the wealth to the poor

Serpents on parade
Smash the serpents on parade

Using religion to scare the masses
Increasing the ashes in the tombs
They give us promises when everything's lost
Engaging our own self destruction

Serpents on parade
Smash the serpents on parade

The rays of hope like light they fall into the black hole
While they dictate a brand new law
Proof of the power they hold
The highest bidder buys the peace with dirty money fees
It's time for us to take the throne
Reaching liberty

Serpents on parade
Smash the serpents on parade
Serpents on parade
Smash the serpents on parade

I can't believe the cynicism with that they tease
The population feed the beast
By voting every fucking time
That is their legal trick

No!
The same old story that's been told
Is getting bigger ever more

No!
We shall construct a better world
Free of these evil overlords

Serpents on parade
Smash the serpents on parade
Serpents on parade
Smash the serpents on parade
