A call to arms, it's time for braves to rise, long awaited sacrifice
Peacemakers walking through the sand, you better run

In the name of freedom we march into the infested land
Purifying every single path, nowhere to hide

Fire. Obey. Kill. Obey
Fire. Kill. Bloodlust. Deployment of power
Terror. Genocide. Democracy be my guide

My M16 is ready for the fight, hesitating with desire
It's so exciting point at real lives, time for the hunt

There's no remorse, no fear, no doubt, god is by my side
I pull the trigger, I close my eyes. First blood

I will give my life for this flag
Fight for freedom til my last breath
As if dust in strong wind I disappear
Remember to be proud of me

Formation! - Captain cried back to us
Five bodies laying on the ground. No signs of life

Smell of blood and powder fills the air, I taste my cold sweat
Wide eyes looking at my first preys. Dominate

Fire. Obey. Kill. Obey
Fire. Kill. Bloodlust. Deployment of power
Terror. Genocide. Democracy be my guide

I will give my life for this flag
Fight for freedom til my last breath
As if dust in strong wind I disappear
Remember to be proud of me

Dark eradication plans
The truth of human soul is behind the light
A war will never be the way

As the gavel of justice falls
Striking against the sounding block
First world of terror

[Solo: Ãlvarez]

I will give my life for this flag
Fight for freedom til my last breath
As if dust in strong wind I disappear
Remember to be proud of me
