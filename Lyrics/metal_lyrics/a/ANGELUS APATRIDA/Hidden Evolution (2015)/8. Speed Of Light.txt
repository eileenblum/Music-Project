I don't care what you have now to say, you sing the same old song
I've been around since you were just a kid, when nobody gave a fuck

It's so hilarious when I look at you walking in line like clones
Where is the attitude? Where is the scene? Where is all that preach? Uh?

I remember when all of this began, the fire in our hearts
Learning hardly how to pick the tone, there were no easy shortcuts

All those sparks still shining bright, they keep us alive
Take this lesson: The faster you climb, the harder you will fall

Ohhhhhhhhhh... Reaching the speed of light
Ohhhhhhhhhh... Taking away what you forgot to hide
Ohhhhhhhhhh... Reaching the speed of light
Ohhhhhhhhhh... It doesn't matter who you are
That's more than music, this is my life

[Solo: Amott]

Such a huge important difference between you and me
It's so easy to think before you speak, something I already did

Talking, talking, but you're doing nothing! Say what you want
You need a dose of humility straight into the vein

Ohhhhhhhhhh... Reaching the speed of light
Ohhhhhhhhhh... Taking away what you forgot to hide
Ohhhhhhhhhh... Reaching the speed of light
Ohhhhhhhhhh... It doesn't matter who you are
That's more than music, this is my life

[Solo: both, Ãlvarez, Izquierdo]

You imply I am not worthy of this, of what I got
What we defend, what we believe in. You are messing it up

I ain't gonna tell you nothing else, you are a waste of time
Talking bullshit about what music is. Get the fuck outta here!

Ohhhhhhhhhh... Reaching the speed of light
Ohhhhhhhhhh... Taking away what you forgot to hide
Ohhhhhhhhhh... Reaching the speed of light
Ohhhhhhhhhh... It doesn't matter who you are
That's more than music, this is my life
