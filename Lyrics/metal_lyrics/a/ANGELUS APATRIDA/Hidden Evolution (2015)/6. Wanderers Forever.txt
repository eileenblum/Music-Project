We don't expect you understand this life
But that's the fuel that moves our engines
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
Never regretting of what we've left behind

Our passion is our backbone
What makes us stand in line
Hearts beating, spirits bleeding
We are made of flesh and bones

One direction, one straight path
That's how we live our lives
Waking up the fury we hold inside

Thousands of miles we walked
Rising after the falls
We are free, we're wild, we are in this together
We want it, and we need it
Flying high and running slow
We are wanderers forever

Living in the road so far away from home
Growing up one family all across the world
Raze everything to the ground in our way
Feeling as stronger as it was the first day

Our passion is our backbone
Our passion is our backbone
What makes us stand in line
Hearts beating, spirits bleeding
We are made of flesh and bones

One direction, one straight path
That's how we live our lives
Waking up the fury we hold inside

Thousands of miles we walked
Rising after the falls
We are free, we're wild, we are in this together
We want it, and we need it
Flying high and running slow
We are wanderers forever

[Solo: Ãlvarez, Izquierdo]

Thousands of miles we walked
Rising after the falls
We are free, we're wild, we are in this together
We want it, and we need it
Flying high and running slow
We are wanderers forever
