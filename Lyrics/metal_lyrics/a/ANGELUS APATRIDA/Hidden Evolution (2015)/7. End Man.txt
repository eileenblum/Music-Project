Your tongue is always moving in a whirlwind
Why don't you shut your mouth?
I never had a chance to protest
It's like my lips are stitched

My life's in constant persecution
All fingers point to me
I'd like to act in retribution
But something's stopping me

I'm alone
I clench my trembling fists so hard
My nails are bleeding against the palms

You probably never knew my name
And I can't forget yours
I'm just the man remaining down your rules
Your mandatory laws

Sometimes I wish I'd died instead of this
I can't stand anymore
Living in this world as someone's bitch
It burns deep in the core

I'm alone
I clench my trembling fists so hard
My nails are bleeding against the palms

Take the pill and just forget it all
I'm another grain of sand ashore
Carving on a stone a faceless name
Leave the memory 'cause I am the end man

Screaming with muted voice, withstanding through agony
Another haze, another shove, another kick, another blow
That's all your game, my bloody role. I'm the end man

[Solo: Izquierdo, Ãlvarez, Izquierdo, Ãlvarez]

Take the pill and just forget it all
I'm another grain of sand ashore
Carving on a stone a faceless name
Leave the memory 'cause I am the end man

I am the cannon fodder of this war
An expendable toy
Taking all your anger out on me
I serve you for your joy

Your brain is full of cryptic riddles
Tidal wave on insanity
An endless fight against yourself
Your worst enemy
