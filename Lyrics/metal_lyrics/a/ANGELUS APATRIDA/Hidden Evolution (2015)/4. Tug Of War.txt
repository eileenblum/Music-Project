I pull, you push, it's something wicked
Request, refused, an obscure menace
Who wins? Who loses? Who is forgotten?
No peace allowed, words are forbidden

Trying to bury me alive; I ain't dead yet
Like the devil's false compromise

I am the source, you're the curse
You rise, I fall. The root of evil
I bet, you choose, perfect gamble
I played your rules, judge and beholder

You nailed your fingers deep inside the wounds
Playing a dangerous tug of war

Something is killing this world
Running fast through its entrails
Let's burn what sets us apart because nothing lasts forever
Breaking our hearts made of stone, spitting words full of needles
Let's burn what sets us apart and never say never

First hunt, round two, clash of egos
You tread my rope, lack of reason
Like sharks on blood, dancing rhythmless
The well of hope, struggle prison

I nailed my fingers deep inside the wounds
Playing a dangerous tug of war

Something is killing this world
Running fast through its entrails
Let's burn what sets us apart because nothing lasts forever
Breaking our hearts made of stone, spitting words full of needles
Let's burn what sets us apart and never say never

[Solo: Ãlvarez, Izquierdo]

Tug of war rages on

You crawl, I roll, we feed each other
We've lost control, settled scores
What's hate? What's love? What's the difference?
Who's hunt? Who's the prey? How did this start?

The noise silence, it resounds inside my head
Like shattered glass against the wall

Something is killing this world
Running fast through its entrails
Let's burn what sets us apart because nothing lasts forever
Breaking our hearts made of stone, spitting words full of needles
Let's burn what sets us apart and never say never
