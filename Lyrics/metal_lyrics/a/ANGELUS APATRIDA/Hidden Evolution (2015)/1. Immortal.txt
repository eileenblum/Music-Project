They offered freedom to the new generations
While they nailed their mouths with spikes
Work hard to get rich is the craving of this nation
Mortgaging your life until you die.

Live for nothing, die for their others profit
Welcome to the welfare state, modern prison.

The big ones sharing pieces of the millionaire pie
Keeping the people on a leash
Bread and circuses for the suffocated masses
Even if there's nothing to eat.

Echoes from the past form the new world order
The shadow of the dictator remains immortal.

I'll cry out:
How glorious is this country seeding from the old dead tree
One tyrants goes, another comes to take the throne
How could someone be proud of living in this mediocrity?
The king is dead. Long live the king!

Feudal laws turned democracy in to a police state
Sing the funeral song for the freedom of speech
Be careful what you opine, what you write or say
Welcome to the land of the free.

Crackdown, repression, intimidation
Crashing the protester with bloody violence.

I'll cry out:
How glorious is this country seeding from the old dead tree
One tyrant goes, another comes to take the throne
How could someone be proud of living in this mediocrity?
The king is dead. Long live the king!

[Solo: Ãlvarez, Izquierdo]

Old fashioned premise for god and country
Sentencing liberty to death
Becoming popular reactionary habits
Xenophobia standing on the edge.

Echoes from the past form the new world order
The shadow of the dictator remains immortal.

I'll cry out:
How glorious is this country seeding from the old dead tree
One tyrant goes, another comes to take the throne
How could someone be proud of living in this mediocrity?
The king is dead. Long live the king!
