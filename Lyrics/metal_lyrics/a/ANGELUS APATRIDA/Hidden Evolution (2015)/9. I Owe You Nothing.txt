I've tried by all means to calm your thirst for blood
I'm so tired. This stupid struggle has gone too far
On and on you treated me like a homeless dog
You pulled so hard to see what's at the end of the rope

I own you nothing! Don't waste my time
Talking to you is like walking on a minefield

I served my head up on a plate of gold
Wasting nights, sleepless hours, but who's fault?
I was at my wit's end, stifling, dancing like a hanged man
No one to untie me from my sins

I own you nothing! Don't waste my time
Talking to you is like walking on a minefield
I hear you crawling, I've got nothing to lose
Desperation turned my hopes to rust

All that I lost, all tears I dropped won't be in vain
When you'll be dead
All the words I swore, all the salt you spit into my sores
Turn back to freedom

For years I put my confidence in you
I never thought your treachery would be so cruel
Saint and sinner, bleeder, acting like a marionette
No one to free me from your strings

I own you nothing! Don't waste my time
Talking to you is like walking on a minefield
I hear you crawling, I've got nothing to lose
Desperation turned my hopes to rust

All that I lost, all tears I dropped won't be in vain
When you'll be dead
All the words I swore, all the salt you spit into my sores
Turn back to freedom

[Solo: Izquierdo, both, Ãlvarez]

I own you nothing! Don't waste my time
But you owe me every minute that I spent on you
Saint and sinner, bleeder, acting like a marionette
Someone to free me from your strings

I own you nothing! Don't waste my time
Talking to you is like walking on a minefield
I hear you crawling, I've got nothing to lose
Desperation turned my hopes to rust

All that I lost, all tears I dropped won't be in vain
When you'll be dead
All the words I swore, all the salt you spit into my sores
Turn back to freedom
