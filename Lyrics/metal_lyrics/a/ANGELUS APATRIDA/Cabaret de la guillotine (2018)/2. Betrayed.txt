You were the chosen one
Left your will in darkness
The sacred seal is shattered into pieces
Like a crystal in my eye
Your word is forsaken
My heart betrayed by my own brother

Arrogance...Compassion...Mistaken...
Venomous...Confusion...Hatred

Black! Lights out! Screaming shadows
Fire! Burn down! Footbridge to the abyss
You were my brother!

A cold blade swung above my head as I was watching over you
The wheel of faith is in perpetual motion
Your eyes gave you away, I let myself be fooled by you
Your treachery will last forever

As I saw your life decline your view of passion
Blinded by your thirst of power
Vanity came to its demise
Flawless destruction
A face with empty eyes

Black! Lights out! Screaming shadows
Fire! Burn down! Footbridge to the abyss
You were my brother!

A cold blade swung above my head as I was watching over you
The wheel of faith is in perpetual motion
Your eyes gave you away, I let myself be fooled by you
Your treachery will last forever

The wheel of faith is in perpetual motion
Your eyes gave you away, I let myself be fooled by you
Your treachery will last forever

A cold blade swung above my head as I was watching over you
The wheel of faith is in perpetual motion
Your eyes gave you away, I let myself be fooled by you
Your treachery will last forever
