In the beginning God set a plan to rule the Earth with an iron fist
Burning skies above a sea of blood

And God said:
Let there be darkness,
Let the light die under the veil
Let there be a vault between the fires, bound eternally

Fateful toll of the false bell, indoctrinate

And God said:
Let the fires teem with evil creatures, cruel spawns
Let us make man in our image, in our likeness, to serve as slaves

Greatness, made of bone and flesh. Reverence

Don't pray. Don't adore. No words can save your soul
The way to salvation: Destroy the ministry of God
No fear. No qualm. No words will change what's done
The way to redemption: Eradicate the ministry of God.

And God said:
I condemn you to breed and increase in number.
I deprive you of your will, victims of the faith, subject of the dread

Sightless. Fear and death for sale. Cutthroat

Don't pray. Don't adore. No words can save your soul
The way to salvation: Destroy the ministry of God
No fear. No qualm. No words will change what's done
The way to redemption: Eliminate the ministry of God.

[Solo: Davish G. Alvarez]

Liars, industry of hate. Ruthless.

Don't pray. Don't adore. No words can save your soul
The way to salvation: Destroy the ministry of God
No fear. No qualm. No words will change what's done
The way to redemption: Eliminate the ministry of God.
