Life is hard to understand
When the fortune plays its game
The good guys leave, the bad ones stay
I watch your eyes fading away
And your voice whispers my name
One last time to hold your hand

Calm down and sleep, calm down and sleep
Break free from reality
The bond became so special
It will never disappear

One last effort pushes the will
and draws a smile on your face
Overcoming all the strain
Even fighting to find the way
To make it through another day
Through the darkness, through the pain

Calm down and sleep, calm down and sleep
Break free from reality
The bond became so special
It will never disappear

We all got dues in life to pay
But it wasn't your time yet
Until we meet again farewell, my friend

Nothing lasts forever, it's a fact of life
But no mother should have to bury a son
An eternal memory will shine through
But no father should have to mourn the loss

[Solo: Davish G. Alvarez]

Calm down and sleep, calm down and sleep
Break free from reality
The bond became so special
It will never disappear

We all got dues in life to pay
But it wasn't your time yet
Until we meet again farewell, my friend.
