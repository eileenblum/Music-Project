Silence, indifference, guilty as charged
Becoming one, justice and wrath
Bloodshed, how ignorance begets more violence
Part of the crime, sentenced to death
Life or grave chosen in haste
Between the wolf and its prey
Don't move a finger, God forbid!
Sadness and corruption, abuse of power
The land you claim belongs to no one
Fairness, zero tolerance with the intolerant
Protected by the welfare state
Flan-waving, false patriots behold the downfall of the nation
Reserve a first class seat for the electric chair
Your contribution to improve the human race

[Solo: Davish G. Alvarez]

Fascism and nacism march unpunished
False patriots behold the downfall of the nation
Traitors!
