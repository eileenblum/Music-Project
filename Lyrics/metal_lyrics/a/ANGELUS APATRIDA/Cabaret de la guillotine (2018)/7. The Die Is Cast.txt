Let me admire the beauty of death
To drown in the swirl of madness
Let me embrace you with my misery
Though I'll spread my ego first
I will silence your heart beat
Fall into the eternal sleep

Join me in this feast of pain
You will never feel alone again
The mark will shine forever
Serve the entrails with champagne
A hundred times more addictive than cocaine
Line the magic on a silver plate

I want you dead, I need your blood
To satisfy all my inner frays
We've got no choice,let it be done
For all the mortals the die is cast

Let me absolve each of your sins
Just the end will set us free
let the storm melt into fearless waves
Let me shelter you with bliss
No more guilts inside your afflicted head
Let the chaos find its peace

Join us in the feast of pain
Death is just a symptom of having lived
The spell will last forever
Leave the endless walk of shame
Hell is empty. And all the demons are here
Feel the plague infect your fluids.

I want you dead. I need your blood
To satisfy all my inner frays
We've got no choice,let it be done
For all the mortals the die is cast

Let me carve your life of scarse
As the snake devours its prey
No sickened skin to wash
Let me open up your mind
The blind will lead the blind
Let the shepherd guide your destiny

Join me in this feast of pain
You will never feeel alone again
The mark will shine forever
Serve the entrails with champagne
A hundred times more addictive than cocaine
Line the magic on a silver plate

I want you dead, I need your blood
To satisfy all my inner frays
We've got no choice, let it be done
For all the mortals the die is cast

I want you dead, I need your blood
To satisfy all my inner frays
We've got no choice, let it be done
For all the mortals the die is cast
