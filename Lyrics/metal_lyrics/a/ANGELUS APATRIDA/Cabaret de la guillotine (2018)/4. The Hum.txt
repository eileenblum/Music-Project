Like a song from purgatory
Endless frightening vibe
Sing a melody for the twisted ones
Growling silently this useless burden
Ready to burn
Feel adrift like a wingless eagle

The hum...the watch...it's true... a secret to disclose

[Solo: Davish G. Alvarez]

Mind control, straight ahead into the precipice of haze
Drive to the unknown, a safe path through the darkest of your psyche
Disciple of the void
Like a ghost in the cemetery
Roams across the scum
Hidden facts evidentiary
Pulling firmly the strings of madness
Behind the scene
The devil's in the details

The hum...the watch...it's true...a secret to disclose

[Solo: Davish G. Alvarez]

Mind control, straight ahead into the precipice of haze
Drive to the unknown, a safe path through the darkest of your psyche
Disciple of the void
No answers, trapped souls screaming into nothingness
Falling endlessly into a dreary hole
Damnation. Wrapped by the black arms of the unknown
The sense of freedom is suffocating

[Solo: Davish G. Alvarez]

Like a ravenous parasite
Living off the host
Dementia is taking over
You can't hide, can't run from this gust neverending maze
Surrender to insanity

The hum...the watch...it's true...a secret to disclosure

[Solo: Davish G. Alvarez]

Mind control, straight ahead into the precipice of haze
Drive to the unknown, a safe path through the darkest of your psyche
Disciple of the void
