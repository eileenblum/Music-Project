You never knew the truth but, we're all already dead
When the song of revolution turns into a mere sketch
The fight against the big corporations is nothing more than a sea of sand
Tolerated persecutions by the workers themselves

Back to old Chicago
Martyrs
Light among the shadows
Justice
A forceful struggle
Get back, get back to old Chicago

We are the threat of the nation, we re the fueled fire
We are the feared free ones, convicted for life
The needed spark that will light the wick of dignity
Together we are invincible, divided we fall

Back to old Chicago
Martyrs
Light among the shadows
Justice
A forceful struggle
Get back, get back to old Chicago

I saw my brothers fall from grace, I can't remain impassive
Find your bravery deep inside, let's fight, it's now or never

Dry your tears,you poor slaves, rise, encourage yourselves
Overthrowing the thievery system, make the world a better place
There is still a burning flame inside our hearts we must obey
Let's shout out loud and clear now
Long live the first of may!

Back to old Chicago
Martyrs
Light among the shadows
Justice
A forceful struggle
Get back, get back to old Chicago

Si vis pacem...Parabellum!

It's not too late to realize
Keep breathing, above the sands of time
Do something for your children to be proud
'Cause all you do in life will trace your future

I saw my brothers fall from grace, I can't remain impassive
Find your bravery deep inside, let's fight, it's now or never
