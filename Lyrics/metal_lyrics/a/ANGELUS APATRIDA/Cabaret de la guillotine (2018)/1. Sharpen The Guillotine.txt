It's time to decide whether we stand or run
The darkest ages are back
A dirty sketch of a Machiavellian plan
Poisoned innocent blood

Ain't just part of the conspiracy
Global hunt of freedom of speech
Destroying individual liberty
Praise the master

Welcome home
Back to the cave of the wolves
Sell your soul
And you'll be lost in oblivion

No remorse
Just do what has to be done
Let the black star fall
Now on with the show!
Sharpen the Guillotine

People's fed up of being told to stay
Comfortable in its cage
Covering the squares with justice in red
Give 'em what they deserve

Build the wall that splits humanity
Blood for blood is what they want you to spill
They made you believe you are the enemy
Feed the monster

Welcome home
Back to the cave of the wolves
Sell your soul
And you'll be lost in oblivion

No remorse
Just do what has to be done
Let the black star fall
Now on with the show!
Sharpen the Guillotine

Let's do this...Let's do this...Let's do this...

Rolling heads celebrating democracy
Five endless seconds to regret
Hails to the executioner, fists in the air
Power to the people

Ain't just part of the conspiracy
Global hunt of freedom of speech
Destroying individual liberty
Praise the master

Welcome home
Back to the cave of the wolves
Sell your soul
And you'll be lost in oblivion

No remorse
Just do what has to be done
Let the black star fall
Now on with the show!
Sharpen the Guillotine
