Life's passing through my eyes, wanna catch each breath
Satan's servant calls me again, the room smells like sulfur

I am the plagues of hell, the fetid bloody marsh
I am the sepulchral triumph, the laughter of a death

This is the end of the calm before the storm
Races against time into the night

I don't deserve this life enchaine to this bed
I want to die I will return, it's time to make'em pay

My son, don't be afraid, you will have revenge
Come with me to the other heaven, my lord awaits your presence

This is the end of the calm before the storm
Races against time into the night

[Solo: Guillermo Izquierdo]
[Solo: David G. Ãlvarez]

There's no reason to waste a minute in this world
They will have no tomorrow, then I will rest in peace

Well done I'll take you there take my hand and fly
Leave this corpse in the morgue, you won't need it again

This is the end of the calm before the storm
Races against time into the night
From hell you're coming alive like fire spawn
Face what they've done yo you, beat 'em to death
