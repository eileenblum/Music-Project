Theres someone asking for your name
i saw it painted in the wall with blood
There are shadows dancing on your way
They're waiting for a test of servitude

Go alone, they want you and you want em
Cross the gate, respond their call

Theres no compassion in your eyes
You've felt the morbid taste of hate
Theres something more to understand
A trial by fire will be your command


Go alone, they want you and you want em
Cross the gate, respond their call
And don't look back, they trust you blindly

ROOM 237 - Face what you really are
ROOM 237 - not just a room, your real life

There are more devout ones to attract
By your darkest hand of domination
There is another life for you
I promise (you) born again, your resurrection

Go alone, they want you and you want em
Cross the gate, respond their call
And don't look back, they trust you blindly

ROOM 237 - Face what you really are
ROOM 237 - not just a room, your real life
