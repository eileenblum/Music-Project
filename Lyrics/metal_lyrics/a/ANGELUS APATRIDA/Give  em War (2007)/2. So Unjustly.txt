This rare infection devouring your entrails
you think there is nothing to do
neither medication nor surgical intervention
The pain that you feel is unbearable

And now i clench my fists for your life
Betrayed! you cant die so unjustly

I remember the first time my eyes saw yours
And a kiss closed our lips for a while
My legs were shaking, my body heartbeating
We said our love would be forever...

Sealed our souls with the blink of an eye
Broken in silence cause yours gonna fly

And now i clench my fists for your life
Betrayed! you cant die so unjustly

Redemption - Please God show mercy
Deception - Nothing will be the same

Mother i love you, Father i'll miss you
My brothers i need to embrace
So please remember my face with one smile
I promise i'll see you again

But now i clench my fists for your life
Betrayed! you cant die so unjustly
