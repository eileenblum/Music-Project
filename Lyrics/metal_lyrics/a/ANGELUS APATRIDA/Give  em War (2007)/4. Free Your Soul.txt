Now is the time to decide what you're doing with your life.
You no longer like sex and drugs but always were you guide.

Spread a cancer in your memory.
Free your soul,blanck your mind. Emptiness / Satisfied.

You'll never be the same again.
Erase your life, trip to your calls, muted one.

God is always by your side and he never leaves his lambs,
come with us and let him by the shepard of your thoughts.

Spread a cancer in your memory.
Free your soul,blanck your mind. Emptiness / Satisfied.

You'll never be the same again.
Erase your life, trip to your calls, muted one.

And now you're part of this neighbourhood.
A walking dead, a consciousness mad.

Reaching the point of no return.

There is a place where you will bring.
The peaces that you've always wanted to reach.
And you will find your last wish,
with million of voices crying you.

DON'T FORGET YOUR NAME, YOUR FACE, NO!
