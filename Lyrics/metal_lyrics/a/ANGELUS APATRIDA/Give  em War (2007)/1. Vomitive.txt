I really hate hypocritical people
cynical, liars, advantaged ones
Those who kill women and mistreat their children
The partners who commit adultery

You know i have a thousand whys
Thats why i hate you and all of your kind
Get the hell out from my face
Your presence makes me feel...VOMITIVE!

Sometimes i wish to be an ostrich
So i could hide my head from all like you
Something done wrong then acting innocently
Now remain consistent of what you've done

Thats what you get for treating me like a fool

i will tell you a real story happened not so far from here
its about the best neighbour he was a old man...

Beat my wife up  cause i love her and i touch my daughters too
But i go to the church everyday my soul is cleaned for sure

PIG YOU MUST BE KILLED!

welcome to the real world of shit
its frightful take a look around
now i ask myself it god really exists
Then he must be the worst of them
