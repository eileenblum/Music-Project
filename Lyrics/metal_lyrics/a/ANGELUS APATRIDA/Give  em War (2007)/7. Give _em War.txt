Sixty years of endless battle, days of bloody war
Secrets labs of investigation creating like a god

More glycerin and morphine in old pipes. Needle biopsy
A new machine is now created. Terrifying indeed

Go and give em war! True bloody war!

Human mind, human nature, human intelligence
Hunts like a beast all it needs see them bleed
A new concept of fear

Slow no mercy, has no pain, killing is in its brain
Crushes their heads, cats the guts breaks their necks
Flow as gasoline

No! i will not sleep! no! Till all disappear!
