is this some kind of dirty name?
I bet everything I had but I've never liked to gamble
is this the highest card? is this the end?
I said I wanted a break from my routine

but it's hard to keep my mind on a plane so different from a spiral
the way we were
what things should be
and all our thoughts buried so deep
so different from reality

so far from this world, so lost, where are my lenient thoughts?
alone in this room just me with my insanity
so close to my oath, I'll be forever with your words
alone in this room just me with my insanity

I lost the concern within my soul
I seek it everyday but is hidden just away from me
the way we were, what things should be
and all our thoughts buried so deep
so different from reality

so far from this world, so lost, where are my lenient thoughts?
alone in this room just me with my insanity
so close to my oath, I'll be forever with your words
alone in this room just me with my insanity

[Solo: David G. Ãlvarez]

these walls are moving, the ghosts are haunting me again
I need to leave this place, I wanna escape... go!

[Solo: Guillermo Izquierdo]
[Solo: David G. Ãlvarez]

I want to end this torture I wanna be left behind
break this crystal prison rise my head and breathe new life
the way we were, what things should be
and all our thoughts buried so deep
so different from reality

so far from this world, so lost, where are
alone in this room just me with my insanity
