all I love is dead
promises are lies
all apologies
all of them are false

all I preach is -self-destruction
all I want is -not this world
all humanity -is lost
all my hate -to crush them all
when you cross the line there's no time to cry

I'm your frightening nights
the strange behind the wall
waiting for his prize
reflected in the knife

the cancer of -society
dictating rules -as it used to be
over your poor minds
I will cast a shadow
when you cross the line there's no time to cry

I live when you die, I lie when you swear
I breathe when you expire -don't apologize
I hate while you love, I rest when you run
I stay once again stronger than all

I'm the antagonist
of the human race
a bullet in your head
blood flowing with grace

fallen idols -in your walls
the greatest lie -ever told
all of you may die
when I snap my fingers
when you cross the line there's no time to cry

[Solo: David G. Ãlvarez]
[Solo: Guillermo Izquierdo]

I live when you die, I lie when you swear
I breathe when you expire -don't apologize
I hate while you love, I rest when you run
I stay once again (in front of you I'll stand) stronger than all
