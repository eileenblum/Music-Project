when your eyelids open up behind the fog
dead bodies everywhere
rotten guts
it's time for the executioners, hooded death
crawling sensations across your head

turn down the lights
don't look back
the evil rises again
bloodshot eyes in front of you
fear is your best friend

courtain moves from side to side
now, on with the show!
you're alone and nobody's there
let the devil take the hindmost

in this world of destruction anger reigns supreme
they want your blood you wanna scream
there is no place to run nothing but dead-end streets
it makes your hair stand on end

you've been caught, you're their first meal
the pain prevents you from the scream
flesh separating from its bones
smell your entrails while they slurp
and burn... motherfucker!

[Solo: Guillermo Izquierdo]
[Solo: David G. Ãlvarez]

die with no anesthesia pray for the end
you're gonna become one of them
it's time to hunt again now your first prey
serve yourself as you're starving to death

turn down the lights
don't look back
the evil rises again
bloodshot eyes in front of you
fear is your best friend

courtain moves from side to side
now, on with the show!
you're alone and nobody's there
let the devil take the hindmost
