what if you take a look to the sky in the middle of the night?
and a shining flash turns it into daylight

stop! your eyes leave their sockets behind
as you think you're going to die
can't move now you are a thunderstruck
it won't take reprisals

what if you are shivering with cold and suddenly terribly hot?
god's fingers makes way through the clouds

caught! the wrinkling skin of your hands
like ashes and dust start to fly
first blisters the whispers alive
cannot catch tomorrow

poor devils, for the good of others
whistling bombs will tear their lives apart
when blast off to genocide
forced to be part of their plans
with shattered tears in your eyes
whistling bombs will tear their lives apart
when blast off to genocide

what if each piece of land you used to know is simply crushed?
like a head explodes against a windscreen

burnt! the nuclear fire arrives
destroying with the speed of light
it's here in the blink of an eye
mass extermination

poor devils praying low, they cannot stop the holocaust
the science of aggression
intelligence of evil minds

[Solo: David G. Ãlvarez]

they know how to kill, how to spread the fear, make you scream
even if you think you're safe they hunt you like an animal

[Solo: Guillermo Izquierdo]

what if each piece of land you used to know is simply crushed?
like a head explodes against a windscreen

burnt! the nuclear fire arrives
destroying with the speed of light
it's here in the blink of an eye
mass extermination

poor devils, for the good of others
whistling bombs will tear their lives apart
when blast off to genocide
forced to be part of their plans
with shattered tears in your eyes
whistling bombs will tear their lives apart
when blast off to genocide
