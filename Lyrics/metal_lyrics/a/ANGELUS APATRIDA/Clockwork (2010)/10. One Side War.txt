they say that in war there are two sides
some call them good and evil, some call it clash of prides
allies or oppressors not so different things
there is only one side that decides to fight the world

a dark concept makes
innocent screams
bad intentions
we can't see, inner benefits

another lesson learned this day, cover your own ass
leaders play safe in their dispatches with tin soldiers
one step to reach the end

freedom's like a big chessboard
who will fall and who will stand
money, crude oil, holy land
what's the excuse this time?

war to end all wars
places to do their penance
one side one war
one world to roam

can you see what I see?
there's no good planted seed
rooted evil is what they bring, inner conflicts

another lesson learned this day, cover your own ass
leaders play safe in their dispatches with tin soldiers
one step to reach the end

freedom's like a big chessboard
who will fall and who will stand
money, crude oil, holy land
what's the excuse this time?

war to end all wars
places to do their penance
one side one war
one world to roam... fuck you all!
