here I am I come back for you
not one for far too long see me that's the truth
did you miss me? is you mind erased?
maybe you don't remember my face

smell these rotten scars
blood oozed from these wounds
refresh your memory bastard
still no idea?

I've promised myself rise again
stupid dumbshit have you ever crapped your pants?
I would like to remind you of these words
the end of the calm before the storm

I know what's happened here
now you're kind... you are dead!
I say I would have revenge
every action has a side effect

you're the one who started this game
the end will correct your mistakes
I've reserved a place in hell
I'll enjoy torturing you to death

[Solo: David G. Ãlvarez]
[Solo: Guillermo Izquierdo]

now I'm the rapist the killer and the thief
who can shake the foundations of the earth
the force of the sea which sinks a million ships
lament of a kid, the hidden creed

the monster in a closet
first and primal scream
the menace of vanity
desires for death

I'm who penetrates the pussy of a nun
eye of the storm, putrid flesh feeds the worms
eternal punishment scourge of human kind
I'm the angel's ruin the king of kings

I know what's happened here
now you're kind... you are dead!
I said I would have revenge
every action has a side effect

motherfucker! I feel no remorse
you will rest six feet below
