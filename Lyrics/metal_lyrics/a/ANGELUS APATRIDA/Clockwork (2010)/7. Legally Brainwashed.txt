watching you day by day in the news headlines and tv shows
has been bothering me for a long time man
cruel pig, slave of the faith, christian renegade
all this shit increases my thirst for vengeance once again

you make me retch flying into a rage I'm not a violent man 'till I see your face
and your acolytes, stink that comes from deep inside
like your rotten doctrine against the masses against the free thought
more and more the shadows come to inject us with venomous words

brainwashing mankind
indoctrinate the slaves
a legal sect was built to destroy our reason

[Solo: David G. Ãlvarez]
[Solo: Guillermo Izquierdo]

this is the word of god
we praise you lord
so practise what you preach
evil lives inside your hearts, people die and you just laugh!

all of them fallen in combat glory and honor for the victorious
other's whereabouts are still unknown death's parade
pray for the precursors of the coup d'etat, curse the traitors
your masks fall you're the same sons of god who killed our past

brainwashing mankind
indoctrinate the slaves
a legal sect was built to destroy our reason

in my opinion you are wrong
let's get this straight, what's going on?
you hide the true intentions
behind a cassock behind the fog

exploit their fear in their empty minds
as you're abusing altar boys
my divine law says what to do
I will cut your cock off!
