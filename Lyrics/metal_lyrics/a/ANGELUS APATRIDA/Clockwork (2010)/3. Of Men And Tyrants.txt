saved by the bell as red hordes burn in hell
guilty of genocide, acquitted of testifying
false transition and political disgrace
inner wrath, boiling blood, a headshot for our peace

guest stars placed in electric chair
ride it proudly you son of a bitch

racist spirit, false supremacy
homophobic tendencies sings of the mentally insane
crushed the free men in the name of god
rise with rage the new empire, blast the other ones

thinker of the enlightened absolutism
wolf in sheep's clothing
piles of corpses are growing before my eyes
of men and tyrants, a cloak for their contempt

eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth
satisfied. it  makes me smile, the cat always hunts the mice
seeds of anger planted full of hate
chickens come home to roost, let them burn at the stake

[Solo: David G. Ãlvarez / Guillermo Izquierdo]

brutality, assassinate, despite it all
exterminate, eliminate, clean their lives
it's easy to understand god absolves us all
like a fireball from the sky devastating the land

confrontation, annihilation, desolation
firing squads wait by the wall for the chosen ones
five million people more to die for the nation's cause
atmosphere of dust and blood will embrace the throne

it's time to wake up, time to open your eyes
time to stand up and fight, deprive them all of seeing the light
give them a dose of their own medicine
victory is all we need, the battle is lost but this war we'll win

guest stars placed in electric chair
wolf in sheep's clothing
piles of corpses are growing before my eyes
of men and tyrants, a cloak for their contempt

tear apart the old chains of cruelty
of men and tyrants, shall exist till eternity
