first of all don't treat me like a fool
you talk behind my back, now say it to my face
you will never see me fall from grace

others like you have passed before my eyes
the same old speech and they know they live a lie
I don't like you and you've never liked me
so shut your mouth or I'll make you bleed

dogs like you must be on a leash
buried in the sands of time or hanging from a tree
it's the least you deserve you fucking piece of shit

others like you have passed before my eyes
the same old speech and they know they live a lie
I don't like you and you've never liked me
so shut your mouth and get down on your knees

are you ready to confront your fate
you know that this won't be the same again
you don't like me and I've never liked you
so shut your mouth or I'll do it for you

my satisfaction is seeing you tonight
my naked fists of pride bringing you fright
don't ask for mercy, don't cry like a bitch
lets finish it or get out of my way

[Solo: David G. Ãlvarez]
[Solo: Guillermo Izquierdo]

and immorality has no other sense for me
if you're a bastard I'm the hate you used to be
I'm your nightmare, you try to bleed

are you ready to confront your fate
you know that this won't be the same again
I don't like you and you've never liked me
so shut your mouth or I'll make you bleed

my satisfaction is seeing you tonight
my naked fists of pride bringing you fright
don't ask for mercy, don't cry like a bitch
lets finish it or get out of my way
