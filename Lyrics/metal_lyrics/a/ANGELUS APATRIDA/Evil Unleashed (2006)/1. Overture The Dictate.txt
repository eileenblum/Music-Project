[In this song there is no singing, only talking]

When I was a little boy
I thought human nature was good
Merciful, pacific and tolerant

Year by year, I realized that
We are abominable beings
Creators of the worst atrocities
Aids, cancer, war, hunger, pain and suffering... death

Only for a piece of land or some money
Life doesn't matter

We are our worst enemy...
Now, the evil has been unleashed...
