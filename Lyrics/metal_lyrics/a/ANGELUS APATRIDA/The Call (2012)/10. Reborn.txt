Like a phoenix back from death
Life's not so different since I fell
I see that everything wasn't wrong
I'm back again, nothing was lost

Breathing new life, embrance my fate
Look around and believe again

All I thought, all I swore
All that made retract my wings
I see that everything wasn't wrong
I'm back again, nothing was lost

Breathing new life, embrance my fate
Look around and believe again

Reborn, release from pain
I just see the light
Now I can dream again
Reborn, a new found faith
I just see my face smile
I will live again... Yeah!

Agony... I cannot feel
Weathered face filled with dry tears
There's no fear in my heart
I am reborn
There is always something to fight for
Echoes of another life ain't gonna cloud my mind
No... No... Never again!

It's time to fly up to the sky
Against the wind, rise on fire
I see that everything wasn't wrong
I'm back again, nothing was lost

Breathing new life, embrance my fate
Look around and believe again

Reborn, release from pain
I just see the light
Now I can dream again
Reborn, a new found faith
I just see my face smile
I will live again... Yeah!
