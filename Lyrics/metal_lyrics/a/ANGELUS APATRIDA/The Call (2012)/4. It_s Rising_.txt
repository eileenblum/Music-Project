From the top of the hill we can see the end
It has escaped, it has heard The Call
It knows no one is free from its eternal greed
Look at those terrible jaws, it's rising!

It's rising!

Nobody knows from where it comes
Neither when nor how
Hey! See the sky it's covered in black!
So the prophecy is done as it was told
Beware of its claws, it's rising!

It's rising!

They say that once
It was the master of this world
It comes to claim its throne as the chosen one
Silence of the damned
They know their time has come
Feast of the butcher hunting, men like lambs

Nobody knows from where it comes
Neither when nor how
It has escaped, it has heard The Call
So the prophecy is done as it was told
Beware of its claws, it's rising!

The stars have been aligned
The seal has been broken
Now it's out, now it's free
It has awakened from its slumber

Nobody knows from where it comes
Neither when nor how
It has escaped, it has heard the call
So the prophecy is done as it was told
Beware of its claws, it's rising!

It's rising!
