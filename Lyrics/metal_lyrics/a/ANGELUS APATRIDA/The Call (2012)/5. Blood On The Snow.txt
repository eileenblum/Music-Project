It's so sad to see there's nothing down the hall
As superficial stands to the sacred
Voiceless screaming, running aimlessly
Raise my hands to the sky look up and ask why

I am stuck in this strange world
With those word written in blood all around me
Perhaps they were true or just a simple sounding breath?
What once made me dream now becomes my endless pain

What I did wrong, don't you think it wasn't all bad?
Guilt spits on my soul remembering all my faults
I wish I could go back and take all I dropped
On the floor, on the white
It sinks like blood on the snow

What was it that led us to this awful place?
There was some truth in what I said, what I prayed
I know the words are gone with the wind
But weigh more in me, all that remains in the deep

I am enchained to the wheel of fate
It's endless spinning blows me away once again
Perhaps I had a chance to redeem myself
What once made me dream now becomes my endless pain

What I did wrong, don't you think it wasn't all bad?
Guilt spits on my soul remembering all my faults
I wish I could go back and take all I dropped
On the floor, on the white
It sinks like blood on the snow

No mercy for my soul

My pain, my grief, my guilt, my strength to keep me safe
My heart, my entrails, my faith, what still remains

No better times, no where to go
No place to hide the unforgivable
Obsessed with something banal
Beyond the contradiction

As anguish clouding my senses inside a time machine
Praying to delay the years and start over once again

I am stuck in this strange world
With those word written in blood all around me
Perhaps they were true or just a simple sounding breath?
What once made me dream now becomes my endless pain

What I did wrong, don't you think it wasn't all bad?
Guilt spits on my soul remembering all my faults
I wish I could go back and take all I dropped
On the floor, on the white
It sinks like blood on the snow

Snow! Blood on the snow!
No mercy for my soul!
