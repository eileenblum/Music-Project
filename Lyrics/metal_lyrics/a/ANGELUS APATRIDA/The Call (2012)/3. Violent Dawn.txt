What should you do when
word is no longer a valid weapon?
What should you do when
anguish clouds all your pacifism?
Now it's too late to show
your clean hands and good intentions
No tears, no cries
No peaceful methods, no demonstrations

Think it's time to take control
Time to squeeze their hopes
Bring the human nature to a violent dawn

What should you do when
politicans spit on your rights?
What should you do when
they send their dogs to bite your ass?
Pay them in kind
Don't let 'em hit you on the other cheek
Every action brings a reaction and consequence

Dignity, integrity, victory
In solitude, your fist will rise with force
Morality, ingenuity, stupidity
All these bastards
Are gonna get what they deserve

Fight!

What should you do when
you are shedding tears of hate?
What should you do when
the entrails explode in primary rage?
Police brutality goes
unpunished and well applauded
Hanging your rights
while they are dripping from bloody sticks

Think it's time to take control
Time to squeeze their hopes
Bring the human nature to a violent dawn
