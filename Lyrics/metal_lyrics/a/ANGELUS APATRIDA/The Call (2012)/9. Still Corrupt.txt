In the 21st century we drag the last of all plagues
Everyone dances to the sound of the money
Corruption remains the same
Same shit, different toilet. Same pig, different pigsty
Letâs fill their ballot boxes with shit
Now weâre more pissed off than ever

Down with their laws
The dark hand counts the votes
Falling rights, donât you ever ask why
Still corrupt! Time to end this scourge!
Budgets come and go for their own sake
thatâs all their business

For a long time I always thought
that someone would save us from disgrace
My confidence is gone as I see
they wanna see us fall from grace

Freedom is lost, at any cost we must fight for our rights
Salvation of this system is as broken as a shattered crystal

Down with their laws
The dark hand counts the votes
Falling rights, donât you ever ask why
Still corrupt! Time to end this scourge!
Budgets come and go for their own sake
thatâs all their business

We donât want to be part of this game, want to be free
and live in peace. We the people who rule, we choose our
leaders and decide who is worthy to govern.
But no one represents our concerns.
This is our manifest, we who cannot feed our families
and secure a future for our children.

Corruption in your city hall! Infection of our freedom!
