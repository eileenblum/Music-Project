Signs of death are showing me the way
I've been dreaming the same
I can't get it out of my mind
A dream about shadows devouring the light

The hope is gone far from these thoughts
A razor blade to walk through

The executor rides from afterlife
Balancing justice to tear apart
No tolls on this road of wrath
Everything burns in a sea of despair

The hope is gone far from these thoughts
A razor blade to walk through

I've seen the end of the world
Black tears of blood from above
Dead angels burning my soul
Fire horses rise from the hole

No innocence to save the path
Indiference brought chaos to mankind

I saw my hands burning
Running through the broken bones
Blood-splattered faces cry
Empty eyes, no signs of life

The hope is gone far from these thoughts
A razor blade to walk through

I've seen the end of the world
Black tears of blood from above
Dead angels burning my soul
Fire horses rise from the hole

No life, no hope

I fall into oblivion, scratch the wall of thorns
While losing all my wisdom
I realize what my life was

Souls dancing to discords
The carnival has begun
I can feel the cold steel of the scythe
With a strange sensation of welfare

The hope is gone far from these thoughts
A razor blade to walk through

I've seen the end of the world
Black tears of blood from above
Dead angels burning my soul
Fire horses rise from the hole
