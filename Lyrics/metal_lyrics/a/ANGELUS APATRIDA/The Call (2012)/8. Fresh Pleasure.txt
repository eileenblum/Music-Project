The time has come, there's no reason to wait
That's the reward for a shitty day
There is never enough, always want more
Hard to forget the cold taste of gold

Fresh pleasure! Refresh your throat!
Fresh pleasure! Ask for one more!

Drink like there is no tomorrow
Today is great! We're out of sorrow
Lift your mugs and make a toast for us
Music blows your head it's time to mosh

Watch out! You're spilling it all!
Reach out! Drink it up!

Feel how happiness increases
The pleasure of a good taste
Beat the heat certainly, your sweat is over!

It doesn't matter how it comes
Bottles, cans or barrels mugs
There is never enough, always want more
Hard to forget the cold taste of gold

Fresh pleasure! Refresh your throat!
Fresh pleasure! Ask for one more!

Feel how happiness increases
The pleasure of a good taste
Beat the heat certainly, your sweat is over!

Satisfaction, never deception
All it takes is your best intentions
Hurry to the bar let's make a try
The show is over but you're bone dry

WE WANT MORE! BEER FOR ALL!

The band is playing the last song
You don't want 'em to cut their tongues
Headbanging with this hymn
Take another beer, drink 'til the end

You know it's been a great concert
Only one thing to make it perfect
Listen to the sound, music is loud
Hanging in the pub time to thrash around

Fresh pleasure! Refresh your throat!
Fresh pleasure! Ask for one more!

Feel how happiness increases
The pleasure of a good taste
Beat the heat certainly, your sweat is over!
Now it's time to go back home
Music still in the hole
Awake the morning after, so let's start over!
