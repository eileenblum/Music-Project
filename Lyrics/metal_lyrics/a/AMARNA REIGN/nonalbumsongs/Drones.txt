I have no remorse
for the weak
who will fall
when I speak
while you're chasing your dreams
I'll defile your sleep

Down to the ground
while I'm still on my feet
know the last breath you take
will be gasps of defeat

Breathe deep
Inhale my words
you can't deny
all the screams you've heard

Breathe Deep
Inhale my words
You're just a pawn
You're just a drone
You are a fake
You are the face of death

Were their lives
not worth enough
Could you even
Look me in the eye

You claim to be a hero
a protector to the weak
but you're just as evil
A pointless death in silence

It's at your hand
you dwell in sadness
a tattered flag
that cries out for violence

The anti to a world
pursue a selfish dream
exploit a righteous hope
for ill intents unseen

You are the fear unseen

I have no remorse
No regrets for the blood I shed
I have no remorse for the dead

To ignore and stand silence
will advocate this wrath and violence
Words Unsaid
To bite your tongue
creating paths
for the blood to run
No one is innocent
