You bury me in hills of sand
Lie by lie, you took my hand
The promises you made to me
Now bury me as grains of sand

I'll rip the teeth from the beast
I'll cut the tongue from this deceiver's mouth
Break the grasp of false prophet's hold
Let you fall into your fear
Let you fall into your own doubt

There's no way down,
When you drug yourself to the bottom
There's no way down,
When you cast yourself as...

Deceiver, deceiver, deceiver, deceiver

If you were who you said you were,
Then you would already know this
You would be here now and
The things you had done would speak for themselves

If you were who you said you were,
You would already know this
You would be here now and
The things you had done would speak for themselves

Your blindfold is a mirror
You see nothing but yourself
To damn the ones that fight for you
Ignore their screams and cries for help

So welcome to the desert
This is the nightmare you've created
No way down,
When you've drug us down to the bottom
There's no way down,
When you cast yourself down in to the ground

If you were who you said you were,
Then you would already know this
You would be here now and
The things you had done would speak for themselves

So reach a hand and grab ahold
To lives you've shattered from lies you've told
So reach a hand and grab ahold
This is your last chance to now grab ahold
Reach a hand and grab ahold
So reach a hand and grab ahold
So reach a hand and grab ahold
