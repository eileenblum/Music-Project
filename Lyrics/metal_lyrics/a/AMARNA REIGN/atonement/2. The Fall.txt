So don't turn, look away
Every second is a lifetime
And I wait, and I wait

So don't turn away, (turn away, turn away)
Just don't be like those who have fallen
Their faults have paved the way and laid the bricks
On the path you walk on (path you walk on)

It's easier to breathe, to believe
When you're pulled out from the water
I'm asking you, and begging you
Now to breathe, to believe you can gasp out for air

[musical break]

Oh my god, it's crumbling beneath me
I can feel the pain in my throat rising
As it slips further away, I begin to let go
This world is fading, is this even real,
am I still breathing?

Say goodbye to all you ever knew
This life has passed you, has let you go
It washes over me, gives me this curse
This is your right of passage, now heed my words

So don't turn away
Just don't be like those who have fallen
Iâm asking you, and begging you
Now to breathe, to believe you can gasp out for air (gasp out for air)

Fighting for,
Every fleeting second, every dying moment
Reaching forth, into darkness,
Becoming one with the endless
Don't look away, don't fall away,
The night has fallen

For now, my pain becomes anger
I create a path for destruction
The end is near, I can feel it breathing

This ends tonight
I die in vain
