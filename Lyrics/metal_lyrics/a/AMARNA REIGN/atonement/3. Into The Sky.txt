Wrap your hands around my throat
I want to know through suffocation
If this life is real, If I'm still breathing
I'm falling into the sky

Lights are passing, thoughts are fading
I hear a voice, it calls for me,
It beckons to me from beyond
"Go home, go home, return, return,
for they must see the truth"
"Go home, go home, return, return,
for they must see the truth"
"Go home, go home, return, return,
for they must see the truth"

Wrap your hands around my, throat
I want to know through suffocation
If I can still breathe through my lungs
I heard a voice from a heavenly father
As he warned,
"Go home, they're not done with you.
Return, they need to see the truth"
I want to know through suffocation
If I've truly slipped away

How long have I been dead?
How long have I not been breathing?
How long have I been dead?
How long have I been bleeding?

Never would I think that this could happen to me
Cast into blackness, as such an ominous tone
Crawling through hallways,
As every doorway is closed, to everything I know

All I can see is the light, as it calls for me
It beckons too me from beyond
"Go home, they're not done with you return
return, so come and see the truth"
"Go home, they're not done with you return
return, YOU need to see the truth"

Strike me, where I stand,
I'm the shadow of a broken man
I'm calling out to you
But you can't hear my voice (can't hear my voice)

[musical break]

So wrap your arms around me
I want to feel the life that I once had
But when I'm in your presence,
I feel the loss that no man has.
So just wrap your arms around me
So wrap your arms around me
So wrap your arms around me
