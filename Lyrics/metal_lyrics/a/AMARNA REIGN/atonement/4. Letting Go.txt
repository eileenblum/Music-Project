This world to me means nothing
I'm a shadow, you're transparent
I traveled here unseen
I will not forget your face when I return

Casting a curse on the world
from the hate I created
my tongue begins to scald
my presence will test our fate

becoming so unknown
I found out you're the reason that I dwell
I will reap what you sew
I will not return until you feel what I felt

Searching, for these answers
these memories bind me
and I can't seem to let them go

Your face, is a reminder
of the time that I was able to breathe
I have never been a fighter but Iâll fight this
I'll fight this until I am free

Searching, for these answers
these memories bind me
and I can't seem to let them go
I'd be better off just to let it go,
act like it never happened
but I can't seem to let it go

Wipe the blood from your fucking face and fight!!!!
