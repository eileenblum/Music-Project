I Write This Down For The Record
I Write This Down
To Maybe Ease Your Suffering
The Storm Has Brought In The Black Tide
I Keep On Running With Nowhere To Hide
I Load The Film On The Reels
(this Is My Darkness)
I Know I Won't Want To See
(my Separation)
But I Sit There Frozen
As It Passes In Front Of Me
I Close My Eyes With Hope They'll Open
Through The Stars In The Sky We'll Still See Each Other
As One Passes By They All Pass By
Let Go, Of The Controls
Let This Plane Crash Down
I'll Make This Plane Crash Down
The Clouds Are Rising
The Stars Are Falling
It All Spirals Down
I Can Feel The Glass Shattering
This Is The End
This Is The End
This Is The Fucking End
I Close My Eyes With Hope They'll Open
I'm In Disguise This Face Is Broken
Let Go, Of The Controls
Let This Plane Crash Down
I'll Make This Plane Crash Dwon
I'll End This Horror For The Rest Of Us
I Told Myself I'd Take This To The Grave
I Write This Down For The Record
I Write This Down
To Maybe Ease Your Suffering
The Storm Has Brought In The Black Tide
I Keep On Running With Nowhere To Hide
