This Is Where I Stand
Our Paths Have Crossed
This Time You've Crossed The Line
Our Paths Have Crossed
This Time You've Crossed The Line
Where Words Have Failed
I've Done All I Can
Now Time Will Tell
This Is Where I Stand

I Could't Turn Around, I Thought I'd Never Walk Away
And Even Thought It Hurts I Know Its Time To Change
A Clean Slate, Emptying
Out Your Space, A New Thing

Moving On, I Know Its Time For Understanding
And For Us To Make A Truce
But, In Lacking Compassion
Its Hard For Me To Forgive You
I Always Knew You Were A Coward, Coward
I Always Knew You Were Afraid, Afraid

I Can Feel The Coward
The Child Inside
I Can See He's Scared
I Can Feel The Coward
The Child Inside
You're Running Scared

Run Away.

I Could't Turn Around, I Thought I'd Never Walk Away
And Even Thought It Hurts I Know Its Time To Change
A Clean Slate, Emptying
Out Your Space, A New Thing

This Is Where I Stand
Run Away
