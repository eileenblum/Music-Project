It Starts With One Step, Will You Take It Or Leave It?
Only One Step, And You Will Walk Away From The Truth
A Foot Print In The Sand And I Already Have My Answer To This
You Have Walked Away From The Truth
I Can See The Water Rising Higher
You Fill With Fear As You Take In Your Last Breath
This Time Its Up To You
Its In Your Hands
Sink Or Swim
Live Or Die
With Your Last Breath You Will Decide
It Starts With One Step, Will You Take It Or Leave It?
Only One Step, And You Will Walk Away From The Truth
A Foot Print In The Sand And I Already Have My Answer To This
You Have Walked Away From The Truth
And Now This Has Caught Up To You
(and Now This Has Caught Up To You)
And Now There's Nowhere To Run
(and Now There's Nowhere To Run)
A Blank Stare A Blank Page
A Shadow Rests Upon Your Face
Nowhere To Run Will You
Sink Or Swim
Live Or Die
This Time Its Up To You
Its In Your Hands
Our Future Rests In Your Hands
It Starts With One Step, Will You Take It Or Leave It?
Only One Step, And You Will Walk Away From The Truth
A Foot Print In The Sand And I Already Have My Answer To This
You Have Walked Away From The Truth
Sink Or Swim
Live Or Die
