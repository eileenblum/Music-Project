Forever Has Become Three Years
Eternity Has Faded
All The Love I Had I Lost In Tears
This Life Has Suffocated
And Now I'm Done With You
Forget My Name
A Hatred I Never Knew
Runs Through My Veins
This Darkness Has Become My Strength
Sleeping Alone Tonight
(this Room Is Dark And Silent)
Light Cannot Pass Through These Windows
(consumed By Shadows)
Sleeping Alone Tonight
You Will Fade Away
Paralyzed By Horror
Strangled Out By Fear
As I Break Away
Regret Is All I Hear
Sleeping Alone Tonight
(this Room Is Dark And Silent)
Light Cannot Pass Through These Windows
(consumed By Shadows)
Sleeping Alone Tonight
You Will Fade Away
Forever Has Become Three Years
Eternity Has Faded
All The Love I Had I Lost In Tears
This Life Has Suffocated
