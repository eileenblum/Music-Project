We are the rejects
We are the downfall
We are the consequence of a line
We never should have crossed

Humanity has never seen such wrath
But we deserve it all the same
You think there's hope for mercy
Well it's too late

The line has been blurred
There is no life or death
Resurrected to breathing
From the dust return
Take in our curse

The earth has marked our heads to purge
To rid itself of this filth

There is no hope for mercy

We are the fallout
The mistakes
The disease
A breed that spreads like cancer
Scars the earth and rapes the sea

If I could I would end it myself
Forfeit my life soon after yours
No other chance of escaping the horror
Our chapter is closed
There's no hope in saving the dead

You're already Dead

I will see you
On the other side

You Are dead.
