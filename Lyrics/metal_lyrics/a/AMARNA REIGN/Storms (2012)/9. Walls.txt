We are the faceless, the hopeless, our lives are unguided 
There's no fulfillment 
Fall to resistance.

Why deny yourself from existence.
Defined by your limits exalted by witness. 
Run from your fear in the distance.
Whatever helps you sleep at night

Ask yourself what's the difference 
Your living in fear just to exist 
Or dying for truth and forget that you lived
Ask yourself what's the difference
Ask yourself what's the difference 

Just close your eyes 
You'll never know if your alive 
Just close your eyes 
You won't make it out this time

We'll feel so lost behind the walls that hold us in 
Trapped by illusions that we can't break the things we know
Shattering the glass finding reflections in shadows
I'll find my way out of this, find my way out of here

Your only worth the sacrifices that you make 
You let the others take the fall at the front line
I don't know how you can sleep at night knowing goddamn well
You never even put up a fight

You let the others fight your battles
Just standing by while they lose your war
Blame(ing) on the world you dont try to change
And your the rot from the corpse of our own

Close your eyes 
You'll never know if your alive 
Close your eyes 
You wont make it out this time 

We'll feel so lost behind the walls that hold us in 
Trapped by illusions that we can't break the things we know
Shattering the glass finding reflections in shadows
I'll find my way out of this, find my way out of here
