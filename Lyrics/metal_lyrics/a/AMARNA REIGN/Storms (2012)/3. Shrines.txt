You must, you must have it all
You must have it all figured out
It's a picture perfect vision of a life
It's what we've been taught to dream about

Looking down on us with condescending eyes
They say what you think
They say what you mean

Claimed a throne
Adorned a crown
It's not what you want
It's not what you think
Take this life you had and throw it away
Like everyone else

You're just a victim
Distorted vision
Defined by corruption
You'll just consume yourself

Empirical lies
Untested untried
Forsaken are those
Who don't question life
Wandering a such a trap like path
Allowing yourself to worship this shrine of gold
To worship a shrine of gold

You'll never find a way to overcome this un-fulfillment
A golden home that leads to an empty grave
A mislead life you don't try and save
You'll drown yourself in discontentment
You gave away your only choice
Sold your soul, all for this shrine of gold

You brought this upon yourself
We all have our choice
You let them take yours
You're nothing more than your crutch
Pathetic for knowing
But still giving up

A mislead life you don't try and save
You'll drown yourself in discontentment
You gave away your only choice
You sold your soul, all for this shrine of gold

So come a bit closer
The secrets a lie
The lie is your life
So leave it untold
Maybe you'll find the truth and throw it away
Like everyone else
Thrown away
Forgotten forsaken
Thrown away
Just like everyone else
Your treading is turning to drowning
Fall beneath, fall beneath me

Every gasp you take, you'll forever choke
Grab hold to nothing
You can only tread water for so long.
