Like Pulling strings on a marionette
Vines that stretch a centuries time
Infinite faults by corrosions
Carving through, Defining life

Sand to stone
Coal to diamond
Inverting mountains
Cascading lies

What if gods could bleed

We are all lost
In perception
Becoming content,
Denied

Shapes are changing
And conforming
To live a portraits life

I'll leave the stars in the sea
Throw the sky to my feet
Make the dreams make believe
It's all I've ever allowed myself to see

This is manifestation of unkown regrets

You're worth no more
Than than the finite world you perceive

The same false hope,
Your worst claims to be.
