I fill myself with such
Utter disregard
Abandon all the things i held
Things we claim to
Make us who we are

None of this ever seems to be enough
To cover up
A united fact of tragedy
That's woven in our blood
From our birth
We begin to die
Tormented to find a reason
Why

Reflect these words now in our mind
To find a sole point to define
The purpose for this life
Such simple words do not exist
No single purpose in which to live

The color in this life is fading
The reality of being has lost it's grasp on me

Nothing in this life has a place
If it cannot come to
A final place to
Rest

I can't peace with all this suffering
That lies before me
I can't let go 
When all it ever meant is still alive
In front of me.
