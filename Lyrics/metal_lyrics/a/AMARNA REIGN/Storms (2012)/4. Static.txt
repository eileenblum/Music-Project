I'll shut the world out
And lock myself in
Try and save myself from
All the problems that only lie within
I'm unchanged
By the sounds of my walls caving in
The silence never shattered
The problems stay within

I can't stand this reflection
This image must leave a false impression
The fear is in the mirror
And the mirror is the fear in me

How could it be the ones that try and stay the same
Keep safe from every change
Are not enlightened 
Resist the world
Shutting out the sun
You're the source of strife
You're the fault in everyone

You should just give up give up give up
You've become deaf to your surroundings
You need to wake up wake up wake up
You are blind to understanding

You've chained your hands to the barricades
But the war you wage with fear
Is a battle fought inside

Grab your guns
The wars upon us
They're clawing at the gates
For a debt that's paid in blood

I'll shut the world out and lock myself in
Try and save myself from
All the problems that only lie within
I'm unchanged
By the sounds of my walls caving in
The silence never shattered
The problems stay within

Held in place by a rusted anchor
You'll drown at sea in a tempest of storms
Just a sinking ship that denies any rescue
You forgot what you were fighting for

I'll shut the world out and lock myself in
Try and save myself from
All the problems that only lie within
I'm unchanged
By the sounds of my walls caving in
The silence never shattered
The problems stay within

They'll never take me alive
I'd rather die, than be taken alive.
