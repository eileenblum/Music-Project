I feel like I'm fighting for a world I no longer believe in.
I've lost all hope and faith in everything i thought regarded a true sense of worth
The meaning of being.
You can blame no one but yourself, know it doesn't change a thing.

Everyday is worse than the one before it.
You can't ignore the changes in the sky.

Look to the sky as it falls around us.
Look to the sky, look to the sky
As it falls around us.
Too late to be a lesson learned.
Look to the sky, look to the sky
As it all comes down around us.
Too late to be a lesson learned.

Think of this while you're swept away.
Drowning in the waves of regret.
You should have made a change.
You should have made a change.

Too late to be a lesson learned,
As it all comes down around us.
As it falls around us.

Look to the sky as it falls around us.
Look to the sky, look to the sky
As it falls around us.
Too late to be a lesson learned.
Look to the sky, look to the sky
As it all comes down around us.
Too late to be a lesson learned.

Think of this while you're swept away.
You should have made a change.

This is a warning that life unravels in your hands.
I speak of looming wrath decided through your sacrifice.
You must give everything to save yourself in dire times.

If there ever was a time to kill, the time is now, the time is now.
So why aren't you killing yourself?
