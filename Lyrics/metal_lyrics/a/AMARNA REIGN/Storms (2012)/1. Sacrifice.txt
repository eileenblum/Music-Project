For this I live
I give up everything
For this I die
Sacrifice everything
For this I live
I give up everything
For this I die
Sacrifice everything

As long as I have breath
I'll never rest
I'll never tire
Settling is not an option
Sacrifice is all i know
I control myself
Make my choices
And bare with the consequence
I leave nothing to fate
The strength in me comes from within

I don't care, you can try and break me down
The struggle makes me stronger
The scars will make me proud

A darker day is fast approaching
The world you know will crumble to ashes
You will be judged, you will be reckoned
The world you know will crumble to ashes

For this I live
I give up everything
For this I die
Sacrifice everything
For this I live
I give up everything
For this I die
Sacrifice everything

I know where I stand
I'll watch the others fall
Drug through life by fear
I'll have no mercy
No mercy for you all.
