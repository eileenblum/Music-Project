We are not who we say we are
We are not who we claim to be
These are masks that we hide behind
A mask that hides the face beneath

The fear has come in shadows
Of looming circumstance
We'll barricade these walls with spikes
In vein it has advanced

Black crashes into white
Gray lines now drawn in front of me
It makes it hard to see
Makes it hard to believe

Only See what we already know
Only know what we felt to be

These walls will never
Serve as shelter
Only barriers to light

We are not who we say we are
We are not who we claim to be
These are masks that we hide behind
A mask that hides the face beneath

Wars are fought
In light of perspective
Blood is shed to keep the locks on our door
Our biggest fears
Are inches from our faces
Our world will unravel
We're just one knot away
This world will unravel

We dress ourselves
In such elaborate masks
To try and keep shape
To faces we have drawn

This world will unravel.
