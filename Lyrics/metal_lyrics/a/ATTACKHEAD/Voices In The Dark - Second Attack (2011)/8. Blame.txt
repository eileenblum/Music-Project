Cant live in this world anymore
Fingers point at you. You settle the score
They can do no wrong, so they say
Corporate lies and greed is their way
Destroy all that's real. They don't care
Fight for what is right, if you dare.

Who's to blame
All the same
Who's to blame
What a game

Send our boys to die, ego trip
His own private war. Never quit
People have no say. Wasted words
No democracy, how absurd
Not too late for us to fight back
It is still our right. That's a fact

Big house on the hill doing fine
Who will pay the bill? You and I
Limos, private planes. All first class
Nothing but the best pompous ass
Elected as our voice got him in
We made the wrong choice. No one wins
