Evil life, full of sin, there's a demon within
No remorse, no regret and the date is set
In the chair, we flip the switch and we watch him twitch
Bulging eyes, the smell of flesh, may God bless

Rebirth
He's unearthed
It's Satan's curse
Rebirth

Underground he rots away with slow decay
Signs of life from the dead. He's alive again
He roams the night. Human prey. It's Satan's way
Rips your flesh and tears your skin as the devil grins

Feel his stare from the night. He's watching you
Feel his breath on your neck there's nothing you can do
you try to run. You try to hide but you will die
He sinks his teeth deep in your throat and sucks you dry
