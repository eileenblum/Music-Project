Sadistic butcher, years of pain, tyrannical reign
We live in fear. Afraid to speak, he keeps us weak
We scrounge for food out on the streets
We have to eat
He rapes our women. He kills is our men.
We cant "wim"

We are possessed
Trying to live our lives
We are possessed
You must hear our cries
Possessed, hear our cries

Frontpage news every night. See our plight
Day to day its clear to see we must be free
The war begins with the flashing lights of the surgical strike
Our homes destroyed as the troops deploy
Now we feel annoyed

Hostilities end. Shock and owe as the troops withdraw
We're free at last/ A life long dream or so it seems
Months go by now he is back on the attack
All is lost. There's no escape. We accept our fate
