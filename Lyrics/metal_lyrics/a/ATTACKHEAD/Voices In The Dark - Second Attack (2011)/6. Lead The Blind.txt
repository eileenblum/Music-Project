Holy front led the way. Lost your mind
Sacred day. Shame and greed. Do your deed
Pay your dues. Live a lie. Justify
Confess your sins, feel remorse. Stay the course

Lead the blind all the way. Judgement day
Threats and fear. Lies you'll hear. See the light
Lead the blind. Pray with me. Get on your knees
Endless life. All you'll need, guaranteed

Holy sin, tender skin, trouble within
Protect their own. Deny the truth. Secret booth
Keep the faith. Secrets safe for today
Pay 'em off. Hide the facts. Cover your tracks.

Tree of life. Adam and Eve. You must believe
Seventh day. Rest your soul. Pay your toll
Book of lies demonize criticize
Believe or not for me gallows tree
