Ancient world. Miles away where demons play
Ritual dance. Around the fire. Flames grow higher
Spirits rise from the grave and possess the brave
Hunt begins, rapid pace. Painted face

Ritual sacrifice, chaos time to die
Ritual sacrifice, chaos take your life

Enter camp, dark of night with prey in sight
Moving slow. Silent crawl with you back to the wall
Caught alive. Gagged and bound. Not a sound
Prize of kings. Royal treat, blood filled meat

Table of stone. Sharpened steel for the ritual meal
Remove the heart. Terror filled eyes as you cannibalize
Offer the gods an empty shell. Destined for hell
Who'll be next in the stew, it could be you
