You were never there and you don't know
How it is when the skin falls from bone
It's the way to nowhere, you're digging your own grave
Sinking in, and they will help you to, they will smile,
And then they'll bury you

Blackened Sun has eclipsed the world, now fight for
The Dawn that will break through and bring the light
Bring the life back
Blackened Sun has eclipsed the world, now fight for
The Dawn that will break through and bring the light
Bring the life

No one is around you, they were ghosts who came and left
Seeking for the answers,lost and wasted, in the clouds of dust
But nothing is over, nothing is over, nothing is over

Still seeking for the way of nowhere
Still seeking for the way of nowhere, you're digging
Your own grave, sinking in, and they will help you to, they will smile,
And then they'll bury you

Blackened Sun has eclipsed the world, now fight for
The Dawn that will break through and bring the light
Bring the life back
Blackened Sun has eclipsed the world, now fight for
The Dawn that will break through and bring the light
Bring the life back
