The sky is falling
I can't see nothing what's above me
I keep walking in unknown way
The drop of blood has grown into a huge tree with wide branches
The leaves of it are so opaque around only darkness, only darkness
It's even hard to breathe course now pressure is too strong
And I'm feeling the weakness, taste of the blood on my tongue

The sky is falling
The sky is falling

Only once, I've seen the light but it has gone so fast
Twice, I've seen the devil and I won't be back
The ground that I've walked is dead and infertile
The air that I've been breathing is haunting me, is choking me
Choking me, I've tried to escape but how I can erase the memories
And get rid of past,
Get rid of my past

The sky is falling
The sky is falling

And what now?
And what now?
Is it the end?
Somebody tells me

If only I had at least one chance
To get rid of my past
I would give everything
To start all over again
Over again
Over again
To start all over again
