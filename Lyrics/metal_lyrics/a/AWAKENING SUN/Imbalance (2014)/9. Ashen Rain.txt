What doesn't kill us makes us stronger
When the sun goes down
Darkness fills horizon
Gloom and cold
Replace cosiness
Ashen rain
Covers all the surface

Times change but we have to stay strong, press on, fight until the end
Our faith is our strength we won't give it away
Times change but we have to stay strong, press on, fight until the end
Our faith is our strength we won't give it away
I won't give it away

Once upon a time
The pile of broken glass
Was one peace of glassware
What is it now?
Now it's just worthless rubbish

Times change but we have to stay strong, press on, fight until the end
Our faith is our strength we won't give it away
Times change but we have to stay strong, press on, fight until the end
Our faith is our strength we won't give it away
We will never, give it away
Never will give it away
