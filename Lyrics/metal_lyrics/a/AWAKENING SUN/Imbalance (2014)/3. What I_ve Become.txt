Waiting, they are waiting for deliverer
Of the boat that is on the other side
Don't push me, Iâm not with all of you,
Get out from my way!

I, I can't believe that I'm here
What I've become? What I've become?
It's not me...

After every breath I realize
That there is no air
And I wonder how my heart
Is still beating flooded with poison?
It had to stop long time ago
But it's still beating, it's still beating

I, I can't believe that I'm here
What I've become? What I've become?
It's not me, it's not me!

Lost in illusions I've turned away from life
Temptation was stronger than the world inside me
What I've become? What Iâve become?
It's not me
