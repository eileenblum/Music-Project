In a mirror maze
I can't find an exit
Someone is calling me
But I don't know where
Beam of the light
Flashed in front of my eyes
All around me gone
What's gonna be next?
And here I am standing on the top of the hill above the sky

Wake me up I can't realize where I am
Dead or alive is it, the real world
Or it's an afterlife.

With the burning torch
I'm moving forward
Lightening up
The way I'm walking
One-armed guard
Appeared from nowhere
He is the key
To all my questions but
As I try to come closer
He moves away from me
And quickly dissolves
As a smoke
In the air
At some point I felt hope
But you've taken it away from me
And now again everything is gone
It repeats over and over again
And here I am standing on the top of the hill above the sky

Wake me up I can't realize where I am
Dead or alive is it the real world
Or it's an afterlife
Wake me up
Am I Dead or Alive?
Wake me up
Am I dead or alive?
Is it the real world?
