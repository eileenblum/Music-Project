Why Are You Staring At ME?
I'm the one in whom you have turned me
I've crucified my soul at the devil's altar
I lived the life that you were afraid to live

You ain't better than me
We are the same
You ain't better than me
We are the same
We are the same

I, I've lived the life as a moment, disbelieved in after
Allowed it burn with the hottest flame and now
You're trying to find me guilty

You ain't better than me
We are the same
You ain't better than me
We are the same

you know what?
Fuck you
fuck you

Long ago our paths diverged
The only thing that united us is that
We both were defeated
You've preferred to stay aside
And dream for the rest of your life
While I was taking all I've ever wanted

Now I'm the one who you always wanted to be
Now, I'm the one who you always wanted to be
Now, I'm the one who you always wanted to be...
