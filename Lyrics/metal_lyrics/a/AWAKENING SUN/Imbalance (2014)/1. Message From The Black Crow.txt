I've received an invitation
To the masquerade of life
Carriage is waiting but why?
Black crow brought it to me
I don't even have the mask

All guests arrived
The Orchestra playâs playing
Deaf conductor is waving his hands
Soulless poetâs reading
Blind waiters are serving drinks
My denialâs not been taken
I'm still the most desired guest

The fear that I had is gone now
The truth has killed all doubts of mine
Why you're not letting me go
I'll never give you my hand
And I'll never become one
I'll never become one of you
You won't break me
Don't even try

All guests arrived
The Orchestra playâs playing
Deaf conductor is waving his hands
Soulless poetâs reading
Blind waiters are serving drinks
My denial's not been taken
I'm still the most desired guest

And I know that it will never end
It won't end
Until the last day of mine
It will never end
It won't end
Until the last day of mine
