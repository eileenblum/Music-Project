In the kingdom of darkness
Where the emptiness prevails
In the place thatâs never seen the light
In the place where life loses its meaning and becomes barren

You've stayed there for too long
Now you're ready to die
Why haven't you escaped?
You've stayed there for too long
Now you're ready to die
Why haven't you escaped?

You're full of hate,
Living in agony.
The world around
Is insanity,
Chaos and mess in your head, dead memories
Pain and disgust, there is nothing left what can
Revive the light.

You've stayed there for too long
Now you're ready to die
Why haven't you escaped?
You've stayed there for too long
Now you're ready to die
Why haven't you escaped?

As each story has the ending
It seems like this one is close to it
And if you'll try to rewrite it
It's something what can't be done
Ink soaked into paper and last dot is already set

You've stayed there for too long
Now you're ready to die
You've stayed there for too long
Now you're ready to die
You've stayed there for too long
Now you're ready to die
You've stayed there for too long
Now you're ready to die
