It's like walking on the edge, no other way
Wrong step and you are doomed to fail
You're given only one chance and no tries
Two ways and you must choose one
No time for reflections
No time

One step, one way, one life
One chance out of 10, so act
ACT NOW!

You can't win it, you can only lose
Fall down and not return.
Strict rules and no pity for none
It's like a war where you have to survive
No time for the doubts
No time

One step, one way, one life
One chance out of 10, so act
ACT NOW!

Time is running out
Don't waste it
Don't waste your time
Make right choice
It's always hard
But there is now way back so
Make decisive step
And no doubts
And No fucking doubts
And no fucking doubts

One step, one way, one life
so live it now
One chance out of 10, so act
act right now
