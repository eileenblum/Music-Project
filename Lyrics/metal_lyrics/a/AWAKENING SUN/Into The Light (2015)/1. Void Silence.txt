Around, I'm walking round and round
In circles, lost in the maze of my brain
Drawings on the walls I face so often
Don't remind me of anything
Hallucinations and voices around
Brings me into another reality
Into the sphere of madness

Counting last minutes of mine, I would rather die

My life, became insufferable
Cause now, I can't find no meaning
All I was before to me means nothing
Now can't change anything
Hallucinations and voices around
Brings me into another reality
Into the sphere of madness

Whether it's day or night
It still feels the same
I can't close my eyes
The voices are getting stronger
Are getting stronger, drilling into my head

Counting last minutes of mine
I would rather die
In the silence of void
I'm locked forever

In the silence of void
Locked forever
In the silence of void

Thanks to awakeningsunofficial for sending track #1 lyrics.
