The world that we had never
Seen before became our huge desire
They've choked up our heads
With different rubbish
Darkness has changed day light
And the way to survive

Awaken the Sun,Awaken the Sun
Awaken the Sun,Awaken the Sun inside of us

Sickness has taken our souls
We just wanted to get into the new world
There was a light that everyone had seen
Exept me,darkness has changed day light
And the way to survive

Awaken the Sun,Awaken the Sun
Awaken the Sun,Awaken the Sun inside of us

The world that we had never seen behore
Became our huge desire
They've choked up our heads,with different rubbish
The world that we had never seen behore
Became our huge desire
They've choked up our heads,with different rubbish

Awaken the Sun,awaken the Sun,awaken the Sun,awaken the Sun
