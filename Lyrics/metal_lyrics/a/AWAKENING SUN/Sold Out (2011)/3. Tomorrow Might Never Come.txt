You have waited all your life
For something that never happened
For day that never came
There is a life you've dreamed of
Recending now
There isn't an obstacle that couldn't break you down

Tomorrow might never come
You've got no time
The Sun will never rise
Clouds are getting dark
Tomorrow might never come
You've got no time
The Sun will never rise
It isn't a tale it's a fucking life
It's a fucking life

forget the path you've walked on
throw out of mind
Cant' you see it's unattainable for you
Too weak to face this,too weak to fight
Too weak to resist,you won't survive

Tomorrow might never come
You've got no time
The Sun will never rise
Clouds are getting dark
Tomorrow might never come
You've got no time
The Sun will never rise
Clouds are getting dark
