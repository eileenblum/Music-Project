I,I have died,this time is
A nightmare for a really fair
Man,we all doomed,to hell
And we are getting there as fast as we can
Gates already opened for us

Once again I ask myself why it's happened to us
Were we so credulous,or were we just blind
Our greediness leads all of us to hell
We're destroying everything

I,I was right ,this world
Became huge unchangeable store
We're all jailed,we can't fight
And we are getting killed if do something wrong
We're just a part of mechanism

Once again I ask myself why it happened to us
were we so credulous,or were we just blind
Our greediness leads all of us to hell
We've destroyed everything
