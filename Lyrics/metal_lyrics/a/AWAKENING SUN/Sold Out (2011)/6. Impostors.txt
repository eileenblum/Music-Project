The walls of lies won't save you
There is nothing sacred
Invisible blood flows through them
Smell of death always attends there
Dead wont forgive for their destructed lives

It's like a wounded clockwork
That once will stop
And never start again
Gates of the cage will be opened
The sword of the fear's has rusted and already cracked

We will pray for eternal light that will
Shine throught an ashen sky that has covered us
Racked us,killed us!!
We will pray for eternal source that never expires,
Pray for fire that will burn forever will burn

A miracle won't happen,someone has broken
fairies wings,now she won't be soon
A few ages've passed through but still
she has no wings

We will pray for eternal light that will
Shine throught an ashen sky that has covered us
Racked us,killed us!!
We will pray for eternal source that never expires,
Pray for fire that will burn forever will burn
