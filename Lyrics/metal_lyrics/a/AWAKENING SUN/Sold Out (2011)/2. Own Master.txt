I'm a master of my life
I don't belong to you
I don't belong to anyone in this world
I'll break down the walls,
I'll become the most scariest nightmare in your life
The most scariest nightmare in your life

I'm a master of my life
I'm a leader in this game
I'm a master of my life
I'm a leader in this game and

You will never resist
You will never resist
Never resist
There is something inside me
That feels
I have strength enough
My resolution has no issue
And i will never regret
Regret of things i've done
Results that I've got
And I wont let you to stop on my way
I'm unattainable goal for you

I'm a master of my life
I'm a leader in this game
I'm a master of my life
I'm a leader in this game

I'm a master of my life
I'm a leader in this game
I'm a master of my life
I'm a leader in this game and
You will never resist
