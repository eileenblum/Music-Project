Life was like a dream we believed in illusions
it was like a fairytale but without a happy ending
we are just a part of game in someone's theatre
being pulled with strings like a marionettes

We just want to live
We just want to breathe
We desire to be free
Couse we are under control

They,they have planned everything
We are in the box that has no escape
It doesn't matter on whose side you are
we're all Still doing one work

We just want to live
We just want to breathe
We desire to be free
Couse we are under control

We are under control
Under control
We are under control
We are under.......
