Begnning of a brutal war just has begun
We can't see but we'll feel it soon
As angels will fall
The quakes will shake us
Destroy motherland
We worship the gods,to give us time
Prolong our days and nights
See last time our sons and wifes
The burning sun will rise
And will melt us down

Consumed by tongues of fire
The Earth will burn
We will shade away in no time
Dormont volcanos will awake and
Everything will drown in lava
We won't even leave no trace
We are losing our planet

Fear feeling that has left
Doesn't leave us
Thinking of melting icebergs
Depletion of the ozone layer
Oceans will rise up
And will drown us all
Huge ships and vast armies won't save us
Our Gods got really angry,we have no
Chance to stay alive
The burning sun will rise
And will melt us down

Consumed by tongues of fire
The Earth will burn
We will shade away in no time
Dormont volcanos will awake and
Everything will drown in lava
We won't even leave no trace
We are losing our planet
