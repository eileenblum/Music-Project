I feel that I'm surrounded
A smell of carrion everywhere
They've dropped with fatigue
I,I see them all they stay apart
Took cover of the night,gave up the ghost
Alive walking corpses sickening me
Soulless,wasted bastards without spiritual wealth

Set me free,as a bird,give me wings
And let me fly away,as far away as i could
Into the new world
Set me free,as a bird,give me wings
And let me fly away,as far away as i could
Into the new world

Infernal,ambition,get rid of you all
Don't make me wait,don't require me to pray
The sands are running out
Alive walking corpses sickening me
Soulless,wasted bastards without spiritual wealth

Set me free,as a bird,give me wings
And let me fly away,as far away as i could
Into the new world
Set me free,as a bird,give me wings
And let me fly away,as far away as i could
Into the new world

Do you know what is the new world?
Clean and true
The world of our ancestors,that we
Have forgotten
It's the World that's only in our
Only in our hearts

Set me free,as a bird,give me wings
And let me fly away,as far away as i could
Into the new world
Set me free,as a bird,give me wings
And let me fly away,as far away as i could
Into the new world
