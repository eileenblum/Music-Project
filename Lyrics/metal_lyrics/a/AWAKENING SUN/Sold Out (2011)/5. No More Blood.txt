Who will be responsible,for everything
You've done,for misery that we have suffered
Who will pay for everything,everything we've lost
The scars in our souls will forever remain

No more blood,we have seen
And suffered enough
No more blood,life is too short
To waste it
Live's too short to waste it
Live's too short to waste it

We still have a lot of things to do without
Wasting our time,loosing our lives
Starting from blank page it's so easy
To say,but on mind only one thing
Who will be responsible,for everything
You've done,for misery that we have suffered
Who will pay for everything,everything we've lost
The scars in our souls will  forever remain

No more blood,we have seen
And suffered enough
No more blood,life is too short
To waste it
Life's too short to waste for nothing
Life's too short to waste for nothing
