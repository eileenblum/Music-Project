Bleeding death, undead, broke the seal Suhrim 
Desecrate, evil ghost Thoth freed him 
Mass destruction, ended lives, blasphemation, you will die 

Darkest one, bleeding death, from beyond 
Death be done, no regression, unforbidden 
You will die - It's been written 

Die - BLASPHEREREION 
Die - BLASPHEREREION 

Vicious wrath Adar, torted past rendered 
Odious evil, elder death, feast us 
God's construction, holy doom 
Don't believe, you're consumed 

Darkest one, bleeding death, from beyond 
Death be done, no regression, unforbidden 
You will die - It's been written 

Die - BLASPHEREREION 
Die - BLASPHEREREION 

Lord chaos, death, save us 
Kill human kind, life was denied 
Lord black death, Thoth, confess 
Send to desecrate, lord blasphemate 

Darkest one, bleeding death, from beyond 
Death be done, no regression, unforbidden 
You will die - It's been written 

Die - BLASPHEREREION 
Die - BLASPHEREREION
