Give praise to Satan, he has won

[Lead - Brian]

Cynical existence, crucifixion
You will give praise to Satan
Lord of lords, kind of kings
Spread your wings
Haunted by the righteous one, bent of my repention
Crucifixion Lucifer, save me from destruction
Holy priest that can't confirm, shun the cross of evil
Violent but undisturbed, wait for thee invertion

[Pre-chorus:]
To break the bonds of evil
To die upon the cross
To die uncertain death
From whom you place it on

[Chorus:]
Crucifixation - Thee unholy denominations
Crucifixation - Holy termination
You will give praise to Satan

[Lead - Brain]

Impaled vibration, Crucifixation
Levitating act of death, messenger of Satan's mass
Blinded by the crucifix, sacrilegious impalement
Kill the chosen, righteous son, claim the cross inverted one
Everlasting hell damnation, from the lord, Crucifixation

[Pre-chorus/Chorus]

Where's my crucifix?
I can't die without it.
