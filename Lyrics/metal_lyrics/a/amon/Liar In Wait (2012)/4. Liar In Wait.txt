Resurrected
Lies and nothing more
Behold your captor
Lost religion, sought by fear
Found through weakness of the soul
Who drown with insecurities
For God, so loved was overthrown
Self - destruction was the key

Implement
Now you have returned
Star - sent experiment upon the Earth
And from your lies, what have we learned?
Humans dwell where wisdom burns

Liar in wait

The whoring of divinity
Breeds extraordinary fallacies

You are hereby banished from our eyes

Liar in wait

Inquisition
Maggots in the sore
The holy rupture
False pretenses swallowed by the whole
Kept inside to guide their lives
With a book of lies to bide their time
A God, so loved has robbed you blind
A chosen race to fall behind

A terrorist
Now you have become
Nazarene - your gatherings have come undone
We await no one
Never what we know is not

Liar in wait

The whoring of divinity
Breeds extraordinary fallacies

You are hereby banished from our minds
