For six hundred millennia
The war was waged
Preempted by the Saurians
This attack on human kind
All sides lost countless lives
And eventually an agreement was reached
The war would end for the time being

Then silence came
As enemies parted ways

Beyond the boundaries of the unwritten truce
Still strong and fierce, the racial tension grew
Lyra, our home - our world was gone
Then laid to waste - she died all alone

Spat forth from the darkness
Our ancestors came
To a new world, light-centuries away
The fourth before relocation to the third
Where human and serpents battled for the Earth

Maintain control
Demented moral stranglehold
Jesus, Allah, honor
Wars arose for wealthy psychos

Needless conflict
Armies led by lies and desensitised
Murder, slaughter, profit
Sacrificed for greed and gore - lust

And violence reigned
Parasites remained

Within the confines of this landmass
We dwell above those who will bring us down
Pure-bloods below
Hybrids among
Their infiltration must be overcome

Spat forth from the darkness
Our ancestors came
To the new world, light-centuries away
The fourth before relocation to the third
And so shall force serpents from the Earth

But they found a way
Through human D.N.A.
Now the hybrid race
Is here to take our place
Needless conflict
Humans-retake life and open your eyes
