The desecrator race is doomed
Their carelessness will reap the punishment
For such dereliction
Awaken Mother
With thunder, arise
Hasten the rising tide
Summon the strength
The flames to scorch
The hunger to devour the sores

Death, to that of the flesh
Avenge their disrespect
Burn them down till nothing is left
They will know darkness

I call thee, of the wind unseen
Come Hurakan
I call to the stricken Earth
Chimalmat - Cabracan
I call Xibalba to release
Toltex

They ravage and scar you
They compile upon the already unbearable
Trauma you exterior must endure
Through aeons, abhorred
I will suffer your wrath
My chosen path is on, at last
Hear the bellowing cries shatter the skies
As our entirety falls

End us
Defeat us
Delete us

I will witness your retaliation
Awaken Mother - arise
Prove your presence to them
Enlighten us through our demise

I call thee, of the wind unseen
Come Hurakan
