The serpents had slain, with their dark illusions
The lords of our colonies
Taking our form and commanding rule
Masters of depravity

They were the wolves as we were the shroud
They came many, and were throughout
From the shadows, they plotted our demise
Livid and deprived they sought to arise

To dominate and destroy mankind
His realm
To overwhelm and redefine

But believe that highly adept, were the light beings
And from the serpent's face
They could rip the veil away
Able to force them back
When Gods were never found
They graced our hostile grounds

Exposed.. the serpent stood, trembling
Unprotected by his holy
At last, our eyes could gouge at him
Casting him from the place of men

Yet bear witness.. still they live.. among us
In dimensions aside.. freely entering our world..
Among us
Unrecognised and unobserved.. they walk among us

In these times, keep an open mind
And prepare to cross the bloodline
Know the enemy by their instabilities
Now you shall see

They were the wolves as we were the shroud
They came many, and were throughout
Doors are unhinged as humans dream
The invasion is the awakening

To dominate and destroy mankind
His realm
To overwhelm and redefine

But believe - highly concerned, are the light beings
And they pray we learn
To rip the veil away
Curious they look onward
But they cannot interfere

Exposed.. the serpent stood, trembling
Unprotected by his holy
At last, our eyes could gouge at him
Casting him from the place of men

Yet bear witness.. still they live.. among us
In dimensions aside.. freely entering our world..
Among us
Unrecognised and unobserved.. they walk among us
