Long before Atlantis, there were men
Who walked with the darkness - spiritually advanced
They called upon beings from the vast deep, below
Which granted passage into this cycle

Formless and of another frequency
Remaining unseen by the Terran offspring
By bloody sacrifice, they could manifest
But only through man, could they acquire access

In ages past, they were conquered by those of light
Driven back deep into the Hell, from whence they had come
But there were some who remained
Hidden in realms unseen by man

In Atlantis, they were as shadows
And at times, they appeared among man
When blood was offered, they came

In our form, they stood with us
But only to our perception, were they human
Serpentine as shadows fell

Appearing among us, as our own
They crept into our counsels
Suppressing vital and priceless knowledge
Raping us of our potential
Retarding our kind
Stifling our minds

Nomadic sons of the Sirius star
With an ancient hatred burning in their hearts
Envious of man, but with deviated souls
Their imminent demise
Has long been foretold

In places where the rites have been said
Where no heart bleeds for the human dead
Again, as time passes
They shall take the semblance of man

Now they coexist with our new God - our government
As they hunger to expand
Technology for the right to descend

In our form, they stand with us
But only to our perception, are they human
Serpentine, behind the veil

They shall take the semblance of man
