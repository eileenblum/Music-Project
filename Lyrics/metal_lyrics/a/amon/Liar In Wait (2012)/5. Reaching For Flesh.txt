Iksuda
With God's word and forked tongue
Justified by their own lies
Corrupt, but glorified  through media
This is what your world is to become

Viscous, malicious
Sadistic, ritualistic
Strapped down, stripped bare
Terrified

Now - illusion fades
The body grows, towering
Feed on fear within
Now to pierce the skin

Fragrance of the fatal wound
Draws the mass into the room
Abducted, tortured, slain, devoured
And entombed

Reaching for the flesh
Of the child, bleeding to death
As the final breath
Slowly exits  his open chest

Master geneticists
Bloodlines obsession
Slaughtering mankind

With God's word and forked tongue
Justified in their sick minds
They hunt
They prey upon our young
Sacrificed for their virgin blood

The Alpha Draconians
Ignorant to their origin
Fear of the soul
Paa Tal

Soon, protection comes
(Above our sky, rebellion grows)
Incoming.. emerging
Our race is now at stake

The cadence of our emotions
Spawns aggressions, envious
For such things, they cannot obtain
Leaving them spiritually restrained

Reaching for the flesh
Of our world, as sentinels slept
We're born where slaves are kept
Shall we die as our saviors rest?
