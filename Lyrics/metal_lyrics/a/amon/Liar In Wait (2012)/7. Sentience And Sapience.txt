Living under faith, dying to escape
Spirited away, reborn into suffering
Growing through the pain with a different name
Waiting for an end
Leaving to become again

Born again yet still so dead
Blackened ash and ever soulless, empty shell of mass neurosis
One of countless more
With a dying mind condemned to rot in total darkness
Spiritual suppression
Knowledge only for the blessed
Underlying vengeance
Elusive opulence of absolution
Substrata, Alpha born from the Omega
Repertory office
Evasive evidence, the great illusion
The unwary, slaughtered into sanctuary

Curse of repetition till we fall into attrition
Bottomless and bleak, is the path of piety
Slipping into servitude
Try to keep in mind, before completely dead inside
That Hell is not awaiting
Never Heaven, God or Satan
Only the ascension

Prepare for disembodiment
Nonexistence is the ultimate experience
Life begins when coming to an end
And all attachments are severed and lie broken

The gate opens

Endless soul expansion, unrestrained by erudition
Flow of information far beyond imagination
Sapience of Ancients
No more kneeling to undo the pain  of being
Separate from the cowards
One within your newfound power
Everlasting consciousness
Sentience

Look in your eyes
Remember you're just trapped inside
As desperate times become our darkest days

Endless soul expansion, unrestrained by erudition
Flow of information far beyond imagination
Sapience of Ancients
Keep in mind, before completely dead inside
That Hell is not awaiting
Never Heaven, God or Satan only the ascension
