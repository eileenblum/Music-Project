Children of a second coming
Bred to follow all for nothing
Give to us the gift of slavery
To leeches preaching Heaven's bribes
Who lash thy tongue and vomit lies
And feign eternal life, among the dying

Legions of hungry brethren
Awaiting their deliverance
Shrouded within his story's darkness

To thrive on simple pleasures
To seek, in vain, a skyward treasure
But death will let you down
And leave you underground

Despite your dedication and all the praise you've wasted
Delirious are his ways
And all the dying brethren await a God mistaken
Halo-deep in holy shit
To bastards lacking open minds
Who lash thy tongue and vomit lies
It's time to realise you're rotting inside
Extolling dead men to fill the absence
Now know that you have been abandoned

How can you say that you have faith...
When so much fear befalls your worthless judgement?

Our only chance at evolution
And you'll regret your devotion
Fail to advance and you will be left
To rot with your faith - Bound to the flesh

Molestation of the soul
As our apocalypse unfolds
Preface of a story, never to be told

Dead, how could we ever know?
To the vagrant serpentines
A brutal truth will set you free
Terra's ours and we intend to keep

When all eyes are upon you
And you feel the rush of fear within you
You will beg for our mercy
Brutalized in revolution

Draco, Zeta
Ignored no more
Andromedans, Plejaren
Join us
Wage war

Shall you die alone and bound
When so much doubt consumes your only way out?

Our only chance at evolution
And you'll regret your devotion
Fail to advance and you will be left
To rot with your faith - Bound to the flesh
