Join us 
Evil night of an evil death 
Epitome of illusion 
Sacrifice of the unborn child 
Enter the kingdom of darkness 
Sodomized for the ritual 
For there is nowhere to run 
Open the gates to the manifestation 
And grant me the powers of darkness 

Infenal majesty, take this dead offering 
Feeding the demon seed, evil bestowed on me 
Exorise the powers of death 
Invert my cross of time 
The retaim of Satan anarchy 
Inside my scared sign 
Lucifer bring me the legions of deaths 
Abbadon kill until nothing is left 
Oblivious to evil 
Death of defled the rituals 
Of dreams and disillusion 
Unlock the box and gimp in pain 
Summon the demons
