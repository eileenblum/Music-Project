Invective death, from the hand 
To write the book of evil 
Terminus of the overture 
Recite the role of power 

Schizophrenic reflex, vesicate, mutilate 
Refuse the force on which you die 
Myrmidon of Goethe 
Abortion of angels that flee for their lives 
Animated onslaught, expectorated discharge 
Elegy of evil, visions of light for thou has forgotten 

Adulation scripture, dominate, terminate 
Fascist author of Gods 
Drubbing of his light fears 
Bring forth the atheist, sent to inseminate 
Aggravated blasphmere, insurrected one to tell 
Power through defile 
Mephisto is coming to claim me for hell 

Satan. 
Take me MEPHISTOPHELES 
Insurrect the shield of Satan 
Grant me immortality 
To rise
