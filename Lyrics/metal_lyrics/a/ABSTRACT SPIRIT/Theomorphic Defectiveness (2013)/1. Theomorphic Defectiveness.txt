From singularity to bipolarity
Afraid of own lethal treasures
And if being does cost too much
Then death should be priceless
It is even unable to cover up
That theomorphic defectiveness

Bastard pregnancy with a child of gnostic wrath
Chronic malignancy, slow torture to unavoidable death
Phenomenon of uniqueness once set on a throne
Parades of sickness given
In honour of canonized flegmatics (sic)

Face your god of perverted aesthetics
Fear your god of deviant pathetics
Insidious and rutheless substance
Drug-induced coma
Massive entrance

Who has stolen the light of your eyes
Broken the sacred image of lies
It is even unable to reproduce
Your theomorphic defectiveness
