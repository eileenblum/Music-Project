It feels so empty
Dwelling among the bustling biomass
Chaotic flickering
Bacteriums (sic) through the microscope
Indifferent electric light
Brings no life to crippled souls
Pathetic generation
Under oppression of thinking machines

Huge grey gathering
In collapse of morality
Concrete steel empire
Fragile to deformity

Dying out surrounded
With borrowed needless things
With betrayed ideals of constance (sic)
Belching out sordid duality

It feels so needed
Like a needle for a craving vein
Delight through filth
Beyond the border of behaviour
Reproduction without control
To be lost among the similar ones
Cloned to live instead
Of them theirselves (sic)
