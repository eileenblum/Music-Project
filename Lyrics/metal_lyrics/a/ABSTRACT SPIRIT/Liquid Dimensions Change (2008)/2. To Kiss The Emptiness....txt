Spread like roots under the ground,
Merge with it taken away...
Existence within soft silence...
Free from pain, but sentenced to stay...
Obscured by unforgiveness...
The dawn no longer rises,
The night has lost its sense,
Turned into Endlessness...

By blows of black gall,
Grief throws out of a heart
Bleeding lonely in passion...
Neither deliverance, nor confession...

Moist soil whispers around,
Worms caress the surface of skin...
This shelter is too cold to rest
In eternal slumber so attractive...
Listening to rustles, staring into blackness
To bury memories deeper...
Loving nothing, feeling no one
To kiss the emptiness...
