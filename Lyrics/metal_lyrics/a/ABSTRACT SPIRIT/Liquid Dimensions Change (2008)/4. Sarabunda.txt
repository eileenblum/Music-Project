Slowly darkens the sky, the light fades out -
The silver-grey eyes forever close.

No more hopes the dawn will bring
Cause no one from now can give a hope.
Slowly the world is slipping down
Cause no one is able to keep and to hold.

I may suffocate with scream stuck in the throat,
Drown in the flows of tears my face,
Gaze without sleep in the night so cold
But it happened all that would never take place.

Up high you wielded the power of steel
Only phantoms at dusk there will fly.
Enemies trembled suppressed by your will,
Why now, when the triumph was close, why?

Condemned to be followed by horror and pain,
Sentenced to carry more than can endure
I stand asking silence again and again,
The empty abyss takes the features of you.

I stand by the tomb in the shadow of woe,
Rain mixes its drops with my sorrow and tears,
The frozen time stops, seems no end of this day,
Last farewell,
Last instants,
Last honour,
Last way...
