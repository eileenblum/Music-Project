Mistrust the silence...
Liquid dimensions change...
Spreading fear and strain...
Filamentous minds...
Shocking self-disclosure...
Embraced by suffocation
In airless spaces walk
Among cadaverous smirks...

Pompous pillars in a line...
Paranormal flashings...
Nostrils torn with stench
Quiver with the wind...
Buds of youth wither
Grow blacker day by day...
Stress and confusion...
Caught... bitten to death...

Wasted years
Of somnolence...
Broken to peaces being...
Fallen from life.

Dead seconds resurrect...
Frozen moments melt...
So absurdly
To dwell...
