I see your portrait in the ornament of lies
With the senseless marble eyes
I am almost buried under your mortal sin
In that void deep within
I suffocate among your gospels
And abstract revelations
Avoiding your distant cold
Forlorn in distress, how can I hold you in my heart?

Belief so lucid and fragile
Leads from enslavement to exile
Your angels could fly
If I could be blind

Existence for a moment of delight...
But not for amorphous devices...
I negate you as a fact,
I reject your laws for closed eyelids
The stars so wise and old
Look at you with scorn
And your heavens bleed fallen
In a world of dead colours

And  I choke with your maggots
Untouched by venomous gleams
And I watch my life through
Convulsive painful ecstasy.
Tear my soul apart
If your mercy has no edges
Stop my heart forever,
Compel me to get down on my knees.
