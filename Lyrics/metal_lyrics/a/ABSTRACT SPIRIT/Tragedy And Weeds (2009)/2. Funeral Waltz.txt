Only once I came to speak no words,
To dissolve among these grey stones.
Only once I came for one last dance,
To take all I have never had.
No one will see me on my knees,
I came alone to correct mistakes,
To disturb the slumber of the forgotten,
To let one pain hurt me one more time...

Music of the wind and falling leaves...
The night keeps silence watching me...
I will stare into the haze
Until I understand I am still alone...

Faces around me are just mirrors
Reflecting disaster which fills me.
Wretched pieces of memories
Writhe in agony near my feet.
No light shed, no voices heard...
Your archangel of a stolen dream
Lies on a tomb with broken wings
While echo tears my screams apart...
