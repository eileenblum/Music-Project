This world sucks, everything's the same
Everyone tries to throw the blame
Fatalist belief destroying the life
Rusty mind washing our mind
Religions are sick, everything's the same
Ideals are sick
This world sucks, everything's the same
No one tries to accept the blame
Fatalist belief destroying the life
Rusty mind washing our mind
No one got nothing to fight or die for
No one wants to show the love inside
Egoism and hate are rules of life
Friendship and thrust are forgotten things
'New World Order Sucks!'
