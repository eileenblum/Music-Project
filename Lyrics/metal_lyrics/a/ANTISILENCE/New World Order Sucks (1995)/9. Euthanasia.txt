Writing at deaths door
Life is unnecessary for him
Being tied to machines
Won't give him the will to live
Law gives permission to kill
While it prohibits the will to die
People are against
It is his life not yours
Euthanasia
Give him the chance to die
Decision belongs to him
Human rights are against euthanasia
'Cos they believe
Human must live
Whatever in peace or in pain
Pain-Pain-Pain is the same
Life-Life-Life is the pain
