37 people dying in fire
But by whom? Someone
But where? Somewhere
But who sees? Everyone
But who cares? No one
Modern world inquisition
Innocent people burned
Like witches in fire
Dark ages returned
What have they done to deserve this
Now believes are safe
'Cause wisdom drowns in fear
'Hundreds of people were murdered
For religion and for racism
Human rights were always misunderstood
In my country'
'I'll will fight for human rights,
Democracy, freedom and world peace
I'm ready to give my life for
This cause, I swear...
