Since the creation of technology
Life becomes easier and harder
Einstein divided atoms
And they destroyed Hiroshima
Build nuclear reactors
Haven't thought about the future
Became slaves of TV
Of imperialism
What will technology give us
Destruction and impure nature
Where will technology lead us
To a life of suffer and pain
It seems so tragic
Illogical logic
