Three years passed since it began
Leaders talking again and again
When will this slaughter come to an end
When will the Bosnians see happy end
Woman, baby, old, child
It don't matter what you are
A bomb may come to your house
Who will pay for the crimes
This is not war
This is not war
What is war
Slaughter
Innocent woman crying
For her baby not living
Bastard soldier is raping
Thousands of remains in the land
Now they are dusts in the sands
Gali Sucks
Karadzic Sucks
United Nations Sucks
