Unthrusting the youth, giving no chance
Washing the brains, putting into trance
Telling the lies that they are real
It doesn't matter how we feel
Someone says they know it right
Punishing public for the blames
Of the riches with their games
Justice of the riches is like
The pussy of the bitches
Conservative government is a pain
'Cos it always stays the same
New is wrong in their eyes
In their fuckin' fuckin' minds
Someone says they know it right
But I say they know it wrong
Don't you ever feel it
Don't you ever see it
Don't you understand it
Don't you resist
Administration
