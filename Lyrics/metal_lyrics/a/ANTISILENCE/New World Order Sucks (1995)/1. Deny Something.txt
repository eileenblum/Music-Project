Fucker, what have you done
Sucker, all said undone
You don't know the meaning
Of your fucking life
You don't know what it means
To deny something
Deny-Deny
Deny them, all of them
Deny them, deny something
Religion, hate, racism, fate
Prejudice, conservation, Satan, life
You say the rules of life
Bores you so much
Why don't you stand up and resist
