I say you're for us
You say that we're for you
Nothing's wrong with us
Everything's wrong with you
Taxes we all pay / Torment you all give
Untouchables you are / Arrested ones we are
I see what I see / Everything's wrong to me
Stop it or will destroy
What is on your minds
Can not we decide / We don't need you now
We pay for your system
We die for your lies
In my childhood I was told :
"Government never lies..."
(Now I just can understand,
Government always lies.)
Taxes we all pay / Torment you all give
Untouchables you are / Arrested ones we are
Nothing's wrong with us
Everything's wrong with you
With you, nothing's good
Government never tells the truth.
