Where's our equality
It must have gone away
Don't walk away
Take the power as they stay
Listen to just what I say
No way!
Raise your voice pass on the light
Don't give up without a fight
Or nothing's gonna be alright
Democracy is a lie
Justice is ripped and tom
Don't walk away
Take the power as they stay
Listen to just what I say
No way!
Raise your voice pass on the light
Don't give up without a fight
Or nothing's gonna be alright
Someone loses someone wins
Someone chooses all the pills
Someone takes it all away
Someone lives and someone pays
Who cares?
If this is freedom
They must be joking
Don't walk away
Take the power as they stay
Listen to just what I say
No way!
Raise your voice pass on the light
Don't give up without a fight
Or nothing's gonna be alright
Someone loses someone wins
Someone chooses all the pills
Someone takes it all away
Someone lives and someone pays
Who cares?
Someone loses someone wins
Someone loses someone wins
Someone loses someone wins
Someone lives and other one pays
Who cares?
