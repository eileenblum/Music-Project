Your heart won't go on
In that sinking ship
This is cup of lies
This is the one
Miami could be hell
Unless you change your name
This world's an arena
Do the macarena

Wake up - they're using you
You're gonna be the clown of the world

You know he's too bad
He can't heal the world
Everything I do
I won't do it for you
Every time we fall
I won't give my all
People of the lies
Spice down your lives

Wake up...

Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?
Do you really want it?

Wake up...
