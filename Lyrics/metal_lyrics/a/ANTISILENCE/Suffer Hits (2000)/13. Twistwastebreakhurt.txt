Why do you hang around?
Why do you telephone?
Why do you call my name?
Why do you come home?
Why do you tell me that you need me?
Why do you tell me so?
Why do you leave me?
I want to be a machine not to be hurt anymore
Why don't you stop saying you are so sorry?
Why don't you think I don't need your excuses?
Why don't you understand "you&amp;I" is a lie?
Why don't you think so?
Why don't you go and die?
I want to be a machine not to be hurt anymore
Why do you try to twist my mind?
Why do you try to waste my time?
Why do you try to break my heart?
Why do you try to hurt me?
I want to be a machine not to be hurt anymore
