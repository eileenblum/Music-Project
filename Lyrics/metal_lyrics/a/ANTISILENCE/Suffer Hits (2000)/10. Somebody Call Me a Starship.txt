Welcome to a place where everyone's a bitch
Everyone's a bastard, everyone's a pimp
Who asked me anyway to come to this world?

Don't wanna live here anymore

Something's wrong with the world today
I don't know just what to say
Who asked me anyway to come to this world?
Only thing I want is to go away
Somebody call me a star ship
Take me away from this world
Somebody call me a star ship
Don't wanna live here anymore
