I scream in your face
I scream in your ears
I scream in your eyes
I scream you don't hear
You have religions and you have nations
You have this system to give satisfaction
And when the time will come
I want to watch you fall
I used to believe that you would ever hear my call
I scream in your face
I scream in your ears
I scream in your eyes
I scream you don't care
You say you're satisfied with what you're getting
You will never know what you are missing
And when the time will come
I will sure watch you fall
I never believe that you would ever hear my call
I scream in your face
But, you don't care anyway
Now I see, it's my turn
I won't care anymore
Live your life your way
Fuck revolution
I won't scream anymore
Come on honey!
Won't scream anymore
