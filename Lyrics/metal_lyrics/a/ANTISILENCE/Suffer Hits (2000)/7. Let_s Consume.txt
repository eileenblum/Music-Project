Come&amp;buy it
Population is our market
Throw the old goods
Destroy the old goods
Buy the new ones
Let's consume
Come&amp;buy it
Brand new machines
They work for you
That's not enough
Nothing's enough
If we produce
You must buy it
Let's consume
Hypnotised-going to buy
Hypnotised-have to buy
Let's consume
