I could change the world
But I failed
No one believed me
Nor did I
People, they looked at me
And they laughed
And I laughed
But, what could it give me?
Utopia is where you can reach
Unless they stop you
They stopped me
I stopped myself
Revolution was my obsession
But, if I can't reform myself
Where can this revolution
Take me to?
I was hopeless
But, not disappointed
Now, I am disappointed
And hopeless
I came, I saw, I lost
Lost my face, lost my faith
Lost my hope in this living game
Lost my crown, became a clown
Lost my trust in everyone
Everything's lost, I am lost
Two-faced men I hated them most
Now I am one of those men
Don't care about me
I won't come again
