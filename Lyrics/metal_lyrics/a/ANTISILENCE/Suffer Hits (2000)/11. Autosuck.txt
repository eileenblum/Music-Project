(Closed my eyes, burned them tonight
In my world there's no light
In these days I feel alone
Do you know I feel alone)
You're so weak, but I can't say I'm strong
And the pain, that turns you on
In these days you feel alone?
Don't complain that you're alone
(And I now just want to die
If I do it, would you cry?
Do you know I want to die?
Realize I want to die)
Same mistakes made all the time
Although you lose, you don't realize
In these days you want to die?
No one cares if you die
You suck by repeating yourself
Doing the same things all the time
You suck-Don't repeat yourself
You Suck!
