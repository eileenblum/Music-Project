Come alone to face the truth
Truth is everywhere you look
Look at you, look at the hate inside you
Look at me, hate is really inside me
What's the hate? - tell me now
I can beat it - no matter how
What's the hate? - tell me now
I can beat it - anyhow
Come face the truth
Truth is hate, my friend
I need hate like blood in my veins
You don't know what to hate
Hate the false that everyone knows
Know they're wrong, know they're mean
Know they're everything you don't need
Stay away, just stay far away
Come face the truth
Truth is hate, my friend
I need hate like blood in my veins
(How can you hate someone without loving the others?
How can you love someone without hating the others?)
