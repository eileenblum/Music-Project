Playing with your fingertips 
on the strings of my weaknesses, 
I donât want to be your muse. 
I pray that you will free me 
from the weight of your dire chords. 
Thus putting down the bow of your 
desires, kind of echoes inside of me, 
I pray for my soulâs ears 
To get deaf to your harmonies! 

Your hope is my despair, 
A lullaby for my sorrows, 
I am only the si minor. 
From your score where you carelessly 
drop the eighth of your inspiration. 
How I wish I was nothing but a sigh 
and not the reflection of your ego 
anymore. 

While the melodious flow of my tears 
composes the sound of your harmonies, 
I pray so that this prelude 
marks the end of this sonata! 
While my heartbeats give its rhythm 
to the tones of your tempo, 
I pray so that your music 
finally falls in eternal silence. 

While I keep chanting your lyrical works, 
I implore your uttermost feelingâ¦ 
May you stop directing my life!
