Lost moments blown awayâ¦ 
They are wounds time cannot healâ¦ 
I looked at you as a friend, 
I looked at you as a guide, 
I wanted to be perfect, 
perfect as a childâ¦ 
I looked at you as a friend, 
I looked at you as a guide, 
I just wanted to be perfect, 
but all your trusted were phoney icons. 

All I ever felt, I never could forgive. 
All I ever dreamt was far out of reach. 
I never thought it would 
come out to this. I never thought 
youâd reject me like this. 

I looked deep inside your mind, 
I saw the pain you tried to hide, 
well, your look was so pathetic to me. 
I looked deep inside your mind 
I saw the pain you tried to hide, 
then I saw you lying as screwed as me. 
Now itâs too late. 

All I ever wanted, a little peace of mind. 
All I ever trusted are things I left behind. 
I never thought it could turn out like this, 
I never thought it would get sour like this. 
Cause Iâm hooked tooâ¦ 

Your heart turned to stone, it makes me 
sick to hear that all we felt was crap! 
Do you see what I am at? I love 
you best but you played in with me. 
Why did you throw the Jack of Hearts 
away? I canât make it anymore and 
I feel hopelessly weighed down 
by your eyes of steel. You know, 
there are wounds time canât heal. 

You slipped away, your world is not mine! 
Recurring memories emerge with the 
fear of darkness, a cool breeze down my spineâ¦ 
Lost moments blown away, let there be a sad mood! 
Phoney icons are just synonymous 
with love, hate, death and freedomâ¦
