Flowers are fading, theircries are
haunting me, petals of raining,
floral sobs. Thanks for dressing me
in this fall coat exhilarating all my
senses by this slight fetid humidity!
Trees are unveiling and their bareness
captivates me, heavenly still-life,
floral nudity...

Thanks for this innocent clearness
exhilarating all my senses by this
grisly magnificent inertia!
Bitterness flirts with my life
whose alliance is my soul
whose season is fall and whose
wedding march is this melody.

Leaves are dying, I'm getting chilled
by their cries, lifeless bed, bloody carpet.
Thanks for this blazing picture
exhilarating all my senses by these
shimmering and painless flames!
The wind blows, I get bewitched by
its song, intangible melody
deathly hymm.

Thanks for tirelessly rocking GaÃ¯a
exhilarating all my senses
by sensual icy caresses.
My life flirts with Bitterness
whose alliance is my soul
whose season is Fall and whose
wedding march is this melody

Bitter symphony, drown tour pitches
in the huge lake erased by the haze,
thus covering every disagreement,
only letting pop out, like the break
of day, a nostalgic scrap.
Trees are unveiling heavenly still-life
the wind blows, deathly melody.

May this become a hymm.
A hymm to dead leaves,
A hymm to blowing wind
A hymm to Bitterness.
