Shadows rushing in the sky like fanatical riders, 
winds are beating strong down on our landsâ¦ 
No one ought to offend against the majestic Nature
You know how terrible her war hymn can be! 

Shadows rushing in the sky like fanatical riders
Beginning a crazy run against all existenceâ¦ 
Drinking light and swallowing up in a smoke patch the screams of the repented. 
Inside of you burns the guilty feeling not having been able to tame her; 
Soon the walls will fall downâ¦ 
and from her womb, the ultimate sighâ¦ 

Clamours arising from red-glowing plains, 
while breaking off this deadly silence. 
All you have been creating will disappear from her infallible soul. 

Winds beating down on a weird purifying blaze. 

Facing the power of the time being, all past fades away. 

You bend yourself, you canât avoid her judgement. 
Waters awakening from longstanding sleep flood over. 
The land stakes of dissension, where innocent rotting bodies are lying, secretly bound to 
a dreadful master. 

So goes on the deadly dance only wearing another costume. 
You bred your own torturer but sheâs been ahead! 
The more you will curse each of her whims, the more you will not 
Help yourself but yielding to her furor. 

Excited by the lust for power and cruelty
You made a servant of the weakest one by setting up your reign of pain. 
Your tears will wash away in vain the lands your folly stained. 
Your bodyâs shaken with fear. 
Now your look reveals your true nature.
