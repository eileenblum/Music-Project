Busy city morning
As an explosion
Takes the peace away
People running round in
Chaotic motion
'Cross the fiery place

Bodies lying lifeless
Cover the ground with
Blood of innocence
Sirens cut the silence
An act of violence
Inconceivable

And all that will remain
Is the memory of the pain
A terrifying calmness
Let my senses slip away

I am
Watching their faces on fire
Screaming through the crow
Chaotic senselessness
Burnin' hope for untroubled life

Liars
Speak every kill takes you higher
To paradise in hell
Innocence has died
As we've lost the way

Shattered by this madness
A tearful sadness growing
Deep inside
Killing in the name of
Absurd illusions
Needless suicide
