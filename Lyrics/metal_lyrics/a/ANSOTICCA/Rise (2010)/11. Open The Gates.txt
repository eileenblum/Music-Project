Whispers inside
Keep telling me I'll break down
Nowhere to hide
It feels like I am falling

But I can feel it
As a desire
I'm gonna give you all of me
I can hear you
The call of angels
Now come and take me
I am ready

Open the gates and
Take my soul
(I) won't be afraid of
Losing it all
I'm not falling from grace
I'll save my face
Transcend the shadows
Keeping me away...

No life inside
My mind's so numb so clouded
The candle has died
There's coldness all around me

And I still hear you
The call of angels
Now come and take me
I am ready
