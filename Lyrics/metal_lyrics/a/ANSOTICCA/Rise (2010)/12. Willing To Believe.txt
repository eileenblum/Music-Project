Hiding, searching
My blood runs cold
Emptiness is crying
A fairytale untold

The ruins of what was
Once a dream
Arose within the fight
Left within the memories
There's nothin' more inside

Hold me when I'm dying
I fear to be alone
Save me when I'm crying
Can't take it on my own
Now that I am stranded
Blind and broken
Will you light the darkness
For I am willing to believe

Silent whispers
Keep me awake
Cold night
Creeps into me
Turns colors into grey

The story of a dying day
Is all I have to tell
So speaking with my
One last breath
I bid you my farewell
