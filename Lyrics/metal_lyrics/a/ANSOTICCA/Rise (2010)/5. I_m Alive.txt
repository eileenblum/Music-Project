This is the life that
Leaves us restless
It's the end of all that
We have known before

The search for beauty
Leaves us breathless
In these days where nothing
Matters anymore

This is not our dying... !

I'm holding on
Flying to the sun
Keep holding on
'Til I'm alive

This is the time that
Built resistance
Stole the innocence of
An illusive dream

We're fighting back to
Close the distance
For the change that
Has to come
And set us free

This is not our dying... !

I'm holding on
Flying to the sun
Keep holding on
'Til I'm alive
