Once I woke with tired eyes
Left the doors wide open
Listening as the laughter dies
Hear the silence growing

All this heartache
Can't decline with you not here
Tearful memories creeping with the fear

Passing through a winter night
Strawling through the deadness
Dreaming of the end in sight
Fall into the sadness

A lonely rider
Flying on the wings of past
Through the fire
'Til the dies been cast

RISE
Take me to the shore
Don't wanna see me die
Like I did before

RISE
Walk right through
This door
Don't wanna see me cry
Like I did before
RISE
