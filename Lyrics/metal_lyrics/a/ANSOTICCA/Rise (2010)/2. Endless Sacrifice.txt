Conversation with the silence
Gets me safer through the night
Let me listen to your words
Who am I?

I'm a fool that lost the way
Led by agony and pain
Shall I drown in boundless sorrow
Who I am?

I look around into the mirror
And it feels right
I come alive my mind gets clearer
I don't want to hear your

LIES
Of one more paradise
(Come alive now)
I am dying inside
Since I have lost reliance
It's an endless sacrifice
Await the afterlife
(Won't you die now)
I am dying inside
I have lost reliance
It's an endless sacrifice

I lay my life into your wisdom
Not to find that I'm restrained
Nor to find me here in prison
I'm afraid

I'm getting closer to the mirror
Still it feels right
My troubled mind is turning weirder
Knowing you're just telling

LIES
