Lying alone lost in a dream
Breathing gets harder
With you not here

All by myself - once more you're gone
How can I embrace you
When you're not near

Open your eyes - when you turn to the light
We're losing ground on this way
Open your eyes - and kick of your pride
Before there is no more to say
Free your mind
Break the chains
Don't run away

All that I try is staying alive
But I have to find me
Frozen inside
I have become a slave to your will
Seems like our time
Is moving in for the kill

Open your eyes - when you turn to the light
We're losing ground on this way
Open your eyes - and kick of your pride
Before there is no more to say
Free your mind
Break the chains
Don't run away

Take your time - look inside
Leave behind you will find
In the end I will be by your side
Turn the tide just step out
Of the dark come with me
Oh - and come with me
