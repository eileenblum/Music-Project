The deafness in my mind
Is screaming
Where did we go blind
Lost the way

Fortune predefined
No other meaning
Where shall we go
When our lives collide

Straight to the borderline
Feeding the virus of hatred
Don't take this heart of mine
Is this the last serenade

Wide awake - Still forlorn
Break of day - Educing the storm
Bitter end - Compelling me to rest
In silence
'Til we fade away

Ignorance was kind
Continous
Rising with the tide
Tearin' down trust
With emptiness aside
Outrageous
All we have been
Is turning to dust

Straight to the borderline
Feeding the virus of hatred
Don't take this heart of mine
Is this the last serenade

Wide awake - Still forlorn
Break of day - Educing the storm
Bitter end - Compelling me to rest
In silence
'Til we fade away
