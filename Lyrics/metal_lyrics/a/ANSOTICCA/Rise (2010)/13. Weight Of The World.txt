In rage - The fear is hunting me
In pain - A life of agony
In tears - Somebody call this
Heart of sorrow

The dark - It came into my life
The thrill - Keep me awake at night
The fear - How will I ever reach
tomorrow

It's burning me from deep inside
The emptiness is rising within
No place to hide I'm on my own
The night became a friend on My side

My darkest hour
Came with the shadows
Feels like I
Take the weight of the world
A shattered soul
I see the world in darkness
Torn and ruined in disgrace
Wake me now

Your tears - There is
No place to hide
Your fear - Attender at my side
Your blood - A frozen curse that
Leaves me haunted

Your fate - Is driving me insane
I'll rise - I can't escape the pain
I'm here - Somebody take away
This madness now

Still burning me the end in sight
The loneliness is rising within
He's on my side I'm all alone
Obscurity has taken my pride
