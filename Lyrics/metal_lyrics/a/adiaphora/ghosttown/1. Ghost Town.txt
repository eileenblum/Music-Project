50000 people used to live here...
Now it's a ghost town

Suddenly the lapse in logic is apparent
No one left to deny the tyranny of bigotry
No one left

We are...
The seldom sought after the devoid!
Of empathy of earth!
You are!
The absolute source of contempt

[2x]
Social conformist (we are the faceless)
The eyes of the worthless (heretics that break bread)

Tear apart the only thing that ever loved you unconditionally
Fuel the dreams of the only ones out for monetary
Sunken bastards drowned in the midst of the burning ship!

[2x]
I will survive

We are...
The seldom sought after the devoid!
Of empathy of earth!
You are!
The absolute source of contempt

[2x]
Social conformist (we are the faceless)
The eyes of the worthless (heretics that break bread)

We are the future
We are the advocates

[2x]
Bring forth the head of the enemy

My hands will crush your fucking face
