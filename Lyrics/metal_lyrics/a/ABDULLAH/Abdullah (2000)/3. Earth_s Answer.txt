Hey, will the world turn upon me
Will the soul survive ultimately
Oh, will peace ever be found
When I drag my feet on hallowed ground

And I don't want to know what the future will hold
And I don't want to pray because I'm lost anyway

Hey, will the pain follow me there
Will I turn my back on despair
Oh, will the sun shine upon me
When the body dies, is the soul set free

And I don't want to know what the future will hold
And I don't want to pray because I'm lost anyway

Because your mind can close you in
And seclusion becomes a friend
I won't walk away
And my eyes can't fool me
When your world seems at an end
There's no reason to pretend
That things will be okay
And my eyes can't fool me

To your soul
I say, let it go

Because your mind can close you in
And seclusion becomes a friend
I won't walk away
And my eyes can't fool me
