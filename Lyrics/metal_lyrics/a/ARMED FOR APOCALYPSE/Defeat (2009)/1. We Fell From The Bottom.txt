When we fell
We fell from the bottom
Our blood boils as it spills for no one

It's all fucking gone

The souls of the wicked and the damned
Have staked their claim on these lands
The mad will wield the scepters
Drown the
vermin in blood

Hell has swallowed our world
The fight is all we have

Swarms of death stamping out all light
Possessed
Breathing hell and storms
Taking perverse forms
Rotted core to crust
No hope

They bled our
young dry
They bled our faith dry
This fight (We bleed)
We never wanted (For nothing)
Has killed (All dead)
Our spirit (Lives wasted)
No hope (We tried)
No future (We failed)
It's all fucking gone

Ride this storm
Ride this storm to your grave
