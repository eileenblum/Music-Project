I fall from the heavens in a blaze of fire and glory
And shatter into myriad
Pieces of answers and questions
Fears and temptations
Despairing, confused,
apart from the whole

I am kings at war
I am ravaged, tired souls
I am
fading hearts
And bloodsoaked robes

Malice old as time
Vengeance old as lies

I am fists of gods
Beating distance into minds
That cling to better times

Ancient future
Sands of time
Broken consciousness
In broken shrines

Blood will flow like rivers
The bond is lost

In the fury of the
fight, there will be no shame
