Have a black heart
(fall) I need suffering
(off) I need reckoning
clip your own wings
(mayday) I crave misery
for it gives me the fuel I need
sell yourself short
(whore) I'm done
I'm always done
weak, flawed, wasted 
it hurts
this way of living

..&amp; you think it's natural

the pressure is mounting
disciple of death 
viscera turns to stone
disciple of death

bow before the throne
worshipper of illusions
viscera turns to stone..

it hurts
this way of living
&amp; you think it's natural..

dead is dead is real
your black heart is mine
now is here is gone
patient misery is inevitability
life is alive here
racing toward the end
eat our black heart
