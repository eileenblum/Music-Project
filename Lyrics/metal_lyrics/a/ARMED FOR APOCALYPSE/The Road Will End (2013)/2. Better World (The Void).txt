I am sickened by everything 
retching!
at odds with every day
burn my brain in effigy

expectation.. has murdered fulfillment.. 
I'm done

endless capacity for failure
I've seen better worlds
through a thick, white fog
intention has slaughtered my resolve
longing for the viod
i need a roof over my head
so I can let it rot &amp; cave in
bury my head in my hands
&amp; my heart in the sand
I will let them win

I've seen fire rain
on an sea of open arms
longing for the void
living for the void

your nerve is shot by your shame
all defenses deployed
living for the void

plunging toward the void
I've seen better worlds
in a state of shock
longing for the void
living in the void

endless capacity for failure
endless [2x]
