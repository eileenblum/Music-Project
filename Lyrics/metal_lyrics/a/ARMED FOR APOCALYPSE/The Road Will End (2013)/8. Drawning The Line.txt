The payoff
is empty pockets &amp; broken teeth
slowly rotting
like a concept of self
lost in the depths of a level of excess
by no other name but home

let's draw a line!
&amp; not be defined by a defunct design
let's draw a line!
live for something that you need to survive

when the world fucking crashes
we're all crashing with it
this shit is played out, 
but i gotta stick with it
I'm dying inside, 
but I'm lucky to be alive
failure is certain, 
but it's still worth a try

let's draw a line!
&amp; not be defined by a defunct design
let's draw a line!
live for something that you need to survive
oh, you need to survive
live for something that you need to survive
let's draw a line!
a line to define what we have in this life

I finally feel.. something more
&amp; it rips itself to shreds

I'm lost in the fog
