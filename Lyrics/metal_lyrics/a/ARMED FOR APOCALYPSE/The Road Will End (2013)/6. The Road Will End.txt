It's good to know that you fail all the time
stick around for the ride!
it's falling short every time that you try
stick around for the ride!

it's the same thing..
the same way
you're bound to lose it..
so give it away

I was the first to bleed 
&amp; the first to lose
whatever comes back to me.. (back to me)
I'm not giving it to you
to see one's own intestines
means secrets revealed

the same thing
in a different way
you're bound to lose
lose

It's good to know that you fail all the time
stick around for the ride!
it's falling short every time that you try
stick around for the ride!

the road will end! 
&amp; so will our ambitions
the road will end!
dig a hole
