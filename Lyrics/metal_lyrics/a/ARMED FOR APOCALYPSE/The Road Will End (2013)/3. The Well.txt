Fates collapse
when meaning finds new ground
impossible reasons progress
impressionable scowls take in scrounge
if anyone is god
strike us down
us..down

if it ever counted.. for anything [2x]
It's solid ground
solid ground

demons wait
drowning in the well
take apart the world
&amp; forge new ground
if anyone is god
strike us down

if it ever counted.. for anything
if it showed you what you found
if it tripped you up
it's..
it's solid ground
solid ground
