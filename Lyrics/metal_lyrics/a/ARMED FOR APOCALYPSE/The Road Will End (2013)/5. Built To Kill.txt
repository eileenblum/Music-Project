Nothing survives
even the tallest mountain dies
&amp; time stands still for no man
(for no man..)

living the lie
black hands, ilourescent sky
these ladders rung is safe for no man
built to kill [2x]
if it leaves you living
the dead inside will haunt you still

we all die with the hands of time
wrapped around our throats
corpses lie in their suits &amp; ties
destitute &amp; broke

don't fool yourself
your safety net has you trapped
your blood is in the water
remember who you're working for

you've come a long way, baby
just step into line
keep pushing
more, more
you're gonna make it one of these days

why are you so negative?
at least you're clocking in
&amp; as the years tick by
remember that you are working toward an end
the end!
Is that a pulse in your throat?
alive [3x]
do you need to speed it up to cope?
alive [3x]

built to kill [2x]
a definition of living
as being merely content
is one with no hope

we all die with the hands of time
wrapped around our throats
corpses lie in their suits &amp; ties
destitute &amp; broke
it's only a matter of time..

don't fool yourself.. 
your blood is in the water
remember who you're working for
