I've got a big problem
with shitting where you eat,
cause it trickles down
&amp; it flows through the streets
like a slave ship
on the way to a sermon
by a clenched fist
with a mouth for a weapon

Oh!
I'm not giving you my A game
It's hard to live when the 
wine is blood
&amp; the love isn't free
all the meat is spolied
&amp; the goal is the disease
not the cure
the starting line is a trip wire

Oh!
I'm not giving you my A game
get it right

the last time
everyone is very impressed
we are very impressed!
everyone is very impressed

good job
I've got a big problem
with fighting for defeat
cause it crashes down
&amp; it tears through the streets
like a wrecking ball
leaving broken foundations
where shattered minds
can build new devastation

Oh!
I'm not giving you my A game
Oh!
I'm not giving you my A game
( A game )

it's the same thing 
in so many different ways
I've got so little to lose..
&amp; everything being demolished to gain
