Causing the living to die
till there is no one to defend!
causing the living to die
till there is no one left to see the end
I've found a better way
to inflict pain
pain.. felt forever

the short term
the bottom line
everyone's best interests
fight to be the last one's alive

I've found a better way!
to seal our fate
I've found a better way!
to hate

an open wound
that continues to spread
until nothing is left
we will feast on our wounds to survive
on the eve of our demise
we will feast on our wounds to survive
until nothing is left
