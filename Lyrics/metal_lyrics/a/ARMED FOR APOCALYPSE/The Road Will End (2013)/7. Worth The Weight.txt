Can't strive
can't stay alive
moving forward with a dead man's stride
&amp; my weakness will thrive
I never ended
&amp; I never began
immolating relics with no inhibition
at the mercy of man

you brought a gun to a fist fight [2x]

I don't need a life rung dry
wilting every day &amp; running out of time
hit the ground falling
&amp; never look back from the dirt in my eyes
nothing survives
even black holes die
long after we've all made the least of our lives
but transience never dies
never dies

you brought a gun to a fist fight
was it worth the weight?

everything is something
&amp; anything is everything
whether you're chasing nothing
or living a lie
when everything is dead
there will be no more empathy 
no more resolve
we were never alive
can't die
can't stay alive
trudging baackward with a dead man's pride
I'll leave nothing behind

you brought a gun.. 
to a fist fight

was it worth the weight? [6x]

I never thought the worst would come
what would it take?
breathing like anew through a shell of mistakes
I made my peace ( I made my peace! )
watching you fall
I made my peace ( I made my peace! )
watching you fall
