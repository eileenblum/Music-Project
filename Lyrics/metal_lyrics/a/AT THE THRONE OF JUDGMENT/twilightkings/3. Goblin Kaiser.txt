I am your Majesty, Acolytes, follow thee, arise from the earth, we are filth and dirt.

The Stench of man, vile, taints our land. Butcher with our dirks, buried in filth and dirt.

From the marsh to the mire, light your torches afire, the human tribe as feed and fodder, sacrifices for Goblin Kaiser.

Trudging through the thicket, Commoner senses wicked. His glove to his sheath, path is foul, soil wreaks. Jagged trees, carved faces, begin to creek, "Beware of the beast, soul is foul, his will wreaks."

A lumbering crag of slag and waste, furrows of corpses in his wake.

From the marsh to the mire, light your torches afire, the human tribe as feed and fodder, sacrifices for Goblin Kaiser.

Fearless tremble, blasted by his axe. Nobility cut down hack by hack. A feast of nobles, headless at the table. Ripped from their barren shoulders to their necks.

From the marsh to the mire, light your torches afire, the human tribe as feed and fodder, sacrifices for Goblin Kaiser.

Goblin Kaiser, " Alas I have sniffed you out. You wreak of man! Greet my biting snout." Commoner, " No it is I, Commoner now King, your demise is my golden sheath. Now great Arcturus, carve him piece by piece."
