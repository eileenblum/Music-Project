Behold! The future is here, and look as all the earthly lands are laid to waste.
The face carved in the bark of the twisted tree, where it has fallen to its knees.
It's an epiphany.
The eyes of the wise majesty open to see the axe in its body..

[Chorus:]
"Falling forth towards the earth, feeling filth and feeling dirt decimating Gaia's reign,
in disdain unified we all came with sharpened blades.
Mater Matris loathes in ruthless pain,
as her gashing wound is ripped again and again.
Defiled by the Hume she lays in languish as she is graced upon by the outrageous".

Into the body, with force to feed the machine, oh how thou hast mocked me.
Behold! The future is here, and look as all the earthly lands are laid to waste.
We are now faced with this treacherous race.
Fueling destruction with such haste.

"I am your life, yet you cut me down like a farce breed,
slaughtered like the steed you once sacrificed with no heed to the casualties.
It will someday breed again."

[Chorus]

Plagues run ramped rotting our bodies until the melting flesh reaches the stem, and it will someday breed again.
