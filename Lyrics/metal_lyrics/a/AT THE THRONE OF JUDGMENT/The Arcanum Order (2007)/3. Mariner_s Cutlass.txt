Like Jason and the Argonauts
It is treasure and plunder that we sought,
in the end it was our destiny as failures to rot in the sea.
Sea faring into the gale we prepare to sail forever ever more on the galley forged by my hands, we are deplored.
The Four winds taunting and the guiding lights amidst embarking on a voyage enshrouded in forbidding mists, clenching our wrists, clenching our fists.

"From the North we hear the calling yet the Cardinal that once flew,
is dashed a strew with it's crimson feathers descending upon the beguiled crew".
"We are a few ... Damned, is it me or is it you?"

Hear my plea maidens of the deep, Ministers of Sedition;
I'll demonstrate this decree, I will throw his body into the seas
(Feasting on his royal flesh with no heed to his "designation"),
we are searching for a prosperous destination.
Destitution is plaguing our realm, but by the mast we are bound.

"Standing, here, before Neptune's bounteous abode,
nautical beings rise from the sea screaming mutiny
"Why do I clench this ivory hilt? This was the vision I once dreamed to build"

Ravishing the commander with thy blade it was I who was saved.
