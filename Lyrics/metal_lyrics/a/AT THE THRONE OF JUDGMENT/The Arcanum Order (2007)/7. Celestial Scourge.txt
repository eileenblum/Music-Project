Truest is thy word that has fallen from the cosmic.
My open arms seem welcome this.
Understanding it seems beyond my mortal logic.
Cascading comets that have spawned from Saros.

"Infernal spheres of chaos plummeting towards the surface.
Where my mind can only comprehend
The impervious delusions of heralding ascension"

With honest traditions...
And intent to assail the masses.
Mavens of illusory sorcery,
Deserving a fate dealt by the victims,
Gorge their appetite for destruction.

"Hideous fiends that resemble the defiled devour all sense of purpose;
Consuming carcasses like vultures after sacrifice in the city of carthage".

Perched on high,
Piercing the skies,
The ravenous Parson scream blasphemous lies.
Forewarning their prey,
Of their dissension of the day that was claimed divine..

"Infernal spheres of chaos plummeting towards the surface.
Where my mind can only comprehend
The impervious delusions of heralding ascension
Hideous fiends that resemble the defiled devour all sense of purpose;
Consuming carcasses like vultures after sacrifice in the city of carthage".

Heed my order o' scavengers of the wounded,
Repulsive wretches be worthy of my final verdict.
Thy scepter rules with sadistic amusement
To those who claim righteous favor,
The taste of flesh...
Let us savor.
