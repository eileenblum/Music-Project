As stories may be told, this dawning in a time of the old,
"Once upon a time there was a man as glorious as the gold;
the essence of the child being raised in the air."
Borrowed powers made this man flourish amongst his peers.
His seared words of sorcery they could not cohere, but in there sleep he whispered,
"Conquest relinquishes fear".
Waking up at morning light, a vile instinct took plight.
Craving battle they began to march.

[Chorus:]
"Atrocious Quest, Crusade on the West;
Obiter Dictum I will say, watch your neck or else they will slay.
Is this life they portray?
Time may pass until that day, but hark the signs that they forbear".

The Bearer of Dawn - imparted the suffering vows of men
upon the cities -and throughout the lands.
A sentinel was bred, the sentinel bled
all for an eternal sunrise that was led saintly man.
Conquest made they will raid with no mercy to the ones who go untouched by dawns light.
As stories may be told, in this beginning is in a time of the old,
"Once upon a time there was a man as glorious as the gold; the essence of the child."

[Chorus]

Conquest made, they will raid with no mercy to the one's that go untouched by the dawns light, and for this blood is insight.
Craving battle they began to march in their sleep, oddly resembling the holy enigma, they were his flock of sheep.
As stories may be told in this time of old they were then gathered... they slaughtered and severed
