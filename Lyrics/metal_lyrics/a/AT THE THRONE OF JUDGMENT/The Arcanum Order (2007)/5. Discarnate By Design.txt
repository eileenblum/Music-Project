For every casket contrived, there was a life prepared for it's abode, but now the ground holds the living...how shall this work?
In the ground, beneath the soil, her feral will to live exceeds her.
As she realizes, in the appalling pastime, she was nothing but a pawn...
A simple murmur amidst the dawn.
The dawn of being...a time for believing.
Oh, how the night reminds me of my shadowed thought...my malicious plot unveiling to me what redemption I had previously lost.

For every casket contrived, there was a life prepared for it's abode, but now the ground holds the living...how shall this work?
A ghost she becomes, without a home.
She is bodiless and doomed.
In the ground, beneath the soil, her feral will to live exceeds her.
As she realizes in this appalling pastime, she was nothing but a pawn...

Remember me, twisted lady?
I hope you regret everything insincere.
As I hammer, try to cohere...your indifference is my motive to make you suffer.
I hope you enjoy this velvet cover...you'll die just like all the others.

A simple murmur amidst the dawn.
The dawn of being...a time for believing.
Oh, how the night reminds me of my shadowed thought...my malicious plot unveiling to me what redemption I had previously lost.
