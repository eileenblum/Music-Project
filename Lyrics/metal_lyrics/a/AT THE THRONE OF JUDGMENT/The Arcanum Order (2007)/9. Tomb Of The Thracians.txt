There is silence:
It is treasured most above the world and in space,
It is an arcane ghost.
Recognize its gorgeous face, untouched by those who have befallen to the hands of hatred.
Welcome to the tombs of the THRACIANS.
Barbaric accords and struggle aboard, "OH BLASPHEMY!!
We cry and it's a blunder undoing this world.
Standing higher that the mountains surrounding our decaying gate we stay true to our cause like the few and honorable would have done to us in this world.

"There is silence:
It is treasured most above the world and in space,
It is an arcane ghost.
Recognize its gorgeous face, untouched by those who have befallen to the hands of hatred".-- walking down the city's streets we collaborate with words of revolution, and not without the words to; the strength to talk in gold.
Cherish whats ours to come,fight for the struggle won, and breath for a united one, as we change the world.
Cherishing the lost assort to the faces that I loathe...cheris what ours to come, fight for the struggle won as we change this world without one gun.
