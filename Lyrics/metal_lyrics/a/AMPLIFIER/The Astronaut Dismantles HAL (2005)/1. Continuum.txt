The cushioned throbbing of a velvet moon. 
And the pregnant aching of an empty womb.
The endless echoes of the noise we made.
And the repercussions of each hand grenade.

There's aeroplanes and dragonflies. And infinite September skies.
There's anthems of utopia's. And creeping wars and glaciers.

Just listen... Just listen... Yeah!

Is there music in there?

Arrived within the creeping hearse. Vibrations from the universe.
Awash with the glittering of city lights.
The mouse choir whispered through the endless nights.

And all alone to ride upon the froth. The human dreamt of taking off.
Eventually, time corrodes the brain to rust. 
And all those dreams into diamond dust.

Just listen... Violins and orchestras.
For death and speculation, well there's just enough time.
Well there's just enough time.

We've got just enough time...

I felt the closeness of monsters as we slept.
And the creaking of hands where masons met.
The loneliness of a shooting star.
And the beating of drums where the wild things are.

And somewhere beneath the moon. A sonic boom, peeled off from a wing.
Into the dark, into each heart.
I heard the angel sing: "Que sera sera - Whatever will be will be"

And for death and speculation, well there's just enough time.
For each final separation, well there's just enough time.

Away on the breeze. My evanescent memories.
Well I can feel them, but I can't remember them.
Well I can feel them, slipping away... Slipping away...
