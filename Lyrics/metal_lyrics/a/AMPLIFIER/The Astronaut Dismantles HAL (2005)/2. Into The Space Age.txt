Voiding murder and it's pitfalls. Into the space age on a comedown.

Been evolving into some other creature. 
Inside the birdcage - not got much flying done.

And I'm sinking dark and joyous. In devastating loneliness.
In the precision of existence. Well a man needs guidance.
Keep me safe in your arms. Keep me free from tyranny.
Descending somewhere into the space age. Where no man has gone before.

(And it's all gone, went too far.)

Disappointed in the outcome. Just whatever was I expecting?

And I'm sinking into deepest heaven. In all consuming isolation.
In the decision of existence. Well should a man choose silence?
Keep me safe in your arms. Keep me free from tyranny.
Descending somewhere into the space age. Where no man has gone before.
