Been giving me remote control. Pick up the telephone - Hail Mary.
I feel like I could shoot the moon. My bliss cut and dirty.

Anyone can drown swimming round my head. Slipping over the precipice.
Stepping off of with the edge. Aware that the body had died.
"I'm in here", she cried! "I'm human inside. I'm human inside"
"Can't anyone hear me?". "Can't anyone hear me?".

And that's one year less I guess. I'm booming out of the other side.
Now that I'm frozen like a crystal ice age. In a cadence of harpsichords.
Well I heard the raindrops fall.

Anyone can drown swimming round my head. Slipping over the precipice.
Stepping off of the edge. Aware that the body had died.
"I'm in here", she cried! "I'm human inside". 
"I'm human inside - Can't anyone heal me?". "Can't anyone heal me?".
"Can't anyone heal me?". "Well, Can't anyone heal?". Oh, yeah.
