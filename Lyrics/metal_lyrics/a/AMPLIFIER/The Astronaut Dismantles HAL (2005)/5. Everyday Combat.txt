No shiny gold. No jewelled eye. Fighting the man!
I pressed the controls and rockets blazed through the sky.
Fighting the man!

Whose pretty feet are clad in Ruby Shoes? Fighting the man!
These human bones, already obsolete. Fighting the man!

All the way to the bitter end. All the way to the bitter end.

Avoid the tears of something unforeseen. Fighting the man!
Expanding techniques of this prosthetic brain. Fighting the man!
Well, we'll get away from it all. Down amongst the drones.
Fighting the man! Alive after wave upon wave of galaxians that fall. 
Fighting the man!

All the way to the bitter end. All the way to the bitter end.

O Happy Days! Of debt and life support. Fighting the man!
A soul will grow old and eventually will fold. Fighting the man!
