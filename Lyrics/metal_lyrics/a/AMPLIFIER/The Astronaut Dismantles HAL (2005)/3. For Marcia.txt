In the cold glare of a coke machine. 
And in the pulse of the droning stars.
In the slow swelling of the sea. Well, what can you hear?
What can you hear? What can you hear?

But who's that tapping on my shoulder?
Who's that tapping on my shoulder? 
You're tapping on my shoulder. Tapping on my shoulder.

You're in the dust falling from the moon. 
And in the crack of a sandy dune.
You reach down - and pull me through.
To where our feet need not touch the ground.
And just like me and just like you.
Just like you. Just like you. Just like you.

Some things can never be. Some things can never be.
Some things can never be. Some things can never be.
Well, some things can never be. Who's that tapping on my shoulder? 
Some things can never be. Who's that tapping on my shoulder? 
Some things can never be. Who's that tapping on my shoulder? 
Some things can never be. Who's that tapping on my shoulder?
