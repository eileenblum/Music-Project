In the sinews of eternity
that fortune spins
entwined within the DNA
that throbs beneath its skin

you'll fit so perfectly in
I'll never let you go
I'll never let you go

well, I dressed you in your uniform
you'll understand
right from the moment you were born
a minion at my command

and when you hold my hand
I'll never let you go
from my arms
I'll never let you go

on a drip feed of euphoria
that's laid to waste
and feeding on the emptiness
abiding in the human race

and when we embrace
I'll never let you go
from my arms
I'll never let you go

and once you hold my hand
I'll never let you go
from my arms
I'll never let you go
