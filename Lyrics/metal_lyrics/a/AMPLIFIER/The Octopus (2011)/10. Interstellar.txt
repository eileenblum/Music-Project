Gonna take a trip to a distant sun
And leave this planet far behind
And travel the road to kingdom come
Got a universe to sail across and across, now weâve just begun
Now weâve just begun

And stretching out ahead of me
Promised to eternal skies
To travel distant galaxies
Got a universe to sail across and across, like a jet black sea

Travelling faster than light
Travelling faster than light
Faster than light
Is the only way to be
Is the only way to be

Weâll go somewhere you may have been
Kick the engine to overdrive
Run faster than a laser beam
Got a universe to sail across and across, âtill the day I die
And riding high
âCause Iâve got a universe to sail across and across, âtill the day I die

Travelling faster than light
Travelling faster than light
Faster than light
Travelling faster than light
Faster than light
Travelling faster than light
Faster than light
Is the only way to be
Is the only way to be

Travelling faster than light
Travelling faster than light
Is the only way to be
And the only possibility
To be truly free

Well, I know that you seek the control for the heart and the soul
