"Ladies and gentlemen, please step right up, for the end of the world!"

Climb aboard the wave, to somewhere you ain't never been
and in a world of make believe, I'm the emperor and champion
of sheer suicide! of sheer suicide!

Hear me when I say that I was brought to life upon the wave
Iâm gonna hitch a ride and see what I can see
I'm gonna climb inside of the time machine
Into another dimension! To another dimension!

Into another dimension, another dimension
Into another dimension, another dimension
Into another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension

From the first to the last, well, the wave is waiting
For the rubies and diamonds that are slipping through your fingers
in the glinting of an eye, Iâm just a thought vibrating
and Iâm riding on high now that the wave is breaking
now that the futureâs waiting

I'm gonna step inside and take a ride

Into another dimension, another dimension
Into another dimension, another dimension
Into another dimension, another dimension
Another dimension, another dimension

Oh yeah, yeah!
Oh yeah, yeah!
