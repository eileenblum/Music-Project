Oh masters of the universe
won't you please reveal
secrets of The Octopus
inside me which I feel

Clawing, clawing, who's been waiting
at my door forever patiently
upon the lips of your incarnation
who is the man to sing me a melody

Spin me a remedy

In homage of your industry
in debt with each huzzah
thatâs paid in its entirety
with teardrops from the stars

Well, catch them, catch them, holy waters
soothe the brows of jet set troubles
that set the feet of every martyr
upon the road of fame and paradise
Forward, forward, not forsaken
are you the man to fuck with the enemy
Show me gold and show me favour
crown a man of humble origins

Whoâs adept at fitting in
from beneath unholy skin

We'll sing along to the minion's song
Emerging from the jaws of each lion
Threading on in a far constellation
Riding away on the waves of oblivion

Sing along to the minion's song
Emerging from the jaws of each lion
Threading on in a far constellation
Riding away on the waves of oblivion

Sing along to the minion's song
Emerging from the jaws of each lion
Threading on in a far constellation
Riding away on the waves of oblivion
Oblivion
Oblivion
Oblivion
Oblivion...
