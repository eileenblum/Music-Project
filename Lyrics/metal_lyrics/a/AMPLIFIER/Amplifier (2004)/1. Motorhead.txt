I sleep deeply every night 
In a world that's better than real life.
I found a hiding place, 
Beneath a dirty blanket of distorted bass.

And there's music in my head, 
I heard a gasoline voiced mixed with Marlboro reds singing:
"Pick up your head again
If you want to be king, no one must keep you down..."

And yes now I'm back from the dead, 
I'm gonna turn it up loud inside your head.
With the sound of many days, 
when we could feel the cheap drugs squeezing through our veins.

Like a million girls and boys, 
I'm just another grainy brick in a wall of noise.
I really missed you yesterday, 
Well and just for a moment something was reeling me in.

Yes, something was reeling me in. 
Well someone was breathing me in. 
Someone was breathing me in. 
Well

Yeah, but I lived in the slip of your frown. 
And this place has been getting me down.

Yeah, but you hung out for my suicide. 
You were pushing it down the air supply.
But you never did try to find the time 
To let us be together in your cage or mine.

And since you never noticed me, 
Well how's about you open up your eyes and see me.
Now music fills my empty bones, 
Well and some times it seems it's the only place I've left to go.

Ah hey hey hey
Ah hey hey hey
Mhh yeah yeah yeah
Happy Birthday anyway!
