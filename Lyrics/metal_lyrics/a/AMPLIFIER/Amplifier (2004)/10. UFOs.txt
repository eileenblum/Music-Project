Well haven't you heard the news from outer space? 
It seems that somewhere in the ancient dunes.
Of silver moons, like giant spoons lie dusty tombs.
Of Martian men in U-boat pens... 
And they will come to kill us all. 

'Cause our plastic factories and our catastrophic theories.
Are all we have, we live our lives from paper bags. 
And I know better than you know 
I'll kill you 'cause you drive too slow! 
Aggressive instincts will do us in, yeah... 
Just give us the chance for us to prove it ourselves. 

Don't you know that all machines sink? 
Do you know they sing as they think? 
Although their bodies are electric... 
Don't you know that all machines sink?

Don't you know that all machines sink? 
Do you know they sing as they think? 
Although their bodies are electric... 
Don't you know that all machines sink? Yeah...

We are waiting for you here... 
We are waiting for you here... 
We are waiting for you here... 

So we laid back and we watched space revolve. 
The bodies of astronauts long cold.
Blinking like lonely satellites
Where we left vapour trails through cotton skies
Come on, let's scratch the heavens one last time! 

'Cause we're all sinking in the sunshine, 
Though you'd love to stay.
Well, you said you must be on your way 
To where the rainbows and UFOs.
Fall ten at a time. 
In a shower of glitter and gold
We'll all be waiting for you here
