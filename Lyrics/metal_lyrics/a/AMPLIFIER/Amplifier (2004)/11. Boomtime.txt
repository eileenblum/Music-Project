[Bonus EP Track]Boomtime coming. Man the monkey. In the cradle.
In the graveyard. Sky is soaring. Lungs are burning.
Roller-coaster. Rolls forever.

A high time rolling, like the ocean.
Hands more loving, than a plastic surgeon.
Young and scrawny. In the fun house.
And lord almighty. Devil knows just what I've been doing.

And there's a chance, that it could all come down.
And there's a chance, there's a chance. Leave me reaching for the sun.
Leave me reaching for the sun. And this could be the perfect one.
And this could be the perfect one. And this could be the perfect one.
And this could be the perfect one.

When tenderness is far away. Keep me safe for another day.

I've been under. Heavy weather. I'll be armed and ready.
In the future. Boomtime coming. Now I'm up and running.
No-one's gonna live forever.

And there's a chance, that it could all come down.
And there's a chance, there's a chance. Leave me reaching for the sun.
Leave me reaching for the sun. And this could be the perfect one.
And this could be the perfect one. And this could be the perfect one.
And this could be the perfect one. And this could be the perfect one.
And this could be the perfect one. And this could be the perfect one.
