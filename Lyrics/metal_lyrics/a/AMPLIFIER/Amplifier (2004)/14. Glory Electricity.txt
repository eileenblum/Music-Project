[Bonus EP Track]Beneath the electrically empowered sun.
Well I've been rolling down the assembly line.
And I've been stuck in flesh for far too long.
And flowing free's been on my mind.
Just like an electric shock. Just like an electric shock.
Shock, shock, shock, shock, shock.

Become a rainbow one hundred foot tall.
Just flick a switch to turn it on.
Be my metallic and conductive girl.
And we'd be like colours that the heavens spun.
As we sang along. As we sang along. 'Cause you've got me.

Glory! Glory! Glory!
Glory! Glory!

And you're so uplifting. This feeling that you're giving me.
Is pure acceleration. Some kind of chemistry.
Whatever's washing over me, is pure intoxication.
And you're pure acceleration. So let's raise hands and rejoice!
Like electricity, you are my remedy. You are my remedy.

Now that I'm polarised - 240 Volts.
Yes I'm black and white on a cinema screen.
I'm so energised I'm gonna burst.
But you've gotta charge me first.
You've gotta charge me first.

Well... Glory electricity the way you shower me. The way you shower me.
Well... Glory electricity the way you power me. The way you power me.

Glory! Glory!
Glory! Glory! Glory!
Yes you've got me!

And you're so uplifting. This feeling that you're giving me.
Is pure acceleration. Some kind of chemistry.
Whatever's washing over me, is pure intoxication.
And you're pure acceleration. So let's raise hands and rejoice!
Like electricity, you are my remedy. You are my remedy.
You are my remedy. You are my remedy.

Some pure interpretation. Some pure detonation.
