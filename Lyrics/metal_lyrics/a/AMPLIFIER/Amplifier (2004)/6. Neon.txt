My spider sense is tingling.
From the boys and the girls and the vortex sing.
Just a second to hang upon my ears.
Just a second to taste the salty tears.
Judge not least you may be judged.

Judge not least you may be judged.
Judged by me, 
Judged by me.
Least you may be 
Destroyed by me.

Trouble come down on shoulders quick.
And put a hymn of neon upon my lips.
Now I'm spiralling into the void.
My atoms split as love's reward.
For the ten percent that I can't afford.
Well maybe I'd fly free as a bird.

Judge not least you may be judged.
Judge not least you may be
Judged by me, 
Judged by me.
Least you may be 
Destroyed by me.

And without sleep, without remorse.
Well, we're stuck on head-collision course.
But my plate's already full,
Of selfish people with selfish desires.
And don't climb so high 
That you can't come down.
To tumble now is to surely die.

Judge not least you may be judged.
Least you may be 
Judged by me.
Judged by me. 
Least you may be 
Loved by me, by me.

Judge not least you may be judged.
Judge not least you may be judged.
Least you may be judged.
Least you may be judged.
Least you may be judged.
Least you may be loved.
