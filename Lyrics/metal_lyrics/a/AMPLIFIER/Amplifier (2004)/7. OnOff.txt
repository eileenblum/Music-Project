Flicker television. 
Like something that is breathing.
I'm dead in bubblegum 
And wishing you were here.

You're where the rain doesn't pour, 
It just floods down.
But in the places where the insects die.
In the blinking of an eye, we'll be. 
We'll be.

Switching on and off, on/off. 
Switching on and off, on/off.
Switching on and off, on/off.
Switching off, on/off. 

Don't you know we'll be. 
Don't you know we'll be? Yeah, yeah.

Watching all the ash fall. 
It's just like cigarette snow.
And when I'm stoned
I'm missing you my dear.

And then the light, 
Yeah, well it's telling me that I'm alive.
It's telling me that I'm alive. 
And you know that I'll be. 
I'll be with you. 
I'll be with you.

Switching on and off, on/off.
Switching on and off, on yeah
Switching on and off, on/off. 
Yes I'll be. 
Switching on and off, on/off.
You know we'll be. 
Switching on and off, on/off.
You know we'll be, be, be, be

Don't you know, we'll be.
You know that we'll be. Oh oh oh. 
Don't you know we'll be? Oh oh oh.
You know that we'll be! Oh oh oh...
