Drugged a million words, just like ourselves.
Formed a straight line, plucking at sound-waves.
And oh, for no-one ever. 
Darkest singing.
The days of tripping 
Upon snakes are over now.

Do you feel empty now? 
Do you feel empty now, 
Inside?
Do you feel empty now 
Inside the fascist city?
Empty now? 
Inside...

And I'm thinking of euphoria. 
Spiked on golden splinters.
With the church of relativity 
All under my fingers.

Head up into the bluest skies. 
Stuck in the glue with the dying flies.
Inside the vapour you were grown.
In the LSD of the speaker cone.

Been given the cobwebs to blow away.
Been celebrating each wasted day.
In unconditional luxury.
Comatose, living life in a sugar cube.

Do you feel pleasure now?
Do you feel pleasure now 
Inside the fascist body?
Pleaser now
Inside...

Post-acid youth, post-acid youth
Post-acid youth, post-acid youth
Post-acid youth, post-acid youth

Dumb and hooked on fossil fuels. 
A gorged generation.
Speckled and smackey. 
Singing Prozac is golden.

Escaped the prison they called the head.
And glittered the bones of the young and dead.
On big Imperial chemistry. 
Elastic, dumb and vulnerable.

But somewhere down south
You're where the birds are singing.
You'll hear the barbed wire doves 
Of a million mothers.

Is there fulfilment now? 
Is there fulfilment now 
Inside the fascist psyche?
The fascist psyche. 
Bring us fulfilment now. 
Inside.

Post-acid youth, post-acid youth
Post-acid youth, post-acid youth
Post-acid youth, post-acid youth
