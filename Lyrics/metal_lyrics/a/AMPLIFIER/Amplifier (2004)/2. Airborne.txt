I'd call it a drastic measure, 
But I'll open up one eye.
I'm all evolved and fully grown, 
With three dimensions of my own.

Hey Mr. Dog
Well I'm just an animal just like you.
In a laser beam and a human being. Yeah.
With more fire than the belly of the sun.
Than the belly of the sun

And inside this business of the gun, 
Well I heard the aero-engines whine.
Of a lucky soul and an afterlife 
And another chance for a darker life.

And I pray, cause it don't take god long 
To bless those feet that you're standing on.
On a one way ride, a heaven vibe, 
Upon wishes or demands. 
It's time to fly!
It's time to fly! 
It's time. 
Fly!

And I'm suffering the absolute 
Of black-handed days.
Been serving with the boys and girls, 
All the secret rulers of the world.

And dark day alive, 
Well once again evil on the throne.
Hearts blacker than the setting sun. 
I'm hung upon dark feathers.

It's time to fly. 
It's time to fly. 
It's time to fly. 
It's time to fly.

But know that I'm hanging in there
With intentions so high.
That they're purer than air 
And what I've got on my mind now.

Is to be cruising on you 
To be full-on on you.
To be swooping on you. 
To be airborne on you. 
Airborne on 
To be carried along.
On a current so strong. 
I'd be glowing from you. 

I'd be glowing from you. 
Glowing from you. 
Glowing!

I'd be glowing from you. 
Glowing from you. 
Glowing!

So go on, on,
Go on and prove me wrong!
