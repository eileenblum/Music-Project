Me and monster man come crashing on down.
Like an avalanche caused by a tiny sound.
And we've been stuck in here for what seems an age.
There's too many rhinos for just one cage. 
So wash me away.

I feel a ride coming on like a car crash.
I feel a ride coming on, coming on.

A consultancy with me here 
And I'll listen to what they recommend.
Taken away on a holiday, 
Where everyday is like a weekend.

There's a means to whatever the situation. 
A bullet to trigger my imagination.
In concentration, or toxification. 
A mountain of juggernaut, 
Would come tumbling down.

Do you feel the ride coming on like a car crash?
Do you feel the ride coming on, carrying you away?
Do you feel the ride coming on like a car crash?

And now step into the unknown. 
Here for just one second... 
And then gone!

Me and my friends been singing this song.
So we're all gonna burn when the devil get home.
Just give us the means to bring it on.
And if you lift up your head, well what would you see?
Maybe the glint of the sun in an approaching tsunami.
In elevation, or consultation. 
A mountain of juggernaut, 
Would come tumbling down.

Come tumbling down. 
Come tumbling down. 
It's a mountain of juggernaut. 
Would come tumbling down.
It's a mountain of juggernaut. 
We'll we all come tumbling down.
We all come tumbling down... down.
