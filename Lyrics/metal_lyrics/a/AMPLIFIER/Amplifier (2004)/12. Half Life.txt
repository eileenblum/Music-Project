[Bonus EP Track]Woke up with a hard-on
Head full of distortion
Condition returning
Verdict never learning

Is it late in the evening?
Or early in the morning?
Is it late in the evening?
Or early in the morning, morning?

Disorientation
Like the sound of a gunshot
New modifications
To the buzzing of a chainsaw

Sleeping through the daytime
Working through the night time
Sleeping through the daytime
Working through the night time, night time

Laces tied
Wings pumped up with blood
But who keeps bleeding me dry?
Each and everyday
Face the world or take the asp

Been living upon a dirty guitar
Can't you taste my incoherence?
Today is not the same as yesterday -
And I've been on the trail
Been on that trail

Been on that trail
For months and months now
For months and months now
For months and months now

Each moment a crossroads
You'd better be careful
To the left is Jesus
To the right The Devil singing:

Half a life to enjoy it
Half a life to regret it
Half a life to enjoy it
Half a life to regret it, gret it
