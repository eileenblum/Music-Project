Slip coma deep inside an industrialist's mind
Pour yourself into the creased appeal of a financeman's suit
You keep on exchanging handshakes and smiles
With chat show hosts like butterflies
Fly down and hide in the zeros and the ones
And let's all sing

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
The missile can fly
Decode the cypher
The cryptic message within a government health warning
And it's the same, 
It's the same
Same song everytime
Oh no! Your big mushroom cloud
It's gone and it's fucked up my view

Don't matter which way we're facing
So long as we're rolling forward
It don't matter which way we're facing
So long as we're rolling forward
Here we go, here we go, here we go

Well we could seek a world of jackpots
And corportate value, yeah
And learn to leave our ugly selves behind
You've got to feel the power as it flows
From businessmen and mother lodes
Become a soul of pure caffeine
Live life like a coke machine, yeah

Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Praise god for hollywood teeth
Crash your karma into little bits of happiness
Now it's okay, 
It's okay
I know a quick and easy way
We ain't divine, we've all got our faults
Seismic minds think seismic sized thoughts

Don't matter which way we're facing
You'd better look out below
Relentless without ever tiring
We're gonna keep rolling forward
Here we go, here we go, here we go

Here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go

Mister executive man
Pick your way through the debris
Lubricate your gun
Between the devil and the sea
Sleeping solvent and sound
And ethically free
Right upon my back
A panzer running over me
When I had my hands in the air
Invoice me
And then your mother

Don't matter which way we're facing
You'd better look out below
Relentless without ever tiring
We're gonna keep rolling forward
Here we go, here we go, here we go
