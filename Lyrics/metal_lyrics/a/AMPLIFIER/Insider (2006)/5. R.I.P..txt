Only luck keeps us out of the coffin
Mistakes can be fatal
This state of affairs is complex and dangerous
Just who is a friend and who is an enemy?

Oh, anaesthetist!
You are the servant delving into my mind

Iâd be high above the mountaintops
Iâd be deep beneath the ocean blue
Iâd be far across the universe
Dripping in ecstasy

The illusionist has made the box empty
But what is a certainty?
Now enter the surgeon
To cut out you dignity

Oh, anaesthetist!
You are the servant delving into my mind

Iâd be high above the mountaintops
Iâd be deep beneath the ocean blue
Iâd be faster than the human eye
Iâd be diving through and endless swoon
Faraway across the universe to rest in peace
