Iâll shield my face for you are my master
Here in the glow of each glorious sunbeam
Into the blue, up into the blue
Keep me alive here

So look to the East with each breaking morning
And look to the West with each sunset descending
Into the blue, up into the blue
Well some days you win and some days you lose

Ascending
Well the sun shines holy

So do unto me, for I am your servant
Burning my skin in each molten rapture
Into the blue, up into the blue
Where death holds no fear

Ascending
Well the sun shines holy
