The certainty that I am me and that there is everything that I can see
That what I perceive is all it appears and the belief that I am even here
Itâs all in my mind

Into an ocean I am cast between the past and all things that will come to be
If every choice I make is my own inside the unknown
Then how can there be destiny?
Itâs all in my mind

In every moment I dismiss and every metamorphosis
For from a bud the flowers bloom
A butterfly from each cocoon
Itâs all inside
