With your permission
Escaped this perdition
Each line and division is to define you
To confine you

A fleeting recollection of someone Iâd forgotten
A split second impression of a safe place
Of a kind race

Designed Eden without a care
Come emancipation
I would take you anywhere

Gracious steps lead me up into the heavens of reconciliations
These mountains and chasms
These jungles and oceans with trespass forgiven
And sunbeams that are golden
With no hate or religion
Just each other to discover

Designed Eden without a care
Come emancipation
I would take you anywhere
Arrived and vanished into air
Come disintegration
Where would you be waiting?

With my head on the pillow
As sails billow
The ground is hollow in every gladness
In every sadness
