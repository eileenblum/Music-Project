Caught as you are in the trouble and strife
Best make what you can of this mortal life
Well some people make things and others destroy things

Beware when dangers slips in of damage adventures will bring
For life is a hazardous thing that slowly seeps under your skin
And causes you being to sting

Well the fickles of providence will or they wonât
But youâre damned if you do and youâre damned if you donât
Some people will love you and other will hate you

Never heed what doubters say
Your instinct will show you the way
In times when you wander and stray
No master for you to obey
Save dying for some other day

Well the spoils of friendship are bitter and sweet
So take a good look at the council you keep
For some people will aid you while others will fight you

But what do you really know?
Just into which battle dâyou go?
Examine your own shadow
Your adversity it mat show
As clear as the horns that you`ll grow
