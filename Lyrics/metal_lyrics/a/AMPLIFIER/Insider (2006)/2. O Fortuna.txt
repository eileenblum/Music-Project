O Fortuna!
Am I but your clockwork hero?
From here in the last ditch
Toe to toe, blow for blow
You are the enigma
Well, nevermind...
The futureâs already happened
And there is always someone left to fight
To the death...
With every breath inside this body
My dreams are whatâs keeping me alive!

And it is wise to be careful
When the animal shows no fear
Puny human â you are no match for me
For things are never as they appear
As they appear

Well, Iâve been freed from the ropes that bind
Now who is the puppet master?
Dishing out an eye for an eye, spitting teeth
Well, youâll never take me alive
O Fortuna!
Am I alone in this darkness we call redemption?
Well I could not change you
No more than I could change my shadow
No more than I could fly to the moon

Puny human
You are no match for me
For things are never quite just what they seem to be
