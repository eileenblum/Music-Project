What was held by these weary hands that have been harvesting
Where brave souls grew tall in endless fields of gold that whispered in the breeze
Hallowed were thy birds in trees
We marveled at the skies with wonder in our eyes and summerâs butterflies
Enchanted in each gilded August
Embraced where swallows chased the sun
They wove a complex fugue where wild flowers bloomed only in your name
Where no two days were quite the same
But if you close your eyes the past is never lost

Well I would hold your hand when you are vulnerable and alone
And wherever dangers roam I would keep you safe from harm
Through those valleys of shadows beyond lagoons of pink flamingos
Beyond rainbows we became, where music falls as rain
It falls to ease the pain where memories remain
Upon a kiss of tenderness
Into the sky from out of each abyss
Ascending to the depths of purest azure bliss
Where we would never have to say goodbye
And there would never be a tear to cry
Where I would be with you forever by your side
Where I would be with you until the end of time
Until the end of time
