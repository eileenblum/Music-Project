From beyond a ghostly place
A magic spell is never seen
Some things are incomprehensible
Some things are simply inexpressible

In each series of events
Entwines the fabric of relationships
All things are just a consequence
All things are more than just coincidence

Prising upon a hidden meaning
At the heart of a paradox
Of somewhere transiently tangible
Of somewhere eternally ephemeral

Disturbance will be where there is energy
Something that we couldnât see
One part a dream and one part reality
