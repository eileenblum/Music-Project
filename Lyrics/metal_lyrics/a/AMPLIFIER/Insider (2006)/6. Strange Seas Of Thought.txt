Upon strange seas of thought
Upon thoughts of strange seas
Iâm gonna go where I please
Upon strange seas of thought
Iâm making my way into the waiting day

Is there anybody out there?
Where the sky is like the ocean

Where the thunderclouds are endless and are waiting to fall
On abstract tangents I am riding on strange seas of thought
Where perplexion is a spider web, a sphinx suspended on a thread
Donât lose control of who you are upon strange seas of thought
Out there upon meadows of green Iâll be lying on mountains of dreams

Iâll be climbing
Upon secrets untold
Upon treasures of gold
I`ll be finding

Is there anybody out there?
Where the sea is like the heavens
