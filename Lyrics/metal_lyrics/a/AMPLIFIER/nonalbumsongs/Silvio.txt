Well I'll tell you a story
Of an arrogant man
And the contract with Hades
The promise of all of the world
For just one son

He came lord and master
Yet a slave to temptation
Chose to add the rule
Turned his back upon the heavens
To condemn every day turned out his soul

When the forces come to overcome
Well do not try to touch the sun or you'll burn
When will you ever learn
That price of admission is high
And every commitment once made always get paid

You get what you deserve, get what you deserve
Get what you deserve, get what you deserve, get what you deserve
You get what you deserve, get what you deserve
Get what you deserve, get what you deserve, get what you deserve

You get what you deserve

Call your lawyer and doctor
But they will not save you
Remorseful at last
As judgment is passed
Into the fire you're cast
Forever and ever

When the forces come to overcome
Well do not try to touch the sun or you'll burn
Oh, just when will you ever learn
That the the price of permission is high
And every arrangement that's made always gets paid

List to me and this looks good
Higher thoughts that never been
