Hey brother meet me at the room, don't reverse the night sky.
Beneath the black gnawed project wings of crows with artificial eyes.
Think that we could see much further, walking three foot of the ground.
We could learn to live between all of the secrets that we found, before it's all gone.
Before it's all gone. Before it's all gone. Before it's all gone. Before it's all gone.

Hey sister, somewhere in the sun, you know this place of end used dreams.
It's just the stones thrown from easy street and the rawleight limousines.
Where people pass a steel doorway, never knowing we were there.
You know we don't need paradise, where we found god inside of air. We must stay strong.
We will stay strong. We won't remain young. And we must stay strong.

But I can't feel the city seat beneath the claw.
Spinning the sirens in a gentle pulse of blue.
Sometimes when the land is terrified.
This is where we work. Yes this where we work. This is where we work.

The dark secrets of a hidden room at 3 a.m.
The threat of physical collapse is now very real.
And god help us all, we're going way too chemical.
When your living at a hundred miles an hour.
Soul of bird must learn to fly.

We're picking up on neat vibrations, we even don't need to try.
We're all the washed with strange sensations, come on and let us liquefy
I need your reassuringness. I'm just oblivion boy.
There were times I lost my mind, within the screaming wall of noise.
Before I found you. That's where I found you.

So brother hold on to my hand, feel I'm afraid that you might fall.
You're just a pattern of man, laid down with atom of soul.
You can put your faith in me, 'cause I don't care what you've been told.
Just watch a shooting stars, and they fall to the great ocean row below there.

Through the mounts of kings and goats appalled by the electric fence
Through the sun and the moon and the terror of the thunder cloud. I'll fly you away.
Through the Indian maze wind calls upon the lips and the sun.
Well you can let me be the conduit, and I'll free you today.

But I can't feel the city seat beneath the claw.
Spinning the sirens in a gentle pulse of blue.
Sometimes when the land is terrified.
This is where we work. Yes this where we work. This is where we work.

The dark secrets of a hidden room at 3 a.m.
The threat of physical collapse is now very real.
And god help us all, we're going way too chemical.
When your living at a hundred miles an hour.
Soul of bird must learn to fly.

The soul of bird must learn to fly.
The soul of bird must learn to fly.
The soul of bird must learn to fly.
