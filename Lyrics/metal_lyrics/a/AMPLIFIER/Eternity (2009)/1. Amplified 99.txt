Shrink the black holes under your eyes
I can tell you're all surprised
So don't delay 'cause now's the time
It's amplified and it's '99

Come on and flex the speaker
Come on spread rusty string
Come vibrate white finger
Eleven late from eighty eight, here we go

When everything's doing you in
Then we're flying, oh my
To where the clouds swirl like big psychedelic squirrels
That lived in the sky

So turn up your radio
And give us all somewhere to go
Cause this is love, baby
Give us some love

Then pray

You gotta let yourself go
Come on and let yourself go
Hey, you gotta let yourself go
Come on and let yourself go
You gotta let yourself go
Hey, cut yourself free

And those four walls
Are gonna drop like a plane from the sky
Like a tear from your eye

There's no need to cry
No need to cry

Well we're feeling good, so here's the plan
Let's ride the sunshine while we can
Drop the wings and learn to fly
It's amplified and it's '99

Come great fuzzy speaker
Come on reverberate the spring
Come on let's make the ever great
Come on and climb on in

You gotta let yourself go
Come on and let yourself go
You gotta let yourself go
Come on and let yourself go
You gotta let yourself go
Come on and let yourself go
Hey, let yourself go
You gotta let yourself go
Let's go

And why don't you just collide on in the earth?

Cause it's amplified
And 99
You're so sublime
Well it's super fine
So super fine
