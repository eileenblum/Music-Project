Waiting here in the departure lounge, won't be long before I'm leaving.
And in the instant that the world stood still, I melted into gas to float away.

I'll come back stronger than before, soaking the sun array.
Collecting little shots of happiness, a million years of sleep, again.

But I can't remember what we were, what we once might have been somewhere else.
We spun glitter balls and lover's dance, the flowers bloomed and time collapsed.

And I'm trapped within the cloud of bliss, in control yet powerless.
Within my head I hear a reverberation, the sound of Bowie on a jukebox.

And who could blame us for wanting to talk with the gods?
The ringing bells of flooded cathedrals, will sound for you.

And moments lost in time like tears in rain, left me clutching photographs 
from the ramparts of a sleepy coastal citadel in Spain, I saluted you. 

And you hear...

Under faraway moons. Human flotsam dream and sleeping bags. 
Big, where the ocean is blue, it's a perfect place to find yourself. 

So I'm looking for freaks to burn out stars with. 
Searching for misfits to get lost with. 
Waiting for souls to find my own with. 
Holding out for strangers whom I can dream with. 
And I'll be digging for friends to lose my mind with. 
'Cause I'm looking for freaks to burn out stars with.
I'm looking for freaks to burn out stars with. 

To burn out stars with...
To burn out stars with...
