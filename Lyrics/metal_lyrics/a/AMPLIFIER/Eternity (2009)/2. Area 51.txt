Imagine the gig, that we could have at area 51. Oh my word. Oh my word.

Imagine the freaks we'd have in the audience at area 51. Check out who's standing next to you.

Just imagine the sound of the music we'd make conceive of the drugs we'd take in area 51.
Imagine the size of the amps to be found, one billions watts of sound.
Such an auspicious event, yet so classified, loving it. 
To the party we throw, see you all at the after show at area 51.

Area 51. 

Thinking of the yellow dot planets of lennox on right. 
They'd have to worthy of seeing or dying.
And we all sing along as the words come undone.
Summon lips of all nations terrestrial tongue.
And oh Jesus Christ, don't the road crew look strange
Just wait till you see guest stars we've arranged.
All our guests prepare, they're be relics instead
When we play in area 51

Imagine the sound of the music we'd make conceive of the drugs we'd take in area 51.
Imagine the size of the amps to be found, one billions watts of sound.
Such an auspicious event, yet so classified, loving it. 
To the party we throw, see you all at the after show at area 51.

Area 51. 51. Area 51. In area 51. 

Area 51...
