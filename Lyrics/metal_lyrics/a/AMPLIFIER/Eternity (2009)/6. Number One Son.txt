It's all about balance. It's all bout discipline.
It's all about silence. It's all about listening.

So keep your head down, number one son.
Your time will come, number one son.

It's all about focus. It's all about simplicity.
It's all about practice. And it's all about subtlety.

So keep your head down, down, number one son.
Your time will come, come, number one son.

Made yourself empty, let them fill you up.

'Cause you put the cobs right into my mouth.
And you were the air bag to cushion my fall.
'Cause you put the rods right under my hands.
And you put the armour around my soul. 

Around my soul. Around my soul. Around my soul. 
Around my soul. Around my soul. Around my soul. 
Around my soul. Around my soul. Around my soul. 
Around my soul...

It's all about balance... discipline.
