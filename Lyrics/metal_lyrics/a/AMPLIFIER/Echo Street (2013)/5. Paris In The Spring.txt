Come let the spires all sing
Go reach for the star
And see what you find
My bold and ambitious young fool
The dawn of the trouble you'll bring
{I knew at the} scene yesterday
Found your corner of the sky
Run free alive
God bless the US of A
Well that's what they all seem to say
When victory has long gone
The lie is still waiting
The ribbons and trophies {and}
lazy days under the sun
The dreams that have yet to become
And all of those songs you've not yet sung
So come
Walk with me down streets of rain
Long gone
The tears of a child that weeps
So lets dry those cheeks
As cold as the world is outside
But wait and hide
It's only goodbye till I see you again
So close your eyes
My only one
Well everything has come undone
Well there's bandits diving out of the sun
Vow
Lift up your head and be proud
Once when the spring came anew
Forgive us our sons
For leaving you here in the wake of Hiroshima's blues
Embracing now lost are our two
For we are the ghosts of the dead
All the lost souls who never returned the call
Waits at the foot of the steps
Well some kind of Mercedes-Benz
To carry us down to where the river ends
So come
And run with me down streets of rain
Long gone
The tears of a child that weeps
And tales to sleep
As cold as the world inside
But wait and hide
It's only goodbye till I see you again
Till I see you again
So lift up your head and be proud
