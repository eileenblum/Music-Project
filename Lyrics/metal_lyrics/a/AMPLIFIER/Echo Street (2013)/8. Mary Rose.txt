In each moment that we've saved
And each treasure we've mislaid
On each tooth and every nail
Let misfortune rip the sail
And bad luck we engineer
And each diamond in a tear
Won't somebody show the way
Out of this fortress where we play
Well Mary Rose do you want a ride
Over the {freaks} of the ocean tide
With no particular place to be
We just need to be free
Not living in a dream
So let's catch the wind by its tail
Come on catch the wind by its tail
With hands full of empty air
'Cause nothing was ever there
No sooner had the light been shone
Than was the light already gone
So Mary Rose take a ride with me
Over the edge of the waiting sea
With no particular place to go
Not Mary Rose
Instead living in a dream
So let's catch the wind by its tail
Come on catch the wind by its tail
Mary Rose with me storm clouds and rain blows
Running away over waves that are boundless
catch the wind in your sail
Come on catch the wind in your sail
And what sorrow that it seems
Lies at the heart of sweetest dreams
