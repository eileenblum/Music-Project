It's just a few miles till oblivion now
There was a bad connection from the start
I need to crash the barricades
Wood and paper that you made
To feed the flames that roar within my heart
Between today and yesterday it's all right
I know there's time enough to dream
I get the same recurring thoughts in the night
I never know quite what they mean
So never try to turn your head
Avoid the bitterness
You learn to lead your laughing {unintelligible}
I never had the urge to guess
The space between my birth and death
Another candle snuffed out in the night
It's better to leave your frustrations
Than ride the train as far as it goes
It's better unspoken
The spoiled and broken
Something that fate only knows
And it goes on
Well maybe I was foolish
To go and let you in
And I ain't disappointed
To feel my memories scattered by the wind
And maybe I was stupid
To try and get away
But it's just another daydream
That's caught between today and yesterday
That's caught between today and yesterday
That's caught between today and yesterday
Well we're caught between today and yesterday
Yesterday
Yesterday
Yesterday
Yesterday
