Filtered feelings gathering
Like the holes in a chair
Can touch the air with your fingers
Change the atmospheres here

Beneath all my memories
And take away from me the past
And take constucted slowly mortal
Is thinking laughing at toughts
I know your thoughts

Something clicked in my mind
Incredibly clear
With all the times you've arrived
When we were already here
You're pulling me to the ground
Please help me be there
There ain't no need to decide

So keep your feelings atomized
As gathered ashes on a wing
Don't let me hear insaturation
With Only echoes withering

Remember all the days
Of raising up own high
To steal the sun
Following the dream
So far away
Better than a whole
Another day

For another time
Is mine

Something clicked in my mind
Incredibly clear
With all the times you've arrived
When we were already here
You're pulling me to the ground
You'd rather be found
I need to know that you care

For the love that I found, I found
For the love that I found, I found...

The end of night has come
