Bitter blue and alone
Lost again and again
And I don't know where I'm going
And I don't know where I've been
But I will turn
Turn out the sun
To a spacesuit you're born
Soft skin keeping you dry
So vulnerable and alone
Without a tear in your eye
I will turn
Turn out the sun for you
Turn out the sun
And take whatever my come
I'd turn out the sun for you
{If you had been} today
Well what do you say?
And when the time is at hand
To walk the void EVA
Don't break the back of a travelling man
With just the stars to guide your way
We shall see
If you'll turn out the sun for me
Would you turn out the sun
And say son of a gun?
Would you turn out the sun for me?
Well what do you say?
