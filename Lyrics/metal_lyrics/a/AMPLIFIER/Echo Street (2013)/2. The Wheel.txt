Well there ainât no fame and fortune
Thereâs only destiny
Upon the wheel
The wheel of compromise
Driving at the wheel
There is a prisoner
Upon a road of aimlessness
Or travelling without arrival
Well the wheel is spinning
Around round round round
Yeah the wheel is spinning
Around round round round
Well the wheel is spinning
Locked up your spirit in a cage
To watch it run around in circles
Here upon the wheel
Where are we riding it to?
Well the wheel is spinning
Around round round round
Around round round round
Well the wheel is spinning
Around round round round
Around round round round
Well the wheel is spinning
Around round round round
Around round round round
Well the wheel is spinning
Around round round round
Around round round round
Well the wheel is spinning
The wheel is spinning
Yeah the wheel is spinning
The wheel is spinning
It just keeps on spinning
The wheel is spinning
The wheel is spinning
