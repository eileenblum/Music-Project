A blackbird came at the crack of day
From the other side of the window I heard it say
It's time to go
Don't be filled with the fear you saw
Waiting on the other side of the black door
It's time to go
And don't you know that I
I go where the river goes
Where the river goes I go
And I
I go where the river goes
Where the river goes I go
And the song I sang well the message fell on deaf ears
Too deaf and tired to hear
A simple blackbird melody
The sweetly singing of the sun
Right at the centre of a man is a spinning black hole
Now it's time to follow and I
I go where the river goes
Where the river goes I go
And I
Well I go where the river goes
Where the river goes I go
I go
I go
I go
I
Go where the river goes
Where the river goes I go
I
Go where the river goes
Where the river goes I go
I
I go where the river goes
Where the river goes I go
I
I go where the river goes
Where the river goes I go
