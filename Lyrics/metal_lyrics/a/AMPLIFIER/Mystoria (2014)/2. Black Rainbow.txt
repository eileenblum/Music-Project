Well thereâs times that a man feels like he canât go on
Feeling the same way he did yesterday
Well itâs got to be wrong
Iâve got two eyes to see out of and a human soul
So ride the Black Rainbow right down into it just as far as it goes
Letâs do it

And thereâs times that a woman â well she just wonât be wrong
Sheâs going to drum that fact right in to me till Iâm singing her song
Iâve got a headful of troubles and a coffin of gold
So ride the black rainbow right down into it
Until it fits you good

And Iâm going to sing my song
Been stuck in a throat far too long
And Iâm going to get me gone
Going to get me some#

Well
We did it again
