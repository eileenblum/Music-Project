In the cold light of day
And the blast of the moon
What did you see miss jones
Did you look âem in the eye
As life was choking you
Choking you dry

And the light of the dawn
Is a fire in this maze made of mirrors
Iâm sneaking though
This is just one of many things I have observed around me
Lifeâs a mirage
Tricking you
Joking you

Iâm just a statue of stone
Without a backbone
Iâm telling you
Oh my god
Satanâs in the rear view mirror
Are you looking for a truth
Where there is no truth to be found
