Well there ainât no cure to the meaning of if
Thereâs no meaning there at all
Right from the top of the highest peak
Well the sky is gonna fall
With the mountain man gonna take his hand
And roll down to the seven seas
Well there ainât no cure to the meaning of if
Cause itâs a man-made disease

So letâs fly away to the world and the void meet
To where the sons and daughters of the seven moons are gonna flower like a weed
No matter if your just a village boy
Or just a broken toy
Well any simple man can see
That there ainât no cure to the meaning of if
Least no meaning I can see

So hand me down to the wishing well
Hand me down a gun
Iâm gonna seal this deal with a vampire kiss
That was stolen from the sun
And donât you know that its suicide to keep it all inside
Like a wounding to conceal
Well there ainât no cure to the meaning of if
Least no meaning that is real
