Born in the wonder time
Been burnt by the lights that shine
Alive in the dying days
Unable to change my ways

Born in the golden years
They shaped all of my fears
With brides for Frankenstein
Born in the wonder time
Yes I was

Born on a silver spoon
It slipped away too soon
And 1999
Born in the wondertime

Oh yes I was
