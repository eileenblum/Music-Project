[Bonus Track On Media Book Version]Did you hear the radio play our song
In the static in the air all night long
Itâs a hot winner and Iâm Hi/Lo in love
Hi/Lo in love, Summer of love

With the rays of the sun everybody join in
Something inside of you calling
Something inside of me calling
We can be one

Get ready for love
Weâre already headed for the bosom of awesome
We came to preside upon
Let it come and meld every heart
In the sun
We wonât tell no one
When the world come undone
Summer Of Love


So ride the river wide to work each day
And carry worries far away
Gonna lift us up
Let the devilâs tide take us home

Cause theyâll try to water you down
You know what theyâll say
Alive in the sun

Come on day or night
we wonât tell no one
