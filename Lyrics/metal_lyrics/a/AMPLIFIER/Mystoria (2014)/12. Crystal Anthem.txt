My girl with the moonbeam eyes
And the hair like the wind in phantom skies
She got a hole in the corner of the pocket of her blue jean
And an x-ray gaze thatâs mind expanding
Summin like a once in a billion

And I just want to say
That life is a kind of game
Weâve all been born to play
Where the wind will blow every emotion
Where a fragile heart
Is easily broken

Well the baby boy is big and strong
With the furrowed brow thatâs one week long
Heâs got a glint in his eye thatâs as bright as a sunbeam
And the Coca Cola eyes as cutting as laser beams
And the magic mind decay that makes me want to say

That life is a kind of game we all get born to play
Like a hand that brings each devotion
Reaching out
And I just want to say
That life is a kind of game
Weâve all been born to play
Where the wind will blow every emotion
Where a fragile heart
Is easily broken
