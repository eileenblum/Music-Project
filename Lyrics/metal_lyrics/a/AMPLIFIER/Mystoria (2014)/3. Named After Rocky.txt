Paper man â hey ainât you champion?
A lightninâ rod for disaster
Carved your name upon each pay check
Take a leap of faith into the dark
If you donât know where to start
Well the top of the heap is very far
That much I know

And all the rainbows in the sky
And all the money in the world is all the same to me
Cause whoâs the winner â who can tell
Upon the road straight to hell
Dance toe to toe with the devil and Iâm gonna do you proud
Iâm gonna make you proud

And as cold as the neon light is
Well itâs warm enough for me
Cause every man was born to shine
Seeing his name on a west end sign
When you get your chance â you donât ask why
You just jump and fly
Real men donât cry

Real men donât cry
