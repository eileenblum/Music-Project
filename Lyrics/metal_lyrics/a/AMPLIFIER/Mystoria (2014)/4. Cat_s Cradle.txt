Well the world is like a catâs cradle
Too much tension in a catâs cradle

Worked your hands to the bone
Paid the price on the merry-go-round
Show me the future Mrs jones
Hold on tight â donât let the cradle fall

Been hanging about in your catâs cradle
Been swinging on the fingers of
Wont you show me the door to a sticky catâs cradle
Donât let the cradle fall

No fun being a mouse today
Been walking the streets in a daze
And Iâm gonna say that thereâs a whole lot of shaking going on
Thereâs some freaky shit going down
Is there a shadow miss jones on the bedroom door
Hold on tight
Donât let the cradle fall
