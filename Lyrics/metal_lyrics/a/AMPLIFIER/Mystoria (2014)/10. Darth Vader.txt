[Bonus Track On Media Book Version]Well I wonder if you hear me
Our father Darth Vader
In the heart of your manticore
Hey pilgrim what you waiting for

Come and get balls my enemy
Big brother to my family
And now any day for sure
My disciple well now youâre kicking down the door
Well what you waiting for?

Iâm part human Iâm part warhead
Iâm just a Martian â give me disintegration
Your majesty â youâre  fireproof
Like darth vader
Weâll live forever
