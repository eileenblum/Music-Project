Been counting off the days
That you've been on my mind
Well, I'm just your prisoner
Who's trapped within these foolish walls

Girl, if you believe in my
If only for a minute
If you'd only take a look inside
Well, I left you a clue to find
In every place I've been
Well, are you looking for a man
To try to solve?
Well, to open up?
Won't you open up?
Won't you open up?

And now I swear
That I won't try to pretend
That I ain't your suicideâ
The devil inside whispering:
"Well, can we come alive?"

Girl, if you believe in my
If only for a minute
If you'd only take a look inside
Well, I left you a clue to find
In every place I've been
Well, are you looking for a man
To try to solve?
Well, to open up?

If you believe in my
If only for a minute
If you'd only take a look inside
Well, I left you a clue to find
In every place I've been
Well, are you looking for a man
To try to solve?
Well, to open up?
Won't you open up?
Won't you open up?
