To the shining peak I am headed with every step
Sliding and slipping on a road of yellow brick
That leads right to the tip
Of Crystal Mountain

Hold the hand which hovers out reach
She always guides the way
Wonât you walk with me
In the meadows and gardens
Of Crystal Mountain

I found my golden road was a dark desert highway
That life was leading me down
And though the road may be long
Well the summoning is strong
From Crystal Mountain

In the thunderstorm that echoes out of reach
I always hear her name
Wonât you walk with me
Past the statues and palaces
Of Crystal Mountain
