Always climbing up this ladder as it decays.
I see myself slipping into this again.
Always accepting defeat to find your soul crumbling apart.
Silence only blurs into this pain.

Run away from the pain consuming your identity.
Deep down, far within, you have only fooled yourself.
Run away from the pain, no more will you feel this way.
Rejection. Denial. No longer will this pain outlast.

Get rid of the veil that cover your eyes.

Once more you lead this life of selfishness and apathy. I know who you are.
You are so much better than this and I can see behind your sorrowful eyes.
You are who you are.

Self-mutilation.
No option seems to heal these wounds:
betrayed and torn apart, broken by silence, surrendered astray.

Run away from the pain, their judgment is not who you are.
Deep down, far within, it's better being true at heart.
Run away from the pain, no more will you feel this way.
Reflection. Serenity. We are here to break you free.

Once more you lead this life of selfishness and apathy. I know who you are.
You are so much better than this and I can see behind your sorrowful eyes.
You are who you are.

I see myself slipping again all the way down.
I see myself falling again, but I'll find a way.

Once more you lead this life of selfishness and apathy. I know who you are.
I know who you are.
