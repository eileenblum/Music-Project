Can a life lacking passion still be called life
When we exist to dictate something greater than ourselves?
Spreading your ignorance. Spreading your apathy.
There is so much more, yet you close off your mind.

I can see through all your bullshit: promoting against what we love.
This ends right here. This ends right now.

I see you; I hear you grinding underneath my skull.
I feel you; I fear you deceiving all the world.
I see you; I hear you gutting out my lungs.
I see you.

Ignoring the truth. Ignoring this fate.
A shallow philosophy. A living denial.
I refuse to live someone else's life but my own.
We stand tonight, our hearts enflamed, challenging all the things that silenced us.
No more will you lead this life.

Such a big denial: killing every thought I have.
Resorting to violence, I will hold on to what I have.
Keep lying to yourself that I have failed.
I will never lose sight of which means more to me.
Fighting day by day just to see that you have fallen,
Every voice that I say will be heard today.

Open your eyes; you're fed only lies.
Open your eyes; never will I compromise.
Spreading your ignorance. Cancerous ways!
Your words are empty there's no more deception.

Living denial it grips you down; haunting your dreams as you face your reality.
Living denial it grips you down; eternal deception only brings you toward
Facing your fears: conquering death.
Staying in this realm leaves yourself imprisoned.
How long will you leave this dead horse rotting?
This pungent stench leaves my nostrils putrefied.

Living denial grips you down;
Haunting your dreams as you face your reality.
