All this horror. All this pain.
All these things they caused to feed their hunger.
Their demise. Their retribution.
We'll take them to the place where they belong!

We will overcome their sickening ways and abandon these corrupted laws.
Until we take what was ours we will not tolerate again.

This is the time to join together as one.
Rise; break free!
This is the time to heal these broken hearts.
Hatred lies eternally.

[Solo: Marchand]

Kiss your throne goodbye. Your control ends right here.
Anger and misery have made us stronger.
Don't try to escape, for we know your every move.
We are your source of self-destruction.

This is the time to join together as one to destroy this tyrant King.
We shall not have the death of the innocents be in vain.

This war has just broken out! Make way through the kingdom!
The only thing that will heal our wounds is the sound of your endless cries.
This war has just broken out and made its way through the kingdom.
The only thing that will heal our wounds is the sound (of your endless cries).

Your reign of terror will cease to exist for all the suffered under your hand.
I will witness your final hour. These are the last words before you cower.

[Solo: Marchand]

Retribution.
Annihilation.
No more!

This is your destiny. This is your fate.
This is the place where you cannot escape.
There is no place where your spite is unavoidable.
Don't let that thought cross your fucking mind.

Wicked tyrant.
Bringer of lies.
