In the deepest depths of my dreams
I come to realize these empty fears keep myself breathing life.
In this life that we are given every moment counts.

Join me in this journey.
No longer will we listen.
Time's too short to let this wash away.
How quickly we forget these insignificant worries do nothing but paralyze our hopes and dreams.

Searching myself, I start to see through childlike perceptions.
We hide ourselves from our own reality.
Longing to find a sense of true self.
This is who I am; no compromise shall be met.

There is no more self-betrayal, unresponsive anguish.
Life's too short to let this wash away.

Years have turned to waste, these self-inflicted wounds.
Seeks renewal of a new life found ahead.
Time to forget all the pain suppressed.
Our fire will not burn out.

Searching myself, I start to see through child-like perceptions.
We hide ourselves from our own reality.
Longing to find a sense of true self.
This is who I am; these dreams will not be washed away.

This is my life. There's no more compromise.
This is my life. No one shall put me down.
This is my life. There's no compromise.
I've had enough so give up your naysaying judging slander.

I will fall a thousand times to get up stronger than I ever was before.
This is my own sweat and blood.
You can't take what I have built upon myself.
I will fall a thousand times to get up stronger than I ever was before.
This is my own strength and blood.
You can't take what I have built upon myself.

[Solo: Jeong]

Repression. Suffering. Resilience.
A chance for renewal.

Searching myself, I start to see through childlike perceptions.
We hide ourselves from our own reality.
Longing to find a sense of true self.
This is who I am; no compromise shall be met.
