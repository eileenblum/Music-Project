Waves of gelatinous fat hit my face as I slither down the walls of the gargantuan beast.
The acid burns my skin and devours all sense of hope left within me.
Countless hours of searching for new life deemed worthless as I crawl into the belly of the whale.

One thousand screams ring through my ears.
I've betrayed myself.

Betrayer, this time you've gone too far.
Abuser. Perpetrator.
This ends right here.

Living by injustice, crawling back into my hollow shell where all my dreams cry out:
"I cannot hold this in, thoughts bring me closer to my perfect world where this repression leaves me to die."

How can I survive this hell forging our existence?
Taking all that who I am!

Waves of rotten air asphyxiate my decaying lungs. I can almost see the end it tortures my very dying soul: flames engulfing, acid swarming, my body writhes into this pit, I'm slowly drowning. This repression leaves me to die.

How can I survive this hell forging our existence?
Taking all that who I am!

No more condemnation. No!

Open your mind you've been subjected to mind control.
Take away what blinds your eyes and keeps you weak.
Search within your soul and your consciousness.
Make this last attempt to feel the most real.

[Solo: Jeong]

Trapped inside this prison of existence.

[Solo: Marchand]

No! I've fallen deep inside of what should have never came to be.
No.
