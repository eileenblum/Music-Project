Obsessed with thing that not is alive
Playing with death on your own way

Sickening brain-convulsions of morbid truth
A god of all living is what you are

Removing the skin gently from the corpse
Possessed by the thoughts from deep inside

Satisfied of your pervert acts and dreams
Of the sexual occurrence of rotten flesh

Transformates - your brain to unhuman
Mutilates - the victims of your passion

A cerebral caress of your lifeless passions
The inner darkness burns like caustic in your head
A carnivorous hunger is now stronger
Devour every sacrifice of life now dead
Feel like selected of a sempiternal power
