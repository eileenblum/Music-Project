I'm standing here alone
As they are waiting for my time

Soon I'll be taken down
And it will end to meet my destiny
Blood is flowing, mutilation in final rest
Decapitated

They are tearing me from limbs
I hear the sound of my ripping flesh
I scream in pain and agony
As they drag me to my end

Blood is flowing, mutilation in final rest
Decapitated

Laughs behind my back
A scarf to cover my eyes
An icy wind, through my mind
I enter the dark domains

Satisfying, their taste for my blood
Decapitated
