Alone - and my darkness is cold
Pain from beyond, it changing my body
I'm screaming, in pain and wrath
When it twisting my bones, to unrecognizing
An eternal lust, my feelings are
Taste for blood, I have to kill
I feel I'm turning to something unhuman
"Find the edible, feed the fire"

Feed - I need to have
I'm burning, from deep below
Now when I'm immortal, I can't be hurt
So I drink the blood, from the dead

Feel me - nothing human

I'm nothing human, an empty shell
The new generation of mankind
I am the beast, that appears in dreams but I'm true
So feed my fire
Feed, I need to have
I'm burning, from deep below
Now when I'm immortal, I can't be hurt
So I drink the blood, from the dead

Feel me I'm nothing human
