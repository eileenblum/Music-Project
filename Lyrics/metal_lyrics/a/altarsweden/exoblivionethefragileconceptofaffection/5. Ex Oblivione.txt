Sleep - my journey begins

I expand and coming through
I gaze into the darkness
That makes my exploration endless
A fervent vision scream

Torment cries from those who suffer

Hollow dreams - I travel
Vague in excruciations

That exasperating my crave
The sphere eternalize my false device
I hesitate before my menace
Before I leave towards the next - existence

Opened mind - the obscurity
What have I done with my self
Insanity is around me
My expendable wish for liberty
Has turned to a rooted wreckage of my sense

Visions of grief - surrounds me
In a pallid world of lies

I'm fading away in scorn
After all I'm just a passenger
Into the other minds

In inverted madness my journey goes on and on...

The festering shades of life
Has always been such a friend
So why am I so terrified
By the atmosphere that I required

I expand and coming through
I gaze into the darkness
That makes my exploration endless
A fervent vision scream
