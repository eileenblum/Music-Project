Time to live, time to hope
Time to forget, time to look back
Time to fall down, time to keep time

In my head, confusion
Present becomes past and the future now
How I influence the past
While I'm looking forward
Closer from my goal
The next cog, perfect symbiosis

Time to live, time to hope
Time to forget, lime to look back
Time to fall down, time to keep time

Who believes, where's my story
The cog of time has crushed my brain

It turns, turns in my head
It turns in my head
It turns, turns in my brain

Time to live, time to hope
Time to forget, time to look back
Time to fall down, time to keep time

It turns and we shall never know its real size
It turns the wheel of destiny
