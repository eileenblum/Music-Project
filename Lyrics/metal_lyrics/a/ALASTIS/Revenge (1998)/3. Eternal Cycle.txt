Now, lost in the middle of nowhere
Forgotten by human conscience
Kingdom of unfailing sufferings
Unaware by all beliefs

Black sky...the eternal cycle
Soulless bodies...the eternal cycle

We're blind by its greatness
Its shadow hangs over our life
Black sky hangs over our doubts
Kingdom of blood and ice

Black sky, world's perdition
Game of time, the eternal cycle
Soulless bodies, domination
Game of time, the eternal cycle

Lost, captive, we're waiting for the truth
Betrayed by time, we forget to remember

Now, lost in the middle of nowhere
Kingdom of unfailing sufferings

We're blind by its greatness
Its shadow hangs over our life
Black sky hangs over our doubts
Kingdom of blood and ice

Black sky...the eternal cycle
Soulless bodies...the eternal cycle
