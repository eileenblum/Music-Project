Some believe we're innocent
Brazen in front of Unknown
Others believe we're possessed
Dive into your dreams

Enter the ecstasy

Some believe we're dominated
Stupid and naive idealist
Others believe we're the Devil
Dive into your fantasies
Dive into your dreams

Enter the ecstasy

Some believe we're devoted
pawns on a chessboard
Other know we're back
Dive into the light

Enter the ecstasy
