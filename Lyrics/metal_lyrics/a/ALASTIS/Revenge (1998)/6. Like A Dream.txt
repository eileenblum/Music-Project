Compare my life to your dreams
Imagine you guide the evens
Nothing around disturbs your faith
You know what you want, followed the signs

Faces, moves, rumours
I know my friends and recognize our fellows...
Trusting to destiny
Nothing which could draw my attention

You're nothing and I refuse to follow your rules
Like a dream, I control
Nobody shall stop my fury
Nobody shall stop the countdown
