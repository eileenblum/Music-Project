Everything falls down around you
Everything falls down within you
Everything's so dark in your mind
Hopelessness brings down all spark of your pride

You feel...so bad
...Useless

Everything falls down around you
Everything falls down inner you
Mysterious power...beyond darkness
The light

You feel...so bad
...Harmful

Now you're welcome in our world
You can feel the truth, toward the Death
Now you're welcome in our despair
Down, down darkest abysses

Everything, falls down
Everything, so dark
Everything, falls down
Hopeless, brings down
