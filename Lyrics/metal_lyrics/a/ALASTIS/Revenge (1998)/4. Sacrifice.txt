Time's up, end of illusions
Lie, king, you're falling down

No violence, no pain
Only despair and troubles
Those who know, those who believe
Shall enjoy the new order

Keep the faith and be careful
Many of them shall never know
Stay in peace with yourself
try to find your fellow men
For the sacrifice

Sacrifice, together for one
Sacrifice, our souls in one light
Sacrifice, the door shall be open
Sacrifice, come inside

Sacrifice, we'll find peace
Sacrifice, through the death
Sacrifice, end of lie
Sacrifice, end of pain
