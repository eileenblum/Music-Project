Come to my dream, my beautiful life
Nobody knows, nobody can stop
Come to my dream, my sweet agony
I feel like God, I feel so free
Join us on the rubbish of life
Like us you'll love the despair
Join us on the rubbish of life
Like us you'll love the chaos

You understand, you believe
You understand, you know
How to explain when nobody can
Another dimension
How to believe, you understand
How to believe, you know
How to explain when nobody can
Another dimension

Come to my dream, my beautiful life
Nobody knows, nobody can stop
Come to my dream, my sweet agony
I feel like God, I feel so free
Join us on Ihe rubbish of life
Like us you'll love the despair
Just want to say you know
Just want to guide your steps

...Another dimension of physical laws
