Mirror of our future
Present in our past
Close to the beginning
Familiar to the end
She was open to the love
She was open to the truth
That's why she was tortured
That's why she was killed

Burnt alive, for your silence
Burnt alive, by your faith
Burnt alive, she had found
Burnt alive, she had said...truth

Give me a reason, give me a way
To believe in you
Now, show me your face, show me the path
To your deepest beliefs

Burnt alive, for your silence
Burnt alive, by your faith
Burnt alive, she had found
Burnt alive, she had said the truth

She was judged by your faith
She was killed by your hands
But the harm is already made
And I'll never forget it
I've seen the door and never forget your true face

So, give me a reason, give me a way
To believe in you
Now, show me your face, show me the path
To your deepest beliefs
