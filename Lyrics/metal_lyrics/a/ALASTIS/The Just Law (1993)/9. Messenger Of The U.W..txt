They are among us
their justice is imminent
the messenger of the time
the messenger of the U.W.

isolated by their hate
sentenced to silence
they're just waiting for an order
their body don't have soul anymore

we are the power fear their power
we are the justice fear their wish
we are the death they are damned
messenger of the light messenger of the death...
