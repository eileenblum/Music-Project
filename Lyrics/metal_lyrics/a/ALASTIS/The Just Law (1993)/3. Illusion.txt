you're still wavering but your heart is strong;
sharp and gleaming the blade seduces you
your fingers are trembling, your heart races
you feel well...

A picture, a dream, you appear I disappear
Sublime recollection of a past time
where reality doesn't count anymore
alone with all world, left by your heart...

Do you remember your distress?
Do you recall your life?
our roads cross but I remove you
you're not allowed to cheat.

United in eternity I give you up to reality,
illusory but so sad...
