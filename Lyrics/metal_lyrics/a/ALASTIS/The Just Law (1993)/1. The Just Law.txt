for centuries your faithfuls were persecuted
many of them perished in the flames
by the holy road and church' names

But your name stays high in our spirits
for you'll know to reward your servants
Hell flames will be really for them
spring of welfare and renaissance
you'll give them the power of life
while your persecutors roar of pain
for these same flames will be for them
spring of torpor and death agony

by the father's, by the son's,
by the holy spirit's names
by the holy gospel's name
by all holy heaven's name
executioners, do your work!

Lowly we're asking you
to help us in our fight
against the Christian society
and we recommend you
to look after our souls
and to protect us against Jehovah's angels...

by the father's, by the son's,
by the holy spirit's names
by the holy gospel's name
by all holy heaven's name
executioners, do your work!
