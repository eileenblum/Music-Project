while my blood was flowing on the floor
I felt my heart slowing in my chest
I didn't try to fight, I waited.
I appraised this slow and sweet agony.

During some yeears I believed in life
resigned to live I so forgotten to die
now my master's calling me back...

I heard the phone insisting in the distance
then the bangs at my front door
I see you again advancing to me
I felt your hands on my body
I've seen the tears on your face.
But through your glance I understood
I didn't exist anymore...
