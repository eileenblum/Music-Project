Child offered to God
Soul sold by his
You're his life
You're his force

Fear their promises
They smell of lies
Shun their power
They will kill you

Child persecuted in faith
Soul humiliated on pyre
You're his life
You're his force

Listen to your heart
It cries your faith
Listen to your voice
It cries his name ...
