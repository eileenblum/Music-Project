You've created me for serving you
I'm the fruit of your hate the flaw of your soul
I'm living thanks your stupidity
You've created me, I'll destroy you.

Damned of live, banished of death
I'm the nightmare, I'm the hate
I'm violence, I'm baseness
I'm the master, you're slaves.

One day you'll listen to me too
Then I'm the one who sleeps in you
The one who scoffs at your faith
I'm the calvary of this world
A plague for humanity
And nobody can mean me harm
Then I'm the evil
