They know our destiny
They feel our suffering
They wish our salvation
...on the other side

We persuade ourself
That it death comes to the end
But we know that`s not true
We can`t lie to our conscience
From the most athestic
To the most fervent believers
We fear the rebirth`s pain
The eternal beginning again

They know our destiny
They feel our suffering
They wish our salvation
...on the other side

You can lie,you deny
You can blaspheme
You can hide,run away
They`l be always with you
In your sorrow
Your happiness
They`ll be always present
Forget your pride
And seek the peace...
...with the other side

Accept your destiny
Admit your faults
Carry out your mission
You`ll be rewarded...

...on the other side
