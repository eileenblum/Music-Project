I`ve seen the darkness
Beat down on the world
Demons awaken into the fallen souls
Love crushed by the people`s folly
Sometimes I become aware
And I remember,the cold light
My body which becomes taut
The blood which flows out
From their empty eyes
A smile driven my person
And the lady in white moves
Toward me,she`s afraid!

She`s afraid
But wants to listen to me...

I don`t want
To come back anymore
Cause I`ve understood
The reason for this
Will to live
Experienced so many
Disappointments
And suffering in flesh
Recognized in you
A part of me

Together,
This is our only chance
To keep the answers
We`ve acquired

A curse on humanity
A curse of life
A curse on me
A curse on you

She`s afraid.She`s afraid of me

Come with me into the darkness
Dive into your subconscious
Together we`ll win
