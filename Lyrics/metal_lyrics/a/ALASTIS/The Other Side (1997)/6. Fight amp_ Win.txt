I`ve fled this promised freedom
Fled this justice`s parody
Fled your unreal heaven
Fled your blindest beliefs

Here starts the true fight
Here starts my life through your death
Here starts the true fight
Here starts my path through the chaos

By your lies you`ve betrayed us
And from this sprouts its power
Shake,preaches,your end is near
Here starts my life through you death

Here starts my life
Here starts your death
Through the chaos
Here starts the true fight
Here starts my life through you death
Here starts my path through the chaos
