Everytime in balance
Between light and darkness
As a tighthrope walker
With naked foot on a razor`s edge
I`ve though to lose the faith

Am I alive,am I dead
Something turns in my brain
Is it the end or beginning
I`ve lost my path

While I found an answer
A wall of questions
Stood up on my way
THen,an evening
While I was doubtful
Of my own life
I dived into the light

Is it a dream or reality
Do I exist?
Is it the end of beginning
I`ve lost my soul

Is it the end of beginning

This one
Whom everyone dreads
Porter of divine knowledge
Is only power and light
And sheds light on our path
