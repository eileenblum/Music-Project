Beyond this reality I live for eternity
Keep to silence by christianity
I`m awayting true beliefs

Beyond this reality
Unreal hides in nothingness
All sensation has disappeared
Mater is only a spectre of cold light
And this unreal fear to never come back

Out of time

Out of time for a moment
Several lives in dimension
Several answers to my questions

Out of time

During this time out of time where
Second meets millenium
The silence weighs on the void
