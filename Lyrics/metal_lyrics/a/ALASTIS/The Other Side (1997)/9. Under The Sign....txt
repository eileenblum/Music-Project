From our purest tought
Spurts his venom
If by charity you think to help them
You defy all the same
His currency`s will
...Under the sign of the U.W.

I`ve crossed the threshold of life
To defy this death
Ecstasy of crime
Taste of blood
Hared,lowest sadism
Physical suffering,persecution
It stars again

So I`ve learned to mask
My feeling under a shell of toleration
Mouthpiece of the universal spirit

Yes I`m back and determined
To have done with them
...do you understand only
Your co-operation can free us
Stop seeking that I try to show you
Why do you refuse
To listen to yourself

Listen to yourself
