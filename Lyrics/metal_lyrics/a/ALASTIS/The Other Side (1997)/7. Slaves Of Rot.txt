Life consists to die in pain
Don`t give away to such lowness!
Your move sentences you
To stay in fear and pain for eternity!
Awake mind in dead body
You`ve cheated your destiny

Destiny is not to understand
Painful will be your ignorance
Beyond the existence`s
Boundaries
...pity hasn`t matter!
Awake mind in a dead body
You`ll have cheated
Your destiny

In the squalid streets
Of the city
Burien in
The oblivion`s darkness
He sobs the memory
Of those he liked...
Between life and death
How he`s choosing...
Prisoner of eternity

You must live
You must fight
You must win!
