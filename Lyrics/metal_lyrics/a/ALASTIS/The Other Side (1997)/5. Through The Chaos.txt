Do you remind another time
Another place,the meeting,
Volunteers you?
Do you remind me and us
Do you remind us and me

Remind shouts,remind fire
Remind suffering,remind light

Captured,tortured
Humilated,sentenced
Sentenced to die by fire
Then return
In another time...
All forget,all start again
Remind
