You've bored my mind, resorted to trickery
You've tried to dominate, to break unity
Against all sense I've left my moral out
Your attitude force me to be evil

I'm not, not in a mood to joke
I'm not, not in a mood to please

Convulsed with laughter
Cause you're not able to imagine,
How bad are my thoughts,
How sadistic are my views,
I carve your f** smile with my teeth
And mangle your dreaming body
And you'll be lucky if at the end
I'll give you death

You've bored my mind, revived my fury
You've tried to dominate, to break unity
You've spread trouble, brought confusion
Revived my distress, my deepest hatreds

I'm not, not in a mood to joke
I'm not, not in a mood to please

I'm sorry babe
For sure you're not bad, you're a pretty nice person
In another world, in another life... maybe
I know my limits and when I feel my body quivers with anger
I prefer to desert my place, to exorcise my thoughts

I prefer to die again and again
To break the feelings, to leave my place...
To dive in sleep, forget my reason
And walk with the gods to the root of evil...

I'm disappointed
I strike a balance of my life
your faith, your self-reliance
begin again to bother my soul

You've bored my mind, revived my fury
You've tried to dominate, to break unity
Against all sense I've left my moral out
Your attitude forced me to be evil

I'm not, not in a mood to joke
I'm not, not in a mood to please
So go away...
