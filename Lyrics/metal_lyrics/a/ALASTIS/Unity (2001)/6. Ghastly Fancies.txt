While the minds sway to the unknown
While the fears turn into bravery
Good like evil doesn't mean anything
The awake power has chosen its side

To rise my aura to the other side
To break the cloak of sympathy
To penetrate the secret of the worlds
To recover the sense of existence

To know the spiritual peace
To create light and darkness
To recover the path to Eternity
To brave evil I've done and the one I shall do...

I'm waiting for you, don't straggle on the way
Set me free from this body
Prisoner of matter, slave of rot
I need again my liberty

Planned of the mercy of storms
Thousand freaks stand out against the darkness
They twinkle and dance in space
Hypnotize their victims in ghastly fancies
And take delight on their bad thoughts
Ghastly fancies! Ghastly fancies!
And take delight on their bad thoughts

To rise my aura to the other side
To break the cloak of sympathy
To penetrate the secret of the worlds
To recover the sense of existence
To know the spiritual peace
To create light and darkness
To recover the path to Eternity
To brave evil I've done and the one I shall do,
I shall do in ghastly fancies...
