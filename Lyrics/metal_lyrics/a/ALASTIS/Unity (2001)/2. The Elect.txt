And the same conflict, and the same enemies
And the same nobility and the same slaves
And the same gods and the same laws
And the same hate which raises us

We are the elect, don't expect to joint us
We are kings, you're nothing we decide
We are the elect, don't expect to joint us
We are kings, stay slaves and die

You work for us but you think you are free
You think you know, you know what we say
You fight together when we decide
And your pride... is your jail

And you're captive, of your beliefs
Captive of your faith
We are the elect, we are...

And your gods and your laws?
And your faith, and your pride?
And your gods and your laws?
And your beliefs and your life?
We are the elect, justice and offender
Do you want another king or maybe another god?
We are the elect, world is changing, we don't!

And your gods and your laws?
And your faith, and your pride?
And your gods and your laws?
And your beliefs and your life?

A king is dead, a king is dead

We are the elect, don't expect to joint us
We are kings, you're nothing we decide
We are the elect, don't expect to joint us
We are kings, stay slaves and die
