I force the gate to the ages to come
I need to know how tomorrow will be
Force the cage of time, the heaven's gates
I need to believe in my destiny
I look at my life, deny the obvious
I need to believe in my deceptive greatness
Look at the world, I find my place
I need to believe in my existence

Tormented with suspicions
Baffled by delusions

Reduced to theorize on dreams
I have to keep my self-control
Affected in the bottom of my heart
I need to follow the way of light

I need my existence

However He's done shudder the boldest warriors
However he's waked me with tears
The thrills, frozen blood, the wind of death
The fears, misery, the lords of evil

That's Him, and I'm starting to like that
Damocles' sword on this so precarious being
I recognize His glory, devote my life to Him
I'm convinced of His power and shall give blood for Him

I force the gate to the ages to come
I need to know how tomorrow will be
Force the cage of time, the heaven's gates
I need to believe in my destiny
I look at my life, deny the obvious
I need to believe in my deceptive greatness
Look at the world, I find my place
I need to believe my own existence
