They're afraid
Afraid of the truth
Afraid of doubts
Afraid of differences

Poor souls, betrayed by the picture they've done of evil
Convinced by their peers, they acceded to the top
And now they're afraid of their power
They haven't got the grit to tell us the truth
About the nothingness, the full reality
How we were betrayed
How we were guided according to the prophet's words
Who created the gods?

Grow and propagate
They need your innocence
Master, master or destroy
They'll give you the reason
Grow and propagate
They need more greenest
Master, master or destroy
They'll give you the laws

Before they were able to read in their heart
Before they knew, they believed in us

They're preaching the words of Christ
They're looking for a better control
Preaching the words of Christ
They're looking for, looking for a better control
Who created the gods?
