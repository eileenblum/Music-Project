He`d have been dead since more than nineteen centuries
But stayed alive in many sincere hearts...
He`d have been the son of God... but who is God?
Only one thing i`m sure, he`s never born in my believes
And i refuse to be slave of this leegend...

The church shakes, its faithful doubt
But the fight still isn`t winning!

Jesus Christ,
His name was Jesus Christ

Look at the result,
Two thousand years of inquisition,
Hate, lie and persecution

Jesus Christ, Saviour, Lie &amp; Hate...
