Lost in dimention, lost in pain,
I`m there prisoner of war, prisoner of life,
I`d like to tell you abour my secret and fears
But none human words could translate my torpors

I`m suffering from life, I`m waiting the return
I`m ll death, I can smell his breathe...

Victim of my questions, victim of my answers
I shun truth, I shun death
Deny the obvious, think about life...

Victim of my Knowledge
Victim of my power
I shun thurh, I shun death...

Master, let me die
Lost, lost in dimention
Lost, lost in pain
I`m there prisoner of the life
Master, let me die

I`m suffering from life
I`m waiting the return
