Around my death-bed, no tears no sobs
I`m entering in His kingdom
I`m Him and He is me

Cry, sing, dance
Follow the path of your destiny
Banish impures and infaithful
I`m disappearing in the joy!

You,vile Christians,
You, rotten priest,
Burn in your believes,
Hang your lie on the cross
And die!

United, we`re Master
Rejected, we follow our path
No tears, no sobs, I`m disappearing in the joy...
Cry, sing, dance, now I`m Him, now I`m free!
