Stay close to us and look at the decadent world
Follow us in this unknown who scares you
Find the answers you didn`t dare to find
Forget all prejudices, erase all their lies
Dive into the light, comfront the forbidden truth

You, christian, muslim or jew
I defy you god to be more high than you
I defy the love to have won the hate who slaves you
You can be master and worship yourself,
Fight at our side for the return of lost liberties
