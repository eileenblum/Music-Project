I`d like to see tears on your face
I`d like to feed the hate in your look
I`d like to guess the death in your thoughts,
Don`t let the hope`s rays flash through your hate!
Children of reason, dogs of hell...
By His name you`ll keep a watch on your brother
By His name you`ll banish His enemies...

Children of reason, dogs of hell...
By His name...

By His name you`ll keep a watch on your brother
By His name you`ll banish His enemies...

Accept your destiny, follow your hate!

Harbor of despair,
The hate will overcome!
Free your spirit, seek the truth

Children of reason the "paradise"`s deceived you!
Reveive your spirit`s power and follow us
under the right path...

By his pleasure, by our power, we`ll be eternal...
Follow your hate!
