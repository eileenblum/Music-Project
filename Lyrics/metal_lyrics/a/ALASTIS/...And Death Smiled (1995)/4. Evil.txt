Spirit of infinity, traveller of an other age
Omitted fron the people`s memory
Lost in the maze of the time
He keeps the faith, He believes in us.

Evil,"I will give your blood"... Take mine!
Evil,"I will give your soul"... Just try to find mine!
Evil,"..." don`t let the old fears take part from Him
Evil,"..." don`t let the ignorance subjects us...

Spirit of the light, spirit of knowledge
He frees us from the time`s constaints
In order to find the the strengh and the way
To reveal at the people`s conscience
The divine power who dozes in them...

Evil...
For love, for hate
For pleasure, for duty, Kill...
Evil...
