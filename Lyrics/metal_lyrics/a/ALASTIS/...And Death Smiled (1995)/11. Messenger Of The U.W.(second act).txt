They are among us
Their justice is imminent
The messenger of the time
The messenger of the U.W.

Isolated by their hate
Sentenced to silence
They`re just waiting for an order
Their body doesn`t have soul any more.

We are the power
Fear theit power
We are the justice
Fear their wish!
We are the death
They are the damned
Messenger of the light
Messenger of the U.W.

They are among us
Their justice is imminent
The messenger of the time

We are the power...
