We`re betrayal we`re torment and fear
We`re destruction, we`re conflict and pain
We`re anxiety, we`re suffering and death
No distinction, we only fight for victory

We are the knights of death
We are the ghosts of war
We are spirit of evil
We are only march for victory

We are the knights of death
We`re conflict and pain
We`re suffering and death
We only fight for victory

We`re betrayal we`re torment and fear
We`re destruction, we`re conflict and pain
We`re anxiety, we`re suffering and death
No distinction, we only fight for victory
