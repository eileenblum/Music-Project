From the power, the power of your faith
Is born the life`s fire
Still believe, in the spiritual union
Still believe in your power
And live, and die in peace!

Beyond the life, the life`s mirror
Look at your destiny
Beyond the life, the life`s mirror
Don`t let the doubt come over
And live, and die in peace

Live, live for you, fight for Him
Don`t let the doubt come over...

I`am still alive, I`m still the same
I`am still alive, I`m still your faith
I`am still alive, I`m still the same
I`am still alive, I`m still the same

I follow you through you nightmare
I follow you through you life
I follow you through you your destiny
I follow you through you your torpor!
I`am still alive, I`m still the same
I`am still alive, I`m still your faith
I`am still alive, I`m still the same
I`am still alive, I`m still youself
