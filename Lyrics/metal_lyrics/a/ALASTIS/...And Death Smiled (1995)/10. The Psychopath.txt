The evil flower`s born in my spirit
And from my mist up conscience
I won`t listen to anythink more.
I walk in the night, desperate

Guiled by the death I`m spreading!

A life without sun, a sorrow without tears
Victim of my victims, forgot by myself
I don`t understand more...
Will I knew how to overcome my anxieties?

Guiled by the death I`m spreading!
Guiled by the death I`m free, eternal
Guiled by the death I`m spreading!

No more love, no more hate
I`m only master, onlyy god
I owen`t somebody anything
I`m born to kill, born to be free

No more slaves, no more rights
Alone with my despair
Alone in front of my destiny
I`m born to kill, born to be free
