Oh my dark putrid mirror where is our blessed harmony
Oh my dark putrid mirror show me thy iron sympathy
I bind my black book of wisdom
Papers so dusty and old,beauty is so strange

Oh my dark putrid mirror once we were virginal purity
Inloved eternity,divine serenity
Oh my dark putrid mirror celestial romance is slowly fading
Like innocence in voracious perversion
Oh my dark putrid mirror this cursed scorn is so lonely and grim
Like a cold hard moon in the almighty sky

Smear my cruel picture of decadance
Befog my benighted eyes with thy light
Immortal passion will ressurect me again
Oh my dark putrid mirror

Oh my dark putrid mirror why did you let me know
Why didn't you let 'us' walk through your calm snow?

Fallen left to burn by me
I am them,they are me
