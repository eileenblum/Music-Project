Thunder eyes shining by the ancient flame
Bizzare shadows hunting the light in this game
Possessed hands by the destiny of dead
Sticking in god the sword of the damned
Give me the storm
Oh symbols of blasphemy
How sweet is the taste of lucid sin

Sword Of Damnation
Two blades weeping for the blood
Sword Of Damnation
I felt for one more time

Weep my soul under reflection of the moon
Sicking shapes are signing rituals of doom
And calling the end that will come very soon
And killing the god by the power of the dead scull
Take me cold storm
With sign of dracony
How sweet is the taste of lucid sin
