It comes the morning and people under the shadow of cross
It comes the conscience by cold splash of church's weather
Still fresh torture of my weak body that falls
Through the fear, lost stare in future so near

It comes the morning and people thirsty for my blood
A mottled mass, children on celebration of my death
The wounds hurts, the wound on heart of nervous brands
And makes me to spend my last hours of path
Through the hate beautyful of this ceremony

All my sins... are burning in the dark
The prince of sorrow and lust has died today

Is needful whole life
To understand the meaning of this
Or to let nothingness to stream
Through every part of my bitterned beign
But may be the happyness I sing
Is only one step longer than road
Than the longest path fulfilled with thorns
Which is story that deadly wanders anyway

And when the snow is falling on the face of the world
Raw, becoming wind turns my mind on the other side
And leads me into the sea where everything is turned
Tree of life, seasoned and decayed is looking at me
Fallen in spirit, hungry from light, that nectars I eat

Spited under blasphemy my eyes are burning
Two worlds against themselves
In this sex, the great hate is borning
Bloody aria with thousand faces and dully minds
Gracious end to eternal damned

All my sins... are burning in the dark
The prince of sorrow and lust has died today

Is needful whole life
To understand what this means
Or to let lethargy to rule
In every part of my bloody beign
But may be the sorrow that some sing
Is only one step longer than road
Than the longest bridge decorated with thorns
Which is the story that travels anyway...

Ahhh, moments of my lying truth...

Head on tree-stump, cursed words from my screaming lips
Short pain, this agony contains in eternity
I still see them, but I got another shape
And I am granted with duty to watch from the sky
To kill and destroy mortal followers of god!

Ahhh, moments so beautyful...

All my sins... are burning in the dark
The prince of sorrow and lust has died today
