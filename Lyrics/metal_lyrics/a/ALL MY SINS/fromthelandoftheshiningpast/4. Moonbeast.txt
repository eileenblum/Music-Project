Meanless pulsating of unity of life and light
Malicious thoughts that are walking as death
I do not accept the sun and peace in mankind
Because I wander as demon under your shades

Creation on roots of the cloud of our lucid mind
Rising as a tempt across the field of life
Enormous and proud - the collection of all man's pain
And I dwell as demon under your shades

Under the shadow of the moonbeast
Under the sounds of vampire in dark

"Mnogo zivotnih staza uticu na nasu dusu
Neke streme ka svetlu,neke ka vecnome paklu
Ja izabrah tamu i simbole nocnih dveri
Ja zadobih senku meseceve zveri"
