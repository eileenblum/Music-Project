Bountiful wind entered chambers of my lust
Cloaked my thirst with thy frozen light
It spread a cold breath of cosmic labyrinth
To march through cloudly and fogged silence

Baptized by the black requiem of mortality
I smear my wrinkled face over shadowland
The agony of unknown crawls upon my shoulders
Do we seek for immortality?

And I saw myself in the manmade lonelines
Floating through this dark infinity
Possesed by the lack of eternity
Unholy lust I gaved for your enchantment

In this mystic forest I found a three boxes
Purity - the crystaline expirience
Illusion - the coloured spice for the blind
Reality - pain and passion incised in black

As I touched the lissom surface of the worth
A melted light opened wound in my desireful soul
Utopia I found you,join me in this death
Utopia bleed for me as I bleed for you
