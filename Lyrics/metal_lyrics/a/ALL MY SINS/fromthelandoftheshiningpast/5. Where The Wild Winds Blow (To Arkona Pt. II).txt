Winter...
Has gathered the wolves..
Once again..
On it's southern lands...

The true kingdom of wolf
And it's king on the throne of shadows
Blackened by the wine of destruction
Dressed into weapon to attack

Into the wood...
Apeared by this illusion..
For the blood...
And it's grim taste

In the ancient masquerade that is living
When we are all drunk and poisoned in the night
Everything becomes the forest obssessed by the moon
Thirsty for the holy blood and strong to crush the world

Presentimenting and awaitning the sign
The sign when the weapons will shine
And hard will be the moment's crime
The deadmans around the bloodred ground
And from wind to fire
From the demon to the devil!

Hail to our prematurely star
Hail to our beastconnecting fire
You are shining high into the slavic sky
You are burning eternally in our hearts

Where the wild winds blow
From the demon to the devil!
