A spirit awakes, encapsuled in matter crude
Encapsuled in the world of time and flesh
Under an oath to endure
Survive severe conditions
In a systematic search of the soul

To return to what it is

Dulled by the world, seeking
Blindfolded bliss, hiding
Reaching for truth, fragments
Drugged by this place, wading through illusions

Drowning in filth, submerged
Lost in the role of man
Identified as one
Lasting for less than a breath in time

Embracing the hate, falling
Releasing the rage, inside
Striking its own shadows
Suddenly wakes, knowing its origin

It`s what it calls enemy
It is its own saviour
Never has it been separate
Part in a plan complete, patterns return

Once so clear, but gone as temptation`s tasted
Collapse in fear, valuable progress wasted
Where is the knowing, the creative splendor
Under an oath, an oath to endure

Once so clear, but gone as temptation`s tasted
Collapse in fear, valuable progress wasted
Where is the knowing, the creative splendor
Under an oath, an oath to endure

Seeing the whole in fragments
