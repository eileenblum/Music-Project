Imprisoned inside this strange construction

Darkness is constant around me
I can sense but I cannot see
Something creeping along the walls
Something guarding the chamber doors

Withdrawn into this place
From all impressions safe
And yet fear escalates
Choking me in its embrace

Disillusioned I entered here
In isolation ensnared
But a mind cannot be escaped
Nor the horrors it chose to shape

Self imprisoned in
Dispirited chambers
Where shadows form a circle strong
Where shadows whisper in unknown tongue

Every moment here feels like centuries
These chambers reek of tragedies

Suddenly I move towards the doors
Through sense not sight I keep this course

The shadows they come alive
Promising death`s to arrive
But my sanity left here long ago
And I`m determined to follow

Selfcaged inside
Dispirited chambers
The key is the state of mind
Inside dispirited chambers
