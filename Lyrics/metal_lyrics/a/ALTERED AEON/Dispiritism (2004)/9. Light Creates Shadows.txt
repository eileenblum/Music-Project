Misguided by the scriptures surrounding religious beliefs
Each manipulator a friend of his own deceit
Interpretations vary from genius to absurd
But the truth can never be written or heard

Believer or not, manipulation is being exercised through you
Following ancient books or mainstream ideas, it is all dogmas

Including each and every aspect of all that is
Summons madness into a being born in this synthesis
An individual crying to the heavens in his divine search
Understands nothing of the complexity of death and birth

Striving to erase all forms of adversity
Oblivious to all things? necessity
Denying the existential complexity
Of the shadows that light creates

Crushing the obsolete framework with an infusion of spirit!

Behind the thoughts lies all answers
Beyond what carnal eyes allows you to see
Behold, awake and see all others
Screaming for water while floating in the sea

Within the reasoning of each liar lies one grain of truth
And behind all the various forms of fear lies the core they seek
Each to their own god, all have their own bible and heed its call
Especially those who claim to believe in nothing at all

Striving to erase all forms of adversity
Oblivious to all things? necessity
Denying the existential complexity
Of the shadows that light creates
