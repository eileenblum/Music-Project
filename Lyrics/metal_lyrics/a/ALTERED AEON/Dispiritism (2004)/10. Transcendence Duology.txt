[1/2:]
Ending life, through slashes performed twice
From both wrists my spirit begins to rise
Sinking into the water, candles burning close
As the elixir of life spurts and flows

Transcendence about to be achieved
By the water the blood is received
So is my angst, fears flow by its side
Joining the mix that spells suicide

[2/2:]
It fills my world, the blinding white light
Unseeing I move, drowned in white
I am nowhere and everywhere
Confronting mortality, transfixed I stare
The puzzling enigma of dying
Here before me, no more denying

Objective now to the laws of incarnation
The will to live secures the continuation
An anomaly rises in the suicidal
As in me, the order ceases to be

Regarding life a form of punsihment
Redefined now in the time of ascent

It fills my world, the blinding white light
Unseeing I move, drowned in white
Transcendence completed
