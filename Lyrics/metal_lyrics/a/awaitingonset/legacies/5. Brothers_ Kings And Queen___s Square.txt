It's time to feel alive again,
Come out your homes, fill the streets,
What do you want in life?
Letâs live life like itâs an open tab,
Letâs live life like it was back then,
Wind back two years,
The scene is coming back,
Queenâs square has never looked so beautiful,
These days are ours,
These months are ours,
These memories we share are ours,
In the spirit of laughs I meant every word,
But we both know, ITâLL END WITH TNT.

Everything we ever dreamed is slowly coming true,
So pay attention to every word I said to you,
Coz even though weâre joking, and palm it all away,
Bare in mind that with you is where Iâll stay.

Home is heart.
