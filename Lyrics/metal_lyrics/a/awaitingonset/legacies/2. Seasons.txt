Darling, donât be scared,
Remember when we hated the last upcoming months?
I promise you, WE CAN ONLY GROW.

Nights are closing in
Iâve waited months for this,
Days on end,
Daylightâs here no more,
Iâm fucking loving this,
Months on end.
Spring, to summer,
Fall for December,
Embrace what we have,
And bring the rain. [Repeat]
