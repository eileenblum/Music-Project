Words canât describe what it feels like to be here again,
Blinded by ignorance and bliss,
You could never have told me itâd end like this,
But Iâm glad, this feeling is home now,
But Iâm glad, THIS FEELING IS HOME NOW.
Speech.

So, in closing, just wait for the sharks. [x2]

So, in closing youâre being erased,
In the tide youâre washed away,
Never to be seen again,
Just wait, for the sharks bitch.
