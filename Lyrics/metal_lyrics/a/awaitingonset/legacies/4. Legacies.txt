As we stand at the waters edge,
We can see our horizons are clear,
Together this ocean could be a stream,
But we must be equal.

So when being one is so simple,
Why do you insist on names?
Itâs so easy to form a truce,
But your ways blind you.

So, go, we wonât stand in your way,
But donât stand in ours,
Because the days of giving are behind us,
If youâre on your own,
Youâre on your own forever,
As we stand,
If youâre on your own, YOUâRE ON YOUR OWN FOREVER.
Swallow your tongue,
Close your eyes.

The stage you put yourself on,
Looks smaller from here,
This is where youâll learn,
This is where youâll disappear.

Swallow your tongue,
Close your eyes.
