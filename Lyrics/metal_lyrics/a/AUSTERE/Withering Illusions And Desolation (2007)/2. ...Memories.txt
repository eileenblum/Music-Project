Even if you turn your memories into a beautiful lie
You're all alone
When the icy wind blows into day breaks sky
The birds can't fly

When the flower of illusions opens out
Still the rain streams
When the light of day will never again be seen
There is no peace

Even if the light of day warms all around
You won't see blue sky
When every second seems like an eternity
Embrace the blue night

Your trembling body scarred, your heart filled with sorrow
The icy wind blows, your memories will remain unchanged
