Will you stay with me til the morning dawns
And hold my hopes close to your heart?
For i can never walk alone again
The winds of time are too strong

In this ever-changing heart, only my love for you remained
Trying to forget the lies, trying to forget the tears
But the scars in my memory will never fade
So lay with me, silent, in this unending night

There was too much to be said
So not a word was spoken
The tears fell in silence
In this unending night

Awaiting a dawn that will never come
We're so close, but somehow strangers
Even though we walk together
The winds of time are still too strong
