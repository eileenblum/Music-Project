To walk an eternity of steps
For it all to end at one...
Disheartened

Laments of emptiness,
In being of barren decay.
The gritty dusk holds,
the poems of everlasting distress...
Absence...

Transparent memory of the purest emptiness.
Amnesty in nothing but void...
For all that will remain...
Silence...

The autumn sky, Moving wings of crimson light,
For an enternity, it never reached the soul.
Winds of solemn despair, Carrying a final breath...

I wither...

Away...
