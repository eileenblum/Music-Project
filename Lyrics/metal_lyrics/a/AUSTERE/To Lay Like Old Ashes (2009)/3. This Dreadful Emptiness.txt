Oh, such a breathtaking sight,
Of purest beauty and innocence.
Uncorrupted by this cruel world,
Spirits not crushed by this cold life.
I can't look away...

You bathe in the sunlight of spring,
While I'm forever stuck in this dreary autumn.
Like a flower that will never bloom,
Forever in this dreary autumn.

You glow with the warmth of the sun,
But your rays don't reach me.
In the cold, dreary autumn,
The sun doesn't warm...

This dreadful emptiness,
The cold, cold world.
You slammend the door on me,
you locked me in the cold.

I craved your warmth,
But it was to late.
Too late you realised,
That I was in the cold.
