I hate that you're alive your existence disgusts me you fucking liar I despise you I want you dead out of this world this place already has enough filth look up in the sky I am the only one above watching you die tonight is the night you finally realize you are nothing you fall to your knees as you pray for forgiveness speak no more the words you spit are just as fake as you and everything you stand for I'll make you scream I'll make you beg for mercy make you bleed you are fucking through this is the end you'll have nobody to save you chains wrapped tightly rattling sends shivers up my spine knowing that your everything will finally be mine pavement runs red every strike hits harder for every lie you told your body lays ripped mangled piece by piece look where your lies have got you left dead rotting in the blood I spill.
