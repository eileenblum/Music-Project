My mind is racing brewing up such a horrible sin disaster arises rotting her angelic flesh she walks these teeming streets spitting words of promises the false love that she cries which hide her lustful ways I've had enough of her disgusting false image now is the time to let the sin begin these were never my intentions towards her creating my devious plan to end her I watch as she strolls the dark silent night waiting for the perfect moment to strike evil lurks around her every move she makes brings her closer to her fate never more will she walk these streets spitting those words of promises the false love that she cries which I her lustful ways she got my fuck I got her life she screams for mercy piteous cries for her life choking on the fuel thats drenching her her body lays in debris with no trace to be found what a devious plan here's to sweet victory.
