Bury everything that we had everything will built together brotherhood dont mean shit to you neither does a bond or trust gave you everything I could even through the thick and thin all I get is stabbed in the back betrayed and abandoned I should have never trusted you karma is a fucking bitch you got whats coming to you sooner or later it will hit you and I'll be right by your side watching you suffer flashbacks of your only brother cross your mind making the pain so much stronger look at me in the eyes and tell me you could live your life knowing that you left me there hoping I would disappear the tables have turned it is clear that I'm still here loaded and cocked back extricate what you deserve brotherhood was something you could not value you turned your back and look where that got you never again will I trust another soul someone who claims to be ever so trustworthy now that he is gone I hope he burns in hell murderous acts on him for all eternity.
