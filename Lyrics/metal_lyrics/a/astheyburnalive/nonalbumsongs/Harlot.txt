Her Drenched lips flowing down her thighs, such a putrid stench
she is pestilence in its purist form i can still taste her flesh how could
i ever lay by your side now i know just another worthless harlot
another one to the world look into my eyes tell me what you see just
a fucking bitch who will die by me climaxing from my touch making her bleed
stoping the disease such infection has no room to live you'll never claim another victim
may have got my heart but now i got your life in my hands ripping out her entrails from the loose
void which lies between her legs
Her Drenched lips flowing down her thighs, such a putrid stench
she is pestilence in its purist form i can still taste her flesh
aroma of decay fills the room blood is dripping from my hands i can taste it when i lick my lips
she lies there lifeless bringing a smile to my face knowing that she can never be again
she can never be again
