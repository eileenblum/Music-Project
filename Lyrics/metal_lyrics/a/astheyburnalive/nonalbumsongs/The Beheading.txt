Hallowed be thy name, we have come to spill the kings blood
on the throne in which he regins
we have come to spill the kings blood on the throne in which he regins
strom to the gates to the kingdom of the tryannical one
slaughter those who defend the crown of thorns
off with there heads sever there limbs one by one
the prophecy has told of my coming yet you did not heed the warning
i have ascended from beneath the depths to bid farwell to an old friend
prepare the axe off with his head
a pool of blood lie at the foot of the throne lifting my trophie by its scalp
letting the masses know whos in control now
raising the remains high on the steps of this kingdom
fall to your knee's and tell me who truely is the king of kings
now i shall regin
all hail your new found king
