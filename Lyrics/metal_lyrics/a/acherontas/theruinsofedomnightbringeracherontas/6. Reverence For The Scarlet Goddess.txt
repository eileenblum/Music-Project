Akkawbishia Lilith enshrine me, your devotional descendant, to pierce the black moon.
Awake me from this tomb, to be reborn.
Obsess me with the wisdom of shapesifting, ignite me in your astral fires.
Zachalilim, Zachalilim, Zachalilim.
I offer thee, the opfers of cosmic nothingness, to unseal the gates of death.
Immortally curse this empty shell until I embrace freedom.
