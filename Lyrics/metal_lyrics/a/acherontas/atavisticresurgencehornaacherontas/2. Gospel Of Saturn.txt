[performed by Acherontas]Asa-Ya-Vama-Asa-Ma-Aana
Vama-Na-Alana-Vama-Na-Kronos!
Feathers of the rising crimson lotus
Ashes of a thousand dead stars
This invocation of paraphernlia and dreaming terrors
I tread the words of the introspective gaze
The rays I gather on a lunar disk moulded with silver
The astral veins reverberate and force to inundate
The astral mind is illuminated with creed
The primordial hunter is now awaken, unchained
Unleashed from chambers within the mortal and the eternal
I stand before me
I dive into the sacred deeps below me
I turn my eye within me
I am the emissary to spell the fiery silence
Gazing from the quarters of Nekelmu
Under the eye of great Draconiis
Feasting in orgy and devour the soma
The feathers are spread upon the disk
I gaze upon the radiance of the raging lunar goddess
Her dance of Thanatos, the trance of ignited stars
Saturn is risen and blazing on the circle
The waves roar as the goddess walks caress the waters
The lotus is purple, the lotus is gold
Saturn spread your rays upon my crown
Kronos! Reveal my glory to defeat Chronos
The goddess steps within
Her throne is my astral palace
Her chants reverberate on the beats of my heart
The lotus is clad with the silver light of Saturn
On the left of my mother I shall be enthroned
On the right of my father I shall march
I spread my wings and embrace the inebriation of madness
And liberation
I pass through your gates
I weave the dreams of oblivion up from within the eye
Of the sole creator
From the ninth star of the universal feast
Hear ye ancients...
Negeltu istu an!
Kibrat erbettim
Adar star of Ninasu
Hebat lady of the skies
Ninurta lord of foundation!
Sabitu god of winds of Tiamatu!
Usella mituti ikkalu baltuti!
