The Aeon of Secrets, Manifest Vadula-lions until the 50 spheres of Nereid. Immerse within the gate of the fevers, silver allurement fractures the lascivious egressions, the aberrant intoxications incite the vaporous entities of her crimson perversions. Admit the forlorn mastications, the third sphere ignites torrential retro-versions, the reverse fornications, conceal the house of my secret thunders. Bathyllic lesions of venomous raptures, the double wanded collusions manifest ecstasies upon ecstasies within the labyrinthâs eye. IA ZIA ZIA ZA ZA ZIA ZIA ZA.

Crown of fevers alight ruminations of the black vault of the stars, seething convolutions excite subtle emissions of the 7th and 19th spheres, as the ophidian rapture extends the ekstasis of she who is the priestess of the gateway of naught. The secret eye awakens swarms of the highest virtue. Imbibe the venomous elixir and the apotheosis is attained. I am the door to the key endlessly awaiting eternity, as the fathomless depths are plumbed by mine eye.

The waters of the moon bequeathed the unknown virtues of the serpent and the sword. Fragmentary, luminous bones cast the reflective light upon the numinous. The strands of the shores of our inner seas were illuminated by the depths of stars unbound! All hail the procession of masks, within benighted chambers gleam the eyes of sunless discernment. Ghostly images burn with splendor and debauchery, septenary, quaternary, serpent fingers gesture forth the veils awakening. Vomit forth the flames of swarming vulture to devour the wings of she whom sheds perfumes of excremental ekstasis and the kiss of the dove shall excite descensions perfection upon the tinctures of crimson and mauve and nothingness.
