The gardens of life are the fields of judgement and quest, the tunnels of initiation and endless thrive. Nations and tribes bow before the utopic strength of matter, I cross  them by the fire of the Gods and the courage of the invincible Sun. By the law of Power I judge and define, the fall of the lost virtue, with ultimate transcendence I embrace the vision of the chosen rebirth. ÎÎÎÎ¥Î¡ÎÎÎ invoked the great Opus of the adepts.

Hidden moons have blessed the risen souls to serve the sovereignty of the elders. Beyond the clouds of Andromeda, a star is born bathed in the light of radiating crown of Alpheratz, baptized in sacred waters from the temples of Ur. Oceans of light to cast aside, and form the sacred symbols.

Mirrors to the depths of an ancient scorching abyss I rise from the ashes of the Phoenix.

I radiate as the Morning Star enthroning my children with knowledge, I shall march by Will, I shall prevail with courage, by Will I shall survive and by the Virtues of Silence I will dominate.

This is the law of the King and the Elect.
