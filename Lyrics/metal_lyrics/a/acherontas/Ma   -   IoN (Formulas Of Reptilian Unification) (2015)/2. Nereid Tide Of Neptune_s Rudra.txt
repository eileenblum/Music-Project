Nereid tide of Neptuneâs Rudra astride of Ursus Minor; a cerebral cord is torn a universe of opposites is born within a serpent Sun thirteen Gods to witness unable to sworn. A line of Stars and a conquest of Eternity to align the Constellations beyond the moons of Mars. O Harlot of Harlots beseech my dream and ignite the fires astride my grave, the fires astride my monuments. O Mother of all Abominations, thou canine spider of Canaan rip my heart and break the ribs, form the Sigil of Neptune. O Reptile mistress, sink thy Cuspids and fill me with your lucid Venom. Lord of Gehennah I ride the chariot of the sun, for I hath become the bringer of the Light, I hath become Neptuneâs Son, worshipped and adored, as the ultimate adversary. Breed of Pan and spawn of Sobek the centuries I wield aside my grasp, to invoke Kings, as formless shades to life. The Moon of Nereid is risen before me, to ignite my Eye. O Rudra, Rudra Bhudeva, O Rudra, Rudra Gurudeva, O Neptune, Rudra Sanatana. Form this Gate of before Me Grant me Entrance to the paths beyond the tides of Nereid Mahesha! Rudraksha! The Voice of Chaos, I Hath Become.
