Twisting of the currents
The Coiled Unfolds
Tempered by Fire
Relentless and Formed
Veins of Iron
Burn through her Soul
Mother Astarte
My will is your Soul
Iâve burned my ego
Six feet Below
Iâve gathered my Dreams
From Lifetimes ago
The Serpent of Silence
The Noose of the Coil
Speaks of the Occult
