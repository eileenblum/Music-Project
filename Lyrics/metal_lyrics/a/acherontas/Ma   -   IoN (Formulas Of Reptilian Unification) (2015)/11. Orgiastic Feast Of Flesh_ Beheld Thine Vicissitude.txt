This be the path and this be the Paradox: that the lowest of depths are to lead to the most supreme heights, and the blackest of shadows unto the most radiant light.

To unravel and unveil, to unmask and unchain the Self of all selves that hide in your Heart of all Hearts â you must tread on the road of the other. Be it presented as a sharp Silver Dagger to cut the cord of memory and align it yet again with Golden fingers with the voices of old Gods that speak between the stellar webs.

Recall that which has been forgotten in dim waters of dreams hollow and cold, and reach in the midnight pools of dispersion the great Secret that laugh behind the torn robe of Death. Date you to follow, that call of unseen lightning that swiftly tear open the veil? Dare you to follow, the dreadful alarm of all that man truly fear? Seek always further, stopping but for No-thing, to crush the idol of God with a leaden hammer to swallow his rubine heart! Wash your brow with Blood of cold murder and trample the law of man underfoot, to know that there is but one single light that shines ever and ever in dreary tombs of love and longing and its name is LUCIFER. The Thunder of the Djinn of Smokeless Fire.
