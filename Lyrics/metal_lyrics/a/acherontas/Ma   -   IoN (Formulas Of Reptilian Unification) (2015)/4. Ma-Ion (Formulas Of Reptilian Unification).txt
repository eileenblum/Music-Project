RELEASE! All lives and all deaths heed but one single call Ya! Nur-I Siyah â O Black crown jewel of GOD!. Not one soul or spirit in these worlds three can unchain their longing hearts without tasting your MYSTERY. Specters begone! For my eyes pierce the night in search for that one mind-blinding sight that shall return the shadowed throngs into ash and lifeless dust, dreams into Death and the wrong into just. And the just into a blade to flay my withering skin and a torch to light my own funeral pyre that shall lend the Peacock-Phoenix its blazing wings rending the skyline with untamable fireâ¦

GOD! It was for you a man I became and clothed my true nature in a garment of shame to praise you in a billion of shapes and names though they all resounded like one and the same. Like a rod of black lightning striking the tower your eye pierced through the dark night of my soul for there can be no other goal of my inmost desire when my hungering heart belongs to FIRE.

âPrisad vare Lucifer! Ljuset av min mÃ¶rdade vÃ¤rld sjung min blÃ¶dande lunga emot avgrundahimmel, sanningens fasa dÃ¤r divisionens vita lik drunkar I fÃ¶renings mitt och ultplÃ¥ningens stjÃ¤rnglans svÃ¤mmar Ã¶ver I midnattsljus!â

He who dares to unlock the nightâs leaden gates and spill his own blood upon the pages of date, he who dates to meet that vile monstrous gaze that waits at the end of the infernal maze and dive without fear into the yawning abyss and steal from the wildest of witches a kiss. Yes, but he has the serpent of old come to bless with a light that blinds both life and Death.
