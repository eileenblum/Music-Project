Stone of Life and Sea of Death
I strip myself from Karmas cursed
A warm embrace of a cold flame
Unified in threefold essence, 
Untamed

ÎÎÎÎÎOÎ¥XOÎ£ â Dragon girded, ÎAÎOÎ¦OÎ¦OÎ£ â Serpent-skirted
TÎ¡IMOÎ¡Î¦OÎ£ â all begetting, Double Mem and Single Aleph
Lips fair and swollen, with maddening venom filled
Come, inject it now into my being

For with Thine Eyes I see creationâs edge
Yes, I am verily possessed
And pass beyond this mortal flesh
Where Gods of Truth abide and teach
Beyond the veil of Lilithâs Womb I reachâ¦

Chants are heard in astral webs
The threads of which you weave and bless
The Swords of Time shanât point at me
Drakonian Womb, Holy Hecate

Vinum Sabbati, bearer of the Key
Below the Rays of Death
Behind the Womb of Hek
Commanding void to form
By the blessings of the Norns

A triangle I have become, descending to the Night of Pan
To dream, to rise and feast at Will
Through tetrahedronâs angles passing still
Uniting the Moon with the Sun
ÎÎ¡AKÎ©N Oâ MEÎAÎ£
Ament-Ta.
