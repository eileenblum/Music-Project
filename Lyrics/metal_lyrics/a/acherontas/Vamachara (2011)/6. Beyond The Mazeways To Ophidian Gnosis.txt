Itâs blindness what your warrens became
Lest you descend to depths you canât fathom
Fragments of Yetzirah to feed the circle
If more is less then youâll become all

Why to embrace a dreamland perishing?
Well, I abandoned my sight so I can See
To shun the false light, Yaldabaoth
Garden of Assiah under his rule tyrannical
Cause-mos wherein the false mirrorâs idol
Shall be chocked by the dimness of its own

I self trail to anti-lawâs course,
As a stream to its fountain lead
As a seed that matures,
Since its roots from non matter are fed

Body of clay, body fragile,
Such shapes lie beyond your grasp
My spine like a serpent it slithers
Masked under my natureâs husk

Climbing reversed to Antichton and what stands below
Warmth coiling around my beinglessness acausal
Itâs not for the blind to see my mercurial body glow!
O what a glow, For I am the Sun and the world is my shroud!
