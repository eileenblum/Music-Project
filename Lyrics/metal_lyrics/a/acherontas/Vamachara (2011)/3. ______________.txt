Great Archon ABRAXAS
ABLANATH-ANALVA
Great Archon ABRAXAS
Abraq Ad Habra

The Adept dons his mercurial robe
And his mighty Yellow Mask
Embosomed with Basilisk feathers
His Avatar is the embodiment of the new Aeon
In a blunt seraphic night
The wretched soul raises the athame

ABRAXAS, ELELETH, SOPHIA The Epoch of PLEROMA is now...

"Ancient Nag-Hamadi scrolls heralded the New King who shall fulfil
the old prophecies and shall leave behind the disgrace of the Pisces Age"

The Adept confronts deadless Abraxas in the mointains of Lethe
And the great beast strikes down the Illusion of the Rebirth

"ABRAXAS was an illusion. No rebirth. No redemption.
We must live in the Iron Age, in this Age of Decay till the End."
