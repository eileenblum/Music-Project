Awake me black serpent of chaos
Those has knowledge of the ancient waters of Her
Reveal to me the signs of Gnosis
Amrita-Nectar of the Goddessâ¦ VAMA!
Grant me immortalityâ¦ SHAKTI!
I place the crown of the Serpent of Omniscience
Upon my head and spell in Blood your commands
May I rise from the four corners of purity and ecstasies
And your unmanifest waters of eternity and infinity
My word made fleshâ¦ THE DREAM THAT I SPEAKâ¦
Arise Oâ dead shades of the Twilight Realms
She who bless with life those who may face herâ¦
The reflection of seven moons
In my void change my blood as elixir and turn it as venom
To bless the wise sons of Sophia!
The abyssic darknessâ¦ of Sadhana!
With my body I shall form my desire
And become the source of life!
SALAMU TAMMABUKKU ELU,MUSH MUSH
ELU NEKELMU INA!
SALAMU KISHPU LINA MUCH ELU
