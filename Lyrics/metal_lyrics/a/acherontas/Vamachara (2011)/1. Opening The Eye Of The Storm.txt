To the Four winds I summon Those who bring Water and Air,
Life into the Astral, within the physical essence of Earth and Fire
It is within the circle of the Tempest which sorrounds the Spirit
I summon the Presence of the Powers you Bestow

It is within contempt of simple being, the Will is Awakened
It is the Will of the Dream, which the Grand Tetrahedron is ascended
The Eye within the Storm of Chaos is opened.
