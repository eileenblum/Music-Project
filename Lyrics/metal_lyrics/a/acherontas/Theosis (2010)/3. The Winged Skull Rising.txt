I was born under strange auspices
Sagittarius showed the way -  Gemini was my guide.
Twenty years - twenty flags of slavery,
Grave was my destiny,
'til Tiphareth beckoned to me.
Three years of torment - Adeptus Minor was my sign.
In Teutonic Lands I suffered
In Northern regions I froze,
I cried, I fought for an olive wreath.
A dead girl shown the way:
I joined my destiny.
I was prophesied eternal to be.
A vision of cold, a drop of myrrh,
A scent of rare incense.
I rose to fulfill my prophecy.
I am Adam Kadmon.
The infinite and the null
The Alpha and the Omega.
The mutated gene of the coming race.
Snakes entwined in an eternal solstice.
My beauty denies any description:
Mechanical to animical - samanistical to theatrical
Corporeal to astral - erotical to apocryphal:

Behold!
My tower raping the sky!
Behold!
My wheels crushing the kingdoms!
Behold! The winged skull rising!
