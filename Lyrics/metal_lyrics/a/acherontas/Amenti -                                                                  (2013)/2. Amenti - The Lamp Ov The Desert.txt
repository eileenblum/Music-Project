[Music By Acherontas V.Priest &amp; Saevus H. / Lyrics By Acherontas V.Priest]

I am the Dreamer of what you call Life...

For i Feed my Fields with Ki and Breath from the Oceans of Divinity...

Join me or pass in the Dead end of of your Mortal Tribes...

BEHOLD!

THIS IS MY WORDS OF FIRE TO THE HEAVENS I SPEAK THE WORDS OF SACRED FIRE..

I AM THE DREAMER..THE CREATOR OF DARKNESS..

RA IS MY FATHER OF THE ENDLESS LIGHT...

THE VESSEL OF HIGHEST DIVINITY...

Dwelling in parallel Worlds and speak the words of Harpocrates..

From Malkuth to Yesod from Heavens to The deeps Of Amenti..

I am the reflection of venomous Kiss and these are my words :

... Urvan Ameretat Me Nemah' Ya I ...

Behold!

I like a fierce storm wind, I unleashed the tempest!"

For i shall spit Venom in the face of the Weak and Joy to My Children...

The Tongues of Fire Speaks the words of the Legacies..

BEWARE THE BREAKING OF THE SEVENTH SEAL!

ARARITA...........

To the call of the night you obey , with the face of Fire you reveal the veil of Death

With the eyes of the raven grant Vision to this lustful flesh ...

Îectar inebriation become the Black Sabbaths

Orgies of the Night you betray..

Oh Mistress of the Night grant wind and breath on this bloody face!

THE WORDS ARE SPOKEN.

AUM-TAT-SAT-AUM...!

[What divides the masses from the rulers is not money, is not swords and rifles, it is knowledge. And what is supreme knowledge -if such a thing exists- but the knowledge to fool death-or even better to use death as a springboard to immortality. I will use the example of the taoist Immortals, knows as Hsien. Hsien literally means man-mountain and the connections with the western tradition of the King Under the Mountain are too numerous. What is important here is that the taoist sage-warrior, part of a secret tradition, allegedly followed external and internal alchemycal transformations til his life-essence (or prana or ch'i or ruach or lifeforce or pneyma) gained certain qualities that enable him to move beyond Death. One must notice that the bet was for these mighty people to strengthen their essence in order THEIR PERSONALITY to survive. So we are not speaking about a hippy-style "Union with everything" and other new age fantasies. We are talking about the real deal: a sentient being, fully aware of his personality, having his full spectrum of memories intact, survives death-in fact the only thing that a hsien loses (or even better throws away) is his body-reminding me the snake-that-sheds-his-skin parable.

Now for research's sake, please find a depiction of the hieroglyph of Amenti.Then compare it with the ideogram of Hsien and its etymological meaning. Truth is -as always- in front of our eyes.]
