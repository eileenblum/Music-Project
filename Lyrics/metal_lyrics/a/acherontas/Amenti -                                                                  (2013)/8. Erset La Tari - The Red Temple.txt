"Marduk personified, standing in the middle of battle, the Warrior-King fought valiantly.
His axe and sword vanquished the opponents.
Body upon body, dead upon dead, walking upon a bloody road of corpses, the Mighty King Eannatum,
bearing the standard of the Illustrius City of Ur, blessed by God Enlil, glorified by Enki, was the Victor of the Day.
But no man, even the God King himself, knows the day of his death. Mighty King Eannatum struck in his prime by a treacherous spear
i now descending the maze of shadowy
Erset La Tari"

Shadows of No Return over a scorched Land.
Blind eyes watch the death of a million men.
Ravens of agony consume divine lives
And my song is lost unheard in
Erset La Tari.

"Oh mighty King, where is your Glory now?
Stripped of clothes, devoid of flesh, with empty sockets
you gaze at the endless darkness.
'Tis the Shadowland, 'tis the land of million cries
where million men with million mouths scream
into a nihilistic void. Oh mighty King, enter
Erset La Tari"

Shadows of No Return over a scorched Land.
Blind eyes watch the death of a million men.
Ravens of agony consume divine lives
And my song is lost unheard in
Erset La Tari.
