Thrice formed, blanketed willflness erupts
Unseen corridors within the viperous wombs
twilight asunder, corode the sublimations
We upon the doorways, behold the Crux Mors

Consummation of your veiled consecrations,
Your shrine bathed in a thousand scepters,
illuminating the searing portals of venomous suppurations

Latent somniscient choirs
breathe the cavernous aeons
devour the chalice and the trees of eternity,
attain oracular fructifications
flood of her beautiful wombs,
possess the malefic wings
her undulations emit,
fornications of the suns of night
and the moons color the day.
