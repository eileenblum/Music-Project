The pale moon's beams shine o'er Us. As together we lie in rest eternal.
A grave for two-a matrimony for the dead, two rotting bodies on their last dance macabre.

It is a dance of the dead - it is a tottentanz
for My sadness, your blood, our breath
and our hearts entwined beat the rythim.

It is a sacred Marriage,
It is a mystery of two bodies, one gravestone, and countless offspring living from Us.

"The timid Bride removed, the matrimonial veil of her vestality and between the dog and wolf, the Groom entered the gateless yet rotten gate."
Hieros Gamos is now sanctified.
