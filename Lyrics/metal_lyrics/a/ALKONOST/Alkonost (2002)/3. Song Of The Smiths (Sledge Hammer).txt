Magic of flames, spirit of water
Iron gods and mighty wizards
Merged and forged to make other world
Great new world, the world of steel

Hammer and anvil, muscles and force
Together they're making plough and swords
All what is needed for life and death
Our world is creating in

Sledge hammer you strike stronger
Steel you become form tempered

To be the a blacksmith is as to be a priest
You need to consort with the spirits
Play 'em and guide and hold them in hands
Great new world, the world of steel

Magic of flames, spirit of water
Iron gods and mighty wizards
Merged and forged]
