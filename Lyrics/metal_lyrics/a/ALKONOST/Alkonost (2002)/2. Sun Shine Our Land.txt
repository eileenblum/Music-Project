I'm coming back in to bright lands
From the past times sleeping in darkness
"Stop your roaming", call the fathers
Who keep the Time in bright lands

Sunshine our land - dispersing the dark
Restore the motion of the times
Sunshine our land - filling with fire
Faith of tribes in sunny lands

Keeping a secret word in the stones
Hiding decay of wills in the barrows
Winds which rustle in crowns of trees
Disturbing the Memory they will revive it.

Sunshine our land - dispersing the dark
Restore the motion of the times
Sunshine our land - filling with fire
Faith of tribes in sunny lands
