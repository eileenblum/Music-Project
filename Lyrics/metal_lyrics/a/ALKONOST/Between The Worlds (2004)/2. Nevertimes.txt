Sun's down skyline
Nignt is crawling long
Time have no stopped
Night came stone-cold

Can't keep me warm
Those stars in far space
Clad in snow ground
And trees lifeless

Spiteful blizzard
Howls in deadly night
Howl meant to freeze
Like wolf's despair

Can't give reprieve
Those towns abandoned
Flame can no more
Save me from fate

Towns are desert
All around the world
Lands was in ruin
For long ago

Faltered time
Past died like iceform
All was taken
By flame of heaven

All scattered are nests now
And memory's filled by dreams
They'll give me drink cold venom
They'll burn me with the vain hope

You can't get back the wind
And ashes can't revive fire
In heavenly keen flare

Tears are scanty
Heart is made of stone
Sprouts are lifeless
On fields that boundless
