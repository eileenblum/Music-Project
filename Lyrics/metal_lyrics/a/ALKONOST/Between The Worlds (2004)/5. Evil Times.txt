Light of Sun hidden by smoke
Water of black fills the rivers
Animal hides in its lair
Bird don't sing in the sky

And hard years like wind
Impetuous
Had broke my life sorrowfull
Don't go round my shelter
Like black bird, you, bad news

Unexpected death
Here had came to me
It had call with it
Driving into flames

Parched by the light
Capturing by dark
I'll return on sword
Being my own master

I see you in my dreams
Mother my, you, Magozh
Give me strength to stand up
Years of distemper

Don't you abandon me
Amid mortal foes
Cover you my sword now
From the evil spells

Unexpected death
Here had came to me
It had call with it
Driving into flames

Parched by the light
Capturing by dark
I'll return on sword
Being my own master
