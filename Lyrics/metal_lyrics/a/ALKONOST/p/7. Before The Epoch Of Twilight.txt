Dark of the Night
My scream will piers like arrow
And trees of the forest
Will let out veiled word

And secret word is proud
Winds whisper up to Heaven
And fire take and hide
Heart what was tormented

I dont know
No other days
My Light went out
In soils blood

Burning Land
Filled with blood
Shine of swords had
Turn back rivers

Light is fading
From my eyes
Face of Sun went dark
In the Heaven

Dark is my gaze
And soothsayers threaten misfortune
And anew the foe descendes
On our forts with great force

And foe this have no face
His strength is in the dim words
He makes mind drunk with lie
And put folk into irons

Blackened sun's face
Will herald the death
And with fire will go
Power of my words

Sword hadn't taste
Blood of brothers
And my rebellious spirit
Is clean to Heaven

Burning Land
Filled with blood
Shine of swords had
Turn back rivers

Light is fading
From my eyes
Face of Sun went dark
In the Heaven

Wind, wind awaits
Light of my legends
In breath of star's

Singing, singing of past days
Pain of my heart
Torment of my torments

Winnow ashes mine
One who came behind
One who came with cross

Wind, wind awaits
Light of my legends
In breath of stars
