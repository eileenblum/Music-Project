Over forests' wall
In the rivers glass
In a gloomy field
Fire burns unhide

And the voice calls from faraway
Whispers over threshold

As a hostile arrow
Pain pierce my heart
Senses mine
Will befog just a bit

And the darken waters' shadows
Will reveal veiled face

They will lighten me
And will guide my path
Distant lands
Are waiting me

But in wandering there's no shelter
There's no repose

Distant, distant voice will
Call beyond, call me over threshold

But in wandering there's no shelter
There's no repose
But in wandering there's no shelter
There's no repose

Years that had gone for now-
Leafage-like under snow-cover
Days that will not return-
Clouds' shade-like they're flying over

And ahead is just void-
Luring presentiment
Waits unremittingly
It will envelop me

And I'll be lost, I'll perish, I'll die.
