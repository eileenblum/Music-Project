You're sitting in saddle
Your horse moving hardly
Your blood keeps on running from wounds
The battle was cruel

You were killed and your way
You ancestors wait in limbs of the Eternity Oak
They will greet you with a cup full of beer
And their faces shall light up with joy

Your last breath was down now
Your spirit released from your body
And it sets on in journey
To the distance along near

And the birds flew away bringing bad news around
That you're killed in a battle
That your wife and your kids never see you again
And you'll never go cultivate you'r native land

They will find your body
And burn it away
They'll do funeral fest on you
Sing the funeral song...

(...They will see you off on your last way
Down by Eternity River
Then you'll meet all you Fathers..)
