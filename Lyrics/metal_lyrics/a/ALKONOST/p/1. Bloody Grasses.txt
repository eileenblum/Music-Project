There had winds arise
They made clouds so dark
In the storm-sky
In the black mirk

Then they had strip up
Drowsy fields of grass
And prophetic stars
Fall from sky

Open to me gates
Let me know the secrets
Or will weakly fall
Three of Universe

Waiting is my life
Under snow of ash
Like this blood red
River my flow

Veiled dream prophetic
Will occurs like shadow
In the abysstime
It will vanish from the life

I see blood
On the grass
I see blood
In the blaze

There had winds arise
They made clouds so dark
In the storm-sky
In the black mirk

Then they had strip up
Drowsy fields of grass
And prophetic stars
Fall from sky
