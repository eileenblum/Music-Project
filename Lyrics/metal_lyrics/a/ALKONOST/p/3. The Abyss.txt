My sight is dimmed
Tears are still alive
No one will
Mourn my soul

Heart will rouse a song
Pain of hope will burn
Like a wounded bird
With the broken wing

Can't find me home
In my native land
Have no kin
Among live men

Brothers fall in fight,
Underground they lie
Gloomy life of mine
Leave me now with cry

Like the abyss
My life became to me

Oh, don't flow
Like scalding water
Words my into tears-
Sorrow is unspoken

Path is lying across ashes
Show me way, wind

Somewhere in legends
In the heavens leas
I will live forever
With my new hope

Like the abyss
My life became to me

Oh, don't flow
Like scalding water
Words my into tears-
Sorrow is unspoken

Oh, don't flow
Like scalding water
Words my into tears -
Sorrow is unspoken
