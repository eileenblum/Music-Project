Standing in my own cemetary

Standing in my own cemetary
Knowing that my back is to the wall
I am heading for the old mortuary
Where everyone knows I stand tall
Through my life's convictions you
Know I've seen it all everyone I've
Buried their faces have turned to stone

[Pre-Chorus:]
Spend a little time standing
In the line of the whising
Well wondering if I'll ever
See the light of day

Spend a little time
Starring at the mirror
But it's all over now
Don't you think I've got
Much left to say

[Chorus:]
Give a little time - Cemetary
Give a little time - Undertaker
Give a little time - Mortuary
Give a little time - Widowmaker

Standing in my own cemetary
Everyone knows I will fall
Living in the old mortuary
Waiting on the beckon call
Through my life's convictions
No one sees me at all holding
A burden I carry I know I must
Stand tall

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Spend a little time
Spend a little time
Spend a little time
Spend a little time

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Standing in my own cemetary

I stand alone
