When you think you know the truth its destiny
That you fall into a deadly game the mighty oak
Grows from the seed, born in fire will you burn
The same, fire

A coward dies a thousand deaths
For all to see buried in the shame
A soldier spends his blood upon the battlefield

[1st Chorus:]
Walk in the fire no fear and when the
Smoke has all cleared breath in the
Embers of your desire walk into the fire

You will not see the truth it
Will not be clear you will
Not feel the flames as it
Burns your tears, fire

[Solo]

[2nd Chorus:]
Breath in the fire of life
Cutting you like a knife
Hold up the candle of sacred light
Walk into the fire

When you think you know the truth its destiny
That you fall into a deadly game the mighty oak
Grows from the seed, born in fire will you burn
The same, fire

[1st Chorus]
