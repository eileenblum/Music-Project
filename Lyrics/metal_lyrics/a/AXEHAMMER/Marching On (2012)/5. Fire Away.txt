[Verse 1:]
Seize the night
Charging thru the light
With fire in your eyes
Pushing on
You know it won't be long
When you realize oh yeahh!!

[Verse 2:]
Stories told
About the times of old
Of warriors brave and true

Hold the sword, never let it go
That fights for me and you

[Pre-Chorus:]
And long before they realize
Death is on it's way

[Chorus:]
Fire away, fire away
Stand up and fire away

[Verse 3:]
Read the scrowls
As history unfolds
About the bloody past
And the cost
Of kingdom's burned and lost
And victory at last

Angel's flying to the battle
Field strike out, strike out, fire
Away time to deal with what is
Real strike out, strike out, fire away

[Solo/Pre-Chorus/Chorus/Verse 1/Pre-Chorus (X2) Chorus (X2]
