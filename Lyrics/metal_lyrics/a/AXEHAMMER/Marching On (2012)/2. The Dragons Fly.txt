Like a shadow in the night
Looking for the morning light, to appear
With the sunrise comes the beast
Spreading pestilence and death
The dragon feasts

With the moonlight comes the fear
Waiting for the enemy to appear
A thousand evils we will face
We will see them die in their disgrace

[Chorus:]
The dragon flies
Spreading flies
Spreading the wings
That terrorize
He Breaths the fire
Burning the lies from their eyes

With the sun light comes the peace
Warriors of the light have killed the beast
One more battle now is won
The fight for mankind has just began

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Like a shadow in the night
Looking for the morning light, to appear
With the sunrise comes the beast
Spreading pestilence and death
The dragon feasts

With the moonlight comes the fear
Waiting for the enemy to appear
A thousand evils we will face
We will see them die in their disgrace

[Chorus]

The warrior prince flies
Shining his sword, he shines blue fire
The dragon flies
Burning the lies from their eyes
