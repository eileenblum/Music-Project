Flesh, flesh, flesh, flesh
Flesh machine

[Verse 1:]
Welcome to future world
And all the lies
We're only living to be victimized
Welcome to future world
And broken hearts
And all your dreams that have been
Torn apart

Flesh machine
Flesh machine

[Verse 2:]
There's truth in future world
But you have to buy it
We're all just working for the beast
No love in future world
No good in trying
We feed the looters at their feast

[Chorus:]
Welcome to the days
When all your dreams and sorrow
Finally fade away
Welcome to the days

Welcome to the days
When all your bright tomorrows
Are finally stripped away
Welcome to the days
Flesh

[Solo]

Flesh machine [2X]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

Flesh machine [3X]

Flesh/Machine [4X]
