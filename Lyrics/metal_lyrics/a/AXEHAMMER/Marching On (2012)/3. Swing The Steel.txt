Book of souls through the ages
Tearing out all the pages
Fell my heart, wanting to fly away
Dark is the night Trying to find
My way to the light fighting darkness
With all my might, chasing the dogs of hell

I shall pour my rage upon you
Hear my call by my sword you'll fall
I will bring to you abomination and death
When the angels are down tonight
All the demons are out of my sight
Hiding from the light traveling back to hell

[Pre-Chorus:]
Rise up the axe and let it fly
Felling the power I will

[Chorus:]
Swing the steel
Let it fly away
Swing the steel
Let them die

Swing the steel

[Solo]

Book of souls through the ages
Tearing out all the pages
Fell my heart, wanting to fly away
Dark is the night Trying to find
My way to the light fighting darkness
With all my might, chasing the dogs of hell

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
[Repeat]

Swing the steel
