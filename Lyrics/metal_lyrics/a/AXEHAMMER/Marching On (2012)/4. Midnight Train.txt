[Verse 1]
Are you ready to finally take the
Trip to leave your past behind now
You're waiting ticket in your hand
To move on down the line

[Pre-Chorus 1:]
It's new day the sun
Is shining bright
It's a new day, we all ride

[Verse 2:]
Like the lightning come before the
Thunder its an awesome sound
You're a free man you don't need
Someone to come and save you now

[Pre-Chorus:]
You're escaping all that came before
Now you're ready, ready to ride

[Chorus:]
Midnight, midnight, train out of hell

[Repeat]

[Solo]

[Verse 1]

[Pre-Chorus 2]

[Chorus]
