"When you walk through the valley
of the shadows
You'll come across and do battle
With the lord of the realm!"

The time is right
To stand up and fight
Against the lord of the realm
So draw your blade of stand aside
Do not try to hide
Run for your life
'Cause he's got the night
You can't seem to get away
But if you try to run from him
He'll cut you down just the same
Born to fight with all your might
Against the lord of the realm
You can't see what it's got to be
Fighting it out with the lord

You're riding through the black forest
You came across his home
He'll try to get the best from you
You overtake his throne
Move to the left, step to the right
You'll feel him standing there
He'll cut you down with lightning speed
When you're on your own
Born to fight with all your might
Against the lord of the realm
You can't see what it's got to be
Fighting it out with the lord

Realm

Born to fight with all your might
Against the lord of the realm
You can't see what it's got to be
Fighting it out with the lord

He'll cut you down just the same
Born to fight with all your might
Against the lord of the realm
You can't see what it's got to be
Fighting it out with the lord

Fighting it out with the lord
With the lord
Of the...realm
