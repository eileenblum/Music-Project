I met a gypsy in my dreams
Her face was old and wise
"Son", she said, "give up your pride,
the wall of your disguise"

"The road is paved with broken souls
You've had your share of falls
It's time to stand on broken legs
and break down some walls"

Break down some walls [4x]

Well I saw her standing in the sunlight
She told me to move away
I've got this special feeling
That brought me here today
Everybody is trying to tell me she's gone
I've seen it all before
Step on it, look in the eyes
And break down his walls

[Chorus]:
Break down, break down the walls
Break down, break down the walls

There's evil that surrounds me
Got to break away
The magic that has found us
I cannot let it stay
Should of listened before, you know
There's no other way out
Jump on in and look in the eyes
and blow it out

[Chorus]:
Break down, break down the walls
Break down, break down the walls

It's moving behind me
Trying to get away
I set fire to his tail
And plunge him back to hell
She's moving through the hallways
As fast as a ring of a bell
The light in her eyes has disappeared
We broke down his walls

[Chorus]:
Break down, break down the walls
Break down, break down the walls
