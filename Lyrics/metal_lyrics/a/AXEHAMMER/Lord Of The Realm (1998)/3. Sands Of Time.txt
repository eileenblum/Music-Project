No one ever turns his back on the
sands of time
They can feel it in the air
Their life just doesn't rhyme
Is it rhyme or reason
No one knows the truth
I'm the only one that knows
And I can see it too...

[Chorus]:
Stop the sands of time (time)
Stop the sands of time

Who is that feeds the dream
When you're fast asleep
Who is it that wakes you
When the nightmare appears
I can see the flame
If you hold it up in the air
I can see the eye of the future
It says to me to...

[Chorus]:
Stop the sands of time (time)
Stop the sands of time

Walking with the angels
[Chorus]:
Stop the sands of time (time)
Stop the sands of time

When you see the children cry
Does it make you weep
You should be at home yourself
Lying fast asleep
When you see the lightning flash
That moves across the sky
Do you sit for hours and hours
Trying to wonder why

[Chorus]:
Stop the sands of time (time)
Stop the sands of time
