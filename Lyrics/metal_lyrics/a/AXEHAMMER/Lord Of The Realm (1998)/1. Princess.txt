When you walk through the desert
Feel the rays of the sun
She's got you on the move
When all the damage is done
The princess of darkness
Drops down from the sky
No time to turn
It's your turn to die
It does not matter
She cuts right through steel
You are not dreaming
You'll know it's real

[Chorus]:
Princess
She's dressed to kill
Princess
Firing at will

When you turn the corner
Guess who is standing there
The princess of darkness
You better beware
Your time has come
Time to pay your dues
No time to run
What are you gonna do
It does not matter
She cuts right through steel
You are not dreaming
You know it's real

[Chorus]:
Princess
She's dressed to kill
Princess
Firing at will

When you walk through the desert
Feel the rays of the sun
She's got you on the move
When all the damage is done
The princess of darkness
Drops down from the sky
No time to turn
It's your turn to die
It does not matter
She cuts right through steel
You are not dreaming
You'll know it's real
