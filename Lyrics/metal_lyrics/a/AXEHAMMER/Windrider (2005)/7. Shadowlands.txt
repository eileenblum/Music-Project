Dancing round the fire
To replace a king
Moving through the darkness
Like you've never seen

Do you feel it in the night
Something's moving
Like a candle burning bright
Don't let the gloom in
Oh oh oh oh shadowlands

Spirits all around you
Taking your breath away
Moving in to take you
At the break of day

Can you feel it in the night
Always moving
Burn your candle late at night
They can't get in
Oh oh oh oh shadowlands

The faces that haunt you
Coming in the night
Demons there upon you
Staying out of sight

Do you see them in the night
Moving all around you
Come to take your soul at night
Don't you let go
Oh oh oh oh shadowlands
