From the waterfalls of the mind
You find yourself trying to find
Things that you know can't be found
Turn away fast and look around

In my dreams I see your face
What they said was a total disgrace
Looking for someone
To clean my soul
I see my face it starts to unfold

I start to feel
That I'm travelling backwards
Trying to find someone I can't see
Feel the waters raining down on me
Cooming here to set my soul free
Evil is surrounding me
No place to hide
See my future pass
Along with the tide
See the waters splash before me
Cleaning, touching it enters my soul

Ohohohoho

Sacred waters
Glistening in the night
Sacred waters
Shimmering in the light
Oh oh future's not bright
Oh oh step into the light

Sacred waters

Every night I hear them cry
Flying spirits up in the sky
Searching for the sacred waters
If time passes, they will die

I feel the waters dripping on my face
In my dreams I see the disgrace
I found the secret to free my soul
It's been in many stories new and old

Oh oh

Sacred waters
Glistening in the night
Sacred waters
Shimmering in the light
Oh oh future's not bright
Oh oh step into the light

Oh oh

Sacred waters
