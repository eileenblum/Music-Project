Look inside yourself
You might find something you like
Take your dreams above the horizon
And you shall see

A curse that runs very deep
To a rainbow with no gold
Fly high my child
For you may be the next king

Can you feel it, really feel it
Feel the power yeah yeah
Can you feel it, really feel it
Feel the power hell yeah

Warriors to fight for you
To put you in the throne
No one can hurt you
You will never be alone

Time is on our side
Before the break of dawn
The spirit in my soul
Feels like it is gone

Can you feel it, really feel it
Feel the power yeah yeah
Can you feel it, really feel it
Feel the power hell yeah

Can you feel it, really feel it
Feel the power yeah yeah
Can you feel it, really feel it
Feel the power hell yeah

Lines in the sand behind you
You can't see
Move to the light of being
Without me

Control the madness
That takes my mind
Search yourself again
And you will find

Can you feel it, really feel it
Feel the power yeah yeah
Can you feel it, really feel it
Feel the power hell yeah

Oh Oh Oh Oh
Can you feel it
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Can you feel it
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Can you feel it
Oh Oh Oh Oh
Can you feel it
