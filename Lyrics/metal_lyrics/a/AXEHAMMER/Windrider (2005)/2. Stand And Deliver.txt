What can you tell me
About the future and past
Black clouds above you
Moving away so fast

Who can deliver
All the lies you've been fed
No one will tell me
You're walking with the dead
Oh oh oh oh

Runnin', hidin', stealin'
Moving away in the night

No promises tomorrow
No lies without the sorrow
We shake the time today
Soon they'll take us away

Dark shadows chase you
Around every corner tonight
When do you see them
All over and out of sight

No light in the future
It's running all around you
Running from your nightmare
No escape for you
Oh oh oh oh

Runnin', hidin', stealin'
Moving away in the night

What can you tell me
About the future and past
Black clouds above you
Moving away so fast

Who can deliver
All the lies you've been fed
No one will tell me
You're walking with the dead
Oh oh oh oh

Runnin', hidin', stealin'
Moving away in the night
Oh oh oh oh
