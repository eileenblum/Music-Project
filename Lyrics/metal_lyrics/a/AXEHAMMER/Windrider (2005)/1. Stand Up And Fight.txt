He's on the attack
Won't turn his back
So run like hell
You heathens

Flies through the air
With no one to care
So stand up and fight

To search and destroy
He won't be coy
He's comin' for you
You cowards

Climb back in your hole
Before he takes your soul
Hurry here it comes

Stand up and fight for your soul
Don't wait 'til you get too old
Stand up and fight
Stand up and fight

It's death to the max
Feel the attacks
So run like hell
Up for treason

Move away from death
Don't hold your way
Comin' your way

World's full of sin
Story to begin
Move like the wind
The four horsemen

Stories been told
But we fear the old
Stand up and fight

Stand up and fight for your soul
Don't wait 'til you get too old
Stand up and fight
Stand up and fight

Stand up and fight for your soul
Don't wait 'til you get too old
Stand up and fight
Stand up and fight

It's death to the max
Feel the attacks
So run like hell
Up for treason

Move away from death
Don't hold your way
Comin' your way

World's full of sin
Story to begin
Move like the wind
The four horsemen

Stories been told
But we fear the old
Stand up and fight

Stand up and fight for your soul
Don't wait 'til you get too old
Stand up and fight
Stand up and fight

Stand up and fight
Stand up and fight for your soul
