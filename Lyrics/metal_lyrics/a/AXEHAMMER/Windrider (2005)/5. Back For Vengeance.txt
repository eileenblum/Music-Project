They killed my wife and took my son
This rage in my heart has now begun
You can run but you can't hide
Death is with me, by my side

Back for vengeance
Watch your death in my eyes
Back for vengeance
Gone in the blink of an eye

Your future lies within my hands
I'll chase you down as fast as I can
Bring back my son before it's too late
My sword will send you
TO hell's gate

Back for vengeance
Watch your death in my eyes
Back for vengeance
Gone in the blink of an eye

Out of the darkness
And into the light
A fire burns below
Out of the grave and into the night
Let's go, let's go

Back for vengeance
Watch your death in my eyes
Back for vengeance
Gone in the blink of an eye

Now this vengeance is my only friend
But is it my trial to begin
Rapid and killing is a sin
But is it wrong to kill again

Back for vengeance
Watch your death in my eyes
Back for vengeance
Gone in the blink of an eye
