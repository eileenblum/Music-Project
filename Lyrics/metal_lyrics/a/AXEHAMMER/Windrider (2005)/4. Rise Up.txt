The four horsemen are doing battle
With the jackals of the metal wasteland
Calling for the metal giant
To rise up

It's been a restful sleep
He's back to take control
He moves his metal feet
It's been so long ago

To retake the throne
That was once our own
So rise up

Movin' fast and free
Streaking through the air
The evil all around
He's the only one who cares

To retake the throne
That was once our own
So rise up

They cannot live without it
They scream and shout about it
Their time will come
Just wait and see

Running through the streets
Stay out of his way

He feels your heart beat
World starting to decay

To retake the throne
That was once our own
So rise up

He feels your heart beat
Running through the streets
There is no delay
He's coming home today

To retake the throne
That was once our own
So rise up
