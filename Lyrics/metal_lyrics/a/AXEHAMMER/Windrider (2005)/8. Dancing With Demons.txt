As I fall to sleep
I always see them in my dreams
The nightmare wakes me
As I start to scream

I opened the gates
To a god awful place
Demons came running to see
Step to the right
To move out of sight
They came flying by me

Darkness falls at a mighty fast pace
Red eyes are staring at me
I run like hell to the sound of a bell
I'm standing at the gates of hell

Try to free their souls
It's hard to behold
Demons they've watching me
Time for me to run
They know what I've done
They try to capture me

It's a bitter sweet hell
You can never tell
Who's behind every dream
It's a terrible smell at the gates of hell
Time running out for me

I opened the gates
To a god awful place
Demons came running to see
Step to the right
To move out of sight
They came flying by me

Darkness falls at a mighty fast pace
Red eyes are staring at me
I run like hell to the sound of a bell
I'm standing at the gates of hell

I hear crying in the night
The spirits are in flight
They are spinning all around me
Dancing with demons you see

I hear crying in the night
The spirits are in flight
They are spinning all around me
Dancing with demons you see

Dancing with demons you see
Dancing with demons you see
Dancing with demons you see
