It moves in behind you
Too slow it will find you
The stars in the sky
You sit and wonder why

With time it's forsaken
Your memory awakens
Bright light in your eyes
Running through the night

Darkness is upon you
It moves in to shake you
Streaks in the night
It's the destiny of light

Shadows they move with you
They try to confuse you
Moving through the madness
Step into the light

You know it may blind you
Don't let it forsake you
Moving with the shadows
To the destiny of light

It's energy drains you
In life it will strain you
Step into the darkness
See the destiny of light

Time is in the distance
You know it's persistence
To take you away
Your life is up tonight

It's energy drains you
In life it will strain you
Step into the darkness
See the destiny of light

It moves in behind you
Too slow it will find you
The stars in the sky
You sit and wonder why

With time it's forsaken
Your memory awakens
Bright light in your eyes
Running through the night

Darkness is upon you
It moves in to shake you
Streaks in the night
It's the destiny of light
