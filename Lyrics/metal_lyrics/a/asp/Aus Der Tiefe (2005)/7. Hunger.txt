Down in the abyss
Down in a hole an`
Down where I drag all the dreams I've stolen

I'll eat your mind out
I'll eat your sorrow
Just stick it in and I will swallow

I have been waiting for you longer
Than you'll ever know
I have been weak but now I'm stronger
And I want you so

Feed me with your sickness! Feed me with your hearts!
No one knows where it will end or when it starts
Feed me with your darkness! Feed me with your pain!
All my nasty little friends tonight we will be unchained.

I'll sip your soul in
Wake your desire
I am the promise and a liar

Show me your hands and
No misbehaving
I'll pin the wire and youÂ´ll be waving

You will be wrapped around
my finger yes I know for sure
You will be trapped in your disease
And I am not the cure

Feed me with your sickness! Feed me with your hearts!
No one knows where it will end or when it starts
Feed me with your darkness! Feed me with your pain!
All my nasty little friends tonight we will be unchained.

Well, all you lovely children
Start to feel and stop to think
Thank god for your bewilderment
And force your eyes to blink

Say, all you little fellows
Don't you know where you belong
Come down here in my cellar
Dance with me and join my song

Be good and stop to struggle
Dangling on your puppet strings
Hush hush my babies snuggle
In the nest under my wings

Say, all you little fellows
Don't you know where you belong
Come down here in my cellar
Dance with me and join my song

Feed me with your sickness! Feed me with your hearts!
No one knows where it will end or when it starts
Feed me with your darkness! Feed me with your pain!
All my nasty little friends tonight we will be unchained.
