I know when Iâm gone the full tragic truth will also die
And there fore their being at last will have been but a lie?
If no-one is left to remember their sorrowful story?
When nobody tells the sad tale? No-oneâs there to be sorry
Imagine a night, stygian black while youâre cosy and warm
Imagine the howling of some ineluctable storm
So if you are ready and Iâve got your outright attention
Iâm ready to unveil the story of old Foremar Mansion
Where a family lived long ago â but what makes it so weird
Is not that they lived there but rather that they disappeared
There wasnât a soul from the great hall to the smallest pantry
The great Foremar manor henceforward forever stood empty

They lived in house built on dreams and built if burnt bricks
Tatted up, impressed by themselves as they swaggered
Gave a home to many good friends and to some rascal tricks
Sirens lured, could it be that they followed and staggered

Did they care for anyone else except for themselves?
So why should anyone care for them now
Empty rooms, not very much left on the old rotten shelves
They ended in smoke but you cannot say now

But they all are long since gone
Itâs a riddle what went wrong
Scarcely anyone knows that they ever lied here
Nor do we know why they disappeared
Why they all have long since gone

Maybe there lived too many monsters under their stairs
We donât know if they all were led or were banished
Did they see stranger eyes in the night that gave them a stare?
Did they feel just head over heals as they vanished

No-one knows if they were driven or if they were led
Dusty rooms, no more servants to clear away plates
Did they cry or did they move on without any regrets
No farewells, no more talks and no boring debates

But they all are long since gone
Itâs a riddle what went wrong
Scarcely anyone knows that they ever lived here
Nor do we know why they disappeared
Why they all have long since gone

The only things found were remains
Of the poor chained unwanted cousin
He had been slightly insane
From below stairs there was babbling and buzzing
He just didnât suit, couldnât fit
So he was locked up in the cellar
Displeasing he sat in the pit
Until he passed, poor little fella

But they all are long since gone
Itâs a riddle what went wrong
Scarcely anyone knows that they ever lived here
Nor do we know why they disappeared
Why they all have long since gone

â¦???

But they all are long since gone
Itâs a riddle what went wrong

But they all are long since gone
Itâs a riddle what went wrong
Scarcely anyone knows that they ever lived here
Nor do we know why they disappeared
Why they all have long since gone

But they all have long since gone
Itâs a riddle what went wrong
So what, drove them away, no-one ever can say
And the only thing we know today
Is that they didnât stay
