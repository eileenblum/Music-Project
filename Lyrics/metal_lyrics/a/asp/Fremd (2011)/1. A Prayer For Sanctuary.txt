Like the haunting chants and prayers to which Iâve never listened
Thou shalt no longer live in chains or ever be imprisoned
Ease my always throbbing heart I shall no longer falter
As pupae to imagines all images must alter

Let thy glory shine on me, disperse my obfuscation
Hide thy essence in myself, I need assimilation
Stream thyself into my soul and flood it with thy yearning
Pour thy soul into my shell, erase my restless burning

I hear voices of a stranger
I hear voices of a stranger
I hear voices of a stranger
I hear voices in my head, echoing

I hear voices of a stranger
I hear voices of a stranger
I hear voices of a stranger
I hear voices in my head, echoing
