I see their naked bodies dancing in the blue and black lights
and wonder when the first will fall
I see the eyes wide open and the tongues that lick some lips
the shadows how theyÂ´re creeping on the wall

There are those nights we want to rip our skin off
just to feel that we are we are still alive
all angels left us left us all alone
there are those nights we can no longer wait
for an accident love or lover
we are the lost ones searching for a home

I see their faces hollow smiles
I see the shadows on the tiles
Dancing... on the wall

Not even when they kiss or when they touch each other with their hands
not even then they stop the dance
erotic nightmare all the bodies are so wet so beautiful
so hot so shivering lost in trance

There are those nights we want to rip our skin off
just to feel that we are we are still alive
all angels left us left us all alone
there are those nights we can no longer wait
for an accident love or lover
we are the lost ones searching for a home

I see their faces hollow smiles
I see the shadows on the tiles
Dancing... on the wall

I know weÂ´re lost because the world is cold and love has died
weÂ´re tired we can no longer bleed
so we shut out the day exuding all the madness and decay
come on there is no time to sleep

There are those nights we want to rip our skin off
just to feel that we are we are still alive
all angels left us left us all alone
there are those nights we can no longer wait
for an accident love or lover
we are the lost ones searching for a home

I see their faces hollow smiles
I see the shadows on the tiles
I see them rise I see the fall
I see them dancing on the wall

Dancing on the wall
