YouÂ´re the master we are tools
We follow your star we are the ship of fools

How can you ask whether I still love you
you know there will be no answer as we know that I do
Some mistakes one never wants to learn from and he canÂ´t
didnÂ´t you listen didnÂ´t you care donÂ´t you understand

IÂ´ve got a song for the fools
for all the imbeciles
YouÂ´re the master we are tools
We follow your star we are the ship of fools

I didnÂ´t fall in love it was love that fell on me
It just happend you just happened hard and suddenly
Some mistakes one never wants to learn from and he canÂ´t
didnÂ´t you listen didnÂ´t you care donÂ´t you understand

IÂ´ve got a song for the fools
for all imbeciles
YouÂ´re the master we are tools
We follow your star we are the ship of fools
