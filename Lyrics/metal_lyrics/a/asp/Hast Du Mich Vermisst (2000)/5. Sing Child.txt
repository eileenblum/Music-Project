Now - You will be mine
this is my time
to start a great incision
There - can only be
the light or me
so make up your decision

Black Wings I spread wide open
wipe off the cruel sun
my pale face is the moon and
let my children come

Sing child sing child
better join us sing child
sin child sin child
to make the darkness come

I - breathe in the light exhale the night
kneel down and pledge allegiance
I - will let you burn and in return
I need your full obediance

My sweat will form the new stars
I stain the sky with white
My children dance and sing
with joy and with delight

Sing child sing child
better join us sing child
sin child sin child
to make the darkness come

Sing child sing child ...
