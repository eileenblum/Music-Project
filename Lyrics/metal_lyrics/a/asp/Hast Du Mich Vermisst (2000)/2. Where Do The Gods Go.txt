Where do they go?

IÂ´m lying crying in my bed
I hear your yoice inside my head
Too scared of opening my eyes and what is there

I feel you walking through my mind
I feel you stalking from behind
I sence your presence anytime and everywhere

Where do the gods go when weÂ´re godless
tell me where do they go
Where do the lost souls fly when will we die
say where do we go

IÂ´m waiting shaking shadows crawl
My bodyÂ´s aching and I fall
I am the chosen one and only you know why

I open up my arms and turn
around and finally I learn
your name I bid you welcome my black butterfly

Where do the gods go when weÂ´re godless
tell me where do they go
Where do the lost souls fly when will we die
say where do we go

I am your every day and night
I am the pain and your delight
I am your lust and every fear
I am your laughter and your tears
I am the shadow, make you crawl
I am the one who makes you fall
I am the creeps under your skin
And even when I lose I win

Where do they go?
