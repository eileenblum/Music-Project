No kiss upon my lips, not one,
No last wish, no farewell.
No saviour came to call my name
Down here where shadows dwell.
No saviour came to call my name
I'm going straight to hell.
I'm going straight to hell.
I'm going straight to hell.

Fading away
Fading away

The nightmares flee to find the dark
A place where they can hide.
Where no light flows on paths unknown
How I wish to be at their side.

The dawn creeps in the light's still dim
The day will purify.
The night and I we have to die
As I'm the Black Butterfly.

Fading away
Fading away

The nightmares flee to find the dark
A place where they can hide.
Where no light flows on paths unknown
How I wish to be at their side.

The dawn creeps in the light's still dim
The day will purify.
The night and I we have to die
As I'm the Black Butterfly.
The night and I we have to die
As I'm the Black Butterfly.
The night and I we have to die
As I'm the Black Butterfly.
