Sing child, sing child
Better join us, sing child
Sin child, sin child
To make the darkness come...

Now - you will be mine
This is my time
To start a great incision
There - can only be
The light or me
So make up your decision

Black wings I spread wide open
Wipe off the cruel sun
My pale face is the moon and
Let my children come

Sing child, sing child
Better join us, sing child
Sin child, sin child
To make the darkness come

Sing child, sing child
Better join us, sing child
Sin child, sin child
To make the darkness come

I - breathe in the light exhale the night
Kneel down and pledge allegiance
I - will let you burn and in return
I need your full obedience

My sweat will form the new stars
I stain the sky with white
My children dance and sing
With joy and with delight

Sing child, sing child
Better join us, sing child
Sin child, sin child
To make the darkness come

Sing child, sing child
Better join us, sing child
Sin child, sin child
To make the darkness come

Sing child, sing child
Better join us, sing child
Sin child, sin child
To make the darkness come

Sing child, sing child
Better join us, sing child
Sin child, sin child
To make the darkness come

Sing child, sing child
Better join us, sing child
Sin child, sin child
To make the darkness come

Sing child, sing child
Now - you will be mine
Better join us, sing child
This is my time
Sin child, sin child
To start a great incision
To make the darkness come

Sing child, sing child
There - can only be
Better join us, sing child
The light or me
Sin child, sin child
So make up your decision
To make the darkness come

Sing child, sing child
I - breathe in the light exhale the night
Better join us, sing child
Sin child, sin child
Kneel down and pledge allegiance
To make the darkness come

Sing child, sing child
I - will let you burn and in return
Better join us, sing child
Sin child, sin child
I need your full obedience
To make the darkness come
