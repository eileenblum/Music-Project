You're the master, we're your tools
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools
You're the master, we're your tools
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools
You're the master, we're your tools
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools
You're the master, we're your tools
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools

How can you ask whether I still love you?
You know there will be no answer as we know that I do
Some mistakes one never wants to learn from and he can't
Didn't you listen? Didn't you care? Don't you understand?

I've got a song for the fools
You're the master we are tools
For all the imbeciles
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools

I've got a song for the fools
You're the master we are tools
For all the imbeciles
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools

I didn't fall in love, it was love that fell on me
It just happend, you just happened hard and suddenly
Some mistakes one never wants to learn from and he can't
Didn't you listen? Didn't you care? Don't you understand?

I've got a song for the fools
You're the master we are tools
For all the imbeciles
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools

I've got a song for the fools
You're the master we are tools
For all the imbeciles
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools

You're the master, we're your tools
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools
You're the master, we're your tools
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools
You're the master, we're your tools
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools
You're the master, we're your tools
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools
You're the master, we're your tools
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools

I've got a song for the fools
You're the master we are tools
For all the imbeciles
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools

I've got a song for the fools
You're the master we are tools
For all the imbeciles
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools

I've got a song for the fools
You're the master we are tools
For all the imbeciles
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools

You're the master, we're your tools
For all the imbeciles
We follow your star, we are the ship of fools

You're the master
