I wonder when I'll hit the ground
It's said what goes up must come down
But sometimes it's the other way round
I'm drowned with tears and sure I'm drowned

Like a lover cover you
And keep you safe from me
Maybe

I'm on the run from the past
I'm on the run from the past
And I try to be free
To throw off your spell from me
To get back my soul from you at last

Although you hurt me to the core
I'm crawling back for an encore
So touch me gently wipe the floor
With me again I still need more

Like a slave, you lock me in
And throw away the key
Maybe

I'm on the run from the past
I'm on the run from the past
And I try to be free
To throw off your spell from me
To get back my soul from you at last

Maybe I will fly into the sun
And I'll fly to the moon into a tantrum
Maybe there will be a time when I come back
Down upon you
