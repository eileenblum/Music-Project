I see their naked bodies dancing in the blue and black lights,
And wonder when the first will fall.
I see the eyes wide open and the tongues that lick some lips;
The shadows how they're creeping up the wall.

There are those nights we want to rip our skin off,
Just to feel that we are, we are still alive.
All angels left us, left us all alone.
There are those nights we can no longer wait 
For an accident love or lover.
We are the lost ones searching for a home.

I see their faces: hollow smiles,
I see the shadows on the tiles.

Dancing.
Dancing on the wall.

Not even when they kiss, or when they touch each other with their hands,
Not even then they stop to dance.
Erotic nightmare, all the bodies are so wet, so beautiful,
So hot, so shivering, lost in trance.

There are those nights we want to rip our skin off,
Just to feel that we are, we are still alive.
All angels left us, left us all alone.
There are those nights we can no longer wait 
For an accident love or lover.
We are the lost ones searching for a home.

I see their faces: hollow smiles,
I see the shadows on the tiles.

Dancing.
Dancing on the wall.

I know we're lost because the world is cold and love has died.
We're tired, we can no longer bleed,
So we shut out the day exuding all the madness and decay.
Come on, there is no time to sleep!

There are those nights we want to rip our skin off,
Just to feel that we are, we are still alive.
All angels left us, left us all alone.
There are those nights we can no longer wait 
For an accident love or lover.
We are the lost ones searching for a home.

I see their faces: hollow smiles,
I see the shadows on the tiles.
I see them rise, I see them fall,
I see them dancing on the wall.

Dancing.
Dancing on the wall.

On the wall, I see them dancing.
On the wall, I see them dancing.
On the wall, I see them dancing.
