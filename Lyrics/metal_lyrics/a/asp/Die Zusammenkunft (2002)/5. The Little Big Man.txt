They say that home is where there's
Someone waiting, waiting for you.
I think I've got none then if these words
Should be really true.
Where is that candle in the window
Leading me on my way.
Where are those open doors that open
Arms that tell me to stay.

I can see your eyes.
The empty nights remind me
That I should have tried.
As you're the one to see...

The little big man, The little big man I am
The little big man, The little big man I am

I need a place to lay me down
And feel that I still exist.
I want to close my eyes and wish to be kissed
And then get kissed.
Someone to take my masks of and caress
My worn-out face.
I wonder if I ask for too much
For a single embrace.

I can see your eyes.
The empty nights remind me
That I should have tried.
As you're the one to see...

The little big man, The little big man I am
The little big man, The little big man I am

But if there was a chance it slipped away
But sure I'm going to call you up today.
By now I just can't stand you never knew
And still don't know the way I feel for you.
Need to see your eyes.
No more empty nights.
Give me just one try
And things will turn out right.
Begging, I can't stand
Another night without You,
not much of a man.
Oh, please let me out, I'm

The little big man, The little big man I am
The little big man, The little big man I am
