Streams of blood I wish I could,
But I can not turn back.
The beating of my heart is all I hear.
Know you never knew the hell I'm going to.
I cut myself again.

Going home
To the tiles

Dearest night I am not frightened anymore.
You are the one I'm waiting for. I curse the day.
I still hear the beat but you will not succeed.
This is the only way.

Going home
To the tiles

Flickering flickering lights
And blazing fires before my eyes and feel the tiles.
No sound but my thundering heart,
Lock me in and tear my pain apart.
Escape lying on the table,
Say grace and fill the parting glass again!
Close the door turn out the lights,
Lock me in and I can feel the tiles.

Going home
To the tiles
