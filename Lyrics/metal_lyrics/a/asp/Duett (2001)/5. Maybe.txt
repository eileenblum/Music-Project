I wonder when IÂ´ll hit the ground
ItÂ´s said what goes up must come down
But sometimes itÂ´s the other way round
IÂ´m drowned with tears and sure IÂ´m drowned

Like a lover cover you
And keep you safe from me
Maybe

IÂ´m on the run from the past
IÂ´m on the run from the past
And I try to be free
To throw off your spell from me
To get back my soul from you at last

Although you hurt me to the core
IÂ´m crawling back for an encore
So touch me gently wipe the floor
With me again I still need more

Like a slave, you lock me in
And throw away the key
Maybe

IÂ´m on the run from the past
IÂ´m on the run from the past
And I try to be free
To throw off your spell from me
To get back my soul from you at last

Maybe I will fly into the sun
And IÂ´ll fly to the moon into a tantrum
Maybe there will be a time when I come back
Down upon you
