Under the stairs and beyond your horizon
There lives a creature that wants to be free
Under your skin and beneath the dark water
There ascends a shining light secretly

Ah, there is blood on the horizon
Ah, and the flood comes in from the sea
Ah, and a storm behind your eyes and
Ah, there is no one left to see me

Stay where you are, don't give way to your hunger
Shivering, you stand there, it makes you yearn
For what lies hidden, a phantasmagoria
Follow the light and you'll never return

Ah, there is blood on the horizon
Ah, and the flood comes in from the sea
Ah, and a storm behind your eyes and
Ah, there is no one left to see me

Ah...
Ah...
Ah, there is blood on the horizon
Ah, and the flood comes in from the sea
Ah, and a storm behind your eyes and
Ah, there is no one left to see me
