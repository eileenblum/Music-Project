How can you ask whether I still love you?
You know there will be no answer as we know that I do
Some mistakes one never wants to learn from and he can't
Didn't you listen? Didn't you care? Won't you understand?

I've got a song for the fools
Running, I was running through the rain
Running, always running all in vain

I didn't fall in love, it was love that fell on me
It just happened, you just happened, hard and suddenly
All that you have done to me, tenderness, lies and pain
Forever buried in my heart, and nothing is in vain

I've got a song for the fools
Running, I was running through the rain
Running, always running all in vain

You're the one I see when I close my eyes
My love doesn't care, for years, for ifs and whys
Never important what you give as it would only change
The way of life I have to live, my song it may sound strange

I've got a song for the fools
Running, I was running through the rain
Running, always running all in vain
Forever
Running, hot blood running from my veins
