[From ASP &amp; Chamber "Humility" Release (2006)]This morning I put on my shirt but I didn't fit in
My clothes, like the world, seemed to shrink, made it hard to breathe in
No matter if you're a V.I.P. or you're left on the shelf
Today, all you need for real and all that you need to feel is yourself

Today I will work very hard on not working today
This fine springtime wind will blow all expectations away
Without any doubt you're upright you just have to be true
And all what you have to be your basic necessity is you

Goodbye to the postman, to my friends at the bank
Cross-eyed neighbours farewell and good luck
I'm leaving today finally I'm on my way
Nothing else counts and I don't give a [yeeaaaah]

Oh once in a lifetime we're together
Oh once in a lifetime is today
Oh once no storm or dirty weather
Oh will stop me once I am on my way

We sailed on the clouds dashed between the stars as if we were blind
Once in a lifetime we'll leave all the jetsam behind
It's high time to come down again and to set yourself free
Just use your ability your utmost humility and see

Goodbye to the postman, to my friends at the bank
Cross-eyed neighbours farewell and good luck
I'm leaving today finally I'm on my way
Nothing else counts and I don't give a [yeeaaaah]

Oh once in a lifetime we're together
Oh once in a lifetime is today
Oh once no storm or dirty weather
Oh will stop me once I am on my way

So what's all the noise for I just need a voice
And some singing for you just a bit
I just need a little guitar and a fiddle
Nothing else counts and I don't give a shit

Oh once in a lifetime we're together
Oh once in a lifetime is today
Oh once no storm or dirty weather
Oh will stop me once I am on my way
....me once I am on my way
