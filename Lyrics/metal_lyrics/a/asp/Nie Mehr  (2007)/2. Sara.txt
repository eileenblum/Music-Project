Here we go again my lovely vampire queen
Ready for your nightly theft
Feel the flow and take my hand and lick me clean
Can't you see there's nothing left

We transfuse elixirs while we are seeking cure
Sins we never can atone
We confuse the mixtures never to be pure
So we'll never be alone

Prickling scars and flickering stars
I wonder if we have gone too far
And if we both will ever see the light
Trickling kisses, licking, hisses
Maddening immortal bliss
Lasts only while the moon is shining bright

Sara
Oh Sara could it be love at first bite
Oh Sara, Sara can't you hear my song
I can't wait till we are united
You are the star to light my night
You make me dream of you the whole day long

Here we go again my lovely vampire queen
We change for better or for worse
I don't know or care as long as you're with me
Both a blessing and a curse

Hypnotizing lips and eyes
I'm sinking and the nighttime flies
Until at last the world stops turning round
Possessed by never lessening powers
I metamorphose while the hours
pass, and we are never broken down

Sara
Oh Sara could it be love at first bite
Oh Sara, Sara can't you hear my song
I can't wait till we are united
You are the star to light my night
You make me dream of you the whole day long

Total interpenetration and
Eternal circulation
Empty and recharge our battery
Delight in highest concentration

We achieve reincarnation
While we are in mortal agony
Appetite, no limitation
Girl you are my revelation
I will be you, love, and you will be me

Sara
Oh Sara could it be love at first bite
Oh Sara, Sara can't you hear my song
I can't wait till we are united
You are the star to light my night
You make me dream of you the whole day long

Sara
Oh Sara, Sara you're my shadowbride
You make me dream of you the whole day long
