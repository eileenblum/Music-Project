We share your tears and we share your laughter
We share your dreams and we feed your fear 
We will be gone in the morning after 
The break of dawn makes us disappear

We share your lust, but we feel no passion 
We need to fill our emptiness 
We make you burn and we take your flashes 
We must because of your willingness

So cry mercy 
Have mercy 
Have mercy 
Have mercy

We are the ones sitting on your shoulder 
We are the ones perching on your chest 
We are the ones making the world colder 
You may find sleep but you find no rest

Oh, have mercy 
Have mercy 
Have mercy 
Have mercy

Eleison, Eleison, Eleison
Eleison, Eleison, Eleison

We are the ones sitting on your shoulder 
We are the ones perching on your chest 
We are the ones making the world colder 
You may find sleep but you find no rest

Oh, have mercy 
Have mercy 
Have mercy 
Have mercy
Have mercy 
Have mercy 
Have mercy
Have mercy
Eleison

Kyrie Eleison
Kyrie Eleison
Kyrie Eleison
Kyrie Eleison
Eleison, Eleison
