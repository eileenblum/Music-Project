Here comes the pain little lover 
All the stains undercover
Do you cry? 
You don't have to be ashamed! 
Is it true, you can't remember 
What we went through last September 
I wonder why 
And if you still think it's game 

Follow me and I will take the lead 
You can't get off a train in full speed 

How far would you go? 
How far would you go? 
Without me you'll never know 
If you want to learn to fly 
The only way is to let go! 
How far would you go? 

It was so dark last September 
A red mark in your calendar 
What a mess
And you're trying to break free 
All in black now cross the borders 
'Cause I am back to give the orders 
And confess -
Have you been missing me? 

Follow me and I will take the lead 
You can't get off a train in full speed 

How far would you go? 
How far would you go? 
Without me you'll never know 
If you want to learn to fly 
The only way is to let go! 
How far would you go?

Lover 
All the stains undercover
Do you cry? 
You don't have to be ashamed! 
Do you cry? 
You don't have to be ashamed! 

How far? 
How far? 
How far? 

How far would you go? 
How far would you go? 
Without me you'll never know 
If you want to learn to fly 
The only way is to learn go! 
How far would you go? 
How far would you go? 
Without me you'll never know 
If you want to learn to fly 
The only way is to learn go! 
How far would you go?
