[Music: Demonhead]
[Lyrics: Abrahkkan]

Oh draconian highest, lord of the wrath of skies
Even from the death thy darkness will keep alive

Full of knowledge Demon, gargoyle of desire
Let us hear thy roar that bring us thy fire

Men will face the hellish spirit
Of the last dragon who succumbs into the dirt
Yielding to his hunter but gazing all of his kind
As the victims of the cruelest demonic revenge

From the bottom of the abyss
The lord of demons and beasts will spell against us
And his glory will be reminded through eternal damnation
As the one that once was real, but now is from beyond
Holds, more than ever, the power of the dragons
