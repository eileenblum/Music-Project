[Music: Demonhead, Abrahkkan]
[Lyrics: Abrahkkan]

O. Light of my Lord, please surround me
get me into the presence of Evil
Vampires and Gargoyles creatures with wings
Worship your Master, worship him !
Incubus rising from the flame of Satan
This fire must burn again
The winds from thy wings are cold
The wind cold as ice as your breath.

East Lucifer, West Leviathan
North Belial, South Sathanas

Lord Baphomet, Lord Leviathan
Lord Belial, Lord Sathanas
Immerse the glory, grant me his orb
Lord Lucifer, Emperor of Skies.

East Lucifer, West Leviathan
North Belial, South Sathanas

I. Women pregnant from the Goat Lord Demon
more servants for thy glory
How I ride thee through the spaces
How am I worthy to be
I'll do write your wings infinity
Let me profane what's not for you
We who were created to serve thee
I'll do write the infinity of thy wings

East Lucifer, West Leviathan
North Belial, South Sathanas

Lord Adramelekch, Lord Alastis
Lord Astarte, Lord Sathanas
Immerse the glory, grant me his orb
Lord Lucifer, Emperor of Skies.

East Lucifer, West Leviathan
North Belial, South Sathanas

Master Lucifer	Beholder and guardian
Dragon Lord	Fallen angel
Father of lights
Air's reptile
Thy secrets won't be shown as there's pain in our eyes

The infinity of thy wings, Faustian for your desire, Lucifer.
The infinity of thy wings, involve this world. A. Luzbel.
