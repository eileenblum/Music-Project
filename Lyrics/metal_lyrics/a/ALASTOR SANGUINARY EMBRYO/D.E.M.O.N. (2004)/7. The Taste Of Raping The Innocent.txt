[Music: Nahrepher]
[Lyrics: Abrahkkan]

I taste,
Feeling in my own body the total absence of light
Scared by the sorrow itself, when they come to me
They are everywhere, won't leave me be
My chest can't hold the pain
I can't bare the screams in my head
Anymore

The Demons, the child demons torture thee
With no presence, with no soul
Total profanation. There's no escape from here
All angels dead, all souls are dead
So it's thine. Thou art forever lost in darkness.
This is the taste of raping the innocent
In hell.
