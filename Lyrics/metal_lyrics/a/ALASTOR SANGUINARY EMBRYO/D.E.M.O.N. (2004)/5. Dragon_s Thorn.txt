13 steps beyond...

We're in a time when dragons fly
They are the conquerors of the vast heaven skies
They are blackeners of the sun
With their huge wings they stop the beams of light

While the man always with his envy flame
Turned them to demon beasts cruelty masterminds
But man knew of their spear of sapience
Great instrumento from you my friends

That's quite divine, Draconian brightest cry
Holocaust! The Dragon's Thorn
That's quite divine, Draconian highest
The spear must raise the Grackon's Horns

Only death can bring us thy power!!!

That's quite divine, Draconian brightest cry
Holocaust! The Dragon's Thorn

The dragons cry the painful deaths the mankind decision
The tears they shed a powerful weapon for evil pretensions

Oh! Feel my own blood cold runs red for my Gods' fulfillment
And all this time all those deaths for my own awakening

That's quite divine, Draconian Highest
The spear must raise the Grackon's Horns
That's quite divine, Draconian brightest cry
Holocaust! The Dragon's Thorn

The great dragon's thorn!!!

Wake up!

"The deceased is only a beast not meaningful at all"
The crowd it screamed as if a war were won
Only a creature with such sort of power
Could have shared its knowledge to all

The dragon's thorn was created in insanity at the high price of losing them all
And the creature with such sort of power turned its knowledge to a paradise lost.
