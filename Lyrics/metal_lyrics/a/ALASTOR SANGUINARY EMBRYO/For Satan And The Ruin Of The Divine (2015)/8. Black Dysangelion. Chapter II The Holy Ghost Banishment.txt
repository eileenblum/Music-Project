[Music: Aeon, lyrics: Abrahkkan]

With a satanic spirit who longs inside of me
I have cast and summoned the mighty lord of hell
My soul was unbound from the darkest burden of sin
My knowledge is my treasure for you fools is your guilt

Driven by the harvest of the blinding light of ignorance
A congregation of mindless creatures emerges like a stream of worms
Like a cancer it expanded unravaged and uncontrolled
A mortal disease crawls among us disguised in white feathers

I am the one called to stop this lie
For my sister mankind, my father Satan, my angel Lucifer

From within I have the weapon to end you holy damnation
I disown from you I'm not blasphemous you are not divine

Oh holy spirit, you who raped the holy whore
And engendered the biggest shame of our world

Holy ghost, creation of weak minds tormented by their loneliness
I compel you to leave, to depart from my life, from this earth

Earth that is one with the unholiness of its true god
I shall banish you, it is Satan who commands you
Earth that is one with the...

Oh holy spirit...

I am meant to exorcise you as an undesired intruder
I cast you out from humanity and condemn you to oblivion
Banishment is what will be from the very depths of our hearts
Not even hatred is worth feeling as your spirit exists no longer
