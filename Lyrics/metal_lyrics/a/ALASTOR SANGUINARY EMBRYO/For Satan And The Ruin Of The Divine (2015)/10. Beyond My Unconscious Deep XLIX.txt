[Bonus Track][Originally recorded on âThe Howling Creature of Nightâ demo 1997][Music: Demonhead, lyrics: Abrahkkan]

Unholiness, I am the one
A descent into darkness
To gather all wise on me
My presence will poison
I'll be armored with hate inside
No life itself limit, is offered now to me
Life Ethereal, a shadow opens inside
It's there always, beyond my unconscious deep

Oh, I feel a dark force inside my inner self
Your teaches are not easy to learn and
I know there's no turning back for becoming the master of the night side
My time has come to raise a fist for hail

I know with this on my own I'll rule this world
Resurrection of my evil side oppresses my chest inside out
I have realized I'm chosen to become powerful servant
Because I feel your seed of hate on me

It is beyond my unconscious deep

Alastor spawned his fury
And lowered his lightning fist upon the entire weak humanity
He, who destroyed their gods of pale and illness
Now becomes the master of all reigns

Lust, pain, fear and fright rule everywhere
Because his presence inhabits
Every part of our hearts, of humanity
Every time...

With the power gathered on me
I evoke the Nordic winds
to create the most beautiful gray in the day
And most cold in the night

I sing the ninth chant for thy glory
Casting the spell of sickness
I've gone through my unconscious
And I've found your mist here
Inside of me

I've carried the most glorious
And I'm the one gone beyond the gate
you offered for my eternity
All Wizardsâ Lord
