[Music: Aeon, lyrics: Abrahkkan]

Summoned out of darkness, awakened from the dead
Unbound from cruel damnation flows a river of hate
that holds a vital force from the deepest of our minds
Embracing Satanâs spirit weâll forge the christian scar

Eternal fire, grant me light from hell
To reveal once again the liarâs face
As razors our tongues with truth speaking at will
Disfiguring his image, no doubt we are set to kill
Swords of death, words of hate, relentless thoughts arise
We've always been chained our rage has no disguise
Christianity must suffer the evil one's command
Their faces shall be branded by satanic marks

Some of them shall rise
We'll crush them one by one
Manipulating the strings of hatred
One by one they will succumb to Satan

Summoned...

Libera nos a tenebris, Satan inclementi
Vivere volumus liberos et cum potestatem tuo
Da nos volupe ut noceat faciem Pseudochristi
Luminis orbem et renasci posse

Oh Lucifer, enlightened, we elevate
Our thoughts, unlimited, a great force in the air
Swords of death, words of hate, some âgodâ has recoiled
Minions fed by ignorance now speaking Satanâs word
Damned Nazarene, the cross it wasnât right
Oblivion and abandon, banished you shall be

Falling from grace
The christian church lies wounded, disclosing itself with its inner pest

We forged the wound in the christian scar
Through Satan our weapon we tore him apart
Jesus Christ torn deceiver one, as we evil ones will shine
Shining as fire
With pride and glory of purest evil
The biggest lie is gone forever

Some of them shall riseâ¦

Summoned out of darkness, awakened from the dead
Unbound from cruel damnation flows a river of hate
that holds a vital force from the deepest of the night
Embraced by Satanâs spirit weâve forged the christian scar
