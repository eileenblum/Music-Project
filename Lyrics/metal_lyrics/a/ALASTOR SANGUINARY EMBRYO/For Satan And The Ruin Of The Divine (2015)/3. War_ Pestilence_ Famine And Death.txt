[Music: Aeon, lyrics: Abrahkkan]

[Chapter War:]
The sky is open wide as I invoke thee War
Purification of nations through the great force of fire

Crimson horse sword at hand
he carries the echoes of darkness and destruction

Echoes to lead mankind to its end
the path to perdition is here
Brother kills brother, men killing men
'Till man exists no more

The time has come from here there is no return
The remnants of war, the stench of the dead
After this bloodbath, come forth white horse of decay

[Chapter Pestilence:]
Came after war's fires, arising from the dead
Bearer of christian carrion, our master Pestilence
Beware as I speak, believers or not
This rotting landscape is satanic art
From their leaderâs Antichrist power
Degradation misanthropy

The next statement of damnation
over thee defiled lambs
shall put all this world into abomination

[Chapter Famine:]
The sky is open wide as I invoke thee Famine
Purification of nations through the great force of starvation

The next statement of damnation
The black stallion rider
shall put all this world into desolation

[Chapter Death:]
To all those fool believers of Jehovah's son
Repulsive lies harvesters who lead the blind
After blood, fire, sickness and misery
Pale horse true god eternal is Death
