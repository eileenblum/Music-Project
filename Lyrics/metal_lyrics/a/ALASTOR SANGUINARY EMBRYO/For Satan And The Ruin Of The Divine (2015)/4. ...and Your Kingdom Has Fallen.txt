[Music: Aeon, lyrics: Abrahkkan]

Calling to arms with strong command
The right time is now to end God's era
The world has evolved to knowledge not tale
The gathering of dark forces began

Marching with swords and banners at hand
Christians are warned their fate is to die
Trembling ground, the walls start to crack
Thy Church is falling apart

The beasts are unleashed the front line is armed
Waiting for Satanâs word of attack
To begin our outstanding killing spree
The one we have promised will set this world free

As we watch their pathetic attempts
To stay up in war without blood in their hands
Our slogan is: Vanish them âtill they're no more
In contempt we'll watch them beg to a false lord

Beg to your false lord

Allied to thy side, take my spirit beyond the light
And embrace me into the night
To redeem those from this lie
Wipe out the bastard's supporters from earth
To overthrow the Father

Now that this war is finished
Corruption lords died by hellish soldiers
The Cardinals lie bleeding
The Pope hangs upside down

I know you know dead shall rise
And will bow before Satanâs might
Under this vast great gray sky
Make our day so mighty Satan rise

Aside, took my spirit beyond the light
And embraced into the night
We've redeemed the entire mankind
On my mind I'm doing it right
I know Satan is the light
To unveil this false Jesus Christ
And crown ourselves in the dominion
of Darknessâ¦ Fire...
SATAN
