[Music: Braexes Malaphar, lyrics: Abrahkkan]

I summon thee black mantle of Satan
upon Jesus Christ execution
as proclamation of our eternal victory
Over this misleading faith

His stinking sweat mixes with his impure blood
then drops like tears of filthiness and earth vomits them all
The stench coming from the body of the bastard one
completes the curse that summons Lucifer's miasma.

Crawling by the cross' base it lures to desecrate
It's a legion armed with darkness
Body of Christ, torn and broken, means their master throned
His hope drown into the breath of mighty Satan Lord

Nazarene! Open your eyes
Your resurrection is through Darkness.

Mark my words, forsaken son
Time has come to die
Open wounds of true evil
shall enlighten mankind

Cleansing the world from your infection
has led us to put your fate into obliteration

Mark my words, false prophet
Time has come to fear
The robe of our master
Is laid as your hearse

Face to the sky, poor Nazarene
Cry out to "him" just Why
Instead of triumphant angels
Led by a fake father
From deeper ground a sulfur smell
The name of Satan is cast
Thick darkness crawls ...
... below the feet of the Crucified

Mark my words, forsaken son...

Face to the sky, poor Nazarene...

Languid and decadent the great savior needs a hand
The claw of the beast keeps drawing his mark
Our eyes stare with hate as his life extinguishes fast
Mockery of once believers now daggers to his pride

Crawling by the cross' base it lures to desecrate
It's a legion armed with darkness
Body of Christ, torn and broken, means our master throned
Dead and never to wake again it shall rot before his altar

Nazarene! Open your eyes...

Now dead and gone, poor Nazarene
No one has answered your 'Why'
Instead of triumphant angels
Led by a fake father
From deeper ground a sulfur smell
The name of Satan was cast
Thick darkness crawledâ¦
...Messiah falls
