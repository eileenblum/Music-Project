[Music &amp; Lyrics: Aeon]

Oh mighty emperor of demise
Listen to this poet in the darkest night
Of death &amp; war...
Of hate &amp; wrath...

Show me the path to the ember's unclean
Guide my hand and your commands I'll reach
Wounding the face of Nazarene's race

Satan father of cries
I summon you lord of death
Storms of fire and pain
To those of white-hearted faith

Victory is now in our hands
Master of misery, lord of all plagues
Wisdom we have through your word
We'll see christian pestilent blood

I call upon you supreme lord
