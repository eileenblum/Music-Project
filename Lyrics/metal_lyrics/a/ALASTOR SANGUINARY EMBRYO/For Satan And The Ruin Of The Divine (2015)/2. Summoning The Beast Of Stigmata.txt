[Music: Aeon, lyrics: Abrahkkan]

The torment has begun
An alive suffering Christ delightful portrait

Craving towards damnation
Unleashing the fiery beast
Will shred your faith to pieces
I summon it upon me

The process begins turning out my hands
Into the claws you feel as the crown of thorns
Those relentlessly slash your head
While your horror is disguised by your own blood

Oh Stigmatized
Thereâs nothing Christ can do to help you
And this will go on until I kill you

You wonât endure through this
As the weak one could not in his time
My goat hooves are smashing your hands
Unmerciful nails crucify
Your wrists I severe
Through my hate lies the one who defeats you
You and your god and his absurd mission

What you may think is the spear of destiny
Is just my full of teeth jaw
That rips your torso apart
And with it your life

Oh Stigmatized...

Your pain bends your faith
Take me Satan, embrace me in thy dark
Let me out of this chalice to suffer
No more again
Speak aloud my name
I'm Satan so I can release you
I shall become flames to remind you who reigns

You dared to face me
Your weapon was your faith in God
A gift you thought the stigmata was
A dead corpse, soul with opened eyes
Stigmatized
There was nothing Christ could do for you
And all this is done, because Iâve killed you

Weakened by the blood loss
Visions of the beast appear
But reality is to die
Suffering as your master did
