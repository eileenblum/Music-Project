[Music: Saaht Noszfeuhl, lyrics: Abrahkkan]

This night means the alliance with an ancient glory
That holds the greatest force of Satan
My true desire lies waiting as I meet thee my master
Satan god of wrath cast thy word as thunder
Thy evil will act through me

A great hate grows inside
Everlasting desire of Armageddon and revolution
In a world that lies imprisoned
And its clown god so pathetic that sent his only son
I'll receive him with burning arms

Grant me fire oh beautiful inferno
To tear the darkest night and to recall thy splendid glory
An infant is being spawned I'm standing at the crib
My gift to him a hell will be, the arson of godâs plan

Bow down see my work that vomits holy smoke
As I immolate the bastard one
Lucifer's son ready to be crowned
I shall immolate the Bethlehem son

I'm bringing thy flame from the left hand path
Released from thy dark heart and molten with that infant's body
Newborn cries increasing, my ritual has begun
With holy oil heâs covered, unholy flames will shelter

Bow down ...

Oh Malignant One! Strip thy heart of hate and twisted decay
A signal to the heaven, those infantâs cries
Screams that chills the skin, the father beholds

Oh Malignant One! Strip thy heart of hate and twisted decay
A signal to the heaven, scorched skin smell
Cracking bones echoes, the father is lost

Oh Malignant One! Strip thy heart of hate and twisted decay
A signal to the heaven, the ashes flight
As black as Satan's soul, in heaven it snowed

Bow down ...

Unholy fire thou shalt deliver us from Christianity
Itâs just the plague I shall cauterize
Iâm the healer of this world.
A new Messiah? Yes I am, who revoked false immortality
