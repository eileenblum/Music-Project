This is the outcome of the behold!!

Emptiness and sorrow terrifies my own
My eyes art black into the dimensions of the disease of death
Life creation's a vast sadistical feast

In the dark of night
Suffocate me, lord of death

Into the abyss of cries
I'll awake to demand ...

Eyes black, to enslave the last life
Taking it in hands like my own god
To show the one that his oppression
Is only a lie...

This is the outcome of my wrath
The funeral of this earth combines with the red sky
The night will convert this in my lair
Life creation's a vast sadistical bleed

Hands like rimes
Haunting the time
Into the most perfect dream

The universe will stop forever
To let the fall begin...

I'm now in essence to sodomize the kingdom of death
This is the outcome of the behold

The blackened sword will raise again in ecstasy
Hear the whisper of those lives
And the red sky is falling bleeding the holy life

This is the outcome of my wrath

While the night will be seen in both horizons
This is the Universe's Pillars Fall

For my healing:
Into the pass of this duty
My own spirit has been fouled
Darkness even suffocated my being...

Raising lord of the destruction
And the pain of burning black
Consecrate my weak spectrum

Asmodeo I pray to thee
Asmodeo! Asmodeo! Asmodeo!

Take myself beyond this blood
Oh my lord, take me beyond
For you this kingdom!

In thy eyes I find hatred
In thy arm I find strength
Kill my enemies
GOD of mild souls
For thy glory I cry!!

My life's passed for thy silver divinity
Flame by hand feeding from the dead

I will shine golden fire, luciferous!

Take my eyes to guide thy path
Order me to die all until the end of time
The falling of this will prevail in blasphemy

Make me thy slave to haunt and profane
And climax of all pleasure will turn in pain
Command my arise in tons of disgrace
Forever instrument of thy plan

Again here by thy side to curse the holy
Raven and Crow, Asmodeo I pray to thee...

Again here by thy side to curse the holy
Raven and Crow, Asmodeo I pray to thee...

Asmodeo! Asmodeo! Asmodeo!

Take myself beyond this blood
Oh my lord, take me beyond
for you this kingdom!

I believe in thee, lord of the red sky
Behind my back the desert land...

This was the outcome of thy evilness
Emptiness and sorrow even terrified thee
My eyes art black into the dimensions of the disease of death
Life creation was vast sadistical feast
