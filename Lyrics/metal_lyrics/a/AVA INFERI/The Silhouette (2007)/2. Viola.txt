Dancing underneath these silvery and bright moons
Drifting on seas of wisdom again
Seeking the ancient spirits for their guidance
Letting them unfold again

Viola
All the things that you believe
It's falling apart
Breathe in me
The spirit of belief
Let the wine pour down

Breathe in me
Rescue me

Please lay still
Don't wake these guardians in stone
Viola
Hiding in your shell

I'm aware of my failures
May I rest in peace?

Once again the feeling came
Distracting me, illuding me
Once again these sacred chants
Calming me with wonders
All the cries of agony
That I've been running from
Silently will disappear, in the end
Forever

Viola
All the things that you believe
It's falling apart
Breathe in me
The spirit of belief
Let the wine pour down
