Calling me, it's innocence
Drums are pounding underground
Carved in the woods by lightning
Branches show the hidden path

"By fertile earth and whirling air,
by rushing fire and water fair,
by spirit joined and held fast,
this sacred circle now is cast"

Join us, the bell for us tolls
To attend this great moment
The cleansing of dirt
Release this essence of yourself
Be alert for this great sound
The pulse of this earth

When the nighttime birds singing
Through this dawn
Beholding the sun

And the larvaes keep changing
Winter's mourn
The start of it all

Join us, the bell for us tolls
To attend this great moment
The cleansing of dirt
Release this essence of yourself
Be alert for this great sound
The pulse of this earth
