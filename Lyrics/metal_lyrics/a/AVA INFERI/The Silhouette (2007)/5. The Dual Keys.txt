We're riding these roads
Reaching out for the answers
Everywhere we've been thus far
Brought more doubts to our carving hearts

Frail...
Why is my lonely heart so frail?
Weak...
Why is my fragile heart so weak?

To my solitude I grant you this key
To perfect harmony

Frail...
Why is my lonely heart so frail?
Weak, so weak...
Why is my fragile heart so weak?
Believed, deceived...
How was my weakened heart deceived?
Rare, so rare...
Those moments I could feel your peace
Consuming me...

To my solitude I grant you this key
To perfect harmony

On these roads
We always ride alone
