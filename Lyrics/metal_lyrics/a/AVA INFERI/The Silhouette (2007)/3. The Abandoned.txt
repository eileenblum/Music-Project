I'm still wondering why did they leave me
With my blindfolded eyes

I'm still dreaming of a life without treason
Darkened skies shut my eyes

I'm still here
Running through the woods
With me, my fears
It's taking over me
Draining my soul
Feeding on my blood

Here I am upon the fallen bridge
With me I carry the lost and deceived
Here I stand upon the fallen bridge
Staring beneath me
There's nowhere to go

Blackened waters
Drowning my sins
Letting me drift away...

Here I am upon the fallen bridge
With me I carry the lost and deceived
Here I stand upon the fallen bridge
Staring beneath me
There's nowhere to go
