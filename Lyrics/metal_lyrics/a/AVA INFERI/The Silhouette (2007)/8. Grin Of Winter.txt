The cold wind caresses my hand
Singing songs of wastelands
It keeps telling me
That my time has come

Hiding behind these walls
Watching my kingdom fall
Bearing a crown of war
Who am I now?

"Footsteps across these empty plains
Holds the hope of grace and newfound strength"

Hiding behind these walls
Watching my kingdom fall
Bearing a crown of war
Who am I now?
