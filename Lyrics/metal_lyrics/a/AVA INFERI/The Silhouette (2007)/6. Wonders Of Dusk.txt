Trace the essence of the sparks
Though the light you seek
Can deceive you to an endless spiral

Why do you fight
against the truth that you hide?

Shades of dusk will embrace
the fountain of lies
Your beliefs are thrown into the wind

Why do you fight
against the truth that you hide?

There is still a burning within me
And it will never fade away...
