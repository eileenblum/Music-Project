Through the fog
Caravans approaching
The owlâs praise
Winds cry out in pain
Three shadows black
Horses neigh and lightning
A moonless night
A sacrifice

Onyx

[Lightning winds - solo by Rune]

Through the woods
Echoes heard and laughter
Witches dance
Spells are cast, scent of red
As midnight chimes
The hour of redemption
A moonless night
A pact is sealed

Protect us and all my kin
Release us
