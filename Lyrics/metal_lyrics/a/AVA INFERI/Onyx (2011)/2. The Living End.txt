Hold, hold my hand
Give me shelter tonight
Call, call my name
Save me from this dark call
As angels we fly
Now take my hand
Come take my hand
Letâs leave this land

We die - As I feel desire
Inside - Seeking love beside her
Each moment - All seems lost
Of life - Iâm dead to this world
Deny - As I feed desire
The signs - Bringing love inside her
Of hope - All seems lost
Weâre dead to this world

Come, stay with me
Hold me closer, Iâm yours
Fall, fall with me
Through cobwebs of love

The tears in your eyes
Revealing your deepest despair
The deep caves of your mind
No one will find

We die - As I feel desire
Inside - Seeking love beside her
Each moment - All seems lost
Of life - Iâm dead to this world
Deny - As I feed desire
The signs - Bringing love inside her
Of hope - All seems lost
Weâre dead to this world
