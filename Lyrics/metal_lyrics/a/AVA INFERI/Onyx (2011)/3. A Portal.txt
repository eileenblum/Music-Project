A stream of light
Shadows hide in the somber nights
This illusion is all I know
Blackened winds
Call me from below

In this madness I break down and cry
Not a day pass me by without fights

Beneath these scars I stand alone
Hearts turn to stone

Screams of fear
From my dreams to reality
This confusion is all I sense
Holding on to my last defence

In this madness I break down and cry
Not a day pass me by without fights

Beneath these scars I stand alone
Between these hearts of stone
Within this dark Iâll set you free
Within your dark...
