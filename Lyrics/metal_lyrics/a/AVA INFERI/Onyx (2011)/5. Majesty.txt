Beneath these leaves
There is something calling
Preserved from the light
In its chambers to hide

Invite me in, Natureâs hymn
Now greet this night
The coming of the queen
Arise, reveal your might

A night-time divine
These flies are all a part of me
At daybreak I die
Again...

Between these trees
Here is something crawling
Forever passing by, moving closer
Serving time... again

Night we praise, behold our Godâs embrace
Into the mist we dance
Eternal charms commence
Into the night we praise
Behold our Godâs embrace
Into the mist we dance
Eternal charms

Black mountain rise
Midwinterâs nights
Feed the fires
