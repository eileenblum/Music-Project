I had a dreamThe snow in your handsThe silence aroundThe sadness in you I had a dreamYour frozen heartThe darkness aroundDo you suffer your own way alone?Drowning into moving sands... I look in the mirror and face the changeThese black wings you gave me are heavyThe cold wind of bitterness leadingTo the wasteland where you stand
