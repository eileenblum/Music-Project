AboveFrom heavens aboveStardust pour downBlindfolding meRejoicemoment of joyLove fills this voidBoiling my bloodEcstasy is taking over. Curse my acts in the bright of dayGods and fairies, blood of BacchusCurse our acts and whatever we sayCome closer / Reveal Thee / Within meA second / Eternal / Ecstasy Do you hearThe pulse in your veinsReleasing this chainsForget all your painsFreedomOur precious state of mindPoisoning your kindThe secrets of the wineWhen the moon shines againLeave your fears, leave your faithFeel the warmth of its lightWhen the moon shines tonightEssence flow, through the skiesFeel the warmth of its lightEcstasy is taking over. Curse my acts in the bright of dayGods and fairies, blood of BacchusCurse our acts and whatever we sayCome closer / Reveal Thee / Within meA second / Eternal / Ecstasy
