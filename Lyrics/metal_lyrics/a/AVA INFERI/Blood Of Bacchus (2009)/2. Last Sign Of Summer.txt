Open up the lid of dreamsCaress its crystal lightEmbrace the vision it revealsA moment of the purest kind Despair is far beneath this groundFlying high, leaving me behindThe drums are calling upon me I hide - the legacy of the witchThe legacy of a queenI hide myselfDownThe spiralcase leading downMy dreams are gone so my crownWith the last sign of summer Open up the lid of dreamsCaress its crystal lightEmbrace the vision it revealsA moment of the purest kind "You are not allowed to break the silenceYou'll be jugded for what you didSorcerer, witch!"The drums are calling upon me I hide - the legacy of the witchThe legacy of a queenI hide myselfDownThe spiralcase leading downMy dreams are gone so my crownWith the last sign of summer Staring at the horizonHolding on to dead dreamsCeremony of shadowdanceAwakes the circle again... I hide - the legacy of the witchThe legacy of a queenI hide myselfDownThe spiralcase leading downMy dreams are gone so my crownWith the last sign of summer
