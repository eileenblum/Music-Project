As winters pass us by,Rising shadows block the sunRelief has held me high.In all this dark i see, in all this dark i feelRisingDriftingSilence - Seeking me All the miseryYears of hope are lost eternallyStained by this essence of griefHolding on, doing my best to be me... In fog i hide my tears,Frozen by a time long goneFears have kept me downIn all the dark... All the miseryYears of hope are lost eternallyStained by this essence of griefHolding on, doing my best to be me... And all the colours melt into shapeless darkness"Shapeless angels"In all the darkness innocence remains"Through the essence"Innocence remainsRelief / Holding / The hope / For a bright dayBringing / Despair / To the ones who waitBreathing / All the / Colours / Of the darknessTurn them into my own light All the miseryYears of hope are lost eternallyStained by this essence of griefHolding on, doing my best to be me...
