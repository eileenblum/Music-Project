In a bad land
Thirsty for water
Ruled by thorns and weeds
Hard like stone
Dry like a desert
Brought by the wind
A little seed germinates
The beautiful flower of blood
It was born
Destroying all evil
Creating life
Giving fruit
The wind of the spirit
Holy Spirit
The seed of love
Was born in my heart
The beautiful flower of blood
