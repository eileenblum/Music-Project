There is a great gain in godliness
With contentment
For we brought nothing into this world
And we cannot take anything
Out of this world
But with we have food and clothing
With these we shall be content
But those who desire to be rich fall
Into temptation
Into a snare
Into many senseless and hurtful desires
That plunge men into ruin and destruction
Into many senseless and hurtful desires
For the love of money is the root of all evils
It's through this craving
That some have
Wandered away
From the faith and pierced their hearts
With many pangs
