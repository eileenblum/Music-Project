In the color of the night
Depressed souls wandering
In the shadows of a graveyard
Under the light of the moon
Sad eyes searching
Cold white skin
Anguished by the void
Walk... .Always... Walk... Always
Walking to a farway place
Steps to a farway place
For a meaning...
For a meaning...
Searching for a meaning...
Always...
