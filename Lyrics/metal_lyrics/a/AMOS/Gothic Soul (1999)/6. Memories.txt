To sleep
Without the fear to dream
TO dream about you, my friend
To try
To forget the past
Dark past for me, for you
The time
Will soon erase my pain
The pain of the sudden loss
But you will always be
In my memories in my heart
I remember your eyes
Looking to this word with love
I remember your face
Cheerful and hopeful
I miss you...
I miss you, my friend...
I hope to see you soon
Soon we will be together again
