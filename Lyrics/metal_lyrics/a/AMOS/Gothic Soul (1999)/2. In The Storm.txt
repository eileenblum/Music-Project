In the storm
Fear in the hearts
Darkness around
Furious sea
Lightning and thunder
Strong winds blowing
From the little boat
A voice lifts up
All authority and dominion
Nature and its creator
The heavens open up
The wind and sea quiet down
Rays of sunshine
Powerful voice that rules over
All things...
