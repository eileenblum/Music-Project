I fear the struggle
I fear the strife
A fear of death
A fear of life
I fear for you
You fear for me
I fear for what
Will come to be
(Come to be [x4])

Blossoms bloom so fine
Only to fall from the vine

[x2]
I will grown an orchard
Filled with broken portraits

Blossoms bloom so fine
Only to fall from the vine

I got a feeling
I'm just scared
I'll start believing
When I see you there
Life's a portion
When you die it's done
Pretend your something
Not fooling anyone.
(Anyone [x4])

Blossoms bloom so fine
Only to fall from the vine

[x2]
I will grown an orchard
Filled with broken portraits

Blossoms bloom so fine
Only to fall from the vine
(Am I alone)

[x2]
I will grown an orchard
Filled with broken portraits
Blossoms bloom so fine
Only to fall from the vine
