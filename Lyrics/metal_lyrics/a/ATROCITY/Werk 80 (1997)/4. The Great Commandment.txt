[Originally performed by Camouflage]

Some people suppress you
They partch you
And reap a disaster
Reeducation for the enfants
Who demanded for an innocent instance

The great commandment
Shows the contempt
Between the world and their
Embarassing pavement
Believe the scholars
Read the readings
Realize the man who says anything
The great commandment

The needies believe you
They treat you
Like survivors of a disaster
Reeducation for the enfants
Who demanded for an innocent instance
The great commandment...
