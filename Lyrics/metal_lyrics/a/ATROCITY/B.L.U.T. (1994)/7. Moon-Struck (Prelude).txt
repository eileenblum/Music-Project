A lonely shining light
takes the viens of night
Each shaft another thought
thought of different ways
ways of dust you see
dusty air you breath
Dark clouds are passing by
clearing up the darkened sky
face in the teeth of the wind
to watch the rising fight
Nightly scene
nocturnal game
moon obsessed
With my lonely beating heart
step by step, so close to you
punding, pounding amid the glade
I raise my arms up to the sky
I'm dressed up
for the splendour in silver-grey
moon-struck
I dance the moonlight dance
Changing garment night by night
appearing in habitual grace
ocean dressed in silver clothes
the ercscent keeps my thoughts
Confidence
devoutness
moon obsessed
The old calaboose memoruies
fleshing through my mind
from time immemorial
you guide my blood-damned life
I'm dressed up
for thwe splendout in silver-grey
moon-struck
I dance the moonlight dance
With my lonely beating heart
step by step, so close to you
pounding, pounding amid the glede
I raise my arms up to the sky
I'm dressed up
for the splendour in silver-grey
moon-struck
I dance the moonlight dance
