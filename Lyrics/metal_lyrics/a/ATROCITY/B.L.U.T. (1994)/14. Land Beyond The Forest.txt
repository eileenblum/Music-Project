I walk through the hills
and march down the plains
so many years but I was always there
Deep in my heart I remember the time...
oh father,
how could you endure this fate?
i will stand for
I will fight forI die for the land beyond the forest
Oh yes,
I will complete what you have begun
I will face my destiny
oh father, I won't fail my final mission
The greenest grass, the whitest snow
i breathe the air, I absirb the land
so cold the wind, so high the mountains
I will never forget this fascination, this closeness, this familarity
this familarity I will never forget
in life beyond death
I will stand for
I will fight fir
I will die for the land beyond the forest

"Blut" means "Blood".
