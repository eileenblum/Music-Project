moods and emotions
circles ibrations
Dark days are rising
in eternal remembrance
I feel like I have failed my life
when thoughts of sorror lead my mind
I feel like calling the rain
I feel like calling the rain
Daguely and clearly
threatning and knocking
dark cloud formation
from vanguished despiration
hoping for enlightment
but holding the light
being moved but not ready to cry
I feel like calling the rain
