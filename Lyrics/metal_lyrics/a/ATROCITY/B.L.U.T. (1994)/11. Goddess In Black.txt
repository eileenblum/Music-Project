all that night
this feeling, that pleasure
stealing my soul
all I found was lust
deification
a bizarre romance of caressing
deleterious love
you are
Denturing into a world of frustration
living on the age of damnation
living in the circle within the bats
and fading meanwhife
on and on and on
this headiness
caused by deadnes
raping my mind
not heaven-born magic
dehumanized
a fogged world of lying dreams
blandishment
Oh, I know my deatiny
I pay the price
the voice comes from the heart
cut off the soul
moving to another p[lace
earning the wages, you are
Denturing into a world of frustration
living on the edge of damnation
laying in the circle within the bats
and fading meanwhile on and on and on
Goddess in black
you're feeling her might
between your legs
awaiting temptress
beyond all reason
your mind is runnong free
in the night of damnation
Enchanted, blinded can't you see
the witchraft of a beauty beast
creeping, crawling in the head
snake - hissing on youe neck
sneaking fiend from the back
fiery love - scene at its height
Black temptation in a murky night
Goddnes in black
beyond all reason
goddess in black
weird obsession
lucifoguous and bad
cheiroptera
Goddess In Black
Coming under her influence
strange maiden dressed in black
grotesque flames of fire
kept my soul soothfast soul
Howsoever this night will be ended
I have to ask the question
where are the guerdiam angels
followed all my lyfe?
All that night
this feeling, that pleasure
craving for more
squirming fustfully
degeneration
abstract, abysm fantasies
deleterious love
you are
Denturing into a world of frustration
living on the adge of damnation
laying in the circle within the batsand fading meanwhile on and on and on
Goddess in black
beyona dll reason
goddess in black
weird obsession
accord with the devil's pact
delivered to the
Goddess In Black
