Again I feel the dirty ground
I stand with my boots on
rotten, deceerated, holy place
raped mother land
we fought side by side
we held the banners high
together we touched the sky
our aim out of reach
Those days we shared the pain,
and stood as one
those days our spirit was one union,
those days are gone
We fought side by side
we held the banners high
together supposed ti die
our aim never reached
i still hear you strong voice,
Telling me about Utopia
Yes I still can hear you,
your spirit will be erver inside me
Does any god listen to me?
you took just the comporeality!
no one can break my melody
listen to my threnody
I've lost nmore than a friend
(but) one day we'll meet again
I won't loose you twice
because your spirit never diea - never/you'll return
I keep the free spirit, I carry on, I keep on fighting
I know, I snatd alone, your return: a further ending
Does any god listen to me?
you took just the corporeality!
no one can break my melody
listen to my threnody
