Fullmoon night in disguise, i look up to the eternal skies
My mind infected evil, live my life not only twice
I have wakened all the pain which grove the world insane
You see the infernal black, you know me, I bring you
Down, down on your knees
you're tasting the disease, you see
Never cross my ways
Death, Death in my veins
Hate, Hate in my eyes
Your life was ended
When you surendered
Just by my fingertip
Death&lt; Death in my veins... in my veins
"Wherefore, O king let my councel be accepted unto thee
and break off Thy sins"
Eyeball like fire, pain and desire, you're ffeling the reging hate
Endless enduring, godforsacen creature, along to survive
Death, Death in my veins and I send yuou to your doom,
dwelt your mind.
Rape your soul, I like you to consume,
endlessly in the dusk,
All night I hear you scream
Death, Death in my veins
Like an one thousand year darkened
dominion - The field of the dead seed
Burnt and withered, you would never
consider to an once prospering land
Day is night and night is day
In the kingdom of the dead.
