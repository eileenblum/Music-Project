i remember the night
sitting on the dark
the battle was won
but lost my love
I left the light side
chosen the dark
sworn another solemn
at fullmoon I bark
walkingthrough the centuries
a pathless path
symphonic blood lust
on this funeral march
My innerself
is drifting in a red sea
bizarre and sweet
... B. L. U. T.!!!
awaiting the next vein
haemophilia
posessed byu essential desire
damned and addicted to survive
this form of life
I'm searching for her
the love I lost
I'm searching for her
taking away the frost
But too many years are gone
my mind like ice
B. L. U. T....
... you are my beauty
With my servants
I enter the air
diving down to the mortals
let them join the eternal form of life.
Stapin de abscuritate,
fantoma nucturna
dragostea inseamna viata besnica,
care a obtinem numai prin moarte
"Yes, but I will neve die!!!"
B. L. U. T. - you are my beauty.. till I
reach eternal peace!
