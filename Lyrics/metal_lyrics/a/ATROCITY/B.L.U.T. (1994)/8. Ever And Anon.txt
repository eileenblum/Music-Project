Time is so heartless
time is malice
time is the aburd absolution
time leads me to disillusion
Here I find myself
the helot of the handman
fearing the certain death
and hoping for salvation
Ever and anon - flying
Ever and anon - dying
shattered thoughts, they're flowing
leaving you in the shades
What eve I'll create
what eve I will think
never I'll be meant
self-regulated punishment
A live from agony
dust-eating, blood-drinking crearure
sharing insanity
earth to fed up but open wide
Ever and anon - flying
Ever and anon - dying
still on the knee you're playing
but no god wanna fisten - to you
i fly a little bit, I die a little bit more - ever
I fly alittle bit, I die a little bit more - anon
I search for the wisdom
Left in the sand
awaiting the final solution
bringing myself to the end
Land of elover-feats
land of desolation
land of no believes
I fly for the unflating nation
Ever and anon - flying
Ever and anon - dying
Ever and anon - falling
ever and anon - crushing
