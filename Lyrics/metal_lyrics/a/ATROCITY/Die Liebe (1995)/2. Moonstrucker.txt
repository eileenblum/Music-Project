I dance the moonlight-dance

Dark clouds are passing by
Clearing up the darkened sky
Face in the teeth of the wind
To watch the rising light

With my lonely beating heart
Step by step, so close to you
Pounding, pounding amid the glade
I raise my arms up to the sky

Moonstrucker

Nightly scene
Nocturnal game
Moon obsessed
Moonstrucker

Changing garment night by night
Appaering in habitual grace
Ocean dressed in silver clothes
The crescent keeps my thoughts

With my lonely beating heart
Step by step, so close to you
Pounding, pounding amid the glade
I raise my arms up to the sky

Nightly scene
Nocturnal game
Moon obsessed
Moonstrucker

The old calaboose memories
Flashing through my mind
From time immemorial
You guide my blood-damned life

With my lonely beating heart
Step by step, so close to you
Pounding, pounding amid the glade
I raise my arms up to the sky

Moonstrucker

I dance the moonlight-dance

Moonstrucker

Nightly scene
Nocturnal game
Moon obsessed
Moonstrucker

Confidence
Devoutness
Moon obsessed
Moonstrucker
