I remember the night
Sitting in the dark
The battle was won
But lost my love

I left the light side
Chosen the dark
Sworn another solemn
At full moon bark

Walking through the centuries
A pathless path
Symphonic bloodlust
On this funeral march

My innerself
Is drifting in a red sea
Bizarre and sweet
B.L.U.T.!!!

B.L.U.T. - You are my beauty

Bloodlust, undead trance
Bloodlust, undead trance

"StapÅn de obscuritate,
Fantoma nucturna
Dragostea Ånseamna viata vesnica,
Care o obtinem numai prin moarte"

Awaiting the next vein
Haemophilia
Possessed by essential desire
Damned and addicted to survive
This form of life

Iâm searching for her
The love I lost
Iâm searching for her
Taking away the frost

But too many years are gone
My mind like ice
B.L.U.T. â¦
You are my beauty

B.L.U.T. - You are my beauty

Bloodlust, undead trance
Bloodlust, undead trance
