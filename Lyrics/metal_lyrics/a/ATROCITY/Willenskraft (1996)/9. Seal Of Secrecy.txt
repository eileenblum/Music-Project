[music: M. Roderer / lyrics: A. Krull]

a deep grey nursery
creche a poor and dirty cage
dreams of wonderland
will never come true in this world

born into this misery
never knowing any reason why
cowering on the dirty floor
bed-ridden, beaten - every day

...under the seal of secrecy

eyes full of pain
belonging to the weaker sex
staring into space
so many years of hopelessness

in prison without any guilt
the children of no home and love
and they sing:
nursery rhymes out of their mind
without sense - sad cries for help

...under the seal of secrecy

growing into apathy
enduring every use of force
body like a numb limb
without ache - but soul is still alive

...under the seal of secrecy

[lead: T. Bauer]
