[music: T. Bauer / lyrics: A. Krull]

flames of fire destroying the world's illusion
your own created nightmare stabs you to death
listen to your hypocrisy, your everlasting false belief
holy ground, a holy grave
divine fate by divine grace

deathly pallor
funeral cortege
mass extermination
the scorching breath
greedy death mask
greeping barrage
deadly termination
the scorching breath

war-demons, demolition
deep, down from the infernal regions
your dreams of dread
will take you soon to the dead

deathly pallor
funeral cortege
mass extermination
the scorching breath
greedy death mask
greeping barrage
deadly termination
the scorching breath

from pride to the fall - the way is very short
the scorching breath takes the world apart

deathly pallor
funeral cortege
mass extermination
the scorching breath
greedy death mask
greeping barrage
deadly termination
the scorching breath

naked skeletons piled up like stacked wood
iced sea of depression numbed with cold and fear
awaiting fatal destiny, with disillusioned disbelief
holy ground, a holy grave
divine fate by divine grace

war-demons, demolition
deep, down from the infernal regions
your dreams of dread
will take you soon to the dead

deathly pallor
funeral cortege
mass extermination
the scorching breath
greedy death mask
greeping barrage
deadly termination
the scorching breath
