[music: M. Schwarz, M. Roderer / lyrics: A. Krull]

degenerate!

we ar degeneration

your downfall is our aim
we suck your brain
we brind you pain
we are desperation
leading your son to slaughter
common grave diggers
mass-murderers, fellow travellers
a selfdestructive point of view
we drink your blood
we eat your heart

we are degeneration

we are transfiguration
this planet won't survive
decadent morality
malicious insanity, beneath dignity
a selfdestructive point of view
we suck your brain
we bring you pain

we are degeneration

[lead: M. Roderer, T. Bauer]
