[music: T. Bauer, M. Roderer / lyrics: A. Krull]

i feel a cold breath of wind
black sky in mourning-veil
i see no worth-living reason
oh no,
it's driving me insane
pangs of love
never thought i would feel this way
i see your face in every cloud
and i say to myself
don't let me, lete me fade away

love is dead

i walk through desert fields
black ravens surrounding me
i have no more jest for life
no more,
i'm bleeding from inside
a once opened heart
never thought i would feel this way
i search for any reason or cause
which i could never find
so i blame myself for things i don't understand

love is dead

all my life is pain
drowned in tears
never thought i would feel this way
everyday i die once more
my heart turns black
never again safe and warm

love is dead

[lead: T. Bauer, M. Rodere]
