[music: M. Roderer, T. Bauer / lyrics: A. Krull]

Refering to an old book
one thousand words - one lie
lost in self-adulation
your self-regarded mind

narrow minded visions
spread like poison through the world
posing as the awaited saviour
the last supper prepared

blood-stained prophecy

a lifeless son is your idol
your act of grace is death
canturies of forced conversion
word of god declined

your tonguees speak about mercy
but your prophecy is pain
narcissim  and divine benediction
won't save you from ordeal
blood-stained prophecy

[lead: T. Bauer, M. Roderer]
