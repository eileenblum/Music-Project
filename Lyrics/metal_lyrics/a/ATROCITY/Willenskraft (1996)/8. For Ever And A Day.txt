[music: M. Roderer, T. Bauer / lyrics: A. Krull]

i'm watching the moon-set
walking through the woods
tasting depth of winter
morbidity and doom

i saw one million faces
i saw one million deaths
colours are in dark-grey
veil of emptiness

stalking in a nightmare
i was lost long ago
i gave all my love
spirit's feeling low

sorrow - i'm dead-tired, tired of life
eternal dusk my dungeon and desire

shadows - dark face in autumnal tints
covering me, lost in immortality

crossing the old bridgeg
like one thousand times before
sadness, autumnal equinox
sunbeams - nevermore

soulful - my heart is bleeding, my soul is seeking
for salvation and release
soulless - no more longing, no more loving
just the ashes of my thoughts

for ever and a day
death is the salvation
for ever and a day
life is the damnation
for ever and a day
ghosts are hunting me
for ever and a day
death is the salvation

stamping underwood down
plot revenge that kills
leaving life behind
sowing death and thrills

i saw one million faces
i saw one millions deaths
colours are in dark-grey
veil of emptiness

sorrow - i'm dead-tired, tired of life
eternal dusk my dungeon and desire

shadows - dark face in autumnal tints
covering me, lost in immortality

for ever and a day
death is the salvation
for ever and a day
life is the damnation
for ever and a day
ghosts are running free
for ever and a day
death is the salvation

sorrow in shadows
soulful but soulless
throughout time and space
misantrophic  race
manhunting, echoing pain
endless night starts again

for ever and a day
death is the salvation
for ever and a day
life is the damnation
for ever and a day
ghosts are hunting me
for ever and a day
death is the salvation...
