[music: M. Roderer / lyrics: A. Krull]

here, now and then
sin and hate
shall dominate
i have seen the fall of man
wages of sin
is death

in the still of evening
night frost on the eaerth
seven continents are bleeding
seven seas in red

posterity will never find
rapture or peace of mind
goddess of luck, bearer of glad
buried by mankind

down, down below
there is no love
at death's door

with life, life of sin
we have been
blessed and doomed

the nightfall of humanity
together we obtain
loosing sensibility
reaching death's domain

fiery temper growing strong
engender fiendishness
graven image taken wrong
trying to surpass

eclipse of the moon
down below
phantasmagoric creation
down below

down, down below
there is no love
at death's door

sun will never rise
only darkness beholds the eyes

irruption of spitefulness
celebrated chaos
deep beyong there are no rules
survival of the fittest

in the still of night
world torn to shreds
seven continents are gone
seven sease are dead

eclipse of the moon
down below
phantasmagoric creation
down below

...down on earth!
