Looking back at the past
Once a spell was cast
Now the flame is shining bright
We scream into the night

We call
We sing
Please, take my hand
Call of yesteryear

We call
We shout
Let us break the spell
Call of yesteryear

Unchained shall be your fate
Open the forbidden gate
Facing timeless force
Unbound eternal curse

We call
We dance
Come on, take my hand
Call of yesteryear

We call
We shout
We will break the spell
Call of yesteryear

Old legends buried deep
Spirits of the past
Hear our nocturnal call
Our evensong will last forever

We call
We sing
Come on, take my hand
Call of yesteryear

We call
We shout
Let us break the spell
Call of yesteryear

We call
We dance
Let me take your hand
Call of yesteryear

We call
We shout
Let us break the spell
Call of yesteryear
