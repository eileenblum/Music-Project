We sail
Duat, The Underworld
Open twelve gates
Travelling every night

The boat of millions
Take me away
Guide me through the night
Bring me back to life

Mesketet
Barque of Morning
Bring me back to life
Returning in red
As the sun kissed the sky

We sail
Stars are shining bright
Left soil of fate
Travelling every night

The boat of millions
Take me away
The nightly passage starts
We have to sail again

Mesketet
Barque of Morning
Bring me back to life
Reborn in red
As the sun kissed the sky
