See the fields, wasted land
It seems life was taken away

Mountains turned grey
Clouds turned dark
Colours have changed
Senses disturbed

A shadow is lying upon a green hill
The flowers asleep, the world stands still

At once
For all
After the storm
After the storm

Smell the air of wasted land
It seems beauty was taken away

Valleys turned grey
Sun turned dark
Colours have changed
Senses disturbed

A shadow disappears from a green tree
The flowers awake, the worldâs getting free
