Riding proud with horses wild
Wind blows in faces cold
Heading for the mystic place
Where ancient fathers found their peace

The old mighty trees
Hiding forgotten paths
Passing old desert fields
On our way to go

Black mountain
Where eagles fly high

Black mountain
Where man can reach the sky

Awake
Arise
Let the ancient speak

Black mountain
Where earth and heaven meet

Black mountain
Where tears are falling deep

Finding our destiny
We reach for secrecy
Walking on the sacred ground
Where ancient fathers forever bound

The old mighty trees
Hiding forgotten paths
Passing old desert fields
On our way to go
