Looking down on silver trees
One last glance before we leave
Listen when the wolves bark
Full moon shines in the dark

Land of the myths
Seven fortresses
Home of our hearts
Transilvania

Land of the wolves
Endless fortresses
Home of our hearts
Transilvania

One more time we raise our arms
Spirits born in banishment
Winter sun sets in the sky
We will return the day we die

Land of the myths
Seven fortresses
Home of our hearts
Transilvania

Land of the wolves
Endless fortresses
Home of our hearts
Transilvania
