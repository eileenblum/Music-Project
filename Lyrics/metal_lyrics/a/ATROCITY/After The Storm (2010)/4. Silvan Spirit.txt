He walks in endless woods
He dwells where wild flowers bloom
Where winds kissing the leaves
He is dressed in tangled limbs

Hiding in the dusk
He moves in this green valley
His soul will never rest
Waiting at this place

Hear the voice of the Silvan Spirit

This silent majesty
Labyrinth of branches and thorns
Home of restless souls
Will light shine through?

Hiding in the dusk
He moves in this green valley
His soul will never rest
Waiting at this place

Hear the voice of the Silvan Spirit

See the shades of the Silvan Spirit

His souls will never rest
Waiting at this place
