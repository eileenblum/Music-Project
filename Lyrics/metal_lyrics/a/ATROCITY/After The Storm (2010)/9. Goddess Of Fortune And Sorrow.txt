Dear Goddess of Fortune
Watch me in the sun
Lead me through crimson shells of time
Dark fall the clouds of doom

Now Iâm leaving my past behind
It hurts my soul
I see a light in you
Itâs shinning bright
It gives me hope

Goddess of Fortune
Leave me unharmed
I shall return to the home of the tree
...of the tree

Dear Goddess of Sorrow
Watch him in the dark
You led him through crimson shells of time
Dark fall the clouds of pain

He was leaving his past behind
It hurt his soul
He saw a light in you
It was shinning bright
It gave him hope

Goddess of Sorrow
Why do him harm
He shall not return to the land of the free
...of the free

Now we are leaving our past behind
It hurts our souls
We saw a light in you
It was shining bright
It gave us hope

Goddess of Fortune and Sorrow
Please, tell is why
We shall never see
The land of the free
