I see you on a magic horse
You take me away across the sea
A promise of returning back
We enter a world of mystery

Tir na nog
The Otherworld
Tir na mbeo
The otherworld

A life between fairies and ghosts
The land of the eternal youth
Living in an endless dream
My heart is longing for home

Tir na nog
The Otherworld
Tir na mbeo
The otherworld

I touch your hair of gold
You tell me not to go
Embarr, bring me home
You tell me not to go
Embarr, bring me home

Three turned into 300 years
Returning to my fatherâs land
Itâs left in ruin and despair
I set my feet on the ground

Tir na nog
The Otherworld
Tir na mbeo
The otherworld
