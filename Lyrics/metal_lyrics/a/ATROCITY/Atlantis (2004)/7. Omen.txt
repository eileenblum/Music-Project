"... When the divine portion began to fade away,
and became diluted too often and too much with the mortal admixture,
and the human nature got the upper hand,
they then, being unable to bear their fortune, behaved unseemly...

...and in a single day and night of misfortune all your warlike men
in a body sank into the earth, and the island of Atlantis in like
manner disappeared into the depths of the sea..."

[Plato 427-347 v.u.Z.]
