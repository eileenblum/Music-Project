Eleven thousand and five hundred years ago
The realm of the golden age ruling the world
Thousands of warships, ten thousands warchariots
Hundred thousands armed warriors

They are near
Shades appear

From north to south
The warlords are coming
They show no fear
From east to west
People start running
They are shedding tears

Atlantean empire

Eleven thousand and five hundred years ago
The great wealthy empire colonized the world
Temples of gold mounted with brass
Golden paradise land of dreams

They are near
Shades appear

From north to south
The warlords are coming
They show no fear
From east to west
People start running
They are shedding tears

Atlantean empire
