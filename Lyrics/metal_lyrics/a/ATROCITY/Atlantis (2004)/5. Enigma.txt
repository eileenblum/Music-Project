I see the golden roofs shining in the sun
I see stoned circles built up by strong men
Can you imaging the 8th continent buried in the deep sea down below

Can you see the mighty kingdom of old times
and the holy mountain rising up to the sky
For millenniums we've been seeking for the truth

Enigma like a secret kept inside Enigma turning darkness into light
Where it was where we're from to where have all the things gone
Only time can tell
Enigma

Words from different places meaning all the same
World's source of wisdom an "island without name"
Language and religion from the same origin lying in the deep sea down below

Pillars of Herakles a gate to another world
Birds and eels still searching for their place of birth
For millenniums a mysterious unknown land

Enigma like a secret kept inside Enigma turning darkness into light
Where it was where we're from to where have all the things gone
Only time can tell

Enigma like a secret kept inside Enigma turning darkness into light
Where it was where we're from to where have all the things gone
Only time can tell

Carved in marble pillars in the ancient Egypt
Legends in cryptic letters by Mayas and the Aztecs

For millenniums cultures give it different names
