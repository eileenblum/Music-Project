Heavy sea red burning water lava is floating
Smoke is blowing
Before it was a precious island
Now not even ruins left

Drowned to the ground of the ocean, never found again

Just it one night, one day our island swept away
We are sailing from Atlantis, the sunken paradise
Just in one night, one day
Our dreams were taken away
We are sailing from Atlantis
A soon forgotten paradise

Our ships are heading towards a new land
Hot winds are playing with our own sails
We lost our homes our place of birth
We are lost souls searching for a novel world

Drowned to the ground of the ocean never found again

Just it one night, one day our island swept away
We are sailing from Atlantis, the sunken paradise
Just in one night, one day
Our dreams were taken away
We are sailing from Atlantis
A soon forgotten paradise

We will face storm and wind
We provoked the gods : everything is lost
We moved heaven and earth
A new time, will come

One night, one day
In one night, one day

Just it one night, one day our island swept away
We are sailing from Atlantis, the sunken paradise
Just in one night, one day
Our dreams were taken away
We are sailing from Atlantis
A soon forgotten, a soon forgotten paradise
