They come across the sea from the island of eternity
Dark ships with banners high the whole world in their sight
The are the godly race suppressing every place
Occult powers reign of fear invincible technology

The bloody way on their quest day by day they never rest
Triumph is eternal
Hail the superior race obey the superior race now

Man calls them Titans and Nefilim they take over reign supreme
Until they don't defeat every land this war will never end
Warlords of golden times strong men side by side
Spilling blood on the shields they control the battlefields

The bloody way on their quest day by day they never rest
Victory essential
Hail the superior race obey the superior race now

Godlike dominance over other tribes
Inhuman malice in their mystic eyes
In a world of chaos human race is lost
Assumption of power Empires fall to dust

... Fall to dust!

The bloody way on their quest day by day they never rest
Triumph is eternal
Hail the superior race obey the superior race now

The bloody way on their quest day by day they never rest
Victory essential
Hail the superior race obey the superior race now
