It was the mighty empire fallen from grace
The ten glorious kingdoms of the superior race
Created by ancient Gods dominion in days of yore
Rulers from the unknwon land not found anymore

Reich of Phenomena kingdom of the damned
where nations were born and mankind's fate was sealed
Reich of Phenomena epoch of the damned
The Fall of Man was the downfall in the end

The island far away to where no man has gone
Places all over the world meant to be the one
Inscriptions of the past forever they are lost
Kings from the unknown land reigned from coast to coast

Reich of Phenomena kingdom of the damned
where nations were born and mankind's fate was sealed
Reich of Phenomena epoch of the damned
The Fall of Man was the downfall in the end

The old world power kept the occult inside
from the ancient times into the new age

Reich of Phenomena kingdom of the damned
where nations were born and mankind's fate was sealed
Reich of Phenomena epoch of the damned
The Fall of Man was the downfall in the end
