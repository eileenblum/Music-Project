Poseidon loved Cleito
A new dynasty was born
Five twin pairs to be kings
Demigods are enthroned

Colourless blood power of the Gods
They would perish and die without the sacred sap

Mysterious fluid of the Gods
When they shed their blood mortals die by just one touch

Their destiny will ever be bound with them all even if they rise or fall
Their destiny will ever be bound to the oath they gave by their birth
Ichor blood of Gods

Dynasty of ten kingdoms
Realm of demigods
Ten kings of mighty strenght
Immortal blood in their veins

Colourless blood power of the Gods
They would perish and die without the sacred sap

Mysterious fluid of the Gods
When they shed their blood mortals die by just one touch

Their destiny will ever be bound with them all even if they rise or fall
Their destiny will ever be bound to the oath they gave by their birth
Ichor blood of Gods

Atlas and Gadeirus, Ampheres and Evaemon
Mneseus and Autochthon, Elasippus and Mestor
Azaes and Diaprepes rulers of Atlantis
