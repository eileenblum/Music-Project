Get away and your life will be released
Give away all your dreams and all your sins

You are playing for forgiveness
You cry for help
When your life is over who can tell
You can't change anything
Your life is just a dream
Nothing real nothing more
Nothing left cause

These are cold black days and
You're fading away
Life cold dark nights
And you're longing for light
These are cold days
And you're running away
To be alive again
To be alive again

Look around emptiness and you are falling
Hear the sound the peal of bells is tolling
You remember sunny days these times are gone
All the lovely words are said and done
You can't change all the things
Your life is full of dreams
Nothing real nothing more
Nothing left cause
