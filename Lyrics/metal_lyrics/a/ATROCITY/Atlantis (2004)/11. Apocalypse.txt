The war was lost swords turned to rust
Suddenly these was a great light
Wrath of gods shining bright

Deadly rain from the sky
Erupting hills
A naton damned to die
Withering fire on the fields

Apocalypse
The end of the golden age
Apocalypse
Divine judgement
Apocalypse
The end of the golden age
Apocalypse
Godlife punishment

Wild raging waters
Caused chain reactions
Ocean turns to a deadly wave
The deluge a watery grave

Death sentence by the gods
Legacy remains
High-spirited world explodes
The golden kingdom in flames

Apocalypse
The end of the golden age
Apocalypse
Divine judgement
Apocalypse
The end of the golden age
Apocalypse
Godlife punishment
