I'm the God of Gods ruler in the sky
I control Gods and Man the ancient of all days
The call me God of Ocean I dominate the seas
Earthquakes show my anger without boundaries

Catastrophes Unseen force Ancient Gods Almighty powers

Born into primal chaos
Fallen from the black skies

We are the Gods of Nations the world belongs to us
From the hills into the oceans we are Gods of Dawn and Dusk

I am the God of Dead I rule the underworld
I bring eternal wisdom I show mankind its' fate
When I look into the sky there's no light I see
Only death and misery the twilight of the Gods

Endlessly Eternally Reign on earth Our destiny

Born into primal chaos
Fallen from the black skies

We are the Gods of Nations the world belongs to us
From the hills into the oceans we are Gods of Dawn and Dusk

We are the Gods of Nations
We are the Gods
We are the Gods of Nations
We are Gods of Dawn and Dusk
