My soul in the maze of darkness
The abyss of mental sickness
My life is doomed eternally
The blackened sight of eternity

Agony leads my immortal life
Even darker than the darkest midnight
Disillusion is the pain you feel
Blood is my Avatar and my seal

In my mind morbid lust
In my mind morbid thoughts
Thirsting for another life
Visions of a morbid mind
In my mind morbid hate
In my mind morbid rage
Seeking for another life
Creature with a morbid mind

Blood flows like melted metal
The creation of all evil
Enter the ways of obsurity
Drink the blood of immortality

Agony leads my immortal life
Even darker than the darkest midnight
Disillusion is the pain you feel
Blood is my Avatar and my seal
