Warclash of the titans
War of primeval nations

Out of the fog warships appear final conquest of the empire's fleet
War has some across the sea one continent has to bleed
Thousands have come warriors of doom heavy armour heralds of gloom
Swords are drawn banners are high the hells spawn has arised

The atlantean fleet sails against the hellens
The final tried of the open sea
The atlantean fleet sails against the crypts
The final tried of ancient history

Warclash of the titans
War of primeval nations

Point of impact thrown spears cause and effect crushing shields
Smashing bones helmets break atlantean troops overtake
Battle rages face to face flesh and blood without grace
Atlantean force skilled warfare demigods spreading fear

The atlantean fleet sails against the hellens
The final tried of the open sea
The atlantean fleet sails against the crypts
The final tried of ancient history

Warclash of the titans
War of primeval nations

War has come days of doom fortune's gone
Blood will run battle is done untergang attack

The turning point of the battle
Armies prepare for the last strike

Warclash of the titans
War of primeval nations

Clash of the titans downfall
Clash of the titans destruction
Clash of the titans
