Aeon

We seeked for a new life we found places to stay
We came from aztlan a land far away
Over the ocean will we ever see
Our native country rising up the sea
We are the survivors keeping the heritage
The fruits of sins the wisdom of the kings

Hear our calling
Aeon

Longing for a new home we found landscapes to stay
We came from atlantion an island far away
Bringing mystic culture all around the globe
People from the old world escaping the flood
We are the survivors keeping the heritage
The fruits of sins the wisdom of the kings

Forever calling
Aeon

We built up a world of wonder we built it stone by stone
It will remain forever ever if we are gone

Aeon
Hear our call
Aeon

We are the survivors keeping the heritage
The fruits of sins the wisdom of the kings

Hear our calling
Forever calling
