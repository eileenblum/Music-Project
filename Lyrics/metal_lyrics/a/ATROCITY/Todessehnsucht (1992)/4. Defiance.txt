[RÃ¦derer, Scharf / Krull]

I'm walking into opaque nothingless
No one can save my return
Predition made another disconsolated creation
Which is acting against it's "Free will"

Will-   my only will is still alive
Pride-  let me resist and survive
Hate-  gives enormous strenght

Defiance

Pain-   I feel so tired
Love-  my love is dying
But-    my dignity is unviolable

Defiance

Path-  of uncertainty
Is-      nutritive
For-   a further existence

Unfathomable, ruthless world
I'm lost, I'm born into
Once the time will come
To accept the battle

"Since mankind's existence
There's an endless war
Between human beings"

Every night the same returning vision
My only foothold on the brink
The piteous fall of the "antagonist"
And finally I will win

Will-   my only will is still alive
Pride-  let me resist and survive
Hate-  gives enormous strenght

Defiance

Eyes-    like flames of fire
Fear-     non of those things
Which-  thou shall suffer

Defiance

Once again it's time for another grave
Another execution is done
Are violence and senseless actions
The human fate ?
Perfect bodies-  imperfect brains
