[Scharf, Klasen, Schwarz, RÃ¦derer / Krull]

Hot desire, staggering passion
Graving complection and pefection
Made us blind
Greed of completeness made us, man
To subject and vassales of ourselves
Presumpteous creatures
How narrow are you ?
Self-aggrandized, destructive individuals
The believing in yourself
Growing up to selfishness
Egoism discards moral and ethics

Godless years shall arise
Godless years are devined
We provoke the death
We're damned to die

Mass-corruption dominates
World of lies and of sin
Godless years
We all live in

Self-nominated gods
You're only god's image
Those who believe in eternal resignation
Await your final downfall

Godless years shall arise
Godless years are devined
We provoke the death
We're damned to die

Mass-corruption dominates
World of lies and of sin
Godless years
We all live in

Lost in megalomania, unclean human beings (are)
Drunken by blood
Having the force
To judge about life and death
Never prudent, always merciless

Kingdom of waste and poverty, unclean human beings
Thirst for power
Might and pride
Glitter and gold rape their intellect
Rejection is calling primitive instincts

Godless years shall arise
Godless years are devined
We provoke the death
We're damned to die

Mass-corruption dominates
World of lies and of sin
Godless years
We all live in

Infamous world, whore, called babylon
Godless years, death to us..... and fear !

Hot desire, staggering passion
Craving completion and perfection
Greed of completeness made us, man
To subjects and vassales
Of ourselves

How much you have
Glorified yourself
So much torment and sorrow you'll get
Horde of protical sons
Await your final downfall

Godless years shall arise
Godless years are devined
We provoke the death
We're damned to die

Mass-corruption dominates
World of lies and of sin
Godless years
We all live in
