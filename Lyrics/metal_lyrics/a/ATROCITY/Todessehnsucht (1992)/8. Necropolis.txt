[Scharf, RÃ¦derer / Krull]

Every night of my favor
Every night I'm gonna meet you
I love your coldness
Let me touch your deadly emptiness

Necropolis

Faded flowers
I like the smell of rotten beauty
Forsaken gravestone
Every morning I find myself lying on

Necropolis

Scene of horror- place of peace
Theatre of macabre- everlasting feast
Forbidden pleasure- my secret love
Wistful trauma- eternal resting place
Disembody lust- your body is dust
Blackened lady- womb of the dead

Darkness warms me
Dancing all night on the graves
My sweet 'tender'
One day I'll join you forever

Necropolis
