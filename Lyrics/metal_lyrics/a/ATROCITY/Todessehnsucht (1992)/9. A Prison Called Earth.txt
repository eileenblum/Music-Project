[RÃ¦derer / Krull]

(Worths, norms!)

I look in the mirror and what I can see is one face with abandoment
I can't hide myself and I'm not free, living in mental abesement

Imprison

The rising sun awakes gleams of hope, but who does trust them anymore?
A life in disillusion shows the truth of this gloomy glamour

Imprison

Wherever I walk on earth- a neverending search
My present is my past- my future hopeless
Live the dying world! - injustice
The vicious circle turns- impetuous
From child, adolescent, adult, age of death
Systematic clearence- disheartening experience
No time, no place- for a righteous change

No god, no preach could save my will to live
Death was and will be
All my dreams, all my wishes like a small heap of ashes
Emotions, feelings they are gone- being formed and educated by.....

.....A prison called earth
Your end is your birth- a prison called earth
Self-realization's death- a prison called earth
