[Schuldiner / Krull]

And there was war in heaven
Michael and his angels
Fought against the dragon
(And) the dragon fought, and his angels

And he prevailed not
Neither was their place
Found anymore
In heaven

Archangel

And the (great) dragon was cast out
That old serpent
Called the devil and satan
Which deceiveth the whole world

Therefore rejoice
Ye heavens !
And ye that dwell
With them

Archangel

Woe to the inhabiters
Of the earth and of the sea
For devil is come into you
Unto you, having great wrath

Having great wrath
Because he knoweth
That he hath
But a short time... to reign on earth

Archangel
