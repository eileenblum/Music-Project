[RÃ¦derer, Klasen / Krull]

(Listen to the unspoken names !)

I see the horror day by day
Only the sight shudders me
World fail me, confuse me
In there any explanation ?

I shall not find
One name or kind
What's behind

Forbidden thoughts
Keep me silent
Opress me

Every hour- every minute, every second

Conscience pangs
Heart beats
Mind rotates- endlessly

I feel the shock in my face
How worse is the human race ?
Words fail me, confuse me
Is there any explanation

Uncertainty
Spreads abroad
Makes me sick

Hidden truth
Face of death
Morbid conflict

Unintentional
Awful fate
Mental terror

Impose silence
Forced to be
Under control- by myself

War inside my head
Forbidden what should be sayed
Unspoken names

Twisted and obscure
Nothing less than more
Unspoken names

"No solution
Only thinking
Is not changing
Anything"

War of letters
Ends in madness
Call me coward
I'm a liar !

War inside my head
Forbidden what should be sayed
Unspoken names

Twisted and obscure
Nothing less than more
Unspoken names

I shall not find
One name or kind
What's behind

Forbidden thoughts
Keep me silent
Oppress me

Every hour- every minute- every second

Conscience pangs
Heart beats
Mind rotates- endlessly

Nothing less and more
Unspoken names
Nothing less and more
Unspoken names
