The Earth has suffered since the day
As mankind went insane
Children are playing on infected grounds
Fish and birds are shooed out of their areas
...When the fire burns over the seas
Polluted water, polluted air
Dying animals everywhere
day by day more devastations
Politicians have senseless discussions
...When the fire burns over the seas
...When the fire burns over the seas

Chemicals destroy the whole nature
Radioactive waste becomes a threat
Dying forests and cancer are the consequence
Isn't there anything we can do?
...When the fire burns over the seas
...over the world !!!
