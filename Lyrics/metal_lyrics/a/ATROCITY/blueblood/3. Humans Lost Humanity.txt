Humans lost humanity
Feelings are dead
The world is one machinery
Humans lost humanity
Success dominates
Without regard to casualties
You're one link in a big chain
Without success you're nothing
The individual doesn't count
Profit is more important than a man
People are dying from starvation
and price policy destroys tons of food

Humans lost humanity
feelings are dead
The world is one machinery
Humans lost humanity
Success dominates
Without regard to casualties
You're a product of society
Controlled by the stress of working
No love for little children
no care for old people
Daily round kills all feelings
Parents maltreat and rape their children
more psychopaths and sexual crimes
Ecocide cause of economic growth
Some people take refuge in drugs
And love is for sale
More weapons for more senseless wars
some people laugh while world suffers
