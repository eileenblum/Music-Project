Still being of noble birth
Though having Oppressed the Earth
Being better off than all
Contrasting with the rabble
Still crowning each other
Insisting on the old manners
Celebrating splendid feasts
Representation of the states

Blue Blood Nobility
Resist High Society !!!

Living in gorgeous world
Having money and much gold
Stories in the gossip column
Showing up in a high position
Still possessing power and might
Being proud of their descent
Supported by the media
The blind crowds cheer them

Blue Blood Nobility
Resist High Society !!!

Pride - Class Hatred - Opulence - Arrogance

Take their jewels and their gold
Occupy their castles
Seize their landed property
drive aristocrats away

Residing in a palace
Wearing expensive clothes
people should be fascinated
But appearances are deceptive

Lies - Dulling Your Mind - Sham - Cheat

Blue Blood Nobility
Resist High Society !!!
