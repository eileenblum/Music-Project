[Music: Roderer/Schwarz/Klasen/Scharf]
[Lyrics: Krull]

I left cocaine - going insane
my first time - I want to try

I lock the door - I'm really sure
Now I'm alone - the needle in my skin

Defeated intellect - I lost my mind
I know all dangers - but I need more
I inject - now it's too late
Fantastic feelings - coming to ecstasy

Lying in the room - she closes her eyes
Fast raving blood - in her veins
Falling apart - total dilirium
Point of no return - shall overcome

[Lead: Roderer]

There is no serious reason
To give up my decision
I live my life today
I give a shit on any corollary

Step by step you go on,
leave your life in death's hand

Your body is shaking, freezing, perspiring
Opening your eyes, having reveries
Walls look like ice, cold and glinting
The shining sun, reflected lights
Senseless thoughts, nameless words
You cannot act, you have no will
Controlled by poison, suddenly you scream
Father returns: "Get on your knees!"

[Lead: Roderer]

Breathing heavily - oppressive atmosphere
Whispering voices - in your ears
Having red eyeballs - and a dry tongue
attack of giddiness - head is going round

People on the street - walk, rush and speak
Eat, drink, consume - money takes control

They don't care - about you
No time to think - no help for you
