[Music: Roderer]
[Lyrics: Krull]

I meet a girl - she seems ok
She wants to show me all her friends

But what I can see - I known before
Their red eyes - the same as my Ma's!

The invite me to drink and to take some pills
"You should smoke a pot of hash, too!"
I try to refuse but I wanna integrate
"Don't be a coward - just become our friend!"

"YOU!"
"Just become our friend!"
"TRY!"
"Then you feel like us!"
"TO BE!"
"Without any sorrows!"
"FREE!"
"Without any restraint!"

I want to know these miracle drugs
I want to taste the feelings of them

Beautiful things - in her mind
Thousands of colors - wonderful sounds

Give me some more!

This is your first step to your death!
