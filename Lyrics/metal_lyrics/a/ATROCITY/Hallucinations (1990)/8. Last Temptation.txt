[Music: Roderer]
[Lyrics: Krull]

[Lead: Roderer]

Shuddering night, empty strets, a cat cries
a barking dog, one little girl
on her way to eternity

In her hand, a plastic bag, one cigarette
To calm down, a sad face
Lost her friend, her hopefulness

Eyes full of tears, but have no fear, no hope
Senseless life, no escape
Only white powder, which could help

Arteries are craving, head is exploding
Thoughts are running, hands are shivring 
Nerves go crazy, stomach is vibrating

[Lead: Roderer]

A gloomy station, one toilet room
Ugly smell, dirty walls
Drunken men, horrible sluts
Hey, little girl, go away!

A candle is burning, to cook the stuff
The spoon is filled, with deadly fluid
Syringe is fixed, to shoot inside

In her young flesh
The neal forces one's way
The poison spreads in blood
Runs from body in head
Pain ache let you suffer
Drug creates a horror trip
You see disturbing visions
You go out of your mind

[Lead: Roderer]

Shuddering night, empty strets, a cat cries
a barking dog, one little girl
on her way to eternity

On the ground, this little girl, one syringe
Full of smut, cold body
Lost all love, in her world

[Lead: Roderer]

You wanted, to stop it, forget it
It should be, your last time
You want to do, then to finish

[Lead: Roderer]

Last temptation ends one life
But who cares? But who cries?
