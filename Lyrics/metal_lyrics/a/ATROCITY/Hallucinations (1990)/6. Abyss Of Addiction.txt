[Music: Roderer]
[Lyrics: Krull]

In the dark night, pleasures arise
Searching for lust, thirst for sex
The oldest business, in this world
Shows itself, a whole night long

She stands here - waiting for - another John
One more night - it doesn't count - anyway
No way out - a stranded girl - in red light
Expensive stuff - let you work - at this place

Seductive syringe

Those old false friends - they're gone - left her alone
A big car stops - an old man inside - ugly and fat
"How much is it?" - "I'm rich" - "So let's go!"
The next morning - you'll buy - another ration

[Lead: Roderer]

Having no hope - my time is timeless
Worthless bulk - only for earning money
Used to be - a MANhandled  person
Lost the pride - of a lighthearted girl

Seductive syringe
Abyss of Addiction
ABYSS OF ADDICTION!
