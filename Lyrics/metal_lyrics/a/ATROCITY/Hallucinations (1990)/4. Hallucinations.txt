[Lead: Roderer]

Here I got it in my hands
The stuff which creates dreams
So I smoke it, I consume it
to get free, to feel well

I will be in sweet dreams
I will be stoned again

You feel it deep inside
Is it wrong or is it right?
All the things that you feel
Are not true are not real

Life is easy, life is carefree
Hallucinations!

Fuck reality, now I'm free
Doing what I want, only having fun
So I smoke it, I consume it
To get free, to feel well

Life is easy, life is carefree
Hallucinations!

[Lead: Rodere]

I'm flying over, I think clear
Being suspended, heave is near
...Or is it hell?

No one can stop me, this is my time
Be careful, guys, here comes me
self-confident, you will see

The drug inside me, gives me energy
Gives me power, let me win
No more failures, the world is mine!

[Lead: Roderer]

I will be in sweet dreams

All the things that you feel
Are not true, are not real

Life is easy, life is carefree
Hallucinations!
