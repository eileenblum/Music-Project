[Music: Roderer/Klasen]
[Lyrics: Krull]

"You are here again
At this wicked place
Men look at you
They want to pay the price"
Somebody speaks to you
He wants to set you free
He wants to be your real friend
"It's time for you to leave"

He is an addict, too
He needs the same help
Both have the same aim
To escape from this hell
After a few years
They want to come together
Make a withdrawal treatment
And encourage each other:

Hold out to the end
Resist ...and live

After midnight you hear screams
Addicted bodies wnat their rations
Painful days, sleepless nights
Always greedy of more pills, of more pills

[Lead: Roderer]

Take care of your life

After one week without H
They're thinkning it's all over
Having new hope and courage
Time to leave their dirty flat, dirty flat!

One new man is born
One new girl is born
Death can wait for them
Now they wanna live!
Full of happiness
Both are careless
Going out of the flat
To walk down the streets

[Lead: Roderer]

She reads the newspaper of today
Another guy died by an overdose
But new victims are ready to die
Smiling faces of the big bosses
These rich, powerful, common men
Making business, dealing death
She is shocked by reality
He is going out with "old friends"

Late in the night
The girl is coming home
After closing the door
She looks to the ground
The boy is lying there
One paper in the hand:
"I couldn't still resist
But you must go on:

Hold out to the end
Resist ...and live!"

Hold out!
