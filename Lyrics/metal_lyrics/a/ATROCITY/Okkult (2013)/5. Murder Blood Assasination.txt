Tyrannicide, tyrannicide
Prior to the Ides of March in 44 B.C.
Knives were sharpened bys senators
Bound by conspiracy
Sacrificial animal found without a heart
Calpurniaâs foreseen dream
Premonition full of blood

The tyrant must die
Beware the Ides of March

[Chorus]
Murder; Murder, Blood, Assassination
The Omen comes true
This is the Murder, Blood, Assassination

Cave Idus Martias
Beware the Ides of March
Warnings of the soothsayer brushed aside
At once
Sealing fatal destiny
Day of reckoning
The plotters of nobility
Seeking revenge

The tyrant must die
Day of Reckoning

[Chorus]
Murder; Murder, Blood, Assassination
The Omen comes true
This is the Murder, Blood, Assassination

Stabbed 23 times
One infamous kill
Ivory images wept for grief
Rivers standing still

The tyrant must die!

[Chorus]
Murder; Murder, Blood, Assassination
The Tyrant Must Die!
The Omen comes true
This is the Murder, Blood, Assassination
Tyrannicide!
Tyrannicide!
