In ancient scriptures legends are told
We were always there, we will always be hidden in shadows
The keepers of times, the keepers of knowledge
We will never die
We are gods, eternal damnation
March! March of the undying
March! March of the undying
We carried our knowledge through generations
Millenniums - we live in secrecy
Survived pestilence, war and destructions
Lost our homes in misery
Back from the dead, born again to judge you
March! March of the undying
March! March of the undying
We look down on you, oh mankind
We look down on you
You will never understand
We look down on you
Once your journey comes to and end, we'll reveal to you
We look down on you
We travel through time, no goal in sight
Darkness our home, tidal our lifeblood
We are gods, we shall never disappear
March! March of the undying
March! March of the undying
