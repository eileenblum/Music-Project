They came down from the sky
Lords of ancient lands afflicted
Primal tribes await the final stand
Natives praise their Gods
Lords are taking lives with lethal secret powers
No one shall survive
Light to stay alive, the very last bottle
Blast through the skull
Death by metal, death by metal
Striking back with wood and stones
Hiding in the fields
Dying lone with broken bones
Bloody heads are yields
Supreme high technology versus primal life
Despair and brutality, instinct to survive
Kill to stay alive, there is no tomorrow
Blast through the skull
Death by metal, death by metal
They try to flee into the caves
But we will bring them down
There is no more escape
There's nowhere else to run
We march with almighty
Weapons in our hands
We take their lives and in the end
We will take their land
Death by metal
Our march goes on with weapons mighty in our hands
First we take their lives away
Then we take their land
Death by metal, fight to stay alive
The very last bottle
Blast through the skull
Death by metal
Kill to stay alive
There is no tomorrow
Blast through the skull
Death by metal, death by metal
