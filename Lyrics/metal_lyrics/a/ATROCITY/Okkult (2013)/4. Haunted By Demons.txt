Night embraces the day as darkness find its way
You can hear the voices whispering
The wraith called lady in green
Ghosts and ghouls are coming in the night
Seeking for revenge, the spook begins
Haunted by demons - this place is cursed eternally
Haunted by demons - left in pain and misery
One wife starved to death, indelible blood stains
One guest over the centuries
There will be no more peace
Ghosts and ghouls are coming in the night
Forever weeping stone, the spook begins
Haunted by demons - cursed in eternity
Haunted by demons - once built from sanctuary
Thou will never thrive, as long as there's in thee stones three
There's one in the oldest tower
There's one int he lady's bower
There's one in the water-gate
And these three stones you'll never get
Haunted by demons - this place is cursed eternally
Haunted by demons - left in pain and misery
Haunted by demons - cursed in eternity
Haunted by demons - once built from sanctuary
