Dark mistress, midwife of distress in the back streets of Paris
She took from the poor and served to the rich
Sold innocence brought to death
Dressed up in a crimson cloak embroidered with eagles in gold
Teller of fortune, annihilator of life
Priests spill blood of the innocent
Bones of toads, teeth of moles
Spanish flies and human blood
Corpses dust, juice of bats concoct the Devil's brew
La Voisine - sorceress of evil
La Voisine - prisoner of the Devil
Astaroth and Asmodaeus worshipped by her secret coven
Voluptuous bodies, human altars, sinister blood-soaked ceremonies
Aprhodisiacs for the royal mistress
Inheritance powder for nobility lead her
From the "glowing chamber" to the burning stake
Bones of toads, teeth of moles
Spanish flies and human blood
Corpse dust, juice of bats concoct the Devil's brew
La Voisine - priestess of evil
La Voisine - hand of the Devil
Let the ritual begin!
Consecrated water inside the deep
Unholy prayers in ecstasy
La Voisine - sorceress of evil
La Voisine - poisoner of the Devil
La Voisine - priestess of evil
La Voisine - hand of the Devil
Poisoner of the Devil
