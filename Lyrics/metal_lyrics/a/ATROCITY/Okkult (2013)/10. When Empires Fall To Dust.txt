A strange holy man appeared in the first year of war
A freemason hiding in an old monastery
The French prophet telling of obscure deadly visions
Of years in pain, the days of retribution
When empires fall to dust, when empires fall to dust
Seven dark men, rulers of the world
Seven dark men, one to rule them all
Seven dark men, bring back the gallows
Seven dark men, broad rivers shallow
Seven dark men, irons turns to rust
Seven dark men, empires fall to dust
The unknown prophet telling of obscure morbid vision
Fire-breathing mountains, the days of divine retribution
When empires fall to dust, when empires fall to dust
Seven dark men, rulers of the world
Seven dark men, one to rule them all
Seven dark men, antichrist born
Seven dark men, a nation war-torn
Seven dark men, continents bust
Seven dark men, empires fall to dust, empires fall to dust
When empires fall to dust
