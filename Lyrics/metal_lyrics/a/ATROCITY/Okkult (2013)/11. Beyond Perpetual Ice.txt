There where no man dares to go
There where the cold is relentless
Where myths are born
Where the last hidden secrets are frozen
Look up to the sky and see their iron wings
Their secret lies forever beyond perpetual ice
There where eternal frost reigns
The legendary fortress of ice, impregnable
Invincible by secret weapons art
Look up to the sky and see their iron wings
Their secret lies forever beyond perpetual ice
Look up the the sky and see their iron wings
Your secret lies forever beyond perpetual ice
