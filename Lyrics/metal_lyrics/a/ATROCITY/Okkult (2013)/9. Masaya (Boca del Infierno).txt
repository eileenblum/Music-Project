Hellmouth opens, dense smoke rises
Deadly invitation, macabre celebration
Ashes fall
Infernal faces
Blood-red darkness
The smell of sulphur is the Devil's scent
Boca del infierno
Enter the pits of Hell
Boca del infierno
Enter the pits of Hell
Masaya, Masaya, Masaya
Further int he deep await your destiny
You will never see again another ray of light, you die
Mankind's fear deep in the ground
Blood rituals for the gods
Sacrifice of innocence to save them all from Hell
For the gates are open
Hellmouth opened, dense smoke rising
Deadly invitation
Macabre celebration
Burst in flames, infernal faces
Blood-red darkness
The smell of sulphur is the Devil's scent
Boca del infierno
Enter the pits of Hell
Boca del infierno
Enter the pits of Hell
Masaya, Masaya, Masaya
