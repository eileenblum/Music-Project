Sick. I'm sick of what you are
You took away all that I believe
Pray on those
That reach out in need
You chose the right victim

Now I'm torn apart
Are you happy??

I'm dangling by the throat
With a pain in my chest
You set these traps
To bring me down
You've taken all the matters
Ill never bleed for you
But I hold this hope
You'll bleed for me
I beg bleed for me

Bleed for me

Whispers in the ears
Of those who listen
Transform the one that cares
Turn this against me
This is my final blow

Are you happy now?
I'm dangling
By the throat
With a pain in my chest
You set these traps
To bring me down
