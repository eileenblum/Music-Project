Empty faces
In this crowd
Express nothing
Make no sound

Lost on the hope
That's burning in my eyes
I try to let go
But this pain wont subside
Anchored in this sea of denial
Who will you turn to
When your time runs out?

Lead to the water
Shepparded by your delusions
Drink from this river of lies

Let go of all that you
Believed
A life
Raised
On these lies

This is my final chance
My final chance all that I have left
