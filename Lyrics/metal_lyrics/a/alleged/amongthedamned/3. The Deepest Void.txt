Cant you see
That this world
Has drowned in blood
I feel we are hopeless
To build the faith
That we held in ourselves
All senses severed
This blind eye had been turned to many times

When you listen can you hear this weeping heart
The sorrow never ending
Always feeding
Leading is
As we crawl on blood stained hands

When is it to late to reach out?
When is it too late to care?
Your hands are never tied
Your voice is never gagged
And still you do nothing

When you listen can you hear this weeping heart?
The sorrow never ending when you listen
The sorrow. It never ends

Feel these tears in your eyes
Brace yourself
Look to the sky
You feeling these tears welling in your eyes
I feel we are lost

Cry out to the sky
Feel the tears in your eyes
Brace yourself
The splendour we held is lost
