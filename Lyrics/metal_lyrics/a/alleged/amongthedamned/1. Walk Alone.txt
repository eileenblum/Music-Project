Hand over my soul
This futures in your hands
Control my every move
A slave without a service
Discarded in disgrace
I walk alone
This is the path I've chosen
For myself
And now I walk it alone

My eyes held open
By the thought of you
This sleep is my only comfort
Pain is my last escape

Dismantled without you
I cant myself
Or pick up the pieces
Hack me apart
Lead astray
By what held us a apart

My eyes held open
Sleep is my comfort
You in this darkness
I try and find you
In this darkness

A darkness that wont end
And I fall away from you
