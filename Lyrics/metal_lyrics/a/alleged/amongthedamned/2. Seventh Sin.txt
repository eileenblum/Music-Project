Look eye to eye
The mess you've made
Impaled by your ignorance
Seep into the floor
These wounds
Cant be healed
A soul now drowned
In anguish incomplete
And wanting more

A burden on your weighting back
Clawing to hold on
Lifeless
Facedown
I crawl back to your side
Your soul intent to hold me down

Respect help tight inside your hands
Never given away
This lust grows deep inside
Addicted to you re pride

A taste to good to swallow
Feel it burn
You to nothing
This trust I held in you
Destroyed

Take the knife from my back
Steal the promise I offer
You know you want it all
But that's all I have to give
