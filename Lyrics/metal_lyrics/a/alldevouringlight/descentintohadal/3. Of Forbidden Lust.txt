Through centuries past
They have but lied to you all
So I shall rise as your new messiah
Under my bloodstained reign
Shall you born and shall you die

These verses shall haunt you 'til the end of time
Torn you apart and drown you to insanity
These scars will mark you as a seed of carnal sin
Of forbidden lust from which you were born

Receive it and react
The darkness seeding within
For all knowledge is power
And the power is mine
