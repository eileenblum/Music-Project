Twisting neath this putrid skin
Like burning thorns in this rotten flesh
Fade to the night my child

The skin is numb
Twisted grin, terror sweat
A state of peace

As above, so below
Forevermore, nevermore

Dead but dreaming
The eye is all-seeing
Dead but dreaming
Is your master made of lies

Crawling through this useless shell
Hallucinating in this dream-like state
Within me is all and everything

Chaos shall reign
