The last day finally dawns
As the signs of final judgement can be seen above
Alignment of the withering lights in the sky
Is complete, releasing Armageddon

The seas roam in endless rage
Drowning the light, feasting on it's downfall
Paint this soil with the blood of the fallen
Rape their futile faith

Lay destruction upon the breed of lie
Arm them with serenity
Blind their eyes with the luring light
Welcoming them with arms open wide

Awaken the serpent
Who sleeps in the deep beneath

The prophecy to into reality
The gods of despair in flesh
Abnormal entities
Freed from their slumber

Awaken the serpent
Who sleeps in the deep beneath
Who forever dwells
Underneath the waves

The heavens wept upon
This damned and darkened world
While somewhere deep beneath
In the stillness of the sea

The beast opened it eyes
And gazed towards the gates of dawn
End and eternities
Bring this nation to it's battered knees
