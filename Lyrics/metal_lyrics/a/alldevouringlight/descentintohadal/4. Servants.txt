Seeding inside of their hearts
The stillborn darkness, waiting to be called to arms
Slowly it feeds
On the darkest fears of man
Stand united, the servants to the eternal dark

There is no light

To rid the disease
Know as the human race
To wipe out
The hypocrisy
Shall the divine light fade to black
And erase the rotten sons of god

Seeding among their lines
The wicked temptation, reaching for their weakened minds
Slowly infecting
Feeding from a divine source
Live forever, servants to the blinding dark

Fear shall thou not
For the darkness's embrace
For bless become the cursed and the wicked
under an huntress moon
Tempting howls can be heard
From the lairs of the damned
