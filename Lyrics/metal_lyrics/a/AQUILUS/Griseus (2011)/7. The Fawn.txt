Walking in fawn
Bereft and lovelorn

O burning horizon how voluptuous you are
Forgotten in time these moments shall succumb

Cast through a gossamer cloak
Aethereal lamplight drapes your hoary fane

I am those ruins, decaying in the rain
My heart aflame bequeathed to dirt

A harrowing aculeus bedighted in fawn
