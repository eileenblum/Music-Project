Staring into the bitter dark
Embraced by your squall

Mere longing
Sober and without wings
Enchainment in a baleful realm

A moment of beauty
A whisper of death
Impending doom through sea fog dispelled
Lorn
A grisaille reaved and thoughtworn
Abyssal despair befalls the wilted

The annihilation of being
Watching precious moments wither

Writ in my blood from birth
Blight dawns upon the desolate
The wretched brumal robes of the accurst

Loss under an austere sun
Burnt into the rue of dusk
Holding the fallen ash
A sere close

Lost, trapped in a pathless wood
Under an ashen sky
Only content in my final breath
Will I be?
