As we rot
On yesterday's path
Forgotten bridges over blackened rivers

Veins of life reaching out
Trails end in yesternight's garden

We travel through the eclipse and reach the nostalgic dawn
Falling asleep in the still wood
The dead frond of thought, taken with the wind
Imparts a requiem

O vile beauty
With a lurid veil
I heard your scream
In that unearthly dream

O maudlin being
Of mortal anguish
An ardent desire
Had lain within your mire
