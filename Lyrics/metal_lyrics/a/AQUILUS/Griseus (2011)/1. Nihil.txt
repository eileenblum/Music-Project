Skulking dusk enfolds the underwood

An ardour like the fallen petals
The dead relics of a past chapter still beloved

Mountain winds caress
And soothe my lustful soul
To quieten my bleak breast
And enchant the dreams of old

A lone sea grave under tendrilous waves
Birds beneath clouds dark and wild

Beyond the moon set and tempest within
Unutterable woe's reach for eternal rest

I arose from the dream
And you were gone
Still embracing ashes of what never was

The torment of nothingness
