Serene sleep
Where willows still weep
Triste thoughts remain dormant
Tranquillity with silent dead below the lea

Queen of my dead dreams
Mistress of my misery
She fain kissed her sickle into wintery flesh
Vermeil rills of my malady pour forth

Avian engravings immersed in my hearth
Susurrant swaying of ancients
Silhouettes of seduction I espy
The beatified damsel now bestilled in trammels

Drear outside is the scene these eves
The seasons change and drizzle reigns
I hearken to her euphony
Evading the cacophony beyond

'Follow my voice' she bid unto me once more
In a nocturne of moonlit slumber I still adore
