A curled leaf arid
The autumnal mark of time

A tryst with rain on my verdurous swarth
Fair dew and earth is blent
Down to the sodden vale
A freshet shrouds her rivulets

Moonbeam gleams on wintering waves
The vanquished day swealed to isabelline

A plume adorns plutonian pallor
Verily beauteous dusky tresses
Enthralled by silken bredes
Winnowing sallows writhing sombrely
A funereal valediction looms
