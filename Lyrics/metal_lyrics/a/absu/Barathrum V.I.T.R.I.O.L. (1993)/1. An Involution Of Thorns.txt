Darksome night and ardent moon,
The chalice is passed, then ye fall North;
Hearken to the enchantress' rune--
Listen to the words to cry ye forth.
Earth and water, ether and fire,
Wand and pentacle and sword,
Toil ye unto our desire,
Hearken ye unto our word.
Unfettered and censet, scourge and knife,
Powers of the enchantress' blade--
Waken all ye into life,
Come ye as the charm is made.
