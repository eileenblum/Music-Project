[DESTRUCTION Cover]
[Recorded at Rehearsal May 10, 1996 in Carrollton / Texas]

Early morning, mankind sleeps
thereÂ´s a roaring in the air
inpenetrable fog
Thunder rolls and lightning strikes
hell storms, rush over the earth
but thereÂ´s no rain
Hell storms, rush over the earth
Bestial Invasion
Fog cleared up, people scream
they wonÂ´t believe that the evil takes control
Hell storms, rush over the earth
Bestial Invasion
Your time is out, obsession spreads
death rules, satans law is in command
Jesus Christ exists no longer
You better pray to the new lord
'cause heÂ´s almighty obey him
