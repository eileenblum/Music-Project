[Lyrical Obscurity: Equitant, Voices: Proscriptor, Bass: Equitant]

...With sword at my side,
The horns sound the call of assembly.
Black fuckin' leather is my way of life, as flames and burning winds cover the
Earth!
(SLAUGHTER!!)
Miles of frozen lands are far behind us...
We ride along the margin of the woods.

O' great is the black swords of Eire.
Thus to speak is the shame of your lord.
We ride through the bleak winter skies; hearts full of hate and steel shining
bright!
Alas, it's ill, to walk in my shadow...
O' master of doom, you are alone.

In chariots of fire we went forth,
To call the spell of blazing flames.
My black sword of Eire has returned.
In glory, of the land, of the flame.
Child of wisdom and words...
Son of magick and the sword.

Call the spells of burning winds!!

[Chorus]

SWORDS AND LEATHER - ...with steel, flame, and honor!!
SWORDS AND LEATHER - ...our brave hearts will conquer!!
SWORDS AND LEATHER - ...with steel, flame, and honor!!
SWORDS AND LEATHER - ...our Celtic blood will conquer!!

[Repeat All Verses &amp; Chorus]

[Lead: Ifernain]
[Lead: Shaftiel]

...With sword at my side,
The horns sound the call of assembly.
Black fuckin' leather is our way of life, as flames and burning winds cover
the Earth! (SLAUGHTER!!!!)
