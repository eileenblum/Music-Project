[Lyrical Magick: Proscriptor, Voice: Proscriptor Bass: Equitant]

[1st Verse]

He gave me the noble, enduring crown.
He gave me the high throne of kingship.
He gave me the imperial, regal sceptre.
He gave me the laws of the realm.

He gave me the facts of the Kurgarra.
He gave me descend in this undersphere.
He gave me the dagger; he gave me the sword.
He gave me the staff and unphallic wand.

He gave me concern.
He gave me dismay.
He gave me consternation.

He gave me the art of this song.
He gave me procreation.

[Pre-Chorus]

Dumuzi!

[Chorus]

A magician's lapis-lazuli gleams in Urik, descending to my undersphere.
A magician's lapis-lazuli reflects onto the Temples of Offal.
A magician's lapis-lazuli excels in Ur, descending to their underworld.
...is placed on Shugurra, the crown of the Steppe.

[Repeat 1st Verse]

[2nd Verse]

He gave me the craft of the spell; he gave me determination.
He gave me the craft of a charm; he gave me an invocation.

He gave me wine of Geshtinanna; he gave me determination.
He gave me oracles of the lil; he gave me half a year.

He gave me a sail on an Anzu-Bird; he gave me notes of thunder.
He gave me the feathers from it's wing; he gave me regalement.

He gave me a mark of the fiend; he gave me roots from the Huluppu-Tree;
He gave me travel of the Apzu; he gave me the Lapis-Lazuli.

A MAGICIAN'S LAPIS-LAZULI!
