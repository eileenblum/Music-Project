[1st Verse]

A barbaric land where the sword is the law, and killing is the way of life.
An infernal wasteland and down a barren plain; A warrior stands the test of
fate.
His face is cracked from the wicked hands of time, and scars from war have
past,
Taking the reins from a shadowy steed, I shall kill the foyus at it's layer!

[Chorus x 2]

MORBID SCREAM!

[2nd Verse]

Skulls and bones lie relics in the sand; Remembrance of men that came before.
The ground is scorched from the dragon's breath, and corpses burned to stench
and ash.
I awake in fury when the dragon attacks; Advancing in anger - spitting fire.
Our barbarous laws, my thundering axe, yet we'll fight the beast to it's death!

[Repeat Chorus x 2]
