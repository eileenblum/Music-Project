"He who lives alone, longs only for mercy, the mercy of falling on his side.
The brave have perished in laurel-crowned glory, yet the brave shall carry
the name of Eire into eternity."

"Eternity is like a flame, it's essence is so limitless."

"Eternity is a deathless pith covering the Southern and burning shores of his
paradise, the Tir Na N'og. When legends of steel were strong, it was louder
than any uproar of thunder."

"...of Celtic fire, he was born. He will live on... F O R E V E R."
