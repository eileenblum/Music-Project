[Lyrical Magick: Proscriptor, Musick: Shaftiel &amp; Equitant]

Never Blow Out The Eastern Candle
Your five-fold kiss was rather invoking;
Beside the chancel is your unphallic wand,
And use it wisely in order to fly.

MOONFIRE!
ALLAXITOS!

My jewel is the lust from your kiss;
Your breasts made me the lover of the three-fold locus,
So take thy hand and join me for elixir,
And we shall ride the portentous serpent tonight.

Your five fold tongue has defiled me,
I'm stranded by the tree of Storax
Thus, we banish your unphallic wand,
In order to make our nexus ecstasy

MOONFIRE!
CUM TO ME.
ALLAXITOS!
CUM WITH THEE.

NEVER BLOW OUT THE EASTERN CANDLE!
NEVER BLOW OUT THE EASTERN CANDLE!
NEVER BLOW OUT THE EASTERN CANDLE!

FOREVER

"The liturgies of Absu, as we have unfolded them and perceived them for you,
remain so arcane and remote that temporal beings can hardly enter them
imaginatively, as one dares to enter magic(k) and mythology as mystifying as
the "In the Eyes of Ioldanach" minicd. yet, in exploring the outlying
prospects opened by lines and musick as those of the Absu... corcerning
ourselves... one is quickened to partecipate in the impassioned experience of
a collective aspiration: vast, cumulative, and ancient"
[Sir Proscriptor McGovern]
