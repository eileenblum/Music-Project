[Lyrical Magick: Proscriptor, Musick: Shaftiel]

They stare towards the heart
They stare at the stone
He'll upend the plate of angles;
She'll upend the plate of angles
V dashes of Mercury
And Asarus Alchemy
Will channel V archangels... V archangels

[Chorus I:]
"In the Sun we remember;
In the planets we forget
We've come unto a hall and Asaru is who we've met"

Huluppu roots are forked
Like veins in a canny hand;
Their leaves have scuttled
In spiraled force
A VI fold nova,
Fleurs de lys...
V cards are placed in the hand of the course.

[Chorus II:]
"O' Abyssia we recall;
In spiraled force, they will fall
Man, staff and the silver gilt key shall take us to
V.I.T.R.I.O.L."

[Mandate of Pandemonium (Solos: Shaftiel):]
"Dreamer!" : "Redeemer!"
"Dreamer!" : "Redeemer!"
"Dreamer!" : "Redeemer!"
"The Abyss!" : "V.I.T.R.I.O.L.!"

[Repeat Mandate of Pandemonium]

Their Universe...
It's constantly changing,
And every change in force
It's constantly dying.
Svaddistthana:
Sakkya-ditti
Rearrange V cards, yet are they lying?

[Repeat Chorus I]

Closing verdant curtains
Closure is the apex;
One curve is the asp,
But the snake is a path in light
These twins are emerging,
Geminis still verging,
Yet Atu still carries the knife.

[Repeat Chorus II]
