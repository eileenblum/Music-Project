The old woman of Nippur
Instructs Ninlil to walk the banks of Idnunbirdu
She thrusts he magic (k)
To harvest the mind of the great
mountain-lord Enlil

The bright-eyed king will fall to your anguish
His soul lures the hexagonal room
He who decrees fates - his spirit is caught
His soul lured to the hexagonal room

Nunbarshegunu
A silk veil strewn over you
Your face is the cosmos
You hide it in shame

The lord of fates enthralled
He's bound to Ninlil

The lord of fates enthralled
He's bound to Ninlil
Your daughter, your weapon
You want to be the cosmos!

No shame, no limits
Mother of Ninlil acts
Lord of the fates deluded
To Kurnugi, Enlil is cast
Sin is conceived in the monarchy of death
The dynasty persists: the lunar god comes
to life!

Nunbarshegunu
A silk veil strewn over you
Your face is the cosmos
You hide it in shame
