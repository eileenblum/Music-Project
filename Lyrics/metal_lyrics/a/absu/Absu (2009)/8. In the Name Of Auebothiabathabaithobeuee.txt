In the name
I give the powers to the spell
In the name
True visions of time are forthcoming
In the name
I confer brawn to incantations
In the name
Gray vapors begin to clamber high

The great scimitar of Barzai
Alabaster statuette of Yebsu
The representation of Koth
Cobalt flames light the blaze of Laurel

In the day
Mars and Saturn make collision
In the day
Place the ewer upon the fire
In the day
All the secrets are deaf in silence
In the day
I am the Lord of every Spectre

In the light
Grant equal parts of rune and weapon
In the light
Place the green glass onto the seal
In the light
Four winds cry the words of control
In the light
Seven nights will unchain the soul

In the name
I give uproar to the Great Abyss
In the name
I give the powers to the spell
In the name
Of the unction inside the sigil
In the name
Vaporous smoke shall arise
