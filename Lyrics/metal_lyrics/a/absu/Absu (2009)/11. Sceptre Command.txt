Namtar, you're the Hyle of plague-ness
A watchman: bound and bound
My staff is the answer (for elucidation)

We shall not climb to the origin of elements
We must examine the base of Gudua

In order to harvest a benthos existence
I call upon the backing of Gugalanna

I paint the bow at the gold crown
Three arrows spear the heart of the staff
The placement of Mars must be equal
Enrapture within Sceptre Command!

The Cylinder seal projects the spell of triangular silhouettes of Irra
Hear me, Namtar

Descending by the stages
Gugalanna

Circules of this great dwelling
Gugalanna
O' breathing, flowing orb - you're in place
O' formless, lifeless mock - your gray place

The Cylinder seal projects the spell of
triangular silhouettes of Irra
Hear me, Namtar

Descending by the stages
Gugalanna

Circules of this great dwelling
Gugalanna
O' breathing, flowing orb - you're in place
O' formless, lifeless mock - your gray place

THOSE ABOVE...
THOSE BELOW...
FIRST ORDER!

I paint the bow at the gold crown
Three arrows spear the heart of the staff
The placement of Mars must be equal
Enrapture within Sceptre Command!

The Cylinder seal projects the spell of triangular silhouettes of Irra
Hear me, Namtar

Descending by the stages
Gugalanna

Circules of this great dwelling
Gugalanna
O' breathing, flowing orb - you're in place
O' formless, lifeless mock - your gray place

Thank you, O' Great Ones
Now, Kuta's repressed
My solar cantrip...
My fourteen afreets...
Anon, Gudua's placed

[Narrator:]
Three embraced each other
Namtar, Nergal and Mars
The truncheon gripped the light
Command - the bolts were shot
