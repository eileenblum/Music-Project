Within upheaval
I am filed between them
A dark cloud: evident
Apparent: parasite-hoards

Contained by ancient tongues
Aghast in aspect
On momentous days
I teach validities
Of the sea and the secrets
The crux: "The Primeval Source"
In the planes of the shining lodes
Za-ab: return to the source

Elemental!

Flanked by the sixth and seventh
The spheres which make the signs
Vual and Scor
I'm Zagan of 13 Globes

Flanked by the sixth and seventh
The spheres which make the signs

You shall ascend: Durson
MA.GUR.NU.AB.ZU
Aid me minder: Durson

33 legions bow before me now
