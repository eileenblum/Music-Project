This is for you
Temple in the earth
A beacon of fire
A shrine for Eridu

The moon's bright trace
A pathway to your vault
Your spell is close
Its light holds a face

The Sun still sleeps
While the ancient ones return

Here stands the mighty chantry
Inlaid with black-blue lapis
You're seized by the Ushum-Gal
Enclosed in Girra's Temple
Sirrush is flying over
Storming over Neti's gates
Ea awaits your arrival
Inside...

The seeds have been planted
A long, long time ago
Early, utopian visions
You can only fantasize
One abyss: one temple
One mind: one design
In course of the setting Sun
You can only realize

Bashmu!
Sirrush! Ea!
Narr Marratu!

Narr Marratu!
Ea! Kingu!
Lakhmu!
Lakhamu!
Lakhmu!
Lakhamu!

Here stands the mighty chantry
Inlaid with black-blue lapis
You're seized by the Ushum-Gal
Enclosed in Girra's Temple
Sirrush is flying over
Storming over Neti's gates
Ea awaits your arrival
Inside...
