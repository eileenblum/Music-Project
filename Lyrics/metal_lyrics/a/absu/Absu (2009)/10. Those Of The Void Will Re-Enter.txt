Thousand after thousand
The years of tradition linger
For the wisdom of magic(k)
The supra catalyst swells
Servants of the arcane order
The hypnotized beings
Can you commemorate?
The burden of ignorance

Clad in robes imprinted with spells
Regress time - degenerate
Founders of mankind,
Come lay your claim
Revert - Annunaki
Those of the void will re-enter
Clad in robes imprinted with spells
Regress time - degenerate
Founders of mankind...
Regress time - Regress time
Those of the void have re-entered!
