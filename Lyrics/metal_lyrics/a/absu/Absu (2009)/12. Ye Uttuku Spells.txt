ANNIHILATE - the seeds of real
ABANDON - the standard dimension feel
ASSIMILATE - the logic of chaos
ABSU - Balance the serpent

At nightfall, burgundy eyes arise
Beginning of the cosmic dances
Surrealistic, the serpent's command
Ugallu, obey the magus' rule

ANNIHILATE - the seeds of real
ABANDON - the standard dimension feel
ASSIMILATE - the logic of chaos
ABSU - Balance the serpent

A frenzied rupture opens the stone
Out pours the beam and the shaft of light
Point it straight to the mountain's zenith
Ye Utukku awake, Utukku

ANNIHILATE - the seeds of real
ABANDON - the standard dimension feel
ASSIMILATE - the logic of chaos
ABSU - Balance the serpent

Unrestrained, the light razes the night
Savage, causer of the mystical
Bring the Ginyaatlie of lava
Achieve theory from the mythical

Nisir - Tedloonetaa of salvation
Nisir - Mountain of elevation
Kukhwa - Burn over the dome
Ye Utukku awake, ye Absu rage

ANNIHILATE - the seeds of real
ABANDON - the standard dimension feel
ASSIMILATE - the logic of chaos
ABSU - Balance the serpent

ANNIHILATE - the seeds of real
ABANDON - the standard dimension feel
ASSIMILATE - the logic of chaos
ABSU - Balance the serpent
