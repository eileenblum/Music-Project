Many became the victim of the hunt
and attack
Inside the Order was a ruse for the fall
A greater key was used to open the portals
Afterwards, mages were allocated
underneath

He practiced his knacks and skills of trickery
Most malicious, he became revolting
Spirits were locked inside the mirrored vestibule
The Circle was ambushed by cornered, lined frontiers
Grabbing a staff, he waited for the practical
Dressed in the robe, he adjured the Circle
(Faultless seal, a greater key, ascendancy)

"O' Amy, you're the foremost of sphere and space"
"O' Amy, you're the foremost of fortune and splendour"

He saw and aloof principle as one being
Most sharp-eyed, he watched day transfigure
to the night (from the fire, combustion)

The mages self-sustained the beckon (summoning)
Studying bleak matter tied to obscured strings
A morph-genetic field of imps disturbed then
And the lesson was a ruse for the fall (combustion, ascendancy)
