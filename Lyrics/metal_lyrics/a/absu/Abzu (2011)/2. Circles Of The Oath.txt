[1st verse:]
I stand in the center of the summit sphere
I wait for the sound of the clouted bell â the warning sign

This vagueness has not been named,
Yet I see hands which testify the vow
Exposing the uncalled, unknown and unsettled

My destinies marked!

[Chorus:]
I confirm vigor of the Wise by stealth
With this spell, non-foul, creating combustion
I form the glow
Of the Oath, circles are blood and birth renewed
How keen the free star prevails â a strike of thrust
I forever reach

I seek doubled chains of Orgiaâs durableness!

[Chorus]

Iâm told by the garlanded that Atu and Tipharethâ¦
Iâm told by the conquering they remain introducing:

The mentors of the Above
The forgers that speak Below
The savants of the Numbers
The solders of the Circuits

[Decree]
Iâm
Aeons tenable
Mark my words
Of the oath
Seven
Iâm
Treasures to the stone
Hear my lead
In the oath
Seven

[Repeat decree]
[Repeat 1st verse]
