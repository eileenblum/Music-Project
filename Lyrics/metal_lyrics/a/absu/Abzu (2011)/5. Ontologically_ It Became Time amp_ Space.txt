Yawning benthos came first, terra firma, next Desire
Erebus of old Night, Day of Aethyr
Neither of these were Being, reality, nor Non-being
Perdurability, neither of death

[Chorus:]
The Wanderers of the Waste infested plateaus:
Time and Space
Then, Sirius prearranged calendars of lone
Continuum

Astral sketch was not self-incandescent
Its light was produced by rays of the Sun
Eyeless void felt generations of heat
The first seed of Mind â The Light of the South
Breath by itself
Without wind, pyramidsâ¦
Concentrated
Cyclic flux, trianglesâ¦
Air nor Earth nor were protected as of yet.
The water was not deep, yet unfathomable
Nonentity occurred

Darkness swathed in darkness: unmanifestation

[Decree:]
Chaos never dies
Sothis hides beyond the aeon
Locked forever
Unfaltering

The Sun behind the Sun spawns twin aspects of tide

Up, down was beginning to frame itself
Casters of the second seed gained control (of the Deep)
Energy was beneath - impulse above.

[Chorus]
