[a. E-A]

I sought after gold, but I found it not
My rules are found by the Conclave of Ur
I am the coxswain, as I shall valiantly face the dangers
With my chariot, I am declared!

[Chorus x2:]
I discover its foundations require cavernous mining in the primal basis
Enlil exhumes my unearthing and makes a sudden decision after Anu arrives

[Chorus II x2:]
Shar shadi il enlil ana kakkab shu gi ikabbi

[b. A Myriad of Portals]

You are falling into the squalls
Spirit fills itself with the tint of the teaching
Messengers of Namtar drink from your toxic well
And sink in the flood of black miasma - drunkenness

[Chorus:]
You are neither male nor female
Donât break the pledge of the zephyr
The broad corrals, high enclosuresâ¦
A myriad of portals
Evil it is: Nanna is nigh
Tear the wives from embrace of man
Snatch the child from knees of mothers
Opening the flaps of time

[Bridge:]
Seven, you are in midst of the deep
MA.GUR.UR.NU.AB.ZU

Silence is the slaughter and the seal is the crown
On sacramental grounds, feign as creatures of the Light

[Chorus]
[Bridge]

And the body of the night turned out in daylight to be yours
Order and kindness donât exist like a wing without a bird
And the body of the night turned out in daylight to be yours
Order and kindness donât exist like a tongue without a mouthâ¦
A myriad of portals

[c. Third Tablet]

[1st verse]
At last, my slog is Home to the Tides
Tablet of Fate obtained
As once, my trek is deftly guided
Blue-hued Antu: our way

The Water Thruster
The Testerâs Sunbeam
The Giant Kishar

Tablet of Fate attained

The Hammered Bracelet
Deleted Weapons
A Lucid Pathway

To all who assemble,
My words of command are in the hands of Bane
To all who assemble,
My words of command are in the hands of Bane

[Repeat 1st verse]

[d. Warren Of Imhullu]

Now that I have your face by heart,
I look more at your features being the First
You are the perturbing tempest and the worst of all
Inrush!

[Chorus:]
Gathering speed as it blows
- Oâ Imhullu
To the Abzu, you will follow
Scowl of Waters

Now that I have your voice by heart,
I glance more at your features being the Fourth
You are the distressing Shibbu and the worst of all
Indraft!

[Chorus]

Now that I have your heart by heartâ¦
