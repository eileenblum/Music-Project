East
Invoking: the breaking forth of the light
Instruments: forms of the coarse flames

Aeons of a bornless beyond:
Listen to the voice of Angle!
Devotion
Ever-burning lamps

West
Traveling: the Radix of vibration
Projections: in gale of the Ninth

Stirs of the invisible
Feel four-hundred fifty six winds!
Metatron
The wisdom of the breath

North
Emerging: advent of the visible
Conjectures: adventures into the chasm

Limpid with the brilliance below
Drenched and sodden: inundating
Quadrangle
An excess: abundance

Servants of thunder, they all deliver
Pulling together, all subquadrants fail

South (Dominated)
The speech in silence sounds the Third Angle
Drawn into naught, the points are now quashed

Hath passed and pure gold, the Lion of the Light appears before the faces of Aethyrs

[Chorus:]
Folk of fear will drive
Astral planes toward the fade of age
Time is thronged by time
Skrying in the spirit vision

[Decree:]
Oodiorg
He of fire and justice
Doanzin
He who names the waters
Gahtza
Hoath

[Chorus]
