Sea of uruk
I taste the salt of you
I hunt through sands of Roba El Khaliyeh

Dumuzi Apzu
Your allure is so very pure
Zi Dingir Anna Kanpa
You shall drown the fearless ones

The sword of Lapis Lazuli Diadem
Your fullness and strength is my delight

Edin Na Zu, Edin Na Zu

The stars have spoken to me
They've told me the tale of your past
Battles were clashed by you
Long before the cosmos existed
O' mountains of Mashu
Please help me to find the grey stone
I lost it, yet it's symbol unequals your race

I am in search of the Northern Nineveh; it's beyond the hills of Zagros

I thrust my sword onto the veil, and then, in the Earth
Reversed lightning strikes Sumerian sands
They glance at me with eyes of Sunkun Varloorni
Their eyes flare red with glowing embers
Follow the path of gold and ye shall find the symbols: Arra, Agga, and Bandar
In my sleeping village of Bet Durrabia, Shabatu forces the nineteenth hour

Ye go to thy Apzu; the unsightly abyss of Enidu
Ye go to thy Apzu; the impious axis of Enidu

I have traveled beneth the seas in search of our master's palace
I have finally found the grey stone of the immemorial ones

I have raised my armies in the lands of the eastern, summoning hordes
I have seen Ngga, God of Heathens, as my sword Diadem gleams

The cosmos shall be greeted from the blood of thez serpent
A serpent well known as Tehom Mummu Tiamat
Man shall be greeted from the blood of Kingu
Thy queen of mashu will haunt the vision of your breed

O' my queen, I feel your skin of white, I touch your breasts of life, yet
there's a battle I must fight

Zagros, Avagon, Ngga, Shabatu

Thy skin of white misses you
Please don't leave me ever, nevermore
Unless you go, please take me with you
We'll ride onto wings of Anzu

I heard the bellow of wolves behind the half-burnt waves
The tides of uruk swept your tongue across the salty floor

We have found the Apzu; our birthplace toward Avagon
We have found the Apzu; our meridian toward the dark

Munus Sigsigga
Ag Bara ye
Innin Aggish Xashxur
Gishnu urma

Apzu
