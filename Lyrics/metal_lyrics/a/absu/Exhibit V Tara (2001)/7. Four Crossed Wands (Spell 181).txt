[Chorus I:]
I'm the Knight of Wands-
Yodh is in the name
I'm swift and violent:
TRANSIENT!
The fiery part of Fire-
I'm a lightning flash
Between the symbol,
And the natal force.

[Chorus II:]
She's the Queen of Wands-
HÃ© is in the name
She's fermenting, yet
TRANSMITTING!
The watery part of Fire-
She's quick to receive
Between the surface,
And the process of (pro) creation.

Kan! King!
51st Hexagram
A warrior in complete armor
With wand in the left hand and torch in the right. (181)

SuÃ­! Queen!
17th Hexagram
Her crown is topped with a winged sphere,
And rayed with flames. (181)

[Chorus III:]
He's the Prince of Wands-
Vau is in the name
He's manifesting, but
TRANSCENDING!
The airy part of Fire-
He's the "Dying God!"
Between the virtue,
And the Leader of his caste.

YÃ® King! YÃ® King!
42nd Hexagram
A shrouded warrior in full-scale armour-
On his chest, he bears the sigil "TO MEGA QHRION."

[Chorus IA:]
FOUR CROSSED WANDS!

Ã Queen! Ã Queen!
27th Hexagram
Her crown is surged with a disque of the Sun
And once again, rayed with fire.

[Repeat Chorus IA]

"They observe no regular rule in the ordering of their hearts."

[Repeat Chorus IA]

[Chorus IV:]
She's the Princess of Wands-
HÃ© is in the name
She's crystallizing, yet
TRANSPOSING!
The earthy part of Fire-
She's absorbing
Between the Silence,
And the 10th of May.
