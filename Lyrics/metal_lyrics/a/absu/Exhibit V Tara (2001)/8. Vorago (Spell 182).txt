I am not limited to this Underworld.
I am settled in this Barrenness.
I am kept in this Emptiness.
I am not restricted to this Underworld. (182)

I travel Earth in the train of You.
I offer Earth to reach the field of You.
I walk Earth to see the mark of You.
I proffer Earth to feel the lure of You. (182) (FOREKNOWLEDGE)

Hail to you, prime mover of the Deep.
Sun of the heart: possessor of Voids.
The awe of whom created This.
The thirst of this revered Abyss. (182) (ADAEOT)

[Pre-Chorus:]
BEINGS, BY-COMINGS, THOUGHTS...
MONADS, ATOMS, WAVES...
APERTURES, GULFS, CHASMS...
RESULTS AMONGST RESULTS!

[Chorus:]
I have made, for myself, a space within Time.
I mutely descend to the cavity of my Cell.
I am the furtive seeker ensnared Underneath.
Vorago!

[Chorus II:]
My gray wand is your Bout.
Your grandeur is my Time.
My sunray si your Beam.
Your splendor is my Turn.
My circlet is your Crown.
Your allure is my Shape.
My pattern is your Kind.
Your extent is my Scope.

My seat is your Center.
Your merit is my Dint.
My throne is your Rule.
Your misdeed is my Sin.
My void is your Stone.
Your retort is my Key.
My stone is Yourself.
Your result is my Fate.

[Post-Chorus:]
VORAGO! [x4]

[Repeat Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus II:]
SEEING THROUGH ILLUSIONS!
NAUGHT = MANY = TWO!
SEEING THROUGH ILLUSIONS!
ONE = ALL = EIGHT!

[Repeat Chorus II]

"O' you abyssic essence who is before me and who follows after my heart,
usher me in at your usherings,
for you are the one who guides me,
who escorts my anima under the Earth,
as I am a soul who is stark in Vorago."
