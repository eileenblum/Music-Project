[Cairn Warrior's Appetency of Invultuation:]
I am the one to seek the courtly witch -
She is the one to find me.
I am the one to yearn the dazzling bitch -
She is the one to bind me.
So I say, the spell has begun!

[Tea (Courtly Witch):]
"The darkness is starting and control is done..."

[Cairn Warrior:]
Stones of power inside this sphere
are stark stones of magick -
I am joining the mystic ring,
with this woman, as we implore.
We do implore.
I am aiding the mystic writ;
I am gifted knowledge from deep wells!

[Chorus - Cairn Warrior's First Myaltic Rite:]
Candle of fire, candle of might,
Create my desires here on this night -
This candles stream is suddenly flaming higher!

Bring to me my heart's desire,
My words of strength are suddenly hung,
So I proudly state this spell has begun!

[Cairn Warrior:]
Stones of power within ire
are strong stones of cabal.
I am joined int he magick round,
with this bitch, as we implore.
We shall explore.
With Paralda by my side,
I am granted sylphs and zephyrs!

[Cairn Warrior's Second Myaltic Rite:]
Show me the rings of your cosmic fire,
Make my pathway carved and clear.
Give me a code that's no will of mine,
To show me your presence is here!

[Repeat Cairn Warrior's Second Myaltic Rite]

[Chorus II - Cairn Warrior's Last Myaltic Rite:]
Courtly witch of the beast -
Courtly bitch of the daring arm,
I am your tyro, yet never alarmed!

A dash of thistle, and in my dreams -
Give me the silver-gilt key,
That will unlock the spell...
Courtly witch, assist me!
