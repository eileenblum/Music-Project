[Cairn Warrior in Advocated Manner:]
Stones of power
Stillness of her spawn
Gems of symbols
Re-illuminating
Dawn
She cries the quiet lake

Weeping waters
Taciturnity
Found
She cries the quiet lake

Dripping ruptures
Immortality
Bound

Enduring: death is mine to keep
Timelessness: unborn in timely shape
Balancing: between stone and sky
Promulgate: lamentations

Continually: she wails and she whines
Nonetheless: linking stone to sky
Leveling: the tarns to the tides
Circulate: limpid-forming tears

[Tea's Diktat:]
"The darkness is starting and control is done:
The cosmic light is fading, as the shadow's won."

[Chorus - Cairn Warrior in Encouraged Mode:]
It's the lake of your liquid, glass heart
It's bringing your writ; it's bringing you tears
It's filling your thirst and never with fears
It's the tears of my liquid, glass heart

[Repeat Chorus - Cairn Warrior in Encouraged Mode]
