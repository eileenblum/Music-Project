[l:Thrall/Salles m:Salles/Thrall]

And I'm still living that moment...
I hear in the symphony of winds,
The whispering of her voice
Echoing beautifully in my thoughts;
The supreme melody of enchantment
Embracing me in pure ecstasy.

I'm living in my fantasy
Bringing my winter with graciousness
Guiding myself unto cloudy skies
She casts the lies in my head.

Drinking my wine with relish
She's using all her malice
She holds my hands in glee
Leaving me in misery

Immortal beauty, endless cruelty
Am I worthy of her passion?
Or even to touch her body when the night falls?

Freeze with the ocean of heartless emotions
Deal with the fact that she's not there
Grasp for an answer to all simple chapters
Read with the insight of unsecurity

Fate becomes desolated
Observing all the suffering
That she brought me

I'll embrace her soul
Not like before
I'll be coming with my blackened heart.

Into the emptiness of darkness
A great lament has been heard,
Flesh and soul were united
In the scars of a cursed past
Through never-ending fevered nightmares
My tears shall bring grave sickness to mankind
