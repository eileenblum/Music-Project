[l/m:Salles]

I've lost all of my hope
You can't say that I haven't tried
I still feel your love
This must be all, all that I've got

I've learnt so much with you
I know how I'm gonna take it
Please don't leave me now
Hear me, stay a little longer

This can't be true
Fuck! I love you...

After dark you're close to me
You are an angel as I can see
Another day by your side
Is enough for me to die in peace

I live in sadness
You are the dark

I live in sadness
You are my darkness
I see you before I die

Try this sadness
See what happens
Dark yet senseless
You are reckless
Face my madness
My life shatters
When you stab my heart
