[l:Thrall m:Gama]

When tears dry
I finally have a sign
That my love for you
Is just a dreamkind

When tears dry
I loose my mind
And memories fall asleep in a dream

And I feel emptiness once again
With deep pain inside

A wicked mind behind her eyes
Her beauty is beyond heaven and hell
And her voice gave me a dark will

Whispering in silence, dancing with desire
You make me feel forever
But it's really killing me

Blood shed from my heart
Like a decorative colour
In your sick gallery of emotions
And I'll say farewell
I'll say farewell
