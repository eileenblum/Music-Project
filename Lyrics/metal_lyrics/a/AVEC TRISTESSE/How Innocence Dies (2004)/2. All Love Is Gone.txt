[l:Salles/Thrall m:Salles]

Late at night I close my eyes
Alas! The lighten candle dies
I feel the presence of the dark
I strive my thoughts away from you

Flowing like a river of feelings
My conscience so pale
And all the love that's gone 
Brings me tragic nightmares

"You walk in beauty like the night
Of cloudless climes and starry skies,
And all that's best of dark and bright
Meet in your aspect and your eyes.

One shade the more, one ray the less,
Had half impair'd the nameless grace
Which waves in every raven tress,
Or softly lightens o'er her face;
Where thoughts serenely sweet express 
How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

And on that cheek, and o'er that brow, 
So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
But tell of days in goodness spent, 
A mind at peace with all below,
A heart whose love is innocent!"

Take from me my emptiness
I've never felt (true) love in my life;
A bitter life that no one ever cared

The taste of wine lingers in my mind
The wine that spilled right out from your wounds 
Into my mouth and shattering my life
I thank you so my beloved ones
