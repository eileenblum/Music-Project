Had to wake up
My stomach was drilled
But nothing just seemed to make sense
The blood in my nose
The marks on my skin
My head was an absolute mess
My wallet was empty
And so were my pockets
I couldn't even start to remember
As a note on the doorstep
Caught my attention
"Sold you!" and a telephone number

This isn't right
Not in my mind
What is all this?
I must be blind

Right after dialing up
A sweet voice answered the phone
"I'm yours if you'll be mine
Last night you were pretty wild"

She hanged up
My head was thrilled
But nothing still seemed to make sense
The marks on my nose
The blood on my skin
My wallet was an absolute mess
My head was empty
And so was my doorstep
I couldn't even get my attention
The telephone on the doorstep
Caught my number
"Wake up!" and please my intentions

I cannot understand
Why these are not my hands
The ground's up to my knees
And on my bed someone's asleep
I lean forward to grab his arm
And pull his body towards me
But it cannot be true
It's me who's fast asleep

This was my little story
About the reckless horror
Of dreams transformed from glory
Into dark treacherous terror
So pay attention to me
It's for your own sake
Make good use of yourself
And turn away from what's fake
