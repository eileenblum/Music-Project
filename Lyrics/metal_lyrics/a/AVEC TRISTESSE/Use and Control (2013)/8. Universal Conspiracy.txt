So bright that I can't see
A power that I can feel
Radioactive as the sun
Our hopes die one by one

In this universe youâre part of a whole
A system completing its balance as a goal
If you lack the slightest conscience of it all
Youâll be swallowed by the alienation of the world

See all from high above
But donât mistake yourself
After all, youâre still alone
Sensibility is wisdom

Everyone is lost in the mind's collision
The chaos that rules in all ways
They come; they wish to die
Hey you! Let's fight side by side

Down here nothing shows the truth
In a higher plan, you see all energy around you
Running everywhere, and changing
Running everywhere...
Changing.

The real will to change is inside us
Changes that appear when weâre unconscious
But donât lose the chance to define them
Before time (and you know why) runs all up again

We will return to the fucked world eventually
Even if we are swallowed by the conspiracy
To make changes to change
