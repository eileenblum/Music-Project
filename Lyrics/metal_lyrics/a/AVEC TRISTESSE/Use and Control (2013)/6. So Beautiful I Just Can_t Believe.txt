It is time to awake and you seem so insecure
But behold, it is me,
There's no problem to endure.
And you smile fitfully as the sunlight fills your eyes
Could it stop suddenly to preserve this unique moment that is pure beauty?

I learned that hoping to be free of pain from the past
Is just one thing you can't believe, so put it to rest
Although my life was hell back then, I wished to be free
Now all that's left for me to sigh lays in memory

We lift ourselves above all shame
When all seems to be so perfect,
You smile yet again

We hold hands to believe that it's not imagination
Even your crystal tear falls like beauty's perfection
Oh, the smell of your hair it will make me feel much better
In the dark of your eyes we'll be swimming together
I will rest my hands on your skin so smooth and tender
On your ruby swollen lips, I will kiss you forever
