Soon I'll be so far from here
I'll take the path of destiny
Might I find someone for me
If hope must die then I shall leave this world

I am so afraid of life
I just don't have the strength to fight
Help won't come and
I will be losing grip of sanity

I'm so alone
The light is gone
And in my eyes
No one is right

Since I have thus become
Nothing but sad and dull
I run, I fall
I've lost it all
No one is here
No one at all

So see, I am not the type of guy who leaves
When all are staring back away from me
There might just be a reason for all this
Behavior that I'm starting to conceive

As my fear transforms to wonder
Onto the psychology of human kind
And I marvel just how sad it is
The self-pity of a selfish mind

Someone save me from myself

Try asking a simple question
To someone as bleak as I am
I am free
