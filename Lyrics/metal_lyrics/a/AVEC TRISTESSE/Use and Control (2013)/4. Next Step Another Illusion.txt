In this alienated world it's fucking hard to live
You don't know who's in or out, nor where you've to fit in
And when you think on who is out, it makes sense suddenly
Just after false conclusions it gets pretty clear to see:

You've betrayed yourself

This is my way
A restricted world formed around me
This is our way
What binds us all in total despair

To leave this process is practically impossible
The hardest battle of all time is the one you fight against yourself
It endures for a whole lifetime and there is no time left to die

Because running, oh, that would be very easy
But today I realize what really matters
Is accepting the fact that I'm part off all this
What once again binds me to you!

I can't take this "love" no more
Where people feel pity for me

And merely for a lapse I could forget it all
Create realities but I'm tired of this power so false

Hate, madness, deception, sadness
Are not enough to delude me any more
The real responsible has now just come forth

Always so close and coward
From now on you can really grow
I despise this false love
People feel for me you know
