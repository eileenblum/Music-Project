I just can't be honest with myself.
I try to hide all my feelings.
For one lonely minute I awake my senses
And feel so much fright of myself.
I punish myself for everything
But nothing has really happened

I see you in your path
And today I feel ashamed.
All that supported me fell
As well as my masquerade.

You needn't to understand me
Neither do you need to have me.
All emotions swept away from myself
As long as I run from you
I'll be running from myself.

I can speak to you
But I can't hear your voice.
I can see you in my screen
Giving you scent and taste
I choose your colour
And lose myself in simple facts
That only you can understand.

In this equation of feelings
I just want to feel and hug you.
Slowly I get lost
I turn myself to nothing.

Touch my face and
Feel my tears...
Don't worry about me
These are not my first tears
Nor will they be the last.
