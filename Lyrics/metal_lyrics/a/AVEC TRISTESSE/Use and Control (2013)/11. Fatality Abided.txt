The loss leaves and pain remains
To go in pain, to come in pain.
I find the pain of solitude
Beneath my own wounds
Without matter, without shelter.

Beyond my voice you'll find the torment
And the glimmer of a moment.
The chimera will be broken and all hope will dry up.
The moment halts, frozen
And all reality has become nothing but one archaic instant.

A life that speckled in uncertainty
In your absence...It all became just memory

Fate - At your sight I find my fate
Trace - A sad canvas, yet lonely trace.
Lost - From a last lament
Hate - From a life sent to rest.

Inside the words I lose the meaning
Of a sensation that slowly bitterns.
This pain inside my chest brings longing,
But carries memories of moments still enduring.

I only store in recollection
The moment stanched,
The pain of absence,
The loss of one who leaves...
The life passes, you pass, I pass.

I can't live without a meaning
I can't go on while not knowing
I just can't get through with this
