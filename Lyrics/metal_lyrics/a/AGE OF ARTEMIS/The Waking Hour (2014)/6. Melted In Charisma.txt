All that you need to know is the lies they sell on the news
Crime and disorder showed, is it alright?
Even the man who shows his face
Melted in his charisma
"It's brand new day for us"

Change the world, don't let it changes you
You better watch out because we are no fools anymore!

Don't you think it's much more than entertaining
They keep laughing at our faces again

Change the world, don't let it changes you
You better watch out because we are not fools anymore
Go and run because we are here!

Stop! You don't deserve our blood, you had enough!
Run and hide because we all know where you'll be!

You better watch out because we are not fools anymore
Go and run because we are here!
