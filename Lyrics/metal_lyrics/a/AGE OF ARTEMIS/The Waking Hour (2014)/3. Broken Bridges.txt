Night falls, stars begin to show me
All the different ways I could. I'm not sure I should
Bridges built between the ages
Led me to believe I should. I know I could

See around their faces
I hear the voices asking me to please their needs

Every dawn is like a curse
Every dream seems like a nightmare in my soul
Every day we go across the same broken bridges
Before we reach the shore

Night falls, dark starts to master
Shadows I cannot defeat, I'm not sure I could
Bridges built between the ages
Led me to believe I would. I'm not sure I should

See around their faces
I hear the voices asking me: "Just let me in!"

Every dawn is like a curse
Every dream seems like a nightmare in my soul
Every day we go across the same broken bridges
Before we reach the shore
I just want to survive another day!!!

Actor fakes, the painter cut his own ear
Singers scream and shout their memories out!!!

See around their faces
I hear the voices, they are teasing me. "Just let me be!"

Every dawn is like a curse
Every dream seems like a nightmare in my soul
Every day we go across the same broken bridges
Before we reach the end
Before it gets too late please set me free!!!
