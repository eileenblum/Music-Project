Destiny brought death to me
Now the black bird comes to take my life
Suddenly I'm feeling so alone
Now the darkness embraces my soul
The coldness reached within my blood

The end is near
There is a shadow surrounding me
All the dreams I've lived
I have no reasons to regret
Even now the end seems like nothing
But one more step
To be free from all my sins
And all those bad things I have done

Sorry for those lines
I wrote (them) before that day
The promises I won't keep
Please forgive me
Because tomorrow I'll be gone
