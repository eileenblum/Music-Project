Another day looking for food that I could not find
There's nothing to hold on but desperate cry, promises from hypocrites
Thirsty again, starving I see something you can't hide
Waiting for answers I cannot control while politicians smile again

Under the Sun I can feel the pain burning inside my veins
What's my sin? There is no escape, no rain again
Under the sun looking to the sky, you don't seem to care about us
Have you abandoned us today?
Under the sun...

Another day dying like soldiers. Is this a war?
Living like animals. We want more!
I can barely walk. I'm starting to collapse, there's nothing for me!

Under the sun I can feel the pain burning inside my veins
What's my sin? There is no escape, no rain again
Under the sun looking to the sky, you don't seem to care about us
Have you abandoned us?

One more day, mothers and babies will die today
Death is a blessing in this world full of pain
My eyes are dried, there is no more tears
Silence is all I hear!

Under the sun I can feel the pain burning inside my veins
What's my sin? There is no escape, no rain again
Under the sun looking to the sky, you don't seem to care about us
Have you abandoned us again? Are we insane to die in vain?
