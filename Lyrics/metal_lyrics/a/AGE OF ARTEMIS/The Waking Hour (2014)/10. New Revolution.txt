Fear and confusion led to panic once again
The government collapsed, there are no more rules
We're walking blind in shadows all alone
We're refugees in our own home

We're ready to stand up and fight our enemies
We're not afraid of what may come today

Revolution calls screaming to the heard
No glory come from defeat

Revolution is in your mind
New solutions in your heart
Revolution starts with you
A new revolution!

The cowards shoot to kill and they don't give a damn
You will remember them when they all die

Revolution calls screaming to the heard
No glory come from defeat

Revolution is in your mind
New solutions in your heart
Revolution starts with you
It starts when you decide
A new revolution!
