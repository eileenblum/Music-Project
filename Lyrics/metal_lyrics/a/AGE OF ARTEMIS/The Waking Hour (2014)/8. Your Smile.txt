My eyes reflect my smile
But hearing you crying wakes my deepest fears
There's a new path, a one way down this road

The joy of holding you
Lifts me away from the sorrow of this world

And your presence brings such grace to this world
And in your presence I feel peace

Now you hold all the keys to build a brand new world
Nothing seems real, nothing's concealed
Just by the way you smile

When you fall my world falls apart
Every step that you take makes me proud
All the dreams that you dare to dream I make them my own

And your presence brings such grace to this world
And in your presence I feel peace

Now you hold all the keys to build a brand new world
Nothing seems real, nothing's concealed
Just by the way you smile

Show me your smile...
I'll be there for you...
I'll take care of you...
I'll walk with you...
