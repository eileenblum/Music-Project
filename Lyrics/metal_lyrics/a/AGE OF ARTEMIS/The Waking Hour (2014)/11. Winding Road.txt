When the waves wash away the signs on the sand
A helping hand is all I need but nobody cares

Still hang on though the storm stays strong
Leave the cold outside
We feel alone and share our tears again
People change, they rise again just to live another day
...And still we remain...

Misery is everywhere just look around and understand
But nobody cares
The winding road you choose to go
It makes no difference in this world
You're in the maze on your own

Still hang on though the storm stays strong
Leave the cold outside
We feel alone and share our tears again
People change, they rise again just to live another... way!!!

Waves crash revealing the man that lives inside
Starts may fall, just look around and you may find
Where I go and how do I find?
The path that leads me where I need to be
Here I stand with nothing to hide
And even though I choose to hide my tears
The winding road... the winding road..
