Look at this faded photograph
Memories of who I used to be
There was a time for you and me, yeah

"Let's build a castle in the sand"
Let's fight the waves
Don't let them wash away the dreams of those who dare

Every scar shows how strong we are
We're still breathing here
Love is nothing more than a word
If you just say it, so just give in

Surrender to your child within
Go play around, follow all your dreams
Don't you apologize, believe in yourself
Surrender to your child within
Go play around, follow all your dreams
Don't you apologize, believe in yourself
Shout it out loud!

Look at this floor beneath your feet
Memories from where I used to live
There was a time for you and me, yeah

Every scar shows how weak we are
We're still breathing here
Love is nothing more than a word
If you just shout it, so just give in

Surrender to your child within
Go play around, follow all your dreams
Do not apologize, believe in yourself
Surrender to your child within
Go play around, follow all your dreams
Don't you apologize, believe in your dreams
Shout it out loud.

A superhero, maybe a doctor, saving lives, helping each other
Travels around the world alone in a boat
Build a castle but not in the sand
Raise your voices and sing a melody
Find the truth that is inside your dreams
Keep going on, don't you let go, just let go!
Say it out loud, just look around
You'll understand when you have more past.

Surrender to your child within
Go play around, follow all your dreams
Don't you apologize, believe in yourself
Surrender to your child within
Go play around, follow all your dreams
Do not apologize, believe in your dreams
Shout it out loud.
