What is this now? Are we back in â64â?
We've been pushed over the edge for too long

We are rising
We are raising our heads up
Ready to stand up against the law!

You think you pull the strings
Stealing my pride, stealing my hope
Give back to me what you stole

What is this now? Why still living in 1964?
We are taking back the pride you took from us!

You think you pull the strings
Stealing my pride, stealing my hope
Give back to me what you stole

Before the sun goes down
Youâll find the rage is a matter of time
Weâll keep on marching out
You cannot hide yourself.
Itâs the waking hour!!!

You canât force to me surrender
You canât tell me what to do
I've got news to tell you, things are going to change
We are taking back to country you took from us

Before the sun goes down
Youâll find the rage is a matter of time
Weâll keep on marching out
You cannot hide yourself
Itâs our waking hour!!!
