The time has come and heâs leaving all behind
Everyone has their own cross to bear
The truth shows its face before him
Thereâs nothing left to regret

So he goes with fear in his eyes and heart full of lies
Searching for something heâll never know
Through death and despair, through hunger and shame
Makes the man weaker day after day

In the cold of the night he sleeps on the floor again
Pretending to be a king in his own bed
The face of the world reveals itself
There is no pride left within  

There he goes with fear in his eyes and sorrow inside
Searching for something heâll never know
Through hunger and pain, through death and despair
Makes the man weaker ...

âThy will is hard and hurt.â And his is broken.

There he goes with fear in his eyes and sorrow inside
Searching for something heâll never know
Heâs down on this knees, heâs begging you please
But heâs weaker and donât ...
Now he shows defeating his eyes
Heâs lost deep inside
Searching for something heâll never know
Though hunger and shame bring death and despair
It killed the boy within made him strong
Now heâs ready to go! Go...
