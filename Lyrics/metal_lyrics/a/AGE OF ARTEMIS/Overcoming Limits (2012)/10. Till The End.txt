Till The End
There's no way to hide yourselg in this world
Time is running out so be prepared
No peace, destruction all around
Just rage inside our heart

There are no rules that can't be broken
Love, I wonder when we'll feel for real
If god could see what's going on
How lost wll feel here
Are you really there?

Go find your destiny
There are no answer here
Bring back reality
Face uo your fate

Life's always the same, just wait till the end
Don't lose yourself, beliece what I say

Face up your fate

There's no way to hide yourselg in this world
Time is running out so be prepared
If god could see what's going on
How lost wll feel here
Are you really there?
(Really there?)
