God's and kings eyes
Set the world on fire
Flames are reaching us
Burning down humankind

Fools and queens desired
To defeat the time
Hunger for the power
Bringing down humanking

(Lost in the darkness)
Torture and greed
(Pain and disorder)
Envy all around
(Lost in the shadows)
Blood and disease
(Death all around)

You might say I'm losing my mind
But only the strong one survives
If you don't believe in these lines
You'll always be one step behind

(Lost in the darkness)
Torture and greed
(Pain and disorder)
Envy all around
(Lost in the shadows)
Blood and disease
(Death all around)

Everything you want seems to go wrong
Every dream is gone
Every man will die because
Only the strong one survives

The stronger will survive!
