When shadows drain your strengh
Feels like drawing in quicksand
If your soul has turned to grey
And you don't want to be saved

Does it brother you to fake a smile?

You'll know
You'll realize
The mirror never lies
No!

You're living in the edge
And i know it's up ti you
You're feeling like you're blind
But it's only in your mind

Does it brother you to fake a smile?

You'll know
You'll realize
The mirror never lies
I know your hands are tired
It's so hard to say goodbye

You'll see!

It's so hard to say goodbye
