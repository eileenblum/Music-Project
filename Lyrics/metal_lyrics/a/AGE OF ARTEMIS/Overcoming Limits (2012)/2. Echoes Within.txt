Destination: "far from your madness"
That's the only way to be safe
I can see in your eyes
All the lies you've denied, I tell you

There are some mistakes we can't let go
There's nothing to live or to die for
I can see in your eyes
All the lies you've denied

And I'm still on your side
(still on your side)
But I still got my pride

I am tired of this fight
But you don't realize
Close your eyes and you'll see deep inside
So get up and be free, before it's too late
And you'll cry no more for tomorrow
