The journey isn't over
It's really just beginning now
Living ain't easy
Feels like we're living in hell

People are getting tired
Of trying to make their dreams come true
Sons, wives, dies everyday
Feels like the hope is gone

Leave the past behind
(leave the past)
Before the days gone by
(before the days)

So do you believe in lies?
Can you really feel alive?
Can you really see the truth in your eyes?

Your words won't mean nothing
If you don't believe the things you say
Living is harder than before
Feels like the hope is gone

People are screaming louder
Trying to make the difference now
Doesn't matter to me if you cannot control all the lies that you say!

So do you believe in lies?
Can you really feel alive?
Can you really see the truth in your eyes?

Truth in your eyes...

(leave the past)
It's such a shame,
It's all in vain
(leave the past)
Don't matter how hard you try!
Leave the past behind!

So do you believe in lies?
Can you really feel alive?
Can you really see the truth in your eyes?
