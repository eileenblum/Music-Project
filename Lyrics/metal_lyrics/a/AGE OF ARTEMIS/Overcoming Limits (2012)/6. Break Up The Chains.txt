They try to tell how to live and what to say
Pretending to believe in they don't give a damn!
They tell you lies about the truth they never knew
Pretending to believe in something they don't know

If you don't do what they tell you
Be sure that you gonna pay!

It's easter lie than surrender
Then try to break up the chains
If you decide for insanity
Then live a good life instead

If you don't do what they tell you
You better watch for your child!

There must be some way to live
And escape from evil inside
There's no meaning in life if you don't know
How you feel inside your heart
Break up the chains!

There must be some way to live
Abd escape from evil inside
There's no meaning in life if you don't know

How to break up the chains just search in your heart

Break up the chains!
