Rest your soul try to release the ghosts
Let hope light your way
Time can heal any pain you feel
Breathe and don't be afraid

Your soul has turned to grey
(has turned to grey)
Your mind decides your fate
(decides your fate)

Just let me try
To steal your pain away
I never thought that you would go that far
I never saw a scar
The sleepless nights and all the tears you've cried
You choose to fade away

You stole my pride
Left me the shame
You left my heart out in the rain again
I guess we'll never understand

Falling slowly in the dark
You gave me nothing and i know it's all i've i got
Full of broken thoughts i cannot repair
This one last cry will leave it all behind !

This loneliness will find its ending
Breathe and let it out now
'cause time will show the path to those who's lost within
Alone will find yourself

Are you insane ?
You're someone else
I am still here
Don't say, you're feeling fine
There's no one here to blame !

Falling slowly in the dark
You gave me nothing and i know it's all i've i got
Full of broken thoughts i cannot repair
This one last cry will leave it all behind !
One last cry ...
