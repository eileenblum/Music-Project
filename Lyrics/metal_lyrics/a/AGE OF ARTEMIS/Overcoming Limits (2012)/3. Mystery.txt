We are the strangers in this world
Whose sons are living in the ground
We are the victims in this world of hate
We hear that peace will find it's way
But hope and history won't rhyme
It's such a shame, we still believe in lies

Desperation, rage and pain rules the human heart
Desolation everyday tearing us apart!

I only know what to live for, just wanna break all the chains
Don't need to fear death, I'll find our right after I'm gone

Desperation, rage and pain rules the human heart
Desolation everyday tearing our hopes apart!

The mistery of who we are, it's written right within our hearts
We are living in this godforsaken world alone
Trying too hard to survive everyday

We are the strangers in this town
We are the voices with no sound
We are the lost ones wanted to be found

Desperation, rage and pain rules the human heart
Desolation everyday tearing our hopes apart!

The mistery of who we are, it's written right within our hearts
We are living in this godforsaken world alone
Trying too hard to survive everyday

Desperation, rage and pain rules the human heart
Desolation everyday tearing our hopes apart!

(The mistery of who we are, it's written right within our hearts)
We are living in this godforsaken world alone
Trying too hard to survive everyday
Everyday...
Trying everyday!
