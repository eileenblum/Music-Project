Sometimes i wonder
Who are you now?
I just want to know about you

Will you tomorrow?
Will you someday?
Be who you want to be

Where are you? i just wanna see your eyes
Tell me if, the sun will rise and help me find my way

Won't you give me your hand now?
You're not alone no!
Don't let go, without you i will fall
Please remember that your life is too short
I know you'll find a way

One more day
One more try
One moment to feel the pain

I tell you you're running out of time
Life goes on, the sun will rise so stand up and be brave!

Won't you give me your hand now?
You're not alone no!
Don't let go, without you i will fall
Please remember that your life is too short
I hope you'll find a way

You'll find a way!

Won't you give me your hand now?
You're not alone no!
Don't let go, without you i will fall
Won't you give an answer just one more moment!
Don't let go

Take me home with you...
