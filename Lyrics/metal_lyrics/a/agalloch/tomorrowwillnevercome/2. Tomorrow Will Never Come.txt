You gonna kill?
See I still have this, this male aggression thing and I don't know if you're gonna kill me and I don't care, enough's enough.

Cause we were getting twenty gunshots that night and I couldn't figure out where they were coming from. I went out there and found out everybody was shooting everybody. There's a lot of stress in that city, in Detroit as far as stopping crime if you wanna stop the crime, you better talk to John Nichols cause he knows what he's doin'.

Man you know how it feels, I feel worse tonight. That man, if I wanted him to listen, get up and go to Beverley and leave me alone, he would do it. He has a father complex, I wish he was the father complex, he's sixty-eight years old and he'd still kick my ass even though I can deep squat for 2000 or so. I don't have any fun, at all. That's the least of problems. There ain't no fun out there killing people, no.

I've got a certain amount of common sense. I know the precedence of morals, and whether you believe it or not you've taught me a lot. Don't worry if you wanna screw off the past...

I'm scared of you! Who do I go to? Where do I go? Nothing that you knew you were doing 'cept I've always known what I was doing. Dr. Fratelli said, "Gerald, there's nothing wrong with you. You are so sane you're insane!"
I don't have no fun, ever! You worked thirty years at Chrysler's, well hell I got fifteen years seniority there, what are you talkin' about? I don't have no fun at all!

What, it's very fashionable to say that it's schizophrenia so I guess I'm unfashionable.

Which would you rather have: sleeping a lot and staying on the subject or being more awa- I'm sleeping a lot, I'm being awake, cause I feel now that I've got a fairy friend out of childhood who got very anxious around people. And last Yuletide took the resolution: "I don't like people." And my reply, this Yuletide, is: "Mad chicken."
