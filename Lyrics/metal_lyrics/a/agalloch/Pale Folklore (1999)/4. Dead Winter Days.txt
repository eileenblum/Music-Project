There lies a beauty behind forbidden wooden doors 
A beauty so rare and pure, it would make human eyes bleed and burn... 

...She killed herself in the fall... 

I am the unmaker, I bring death to the beautiful dawn 
With pillor, cold, and a legion of dying angels... 

...I killed myself in the spring... 

A grim bough had hung me high 
I sank the fires of the Sol 
Here, nightfall reigns 

I oppose the light 
I gather the storms 
with a sword I wield with hate 
I shot down the sun with bow and flame 
Pillorian for the dead winter 

I am the unmaker 
The pillorian...the ending 
I...die... 
I damn you the dead winters... 

[Music by Haughm/Anderson/J. William W. (2/97 - 11/98)]
