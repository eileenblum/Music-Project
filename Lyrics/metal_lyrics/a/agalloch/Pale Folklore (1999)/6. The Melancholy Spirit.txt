It was in this haunted place under a moonless cloak of ebony 
I was drawn to the glow of a young spiritess weeping in the woods 

The blackest ravens and ice-veiled boughs 
Have spoken of you, goddess of these bleak woods 
I yearn for your embrace, spiritess of the melancholia 
Show me, again, your sweet face 
Enchant me with your rich, cinder burnt ether 
Lure me into your arms and bless unto me eternal death 

She had spoken to the dawn 
Her words wisped in tongues of the wind 

And then silence... 
Pale clouds betrothed the dawn  
Black rain fell 
The birds wore masks 

The haunting stain of her woe 
Had burned itself into the oak 
Night had gone 
Bereaved, I was torn for her 

One last time I witnessed her beauty in the distance 
The arms of the trees tore at her morbid gown swaying in the loathsome winter
breeze 
She faded before my eyes 
Since that day a thousand veiled birds have taken flight 
And the melancholy rain still pours forever on...
