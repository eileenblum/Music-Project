Oh dismal mourning... 
I open my weary eyes once again 
My life has been left hollow and ashes have filled the gorge of my within 
Last night I hoped and wished I'd die in my sleep but no catharsis was granted to
me 
Will this pain ever pass? 
The enchanting perfume of winter and the bleak, cold breath of her still haunts
me... 
Oportet ubique pulchritudinem evanescere 

So half of me rode to the mountains and the other half soared high in the winds 
to a place where the angels had fallen, the soil gagged and choked on their wings 
My soul was the pale skyline that she stretched across the horizon 
Two years had brought the fire that she paints upon my loathsome canvas 

She is the dark one... 
As a bird I watched her from my cold tower in the heavens 
and when she fell from the northplace, I flew down and embraced her 
I took her where the snow falls forever, she showed me the haunted woods 
We gathered together in the oaken palace, free from both death and life 
The fire blazed in her eyes one day and she tore the soul from my chest 
With a bleeding heart, I flew back to my cold tower 
to never escape and lie in a pool of death forever 

I saw the nightfall... 
It called to me like a river of shadows 
It sang to me with the cries of a thousand ravens that blackened the sky as they
took flight 
and sank the Sol 
I shall never trust the sun again, Eridanis Nadir 

I ran away far into the woods 
To find the Sol, I called to her... 
"I don't want to be forgotten...I never wanted to be human" 
NEVER!!!!! 

So alas the sun had descended, her fire burned brilliant in the sky 
The trees bore their withered silhouettes, that cast a spell upon unearthly white 
No wolf shall keep his secrets, no bird shall dance the skyline 
And I am left with nothing but an oath that gleams like a sword 
To bathe in the blood of man 
Mankind...
