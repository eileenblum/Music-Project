[Lord Summerisle:]
âAnd the ministers fled the island never to return. What my grandfather
started out of expediency, my father continued out of love. He brought me
up the same way: to reverence the music, and the drama, and the rituals of
the old gods; to love nature and to fear it, and to rely on it and to
appease it when necessary. He brought me upâââ

[Sergeant Howie:]
âHe brought you up to be a pagan!â

[Lord Summerisle:]
âA heathen, conceivably, but not, I hope, an unenlightened one.â
