The woeful silence; wind's reflection
Of your body's pale, icy fortress
... of blood and ages

Sky fire above, ice below the hearth
Sky fire above, ice below the hearth

Fall away from me
To that citadel at the end of time
Where death sleeps
And dreams of your buried pain

There has never been a silence like this before
There will never be an ode like this again
