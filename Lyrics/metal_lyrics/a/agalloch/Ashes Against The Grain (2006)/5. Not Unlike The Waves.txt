Aurora swims in the ether
Emerald fire scars the night sky
Solstafir

Amber streams from Sol
Are not unlike the waves
Of the sea nor the endless horizon of ice
Solstafir

Aurora swims in the ether
Emerald fire paints the twilight
Heidrun bleeds the golden nectar
For the rising sun and the moon
The midnight wolves who watch over the dawn
A golden dawn

Solstafir
