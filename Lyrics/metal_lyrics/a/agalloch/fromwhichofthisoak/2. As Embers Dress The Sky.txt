The shallow voice of the wind
cries between these ebony wings
The shallow cries of the win
sing a swansong for mankind

Shine on morning skyfire
ablaze this final day
The autumnal end, the dawn of man
The centuries fade below my feet

I soared above them
as they worthlessly poured
thought from a chalice
as wisdom would flow,
twilight would come to pass
drink oh hallowed cup of life

Shine on evening skyfire
paint the sky with the blood of a raven
bereavement, oh garment of ebony
as embers dress the dusk of man...
