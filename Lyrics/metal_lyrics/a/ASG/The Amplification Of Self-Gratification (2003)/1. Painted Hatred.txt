Can i feel the sun again
Will my eyes over beam that color red
Would i want to start i've lost
is know back again
And the black clouds
Circle round my head

And i failed you in the way [x2]

Can i fill it up again
Self indulged to im kicking through the bends
Well until i've lost
A new scar was born
And your face seem to dance under the flame

And i failed you in the way [x2]

Do you know what you've done
Know who you saved
Don't you care that we see
That bullshit you crave
I'll paint you hatred
