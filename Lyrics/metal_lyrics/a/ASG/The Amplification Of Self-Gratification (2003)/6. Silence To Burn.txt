Well satan the ending
We wait for beginning
Can't you see my soul has been warped in
Constant rejection, we wait for acception
And we drive my heart inside your skin
Kingdom of crosses and tally the losses
Can't you see my soul has been warped in
The hatred's accending the truth is decending
And we drive my heart inside your skin

The patience is ending, with flashes of envy
Open wide my thoughts of satan's men
Destination destruction we seek reconstruction
Can't you see my heart has been killed in
Our guitly is dawning with changes are calling
Open wide my thoughts of satan's men
The hatred's decending the truth is accending
Womans gasp in and i will keep you in

When that feeling cut my eye
Spun me round to see that pain
Was gave in on me
Cause in this game your playing rough
Catching scars and breathing back
The claim for me

Second guessing, seconds lost
Pass that torch, cause i am back
On my feet once again
And wait for a pain
