Caress me gently I'm on fire
No wailing wall to hold my last two tears
Upside down we did grow
And if you memorize your steps they just might get you out from here
Ain't too much around here to hold someone's attention
I'll get the best of you and triumph
A tidal wave of emptiness is near
Have you heard pain before? I bet you listen well
After forever your last words appear
When your eyes are bound
