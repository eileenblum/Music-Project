The weakness is driving us wild
Trapped in impatience the hunt
Unleash us to victory fire
Bask in the wine of our flood
Millions of feet to climb these heights
Thoughts not one betray
I'd torture the rest of my days
Just to run wild once again
Lie and tremble
Struck by the sunlight flanked by the rain
God's shame pit flesh wound cave
Unraveled by a lifetime of shit and disfigurement
Holy abandonment slave
Lie and tremble like a failure
Line up, come and take it
