Self inflicted the wound
I bled for you, come now and bleed for me too
Then stitch me up again
Can't see the shape of your face
But your eyes let my sun rise, blanket my mind
Uncover me again
Dead flowers on the wall vultures in the den
Got a long list of foes and a shorter list of friends
Bury my heart in the woods
Spread my remains close by where the weeping willow stood
I'll be born again
