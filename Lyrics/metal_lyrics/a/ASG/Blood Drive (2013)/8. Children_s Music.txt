Under my bow, an arrow
Northern twine, strung to a southerly stave
Twilight of a life, eastern black watery gaze
Western swine, fruits of the seasonal raze

Surprise the break of day
Gone Writhing everyone
Lost smiles, demon rhymes
Twisted through time

Severed by stone, new marrow
Rosen spine, draped in olfactory glaze
Romance be the wine, fermented water of snakes
Downstream lies, black pond where lucifer waits
