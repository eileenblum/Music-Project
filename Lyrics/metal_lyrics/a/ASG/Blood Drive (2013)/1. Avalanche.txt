All the gods are crazy can't you see
Like the firelight that builds in me
Temper is the town I sank my feet
Grinding churning endlessly
Solar eclipse the day
Mind beam narcotic state
So far it looks the same
High speed into the grave
Avalanche surprise me when you fall
Terror rides along this shooting star
I see earth reflections staring tall
Highlights of the world I left you on
Started cold
Twin sight rhyme
Midnight lung
Wave they walk
Tremble tired
Empty signs
Sore eyes tight
More rain
