Stuck inside a beating circle
Define my nature, first in the fun
My arms gather tracks left behind

It's toxic roots and heads like tree scars
Lick wounds and atrophy
Born to ride helplessly into a burning sky

We can't eat them all at one time
But we like the way
It keeps ourselves on the climb

Mother maker rebirth in the sun

Stuck inside a beating circle
Torn by time in fields forever
Hearts born twice at once
