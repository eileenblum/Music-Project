Set the tourniquet
Bury shots at the firing range
Trading scars
Wreck and return
Casualty outcome but I won't be one

It's a hostile retreat and the fangs are out, and it's coming after me again
It's an ordinary lie, on an ordinary day
And it's coming after me again

Lights out we ride
Tearing holes in a sunken sky
Fictional crisis
Choke in the air
Believing in something but it's just not there
