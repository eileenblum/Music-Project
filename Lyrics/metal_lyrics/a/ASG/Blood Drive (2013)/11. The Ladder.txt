Would you go down, down
Into the flames with me
Set a course, for die speed
The bayonet obeys

It feels like the dark page is turning
Death faces engrained in my floor
At first light there goes Jacob running
And the nameless take shapes like a storm

Take a hold of bright light
The heir of sane betrays
Seven floors to dive through
The air in flames remains
