The lightning that strikes in between us
Fades into the eyes of the day
Creedence is strong as horizon
Forward the cry blood soaked from the mass lie

Blue sky, tortured by darkness the sun obeys
And you dead kids, I'll give you something worth fighting for
Open their eyes

The flood of the fountain receives us
Beckon to the light and the fade
Madhouse of pain without reason
Fuck and defy, blackout the battle cry

Blue sky, tortured by darkness the sun obey
And you dead kids, I'll give you something worth fighting for
Open their eyes

The lie of the culprit defeated is dead
Holes where there were eyes, space for the dead
Severance is calling you know where we lie
Save you we tried, welcome to the new light

Blue sky, tortured by darkness the sun obey
And you dead kids, I'll give you something worth fighting for
Open their eyes
