My conscience is severed, 
By the rage in another man's soul
In a land where love is forsaken, 
It's kind of hard to climb out these holes
And it stains, it stains your soul
And its taking me over
Yeah it's taking my over
Yeah it's taking me over
Yeah it's taking me over

My solace is shaken
Lie down mercurial foe
Crucified in the image of nothing
Engineered for a purpose unknown
And it stains, it stains your soul
And it's taking me over
Yeah it's taking me over
Yeah it's taking me over
Yeah it's taking me over

Takes no time son, it takes no time
Takes no time son, it takes no time

My conscience is severed, 
By the rage in another man's soul
In a land where love is forsaken, 
It's kind of hard to climb out these holes
And it stains, it stains your soul
And it stains, it stains your soul
And its taking me over
Yeah it's taking my over
Yeah it's taking me over
Yeah it's taking me over
