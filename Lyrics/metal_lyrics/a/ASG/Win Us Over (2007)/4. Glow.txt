God a painting of a story told some years ago
About a man who had it all but had to go
He'd seen more than he could hold
Lost his mind, a kid, a wife in a holy war

All god's armies bound glory, 
bombs and babies know, when they glow

Resurrection of a husband, painter and a home
Family crisis on a crucifix of stone
If you see him let me know
All he wanted was to watch his children grow

All god's armies bound for glory,
Bombs and babies know, when they glow
When they glow
When they glow

All god's armies bound for glory. 
Bombs and babies know
All god's armies bound for glory
Bombs and babies know, when they glow
When they glow
When they glow
