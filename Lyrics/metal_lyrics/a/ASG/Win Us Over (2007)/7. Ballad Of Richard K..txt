Kicked down by the ones who sat by your side
God's flesh under the night shine of lonely pines
In the house of no hope, cut to size
Hopelessly divided, I bend down into the knife
In the path of my force, left to die
Vengeance on the highway, I blend back into the life

Well your god won't smile and your conscience can't sleep
Tremble in the wind as fire flies, against your shield
What if I killed you all, would it fill me up
Tremble in the wind as fire flies, against your shield

Ten seconds until the blackout parts with it's crime
God money don't buy man, don't buy the life
In the house of no hope, cut to size
Hopelessly divide, I bend down into the knife

Well your god won't smile and your conscience can't sleep
Tremble in the wind as fire flies, against your shield
What if I killed you all, would if fill me up
Tremble in the wind as fire flies, against your shield

Lay down red river, and try to buy life
Time sinks like blood in this gutter
I try to buy life

Well your god won't smile and your conscience can't sleep
Tremble in the wind as fire flies, against your shield
What if I killed you all, would it fill me up
Tremble in the wind as fire flies against your shield
