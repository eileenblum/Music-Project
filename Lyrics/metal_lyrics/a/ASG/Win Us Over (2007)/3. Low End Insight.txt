Tin soldiers could start the war
Scrap medals for sale
Buy twilight of misery
Death metal prevails
Polish my eye
To polished stone
The alloy is weakening, by the hammer thrown

Some say that heaven's a home
Others find comfort in fire down below
We got friends on both sides
Some are still living 
Others have died

Blood of my my eye
Love blinded and violent
Blood of my eye, love blinded and violent

If the bright light you swim between 
Should flicker and fail
Shock currents will set you free
Black winds fill your sails
Polish my eye
To the polished stone
The alloy is weakening, by the hammer thrown

Some say that heaven's a home
Others find comfort in fire down below
We got friends on both sides
Some are still living
Others have died

Blood of my my eye
Love blinded and violent
Blood of my eye, love blinded and violent

Some say that heaven's a home
Others find comfort in fire down below 
We got friends on both sides
Some are still living
Others have died

Blood of my my eye
Love blinded and violent
Blood of my eye, love blinded and violent
