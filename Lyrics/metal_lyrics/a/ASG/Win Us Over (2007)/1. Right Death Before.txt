God speaks his love through splits in tongues.

White light comes forth. 
Right death before you go
Breath again
And smile for the first time 
Before you go
Breath again
And smile for the first time

White light comes forth
Right death before you go
Breath again
And smile for the first time
Before you go
Breath again
And smile for the first time
