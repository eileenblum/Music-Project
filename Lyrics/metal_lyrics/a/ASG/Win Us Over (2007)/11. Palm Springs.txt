Pam springs, a decade in the salt and sun
The blood it clots and the tears they run
No moderation to attract
Nor a veil to hide my shame
Oh the cost that it brings

Don't trust your eyes
They'll never tell you what's inside
The violence lies in a bed of white
This resurrection is in fact
Just a field of disarray
Oh the cost that it brings

If you're not scared then why'd you bring that gun
Dead bodies baking in the center of the sun
Hand grenades to blow away a passion that has turned to plague
Your mother said I was the one

Jesus I'm a sinner
Jesus I'm your sin
Jesus I'm a sinner yes and I must sin again
Jesus I'm a sinner halos choke my will away
One of many children that could never find the way

If you're not scared then why'd you bring that gun
Dead bodies baking in the center of the sun
Hand grenades to blow away a passion that has turned to plague
You mother said I was the one
I'm dead and gone

If you're not scared then why'd you bring that gun
Dead bodies baking in the center of the sun
Hand grenades to blow away a passion that has turned to plague
You mother said I was the one
I'm dead and gone
