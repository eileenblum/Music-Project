Marching towards the sun
'Under command but under no one
Master of war and lords
It rained for thirteen day
The horses seem to know their number 
Focus on you alone

All I've got is what you see
All I've got is what you see
All I've got is what you see

Pick up the stars and decay on this battle ground
Pick up the stars and decay

It's my gift to you
The purest pain a man could live through
Just in an afternoon
Emerald green the sea
Born again amongst these trees
Rooted I am their history

All I've got is what you see
All I've got is what you see
All I've got is what you see

Pick up the stars and decay on this battle ground
Pick up the stars and decay

Marching towards the sun
'Under command but under no one
Master of war and lords
It rained for thirteen day
The horses seem to know their number 
Focus on you alone

All I've got is what you see
All I've got is what you see
All I've got is what you see

Pick up the stars and decay on this battle ground
Pick up the stars and decay
