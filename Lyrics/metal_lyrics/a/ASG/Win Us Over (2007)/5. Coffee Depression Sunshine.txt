I'd like you to stop
Why?
You're killing my fun
Oh? 
But you've got the nerve of someone that cares

And if there were dark skies
Would you come shade on our fun
The future is bolder than anyone can see

Lips from your mother 
Eyes that could stare through the sun
No good could recover all the cruel things that we've done

Bullets that fly by, shot by the gun with no heart
Death isn't dirt it's perfectly clean
Perfectly clean

And if there were bright skies
Would you come shade on our fun
The future is bolder than anyone can see

Lips from your mother Eyes that could stare through the sun
No good could recover all the cruel things that we've done
All the cruel things that we've done
All the cruel things that we've done
All the cruel things that we've done
All the cruel things that we've done
All the cruel things we've
