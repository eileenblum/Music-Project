Didn't think you'd ever get so far
There was a death in Georgia
In the back of your car
Did they ever get a name
You left him dead in the rain
You had a crooked smile, I'm sure it Helped with the miles

They couldn't find you in the pagan scene 
where the wild wings roam and the air is clean
but those ruthless angels, kept tracking your souls
to a golden sky, down in Mexico

To justify isn't what I want
I used to stalk your eyes
Make you take what I want
Did you ever do the same
And fall in love with the pain
You know I never tried
I got too hooked off the high

They couldn't find me in the pagan scene
Where the wild things roam and the air is clean
But those ruthless angels kept tracking my soul
To a golden sky down in Mexico

You gotta win, us over
You gotta win, us over

They couldn't find us in the pagan scene
Where the wild things roam and the air is clean
But those ruthless angels kept tracking my soul
To a golden sky down in Mexico

You gotta win, us over
You gotta win, us over
You gotta win
You gotta win
