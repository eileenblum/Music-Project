[performed by ASG]sleeping eye on waking day 
the blood torn field from which i came 
long may i reign 
in the battle of ancient betray 
makes no difference, because you are not my kind 
makes no difference, world has been blackened 
i am shadow i am light 
take my stand on shaking ground 
the open sea for which iâm bound 
long may i reign
fuck it to die is today 
open my war, open my war
