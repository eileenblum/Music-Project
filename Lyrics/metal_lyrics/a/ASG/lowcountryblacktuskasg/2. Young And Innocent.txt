[performed by ASG]box me up lay me in the clay 
burn my poems and all my sad songs 
like another but not the same 
still it's funny what life does with you 
most of us come back but not quite the same 
well i just can't tell what to believe 
i just cannot tell what i should be, living to try or dying to leave 
like the master within the slave 
breaking fear in a room with no view 
like the other but not the same 
still it's funny what life does with you 
most of us come back but not quite the same 
the devil is laughing engraving my name
