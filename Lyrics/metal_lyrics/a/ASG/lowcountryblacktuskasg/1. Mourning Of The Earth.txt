[performed by ASG]roman candles in the sky, the moonlight ransom 
i am the visions encased in your spine, and the beating of her drum 
burn my bridges just for fun, how i doubt you 
tenderfoot and lashing tongue, i will run you through 
scrape out what's left of my mind 
come dine with demons, step inside the weather's fine 
a new view to enjoy 
scale down the mountains, paradise lost and destroyed 
take my body, take my mind 
does my name escape you? 
i am the lake that still burns hot with fire 
in the mourning of the earth
