Teach us not to play fair,
we are trapped in the name of this game,
and the time rolls on, you didn't have to stay so long

picture the holes in your head,
we made war of your worlds taking place,
and the skies glow on, the mirror has two-faced us all

time won't drag too long
climb to drag you down
time to hang you dry
