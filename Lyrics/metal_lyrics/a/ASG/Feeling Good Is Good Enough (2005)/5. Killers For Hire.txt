I'll take control
And toss the coin that i came to hold
Reap the crops i dared to sow
Within the days we roam
Seven sins for the weak to hold
Stronger men have gained control
It's starting to sting

My days grown cold
We hardly knew what we had to know
We have left but not alone
Rain sway in southern planes
Whispers of the dead remain
Locked in bars and rusting through my veins

Could you kindly remind me why
Seldom the change and frequent the fire a glance
To put it simply, death is at hand

Within those pale blue lifeless eyes
Bury your head surrender the trial a glance
I set it free and gave it the chance
To watch, you die.

I'd take your life away
Consequences look the same
Soaked in blood or naked in the rain

Could you kindly remind me why
Seldom the change and frequent the fire a glance
To put it simply, death is at hand

Within those pale blue lifeless eyes
Bury your head surrender the trial a glance
I set it free and gave it the chance
To watch, you die.

Well i'll take your life away
Consequences look the same
Soaked in blood or naked in the rain

Could you kindly remind me why
Seldom the change and frequent the fire a glance
To put it simply, death is at hand

Within those pale blue lifeless eyes
Bury your head surrender the trial a glance
I set it free and gave it the chance
To watch, you die
