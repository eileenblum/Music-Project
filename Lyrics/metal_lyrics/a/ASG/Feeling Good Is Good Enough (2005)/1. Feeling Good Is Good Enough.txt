Gotta find a reason!
And this reason weighs well!
There's not a goddamn thing
That you can prescribe
To help me through another night

It's the start of a season!
And this season won't change!
And there's a fire inside
the ones that we hide
Brought down away fro the light! God Damn!

Inaudible screaming
We're gonna tell you why
And i came to see
All the finer things
they got to offer tonight

You're a delicate resource
We're gonna suck you dry!
Cause there's a side of our kind
watching you why not
Kick back enjoy the ride.

Forget prevention of our use
Just breath through
Tonight we'll try
to fade out through the sun
storm on everyone
Judge rings might dry
the poison on our hands
could someone take a stand

Gotta find a reason!
And this reason weighs well!
There's not a goddamn thing
That you can prescribe
To help me through another night

It's the start of a season!
And this season won't change!
And there's a fire inside
the ones that we hide
Brought down away fro the light!

Forget prevention of our use
Just breath through
Tonight we'll try
to fade out through the sun
storm on everyone
Judge rings might dry
the poison on our hands
could someone take a stand for me

So cross your fingers
Cause tonight we come alive
Regulate on everything
Amongst the chills we spill
the skies we'll come undone
Raining blood on everything!

Forget prevention of our use
Don't let the beatings drag you down
You don't accomplish things inside
Just breath through
Tonight we'll try
to fade out through the sun
storm on everyone
Judge rings might dry
the poison on our hands
could someone take a stand for me
