Unleash the dogs of war on love tonight, before they maul the brave,
Stone these pimps and whores and hang them high, and wen they die a clearer sun will rise, and blaze on everything.
Fuck that way of life and fuck you too.

Im gonna soak the silk with sweat tonight, within the pink i sink, let me dance beside the devil in your eyes.
My god they finally found a way to terrorise the sane, we do it better in the night can you.

We take it easy, we take it twice, we tremble through the night with you.
Clean you up with th blood that i spill, and take you down through the night.
As i clean you up with th blood that i spill, and take you down through the night
