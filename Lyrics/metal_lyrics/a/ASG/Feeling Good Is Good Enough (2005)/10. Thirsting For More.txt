An ultralviolet saw her
Raise the back of pain
So i cut you deep inside to
Symbolize the game

Electric tales that call me
Stare without reframe
Well i sit inside the miles
To gather what you gave

So don't stray close to the sun
The wind with your face
Engaging the gun
Eclipsing the pain

We're crushing through your gate our
Distance is away
It's what america our
Children take the blame

A competition where
The medals choke the game
Resistance secret follow
Hard to show the shame

So don't stray close to the sun
The wind with your face
Engaging the gun
Eclipsing the pain

Close to the sun
The wind with your face
Engaging the gun
Eclipsing the pain

In the sky we gaze on
No ones at home
For to Long [x2]

Rejected palates dark sin
Came from state to state
Requested medals break the backs
Of those who wait

Electric tales that call me
Stare without reframe
Well i sit inside the miles
To gather what you gave

So don't stray close to the sun
The wind with your face
Engaging the gun
Eclipsing the pain
