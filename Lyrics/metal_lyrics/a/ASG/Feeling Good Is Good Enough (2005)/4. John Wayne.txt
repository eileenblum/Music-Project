There it is...

Goddamn baby I can't breathe!
My face is swelling and I spilled my seeds
Bloodshot, best not interrupt
We won't survive until we've filled our cups
But I guess we can't complain, we're all going insane!

Hold tight, the razor wire
Make her feel like a third of a kind
Bloodshot, best not interrupt
We won't survive until we've filled our cups
But I guess we can't complain, we're all going insane!

Destination owed to my decay
Hard to find through our delicate life
Sex explosion â blow my mind away!
John Wayne and cheap cocaine
It all breaks me down! Breaks you down! Broken again...

We have our own defenses...
Hold it tight! Running scared! Feel like a man!
Stuck in line for a backseat southern affair...
We had our own defenses to test...

I'm stuck inside your smile with a gun
I'm stuck inside your smile with a gun
I won't waste my shots firing holes to the sun
Now I'll feel when I'm clean...

Destination owed to my decay
