Between the cracks in the sky
lies a gambler's vacation
the odds are as sweet as a white desert heat
gravity keeps to the shade
as the sunlight drains the sickness away
the calories climb as i die in your mind

so push the mountains aside
no room for the valley to hide
oh i'll be the rocket
you be the sky

within the cavernous mind
there's a candle for gazin'
embracing the face of dead lover's remains
while you lie today
the loneliness will never fade
we'll watch you die under the sun

so push the mountains aside
no room for the valley to hide
oh i'll be the rocket
you be the sky

between the rivers of spite
the blood of the sun will ignite
collapsing the diamond shine of your eyes

so push the mountains aside
no room for the valley to hide
oh i'll be the rocket
you be the sky

between the rivers of spite
the blood of the sun will ignite
collapsing the diamond shine of your eyes
