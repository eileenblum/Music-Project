Push the pill amend the cure
To fast to fade to slow to hide

And when we come down
We come motherfucker help into grill
Our new vacation has already failed to fail

And when we come down
We come motherfucker help into grill
Its new vacation so ready to fail to fail

Going through hell
Going through hell
Going through hell

Going through hell

Pack your bags we'll set the light

Your running with our arms
No swing before the cause
All the lies we have inside
All the lies we have inside

We'll never cool cause we're
Going through hell
Going through hell
Going through hell

Fact we've been there twice tonight
Going through hell
Going through hell
Going through hell

Going through hell
Going through hell
Going through hell

Pack your bags we'll set the light
