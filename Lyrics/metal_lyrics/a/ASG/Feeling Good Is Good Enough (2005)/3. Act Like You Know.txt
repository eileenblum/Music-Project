There's one thing you should know
And two things that you need
The first one you can find
The second i've given
I'll bring it out of you
If you take it out of me
Is creeping down your thighs
Your makin me shallow

From the cornors to the curbs
To the keepers of the faith
To the comets in your eyes
You take it for granted
Oh was i suppose to show
Oh was i suppose to care
That danger look inside
That smile is my poison

Time takes the will away
Not a moment to spare
In the time it takes to reject the pain
A gun cannot repair
Time takes it's time

As you take me down
And blind my eyes
And break me down to size

As you take me down
And blind my eyes
And break me down to size

Time takes the will away
Not a moment to spare
In the time it takes to reject the pain
A gun cannot repair
Time takes it's time
Takes you back
Breaks you down to size

As you take me down
And blind my eyes
And break me down to size

As you take me down
And blind my eyes
And break me down to size
