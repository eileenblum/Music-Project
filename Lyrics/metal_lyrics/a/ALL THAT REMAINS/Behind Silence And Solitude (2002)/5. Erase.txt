don't leave you said to me
and for a moment i feared i'd stay
but your plea rang hollow so i quietly
walked away
i can see you through the glass
and i wonder was it done in vain
now i'd do anything
to simply make the pain go away

if you'd have me i'd take you back again
and erase the mistakes i've made
if you'd have me i'd take you back again
and add to the mistakes i've made

i remember morning light
and a shower to clear my head
everyday a reminder of what a fool i've
been
seemed when i left you i'd left everything i'd
known
now you have shown me
i'm not the man i thought i was

i believed in you
i had faith in you
i was there for you
now i'm lost in you
