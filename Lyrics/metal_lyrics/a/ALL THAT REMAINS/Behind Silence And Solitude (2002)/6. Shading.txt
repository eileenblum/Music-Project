i've seen through the shading
and down to what's within
reaching you will feel me

lost and alone
you said i was what you were looking for
so why do i feel so empty

and it seemed so real
pulled from my grasp taken away
am i nothing in your eyes
reaching out i feel
you were pulling away, never letting me in
i am nothing in your eyes

day in day out i see you live your life again
a fool i stand here in waiting
in letters words and pictures
you profess your love to me
and to the last they were lies

the malice i should feel for you deceitfulness
some how always escapes me
and in the shading
between the words you said to me
i know i'd be left empty
