can not a man of modern day
find truth in what he's learned
of all the seventh days a waste
a fool for all the lies i've prayed yet i'm strong
i'll place no blame
although misled i've found the truth

this one belief, strength for this mortal dance
this one truth, i feel i'll be set free
this one faith, i know i'll not falter
this one belief, i know i'll be redeemed

the night once called to me
an eloquent caress she offered
but i'll not make my bed with whores
and in the place she left a harder yet much truer thing
and now by this i gauge the world

strength for this mortal dance

i feel i'll be set free
i know i'll not falter
i know i'll be redeemed
