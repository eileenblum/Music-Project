one moment never told that i have seen nobility
my life's been molded
by that which was demonstrated for me
i'll not deny the truth
of right and wrong set forth for me
if i am half of this my simple pride will be released

never believed, deceived by the foolish
the weak embody lies

here in lies the heart of this truth
i know now what it's worth
a second chance at this
or reason to justify this gift
a simple talk or two would let me feel more at ease
six feet an earthen home in silence
the circle incomplete
