and i see nothing i can do would change this now
this last caress i'll cherish forever
if i could i would kiss all your tears away
this emptiness can only bring sorrow

if you leave
i will follow
wherever you go i will be there for you

i believe that our destines were entwined
now i see that my fate's been decided
how i hope that in some way you'll remember me
can't you see that i'd lay down my life for you
