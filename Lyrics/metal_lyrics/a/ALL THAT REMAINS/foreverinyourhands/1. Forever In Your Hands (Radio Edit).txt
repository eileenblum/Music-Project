I know that I can stand my head high
Forget not where I fall
Still I find why and reason

Yet that conflict still filling me
Mistrust venom inside of me
I am not the man that you see
Just look inside me

Trust in me the way I trusted you
I know we could have done this together
If you believed in me like I believed in you
My heart would be forever in your hands

How I miss February still
Now that this becomes the moment
Of all our failures
