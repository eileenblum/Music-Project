No reason to repent no one will answer my prayers
And in the black of night I call and no one's there
A lack of vision. A lack of sight
One god destroys me, another brings me to life

Indebted before we leave the womb
A lifetime spent to avoid our doomA struggle so basic, we live our lives
in fear
It still means nothing because nothing is real

We are all just moments in time
We come from nothing and we're nothing when we die
We are just an instant in time
We come from nothing and we're nothing when we die

Vastness confounds us every day
Arrogance these silly games we play
Why should we believe we are eternal?

So clever but primal urges block our way
Designed by time, there could be no other way
Take solace in ignorance, return to nothing
and in nothing remain

We are all just moments in time
We come from nothing and we're nothing when we die
We are just an instant in time
We come from nothing and we're nothing when we die

Eternity is so massive, we cannot comprehend
So take every last bit and on nothing depend
We are moments in time. We come from nothing
We are moments in time. We are nothing

No man can comprehend

We are all just moments in time
We come from nothing and we're nothing when we die
We are just an instant in time
We come from nothing and we're nothing when we die

No man can comprehend we are nothing.
