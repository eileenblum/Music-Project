I have no words that I can say
To make you see that
I know I couldn't make you stay
I cannot beat this
What have you done
This all seems so wrong
I hate that you let it in
And now that you're gone
The night seems so long
And I can't pretend

I know I'm asking too much
And you're not coming back again
I know I'm asking too much
And you'll never be mine again
I'm not gonna find you
Outside of my door
But damn I wanna let you in
I know I'm asking too much
And you'll never
Â 
And still the writings on the wall
To close to see it
You know this better Then them all
You don't believe it
What have you done
This all seems so wrong
I hate that you let it in
And now that you're gone
The nights seem long
And I can't pretend

I know I'm asking too much
And you're not coming back again
I know I'm asking too much
And you'll never be mine again
I'm not gonna find you outside of my door
But damn I won't let you in
I know I'm asking too much
And you'll never be mine again

And now you're goneÂ 
Nothing makes this seems more wrong
The memory of your face keeps dragging me along
When I feel lost
I know that I have paid the cost
And now I'll find my way

I know I'm asking too much
And you're not coming back again
I know I'm asking too much
And you'll never be mine again
I'm not gonna find you
Outside of my door
But damn I won't let you in
I know I'm asking too much
And you'll never be mine again
