Just let it go, don't want to argue anymore
I canât be sure I know just what weâre fighting for
I know that youâre scared and that youâre thinking I may go
Iâm not leaving, Iâm not leaving

And if youâre thinking I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

What if I was nothing? What if this is true?
What if I was nothing, girl, nothing without you
So what if I was angry, what did you think Iâd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, Iâm nothing without you

I know itâs hard, it seems that weâve worked at this so long
Soft and foolish pride that tells us weâre not wrong
I hear your voice, you tell me that youâll never go
And I believe it, I believe it.

And if youâre thinking I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

What if I was nothing? What if this is true?
What if I was nothing, girl, nothing without you
So what if I was angry, what did you think Iâd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, Iâm nothing without you

And we can keep this going on, weâll make it work some way
And every step, it makes us stronger every day

And if youâre thinking I might, might be lead astray
Just remember this one question

What if I was nothing? What if this is true?
What if I was nothing, girl, nothing without you
So what if I was angry, what did you think Iâd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, Iâm nothing without you

What if I was nothing? What if this is true?
What if I was nothing, girl, nothing without you
So what if I was angry, what did you think Iâd do?
I told you that I love you, girl, Iâm nothing without you.
