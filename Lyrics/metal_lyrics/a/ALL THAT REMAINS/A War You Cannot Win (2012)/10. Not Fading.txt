I know it's not so easy to knowÂ 
Just how far I can go without youÂ 
The time that you spent sleeping aloneÂ 
Wondering if I still know your waitingÂ 

And if you're lonely, wondering about meÂ 
Call out my name, I'll be there

If I am gone and you're alone, I still can feel youÂ 
It's not fading (fading), not fading, my heart's for youÂ 
It's all alone, you kept me strong, I still can feel youÂ 
It's not fading (fading), not fading, my heart's for youÂ 

In days when I don't want to go onÂ 
Feel I can't still be strong without youÂ 
Yet I can't think of anything lost
That I've worked for so long and found it

And if you're lonely, wondering about meÂ 
Call out my name, I'll be there

If I am gone and you're alone, I still can feel youÂ 
It's not fading (fading), not fading, my heart's for youÂ 
It's all alone, you kept me strong, I still can feel youÂ 
It's not fading (fading), not fading, my heart's for youÂ 

[Solo]

I can still feel you, it's not fadingÂ 
My heart is always with youÂ 
And if you're lonely, wondering about meÂ 
Call out my nameÂ 

If I am gone and you're alone, I still can feel youÂ 
It's not fading (fading), not fading, my heart's for youÂ 
It's all alone, you kept me strong, I still can feel youÂ 
It's not fading (fading), not fading, my heart's for youÂ
