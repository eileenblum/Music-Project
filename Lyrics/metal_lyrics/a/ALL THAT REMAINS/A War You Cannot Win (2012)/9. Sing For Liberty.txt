Usurping cowards
Dividing the nation
False use of power
Total domination

Unending fight
They use force to prove they're right
I cannot hide. I know that we must defy

Why can't we see it? They're trying to make a slave of you
Take back your freedom (Take it back, take it back)

I have such pride in the land I thought was mine
I can't deny and I fear my home has died

Why can't we see it? They're trying to make a slave of you
Take back your freedom (Take it back, take it back)
Why can't we see it? No one believes deep down it's true
Take back your freedom (Take it back, take it back)

Enslaving and binding while countrymen sleeping
Traitorous minions of dominance reaching
Cast out the fallen and all who would keep them

Take it back

Why can't we see it? They're trying to make a slave of you
Take back your freedom (Take it back, take it back)
Why can't we see it? No one believes deep down it's true
Take back your freedom (Take it back, take it back)

Bound with lies
Terrified

Why can't we see it? They're trying to make a slave of you
Take it back, take it back
