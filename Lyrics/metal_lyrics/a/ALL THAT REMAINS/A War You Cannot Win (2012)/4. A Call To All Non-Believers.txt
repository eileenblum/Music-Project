Dominate subjugation the end
Decimate destruction is the real trend
Fabricate enemies as your friends
Profligate worthless is life in the end

I know your false God
I've seen his works and his deeds
Your Angry False God
And violence is his creed
Â 
A call to all non-believers
This is a call
A call to stand up and fight
Stand, Fight
A call to all non-believers
This is a call
A call to stand for what's right
Â 
Demonstrate show just how backwards you are
Calculate all while you hid in plain sight
Perpetrate deception stealing of rights
Subjugate no longer hiding the fight
Â 
I know your false God
I've seen his works and his deeds
Your False God
And violence is his creed
Â 
A call to all non-believers
(A call to all non-believers)
A call to stand up and fight
Stand, Fight
A call to all non-believers
(A call to all non-believers)
A call to stand for what's right
Â 
You have their blood on your hands
Wash their blood from your hands
Don't leave their blood on your hands
Wash their blood from your hands
Â 
This is a call to all non-believers
This is a call to stand up and fight
