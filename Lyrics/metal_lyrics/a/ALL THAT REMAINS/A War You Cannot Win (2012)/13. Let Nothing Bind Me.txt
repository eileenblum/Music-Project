[Japanese Bonus Track]Let nothing bind me
Nor stand in my way
Struggle defines me
Adversity, my friend
I will not hide it
I'll fight till the end
I fall and rise up
On no one depend

I am my own master
I own my sovereignty
Your failure is no disaster
And I will push cause I'm free
And with constant effort
I'm growing stronger with time
Dedication, resolution
Endless cries fill my mind

I am my own master
I own my sovereignty
Your failure is no disaster
And I will push cause I'm free
Rise up!
Smash failure
Test yourself every day
Nothing can defeat you
If you never give in

Let nothing bind me
Nor stand in my way
Struggle defines me
Adversity, my friend
I will not hide it
I'll fight till the end
I fall and rise up
On no on depend

I am my own master
I'll fight till the end!
