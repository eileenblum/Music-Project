We've been deceived for so long, we stop believingÂ 
Can't tell what's right or what's wrongÂ 
So you stop feelingÂ 
when violence, and coercion. are their toolÂ 
Then you must stand screamÂ 
Â 
No, hell no. Won't follow commands I won't meetÂ 
your demands saidÂ 
No, hell no. I am not yours to rule I won't beÂ 
your fool causeÂ 
Â 
We are standing here waiting you'll listen to reasonÂ 
This is a war you cannot winÂ 
We are standing he waiting. And you're going to listenÂ 
This is a war you cannot winÂ 
Â 
Now I can see that it's all a fight for power.Â 
But there is no way we are wrong this is our hourÂ 
One voice can silence the massesÂ 
One voice just scream these words sayÂ 
Â 
No, hell no. Won't follow commands I won't meetÂ 
your demands saidÂ 
No, hell no. I am not yours to rule I won't beÂ 
your fool causeÂ 
Â 
We are standing here waiting you'll listen to reasonÂ 
This is a war you cannot winÂ 
We are standing he waiting. And you're going to listenÂ 
This is a war you cannot winÂ 
Â 
Just take a good look around you nowÂ 
You have to see there's no wayÂ 
You can't control what we feel, what we thinkÂ 
And we will not go away.Â 
Â 
No, hell no. Won't follow commands I won't meetÂ 
your demands saidÂ 
No, hell no. I am not yours to rule I won't beÂ 
your fool causeÂ 
Â 
We are standing here waiting you'll listen to reasonÂ 
This is a war you cannot winÂ 
We are standing he waiting. And you're going to listenÂ 
This is a war you cannot winÂ 
Â 
Won't follow commands I won't meet your demandsÂ 
(War you cannot win)Â 
We are standing here waitingÂ 
Won't follow commands I won't meet your demandsÂ 
(This is a war you cannot win)
