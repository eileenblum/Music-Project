I think I know you
I think I've seen you before
Don't think you know it
But I know that you're a joke

You're so impressed with all the filth that I abhor
You spineless coward
You know you're worthless
You whore

I want the world to know how spineless and fearful you are
Want all your loved ones to be there just to see you fall
I hope that I can be the reason you wear your scars
I want the world to know how spineless and fearful you are

I think you know this
I think it eats you inside
I bet your nightmares are better than your real life

You point the finger but when I look in your eyes
I see you weakness and know your life's a life

I want the world to know how spineless and fearful you are
Want all your loved ones to be there just to see you fall
I hope that I can be the reason you wear your scars
I want the world to know how spineless and fearful you are

You will never fill my shadow
No, you can't fill my shadow
You will never fill my shadow
You will never fill my shadow
No, you'll never
No, you'll never
No, you can't fill my shadow
No, you'll never
No, you'll never

You'll try to fill my shadow
No, you'll never
No, you'll never

Boy, you can't fill my shadow
No, you'll never
No, you'll never

Boy, you can't fill my shadow
No, you can't fill my shadow
You will never fill my shadow
No, you'll never
No, you'll never
