Give me strength to retain what my fathers bought
Hold no scars on their memory
No regret for the truth they had founded
Never more this tragedy
Forsaken few, they're left with nothing
No longer hold them down
Hands once tied now empower my enemy
A common thread that oppression believes
The grand design ends in tyranny
The cost of safety's paid when no one is free
Forsaken few, they're left with nothing
No longer hold them down
Believe this truth we're wrong to trust them
No longer hold them down

It's come down through the ages
Don't let it fall away
Don't let it fall away
This gift down through the ages
Don't let it fall away
Don't let it fall away
Our greatness is our proof
They know these words are true
Believe this truth, we're wrong to trust them
No longer hold them down
It's come down through the ages
Don't let it fall away
Don't let it fall away
This gift down through the ages
Don't let it fall away
Don't let it fall away
