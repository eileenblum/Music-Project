I wish I was free of this
I see her in my dreams
Wish that she wasn't there
But she still haunts me and I

Still feel her breath on me
Still want to taste her skin
But I know that would kill me

No damn her, still I choke on her lies
Still reeling from her last caress her good-bye
Oh how this sickens me
This wretched fools affair
I can't erase this from me

And now it permeates
And every thought I feel
The anger writhes in my soul

No damn her still I feel my skin turn
Choke back hold my head high I'm strong
No damn her still I choke on her lies

Not reeling I'm strong
