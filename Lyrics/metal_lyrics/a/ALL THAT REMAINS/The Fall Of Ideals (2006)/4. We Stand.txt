As if this could change us
Our roots are deeper than that

Born and bred the masters of
Ourselves
And of our hearts

Take the best of me and
Watch my world fall apart
Still I remain steadfast in my heart

Walk a darkened road and
We will be our own light
Our foundation our core is strong
Stand for what's right

[Chorus:]
We stand again, it breaks my heart
The anger burns, and I fall apart

Seasons change me
But they won't change my core
I have struggled and fought for less
Still this I know

Belief within my self
Shall drive me further on
Still I fear that that past remains
And so shall I

[Spoken:]
Still I fear that that past remains
And so shall I-

[Chorus]

As if this could change us
Our roots are deeper than that

[Chorus]
