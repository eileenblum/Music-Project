No more
No more are the days that I will
Fear for I have found a strength that
None can match and I'll push forward

Never has the blood in my veins
Flowed so fiercely as when I feel this around me
I am whole

[Chorus:]
I'm not alone with the touch of your hand I am whole again
I'm not alone with the touch of your hand I am whole again

Now I feel the passion burning
This what drives me further
Strengthens my resolve to push me further

[Spoken:] AND I BELIEVE I, THAT I AM NOT ALONE

[Chorus]

Give me hot steel, go

[Solo]

No more are the days that I will
Fear for I have found a strength that
None can match and I'll push further

Now I feel the passion burning
This what drives me further
Strengthens my resolve to push me further

[Chorus]
