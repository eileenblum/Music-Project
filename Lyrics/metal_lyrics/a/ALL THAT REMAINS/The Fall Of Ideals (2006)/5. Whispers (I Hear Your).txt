It may seem at last day passing mean nothing
But the sun that set cause only pain
Violence in words like slashes wound deeply
Love is not when you feel only pain

Her touch poison flows through my veins
No more I denounce all your childish games

[Chorus:]
Whispers (I hear you)
Poison (flows in me)
Lost inside of you, I'm not free of you
Break my bonds again

Love lost arrogant whore paint strife on this canvas
Failure I am a fool I should have seen
Whispers poison break my bonds again
Love lost failure I should have seen

[Chorus]

It may seem at last day passing mean nothing
But the sun that set cause only pain
Violence in words like slashes wound deeply
Love is not when you feel only pain

No more regrets
Face my fear alone
