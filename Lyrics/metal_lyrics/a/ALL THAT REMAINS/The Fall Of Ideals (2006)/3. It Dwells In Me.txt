Now hold this tight don't let go
No burden
I can't forget the past is real
No longer fight this feeling
No burden
I can't erase what you've become this time

[Chorus:]
I cast doubt no longer
I am able I am strong
And now it dwells in me

True to this cause I hunger
I count the days that pass me by
I'll do what I know is right
No failure shall befall me this time

[Chorus]

[Solo]

I cast doubt aside

[Chorus]

I'm strong and it dwells in me
