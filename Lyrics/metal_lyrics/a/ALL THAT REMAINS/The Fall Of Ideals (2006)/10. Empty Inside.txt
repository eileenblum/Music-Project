I can't show pain long for the days
When I am free to feel
I don't wan to lose everything
Just want to feel again
My heart would burst from you
If that would make things right

I don't feel anything
Outside the pain you bring
Starting over doesn't look so bad this time

I am not empty inside
Though I long to make this right
Emotions still touch me
Still I can't feel a thing
Like ghosts that melt into fog
And leave me cold

Only shadows and impressions
Are left for me to hold
My heart would burst for you if
That would make you whole

Six string slaughter

[Solo]

I am not empty inside
Though I long to make this right
