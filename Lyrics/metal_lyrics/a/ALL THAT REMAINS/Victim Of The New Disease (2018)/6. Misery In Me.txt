So don't ask me how I've been
'Cause I'll never be the same again
And I won't play your stupid game this time
Because it's all pretend

You are chaos in disguise
I knew better than to call a friend
How could I have been so blind
How could I have let you in

Too late I find
That it's not my state of mind
I've been bled dry
Too late I find
That it won't just take some time
I've been

I believed in the misery in me
And it cost me all of my dreams
I believed in the misery in me
Left me shattered, left me incomplete

Now I see through that disguise
It couldn't end another way
Everything that you despise
Was hidden in every word you'd say

I have given up that life
I wish it didn't end this way
How could I have been so blind
How could I have let you in

Too late I find
That it's not my state of mind
I've been bled dry
Too late I find
That it won't just take some time
I've been

I believed in the misery in me
And it cost me all of my dreams
I believed in the misery in me
Left me shattered, left me incomplete

I believed in the misery in me
And it cost me all of my dreams
I believed in the misery in me
Left me shattered, left me incomplete
