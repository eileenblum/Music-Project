I'm not buying it
No, not a word that you say
I'm not trying it
Not gonna make that mistake

'Cause you're screaming at me
To believe in your dreams
But I won't 'cause it's bodies
That they're built on

Wasteland
Your kingdom of misery
Shackles all around
Like asking for tyranny, tyranny

I'm not lying when
I say your rage is a joke
I'm not tying it
But I would sell you the rope

Won't account for the doubt
That's not what it's about
Still I won't 'cause it's bodies
That they're built on

Wasteland
Your kingdom of misery
Shackles all around
Like asking for tyranny, tyranny

A hundred million dead prove you're wrong
They're screaming

A hundred million dead prove you're wrong
They're screaming

Wasteland
Your kingdom of misery
Shackles all around
Like asking for tyranny, tyranny

A hundred million dead

A hundred million dead

A hundred million dead prove you're wrong
They're screaming
