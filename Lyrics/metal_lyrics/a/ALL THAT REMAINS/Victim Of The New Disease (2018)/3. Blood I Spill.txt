1, 2 , 3, go!

Make me your scarlet whore
Just make me your fiend
I'll be your bastard son
I'll be your unclean

I won't deny I'm everything that you hate
The lie is what's remembered anyway

I see things in a new light
And just when it feels right
I will tear down all you've built

See things in a new light
Just when it feels right
I won't cry for the blood I spill

Won't disappoint
I'm every demon you seek
And, yes, my silver tongue
Will prey on the weak

So hide your children
Tell them not of my sins
As I said
The ugly truth is
I'm what you might have been

I see things in a new light
And just when it feels right
I will tear down all you've built

See things in a new light
Just when it feels right
I won't cry for the blood Iâ
Cry for the blood I spill

I'm what hides in the dark
I'm what grips at your heart

Make me your scarlet whore
Just make me your fiend
I'll be your bastard son
I'll be your unclean

So hide your children
Tell them not of my sins
As I said
The ugly truth is
I'm what you might have been

I see things in a new light
And just when it feels right
I will tear down all you've built

See things in a new light
Just when it feels right
I won't cry for the blood Iâ

I see things in a new light
And just when it feels right
I will tear down all you've built

See things in a new light
Just when it feels right
I won't cry for the blood I spill

I'm what hides in the dark
I'm what grips at your heart

I'm what hides in the dark
I'm what grips at your heart
