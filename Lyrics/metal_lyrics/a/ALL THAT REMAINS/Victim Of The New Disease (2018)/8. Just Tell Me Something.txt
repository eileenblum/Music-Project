[feat. Danny Worsnop of Asking Alexandria]I can't help feeling like I've read this book before
the same old story anyway
Flooded memories of how I opened that door
I guess I'm easy to betray

Not 'cause it feels right
Not 'cause it's for today
I don't need just halfway

Done with the game now
No more turning away
Someone please

Just tell me something
Something that's true
I've wasted too much time
On just passing through
No more sad goodbyes
Not just for a few
I'm waiting for something
Something that's true

I'm waiting, I'm waiting
I'm waiting for something that's true

'Cause that November was the last thing on my mind
I guess it's easier that way (anyway)
Things seem in order then you realize you're blind
It falls apart then anyway

Not 'cause it feels right
Not 'cause it's for today
I don't need just halfway

Done with the game now
No more turning away
Someone please

Just tell me something
Something that's true
I've wasted too much time
On just passing through
No more sad goodbyes
Not just for a few
I'm waiting for something
Something that's true

It's so much easier to keep the good ones out
Than to risk the bad ones getting in

Just tell me something
Something that's true
I've wasted too much time
On just passing through
No more sad goodbyes
Not just for a few
I'm waiting for something
Something that's true

I'm waiting

Just tell me something

I'm waiting for something that's true

No more sad goodbyes
Not just for a few
Just tell me something
Something that's true
