I'd sell my soul to take my words back again
They fell on a cold empty heartless stare
An aching I could not contain
It left me alone in the

Darkness pulling me apart at the seams
Like every breath is taken I see
Now what I didn't want to believe
I wish I didn't hope now that she's
Alone in the darkness like me
Alone in the darkness like me

One last chance
I poured my heart out again
On pages that turned into ashes
Float could never erase this stain
The marks that were left in the

Darkness pulling me apart at the seams
Like every breath is taken I see
Now what I didn't want to believe
I wish I didn't hope now that she's
Alone in the darkness like me
Alone in the darkness like me
Alone in the darkness

Darkness pulling me apart at the seams
Like every breath is taken I see
Now what I didn't want to believe
I wish I didn't hope now that she's
Alone in the darkness like me
Alone in the darkness like me
Alone in the darkness like me
