I'm stronger than yesterday

It's so damn hard to forget
To accept
The truth be told
I'm sinking in regret
As worlds collide
A simple lie
Can change
The hope of yesterday

I meant what I said
Don't believe that it ever mattered
I meant what I said
Now it seems everything's been shattered
I kept coming back for more

Disarray
Thoughts betray
It gives new meaning
To digging my own grave
You disguised
I realized
Too late
I'm stronger than yesterday

I meant what I said
Don't believe that it ever mattered
I meant what I said
Now it seems everything's been shattered
I kept coming back for more

I meant what I said
Why did I have to be so trusting
I meant what I said
Should've known that you'd keep on running
I kept coming back for more

I meant what I said
Don't believe that it ever mattered
I meant what I said
Now it seems everything's been shattered
I kept coming back for more

I meant what I said
Why did I have to be so trusting
I meant what I said
Should have known that you'd keep on running
I kept coming back for more

I meant what I said
Don't believe that it ever mattered
I meant what I said
Now it seems everything's been shattered
I kept coming back for more
