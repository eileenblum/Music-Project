[solo: Martin]

and death lay in my arms as colors fade
from gold to gray

gray now broken my foolishness displayed
hands tight around her throat this violent loving embrace

lying restful safe in my arms
steady rhythm trust she'll come to no harm
feel her tremble as the nightmare begins
sleep the horror as the nightmare it ends

I hear her whisper a sweet sound fanning the flames
these thoughts consume me and leave me wallowing

gray now broken my foolishness displayed
hands tight around her throat this violent loving embrace
my fingers tremble her lips move silently
one last i love you crush my resolve again
