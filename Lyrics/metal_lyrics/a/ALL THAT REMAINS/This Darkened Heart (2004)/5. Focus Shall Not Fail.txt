I find not distractions live life of single mind
and failure is not inherent for I will have what's mine
I'll struggle and sacrifice should I find value there
I'll not be scorned by failure
I'll not relent

now my conscience shall dictate my way
no more apologies no more mistakes
now solid direction has strengthened my resolve
fear not for consequences

fear not at all my focus shall not fail
I shall not fall and nor shall I despair

exist no more distractions exist no more delays
set free from inhibitions set solid on my way
now set forth with purpose and with a strong resolve
fear not for consequences
