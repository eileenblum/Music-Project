[Solo: Herbert]

I'd follow endlessly to live the life I've seen
now every passing moment I die but one degree

shall I relinquish my integrity
thereby ensuring that I'll remain unclean

Until my days filled with not untrust and fear
I'll not make one vow to which I won't adhere

I didn't want it this way but I've never wanted to stay
my life take not for granted yet nothings changed in me
the search for true perfection will lead me endlessly
