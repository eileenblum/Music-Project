[Solo: Herbert]

every word that falls from my lips falls on deaf ears and I suffocate
now righteousness cast aside thrown to the ground
I close my eyes and I see you there
but my eyes deceive me every other sense says I'm alone
now waking hours melt to sleepness nights and all fear has left me
if I could learn from my past
I'd posess the strength to walk away let your sweet taste fall from my lips
but it resonates
and now I hold this so dear to let it fade would tear me apart
if I now left this all behind simply turned and walked away
would the dawns light fall upon my face to end this tragedy
still deep in the long black behind the shimmering blue
I'd swear that I have seen the last soul that I care to
so this is passion and it crawls upon my skin
and it sinks into my bones and I am whole again
and I feel it filling me and I pray it will never end
now it burns within my veins
and I am writing in ecstasy
