[Solo: Herbert]

wallow in darkness
and ever lasting pain
this signals defiance
to bring forth mankind's gain
this nations compliance
to what is fed to them
may lead to disaster
unless a change is made

I will not be swept aside
nor will I change inside
but I'll fear not compromise
to benefit mankind

now pride is our enemy
for salvation this we must believe
