[Solo: Herbert]

and how I love you I should let you go
strike your name from my mind
should I succeed empty space
filled with might have been

wronged and I foul
never cared for might have been

your name etched upon my finger
under gold still lives in my dreams
to this day have I fallen away

now my heart tattered on my sleeve and I
hear your breath lying next to me
now my heart tattered
on my sleeve will I see
your name before mine

I am falling away
all my life
is falling away
as time goes by
