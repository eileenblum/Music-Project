I've watched the days pass
one by one until the fall of man
and seen the cynics feed the jaded
merely scraps and bones
the kingdom shaken
it's foundation nearly turned to sand
with foolish faith in faulted leaders
that I must disown

Now rise again
This darkened heart betrays what I've always held so dear
now rise again 
This darkened heart it bleeds fast for all my family
Now rise again 
This darkened heart it bleeds fast for all humanity
now rise again
This darkened heart condemns my soul

I've laid to rest the false belief
of average stock in me
I'll not relent no average destiny
I'll reach the point where mankind's sins
no longer rest in me
A long hard road this manifest destiny

Now rise again
This darkened heart betrays what I've always held so dear
now rise again 
This darkened heart it bleeds fast for all my family
Now rise again 
This darkened heart it bleeds fast for all humanity
now rise again
This darkened heart condemns my soul

I will not be held down again!!
