Past it haunts again
The dream's alive
And forms the nightmare that has no end
Foreshadow all tomorrows
So this day to day has my core shaken
Still I raise my spirits high
I am above this

I should never have thought that
This would never end
The moment we started
Old wounds you could not mend

Five ended today
Six since the four time take away
My dreams have fallen
No more to share
Now the end remains
MY one regret like black and stained
And spring again
I fall from grace

I should never have thought that
This would never end
The moment we started
Old wounds you could not mend

I should never have thought that
This would never end
The fear was too much for us to battle
So this day to day has my core shaken
Still I raise my spirits high
I am above this

I should never have thought that
This would never end
The moment we started
Old wounds you could not mend

I should never have thought that
This would never end
The fear was too much for us to battle
