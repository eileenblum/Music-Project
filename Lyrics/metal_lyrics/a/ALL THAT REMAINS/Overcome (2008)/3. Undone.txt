Well hot damn!!

It's hard to tame the passion
That leads me here
No better choice no stronger voice
I'll sacrifice not fear

I've pushed through hesitation
I've seen through doubt
I'm better now within her eyes
Than I'll ever be without

We can push through
We are one in this
We are not undone

I know my limitations
I've learned from life
This great reward I'm honor bound
Not sacrifice not price

I've found my inspiration
Held in both hands
I'm fully whole in trust and care
I'm stronger
