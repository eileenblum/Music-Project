[Nevermore Cover]

Into a strange new world, into the after
All your tears might find you've fallen too far
Take another look, take another ride
Can't we make them leave the hate behind

And I still believe in nothing
Will we ever see the shape of tomorrow?

Into the empty storm, into the formless loss of hope,
Where we can forget the game

And I still believe in nothing
Will we ever see the cure for our sorrow

Nothing is sacred when no one is saved
Nothing's forever so count your days
Nothing is final and no one is real
Pray for tomorrow and find your empty still

Nothing
