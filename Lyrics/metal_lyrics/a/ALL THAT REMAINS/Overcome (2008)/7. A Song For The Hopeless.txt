The day has ended
I lay awake
A soft glow over my shoulder
I'll sleep soon
Wake tomorrow and then it's all the same

And I'll destroy the memories one by one
The bitter past erased
I'll not replace
What's done is done

No belief is all that's left  and I do not regret
The darkness welcomes me back home

And I am still my own
Can't take away

And I feel the pain still deeply
It seems sometimes too much to bear
I have a core within me still
My strength is there

And I am still my own
And I can't be made less
I know who I am
