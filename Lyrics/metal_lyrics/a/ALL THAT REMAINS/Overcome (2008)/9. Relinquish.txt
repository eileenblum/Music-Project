Still push harder and still the facts remains
Just one to an open end so quickly
A simple step now a small matter of time
lest not regret now I'll make you push the line

Follow the lead to failure
relinquish and pay no mind

Misplace my judgement misstep the card house falls
That will not be my legacy
This whole creation we've built through effort and time
We make this happen we hold together with pride
