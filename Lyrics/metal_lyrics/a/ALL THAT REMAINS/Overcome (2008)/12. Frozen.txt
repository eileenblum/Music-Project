[Japanese bonus tracks]

I wither,
this hotel room,
can't cover it still seeps in
it still fills me just like the thought of you
and so I don't want this fucking disaster
I hold my head I will see this through

On and I've seen it
You'll never seek this through
I'm not blunt
I'm not proud
But I've always been true

Fear it creeps in don't pull me under
It leaves my voice quivering the silver tongue
It tastes the same
Keep hold I'm not broken
His wings are slashed, dreams and heart

I am not what you think I am
You are not who I thought you were
I am not what you think I am
You are not who I thought you were

On and I've seen it
You'll never seek this through
I'm not blunt
I'm not proud
But I've always been true
On and I've seen it
You'll never seek this through
I'm not _
I'm not proud
But I've always been true

[Solo]

On and I've seen it
You'll never seek this through
I'm not blunt
I'm not proud
But I've always been true
On and on I've seen it
You'll never seek this through
I'm not blunt
I'm not proud
But I've always been true...true...true...true...
