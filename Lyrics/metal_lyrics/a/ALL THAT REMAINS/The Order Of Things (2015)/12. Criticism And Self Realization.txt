One by one, they stand single file
To see the king of the hill atop his worthless pile
The king has no clothes
Throw stones
Watch him implode
All for one or are we all alone
Brick by brick, it's a house built on lies
Because illusion is easy to young adoring eyes
It's not hard to see
Through deceit
Make them believe
Fight the stampede, be the one to lead
All my missteps, I retrace
Every failure, I'll erase
My pride is gone
I find the strength to carry on
Looking back, what's left of me
Am I the person that I wanna be
Do I belong
I find the strength to carry on
Rung by rung, he's climbed up to the top
But once the engine is running, it's hard to make it stop
Ignore what you're told
Eyes closed
Dig from below
Don't care where you're from, just where you go
Step by step, we're ignoring the signs
That cocky bastard is planting the seeds of his demise
There's nothing to gain
Only shame
We fan the flames
Fight through the pain, live another day
Just one more day
All my missteps, I retrace
Every failure, I'll erase
My pride is gone
I find the strength to carry on
Looking back, what's left of me
Am I the person that I wanna be
Do I belong
Do I belong
Writing's on the wall
That Cheshire smile says you don't have the courage to take the fall
You're not fooling anyone
You're no one
All my missteps, I retrace
Every failure, I'll erase
My pride is gone
I find the strength to carry on
Looking back, what's left of me
Am I the person that I wanna be
Do I belong
Do I belong
