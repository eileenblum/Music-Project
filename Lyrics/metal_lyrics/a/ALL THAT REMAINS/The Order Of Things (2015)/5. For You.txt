Your plane is boarding, got to cross the ocean all alone
My heart is stone
You need to figure out the things that plague you here at home
I'll carry on
Sometimes, it's one thing
And next time, it's nothing
It's more than mistrusting
It ends up just crushing me
Stop with the fighting
I know it's the right thing
I won't let you do this
We have to get through this
So, say something, I'm not holding back
Before the scene we made goes and fades to black
Cause I can't wait while you think this through
We don't have endless time, remember who left who
Cause I won't wait, won't wait for you
Your lifeless eyes don't hold the
Same desire anymore, I can't ignore
So long I've wondered, but I think now I know
You're not coming home
Sometimes, it's one thing
And next time, it's nothing
It's more than mistrusting
It ends up just crushing me
Stop with the fighting
I know it's the right thing
I won't let you do this
We have to get through this
So, say something, I'm not holding back
Before the scene we made goes and fades to black
Cause I can't wait while you think this through
We don't have endless time, remember who left who
Cause I won't wait, won't wait for you
Put my heart in your hands
Committed my whole life to you
And all you had to say
See you in a few days
But days turn into months
This isn't what you promised me
I've gotta let you go
Or just find another way
So, say something, I'm not holding back
(I needed time to work it out alone)
