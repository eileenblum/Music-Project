I lead the motorcade, I'll take the heat and I'll blaze the way
They'll bury me alone
This could be suicide, a one way ride to the god damn grave
They'll bury me alone

You best be ready for anything, and keep your eyes on the road
You best be ready for anything, it's a long way home

I'm fucking superman, so come on over and check my plan
We'll tear that whole place down
They'll get what they deserve, we do it right and we won't be heard
We'll get in just like ghosts

You best be ready kid, âcause once we're done they'll come real damn quick
And we ain't innocent, no, we ain't innocent

Bust through like a battering ram, flash bang first gives us the upper hand
Room by room, we're death incarnate tonight, take them while they're sleeping, they won't put up a fight

It's fuckinâ easy, see, we blow the front door on one, two, three
Kill everyone inside
We'll stack the bodies high and when the smoke clears, we'll all just smile
And everyone goes home

You best be ready for anything, so grab your gear and letâs go
You best be ready for anything, so enjoy the show

Bust through like a battering ram, flash bang first gives us the upper hand
Room by room, we're death incarnate tonight, take them while they're sleeping, they won't put up a fight
