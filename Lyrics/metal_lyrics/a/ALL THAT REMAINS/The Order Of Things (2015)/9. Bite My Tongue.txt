Thought you were invincible, thought you were bulletproof
There's no use talking sense to you, in love with your abuse
Your actions speaking for your mouth, there's not much to defend
Paint yourself into a corner, staring at the end
Never one to bite my tongue, nothing's left, I've given all I've got
I'm at the wall, disintegrating
Apologies are empty words, I know you're only sorry you got caught
You're at the wall, disintegrating
Left your life in ruins, you've burned every bridge you had
You beg me just to hear you out and try to make amends
Too late now, I've heard that line, poor me, I've got it bad
Try to hold onto your life, it's slipping through your hands
Never one to bite my tongue, nothing's left, I've given all I've got
I'm at the wall, disintegrating
Apologies are empty words, I know you're only sorry you got caught
You're at the wall, disintegrating
Look yourself in the mirror, you created the problem
All your aspirations, disintegrating
So, go drown in the bottle, it's a race to the bottom
I'm not gonna watch you disintegrate alone
You're on your own, no more putting up with you, you're on your own
