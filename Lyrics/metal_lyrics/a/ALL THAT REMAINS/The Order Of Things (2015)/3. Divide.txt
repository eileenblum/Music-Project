Another sleepless night, another day just washed away
So you count your scars, hoping for a new day
I know you have the strength to pull through
The lengths I've seen you go to
So, break away and look for something new
It's so far away, yeah
Divide yourself from what you used to be
Gather your integrity
It's not a loss
You count the people you can trust
Divide, and show the world what strength can be
Live your life in honesty
It's not a loss
You count the people you can trust, divide
You've made your mind up right
But you're the one thing in your way
So, come on, cross that line, or this will never go away
I know you have the strength to pull through
The lengths I've seen you go to
So, break away and look for something new
It's not far away, yeah
Divide yourself from what you used to be
Gather your integrity
It's not a loss
You count the people you can trust
Divide, and show the world what strength can be
Live your life in honesty
It's not a loss
You count the people you can trust, divide
Another setback, another let down
I see you're on the verge of changing things tonight
So, no excuses, so, stop holding yourself back
You're wasting life, just let go and
Divide yourself from what you used to be
Gather your integrity
It's not a loss
You count the people you can trust
