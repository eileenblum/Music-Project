I'm wise enough to know
These promises pernicious
The fruit of what was sewn
And still I'm reeling
Mistrust forever more
The wake you left is vicious
Your hate can't help but show
And still I'm reeling
Done throwing coins in a wishing well
Break walls
That you have built yourself
I'm done with all the lies you speak
No more
Won't turn the other cheek
How could I have ever thought it'd be worth it
You're falling farther, and farther, and farther, and farther apart
How is it you don't know
I'm wise enough to know
These promises pernicious
The fruit of what was sewn
And still I'm reeling
Mistrust forever more
The wake you left is vicious
Your hate can't help but show
And still I'm reeling
I'm growing tired, you manipulate
Your, words
They further aggravate
I drew the line, now will you make a move
Weakness
That's what's inside of you
I am still warm from transgression, aggression
I still feel the sting, can't help but question
And suffer the wrath of conditions created by you
