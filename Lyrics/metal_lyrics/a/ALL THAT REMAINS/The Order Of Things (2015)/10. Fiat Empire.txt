I never asked for more than just what I have
Now, what more can I do with that
I see this fall to come, it's crashing all around
No, I don't think that there's time to waste
The last time was simply a little taste
Now, I think it's just a matter of time
Wide awake, we step to the fall point
Never had thought I'd see this
Why, why, empire cannot last forever
Why, why, the best laid plans can all be cast aside
Why, empire cannot last forever
Why, why, the best laid plans can all be cast aside
Just because we all had our part to play
Doesn't guarantee us just one more day
We've seen the cost before, it's far too much to pay
Desperate times require desperate measures now
Ask a free man and he'll show you how
Our fathers paved the way for us to lash out
Wide awake, we step to the fall point
Never had thought I'd see this
Why, why, empire cannot last forever
Why, why, the best laid plans can all be cast aside
Keynesianism, live the lie
Trapped in this prison, destroying lives
