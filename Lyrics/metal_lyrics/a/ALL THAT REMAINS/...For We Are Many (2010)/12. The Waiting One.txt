I am the waiting one it seems
Days grow somber quickly
Now how the quiet is release
And I feel so lonely

How did you think I would feel
Throw me aside again
How did you think I would feel
I won't let you hurt me again

Now I'm nothing to you I can't see
Just walk away from me
I'm torn apart I can't believe
You'd stand and watch me bleed

She was the one thing I believed
That I needed to hold me
Still I can smell her hear her breath
Feel her body beside me

How long I've waited, waited for you
To come back to hold me
What should I do
When I feel so lonely

How could you do this to me
Betrayed by my closest friend
How could you do this to me
I won't let you hurt me again

Now I'm nothing to you I can see
Just walk away from me
I'm torn apart I can't believe
You'd stand and watch me bleed

What should I do?
Oh how long I have waited
What can I do
When I feel so lonely

How did you think I would feel
You throw me aside again
How did you think I would feel
I won't let you hurt me again

Now I'm nothing to you I can see
Just walk away from me
I'm torn apart I can't believe
You'd stand and watch me bleed

How could you do this to me
Betrayed by my closest friend
How could you do this to me
I won't let you hurt me again
