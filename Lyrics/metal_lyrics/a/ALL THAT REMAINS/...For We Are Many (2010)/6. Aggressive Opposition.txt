Let us defy

Unite my friends defy
Heed failure's lesson
And shape our future
Make us transformed

Revolt and smash the shackles
The crisis brings us together
Let us defy

No more deception
There's no safety lest you make your own way

Our dreams are what we are inside
And when we close our eyes
We see our future

Their plan will lead you to failure
Embrace this wisdom let this wash away
And knowledge drives our choices
If we posses we sustain

No more deception, you must make your own way

Our dreams are what we are inside
And when we close our eyes
We see our future

No longer will we compromise
Our fate is not defined
By right we choose it

Oh now we're jaded can we come back to one
And find our way without giving up our hearts

Our dreams are what we are inside
And when we close our eyes
We see our future

No longer will we compromise
Our fate is not defined
By right we choose it

Our dreams, our future
(Let us defy, let us defy)
