As the days pass and replaced by memories
What do you see

How could this be, that I feel nothing
For what's made you the man that you see

What do you think, when you look at me
Do the pictures make you believe?

From the outside, stand and judge like enemies
Opened eyes see reality
Trying all the while to knock me down this tragedy
And the days turn to memories

I can't believe, how shallow and how dismissive
When I look I know I see me
No longer see what makes me different
When the difference is all that we see

From the outside, stand and judge like enemies
Opened eyes see reality
Trying all the while to knock me down this tragedy
And the days turn to memories

How could this be that I feel nothing

I'm nothing, wasting but now I realize I can release this
The truth is, the truth is when I let go, I no longer face this

From the outside, stand and judge like enemies
Opened eyes see reality
Trying all the while to know me down this tragedy
And the days turn to memories
