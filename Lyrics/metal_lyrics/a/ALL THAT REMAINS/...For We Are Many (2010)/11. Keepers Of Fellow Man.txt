Let it be know that this has gone on for far too long
And we can take no more

Through the years I have come to realize
That the truth is often right before our eyes
We are aware and know the hearts of fellow man
So let us act as such and help our brothers to stand

And now we offer this small bit of wisdom
The heart it came from will set you on your way

Ignorance will crush us, destroy all that we have
So let us rejoice that, the powers in our hands
To shape us and make us keepers of fellow man
So let us rejoice that the powers in our hands

Let us find strength in our neighbors' hands

We are not creatures made to be alone
And when we act as such we help our brothers to stand

And now we offer this small bit of wisdom
The heart it came from will set you on your way
And now I ask you to take heed of my words
To move with purpose to a future worth living

Ignorance will crush us, destroy all that we have
So let us rejoice that, the powers in our hands
To shape us and make us keepers of fellow man
So let us rejoice that the powers in our hands

It is time to address the fact that alone
None of us can survive
