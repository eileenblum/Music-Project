With all our hopes and dreams answered
Are we not lost
With nothing driving us forward
We count the cost
How can we not believe in ourselves
We let our lives fade away

[Chorus:]
Still we're far, we're far from faithless
And we trust to get us on
We still believe that, We still believe that we belong
Still we long, we long for days when
We can trust we are not wrong
We still believe that, We still believe that we belong

Stay strong and let honor guide you
This can't be wrong
Make no mistake you're family now
This is our call
Let the hopeless
Let them be renewed
Let weakness fall

[Chorus]

How can we not believe in ourselves
Don't let our lives fade away
Let hope be renewed
Let weakness fade

[Chorus]

We
Still believe
We still believe
