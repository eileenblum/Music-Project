Hands tied, force fed, truth lies twisting form
Diversion, covert, discrete, conquered from within
Disown, failure, no recourse, disavow the structure

How could they not know, not see
Now broken promise this legacy
Intent to save, consuming everything before us
Deceived

No remorse, no shame, for the failure
Sold out country, greased palms, for special treatment
Populate the weak mind

When all seems lost we count the cost
We still remain connected
We'll be made strong we are not wrong
We will not be neglected

Utopia false destiny, now propaganda the lies deceive
When all is given the structure will be torn asunder and fall

When all seems lost we count the cost
We still remain connected
We'll be made strong we are not wrong
We will not be neglected

Now take this doubt and cast it out
Weakness will be rejected
And through all wrongs we much stay strong
We will not be neglected

Stop society's decay
We must create
Prevail
