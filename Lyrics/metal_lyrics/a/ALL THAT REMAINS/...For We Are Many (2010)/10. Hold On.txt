[1st Verse]
Don't touch me, I don't wanna feel your skin.
I know that you're only gonna hurt me.
I hear you, I don't wanna do it again,
'Cause we both know this is not a passing trait!

All along a failure to connect and to compromise.
Right or wrong, its easy to react.
Time to realize.

(No more!)

[Chorus:]
And you keep talking but we both know it's not true.
I still know that you're wrong.
And no matter what we both had to go through,
I just can't, I can't hold on.

I can't hold on!

(We cannot waste our lives this way.)

[2nd Verse]
How far we've fallen in the road before us, leaves apart.

[Chorus:]
And you keep talking but we both know it's not true.
I still know (I still know) that you're wrong (you're wrong).
And no matter what we both had to go through,
I just can't, I can't hold on.

And when you asked if I believed, and I told you,
Strains of it (strains of it) made me strong (me strong).
But I can't feel a thing that I used to,
And I can't, I can't hold on.

(Come get some!)

[Guitar Solo]

Help is nothing more to take,
God will strike his guilty way,
We came so far now runs away.
Help is nothing more... to take.

[Chorus:]
And you keep talking but we both know it's not true.
I still know (I still know) that you're wrong (you're wrong).
And no matter what we both had to go through.
I just can't, I can't hold on (I can't hold on).
And when you asked if I believed, and I told you,
Strains of it (strains of it) made me strong (no one let me down).
But I can't feel a thing that I used to,
And I can't, I can't hold on.
