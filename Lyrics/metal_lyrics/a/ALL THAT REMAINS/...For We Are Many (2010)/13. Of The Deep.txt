[US iTunes Pre-Order / International Bonus Track]No more chance
Bear your souls
Bite the flesh
Scrap by scrap
I will seek and bear forth (bear forth)
Repel the spring
Infect the rest of them
Beware the eastern sun comes (get them!)
Turn about and face
The life or death
Oh!
Though the siren blazes
Came back for the reward
Beleaguered will not consume me
Bring your torch
Living your darkness
The last rejoice
Beleaguered will not consume me
Rise up and contort
Contort!
In the fields of the deep (of the deep)
Bite the flesh
The earth is strong
Though the siren blazes
Came back for the reward
Beleaguered will not consume me
Bring your torch
Living your darkness
The last rejoice
Beleaguered will not consume me
Rise up and contort
(contort! yeah!)
Let the darkness cover me
I'm done to fix these scars
Let the darkness cover me
Caution let it die
Though the siren blazes
Came back for the reward
Beleaguered will not consume me
Bring your torch
Living your darkness
The last rejoice
Yeah!
Beleaguered will not consume me
Rise up and contort
