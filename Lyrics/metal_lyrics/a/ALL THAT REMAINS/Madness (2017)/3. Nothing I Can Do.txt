Don't waste this temptation
Caress this last portation
Consuming, you soothe me
Your vial moves right through me
You made me look good, doesn't get any better
You're going out then let's go out together

No, there's nothing I can do
No, there's nothing I can do to make you stay
No, there's nothing I can do
But I came here anyway
No, there's nothing I can do
No, there's nothing I can do to make you stay
No, there's nothing I can do
But I came here anyway

You thought you were even
But no one ever leaves me
You came back to taste me
Lost in their hunger lately
If you need me right now then they need a future
I'll let you use me if you be my user

No, there's nothing I can do
No, there's nothing I can do to make you stay
No, there's nothing I can do
But I came here anyway
No, there's nothing I can do
No, there's nothing I can do to make you stay
No, there's nothing I can do
But I came here anyway

But I came here anyway
But I came here anyway

No, there's nothing I can do
No, there's nothing I can do to make you stay
No, there's nothing I can do
But I came here anyway
No, there's nothing I can do
No, there's nothing I can do to make you stay
No, there's nothing I can do
But I came here anyway
