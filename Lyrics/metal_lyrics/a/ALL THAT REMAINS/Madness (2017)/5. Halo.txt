There is no judgement day 
No jury to abide
Our lives are worlds away
The distance makes you blind

So you think you know the way that I should live my life
I know a better way I swear I know a better way
I'll smash your crown before I give you power to decide
I know a better way I swear I know a better way

You don't get to say what I'm made of
You don't give me a halo
Don't give me a halo

There is no sacred way
No rules to live my life
No man or deity
Can tell me wrong from right

So you think you know the way that I should live my life
I know a better way I swear I know a better way
I'll smash your crown before I give you power to decide
I know a better way I swear I know a better way

You don't get to say what I'm made of
You don't give me a halo
Don't give me a halo

You don't
You don't 

You don't get to say what I'm made of
You don't give me a halo
Don't give me a halo
You don't get to say what I'm made of 
You don't give me a halo
Don't give me a halo
