History repeats itself 
Over and over again and again
Why should we escape ourselves
We are who we are in the end in the end

Over and over again
Over and over again

This is madness madness
You know that this is madness madness
You know that this is never changing
Its always been this way
Consuming madness madness

Enemies who once were friends
Around and around still we know how it ends
I can't believe how sickening 
All the love lost we can't even pretend

Over and over again
Over and over again

This is madness madness
You know that this is madness madness
You know that this is never changing
Its always been this way
Consuming madness madness

This is madness madness
You know that this is madness madness
You know that this is never changing
Its always been this way
Consuming madness madness
