It's okay to have a bad year
As long as we don't let it win
It's okay if you don't see clear
As long as you remember that
Every day that I'm with you
Is another chance to get it right
I can say that I love you
Even when we fight
'Cause...

First times don't last
But they light the path right back to you
Right back to you
Bad days will pass
'Cause they're on the path right back to you
Right back to you

It took time for me to hear you
'Cause all I wanted was to say I'm right
And it took time for me to see through
Every way that you could say goodbye
And I don't think there was another way
For me to understand
And I'm sorry that I took so long
And now will you take my hand
Because...

First times don't last
But they light the path right back to you
Right back to you
Bad days will pass
'Cause they're on the path right back to you
Right back to you

The first time you left
I just had to wait
I knew you'd come back
'Cause you just felt like fate
You just felt like fate

First times don't last
But they light the path right back to you
Right back to you
Bad days will pass
'Cause they're on the path right back to you
Right back to you
Right back to you
