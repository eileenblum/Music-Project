Some days I like the ocean
It never seems to end
So help me through the motions
Until I see you again
Come be by my side
Fix this lonely night

You may be far away
But you're never far from home
No matter where I go
You may be far away
But you're never far from home
No, you're never far from home

When my voice is shaking
You are my steady hand
When I think I can't go on
You showed me that I can
Some times I forget
That you ever left

You may be far away
But you're never far from home
No matter where I go

You may be far away
But you're never far from home
No matter where I go
You may be far away
But you're never far from home
No, you're never far from home

Mom said I'm just like you
Little things you used to do
I like to think the same
Running from memories
Lessons you left with me
You teach me everyday

You may be far away
But you're never far from home
No matter where I go
You may be far away
But you're never far from home
No, you're never far from home
You may be far away
But you're never far from home
No matter where I go
You may be far away
But you're never far from home
No, you're never far from home
