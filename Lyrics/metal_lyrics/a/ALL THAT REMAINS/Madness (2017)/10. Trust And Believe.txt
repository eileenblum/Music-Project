Trust and believe my intentions are pure
As pure as the poison I put in the cure
Trust and believe that I will provide
Provide all your demons with places to hide

Be careful what you wish for
(Careful what you wish for)
(Careful what you wish for)

All through the night and over the screams
Trust and believe
All through the night, your secrets we'll keep
Trust and believe

Trust and believe that your family is safe
Safe through the eyes that know where you sleep
Trust and believe that I know what's right
Right to take yours and then they get mine

Be careful what you wish for
(Careful what you wish for)
(Careful what you wish for)

All through the night and over the screams
Trust and believe
All through the night, your secrets we'll keep
Trust and believe

All through the night and over the screams
Trust and believe
All through the night, your secrets we'll keep
Trust and believe

Trust and believe (Trust and believe)
