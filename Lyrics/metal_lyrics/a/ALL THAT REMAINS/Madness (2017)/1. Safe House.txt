Before you knew which house it was I knew where you'd come in
Welcome I've been waiting
To think you'd find your victim here will be your fatal sin
Welcome I've been waiting
The lights were out the car was gone the door was left unlocked
You've already been caught
The path was laid the rope was fresh and every gun was cocked
You've already been caught

Welcome to my safe house
Do you feel safe now
Semi automatic I don't panic when it goes down
Welcome to my safe house
Do you feel safe now
Aka your gods away there's no one you can call now
Do you feel safe now
Do you feel safe now
Do you feel safe now
Do you feel safe now

The kitchen then the hall there was no other path to take
You don't know its too late
One more room to guide you through then show you your mistake
You don't know its too late
The moment I'm behind you and you know what its about
And you're forsaken now
By the time you think to run you're starting to bleed out
And did not let me down

Welcome to my safe house
Do you feel safe now
Semi automatic I don't panic when it goes down
Welcome to my safe house
Do you feel safe now
Aka your gods away there's no one you can call now
Do you feel safe now
Do you feel safe now
Do you feel safe now
Do you feel safe now

Welcome to my safe house
Do you feel safe now
Semi automatic I don't panic when it goes down
Welcome to my safe house
Do you feel safe now
Aka your gods away there's no one you can call now
Do you feel safe now

Welcome
