You're not as smart as you think you are
Spin doctor shit talker
I make the rules you ain't got nothing on me
The clever line only gets you this far
Spin doctor shit talker
Don't think your straw man means a damn thing to me

You're loud
You're loud 
I'm louder
You're weak
I'm power
Go ahead and try to paint me red
'Cause I'm like no one that you've ever met
You're loud
You're loud
I'm louder

The truth is loud no matter where you hide
Sleep walker fear monger
I make the rules you ain't got nothing on me
You may not hear me but you will in time
Sleep walker fear monger
Don't think your straw man means a damn thing to me

You're loud
You're loud 
I'm louder
You're weak
I'm power
Go ahead and try to paint me red
'Cause I'm like no one that you've ever met
You're loud
You're loud
I'm louder

You're loud 
You're loud

You're loud
You're loud 
I'm louder
You're weak
I'm power
Go ahead and try to paint me red
'Cause I'm like no one that you've ever met
You're loud
You're loud
I'm louder

You're loud
You're loud
