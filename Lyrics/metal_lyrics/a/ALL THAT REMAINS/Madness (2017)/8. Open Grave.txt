It's not my suffering
It's not my wound to cover
I'm dying watching you bleed
Why can't I make this better
Face down, I need some water
There's nothing I can do
To make you stronger

How long will we pray to silence?
How long?
How long will we pray to silence?
How long?

Don't give up, I've heard you say
Over and over from an open grave
Eviscerated by your misery
I watched you rot inside an open grave

You're blade between my ribs
It never lets me forget
Fight with every breath
To keep the anger in
Ripped out
Slave of compassion
Stitch by stitch
You just let it happen

How long will we pray to silence?
How long?

Don't give up, I've heard you say
Over and over from an open grave
Eviscerated by your misery
I watched you rot inside an open grave

It's not my suffering
It's not my wound to cover
I'm dying watching you bleed
Why can't I make this better
Ripped out
Slave of compassion
Stitch by stitch
You just let it happen

Don't give up, I've heard you say
Over and over from an open grave
Eviscerated by your misery
I watched you rot inside an open grave
Eviscerated by your misery
I watched you rot inside an open grave
