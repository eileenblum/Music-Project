You can zone me shut
Or cut out my tongue
But you can't unhear me now
Neck deep in concrete
You can bury me
But you'll never drown me out

Something they can't see
See how you fear me
I'm never sorry!

Scream
Repeat after me
I'm never sorry, I'm never sorry
Scream
Repeat after me
I'm never sorry, I'm never sorry

I will trip that line
I'll be crucified
You can hang me upside down
In your righteous purge
I will re-emerge
Still I turn this world around

Something they can't see
See how you fear me
I'm never sorry!

Scream
Repeat after me
I'm never sorry, I'm never sorry
Scream
Repeat after me
I'm never sorry, I'm never sorry

Scream
Repeat after me
I'm never sorry, I'm never sorry
Scream
Repeat after me
I'm never sorry
Scream
Repeat after me
I'm never sorry, I'm never sorry
Scream
Repeat after me
I'm never sorry, I'm never sorry

I'm never sorry!
I'm never sorry!
I'm never sorry!
I'm never sorry!
