Liquid, he goes with the flow
And travels with fortune and ease
Channels his fate, follows his curse
Sailing an ocean of peace

Polymorph from Ceres, Neptune and Jove
Hybrid form, you're genetically improved
Ambivalent with skills eclipsing the norm
Polymorph, the only way to conform

Solid of the utmost strength
Unexposed to erosion of time
In a shell resting to hell
You shatter the ones that collide

Polymorph from Ceres, Neptune and Jove
Hybrid form, you're genetically improved
Ambivalent with skills eclipsing the norm
Polymorph, the only way to conform

Aeriform, swift and light
You expand and rise above all
You can reach for the sky and prevail
While the others fall

Polymorph from Ceres, Neptune and Jove
Hybrid form, you're genetically improved
Ambivalent with skills eclipsing the norm
Polymorph, the only way to conform
