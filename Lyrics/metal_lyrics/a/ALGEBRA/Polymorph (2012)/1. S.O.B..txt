If I were to spend a second more with you
I think I'd go ape shit
Because I'll have to rip my head off
And shove it up my ass
There is something slightly irritating
About every little thing in you
You genetically modified
Mother-fucking cunt

I can't tolerate anymore of this shit
The door is over there: get the fuck out!
I can't respect your arrogance
Another word and your life is through
Son of a bitch

I never would want to be near you
But you happen to have the same job as me
We're mutually exclusive, but I'll keep my stand
And expel you from existence

I can't tolerate anymore of this shit
The door is over there: get the fuck out!
I can't respect your arrogance
Another word and your life is through
Fucking cunt

If I were to see your ugly face again
I think I'd go spastic
'Cause I'll have to get aggressive
And release my anger on you
There's something slightly irritating
About every little thing in you
You genetically modified
Mother-fucking cunt

I can't tolerate anymore of this shit
The door is over there: get the fuck out!
I can't respect your arrogance
Another word and your life is through
Son of a bitch
