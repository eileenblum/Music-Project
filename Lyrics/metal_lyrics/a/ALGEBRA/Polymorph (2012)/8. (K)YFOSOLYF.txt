Walking alone like his own slave
Nothing is all that he has
Spitting on reality
No morality truth

The truth never appeased as blasphemy to his ears

Psychology oh no logic
Slavery is systematic
The path to choose seems enigmatic
But the best is demonic

A thousand perversities in his mind
Don't allow him to be right
Forevermore stands a man
Never bows before a lie

The faith never appears as blasphemic to his ears

Psychology oh no logic
Slavery is systematic
The path to choose seems enigmatic
But the best is demonic

Men go slaughter other men
And I ask: What's the meaning?
Killing for religion cannot be a reason

The truth never appears as blasphemic to his ears
