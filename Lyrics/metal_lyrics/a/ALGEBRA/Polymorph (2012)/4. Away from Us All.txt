Billions of light-years away
In another place and time
Far from a system he can no longer take
Escaping reality

Where did you go?
Away from us all

Nonsense visions
Incompatible
Away from us all

He died inside in a shell
His inner conflict was lost
He now stares into emptiness
Escaping his painful existence

Where did you go?
Away from us all

Nonsense visions
Incompatible
Away from us all

Joys of youth followed by collisions with the truth
Propelled him into a boundless, never-ending dream

Is he dead or alive?
I am not even sure
Somehow, it seems not so bad
To be isolated

Where did you go
Away from us all
