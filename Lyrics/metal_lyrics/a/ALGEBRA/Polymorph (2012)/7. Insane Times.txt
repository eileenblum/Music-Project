Sorcerer of death makes you die
And resurrect a million times
Rips off your balls, makes you a woman
Killing you softly with this song

Welcome to death
You'll go to hell and never come back

Sorcerer, high priest of the damned
Burns down your house and ravages your land
Takes away your life, your soul and your TV
Makes you listen to Algebra until you decease

Welcome to death
You'll go to hell and never come back

A surge of agony throws you into despair
Deep torment drives you insane while somatic death begins

Sorcerer of death makes you die
And resurrect a million times
Rips of your balls, makes you a woman
Killing you softly with this song

Welcome to death
You'll got to hell and never come back
