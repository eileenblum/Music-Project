As an unwanted child of Tim was born
In a hostile climate he had to grow
To become a rejected kid
But he stayed optimistic

While the others focused on their looks
Tim developed posterity

Man plays the game of chance like a ball
Thrown onto various surfaces
Sometimes smooth and sometimes rough
So randomly rebound
Tim's Calvary

Life was hard, so he dreamt
And conceived his own reality
He tried to cross the social gap
But the solution wasn't there

While the others focused on their looks
Tim developed posterity

Man plays the game of chance like a ball
Thrown onto various surfaces
Sometimes smooth and sometimes rough
So randomly rebound
Tim's Calvary

He wants decency to be restored
And that the guilty be scented
Not to prove that he knows more
But to think a little or sink in silence

Internal conflict
Between a big heart and mind
Leads to a lot of confusion

Now Tim is falling over so deep
But still convinced in a higher plateau
Darkest of thoughts begin to invade
A man too often put to the test

Man plays the game of chance like a ball
Thrown onto various surfaces
Sometimes smooth and sometimes rough
So randomly rebound
Tim's Calvary
