Falling off the path that makes no more sense
I feel like a kind of my own
Somewhat lost at first, I refound myself
My vision is solid as stone

Eyes opened
Illusions deceive
A message that it's time to leave

Off the trail to fail
To an altered future
Waiting to set sail
In the distance, a storm ready to burst

Rejecting all that I see
Infecting stagnation
I bleed
