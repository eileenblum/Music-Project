Every day of my life, I'm in a shitty mood
I try to make things better, but my anger is an anchor

What's my worth if my purpose is none?
Roam the world to find my way
Did some studies and something I don't get
Is working all life long for a corporate pig

Every day of my life, I get more and more angry
A good messiah is a messiah that's been slaughtered

What's my worth if my purpose is none?
Roam the world to find my way
Did some studies and something I don't get
Is working all life long for a corporate pig

Aggression, we all life for it
Religion, condemned unit
Betrayal is in our blood
Algebra, forever slaves of thrash

Every day of my life, I'm in a shitty mood
I try to make things better, but my anger is an anchor

What's my worth if my purpose is none?
Roam the world to find my way
Did some studies and something I don't get
Is working all life long for a corporate pig
