Rich people killing the planet
We must expand the black market
While ripping off social benefits
To integrate society and destroy it
Read the paper to find the gaps
To overrule the system
Minimum effort to maximize gains
Is how we'll milk them

Crook

Always a back door
To escape malevolent ways
That have brought us here
Into cerebral decay

I'm a failure, parasite
I was even told I'm a crook
But your vision of life
Isn't your own

Crook

Always a back door
To escape malevolent ways
That have brought us here
Into cerebral decay

Crook

I will never want to submit
I'll always get away with murder
