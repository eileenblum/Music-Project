Through a fog, a blinding Sun tells me we're soon done
Before a dead landscape, I try to breathe while life escapes
Fill the holes with empty goals and watch the World explode
Procreate when it's too late
The need to seed is desperate

On track to a collapse we're not ready to face
We've had our chance, now let's make some space
The invisible hand gently chokes
Is there still a pulse?

We keep fighting and fucking
Walking down one-way streets
We keep abusing and using
Survival of the fittest or mutual defeat

Now's our timeâ¦ Time to die

Wake up
You're weak
You're worthless
You're failing
You're weak
You're too late
You're failing

There's no life inside, giving birth while others die
Just stop and do the math: we're on the wrong path
With so many mouths to feed, only one place where this leads
The days in the Sun are gone when the nuclear fallout comes

On track to a collapse we're not ready to face
We've had our chance, now make some space
The invisible hand chokes.
