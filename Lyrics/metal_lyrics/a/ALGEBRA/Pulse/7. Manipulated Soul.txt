Everything you do is monitored
Your family and friends just avatars simulated by a Quantum God
Analyzing your behavior
Manipulated soul

You had this feeling once before of being watched from above
Afraid of this craze, you let it fade into the depths of your subconsciousness
Technology beyond your wildest dreams exists

World hunger and poverty are a diversion created to hide a fake reality
It keeps us occupied to preserve perversion
Promoting growth with programmed greed
Maximize conflict

Everything you do is monitored
Your family and friends just avatars
Still wonder why you feel abandoned?
Maybe 'cause you're just a program
Manipulated soul

You had this feeling once before of being watched from above
Afraid of this craze, you let it fade into the depths of your subconsciousness
Technology beyond your wildest dreams exists

World hunger and poverty are a diversion created to hide a fake reality
It keeps us occupied to preserve perversion

Maximize conflict

You had this feeling once before of being watched from above
Afraid of this craze, you let it fade into the depths of your subconsciousness
Technology beyond your wildest dreams exists.
