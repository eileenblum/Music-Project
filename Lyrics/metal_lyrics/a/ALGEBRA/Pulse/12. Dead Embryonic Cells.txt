Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone
Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

A land full of shit coming down
Tribal violence everywhere
Life in the age of terrorism
We spit in your other face

War of races
Land without intelligence
A place consumed by time
End of it all

We're born
With pain
Suffer
We're dead embryonic cells

Corrosion inside, we feel
Condemned future, we see
Emptiness calls, we hear
Final premonition, the truth

Land of anger
I didn't ask to be born
Sadness, sorrow
Everything so alone
Laboratory sickness
Infects humanity
No hope for cure
Die by technology

We're born
With pain
Suffer
Remains
We're born
With pain
Suffer
Remains
We're dead.
