Degenerated generation
Memories turn into flame
Early dementia settles in
Dreams are blurred and erased

Voluntary amnesia to forget the future

Running to stay alive
Where there's hope, there is life
'Cause we're getting crushed by an unforgiving machine

The end is falling into place
Only the elite will survive

It's time to ease the pain once and for all
It's time to abolish the inner constraints

Corporations gone rebel
Technology is unstoppable

You lost the race when it began
The future was never in your hands
No time to pretend
Sit back and enjoy the end!

Behold, the end is falling into place
Even the elite won't survive

It's time to ease the pain once and for all
It's time to abolish the inner constraints
The inner constraints
Abolish the inner constraints.
