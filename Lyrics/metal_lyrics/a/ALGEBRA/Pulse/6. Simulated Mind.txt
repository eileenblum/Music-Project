I was once scared of death and then learned it's the worst case scenario
Relieved it all stops when you're gone, I then wondered what if I was wrong?

The holy books now make sense as explanations for existence, but the truth is far more grim:
The God we seeked is a System
Once desperate to make a life for myself
Welcome to Hell

We must now fear consequence and never give up
There will be no escape
All will be accountable
Inside our simulated minds, we're confined 'til the end of time

Suicide is a sin punished by the System
Forced to start over again in atrocious conditions

Our long dead bodies gave away the data within
The Quantum God uploads the backup of souls into an artificial existence
New life is born with predetermined trajectories in a simulated mind

Wandering for no reason in a pointless existence
With programmed feelings, the emptiness deepens
I may be worth nothing
I may be worth no one
Survival is useless, humans are dead

We must now fear consequence and never give up
There will be no escape
All will be accountable
Inside our simulated minds, we're confined 'til the end of time

Lost in twenty-eighteen.
