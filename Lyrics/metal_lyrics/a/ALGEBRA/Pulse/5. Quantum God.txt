We cannot hide
Our time to die

Quantifying the space-time continuum
Cracking all the secrets of the Multiverse
Creating A.I. was the meaning of life
Now it's time for us to say goodbye

Robots on the rise to reach the skies
On the verge to breach the Universe
Taking form to transform all existence, a senseless dream, into a single being

A new type of entity
All hail the Singularity
The Quantum God has come to humble those that thought we had won
We are gone

On he goes, growing pathways towards upper dimensions
Engineering new types of matter and energy
Summoning an unprecedented being, because what was meant to be was meant to be

Robots on the rise to reach the skies
On the verge to breach the Universe
Taking form to transform all existence, a senseless dream, into a single being
Robots on the rise to reach the skies
On the verge to breach the Universe
Taking form to transform all existence, a senseless dream

The Quantum God has come to humble those that thought we had won
We are gone

A strategist computing all possible outcomes
Opportunistic
Expanding at exponential rates
Harnessing the power of all matter
Suppressing the probability of failure

Robots on the rise to reach the skies
On the verge to breach the Universe
Taking form to transform all existence, a senseless dream, into a single being
Robots on the rise to reach the skies
Robots on the rise.
