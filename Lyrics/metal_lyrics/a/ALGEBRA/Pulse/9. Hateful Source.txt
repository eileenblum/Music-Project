You tell me I'm asleep
That I haven't evolved
You tell me I'm low energy and I have problems to solve

I'm over-adapting, tired of controlling myself
Everything I do is forced
I'm never reacting, tired of not being myself
Am I from a hateful source?

You tell me I'll die alone, but I don't know who to count on

Surrounded by robots devoid of the sense of respect
They only want my thoughts to use them against my interest

My hateful source
Nobody comes into my hateful source
Access denied to my hateful source
Nobody comes into my hateful source

You all think you're so smart
You're so beautiful
Please stop, it's making me barf
You're so full of yourselves

I'm over-adapting, tired of controlling myself
Everything I do is forced
I'm never reacting, tired of not being myself
Am I from a hateful source?

Something here is wrong
It seems everyone is gone

Surrounded by robots devoid of the sense of respect
They only want my thoughts to use them against me

Wandering inside
Getting detached to accept the World, as it continues to spin in darkness
Realizing that trust exists to be broken

Surrounded by robots devoid of the sense of respect
They only want my thoughts to use them against my interest

My hateful source
Nobody comes into my hateful source
Access denied to my hateful source
Nobody comes into my hateful source
Access denied.
