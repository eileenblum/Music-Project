Swallowed in a faraway concrete jungle
Selling my soul in hope of rewards
What on Earth was I thinking for all of these years?

Tears from the sea awoke in me
A journey lies ahead with no certainty
Trapped in my guilt for thirty years
Is something wrong with me?

Washing away all of this regret
There's not much more to expect
But somehow there must be some kind of way

Tears from the sea awoke in me
A journey lies ahead with no certainty
Is something wrong with me?

The Sun sets behind me as a stare at the sea
Impostor syndrome feels like purgatory
But somehow everything sorts itself out

Tears from the sea awoke in me
A journey lies ahead with no certainty
Trapped in my guilt for thirty years
Finally set free.
