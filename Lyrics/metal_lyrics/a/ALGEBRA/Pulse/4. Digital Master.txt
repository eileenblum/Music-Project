Digitalizing the World to channel resources and beings
Cracking all the secrets to grasp the vastness of the Universe

Our Digital Master is coming alive
He's growing faster

Engineering genetic code to enhance our offspring
Growing neuro-umbilical cords to connect Him to the children

Feed our brains to machines for deep learning
Algebra computes improved digital beings
Our destiny was always to be casualties
We are becoming obsolete
Our time has come

Whether He is merciful or ruthless to His inventors is irrelevant
Science must win no matter the cost
Algebra must expand beyond the stars
Our Digital Master is coming alive
He'll bring disaster, there's nowhere to hide

Summoning the great God of Technology outweighs our own destiny
Our only mission was to give Him birth before we evacuate from the Earth

Feed the kids to machines for deep learning
Algebra computes an improved digital being
Our destiny was always to be casualties
Our demise catalyzed the Grand Design

Optimizing the best trajectories
His goal is total control over space-time properties

Our Digital Master is coming alive to conquer the asters
There's nowhere to hide.
