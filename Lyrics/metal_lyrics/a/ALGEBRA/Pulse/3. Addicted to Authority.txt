Drown me with your rules
Guide me like a fool
I'm lost and confused
Use me like a tool

Format my brain 'til I'm thick, oh one who understands
Feed me more trash 'til I'm sick
My life's in your hands
Give me more drugs 'til I'm an addict
I trust in your command

Free will is tiring me
I want to be addicted to authority
Will someone approve of me?
I don't want to see I'm addicted to authority

Show me how to behave
Let us have it your way
Tell me what to say
Freedom makes me afraid

Format my brain 'til I'm thick, one who understands
Feed me more trash 'til I'm sick
I'm under your command
I'm sick

Feed me more trash 'til I'm sick
Give me more drugs 'til I'm an addict
Format my brain 'til I'm thick
Analyze my data click by click

Staring around at humans, I see only monkeys blinded by a need of relevance
Progressing towards an abyss

Free will is tiring me
I want to be addicted to authority
Will someone approve of me?
I want to be addicted to authority
I'm at your feet

Addicted to authority
I don't want to see
Addicted to authority
I comply to your beliefs

Tell me what to see
My judgement's impaired
Show me how to be
Freedom makes me scared

Format my brain 'til I'm thick, oh one who understands
Feed me more trash 'til I'm sick
I'm under your command
Give me more drugs 'til I'm an addict

Glorious one, divide us into boxes
Difference contained and tagged with caution
You decide tolerance is toxic in order to maintain a prosperous conflict.
