We see a way
We can restore our clarity

(WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT!?!?!)

Drinking and fighting, thats how we roll
Getting fucked and breaking some skulls
Never living on a "X"
But they still feel the need to follow like a sheep (follow like a sheep)
Drinking and fighting, thats how we roll
Getting fucked and breaking some skulls
Never living on a "X"
Drinking beer, pissing on the thought of sober
(mental date rape)
Drinking and fighting, thats how we roll
Getting fucked and breaking some skulls
Never living on a "X"

Quench your fear
Down your fear
Fuck all your judgment [repeated]
You're wrong
Burn them, burn them down
Dont live, you're life as shut off [repeated]
I take a good look at what lies infront of me
Don't half feel like date rape (date rape)
Don't hide all your life
Why do we still feel the need to betray
What's pouring through my veins
My life, my way
My body will feel, the Edge cant take me
In every cavity, rotting away
