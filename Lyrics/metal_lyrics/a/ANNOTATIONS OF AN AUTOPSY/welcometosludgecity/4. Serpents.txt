The serpents lay in bile down below
miles down way below the surface
bloody waves flowing through its rivers
unearthly winds blowing through its chambers
Dead of light, dead of life, filled with hate
He will conquer

The worlds life and the divine light
One day he will return
He, the bastard son of a fallen angel
he, the one who will bring god to his knees
He. The bastard son of a fallen angel
he, the one who will bring.....
Genocide
Of heaven
decimate, the heavens
heavens, will come, falling down
down below, he'll show you pain
And when he takes his wraith

NOT EVEN THE ANGELS WILL BE

Spared of death [repeated]
God has abandoned you, left to burn [repeated]

the bastard son of a fallen angel
the bastard son has returned
HE WILL REAP DEATH

HE CALLS MY...NAME
(He calls me, he calls me)

He burns our fields
across the land
he burns our oceans
he burns all our resources
he burns all life

The earth
is gods grave
free of pain
and suffering
