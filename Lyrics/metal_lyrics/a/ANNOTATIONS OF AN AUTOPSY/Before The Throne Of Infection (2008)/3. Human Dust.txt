Crushing, bludgeoning you into dust
Mushing, pounding you into dust
Smashing, ripping, pounding your bones into dust
I'm here to bludgeon you
Now here I come, here I come to bludgeon you
Ground down, viciously, pound down, horribly
Ground down, viciously pound down into dust
Crushed down into human dust
I have come to fuck you, smash in your face
The time has come for me to end, leave you in a ditch
The time has come for me to
Pound you with my dick til you're unconscious
Bitch, I've shown you who's the bigger man
