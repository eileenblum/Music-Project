Did you really expect me to bow down to you
And follow without question?
What do you mean, I'm living in sin?
There's no nice way of informing you of this
But I'm a living infection, I've come to cripple
Once it starts I wont stop until I hear the crack
So just remember to swallow
There's an everlasting taste of failure
Did you really expect me to
Bow down?
I will never bow down without questions
I won't stop and and I don't stop and I'll never stop til I hear the crack
I wont til I hear the bones separate
I will never bow before you, this is my throne
This is my throne, no god rules me
