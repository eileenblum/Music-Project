Kneel before the tomb of disease
Decimate all
Standing at its doorways, ghostly shrieks approach me
Distorted by the air
Kneel before the tomb of disease
The stench, the smell of dismemberment pleases me
This place will be my tomb; it haunts me
Ghastly shrieks, pungent stenches, this is my resting place
This will be my undead fortress
My soul reigns eternally
On my throne
