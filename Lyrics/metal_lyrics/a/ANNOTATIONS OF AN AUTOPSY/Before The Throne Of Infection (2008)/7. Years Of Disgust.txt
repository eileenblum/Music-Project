My knife is deep inside your fucking uterus
Shut your fucking mouth as I'm thrusting
My knife inside your sexual organs
You should never be allowed to reproduce
I'll make it my priority to wipe you out
You fucking plague on humanity
I'll watch your body twitch and squirm
Carve your cunt like a 6ft ditch
I only called you over so I could commit murder
And rid this world of one fucked-up cunt
You're the queen of filth and hypocrisy
Spinning your web of lies and hate
You don't deserve life, you fucking disgust me
Your soul is dead
And burning, you'll bleed for me
For years and years you've sickened me
Left a path of destruction in your wake
You're the queen of filth, spreading hypocrisy
Your soul is dead
For years and years I have lived
In your filth
Your soul is dead
Sew my cock in your cunt
So we're eternally fucking
