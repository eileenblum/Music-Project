The bones of the ancients lay silent in the dust.
Entwind with the remains of
the resitance.
I stood somber admist the remnants
of a war forght in
vein.
As I look upon their bones I knew it was my time.

In the absence of
the sun,
I stood somber admist the storm
and witessed the aftermath of
heresy,
and the fall of the divine.

My eyes transfixed upon a distant
shape.
Glowing, drawing ever closer.
I watched as the shape drew near
and
before my eyes turned into a demon.

He stoped in his tracks before me.
Upon
his head layed a crown of fire.
The flames flickered as his eyes met mine.
We
stood motionless in the storm
and he spoke to me.

"I've seen all that is to
be seen,
I've heard all that is to be heard.
I am all knowing but still I am
empty,
I'm so empty."

He forged this crown from the flame
of mankind, but
the sadness of the world laid heavy on
his brow. He can no longer bare the
burden of humanity.

The bones of the ancients lay silent in the
dust.
Entwind with the remains of the resitance.
I stood somber admist the
remnants
of a war forght in vein.
As I look upon their bones I knew it was my
time.

Right before my eyes, the demon turned
to ash upon the snow.
I took
the crown, as the winds
took his remains to the sky.
The Wolves Gather Around
me howling black lullabys.
Their songs enslave even the strongest man in
sleep.

As we slumber the snow erases us.
Wiping clean the slates of
time.
Whitnessing the end of the world we know.
Wiping clean our
existence.

In the absence of the sun,
I stood somber admist the storm.
The
crown of hell laid heavy upon my head
as the world fell into the black slumber.
