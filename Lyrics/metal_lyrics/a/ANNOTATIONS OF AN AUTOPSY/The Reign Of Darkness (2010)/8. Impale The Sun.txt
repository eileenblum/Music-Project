A holy icon
Shining down spreading dogma
It's rays suffocate me
Blistering the skin of my effigy
A blinding icon
Burns our eyes, branding our minds
Its rays burn through my skin
Exposing the demon within
Its glowing rays burn into our eyes
Creating a divine state of control
Flooding our minds with holy propaganda
Closing our eyes to a world of lies
Branded by the holy flame
Fooled by the trinity
The rancid flesh that cages my true form
Is slowly falling from me
Revealing my true face, humanity will now witness
As i plunge this world into suffocating darkness
Rise, as the halo of the slave earth shatters
Appointed leaders, lay cold and blue
Worshipers drag the swamps searching for a martyr
Step into the void, embrace my emptiness
Everything you worshiped, now crowned in shit
Branded by the holy flame
Fooled by the trinity
The rancid flesh that cages my true form
Is slowly falling from me
Revealing my true face for the whole world to wee
In order to free our minds
We must impale the sun
The age of the church is dead
When the sun falls, darkness will rise
Humanity will witness the dawn of a new kingdom
As we step into the age of enslavement
