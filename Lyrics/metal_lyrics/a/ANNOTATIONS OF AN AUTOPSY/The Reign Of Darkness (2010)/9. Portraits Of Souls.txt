Engaged in time, torn between two worlds
Swallowed whole by consuming vacuums
Dematerialized hands reach to the sky
Turned xenon through matter displacement
Witnessing the passing of centuries
This is non existence
Trapped between worlds
Frozen in time in a portrait of souls
Salvation, isolation, desolation of life
Swallowed whole by portals in time
And my soul escapes me, i fade away
Entwined through the centuries, finally coming to an end
Frozen i stand watching the ever decaying new world
Drawing breath in the realization, that everything may be nothing
I only exist by your wish, neither matter nor being
Is this really existence!?
Engaged in time, torn between two worlds
Swallowed whole by consuming vacuums
Dematerializing hands reach to the sky
Turned xenon through matter displacement
Witnessing the passing of centuries
This is non existence
Trapped between worlds
Frozen in time in a portrait of souls
Salvation, isolation, desolation of life
Swallowed whole by portals in time
And my soul escapes me, i fade away
As i stand before the end of time
I wish to meet my own spirit
The walls of time come crashing down
As time and space implode, discretion
The third dimension, reduced to nothing
As we remain trapped in future echoes
This is non existence
