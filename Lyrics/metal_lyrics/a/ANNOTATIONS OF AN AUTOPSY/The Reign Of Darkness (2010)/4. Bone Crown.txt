I am hell!!!
Sworn to black, to the legion of darkness
A crown of thorns replaced with human bone
Underneath the moonlight i speak the sacred oath
The sun begins to wane as my words grace the air
And the blood beings to let upon the altar
The slaughter of the lamb, the day turns to night
As the darkness starts to flow into my body
As the rain begins to fall, and the wins begin to blow
The reign of darkness has begun and we will never let it end
We are the legion of darkness
Sworn to the black opposer of the light
Sworn to darkness, forever at my side
Sworn to the black, opposer of the light
Sworn to darkness, do my will
The sun begins to wane as my words grace the air
And the blood begins to let upon the altar
The slaughter of the lamb, the day turns to night
As the darkness starts to flow into my body
We will bring down all of divinity
As we follow our instincts to kill
Unholy legions sworn to the black
Toasting the blood of a thousand infants
They stand as one under the light of the moon
As they masturbate upon the cross
Sworn to black, to the legion of darkness
A crown of thorns replaced with that of bone
Underneath the moonlight i speak the sacred oath
I am hell!!!
