The age of the storm has come
And with it the end of man
The rise of the hybrid race
And the crowning of a new darkness
In darkness we cease to exist
As we fall into emptiness
The winds blow freezing the earth to the core
Nothing can live on in this endless storm
Can you see the instinct to kill within my eyes
The thirst for blood is overwhelming
Man's foolishness is sickening
This its the age of emptiness
The skies above are growing dark
The age of man has come to an end
As the fires begin to diminish
Our blindness has lead to ultimate demise
In this sunless, eternal winter
Our power is taken from our hands before our eyes
As man cowers before the might of their race
We surrender our freedom and our lives
Now and forever we cease to exist
Now and forever we do not exist
Can you see the instinct to kill within my eyes
The thirst for blood is overwhelming
Man's foolishness is sickening
This is the age of emptiness
The great storm is upon us and with it comes the greatest threat
Man has ever known, those too weak to stand up and fight
Look to the sky with their arms open wide
Consumed by emptiness in the absence of their god
This is the age of the storm
There will be no survival
This is the end of mankind
There won't be a trace left behind
