Sent down from above, i am no angel
My forked tongue bleeds nothing but hate
Pure hate
The path of the divine has long been forgotten
And his earth will remain a frozen wasteland
Forked tongues flicker casting sweet blasphemy
I wade amongst a sea of serpents, in snakes i bathe
Oh serpentine creature
Bless me with the wealth of pure darkness
For i have enslaved his kingdom in your name
Excreted his remains upon his holy land
As i lay in a blanket of scales
A widening grin smeared upon my face
I bathe in the tides i have created
As i watch his legacy turn to ash
Oh serpentine creature
Bless me with the wealth of pure darkness
For i have enslaved his kingdom in your name
Excreted his remains upon his holy land
I am pure fucking hate
Just like your saviour, your world is condemned
