A catastrophic series of events
Leading to the demise of civilization
Our days upon this earth are numbered
For the foolish this is prophetic revelation
For the intelligent this is inevitable
Existence is a burden i am too tired to carry
This was not our choice
As the final hours tick down, the rules of modern man disappear as crime now is the law of the land, devolution
Fuck!
Military forces, fall under the power of their masses
Crushed and killed by hybrid armies
What have we become, slaves
We have become slaves
The joining of two races
Catastrophic hybridization
The end of civilization
Catastrophic hybridization
The sun has fallen, raise your hands to the sky and watch them burn
Total contamination, leading to eradication
We must prepare for what is to come and accept our end
I will rise as the earth falls
I will always stand my grand
We will fight for what is ours
Until the day we die
The cause has been before our eyes for centuries
But we are too blind to see
The merging of our leaders and alien race
The absolute end of all we known
They have achieved their aim
Total devastation and enslavement of the human race
Our leaders have betrayed mankind
Modifying our dna to suit their needs
An ancient race of a higher evolution
Controlling us for years by misinformation
Catastrophic hybridization
Is this the end of time or just the rebirth of the world
We don't have a say, it's in their hands now..
