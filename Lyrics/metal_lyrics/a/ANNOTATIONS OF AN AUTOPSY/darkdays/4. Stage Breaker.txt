Pure fucking hate

There is no love, there is no respect.
All we have is hate and misery
In this world full of agony [2x]

I'm not a nice man
I'm fucking miserable
I don't care about anything, anyone
I don't believe in love
All I feel is hate
And no god determines my face
I am the face of hate (hate)
And you will know my name
I am the face of hate
And you will know my fucking name

My dying words to the world would be
Fuck you
All you pricks tryna run your mouth
Fuck you
My dying words to the world would be
Fuck you
And if you think I respect you
Fuck yo too

No respect
No respect for anyone
There is no love, there is no respect.
All we have is hate and misery
In this world full of agony [2x]
This world is agony
I fucking hate every single one of you
Fuck
