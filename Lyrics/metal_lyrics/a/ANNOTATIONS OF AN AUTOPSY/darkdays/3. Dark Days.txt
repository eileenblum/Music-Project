They say that we should always follow our heart but what if mine was already dead from the start
Trying to find something that can not be found, while the weight of the world drags me down
On this cold dark road you'll forget who you are and realise who you're meant to be
Over time the only thing that's stayed by my side are these grey clouds hanging over me

I am loosing my mind
I can't go on this world is fucking killing me
It will all be fine if these grey clouds stay over me

They say that we should always follow our heart
Well I guess that I was fucked from the start
Broken hands, dead on the floor lying in the dirt, begging for more

On this cold dark road you'll forget who you are and realise who you're meant to be
Over time the only thing that's stayed by my side are these grey clouds hanging over me

I am loosing my mind
I can't go on this world is fucking killing me
It will all be fine if these grey clouds stay over me

Everything is falling down around me
And I don't know if it can be saved
So say your goodbyes to the ones you once loved
Before you lay their bodies in their grave
