Yeah, and when the sun goes down and the moon comes up
We fucking run this town, armed to the teeth, young and dumb
We don't give a fuck about anyone.
We are the criminals you read about
We are the scum society could do without
We stand by everything we've ever said
And we'll be buried in a bad rep when we're fucking dead

We're everything you said and more
We've got the wolves howling at our door
We know your game of get rich quick
We ain't falling for it

So suck my fucking dick

Buried in a bad rep
Try ta step to me? are you fucking mad?
Yeah we got a rep and yeah we know it's bad
But we know none of it is true its all down to dirty snakes like you
Yeah, and when the sun goes down and the moon comes up

We fucking run this town
Armed to the teeth, young and dumb
We don't give a fuck about anyone
We are the criminals you read about
We are the scum society could do without
We stand by everything we've ever said

Your band is fucking shit!

We run, this town, we say, whats going down we cant be stopped!
