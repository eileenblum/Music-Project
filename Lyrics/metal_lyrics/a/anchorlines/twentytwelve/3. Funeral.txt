Anchorlines
I feel myself sinking
I feel nothing, always left wondering
How am I supposed to live like this?
Nothing makes sense, I'm left behind again
Should I let these feeling fade away?
How am I supposed to live like this?

Barely conscious, barely breathing
Always left anticipating
Lost inside my own head
Waiting for something to begin

And if you told me you cared
I'd tell you you're a liar
And if you told me you were there
I'd reach out with nothing left to bare

My heart cannot be defined
I try and try, but I never catch up
I'll never be yours, you'll never see me again
You were always so hard to please

And if I could explain this I'd give it my best
You're so close to home but a thousand miles away

This is the sound of my fucking funeral
And I'm sorry that I left you, but I can't hold on
So never let go

I will never be sorry for this
The heart wants what it can never have
I wish I never fucking existed
I wish I never knew you
I will never be sorry for this, never

Never feel this way again
Not in my fucking head

Thanks to joe.cisco for sending track #3 lyrics.
