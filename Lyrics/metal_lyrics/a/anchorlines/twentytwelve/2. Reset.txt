I never got a chance I didn't throw away, trapped by the things I never got to say
So preach your word one more time because no one's listening
There is no one I love, there is no one I trust
I've learned that everything is gone as quickly as it comes
My cemetery past is where I left my faith
Only I see who I am, please forget my face

I'll never look to the sky for answers because I'll never
Hear a word, you're what the world asked for and you failed us all
Pulling apart the pages for the answers, but you never stop and think
Now it's your turn to answer, what do you have to confess?

Faith healer (no), you are a death dealer
And you will die alone, there is no trace of god in your
When you sleep at night, you haunt your own dreams
Because you know deep down you're just as lost as me

[CHORUS]

Don't fucking lie to me, don't ever say you would die for me
I set myself straight when I started believing in myself

I've come to realize, you will never make a sacrifice
You wouldn't shed a drop of blood for me, or anyone you meet
You deserve an empty sky and a shallow grave
Maybe then, maybe then, you will find your fucking faith

If there's a light ahead, I must have missed it
If there's a god to hear my prayers, why would he listen?
I can't forgive

It's time to practice what you preach
You make me fucking sick
All you do is hide
But you can't run forever
