Iâm taking back the life I used to have.
You try to tear at my pride, but you canât see through my eyes.
Iâm sorry you think I failed you.
But I know where I came from and I know where Iâm going.
It hurts me to see you like this,
but it hurts more from the outside looking in,
I define myself through this.
Iâm here because of my choices, and through it all theyâve never left me with regrets.
Iâm dying from the inside out and nothing can heal me. Silence is an ugly sound.

My manufactured happiness will only last so long.
Despite a heavy heart Iâm taking steps to be strong.
So many broken promises and purpose betrayed.
Weâre not following orders, our futureâs being made.

We strayed from what they wanted and abandoned our needs.
Who needs you now?
Can you fucking hear me?
Iâm screaming at the top of my lungs!
We have to keep moving or weâll fade away.
Shout it right in their faces...

WE'RE HERE TO STAY

A tragedy in the making, for fear of breaking we became unbreakable.
Weâre unbreakable!
You canât stop us now.

I tried to build something I could be proud of, but I was struggling to just survive.
Success and failure have paved the road I walk on, I will reach the end.

You lack purpose and direction,
letting it slip through your fingers like sand.
All you can do is suck mine away.
If you canât have it, no one can.
