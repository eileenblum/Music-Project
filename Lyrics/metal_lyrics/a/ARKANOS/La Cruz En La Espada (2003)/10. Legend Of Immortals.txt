[Bonus track]

Raiders in a dark march
Are coming down from the sky
To seek our flesh and gold
They are waiting for the night

Demons from North Lands
Loneliness fills the Earth
No rest and save at home
No god can hear my call

But until we meet
I'll remember your eyes
And until the end
They will fight by my side
And they will never see our death
Together we'll triumph

Legend of immortals
Was written in this sacred lands
Although the Evil comes,
They'll never take our lives
