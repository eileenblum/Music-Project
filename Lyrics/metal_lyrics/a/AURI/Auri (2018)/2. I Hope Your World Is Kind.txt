These rooftops all silent
The lone light of foxen
My remains wide open
Before the still waters

A moment to admire
The sleeping with no memory
We're writers all of us
Deep in the world's listening

Every night I see
The "once upon a time - life"
Greeting me
But you can't buy me back
With a memory
With your brazen summer sun

Every night I sound
My low "I hope your world is kind"
Over the scape that fills the night
Something fair sleeps in your world

The rooftops all sleeping
Underneath them brittle
Little man-things
Unveiled clowns, false kings
Every moment the world in writing

The horizon in blazing
As another library burns down
Soon the morning comes
And into my heart's night
Infinity enters

Every night I see
The "once upon a time - life"
Greeting me
But you can't buy me back
With a memory
With your brazen summer sun

Every night I sound
My low "I hope your world is kind"
Over the scape that fills the night
Something fair sleeps in your world

Auri in the night
Sighs "I hope your world is kind"
As the dawn comes and by her side
He sits down and starts to play
