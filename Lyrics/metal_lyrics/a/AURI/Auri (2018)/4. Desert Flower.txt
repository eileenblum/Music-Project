All I wanted was
For to see your smile break out
A mirror for the sun and the early rising moon
All I wanted was

Past the line, on the steps, follow you
Hear me slowly breathe
Cross the line, up the steps, follow you
Hear my fading voice

All I wanted was
For to wake you from our dream
The hope of kingdom come
Drifting out across this field
All I wanted was

Past the line, on the steps, follow you
Hear me slowly breathe, and we'll
Cross the line, up the steps, follow you
Hear my failing voice

Once this morning has passed
Once this morning has gone

All I wanted was
For to cross the Rubicon
Softly pull the fences down
Cross the waves, across our lives
All I wanted was, to go
