I am coming for you

I am coming for you
There's nothing you can say or do now
So don't try
It's written in this land
It's written in the stars
It's written in your heart and

I am coming for you
So don't try

Lights out
The night pours in
Catch me if you can but you never will
Look deep, earthy deep
For I drift as you sleep
So surrender all
Surrender all

Arrival

There's nothing you can say or do now
So don't try
It's written in this sand
It's written in the trees
It's written in the sea

I'm falling through the constellations

I am coming for you
So don't hide
