In your scripted play
On the stage you call home
There's no seat for an unknown guest

Why the mean mouth
The many mirrors
Those songs to end all hearing

Come with me
The vast unknown awaits for us to see
Something so deeply hidden
Yet open before our eyes

Catch the world in writing
Draft a note or three
Listen to a farmer sing to a field

Time for a starwalk
Time to yearn
Some twists 'n turns

Come with me
The vast unknown awaits for us to see
Something so deeply hidden
Yet everscriven, so
Come with me
I'll take you to the rings, I'll take you where
The sons and daughters of endlessness came to be

Come, sit with me here for a while
Amidst the dancing skies
They will tell what lies ahead:
Strange comforts, curious canvases
Front seat to history
A seat for the guest unknown

Come with me
The vast unknown awaits for us to see
Something so deeply hidden
Yet everscriven, so
Come with me
I'll take you to the rings, I'll take you where
The sons and daughters of endlessness came to be
