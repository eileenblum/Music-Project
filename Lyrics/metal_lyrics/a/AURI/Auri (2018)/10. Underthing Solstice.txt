She is here again
Midwinter solstice, labor's end
Fantastically ornate woes
Human fancy, I suppose

From rooftops I can hear them sing
Through careful air
The choirs meet
I wonder and ponder
If one could meet mine

The light of dawn will not wait
Yet this night comes with
A wish inside
Never unlock the moon
The silence might escape

Their world is far, always the same
Tonight I gave Yule its true name
Began this song that might not do
What a proper song should do

As I don't do remembering
Can't give this song a ghost of past
I wonder I ponder
Why there is weight in time

The light of dawn will not wait
Yet this night comes with
A wish inside
Never unlock the moon
The silence might escape

The light of dawn will not wait
So, dear song,
Let's rest here a while
Never unlock the moon
It will keep you safe at night

The light of dawn will not wait
Yet this night comes with
A wish inside
Never lock the easy wind
The broken need to fly
