Girl, you're teaching me,
I'm learning the first shame
slowly starts to melt something
inside me is burning soon
I'll have to start crying
for a help
Hot smell of your sensual body
your red lips and eyes of pulling cat
destruct my feeling I'm a rowdie
all my notions about my nature bed

Round and round the world is turning
tell me why, who can answer me
my piece of mind is not returning
stop the time, to make all dreams more real

Prostitute, without emotions
priestess of the caressing loving
proslitute makes me crazy
maybe emused by my off showing
Traped my heart - prostitute

Eager hands in nervous tremble
tip of my tongue seeks to taste your dew
total fall in mental jungle
end of time and end of standart rules
Devil in our wasted bodies
into mind wants to penetrate
gods of love are stending by me
drops of the night count your business rate

Round and round the world is turning ...

Prostitute, without emotions ...

Stop the time. I want more loving ...
