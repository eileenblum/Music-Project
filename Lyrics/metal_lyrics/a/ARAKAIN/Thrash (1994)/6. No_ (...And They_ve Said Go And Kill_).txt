Sweat, flames so smart
Intim spray smells brimstone â warfare
Death circles all around
And your greatest aim is to stay alive

In ears still words of malice
That keeps you full of thrill
Youâd asked bout reason â where is
And theyâve said: âGo and kill!â

Breath of satan slaves
Hell that fills this deadzone â warfare
Let read your hands
How much time remains to stay alive

Dictator for his glory
This war wants to prolong
The end of one sad story
Die, if youâre not so strong

In ears still words of malice
That keeps you full of thrill
Youâd asked bout reason â where is
And theyâve said: âGo and kill!â

Promises broken
Listen how funeral bell tolls
Threat of your fate
Announces the change for the worse
All what was spoken
Lost, when the poisonous gas rolls
Wall made from hate
Forces us to take this course

No! Generalissimo, no! To funeral bell
No! Generalissimo, no! Fuck off that hell
No!
