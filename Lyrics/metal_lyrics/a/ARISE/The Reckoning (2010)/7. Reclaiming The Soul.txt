I've been searching for something so bad
Wish I had to go somewhere
In my own world you cannot bring me down
Been on the run for so long
Crush the struggle within
Storming inside
I'm just a liar full Ð¾f shit

Something wild
Something Ñold
For my eyes to bleed
Something bad

Permanently deranged
Dirty creature
Get out of here
Leave it behind
Stucked to break free

I' ve been on the run
I've been there to break it down

I' ve been searching something bad
Wish I had to go somewhere
In my own world you cannot bring me down

Reclaiming the soul
