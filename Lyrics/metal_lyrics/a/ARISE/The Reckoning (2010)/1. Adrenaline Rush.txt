It's the beginning of the end today
I'm wasting my hate for you
Now this is hell
Feel the rush and agression storming upon you
When you're inside there's no way out

I hate you
I will break you down

It's your misery and your world will end
You are dead inside there's no regrets
Blinded by hate and frustration
It's a waste of time
Your final failure will break you down
