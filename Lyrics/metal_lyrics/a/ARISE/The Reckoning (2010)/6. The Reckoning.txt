I am bitter
I' m sick of it all
I will destroy your dreams and bring it back to me
All is gone
I lost it for you there is no excuse
There is no reason for you tÐ¾ beg

I cannot redeem what's in your hands
There is no return
There is no paradise in sight
Everything's lost
Gone for ages
It's a mess without sense
Nothing remains the same

Reaching for my senses
I've become unstable
What goes around fucker
The reckoning
