Spit your blood
Tear out my inside
Cold within
Blackstained mind
What is this?
Dying of the heart
We are going down
The words are spoken now

Your heart is burning
Pulverise inside
The fear of losing all
What is left for you?
Can you explain the reason for you to be?
I am the one you hate
You love to bring me down

Blindead what is the reason to become alive?
Can you tell me what pain I've caused?
In this world I'm blind
