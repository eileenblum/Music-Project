All night long under the stars
What's going on?
It drives you crazy when you hear the sound

He is watching you
It tears your inside
He climbes inside you Ñlose your eyes
Shut op the light and pretend that you are dead
You are trapped in darkness and you cannot escape

So wasted so blind
They take you away
Fall to the ground
They are coming for you

What is left?
what is behind
sleeping through night
the sound the voice you'll never forget
