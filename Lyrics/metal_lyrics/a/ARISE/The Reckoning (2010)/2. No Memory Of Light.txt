Unpleasant touch
Tear out my eyes
Dead awakening
Bloodred mourning
A sense of guilt
Turned upside down
I found myself messed up again
Searching fÐ¾r an alibi but the memory is black
There is no return

In search por something to forget and leave
The story goes on and on
Total eclipse that's all I can see
I just can't tell you why

Still there is no memory of light
And still there is no memory of light

A deadly touch
The feeling gets so strong
Shut of the light
I will not return

No memory
No regrets at all
I will not return
The past is gone

I close the door
Never more
Can this go on like this?
Drowned into darkness I am gone

Rare is the moment now
Primitive mind
Rage through fear
What has been done?
