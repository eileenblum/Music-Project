Lost in a moment
Everything's mine
Wild for the evening
Wild for the night
I'm here to stay and you are my friend
The blackout is coming
But I won't fear the end

This will be the end of days
No tomorrow
Nothing at all
There will be no more light
No more dawn

No limits no regrets
Forget what is next
There is no truth
Prepare for the downfall
The end of it all

When I am dead I will not pretend
Beside there's no truth
