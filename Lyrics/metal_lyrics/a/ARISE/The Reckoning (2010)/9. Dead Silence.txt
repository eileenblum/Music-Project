What a mess
It can't go on like this
What is the reason behind it all?
Lost denied destroyed
For something wicked you scream
Controlled by your thoughts
Moving towards the end
Deep inside your heart

The pain is alive
You are dead inside
The pain is alive
You cannot hide

Watch yourself slowly fading away
Fall to the ground
You are the one you feared to be
Everything is falling apart

Dead silence
Living in fear
