You broke my trust, I wont be able to trust again.
Your not my friend no more, it was all a lie.
You killed her, it does not matter if I pulled the trigger.
You betrayed me with your lust, you took my love.
You killed me and did not realize you killed yourself?
A clever deciever? You're a bug under my boot!

Liar, you broke my confidence.
You sat my world on fire, it has left me scars.
Liar, I thought that you where pure?
I will never learn to trust, anyone again!

I did not want to, but it felt good to unleash my anger.
Revenge, through the barrel of my gun.
She looks so innocent, against the wall in a pool of blood.
I got my revenge but I will forever carry the loss!

I was betrayed.
I feel hollow.
All I had, is now a dream.
LIAR! LIAR! LIAR! LIAR!
