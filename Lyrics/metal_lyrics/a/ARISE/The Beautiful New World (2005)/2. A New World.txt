Cold earth or hot sands,
everywhere you turn is absence of green.
(your skin can no longer save you from the burning sun,
light has become you deadliest enemy).

Welcome to the new world, it's a dead world, what have we done?

Poisoned air and barren lands
you cannot profit from a dying world.
(Man's only hope is to get off this planet
and find new luck in the colonization of space).

Welcome to the new world, it's a dead world, what have we done?
Welcome to the new world, it's a lost world, it may be the only one!

Human greed and human anger has cut down the last remaining tree.
(Where is your promised land?
Your paradise are lost foverever,
everything is buried in this dried out land).

Welcome to the new world, its a dead world, what have we done?
Welcome to the new world, its a lost world, it may be the only one...
...out there.
