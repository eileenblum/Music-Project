You are levatating on your dreams this fashion suit you
because you do not feel real a longing,
a yearning to stand in the lights
I turn on the camera and you give me your life.
And you're willing to pay the price!

How far will you go for money?
(to play the game), how long can you pretend?
All the embarrasing moments
(I feel ashamed), it's so hard to understand.

Humiliation infront of the nation you sit there
crying with standing ovations,
you bite down hard and swallow the pain
and stricktly follow your path to fame.
And you're willing to pay the price!
