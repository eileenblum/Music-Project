Take your time when you move ahead,
systems corrupts you, the bringer of death.
You believe that other souls are fake,
it makes you realise that you cannot be the one you pretend to be!

Darkness or light, you can not decide wich to feed.
Can't turn away from the light or the darkness within.
You try to realize the dreams that cannot be.
You try to scream of love, free you from all fools.
You try to be a lie, a bender of the rules.
Cause inside of you is science worthy gods.

Shifting gears when moving upphill,
they will bring you down, or you'll do it yourself.
You believe in what you do is true,
can't pretend your the center body with the universe circling around you!

Darkness or light, you can not decide wich to feed.
Can't turn away from the light or the darkness within.
You try to realize the dreams that cannot be.
You try to scream of love, free you from all fools.
You try to be a lie, a bender of the rules.
Cause inside of you is science worthy gods.

You try to realize the dreams that cannot be.
You try to scream of love, free you from all fools.
You try to be a lie, a bender of the rules.
Cause inside of you is science worthy gods.
