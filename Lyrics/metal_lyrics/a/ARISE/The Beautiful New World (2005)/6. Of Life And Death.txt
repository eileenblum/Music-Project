This an exploration of the human mind,
a test performed on the missbehaved.
We give you injections and you collect a reward,
where are we going? I guess no one knows.
This is an experiment on the human soul,
a crossbreeding extravaganza.
If you engine is bad we're just tuning it up,
with the use of science we've become gods!

A new religion, gods of the present and future.
We are the new religion, masters of life and death.

Are you ready for your health inspection,
nothing will cure you like a brain injection.
Evolution seems to have stagnated,
we're merely increasing the speed.

A new religion, gods of the present and future.
We are the new religion, masters of life and death.
A new religion...
