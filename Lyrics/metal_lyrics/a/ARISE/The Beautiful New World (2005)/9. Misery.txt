Standing in the pale city lights with an empty street infront of me.
I'm asking myself if I could have done it better, but I do not have the answer!
Do you think that you can change it for the better, well, you are most certainly wrong.
Cause I'm leaving it behind me and I will never, never look back!

Misery, is all I can offer?
Misery, the bitter taste of,
Misery, it's all that I recall.
I can not stand this misery.

I can not wait for death to take me, no, I've made up my mind.
I have walked in misery for far to long now.
Now I'm closing the door.
I have bought my life expensive and it's needless to say that it's killing me.
I guess I chose the wrong currency, and it's to late to trade back.

My skin seems young but my inside feels rotten and my blood is no longer running.
I came in misery and I lived in shame, now I leave in the way I came.
