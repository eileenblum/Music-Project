I stand here working, chained to the ground to make my bed and hope to survive.
My body hurts and my stomach turns and that's the way
I feel about you too.
Suffer... Suffer...
Bigger pockets needs bigger money.
What is it worth to you?
A worn-out man for a shimmering gold coin?
If you work harder you'll get a reward â like what... a broken back?
Suffer... Suffer...

Capitalistic, materialistic!
You only profit on our misery.
Capitalistic, materialistic!
A sacrifice gives a cheaper price.

You keep on pushing it harder and harder
until we hang from a rope in the ceeling.
You ruining lives to fill you pockets
I guess where just to stupid to realize!
Suffer... Suffer...
Bigger pockets needs bigger money.
