You know what's coming to you, you will never grow old.
Even in freezing temperature you will never feel cold.
Time is just a word, it has lost it's effect.

Cybernetic replacements is an upcoming trend.
Can you tell me there's no danger in uploading new software to your brain?

When we no longer feel no pain, have we lost the ability to love?
Can you tell me what we are made of, what are you made of?

Inject the machine... Inject the machine... Inject... Inject the machine...
You connect to the machine, is this what you planned?
Is this your dream?
You can no longer dream!
