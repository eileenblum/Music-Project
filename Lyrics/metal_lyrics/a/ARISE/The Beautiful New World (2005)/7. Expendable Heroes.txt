Listen citizens we are on the verge of war,
I will never let my empire fall.
Gather your swords and shields,
as long as I live my empire stands!
Protect the elite, protect the money.
Protect the elite, a hammerblow on the economy.

Children watching the sun descend,
dreaming away to an happy end.

Old men and women marching out into the minefields.
Waiting for the first one to explode.
Take a way the bodies and we got a clear road.
Protect the elite, protect the money.
Protect the elite a hammerblow on the economy.
Listen children you will be my army,
the greatest game you've ever played.
You are no heroes, you are slaves to the dollar sign.
Protect the elite, protect the money.
Protect the elite a hammerblow on the economy.

Children watching the sun descend,
dreaming away to an happy end.
Children watching the sun descend, children...
