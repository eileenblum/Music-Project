We have gathered specimen for ages, the genetic structure of earth, our work 
is nearly complete, we have the maps and where to begin.
We have technology far more sophisticated than you can ever imagine.
You still don't believe, but we made a mistake in 1947.

Chorus; You fools! You believe it's a lie, you don't know that you're all 
about to die, you dismiss it like it's science fiction, the time has come, 
your time is up.
Your time is up...

We can now begin our recreation of earth, to suit our needs, another world 
to consume.

[Chorus x2]
You fools! You believe it's a lie, you don't know that you're all 
about to die, you dismiss it like it's science fiction, the time has come, 
your time is up.

We got earth, wind, fire and ice, all we need now is a human life.
Our machines are constantly online, awating the perfect one.
We have operated well hidden from the world, maybe it's time to oncloak our 
ships, a grand welcome, a celebration, while you watch our cannons take aim.

[Chorus x2]
You fools! You believe it's a lie, you don't know that you're all 
about to die, you dismiss it like it's science fiction, the time has come, 
your time is up.
Your time is up...
