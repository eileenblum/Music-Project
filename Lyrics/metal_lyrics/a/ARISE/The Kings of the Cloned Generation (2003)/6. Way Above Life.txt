Electronical a future failure, biomechanical life for hire.
In our minds there's something missing now, though our bodies look exactly 
the same, in our veins runs no blood no more.
Hydrolic pumps keep the machinery at GO!

[Chorus x2]
It's way above life, look at the beast that you have bred.
It's a beautiful child... yet it's biomech.

Electronical a future failure, biomechanical life for hire.
A bidding price for optimal complexity, mechanical child we will never see it grow.
A faster race don't try to hide your number.
Oh, don't you know that your life is not real.

[Chorus x4]
It's way above life, look at the beast that you have bred. It's a 
beautiful child... yet it's biomech.
