You accomplished nothing and now it's to late, you chose wich game to play 
and now it's game over.

[Chorus]
Your mind is divided and you have lost your shell, you soul is 
corroding and the torch is ready to burn.

You try to understand what is goin on, try to open your eyes and move your hands.
The bright light is hurting your eyes and yet you think that you are still 
in the real world.

[Chorus x2]
Your mind is divided and you have lost your shell, you soul is 
corroding and the torch is ready to burn.

Absolute silence, so god damn cold, your life is history but the world grows older.
Your life flashes before your eyes, you see your body floating away.

[Chorus x2]
Your mind is divided and you have lost your shell, you soul is 
corroding and the torch is ready to burn.
