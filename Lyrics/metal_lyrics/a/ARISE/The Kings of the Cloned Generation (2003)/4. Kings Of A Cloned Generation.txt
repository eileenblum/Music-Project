-Dad, I want you to make me one. I'm feeling restless and bored.
-Sure son, I'll give you a private whore, but don't come asking for more.

[Chorus]
Designed perfection to suit all demands, bred by my hands to obey my commands.
Inherit the throne, king of a cloned generation, let's inherit our throne, 
kings of a human creation.

Can you make me another one, I'm already tired of the first one.
Let me have my own kingdom of slaves, to be the puppeteer who pulls the 
strings.

[Chorus]
Designed perfection to suit all demands, bred by my hands to obey my commands.
Inherit the throne, king of a cloned generation, let's inherit our throne, 
kings of a human creation.

Pain... built in our DNA. I will stand among the gods, what has been made 
can easily be unmade.

[Chorus]
Designed perfection to suit all demands, bred by my hands to obey my 
commands. Inherit the throne, king of a cloned generation, let's inherit our 
throne, kings of a human creation. Inherit the throne, king of a cloned 
generation, let's inherit our throne, kings of a human creation.
