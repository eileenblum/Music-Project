This was once a beautiful place, but now it's dead, we killed it long ago.
With dusted eyes and dry mouths we are trying to survive.
We're exposed to the nuclear sun, can't breathe in the sour air and all 
water is almost gone, the earth has been dried out. We are the last species 
left, our planet laid to waste.
With dusted eyes and dry mouths we are trying to survive.

[Chorus x3]
There is a virus spreading in my veins, it's to late to cure me.
I'm mutating anyway, contaminated, nuclear ray infected.
It's to late, we can't turn the time back.
