Late hours, in the bleak flourocent light, a glimpse of the future.
Icarus succeds, the laboratory's cleansing, quiet calm.
Reality seems far away and drifting further.

[Chorus]
I lie to hide from my pain, sickened, weakened, frightened one.
I tried to be the master of gravity, but I came down with a smash of 
reality.

Long hours of experiments on my body, an attemt to shake the history of 
science.

[Chorus]
I lie to hide from my pain, sickened, weakened, frightened one.
I tried to be the master of gravity, but I came down with a smash of 
reality.

Lost... in my fictionary mind, a freak to the world and my wings has been cut.
My wings has been cut!

[Chorus x2]
I lie to hide from my pain, sickened, weakened, frightened one.
I tried to be the master of gravity, but I came down with a smash of 
reality.
