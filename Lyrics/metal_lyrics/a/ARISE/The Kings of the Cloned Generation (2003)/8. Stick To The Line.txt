Breathing fire, our hollow eyes are blind.
These poisoned wells are keeping our throaths dry.
We seek freedom while we hang in chains, can't think clearly.
We've got splinters in our minds.

[Chorus]
We run because we don't know how to hide, the sun sends flares into 
our eyes.

It is suicide to walk out of the line, only headless beasts will come back 
alive.

[Chorus]
We run because we don't know how to hide, the sun sends flares into 
our eyes.

We got rats chewing on our bones, pushed to the ground, stabbed in the back.
We're not able to make any restistance, once again we're nailed upon the cross.
No more lies... humanity dies.
