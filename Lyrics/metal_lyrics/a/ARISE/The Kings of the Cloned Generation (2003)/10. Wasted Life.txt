A poisoned tongue, home of perverted lies.
Bloodfilled lungs, exhausted by your lust to sacrifice.
Religion, wield the axe of god, release the beast and it will your prey.
Hate, it drives you. Hate, controls your fate and keeps your life in pain.
Power, released by your misleading gods, (a) servant, but high above the rest.
Only one don't need a sect to conquer, expose my flaws and you will bite my 
head off.

[Chorus]
Life, wasted life. In your life, pain is all there is.
Your faith in god will be the knife in you heart, resigned.
You're chained to your belief, give up! Leave your twisted bible, kneel at 
the altar.
I'll relive you of your head.
Hate, it drives you.
Hate, controls your fate and keeps your life in pain.

[Chorus]
Life, wasted life. In your life, pain is all there is.
Hate, it drives you.
Hate, controls your fate and keeps your life in pain.

[Chorus]
Life, wasted life. In your life, pain is all there ever was.
