Turn the sail after the wind, you take the easy way out.
Make the trend to your believe, a follower in all needs.
Your lack of independence shows your real face, a wannabe.
Why do you refuse to see?

[Chorus]
You hide your face in your hands, your life is a delusion!

Scared to face reality, you wear your mask.
How can you still your hunger?
This way you never will.

[Chorus]
You hide your face in your hands, your emotions are flattening.
You're running cowardly with the herd, your life is a delusion!

If god were (in) you'd be a priest. It's your soul that's leaking, ever 
wanted to be a leader?
This way out you'll never win!

[Chorus]
You hide your face in your hands, your emotions are flattening.
You are running cowardly with the herd, your life is a delusion!
