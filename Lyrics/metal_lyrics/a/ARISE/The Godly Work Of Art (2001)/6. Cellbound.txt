Fear of living - Afraid of dying, I fall deeper into my insanity.
Tied to the ground by the chains of this life. I'm doing my time, I'm doing 
my time!

[Chorus]
Screaming inside of my cell, burning in my personal hell. I must be 
set free cause I'm burning up inside, this cage is far to small to find a 
place to hide!

Trying to find a way out, trapped in this cage forever more.
Spellbound by my own little demon.
I'm doing my time, I'm doing my time!

[Chorus x 2]
Screaming inside of my cell, burning in my personal hell. I must 
be set free cause I'm burning up inside, this cage is far to small to find a 
place to hide!

I'm cellbound, I'm cellbound. I'm cellbound.
