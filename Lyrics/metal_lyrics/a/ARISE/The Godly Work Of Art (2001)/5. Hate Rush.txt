Freedom with a gunshot wound, you like to take it.
Know what your pay is for, ever tasted?
The pounding breath of war, don't you feel it?
The hatred's turned on you. The hatred's turned on you!
The hatred grows in you! You're a freak, just like others.
But you are weak, to break the strings that holds you. You would like to 
have it.
The strength to control all, don't you know it. The target is aimed at 
you. The target is aimed at you! You are the target now!

[Chorus]
You need to feel it, adrenaline rush of war. You need to feed it, 
the need to hate some more.

You feel your wings are spreading out, a sense of freedom.
You feel gods hands reaching down, you're a believer.
Reason, Over control. Can't find you heaven, and let your har ashore.
You like to hate us, this time you'll flood us all. We all know it.
This time you will lose control, this time you loose it all!

[Chorus]
You need to feel it, adrenaline rush of war. You need to feed it, 
the need to hate some more.
