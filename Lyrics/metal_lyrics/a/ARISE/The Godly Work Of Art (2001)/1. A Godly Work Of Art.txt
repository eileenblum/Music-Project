Welcome to my exhibition, welcome to my hell, upon the altar lies my human 
sacrifice, distorted images I hunt to find.

[Chorus]
One final body to finish up the artwork, violent art, the darker part.
New murder, new painting, it never gets done, heavy murders - a godly work 
of art.

Colors created by blood, murder - I'm in it for the art, my sick brain eats me.
I'm feeding it with pain, my treasures I hide, but from myself I cannot run.

[Chorus x2]
One final body to finish up the artwork, violent art, the darker part.
New murder, new painting, it never gets done, heavy murders - a godly work 
of art.
