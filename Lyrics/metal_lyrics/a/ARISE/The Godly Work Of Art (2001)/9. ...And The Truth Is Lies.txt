Lock me up from the rest of the world but I'm alive inside my head. Never to 
tell the world what went wrong, only to save themselves.
Ahostile humanity, they make the truth, but the truth is lie.

[Chorus]
Unleash a lie that will hold me down.
They pin me down with their demon eyes, the truth is lie, and will never let 
me out.

I'm an experiment, a failure of science, hidden from the world.
My world is in me, inside these walls, at least I'm not immortal, the truth 
lies buried within me.
They make the truth, but the truth is lie.

[Chorus]
Unleash a lie that will hold me down.
They pin me down with their demon eyes, the truth is lie, and will never let 
me out.

...and yet I'm not dead... ...I wish I was...
I do not exist, I do not live, don't even know if this is real.
I do not exist, I do not live. I would rather die.
