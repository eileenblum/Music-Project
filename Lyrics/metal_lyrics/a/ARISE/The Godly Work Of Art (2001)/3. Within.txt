I feel the shivers running down my spine, it wakes the powers of my 
undivine.
My mind betrays me I'm leaping back in time.
All those memories left behind, In the torture chamber where I lived to be:
All my purity is left in greed. Can't take control, my ego burns me out, 
everything seems so faded now.

[Chorus]
I've seen it, believed it, but deep inside I know that something is wrong.
I've been it, I've lived it but now I know - my schizophrenia is gone.

Feels like I'm trapped between two worlds, the doors are locked in either 
ways, I can hear my echo but there are no walls.
A sick brain in a tortured host.

[Chorus]
I've seen it, believed it, but deep inside I know that something is wrong.
I've been it, I've lived it but now I know - my schizophrenia is gone.

But I have kept talking, not a soul is listening but me, starving inside, 
dreaming of life.
Is my soul at a restingpoint?
Feels like I'm being torn apart.
