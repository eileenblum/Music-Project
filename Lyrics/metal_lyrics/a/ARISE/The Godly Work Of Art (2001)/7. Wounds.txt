I run to hide from myself but I can't stray from the path. I hide, in my 
dreams I'm free to cleanse my guilt...
Bleeding, I search deep in my mind to find the answers... to satisfy.
I need my fuel injection to get the needles deeper within, my wounds are 
turning inside-out, I need to get out of this body.
I fight a battle within me, to loose is to die and to win is to loose. I lie 
to myself and to others, a perfect life... -yeah, a perfect lie.
I smile but inside I'm drowning, I hold my breath as I slip away, I burn, my 
veins are on fire.
A burning pleasure, a deadly lust, my wounds are turning inside out.
I need to get out of this body!

[Chorus]
There's a shadow following me, I feel the walls cave in behind me, I 
am a shadow of my former self. I've trapped myself in this shell of guilt.

I search deep in my mind to find the answers... to satisfy. I need my fuel 
injection to get the needles deeper within, the room keeps spinning 
faster... faster.
No more waiting, no more hiding. This time my dreams will last forever, my 
wounds are turning inside out. I need to get out of this body!

[Chorus]
There's a shadow following me, I feel the walls cave in behind me, I 
am a shadow of my former self. I am trapped in this hell I've built.
