What do we know about our past? Abducted souls in a cold scipt-stone.
Buildings, structures - visions or insanity? A past abducted?

[Chorus]
Our past abducted, vanished in the ruins! Our past rejected, a 
greater mind disconnected!

Knowledge, intelligence selflearned and forgotten, ancient scripts of a 
future civilasation?
Heyroglyphes speaking of forgotten intelligence, a past rejected?
Our past forgotten - abducted intelligence!?

[Chorus]
Our past abducted, vanished in the ruins! Our past rejected, a 
greater mind disconnected!

Are you afraid of what the truth might say?
To dig up science instead of graves?
Supreme intelligence greater than all, our past reflected?

[Chorus]
Our past abducted, vanished in the ruins! Our past rejected, a 
greater mind disconnected.
