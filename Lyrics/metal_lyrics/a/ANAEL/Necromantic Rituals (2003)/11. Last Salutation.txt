Nothing will last forever
and only memories remain
of a cursed existence
tied to the chains of time.

Tired of the unpromising struggle
for a life of endless sufferings.
Oh glorious defeat, end of all
sickness born with this life.

Rule in silence, beyond the grave.
Our solemn vigil shall forever ...
remind.

No longer enslaved by your body
passed to the parallel world
where the past is the future
where absurd forms drown undefinable lights

Farewell to those we miss
until our path may cross again
running the penitent circle
at the pale reflection of a new dawn
