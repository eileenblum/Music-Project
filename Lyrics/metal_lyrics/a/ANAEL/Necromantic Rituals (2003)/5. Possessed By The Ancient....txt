Afar beyond the reign of life
in a land of endless shadow
where His spirit rules the silence
we dive into obscurity

Led by the sweetest melody,
prepared for our darkest journey
to the lost temples
to a long forgotten past

Following the morbid attraction
Trapped by His sinister call
Our force becomes alive again
Everyone carries the seed

Let it be reborn

Ancient consecration by blood
cleans from the wounds of the living
Servants of the older cults
be purified by this sacred fluid

Walk the blackened path
to get the answers
about the mystified powers
of life and death
