Judgement, the time is to arrive
Apocalypse, the world requests for
a renewal ... in chaos
The circle now is closed, finally
as from the depth of her abyssic womb
shall rise the vomit of the earth
ascending the grave of a coming past

Revelation,
pronounced by a sonic holocaust
Heir to the throne
of the blind creator
raze this timeworn earth

The circle now is closed, finally
as from the depth of her abyssic womb
shall rise the vomit of the earth
ascending the grave of a coming past

Monarch of the final war
rise to take the throne of the beast

Martyrs of the wicked path
hear the chime of the damned
for the day of wrath has commeth
Now end and beginning are one
