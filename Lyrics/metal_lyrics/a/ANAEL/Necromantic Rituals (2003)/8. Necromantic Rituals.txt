A secret place, flamed by one light
the sacrifice lies upon the altar
Silence is torn by a sonorous voice
as the priest begins with the ceremony

I evoke you, father of the gods
I call you, creature of the dark, with the works of darkness
I call you, creature of hate, with the works of hatred
I call you, creature of pain, with the works of pain

After a sleep of thousand years
in the buried city of Sodom
from an everlasting dream of sin
I summon your spirit of wisdom

Open your eyes, to regard a new light

Open your ears, to listen to the master's voice

Knowledge, lost for the masses
resting beneath the dust of ages
kept by the spirit of the graves
for the few who dare to search
