Lucifer, father of the doom

He is darkness, he is light
He is our shelter from the world of ignorance
He is our sword in the war for freedom

He is death, he is birth
He is hate, he is victory
He is our passion for the absurd dreams
He is our way through a life of emptiness

He is the shine of silver,
he is the gold of spirit

Avenger of the executed
Mason of our fortune
Key of the invisible
Reason of our search

He is scorn, he is justice
He is the flame of the fire of truth
He is the symbol of our eternal resistance

Blind our enemies, light our path
Guide our soul into infinity

We are his glory, he is our triumph
