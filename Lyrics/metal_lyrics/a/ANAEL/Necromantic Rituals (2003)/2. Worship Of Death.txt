Man, do you really think,
you can withstand the hate in my eyes?
Oh man, do you believe,
that your life will last,
when time has come?
Man, can you surpass the sound
of my voice from the grave?
Are you ready to behold
my cruel mysteries on the other side?

For my name is the fire, that burns your sanity,
the word that evokes your deepest horrors
I am the poison from the cauldron of evil
I am the cold shimmer on the knife's blade
I am the shadow that makes you scream at night
I am the merciless ghost that solves all oppositions

Man, where is your god now,
as my freezing hand clasps for your skin?
Can you remember
my black face from your nightmares?
