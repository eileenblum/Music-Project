Within me, the force slowly swells,
poises my heart with fervour, wearing down the walls of reason

the serpent rises it's head

Kundalini, force and fire are ours
No remorse shall soil my self

Union with the coiled beast,

who dwells under my skin,
master of eternally twisted creation,
who floats through my veins

Now arise, ancient worm,
take me away from this coffin

Nothing can be lost, when all is sacrificed
for the glory of such impulse
Seed of the sinful inspiration of man
work aour will upon my flesh

For evil knows no boundaries
no doubt shall chain my actions
