Enemies of the absurd rules
Prisoners of life's torments
Summoned to celebrate our death
be my fellows tonight

Kneel around the circle
Adore the sign of the pentagram
Praise the eternal unknown
Unite with His essence

We deny their illusions
for death is our birth

Key to the profound knowledge
source of hidden powers
end of fear and hope

Into the dark we wander
into the womb of death
to be one with emptiness

Into the silent kingdom
of our souls' abyss
to face the black
