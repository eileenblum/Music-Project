Illusions waged a war on me for aeons
but swords I've forged
to cut those traitors' tongues
I travelled forth on furious storms,
on wings of living silver
to find the absolute truth
I looked behind the masks of men
but nothing have I found
to quench the ceaseless thirst
Swords stabbed those enemies of old
and destroyed all their world in fire...
