Where silence echoes... endlessly
On petals I'm enthroned and a finger seals my lip
Shells hide my kingdom from dead stares of the profane

[Refrain:]
Here is no place for vultures' sateless cries
for perishable treasure
A lair, so sombre and arcane, for those enstranged
by this world
A darkness deep within that shines in every colour and
speaks in tongues of silver
There dwell the great of all times in eternity like
coined in stone with golden lines

Where history is not just dead words
sealed in ancient books
But breathes pestilence upon the ones
who just forgot
And don't remember those forsaken
giant's sleeping
I still can see their causeways
gleaming through the twilight

[Refrain]

Where silence echoes... thundering
