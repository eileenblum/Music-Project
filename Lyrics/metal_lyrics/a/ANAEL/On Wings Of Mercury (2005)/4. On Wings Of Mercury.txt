"Let us celebrate the rites of mercury!"
As above, so below - as below, so above
Hail thee, Oh thrice great, thou divine messenger
We call thee, Tahuti
Hail thee, Oh thrice born, evoker of the souls
We call thee, Mercury
First of the Aeons, who bearest the two serpents entwined
Emerald, Ibis-head, who commeth forth from beyond the veil
Wisdom crowned overseer, open the eightfold seal
Thee I invoke, elevate us on flashing wings of fire
"Behold, I am yesterday, today and the brother of the Morrow!"
As above, so below - as below, so above
I am the charioteer of the east, lord of past and future
I company the sun through the darkness of night
I am the keeper of knowledge, flame of universal mind
I descend upon the sea from the sphere of the crown
I am the word made flesh, invisible spark divine
I received the key to immortality in Amenti's dark halls
Hail thee, Oh thrice great, thou ever-laughing one
We call thee, Tahuti
Hail thee, Oh thrice born, voice from the silence
We call thee, Mercury
"And this word I speak unto ye:..."
