I call the heralds guarding the watchtower looming in the east
Geniis of the air, governed by Paralda, obey at my command
I call the raging winds to obtain their unbridled strength
Bringers of dawn, who emanate from the house of the rising sun

[Refrain:]
Swords, arrows, daggers to pierce the veil
Words, spells, songs to break the seal
Dig a tomb in the skies, for my soul to plunge
and to unfurl in visions so pure
Spinning and whirling, the sylphs, they are stirring
the dust of the aeons once more
Swords, arrows, daggers to pierce the veil
Words, spells, songs to break the seal
Thrust open the doors of narrowed perception
that conceal the awareness path
Chasing and leaping with ghosts, I am sweeping
my mind from shards of stained glass

I breathe in to wake the force of the four winds within
Storms, who roam at the gate of a magickal dawn
I breathe out and play everlasting the mesmerizing pipes
Leading the children of reason into their silent graves
Diving into the blue tattvic circle
the tower points the ascension way
All-pervading there resounds my cry
in solitude, a hunting bird of prey

[Refrain]
