Scarlet Tum drowns beneath the horizon
my eyes behold the northern sky
by the sign of silence, I bow my head
visualizing the black god's icon
Lying down on the temple's floor
submission to matter's reality
Accepting death, to descend, to seek
the hidden stone of immortality
Osiris, is a black god!
Osiris, is a black god!
I'm putrified, solved and torn by the demons
Initiated, transmutated by the most secret mysteries
Where in obscurity float, the waters of the past
my soul shall be purified, recomposed at last
ascending from this tomb, by the rite of the passage
receiving eternal life, from the light of the second sun
