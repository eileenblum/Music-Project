I was incomplete - until I found you satellite!!
Growed in disbelief - Sputnik launch changed everything
Soon, they will be dropping - bombs on us from space everyday
But what was scared and cold - with your help fades away

The long awaited flight - cause only love can last
Remember the profound shock - for present, future, past

Flying high - for the stars
Tell the world - Come me (Commie) sky
we hope you - knows enough
On the ball - to get us

Flying high - little ship
With made-in-moscow beep

King of the sky - within temptation
I build, you pay - new democracy
Still have, no way - idly desires
Ignorant lust - by soviet lair

All day in my head sputnik falling
I don't want to set the world skying
Racing for power and all dying
Rising new era - soviet general!!

Flying high - for the stars
Tell the world - come me (commie) sky
we hope you - knows enough
On the ball - to get us

King of the sky - within temptation
I build, you pay - new democracy
