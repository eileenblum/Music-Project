Who do you want
Who do you want be today
Do you see reality around you
Turn on TV
What the fuck does it mean
Cut the line and try find the truth
Who cares the hate
Is what you preach
It is fine to say what do you think
Trying to get control of you
So many years
So many time with you
Don't want to loose
My claim to prove
Salvation that fools us all
Right to choose independence
Right to choose king for mass
Fight for own morality
Republic - kiss my ass
I've lost all control over
My trust you have defied
Save yourself espendable
My life still in decline
Salvation that fools us all
Who cares the hate is what you preach
It is fine to say what do you think
Trying to get control of you
Right to choose independence
Right to choose king for mass
Fight for own morality
