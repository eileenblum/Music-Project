We shall see the communism
We shall throughout the world
We shall see the foundation
World federative republic if soviets

Today - will take me to heaven
Today - will be the first
You say - Russia forever
We show you soon does God not exist

Go to race
Find in space
Among the stars so far
And cold you seem so all alone

First space man
Check again
All sign in cosmos
Says that God is not exist

Second way
Dream and pray
This was once the land of dreams
Now these dreams have turned to greed

Soviet dream
Gagarin!

Can't forget, can't forgive - commune
Bullets, Racist and Duma

Gagarin go
Soviet dream

Don't look past
All of us
Keep in believe in technological think

Soviet dream
Gagarin!
There is no God in stars
Everywhere Russians arms

We shall see the communism
We shall throughout the world
We shall see the foundation
World federative republic if soviets
