Prejudice with no belief
Travelling through the time
Expressing my aggression
It's been a painful way

I've seen sickness power
The highest price to pay
Only small naked cowards
No longer aren't the same

Strike us
But we will not divide
War
Time will come to war
Strike us
But we will not divide
War
Destroy

When the war began
Bombs fell down as rain
Buried dead again
Holding our flag

Strike us
But we will not divide
War
Time will come to war
Strike us

All over the world the association of communists is growing
In a number of countries soviet power has already triumphed
Soon we shall see the victory of communism through the world

Prejudice with no belief
Travelling through the time
Expressing my aggression
It's been a painful way

I've seen sickness power
The highest price to pay
Only small naked cowards
No longer aren't the same
