[Ãjszaka]

"Ãtok legyen rajtad
Fekete rossz Ã¡tok
SzÃ­ved keserÅ±bb legyen
Mint fÃ¡jdalmat okozÃ³ mÃ¡sod
ElmÃ©dben a kÃ­gyÃ³ lakassa jÃ³l magÃ¡t
A lÃ©t ne legyen szÃ¡modra
Csak Ã¶rÃ¶k Ã¼res homÃ¡ly"

"Let curse be on thee
Black, malicious curse
Let thy heart be more bitter
Then thy harming self
Let the serpent be fed in your mind
Let not thy being he else
Than twilight eternal and void..."

The sky has opened for the rays of the torches
Four signs have awakened the nature from the sleep
Coldness have walked through the stars
By dead leaves we have signed the past

The sky
Clear and calm
Carving wrath
And desolation now
