I had a dream about an age
Stepping out from shadow.
Spelled words glowing in my eye
About the ecstasy of depth,
Far in the rootsof the trees.

My blindness was conducted by my steps and worships.
My dawn-instincs called my attention.
Soon blood springs out, the heathen devotion.
The spirit of the vale is wakening,
The olds in it chop the throat of life for ever.

We erect a fortress around the dead mountain,
Bury the past and throw sparks at the birth of the blade.
We wake up past ages
And devotion will be back with as.

Red wildness, a home of the universe
Breaks off his chains for ever
And fire awakens in the lakes.
