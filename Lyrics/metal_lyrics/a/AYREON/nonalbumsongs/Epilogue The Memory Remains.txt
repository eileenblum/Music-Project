emotions, thus ensuring that the spirit of man will live on. In the end,
Mankind's brief existence has served a purpose after all.]

[a. Epilogue]

[b. The Memory Remains]

And in the end
when all the dreams are dreamt
All your desires have long dissolved
A feeling free, surreal serenity
A desperate search
for truth resolved

All hope dispelled,
forgotten dreams unquelled
The frailest link within the chain
Once brisk with life,
too fragile to survive
A barren world devoid fo pain...
but the memory remains

Starlight breaks,
the sleeper is awake
You understand your timeless quest
A dormant race,
a cold forsaken place
Their bodies numb,
their minds suppressed

You felt the screams,
you have dreamt the dreams
But most of all you lived the pain
They will revive,
you will make the thrive
Your hopeless lives not lived in vain...
for the memory remains

Can you feel them cry inside,
can you feel them die inside,
You can still the screams in you,
you can make their dreams come true

Remeber forever? (forever?, forever?...)
