Cries from the grave resound in my ears
They hail from beyond my darkest fears
Faces of the past are etched in my brain
The women I raped, the men I've slain

Shades of the dead are sliding on the wall
Demons dance in the castle hall

I call upon the sword, the mighty Excalibur
Grant me the skill to fulfill my quest
I call upon my king and the knights of the table round
Grant me the courage to stand to this test
I call upon the seer, Merlin the sorcerer
Grant me the magic to end my pain
I call upon the spirit that lives in a noble heart
Grant me the passion that's within my veins

Shades of the dead are sliding on the wall
Demons dance in the castle hall
