The Eye Of The Universe

A dark sphere surrounds us
Surreal...oblivious...
In the center of the galaxy
A hidden force has found us
Powerful...mysterious...
At the boundary of eternity

Nothing escapes, not even light
Beyond the mystical horizon
We surrender to its might
Gazing into the eye of the universe

A deep roar is sounding
Deafening...thunderous...
As if the universe were crying
My heart is pounding
Frantic...delirious...
My every nerve is dying

Halo Of Darkness

I hear screams of fallen souls, sad cries of agony
Within the void of this evil hole, deep inside the black

Could it be my imagination, the mirror of my fantasy?
A fear-induced hallucination
Or is there no way back from the halo of darkness?

Spirits - apparitions - misery - suffering
Horrid dreams and dire visions rising up from the black

Look away in disbelief, this cannot be happening
The end has come, I bow in grief
There is no way back from the halo of darkness

The Final Door

Now silence devours us
Massive...suffocating...
The calm before the storm
Gravity overpowers us
Invincible...dominating...
And leads us through the final door

Feed me light, I'm the halo of darkness
Feel my might, I'm the eye of the universe
