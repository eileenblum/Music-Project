[A. Eyes of time]

IT SLOWLY DAWNS ON AYREON THAT THESE VISIONS HE IS EXPERIENCING
ARE VISIONS OF THE FUTURE BUT HE DOES NOT FULLY COMPREHEND
THEIR IMPORTANCE YET.

[AYREON:]
I cannot see with these eyes
my world is dark
like a cold eternal night

I could not tell you no lies
my words are lost
in a shroud of mysery

[VILLAGERS:]
tell me what you see
[AYREON:]
I cannot tell you now
I see the world through the eyes of time
[VILLAGERS:]
tell me what you feel
[AYREON:]
I wouldn't know how
I cannot free my mind
from the eyes of time

I do not know where I am
I'm lost in time
drifting in eternity

I cannot tell if it's real
or fantasy
or a view of things to come

I'm still trying to understand
why do I see the things I see
could it be a future world
that's warning us through me
I'm still trying to understand
why do I know the things I know
doe it mean I'm a god
will nobody tell me so?

[B. Brainwaves]

IT ALL GETS TOO CONFUSING FOR AYREON AND THE THIN LINE BETWEEN
ILLUSION AND REALITY FADES.
