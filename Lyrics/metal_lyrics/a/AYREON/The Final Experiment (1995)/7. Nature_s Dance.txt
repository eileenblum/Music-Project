AYREON RETIRES IN THE GARDEN OF DREAMS SURROUNDING CAMELOT,
ENJOYS THE WONDERS OF NATURE AND REFLECTS ON HIS FATE.
HE NOW FULLY UNDERSTANDS, AND RELUCTANTLY SUBMITS TO HIS DESTINY.

[AYREON:]
I can smell the grass
and touch the flowers
among the trees
I pass the hours
and fantasize
I let the dance of nature
inspire me
now my mind is free
from apparitions
I switch off like a 'television'
and close my eyes

and I wish that I could see
like everybody can
how I wish that I could be
like any other man

I can't see the sun
but I sense its glow
I hear the sound of water flowing
down the stream
and my heart cries out
for a little bit love
but I know that it was not meant to be
so I'll fulfil my destiny
and accept my fate

still I wish that I could see
like everybody can
how I wish that I could be
like any other man

THE TIME HAS COME FOR AYREON TO SET ABOUT HIS MISSION.
HE SINGS ABOUT THREE MAIN CAUSES OF THE EARTH'S EVENTUAL DESTRUCTION.
