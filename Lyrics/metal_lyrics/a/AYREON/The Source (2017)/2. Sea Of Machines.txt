[The Chemist:]
The 'Frame is running all our systems, no way to shut it down
Outcries of panic in the distance, fear... all around

[The Diplomat:]
No satellites, no radio, no TV, I can't even use my phone
We need to wake up from this bad dream, we're not alone!

[The Prophet:]
I've seen the future in a dream
I've seen a sea of machines
I've seen a realm beneath the waves
Another time, another space

[The Chemist:]
The 'Frame is closing all the channels, isolated from the world

[The Diplomat:]
But there's still time to heal the damage and lift this curse

[The Counselor:]
You need to reach beyond your fear
You need to stand your ground and fight
If we're to make it out of here
If we're to leave Alpha alive

[The Captain:]
I can sail us to the skies 
I can fly us to the stars
I won't allow our race to die
I'll never leave you in the dark

[The President:]
I'll find a way to save our kind 
After all I am to blame
Just follow me, and I will guide
And I'll release us from the 'Frame

[The Chemist:]
The 'Frame is cutting off the power, we're stranded in the dark

[The Diplomat:]
It won't help to hide away like cowards, make a brand new start!

[The Prophet:]
I see a comet cleave the sky
In a time beyond time
I see a realm beneath the waves
I see a castle, a castle deep in space
On the edge of time!
