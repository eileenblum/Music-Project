[The President:]
It's time to awaken, the journey's almost done
The quest is over, a new one's begun
And when we reach our destination, our lives won't be the same
We're on our own now and free of the 'Frame

[The Captain:]
We're closing in on Sirrah's halo
Behold the glow of our new sun
An arc of light, a cosmic rainbow

[The Captain and The Biologist:]
But far beyond, buried in space
I hear the death cry of a race

[The Opposition Leader:]
Alpha is shattered, their suffering is done
The trial is over and nobody's won
We've got a brand new world at our disposal
This time we'll do it right, we're starting over and no one will die!

[The Counselor and The Biologist:] 
Time halts as we yearn for the fallen, souls weep as we grieve for the dead
Hearts bleed as we cry our last goodbye, in our hearts they will never die

[The Preacher:]
Fa kaala falyakon nur fa kena nur

[The Counselor and The Biologist:]
Fire dies as we mourn for the perished, love drowns as we ache for the lost
Life stops as we cry our last goodbye, in our hearts they will never die

[The Biologist:] Oh, I can see our future star
[The Opposition Leader:] We're closing in on Sirrah's halo
[The Biologist:] I can feel the force within her heart
[The Opposition Leader:] Behold the glow of our new sun
[The Biologist:] I can feel her rays caress my skin 
[The Opposition Leader:] An arc of light, a cosmic rainbow
[The Biologist:] I can feel her power draw me in

[The Opposition Leader and The Biologist:]
But far beyond, buried in space
I hear the death cry of a race
