[The Historian:]
I can't believe it really happened, it's all slowly sinking in
I left behind a hopeless race to fight a war they cannot win

[The Chemist:]
My petty life, it seems so trivial, a whole world is about to die
If all those billions fade away, then who am I... to stay alive

[The Historian:] Condemned to live, doomed to leave my world to die
[The Chemist:] The guilt weighs heavy on my mind 
[The Historian:] Trapped in this void, deprived of dignity and joy 
[The Chemist:] Their secret hopes and dreams destroyed

[The Diplomat:] We're about to start our journey, so focus on what lies ahead 
[The Chemist:] Liquid Eternity
[The Diplomat:] We have the chance to save our future, we're alive, the past is dead
[The Chemist:] The Source will set us free
[The Diplomat:] We need to find a way to thrive there, preservation of our race
[The Chemist:] Liquid Eternity
[The Diplomat:] An alteration, gene mutation, transformation of our strain
[The Chemist:] The Source will set us free

[The Counselor:] 
Condemned to live, doomed to leave our world to die
The guilt weighs heavy on our mind 
Trapped in this void, deprived of dignity and joy 
Their secret hopes and dreams destroyed

[The Opposition Leader:] Condemned to live, doomed to leave our world to die
[The Biologist:] A fate we could not avoid
[The Opposition Leader:] The guilt weighs heavy on our minds 
[The Biologist:] But we had no other choice
[The Opposition Leader:] Trapped in this void, deprived of joy 
[The Biologist:] Now we need to think of ourselves
[The Opposition Leader:] Their secret hopes and dreams destroyed
[The Biologist:] We need to break out of this hell!
