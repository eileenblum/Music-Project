[The Counselor:]
I drift above the clouds, upon the veil of a dream
I reach out to touch the planets, something beautiful evolves 
Then the dream dissolves

[The Biologist:]
I float beneath the tides, upon the crest of a dream
In a world of hope and wonder, something magical evolves 
Then the dream dissolves

[The Diplomat:]
A world of blue, dreams to pursue
The dawning of an era, a new life evolves
But then the dream dissolves

[The Prophet:]
A world sublime, a paradise
Blessed by our maker, our soul evolves
But the dream dissolves
