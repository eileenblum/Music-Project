[The President:]
Can you feel the power of this vast, everlasting ocean world
Seas of blue, an infinite view, life without frontiers
Oh I can smell the freedom of a life not ruled by mind machines
A boundless place, perpetual space, untouched by man
[TH1:] or by machine

[The Diplomat:]
Unblemished and pure, a paragon of perfection
So calm and serene, forever
A glorious view, oh I can't believe my eyes
Our trek is complete, our goal is achieved
We're alive... we're alive!

[The Astronomer:]
We're going down into the ocean
To bury the past
We're going down into the ocean
[TH1:] we're going down to the ocean, diving into the deep

[The President:]
I believe this planet will give rise to a new humanity
Immortal souls, taking control, colonized by man
[TH1:] not by machines

[The Captain:]
I'll take us down, once we are in, there will be no way out
We'll merge with this world, forever
Sustained by the Source, we'll explore the great unknown
Our passage is done, our battle is won
We'll make it out alive!

[The Astronomer:]
We're going down into the ocean
To bury the past
We're going down into the ocean
[TH1:] we're going down to the ocean
To create a world down there beneath the seas

[The Opposition leader:]
And soon our minds will meld, we'll share the dreams that we once held
And soon our senses surge, a symbiosis will emerge
And soon our souls unite, we'll be connected deep inside
And soon our thoughts will blend, we'll be as one, never end!

[The Prophet:]
For eons to come, we will thrive beneath these seas
Our spirits seem free, forever
But shadows will rise, they will steal our souls away
Then a comet will fly, cleaving the skies
To a world of tomorrow dreams!
