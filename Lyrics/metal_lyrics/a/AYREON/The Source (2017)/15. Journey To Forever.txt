[The Ship's Crew:]
We're on a journey to forever
Dreams eternal, in a wondrous world without walls
We are Forever, wondering what the future holds

[The Captain:] I hear you, a distant voice inside my brain 
[The Diplomat:] I see you, so clear, though you're so far away
[The Captain:] united, together though we're miles apart
[The Diplomat:] undivided, a symbiosis of the heart

[The Captain and The Diplomat:]
We're all connected, a never-ending synergy
We're a collective, an infinite community, immortal harmony, eternal unity

[The Captain:] I'm ready to dive into this brave new world
[The Diplomat:] commencing the morning of our second birth
[The Captain:] it's coming, the rising of a glorious age
[The Diplomat:] it's starting, the dawn of a superior race

[The Ship's Crew:]
We're on a journey to forever
Dreams eternal, in a wondrous world without walls
We are Forever, wondering what the future holds

[The Astronomer:]
We're all connected, a never-ending synergy
Our minds have melded, a singular society 
We're a collective, an infinite community
A perfect symmetry, immortal harmony, eternal unity
