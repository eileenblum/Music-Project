[Chronicle 4: The Rebirth]

[The Historian:]
We've arrived at our new home we call the Bay of Dreams
Our abode beneath the flow of endless silver streams 

[The Chemist:]
Will I ever be free from the ghosts of my past
Will I ever succeed to find peace... at last

[The Historian:]
Overhead, a savage sky, beyond our placid bay
Deadly rays from Sirrah's eye, upon the seas they blaze

[The Chemist:]
Will I ever adapt to this alien life
Will I ever feel trapped, merely trying to survive 

[TH1:]
Will you still be needing me?
Will you still be feeding me?
Will you still be heeding me?
Will you still let me serve when you mutate into the species roaming these oceans
Or will I be disengaged?

[The Diplomat:]
My life is winding down, as if time has ceased
My world grinds to a halt and nature is at peace 
My fears are fading in the wastelands of the deep
My doubts all wash away by the freely twisting streams
[TH1:] in the Bay of Dreams

[The Prophet:]
Far beyond in the Aftertime, a new world to come 
In a far-off galaxy, underneath a distant sun
I see our children, they look like you and me
They await their destiny, I can almost hear their screams
[TH1:] in the Bay of Dreams
