[Chronicle 3: The Transmigration]

[The Ship's Crew:]
Get ready for takeoff and forget the 'Frame
Get ready to shake off all the guilty chains
Our ship is departing to a far-off place
Our saga is starting, an aquatic race

[The Historian:]
Our world is ruined, Captain: no turning back
Their fate is cruel, Captain: their future black
Last Day is here, Captain: they lost all power
The end is near, Captain: It's zero hour
Our time is short, Captain: we need to leave
We're all aboard, Captain: we're all complete
All set to go, Captain: switch engines on
Set your controls, Captain: we leave at dawn

[The Opposition Leader:]
This time we won't depend on cold machinery
I always knew where that would lead
This time we plan ahead and form our strategy
No computers, no machines

[The Diplomat:]
Hibernation now begins, our minds allowed to dream
Eternity will course through our veins
Transformation will set in, the Source is flowing free
Augmenting our brains, forever... forever!

[The Historian:]
Our final chance, Captain: our final leap
We'll be in trance, Captain: we'll be asleep
What will we dream, Captain: will it seem real
What will we see, Captain: how will we feel

[The President:]
I say we change our ways and learn from the past
We cannot make the same mistakes
I say we start today, this chance may be our last
Our people's futures are at stake

[The Counselor:]
Rejuvenation will begin, our thoughts allowed to stray
Infinity will liberate our minds
Immortality sets in, wash our fears away
Leave all our doubts behind, forever

[The Chemist:]
Let the fluid in, wash away
Immerse yourself into this realm of liquid dreams
Everlasting life, drown away your past
Allow yourself to drift beyond the bounds of death and reach out for infinity

[The Biologist:]
Get ready for takeoff astronomer: and forget the 'Frame
Get ready to shake off astronomer: all the guilty chains
Our ship is departing astronomer: to a far-off place
Our saga is starting astronomer: an aquatic race

[The Ship's Crew:]
Get ready for takeoff and forget the 'Frame
Get ready to shake off all the guilty chains
Our ship is departing to a far-off place
Our saga is starting, an aquatic race

[The Chemist:]
Embrace our future home beneath the tides
Soon we will be one with our new ocean world
Time without an end, life without a care
Allow yourself to sail beyond the fringe of time and reach out for eternity
