[The Chemist:]
Let go
The source will flow
Awaken our senses
And assume control

Inside
The source provides
Nourish our spirit
Dominate our minds

[The Historian:]
But deep inside our hearts
Hides a secret yearning
To a former life in a distant world in another time
Now a lost desire

And deep inside our minds
Lives a hidden longing
To a former life in a distant world in another time
But a hopeless dream
A desperate wish
A lost desire

[The Counselor:]
Upon the waves of eternity
We drift away from the past
Into an ocean of time
To the source of life

Upon the tides of infinity
We break away from the shame
Into a sea of relief
To a life complete

Upon the waves of eternity
We drift away from the past
Into an ocean of time
To the source of life

Upon the tides of infinity
We break away from the shame
Into a sea of relief
To a life complete

[The Chemist:]
No frame
The source sustains
Feed our existence
Alleviate our pain

Let go
The source will flow
Soothe our senses
Assume control
