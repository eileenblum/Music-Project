[TH1:]
This isn't good
No this is not good at all

Mayday, mayday, mayday

You're all gonna die
Everybody dies! Dies! Dies! Dies!

Danger!
Warning!
Mayday!

Abandon, evacuate, get out of here!

Oh no, you lived like you did and you thought everything would be fine?
Now you scamper and run, but you've already run out of time
It's rotting and deteriorating from the inside
There's no way to stop it
And clearly there's nowhere to hide
Calculation of survival rate 0%

Doom, gloom, the world goes boom
None will be spared so don't assume
Not ragged clothed nor silver spooned
You're all the same when extinction looms

[The Opposition Leader and The Chemist:]
No food supplies, no water supplies
No power supplies or other supplies
No compromise, just say your goodbyes
And everybody dies!

No explanation or clarification
No information or justification
Forget the whys, just cover your eyes
And everybody dies!

[TH1:]
Oh no! It's not like your screaming can somehow elongate your life
You're best off to shut up and calm down and wait for it

[The Opposition Leader and The Chemist:]
The world is black, there's no way back
You're way off the track, no plan of attack
So recognize your pending demise
And everybody dies!

[The President:]
And in the end when all is silent
The core is melting down
A quantum supernova's blasting out

[The Chemist:]
Then ominous skies materialize
And everybody dies!

[TH1:]
Oh no! Now holding your breath isn't going to bide you more time
You're best off to lay down and curl up and wait for it

[The Opposition Leader and The Chemist:]
The ultimate blast will be the last
And when it's passed, so terribly fast
It blinds your eyes, you're paralyzed
And everybody dies!

The soil'll be red where people have bled
The cities all dead, radiation will spread
It's no surprise, we swallowed the lies
And everybody dies

[The Astronomer:]
And in the end when all is silent
The core is melting down
A quantum supernova's blasting out

[The Chemist:]
Then ominous skies materialize
And everybody dies!

[The Diplomat:]
Don't give up, we are still breathing
Don't give in, that's what they want
Don't despair, just keep believing
Don't lose heart, we'll blast our way out of here

[TH1:]
Danger!
Warning!
Mayday!

Abandon! Evacuate!

[The Captain:]
Follow me to a place beyond us
Follow me to another world
Time is short, the hour's upon us
Follow me to the stars

[TH1:]
Oh yes! Not ideal conditions, but stable enough, you could try
The chances are slim but perhaps you could make it alive?

[The Biologist:]
And in the end when all is silent
The core is melting down
A quantum supernova's blasting out

And in the end beyond the violence
No humans will be found
Now a quantum supernova's blasted out

[TH1:]
Then ominous skies materialize
No compromise, just say your goodbyes
It's no surprise, we swallowed the lies
Now everybody dies!
