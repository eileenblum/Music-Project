Run! Apocalypse! Run!

[The Opposition Leader:]
Outside this hall, abuse and assault, a cold-blooded war rages on
We're leaving today, I'll lead the way, our perilous journey's begun

[The Astronomer:]
Crime and violence corrupting the heart, society's falling apart
All our nations are lost in this cruel holocaust, so run!

[TH1:]
Run, run, run, run, apocalypse!

[The President:]
Anarchy reigns, chaos remains, we need to get out while we can
No sign of the 'Frame, we are to blame for the final destruction of man

[The Biologist:]
Alliances spark down there in the dark, the underworld's coming alive
I see raiders and thieves marauding the streets, now run!

[TH1:]
Time is running out above your heads, above the stars.
Stop right.
It's clearly now your only viable solution.
Go now! Run!

[The Captain:] Run! Apocalypse! Run! Our time is running out and the damage is done
[The Prophet:] Run! Apocalypse! Run! The seven seals of hell have been broken, the devil has won
[The Captain:] Run, the countdown is on, the final hour has come now the end has begun
[The Prophet:] Run! Apocalypse! Run! Our souls are forsaken, our faith has been shaken, it's time to awaken
The devil has won

[The Historian:]
It's break of day, we're crawling our way down through the tunnels below
Then just like he said, there's light up ahead, only a few miles to go
We run down the valley and up to the hills, where Starblade's awaiting on high
We all climb aboard, charting our course, we're alive!

[TH1:]
Coordinates are set, fire up the jets, wipe away the sweat, repress all your regrets
Power up â throttle down â safety check..? ah no time! Hold onto your heads...
We're bound for Sirrah's Eye!

[The Prophet:]
Run! Apocalypse! Run!
Our souls are forsaken, our faith has been shaken, it's time to awaken
The devil has taken everything we love
