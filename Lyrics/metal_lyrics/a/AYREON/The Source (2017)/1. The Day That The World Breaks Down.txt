[Chronicle 1: The Frame]

[The Historian (James LaBrie):]
A silence so deafening
As the stillness surrounds us
A rush of fear is surging through our veins

A shadow so menacing
Darkens our horizon
What have we done?
Is this the end
When death descends?

[The Opposition Leader (Tommy Karevik):]
Don't say I didn't warn you
You'll recall my words
The day that the world breaks down

Don't claim you didn't see it
Are you prepared to die
The day that the world breaks down

[The Chemist (Tommy Rogers):]
I can't believe we're in danger
I can't believe that we've let it come this far

[The Counselor (Simone Simmons):]
We must prepare for the changes
We must prepare for
The day that the world breaks down

[The Opposition Leader (Tommy Karevik):]
Don't expect we will survive this
There'll be no way back
The day that the world breaks down

Don't assume it's all a nightmare
we won't stand a chance
The day that the world breaks down

[The Chemist (Tommy Rogers):]
I can't believe this is happening
I can't believe we are headed
For a fall

[The Counselor (Simone Simmons):]
We must prepare for the blackening
We must prepare for
The day that the world breaks down

[The Prophet (Nils K. Rue):]
I can feel it in my heart
I can see it in the stars
Behold: It's all been foretold
The future unfolds
The day that the world breaks down

[The Captain (Tobias Sammet):]
I always knew this would happen
Not many believed in my cause
I'm sure they will all turn to me now
I'm sure I'm the only one
Who can save us
[TH-1:] StarBlade
From this fate

[The Captain (Tobias Sammet):]
I always knew they would need me
Not many showed faith in my plans
I'm sure they will listen to me now
I'm sure that I'm the only one
[TH-1:] StarBlade
Who can save us
From this fate

[The Astronomer (Hansi Kursch):]
Yes I believe you are the answer
Yes I agree you are the key
Your future lies in the heavens
Our future lies beyond the stars

[TH-1:]
StarBlade

[The Astronomer (Hansi Kursch):]
We will save them

[TH-1:]
StarBlade

[The Astronomer (Hansi Kursch):]
We will save them

[TH-1:]
StarBlade

[The Astronomer (Hansi Kursch):]
From this fate

[The President (Russell Allen):]
I must have been blind
I mean it should've been obvious
Straight out of my mind
To rely on a cold machine

The signs are strong
I know I was wrong
I know they will hate me now
But I will come clean
And destroy this cold machine

[The Diplomat (Michael Eriksen):]
This is not over
Not as long as we're alive
If we join our forces
We will make it

This is not over
As a race we must survive
And in the end we'll cross this bridge together

[The President (Russell Allen):]
We're losing this fight
And yes - we got ourselves to blame
I guess it seems right
In the mind of the cold machine

I'll fix every flaw
I'll break every law
I'll tear up the rulebook
If that's what it takes
You will see
I will crush this cold machine

[The Diplomat (Michael Eriksen):]
This is not over
I am sure we'll find a way
Out of this desperate situation

This is not over
Even if it all seems hopeless
For in the end we'll cross this bridge together

[The Biologist (Floor Jansen):]
I can feel it in the air
The signs are everywhere
Communications grind to a halt
Traffic has stopped
The grid starts to fail
Planes crashing down
We're getting closer to
The day the world breaks down
