[The Opposition Leader:]
How can we still trust you after all the vows you broke
Tell me why should we believe in you after all the lies you spoke
You swore the 'Frame would shield us, so we welcomed your machines
We depended on technology to wash our poisoned nations clean

[The President:]
I can't deny, it's true what you're saying
I will beware not to make the same mistakes
'Cause after all, we are all that's remaining
Planet Y is alive!

[The Astronomer:]
Planet Y is alive, our race will survive!
Forever we're free and forever we'll be and forever we will dream
Planet Y is alive, our people will thrive!
Forever's our goal and forever's our soul and forever we will grow
[TH1:] forever free

[The Opposition Leader:]
We can start all over, raise an empire of our own
We can build a new community and never stand alone
Now we are connected and working as a team
We have a chance to turn a new page, devoid of science and machines

[The President:]
We have the power, to design the perfect future
Utopia, in the silence of the sea
No glowing screens, no heartless computers
Planet Y is alive!

[The Captain:]
I see her shine, faintly in the distance
Our new sun... reminding me of home
Conjuring up, all we will be missing 
Planet Y is alive!

[The Biologist:]
Planet Y is alive, our race will survive!
Forever we're free and forever we'll be and forever we will dream
Planet Y is alive, our people will thrive!
Forever's our goal and forever's our soul and forever we'll grow and forever we'll flow into the deep
[TH1:] we will thrive, we'll survive, we're alive
