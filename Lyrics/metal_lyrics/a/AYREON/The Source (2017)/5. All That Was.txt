[The Counselor and The Biologist:]
I remember when I first saw your face
I remember the day, the hour, the place
Now it's over, I still feel our first embrace
It's all over, it's time to say goodbye to... all that was

I remember when you made me feel alive
I remember the passion in our eyes 
Now it's over, I won't be there when you die 
It's all over, it's time to say goodbye to... all that was

[The Historian:] I know it's hard, but we have to carry on
[The Diplomat:] convince yourself that we have no other choice
[The Historian:] a cold new start, the life we knew is gone
[The Diplomat and The Historian:] our world, our lives have been destroyed

[The Counselor and The Biologist:]
I remember when the world was in our hands
I remember the future we had planned
Now it's over, will you ever understand?
It's all over, it's time to say goodbye to... all that was
