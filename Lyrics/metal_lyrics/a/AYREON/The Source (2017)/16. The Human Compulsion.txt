[The Counselor:]
Do we belong here, do we hide behind our dreams?
Can we live without machines?

[The Historian:]
Can we resist our compulsion to explore
Or will we always hunt for more?

[The Chemist:]
Liquid Eternity perpetuates our lives
But will it paralyze our minds? 

[The Diplomat:]
Without the danger, can we still evolve?
Will our passions all dissolve?

[The President:]
Remember Alpha, the source of human life
Will our history be revived? 

[The Prophet:]
The second coming of the Universal Soul 
Will make our hollow spirits whole 

[The Captain:]
Maybe one day, man will rise again
Standing tall as we were then

[The Astronomer:]
Is this our destiny, a life forevermore
Or will we crave our time before?

[The Opposition Leader:]
Are we still human, buried in our minds? 
Or did we leave ourselves behind? 

[The Biologist:]
Our tale's not over, the circle's incomplete
We won't just vanish in the sea!
