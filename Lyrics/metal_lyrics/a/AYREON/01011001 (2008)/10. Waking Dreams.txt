[Jonas Renkse:]
Life, imagination
Missing link in the chain
We'll fuel your minds
Color your thoughts
Come to you waking dreams

Fire, inspiration
Missing branch on the tree
We are your roots, we are your blood
Come to you in waking dreams

[Anneke:]
Sail the stream as I dance upon the waves of a waking dream
As it passes you by.
Ride the beam as I rise upon the wings of a waking dream
As it fades in the sky.

[Jonas:]
Mind transformation
You were chosen
Live the the dream that we have been dreaming
Now is a time to come together and make it come true
Oh me and you

[Anneke:]
Sail the stream as I dance upon the waves of a waking dream as it passes you by.
(Dancing on the waves)
Ride the beam as I rise upon the wings of a waking dream as it fades in the sky.

[Anneke:]
Sail the stream as I dance upon the waves of a waking dream as it passes you by.
(Dancing on the waves)
Ride the beam as I rise upon the wings of a waking dream as it fades in the sky.
