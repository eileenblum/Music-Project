[Wudstik:]
It all came to me in the wake of a dream
Bending space and reversing the stream
The knowledge is mine to influence time
And avert our decline

We could use this to salvage mankind
Send projections into the past
As humanity fades in their minds
Let them know man won't last

It all came to me in the wake of a dream

[Chorus:]
[Marjan Welman:]
This may be our last chance if we want man to survive
A mirror reflection
Show them our world as it dies
Cut through the barrier and do what no one has dared
Let's break the equation
E=mc2

[Wudstik:]
Our first try was a minor success
No control, I can but guess
We have to move now; don't know just how
No mistakes are allowed
We can make no mistakes

I have sent it but nothing changes
Just a line in some nation lore
I don't know just how far it reaches
Everything's like before

It all came to me in the wake of a dream

[Chorus]

(The outcome of the final experiment has now been placed in your hands)
