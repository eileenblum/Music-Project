[Anneke van Giersbergen:]
No need [x5]
No need to feel the pain
No need to feel betrayed
No need to feel inane
No need to feel afraid

[Jorn Lande:]
Wake me up before I die, hold me close
As I gaze upon to the sky, comatose
No reason to survive, I suppose
Wake us up before we die

[Anneke:] No need to feel desire
[Jorn Lande:] But I need you with me
[Anneke:] No need to feel so small
[Jorn Lande:] But I need to feel secure

[Anneke:] No need to feel the fire
[Jorn Lande:] But I need to feel free
[Anneke:] No need to feel at all
[Jorn Lande:] But I need to know for sure

[Jorn Lande:]
Wake me up before I die, hold me close
As I gaze upon the sky, comatose
No reason to survive, I suppose
Wake us up before we die
