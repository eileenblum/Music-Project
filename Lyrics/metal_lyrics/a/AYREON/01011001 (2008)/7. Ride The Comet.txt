[Jorn Lande:] Find your way home, little extremophiles
[Floor Jansen:] Fly, beloved sons
[Tom Englund:] Find your way home, donors of life
[Floor Jansen:] Fly, my chosen ones
[Jonas P. Renkse:] You're on your own, little extremophiles
[Floor Jansen:] Ride your frozen ark
[Bob Catley:] You're on your own, cleaving the skies
[Floor Jansen:] Ride into the dark

[Chorus]:
[Magali Luyten:]
Carry out your dangerous task, sail uncharted spheres
Live out our dreams, ride the comet
Journey on the Migrator trail, cross the new frontiers
Pass on our genes, ride the comet

[Jorn Lande:] You are the future, little extremophiles
[Floor Jansen:] Fly towards the sun
[Tom Englund:] You are the future, you know what to do
[Floor Jansen:] Fly, it has begun

[Chorus]
