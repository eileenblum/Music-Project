[Tom Englund:]
We have to teach them all that we know
Their evolution moves far too slow
Expand their minds and reject compliance
Upgrade their knowledge, upload our science

[Steve Lee:]
This revolution will lead to their demise,
We should not make the same mistake twice
We're kept alive by artificial means
We've lost our souls to a world of machines

[Jorn Lande:] Listen to the warning [8X]

[Tom Englund:]
We need to teach them to fight disease
They seem so helpless and need our expertise
I see them dying all across the globe
Their greatest foe is but a small microbe

[Steve Lee:]
The sudden change leads to overpopulation
Shifting the balance, destructive habitation
Killing a live biological invasion
Consuming it by ruthless exploitation

[Jorn Lande:] Can you see the fire in their eyes?
[Bob Catley:] Can you hear the anguish in their cries?
[Jorn Lande:] Can you see the beauty in their eyes?
[Bob Catley:] Can you sense the love within their hearts?
[Jorn Lande:] I can taste the freedom we once had
[Bob Catley:] I can touch their pain when they feel sad
[Jorn Lande:] I can smell the fragrance of the air
[Bob Catley:] I remember times we used to share

[Hansi Kursch:]
Don't want to live in a world that's dying
I want to die in a world that's living! [2X]

[Jorn Lande:] Listen to the warning [8X]

(Before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction. - JFK)

(The only thing we have to fear is fear itself - Roosevelt)

(Our task is not only to win the battle, but to win the war - Churchill))

[Bob Catley:] We gave them feelings - what did they sense?
[Steve Lee:] Shout out the world and put up a fence!
[Bob Catley:] We gave them science - what did they do?
[Steve Lee:] They built a bomb and they used it too.
[Bob Catley:] We gave them reason - what did they learn?
[Steve Lee:] Warmed up the planet and made it burn!
[Bob Catley:] We gave them art - what did they make?
[Steve Lee:] Nuclear weapons for their own sake!
[Bob Catley:] We gave them insight - what did they see?
[Steve Lee:] Degrade the noble, enslave the free!
[Bob Catley:] We gave them wisdom - what did they teach?
[Steve Lee:] Destroying all that's within their reach!
[Bob Catley:] We gave them language - what did they say?
[Steve Lee:] They put the planet in disarray!
[Bob Catley, Steve Lee:] We gave them dreams - and what did they dream?

[Hansi Kursch:]
Don't want to live in a world that's dying.
I want to die in a world that's living!

[Jorn Lande:] Listen to the warning [4X]

[Jonas Renkse:]
A chain on guilt around our neck
A planet straying in darkness
Can we save the lives we wrecked?
I say we should find a way
I say stop this decay

[Jorn Lande:] Can you see the fire in their eyes?
[Bob Catley:] Can you hear the anguish in their cries?
[Jorn Lande:] Can you see the beauty in their art?
[Bob Catley:] Can you sense the love within their hearts?
[Jorn Lande:] I can taste the freedom we once had (freedom, freedom)
[Bob Catley:] I can touch their pain (oh, can you feel the fire?)
[Jorn Lande:] I can smell the fragrance of the air.
[Bob Catley:] I relive the times we used to share (yeah).

[Jorn Lande:] Can you see the fire in their eyes? (Oh!)
[Bob Catley:] Can you hear the anguish in their cries? (Can you feel the fire?)
[Jorn Lande:] Can you see the beauty in their art?
[Bob Catley:] Can you sense the love within their hearts? (Can you feel the beauty?)

[Hansi Kursch:] Don't want to live in a world that's dying!
[Jorn Lande:] Oh yeah, so beautiful!
[Hansi Kursch:] I want to die in a world that's living! (Yeah, yeah!)
