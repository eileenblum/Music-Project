[The Incentive]

[Daniel GildenlÃ¶w:]
There must be a way to enrich our lives.
A way to awaken a nation that dies.
There must be a way to revive our past.
A way to break free from a world that won't last.

[Floor Jansen:]
Take me back to when we lived another life
Back to when we had no plan
Take me back to when we struggled to survive
Back to when it all began

[Daniel GildenlÃ¶w:]
There must be a way to reverse history
A way to resume life, return to the sea
There must be a way to win back what we lost.
A way to escape this, whatever the cost

[Floor Jansen:]
Take me back to when we lived another life
Back to when we had no plan
Take me back to when we struggled to survive
Back to when it all began

[The Vision]

[Tom Englund:]
Explore the vastness of space
Discover a wonderful place
Enter a brand new phase
Seed the world with a newborn race [x2]

[The Procedure]

[Jonas Renkse:]
We have no choice
Life is passing us by
We should rejoice
I say we should try

[Bob Catley:]
Every million cycles
shooting stars rip our sky.
We could divert them
on the day they pass us by.

[Hansi Kursch:]
And on that shining day there is a way
For our DNA to reach a world to stay (world to stay!)

[Jorn Lande:]
Hmmm...
Do we have the right to create life?
And do we have the right to take it? Yeah
Can we decide who lives and dies?
Do you think they would even make it

[Jonas Renkse:] We have no choice, life is passing us by

[Bob Catley:]
We all plant our seeds
And guide them to their goal
We cannot fail
We have absolute control

[Hansi Kursch:]
And on that shining day there is a way
For our DNA to reach a world to stay (world to stay!)

[Jorn Lande:]
Hmmm...
Do we have the right to play gods?
I strongly feel I have to make a stance
Do you think we should take the odds? Yeah.
Would they even stand chance?
I don't think they ever will.
Ever will...
No...

[Another Life]

[Daniel Gildenlow:]
Take me back to when we lived another life
Back to when we had no plan
Take me back to when we struggled to survive
Back to when it all began

[Bob Catley:]
Take us back to when we lived another life
Back to when we had no plan
Take us back to when we struggled to survive
Back to when it all began

[Floor Jansen:]
Take me back to when we lived another life
Back to when we had no plan
Take me back to when we struggled to survive
Back to when it all began

[Newborn Race]

[Jorn Lande:]
Explore the vastness of space
Discover a wonderful place
Enter a brand new phase
[Jonas Renkse:] We should rejoice!
[Jorn Lande:] Seed the world with a newborn race
[Jonas Renkse:] I say we should try
[Jorn Lande:]
Explore the vastness of space
Discover a wonderful place (do we have the rights?!)
Enter a brand new phase
Seed the world with a newborn race (we cannot fail!)

[The Conclusion]

[Daniel GildenlÃ¶w:]
We found a way to enrich our lives
A way to awaken the nation that's died
