[Jonas Renkse:]
Once a world, endless and free, horizons unbroken
Now a world of bounded frontiers, the elders have spoken
(our home)

[Daniel GildenlÃ¶w:]
Once a world, eternal and blue, floating, escaping
Now a world that's blinding my view, shadows shaping
(alone)

[Chorus:]
[Magali Luyten:]
Liquid eternity courses through our veins
Liquid eternity nourishes our brains
Liquid eternity, a world that does not live
Liquid eternity, a life that does not yield

[Bob Catley:]
Once a world of fear and dismay of fleeing and hiding
Now a world that's peaceful and safe, so caring and providing,
our home...

[Chorus]

[Tom Englund:]
Would you prefer the pain and suffering we had?
Would you prefer to be in peril, even dead?
Would you prefer to live the life we've learned to dread?
Would you prefer to live a mortal life instead?
[Jonas Renkse:] Our home

[Jorn Lande:] I'm losing my reason to live, the essence of life
[Floor Jansen:] But the system's got so much to give or would you rather die?
[Jorn Lande:] I'm losing my pride and my joy, my will to believe
[Floor Jansen:] Why would you come back and destroy all we have achieved?

[Chorus]

[Tom Englund:]
Would you prefer the pain and suffering we had?
Would you prefer to be in peril, even dead?
Would you prefer to live the life we've loved to play?
Would you prefer to live a mortal life instead?

[Chorus]

[Tom Englund:]
Would you prefer the pain and suffering we had?
Would you prefer to be in peril, even dead?
Would you prefer to live the life we've learned to dread?
Would you prefer to live a mortal life instead?

[Jonas Renkse:] Our home
