[Glimmer Of Hope]

[Anneke van Giersbergen:] Through their eyes we will see
[Bob Catley:] With their hands we will create
[Anneke van Giersbergen:] In their world we will be free
[Bob Catley:] With our minds we'll shape their fate

[Steve Lee:]
Now the die is cast, the first step taken
A glimmer of hope lights up our lives
Visions of the past, dreams forsaken
Forming right before our eyes
We're alive

[Anneke van Giersbergen:] Through their pain we'll learn to live
[Bob Catley:] Remember all life has to give

[Jorn Lande:]
Now the die is cast, the first step taken
A glimmer of hope lights up our lives
Visions of the past, dreams forsaken
Re-ignite the sparkle in our eyes
We're alive! So alive!

[World Of Tomorrow Dreams]

[Tom Englund:]
I see a planet, perfect for our needs
Behold our target, a world to plant our seeds
[Steve Lee:]
There must be life, first remove any trace of doubt!
They may all die, don't you think we should check it out?
[Daniel GildenlÃ¶w:]
We have no choice, we waited far too long
This is our planet, this is where they belong
[Jorn Lande:]
We may regret this, is this the way it's supposed to be?
A cold execution, a mindless act of cruelty!

[Bob Catley, Hansi Kursch:]
In the World of Tomorrow Dreams, our future lies
In the World of Tomorrow Dreams, our hopes will rise

[Tom Englund:]
I see mainly reptiles, a lower form of intelligence
Mere brainless creatures with no demonstrable sentience
[Jorn Lande:]
What makes us superior, we did not do so great ourselves!
A dying race, imprisoned in restricted shells

[Bob Catley, Hansi Kursch:]
In the World of Tomorrow Dreams, our future lies
In the World of Tomorrow Dreams, our hopes will rise

[Derek Sherinian: Synth solo]

[Collision Course]

[From The Ashes]

[Tom Englund:] And as the smoke slowly rises
[Jonas Renkse:] Our planet's bare and cold
[Tom Englund:] But as the black sky brightens
[Jonas Renkse:] A wondrous world unfolds

[Daniel GildenlÃ¶w:] We're at the dawn of a new age
[Bob Catley:] As we hear the final cries
[Daniel GildenlÃ¶w:] Ready to enter the next stage
[Bob Catley:] From the ashes we will rise

[Steve Lee:] And as the smoke slowly rises
[Hansi Kursch:] Our planet's bare and cold
[Steve Lee:] But as the black sky brightens
[Hansi Kursch:] A wondrous world unfolds

[Floor Jansen:] We're at the dawn of a new age
[Jorn Lande:] As we hear the final cries
[Floor Jansen:] Ready to enter the next stage
[Jorn Lande:] From the ashes we will rise!

[Glimmer Of Hope Reprise]

[Daniel GildenlÃ¶w:]
Now the die is cast, the first step taken
A glimmer of hope lights up our lives
Visions of the past, dreams forsaken
Re-ignite the sparkle in our eyes
We are alive
