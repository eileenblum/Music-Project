[Tom Englund:]
We never saw this coming
Pride comes before a fall
We never heeded the warnings
Buried deep within us all

[Chorus:]
[Steve Lee:] The age of shadows has begun
[Daniel GildenlÃ¶w:] Giant machines blot out the sun
[Steve Lee:] Frozen minds becoming numb
[Daniel GildenlÃ¶w:] The age of shadows has begun
[Steve Lee:] The age of Shadows has begun
[Daniel GildenlÃ¶w:] I won't accept what we've become
[Steve Lee:] We stand to lose more than we've won
[Daniel GildenlÃ¶w:] The age of Shadows has begun

[Tom Englund:]
Our quenchless thirst for knowledge
Our urge to change and grow
Our need to expand the nation
Made us rise from the depths below

[Chorus]

[Hansi Kursch:] No more aggression
[Floor Jansen:] No more initiative
[Hansi Kursch:] No more suppression
[Floor Jansen:] No more emotions
[Hansi Kursch:] No more resection
[Floor Jansen:] No more of all the feelings that shaped our hearts and made us who we are
[Hansi Kursch:] No more possessions
[Floor Jansen:] No more suspicious
[Hansi Kursch:] No more obsessions
[Floor Jansen:] No more sensations
[Hansi Kursch:] No more depression
[Floor Jansen:] No more of all the passions that shaped our hearts and made us who we are

[Jonas Renkse:]
Time (time, time) but a passageway (a passageway, a passageway)
The beginning of the end (of the end)
An end that never was (was, was, was)
Time (time, time) but a curve in space (curve in space, curve in)

We are forever (we are forever, we are forever) eternal prisoners in time (in time, in time)
We are forever (we are forever) caught in our cold inertia

Longing, hoping, waiting, for no one...

[Anekke van Giersberg:]
Forever we yearn, forever we learn
Forever we live a lie, forever sleeping by and
Forever we flee (forever we flee), forever we will be,
Forever is but a dream, forever is but a scream and
Forever we try, forever we die,

The spell of love wore off
The zest for life not enough

Longing, hoping, waiting, for no one

Never enough

Forever we tie, forever we die, forever, forever

No more aggression
(No more initiative)
No more suppression
(no more emotions)
No more resection
(no more of all the feelings that shaped our hearts and made us who we are)
No more possessions

No more obsessions

No more depression
(no more of all the passions that shaped our hearts and made us who we are

The age of shadows has begun
(Giant machines blot out the sun)
Frozen lands becoming known
(The age of shadows has begun)

The age of Shadows has begun
(I won't accept what we've become)
We stand to lose more than we've won
(The age of Shadows has begun)

The age of shadows has begun
(Giant machines blot out the sun)
Frozen lands becoming known
(The age of shadows has begun)

The age of Shadows has begun
(I won't accept what we've become)
We stand to lose more than we've won
(The age of Shadows has begun)

We never heeded the warning
Buried deep within us all
