[Ty Tabor:]
I hugged the wife and drove to work today
It was only a few miles
Was in no hurry but the lights were changing up ahead
So I stepped on the gas

I checked the web and left it on over night
Downloading all the latest files
Peer to peer, the torrent flows into my life
And I disconnect

[Chorus:]
[Ty Tabor:] We all know
[Arjen Lucassen:] We all know, no need to remind us
[Ty Tabor:] We all know
[Arjen Lucassen:] We all know but won't connect the dots
[Ty Tabor:] We all know
[Arjen Lucassen:] We all know, locked away inside us
[Ty Tabor, Arjen Lucassen:]
We are dying for tomorrow
We are living for today

[Ty Tabor:]
I rushed back home to my family
I got my son a brand new game
No need to cook,
I picked up fast food on the way
And it's finger-licking good

Have you seen little Steve today?
Guess he's still up there in his room
But if he comes down to
I'll be right here just staring at the tube
Playing his game

[Chorus]

[Ty Tabor:]
Don't you think it's rather warm tonight
Especially for the time of year
I turn up the air
Pull the sheets up to my chin
And I close my eyes

Can't relax, can't fall asleep
Should I take another pill?
I turn up the lights, light up a cigarette and smile
I've got it made

[Chorus:]
[Ty Tabor:] We all know
[Arjen Lucassen:] We all know, no need to remind us
[Ty Tabor:] We all know
[Arjen Lucassen:] We all know, but won't connect the dots
[Ty Tabor:] We all know
[Arjen Lucassen:] We all know, locked away inside us
[Ty Tabor, Arjen Lucassen:]
We are dying for tomorrow
[Ty Tabor:] We all know
[Arjen Lucassen:] We all know, no need to remind us
[Ty Tabor:] We all know
[Arjen Lucassen:] We all know, but won't connect the dots
[Ty Tabor:] We all know
[Arjen Lucassen:] We all know, locked away inside us
[Ty Tabor, Arjen Lucassen:]
We are dying for tomorrow
We are living for today
