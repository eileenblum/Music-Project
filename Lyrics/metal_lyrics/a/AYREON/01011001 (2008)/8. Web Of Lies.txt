[Simone Simons]:
Dear PX, I feel you are the one
What's your name? Where are you from?
I'm in love, though we never met
Looking for clues, I search the net

Dear PX, I'm waiting for your mail
Check every hour, to no avail
Been up all night, couldn't get to sleep
No way out, I'm in too deep

Dear PX, it's been 11 days
I'm kind of lost within this maze
Are you there? Give me but a sign
Are you at home? Are you on-line?

[Phideaux Xavier]:
Dear Simone, sorry for the wait
I've seen your pics, you're looking great
I'm all alone, dying for a date
I think we match, it must be fate

[Simone Simons]:
Dear OL, I feel you are the one
what's your name? where are you from?
I'm in love, though we never met
Looking for clues, I search the net
