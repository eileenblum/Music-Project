[12. The consultation]

"The Mother takes the Prodigy to a Psychiatrist for assessment. He performs a diagnostic interview and battery of tests on the Prodigy."

[Psychiatrist:]
I know itâs hard to find the words
But tell me all about your world
Do you struggle to adapt?
Do you feel detached?

[Prodigy:]
It seems Iâm always out of place
Like some alien machine
I never know how I should be
Or what to feel, or what is real

[Mother:]
Can you help us reach our son?
Can we put our faith in you?
Can you help him overcome?
There is brilliance shining through
Do you see it too?

[Psychiatrist:]
Letâs talk about your dreams
Can you tell me what you see?
Can you describe the way you feel?
Do you feel anything at allâ¦

[Prodigy:]
I see things that donât belong
In this four-dimensional world
There is so much more beyond
More to unveil, more to reveal

[Mother:]
Can you help us reach our son?
Can we put our faith in you?
Can you help him overcome
There is magic shining through

Can you help us reach our son?

[Prodigy:]
I, I need a future I can build
[Mother:]
Can you tell us what to do?

[Prodigy:]
Give me a role that I can fulfil

[Mother:]
Can we help him rise above?

[Prodigy:]
I know Iâve got something to give

[Mother and Prodigy:]
A reason to live!

[13. Diagnosis]

"The Psychiatrist informs the Mother and Father of his findings. But will they accept the unconventional course of treatment he suggests?"

[Flute and bass flute: Jeroen Goossens]

[Psychiatrist:]
Yes, Iâm afraid I see signs of impairment
But there is something more
Heâs an exceptional savant, one in a million

His mind is ablaze with distraction
But maybe I can help
Iâm testing a new drug that can help him focus

[Father:]
Please tell us more, that sounds intriguing
Can he join your clinical trial?
If he could concentrate he could help me
He might even be of some use!

Center the mind, cut straight to the core
Brighten the flame, break open the cage
Shatter the wall, shut down the noise
Soften the pain, sharpen the brain

[Psychiatrist:]
I have to confess itâs experimental
Iâm still running through the tests
The side effects could include extreme delusions

[Mother:]
No! Not on my life, Iâll never allow it!
No matter what we could win
I wonât let you endanger my child
I refuse to play dice with his life

[Mini Moog solo: Rick Wakeman]

[14. The Argument 1]

"Is the Psychiatrist's experimental drug worth the risk? The Mother and Father have vastly different views - and motivations."

[Mother:]
How could you even contemplate
Experimenting on our child?
Were you only thinking of yourself again?

[Father:]
No! Why shouldnât I want to help him
You make it sound like itâs a crime
Iâm not giving up, this isnât over!

[15. The Rivalâs Dilemma]

"The Rival appears to have his own agenda"

[High Whistle: Troy Donockley
Cello: Maaike Peterse
Flute: Jeroen Goossens]

[Rival:]
So... what if they are right
And heâs so remarkable
How does that affect me?

Ever since I was a child
It all came so easy
I never had to try

If heâs as brilliant as they say
How will I be noticed
Now Iâm not so specialâ¦ anymore

Iâm not sure why Iâm afraid
No, he wonât beat me
Not without a fight, no!

One day Iâll show them I am the genius
One day the whole world will know
One day Iâll show them who he really is
One day theyâll know

[16. Surface Tension]

[Mini Moog solo: Rick Wakeman]

[Instrumental]

[17. A Reason To Live]

[Teacher:]
Letâs find him a future to build
Heâll give me a role to fulfil
I know heâs got something to give
We all need a reason to live

[Girl:]
A future to build
A role to fulfil
Something to give
A reason to live

[18. Potential]

"The Teacher and the Girl each have their own reasons for supporting the Prodigy"

[Cello: Maaike Peterse
Violin: Ben Mathot
Flute: Jeroen Goossens]

[Teacher:]
Where am I going?
How did this happen?
My life has unfolded
Depressingly average

But if I support him
Help him reach his potential
Heâll be my contribution
I can still make my mark
My name will live on

[Girl:]
His shyness is charming
I wish I could reach him
Heâs strangely disarming
I hope I can free him

[Teacher:]
I know I can help him

[Girl:]
He needs someone like me

[Teacher:]
To reach his potential

[Girl:]
To learn how to feel

[Teacher:]
Heâll be my contribution

[Girl:]
I wish heâd let me in

[Teacher:]
Theyâll remember my name

[Girl:]
Let me help him to live

[Teacher:]
My claim to fame

[19. Quantum Chaos]

"4 years ago.

As the Prodigy gradually disappears into a chaotic world of patterns and equations, the Father can't stop wondering if the Psychiatrist's drug might help."

[Instrumental]

[20. Dark Medicine]

"The Father meets with the Psychiatrist, this time... alone."

[Psychiatrist:]
I know why youâre here
Youâre a fellow man of science
Our point of view is very much alike

[Father:]
The choice is clear
I donât need to be convinced
Denying him this chance just isnât right

[Psychiatrist:]
Give him one a day
Thatâs the safest place to start
At such a tiny dose, the risks are low

[Father:]
Keep it between you and me
Oh, they would never understand
Letâs both agree that no one needs to know

[21. Alive!]

"The Father has been secretly putting the drug in the Prodigy's food. The Results are almost immediate... and stunning."

[Cello: Maaike]

[Prodigy:]
Patterns are forming
Breaking through the noise
A beautiful symmetry
Slowly falling into place

Inspiration is flowing
Filling up the void
A perfect harmony
Full of elegance and grace

Iâve come alive
The road is so much clearer now
Iâm finally awake
Destiny waits

[Father:]
Oh, am I getting through to you
Can you hear me, son?
I never doubted you
I always knew youâd win this fight

I am reaching out to you
Can you help me, son?
Iâm so close to the answer
But I need your brilliant mind

Weâve come alive
Our goal is so much closer now
Now itâs time to turn the page
Destiny waits
Now we will fulfill our fate
Destiny waits!

[22. The Prediction]

"The Mother rejoices at the Prodigy's remarkable progress, unaware that it's all due to the drug she was so violently opposed to."

[Mother:]
And soon youâll show them youâre a genius
And soon the whole world will know
And soon youâll show them what life really is
One day theyâll know!
