[hippie]
was this a dream I just had?
I have my doubts
I can't make out the truth
from the lies here inside
what kind of trip have I been on?
where did I go
I'd like to know just why
did it feel so damn real?

[futureman]
there's something strange going on
I don't know why
It's something I can't place
an open space, a shrouded face
as if my memory flies
have been erased
and then replaced by lies
false replies, clouded skies

[hippie &amp; futureman (chorus)]
a secret yearning lurks inside
like a dream trying to hide
another time, another space
an empty feeling haunts my brain
a strange void I can't explain
another time, another space

[roman]
I've been relieved of all my pain
I've been reborn
a mighty storm has raged
and my fears disappeared

[knight]
I've found the grail here within
in a magic dream
I have seen a world
of make belief, of joy and grief!

[chorus all]

Remember forever.....
