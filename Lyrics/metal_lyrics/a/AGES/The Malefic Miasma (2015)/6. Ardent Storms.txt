Ardent storms rips through time and space
Bursts of calamitous mass
Extrasolar tides, adjudicates our fate;
the non existent one

Forgers of consolation - Night skies betray your lies
Forgers of salvation - Aeons falsifies the fables

Forged in effluxion of matter,
sprung from the aimless cosmic winds
We are the cause of our death,
and the adversaries of our prosperity

Resist the assailant of clarity,
and the ongoing onslaught of sanity
Fortify your stoical abode,
usurp the thrones of enlightenment
Purge this dismal fort of its infection

Forgers of consolation - Night skies betray your lies
Forgers of salvation - Aeons falsifies the fables

Resist the assailant of clarity,
and the ongoing onslaught of sanity
Fortify your stoical abode,
usurp the thrones of enlightenment
