-Deuteronomy 12:2

"Ye shall utterly destroy all the places,
wherein the nations which ye shall possess
served their gods, upon the high mountains,
and upon the hills, and under every green tree."

Awake from your slumber
and rise above the herd
permeate the serpents speech
and their reviling words

-Deuteronomy 12:3

"And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break
their pillars, and burn their groves with fire;
and ye shall hew down the graven images of their
gods, and destroy the names of them out of that place."

The vibrant hive of reason
dormant throughout the Ages
now awaken by revulsion
by revulsion
Apostles of enlightenment arise

Disseminate the words
Sow the seeds of resistance
Let the acts of praise
be a stigma, a mark of dissarray

The malefic miasma of faith
born from malice and from void
Is imposing it's revolting infection
on the innocent and feeble

Hide your faith from the light of reason
Apostles of enlightenment arise
Hide your faith from the light of reason
