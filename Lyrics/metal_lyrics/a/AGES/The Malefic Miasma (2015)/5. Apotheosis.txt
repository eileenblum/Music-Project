Beneath the dying skies,
at the fall of time we rise;
to conquer and divide

At the charred remains,
at the lost and barren domains;
we prey, ravage and dismay

Now, awake and prosper
Renounce your serpents of the past
Tear at the fallacies of ancient words
Rejoice, baptize in flames

As the time is nigh,
believers abide
Coerce or collide!

As the tides will shift,
demise is stern and swift
Behold; apotheosis unfold

Hark, inferior mass!
You vulture seraphim of greed
The surge of our cause is relentless
The march for our cause is endless

Stridently has the prophets bespoken
Zealously has the scriptures been revered
With condescending smiles
and vindictive smiting,
we endure and await
