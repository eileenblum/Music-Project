Rise against the tide
Wielders of reason amass
Stride through the waves,
and they shall follow in our wake
Rise against the tide!

Make them stand aghast
Bestow them with comprehension
Purge the inflicted minds;
spawn of the tyrants
Rise against the tide!

The age of holy order,
will come to pass

Remnants of the vile,
repent and renounce
Rejoice in your rebirth,
we are the postulators now

Far beyond guile and aspersion
The comfort of infinity imbues our finite lives

Spawn of the tyrants;
the ages of holy order will come to pass

The age of holy order
will come to pass
Will come to pass!
