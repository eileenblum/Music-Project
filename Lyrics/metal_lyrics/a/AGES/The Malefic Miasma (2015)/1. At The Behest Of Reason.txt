Far from what is real
Far from sanity's grounds
Your pestilent words have gnawed upon the world
Your putrefying deeds have scarred the face of the earth

How can you not see? How can you not fathom?

The creators that you praise,
are means for domination
and solace for the weak

Why can you not feel? Why are you oblivious?

The creators that you praise,
are means for domination
and solace for the weak

"Mourn for your sins. Obey or perish
There is no peace. Worse and more of his wrath is coming
More fear. Obey God, and land in hell
Amen"

The signs of our redemption is in bound
We are the harbringers of retaliation
At the behest of reason, and the gospel of truth,
the consolation of your prayers will be worthless

Advocates of primeval lies
your beguiling words will be futile
Await the inevitable hegemony;
the end of your chimerical beliefs

Your altars will burn
The shrines will shatter
Inner sanctums buried

Prophets rid
through flames
