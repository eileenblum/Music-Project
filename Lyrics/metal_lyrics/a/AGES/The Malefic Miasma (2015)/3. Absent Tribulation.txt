Endless winds,
tears relentlessly at the summit
Awaiting our arrival,
its megalithic stature is towering infinitely

Towards the celestial sphere,
onwards we strive,
to the uttermost
and final rest

Ravishing lies,
tore at our minds
Purged and gone

Awaiting the truth
Free from deceit
To be revealed

Towards the celestial sphere,
onwards we strive,
to the uttermost gof God

"Our minds are clear,
our heart are at peace
Our serenity beckons the end"

Faith is to no avail
Hope is for the weakened minds,
of the followers of God

From beyond the snow covered pathway
From the forest, from the depths
There in the shades of forgottenness,
in the pages long withered and torn,
lies the rubicon of unmitigated truth

The rapture that never came,
and the absent tribulation,
forces us to heed the archaic ways,
and stipulate our true end as one
