Through the ages of time,
the clarity of our minds have dwindled
The endless pouring of false words,
have clouded our view of reality

Believers, followers - The name of our foe
Hypocrites, despoilers, is what we shall read
Mark their disease riddeen ranks,
with the beauty of endless sacrilege

Now, close your eyes, void is favour to ignorance
Do not listen, do not heed, deceit is all you'll hear

Sprung, from the ashes of time
Creation is beyond comprehension
You will never know, you will never see,
the truth in all its simplicity
Words of truth, forgotten through time
Forgotten, through time
