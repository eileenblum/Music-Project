God prayers never leave
The ways of his relief
They like to torture and pain
If it would bring again
You hear their shabby lies
They feed their bellies while another dies
Come on and whipe them away
So we don't see them for another day

Assorted by Satan
We pray the message of hell
Assorted by Satan
We bring satanic spell

There's bloodlust in your eyes
Come to our sacrifice
The candles lick to the sky
The full moon's rising high
Come dress in leather and spikes
Celebrate till midnight strikes
Hail to our master of Hades
Wait till his league invades

Why should someone be a better man
Just if he prays to the lord
We will never sympathize with them
Ruling the world with a sword
Hail Satan

There's bloodlust in your eyes
Come to our sacrifice
The candles lick to the sky
The full moon's rising high
Come dress in leather and spikes
Celebrate till midnight strikes
Hail to our master of Hades
Wait till his league invades
