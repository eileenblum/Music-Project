Lay me on an anvil, Satan
And forge me in a crow
Let me prey young virgin souls
Make them all kotow

Lay me on an anvil, Satan
And forge me in a spike
Beat me in the chasted hearts
Be the evil strike

Let me be your weapon, Satan
Fight for darkness tough
Let me war with all your force
Fight for you so rough

Let me be your evil spirit
Hold your temple high
From the brightest hell so deep
To the blackest night

All your wiseness give me black lord
Teach me prayers of steel
Give me evil, give me power
Give me prayers of steel

All your wiseness give me black lord
Teach me prayers of steel
Give me evil, give me power
Give me prayers of steel
