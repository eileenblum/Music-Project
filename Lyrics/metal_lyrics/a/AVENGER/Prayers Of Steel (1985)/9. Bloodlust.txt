Fight, we will not fight again
Crashing down our swords in men
Kill and be killed for a facts
With no gain to all at last
Politicians tumble on tongue
Fight themselves than stand as one
Play with lives, they got no
Personality respect

Get up and scream, get up and scream
Throw your fists in the air
Get up and scream, get up and scream
Stand against the war

You see hell's weapon
Cold steel
Bloodlust
You see hell's weapon
Cold steel
Bloodlust

Fear, it's fear what lames the brain
They submit and go insane
Fuck the war machine instead
It's your live, so free your head

You are the evil
But I'm not your slave
Call it defense
It's an highway to the grave

You are the evil
But I'm not your slave
Call it defense
It's an highway to the grave

You see hell's weapon
Cold steel
Bloodlust
You see hell's weapon
Cold steel
Bloodlust
You see hell's weapon
Cold steel
Bloodlust
