See the Earth tear up, flames are rising high
Thunder's roaring like a beast
Modered hands and skulls appear in the flames
The Zombies obey to their priest
See the tries right there in the moonshine
Naked virgins chained to die
A crowd of sinners first made love to shame
Teared up assholes, hear their cries

How the smell of death's coming nearer
And ranked sinners pleasure's near
Cause the living death's just a slave to them
Only Satan's what they fear
How the virgin's flesh
Is spreading round and round
Zombies slaver mixed with blood
And the lord of lies has been satisfied
In this night has died a lot

Southcross Union
Coming straight from hell
Southcross Union
Never break their spell

Southcross Union
Coming straight from hell
Southcross Union
Never break their spell

In the break of dawn there is nothing left
Than a blood red coloured sand
And the insurance that the tales are true
Of hell's Union in the land
Demonic laughter of their lord Lucifer
Joins the sinners on their way
The next sacrifice will be greater
Than soon the hell will come to stay

Southcross Union
Coming straight from hell
Southcross Union
Never break their spell

Southcross Union
Coming straight from hell
Southcross Union
Never break their spell

Southcross Union
Rape you down to hell
