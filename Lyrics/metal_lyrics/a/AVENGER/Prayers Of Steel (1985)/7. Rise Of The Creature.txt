Lightning in the haunted cloudy sky
As the wizard stears the blood
Whispering Lucifer's spells through the night
Creatures wincing in the gut

Attended by wild lightning
It's coming up for you
You won't escape with a bad frightening
It's coming up for you

Wake up, take refuge for death
The rise of the creature
Will take your live away
Wake up, care of what you do
The claws of the creature
Will come right up for you

Frogs, black widows, guts and a virgin's pride
Are all needed for the brew
If the evil creature tastes the scent
It's claws will come right over you

Attended by wild lightning
It's coming up for you
You won't escape with a bad frightening
It's coming up for you

Wake up, take refuge for death
The rise of the creature
Will take your live away
Wake up, care of what you do
The claws of the creature
Will come right up for you

And the wizard stood there in the thunder storm
With his arms spread high up into the sky
And the nature trembled deeply all around
Screams of pain were heard everywhere
As the wizard spunged his hands into the brew
And the creature raised his claw up into the air
Raised his claw up into the air...

Attended by wild lightning
It's coming up for you
You won't escape with a bad frightening
It's coming up for you

Attended by wild lightning
It's coming up for you
You won't escape with a bad frightening
It's coming up for you
