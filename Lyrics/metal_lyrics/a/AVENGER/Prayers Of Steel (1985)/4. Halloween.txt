Dark mountains, thunder and rain
The lightning burns down the sky
Wild creatures howling out in the night
The fire's burning, hell has opened its gates
Satan meets all his wives
They come from everywhere to see him tonight
Dance for him carefree and wild

Black terror, an evil's triumph
Human's meat torn from bones
Warm blood, that's what they're looking for
It is the night of the Underworld
Satan takes his tribute
The demons roll, chaos rules all tonight
For this there's no substitute

Hide your head, oh you better watch out
Aware of danger, don't laugh about
Steal away, there's no more less time
You're struck down in a bestial crime

Halloween - the Earth will start burning
Halloween - there ain't no returning
Halloween - the witch dances on fire
Halloween - the flames high and higher

Dark mountains, thunder and rain

Halloween
