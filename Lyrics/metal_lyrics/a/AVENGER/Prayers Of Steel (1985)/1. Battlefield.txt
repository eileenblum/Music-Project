Warriors going to attack
Another town will fall tonight
On the banner crime and sin
They'll rape the virgins off their skin

Battlefield
Death and glory side by side
Battlefield
Could you say who's wrong or right

All they built up was in vain
Ruins remember former times
Smoke and fire all around
Burning bodies on the ground

Battlefield
Death and glory side by side
Battlefield
Could you say who's wrong or right

There is still a rest of men
Just revenge is on their minds
But if they try to fight back
The tyrant rapes them of their heads

Battlefield
Death and glory side by side
Battlefield
Could you say who's wrong or right

Battlefield
Death and glory side by side

Could you say who's wrong or right
