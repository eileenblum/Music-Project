The seer of the devil
Is knowing the hour is near
There is no survival
So be prepared when it's there

Preachers of evil
Taught you to be mean and cruel
You've learned your lessons
Now your depraved Satan's tool

What's the cause of fearing
Never look back
Face a new life's scene
Then start your attack

Depraved to black
The captor of souls made his raid
Depraved to black

Visions of horror
No, they can't do you no harm
Murder's quite normal
Ain't this a sign for alarm

What's the cause of fearing
Never look back
Face a new life's scene
Then start your attack

Depraved to black
The captor of souls made his raid
Depraved to black

What's the cause of fearing
Never look back
Face a new life's scene
Then start your attack

Depraved to black
The captor of souls made his raid
Depraved to black
Depraved to black
The captor of souls made his raid
Depraved to black
Depraved to black
Black, black, black, black
