Out of work, no money left
No one's at your side
Got no aim, no self respect
While your fighting for your rights
The only freedom's on your wheels
The highway's your district
Gotta feel what power is today

Faster - on Satan's heals
Faster - it's hell on wheels
Faster - at the speed of live
Faster than hell
Faster - on Satan's heals
Faster - it's hell on wheels
Faster - at the speed of live
Faster than hell

Identity's just a word
They'll take it off your mind
But their words, you need no more
With Satan you have signed
The ones who screamed take cover now
The other's suicide
But keep on riding stay right on your way

Faster - on Satan's heals
Faster - it's hell on wheels
Faster - at the speed of live
Faster than hell
Faster - on Satan's heals
Faster - it's hell on wheels
Faster - at the speed of live
Faster than hell

Identity's just a word
They'll take it off your mind
But their words, you need no more
With Satan you have signed
The ones who screamed take cover now
The other's suicide
But keep on riding stay right on your way

Faster - on Satan's heals
Faster - it's hell on wheels
Faster - at the speed of live
Faster than hell
Faster - on Satan's heals
Faster - it's hell on wheels
Faster - at the speed of live
Faster than hell

Faster - on Satan's heals
Faster - it's hell on wheels
Faster - at the speed of live
Faster than hell
Faster - on Satan's heals
Faster - it's hell on wheels
Faster - at the speed of live
Faster than hell
