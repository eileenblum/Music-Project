Immersed in light, broken in flight,
Here comes that scene again,
Not another sleepless night.
Scripted yet stuck on every line,
Upon my face a look of pure surprise,
I thought I'd be fighting fire.

How it's changed from my dream,
Did I stray from the path laid out for me?
How it's changed,
Did I fail in some way?

Easy to plot a course divine,
A simple graph cant cover ever line,
and I dont see what I dont know.
Some truths are harder to perceive,
The color has been drained now from my eyes,
Staring into endless time...
