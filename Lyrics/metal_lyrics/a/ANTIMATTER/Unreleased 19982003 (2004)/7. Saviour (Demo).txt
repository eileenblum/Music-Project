Who hears the voices calling - who calls to rise above them?
Who rises when they've fallen, taking an oath for the trouble they're causing.
Who reaches out for knowing, who knows when they've been chosen?
Who chooses not to burden the path of the brother with light before him.
Saviour...
Who lives a life of slumber, who sleeps upon the water?
Whos water drowns the others, taking an oath for the trouble they're causing.
Who asks a simple question, who knows when who's forgiven?
Who chooses whose redemption?
