What a big man you are
Could fight a war with just your face
Take it on the chin and leave me open-jawed.

What big words you've got,
Reciting lines you've heard on film,
Could write a script with just your lust for respect.

Rip off this face, it can't persist,
Like shadows in the rain, undefined lines,
A symphony muted and greying.
You're not real, and neither are your goals.
