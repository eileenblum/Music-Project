Cautiously take cover in the woodland - no mistakes at all.
Some terrain will catch you at your weakest - careful not to fall.
Stay by the fire, sip from your water, lie in position, the winds blowing colder.
All these conditions will keep you from dying as long as you're looking over your shoulder.
Stay aware of echoes in the moonlight careful not to call.
Don't engage in any kind of dreaming, conscious through it all.
If in doubt find space beside a river, careful not to drown.
Stick it out, there's hope on the horizon - keep from going down.
