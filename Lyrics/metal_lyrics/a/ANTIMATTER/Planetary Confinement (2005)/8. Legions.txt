[Moss]

Stony and grey is the whore
And long are the days in the morgue
Where God is a wall
Where God is a wall to look upon

Legions and hordes
The seas have been torn
And buildings remain where they fall
And I solemnly walk
Through legions and hordes
A dark mass of infidel

Long is the howl at the end
A cry from the tail echoing
And fools reverberate
And fools reverberate and carry on...

What have they done to themselves?
Look what they've done to themselves.

If you don't learn to leave this thing alone
You'll never get to see the sun again
You won't come out on top
The seed is sown
