[Patterson]

Look inside and find the parts
Bringing forth the lines of sanity
A broken mind and open heart
Torn apart without lucidity
Consummate and turn the page
Embrace the change from what you used to be
Procreate and fade away
I guess it's time to face your memories
Broken spirits open fears
Darksome shades combine fragility
Frigid smiles across the miles
Guilty eyes surmise asymmetry
Relapse on both sides of the tracks
Ashing back to taste the irony
Manipulate and slip away
Embrace the shame of what you used to be
Rain washed the panic from today
Decimation of anxiety
Tribulations drift away
Pray tomorrow offers clarity
Rain washed the panic from today
Affirmation of mortality
Trivialities astray
Pray tomorrow brings stability
