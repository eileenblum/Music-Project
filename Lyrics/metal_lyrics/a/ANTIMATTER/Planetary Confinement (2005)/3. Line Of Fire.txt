[Patterson]

Face the panic of today
Breaking barriers of yesterday
I fell into the line of fire
I broke down in the line of fire
Shattered past, and future fears
Take a moment far away from here
Cut the strings and fly away
Cut the strings and fly away
Taste the hell you put us through
Grace the heavens I could promise you
Take a hand in the line of fire
Make a stand behind the wire
