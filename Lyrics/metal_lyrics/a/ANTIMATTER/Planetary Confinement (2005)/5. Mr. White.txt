[Trouble]

I'm supposed to talk to you
Don't even know where to start
Don't want to stand with the setting sun
Tell me does it really show?

I'll promise you anything
Place your hand over your heart
Don't want to fool myself anymore
Think nobody else will ever know

Mr. White up all night
Hiding in my room
Mr. White so uptight
Black shapes of doom

Could never show you how I feel
Even so I didn't care
It's only that inside
I'm so tired
So tired of being all alone

Now the hours are breathing
Gone like tears in yesterdays rain
I remember voices telling me
Secrets of mind-changing reality

Mr. White up all night
Hiding in my room
Mr. White so uptight
Black shapes of doom

Mr. White up all night
Always likes to sing
Mr. White so uptight
Even knows my name
