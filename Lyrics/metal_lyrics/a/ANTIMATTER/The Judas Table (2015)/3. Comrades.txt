Did you drop your torch in the dark?
The lights went out;
You scraped along the wall to find the door.

Did you fall from the pavement, again?
You woke up screaming â
Alone, and covered in sweat.

Where are your comrades, now?
They must be lost...
Where are your comrades, now?

Could you buy the opulence?
Of peers and promises?
Wise not to wait...

In the haze of the moment, they said,
"He was all about the morals,"
And swiftly sent humility to bed.

And even though they're all liars and thieves,
Your own act of contrition
Was deemed to be enough to cut you free.

Where are your comrades, now?
They must be fools...
Where are your comrades, now?

Could you buy the opulence?
Of peers and promises,
Dusted on their face?

Was your sinking ship quickly hemorrhaging rats,
All the way down?
Were you disconnected, when a common sap

Head-pausing refrains!

Did you think that if that's the way they played?
When all is said and done,
You're better off without them, anyway...?
