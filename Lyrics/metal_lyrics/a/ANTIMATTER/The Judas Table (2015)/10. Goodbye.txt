Goodbye to you,
I almost fell by the colours cast at your side
Goodbye to you, you never were well
And your symptoms testified

Here in heart, this house of mine,
I'll learn from your lesson so well

Goodbye to you, you're unhooked from my world
So this battle I have won
But is it too late to bid farewell,
When you're only almost gone?
When you're only almost gone
