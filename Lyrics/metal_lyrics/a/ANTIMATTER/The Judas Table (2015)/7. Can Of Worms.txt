Witnessed the trade right in front of my face
From a soulmate to a little girl playing mindgames

It was a trick of the light, a movement inside
Stop and breathe in as the clock strikes midnight
Time to run home, here comes the slide
Too late this time

You couldn't hide your can of worms

Spat in my eye, played the victim with pride
And yet all the while you were ripping me off and bleeding me dry

And you tried so hard to keep them locked inside

And you tried so hard to keep the lid nailed tight
But they're riggling so fast in your mind
And it's a constant world, so anyone who lays by your side
Well they're gonna wake in worms every time
