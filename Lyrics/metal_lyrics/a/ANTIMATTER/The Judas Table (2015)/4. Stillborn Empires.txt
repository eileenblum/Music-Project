When we first met you were on the run
From situations and the bad things that you'd done
And then you did the same to me, now you're irrevocably gone
And still on the run

Daddy didn't want you and mummy gave you pain
Now anyone who gets inside is just gonna get the same
Should we sound the horn or is it all a crying shame?
Who cares who's to blame,
The outcome is all the same...

Just another dream that died
To stillborn empires
Just another dream that died
In stillborn empires

She was on the outside but never looking in
And men were just a resource to capitalize with
They're so fucking dumb
All you do is lead them with their dicks
And it's all a game

But daddy's little stick horse, she had her blinkers down
For all her little easy toys were sentient and proud
So they drop the coin and they pissed her fire out
And kiss on the change, step up and hold her reins
Just another dream that died
To stillborn empires
Just another dream that died
In stillborn empires
It was a business doing pleasure with you
