On and on and on the sound
An air to drag you down before you've stayed too long
And when you realize what lies behind those crooked eyes
You're bought and sold

Of all the wasted avenues, the bitterest of pills to choose

Down in a hole, deep enough to drown

When at first the trap was laid,
You showed your wicked face
And held your gaze too long
With far too much for you to prove
