The animals are out for all that they can get
Put a light to the candle and the callers call to come collect
See if you can make a stand for all that's straight and true
When there's hands in the contents of all you stand to lose

Integrity, with colour and code we find harmony
Integrity, we cover our soil with indemnity
Integrity, what's the point if no-one else has any?

And it's spitting in my eye, every time it boils down to this
And it's not the same, and they're not the same as me
But it always seems to be that dog eats dog,
And that's the only rule
And if you don't play, then you're really just a fool

Am I really just a fool?

Integrity, with colour and code we find harmony
Integrity, we cover our soil with indemnity
Integrity, what's the point if no-one else has any?
Am I really just a fool?
Really just a fool?
Is real strength in untruth?
Real strength in untruth?
