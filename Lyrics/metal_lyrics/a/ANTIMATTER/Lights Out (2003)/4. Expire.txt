[Patterson]

Innocence and irony,
A a dark shade of fantasy as the serpent slips right into me
Living out your fallacy,
I'm just another casualty of casual insanity.

Summers white cause the sun has gone,
But it wont be long 'til tomorrow comes and you're on the run with what you've taken.
Knowing what I should have known, I'm staring at the telephone,
And I think our god has been and gone, but I'm still waiting.

I've a solution. a final solution
