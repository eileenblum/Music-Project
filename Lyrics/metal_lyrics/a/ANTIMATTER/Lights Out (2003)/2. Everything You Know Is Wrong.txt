[Moss]

I looked to the skies,
Turning away with blackened eyes.
I'm a stranger on a train, you're all strangers on a train.

Sorry to confuse you, but all that you know is wrong
And there's just no name for whats gone on.

I've walked on thin ice just to feel mystified,
As we spin through outer space...

Sorry to confuse you, but all that you know is wrong
And there's just no name for whats gone on.
