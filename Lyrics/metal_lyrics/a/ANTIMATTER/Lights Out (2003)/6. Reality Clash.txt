[Patterson]

Resist you never could you never will bare my soul for a moment of delusion blame it on the past catching up to take the glory without substance selling someone else's soul to take you further falling deeper into false stealing heroes you don't realise the shit you're in for once its come around again so exercise your right to run your right to ruin

Breaking away from broken days of shame and illusion,
Playing the game.
Validate a life of lies,
So high on manufactured pride.

Faking away, making waves to gain,
Reality astray, delusion paved the way.
While we made it to the other side,
You lost your pride and your alibis.
