We're in love, we're on the same page
Sliding off each other's frame
It's not enough to say our prayer
There's nothing coming up for air

Feeding as one
Lost in our portrait of rage
Here in our song
The essence of love and betrayal
Partner's in crime
Lover's in grime, fuckers entwined
Partner's in crime
Leeches in brine, grapes on the vine

We're in hell, can't leave this dark place
Try to break and I'm on your tail
If all that suffers is real
Then it's only us who feel
Only us who feel

My strength in your weakness
Your fail is my winning
Your strength is my weakness
My failing, your kisses

We're on our own
Come on, we're fearless
Come on and feed it
Normalise.
