You've been rowing out to sea for two thousand days
And you can't see the shore, or remember how it feels

I am here to help
I am here to make sense out of this world
What do you want me to do?

You've been dissolving me in salt
Drowning me in bleach
I've been going up in smoke
You've not given me an inch

I am here to help
I am here for reason, for thought
What do you want me to do?

Take heed in the weight of the words I say
As we fall into another day.
