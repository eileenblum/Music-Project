Take me with you when you go, I'm not staying here alone,
Push the button by the phone...
Inner freedom overshadows greed and reasons to stick around,
Crazy dreaming keeps me gleaming you'll be seething going down.
I'd waited so long, but the dream was over before it had begun,
I've waited so long, now you haven't time to run...
