And so you had the last laugh - ha ha ho...
I laughed you off a long time ago.
Your ever changing personality never fails to tickle me at all.
You said you were a white witch,
Reminds me of a movie that you'd seen.
Well can you still open doors with just your mind?
In this little space in time, I've played with better things.
Everything you done...
The games you said you'd won - I still remember all to well.
The foes that fought and lost - the fools that bore your cross - I still
remember all to well.
And it's all a state of mind.
I've seen you crave affection,
Affected minds don't work too evenly.
Well what did you call it when you stabbed me in the back?
And rewrote in retrospect lovers pain.
Where do you find redemption? Tucked away in pre-recorded dreams?
Do you wake each morning wondering when it came?
The experiments in pain no longer here in my world.
