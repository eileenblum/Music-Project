Of all the foals upon the tallest hill
With aching intent to walk
Who has the salt to stand of their own will?
With no consequence at all

Fear of a unique identity

To seal in stone inclusion with the pack
Where safety comes being one
Every move must be part of the act
And not overstep the mark

To stand alone is to be exposed
A shining light in a concrete world
A target sign for the legions and hordes

With fading I, the lie is born
Stealing minds from the vacant halls
Sold alive to the dominant law
