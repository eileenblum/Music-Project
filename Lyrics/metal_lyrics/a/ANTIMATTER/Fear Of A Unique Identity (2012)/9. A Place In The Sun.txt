From a place up high itâs been decreed
That crimes against your God shall set you free
For all the holy men will take a seat
And advocate the cause with apathy

And if you make enough mess when the working day is done
Youâre guaranteed a place in the sun

If the plates were laid out differently
In your honoured place Iâd rather be
So if you hesitate or lose belief, just believe
And think of all the cunts that youâll receive

And if you make enough mess when you murder number one
Youâre guaranteed a place in the sun
