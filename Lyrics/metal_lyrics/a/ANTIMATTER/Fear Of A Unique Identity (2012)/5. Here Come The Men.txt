Here come the men, they understand
Each otherâs need for other men
For all alone thereâs no defence
Thereâs no saviours

Here come the dogs theyâre on the path
They sense each otherâs comfort breath
Theyâre sickly drunk with confidence
So give it up

Itâs not the way they change, but how they stay the same
In the coldness of the hollow streets here

Here come the men theyâre in their cars
Here come the men with scarecrow arms
Here come the men, letâs be alarmed
As the contest begins

Get on the daisy chain, and forfeit sense for gain
In the coldness of the hollow streets here

Are you big enough?
Are you strong enough?
Are you hard enough?
Are you flush enough?
Are you hung enough?
Are you straight enough?
Are you white enough?
