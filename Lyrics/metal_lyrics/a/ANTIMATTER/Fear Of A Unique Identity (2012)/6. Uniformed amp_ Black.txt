Theyâll wake you up when youâre sane
Come rape what morals remain
And love you to fold away
When they spill out on display

Donât breed on me

The mindless will fall into place
No will to hold back the parade
And then when theyâre forced and arranged
Theyâll move like the wind shifts the rain

Embracing a lie
Got stuck on rewind
Requiem in constant replay
