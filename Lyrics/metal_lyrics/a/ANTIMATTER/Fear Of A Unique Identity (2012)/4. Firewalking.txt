As a man youâll understand liberty
But stay aware when you hear the sirens ring
Know your foe, for where he walks you will never perceive the colour of freedom

You can walk with your eyes wide open through coal
But the harder you try itâs blowing so slow

Build a wall between your soul and reality
Only then will your head be truly free
Paint a face over your veins so nobody can see the horror youâre feeling

Are you praying for an end to this?

Weâd all love to fly away
