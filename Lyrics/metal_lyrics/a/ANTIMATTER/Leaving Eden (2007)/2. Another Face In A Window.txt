[Moss]

They're all the same, assimilated
And here am I born of a lost cause
The underdog, an alien in drag, dying
So who's to say there's any shame in
being alone when the dogs are outside
In packs of ten, their muzzles removed, biting
I tried to save my inner sanctum
While all around were still playing with fire
The fact remains
I've never been moved to sell myself
I don't want to be another face in a window
Seeing life through a screen, bathed in a warm glow
Fade like so ...
