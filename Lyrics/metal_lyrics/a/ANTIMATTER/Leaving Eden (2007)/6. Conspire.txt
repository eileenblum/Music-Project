[Moss]

While I lie here burning, you're encased in ice
With tainted eyes upon your tainted soul
It's no wonder I'm so cold
A terrible thing I'm learning as tears are turned to ice
These four walls will be my dreaded foes
As I rot here in this hole

Do you conspire to hold me down?
Do you conspire to hold?
Do you conspire to hold me down?
Have I wasted a dream?

Restless seas will murder me tonight
As you appease effortlessly the open mouths of hungry thieves
There'll be no silent empathy inside
No colour or shades of hope
