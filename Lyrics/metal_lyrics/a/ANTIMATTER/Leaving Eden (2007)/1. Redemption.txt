[Moss]

I should take what's left of this for myself
I've had the pieces stripped
By long hands feeding small minds
And I never thought that this could come back
I failed to do it right
And took long strides into the firing line
And the less I feel alive the less I feel alive
Who lifts the sin from the man?
From the corner of the ring we gave up
The optimist had died, leaving the black side to tow the line

[solo]

Who is the sin from the man, who is the sin?
Looks like it's gonna be another one of those rainy days again...
