Have you heard all the lies already
Are you just a puppet in the grand scheme?
Are you just a grey faceless statistic
In their well oiled machinery?
Do you even feel ashamed
When you didn't even fight back?

Ride down the Omega highway
Towards the obvious dead end
(No point turning back)
Sit down and enjoy the comedy
Cause it doesn't even feel like a tragedy

They can't promise anything new
All their words are disguised serpents
Poisonous arrows to penetrate you
Leader after leader
Hypocrite after hypocrite
Via Crucis - we all should die

Ever thought how the history repeats itself
Ever read how the empires fell?
Do you feel being in a historic loop
In Omega Ouroboros
Remember the past days
For they will be your last

Ride down the Omega highway
Towards the obvious dead end
(No point turning back)
Sit down and enjoy the comedy
Cause it doesn't even feel like a tragedy

Liber Omega â You are the last one
Liber Omega â The ignorant puppet
Liber Omega â You are the last one
Liber Omega â The Armageddon child
