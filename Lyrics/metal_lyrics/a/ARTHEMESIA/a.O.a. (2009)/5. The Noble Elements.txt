See me, ancient one!
Dismal Tuat, Nergal unsafe
Spread your shades upon me
Spread your shades

I can see you, you in me
In the Astral Mirror, above all
Old grey spirit; Supreme One

Crescent to the full
Thoth, cloak us into misery
Serve us to the Genii

Hear me, hear me!
Setekh, let me enter you...
We, the Gods, in the desert winds
