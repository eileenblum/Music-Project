Observing the Starless Sky, 
I Remain Silent. 
Gazing Through the Universe, 
I Start to Laugh. 
Aeons Ago I was Born, 
from the Ash of the Stellar Mist. 
And with a Touch of Immortality, 
I Became the Mocker of life. 
[chorus:]
"Ride, My Steed of Silver, 
Ride Through the Flaming Clouds." 
"Witness My Triumphant Coming, 
Witness My Hate." 
"Hear My Grim Battlecry, 
Low Your Heads 
and Prepare to Die! 
(For) I am the Personification of Death, 
I am the Mocker of life!" 
Blazing Cloak Upon Me, 
I Memorize My Fallen Prey. 
Time is Again on My Side, 
as the Worlds, They do Collapse. 
Curse the day When I Shall Fall, 
When My Might is Gone. 
Never Shall Thine Blades Wound Me, 
Never Shall Thine Storms Catch Me. 
[chorus:]
As I Glare - Upon My Scythe 
To See -  My Next Realm What to Crush . 
Once Again - I Clench That Helve Tight 
and Prepare - for My Feast.
