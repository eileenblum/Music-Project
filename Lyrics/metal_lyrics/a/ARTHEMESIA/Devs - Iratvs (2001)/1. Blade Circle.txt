Portal of the Holder, 
Keeper of the Seven Blades! 
Portrait of the Order, 
Silver on the 5th. Horn! 
Six Dying Stars, 
Opens the Secrets to Thine Legacy! 
Nine Towers Climbing High, 
28 Shady Steps to Power! 
Under the Sullen Ancient Sky, 
69 Disciples are Chanting Nocturnal Verses, 
The Prophet of the Luciferian Eye 
Raises His Arms and Bows then: 
"Deliver Us, O`Mighty SATAN,  
from all Past Error and Delusion,"

"That, having Set Our Foot  
upon the Path of Darkness  
and Vowed Ourselves  
to Thy Service,"  
"We may not Weaken in Our Resolve, 
but with Thy Assistance,  
Grow in Wisdom  
and Strenght" 
Blade Circle!
