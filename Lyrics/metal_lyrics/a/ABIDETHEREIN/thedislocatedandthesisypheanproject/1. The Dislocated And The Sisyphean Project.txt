Disfigured morgue over cliff
Your body counts rain
And now pulverizing the parasite
Apex pain, and floating bodies
A basement reflected horror
Flies and rats share your diaries
Unconventional ways to deform the absent anger among dismemberment
Injecting hatred and vomits in veins
And no one would reanimate your brain
Abomination gorging, editable notes
Set fire to a ditch as an ashen jail absorbs my misery
Migratory species bred a new type of blinded seas
Disgusting greedy human race upon my empty chest
And no one will reveal or spawn disgrace to the outer world
Intoxicated sway, chartered halls of silence
Homogenize a movement so the masses burn the last seed of conjuration

Trails and tribulations, open your eyes, rebuild the truth
The hours of anticipation, the catharsis, the blood
Essentially undescended drops, the blow

Life is what you're thinking of, not the red lines made by flesh
This plague called pale infects their brains, to reap hatred from every word that warps
We fight for justice, we fight for the youth
Destruction forged in race, the early torn vermin eradicated
The dislocated, the sisyphean
Undetected though yielded strength and hope
Grant us lust of freedom to attack their ivory slumber and forms
Prevalent grains of cognition, subjects to be learned and lies to believe
Sparks and numbers
Armours crashed in Obliteration, zero coffins to mock
Existence beyond law and we shall contaminate all scenes of rolling and balance
The black ghost of prison roves unto horrid, feral, blinded reign
Subconscious crux, leader formed solitude

Sub cosmic visions and swept the great toxic prophet's eye
Benthos and the false wound both for and against the whip
The waste of words, the waste of veiled wisdom
Suspended symbols of ignorance
Absolute sickness and fool
Gaping lies of free speech.
Tongues were cut and scum replaced sight to nowhere
Prevail us upon martyrs

Divide the slaves, remove their entrails
Evolving towards the travelling birds

Across black rolling fire a tempest swells, brooding
A void force on the horizon sweeping in to bring conclusions
The answers and themes intersected

Destructive purity betrothed prevail, memorials of the nameless mutants
Rifts beyond the clutch of men
We enthrone the shape of perpetuate, we inhale perfection from the sky
