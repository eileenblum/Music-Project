The darkness of rain rises above their heads
Carefully considers in the winds that scattered
Entwine us with great battle magic till we stand knee-deep in gore
The crows will pick your bones clean
Never sweet the kiss of cold steel
Three stars aligned to assuage the newborn cries
And in the nine scrolls thine death prophesied
Destruction, poverty and discrimination
I shall carve my path in carnage
And inscribe my saga upon the scrolls
Of legendry in the spilled blood of slaughtered kings
Will suck lives from their intestines over the bodies that distorted
My deeds may yet inspire the skids
As I pull Mercan shafts from my bloodied thews

This last fight against your books
Either appointed to be followed and die or to live like the thorns in hell
Things of passion things of crime, life is just a waste of time
Pain is slipping very deep, you fall in endless sleep
Setting barrage to these souls, like feasting millions control
Tears erupted caressed by fear, mourners of a dying world
Cherished hopes beyond your grasp, dormant lives are cast aside
Infiltrate the weakened mind, succumb to death

The crows will pick your bones clean
Never sweet the kiss of cold steel
Three stars aligned to assuage the newborn cries
And in the nine scrolls thine death prophesied
Destruction, poverty and discrimination
This last fight against your books
Either appointed to be followed and die of to live like the thorns in hell
And should end the suffering of man
Wielding this cosmic power, the universe isn't mine to conquer
Moguls, the carnage of that first clash was fire tore gloriously

Trembling naked figures, marched into the courtyard
Tender flesh is seared and ripped, tides of blood released
In the name of god, man destroying man
I pray that I can, see beyond my flesh
Organs breaking through your skin, slow decay from within
All behold the dead, doomed to face a painful end
Believe the words that sharpen our teeth, and not the slurs of the youth
You're not what they say, you are unborn yet
