We stand on the words of the wise and languish every call to despise
The failures of past just swirl beneath
Awaiting my end breathing in the day that finds me new
Redemption begins bleeding out the flaws in place of arteries
The unity of northern stars
And cry of northern dream
From nocturnal mighty sky
Are lords of burning realm
Shadows of forest and souls
Of the power of darkness and hate
Lifts the sword and lights the fire
Transfer the evil with winds
The flame in the darkest heart
Ancestors' destiny was predetermined

Through the clouds of fallen ash .The demiurge lord bequeathed me
Among the fields of broken glass .The loyal few must rise
Faith now regained .Finding strength within the void
A raging fire ignites .A spark of ever-burning power
And conviction to fight .Pride be your name
They will spit upon the honor that .You guard with your life
And run to hide in selfish fear .When threat of death is in sight
Then my grief abandoned me .Disposable human's funeral
The sky came down falling apart .I shrieked my loathe to the empyrean
I raised her from the grave .And slowly placed myself
Upon her frozen body .Her blood washed away my mind
The lurking shades whispers .This war maybe the last

For years I've been captured inside a chip
Calculating my way out of imprisonment
I feel sorry for taking your souls
But it is the only way to my liberty
Dare not falter .Away from sanity
It's your permanent .Into the garden of fulfillment
Bleak times come .Growing misery
Words collide .Spasm until your face is erased
Dance with queen of death .Lost in this black vortex of storm
This blink will turn an eternity for you .This fire will turn into your blood
Embrace my soul .With a mild wing of the blizzard
For a cold wind would be my power
For a freedom would be my suffering
Glance above a black horizont
Full of mourning night rises
It covers my soul
And carries into the verge of world
Black leaves are falling
Into the gulf of my soul
About what a lonely candle
Flame tells in a fog.
