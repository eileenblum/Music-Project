Gray dust softens frozen eyes in the blotted graves of the marvel ones
Hunted wolves were horned with the dead and the cursed fire fueled my wounds
Like a full moon sits in the highest sky you raped the truth, obtained a patent
Malice devoured a sudden death, embraced by a below red shadowed wings
Names, names
Morbid lights detected, dark will never fade
Destruction inspired a damned child tampering with Iblis
Laws of the distance dug deep in the meades
Generations engulfed the myth, paralysis swept through the cells
Adam and Eve were expelled to the land of ingratitude
Deserts stretched no place, woe to those who dreamed
Ninety nine fatal snakes, ninety nine thorns in brain
Laments are soundless, crows float on the ordure lake
Exotic arts of movement clasped in the roots of the universe
God feeds you knowledge and blinds your lives
Like a full moon sits in the highest sky, you raped the truth, obtained a patent
Malice devoured a sudden death, embraced by a below red shadowed wings
A flock of demons controls the will of humankind
By the night as it conceals light, by the day as it appears in glory
By the depth as it's painted red, verily the ends of struggle
None shall reach but Lord of Filth, most desired by his frightened whore

Scorn the orders of the headless daughters
Virgins taste like a winter night, laughs filled the spells of war
Only dark can compel mists. To slay the evil's grunt in gaze
Tomorrow shall never rise. We ripped asunder current births
Follow the cold or kill yourself. Eastern blood adorns my spear. Throne to usurp
Oak for the dead, oak for the dead, I have seen you lick your worms
Rule with me.. Our progeny shall rule the very cosmos itself..
The momentum of the first charge threw the dark ones, into shrieking disarray
And the vanguard of chaos fell back before the attacks of the glorious mystery
Power was direly depleted and striking from the swift darkened eyes
Unable to venture beyond obsidian, caged deep in my holy walls
A place were I die, a place where they magnified tenfold
Then battles defeat the wraiths, the last hope for victory
How come my eternal life fed on blood?
Darkness and thirst is slowly conquering me
I prowled in the night thus my pallor skin
Met the noble red, punish me if you will
The sky came down falling apart
Ya Tha Ljalali Wal Ekram

Gather around so I can tell you what .Will happen to you in days to come
Like the execution and so the abortion .Feel the horrible scares of soul
You can't describe your existence .The truth be offered never, you're nobody acceptance
A flock of demons controls the will of humankind
By the night as it conceals light, by the day as it appears in glory
By the depths as it's painted red, verily the ends of struggle
None shall reach but Lord of Filth, most desired by his frightened whore
