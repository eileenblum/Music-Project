Burdens saddle the cryptic mortals
Hold your scars and kill your breed
Finding heaven is not your aim
Ancient died, cadaverous autumns
Oh sight drag me again where beauty witnesses death
In the wake of mist you rouse
Under dawn and purity
Like a false pregnancy you guile us all
Can you be or set me free?
The blackest blood, throwing organs
Crawling down the devouring pale
Bliss of grief hath opened veins
Alla slays, confusion on will
Let your reasons resurrect the speech of god and phallus
Inhibited corpse, verminous stench
Obscured by a lake of shit
Echoes fade each time you kill
Never remain never deceive
Worship your shame, purify your dead soul

Burdens saddle the cryptic mortals

In the wake of mist you rouse
Under dawn and purity
Like a false pregnancy you guile us all
Can you be or set me free?
Empty feelings nothing is real
Sacrificed unto tomb of hate
Harmed, uncolored
Ugly, taboo
Let your reasons resurrect the speech of god and phallus
Inhibited corpse, verminous stench
Screaming fills your empty mind
Shadowed coffin in my hands
I raise my arms
And close my eyes

Black rain creates fear on earth
