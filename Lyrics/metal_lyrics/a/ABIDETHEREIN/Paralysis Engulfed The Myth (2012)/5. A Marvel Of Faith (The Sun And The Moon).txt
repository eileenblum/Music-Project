Many lost lives, shapeless hurt
Left aside, slaughtered
Shivering voice, golden ice
Groaning in, wondered
Frightfully touched by death, growling souls
Is this a way to hell? Or madness?
Thrown down into a void, suffer again
Bleed, that's what it said
In a crooked ground old as forest, singing
Wolves only surrounded, gates were opened
In my mouth, claws
Descended from this vault
I beleave that the skies are cladding sin
And beleave that the grace of being dead cursed me
Here they come, sons of flesh
Rise from below
I've become one of them
The blade that faces death
Here I am through the gloom
Chained to a norm

No time to taste your sweet or breathe
Everything taken away even the chance to dream
What you once believed in does not exist
Do not compromise or clean your wounds
Suffering from oppression inside lies
Maddening feeling grows
Plunging into the depths of rage
Marching towards freedom through hate
Darkening thoughts remain
When things seem to fall apart
The burning passion was just a decoy
The swarm of my deteriorated mind
Guided by the words I hear
Heretics towards the night, this is my pandemonium,
With the burning seas of the moon
The warm blood swept int the abyss
I am the enemy, I am the chosen cause of blaze
Sin after sin, the level of the dead priest is down...
Incarcerated in
Goring the votaries of slipping mutants, is this our aim?
Mourners of a dying world, afflict with terror, their lives suppressed
Maggots grow deep inside, and the marvel of faith declined
