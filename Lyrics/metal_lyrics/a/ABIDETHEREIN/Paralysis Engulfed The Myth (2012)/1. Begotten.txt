Smattering, entrails stucked in throat
Drinking from the poison spring
Collecting remains..
Born in the world of hell no place to belong but earth 
Exiled in the far reaches of a mindless scream
Your blood is the way, salvation's here
To pick out the hatred thorns of your naked skull
To build your scarlet world
To live in darkness

There'll be no subterfuge for stay
In a land of wicked and void
Leave your fear inside your waters
Holly Mother hath lived in scum
Behold when serpents flood on the riseth legacy
Were dejection mixed with fire
And more lousiness to be seen
Alif Lam Mim Ra.
Like the dead things, love hath buried at birth with your blindfold heresy
Your blood is the way, salvation's here
To pick out the hatred thorns of your naked skull
To build your scarlet world
To live in sadness

These are the signs of the book
That which hath been revealed unto thee
From thy lord is the truth
But most men will never believe.

Cast inside your shrine
Creeping to the tomb where shelter from the lustful fire inside your mind
A flickering funeral bells ring
Unleashed memory hath killed your child
Vultures reached the shore
Gathered from the battle where love betrayed the dead
Throats were cut and flies guarded corpse
From the molten gold on there heads
Fields of growth sprout arms, legs, brides
For the tyrant war in which I bright
Deception narrows sunset
When temples burned and lambs survived
Tomorrow greets the birth of the similar boom
That wrapped in a tripped musty skin
Horror beneath the dark, invaded trees
Even the reign of man was blind
Do not believe that chaos decays
Mental rope round your neck

A vital spark in my grave
