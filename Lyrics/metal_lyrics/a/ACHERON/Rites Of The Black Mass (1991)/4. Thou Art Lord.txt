Glory to thee almighty satan
Highest and ineffable king of hell
Bring forth joy from the infernal realm
To the disciples of the black flame

[Chorus:]
We praise thee, we bless thee, we adore thee
We give thee thanks for thy glory

Hear us oh prince of darkness
Lord of the abyss of hell
Thou art the true god of the earth
Filling the earth with its needed pleasure

[Chorus:]
Thou art lord, thou alone, oh mighty satan
Thou art ruler of earth
Satanas, thou art lord

We pray to thee, unholy master
To grant us all the things we ask
For thou hast the power from beyond
And through you, blessing are received

[Chorus:]
Thou art lord, thou alone, oh mighty satan
Thou art ruler of earth
