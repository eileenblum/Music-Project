The gate is closed yet the flame burns from within.
Vessels for satan's power made up of lust and sin.
Open the mysteries of your creation.
Make us partakers of undefiled wisdom.

Forget ye not what was and is to be.
Hidden powers of hell open your eyes to see.
Flesh without sin, world without end.
Unholy blessings we now ask you to send.

We the spawn of evil give you endless glory.
An abomination of power is soon to be.

We now clear the air with the silver bell.
Answer our wishes from this ancient spell.
Let us depart, the mass is now done.
