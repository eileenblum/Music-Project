Satan I summon thee from your infernal place,
You who have been said to have fallen from grace.
Hear our call as we cry our in blasphemy.
Come forth from the void and reveal yourself to me.

[Chorus:]
Evil lord hear our cries
Prince of hell we ask you to rise

Lucifer, I summon thee, oh bearer of light.
Cast thy shadow over the earth on this blackened night.
Take flight on leathern wings and show us desire.
Come forth oh evil one from the searing lake of fire.

[Chorus:]
Rise now from the flame
We pronounce your unholy name

Belial and leviathan I also summon thee,
Master of the shadowed woods and of the briney sea.
Come forth as we now say all the sacred words
We your faithful children now walt to be heard.

[Chorus:]
Hail satan, crucifier
Flesh and blood, hell's desire
