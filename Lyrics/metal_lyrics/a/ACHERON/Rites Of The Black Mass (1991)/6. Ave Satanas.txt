Hail satan, full of might,
Our allegiance is with thee.
Cursed are they, the god adorers,
And cursed are the worshippers of the nazarene.

[Chorus:]
Ave satanas, ave satanas

Unholy satan, bringer of enlightment,
Lend us thy power, now and throughout our lives.
Endless glory shall be given.
Lord of hell, show us thy way.

[Chorus:]
Ave satanas, ave satanas

Jesus christ, we deny thy name.
