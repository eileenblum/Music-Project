Before the mighty prince of darkness
In the presence of the lords of hell
I do confess to my past error,
Despising the ways and path of god.

Proclaiming that satan rules the earth,
Making a covenant to honor his name.
Unholy power fulfills my desires.
Triumph follows from my chosen will.

Remove the likes of the imposter,
He who would deny us pleasures of thy realm.
Make us worthy to the infernal kingdom,
Now and for all eternity!
