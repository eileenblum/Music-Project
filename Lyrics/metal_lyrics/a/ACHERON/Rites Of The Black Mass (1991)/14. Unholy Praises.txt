Oh lord of darkness we entreat you
Accept the sacrifice on this unholy night
By your mark you make us prosper
Under thy protection all is done

In unholy fellowship we praise and honor thee
Lucifer, beelzebub, belial,
Leviathan, asmodeus, and abbadon

We call upon the mighty names
Of asgaroth, nergal and behemoth
And the nameless forms of hell
Strengthen us in mind, body and will
