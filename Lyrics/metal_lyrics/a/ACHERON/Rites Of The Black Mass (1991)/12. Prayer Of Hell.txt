Our father, who art in hell,
Hollowed be thy name.

Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
On earth as it is in hell.

We take this night our rightful due
And trespass not on path of pain.

Lead us into temptation and
Deliver us from false piety.

For thine is the kingdom,
Of power and glory forever.

We shall praise your unholy name.
Satan shall emerge again!

Amen
