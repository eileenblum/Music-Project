Breathe deeply, clear your head
Leave the world behind you
Undead gods, they await
So enter the chamber
Sit right down and gaze
Into the magick mirror
Your body, it feels
All the stored lifeforce

Necromanteion communion, a vampiric rite
Necromanteion communion, the immortal sight
Necromanteion communion, beyond thoughts of time
Necromanteion communion, for the royal bloodline
Necromanteion communion, enlightenment from beyond
Necromanteion communion, sacred nightside bond
Necromanteion communion, on an astral plane
Necromanteion communion, those who have risen again

See the patterns of dark and light
The dreamlike images begin
Time to use vampiric eyes
To go even further
Remain calm, open the gate
Sense the manifestation
Sacrifice the lifeforce
Now embrace the calling

Necromanteion communion, a vampiric rite
Necromanteion communion, the immortal sight
Necromanteion communion, beyond thoughts of time
Necromanteion communion, for the royal bloodline
Necromanteion communion, enlightenment from beyond
Necromanteion communion, sacred nightside bond
Necromanteion communion, on an astral plane
Necromanteion communion, those who have risen again

Hail the elder gods
The Annukaki kind
