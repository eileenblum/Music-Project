Full moon rises, as clouds fill the sky
Bonfires burning for the priesthood of Ur

Ancient hymns being sung in Sumerian, invoking
All the kindred spirits of our kind
Hands are raised in the shape of the secret sign
To show allegiance to the darkside

The magical circle all join hands
Chanting the words of a vampiric rite

Ancient hymns being sung in Sumerian, invoking
All the kindred spirits of our kind
Hands are raised in the shape of the secret sign
To show allegiance to the darkside

An acolyte holds up a crystal skull and places
It into the trapezoid

Now those present look into the blackened sky
To commit an act of praise... akhkharu

Undead celebration
