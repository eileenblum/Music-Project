Forces of darkness I conjure thee
Bring the ancients to my realm

Let the magick flow this night
To keep lifeforce alive
Bless my sacred shrine
Glare with your dragon eyes

Feel the power that burns in me
Consume "the blood" of my victims

Let the magick flow this night
To keep lifeforce alive
Bless my sacred shrine
Glare with your dragon eyes

Immortal gods, grant me, all the power and strength that you possess
Make me a part royalty, joining ancient ones

So mote it be!
