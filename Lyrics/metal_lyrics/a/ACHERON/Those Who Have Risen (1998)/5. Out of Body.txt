Darkened night, candles lit
It is the time for a new body
Astral flisht is in store
Meditate and try to focus
Let the weight disappear
Separate from the flesh
Levitate to a place
That is not this dimension

Out of body, astral rite
Nosferatu, beast of the night
Out of body, ecstasy
Vampiric blood within me
Human fools, come to me

Seeing through other eyes
Foreign form, but I am myself
Predator roaming free
Stalking prey, while being cloaked
Godlike in many ways
Feeding on those I want
Astral plane, my domain
"I' vampire, bow before me

Out of body, astral rite
Nosferatu, beast of the night
Out of body, ecstasy
Vampiric blood within me
Human fools, come to me

I sense my victim, my growing need
Attacking inside, I start to feed
Returning now, to my wordly state
Enjoying "the gift", my immortal fate

Out of body, astral rite
Nosferatu, beast of the night
Out of body, ecstasy
Vampiric blood within me
Human fools, come to me
