Symbol of the bloodline, mighty fanged skull with wings
Rune of Ur's elite, charged with the blood of kings
Mindless sub-creatures see it, and understand its power
Standard for the strong, while the inferiors cower

Tribute to the Annunaki Enki, descendants from the sky
Twin cobras that acknowledge dualism of two sides
Vampires know its meaning, proving their kind is real
The winged skull of Ur, the family's vampiric seal

Forever I will pledge my life to this sign
I who come from royal blood am truly divine
Master of the weak and a curse to the herds
Listen close children hear all of my words...

Gods made in our image, a mortal blasphemy
White light religions maintain human slavery
We the supreme race come before all
Those who oppose our brood will surly fall...

This is "The Blood", take drink, it is the essence of our being
Now look upon this immortal sigil and declare unity of all clans

"True vampirism is beyond what the Hollywood aestethics that flimmakers like to portray.
In reality, it is an ancient way of magick and manipulation that predates all known religions.
Yes, vampires do exist!
So sacrifice your lifeforce unto us as you listen to our musical conjuration.
You know you must!"
[The Rev. Vincent Crowley (Maylos) XXXII A.S.]
