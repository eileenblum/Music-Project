For thousand of years the undead gods have worked
To create their own world
Civilisation is a product of these ancient ones

Final harvest

The apocalypse draws near, spreading rage and fear
Soon the earth shall see the great family

Cities shall be swept up in the agony

The great undead gods shall return
To their thrones of power

The seventh seal is broken, as we see
The winged skull of Ur
