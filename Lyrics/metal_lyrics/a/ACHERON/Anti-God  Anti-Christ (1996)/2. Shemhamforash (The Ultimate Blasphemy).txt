[Intro #2]
Wherever there are walls I shall inscribe this eternal accusation against
Christianity upon them - I can write in letters which make even the blind
see... I call Christianity the one great curse, the one grear intrinsic
depravity, the one great instinct for revenge for which no expedient is
suffinciently poisonous, secret, subterranean, petty - I call it the one
immortal blemish of mankind...

Fuck God, for he is nothing to me
I spit on Jehovah and display mockery
The virgin Mary was a dirty whore
No blood of lamb shall be upon my door

I am godforsaken and I shall never change
My evil thoughts can't ever be rearranged
Lord of myself and a servant to one
I deny the holy ghost, the father and the son

No need for Alla, without Xul
Jesus Christ symbolizes a fool
Tetregrammaton, another form of deceit
And I renounce the crutch of the weak

I am godforsaken and I shall never change
My evil thoughts can't ever be rearranged
Lord of myself and a servant to one
I deny the holy ghost, the father and the son

Anephezeton, bow before me!

Where's this God? It's not there
A blind belief which is based in fear
Mindless herds can't perceive
Why I rejoice as they grieve
