[Intro #4]
God on the cross - is the fearful hidden meaning behind this symbol still
understood? - Everything that suffers, everything that hangs on the cross,
is divine... We all hang on the cross, consequently we are divine...
Christianity was a victory,a noble disposition perished by it - Christianity
has been up till now mankind's greatest misfortune

A January eve, the year XXX A.S.
Magick granted me a gift, that Lucifer blessed
A daughter born of darkness, and oh so divine
The next generation of the infernal bloodline

Devlyn Alexandra, the world is yours to indulge in the things you wish
Never submit to the righteous herds, my child may you "Do as thou wilt"

Skin white as snow, her eyes an endless sea
An unwarped newborn mind, without Christianity
Free to walk the path, remember left is right
Reap all of life's worth, young spawn of the night

Devlyn Alexandra, a new Satanic millenium awaits for you to behold
Use the tools given unto you, the creed being "Knowledge is power"

I baptize you in the name of Satan!

Hail Satan, rege Satanas, hail Devlyn, praise life
Hail Lucifer, ave Satanas, hail Devlyn, praise power
Hail Belial, rege Satanas, hail Devlyn, praise wisdom
Hail Leviathan, ave Satanas, hail Devlyn, praise strength

I lift the chalice and make a toast to this sacred time
Raise your hands into the sign of the horns, the Satanic Salute
Brothers and sisters we have honored this little witch
May the black flame of Satan forever burn in her veins
