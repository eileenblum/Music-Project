Hail Satan, full of might,
Our allegiance is with thee.
Cursed are they, the god adorers,
And cursed are the worshippers of the Nazarene.

Ave satanas, ave satanas

Unholy Satan, bringer of enlightment,
Lend us thy power, now and throughout our lives.
Endless glory shall be given.
Lord of hell, show us thy way.

Ave satanas, ave satanas

Jesus Christ, we deny thy name.
