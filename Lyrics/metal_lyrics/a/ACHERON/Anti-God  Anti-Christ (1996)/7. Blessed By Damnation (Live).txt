Infernal flames soothe my condemned soul, as torture becomes lust
Burning flesh becomes a painful pleasure in the bowels of the abyss

Blessed by damnation, blessed by damnation

Screams of anguish turn into bliss, while skin is being scorched
The fires blazing throughout this barren land brings forth enless ecstasy

Burn, I shall burn, as Hell consumes my soul
Burn, forever burn, darkness has full control

Boiling blood and disfigured bodies are found within this place
Before Satan, I have given all to become part of his creation

Blessed by damnation, blessed by damnation
