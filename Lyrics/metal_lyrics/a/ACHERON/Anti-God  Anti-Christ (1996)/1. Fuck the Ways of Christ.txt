[Intro #1]
One should not embellish or dress up Christianity: it has waged a war to the
death against this higher type of man, it has excomminucated all the
fundamental instincts of this type, it has distilled evil, the Evil One, out
of these instincts - the strong human beings as the type of
reprehensibility, as the 'outcast'. Christianity has taken the side of
everything weak, base, illconstituted, it has made an ideal out of
opposition to the preservation instincts of strong life; it has depraved the
reason even of the intellectually strongest natures by teaching men to feel
supreme values of intellectuality as sinful, as misleading, as temptations

2000 years ago has been enough, it's time to cast out Christian thought
The worship of a bastard is absurd, these ways must be fought
No more confessions or worthless prayers, guilt and failth we don't need
Rely upon thy self, not some idol god, self preservation is key

Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ

Adam and Eve were just a myth, evolution shows the proof
The meek shall never inherit the earth, Darwin, he wrote the truth
The words "Thou shalt" are for slaves not for those who rise above
Love thy neighbor" is a fuckin' joke for few are worthy of my love

Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ

Purification day has arrived, the Jesus freaks are revealing their ways
Soon the masses will wake up, that will be the Church's final days
Every empire that has stood strong has fallen in the past
Christianity is no exception, it's godly reign will never last

Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
Fuck the ways of Christ, fuck the ways of Christ
