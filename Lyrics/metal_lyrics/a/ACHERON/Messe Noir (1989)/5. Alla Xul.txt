A haunting feeling comes throughout a darkened room
The air turns thick at this ritual of doom
Candles start to flicker as the image now appears
Alla Xul's presence, the master of all fears

Enlightened by its sight, I now feel hypnotized
Within a realm of darkness, I see two glowing eyes
Bowing down before it to feel its might stare
Manifested power given by the necro-prayer

It speaks the ancient tongues
Embraced by power
Spawn of the abyss
Invoked this night
Sumerian evil god
Grants all desires
