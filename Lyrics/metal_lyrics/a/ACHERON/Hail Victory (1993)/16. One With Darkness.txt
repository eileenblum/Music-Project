Hear us, oh infernal master.
Grant that we may be of the chosen few.
Knowledge and power are yours to bestow.
Through you all will come to pass.

Renouncing paradise of the weak and the lowly,
We place our trust in thee,
God of flesh and deep desires.
Make us one with darkness.

Magick shall be our key, prayers said unto thee.
Unholy shall be our way, never shall we betray.
