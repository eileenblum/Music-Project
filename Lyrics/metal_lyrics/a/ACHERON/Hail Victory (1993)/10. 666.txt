Misguided ones open your minds
Leave the past behind
Take the powers from beyond
And accept the sacred bond
Feel a surge pierce your soul
Try and grasp what christ stole
Take the mark from Styx
The symbol is 666
Serve in heaven or rule in Hell
Which is better can you tell
Live in black, curse the light
Rebuke the sun, hail the night
