Misguided ones open your minds
Leave the past behind
Take the powers from beyond
And accept the sacred bond
Feel a surge pierse your soul
Try and grasp what christ stole
Recieve the mark from Styx
The symbol is 666
Serve in heaven or rule in Hell
Which is batter can you tell
Live in black, curse the night
Rebuke the night, nail the night
