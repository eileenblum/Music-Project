So you now wnat to make an agreement
Comein, sit down and listen to these words
Sell your soul to the dark unholy master
Deny Christ and let it be heard
Undress and put on this inverted cross
So that you can partake in our mass
Sip the chalice and taste the unholy water
Then we shall see how long you will last

Oh Lord Satan, we give to you, a new servant
Whose faith is through with God

Welcome to our secretive coven
You now commit your soul to the flame
Satan will now be your only master
So come and write your in blood your name
Can you obey the emperor of hades?
He will give you anything you ask
Contract in blood is here now and forever
A life of sin is your only task

Oh Lord Satan, we give to you, a new servant
Whose faith is through with God
