Awakened from their slumber, inside darkened minds
Are the deadly tendencies of a morbid kind
No pity or emotion, the inner beasts within
Horror of reality, its the awakening

Unleashed unto man, like a new disease
Only love and kindness is what will now cease
Denying what is good, as evil starts to rise
While in the heavens, Jesus now cries

Visions of chaos placed upon this world
No respect is given to life or birth
Only madness and death will flow into the soul
As the demons inside begin to take their toll
