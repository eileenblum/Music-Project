Draw the pentagram, pour the blood in the sand
For the master so grand, insanity takes command

Slaughterization for Satan, slaughterization for Satan

Decapitation we need, on Christ's blood we will feed
Evil and demented need, Satan will now succeed

Slaughterization for Satan, slaughterization for Satan
Slaughterization for Satan, slaughterization for Satan

Sacrifice tonight, you know it feels so right
To put a soul to flight, to kill this sacred night
Sacrifice tonight, you know it feels so right
To put a soul to flight, to kill this sacred night

Die Nazarene!

Second coming no more, the body lays on the floor
Opening Hell's door, demons rape the holy whore

Slaughterization for Satan, slaughterization for Satan
Slaughterization for Satan, slaughterization for Satan
