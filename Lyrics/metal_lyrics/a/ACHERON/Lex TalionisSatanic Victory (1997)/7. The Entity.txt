Can you feel it in the air? It's watching you now
Feel its touch and its stare and wondering how
The spell you have played with has opens Hell's gate
Now there's nothing you can do, demonic lust is your fate

Like the fire that does burn, now you face the entity
Its desire is to learn, now you face the entity
Now your body it will rape, you can't escape the entity
Demon seed, now in you, you can't escape the entity

Screams of pain in your room, it will beat you in this game
Cut and fuck you like a whore and you are to blame
Tears are running down your cheek, demented laughter in the air
Death is the only answer, do it if you dare

Like the fire that does burn, now you face the entity
Its desire is to learn, now you face the entity
Now your body it will rape, you can't escape the entity
Demon seed, now in you, you can't escape the entity

The entity
