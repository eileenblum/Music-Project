In my mind, demons call to me
Telling me I belong to them

Voices within won't leave me be
Horrid visions they make me see
Voices within bringing my madness
Feeling only pain and sadness

Evil cries haunt my very soul
Making me part of the infernal brood

Voices within won't leave me be
Horrid visions they make me see
Voices within bringing my madness
Feeling only pain and sadness

Beings from Hell, in me they dwell
