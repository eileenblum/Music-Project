Homage now has been made to the Lord of fire
Whorship of the chosen one not the christ the liar
Baptised in the flames of Hell to recieve the seal
Unholy blessings are recieved from the sacred rites
Soldiers unto Lucofer perform their evil pleights
Rejecting Heaven's lies to accept the truth
God's blood being spilled for immortal truth
God is dead
