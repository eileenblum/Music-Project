Come forth children of sin and blasphemy
World domination is what Christians will see
The legions of hatred are taking command
And all those who oppose will die by our hand

Satan's elite are taking what's theirs
666, a mark we all bare
Black magick is used for our needs
While on the cross the useless one bleeds

Legions of hatred, legions of hatred
Legions of hatred, legions of hatred

Churches will burn all over the earth
For this is the dawn of Satanic rebirth
A planet that once adored God's name
Now is ablazed by rioter's flames
