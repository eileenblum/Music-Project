Even in their holy books they knew there'd be a day
For an apocalypse to wash their gods away
Predestined savagery and sacrilegious bliss
The serpent regains his garden hear his deadly hiss

Godless? We are gods!

Synagogues are burning, churches engulfed in flames
Crosses pointing south, these lands we will reclaim
No more refuge in the bosom of their lord
Neutralize sceptics who doubt our blessed hordes

Godless? We are gods!

Science kills religion it's grimoire is technology
Seceded from the cults of worthless deities
Symbolic metaphors are used in replace
Gazing in the mirror, we see our true god's face

Godless? We are gods!
