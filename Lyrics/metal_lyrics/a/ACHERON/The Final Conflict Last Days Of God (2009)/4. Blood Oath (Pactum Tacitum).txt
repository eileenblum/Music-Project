I vow to pledge allegiance to the standarts of the strong
Put my life upon the line, to Der Wolfen I belong
Strength, force, intelligence are the things that I command
Partisan to the darkside declaring to make a stand

Blood oath, my oath for life, blood oath, my oath
Blood oath, my oath for life, blood oath, my oath

I swear to uphold everything that promotes gain
Deny Sheepish folklore that caters to inner pain
Born again in the flames, leaving the past behind
Loyal to the howling pack, true salvation I shall find

Blood oath, my oath for life, blood oath, my oath
Blood oath, my oath for life, blood oath, my oath

Until death I will challenge all who dare to confront us
Never to be submissive, dominating those who are fallacious
Lycanthropic cult of terror, I ask you to welcome me
In my blood I sign this pact, for the fucking world to see
