Fuck their laws and morals
They don't represent me
For I'm an abomination
Praise hate and blasphemy

Don't need their holy ranting
Don't want to lovely lies
Salvation through hatred
Reveals a life disguised

Living for myself
And those within my clan
Never backing down
Following my plan

Don't need their holy ranting
Don't want to lovely lies
Salvation through hatred
Reveals a life disguised

There will be blood! My life starts anew
There will be blood! Nothing they can do
There will be blood! Anger fuels my fire
There will be blood! Hate is my desire

There will be blood! My life starts anew
There will be blood! Nothing they can do
There will be blood! Anger fuels my fire
There will be blood! Hate is my desire
