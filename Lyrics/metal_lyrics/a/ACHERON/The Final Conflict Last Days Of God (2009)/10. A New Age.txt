Welcome to the new world order
Made up the dark elite minds
Rebellion wiped out the bastards in charge
No sympathy for genetic slime

A new age is here, behold it
A new age is here, embrace it

Malevolence spawning a new species
Mankind will never be the same
Death plagued the bleeding heart worms
Power destroyed all human waste

A new age is here, behold it
A new age is here, embrace it

Behold, these were
The last days of God!

Freedom came to those who fought
Never surrender, cower or quit
Rejoicing in victory's mighty glory
Witness the day of purification

A new age is here, behold it
A new age is here, embrace it
