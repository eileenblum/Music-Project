Smoke clears the air
Heathen flag waves high
Our regime is in power
Pentagram with an eye

Millennium's end, that's where we'll begin
Millennium's end, renewal again

Resurrected sun wheel
Symbol known to all
Our blood and our honor
Has answered hell's call

Millennium's end, that's where we'll begin
Millennium's end, renewal again

So many years, we have longed for this day
Occultic soldiers and leading the way

Hail the new order, hail the new order

Soil soaked in blood feeds mother earth's needs
Birth comes from death planting our demon seeds

Hail the new order, hail the new order
