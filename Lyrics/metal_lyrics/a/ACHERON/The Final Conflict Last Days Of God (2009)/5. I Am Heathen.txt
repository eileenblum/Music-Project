I reject the gods you adore
Freedom from religious lore
At ease with my sins
Anti-god, my life begins

I am heathen

Why must you all look to the sky for all your answers?
Find out what you are all looking for within thy self

A life rejoicing in pleasure and sin, can be obtained
Apostasy of religions and faith, art of the heathen

Heretic, not a neophyte
Blaspheming all holy rites
A wolf among the sheep
My pride, I shall keep

I am heathen

Why must you all look to the sky for all your answers?
Find out what you are all looking for within thy self

A life rejoicing in pleasure and sin, can be obtained
Apostasy of religions and faith, art of the heathen

Fuck their lies!
