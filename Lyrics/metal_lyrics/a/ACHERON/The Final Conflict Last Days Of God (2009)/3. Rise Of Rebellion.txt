Religion and weakness has ruined this world
Mass breeding humans to follow the herd
Muhammad, Christ, Buddha we must expurgate
Redeem this planet before it's too late
Bring back the laws that excel the elite
Refurbish values that frown on defeat
Chaos is needed to purify life
Struggle and work will triumph our strife

We told them their faults, informed them to change
They didn't listen, so we'll take the reins
Detesting their moral, abhorrence for lies
A new order rises, as the old one now dies
The past has been ignominious to most
Horrid ideals that white lighters host
It's time for war let warriors take part
Terroristic actions is how it will start
In our enemies brains we'll instill fear
Hail hatred's anger, fuck cowardly tears
Let iron will bring forth victory
Destroy false ideals, profane blasphemy
Violence, power, pleasure and might
Freedom commands all humans to fight
Right or left path, you can not choice both
Children of darkness, fulfill your blood oath
