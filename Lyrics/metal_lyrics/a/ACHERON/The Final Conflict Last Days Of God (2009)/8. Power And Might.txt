Courage and brawn forges foreordained conquest
Masters always conquer the slaves
Weak creatures doomed to face capitulation
Lex Talionis governs the brave

Power and might

Push aside the slugs within our species
Eugenics will soon find a place
Zero tolerance for unproductive vermin
Cleansing the entire race

Power and might

In our world, the few only matter
Everyone must pull their own weight
Racism is not true misanthropy
For niggers come in all colors!

Crushing inferiors that stand in our way
Trample pests into the ground
No mercy for our enemies or foes
Preponderance we have found

Power and might
