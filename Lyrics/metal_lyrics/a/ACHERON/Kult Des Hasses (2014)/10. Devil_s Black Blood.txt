A BLACKENED ELIXIR THAT WE KNOW SO WELL
BOTTLED DAMNATION THAT COMES STRAIGHT FROM HELL

DEVIL'S BLACK BLOOD - RAISE UP YOUR GLASS
DISCIPLES OF DARKNESS - SALUTE OUR MASS
DEVIL'S BLACK BLOOD - NOW TAKE A DRINK
SATANIC METAL - IS OUR COMMON LINK

HAIL YOUR COMRADES WITHIN THIS ROOM
I MAKE THIS TOAST UNTO YOU ALL
WE ARE THE FAMILY, NEVER TO FALL
