I AM THE RAZORBLADE THAT CUTS YOUR OUTREACHED WRISTS
THE OVERDOSE OF DRUGS, AN ESCAPE YOU CAN'T RESIST
A ROPE WAITING TO CHOKE AWAY YOUR LIFE
SALVATION COMING FROM YOUR THROAT SLIT BY A KNIFE

YOU'RE MINE IN WEAKNESS
YOU'RE MINE IN SHAME
YOU'RE MINE IN SADNESS
YOU'RE MINE, COME TAKE MY HAND

I AM THE LOADED GUN PRESSED AGAINST YOUR HEAD
INGESTED POISON LEAVES YOUR HELPLESS BODY DEAD

ASPHYXIATING BAG THAT HALTS A  FINAL SCREAM
OH YES. THIS IS FOR REAL. NOT SOME FUCKING DREAM

YOU'RE MINE IN WEAKNESS
YOU'RE MINE IN SHAME
YOU'RE MINE IN SADNESS
YOU'RE MINE. COME TAKE MY HAND

JUST BE PREPARED MY CHILD FOR THERE'S NO TURNING BACK
ONCE THE CHOICE IS MADE LIFE WILL FADE TO BLACK
MANY DIFFERENT WAYS FOR OUR PATHS TO COLLIDE
CALL ME THE REAPER DEATH OR THY FATHER SUICIDE

YOU'RE MINE IN WEAKNESS
YOU'RE MINE IN SHAME
YOU'RE MINE IN SADNESS
YOU'RE MINEâ¦
