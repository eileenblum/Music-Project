OH I HEAR THE HOLY BLASPHEMIES 
THEY ARE CALLING FROM INSIDE OF ME 
VISIONS THAT MY MIND DOES CRAVE 
VIOLATING CHRIST
TORTURE THAT SEEMS TO BE SO REAL 
TRUE PAIN THAT BASTARD MUST NOW FEEL
VARIOUS ACTS OF HATE ARE PLAYING 
WITHIN MY BRAIN

JESUS WEPT, SUFFERS IN PAIN
THIS DREAM-LIKE PLEASURE I MUST SUSTAIN
JESUS WEPT, NO MERCY SHOWN
WELCOME TO MY MIND

ONCE AGAIN TO BE CRUCIFIED
THROUGH MY WILL HE SHALL ABIDE
I'M THE MASTER AND THE MAKER
OF THIS MENTAL BLISS
PSYCHOTIC THOUGHTS, SICK FANTASY
HIS BLOOD SPLIT BRINGS ECSTASY
NO SALVATION FROM MY MORBID 
VISIONS OF DELIGHT

A SCOURGE TEARING FLESH OFF HIS BONES 
IN ANGUISH HE CRAWLS THEN HE  MOANS. 
AS WE MOCK HIS HOLY TITLE 
"THE SON OF GOD"
THROWING STONES AT THIS KING OF KINGS  
AGONY IS WHAT HIS FATE BRINGS. 
NAILING HIM TO THE CROSS AGAIN
UNLEASHING HELL

JESUS WEPT, SUFFERS IN PAIN
THIS DREAM-LIKE PLEASURE I MUST SUSTAIN
JESUS WEPT, NO MERCY SHOWN
WELCOME TO MY MIND

CROWN OF SPIKES DRIVEN IN HIS HEAD
WISHING THAT HE WERE DEAD
EYE LIDS REMOVED TO WITNESS 
ALL THAT I CREATE
SHARP HOOKS RIP AND PULL HIS SKIN
SALT IN WOUNDS, INSERTED PINS
NO SALVATION FROM MY MORBID
VISIONS OF DELIGHT

NOW I LAY ME DOWN TO SLEEP
I DREAM YOUR LORD'S PAIN I'LL KEEP
AND IF I DIE BEFORE I WAKE
MAY HE ROT FOR HEAVEN'S SAKE!
