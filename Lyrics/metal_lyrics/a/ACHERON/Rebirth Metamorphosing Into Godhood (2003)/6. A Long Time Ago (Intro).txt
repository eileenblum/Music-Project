Aeons ago, a lie was born unto the herds of man
A story of a merciful hero, labeled as our savior
Declared the Son of God, heir of Heaven's throne
Sacrificing his own life to die for mortal sins

Their deceit couldn't win. A beholder of truth appeared
He left his testimony for all the world to see
But the cult of the Nazarene hid his sacred scrolls
Now a modern day Seer reveals what really happened
