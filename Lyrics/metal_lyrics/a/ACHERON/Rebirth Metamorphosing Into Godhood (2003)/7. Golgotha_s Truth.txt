I saw the Bastard condemned to crucifixion.
Tears of Failure stained his blistered face.
Chants and laughter, mocking this Jesus Christ.
Upon the Cross this "king" was exposed.

Crown of Thorns, Digging deep within his head
Sign of Shame, INRI hanging above
Screaming out in pain, "Why, Father, Why?"
Long spikes driven into his wrists and feet

His disciples looked on, while he suffered.
To weak to do anything for him.
The Romans showed their dominating power.
Letting Christ die with common thieves.

Crown of thorns, Digging deep within his head
Sign of Shame, INRI hanging above
Screaming in pain, "Why, Father, Why?"
Long spikes driven into his wrists and feet

Lies....Lies....What they have given you
Lies....Lies....Now hear the truth

Death had come, his body hung lifeless.
Ripped his corpse off that ragged cross
Mourners wept, as they took away his carcass.
Taking him to a secretive place.

I witnessed the tomb and the stone that never moved
The resurrection hadn't even taken place
All made up, by the drones that followed him
Not a God or a King, just a man...
