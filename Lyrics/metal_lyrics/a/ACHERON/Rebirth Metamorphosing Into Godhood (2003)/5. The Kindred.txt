Under the moonlight, Unholy terror walks
They are the creatures of the night
A secret cult of bloodlust and death
Kindred of the Pentagram

They are the nightmares within your dreams
A force you can not comprehend
Self preservation is their highest law
The taste of blood brings them power

Bonded by the Blood of Humans
Which gives them the gift of life
Vampires or ghoulish demons?
The Kindred shall always survive

Born of Fire, The Kindred
Sanguinary Desire, The Kindred

[Spoken:]
Blood, the Blood, is their nocturnal need
Blood, Sweet Blood, on it they will feed

Bonded by the Blood of Humans
Which gives them the gift of life
Vampires or ghoulish demons?
The Kindred shall always survive

No, there's no place to run, there's no place to hide,
Your god has forsaken you
The Devil's Children await, accept now your fate,
Accept that your life is through
