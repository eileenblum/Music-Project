Life has showed me the way, I need no Priest or some temple to pray
Wholeness, comes from within, I bend knees not, I rejoice in my sin

Church of One, Church of One

Satan is a part of me, I am the Devil you have to believe
Aligned with only myself, Solitude has become my true wealth

Church of One, Church of One

Hail Satan! Hail Thy Self!
Praise the Power! The Power Within!

My Unholy Dark Half, makes me complete
I shall never bow, before their Almighty's feet

Banish the thoughts of the lamb. Covenant of the wolf and the ram
Hermit or a madman? If I am wrong, I will surely be damned

Church of One, Church of One
