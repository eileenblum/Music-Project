[Music by Ahmed Zine, Lyrics by Yousra Atmen]

Claiming the highest mountains
Trying to hide from reality
Running for yourself

Between the passion and the misery
Lost, when you aim to be free

This dream is your poetic misery
From you to the sea
And you can't run away
The destiny

This time is yours, leave it to be free
Leave it then leave your agony
And come to me

The distance between us
Grown up, anytime you try to see
The truth inside of me but
You never tried to see
