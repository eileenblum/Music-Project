[Music by Ahmed Zine, Lyrics by Rida Bahja]

Death takes me to another place
The place where we will live forever
A wonderful life together

My soul turns into a bird
Singing bird on a Tree
In a heavenly kingdom

Love will have no meaning
If my life after death's without you
I couldn't believe what I knew
I don't know why I still love you

All my days will be in paradise
The place where I am living without you
A wonderful life forever

Death took me to another place
The place where weâd promised to live
A wonderful life together

Love will have a meaning
If my life after death's with you
Now I believe itâs true
And I know why I love you
