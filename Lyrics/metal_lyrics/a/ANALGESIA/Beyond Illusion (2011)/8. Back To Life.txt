[Music &amp; Lyrics by Ahmed Zine]

I believe that the wonderful events are,
Unseen thatâs why youâd always close the eyes,
When you kiss, when you dream &amp; when you cry.
My dearâ¦

I hear the bells calling the angels,
I feel the cold sound of freedom.
My way has been a wonderful day with you.
My dearâ¦
