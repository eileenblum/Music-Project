[Music &amp; Lyrics by Ahmed Zine]

Darkness, murkiness, gloominess, weakness,
Unhappiness, dimness, frailness, dullness,
Disorder, disaster, surrender, downfall

This is what you can bring
To my little home
To my little nation
To my heart and my bravery

Confusion, exhaustion, destruction, abdication,
Conspiration, obsession, affliction, depression,
Torment, violence, sorrow, nightfall,

This is what you can bring
To my little home
To my little nation
To my heart and my bravery

You have no world, invaded many nations
You took my sons, you broke all my dreams
You chained my hands, you swiped many stations
This is my land; you have no right to stay

When we like, we don't share
And we love our little Home
Only kings and fools who do
What they always want to do
This is my little world
You have no right to stay
We defend our great land
Revolution has begun

Freedom is shining from the smile of the innocent child
No more Destitution, calamity, Obscurity

Revolution has begun!!
