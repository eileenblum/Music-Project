Still canât deem you are gone
But you have never known
When youâre hidden behind the clouds
The sky crashes down with tears

And you plead me not to cry?
What should I believe?
Your heart? Your shining eyes?
Or simply your fears?

Tell me
What should I believe?
The stars you have never been?
Or the promise Iâd never seen?

To go away, never give a sign to you
No, so close I will remain, and always preserve you

Fare thee well, I wonât see you anymore
No, I canât bare it
Iâm running to you, even more

And you plead me not to cry?
What should I believe?
Your heart? Your shining eyes?
Your obsessing ghost?

Yet I know, youâll meet me again
You will hold me, tell me you love me
Youâll take me along, to your secret garden
And you will have to go away
