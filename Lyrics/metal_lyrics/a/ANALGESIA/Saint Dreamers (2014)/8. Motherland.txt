My dearest one,
In a nutshell, I dare to write with heaviness in my heart, shudder in my soul, few lines, I, myself oft wanted to tell yore, the way I have you in my thoughts, since weâve been apart and did not happen to see.
My melancholy I used, to drink in a cup of yours, tastes still in my lonely me, with you no more in. Henceforward, Iâd stand still.
Lastly, do I avow, mine eyes desire you above all. And heretofore long for a journey with your boundaries, your two seas, Sahara, Atlas and Rifs.
I and mine heart put our faith in God, May he protect, honor, bless you even and more and even more than ever.
Your son, who more than loved you, Motherland.
