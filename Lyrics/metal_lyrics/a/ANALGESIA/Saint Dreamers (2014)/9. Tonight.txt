I had two heavy blankets on me and still I tremble
Tried to close my eyes, then I saw a light
Embracing your innocence
You see how my faith completely crumbled
But now, in my mind there is only you

All my troubles
Theyâre gone forever
Happiness will fill this empty night
You call the freedom in my heart
To triumph and to chase the tears

Tonight, you are here
You give me your hand
Tonight, you were here
You gave me your hand

Then I woke up from this dream
If only I took your hand
