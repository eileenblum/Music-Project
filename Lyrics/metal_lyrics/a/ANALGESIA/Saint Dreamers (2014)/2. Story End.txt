O song of remembrance, full of hope
Thy memories, utterly past

In this joy, I dare to tell my sentiments to thee
The shadow of this bitter dream, which came to shine on
Alas! In my eyes it became a broken diamond
Its sweet warm singing voice was feint

In pride, remorse, martyrdom
My oath I gave to thee
Hidden in faded spaces, whispers softly
Taking so far away, to the grace
Beneath this rhapsody, of a dove
Delightful memory, calling thy frail love

Sailing in this starless night
And warm light of the moon
Revealing the rapture of thy story
