Soul, enlighten our shrewd men
Where is this faceless ghost evermore?
Curse ran on such a strange omen
Where it strength is drawing clouds?

Beware, it crashed into the clouds
Child, crying in freezing veil
Remember, crashed into the clouds
Child, playing the holy game

On a rage of tears for fading away
Where is this faceless ghost evermore?
Beauty vanished for to lose
Where the feather is the dreaming lord

Freezing veil in my mind

In a wisdom, thriving rebirth
Never know how, when and where
He will deliver me, the ghost
