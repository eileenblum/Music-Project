As the convict in me remains
Withered my last flower dismissed
Its worm smell is calling for forsaken decades
Tracing the fate, within the mist

Still in my mind, since the soul revealed
Still in my heart, since the love removed
Still in me, since me with thee, since eternity

As the sad spirit, left me so far
Who wept thee for so long?
Cradle dreaming in my lonely star
Caressing the dwell, through my song

With weakness in my veins
Running after a celestial muse
Searching pure suspicion in vain
Drowning in a shabby accuse
