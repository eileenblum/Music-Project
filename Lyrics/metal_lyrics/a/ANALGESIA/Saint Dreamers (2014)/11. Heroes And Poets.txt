Heroes fell
Masks are down
Open the stage
Turn off the light
Some graceful colors
Magical distraction
Overdosed lights
Let the show go on

I am a ring where a dreamer fights a leader
Each one of us has a broken child inside
When my faith will veil the fear stopping me
The dreamer in me will shine again

Poets down
Clowns come back
Pencils are ready
New books in mind
Refreshing this age
Scamming the masses
Stories remade
The show is better now

I am a ring where a dreamer fights a leader
Each one of us has a blissful soul inside
When your dreams will veil the fear stopping you
The hero in you will shine again

Oh please, lie to me
Oh please, veil the truth
Oh please, keep the shows going
Oh please, keep us dreaming

We are none-wake up generation
We are free in deep isolation
We are masters in adaptation
We are not puppets in salvation

The fallen beautyâs still in my mind
Deliver me from this wellhorld
Then tell me this is a story end
Tonight, we are saint dreamers
