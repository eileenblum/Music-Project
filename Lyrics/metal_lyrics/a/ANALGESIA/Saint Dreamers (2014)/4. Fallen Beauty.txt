Fallen from the sky above
Heaven where I am living
Spread my wings, fly like a dove
Blessed day that I am giving

Behind the mountains
There is a song I am singing
Here again, waiting all along

Dream, walk, fall, I will always laugh
Live, sing, feel, I find the greatest love

Forgotten innocence I had once
Now, itâs hidden under the morning stars
And when the day comes
Open wide your eyes
