Any smart man would change things with a foolish touch
Make things greater, more complex and more violent
But, it takes a genius touch and lot of courage
To change something against the grain

They live according to envies and desires
Until there comes a time where suddenly
They will have to deal with the mother era
To change something against the grain

Plastic surgery
Intellectual misery
Forsaken century
You are the welcome to the Wellhorld

The Armageddon I feel in my heart
The chaos shadow Iâm looking to
The foolish minds Iâm speaking to
The dark souls Iâm dealing with
Too many heroes for a single aim
Too many roses on a ghost grave
Too much blood
Too much lies
Too much pain

Fake generation, nobody beholds your real home
Fake generation, nobody knows where you are coming from
Fake generation, you are a dead point in a long cycle
Fake generation, think pink generation
