The circle is complete
The serpent bites its tail
Fluid images of infinity
Unknown words without a sound
My eyes,they seem to see
Their chests bleeding, their screams
Fragments of eternity
Once the lie, twice the alibi

Magnetization, neverending vortex
Back to the source of our disease
Whirlpool of colours, blood stained blankets
I'm just the painter of their agonies
Inside the chaos harmony
I'll learn the hidden secrets
Mine is the task to initiate
'cause I'm the chosen one
The only one

Like a photogram
A sharp image
I'm gonna show you
The step beyond this world
The no return
They all get rid of me
But I'm I the insane?
I'm the one who knows
The Everlasting one

Guilty for a crime undone
I've been left alone
Begging for the truth
Buried deep inside in all of us
Oh, please,remember my name
And don't forget my words
Oh no, please no!
I shall dance with knowledge, my bride
We'll die in our embrace
Our last embrace

Now I can close my eyes
Now I can close my eyes to die
And see what I've never seen
And see what I'll never see, never!
