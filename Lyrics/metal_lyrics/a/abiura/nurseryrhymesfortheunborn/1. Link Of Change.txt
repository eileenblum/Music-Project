The sound of flowing waters 
will wash away my impure thougths 
Paintings of saints are burning
A thousand times I join my hands

Evil forces outside
The holy prophecy
But I've broken all my promises
I've found the inner me 
Process of annihilation
Another human being
reborn in the regression
for a newer purity

Burning will of skin
Crawling ecstacy
Libido possession
Sane morbidity
Flesh to satisfy my hunger 
Eager for sin

So I deny the rules 
I forget all your prayers 
I've worshipped all the things that today I reject 
Following my own path
Raising my soul and feeding my anger 

No more!
Grain of sand
No more!
Link of the chain
