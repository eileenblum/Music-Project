Baby you know I ain't lettin' you go 
So whatever you say I'm gonna make you stay 
Baby is it true, did you find someone new 
I couldn't take it anymore if you'd walk out that door 

Well I ain't got nothing to say to you 
And I don't know what I should do 
But our love keeps slippin' away 
I'm a-losin' you 
Well I ain't got nothing to give to you 
And I taught you all that I knew 
But our love keeps slippin' away 
I'm a-losin' you 

Baby it's hard I'm falling apart 
Don't you leave me behind I'm a-losin' my mind 

Well I ain't got nothing to say to you 
And I don't know what I should do 
But our love keeps slippin' away 
I'm a-losin' you 
Well I ain't got nothing to give to you 
And I taught you all that I knew 
But our love keeps slippin' away 
I'm a-losin' you 

I'd give all that I own, just to get you alone 
Just a moment with you, if that could be true 
But you push me away, you wanna call it a day 
And that feeling inside, I could never hide 

Well I ain't got nothing to say to you 
And I don't know what I should do 
But our love keeps slippin' away 
I'm a-losin' you 
Well I ain't got nothing to give to you 
And I taught you all that I knew 
But our love keeps slippin' away 
I'm a-losin' you
