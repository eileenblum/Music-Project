Look in the mirror 
And tell me what you see 
A pretty face but tears in your eyes 
You keep on dreaming 
And let your mind go free 
Out in the night, you wander the skies; come on! 

Bring on the dancers 
Let's have a night on the town 
Night-time romancers 
We're gonna have a night on the town 

Your heart is pounding 
The clock is much too slow 
All fired up and ready to go 
Your luck is changing 
It's finally coming true 
You've got it all, they're waiting for you; come on! 

Bring on the dancers 
Let's have a night on the town 
Night-time romancers 
We're gonna have a night on the town 

Out in the dance floor 
The music takes control 
Close your eyes and let yourself go 
Your blood is rushing 
Into your heart and soul 
Free yourself, don't ever say no, no! 

Bring on the dancers 
Let's have a night on the town 
Night-time romancers 
We're gonna have a night on the town
