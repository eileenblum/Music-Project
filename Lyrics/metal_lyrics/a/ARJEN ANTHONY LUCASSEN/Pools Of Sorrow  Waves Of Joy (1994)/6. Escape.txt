I hear a voice from the past 
And my heart is beating fast 
And everything around me fades away 
I still can't believe it's true 
Tell me why did it have to be you 
Imagine you were here with us today 

Yes I know, you were a dreamer 
But your dreams have taken shape 
And when it's all too much I escape 
I escape now babe, let me escape 

I heard the news, it couldn't be worse 
And all across the universe 
People came together over you 
We're gonna have to carry that weight 
The way you met your terrible fate 
That day in the life when the bullets flew 

Yes I know, you were a dreamer 
But your dreams have taken shape 
And when it's all too much I escape 
I escape now babe, let me escape 

All you were saying 
Was give peace a chance 
And when you were playing 
You made everybody dance 
You want a revolution? 
Well all you need is love 
And all I wanna do is listen to you 
That's how I escape 

Late at night, begin December 
Came a shock we will all remember 
It must have been about thirteen years ago 
You shine on Ã¹ike a star 
You move the hands on my guitar 
And while it gently weeps, the tears will flow 

Yes I know, you were a dreamer 
But your dreams have taken shape 
And when it's all too much I escape 
I escape now babe, let me escape
