On that day at the break of dawn 
Her mother died when she was born 
Her father has blamed her, it was really sad 
He found a new woman, they had a little boy 
He got all the affection that she never had no no no 

Little miss understood 
She ain't no beauty but she looks quite good 
Underneath that pink disguise 
Little miss understood 
She's the shame of the neighbourhood 
If they would only realize 

In front of all the kids at school 
She knew she had to play it cool 
To get the attention she was craving for 
She wore a real tight dress 
And with an air as if she couldn't care less 
She was walking the streets like never before
Oh no no no no 

Little miss understood 
She ain't no beauty but she looks quite good 
Underneath that pink disguise 
Little miss understood 
She's the shame of the neighbourhood 
If they would only realize 

If they would only realize! 

She left home still under-age 
And got caught in a golden cage 
He said he'd take care of her 
Well in a way he did 
Ah he really thought that his love was true 
And so she did what he told her to do 
It was love for money , and money for love no no no 

Little miss understood 
She didn't behave like a little girl should 
She's living her life like it's a game 
Little miss understood 
She'd like to change if she only could 
But she will always be the same 

Little miss understood 
She ain't no beauty but she looks quite good 
Underneath that pink disguise 
Little miss understood 
She's the shame of the neighbourhood 
If they would only realize

If they would only realize!
