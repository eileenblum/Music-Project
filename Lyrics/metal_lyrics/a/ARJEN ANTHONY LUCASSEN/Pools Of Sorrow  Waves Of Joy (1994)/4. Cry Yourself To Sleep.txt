You had all you wanted 
At least that's what they told you 
But all you ever wanted 
Was someone to care for you 
And so they left you 
And sent you away 
To a place so far from home 
Where all the children like to play 
So why? Did you cry yourself to sleep? 

Nobody loved you 
At least that's how you felt it 
You tried so hard to make the others 
Notice you were there 
Unlike a lady 
You make them look your way 
And all the boys were chasing you 
They liked the "games" you played 
But still you cried yourself to sleep 

But now it's over 
At least that's how I planned it 
And if I had my way 
I'd turn those nightmares into dreams 
Can you hear the wind blow? 
I can hear it all 
If you listen very hard 
There'll be an answer to your call 
I'm right here don't cry yourself to sleep 
Oh no, you don't have to 
No you don't have to cry yourself to sleep
