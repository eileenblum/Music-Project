My daddy was a gambler 
He gambled with his life 
He didn't give a damn about his wife 
So she left him in the night time 
While hiding from the rain 
I was born on the midnight train 

Grew up a desperado 
Grew hair on my chest 
They said I was the terror of the west 
Well I didn't have no money 
And I didn't have no brain 
So I robbed the midnight train 

Well the sheriff formed a posse, Apaches on my trail 
He said "hey dude, I'll throw you in my jail"
Now I'm sitting here tired 
To ball and chain 
I've been caught on the midnight train 

They made me work the railroad 
For 16 hours a day 
I knew I just had to get away 
(Now) how I pulled it off 
I still can't explain 
But I escaped the midnight train 

Now if you would have been there 
Aboard the midnight train 
He was rumoured to have died or gone insane 
Then somebody be smiling 
No one knew his name 
But he was born on the midnight train
