I still remember that song 
All the words we knew 
When it started we would 
Sing the whole night through 

We shared a place together 
And our records too 
Crazy characters 
That's me and you 

Let me tell you! 
I had so much fun 
But the teenage days are gone 
But the feeling never ends 
And we'll remain the best of friends! 

No, you didn't care 
How your looks could be 
It made the people turn their 
Heads around to see 

When the evening came 
So did the magic sound 
Let the neighbours know 
"Jean Jeanie" is around! 

Let me tell you! 
I had so much fun 
But the teenage days are gone 
But the feeling never ends 
And we'll remain the best of friends! 

Life has a way of changing 
And so did you 
So respectable 
Who could believe it's true? 

Hey, it doesn't matter 
What the others think 
Next time "the boys are back in town"
We'll have a drink 

Let me tell you! 
I had so much fun 
But the teenage days are gone 
But the feeling never ends 
And we'll remain the best of friends! 

The teenage days are gone 
But the feeling never ends 
And we'll remain the best of friends
