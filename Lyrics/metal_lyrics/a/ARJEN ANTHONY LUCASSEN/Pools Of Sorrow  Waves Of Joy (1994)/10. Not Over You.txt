The earth moved, the water ran free 
Then lightning struck 
We both knew it was meant to be 
So we tried our luck 

There was so much love, there was so much pain 
In those stormy years 
If I could just go back and do it all again 
I'd take away your fears 

Oh do you feel the way I do?
When the stars come out at night 
There's always you 
Oh do you feel the same pain too? 
Now the scars have almost healed 
I know it's true 
I'm not over you 

Now you've gone and left a space 
That's so hard to fill 
I hope for you, you have found your place 
And I guess I will 

There's so many doubts going through my mind 
Is this the way that it should be? 
People say that love is blind 
Well I cannot see

Oh do you feel the way I do?
When the stars come out at night 
There's always you 
Oh do you feel the same pain too? 
Now the scars have almost healed 
I know it's true 
I'm not over you
