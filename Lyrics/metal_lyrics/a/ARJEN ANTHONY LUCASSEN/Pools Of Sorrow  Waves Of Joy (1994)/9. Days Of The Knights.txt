Tears fall from the jester's eyes 
No sound as the old man dies 
Gather round on scared ground 
The king has gone 

Trumpets sound from the castle walls 
There's no sun, a hard rain falls 
Men where killed and blood was spilled 
In the days of the knights 

Hot steel; burning oil 
Brave men defended their soil 
Children cried while fathers died 
The law of the land 

Rejoice now the battle is won 
All rise for the king his son 
Times were rough but the men were tough 
In the days of knights 

She's charmed by a magic smell 
In a place where the spirits dwell 
The knight will ride and the stars will guide 
To the princess bride 

On his quest for the demon land 
The wizards dies by the hero's hand 
Evil rules in the eyes of the fools 
In the days of the knights
