Hey you country girl 
You look so hot you'd make a straight hair curl 
You've got everything it takes, oh no 
To make my skin crawl, a tear-drop fall 
Whatever I want she's got it all 
I can't help it I'm in love love love! 
With a country girl 
I'm a city boy 

You don't seem to be impressed 
Could it be the way I'm dressed 
It doesn't matter much to me, oh no 
So if you want I'll just deny my roots 
Ride a horse and wear cowboy-boots 
I'll do anything for love love love 
And a country girl 

Could it be you don't want me baby 
You don't care at all? 
The way you push them cows around 
It drives me up the wall 
I even thought about movin' 
To Memphis Tennessee 
Tell me are you lonesome babe 
Don't be cruel to me! 
My country girl 
I'm a city boy 

And after all I must admit 
You looked okay, but you smelled like shit! 
I won't have anything to do with you 
So now I'll never watch 
John Wayne again 
Throw my Dylan's in the garbage-can 
Don't you ever fall in love love love 

Could it be you don't want me baby 
You don't care at all? 
The way you push them cows around 
It drives me up the wall 
I even thought about movin' 
To Memphis Tennessee 
Tell me are you lonesome babe 
Don't be cruel to me! 
My country girl 
I'm a city boy
