Nobody knew the future was ours to hold 
Seer of visions, or teller of lies? 
What could he do when destiny was foretold 
You could see the anguish in his eyes 
Get down crescendo! 

Haunted by fear and dreaming of things to come 
A computer-age, and nuclear wars 
Shadows appear but where are they comin' from? 
And he can't make them go away 
Get down crescendo! 

Nobody cared they treated him like a fool 
Whenever he spoke, people turned away 
Then they got scared what if it would be true? 
The bringer of evil had to die 
Get down crescendo! 

He knew it was time he stood on the brink of fame 
His powers were growing, his message would be shared 
Killed in his prime nobody knew his name 
His life, a crescendo that never peaked 
He will always be known as 

Poor crescendo capture the rainbow 
Embrace the colours, and gather the sunbeams 
Poor crescendo let your tears flow 
Come sail away, on an ocean of dreams
