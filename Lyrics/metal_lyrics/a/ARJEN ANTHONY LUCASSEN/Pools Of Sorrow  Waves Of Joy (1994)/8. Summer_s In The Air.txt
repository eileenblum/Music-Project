Life is slow, but love is fast 
Live without a care 
Take your time and make it last 
There's magic everywhere 
Summer's in the air 

The nights are cool in St. Tropez 
And like a millionaire 
Get outta bed and face the day 
In an easy chair 
Summer's in the air 

People dine on wine and cheese 
But you are unaware 
As you enjoy the sultry breeze 
Blowing through your hair 
Summer's in the air 

My love, where would I be 
If you were not there 
You and me and the sun and the sea 
It's way beyond compare 
Summer's in the air
