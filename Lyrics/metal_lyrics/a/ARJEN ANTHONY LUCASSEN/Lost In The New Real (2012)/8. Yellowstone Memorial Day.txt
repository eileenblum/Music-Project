"Despite hi-tech discovery, men still fight wars and mankind still fights nature. Lett me tell you about big mama. Our only mama. Mama Nature.â

The earth seemed asleep
As if time had been paused
A silence so deep
Even birds stopped their song

The wind had died down
The air became close
When from under the ground
Natureâs fury arose

Then out of the blue
The world started to shake
There was nothing to do
No way out, no escape

The earth belched out fire
Erupting in rage
Ashes darkened the skies
Thousands died in the flames

Man will always remember
Death and fire fell like rain
Changing history forever
The quake to end all quakes

Yellowstone Memorial Day
Lest we never forget
Our planetâs a cruel place
We are livingâ¦ on the edge

Shockwaves circled the earth
Massive waves crushed the shores
All the world felt the burst
The unstoppable force

Our technology failed
To avoid this event
Mother nature prevailed
And sheâll do it again!
