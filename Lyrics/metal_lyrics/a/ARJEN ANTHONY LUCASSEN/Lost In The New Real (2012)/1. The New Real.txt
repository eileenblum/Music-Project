"Of Course... Mr L. Wake up slowly. But don't move yet. You will need time to recover. And welcome back. My name is Voight-Kampff: I am your hardheaded shrink. My genetic team handled the damaged DNA in your head. You are as good as new (maintenance keeps quality.) I will help you adjust to all things changed. Keep you up to date. Now tell me... the last thing you remember"

I remember dying
Shifting into black
I remember dreaming
Of a second chance

Worn out by fighting
The unrelenting pain
end my weary longing
For a different fate

Defenses down
I flide into the New Real
Awaking to another world

What awaits me out here
In This Foreign Place
Will this world accept me
Will I find my space

Defenses down
I glide into the New Real
Awaking to another world

I lost my ground
Conforming to the New Real
Connecting to a different world
