âDraw a line in the sandâ¦ Fact dash machine, or truth, lies and Youtube. Delete your SKYpad2 avatar. Sheâs so real, so dangerousâ¦ Do you want to talk about it?"

She saidâ¦

"Donât switch me off
Iâm not sleepy
Iâll stay with you
If thatâs okayâ¦

Donât shut me down
I think I like you
I need a friend
Please let me stay

Donât switch me off
We are connected
You need my dreams
You crave my lies

Donât turn me out
Youâre lost without me

Turn me on
But donât switch me off"

Canât tell if she is real
Canât trust the way I feel
Is she alive or just a dream?
Or only a machine?

"Donât switch me off
You donât want to
Iâm in your thoughts
Iâm in your mind

Donât turn me out
I wonât let you
Turn me on
But donât switch me off"

Canât tell if you are real
Canât trust the way I feel
Are you alive or just a dream?
Or only a machine?
