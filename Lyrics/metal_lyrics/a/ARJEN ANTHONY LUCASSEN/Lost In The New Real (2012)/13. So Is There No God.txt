Scientists have succeeded in creating organic life, which has raised some serious theological issues. Additionally, the rise of super-intelligent, "godlike" machines makes the existence of a sentient entity -- capable of creating a universe -- quite plausible...

"There is no god"
I heard them say
No hell or heaven, no need to pray
So is there no God?

There is no plan
No grande design
A great enigma, but not divine
So is there no plan?
Is there no God?

Could it be life is a dream?
My private fantasy, created just by me
Or could it be some scheme?
A giant master plan,
that spiraled out of hand

There is no truth
We don't understand
This dance of nature, this game of chance
Is there no truth?
Is there no God?

Could it be we are all alone
A tiny blip in space, an isolated case
So much is still unknown
The more that we reveal,
the more it seems unreal

Is it a mere contingency?
A turn of the cards, a roll of the dice
Designed by destiny?
A lie within the truth, a truth within the lie.
