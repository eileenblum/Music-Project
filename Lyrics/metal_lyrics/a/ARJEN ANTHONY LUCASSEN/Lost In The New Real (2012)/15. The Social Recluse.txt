Using brain-computer interface technology, people in the New Real can connect with each other within their own private virutal worlds.

I might just stay at home again
Hanging out with virtual friends
Let's meet up in 3D space
Waste some time playing pointless games

(you are on your own)
We don't have to talk anymore
(but never quite alone)
This idle chatter...it's such a bore
(feeling right at home)
Don't even need to know your name
(your own comfort zone)
I won't remember it anyway...

Coz in this virtual realm of my imagination
I make friends without obligations
I live like a social recluse
In the comfort of my own mind

I thrive on isolation
but you're welcome to my simulation
call me a social recluse
but i never felt more alive

We're all connected in this virtual life
there are no boundaries once inside
no need to travel or see anyone
No need to touch or feel anything

(you are on your own)
i never liked to socialize
(but never quite alone)
It's not my nature to compromise
(feeling right at home)
if I don't trust you, i turn you off
(your own comfort zone)
and pull the plug once I had enough

I'm living a life without complications
Avoiding all close relations
I'm glad I'm a social recluse
All I want, I've got here inside

I hook up to this new application
Tap into the latest sensation
call me a social recluse
but this is all I need in my life.
