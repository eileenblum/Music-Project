âModern science has extended human life. But is longevity what you really want? Be careful what you wish for... Come onâ¦ face the music!"

Will I still be active, passionate and full of life?
Or will I feel redundant,
Yearning for the day Iâll dieâ¦

Will I still be relevant, or will I be ignored?
Never thought Iâd wonder
What the future has in storeâ¦
When Iâm a hundred sixty-four

Where will I be living, marble palace
or dirt floor?
When will I get my pension,
I wouldnât want to work no moreâ¦
When Iâm a hundred sixty-four

Will I turn grey, or sport a toupee?
Or even care anymoreâ¦
At a hundred sixty-four

I hope Iâll still be noticed.
Turning heads like before
Will I be cool or nerdy,
up-to-date or dinosaur
When Iâm a hundred sixty-four

Will I be lazy, stuck in my chair
It all seems so crazy, guess I wonât care
anymoreâ¦at a hundred sixty-four
I might just be boredâ¦
at a hundred sixty-four
