"Just a few ancient questions left. Mr. L. What the hell is real? Who am i and why not? Why donât we smell the roses anymore? When do we get another shot? Truly. Madly. Magic sun and moon and from sand to dust and dust to earth. Mama. Yoursâ¦ Voight-Kampff."

[A. GHOSTS]

Drifting In a world I donât belong
I miss her, how can i face this life alone?

I do remember
Like it was yesterday
You and me together
Back in a different age

Reaching for the ghosts haunting my mind
Dreaming of the ones I left behind

Hopelessâ¦ there is nothing I can do
Knowing I can never be with you again

[B. DEAD OR ALIVE]

Why did you bring me back?
Like a lab rat in a maze
Am i dead or alive?
With all these wires stuck in my brain
Why did you wake me up?
Locked in this virtual jail
Why was I revived?
Is this all some game?
Lost in this maze
Locked in this brain

So this is the endâ¦
Why did you bring me back?
Like a lab rat in a maze
Or maybe a start
Am I dead or alive?

With all these wires tuck in my brain
So what happens nowâ¦
Why did you wake me up?
Locked in this virual jail
Canât find a way outâ¦
Why was i revived?
Is this all some game?

[C. SYNTHETIC STATE OF CONSCIOUSNESS]

I could decide to stay here
And dream on forevermore
To live without the danger
And the fear I felt before
A life devoid of sadness.
No more suffering and pain
In a realm of make-believe
Within the limts of my brain

But can I really fool myself
(could I thrive inside this lucid dream?)
Into believing Iâm still me
(in this mind-machine technology)
A synthetic state of consciousness
(could I be a part of this New Real?)
I am therefore I think

Could I dream forevermore
Without the fear I felt before
Thereâll be no suffering and pain
Within the confines of my brain

[D. BLISSFUL IGNORANCE]

[Instrumental]

[E. A SECOND CHANCE?]

I remember dying
Fading into black
I remember dreaming
Of a second chance

The New Real â a paradise?
Inviting â exciting â a new home
The New Real â a web of lies?
Confusion â delusion â I am alone
The New Real â a golden dream?
Serenity â my destiny â a new home
The New Real â a cold machine?
Mistaken â forsaken â I am alone

[F. SWITCH ME OFF]

Please switch me off
I am sure now
I donât belong
In this New Real

Please shut me down
I am fine now
Thanks for the dream
You can switch me off

Now I know this is not real
I canât trust the way I feel
Iâm aliveâ¦ but in a dream
Am I onlyâ¦ a machine?
