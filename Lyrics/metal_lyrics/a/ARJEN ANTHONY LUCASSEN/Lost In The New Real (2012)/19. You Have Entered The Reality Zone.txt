While virtual reality permeates the New Real culture, many are still drawn to experiences in physical reality. So a large island was restored to its natural state, and populated with several extinct species brought back to life. But can people still cope without the comforts of modern technology at their beck and call?

Welcome to Sanctuary Island
Leave your possessions at the gate
Rejoin the struggle for survival
A new life begins today

No machines, no computers
No TV, not even phones
No factories, industrial polluters
You have entered the reality zone

Out here on Sanctuary Island
You're but a shackle in the chain
You play your part in nature's cycle
This is the Old Real, not a game

Awoken by the silence
Hiding from the cold
Warming by the fire
Captivated by its glow

Mastodons on the horizon
Pandas curl up in the trees
The mighty roar of the tiger
Dolphins circle through the seas
