"Okay, so.. we brainiacs finally figured out that we live in multiple universes. Pffâ¦a billion stars afar, butâ¦ really, what quantum mindfuck is that? Are you ready? Knock yourself out. Freakyâ¦"

Darwin defended creation
Einstein travelled in time
Columbus discovered India
And Shakespeare couldnât rhyme

O.J. pleaded guilty
Manson made parole
Reagan won five Oscars
And Meryl none at all

Elvis was a vegan
Dylan never got stoned
Alice was known as Vincent
And Bowie was just Jones

Michael looked like Michael
Keith drank only juice
Madonna was a virgin
And Jimi played the flute

Bondâs drink was stirred not shaken
Darth Vader had no son
Dorothy was still in Kansas
And Clint didnât own a gun

Rocky had no sequels
Arnold never came back
ET dialed the wrong number
And Dolly had no rack.
