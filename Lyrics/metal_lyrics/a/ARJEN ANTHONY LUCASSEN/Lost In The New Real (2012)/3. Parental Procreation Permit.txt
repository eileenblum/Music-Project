"The WE Earth program holds 2 billion of the human species. Not counting illegal slaves or temporary aliens. The poor and sick will just be written off.  Human population is to be reduced to a much safer level. A 7-step evolution program has been implemented. Four steps down, three to go..."

Our world was choking, no air to breathe
Our numbers growing at alarming speed

Millions were starving, dying of thirst
So the system started controlling birth

The heat was searing, the rivers dry
Stars disappearing in a toxic sky

Mass unemployment, substance abuse
Could be avoided, or at least reduced

If you want to create a life
You've got to be qualified
Now you need to earn it

If you want to propagate
First prove you can educate
Parental Procreation Permit

No more war and destruction
No more climate disruption
No more crime and pollution
Now we've got the solution

Parental Procreation Permit

The streets were jammed.
the roads were blocked
The prisons crammed, the borders locked

Eco-degradation, pollution and disease
Crippled our nation, poisoned our seas

Are you sure you can raise a kid?
Have you got what it takes?
Are you sure you can pay for it?
There's no room for mistakes!
Are you sure, can you take the risk?
Protect and keep it safe?
Are you sure, I am not convinced!
PARENTAL PROCREATION PERMIT!
