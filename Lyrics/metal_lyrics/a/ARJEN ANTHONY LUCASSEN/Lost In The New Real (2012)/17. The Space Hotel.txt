Plans for space tourism were already in the works by twenty-first century. Technology in the New Real has made the dream part of everyday life.

There's nothing like a weekend getaway in space!

It's 6 am, we're about to leave
My heart is racing as I take my seat.
What a feeling, so unreal, a cosmic holiday.
Still can't believe it, the final frontier,
a journey into Space.

The hatches close, everyone's aboard.
The engine's churning, we're taking off.
It has started,there's no way back
now we're on our way
We have departed into the black,
a journey into Space.
We're on a cosmic holiday

From the hotel lounge, we admire the Earth
The seas and clouds, our amazing world
In zero G you can loose yourself
Floating free in the Space Hotel.

Making love, in zero gravity
Will outspace your wildest fantasy
What a feeling, so unreal, a cosmic holiday
Still can't believe it, the final frontier,
making out in space

See the sun arise fifteen times a day,
The crystal shine of the milky way
We're spinning around and raising Hell
Hanging out in the Space Hotel.

From the hotel lounge we admire the Earth
The seas and clouds, our amazing world
In zero G you can loose yourself
Floating free in the Space Hotel.

Flying up to the bar, doing somersaults
Playing guitar, bouncing off the walls
We're spinning around, and raising Hell
Hanging out in the Space Hotel
