I remember the old days,
On the digital seas.
It was a time,
When pirates ruled the waves

I remember the old ways,
People did as they pleased (back in my age)
There were no rules out there in cyberspace
Where chaos raged

Stay clear
The E-police are here
To watch every move you make
24 hours a day

No fear
The E-police are near
Designed to keep you safe,
To make sure you behave
(They're gonna catch you when you steal, there's no excuses, no appeal, how does that feel)

I remember the old days,
Anticipation was dead
We could not wait,
Tomorrow was too late.

I remember the old ways,
Sharing files on the net (back in my age)
Reducing this world,
To a dull and selfish place.
A spoiled race

Stay clear
The E-police are here
To watch every move you make
24 hours a day

No fear
The E-police are near
Designed to keep you safe,
To make sure you behave
They control your every move, and they know everything you do, theyâre on to you!

You're not allowed to share, cause they don't think it's really fair, so don't you dare.
They're gonna catch you when you steal, or when you make some shady deal, how does that feel,

(Beware, for the E-police are out there)

They control your every move, and they know everything you do, theyâre on to you!

(Take care, for the E-police are here)

You cannot hide, you will be found,
Theyâre justified to shut you down!

(Beware, for the E-police are everywhere)

Youâre in their files, their database,
There'll be no trial, you have no case

(Take care, for the E-police are near)

They know your name, your interface,
You will be framed, youâll be erasedâ¦
