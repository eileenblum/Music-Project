"Why create more music - if it was all done before. Computer generated noise in millions of gigs. Of all kinds and all formats. Imagine 7/D plus! Flash your ID. pick your heart's desire. Click it, keep it. It's auto-drive pre-shock, momma!"

Every song's been sung before,
every note's been played,
Every chord has been strummed before
Every melody's been made

They've heard it all by now,
nothing left to be inspired by,
it all seems so unreal somehow,
as I sit back and close my eyes.

I just think of what I like,
any blend will do,
They reproduce what's in my mind,
But it feels like something new.

Pink beatles in a purple zeppelin,
Same old sound, different song.
(And the song remains the same).
Pink beatles in a purple zeppelin,
Sounds so right, feels so wrong.

Every tune's been hummed before,
every album's been produced.
Every rhyme's been applied before,
and every music style has fused.

I just think of what I like,
any blend will do,
They reproduce what's in my mind,
But if feels like something new.

Pink beatles in a purple zeppelin,
Same old sound, different song.
(And the song remains the same).
Pink beatles in a purple zeppelin,
Sounds so right, feels so wrong.

Pink beatles in a purple zeppelin,
Same old sound, different song.
Pink beatles in a purple zeppelin,
Sounds so right, feels so wrong.
