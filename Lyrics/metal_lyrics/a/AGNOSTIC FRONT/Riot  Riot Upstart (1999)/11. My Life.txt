It's my life 1234
Everybody's got a price to pay
It's my life
Gonna do things my own way
It's my life
Get what's mine - take what's left
It's my life
Live my life with no regrets
It's my life

Everybody's got a right today
It's my life
Do what I do anyway
It's my life
At night I walk the streets alone
It's my life
And I might not feel like going home
It's my life

Everybody's got a price to pay
It's my life
Gonna do things my own way
It's my life
Get what's mine - take what's left
It's my life
Live my life with no regrets
It's my life
