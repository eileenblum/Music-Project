Abandoned - Nowhere can I turn
Fallen - A lesson to be learned

You hand me the blame, all this never ends
ItÂ´s always the same, IÂ´ll get this never ends
All I know - Got nowhere to go
Nothing to show - Got nowhere to go.

Illusion - Things they should be clear
Delusion - No doubt was ever there.

Whoah oh! - Got nowhere to go
Left alone with nothing to show.
In the streets weÂ´ve made a home
Our friends are all those we know.

Not guilty, I plead the fifth
Faced the consequences for the crimes I did.
People keep tryinÂ´ to put me down
IÂ´m right here IÂ´m still around.
