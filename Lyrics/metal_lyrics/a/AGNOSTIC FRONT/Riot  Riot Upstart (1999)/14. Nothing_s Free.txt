ThereÂ´s a price to pay, for what your wanna say
Another revolution, thereÂ´s no solution
In the summertime, in the streets of crime
want a situation, one of desperation.

IÂ´ve got, youÂ´ve got
WhoÂ´s got the right to say - whatÂ´s for me
IÂ´ve got, youÂ´ve got - weÂ´ve got an enemy.

ThereÂ´s no sympathy, a world of apathy
In the name of peace, thereÂ´s no relief
Where did time go, on death row.
