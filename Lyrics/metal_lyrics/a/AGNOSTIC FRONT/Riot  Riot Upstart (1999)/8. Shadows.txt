Civilized society they donÂ´t know
WhatÂ´s right or wrong
A generation out of touch
CanÂ´t seem to get along.

My angerÂ´s Magnified
frustrations multiplied
I know what you wonÂ´t find - inside of me
Shadows of society - CanÂ´t be disguised
Shadows of society - All I despise.

Regulated thoughts
They move freely through your brain
YouÂ´ve got no alibis, time to plead insane.

Never claimed to be a prophet
Outspoken for our times
No money, more problems
Just sit and watch the world go by.
