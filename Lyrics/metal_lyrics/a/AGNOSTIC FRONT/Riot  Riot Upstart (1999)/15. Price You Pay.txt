GettinÂ´ sick of everyone around here
I donÂ´t think you know or understand
all these people think they fuckinÂ´ know me
Circulate the rumors again.

Think you want something
donÂ´t you know the price you pay
DonÂ´t you know nothingÂ´s ever gonna go your way.

GettinÂ´ sick of everybodyÂ´s breakdown
I donÂ´t think they know or understand
All these fucking people try to play me
Now IÂ´ve got to beat them at their games.
