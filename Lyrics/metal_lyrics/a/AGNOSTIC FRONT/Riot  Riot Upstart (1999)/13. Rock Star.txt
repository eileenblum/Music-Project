You choose the path you take
Yours was a big mistake
You put yourself at stake
Â´Cause you just try too hard to be real.

Used to be so hard
wanna be rock star
Now I think itÂ´s time to get back to.
What was once ideal.

Â´Cause you run your mouth
Always talk about
How you hang around
Who cares anyhow!
Always being down
When you come around
Who cares anyhow!

Whatever it takes to make
Whatever it takes to make you...
Feel this way - go on and dig your grave
Because you want things your way.
We donÂ´t respect you anyway.
