I know he had a lot on his mind
I know he put a bullet in his brain
Too many times IÂ´ve tried to realize
He had a lot held a lot of pain.

IÂ´ve seen a lot of fighting seen a lot of pain
Seen a lot of fucked up days
Seen a lot of fighting seen a lot of pain
Seen them all throw it all away.

Never knew I never seen the signs
Now I know IÂ´ve got to take the blame
Too many times I tried to realize
You know he was a victim in pain.

A bullet on Mott St.
