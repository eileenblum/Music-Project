People out looking for another way
to fulfill their dreams
never mattered much to me anyway
thatÂ´s what I believe.

I donÂ´t care anymore
just like I never did before

Find myself staring at the walls
like a psychopathic man
thinking about nothing at all
youÂ´d never understand.
