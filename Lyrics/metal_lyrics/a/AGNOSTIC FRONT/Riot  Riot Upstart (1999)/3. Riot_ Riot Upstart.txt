Say you got two friends so tight with them
See them all running
They all want revenge
See them on the street
See them all around 
Upset the system
Gonna burn it down

RIOT! RIOT! RIOT! RIOT!

Take a swing, fight back
Chances that you take
Knock down, drag out
Stories all the same.
Street fight tonight
What you gonna do?
Someone's always running up behind you...

See them on the run with bullets in their head
See them all fighting
They all want revenge
You want a riot -
You want a fight - New York City is ours tonight

You better get ready - no time to mess around
You better get ready - cause there's no backing down
