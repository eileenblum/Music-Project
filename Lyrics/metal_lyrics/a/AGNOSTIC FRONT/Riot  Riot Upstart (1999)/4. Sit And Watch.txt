I sit and watch as time goes by
My ambitions are obsolete
what ever happened to the way things were!
The way things used to be.

Broken glass from a stolen car
drug dealers surround me
What ever happened to the way
things used to be?

I sit and watch you from my window
My rent check 2 weeks late
What ever happened to the working man!
He just does not get paid.

Integrity - My hopes, my dreams
I try to do whatÂ´s right, whatÂ´s right for me
Integrity - thoughts inside my head.
It seems IÂ´m getting fucked
Until the day IÂ´m dead.
