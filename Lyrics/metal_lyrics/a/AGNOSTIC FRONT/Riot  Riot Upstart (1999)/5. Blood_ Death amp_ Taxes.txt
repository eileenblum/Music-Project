So close so far away
suspected so you say
TheyÂ´ve got a place for me
IÂ´m a displaced society.

IÂ´m not looking for compensation
I want some justice
Tell you what they want from me
Blood, death and taxes.

Fed up - My hands are tied
Frustrated - Down the line
Busted and out of time.
How could I have been so blind.

They wonÂ´t fuckinÂ´ rest until IÂ´m dead.
