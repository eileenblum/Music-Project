I see right through your games
I know whatÂ´s going on
You need a desperate change
You think youÂ´re the only one.

You got no sanctuary - as far as I can see
YouÂ´ve got no power over me I disagree.

Set things straight - IÂ´m gonna set things straight
IÂ´ve had enough
You and me are gonna set things straight
IÂ´ve had enough

IÂ´ve got no time for this
My life is passing by
ThereÂ´s nothing that IÂ´ll miss
ItÂ´s time to say goodbye.

IÂ´ve had enough
Â´cause youÂ´re too much
IÂ´ve had enough
youÂ´re just too much.
