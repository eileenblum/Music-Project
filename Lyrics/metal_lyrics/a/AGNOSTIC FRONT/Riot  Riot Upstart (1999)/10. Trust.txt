Deceived by your control
Innocence betrayed as your mind has been
Forced to evolve in order to
Hide behind your pain.

Protect yourself from harm
When authorityÂ´s ignored and you
Have found that trust is lost
And gone and who will be
The strength weÂ´re looking for.

CanÂ´t trust them itÂ´s all lies
How they dehumanize.

Throw your rules in my face
No one respects your ways
Ignorance is no excuse
As it all comes back to you
Too much too little too late
Some things remain the same.
