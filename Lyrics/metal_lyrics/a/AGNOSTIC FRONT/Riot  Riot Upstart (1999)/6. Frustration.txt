What I donÂ´t want to ever
Have to think about again
What I donÂ´t want to ever
Have to think about again.
Well I donÂ´t want you tell me
About what I know I gotta do
Well I donÂ´t want you tell me
About what I know I gotta do.

Well IÂ´m frustrated walking down the street
You donÂ´t know what IÂ´m thinking in my head
When IÂ´m frustrated walking down the street
You donÂ´t know what I really understand.

Is it something that you gotta say
Is it something that you gotta do
Is it something that you want from me.
Something for you.
