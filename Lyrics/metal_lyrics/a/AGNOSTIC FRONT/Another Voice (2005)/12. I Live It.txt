Fuck you and everything that you've ever said about me
I despise you and I'll never show you mercy
This is my life, my oath and sincerity
I live it and I have no time for fantasies

I don't talk about it
I live it!
This is my reality
I live it!

Fuck you and everything that you say and you're about
I live your life, I hold no regrets
Cause you fear mine
I walk the walk, all you ever do is talk
And I'm tired of your bitching and cheap insults

You may take me out of the streets
But you'll never take the streets out of me

This is my life!
I live it!
