A choice must be made!

In these times of war today
A choice must be made that no one wants to make
The result is inevitable
No one wins but a side must be taken

It's them or us, we don't want it this way
Death is certain and lives are at stake
Whose children must die? Whose buildings must fall?
No one can see eye to eye, all we see is hate

Our freedom fighters are their terrorists
Their heroes are our nemesis

Peace! Is! Not! 
Peace is not an option!
