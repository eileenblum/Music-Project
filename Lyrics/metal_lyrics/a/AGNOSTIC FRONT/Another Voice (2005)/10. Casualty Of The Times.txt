Beaten down hang your head in shame
This world has washed your dignity away
A shell of a person, a wayward soul
Your heart barely beats as your blood runs cold
Alone you spend your days of apathy
You see your life through eyes of misery

You're another casualty of the times we live in!

I feel no pity for people like yourself
And I have no fucking sympathy for you or anyone else

Now you're broken, now you're distant
Now you're jaded, you're a piece of shit!
Now you're broken, now you're distant
You're another casualty of the times we live in!

No fucking pity! No fucking sympathy!
You're another casualty of the times we live in!
