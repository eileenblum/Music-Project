Do you think you could wash away your sins?
Did you believe I would let you disgrace me?
What fucking morals do you think I live by?
What more lies will you think of to tell this time?

All is not forgotten
You made your choice
All is not forgiven
Face your punishment

Betrayed by you, so-called friend, when I needed you the most
You walked away, you stabbed my heart
Your turn to bleed now
God may forgive and grant redemption but I have no remorse
Look upon your own reflection, your shame is revealed

Face your fucking punishment! Bleed!
