No one cares!
Been there done that, never seen you around
Your claim to my friendship never existed
The truth is you were not to be found
You must have imagined it, you just never had it

You talk about it 
Like you were there
It's all heresay
No one cares- No one hears you!

Honor you hold none you're not worthy
Pride you can't buy, you have to earn it
The stories you tell have no credibility
All your name dropping's gonna get your ass beat
Say what you will
No one hears you

It's all bullshit
No one cares- No one hears you
Shut the fuck up!
