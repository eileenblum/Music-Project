The life we lead, so pure to me
The strength we built, true honesty
Our loyalty we won't betray
Our roots so strong, they'll never fade

We'll never betray this!
Start from within, a search for an identity
Live for now, for yourself and not society
A promise to oneself to fight for something more
It's so pure! It's so pure!

They'll never fade!
Live this, moving on past yesterday
The future's ours, it's our time to find another way
Here right now, my mind, my life, myself to show!
It's so pure! It's so pure!

So pure to me, true honesty!
