It's your life, it's your dreams- Dedication!
It's what you make out of it- Dedication!
It's how you chose to live- Dedication!
It's your life, it's your dreams- Dedication!

I've committed myself to something so real to me
The path I chose strengthen my integrity
Nothing can compare, nothing shows any threats
Nothing can ever surpass my achievements

I remember way back when I felt alone
I had no one to turn to, nowhere to go
I found an outlet, a place to belong
It felt so right- New York Hardcore- My home!

Some people stayed, watched others go
Those few who walked away will never know
This is my home!
