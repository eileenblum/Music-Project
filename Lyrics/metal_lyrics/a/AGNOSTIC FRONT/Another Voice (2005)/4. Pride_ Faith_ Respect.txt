Pride, faith, respect- This is what we live for

This is dedicated to our fallen soldiers of the DMS Crew
You are gone but never forgotten
Con amor vaya con dios

We strive in honor for our brothers who are gone
Through the thick and the thin, we fight and push on
We'll never abandon all that we've built for years
No regrets, no pains, no guilt, no tears!

Pride is not a sin, it's a value- Pride is not a sin!

Pride, faith, respect- this is what we live for
Hardcore and this is what we die for
Our legacy is eternal, my crew is my family

Pride is not a sin, it's a value- Pride is not a sin! DMS Crew!

Pride, faith, respect- this is what we live for!
This is what we die for!

Pride is not a sin, it's a value
Don't ever question my values
