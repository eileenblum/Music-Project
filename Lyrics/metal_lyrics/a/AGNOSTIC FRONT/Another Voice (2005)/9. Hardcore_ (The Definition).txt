I won't live your lies
And I won't follow- It's my life!

Dissident towards the world
Our movement unconvinced
Of what has been force fed
Confronting all those who oppose
The definition of how we live!

Our way, our life, our scene
The definition!

Expression of how we live
Not following anyone's lies
Uncertain of the changing times
But we strive on to fight another day
The definition and what it means to me!
