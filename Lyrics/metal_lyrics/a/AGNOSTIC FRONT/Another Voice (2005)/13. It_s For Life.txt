You want to make a commitment? It's for life!

If you want to stand for something
You better stand tall and proud
Don't try to walk the fence or play both sides
Be ready to fight when they look you in the eye

You want to make a commitment? A commitment, it's for life
Don't try to make a commitment unless it's for life

Everyone's got a flag to wave
Until they are called on their beliefs
All I'm saying is you better back it up
When you come face to face with reality

When I make a commitment I stay true to what is right
I will never make a commitment unless it's for life
You want to make a commitment, a commitment, it's for life
I will never make a commitment unless it's for life
