So you hate your Mom, you hate your Dad
You hate "The State" because it's bad
But look at you, how do you rate?
You're just as bad as those you hate

You're telling me--you keep telling lies
But deep down inside--You're not true to your mind
All fucked up, king of the show
Flail at your friends, you don't know
Fight before and afterward
But it don't do you any good

So live your life in ignorance
Close your mind, your defiant stance
Isolate and isolate
Until you're gone and it's too late
To wake up and live
You're just a victim of your fate
