Day after day
See a world grow cold and grey
Did you see it today
Youth that rage while their idols age
Need some new start
See ideals for what they really are

What does it take?
Eyes for the blind
What does it take?
Strength of the mind

That's what it has to be
To cast everything aside for me
It takes sacrifice
To find the heart and set it free
You better find the drive
While you're young and still alive
No one hands you the truth
No one can say what's right for you
Don't wait for the call
Strength above all
Don't just wait in vain
For everything to change
Don't wait for the call
Strength above all
