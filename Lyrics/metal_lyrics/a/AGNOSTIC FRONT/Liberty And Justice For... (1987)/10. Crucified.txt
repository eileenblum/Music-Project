They ask why do we dress this way
Live for now--Don't understand today
See the kids--But don't hear what they say
Close your eyes and look the other way
Say the end justifies the means
Gonna lock us up and throw away the keys

Crucified--Crucified for your sins

Crucified--Crucified for your sins
They don't know our feelings--only desperate cries
They see reflections through distorted eyes
We don't care because it breaks their views
Got to learn to fight to live
Before they grind us under heel

We're the targets so easy to find
And we're the ones that won't stay in line
I find myself nailed to a cross
For something that I didn't do
It's your fault you've ruined our lives
And we're the ones you crucify
You're the ones who commit the crimes
But it's always us who do the time
