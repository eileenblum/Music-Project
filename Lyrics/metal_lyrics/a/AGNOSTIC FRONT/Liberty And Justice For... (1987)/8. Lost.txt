Yahweh promised a conquered land,
Domination over life--man against man
Mother Earth came to conflict with patriarchal powers
And eyes lit up with hierarchy fed desires
The spirit within--quickly became lost
In search of glory and power the rules of war were taught
The dogs, run wild, parting souls from lives
Bombs fragment, the Earth, leaving wounds in her side
The roots of perversion--so deeply planted
Man has become evil--peace and freedom tainted
Leaders ask their people to dig their graves deeper
No spirit of their own--they took heed of their keepers
Man finds himself trapped in aggression
He knows no other life but that of oppression
