So many people will come and go
Past their time before they know
Swear they were there from the start
Never had it in their hearts

Things you do--come back to you
Things you've said--echo on inside your head
Figureheads come cheap these days
No one listens to what they say
In their faces I see the fear
A crucial moment drawing near

You pay the price--take bad advice
What they said--echoes on in your head
