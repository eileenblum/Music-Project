You--You raised your fist
You were some real Anarchist
Made a lot of promises to your friends
You'd never let it end

Now--You just sit and stare like old men
Now--You talk about how it was then
Now it's a few years later
Your scene isn't looking so good
Everything you had, the lives you led
Dead or misunderstood
So--You'll rise from the dead
You'll show everyone
But you're running, running scared
From ghosts of the past
You can't run too fast
No--You'll never get back what you had
No--Well...that's just too bad
Gone--Where did it go, it happened yesterday
No--Where did it go, it happened yesterday
