Changes that were hardly noticed
Until time itself became a chain
Once hot blood began to cool
My ever slowing heart--beat in vain

From the nightmare I wake in another dream
And stare at an unbroken sky
Try to distill a cure for the plague
That's put to rest everything--I once felt inside
To never again be bound by United Blood
A sense of purpose lost forever more
Is this the way I'll die? No!
I'll find the sense of honor--that I held once before

The Blood--The Honor--The Truth
Thought it would never end
The Blood--The Honor--The Truth
Can be part of our lives again
