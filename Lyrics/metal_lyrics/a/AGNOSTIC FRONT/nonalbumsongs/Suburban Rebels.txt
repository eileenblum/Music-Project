[from "The Worldwide Tribute To The Real Oi" Compilation][Originally by The Business]They're the sons and daughters of well bankers
Tom Robinson's army of trendy wankers
Flared blue jeans and anoracks
With yellow streaks all down their backs

Who act so tough when their on tv
But trendy wankers don't scare me

Oi!, Oi! Oi! Chosen few
This is what we think of you
Oi!, Oi! Oi! Chosen few
This is what we think of you
Suburban rebels playing at reds
You wouldn't be urban terrorists
You don't scare us with your badges and banners
You know fuck all about having manners

You're the middle class kiddies from public school
Who write the slogans on toilet walls
Like Tony clones in plastic masks
You wave a hammer sickle, never Union Jacks

Got lots of mouth when your in a crowd
But when your alone you don't speak loud

Oi! Oi! Oi! Chosen few
This is what we think of you
Oi! Oi! Oi! Chosen few
This is what we think of you
Suburban rebels playing at reds
You wouldn't be urban terrorists
You don't scare us with your badges and banners
You know fuck all about having manners
