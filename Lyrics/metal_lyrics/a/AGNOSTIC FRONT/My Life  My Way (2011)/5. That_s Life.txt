You're too young to understand me
I'm too old to give a damn
But there's something I can tell you
I've lived things you could not bare

That's Life who cares, right?

I don't care about you people
Talking from behind a screen
I'm from a school where real people walk the walk
Know what I mean?

That's Life! Who fucking cares?

There's Nothing,
Nothing you can say to me.
Or do, never no! Not you!
I don't have anything to prove.
I've done it all, and I still can
Fuck You!

You're too young to understand me
I'm too old to give a damn
But there's something I can tell you
After you're gone, I'll still be here!

Who cares! That's Life!
