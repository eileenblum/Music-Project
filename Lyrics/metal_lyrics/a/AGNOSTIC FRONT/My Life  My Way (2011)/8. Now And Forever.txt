This is our movement
This is our lifestyle
It's where we belong
We built this together
This is forever
More than a song

United we stand, together we can't fall
Now and forever, I found where I belong

From the start I knew I found where I belong
I was young and reckless and never would conform
Who ever thought that I would come this far
Never knew I had this passion deep inside my heart

Now and forever
We are united
We are strong!

United we stand, together we can't fall
Now and forever, I found where I belong

Now I know what I was fighting for
The entire struggle and the pain could never be ignored
You built them up but we broke down the walls
Now we built a new foundation that can never be destroyed
