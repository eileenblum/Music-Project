What happened to the world today what
Happens all you say what happened yesterday?
All we do is watch our back sleep with
This and fuck with death we're ready to attack
I can't seem to find a better way
I can't seem to think about today
Now I'm never doing right
Take a chance on what you feel and maybe
You will start to feel alright!

Alcohol and violence all those skams
And dirty tricks waiting for the tide to shift
So your life is not on track shooting dope
And smoking crack how long do
You think you'll last?

Somebody told me no matter how you feel don't
Forget to know what's real
Situations everyday you can't make a difference
If you turn the other way
Nobody's right nobody's wrong can you see the
Light outside before to long
I've got my pride passed down from my fathers
Side and you can never take it away

What happened to the world today what happens
All you say what happened yesterday?
All we do is watch our backs from aids
Heartaches and death- fight it all
Till my last breath!
