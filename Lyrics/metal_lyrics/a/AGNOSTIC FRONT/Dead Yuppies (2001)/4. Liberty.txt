They say we're born to lose, we got the right to choose
Do what we wanna do.
Be what we wanna be
They say we're out of touch.
Well their opinions don't mean that much to me
Give me liberty or give me death
Give me freedom to my very last breath
Give me liberty or give me death today

They say we're out of time.
We'll read between the lines
We don't believe the propaganda that's told
They say we're out of line that we got left behind
Yeah we don't wanna be nothing like YOU!

They say we're born to lose
We've got the right to choose
We'll do what the fuck we want today
