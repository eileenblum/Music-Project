When it all goes wrong man you know that feeling
Gotta work and still can't pay rent
See them walk by in the latest fashion
The streets are filled with just me and them
When money is your god with your credit cards
Quality of life is just fucked up
I just turn around and watch a cadillac car see
Them mow'em all down! oh yeah!
Dead yuppies on the sidewalk right in front of me
Dead yuppies on the sidewalk lying on the streets
Never coming back as far as I can see
Dead yuppies on the sidewalk right in front of me
Front of me lying there right on the street

Living life with no believing
Well everything is all profit then
Raising the rents in the neighborhood buildings
60 hours a week and I'm a still broke man
They're in the restaurants in the laundromat
Every where I go you know I see'em
As I pass by beside a run away car and I watch'em
All die! oh yeah!

They where sitting in the restaurant outside you
Know that part
Across the street at the light he had a heart
Attack hit the gas that's all she wrote
He had a heart attack hit the gas
Leave their dead bodies in the trash...Dead bodies
