Subway ride a free ride somewhere I can't explain
Another night I climb a 10-story building just to spit on a passing parade
Suspect defeat change the tv station as the media tkaes over your brain
Expedite unite bring yourself together before you drive yourself insane
Some say I'm crazy but there's no other way
What goes around comes around, goes around again

Stolen car 1 more of a thousand in the city that never sleeps
Another please help me I'm drowning in the sewers running under the streets
Newscast outcast stranger to society stranger to the trends today
Exclaim refrain say what your thinking prison in so many ways
