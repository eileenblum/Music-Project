Do you feel so betrayed like
To dance that beat away?
Hip-pop club guys look at
You feel so free what can
You do put yourself down
you're a disgrace
Why do you support them?
As they call you bitch to your face
Why do you support them?
Listen to the rhythm it's so
Great you don't care what the lyrics say
Trade your pride for a
Dance You'll support them
As you laugh

As I see you're going nowhere
but you like the fashion that they wear
You let them put you down
Cause it's popular music and
You'll pretend that you don't care
Speak up in a crowd you don't dare
you'll just pretend that you don't Care...
OH YEAH
