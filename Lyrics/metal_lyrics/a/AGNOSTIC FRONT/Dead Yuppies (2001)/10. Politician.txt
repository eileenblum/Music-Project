You think that you're always right throw
Your line and see what bites
Need to clarify your way with violence in our
Minds each day
Now the time is here excuses made from fear
What we want from you nothing but the truth!
Sitting down behind your desk with offices to represent
With democrats and anarchist never know what to expect
What we want today is to find another way
Someone we can choose don't make thigns right
For you!

So we follow you like sheep well I dont think you
Fit the lead
Voted in and voted out time to see what life's about
Citizens revenge this is where it ends
No more lies from you now your time is thru!

Justify it.Justify it now!
