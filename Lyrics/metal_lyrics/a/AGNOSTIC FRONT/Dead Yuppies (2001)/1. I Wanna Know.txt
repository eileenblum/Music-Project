In a world of made up heros
Broken promises and zeros
I can't seem to see much worse than this
I wanna know, wanna know what's going on?
Wanna know what's going on today

In a world not fact but fiction
Farytales and drug addictions
I cant seem to see much worse than this

I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
What's going on today!

I've got no feeling, I've got no feeling there's
No more feelings inside of me

In a worldof constant hate
Rape and murder chalked up to fake
I cant seem to see much worse than this

Everything is alright today
