Since the day I turned 15 
I've been standing on my own
Never tried no suicide 
Standing on my own
Everyday I'm moving forward 
Even though it seems a little bit awkward
Lost myself a thousand times 
I found my way home 
I found my way home
Standing on my own with no help from you!

Since I lost my innocence 
I've been standing on my own
No time to reminisce 
Standing on my own
Everyday I seem to mess up 
Even though I think it's really bad luck
Lost myself a thousand times 
I found my way home
I found my way home
Standing on my own with no help from you!

Since the day I turned 15 
I've been standing on my own
Never tried no suicide 
Standing on my own
I learned to live, I learned to lie 
I've been standing on my own
I learned to fight, I'll learn to die
Standing on my own
Standing on my own
Standing on my own with no help from you!
Fuck you!
