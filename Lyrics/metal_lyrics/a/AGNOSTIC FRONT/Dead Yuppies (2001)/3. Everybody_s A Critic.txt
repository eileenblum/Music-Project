Call me a sellout. Call me a fake
How much do you have at stake?
It's nothing but lies.outrageous cries
A cry for help, look at yourself

So you talk it. Do you walk it?
Or do you police the scene?

Those who talk shit are really something
Lying to themselves hiding something

Watching everyone, watching you
Watching me, FUCK YOU!
