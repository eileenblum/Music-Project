You hide behind our cause
Wave a flag for all to see
We know all your flaws
Your intent, always greed
Superseed for your greed
Stab our backs, we bleed
No shit, we won't take
Realize you're just a fake
Played your games with no respect to me
Now I see you're no friend to me
Sucking the life right out of me
