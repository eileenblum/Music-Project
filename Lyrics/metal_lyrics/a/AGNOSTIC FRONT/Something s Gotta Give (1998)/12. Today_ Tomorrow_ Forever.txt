Who says Ol'Glory's gone
The pride we still carry on
Remember those led astray
POWER - WON'T FADE AWAY TODAY, TOMORROW, FOREVER [x2]
UNITED - WE STAND DIVIDED - WE FALL
Respect you must earn
An honor for all...
TODAY, TOMORROW, FOREVER
WE GOTTA STICK TOGETHER
WE'RE DOWN FOR LIFE FOREVER DIVIDED...
NEVER UNITED,
TOGETHER TODAY, TOMORROW, FOREVER
