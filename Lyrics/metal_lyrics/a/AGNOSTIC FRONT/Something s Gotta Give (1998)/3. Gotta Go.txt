From the east coast to the west coast
Gotta gotta gotta go
Two sounds of a revolution
Gotta gotta gotta go
In our hearts in our souls
Gotta gotta gotta go
(oi)
United we stand, divided we fall
Gotta gotta go

Canât keep touch with you or me
Gotta gotta go
Need sense of security
Gotta gotta go
Want to live my life for me
Gotta gotta go
Why canât they just let me be
Gotta gotta go

Say Iâm crazy
Just brain dead
Planting thoughts
Within my head
Canât believe
What Iâve said
What has become of me
What has become of me

Donât believe what youâve been told
Gotta gotta go
Never seen no streets paved in gold
Gotta gotta go
Mindless violence ruined me
Gotta gotta go
No such thing as something free
Gotta gotta go

Say Iâm crazy
Just brain dead
Planting thoughts
Within my head
Canât believe
What Iâve said
What has become of me
What has become of me

I gotta gotta go
Gotta gotta go
I gotta gotta go
Gotta gotta go
I gotta gotta get out of here
Gotta gotta go
I gotta gotta go
Gotta gotta go
I gotta gotta go
I gotta gotta go
I gotta gotta go
I gotta gotta get out of here

I gotta gotta go
I gotta gotta go
I gotta gotta get
Out of Here
