Right before my eyes I've been betrayed
I've worked so hard and everything
I fucking gave you haven't changed
A rat, a traitor, digging yourself a grave...
Right before my eyes. I see all your shame
I feel all your pain
You have turned your back
I'm in a rage, can't control
My feeling
I've been upstaged
Life in a cage, no longer human burning from all the hate,
Against the grain I live this life every single fucking day
Nothing to save something that was will never be that way again
