It's me or you, and something's gotta give
You take from me all that is pure
A lesson I have learned
Now's your chance to turn and walk on bridges that you've burned
Too much shit can't get ahead
Something's gotta give
I don't know friend or foe
Something's gotta give
Come at me your gonna lose
Don't piss me off don't light my fuse
The choice is never yours of course
And I'll survive with no remorse
GO!
