Talk about the problems today
Give me my freedom, give me my say
They wanna take away our choices
They try to silence our voices
But they can't take away our pride
Do or die - All our lives
We have to fight - Just to survive
Society puts it's blame on me &amp; you
I'm not ashamed, there's nothing I can do
They tried to run, they tried to hide
They insulted my pride
There's nothing left to do but fight NEW YORK HARDCORE
In a life of pain with no restraint
Reach deep inside and find the strength
