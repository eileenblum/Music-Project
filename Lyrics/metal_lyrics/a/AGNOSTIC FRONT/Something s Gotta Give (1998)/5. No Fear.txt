You've tried my patience to many times
You've got to much to say
Old soldiers never die
They just fade away
Intimidation and all those games
You play so well
They don't phase me I stand my ground I'll see you in hell
Look into my eyes, when the end is near
A reflection of yourself, living with no fear
You've got the right to turn and walk
You've got the right to stay
In the end we all get fucked
Things never change
Who are you to run my life I think for myself
And if you've got a problem with that I'll see you in hell
No fear [x2]
Intimidation your game No fear
You think we'll fade away No fear [x2]
