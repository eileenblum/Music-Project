Blinded but now I see, my choice is my destiny
I got back what I lost, but was it worth the cost?
My back is turned, you can't wait to speak
No balls to back up what you preach BLINDED YOUR BLINDED
The time will come when someone calls your bluff
Your gonna burn, enoughs enough CAUSE YOU ARE BLINDED BY THE LIGHT AGAIN [x2]
