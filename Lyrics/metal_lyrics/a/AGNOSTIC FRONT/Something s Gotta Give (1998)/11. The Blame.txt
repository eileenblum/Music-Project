What are you gonna do?
When they all turn on you
Is it worth it for us to live
Their way?
It's their mistake and we're to blame.
Are we to live by the rules
And be told what to do
We're not part of their society
FUCK THEIR AUTHORITY
WE'RE THE YOUTH OF TODAY
And nothing can stand in our way
We are young and strong
With our new hopes, we can't go wrong
We'll live without conformity
We've got our dreams, fuck their authority
Can't you look around you?
And see the world of today
They are full of fucking hypocrites
Who keep lying to get their way
It's time for us to try to live our lives
TO KEEP OUR DREAMS ALIVE
TO MAKE THEM ALL REALIZE
That we gotta fight TILL WE DIE!
We've taken to many excuses
And we know we're right
The anger has grown inside us
And we're out for blood TONIGHT
