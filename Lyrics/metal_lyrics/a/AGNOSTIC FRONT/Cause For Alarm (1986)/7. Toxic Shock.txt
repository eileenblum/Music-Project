Toxins - buried underground
Seep into the water
Dioxin - she drank for nine straight months
Deformed her unborn daughter
Factories - spewing poison fumes
The cause of acid rain
Destroy crops and animals
Lives flushed down the drain
Radon - creeps up from the earth
Public dies of cancer
Danger - of chemical nightmare
When will we find the answer
Barrels leak the vile substance
There's no containing them
Contamination - of the food we eat
Absorb plutonium
Seconds ticking fast away
On Earth's bio clock
Politicians allow the dumping
Must be forced to stop
I hope they live on an abandoned waste site
And die of toxic shock
