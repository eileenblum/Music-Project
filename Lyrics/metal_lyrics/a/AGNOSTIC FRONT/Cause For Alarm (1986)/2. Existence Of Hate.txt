They told me when I was young that I would change
What I once saw would become like everything else
The same -
The open eyes of youth would close down just to cracks
I would - never again see the real world
Just like the rest, I'd turn my back
I told them once when I was young
That it was too late for me to change
I couldn't ignore the facts
The reality that brought this incredible pain

[Chorus:]
Scars within my flesh and soul
Stayed just for show
Seeing, I felt and saw things
Others could never know
They tell me now to turn my head
So that I may rest at peace
But ignoring the things that I know
Would be living a life of deceit
The perversion of love and the power of hate
Lie deep inside my head
I can't turn to ignorance -
The life of the wordly blind
