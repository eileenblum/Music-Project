Toppling, smashing -
The statues go crashing
And all of your ancient ideals
Your morals we question
Put them to testing
Rules broken you thought were of steel
Scrupleless children
We number in millions
Won't stand for any more of your crummy deals

[Chorus:]
Growing concern
Priests are just rapists
Who worship the dollar
Get hardons from girls at the altar
When in confession
Laugh at your depression
We pay for their
Sins when they falter

[Chorus]

Teachers who profess
We'll make them confess
They've taught us not wisdom, but lies
Burning their textbooks and archaic outlooks
In society's funeral pyre
Senators gain weight as the poor deflate
Starve - as they vote themselves raises
Finger on button, a nuclear glutton
Governing rats caught in mazes
Parents who have raised us
Have not taught but crazed us
Priests who confessed us
Have not cured but depressed us
We'll turn and ignore as we head for the door
Can't take no more
