Killing's my business and business is fine
Money's my interest, life isn't kind
You know you can run but there's nowhere to hide
Payback's a bitch boy
Now you're gonna die
Hand me the contract, I've got no remorse
The more cash I get, the bloodier the worst
You claimed their way out, life is up in flames
How 'bout doin' it my way
Beheaded or slain

[Chorus:]
Hanging or lethal injection
Gas chamber - take a last breath
Firing squad, electrocute, we'll execute!
More than one face of death
Kill 'em all, let God sort 'em out
A soldier of fortune, I'll wipe 'em all out
Having no home, I have no shame
I'll take a life, another victim in pain
Try turning the tables or make it a frame
You can't snuff me out
Because you're my game
You know you're my target
Your time stands still
But no job's too tough
I love to kill
