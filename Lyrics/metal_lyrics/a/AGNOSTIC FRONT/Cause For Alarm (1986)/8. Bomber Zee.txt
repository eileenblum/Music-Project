The end is here per se
Coming near break of day
A bomber prepares for a flight
A blitzkrieg mission tonite

[Chorus:]
Writhing in my dreams
Feeling the painful screams
Torturing my brain
Driving me insane
Bomber up and away
Causing destruction today
Your mission almost complete
Never admitting defeat

[Chorus]

Bomber Zee again tonite
Feeling yourself in flight
Bombing in your mind
Wounding the life inside

[Chorus]
