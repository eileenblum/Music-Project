Time will come when we will pay
There'll be no choice for you to take
World War III won't be a fake
You just can't look the other way

[Chorus:]
Time will come and time will go
You'll learn to live and learn to fight
You'll fight for freedom and fight to die
But you'll never know the reason why
Killing people for their greedness
But unaware of the evilness
Once you're dead there'll be no sorrow
Another one will come to follow
