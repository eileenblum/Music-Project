you see it was drawn easy, my services for a rewarding fee. never thinking then of the hundreds ive hurt. their morals and family so deserted, you see, back then my mind was conned, caught in a pipe dream. understand my path set forth from a struggling background. mom always worked her hardest maintaining her four hounds. scared and afraid that my own child's future was at stake quickly reacting was where i made my biggest mistake. filled with dillusions i fell, i fell deep in my grave carried by deceits devouring waves. i can still remember her nights in tears of rage never giving up even with her life in a ruthless maze. took a harsh lesson for me to understand life. what once was taken granted stabbed with a knife. ive towed along loved ones throughout my experiences, placed them in torturous wars when it all was needless. now and then i failed to think deep clear inside. now and then i rather maintain a modest existence. now and then never again will i barter my freedom.
