here we come to demolish the wall. weve waited years to witness this fall. today we see the truth among curious lies. weve come to seek justice with our own eyes. brick by brick we slave for a life and mortar mix for dimes. we wont allow ourselves to be beat. we wont level this wall of dirty deeds. our rise will be your fall. with force we'll crush your wall. yet it is true how weve been kept in the dark. for our life lacks the beauty of yours. and while the poorer get poorer you could care less because youre set for life with riches. brick after brick weve slaved for your life and mortar mix for nothing but dimes. never again will we ever be beat. nor will we level this wall full of dirty deeds.
