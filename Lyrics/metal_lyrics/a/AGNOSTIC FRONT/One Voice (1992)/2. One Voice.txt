stood strong through right or wrong. fought pain with time and hate. here i stand alone and on fire in a room with a view, a fence with barbwire. today my world ends and so theirs begins. slowly trying to justify comparible sins. i stand here alone and unafraid. ive known in my past ive done worse days. mayy be apart from my dreams and desires yet no man can withhold me from what i most admire. stood strong through right or wrong. fought pain with time and hate. i'll fight when they try to strip me of my rights and wont, i wont accept defeat. i may be down but i will not be beat. one voice. with pride i'll keep on striving till i die and never, never will i black out. the streets remain in heart without a doubt. one voice.
