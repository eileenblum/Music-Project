pure hatred burns deep in my soul because our bond has cracked in time. its taken months for my cool to explode. now whats been damaged remains in my mind. i should have listened to those you called fools for the fool was i to be led blind. youve played your final game, the odds have failed you again. my faith was all to blame. i thought you were a friend id trust till end. these days you learn to trust no one. you must include those closest friends. for what has many of thier promises done? but left you betrayed in the end. i should have listened to those you called fools for the fool was i to be led blind.
