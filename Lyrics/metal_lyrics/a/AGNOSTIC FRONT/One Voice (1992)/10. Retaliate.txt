clenching my fist, holding it in. cant keep up the gaurd, i must break within. ive kept to myself, obeyed my script. now ive violated into a boiling fit. ive givin fair warning, best known to enforce you. you wish to challenge my anger, i wish to prove you untrue. ive set no room for lost untrue memories of how it was then from those who lived. step back new jack. it would have been wiser to have kept you in check. destroying the cahnce of you crossing the line. retaliate, step back new jack. take this advice, retreat off my tracks. build your own life, dont live off my past. for in this future i'll play a new role. excluding freeloaders, ive set a new goal. ive given fair warning, best known to enforce you. you wish to challenge my anger, i wish to prove you untrue. youll never know the load of shit you dug throughout time. i could never ever sleep at night with you in my mind. i dont live a life full of lies. you built your own wall to break. i always had a lot to give and all you did was take. i wont live a life full of lies.
