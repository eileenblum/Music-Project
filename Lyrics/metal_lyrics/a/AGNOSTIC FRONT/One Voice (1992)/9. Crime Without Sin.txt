bless me father for i have sinned. those crimes that i commited, well, i did em again. empty my soul to empower yours. lead me blindly down the path to salvations doors. god in your vanity laws you decree. will give eternal freedom with murder first degree.. look in the mirrir, what would you see. a reflection of your people struck by power and greed. bless me father, for i have sinned. the guidlines for my behavior from above, not within. they say man is his own hell. man created in gods image, that goes for you as well.
