yesterday, my wourld crashed with a blast. that period i chose to bury my past. it tells of time-my back against the wall. back then, a victim of society to maul. spend your life pushing and shoving to climb to the top but youre held by a thread. all the work youve dont goes to waste because in this life you just cant get ahead. again myy world came tumbling hard upon my back. life sifted through my hands like sand through an hourglass. it tells of time i'll never recapture. the grains controlling my life scarred me forever. so this is how it goes-you give with no return. youre always underotwed-cant get ahead.
