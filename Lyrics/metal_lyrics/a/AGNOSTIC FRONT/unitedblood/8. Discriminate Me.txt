Freedom of my life, give it back to me
I wanna live can't you see
Discriminat me, call me a bum
But I'll survive, it's your fault
Freedom of my life, why make it a mess?
Give me a job, I've got to survive
Discriminate me, why can't you help?
Everybody thinks I'm a scum
Freedom of my life, give it back to me!
