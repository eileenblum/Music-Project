I'm so sick of these fucking wars
Rich get richer, poor get poorer
Nothing solved, nothing has changed
Now there's fucking hell to pay
Corporate government poisoned by greed get the fuck out

We are all victims in their game
Destroy the land, make them change
Send the innocent off to war
Don't even know what they're fighting for
Corporate government poisoned by greed get the fuck out
No war, fuck you!
