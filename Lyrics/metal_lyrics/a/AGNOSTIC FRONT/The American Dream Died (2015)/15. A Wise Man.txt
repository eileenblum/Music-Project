He was friend who meant the world to me a man of honour and integrity
Gave me the knowledge that I'll never forget the morals in my life that I set

A wise man once said to me keep your friends close but stay closer to your enemies
A wise man once said to me keep your mouth shut never turn on your family

There's nothing more nothing more important than family
There's nothing more there's nothing more important to a man
Than his family there's nothing more

I'll pray for you, my friend I'll see you on the other side
I will, old friend, I'll see you I'll see you on the other side
