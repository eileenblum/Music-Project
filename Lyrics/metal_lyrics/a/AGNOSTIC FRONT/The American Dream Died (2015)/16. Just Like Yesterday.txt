Death before dishonour our path through history
And just like yesterday undying loyalty
Death before dishonour our path through history
And just like yesterday undying loyalty

Against all odds we stood side by side make something out of nothing, we built this with pride
We fought our battles through all our travels
So many have died from dead end streets of New York City to the Berlin beat
Hardcore world wide this is us, until we die

Looking back on all our glory days CBGB's Sunday matinees
All the friends that we made some faded away
Thirty years later we're still going strong we got the youth to keep it going on
The music the message, we'll have our say it'll never ever fade away
