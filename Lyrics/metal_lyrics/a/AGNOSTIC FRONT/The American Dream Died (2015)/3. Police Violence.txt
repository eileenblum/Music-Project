The guilty police beat the heat over and over again
They abuse their power and break the laws will it ever end?
Police violence FTP criminal cops FTP
Corrupted system FTP no justice fuck the police

Why should we fear the fucking cops supposed to work for us
To serve and protect, that's what we expect but that's not what we get
Police violence FTP criminal cops FTP
Corrupted system FTP no justice fuck the police

They're not above the law throw them in jail, just like the rest
Or they'll continue to taze us shoot us, dispose of us
You fucking pigs broke your oath beat the fuck out of everyone
Wake the fuck up people
