How could you live and know what you've done to an innocent child?
Scum of the earth, you'll die for your crime, it's you I despise
Your actions are vile, you're sick in the mind a creep in disguise
I'll never relate or forgive what you took it's you who I hate
You got what you deserved justice has been served

Revenge is sweet, daggers in deep, from your head to your feet
Can't sympathize, what you did it disgusts you destroyed others lives
Your time has come to face what you've done mercy has begun
You got what you deserved justice has been served
You got what you deserved justice has been served

Social justice justice has been served
Social justice you got what you deserved
