Talk, talk, talk is cheap but we live it
That's the difference, that's what we're bringing
Honesty and loyalty that's unforgiving
This is our movement, not just an image

Let me tell you about our family
A bond so pure, so strong
When I said just us I meant it from my heart
Nothing can stop this passion of ours

This our life our life
This is our scene our scene
This is my passion passion
Worldwide unity
This our life our life
This is our scene our scene
This is my passion passion
Worldwide unity

We still give with all our might and more
We still live this life worth fighting for
Everything and nothing has changed
Still we remain and we never walk alone never walk alone
