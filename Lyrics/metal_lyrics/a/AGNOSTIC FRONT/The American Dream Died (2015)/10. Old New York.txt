New York City the money sucked it dry
Pull the culture from out the streets it's all so gentrified
Alphabet City or down on Forty Second Street
Or the Lower East Side there was violence in the streets

The greatest city of them all but it just don't feel the same
I miss the old New York the tallest buildings in the world
But it just don't look the same I miss the old New York

The Bowery slums turned into fashion boutiques
Where's all the gangs drug dealers and the freaks
The Big Apple has lost its taste
Ten million people trying just to survive this fucking urban waste

The old graffiti trains can't see out the window
Gotta watch your back or you might get jacked
