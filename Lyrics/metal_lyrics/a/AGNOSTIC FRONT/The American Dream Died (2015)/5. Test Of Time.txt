Don't live in the past there's so much that lies ahead
It's moving so fast don't fall behind or you will crash
So live for today but learn from the past
And cherish the moment live life live fast

Tomorrow will never be like yesterday today we stand the test of time
Into the future, the more and more we grow the test of time
This is not about yesterday, it's the ground that now you hold the test of time
Living in the past, you're going to fall behind the test of time
We're moving forward, we won't get left behind the test of time
The test of time the test of time the test of time

So you're in denial you never cared so stop your lies
And fuck what you done you lost the drive and your passion
Still holding on you haven't done nothing since then
You're not fooling no one can't obtain what you begun
