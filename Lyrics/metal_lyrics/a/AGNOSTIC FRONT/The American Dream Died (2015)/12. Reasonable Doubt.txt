The mainstream media lies through their teeth the corporations control the government
They're making moves while the city sleeps I'll never trust them again
I don't give a fuck about what you say to me
I don't give a fuck about what you think of me

I have a right to ask and a right to know it's up to us to take that step
The system's broke and it's starting to choke and that's the fucking truth of it
I don't give a fuck about what they say to me
I don't give a fuck about what they think of me

Because power to the people, fight back
Out in the streets trying to make a change
We're not going to settle for this shit again no way
