Attack you played the fool
Attack no respect for you

We don't like your kind
No honour, no pride

Attack nothing you can do
Attack you broke the golden rule

You're losing face, you got no backbone
No love for you, you proved you're fake
Put yourself in this position never give only take
We will attack attack we will attack
