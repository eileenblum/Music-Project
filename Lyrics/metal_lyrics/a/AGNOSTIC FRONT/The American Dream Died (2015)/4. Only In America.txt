Risk their lives for us all and the government lets them fall
No help at the VA when will they have their say?
Only in America our veterans deprived
Only in America the soldiers left to die

Sent to fight in a foreign land come home with nothing in hand
Homeless with nowhere to go it's unbelievable
Only in America our veterans denied
Only in America the soldiers left behind
Only in America our veterans deprived
Only in America the soldiers left to die

Land of the free, home of the brave
They fought for freedom but now they're treated just like slaves
Land of the free, home of the brave
They fought for freedom but now they're treated just like slaves
Only in America only in America
