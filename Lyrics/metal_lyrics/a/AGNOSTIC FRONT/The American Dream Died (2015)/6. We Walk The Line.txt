I speak my mind if I don't like what I see
Fight to survive, because I come from the streets
Wherever I'm at I'm not far from home
When the times get tough I know I'm not alone
We walk the line

As time goes by at the end of the day
We lived our life, because we chose this way
I was never the kind just to follow the blind
Didn't like what I saw so I left it behind 
We walk the line
