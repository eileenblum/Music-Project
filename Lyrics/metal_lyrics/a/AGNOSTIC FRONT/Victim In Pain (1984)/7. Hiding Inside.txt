Hiding your feelings &amp; yourself inside
Because you're afraid to express them
And lose your pride
But why try to be someone you're just not
Why keep hiding, letting the real you rot

Yes, you're afraid to get caught off gaurd
Because you don't know how they'll think
(Is he 'soft' or 'hard')
But does it really matter, does it really bother you?
To try to be someone else, a fool leading
Yourself on to (a life that's not for you)

Can't you act and be yourself
Not another character in a hardcore handbook
Well, we don't need anymore great american heroes
But real people being themselves, not weirdos
