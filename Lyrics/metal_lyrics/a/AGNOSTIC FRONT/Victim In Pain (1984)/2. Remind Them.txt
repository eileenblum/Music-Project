They hate us, we'll hate them
They deny us, we'll defy them
They ignore us, we'll remind them
They taught us to hate and lie
To obey them and look into their selfish eyes

Reject the system and their games
The games they play to rise above
Laws they make, rules they could shove
Ideals to take over our minds
Unjustified greed to rule our lives
Their desire to overpower and conquer
To succeed for their own kind

Reject their authority, be aware of their schism
We won't adjust to their society
Their capitalistic from of prison
Remind them they taught us to lie
Remind them they've corrupted our lives
