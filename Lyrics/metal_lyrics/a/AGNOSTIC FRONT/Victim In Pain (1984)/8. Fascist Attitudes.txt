Why should you go around bashing one another
If they look or think different, why let it bother
Everyones got their own style, their own thoughts
Don't let it bother you, don't let it get caught
Your fascist attitudes - we need the least
With a scene that's fighting for unity &amp; peace
Don't need more anger; no more danger
Don't need to hate; stop before it's too late
Learning how to respect each other is a must
So why start a war of anger &amp; danger among us
It's time to grow out of your nazi hypocrism
When you really don't want part of a fucked up system
