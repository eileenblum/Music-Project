Spending your life dreaming of rich fantasies
Come back from your dreams and face reality
You think you've got everything, but really have nothing
It's just too much pressure and your mind is busting
Watch out don't make a mistake
You'll lose your money, it's poverty's stake
Society sucker - you've earned your name
Society sucker - it's just your game
