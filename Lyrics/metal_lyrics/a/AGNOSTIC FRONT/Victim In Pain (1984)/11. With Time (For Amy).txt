What have I done, why am I hated
Everything has just begun to be updated
Have I been aware of my friends
Or just unfair of myself and of my pride
Should I change for my best
Or should I live my life in a mess
I'm the one who's lost inside
But you're the one I can't find

Feel confused and lonely at this moment
But maybe with some time, everything will
Pile off my mind
