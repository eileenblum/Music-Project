For my family for my friends
for those that we've lost I sing
this is a message, this is for you
never forget the lower east side crew!

I remember all times we spent
and all that we went through
down on avenue A
the year was 1982!

HARDCORE! New York City!
NEW YORK!
that's how we live it!

we always stuck together
we always had something to prove
we gave birth to a movement
this is for the old school and the new!

HARDCORE! New York City!
NEW YORK!
that's how we live it!
