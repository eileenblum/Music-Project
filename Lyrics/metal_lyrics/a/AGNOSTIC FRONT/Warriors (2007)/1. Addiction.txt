I look in your eyes
I see through your disguise
You're killing yourself
Can't hide behind your lies

DON'T!
FUCK UP YOUR LIFE!
IT'S OUT OF CONTROL!
NOW YOUR A VICTIM!!
YOUR LOSING YOUR SOUL!
KILLING YOURSELF!
POISON YOUR MIND!
NOW YOUR RUNNING OUT OF TIME!
I'VE WATCHED YOU FADE AWAY!
HAVE YOU LOST SIGHT!
OF THE DREAMS OF YESTERDAY!

Time to open your eyes
Cause you must realize
You, your not the same
Your the only one to blame

DON'T!
FUCK UP YOUR LIFE!
ITS OUT OF CONTROL!
YOUR NOT A VICTIM!
YOUR LOSING YOUR SOUL!
KILLING YOURSELF!
POISON YOUR MIND!
AND YOUR RUNNING OUT OF TIME!
I'VE WATCHED YOU FADE AWAY!
HAVE YOU LOST SIGHT!
OF THE TRUTHS OF YESTERDAY!
DOES IT ALL MEAN NOTHING?!

SAVE YOURSELF!
FROM THIS
ADDICTION!!!

FUCK THIS!
ADDICTION!!!
