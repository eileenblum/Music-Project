I've seen them come
Seen them go
I sit back and wonder
Will they ever know
About the trials
Of this life that we've led
All the sacrifices made

Warriors! - Warriors
Through and through!
Warriors!

Some were made
To live by this code
Others fold
Under the pressure
I'm not the judge, or the jury
But our fury is fed
By blood and sweat
The battle wages on
in every way, everyday!
We fight the good fight
There's no retreat
We never accept defeat

Warriors! - Warriors
through and through!
Warriors! - for life!
Warriors! - We're Warriors
through and through!
Warriors to the death!

A Warriors code
Built by blood and sweat
A Warriors vow
To fight until the end
In life! or Death!
Never forget the Warriors!
Warriors!

Warriors! - Warriors
through and through!
Warriors! - for life!
Warriors! - We're Warriors
through and through!
Warriors to the death!
