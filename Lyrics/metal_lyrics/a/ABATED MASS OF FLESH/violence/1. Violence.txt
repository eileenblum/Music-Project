Violence 

Another way to hate
Another way to kill
We donât see eye to eye
We do not think the same
And Iâll watch my back
From the ones that feed on life

So eager to strike you down
Wanting you to feel the pain
I canât believe we breathe the same air
God help me contain this rage

Your rotting away
Get on your feet

How does it feel to rob such virtue
Does it make you feel 
Larger than yourself
Trying to take our 
Our enduring hope
And now your rotting away
Embrace the Love within
There is still time for you
There is still time
