Blood and sweat drip down
Battered and bruised tissue swelling
Skin hanging in strips
Scalp pierced with thorns
Weary and worn
Crushing weight upon him
Trail of blood leads to the site
Arms stretched out as nails enter his wrists
Binding him to wood
Ghastly form of execution
Last gasp unto deliverance
The gift for all to receive
We are all bought by blood
Who will accept the eternal?
