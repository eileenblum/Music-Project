Behold the Deathcrusher
The armageddon
The apocalypse
The crown is upon his head
Who can come against
Who can withstand
At his feet, all will confess
Human hands cannot corrupt
Human tongues cannot defile
In his midst, nothing is hidden
His existence covers the lands
His voice reaches the depths
The crown is upon his head
And the keys are in his hand
Who can come against
Who can withstand
At his feet all will bow
At his feet all will confess
JESUS CHRIST IS LORD
