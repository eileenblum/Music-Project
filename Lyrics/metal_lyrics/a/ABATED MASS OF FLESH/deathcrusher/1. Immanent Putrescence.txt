Fragments of who I was are now exposed before me
Offering decay
Offering defeat
To return to the grave/to return as a slave
Mangled in the likeness
Of self inflicted crisis
Feeding on the righteous
Spreading like a virus
Obstruction of progression
Festering on the soul
Consuming acquisition
Loss of all control
Fragments of who I was are now exposed before me
I will not decay
Never suffer defeat
Ripped, torn discrete
Buried six feet deep
