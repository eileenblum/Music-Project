Power uncontained
Presence absolute
Bringer of true justice
Whose name is rebirth
Rejecter of the grave
His mouth speaks truth
He shapes the mountains and directs the winds
From the dawning of time
He always was
Author of light
Bringing forth existence
Fortress of excellence
Dwelling among men
Creating with his might
Destroying with his will
Just and rightfully so
His love is boundless
His existence is eternal
