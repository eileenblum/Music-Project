Maybe you can hear the screaming
The screams of self punishment
The hollow cries from this repetitive condition
Maybe you can see the way
The way their actions became their fall
And took itâs toll upon the innocent
Maybe you can say
Say this life was more than cheap imitation
Rubble from a tower that once stood tall
Lie in wait for the hands of itâs builder
Restoration is the name I scream
Hindering the darkness at bay
I wait patiently for this revival call
To diminish the statues made in my name
