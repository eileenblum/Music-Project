"God my God, why have you forsaken me? 
Far from my deliverance and the words of my groaning"
Empower me
Rip the impurities from my heart
Iâm listening to the songs you sing over me
Mighty you are, shaker of the earth
Conduct us in your ways
Define us by your truth
Who shall call upon your name
Who shall see redemption this day
The path I chose was of faith and victory
