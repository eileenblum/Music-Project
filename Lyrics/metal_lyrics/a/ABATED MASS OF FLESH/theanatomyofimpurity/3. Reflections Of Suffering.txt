I see this man hanging on the cross
Naked and cold
As his blood pours out 
I stare in wonder
Is this a reflection of my suffering?
Could such be done for a man so vile?
So much blood, so much flesh
Disfigured beyond our likeness 
Who could endure this? 
As suffocation settled in
He stared me in the eyes
And cried forgiveness 
Over all, over me  
Upon his last breath
I felt the flames of hell
Awestruck, I fell to the ground
In submission from who I was 
And in that moment, defined through death
I knew that man
