Day by day I tell myself I am a failure
I mock Your words
I spit in Your face
You forgive me
How can You forgive me when I canât forgive myself?
I was once a careless man 
Using You for comfort not listening to Your word
I abused You
I tremble at Your word with holy expectation
Change me
Help me make a difference, in my generation
Help my generation help the generation
Your love is greater than all
No matter the sin, no matter the fall
Your possibilities are beyond us all
