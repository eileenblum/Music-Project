As days fall behind me 
Submissive perceptions relay my failure
Mockery resides in Your courts 
From the mouth that spat in Your face
Yet, forgiveness lit the flame
Mercy Youâve shown is mercy unknown
Hiding in the shadow of an opulent grave
Careless was this man
Illusive to the gathered 
Abusive with Your favor
Oblivious to Your word
Trembling lies at 
The foothill of glory 
From the generation 
Entrenched with change 
Change me
Your love surpasses the collapse of every man
