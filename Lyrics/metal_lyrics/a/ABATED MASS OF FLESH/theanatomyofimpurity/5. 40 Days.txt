Iâve seen the deepest parts of me
Stripped away and contorted by sin
Iâve seen the joy and security fade
Felt the breath of lucifer down my neck
Dwelling in mortal decay
Choked on the lie
For far too long
Resistance is lost
In the lies of your deception
Liberated in the Blood
Iâm liberated in the Blood
