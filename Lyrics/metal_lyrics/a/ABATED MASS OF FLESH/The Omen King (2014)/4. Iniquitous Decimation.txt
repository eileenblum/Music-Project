Comprehension fades
In the wake of vile desecration
In a Godless age
Clinging to a fallen nation
Rape, murder, genocide
Contorting my beliefs
Bloodbath from every side
Restless internal grief
Watch the earth decay into the cesspool of our decline
The human race, scattered astray as bombs decorate the skyline
Sheppard of the lost
Source of supreme understanding/Bearer of the cross
Back to the notion of living
Comprehension fades
In the wake of vile desecration
In a Godless age
Clinging to a fallen nation
Restoration waits on the hands of declaration
The coming of a King
Construing the base of fixation
