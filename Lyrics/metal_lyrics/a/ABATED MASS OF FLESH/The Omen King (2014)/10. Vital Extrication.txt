Move through the day
You're worth everything
Everything to Him
Look the world in the eyes
No turning back
No going back
Holy is the Lamb
Giver of new life
Secured in 
The blood of Christ
Submit this dead flesh
Release all control 
Made right in
His sight
All will be made new
Your past will haunt you
He will protect you
The world's falling apart around you 
But you have the strength
It surrounds you
Your past will haunt you 
He will protect you
Your past
(Past) will haunt you
He will
(Will) protect you
Move through the day
You're worth everything
Everything to Him
Look the world in the eyes
No turning back
No going back
Holy is the Lamb
Giver of new life
Secured in 
The blood of Christ
Submit this dead flesh
Release all control 
Made right in
His sight
All will be made new
You're not the same as yesterday
