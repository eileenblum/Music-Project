How do You see me through Your eyes
Are You ashamed of me
They say You suffered on the cross
And paid my penalty
Circumstances, second chances
I live my life on repeat
If You re the God that they say You are
Can Your hand reach me
In a time of my emptiness
Through the faults of my wickedness
For the lack of my gratefulness
Can You make it stop
I saw You suffer on the cross that night
As I laughed and mocked the sight
I saw the flesh ripped from Your back
I joined the masses with a heart so black
Was the weeping and the grieving
Intended for me
I am a killer of the innocent
A growing plague, a pestilence
I am the thorn that chokes the seed
The spiteful crown that made You bleed
When the ground consumes this waste
Remember me in the holy place
I saw You suffer on the cross that night
As I laughed and mocked the sight
I saw the flesh ripped from Your back
I joined the masses with a heart so black
