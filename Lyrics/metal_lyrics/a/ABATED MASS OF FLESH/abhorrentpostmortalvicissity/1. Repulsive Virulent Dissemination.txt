Awaken to this dismay 
This is your serinity now 
An ill-chosen fate 
You've peeled your face away 
Wishing to remember 
What it looked like 
No longer recognizing 
Forever agonizing 
Repetitive infectious disease 
Such a cruel attachement 
Pain is all you will know 
Hammered down 
You kill yourself again 
It has taken your soul once more 
Incisions, scars and scabs 
Nostalgic recollections 
Of a life once dead 
How impartial 
Adoring relics of the damned 
Addictive pain 
Feeding on infected flesh 
Your personal tragedy 
Relived each day 
Made disposable 
Forshadowing the same results 
You've shattered the mirror 
Bleeding you pieced it together 
But it's not the same 
Then again, it never is 
Can you reach again 
Will your perspective change 
And see the New Dawn 
Fountains of life 
Drained from thy flesh 
All can drink 
Those who crave 
Despair forsaken 
Concieved once more 
In the wake from ridden tombs
