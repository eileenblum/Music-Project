Staring at these ceiling tiles 
âOh God make it stopâ 
This syringe a foreign affliction 
Machines of detection 
Repeating observations 
Mind prison, life ridden 
Where is my comfort found? 
Grave bound in pale worship 
An end stapled in sight 
But time revealed, through trials healed 
The glory of Your saving light 
Misery calling false fate 
Awakened in deception 
Watching it all fall apart 
Fixed on this condition 
Iâm giving up, I gave it up 
Where is my comfort found? 
Grave bound in pale worship 
An end stapled in sight 
But time revealed, through trials healed 
The glory of your saving light 
There's no escape from myself 
Within this hell I have made 
Assumptions and conclusions 
Led to atrocious awakenings 
Misery calling false fate 
Awakened in deception 
Watching it all fall apart 
Fixed on this condition 
Iâm giving up, I gave it up 
Where is my comfort found?
