Blessings in ruin 
All I do is count 
Only to find myself in shards of disgust 
The sorrow cannot cut any deeper 
The wounds could not heal any slower 
Self inflicted or cursed from above 
Questions cannot answer themselves 
The meaning in patience 
Am I willing to seek 
These perceptions 
Twisted into a false reality 
To be attached is to be 
Anxiously torn apart 
A part of me is forgotten 
As my trust quickly erodes 
Into the comfort 
Of silence once more 
Feeble words fall from my lips 
Reflections of my Savior 
Covered in the dust 
Of my tribulation 
How far must I reach 
To be in Your arms again 
A pain unending, manifested inside 
Serenity, this cold darkness 
Time wastes away 
Burying another part of me 
Infectiously buried beneath 
In shallow darkness, I hear Your voice 
Beyond the dirt, "No son forgotten" 
How I wait for seas to calm, stability 
Can I wait for You to come, humility
