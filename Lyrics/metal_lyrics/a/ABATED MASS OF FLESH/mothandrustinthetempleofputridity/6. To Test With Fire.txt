My God where do You want me?
Where will You take me Lord?
Teach me to fulfill the plan You have for me
For You allow all things to grow
I have rejected Your ways
To pursue my own
And it's left me with hopeless feelings
Show me my efforts are worthy
Test me with fire Lord
Bring me into the light

[1 Corinthians 3:7, 13]
