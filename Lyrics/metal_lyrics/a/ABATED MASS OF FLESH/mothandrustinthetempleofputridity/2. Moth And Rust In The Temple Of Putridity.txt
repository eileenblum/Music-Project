Only through my trial
I have come to see the selfishness within me
To be partial with my King and favor myself
How long Lord will I let this continue?
The evil desires within me
Thank You for taking this to the cross
For giving Yourself
So I don't have to live in the perception of depravity

[James 2:1-4, Galatians 1:4]
