How can You deny Yourself as good?
Humble Father I worship You
I'd sacrifice all I am
To spend one minute
In Your presence
I am a fool
Clinging to materials
With a sense of pride
I am not worthy Lord
My hunger for vision and proof
Reveals the impatient man I am
To see Your flesh
And hear Your voice
Breathe on me Lord
I welcome Your Spirit

[Mark 10:18-30, John 20:25-29]
