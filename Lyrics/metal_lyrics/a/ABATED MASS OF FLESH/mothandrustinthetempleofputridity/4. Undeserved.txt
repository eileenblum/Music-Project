Who will save me from
The beast I've become?
Who will take away
The shame within me?
I am filth
But there is One
Who made me clean
This body is death
His Spirit is life
I am made whole
Through His righteousness
I have accepted the Father
And the Father sees me clean
Praise You Jesus for Your hand
In this raging sea

[Romans 7:24-25, Romans 8:10]
