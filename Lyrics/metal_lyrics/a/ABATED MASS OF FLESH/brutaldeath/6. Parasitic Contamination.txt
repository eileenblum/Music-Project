A familiar place
A cold embrace
We are so hungry
We are so hungry
Deprived from the frame of your existence
Suffocating on deceit
Crawling through the shards of disbelief
Parting the scars of ambitious desire
Infecting to decomposition
This is your diet of desolation
The substance that blinds
To live this is to fear this
To fear this is to die
Alleviation declines
You re the contagion
Conscience seeks chasing a savior
Finding godless behavior
