Rape the mind
Infect the spirit
With images bent on destruction
Fulfill the fantasies of the flesh
Bowing to its instruction
Lead the slaves to an endless path of self indulgent devotion
Tear away the search for release
To progress in Godly notions
This is the incarceration
From the god of putrefaction
Designed to defile
Free the mind
Release the spirit from the trait of atrocious decline
Deny the devotion of the flesh
Refusal to be confined
How can you starve the dying when the substance is decay
How can you feed the living
With your instrument of dismay
