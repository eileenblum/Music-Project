For too long I ve choked on the lies and the devious schemes you conduct
Distortion of the focal path
Waiting for the aftermath
Breathing in the will to deconstruct
Justification
The foundation you can never reach
Sanctification
The departure from the death you preach
Glorification
Prohibition of your ominous trait
Eradication
From His wrath you will never escape
Flee
Buried beneath the flesh of the earth
There is no escape
Carried to hell
Blazed, scorching rebirth
There is no escape
