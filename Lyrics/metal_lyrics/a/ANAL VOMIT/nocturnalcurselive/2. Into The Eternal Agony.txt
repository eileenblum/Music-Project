You're sinking in your own anguish
Suffering invades you even more
Claiming mercy will not help
Into the eternal agony
Into the eternal agony
Fear, fright, imaginary visions
Are part of your innerself
Under the cruelty and hate
That possesses you
Live your damn hell
Live your damn hell
Looking for an exit that you can't find
It's you fate you have trace
In pain and anguish
Perdition, Affliction, Desolation, Destruction!!! 

Into the etenal agony

You're condemned to suffer
You're marked to die
You're trapped no escape
Consumed till the end

Living damn hell!!!
