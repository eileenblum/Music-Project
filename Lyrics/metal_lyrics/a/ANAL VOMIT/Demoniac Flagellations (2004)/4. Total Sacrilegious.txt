Bringers of horror attack without mercy
hidden in the sombers of cemetery
Breacking the tombs by desecration
Before yells of undead and black superstitions...

The mortuary is destroyed by grave violators
When the silence of the night is witching
The skeletons are now dust and ashes
And the rest are profanated till end...

Screams: from the abyss angels
Death: total sacrilegious!
Plegaries: from the zombies voices
Rules: total sacrilegious!

Eyes of the evil spell in the night
Decaying corpses and skulls are banished
Rise from the past to dwell among us
Hauting souls are captured to be blackened and released...

Sacrilegious
Sacrilegious
Sacrilegious
Sacrilegious!!!
