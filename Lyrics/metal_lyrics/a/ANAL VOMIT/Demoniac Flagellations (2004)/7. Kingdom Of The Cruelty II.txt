You are cold, without soul
Sweat, scream, cry and bleed...
You are cold, without soul
Sweat, scream, cry and bleed...

[Chorus:]
Kingdom of the Cruelty
Kingdom of the Cruelty
Kingdom of the Cruelty
Kingdom of the Cruelty!

Come and enter my room
Where the beast reigns
I was created in sin
And for sin I own...

Kingdom of the sin
Kingdom of the feast...
Kingdom of the sin
Kingdom of the feast...

Hymn to the filth
Hymn to the filth...fuck you!!!

Kingdom of the sin
Kingdom of the feast...
Kingdom of the sin
Kingdom of the feast...

Night of Damnation!!!

Sex and blood
Sex and blood
Sex and blood...adoration!

Sex and blood
Sex and blood
Sex and blood...worship!
