[Music Palubicki; Lyrics Helmkamp]

Cut off your nose to spite your face
You cannot deny your natural desires
Sell the soul away parade into oblivion
Depravity transgress swallow the fear
Filth decay pollute the conscience
From violence was creation derived
Winds of change cannot awake paralyzed minds
Their choking utterances asphixiated

ENVENOMED
Envenomed

Mankind innate as one
Embracing the heart within himself
Machine of war dwells beneath the flesh
Enraged possessed by hell
Willing chaos self-destruction
The nihilist awakes to dawn
Entropic predatory force
Abort this putrid corpse

[Chorus]

Copulate - decimate
Kings shall spawn from the soiled corpses
Crematory reign
Masturbate - desecrate
Seed of hate spilled forth
Absolute pain

Perversity cancerous devouring minds
The black miasma intrigues me
Nefarious lurid erotic deeds
Drown in malevolent dreaming
Rancid stench death foreboding
interrupts the futile thought of life
Curse eviscerate damnation
Rigor mortis silences any outburst
