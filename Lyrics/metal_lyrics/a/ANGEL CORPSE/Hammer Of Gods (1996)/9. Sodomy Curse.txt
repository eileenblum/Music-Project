[Music Palubicki; Lyrics Helmkamp]

Garden of earthly delights is mounting flames
We are burning our way to paradise

The lust for vengeance shall not despair
Blood and sperm - agony
War declared - now hear this

Sodomy curse

Fertile semen corrupted to vile seed
Obelisk of swollen beauty
Desperate ablution
Pollution

[chorus]

Disgrace wept bitter tears
Spit wipes away but what of the shame

[chorus]

Sodomy
