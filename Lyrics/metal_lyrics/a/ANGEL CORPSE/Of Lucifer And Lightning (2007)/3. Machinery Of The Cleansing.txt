The maps of old are broken here
In spirit and in flesh
Excise the notions of obeisance
And oblivion from the body, mind, soul
Eclipse the claws of indoctrination
Smash the foes of the faustian flam
The lightning leaps upon my brow
Horned helm black infernal names

Hail the temple of the self - triumphant
Hail the elite breed of man
Unvanquished heathendom paramount
Crush the contagion of Christendom
For this iron folk spearheads destiny
Cursing dispatching that which pollutes
March under command of the conquering
Strike with stalwart vengeance absolute

Antichrist vanguard advance
Spilling the blood of matyrs and slaves
Credo decimatus
Machinery of the cleansing

Decay and degradation dwell amongst us
Machinery of the cleansing
Sepsism swells the flock obscene
Machinery of the cleansing...

Antichrist vanguard advance
Spilling the blood of matyrs and slaves
Credo decimatus
Machinery of the cleansing

The maps of old are broken here
In spirit and in flesh
Excise the notions of obeisance
And oblivion from the body, mind, soul
For this iron folk spearheads destiny
Cursing dispatching that which pollutes
March under command of the conquering
Strike with stalwart vengeance absolute

Machinery of the cleansing...
