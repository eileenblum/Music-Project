Antichrist!

Hail Blasphemy Geared for battle
This call to arms, wrath and war
Victory or death is on the march
Antichrist allegiance the only law

Assail the gates of hypocrisy
Wield the weapons of Antichrist
Destroy ideologies of excrement
Antichrist Vanguard

Heretic pact attack of steel
Eradication of false culture
Liquidation of the slave creed
Annihilation - vae victis

Like a sun drenched black with angel's blood
My hate burns fierce and proud
My heart and kind seek retribution
And the sight of human vermin crucified

Antichrist!

King of slaves
Plains of the impaled
Blood stained temples
Horizons ablaze
Ensanguined blades of execration
Blackened fields of decimation

Wield the weapons of Antichrist [x2]
Destroy ideologies of excrement

Hail Blasphemy Geared for battle
This call to arms, wrath and war
Victory or death is on the march
Antichrist allegiance the only law

Annihilation - vae victis

Like a sun drenched black with angel's blood
My hate burns fierce and proud
My heart and kind seek retribution
And the sight of human vermin crucified
