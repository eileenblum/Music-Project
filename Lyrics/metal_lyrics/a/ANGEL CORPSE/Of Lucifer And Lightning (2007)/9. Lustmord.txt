In the name of nihilism
I watch her face turning blue
Porcelain demeanor under cellophane
Hate unleashed depravity and pain

Her screams are charnel house symphonies
Death chamber dirges grinding bones to dust
I believe in desecration
Lustmord

Auto asphyx self stimulation
Weltering in torment flesh and terror
With every ecstasy aflame alive
Struggles subside she resigns to die
Rigor mortis cold flesh stiffening
Post mortem desecration
Carving the flesh raping angel's souls
Defile disembowel dissection

Mutilate triumphant shibari in blood
Piano wire ligature body disfigured
Pleasures horrendous grim lost gasps
Torn genitalia garotted suspended

Danse macabre I smash forbidden tombs
To manifest my sadism my morbid fantasies
Evoking obscene wills in the cemetery of my mind
To torture murder rape to purge humanity

I believe in desecration
Lustmord

In the name of nihilism
I watch her face turning blue
Porcelain demeanor under cellophane
Hate unleashed depravity and pain
Decimation prowling violating
Any open window any open house
Lacerating masturbating suffocating
Black seed of hate spills from her mouth...
