You don't know why
But I tell you how my mother felt
When you were drunk
And fucked all the other girls
You don't know why

I remind you
Time where I felt alone
Nobody cared
I was a child in your stupid mind
So all the bad things help you remind

I wish that Dad is dead
No more forgiveness to you, my friend
I wish that Dad is dead

Mother deceased from the poison of your kind
I never forget
I never forget
I never forget
Sweet dreams to you, my friend
The demon comes from the right
Throws out your light
Throws out your light

I wish that Dad is dead
No more forgiveness to you, my friend
I wish that Dad is dead
No more forgiveness to you, my friend
I wish that Dad is dead

I wish that Dad is dead

I wish that Dad is dead
No more forgiveness to you, my friend
I wish that Dad is dead
No more forgiveness to you, my friend
