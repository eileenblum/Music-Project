I'll take you to paradise

I'll take you to paradise
Close your eyes, you will feel no pain
Take my hand, you will be paralyzed
My hands on your neck, down in the rain
Down in the rain

Your eyes don't see 
What you mean to me
So blind....help me 
I'm falling, complete

I'll take you to paradise
I'll take you to paradise
Your eyes don't see 
What you mean to me
So blind...help me 
I'm falling, complete
