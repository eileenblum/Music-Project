When the three planets have an eclipse, a black hole like a door is open.
Evil comes, spreading terror and chaos.
The ultimate evil.
Evil comes... evil comes.

Open the gate of hell

The ultimate evil

Open the gate of hell
Open the gate of hell
Open the gate of hell

Ultimate evil
The ultimate evil

Time goes by
Relationships, they die
No more contracts to force the world

In mind I keep human words of hope and loyality
My strenght to carry on will disappear

Open the gate of hell
Open the gate of hell
Open the gate of hell

The ultimate evil
The ultimate evil

Tonight I keep human words of hope and loyality
My strenght to carry on will disappear

Open the gate of hell
Open the gate of hell
Open the gate of hell

The ultimate evil
