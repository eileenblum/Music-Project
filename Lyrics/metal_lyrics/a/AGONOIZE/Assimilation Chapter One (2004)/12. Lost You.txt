I don't hear the words you say
I don't know what you're talking about
What you're talking about

I lost you in time
It's nothing to wait

But now I feel that nothing
Is darker than love

But now I feel that nothing
Is darker than love

Blind eyes are looking back
Want to kiss your lovely neck
Lovely neck
Looking at you in my deepest dream
Seen that reality
I think about you and me
I wonder how it could be

But now I feel that nothing
Is darker than love
