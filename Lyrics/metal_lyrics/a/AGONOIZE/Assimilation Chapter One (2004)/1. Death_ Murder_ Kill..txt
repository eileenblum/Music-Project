I see the blood on the floor
I touch your naked skin
My spirit can smell your fear
Your scream are made silent

Cut down, left to rotten
Licking your throat
Sucking your anus
Eating your brain
slash, bash, slash
I still believe in this society

Genocide

Death, murder, kill
Kill in cold blood
Death, murder, kill
Your dead eyes wide open

Homicide
