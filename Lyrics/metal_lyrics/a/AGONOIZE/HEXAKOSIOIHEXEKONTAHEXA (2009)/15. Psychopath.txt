Psychopath

She's all around, by day and by night
She's all around and there's no place to hide
She's all around, she's stalking you down
She's all around, you'll never walk alone

And when you turn, she might be there
So let's get burned, Be sure it's her
When you take what you need, she's next to you 
When you're asleep, she's watching over you

Psychopath
She's just a Psychopath

Psychopath,
No one to adore
A man-eating whore

She's just a psychopath
???
A pain in the ass

She's all around, every minute of the day
She's all around, so don't make her stay
She's all around, she's not like the rest
She's all around, she's like the kiss of death
She's all around, one step ahead
She's all around, until you drop dead
She's all around, of every mistake you make
She's all around, of every breath you will take
