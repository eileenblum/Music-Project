Then she told me What Surprise!
Now I feel like sacrifice
Feelings change, hitten by hate,
No way back, now it's to late.

She's the Devil with a black suit on.
All the Time I thought I was wrong.
A walking death, empty inside.
Nothing is left, only black and white.

Now I hate you! I fucking hate you!
Can't you see that I've changed?

Now I hate you! I fucking hate you!
That's when Love turns to hate.

Now I hate you! I fucking hate you!
Can't you see that I've changed?

Now I hate you! I fucking hate you!
That's when Love turns to hate.

Love turns to hate.
Love turns to hate.
Love turns to hate.

By the look into her eyes.
I feel fucking hypnotized.
She can bring you, to your knees.
Make you beggin Please Please Please!

She's got the look,
She's got the look,
She's got the look, that kills.

She's got the look,
She's got the look,
She's got the look, that kills me.

She's got the look,
She's got the look,
She's got the look, that kills.

She's got the look,
She's got the look,
She's got the look, that kills me.

Now I hate you! I fucking hate you!
Can't you see that I've changed?

Now I hate you! I fucking hate you!
That's when Love turns to hate.

Now I hate you! I fucking hate you!
Can't you see that I've changed?

Now I hate you! I fucking hate you!
That's when Love turns to hate.

Love turns to hate.
Love turns to hate.
Love turns to hate.

She's just a, Pornomagcenterfold!
She's just a, Pornomagcenterfold!
She's just a, Pornomagcenterfold!
She's just a, Pornomagcenterfold!
