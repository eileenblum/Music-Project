I took a trip through the whole Babylon
I struggle salvation's burn
On the arms of Rion

My body is my belt for you
My private war
And all I need

I bestow on the way to extasy
I lost my life for eternity
I bestow on the way to extasy
I lost my life for eternity

Cause I can see the end was so close to me

My body is my belt for you
My private war and all I need...
I bestow on the way to extasy
I lost my life for eternity
I bestow on the way to extasy
I lost my life for eternity

Cause I can see the end was so close to me
