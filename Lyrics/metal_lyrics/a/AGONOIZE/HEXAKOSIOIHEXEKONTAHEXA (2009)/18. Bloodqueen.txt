She came at night
don't know where she came from

She disappeared like strait out of hell

Inhuman eyes the ones that could kill

HeÂ´s made of flesh, waiting for the feast!

She came at night...
And she want revenge

Be Aware!
She doesnÂ´t take prisoners

She the one youâve been waiting for
Now heaven can wait...

Make me bad!

She the one with the devilish eyes!
She so cruel and full of surprise

She sucks you dry, but you cannot deny
She a bloodqueen!

She the one to bring you down to your knees
She makes you scream, and begging for release

You canât resist, her bittersweet kiss..
She a bloodqueen!

Bite me, suck me dry!
Bite me, suck me dry!

She came at night
don't know where she came from

A dark angel
A holy and a whore

She the one that men would kill for
Get on your knees and become her pray!

She the one with the devilish eyes!
She so cruel and full of surprise

She sucks you dry, but you cannot deny
She a bloodqueen!

She the one to bring you down to your knees
She makes you scream, and begging for release

You canât resist, her bittersweet kiss..
She a bloodqueen!

Bite me, suck me dry!
Bite me, suck me dry!

She the one with the devilish eyes!
She so cruel and full of surprise

She sucks you dry, but you cannot deny
She a bloodqueen!

She the one to bring you down to your knees
She makes you scream, and begging for release

You canât resist, her bittersweet kiss..
She a bloodqueen!

Bite me, suck me dry!
Bite me, suck me dry!
