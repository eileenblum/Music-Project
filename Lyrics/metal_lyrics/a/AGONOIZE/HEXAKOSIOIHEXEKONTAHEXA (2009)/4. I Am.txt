Here I am 
Like a fist in your face
Here I am
I rape you disgrace
Here I am
I lost control
Here I am
I'll make you all
Here I am
The good has the bad
Here I am
Eyes gone so mad
Here I am
Never asleep
Here I am
To make you complete

I have devil inside
And I came through Divine
The whole that we made
Will drive you insane
Here I am
Here I am

The dark side of me I never wanted to be
The first and the last my day of my trust
Here I am
Here I am

Here I...

Here I am
The black has the white
Here I am
The dark has the light
Here I am
The love has the hate
Here I am
You've opened your faith
Here I am
A noise making sound
Here I am
It came with all the crowd
Here I am
The beggining has the end
Here I am
The dream built on sand

I have devil inside
And I came through Divine
The whole that we made
Will drive you insane
Here I am
Here I am

The dark side of me I never wanted to be
The first and the last my day of my trust
Here I am
Here I am
Here I...
Here I am
