I hate you all
I hate you all
I don't get asked about you
I don't get asked about you

I can't describe
What's going on with me
Something inside
Sets my anger free
The feelings now
Born out of spite
You are at war
A thorn in my side

I cannot change
My fucking part of you
It's all about
With you
And if it means
Me against the world
I won't let you escape
Cause somebody gets hurt

Cause I hate you
Every single fucking one of you
I hate you
I hate you all
Because I hate you
Every single fucking one of you
I hate you
I don't get asked about you
I don't get asked about you

It's kinda serious
This means, we're at war
And I will hate you like I never did before
So don't you look
Or even talk to me
Or else my rage
Becomes your destiny

I hate you
Til you're down on the floor
Right in your face
We'll even the score
I'll break you til you wish you were never born
Again and again
That's what I'm for

I can't describe
What's going on with me
Something inside
Sets my anger free
The feelings now
Born out of spite
You are at war
A thorn in my side

I cannot change
My fucking part of you
It's all about
With you
And if it means
Me against the world
I won't stop this game
Cause somebody gets hurt

Cause I hate you
Every single fucking one of you
I hate you
I hate you all
Cause I hate you
Every single fucking one of you
I hate you
I don't get asked about you
I don't get asked about you
Every single fucking one of you
I don't get asked about you

But I'm so full of doubt
Because, if I don't care
How can I hate you?
