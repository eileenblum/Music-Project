Man made life 
And man made world
We better watch out cause we never learn
To treat life with respect
And we don't know what to expect
As we play god

How far will you go?
How far will you go?

Become apart of creation
What are we waitting for?
Become apart of creation
And just want to hate
I'll make you a god!

Secrets of life - 
A secret we feel
All about life and death
B and A and we all need the key
And knowledge - it holds responsibility

Why do we kill what we create?
Why do we kill what we create?

We create and we destroy
Just to feed our needs
Science means success
Creating the laboratory death

Become apart of creation
What are we waitting for?
And just want to hate
I'll make you a god!

And just want to hate!
I'll make you a god!

Become apart of creation
What are we waitting for?
Become apart of creation
What are we waitting for?
And just want to hate
I'll make you a god!
