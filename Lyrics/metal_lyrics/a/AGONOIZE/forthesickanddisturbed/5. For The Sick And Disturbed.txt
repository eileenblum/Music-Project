What the hell is wrong with you?
What the hell is wrong with you?

The way you look, the way you are,
You think you are a fuckin' star,
The way you smile, the way you talk,
I even hate the way you walk,
You speak of truth when you lie,
It's even fake when you cry,
You make me sick, leave me alone,
Wake up, get a life on your own.

Fuck you!
I just hate people like you!
Fuck you!
I just hate people like you!

Your world is a lie, your truth is not mine,
Your words don't hurt,
This one goes out to the sick and disturbed.
This is when two worlds collide,
The choice that we made, you decide,
I'm not the one who eats the dirt,
This one goes out to the sick,
The sick and disturbed.

Don't stare at me the way you do,
Don't stare at me, I'm not like you,
I'm not the freak, you've gone too far,
The real scum is what you are,
Fuck you and your lies,
Shut up, it's not advise,
Don't speak, don't speak to me,
It's my life as you can see.

Fuck you!

Your world is a lie, your truth is not mine,
Your words don't hurt,
This one goes out to the sick and disturbed.
This is when two worlds collide,
The choice that we made, you decide,
I'm not the one who eats the dirt,
This one goes out to the sick,
The sick and disturbed.
