Hey sister, won't you come to me tonight?
To switch off my machine
To blow off my light
Hey sister, what is your deal?
Did we ever had a choice
Was the suffering for real?

Hey sister, how do you feel?
Fifty-five dead and hundreds more to kill
Hey sister, won't you kill me tonight?
Switch off my machine and blow off my light

Â¿You're Selling Lies (Your soul is ice?)
When You're Selling Society's Lies?
You're Selling Lies
When You Â¿Stare or Scare? Into Paradise

You Call Yourself
The Angel Of The Light
You Bring Death In The Middle Of The Night
You Spread Fear, You're The Devil's Nurse
They Got No Choice You Will Spread Your Curse

You'll Become The Angel Of Death
Fifty-Five Killed And Hundreds More To Get
You'll Become The Angel Of Death
The Angel Of Death

You'll Become The Angel Of Death
Fifty-Five Killed And Hundreds More To Get
You'll Become The Angel Of Death
The Angel Of Death

(repeat last 4 stanzas)

The Angel of Death
The Angel of Death
