Father tell me, where do I have to go?
where have I been? what is going on?

Father tell me, where do I belong?
Why does it hurt? why is this wrong?

Why do I see, believers who are dreamers?
truth is what you make out of it
ignorance, without confidence
will it ever change?

save me from this ordinary life
save me from this ordinary world
what will be next?

Save me from this ordinary life
save me, save me
save me from this ordinary world
save me, what will be next?

so what?
what will be next?

Father tell me, do I have to regret what 
I've done? or do I have to forget?

damn you
damn this
damn life
But Useless Ordinal life!!

save me from this ordinary life
save me from this ordinary world
what will be next?

Save me from this ordinary life
save me, save me
save me from this ordinary world
save me, what will be next?

so what?
what will be next?
