By the look into your eyes
I feel my rage
And have to Think twice
You've turned away
Now itÂ´s too late
All I have left for you
Is Anger and hate

You're not a part of me
Get out of my face
Get out of my way

You're not a part of me
Cause you're not a part of me

Get out of my face
Get out of my way

I suffer well
Thats for sure
For all these things I killed
There is no cure
No chance for guilt
With fellings for regret

Sometimes I feel like IÂ´ll blow off my head
Sometimes I feel like IÂ´ll blow off my head
Sometimes I feel like IÂ´ll blow off my head
Bang! Bang! Bang!

You're not a part of me
Get out of my face
Get out of my way

You're not a part of me
You're not a part of me

You're not a part of me
Cause youÂ´re a part of me

Get out of my face
Get out of my way

You're not part of me 
Cause you're not part of me

By the look into your eyes
I feel betrayed
By all your lies
The time is right
The feelings are dead
Sometimes I feel like I'll blow off my head

Sometimes I feel like I'll blow off my head
Bang Bang Bang.
