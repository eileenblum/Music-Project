Everytime I wake up I feel like shit
So fracture, so lost without you
Fulfil my needs, fulfil my dreams
Feed my hunger with porture
Call me a slave, but give me what I need
Once more - immortal -
Call me addicted, call me a fool
But life itself can be so cruel 

Push the needle inside my skin,
I promise you I will not scream!
Fill my veines that's what IÂ´ve missed,
so let me feel the devil's kiss!

Fill this emptyness in me,
and let my mind be free from sin!
Hurry up I cannot wait,
so pump it up fulfile my fate!

Slave... 
Slave...
Slave...

Fill my veines, set me on flames
Slave to the needle!
Show no mercy, show no fear
Slave to the needle!
Straight to my veine,
and to my hand.
Slave to the needle!
Show no mercy, show no fear.
I'm a slave to the needle!

I want you, I need you...
I want you... I need you!
