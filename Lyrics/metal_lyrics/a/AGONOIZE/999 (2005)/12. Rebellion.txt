Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years

No longer seek forgiveness
Don't try to reach the stars
So have we all forgotten
Freedom is a gift
Two thousand years enslavement
Of feeling used and abused

Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years

Two thousand years of unconsciousness
Two thousand years without pride
Two thousand year of mindfuck
Two thousand years without my own identity

Stop praying for forgiveness
Just remember who you are
Free yourself from their filthy hands
Their will has gone too far
Two thousand years
Two thousand years

Two thousand years of unconsciousness
Rebellion
Two thousand years without pride
Rebellion
Two thousand year of mindfuck
Rebellion
Two thousand years without my own identity

Rebellion
Rebellion
Rebellion

There won't be salvation
You run from, from grace
It's time for rebellion
Call your brothers to arms

Two thousand years
Two thousand years
Two thousand years

Two thousand years of unconsciousness
Rebellion
Two thousand years without pride
Rebellion
Two thousand year of mindfuck
Rebellion
Two thousand years without my own identity

Rebellion
Rebellion
Rebellion
