I want to know what's going on
What is right and what is wrong
I don't believe in all your lies
Don't want to live with the consequence of a compromise

The way you pray it doesn't matter
Living this way doesn't make me feel better
I seek the truth, what have you done?
There must be more than your fucking holy one

There must be more
Tell me the truth

I... sacrifice... me...
For the answers I'm longing for
I... sacrifice... me...
For you... tonight

The way you are, the way things turn
For your belief they came to slash and burn
What we might do to feel pure
Does not fulfill your so-called holy book

You talk about religious truth
But without proof it would be of any use
If we exist by any means
Then I hope my life is just a dream
Just a dream...

Believers and sinners
They are all the same

I... sacrifice... me...
For the answers I'm longing for
I... sacrifice... me...
For you... tonight
