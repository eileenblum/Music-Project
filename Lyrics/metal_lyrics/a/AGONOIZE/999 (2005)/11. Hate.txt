Inside your head is where i'll stay
And i will never go away
You'll go insane, you can't see me
That's how revenge can really be

Your fear will grow from day to day
It makes me stronger when you pray
All i can feel is rage and hate
To see you burn, i can not wait

You passed me on your way to crime
But don't see, that world was mine
Hate fills my head, i see red
One day you'll lose your fucking head

Never again you'll hold a knife
That's for what i really strive
I wish that a deep red flood
Will drown you in your own cold blood
