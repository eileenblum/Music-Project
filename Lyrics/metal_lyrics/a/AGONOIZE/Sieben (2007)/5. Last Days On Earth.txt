Counting the days, 92 days to go
Counting the days, 92 days to go
Like a disease, that kills her slow.
She's counting the days â she has 92 days to go.
She's using life like she's losing a friend.
She never cries, until the end.
Facing her death, she is only 41.
She's fending away the man and her son:
To keep them away from suffering and pain.
She still hopes they can be healthy again.

Last days on earth â she never lost her faith.
Last days on earth â she only wants to die in grace.
Last days on earth,
Last days on earth,
Last days on earthâ¦

Like a disease, that kills her slow.
She's counting the days â she has 20 days to go.
She's losing weight so fast â her bones start to decompose.
Someone might win, but she knows that she's going to lose.
Meeting her friends, smoking her last cigarette,
Do everything one more time, so soon she will be dead.
Three days to go â she is so weak.
She wants to be alone, she died asleep.
Counting the daysâ¦

Last days on earth â she never lost her faith.
Last days on earth â she only wants to die in grace.
Last days on earth,
Last days on earth,
Last days on earthâ¦
