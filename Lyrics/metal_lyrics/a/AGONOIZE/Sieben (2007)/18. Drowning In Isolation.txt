I'm drowning in isolation ...

The wind is cold and freezing
Sitting here alone
Suffering from the outside world
Nobody to talk to
Nobody to share my thoughts
All alone surrounded by silence

I'm drowning in isolation
All that remains
Shattered grounds

I'm drowning in isolation
Suffering in solitude

I'm drowning in isolation ...

The shimmering lights hurt my eyes
Days go by, nothing can change
The vows of silence
Broken dreams
Wishes unfulfilled

I need someone
I go insane
Crying for help
Struggling

Try to cure in darkness
Again
I'm left to die
