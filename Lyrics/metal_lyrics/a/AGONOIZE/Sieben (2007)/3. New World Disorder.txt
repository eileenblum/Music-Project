Oh yes, our world is dying
But this is something we known for years

Oh my god, we are killing nature
So come on, tell me something new

Hell yeah, we destroy the environment
But less talking could be a start

Seems like we've stopped to be a part of this planet
Hopefully there's life on mars

Let's waste this planet, let's waste this planet
[x2]

Welcome to a new world disorder
Terror and chaos are spreading worldwide
Welcome to a new low of evolution
The end of the world made by mankind
[x2]

Come on, we pollute the air
But hey stupid you still go by car

I know we wiped out most species
Why worry? There are thousands more

We call ourselves the crown of evolution
Beware the fall might be long

No need to panic while all hell breaks loose
We will be dead before the great collapse

Welcome to a new world disorder
Terror and chaos are spreading worldwide
Welcome to a new low of evolution
The end of the world made by mankind
[x2]

Let's waste this planet, let's waste this planet
[x2]
