How many times, we've tried to be free
How many times, we fail

We've build the weapons, of mass destruction
To destroy/summon nature

Unchained, Released
Unchained, Released
Raw Power, raw Force
We've lost control
Unchained

Fighting, man against man
Till everything lies in ruins
Following leaders, corrupted by power
One world, one lie

Cold war, nation against nation
Unweary, what beauty they violate
They know,what power they possess
They hold the key, for the ultimate death

War leads to terror, terror leads to war
War leads to terror, terror leads to war

Unchained, Released
Unchained, Released
Raw Power, raw Force
We've lost control
Unchained

Unchained, Released
Unchained, Released
Raw Power, raw Force
We've lost control
