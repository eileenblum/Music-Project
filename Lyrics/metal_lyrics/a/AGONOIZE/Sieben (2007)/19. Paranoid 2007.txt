I live in a lie, don't ask me why
Lay in my bed with a gun to my head
Whispering voices in my head
Running shadows follow me
I could not feel right from wrong
Human animal... it can't be real

Paranoid, paranoid destruction
Paranoid, paranoid destruction

I bring you death
Drink your blood
Deplore your soul
Decapitate you

I live in a lie, don't ask me why
Lay in my bed with a gun to my head

Paranoid, paranoid destruction
Paranoid, paranoid destruction

Paranoid, paranoid destruction
Paranoid, paranoid destruction

Paranoid, paranoid destruction
Paranoid, paranoid destruction
