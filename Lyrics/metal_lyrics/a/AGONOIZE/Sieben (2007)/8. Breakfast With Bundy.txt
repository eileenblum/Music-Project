How does it feel to kill murderer
Does it make you feel good
How does it feel to kill murderer
You made me understood

Do your call that justice
Do your call that human rights
Do you ever think about it
It's time to change your sights

6 to 5 nations still have kept your punishment
6 to 5 nations have the other, wrong government
How does it feel to kill murderer
How does it feel, how does it feel

[Chorus]
Switch on, switch off
Switch on, switch off the light
You let them die, die, die
But I want to know why
Switch on, switch off
Switch on, switch off the light
You let them die, die, die
But I want to know why

How does it feel to kill murderer
Take a look into his eyes
How does it feel to kill murderer
Don't tell me nobody cries

Do your call that justice
Do your call that human rights
Do you ever think about it
How do you sleep at night

How does it feel to kill murderer
I want to know, I want to know
How does it feel to kill murderer
Mister anger decides to start the show

[Chorus]

Die, die, die
But I want to know why!..
