Knick KnÃ¤ck - there goes my heart - smashed on the floor
Ripped out by your cold hand
Knick KnÃ¤ck - there goes my brain - cracked on the wall
Destroyed by your dark mind
Knick KnÃ¤ck - there goes my spine - broken apart
While I was still crawling
Knick KnÃ¤ck - there goes my trust - kicked away
While I was still on my knees

The first cut is the deepest - these scars will stay forever
The first cut is the deepest - these scars will stay forever

Slashed - open - these wounds will never heal
Slashed - open - these wounds will never heal

Knick KnÃ¤ck - there goes my tongue - cutted out
While I was still speechless
Knick KnÃ¤ck - here goes my head - lost on the way
While I was still running away
Knick KnÃ¤ck - there goes my taste - thrown away
While I was still with you
Knick KnÃ¤ck - there goes my life - torn apart
By a freak like you

Slashed - open - these wounds will never heal
Slashed - open - these wounds will never heal
Slashed - open - these wounds will never heal
Slashed - open - these wounds will never heal
Slashed - open - these scars will stay forever
