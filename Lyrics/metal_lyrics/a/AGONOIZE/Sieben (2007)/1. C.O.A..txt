Truth may change
Belief can be cured
Religion doesn't mean slavery at all
Your faith is not an option for me

This is my church
This is my world
This is my temple
This is what you deserve

This is my church
This is my world
This is my temple
This is what you deserve

Praying is useless
Paradise is a lie
Nothing is holy except of life
Forget what you learned
Your faith shall be turned
Blasphemy is what you made of it

This is my church
This is my world
This is my temple
This is what you deserve

This is my church
This is my world
This is my temple
This is what you deserve

We will not judge you
Our wills will be done
