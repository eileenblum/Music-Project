Zero, zero, eight, one
Zero, zero, eight, one
Come to me, don't say a word.
I promise you, it won't hurt.
Move your tongue, lick your lips.
Get down, and move your hips.
You take my breath, you turn me on.
It's so intense, it's so strong.
Get down and move slow.
Get down, go with the flow. 
I think I am a lunatic.
Life is hard as my fucking prick.
I think I am a lunatic.
Life is hard as my fucking prick.

Zero, zero, eight, one
Come closer, come closer. 
Zero, zero, eight, one
Come closer, come closer. 

Zero, zero, eight, one - that's what you are.
Zero, zero, eight, one - my dark heart
Zero, zero, eight, one - overload
Zero, zero, eight, one - set to explode
Zero, zero, eight, one
Zero, zero, eight, one.

Come to me, don't say a word.
I promise you, it won't hurt.
Get down and move through.
Get down and go wit the flow
You're TNT, you're dynamite.
Take me now, take me tonight.
You're like a bomb, I can propose.
I'm ready to explode.
Come closer, come closer.

Zero, zero, eight, one
Come closer, come closer. 
Zero, zero, eight, one
Come closer, come closer.
