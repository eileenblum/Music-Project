Where have I been last night? - What's going on?
Who's making such a noise? - Am I all alone?
What is this place here? - Where are my clothes gone?
Why am I naked? - Something is really wrong.
You are standing in front of me - asking questions
Give me a fuckin' clue - make a suggestion
My head is hammering - it doesn't stop
Maybe I met you in that fuckin' club

This must be a dream
This must be a fuckin' dream
Welcome to my personal nightmare

Where the fuck is my mind?
Who the fuck are you?
I can't remember your name.
Who the fuck is to blame?
Intoxication - intoxication
Where the fuck is my mind?

How much did I drink last night? - Where do you come from?
What's your fuckin' name again? - I can't remember
Where is my money gone? - Do I have to pay you?
Where does this condom come from? - Help me remember
Oh shit, you are anything but a beauty
Maybe I was to drunk to fuck and fulfil my duty
You keep on smiling while you are staring at me
I wish I could smile and die in dignity

This must be a dream
This must be a fuckin' dream
Welcome to my personal nightmare

Where the fuck is my mind?
Who the fuck are you?
I can't remember your name.
Who the fuck is to blame?
Intoxication - intoxication
Where the fuck is my mind
