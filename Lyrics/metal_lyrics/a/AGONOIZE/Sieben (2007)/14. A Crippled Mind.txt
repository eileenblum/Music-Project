Run baby run
Run baby run

Run baby run
Run run run

Run baby run
Run run run

Get real and open your eyes
Stop living in desperate lies
Grow up and get used to your pain
It will happen again and again

See life is disapointing
To be heard is part of your life
Think straight and fight your emotions
'Cause only the strongest survives!

Can't you see what is real?
Can't you see what is real?

Run baby run
Run run run

Run baby run
Run run run

Let's go ahead
You're chasing the devil
Believing demons which hide inside
Come on, give in, your soul is forsaken
A crippled mind left to rot inside

Now face your fear
While your heart is still broken
Ignore the pain it will never heal
Confusing force for its final illusion
Dream on that this life is for real

Let's go ahead
You're chasing the devil
Let's go ahead
You're chasing the devil

There might be a time to cry
There might be times for sadness
But please get real
Try to escape this madness

See for reality
And stop crawling in bitterness
Just think it through
You throw yourself into emptiness!

Can't you see what is real?
Can't you see what is real?

Let's go ahead
You're chasing the devil
Believing demons which hide inside
Come on, give in, your soul is forsaken
A crippled mind left to rot inside

So face your fear
While your heart is still broken
Ignore the pain it will never heal
Confusing force for its final illusion
Dream on that this life is for real

Let's go ahead
You're chasing the devil
Let's go ahead
You're chasing the devil

Run baby run
Run run run
Run baby run
Run run run
