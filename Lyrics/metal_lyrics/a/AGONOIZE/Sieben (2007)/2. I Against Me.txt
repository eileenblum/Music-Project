Is it me? Is it really me? I cannot stand myself

Sometimes I hate myself for what i've done
Sometimes I hate myself for who i am
Sometimes I hate myself for what i've lost
Sometimes I hate myself for what went wrong
[x2]

Misguided by myself - full of fatal pride
Always gone to far - always over the edge
So full of arrogance - too blind to see the outside world
Running in circles - so bored of life

Is it me? Is it really me? I cannot stand myself

I against me, me against myself
I have become my enemy number one
I against me, me against myself
I have become my enemy number one
[x2]

IÂ´m Feeling so useless - IÂ´m raping my mind
Sometimes I hate myself for being blind
Fighting myself - what will it be?
Sometimes I hate myself for hating me
Sometimes I hate myself for thinking twice
Sometimes I hate myself without compromise
Full of broken dreams - always on the run
Crushed by myself - I come undone

I against me, me against myself
I have become my enemy number one
I against me, me against myself
I have become my enemy number one
