Touch me with the purity of tones,
Forget this present moment and walk through the time,
All that has been frozen will melt down with a drop of wine,
Unlock your soul to me, dear, beautiful music comes from a tear...
Play for me... play for me....

Touch me with your inspiration,
I'm not Mother Nature but a quiet, passing by stranger,
Unleash your canvas from the dust and strive for your greatest lust,
Make a new world of today,
Unite the colors of love and hate...
Paint for me... paint for me...
