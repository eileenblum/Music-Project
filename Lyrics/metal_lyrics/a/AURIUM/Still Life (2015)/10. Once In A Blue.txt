Opiate scent woke up the morning
Blank stare I didn't hide
Just saving hard words from you
And the promise you want from me

Now I know what letters are missing
Seems to me your name passing me by
It sounds so sad but painfully true
I have just been fooled once in a Blue

Will our wheels halt?
Will they my love?

I didn't reach the reef of love
I'm drowning deep in search of my heart
You'll never know it my lover
What colors faded away with that night
