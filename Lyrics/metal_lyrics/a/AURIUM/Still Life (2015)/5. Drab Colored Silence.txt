Close yourself within your castle of sorrow
Feel comfort and freedom on your wings
Find your lost dream in the secrets of tomorrow
You'll never know what a new born Sun brings

Welcome to the world of today
New scars and new stories
Foes are taking away it all
Piece of paper makes worries

Dive through the Heaven's sky
See the world of violence
Children's smile is lost in the tears
No broken wing can fly
In drab colored silence
Lie down and sleep with no fear

Try to reach the star that shines under the sea
Save yourself, drink the light of faith and hope
Try to heal your heart before it starts to bleed
Seek for the answers that you already know

There's no warrior who the water needs
Or garden to run through
There's no virgin in a wedding dress
Everything is left in you...

"Point the finger, blame the whore"
