I feel your hatred on my skin
Soundless words and whispering
Your shaded faces no one sees
But you're breathing life into me

I am walking down the deadly path
But you're still the one standing in the dark
You're blinded by my brightest lights
Until my darkness closes your eyes

You are drowned in a world of lies
But each one was only for us
The truth is far beneath the time
Slowly fading in the distance.

Close to the end we're taming our path
We're lost in the dead piece of time
Real is the fear that's keeping me here
If you leave, it'll all disappear!

I walked down the deadly path
But you're still the one standing in the dark
You're blinded by my brightest lights
My darkness forever closed your eyes
