Embracing you was like touching the time
Loving you was never enough
I wish I died that night in your open eyes
Without blinking away

Tell me the truth my darling
What happened inside your mind
Would you ever let me know
About the sparkle in your eye
Tell me the truth my darling
Just tell me the truth this time

You're standing alone in your kingdom of sadness
Thinking of everything we lost in the end
Everything's gone now and never will be back
All we've ever dreamt about faded away

Nobody left beside you and nobody cares
How you feel inside your clouded head
Now it's too late to cry cause everything's gone
And I lied to you all along
