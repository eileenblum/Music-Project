The walls are getting nearer
I see as the difference between us
I'm not the one, no, I'm not the one that
Reveals the faces under the surface

I'm chained inside of your deep hollow mind
Trapped between the walls of ignorance
Silence for the voices from the outside
Unslave yourself it will set you free forever

The walls were getting nearer
We saw the difference between us
I am the one, I am the one that
reveals the faces under the surface

"I know you're out there searching for the certain light
But it's the dead end, it's just in vain
You cannot feel fear trough the cartoonized sphere
I have secrets too, my dear"
