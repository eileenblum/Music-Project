The Autumn is late
Late for her rescue
But there's something in time
Endless and divine

So small's the distance
From her to nowhere
With her existence
it's not so cold

Reaching down for light
(Reaching down for light)
And than I'm diving in
(And I'm diving in)
The deepest dream
There where you are

Blinded by the light
I feel her burning
Like the sun dark place for your soul
Drowning into watery eyes
You're falling asleep never to wake up

Seeking for a part of a dream
To reach the note behind the veil of dust
Could it be more strange?
This human being ever so distant makes me feel
I found my real life

You'll always be the one who makes me feel alive
Go away with the smile and never wake me up
Reaching down for light
(And I'm diving in the deepest dream)
There where you are

Blinded by the light
I feel her burning
Like the sun dark place for your soul
Drowning into watery eyes
You're falling asleep never to wake up
I see your light you're burning like the sun
I keep the distance not leaving you behind
I want to believe
And this child in me is
Falling asleep to your bed time story
