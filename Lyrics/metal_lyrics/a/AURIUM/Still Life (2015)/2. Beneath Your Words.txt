Iâm crawling through the halls of past
Donât dream of future, border line
How can you still believe me?

I see you blurry through these bars
The shadow swallowing
Your shape before me

Iâm the sinner, Iâm the saint
All youâll never be
The one who dared to waste your time
Blend your memories

How far Iâll get depends on you
You build the walls around
Place your riddles under the stone
Or leave them on the ground

Year after year trailing the smiles
Upon your lips
Drinking the truth, drinking the wine
Beneath your silent words
