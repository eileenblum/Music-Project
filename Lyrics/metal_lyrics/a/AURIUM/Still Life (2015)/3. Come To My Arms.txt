We've never been closer to perfection
Now at sunrise of our new dawn
Out of tone I sing to you to find
My lost swept path so far behind.

Take my hand and I'll lead you to inane
We'll enter the dream, this world is insane
The red moon will rise over our illusions
They lead astray let me show you the way.
