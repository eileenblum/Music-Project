Seeking me throughout the day
Wandering in my thoughts - nowhere to go
It follows and look for my mind

And I have this feeling so close
Trying to push me down - wherever I go
I will try to keep it away

Am I living dreams or illusions?
Am I walking beyond the edge?
If I am awake
I will find the strength to win

We live in the envy-days
Believe me we can really escape
So let's keep on fighting and open our eyes

Disturbing me during the day
It blinds me like the sun, rips my soul
It changes everyone

And even if I see its face
It punches me back and knocks me down
- but I'm not still
I'm sorry - I'll stop it someday

Am I living dreams or illusions?
Am I walking beyond the edge?
If I am awake
I will find the strength to win

We live in the envy-days
Believe me we can really escape
So let's keep on fighting and open our eyes

Innocents come and go
And envy surrounds a poor soul
Burying lives when no one
Really knows the end is
I'll strive like never before
Running from this curse
- keeping this feeling so far

And even if I see its face
It punches me back and knocks me down
- but I'm not still
I'm sorry
-but I'm just so sure I can beat this nasty game

Am I living dreams or illusions?
Am I walking beyond the edge?
If I am awake
I will find the strength to win

We live in the envy-days
Believe me we can really escape
So let's keep on fighting and open our eyes

I am feeling so good right now
There is a relief in my mind and my soul
Now I know where to go!
