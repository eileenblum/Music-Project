Life is a stage where we play a role
Days are gone and we wait for the audience to come
There is reward for those who stand for the applause
Only for the sincere hearts and good souls

When the curtain opens in front of you
it's time to play and be yourself
When the theater is crowded
It's your turn to be alive

Show me your gift
Let me know your desires
Show me your brightness
Spread your light now and make me cry
Make me cry and share your dreams with me

Starlight - Watching you in the spotlight
On the stages of our lives
Shedding tears from everyone
Starlight - Watching you in the spotlight
Entertaining the audience
Giving your heart and your soul

Walk on the streets and shine like a star
And try to remember who you really are
When the curtain opens in front of you
It's your time to play and be yourself

Spread your light now and make me cry
Make me cry and share your dreams with me

Starlight - Watching you in the spotlight
On the stages of our lives
Shedding tears from everyone
Starlight - Watching you in the spotlight
Entertaining the audience
Giving your heart and your soul
