Reaching the highest mountain
Climbing for days and days
To rest and free my soul

When the wind blows
It takes away my sadness
I'll never forget
The lightning falling throughout the night

The echo is coming back
Bringing some pleasant words
And now - I can live in a daydream

Give me shelter
Give me truth
Give me every little piece of life
Take me higher
Take me far away
And I'll live again

Birds are flying
Over a mystic place
Where I believe
There is a sacred and hidden stone

No matter where it is
There is a place to go
And pray - everyone has a temple

Give me shelter
Give me truth
Give me every little piece of life
Take me higher
Take me far away
And I'll live again

Nature
Please don't fade away
Nature
Please guard all my dreams and all my life

Give me shelter
Give me truth
Give me every little piece of life
Take me higher
Take me far away
And I'll live again
