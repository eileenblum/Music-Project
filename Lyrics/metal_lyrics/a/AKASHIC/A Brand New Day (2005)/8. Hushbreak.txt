Don't be so reckless tonight
Give me an answer
Break all this cold inside
Speak with your heart

Nothing is so deep
Give me a word
Rising your voice out loud
Say how you feel

Tell me how to survive without an answer
I'm dying, I'm fading away...

Send me a sign tonight
Please don't forget it
You should come to me
You've got to say something

Nobody is able to remain
Stuck between walls
I so sun will not rise
Bringing a brand new day

Tell me how to survive without an answer
I'm dying, I'm fading away by your side
Tell me how to survive without your breath
I'm dying, I'm fading away
Please just let me know
