There's no room for more lies
An empty space between us
And I'll show myself to you now
Show you my heart and my soul

Don't be afraid to ask me
I've got all this feelings locked inside me
I will show you how much I love you
Look at my eyes, come closer

I'll try to tell you
What I've never said before
I'll tell what's going on in my heart

Revealed secrets
Never spoken
I love your flesh and blood

I have always kept this secret
Afraid of scaring you away
I hope I can share all my dreams with you

I've never thought I could be this way
And open my heart and my soul
Reveal all my deepest secrets
Shout to the world that I love you

And just say something to me
I really want to hear your voice
Please talk to me
Reveal all your secrets
For you my love will last forever
