Walking miles on the hot ground
While the heat kills the last tears
Living a roughness life
Losing the faith
Where is the stream to save me now?

All I can see
All I ca live
All I can see is my fate
I just want to walk in the rain
I just want to walk in the rain

And the desert hurts everyone
Helpless, the poor boy crosses the storm
Northeast of Brazil
A land full of miracles
Sends all its saints to save this child

All I can see
All I ca live
All I can see is my fate
I just want to walk in the rain
I just want to walk in the rain

Sun - is burning the trees
Is making me dizzy
Is hurting my skin
Rain - Will wash all my sins
Will keep me alive
Will give me some peace

And the desert hurts everyone
Helpless, the poor boy crosses the storm
Northeast of Brazil
A land full of miracles
Sends all its saints to save this child

All I can see
All I ca live
All I can see is my fate
I just want to walk in the rain
I just want to walk in the rain
I just wan to relieve my pain
