Like a motion of a simple day
You rouse me like a
Bird's song does
You're so close - my blood flows
Like migrations of my good old friends
Your absence brings melancholy
I can stand it - you are the queen

I am waiting for the sight
When you give me your best smile
And I hold you so tight
Hear your voice
And touch your lips

So I see through your eyes?
Do I feel the scent of us?
I believe in our love
Angel, bring yourself to me!

Can you be in all of my dreams?
Can you live inside of me?
I believe in our love
Angel, bring yourself to me!

I'm the wind you are the breeze from the sea
The precious thing in my wishing-well
It's your return - your coming home

I am waiting for the sight
When you give me your best smile
And I hold you so tight
Hear your voice
And touch your lips

So I see through your eyes?
Do I feel the scent of us?
I believe in our love
Angel, bring yourself to me!

Can you be in all of my dreams?
Can you live inside of me?
I believe in our love
Angel, bring yourself to me!

I want to hold you so tight
I want to lay in your arms
Whisper and whisper that I love you
