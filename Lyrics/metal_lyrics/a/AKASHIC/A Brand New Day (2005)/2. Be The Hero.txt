Changes are what we need
No matter how much it hurts
Corners to find new ways
- and find a way for peace
Revolution is in the air

Day by day we can be the heroes
And try to make a safe world
Everyday a new hope will remind us
It's time to open our eyes
day by day we can be the heroes
And breathe the air of heaven

Marching out on the streets
Spreading some peace around
Hug all your friends right now
- and make yourself alive
Revolution is in our arms

Day by day we can be the heroes
And try to make a safe world
Everyday a new hope will remind us
It's time to open our eyes
day by day we can be the heroes
And breathe the air of heaven

Let's forget the anger here
Say you'll never lie
You don't wanna see
Don't let your brother die

Let's forget the hatred near
Keep yourself alive
Say you wanna live
Don't let your mother cry

Day by day we can be the heroes
And try to make a safe world
Everyday a new hope will remind us
It's time to open our eyes
day by day we can be the heroes
And breathe the air of heaven

Let's forget the anger here
you don't wanna see
Don't let your mother cry
