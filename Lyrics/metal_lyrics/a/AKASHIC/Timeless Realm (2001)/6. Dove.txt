Dove
The wings of peace and love
You give me all I need
Gentle touches shall stay inside
'Till the end of time

Sweet
My crowned queen for you my soul,
My arms open wide
All my dreams shall become a life to Joyful days

I want to fell the waves take
My pain away to free my heart
So spread all your shine again
And make me wish and make me smile
You mean all to me

Trance
We die when we make love
And share the deepest desire
Hold my hand, we can find in us the sublime love

I want to fell the waves take
My pain away to free my heart
So spread all your shine again
And make me wish and make me smile
You mean all to me

I'm running to the shore to feel you close to me

I want to fell the waves take
My pain away to free my heart
So spread all your shine again
And make me wish and make me smile
You mean all to me
