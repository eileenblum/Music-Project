Before the dawning breath
Wander in my deepest thoughts, I still remember
There was a time on earth,
People thought they were so strong
They were so fearless
Winds of sadness brought reminescences to me
Long distance made us grow and find the way
Healing hands
Save us now
Save us now

The son of greediness invade a land
A traitor rose to face and drown all men
Revelations on the sand
Prophesying the end of holy time

I can see a flame, and love satisfies my heart
Savior! Give me faith, passion and embrace my soul

Frightening nights and revengeful minds
Grievous days and invious signs
Were so weak to keep alive and stand awake

Atrocious skies fell on the ground
A witness saw the glory of good
Wish I could be there and see his golden eyes

Memories - Fading out of in the dusk, disappear
The future flashes in my mind
Memories - Always vanish in front of my eyes
Believe, the shadows can't survive

Reading the ancient lines
I see how easy it's to reach all the sky
Looking to all great lives
I see how dazzling was the touch of life
Walking above the water
Never had your footprint down
Take another breath
Let your dreams come true
A holy time is coming back

Memories - Fading out of in the dusk, disappear
The future flashes in my mind
Memories - Always vanish in front of my eyes
Believe, the shadows can't survive

Lies and falseness bring disgrace
mankind's wrath can brand and seal us in war
Leave behind these sentiments
Fill your mind mind with grace and kindness. Now!

I can see a flame, and love satisfies my heart
Savior! Give me faith, passion and embrace my soul
Maybe I have in me
All that I need to live
Under my fragile skin
There is no mystery

Frightening nights and revengeful minds
Grievous days and invious signs
Were so weak to keep alive and stand awake

Atrocious skies fell on the ground
A witness saw the glory of good
Wish I could be there and see...
