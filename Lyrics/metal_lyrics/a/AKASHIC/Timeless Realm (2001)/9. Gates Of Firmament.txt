Gates shall open when the shadows fade out
Silence quiet my body and enchant my heart
Felling a wind of bliss

Chains are gone and nothing ties my hand now
Flying over highlands nothing enslave my soul
Free as a knight in journey

Rising to the land of guiltless
I may spend a lifetime with no fear
Praising all the truth inside of me
I shall rise myself and reach the angels

Glorifying! Glorifying! Heavenly delight
Heavens Light! Ethereal life! Bewitching and
Divine

Great walls keep the thoughts so far
Where are the keys to paradise?
Maybe we have lost with the innocence
It seems the time let us know

Gates shall open when the shadows fade out
Silence quiet my body and enchant my heart
Felling a wind of bliss

Rising to the land of guiltless
I may spend a lifetime with no fear
Praising all the truth inside of me
I shall rise myself and reach the angels
