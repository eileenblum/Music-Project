All that you see here
Is nothing. Is Untruth
Including myself and this song
People and countries and earth are with me
We are just part of the one

When you pray in silence
To realize who you are
Meditation is the key

Who am I? Who am I?
Deny the mind.
The body and control the breath
Living and dying and trying to get
Consciousness, knowledge and grace

When you pray in silence
To realize who you are
Meditation is the key

I am waiting to find it now
The devil and sinners try to put me astray
I'm waiting to find it now
To saints and gods I will give my prays

When I find myself in the darkness of this
Existence
I will fight and try to reach the most divine
Energy

Who Am I?

All that you see here
Is nothing. Is Untruth
Including myself and this song
People and countries and earth are with me
We are just part of the one

When you pray in silence
To realize who you are
Meditation is the sky
