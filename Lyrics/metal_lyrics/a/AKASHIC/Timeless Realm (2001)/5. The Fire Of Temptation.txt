Another bait was thrown in the ocean
Waiting patient to capture a prey
The dice was cast and this is the time
Trust in your heart, wait for a bless

There is a chance to gaze the both sides
It's like a flying fish living in two worlds
Out of the sea it's caught in a trap
Drown in the air, shut in a shell

Life! Eternal is the choice you made someday
Nothing to grieve! Everyday come as it's written

It's heard a chant around all the shore line
It's a mermaid singing to you
It's so unreal, it's just a illusion
Stay far away, don't look back

There is a chance to gaze the both sides
It's like a flying fish living in two worlds
Out of the sea it's caught in a trap
Drown in the air, shut in a shell

Life! Eternal is the choice you made someday
Nothing to grieve! Everyday come as it's written
Line! Crossing all the trail of your life
Close to the edge!
Don't let temptation devour your all.

All decisions have its weight
And judgement in this life
Stand aware, stand awake and glimpse deep inside

So tell me now
How far would you go to get all that you want?
There are two ways
So think because you just have one

Life! Eternal is the choice you made someday
Nothing to grieve! Everyday come as it's written
Line! Crossing all the trail of your life
Close to the edge!
Don't let temptation swallow you.
