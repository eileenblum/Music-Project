Beyond my imagination
The reason seems not to exist
Mysterious thoughts surround me
Transcending words a secret lives
What I think about you
A mirror knows it
More than me

As far as eyes may grasp out
My confidences lay with me
I blink and fall in my thoughts
And I'm alone inside of me
What I feel about you
Amirror knows it
More than me

My mind's relief is when I'm alone
In this old place
I find some peace in my introspection

And I watching my expressions
The eyes reveal a piece for me
You wonder at my intentions
Unveiled when I fall asleep
What I think about you
A mirror knows it
More than me
