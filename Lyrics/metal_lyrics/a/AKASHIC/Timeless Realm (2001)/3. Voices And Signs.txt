Walk or run through all the haze
And reach a new dimension
You will be fine living your life by his side
Life in paradise is in your mind - There is no blood
Stare at my eyes following a feeling of goodness
Oh! You can't be wrong - There's a heaven

Truth will give you light,
Don't show me again the rancor in your eyes
Don't judge a man,
If you don't know yourself!
If you don't know me right!

Who is innocent?
Everybody laughs
Laughs when there is no pain
Don't try to escape
You won't be alone
He will give you a hand

Voices
Tell you - Don't be afraid
Someone will come to get you
And take you in his arms
Life has just begun

Signs
Show you - So many ways
In the right way you'll feel a warmth in the air

I trust in every word you say
So set me in your dreams everyday

You're in the realm of angels
Above the darkness and past lives

Bright! Now you are the light,
Pure and simple
Shine! Give us peace inside
