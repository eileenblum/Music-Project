I taste the tears on my thirsty lips and tongue
Fill me with all verve anda make me live
The venom burns and thin the spit kill the salvation
Take away this bane and heat my veins

You came to rescue me
I show you my worship
The power of my hope

I fact the hears to survive across this land
Misty dreams came in my head again
Of the days and nights
Another soul is pure and safe
Lifetime - Gave me - Timeless - Dreams to - Fly
The flames are burning far

You came to rescue me
I show you my worship
The power of my hope

Now I go through the time, feeling no weight over me
Light as a silk, hoating in the air
The power of your hand and the strength in your eyes
Helped me
Truste and love stand by my side

I fact the hears to survive across this land
Misty dreams came in my head again
Of the days and nights
Another soul is pure and safe

You came to rescue me
I show you my worship
The power of my hope
