Is there anything left
Along the dying skyline
Apart from this light which fades
Kissing the world goodbye?

At dusk, when shadows grow
Behold the shining veil
e secrets kept unfolded
The wind, a sigh from the angels

Burden of a meaningless life
Infinite darkness freezes the hearts
Godlike wrath gathering clouds
Nights of pain upon the empty earth

And I drown, and I fly
And I'm hearing the wind
And I cry with the clouds
And I'm hearing the past
And I pray, I'm away
And I close my eyes
And I stand alone
In a little shrine of clouds
And I drown, and I fly
Surrounded by their graves

A fall
A land
A call
A shrine

Running through empty vales
Resting in a shadowed sky
Flying away from the moon

alling and sleeping
In the shrine of fallen clouds
Waving goodbye to the angels
Vanished angels
Never existed
Leaving and keep away from the moon
