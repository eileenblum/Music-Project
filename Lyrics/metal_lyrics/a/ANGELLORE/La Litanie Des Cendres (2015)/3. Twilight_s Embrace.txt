Drowned by this embrace

The shining sky starts to unshape
The gliding rays of sunlight are bleeding farewell

The pines are moaning as my heart melts
A gentle wind makes the flowers shiver and shake

The sanguine gleams exalt our sorrow
Last hopes are buried still tomorrow

I remember those lonely walks
Along the moors and the vineyards
Desolate, bleak orchards
Nature's demise in vivid beauty

Darkness is coming something dies inside
We're all grief-stricken by this scenery of night
