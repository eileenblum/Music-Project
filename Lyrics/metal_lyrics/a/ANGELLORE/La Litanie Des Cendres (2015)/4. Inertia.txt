I just know he's feeling the scars of everything
I just know he's burning all of the grieves
Cold, cold, cold
Cold were his memories and cold were his fading cries

Reveal him all that you feel and forget what you have
Give him the remaining tears and the ruins of your core

End
Come on to the silence
End
I'm dwelling in the light
An unknown light

I just know he's painting a secret on the floor
I just know he's standing here in the nothingness
I just know he'll never move and I don't know if I'll come to him

Run to the lands of his mind and forget what you have
Give him the remaining tears and give up all your life

Run to the lands of his mind and forget what you have
Give him the remaining tears and give up all your life

End
Come on to the silence
End
I'm dwelling in the light
End, gathering the angels
End, we're dwelling in the light
An unknown light
