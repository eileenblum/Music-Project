Beneath tearstaind walls is lamenting my soul
Forlorn
A realm of sadness within me
I weep and silently mourn

All alone
Willing to death
Dancing with the cold hearts
Without you

Close to my tears, there is your memory
Close to my grief, I let your poison blacken me
I caress your shade and kiss your whispers
As lâm drowning in your loss

The radiance of paradise
Upon my skies
A shroud of nothingness
Once beloved memories
Haunting me
Digging my graveâ¦ Down

I want to forget that I cried
I'll stay where roses never die
Your face is fading in the night
I'll stay where roses never dieâ¦
