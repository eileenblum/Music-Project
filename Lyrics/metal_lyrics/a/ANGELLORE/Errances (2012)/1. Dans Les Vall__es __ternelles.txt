While crossing those mourning lands
In eternal vale of tears
Missing the soothing caress of the sun
My grieved soul wanders and cries
And will never be lightened anymore
O, swallowed pride in the dark

An inner suffering leaves me breathless
My sight is invaded by ruins
Forgotten stones are weeping in the night
Frozen memories of an eternal realm of pain
Frozen memoriesâ¦

Will this haven of despair be my eternal jail?
My heart beats faster while feeling this sorrow
In this eternal vale of tears, I stare at my fallen soul
In this eternal vale of tears lies an angel that
breathes no more!

Death and loss
Those calling to me
Funeral life is my endless agony
