I am the Agony!

Come to me my loveless one
Embrace me by the coldness of your life
Scream until your soul dies
You are the bleeder of eternity
I feel that you are the agony

I am the Agony
The faded innocent
In the shade of the lost soul
Until death takes my heart
Deathâ¦

A shade beneath my corpse
My tomb lies in my soul
My skin is torn of deceitful blades
Blades of torment and despair
A bleak premonition is haunting me
The scent of dark grace is filling me

I am the loveless one, the faded innocentâ¦
