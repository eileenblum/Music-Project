I have seen a frozen fairy on the horizon
Her wings caught in a stream of pain
I have loved the tears of snow in her eyes
Her last glance ripped my heart

Her sorrow, my emptiness
The velvet ice of her skin
The frost of winter
Her crystal coffin

This painful sight changed my life
Its pure essence of melancholy
I wish site could take me in her arms
Before disappearing, fading awayâ¦
