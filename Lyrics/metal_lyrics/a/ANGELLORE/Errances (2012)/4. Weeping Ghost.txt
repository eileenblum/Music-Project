My last strenghts have forsaken me
And the mist is surrounding me 
I feel the arrival of an unknown pain

I give this last breath
And I will be scattered in ashes
The embrace of death
Those cold arms over my chest

My heart full of anger
Frozen tears in my eyes
Iâm looking at my past and Iâm losing myself
An angel is calling me
Its wings so close to my soul
It wants to show me the way
The way towards the sky

Weeping ghost follows you in the land of sorrow
Mourning ghost follows you to light the candle of death
Weeping ghost follows you in the land of sorrowâ¦
