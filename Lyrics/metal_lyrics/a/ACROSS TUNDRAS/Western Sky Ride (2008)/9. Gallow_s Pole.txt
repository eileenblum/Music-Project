They would have our necks in a noose I know,
if it were the days of hangin' at the gallows pole.
It's only two devils that blow the smoke from a murderers bone.
Blowing to and fro at the base of gallows pole.
The gallows pole.
The branches bowed down below the weight
of a king's nest that was heavy of marrow.
Short of sorrow, to the gallows pole!
The gallows pole.
They would have our necks in a noose I know,
if it were the days of hanging at the gallows pole.
