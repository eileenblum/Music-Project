Firewalked the Devil's highway for five years lost and down.
Hell froze over, blinded by white from sky to the ground.
In deep tracks sinkin' low, wolf pack followin' cold.
This is the highest road by way of the lowest road.
I walked on the high road and stumbled to the lowest road.
I walked on the low road climbing to the highest road.
I run with the wolves, I chew from the bone.
I chew from the bone, and I run with the wolves.
I run with the wolves.
