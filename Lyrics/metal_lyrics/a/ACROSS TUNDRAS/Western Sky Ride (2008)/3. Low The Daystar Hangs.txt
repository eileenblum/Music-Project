Nite owl in the branches so high, pale yellow eyes of dying light.
Looking down you can see the hellfires burning bright, I know I do.
Smoke travelin' like a long black train to the sky.
You sleep with one eye open all through the nite.
Nite owl in the branches so high, pale yellow eyes of dying light.
Looking down you can see the hellfires burning bright, I know I do.
You sleep with one eye open all through the nite,
and fly away at first sight of the morning star shining bright.
Low the daystar hangs upon your head.
Whoo!
There's blood on a feather, there's blood on a wing.
For a deed that I done, so long ago it feels like a dream
So I resigned myself to hide, under a darkness so lonesome and wide.
Til my idle time passes me by and we may meet again,
and through the Western sky ride.
There's blood on a feather.
When you fly away at the first sight,
of the morning star shining down so bright.
Low the daystar hangs upon your head.
