Come follow me down to the San Luis,
under brightest stars and softest breeze,
Broke down car in the field, 1943,
stars falling on your head from heights that you've never seen.
Come follow me down to the San Luis,
under bluest skies and warm summer breeze.
Get your heart a buzzin' through the wildflowers like a bee,
and come follow me down to the old San Luis Valley.
I think I saw your face if I let myself believe,
shinin' high in the sky over the old San Luis.
Get your boots kickin' through the mountains, through the trees,
and come follow me down to the old San Luis Valley.
Come follow me down to old San Luis Valley.
