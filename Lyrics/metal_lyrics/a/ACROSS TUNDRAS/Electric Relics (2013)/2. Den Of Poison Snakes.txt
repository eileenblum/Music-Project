Remember the time when I went running away to the most remote of lands? To a place where no soul knows me and Iâm never going to tip my hand. There's a lean dark rider gunning for my life in dreams I can never escape. One hundred nights of restless sleeping. Dust and sand in my eyes when I awake. I guess thatâs the chance you take. No one ever gets out alive from the den of poison snakes. From the den of poison snakes. Looking over your shoulder when the ground starts to quake. The whole town starts to shake. Ripples shot across the State.
Last thing I remember that day was whistling through my ear. Shots rang out from the back of me, sent me falling I donât know where. I donât know where...
