Lately I've been pining for the gravel roads of my childhood home. But the windows are all boarded up and yard is overgrown. The barn fell in on itself near twenty years ago. Now it's just the land of the blackbird, stray cat, and the crow. Sometimes I get stuck living in memories so old sands are running backwards, diamonds turning into coal.
