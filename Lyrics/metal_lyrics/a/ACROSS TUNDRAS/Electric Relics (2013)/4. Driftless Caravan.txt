When dame fortune don't shine on your head it's easy to go to the place of gloom and dread. What some would give living in the ground. So many gave all and slipped away long before their time. When the hour comes let the driftless caravan ride. Sit out on the wing and hang on to that life. The driftless caravan rides. Departing for unknown skies. When damned fortune don't shine on your head don't come unraveling at your ends. When the hour comes let the driftless caravan ride. Sit out on the wing and hang on to that life. The driftless caravan rides, departing for unknown skies.. Let the reason of light shine on your head. The driftless caravan marches to unpromised lands. When damned fortune comes to its end the driftless caravan marches to the promised land.
