You canât see what's coming when you're just looking behind. Losing yourself in a maze of your own design. Tarnished to the rusted state of your mindâs dark eye. When you let the gears stop spinning it's just a matter of time. Luminaries of the restless age stare into the sun. Solar Ark keeps riding until the day is done. The visions of Sunna, daystar empress high. Riding her Sol chariot, a westward battle cry. Prisoners of the righteous cage I hope your time will come. Prisoners of the righteous cage I know your time will come. Luminaries of the restless age stare into the sun. Solar Ark keeps riding until the day is done.
