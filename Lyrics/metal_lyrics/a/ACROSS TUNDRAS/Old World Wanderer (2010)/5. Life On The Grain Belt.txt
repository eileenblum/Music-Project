Meet me up on the borderline for a twisting and turning hell of a time. On a trail called the "Death Kiss" hard hearts you will find scratching and clawing to survive. Lets go down to the big town tonite. Raise Cain 'til they have us running for our lives. Gone in the blink of road weary eye. Straining to stay open on the drive. I was scratching and clawing to surive. Lady luck hit me with a lightning strike. The cattle drive! Gravel road kicking dust up into a wake, to the fading city lights that give you no break. In my mirrrors sinking, downgrade put it out of sight. To the fading city lights that give you no break. I went down to big town one nite. Drank to hard living when you ain't got a dime. Stepped in the path of "Old Lightning Strike." He was gunnin' and I was runnin' for my life. Meet me up on the borderline for a twisting and turning hell of a time. On a trail called the "Death Kiss" hard hearts you will find scratching and clawing to survive.
