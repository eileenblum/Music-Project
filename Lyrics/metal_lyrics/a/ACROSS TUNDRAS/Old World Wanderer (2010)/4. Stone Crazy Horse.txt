I rode down from my old town, solitary to the lowgrounds. Where mystery lies beneath the fog line. The shadow of spirits chasing light. When I rode through the Black Hills of blue, shaking in my boots, some kind of spectral sight. Who stood before my eyes in amazing blinding light? Thasunka Witco on a pale horse to the sky. Riding beneath the loneliest star. On a trail to the light. I slowed down and tied my "Heroine" around a tree near the hallowed ground. In a thick haze of lost sunrays, tracks winding into a strangely calming fright. When I walked to Thasunka Witco, voices surrounding me, "khoyakiphela he?" Who rode by my side through wind and rain all night? Thasunka Witco on a stone horse to the sky. Riding beneath the loneliest star. On a trail to the light.
