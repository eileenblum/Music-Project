When your broken engine stalls on long deserted tracks, take a walk through the nameless town time blew off the map. I heard a rusted chime sing "how I longed for the open road and finding at the end my home." Hearth sinking into the earth, a fossil from a bone. Wondering how far its roots have spread and grown. I heard a far off whistle sing "on the open road, eternally my steel wheels roam." Been movin' from the day I was born. Been movin' from the day I was born. I heard my lonesome dog sing and I longed for the warmth of home standing on deserted tracks alone. Get movin' on my way to your door. Been movin' from the day I was born.
