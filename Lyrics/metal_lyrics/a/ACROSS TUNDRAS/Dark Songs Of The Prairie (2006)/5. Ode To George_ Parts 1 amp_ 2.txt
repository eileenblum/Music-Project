When your words are frozen on thin air and everything
reels right in front of you. You can laugh and breathe
without a care, everything real is right in front of you.
"Let it roll, for all it's worth."
"Find me where ye echo lays, lose ye bodies in the maze."
"Eyes that shine full of inner light,
let it roll into the night."
"Let it roll for all it's worth."
