Silver lining doesn't sell to a man in a broken shell.
Who was born to rise and fall with the best of them.
Silver lining has got to sell for you to walk from that broken shell.
You can see the light now don't you want to run?
Touch the sky and then to the ground, the grass below your feet, it's for real now.
You no longer give yourself away.
You just can't give yourself away.
Silver lining has got to sell.
