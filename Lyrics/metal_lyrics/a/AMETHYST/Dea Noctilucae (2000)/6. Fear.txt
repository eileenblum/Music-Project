As soon as the fading dark surrounds me
I go insane, wishing for the light
The thorns as a burden around my soul
Bury the present struggle for sight

Emotions, seen by few
After a night of lies
Accompany the morning's dew
The dark leaves my presence dry

Fear, as soon as the night surrounds me
Fading away, into eternal suffering
Shades of pale ebony, never to be seen by mortal men

While the fear slowly takes its toll
All visions from the past are falling away
The black path followed ahead
Will soon show its fading encumbrance

Never before could the omen
Foresee the pain left behind
The solitude of eyes staring
Grieves the mind eternally

The fear that grips me, never to be seen again
Fades with the sight of its death, their souls recur the faith
Temptations faced in the flesh, never grant us madness

As soon as the fading dark surrounds me
I go insane, wishing for the light
The thorns as a burden around my soul
Bury the present struggle for sight
