I need to break from my chains 
From all that binds me down
The suffered self, the sorrowed pain
I need a knife to cut me free 
From these chains that tie me down 

I'm cursed for all eternity 
By this scar inside my heart 
The pain will never disappear 
The guilt will never part 

I held you close, close to me 
And faced my fears to pass them through 
My bitterness long forgotten
I let my truth and beauty show

You backed away in terror 
Your smile now fading fast 
You cried out in distress
As I slashed you with the blade 

Your heart no longer beating 
Your lips no longer prayed 
I touched your blood with my fingertips 
I Smiled, and closed my eyes 

No longer felt your innocence 
I no longer heard your lies 
I withdrew all my anger 
Turned, and backed away 
I looked back... calling your name 
(It was the time for our last touch)
