Everlasting love, crying from my heart
Saving my youth for thee, we shall never part
Jading face of stone, whispering empty words
Forever blinded still, haunting bitter shores

It will never be accepted my love for thee is oh so real
Never shall we be together resting bones are held apart

Take me away where we can be together forever

No! We are not wanted here
Our people is forgiven for all they know is fear
With our powers unified
We will tear them down to be as one

Doom this night of treachery
We're hunted in fear of our powers to be
Please forgive me of my sins
Never will I give in to be loyal to thee

Walking to the island of malice
I see the truth and open my eyes
The washing shores await us there
As they keep us safe from our fears

It will never be accepted my love for thee is oh so real
Still we cannot be together resting bones are held apart
Vanish in the dark surroundings, get away from this hellish place
Faces of fright are always upon us seeking a way to end this dream

Everlasting love, crying from my heart
Saving my youth for thee, we shall never part
Jading face of stone, whispering empty words
Forever blinded still, haunting bitter shores
