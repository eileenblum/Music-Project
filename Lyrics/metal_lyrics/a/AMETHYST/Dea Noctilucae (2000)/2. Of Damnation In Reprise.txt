Look and you shall find in her eyes
A tale of damnation in reprise...

Doubt and hesitation, mandatory minds
Confusion and damnation are the only things she will find
Midst the cloudst, midst the dark blackened leaves
Unspoken words are the only thing she'll

Retrieve my soul, it still yearns for that day
Waiting anctiously to be taken away
To satisfaction, which leads to the kingdom of vain
A place where people can quietly go insane

A collusion of minds, which were no longer teached
To be broken by the promise that was hidden in me
Whisper my name, and secretly desire
Gargantuan oblivion rages out of the fire

Doubt and hesitation, mandatory minds
Confusion and damnation are the only things she will find
Midst the cloudst, midst the dark blackened leaves
Unspoken words are the only thing she'll

Retrieve my soul, it still yearns for that day
Waiting anctiously to be taken away
To satisfaction, which leads to the kingdom of vain
A place where people can quietly go insane

Embrace the sound of the nocturnal children
For they shall and they will be your only way

She must retain her inner thoughts
Never let them fade away
Dark raven haired under my spell
Until my minute of decay

Whisper my name
A kiss of immortal delight
When lightning struck
Thunder by moonlight

She must retain her inner thoughts
Never let them fade away
Dark raven haired under my spell
Until my minute of decay
