My black, mourning moods
Caught in the thickened mist
Echoing, through these woods
Wherein I unveilded, endlessly wished

Silence surrounds my presence
An entity unknown
To my dying bloodline
Crowned by the lost, depth of the endless
Wandering... in this maze of mine

The land beyond, my land forlorn, in misery
A land reigned by fear, and disbelief
Dark and deep, this is the depth of treachery
Torn by the gods, in their times of grief

I know by the knowledge of not
For I am and for I am not
Here before you I stand
The supreme of the supremest, 
I am the damned

A barren land neighed in hate
Where a man had lost his fate
This, the land of my dreams
Kept in slavery by all means
Lying in this other realm
Forbidden for mortals to see

Under her veil on the other side
There where this white bride sleeps
Lying in the valley deep and wide
I know this wisdom to me it speaks, at night...
