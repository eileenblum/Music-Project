The dream we once lived
Died in rage drenched in blood
Now the dew rises (from the battlefield)
Subdued emotions burn out of my mind

We killed the love we once cared
Life will never be the same

Warriors led into temptation by deceit
Shall one day see the light they embarked in

Soulless aeons of desolation
The light shines over the meadows again
As life flows back in me once more
Frightened eyes watch upon me from above

The fatal yearning for completeness
Sees its end draw near into a forlorn weakness
Icing ages waiting for us to come
Will strengthen our desire to be as one
