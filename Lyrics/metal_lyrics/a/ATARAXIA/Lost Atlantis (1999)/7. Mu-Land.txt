Fog weaves
anthills of steps
in plushy labyrinths
of swallowed palaces
...swings of desire are looking for the sea...
Litanies and Laments
in the mazes dance
Litanies and Laments
in the mazes dance

Fog is moving
to disguise snakes
the Truth answers
a sugar garden
...swings of desire are looking for the sea...
Litanies and Laments
in the mazes dance
