"I don't mind the harmony of waters
I'm looking nothing but dissonances
something more than perfection
crossing the narrow arch
that I know"

[passage from S. Quasimodo]

even today
we found a treasure
we found the masks
but nothing of what was found here
will be sent-away
or fall in wrong hands

[inscription found in a deserted lunatic asylum]
