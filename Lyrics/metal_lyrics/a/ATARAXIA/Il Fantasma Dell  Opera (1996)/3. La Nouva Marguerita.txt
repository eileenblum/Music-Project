[The New Marguerite]
[cover version of Kate Bush Wuthering Heights]

Follow my steps,cross the glances
I will bring you with me
In the other room,she lays her hands
embraces the courtains
How could you leave me,
When I needed to possess you?
I hated you and I loved you too.
She lays her hands,
She embraces the courtain on the walls,
she's smiling and wandering,wandering wandering
"It's me"
Christine,Christine took heat from ice,so cold,
I needed you,so cold
You,follow me and you will be young forever
You,follow me and you will sing forever
It's me Christine,it's me.
She lays her hands,smiling,but she isn't happy............
