[The pink hours of Mazenderan]

Your screams are in my mouth
and fail inside my heads.........
The spirit among the trees,the mask I've never kissed........
I will unhinge the balcony,
leaving against it will tremble and run on the contrary.
Trying to keep back life
I take-off my eyes,
dancing in my shoes,
touching with faith the holy water.
