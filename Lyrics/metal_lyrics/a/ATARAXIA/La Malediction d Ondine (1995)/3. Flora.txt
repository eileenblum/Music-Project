I've unravveled green tangles
with talons dirty of earth
I've pulled up, lacerated,
I've moulded me like mud
I've dug, removed tumuls and roots
I was rooted to the earth
I've modulated me in the deep slow flowing
of the underground seasons
I've taken shape like a shrub dilating my limbs,
I've disentangled from the womb of the earth like
a wild weed
I rise primigenial livid daughter of creation
I rise primigenial livid daughter of creation
