many and many a year ago
in a kingdom by the sea,
a maiden there lived
by the name of annabell lee.

she lived with no other thought
than to love and be loved by me,
in this kingdom by the sea
her name was annabell lee.

all the night - tide,
I lie down her side
oh my darling - my darling - my bride
my life and my bride
all the night - tide

in her sepulchre there by the sea
in her tomb by the sounding sea
I lie down by her side
all the night - tide
oh my darling my darling - my bride

her high-born kinsmen came
and bore her away from me
to shut her up in a sepulchre
in this kingdom by the sea.

neither the angels in heaven above,
nor the demons down under the sea,
can dissever my soul from the soul
of the beautiful annabell lee.

[Edgar Allan Poe]
