Plastic visions
Caught your eyes
Downtown
Where itâs coldân blue
Need a place to hide your mind

Or your brainâs gonna explode
Burn your eyes
Burn your soul
Cut off your head
Who takes you home ?
Got a reason to live
When youâre headless ?

Got a place to stay
When itâs nameless ?
Whereâs the brain,
The hope, the name ?

Feel the pain and go insane
The attitude stinks

As well as the tone

You only live once
The storyâs so old
The lazy slug
Talks a lot
Lives the nameless easy life
Crawling home

No alibi

No witness for the defense in sight

Life ainât that dramatic
Old-school dogmatists
Waste their time
With plastic visions
