Fire ignites
Burns your wheels of fortune
Lack of luck and lack of time
(You) Can keep your wheels turning
Fire ignites
Burns your wheels of fortune
With lack of fiends and lack of friends
Life ainât that amazing
Bang your drum
Shake your head
Crack yourself
None cares
Time is up
To create
Special things
The real thing
Saw you climb a tree today
To the top to play the ape
Scream until your voice is dead
None will touch the ape
Found your wheels of fortune
Flat close to the tree
Gave all the air my lungs could give
And all my sympathy
Fire ignites
All around the place
The man on the tree keeps banging his drum
Sone-cold but free
Fire ignites
All around the place
Bang your drum
Shake your head or
Crack yourself
