Friends hurt friends, what can you say
Whoâs to blame when friends lie dead
Blasting in progress, scares you to death
The mouse that roars wonât save the world
Wise blood in a time-lock, raising a riot
Small heroic son with the pulse of a gun
I donât believe in angels, they keep falling first
I believe in nightmares, Iâve seen them in your eyes

You suck the blood
From TV-screens
You lick the pain
From magazines

Space is narrow, youâre so far out
A world left to bleed as your time runs out
Caged birds donât sing, donât laugh, donât cry
Turn yourself and crawl inside
Now the day has come you wished youâd never see
Walk through a cage as the earth stands still

You suck the blood
From TV-screens
You lick the pain
From magazines

And when you lie right in my face
You think that we will rearrange
And when you burn our neighborhood
Youâll feel the strength through brotherhood
Thereâs no warning and no reasons
Whereâs your future, where does time go ?

Friends hurt friends, what can you say
Whoâs to blame when friends lie dead
Caged birds donât sing, donât laugh, donât cry
Turn yourself and crawl inside
Wise blood raising a riot
I donât believe in angels, they keep falling first
I believe in nightmares, Iâve seen them in your eyes

You suck the blood
From TV-screens
You lick the pain
From magazines
