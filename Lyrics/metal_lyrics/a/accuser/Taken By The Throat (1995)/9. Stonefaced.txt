What if they transmit the real life
What if they donât check their head
Thereâs no message
Just crown appearance
Say what you think then start to think
Live in hope
Say silent prayers
Try, fail, check another channel
Light a fag
Thatâs good protection
When you stand barefoot in the snow
Stone-faced
At my appearance
Give your best
To get me wrong
Pregnant love-doll heads for action
Dressed in black with headphones on
Pregnant love-doll dayglo abortion
At the crossroad with headphones on
Barefoot babies kick blue helmets
Salty tears on desert sand
Zero hourâs a special hour
Traffic-lights remaininâ red
