Walking with zombies
Cheaper by the dozen
Fugitives from a chain gang
Better leave the bishopâs wife
Lady in cement takes our hand
Before worlds collide

Fatal vision â Lost horizon
Pick up the truth or you will lose
Pick up the gun or run

Pretend youâre dead
Or turn your head
Stay tuned when worlds collide
The last of the innocent
Shakes the devilâs hand
The only goat in paradise
Takes the promised land

Fatal vision â Lost horizon
Pick up the truth or you will lose
Pick up the gun or run

Your billion-dollar-brain
Ainât worth a dime
When fugitives dig for the pain
Better leave the bishopâs wife
Lady in cement
You stand alone
When worlds collide
