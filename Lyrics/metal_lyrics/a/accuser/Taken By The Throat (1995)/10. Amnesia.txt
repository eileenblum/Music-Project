The next step back is a reminder
To the truth that we all face
To the minds that settled down
Our efforts might go to waste
Trying to remember
The day, the face, the sorrow
Trying to remember
The face thatâs out of sight now
Got my eyes straight ahead
Too little, too much, too soon, too late
Iâm sitting on a window pane
Iâm outside and Iâm looking in
Shut my mouth cause I was scared
Hid the feelings that shouldâve been bared
Iâm scared of always being wrong
Of course Iâm scared of being born
After all is done and said
Iâd like to rest my weary head !
