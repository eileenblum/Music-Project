So much wisdom in grey backyards
Tough cuts to crack too proud
To start, road is inside open
All trains are gone, this worldâs
Too old to be taken by the throat
It all starts
And ends so soon
In a room away from home
Run or crawl laugh or cry
Work or play tell me why
Itâs where youâre going to
Not where youâre from itâs what youâre
Heading for
The race is on, road is wide
Open as trains are gone
Wise manâs camp too far from home
