You can turn the cross upside down â

You can play with fire but some day it will burn all your hate
You can cut the truth out of its frame â
Its keepers will remain

The little fuckerâs waiting for you in the next dark corner
You can close your window to the world when it scares you
The winds of war will find a door â
Find a door to blow through
