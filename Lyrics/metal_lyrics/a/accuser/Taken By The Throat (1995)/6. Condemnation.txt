Your worldâs in a state of polarization
Condemnation, aggravation
Step aside or stand in line with crawling fools
Thereâs a snowstorm in your room
Itâs summertime

And every dayâs the same old thing
Youâd better face reality

From all the borders, all the fences
You declare your independence

Free, you feel free

See the triumphs and the glories
See the people tell their stories

Free, theyâre all free

And every dayâs the same old thing
Youâd better face reality

Like a hyperactive child you move
Like an old blind man you shoot
The smallest killer ainât innocent

Donât shoot when you canât shoot straight

And every dayâs the same old thing
Youâd better face reality
