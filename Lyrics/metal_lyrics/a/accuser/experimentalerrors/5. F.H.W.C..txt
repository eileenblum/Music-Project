Freddy and Henry -
Willy and Charles
This ballad's Dedicated
To all of you

Freddy the frontman is posing in state
Dressed in false leather -
Shaking his legs

Henry - the carwash -
Is Cruising at night
The seizing of pistons -
He Worries about

Freddy - where your groupies gone?
Your stage act's just too long
Henry - slick black Cadillac
Don't forget the oil check!

Willy Travolta - great discoboy
Greetings from Rolex - Hugo the boss

Willy - the talk of the town
He's the break-dancing clown

Charley - high society
Your perfume is killing me
Freddy - where your groupies gone?
Your stage act's just too long!
Henry - slick black Cadillac
Don't forget the oil check!

Freddy and Henry - Willy and Charles
A mirror of your life

Just look at yourself!

Willy...
Charley...
Freddy...
Henry...

[Harmony Solo: Frank/Rene]
