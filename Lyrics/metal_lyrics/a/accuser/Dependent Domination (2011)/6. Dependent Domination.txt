Independent way
never felt betray
everyone believed
to be free from all commitments

Welcome to the real might
blind man can not see the light
no black without brightly white
dependent domination

Nothing gives eternal thrill
never endless overkill
but the time is standing still
dependent domination

Everyone needs air
success doesn't care
you are a part of the whole
a piece with dependent soul

Price is too high to redeems
you have to live in your cage of compromise
spider in your net
hunter and victim
demon in chains
