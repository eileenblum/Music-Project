Every second I hate the sorrow
here today and gone tomorrow
burning horizon lights up the sky
thousand of impacts interrupt the cry

Bomb release
hail of death
we are beneath
torn to pieces

Martial rage is going on
armament predominates
history never makes a turn
the endless fuze is still burn

There is something in the air
the silence before the storm
its so peaceful who am I
in the center of the blast

Threat threat of war
hail hail of death blow to pieces
clockwork clockwork bomb
