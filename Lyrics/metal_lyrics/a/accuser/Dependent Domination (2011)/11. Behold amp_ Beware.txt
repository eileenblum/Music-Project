Corrosive love poisoned clarity
impact of lost power deprivation of hate
sirens in silence waiting for their entry
no fear no victim no fertile soil of evil

Show your pride you decide
no damage no fight never again

Behold beware
resist control

Major of death wants to start again
persistant warfare concept of enemy
return of history blood and tears again
warriors passion destructive insane terror

Never fight again

Satisfaction
by hail of bombs
senseless action
cemetary crows

Misery
by defeat
decision play
is not what we need
