Killing distrust false accusation
betrayal of secrets breaking the silence
storys mutates whisper down the lane
facts not clear but the black sheep will be found

Endless distrust
spiral of injust
rumors in circulation
the crowd decides condemnation die traitor die

Judas system see everywhere a fiend
walls and frontiers poison mind protection
acute observers with corroded senses
blinded by orders set up defences

Bad conscience through unexact statements
save your own ass and cheat the gallows
live with lies but the day will come
that others put the blame on you
