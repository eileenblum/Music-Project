Spend my time alone
far away from insults
no changes in sight
detractor shut your mouth

No one knows me inside
I'm feeling buried alive
appearance unsuccessful
detractor shut your mouth

Desolate shape incomprehension
desolate shape created by exclusion

Ideal of beauty
no room for mistakes
displayed perfection
time will show revenge

Beautiful at heart
oepn minded sanity
reasoners converge
time will tell the truth

Detractor shout your mouth time will show revenge
Detractor shout your mouth time will tell the truth

Botox for bucks
callomanua sucks
timeless beauty dies
everyday reality

Detractors getting older
the whole life in one folder
no lasting memories
no eternal youth
