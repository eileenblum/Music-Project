Bonded by home
scared and alone
mind is confused
betrayed and abused

Fellow believer parish deceiver
respect destroyed torture enjoyed

Mastering punishment
sacrifice through the lies
mastering punishment
sacrifice till the end

Hypocrite of pain
jealous and insane
get what you deserve
die with shame

Lies and pain
slave to train
last farewell
rot in hell
burn

Punish your master
state of master is a fault
we are all the same
but not in tyrants game
