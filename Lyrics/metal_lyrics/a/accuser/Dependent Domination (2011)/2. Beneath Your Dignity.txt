Suffring slowly
silent fiend of death
murdering in rates
deep cut in your life

Fearful living
your door must be closed
uncontrolled madness
drugs infinitely

Lost roots to kill lost roots
beneath your dignity

Society and joy
that is what you need
all what you get
is compassion without use

Morbid condition
boredom makes you sick
the only one desire
is death with dignity

Fade away your misery
no drugs and no insanity
death is no release for you
back to life because you're here

Fade away your misery
no boring games senselessly
only give what lost roots need
helping hands for liberty
