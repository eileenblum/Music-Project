Trapped from ego controlled by inner voice
oney the command incredible as it sounds
lost of reality delusions and decay
wait for recovery but the time slips away

Down below
undertow
drown into daze
the light shines blurred by the surface
escape from the oath

Buroed and forgotten retraction from contact
follow the conspiracy of the inner self
fellow of disorder isolated in oblivion
forsaken from the outside imprisoned in the inside

Cut the chrysalis and fly
narcosis curse have to die
swim against the undertow
break the silent flow

comes out of coma memorys coming back
hit and run causer of the crash
swear of death to do that never again
the oath and the curse will watch your live till the end
