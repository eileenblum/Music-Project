The curse the stream of now
is more and more and more
no regret inhibition or doubt
cash for corpse allowed

Weapons no bread
forests to wood
nuclear disaster
contamination

News full of shit
produced by ourselves
suicide in rates
welcome to hell

The cause of all evil
drown or die
the cause of all evil
suffocate or cry

Poverty and wealth
obesity and hunger
modesty and greed
martially and sacrificed

Imprisoned contrasts
frozen fronts
thank you nature for
the created sexual aggression
