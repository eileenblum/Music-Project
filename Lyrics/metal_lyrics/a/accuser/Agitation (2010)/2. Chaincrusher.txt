Crush the domination of ministry of violence
Destroy the aggression which hurt the innocents
Don't fight fire with fire, or you too will be accused
Stop now the game of war and give the peace a chance

Interrupt the chain reaction, of sadistic satisfaction
Blow up the retaliation, the worst choice is annihilation

Believe that one killed your sanity
That your hate brings misery
Forgive that one damaged your dreams
That nothing more is like it seems believe
Protect us from misery and turn on your sanity

Too many days of abhorrence; eleven signed the present time
Proceedings how in the past; mever give, never last
You have to crush the chain, of human nature's action
The chain of evolution must lead to satisfaction

Interrupt the chain reaction, of sadistic satisfaction
Blow up the retaliation, the worst choice is annihilation

Believe that one killed your sanity
That your hate brings misery
Forgive that one damaged your dreams
That nothing more is like it seems believe
Protect us from misery and turn on your sanity

Interrupt the chain reaction, of sadistic satisfaction
Blow up the retaliation, the worst choice is annihilation

Believe forgive
That one killed your sanity
That your hate brings misery
That one damaged your dreams
That nothing more is like it seems

That nothing more is like it seems 
That nothing more is like it seems
