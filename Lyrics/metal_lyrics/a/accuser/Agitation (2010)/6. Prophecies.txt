Scars on the soul â dried source of blood
Scars on the soul â tribes paralyzed

Old â is the story of faith
Broken â is the line with the spirit
Love - burning longing
No doubt, they murdering â because they convert

Scars on the soul â dried source of blood
Scars on the soul â tribes paralyzed

Promise â with the tounge of the snake
Progress â is the end of liberty
A grid â is the whole blue planet
A net â suffocates the lung of nature

Don't trust anyone who converts
Don't trust anyone who converts

Old broken old broken

Raped â are bodies and spirit
Lost â is respect and dignity
Hate â is the only answer
Burn down â pride and glory

Scars on the soul â dried source of blood
Scars on the soul â koyaanisqatsi
