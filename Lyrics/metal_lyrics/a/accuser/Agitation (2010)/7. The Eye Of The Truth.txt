Core of old
More of that, what they told
Lies defend
Honesty is recompenced

Soul dive look for the sense of life
Without we will never learn ourselves to know
Promises to see yourself
One man is not more and not less as he know
We need self assessment
What helps is self view
See the eyes, they see your lies

You've got the power of truth
You've got no sense in your lies
You are the one who can change

You've got the power of truth
You've got no sense in your lies
You are the one who will find your way

Stop deceive your life
Start open your eyes

Prove themselves with power
Complicated ways to satisfy animal impulses
Mating behavior is aggression
Hey man, but please remain faithful for you
See the eyes, they see your lies

Remember your insane
Nothing will remain
Fortune is away

There's nothing left to say
There's nothing left to say
There's nothing left to say
There's nothing left to say
There's nothing left to say
