Face to face with rumors
Far away from the truth
All believe in media tumors
They make their money with lies

Fading spreading opinions are enough for a written fact
Fear, fright and doubt by word attack

I swear that I have strength for all
I swear that I have strength for the truth
May you too?

Fairy tales makes you mad
Only danger, everything is strange
Find new self-confidence
Proof the media insanity

Fading spreading opinions are enough for a written fact
Fear, fright and doubt by word attack

I swear that I have strength for all
I swear that I have strength for the truth
May you too?

Fading spreading opinions are enough for a written fact
Fear, fright and doubt by word attack

I swear that I have strength for all
I swear that I have strength for the truth
May you too?
