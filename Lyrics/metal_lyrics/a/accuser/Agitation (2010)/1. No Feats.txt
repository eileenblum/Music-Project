Take care what they tell, they read between the lines
The truth happens fast before we know who we are
See violence on the streets and symbols at the walls
They burning down my home and start the endless fall

Enemy they called us
We are the stone, they are the paper, wrap around
Stranger they called us
We are the wood, they are the fire, never understood

I heard the lies, I closed my eyes
But the nightmare was the truth

No remains of common sense
No remains no feats at all

Liberty, where is it ?
We are the mouse, they are the trap,
Into which we stepped
Friendship, where is it 7
We were all the same up to one day,
Now differences they pray

I heard the lies, I closed my eyes
But the nightmare was the truth

No remains of common sense
No remains no feats at all

Broken glass, hateful mass, disease of all,
Let them fall, no feats at all

The sky is burning red the day of hope away
The building of violence is born out of spite
Persecution without common sense
And no mercy anymore
We can't change the history
But we have to change the present day

Enemy they called us
We are the stone, they are the paper, wrap around
Stranger they called us
We are the wood, they are the fire, never understood

I heard the lies, I closed my eyes
But the nightmare was the truth

No remains of common sense
No remains no feats at all
No remains of common sense
No remains no feats at all
