Generated answer, never heard before
Unexpected questions, they say nothing more

Blackening politics, without interrupt
Preaching lunatics, waiting bloody trap

Wall of death, wall of blood
Barbed wire without hope, barbed wire no escape
You fought for truth - remind yourself - criminal solution
You fought for peace - remind yourself - criminal solution

Strike the men away, who have the final say
New awakening power, no more scary hour

Convicted innocence, disturbed confidence
Close the book of torture, no more bloody fortune

Wall of death, wall of blood
Barbed wire without hope, barbed wire no escape
You fought for truth - remind yourself - criminal solution
You fought for peace - remind yourself - criminal solution

Say no. Fall out
Don't throw yourself away for a little piece of power
Say no. Fall out
Don't throw yourself away for a little piece of power

You fought for truth - remind yourself - criminal solution
You fought for peace - remind yourself - criminal solution
You fought for truth - remind yourself - criminal solution
You fought for peace - remind yourself - criminal solution
