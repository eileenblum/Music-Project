Thoughts full of hate
Joy in the pain of the others
Required of faith
Torment sisters and brothers
Invent a new truth
But we don t need old lies

King will come to give a sign
King will come to start his crime
He take control for helpless souls
King south is near respect no tear
Forget your hope you can not cope
Don't try to win against the bleeding sin

March into the death
For more power and possession
Sacrificed their lives
So that the crown remains
He rules the roost of power
And start damnation of south

King will come to give a sign
King will come to start his crime
He take control for helpless souls
King south is near respect no tear
Forget your hope you can not cope
Don't try to win against the bleeding sin

Don't miscalculate
The way on your thin path
A throne build on lies
Glashouse of destiny
Dictatorships find an end
Suffocating government

King will come to start his crime
He take control for helpless souls
King south is near respect no tear
Forget your hope you can not cope
Don't try to win against the bleeding sin
