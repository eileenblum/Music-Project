Terminate yourself, repeat will not exist
Live modestly and leave the past behind you

Destroy, enjoy, we play with the planet toy
We stand, we fall, we have to save us all

Spread your wings and fly, before the whole world dies
But where you want to go, if there is nothing more?

You can't find a way and don't stop mistakes
You can't give up your way of life, you step into your deepest dive

Strange change

There is no escape, no solution, no shape
We all breathe the same air, to late for all our care

You can't find a way and don t stop mistakes
You can't give up your way of life, you step into your deepest dive

Strange change

Industrial revolution, economical business
Never found a solution, but some of us richness

Destroy, enjoy, we play with the planet toy
We stand, we fall, we have to save us all

Spread your wings and fly, before the whole world dies
But where you want to go, if there is nothing more?

Strange change falling century
Strange change falling century
Falling century, falling century
