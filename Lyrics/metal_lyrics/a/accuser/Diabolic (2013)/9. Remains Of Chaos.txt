Insecure existence
Not enough resistance
The invisible hostile
Clones itself meanwhile

Epidemic
Pandemic

Remains of chaos
All lives have to die
Remains of chaos
All lives have to die
All lives have to die

Time to face destiny
Beyond remedy
There is only one reality
Imperative mortality

Epidemic
Pandemic

Remains of chaos
All lives have to die
Remains of chaos
All lives have to die
All lives have to die

Important things get trivial
Before we fall into the abyss
But no more chance for changes
No chance to rectify the world

Epidemic
Pandemic

Remains of chaos
All lives have to die
Remains of chaos
All lives have to die
All lives have to die
