Fight, for revenge, for honnor, on the front
Fallen comrades lie around
Kill for your land, others die by your hand
No end is sight, hopeless plight

Legacy - full of hate, legacy - no change to await
Enemy - will always be, enemy - no liberty

Endless spiral, no survival, endless story, death and glory

Immortal aggression

Old history, refreshed by present conflicts
No reprieve, no truce
Trigger can be small but it'e enough to kill them all
Scars of years are too deep

Legacy - full of hate, legacy - no change to await
Enemy - will always be, enemy - no liberty

Endless spiral, no survival, endless story, death and glory

Immortal aggression

Hate, blind hate, aggressors see no mate
Fire against fire, the flames will getting higher
Year by year, the endless growing fear
Terror, just terror, a never ending error

Eye for an eye, no one, no one cry
Hate, fucking hate, it's too late

Legacy - full of hate, legacy - no change to await
Enemy - will always be, enemy - no liberty

Endless spiral, no survival, endless story, death and glory

Immortal aggression
