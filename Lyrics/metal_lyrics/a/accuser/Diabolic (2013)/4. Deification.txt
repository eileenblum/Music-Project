Godless, faithless, senseless
You search for another way
Hero, achiever, believer
You are not impressible

Dark, sinister appearance
Set your senses on fire
Trapped, amorous, dependent
Your whole life destined by strange hands

Trapped to believe
Craved to recieved

Deification, transformation
Deification, deformation

Without personnal opinion
Far away from yourself
Every move is controlled
Act like a puppet on strings

Identity is away
You're the slave you never would be
The goddess who you deify
Is your dark force of impact

Trapped to believe
Craved to recieved

Deification, transformation
Deification, deformation

This is no faith
Nothing more in empty space
This is no hope
It's better for you to be alone

Trapped to believe
Craved to recieved

Deification, transformation
Deification, deformation
