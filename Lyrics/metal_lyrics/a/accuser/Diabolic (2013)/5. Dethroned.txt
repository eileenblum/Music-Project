You, you're the master of all
You, you'll rise against the wall
Threats, you don't care about
Prey, capteured from the crowd

Bring down
Bring down

Dethroned, and disowned, dethroned
The follower gets better
Dethroned, and disownde, dethroned
We decide the matter
The follower gets better
We bring you down

New follower, reigns our land
All decisions in one hand
His power is getting higher
The crowd pulls on one wire

Bring down
Bring down

Dethroned, and disowned, dethroned
The follower gets better
Dethroned, and disownde, dethroned
We decide the matter
The follower gets better
We bring you down

Down, we bring you down, down, we bring you down

Hey follower you liar, it's the same shit like before
Hey follower you liar, we're oppressed more and more
Fuck the systeme of violence, repetition with no end
Fuck the systeme of violence, freedom for our land

Dethroned, and disowned, dethroned
The follower gets better
Dethroned, and disownde, dethroned
We decide the matter
The follower gets better
We bring you down

Down
