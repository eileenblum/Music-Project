Promised of the priest
Rises from the grave
Protected on earth
Blessed for the sky

Save, save
Let the hall work for you
Your fairy tales are so true
You are the son, the promise one

Save your legend

Preach to your believers you are true
Your mystery reigns for you
Blood will spill, solution kills

Save your legend

Church commands
Kingdom will end
Desperate struggle
Nation in trouble

Save, save
Let the hall work for you
Your fairy tales are so true
You are the son, the promise one

Save your legend

Preach to your believers you are true
Your mystery reigns for you
Blood will spill, solution kills

Save your legend

Condemned to death
Terminal breath
Rotting priest
Goes to the beast

Save, save
Let the hall work for you
Your fairy tales are so true
You are the son, the promise one

Save your legend

Preach to your believers you are true
Your mystery reigns for you
Blood will spill, solution kills

Save your legend
Save your legend
Save your legend
Save your legend
