Paralyzed, agonized, by fright, fear and hate
Curiosity, satisfied, but i can't took away
I pick you up and we go around
To suffer in the hellish place
I close my eys and hope for lies
But my dreams are coming true

World wide violence
World wide violence
World wide violence
World wide violence

Deceit and lie, dupery and crime
Sacrifice, everywhere
Everything is taken, nothing is given
Spreading distrust
Scary hour, all the time
Violence without repentance
You can count on nothing, it's the brutal truth
The reflection of mankind

World wide violence
World wide violence
World wide violence
World wide violence

Hate and fear, nothing is clear
We can't see our hostile
Untouchable devil in disguise
Leaves broken hearts and souls
Distance and grayness
Justified no pain
Pay your price and realize
We are flesh and blood

World wide violence
World wide violence
World wide violence
World wide

World wide violence
