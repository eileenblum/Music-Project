We love our hell
Decay and death as well
Destruction all around
Hope can not be found

Self conviction
Self addiction
Self conviction
Self addiction

Apocalyptic decay
Apocalyptic decay

We long for the life
But it causes only death
So it shall be well
All evil hurts itself

Self conviction
Self addiction
Self conviction
Self addiction

Apocalyptic decay
Apocalyptio decay

Suicidal insanity
Survival misery

Feel the source of hell
Death you hear and smell
Destruction do you see
All your senses bleed

Self conviction
Self addiction
Self conviction
Self addiction

Apocalyptic decay
Apocalyptic decay
