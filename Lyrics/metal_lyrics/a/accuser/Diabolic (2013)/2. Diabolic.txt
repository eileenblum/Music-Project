Time goes by, nothing changes, the evil shall rule the world
Torment brain, goes insane, no view of recovery
Petrified by medusa's eyes, paralysed, apparent death
Stand up before it's too late, but we change into stone

Time, time, time goes by
Stop, stop, the clock or die

Diabolic, heaven or hell
Diabolic, decision farewell
Diabolic, possessed by lie
Diabolic, we all shall die

Leprosy society, cohesion is falling apart
The ennemy of liberty will catch us all
Fight the dark and see the light, come together against the night
But the time isn't on your side, because the clock is right

Time, time, time goes by
Stop, stop, the clock or die

Diabolic, heaven or hell
Diabolic, decision farewell
Diabolic, possessed by lie
Diabolic, we all shall die

Do or die
Who or why

The clock runs fast, the die is cast, we are beyond remedy
Prepare to die, don't ask why, the writing is on the wall

Time, time, time goes by
Stop, stop, the clock or die

Diabolic, heaven or hell
Diabolic, decision farewell
Diabolic, possessed by lie
Diabolic, we all shall die

Diabolic
Diabolic
DIabolic
Die
