Thoughts are in my brain
Dark, cold ,alone
My mind goes insane
Slowly, creeping, mad

Dark terror against my sanity
Dark terror against my humanity

Devoid, destroy, unsaid words inside
Devoid, destroy, unsaid words inside

I am beyond the blackness
I am beyond the blackness
I am beyond the blackness
I am beyond the blackness

Shadow are in my soul
Dark, deep inside
Blackness fills mu day
Nothing lead to nothing

Dark terror against my sanity
Dark terror against my humanity

Devoid, destroy, unsaid words inside
Devoid, destroy, unsaid words inside

I am beyond the blackness
I am beyond the blackness
I am beyond the blackness
I am beyond the blackness

Soul is in a maze
Confused, strays in all ways
I hope I'll wake up
To see the light and the end

Dark terror against my sanity
Dark terror against my humanity

Devoid, destroy, unsaid words inside
Devoid, destroy, unsaid words inside

I am beyond the blackness
I am beyond the blackness
I am beyond the blackness
I am beyond the blackness

Beyond the blackness
Beyond the blackness
Beyond the blackness
