30 years of getting up from bed
30 years he's punctual at work

Dirty years in a dark factory
30 years in trouble day by day

He's a victim of his time - He's got to carry it out
He never did something wrong

In the morning hear the chairman say
Too old to work - Go your own way

The final act - Release out of life
Too old to live - too young to die

The situation of this man - The situation ain't new
The little are to blame - The big are not to

Down - Down, down by law - Down by law...

Chanceless search - responsibility
Antisocial - outlaws of society

His mind is changing - from white to black
One decision - There ain't no way back

He's a victim of his time - He's got to carry it out
He never did something wrong

Down - Down, down by law - Down by law...

No doubt about it - looking for revenge
Blow up the walls - The walls of forgotten names

[Solo]

The end of the story - They caught him like a thief
No one who supports him - No one would believe
He is down - Down by law...

For years sent to prison - To live in daily fear
But the men of justice - Released him after years
He is down - Down by law...

His sincered pride was broken - Not to be repaired
The rumour of justice - Destroy it everywhere
He is down - Down by law...

His wife and children down on their knees
At school they say: Children of the beast
No way out - Out of misery
Only dreaming - The dream of harmony

The situation of this man - The situation ain't new
The little are to blame - The big are not to

Down - Down, down by law - Down by law...
