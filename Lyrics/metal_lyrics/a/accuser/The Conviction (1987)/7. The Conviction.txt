Heaven send - touch of death
Takes from you - living breath
Thunder crashes - flames of fire
Lost in hell - no escape

The loosers of the granted life, in savage grace of hell
Guilty in case of genocide, no special providence

Witness of the funeral
Committed crimes - you're to blame
Now you're bound for the conviction

Master of recovery
Dealer of insanity
Now you're bound for the conviction

You exist - name of god
In god you trust - that's your fault
Rising stormes - across the world
Flood will come - to blank out sin

Wasted land, histories end, walking corpses on infected ground
The terrible captivity remains of paradise
Where glory covered blooded grounds, was built on lies

Dust to dust, souls to hell, no survival, god's revenge
Lucifer kept watching you for eternal pain
No mercy for the innocent - or is deafness an excuse

Waves of blood - sliding ground
Underneath - rest in peace
Watch the damned - face to face
Time is standing still - overkill

The loosers of the granted life, in savage grace of hell
Guilty in case of genocide, no special providence

Witness of the funeral
Committed crimes - you're to blame
Now you're bound for the conviction

Master of recovery
Dealer of insanity
Now you're bound for the conviction
