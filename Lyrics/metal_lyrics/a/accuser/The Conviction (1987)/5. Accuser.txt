Everybody's reaching for personal success
Monkey business, cheated deals, bloody fuckin' mess
All this glitter luxury, the lurking lustful sin
Deaf and foolish longing for perfect immunity

Beyond the clouds of vice, the legend of the earth
Strangled by itself, planets even die

The rain that fell a million years, a blessing in disguise
Has turned to red - but it ain't bad if I close my eyes
Lucky on my rubbish-heap, infected living ground
Air pollution - I don't care, I got my gas mask

Beyond the clouds of vice, the legend of the earth
Strangled by itself, planets even die

Accuser: -tear the maskerade away
Accuser: -don't wait 'til judgement day
Blinded by the evil hare, the fog of ignorance
Destruction is the destiny, (it) can't be the world's command

Living in equality where everything is justified
Stop telling lies 'bout tortured men, look at me, I'm free
Hunger, pain and dying kids, somewhere else but here
It seams far away, I can't hear the pray,
Maybe they're born to loose

Beyond the clouds of vice, the legend of the earth
Strangled by itself, planets even die

Accuser: -tear the maskerade away
Accuser: -don't wait 'til judgement day
Blinded by the evil hare, the fog of ignorance
Destruction is the destiny, (it) can't be the world's command

The world kept turning round, you've had the time to learn
But now it's reached the point of no return

Militaries think about how to prevent a war
The final view of cutted sense, controlling holocaust
The crazy dreams of blinded guys, tend to suicide
What in hell we're fighting for, it's a damned price

Scientists of horror visions, high in intelligence
Corrupted sharks of politics - high finance
Electronic killer systems, nuclear overdose
Space invasion out of hell, here we go!

Wake up you dead, it's up to you
To rule the earth in your own way
No compromise in future times
No mercy to, to the accused
