1938 - Year of hate
The leader took his place - The world's fate
- live and let die...

1945 - Millions died
In command of law - The world cried
- live and let die...

Fight to be free - Fight for ideology
Killing's insane - Just far a damaged brain
You got no rights - Just have to fight - Law of war
You see no sense - Kill for defence - Law of war

1988 - Atomic war
No more human race - No more
- live and let die...

Fight to be free - Fight for ideology
Killing's insane - Just far a damaged brain
You got no rights - Just have to fight - Law of war
You see no sense - Kill for defence - Law of war

[Solo]

Sacrify the war - It's suicide
Let it not come true - The final night
- die and let die...

Brainless march in centuries
Soldiers are the world's disease
They got no rights - Just have to fight - Law of war
They see no sense - Kill for defence - Law of war
