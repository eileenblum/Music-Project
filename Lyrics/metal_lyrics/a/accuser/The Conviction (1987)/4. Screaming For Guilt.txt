Some years ago nobody knew
What future would bring
Somebody heard from somewhere
'bout evil things

The new plague of modern times
No difference who is who
It's ally calles "Creeping Death"
Staring at you

Pain and torture - Hunting and screaming for guilt
Pain and torture - Dangerzone
Pain and torture - Nowhere to hide in the dark
Pain and torture - Nightmare

Loving for money, love with your honey
Bisexuality
Things of emotion, turned to destruction
That's reality

Pain and torture - Hunting and screaming for guilt
Pain and torture - Dangerzone
Pain and torture - Nowhere to hide in the dark
Pain and torture - Nightmare

[Solo]

A social diseas, a private desaster
Shocked society
Love's not forbidden, passports are written
Show ypur identity

Pain and torture - Hunting and screaming for guilt
Pain and torture - Dangerzone
Pain and torture - Nowhere to hide in the dark
Pain and torture - Nightmare
