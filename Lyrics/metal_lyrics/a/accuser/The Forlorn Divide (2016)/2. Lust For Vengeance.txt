Mankind is bleeding
From self-inflicted wounds
Yet we're proceeding
To lacerate until it is time ... to ... pay

Pay for the conflicts
That stem from ignorance
A lack of knowledge
Brings forth intolerance
We see them growing
Dark roots of endless strife
Though long forgotten
Their seed keeps all hate and fear alive

Determined to persist
Two foes of same descent
Unable to resist
A war that will never end
Determined to release
Disaster on our kin
Unable to find peace
A lust for vengeance deep within

No hesitation
In decimating life
Facing damnation
This path lets no one return

Another battle
Defiling sacred grounds
Compassion trampled
By rage that knows no bounds
How many decades
Wasted on senseless fights?
For domination but loss
Dominates both sides

Determined to persist
Two foes of same descent
Unable to resist
A war that will never end
Determined to relive
Moments of deep contempt
Unable to forgive
The pain that will never mend

Determined to persist
Two foes of same descent
Unable to resist
A war that will never end
Determined to release
Disaster on our kin
Unable to find peace
A lust for vengeance deep within

Desperate retaliation call
Suffering from damage done
Desperate to end eternity
Suffering will spare no one
Restlessness as long as life remains
Haunted by impulse
Tortured by pressure
Punishing immortal wrath

[Solo: Rybakowski]

Mankind keeps bleeding
As time keeps passing by
Yet we're proceeding
To lacerate until it is time

Time ... to ... die
