Heads will roll again
Blood flows like the rain
No one changes course
Flesh burns on the cross

Flow ... flow of dying ...
Arisen from hate and lying
Flow ... flow of dying ...
Endless crying endless dying ......
Grace of death

First seduction then refusal
For the priest it is unusual

Revenge

Pride ... wounded pride
In flames, she will die

Flow ... flow of dying ...
Arisen from hate and lying
Flow ... flow of dying ...
Endless crying endless dying ......
Grace of death

Timeless ... always ... trouble ... no salvation
Strained ... pander ... teased ... dying soul
Terror ... violence ... raped ... dismissed ... offend
Outlaw ... victim ... witch ... unprotected

Senseless ... always ... conflict ... no salvation
Branded ... dirty ... slut ... dying soul
Terror ... violence ... raped ... dismissed ... offend
Outlaw ... victim ... witch ... unprotected ...
Pyre infected ... funeral pyre ... burn

Infernal genesis
Rising heresy
Ignited millions of witches
Burning heretic

Blood flows like the rain
Flesh burns on the cross

Infernal genesis
Rising heresy
Ignited millions of witches
Burning heretic
Die
