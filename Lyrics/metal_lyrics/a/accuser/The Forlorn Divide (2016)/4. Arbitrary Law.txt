Burn as a funeral pyre
Your last desire
You lost the faith in right
Hell is what you decide
Self immolation
Policy damnation
Resulting fears
A tribe with bloody tears ... A tribe with bloody tears

Law ... arbitrary law
It is a sinister sign
I can not see the end of the line

Swear to take revenge
No satisfactory judgment
The rapist feels my rage
My hate is my instructor
A shot in the courtroom
Shortens the grief of the culprit
The act of killing is done
But my deep sorrow remains ... my deep sorrow remains

Law ... arbitrary law
It is a sinister sign
I can not see the end of the line

Rage ... is what you feel
You mold all your thoughts to heal your soul with revenge
Fallacy ... it changes nothing
You will feel the pain 'til the end of your days
Sorrow ... the endless sorrow
Death ... comes as release ...
but for whom?

[Solo: Rybakowski]

Preach ... the statute book
Oblivion ... sacrificial blood

[Solo: Rybakowski]

Law ... law ... law ... arbitrary ... law ... law ... law ... arbitrary law ... arbitrary law
