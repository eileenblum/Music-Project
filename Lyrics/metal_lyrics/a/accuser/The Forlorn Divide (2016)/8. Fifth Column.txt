Controlled by a piece of poetry
Manipulated by an unseen force
Subversion is the only destination
Brainwashed to receive programmed orders

Fifth column
Silent command
Wake up to obey

Tools for change
Suicide assassins
Stir up a new strife
Planned operating life

Fifth column
Silent command
Wake up to obey

Obey ...

[Solo: Thoms/Rybakowski]

You never ask you never know
Your whole life is written down
You tool of ideology
Never touch the ground

Fifth column
Silent command
Wake up to obey
