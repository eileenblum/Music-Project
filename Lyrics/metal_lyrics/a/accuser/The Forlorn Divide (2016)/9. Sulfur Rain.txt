Life goes down
No turn around
Thoughts are clear
New life is near

Programmed to die
No exception no lie
Dust to dust
The rest will fly

Brain transplantation
Eternal generation

Humanity insane ... respect ...
You'll never win the game ... expect
Humanity insane ... respect nature's aim
You'll never win the game ... expect sulfur rain

Deathlessness serum
Eternity to buy
There's no room on earth
Millions have to die
Disposed executions
Ensures air to breathe
Reduction of masses
For the surviving elite

Brain transplantation
Eternal generation

Humanity insane ... respect ...
You'll never win the game ... expect
Humanity insane ... respect nature's aim
You'll never win the game ... expect sulfur rain

[Solo: Thoms/Rybakowski/Thoms/Rybakowski]

Bloodline devastation
No roots no derivation
Endless life but why?
I hope again to die
Like dust, I want to fly
Until the rain pulls me down

Sulfur rain ... sulfur rain ... sulfur rain ... sulfur rain
