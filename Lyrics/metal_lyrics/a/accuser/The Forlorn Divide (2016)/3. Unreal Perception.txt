I'll lose my senses I'll lose my soul
Until my whole sanity is beyond control
I live in several worlds I can not go for one
Delusion is reality or is it converse?

Unreal perception
Unknown direction
Unreal perception
Untold deception

I feel vibrations behind myself
Different voices fill my ears
I am not alone dispassion is gone
Please bring me down - down to earth

Relentless
Distraction

Unreal perception
Unknown direction
Unreal perception
Untold deception

[Solo: Rybakowski/Thoms]

I see the world with different eyes
Another comprehension but I see all lies

My schizophrenia is media mania
My schizophrenia is media mania
My schizophrenia is media mania
My schizophrenia is media mania
