Rise ... Deliverance ...

Rise of the urge
The evil in man the rogue blood
Deliverance from brain jail
Psychological demon darkness breaks out

Crush all hope
Cut the rope

Prepare for the worst
Corpus commands by violent minds

Far away from impending doom
Unaware of impending doom

Nail ... Malicious ...

Nail down the coffin
That's not enough to stop the forces of evil
Malicious inside
Outside Nosferatu thirst for blood

Crush all hope
Cut the rope

Refuse to believe
The book of fairy tales is closed by the brutal ... truth

[Solo: Rybakowski]

Blood ... blood ... blood ... blood ... blood ... blood ... blood ... blood ...

[Solo: Rybakowski]

Suck the red rain
And feel no shame
Feel the fire
Your blood desires
Blood is your elixir of life
Life and death evermore

Evermore ... evermore ... evermore ... evermore
