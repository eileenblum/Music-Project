Woke up in the darkness
Silence fraught with menace
The body full of blood
The deed laced in malice

Alone ... afraid ...
Forlorn ... betrayed

Perish by oblivion
Perish by oblivion

Belief in deliverance lost
Perfect indignity
No more courage no more trust
No possibility

Alone ... afraid
Forlorn ... betrayed

Perish by oblivion
Perish by oblivion

[Solo: Rybakowski]

Alone ... afraid
Forlorn ... betrayed

Trapped in a dungeon?
Trapped in dreams?
Is now the time to die?
Is nothing like it seems?

Help ...

Woke up in the darkness
Woke up in the darkness
Woke up in the darkness
Woke up in the darkness

Perish by oblivion
Perish by oblivion
Perish by oblivion
