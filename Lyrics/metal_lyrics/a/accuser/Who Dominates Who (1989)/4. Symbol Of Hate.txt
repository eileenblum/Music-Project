Of Germany, not far away
Behind the prison wall

On your way to West Berlin
You cross the GDR
The country of equality
As well as black and white
No one wants to leave this paradise
Must be heaven on earth
But I never saw an angel
With a machine gun I in a watch tower

Hey you people behind the wall
Just hear me call
Blow up the symbol of hate
It's your fate
So don't wait
To blow up the symbol of hate

Mr. Honecker hear me call
I'm knocking on your heaven's wall

Hey you people behind the wall
Just hear me call
Blow up the symbol of hate
It's your fate
So don't wait
To blow up the symbol of hate

Have you ever heard about
The people in the east
Of Germany, not far away
Behind the prison wall

Just be quiet, don't talk too loud
S.T.A.S.I. is watching you
The human rights, far out of reach
But it's worth to fight it out
I'm sure there must be something wrong
With your socialistic dream
'Cause no one is allowed to wake up
The nightmare never ends

Hey you people behind the wall
Just hear me call
Blow up the symbol of hate
It's your fate
So don't wait
To blow up the symbol of hate

Hey you people behind the wall
Just hear me call
Blow up the symbol of hate
It's your fate
So don't wait
To blow up the symbol of hate
