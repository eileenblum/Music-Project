Having breakfast at the pool
Another boring day
What's the matter with the world
Crying just for peace
Taking care of business
War for sale
Rebellion is his fad
Nowhere in this fucking world crisis looming
Ghaddy don't fall asleep

Calling all around the world
Some fascist friends
Wake up boys my new supply
A challenge for attack
For your protection or self satisfaction
Try chemical offence
And if you wanna practice
I deliver factories
Made in Germany

Master of disaster
Countdown for showdown
Master of disaster
You set the world on fire
Master of disaster
The world wants you to retire

High financial underground
Dreg of society
Selling toys for a game of war
Licensed to kill
To celebrate military overturns
Includes corrupted minds
Heading to the final deal
It's the joker's turn
Protection from the rear

Master of disaster
Countdown for showdown
Master of disaster
You set the world on fire
Master of disaster
The world wants you to retire

Having breakfast at the pool
Another boring day
He's part of establishment
Clean to tip of toe
Taking care of business
War for sale
Rebellion is his fad
Somewhere in this fucking world crisis looming
Ghaddy you're awake

Master of disaster
Countdown for showdown
Master of disaster
You set the world on fire
Master of disaster
The world wants you to retire
