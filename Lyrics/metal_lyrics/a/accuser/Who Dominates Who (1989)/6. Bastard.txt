Arousing my attention
A little bit of fluff
Under your spell
I'm hooked on you

You, image of goddess
I'm nutty on your sex
What a skirt

Raising my obsession
Under her command
Hell bent for love
You suck my brain

I'm addicted to your body
Don't stop my nasty urge
She's hot stuff

Bastard, you bastard
Damned child of a bitch
Bastard, you bastard
You knocked me out at once

Keen on satisfaction
You make the best of me
Strip me to skin
Smashed up by you

Dressed by Yves Saint Laurent
Rings from Tiffany
Hard stuff

Bastard, you bastard
Damned child of a bitch
Bastard, you bastard
Get off, you waste my time

Captured by your radiating power
Good looking devil in disguise
Baby I'm sure you stick at nothing
But I won't kick the bucket, you bet
Baby, now I've got your number
It's time for you to cut and run
Devil, devil in disguise

A man of reputation
Now sucking my thumb
Come off your perch
Perfidious rat

You bring me into derision
With your slanderous tongue
Fuck off

Bastard, you bastard
Damned child of a bitch
Bastard, you bastard
You knocked me out at once
Bastard, you bastard
Damned child of a bitch
Bastard, you bastard
Get off, you waste my time
