Glory to the judge
Glory but not too much
Honor to the man of confidence
Honor to the lord of ignorance

You are called
To the bench
You decide
God bless you all

You're the law untouchable
As God's your judge or not
You're the law invincible
The conviction guilty or not

You are called
To the bench
You decide
God bless you all

Blinded dogmatic rule
Blinded dogmatic fool
Inconspicuous covered by the law machinery
Simulate the sense of justice beyond legality
Liar show your face
Liar the world's disgrace
What in hell you think you are
You live and let die
Out of your seat get in the dock
We want you to cry

Well known as leader 1935
He was the terminator
Command of violence
No more pricks of conscience
Covered by the law
Built up the reign of terror
Millions bite the dust

You are called
To the bench
You decide
God bless you all

Glory to the judge
Glory but not too much
You're the law invincible
The conviction guilty or not

Honor to the man of confidence
Honor to the lord of ignorance
