Doesn't matter where you are
No border stops the plague
Doesn't matter who you are
It's a social disease

Connections all around the world
To handle shady deals
Sector of economy
A big increase of trade

Who pulls the wire
Stirs up your desire

First it is a case of courage
The pusher's charity
At last a case of suicide
Price of curiosity

Holiday in Saint Tropez
Pretty girls suck his dick
Don't crack the superstar
Of the drug mafia

Who pulls the wire
Stirs up your desire

Cut the wire
Slays your brain
Cut the wire
The stranglehold
Cut the wire
Breaks your spin
Cut the wire
Dealers crime

It's up to you show confidence
Otherwise you are lost
To resist temptation
Needs strength in mind

Who pulls the wire
Stirs up your desire
