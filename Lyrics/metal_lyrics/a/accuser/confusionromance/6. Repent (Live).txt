Repent!

Messenger
Sanctified at your birth
Ordained by fate
Be worthy of your might

Halleluia, hail the holy man
Who by right , divine right
Gives the command to kneel down
Pay your tithe
And then repent

You sinners, repent
You sinners, repent

Hell lies in the heart
Purge your spirit free
No refuge in the church
Swindlers cry "REPENT!"

Messenger
Self proclaimed prophet
Blackening hearts
While cloaked in sacred white

Resist the call to hatred
By holy men
Intolerant
Your prophets speak of peace on earth
Tolerance is
Unconditional

You sinners, repent
You sinners, repent

Hell lies in the heart
Faith appears in waves
No refuge in the church
In solitude repent

Hell lies in the heart
Purge your spirit free
No refuge in the church
Swindlers cry "REPENT!"

Angels fall
Night shining in their breath
Haunting your dreams
Awakening dark desires

The messenger will claim your soul
Beware his kiss
Serpent's lips
Evil within angelic skin
Poison plasma
Body and blood

[Ref.:]
Hell lies in the heart
Purge your spirit free
No refuge in the church
Oh holy man repent
