Beyond my crasp
Methods of attack
Images swallowed up
Power erupts
Midnight madness
Confusion romance
When you 're gone
Nothing is done

[Ref.:]
Confusion romance call it an age
Peace is where's more than romance
If I hurt at all I hurt alone
War is where's no lip control
Questions -laced with clues
I've seen loosers, mirrors of fools
Morbid letters home
Too many jerks beating their bones

[Ref.:]
Confusion romance
Tired of feeling, feeling so close
Tired of being used and abused
I 'm not the comrade you thought I`d be
Don't feel like hazel, hazel on the beach
Now!
Or never!
Visions gone blind
Empty inside
Images swallowed up
Power erupts
Turning to hope
In this moment of need
Sick of tourists
Time is what I need

[Ref.:]
Confusion romance
