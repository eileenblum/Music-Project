Silence nothing
More to be said
Words are useless
Now, today

CanÂ´t cover doubts
With explanations
ItÂ´s a hate yourself
Situation

Braincells fight
An endless fight
Thougts are useless
Now, today

Why cover fear
With self confidence
Self destruction
Self defence

[Ref.]
ItÂ´s a damn trip
Leading you
Right into
Into the void

No more fight
In my head
Thougts do not
Exist today

Void - damn trip
Void - get used to it
Void [6x]

Last week I
Cut off my tongue
Guess I should
Accept my fate

Noâ¦..fear noâ¦..confidence

[Ref.]

ThereÂ´s no fear
No confidence
ItÂ´s the fascist
Rising in yourself
