Ask me why I care
As no one seems to care
Ask me why I try
As no one seems to try

Ask me something
I havenÂ´t heard before
Show me the face
I havenÂ´t seen before

[Ref.]
I am alive
Are you alive ?
I am alive, are you alive ?
I am alive, are you alive ?

Just be cause you donÂ´t believe in god
DonÂ´t mean you believe in the devil
Convince me that I needed authority
YouÂ´ll never convince me of anything

DonÂ´t feel like beeing addicted
DonÂ´t feel like being forced to obey
DonÂ´t feel like beeing addicted
Guess I found my way

[Ref.]
I am alive
Are you alive ?
I am alive, are you alive ?
I am alive, are you alive ?

Ask my why
Why I care
As no one
Seems to care
Ask me why
I still try
Live your life is sin
You will never learn

[Ref.]
I am alive
Are you alive ?
I am alive, are you alive ?
I am alive, the jack of all trades
