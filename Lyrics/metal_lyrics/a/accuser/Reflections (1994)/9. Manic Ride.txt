Board up all your windows
Theyâre after you and theyâll get you
You canât stop the world and get off
Get off this manic ride

You know their time is here

To breed their brand of fear

You look into their eyes
And try to be sincere
âI never meant to hurt you
Please donât punish me
Save me, save me!

Hooked to a blood-machine
Youâre trapped til you stop to breathe
Something has to be done
So youâre digging for bones
Days racing by
A long forgotten thought is falling deep
Inside
Time bomb in your head
Guillotine blades are falling in your head
âWhat the reason?â you shout
âI cannot survive with the whole world on
My backâ
Youâve been warned and you know
That no one will refill the hole thatâs in
Your head
All your words remain unsaid
Digging digging a hole
They fill it with your bones
You awake from your dreams
And rest in peace
