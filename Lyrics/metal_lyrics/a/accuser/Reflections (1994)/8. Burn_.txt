I can see your face, your voice
The way you used to act
I can see your clothes, good times
The trouble that we had
I buy a doll and dress her up
The way you used to dress
I make her walk
I make her talk
But her stories are not yours

I light a fire
Got to burn her
The way you
Burnt your lover
She will suffer

Everyone should burn
I take her down to the river
She doesnât hear me when I talk
I start to cry like we both cried
When promising a lot
I take her down to the river

Take her down to the grave
Of friendship and I pray
Forgive me, mother earth!
