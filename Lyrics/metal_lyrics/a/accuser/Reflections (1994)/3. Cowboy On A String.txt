I woke up last night with a pain inside
Couldnât take this madness in stride
Dead end, got myself a gun
Feel like Iâve gotta kill someone
From above you watch me stumbling
From above you watch me breaking
I know that time will be healing
The wounds of a puppet on a string

I cut the rope Iâm hanging from
Hanging from my motherâs tongue
Cut the rope and cut my wings
Iâm a cowboy n a string

Bye, bye!
Scare me to death fool me again
In this game that never ends
Keep me hanging by a thread
Iâve reached an end that never ends
Wanna be free
Wanna be me
Thanks fr your sympathy
Wanna be free
Wanna be me
Keep your fucking sympathy
Waiting, wanting and wondering why
Thereâs just my own shadow by my side
Marching towards the end of the line
Mother will hear
The gunshot tonight
