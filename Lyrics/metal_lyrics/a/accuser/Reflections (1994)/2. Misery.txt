Getting nervous at the edge
Where itÂ´s getting cold
We all fight for survival
WeÂ´re doing what weÂ´re told
Modern times you realize
That itÂ´s warm inside my coat

[Ref.]
And I thought that you knew
Misery
And I thought that you grew
Sympathy

Modern times you realize
That itÂ´s warm inside my coat
Everything seems to be bright
YouÂ´re doing what youÂ´re told

[Ref.]
And I thought that you knew
Misery
And I thought that you grew
Sympathy

Talk turns toward the living dead
And self created hell
Gotta kick the dog out of my front door
Before I start to bark outside

Getting nervous at the edge
Where youÂ´re growing old
Getting nervous at the edge
Where itÂ´s getting cold
Getting nervous at the edge
Til you find new hope

Helpless
Senseless
Helpless
Nervous

[Ref.]
And I thought that you knew
Misery
And I thought that you grew
Sympathy
