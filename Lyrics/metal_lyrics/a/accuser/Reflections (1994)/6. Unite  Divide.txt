Too cruel to die
You face an unknown fiend
That grew the night
You were on your knees

Unite/ divide
Be strong
Respect/ despite
Be wrong

War begins
Itâs dog eat dog again
New age crusade
A fight you will not win
You walk and fall
Youâd better swear to growl

Today youâre judge
And jury too
Someone out there
Will bleed for you
Donât hesitate
Donât shed no tear
Your next mistake
Is what your fear

Stand somedays
Nights, years on sail
Once set free
Youâll fall again
Once there was a healthy mind
Now each braincellâs too cruel to die

Some say wise men
Had nothing to fear
Neither wise nor man
So your faith disappeared
