Foolish, twisted
Egos at work
Looking for an
Excuse to destroy
Another baby born with a knife in its back
Will reach out for the mother that it never had
The rest of the boys out in the streets
Are readings stories from empty sheets
Give me my power back!
Scorched earth tomorrow
Sick earth today
Scientists dream
Of clones on parade
Armageddon
Is in their hands
Cutting short
The written plans
Snapshot of mankind
Give me my power back!
