Two ships
Warships
Rotting from within
Crew aboard
Bored
In times of peace
Dreaming up
Wars
Enemies
Purpose
For warriors
A dying breed
Ref Rust keeps creeping from the vessel's core
Bring back the myths of the patriarchs
Looking for a battle
Revival
Looking for a battle
Uniting
Looking for a battle

Two ships
Sinking
Old and atrophied
One spots
Another
Finds an enemy
Water
Seeps through
The gaps that come from age
One ship
Sinks first
One clams the victory

[Ref:]
Rust keeps creeping from the vessel's core
Bring back the myths of the patriarchs
Looking for a battle
Revival
Looking for a battle
Uniting
Looking for a battle

Pity the
Soldiers
Brought down by peace
Useless
Weapons
Farewell to arms
No heroes
Or myths
To keep wars alive
Pity
The warriors
A dying breed

[Ref]
