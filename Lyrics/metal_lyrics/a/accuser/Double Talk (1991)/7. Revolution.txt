A cry has shocked the eastern world
The cry for liberty
Uprising of the common herd
Arousing to get free
They've been suppressed too long
In the socialistic hell
Get out of this communist jail

I've told you 'bout the people
Behind the prison wall
I've told you, Mr. Honnecker
I'm knocking on your wall
You didn't hear the warning
The call for humanity
You've lulled into security, in a place of luxury

Revolution 1989
Revolution '89 - turns the world to liberty
Execution '89 - death to dictators of delusion

The year of 1989
The point of no return
Raise up your fists, don't hesitate
Blow up the prison wall
All you dictators, go to hell
Fuck off and die
We're sick of all your promises
Tired of your lies

A cry has shocked the eastern world
The cry for liberty
Uprising of the common herd
Arousing to get free
A new page of history, new chapter of mankind
The end of cruel suppression Now, you've to decide
