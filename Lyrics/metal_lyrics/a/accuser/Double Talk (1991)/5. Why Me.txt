Catastrophe and trouble, the day that I was born
Nothing but trouble in daylight, I see only night
Disaster, pain &amp; struggle, I see before my eyes
Trouble only trouble, throughout my entire life
Trouble and pain
It started when I was a young boy
I found the power to leave reality

Trouble, pain &amp; struggle, am I human or divine?
Madness is my destination
Nightmares which never end
Trouble, pain &amp; struggle, am I human or divine?

Why me? Why me?
Why me? Why me?

I couldn't understand the visions that I had
They took my innocence away from me
Why me? They call me Lucifer
Why me? They call me Devil's child

I can't stand the pain, the future is driving me insane
The world execution is just one step away
Hurry, pull the trigger, release me from agony

Why me? Why me?
Why me? Why me?

Why am I the one who has to live behind this wall of doom
I can only see trouble in this prison of insanity
I'm the one who will save your eternal light
And if you don't believe I'll snap my fingers and you're dead

Why me? They call me Lucifer
Why me? The Devil's child

You can't stop time
You can't turn it back
But if you could see the future
It would drive you mad

Why me? Why me?
Why me? Why me?
