Money, I'm spellbound by your power
Money, it was love at first feel
I have learned my lesson
Money rules the earth
You are my obsession
My wild desire

I am your slave
I don't want to exist without you
I am your slave
I sacrifice my soul for...

Money, you don't stink
But you drive me mad
Money, you don't stink
But I'm gonna loose my head

Money I wanna feel your magic touch
Money I love you overmuch
I'm loosing all my senses
Counting bucks in my hands
That's real satisfaction
Hey Baby, what's your price?

I am your slave
I don't want to exist without you
I am your slave
I sacrifice my soul for...

Money, you don't stink
But you drive me mad
Money, you don't stink
But I'm gonna loose my head

What in hell I'm longing for
What's the sense of life
I've reached the top, but all I've got
Is just what money can buy
Please send me an angel
Take the Devil right out of me
The locked me in this golden cage
Of hate'n mendacity

Money, made me a man of wealth and taste
Money, hellbound for luxury
I don't care about tomorrow
I'm living for today
Don't care 'bout the world around
Money's my security

I am your slave
I don't want to exist without you
I am your slave
I sacrifice my soul for...

Money, you don't stink
But you drive me mad
Money, you don't stink
But I'm gonna loose my head
