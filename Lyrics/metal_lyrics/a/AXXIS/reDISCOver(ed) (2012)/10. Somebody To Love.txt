[originally by Great Society / Jefferson Airplane]When the truth is found to be lies
And all the joy within you dies

[Chorus:]
Don't you want somebody to love
Don't you need somebody to love
Wouldn't you love somebody to love
You better find somebody to love

When the garden's flowers, baby, are dead
Yes, and your mind, your mind is so full of red

[Chorus]

Your eyes, I say your eyes may look like his
Yeah but in your head, baby
I'm afraid you don't know where it is

[Chorus]

Tears are running, they're all running down your breast
And your friends, baby, they treat you like a guest

[Chorus]
