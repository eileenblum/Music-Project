[originally by The Police]Just a castaway
An island lost at sea, oh
Another lonely day
No one here but me, oh
More loneliness
Any man could bear
Rescue me before I fall into despair

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah

A year has passed since I wrote my note
I should have known this right from the start
Only hope can keep me together
Love can mend your life
But love can break your heart

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my

I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah
Hoh
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah

Walked out this morning
Don't believe what I saw
A hundred billion bottles
Washed up on a shore
Seems I'm not alone at being alone
A hundred billion castaways
Lookin' for a home

I'll send an SOS to the world
I'll send an SOS to the world
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
I hope that someone gets my
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, yeah
Message in a bottle, hoh
Message in a bottle, yeah

Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
Sendin' out an SOS
