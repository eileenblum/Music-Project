[originally by Bee Gees]Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk, 
I'm a woman's manâno time to talk. 
Music loud and women warm, I've been kicked around
Since I was born. 
And now it's all right. It's OK.
And you may look the other way. 
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man.

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother, 
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin', people, 
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.

Well now, I get low and I get high,
And if I can't get either, I really try.
Got the wings of heaven on my shoes;
I'm a dancin' man and I just can't lose. 
You know it's all right. It's OK.
I'll live to see another day. 
We can try to understand
The New York Times' effect on man. 

Whether you're a brother or whether you're a mother, 
You're stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
Feel the city breakin' and everybody shakin', people, 
Stayin' alive, stayin' alive. 
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive, stayin' alive.
Ah, ha, ha, ha, stayin' alive.

Lifeâs goin' nowhere. Somebody help me.
Somebody help me, yeah. 
Lifeâs goin' nowhere. Somebody help me, yeah.
Stayin' alive.
