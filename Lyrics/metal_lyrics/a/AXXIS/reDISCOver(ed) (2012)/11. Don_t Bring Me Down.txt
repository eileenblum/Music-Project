[originally by Electric Light Orchestra]You got me runnin' goin' out of my mind
You got me thinkin' that I'm wastin' my time

Don't bring me down, no no no no no
I'll tell you once more
Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You wanna stay out with your fancy friends
I'm tellin' you it's go to be the end

Don't bring me down, no no no no no
I'll tell you once more
Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down

What happened to the girl, I used to known
You let your mind out somewhere down the road

Don't bring me down, no no no no no
I'll tell you once more
Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

You're always talkin' 'bout your crazy nights
One of these days you're gonna get it right

Don't bring me down, no no no no no
I'll tell you once more
Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down, Bruce
Don't bring me down

You're lookin' good just like a snake in the grass
One of these days you're gonna break your glass

Don't bring me down, no no no no no
I'll tell you once more
Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

Don't bring me down, no no no no no no no no
I'll tell you once more
Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down

I'll tell you once more
Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down, down, down, down, down, down

I'll tell you once more
Before I get off the floor
Don't bring me down
