Oh I feel I'm sacrificed
The full moon shadow's crawling
The crowd is hypnotised - praying for you
Oh I could hear me cry
Echoes resonate at night
My body's paralysed - By this devilish rite
Bewitched by a temptation
Bewitched by a spell
Kiss me for my salvation... way down to hell

Revelation - revelation

Blood Angel - you are my destiny
Look - I know you are real
Blood Angel - give me eternity
In the vampires garden of lust
You burn me to dust

Oh, this long awaited night
I beg to live forever
Just your bitter bite - has kept me alive
Opiated by your will
Craving for the deadly thrill
Lure me away - from death and decay

Revelation - revelation

Blood angel - you are my destiny
Look - I know you are real
Blood angel - give me eternity
I'm bleeding to death - anyway

Come taste my blood
Your virus in my veins
Pulsating like a heartbeat
But I can feel no pain
Like everlasting lovers
The night will be our day
We live one from the other
So carry my soul away

Revelation - revelation
In a long awaited night
Revelation - revelation
And I wanna feel your might

Blood angel - you are my destiny
Look - I know you are real
Blood angel - give me eternity
I'm, trapped in your garden of lust
Oh vampires lust
You burn me to dust
