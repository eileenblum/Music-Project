I don't know what I thought
In a dream when you belly dance
In the mist of Arabia

Under the shade of a roof
I'm thinking about our common ground

Dance - dance - let me fly
Dance - dance - satisfy
I - can't - get enough
Give me secrets from above

I'll be your queen
Holding the key to your paradise
I'll be your dream
In the tales of Arabian nights

You are my doom and my destiny
You are my angel in disguise
The vicious circle of my life
You are my doom and my destiny
Just take my hand - keep me alive

Show me the Garden of Eden
And heal me tonight

I don't know what I play
In a game of deliverance
To the sword of a modern crusade

Cultures clashed - clashed
Some were trashed - trashed
A new world order will arise

Sown - seeds - seeds of hate
Spread - out - fear your fate
Mad - bad - sad crusade
Sword of Islam will sharpen its blade

Down the desert sun
War, pain, kingdom come
Lost souls on the run
The paradise is gone

You are my doom and my destiny
You are my angel in disguise
Vicious circle of my life
Doom of my destiny
Take my hand - keep me alive
In the Garden of Eden
You heal me tonight

Eyes in the night wanna change you - Arabia
Eyes in the night wanna build a wall
Eyes in the night realise a utopia
The garden of Eden - will fall

Doom and my destiny
You are my angel in disguise
Vicious circle of my life
Doom and my destiny
Take my hand - keep me alive
In the Garden of Eden
You heal me tonight - heal me tonight
Doom and destiny
