Craving - craving - shadows fading
Calling - calling from afar: ...Astoria

A land
Without a borderline
This land is so divine
No territory to design

Afar
The land Astoria
For homeless and the poor
For people longing for a cure

I can take you to the land Astoria
You can touch the glory of this place
Let me take you to the foreign land, my friend
It's a great utopia
Living in euphoria
Anyplace - anywhere - it's still bizarre
Astoria

It seems to be
A dreaming fantasy
But it's reality
Astoria forever free

In truth
The people on the loose
Illusions that remain
No government - no reign

Living in this virtual state for all forgotten lifes
A nation without history - visions will revive

I can take you to the land Astoria
You can touch the glory of this place
Let me take you to the foreign land, my friend
It's a great utopia
Living in euphoria
Anyplace - anywhere - it's still bizarre
Astoria

If you think that sounds like fiction
Dream and call for this prediction - now

Craving - craving - shadows fading
Craving - craving - shadows fading
Craving - craving - shadows fading from afar

I can take you to the land Astoria
You can touch the glory of this place
Let me take you to the foreign land, my friend
It's a great utopia
Living in euphoria
No one found it so far - it's still bizarre
Astoria - Astoria - Astoria

Fight - go - generation
Way back to this land
Bright, strong mind creation
Like a wonderland
