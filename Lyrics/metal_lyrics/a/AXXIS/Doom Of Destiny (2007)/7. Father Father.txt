Father, father grant me a wish now
I will be nothing but your child - tonight

Once you saw angels flying
In the sky above our heads
They looked like pretty creatures
Staying with the dead
Hey you think - they're not evil
Why are you scared at night?
Keep your head beneath your pillow
Sh - don't make a sound!

Father, father grant me my wish now
Oh let me ride on the wings of death
I will fly with ravens scared by devotion
I will be nothing - nothing but your child - tonight

Oh - catch my breath as we're flying
Hand in hand in my dreams
Take me high - even higher
Welcome Lady Death!
Say your prayers, fallen angel
Close your eyes night by night
You shall get what you wish for
Take me with you, raven eyes
On your final ride tonight!

Father, father grant me my wish now
Oh let me ride on the wings of death
I will fly with ravens scared by devotion
Into the deepest never-ending night

Holy Father, Holy Father, please forgive my sins and deeds
Holy Father, Holy Father, please forgive my sins and deeds
Lord of mercy, will you hear me, nothing but your child...

Father, father grant me my wish now
Oh let me ride on the wings of death
I will fly with ravens scared by devotion
I will be nothing but your child
