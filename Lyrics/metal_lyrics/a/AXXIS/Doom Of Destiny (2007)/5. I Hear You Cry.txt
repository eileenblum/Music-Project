I said why!? I really don't know why?
You want me to deny
All the things we're fighting for

Right now - there's nothing left to say
You throw it all away - the passion and the good memories of our life

How am I supposed to feel?
What am I supposed to say?
Do you hear me crying through the rain?

I hear you cry - the words for lovers
I don't know why the flames still burn
I hear you cry in dreams for lovers
I don't know how - I could return
Yes and now - I'm waiting for your sign

I will pay - for all the things we've lost
I'll nail it on my cross
You burn it down with a million flames

Hell - I'm still under your spell
Don't wanna fall apart
Dive into our wishing well

Now we're standing here alone
The ruins of our love are grown
Do you hear me crying through the rain?

I hear you cry - the words for lovers
I don't know why the flames still burn
I hear you cry in dreams for lovers
I don't know how - I could return
When you cry

Do you hear me?
Can you touch me?
Let all black shadows fade
When I hold you
And I love you ...ah
Let me save you
How I crave you
Let's turn back the pages
The pages of our book of love

I can hear your crying through the rain

I hear you cry - the words for lovers
I don't know why the flames still burn
I hear you cry in dreams for lovers
I don't know how - I could return
I hear you cry - I hear you cry
