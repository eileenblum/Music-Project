Do you know what I feel
When you break the seal
Should I go? should I stay?
Decisions on my way

You're the good - I'm the bad
You don't know when I'm sad
How should I feel - while you drive me insane

Sometimes you call me devil but I feel like a fool
Now I will change my mind and I feel cool - cool
Running back to you

The devils is back - the devils all right
I won't hear your words - there's no forgiving
Beg - I don't beg for your call
The devils is back - the devils all right
Let me hear your demons crying - on my way
Down to heaven
Or way down to hell
My weak soul is easy to sell
Sweet devilish belle

Do I love? Do I hate?
Just in time? Am I late?
Turn me on and stop your masquerade

Am I wrong or right
Gimme peace but you fight
This really must be... love - love at first sight

You're an angel living with a devilish demons soul
You're my cage but now I'll change my role

Fall - I don't wanna fall

The devils is back - the devils all right
I won't hear your words there's no forgiving
Beg - I don't beg for your call
The devils is back - the devils all right
Let me hear your demons crying - on my way
Down to heaven
Way down to hell
My weak soul is easy to sell

Take - my - hand - and - let - us - go - through
All - the - passion - love is true
I - don't - hear - you - through - the - darkness
Call - me - love - hate - peace - and war

You're an angel living now with a devilish soul
You're my cage but now I'll change my role
My weak soul is easy to sell

The devils is back - the devils all right - there's no forgiving
Beg - I don't beg for your call
The devils is back - the devils all right
Let me hear your demons crying - on my way
Down to heaven
Or way down to hell
My weak soul is easy to sell
Sweet devilish belle - sweet devilish belle

Will - will - where there is a will
There's a way - there's a way out of this hell
Will - will - where there is a will
There's a way - there's a way - devilish belle
