Can't say goodbye to all my memories
And now I'm living on my own
I know times had been better - why should I cry?
So many others had to die

At night fear will overcome me
The shadows of the past will grow
Nightmarish thoughts enchain me - I feel I'm paralysed
I feel I'm being hypnotised

The fire still burns
It has taken my emotions
Oh look into my eyes
The fire still burns
I'm a drifter on this ocean to another paradise

Another spark of the Prometheus
Oh cultures clashed - my kingdom dies
The pain is hurting sometimes - why should I cry?
The world around me seems to die

The fire still burns
It has taken my emotions
Oh look into my eyes
The fire still burns
I'm a drifter on this ocean
To another paradise - paradise

Ride on the wings of heaven
See the eagles fly

Beyond the door of darkness
You'll find another world
I know the fire still burns

The fire still burns
It has taken my emotions
Oh look into my eyes
The fire still burns
I'm a drifter on this ocean to another paradise

The fire still burns
Oh there's nothing more to say
There's nothing more to pray
The fire still burns
I'm a drifter on this ocean - I found my paradise...
