Hold my hand - I set us free
Embrace my soul - just let us flee
I will show you heaven - believe in me

Could you stand the pain we feel
Promises will break the seal
The wheel of fortune still turns

And I can hear all the voices from heaven sent
I can hear all the angel-cry
I will take your hand to the seven skies
I'm your trust - your lust - let me carry your soul in another hand

You earn a better fate in a better world - away from mistrust
Living in the danger zone out in the dust
Better life in a better world - without any pain
Unfading shadows will flow away.

You don't call but I can hear
If you feel pain - so never fear!
Come into my world of everlasting peace

I will sent your dreams
And wishes to the Wailing wall
A new dimension of truth

And I can hear all the voices from heaven sent
I can hear all the angel-cry
I will take your hand to the seven skies
And I know - your soul will be mine

You earn a better fate in a better world - away from mistrust
Living in the danger zone out in the dust
Better life in a better world - without any pain
Unfading shadows will flow away - love will retain

Will you ever be mine - in the prison of time
Have you ever felt love?
Feel heaven above
Let us go into extremes
Do you know what is right?
Do you know what is wrong?
Just take my hand for so long
Could you read all my signs?
Let me read all your thoughts
I'm calling from afar

I fulfil all your dreams in the cold moonlight
Let us walk through your thoughts and your mind
There's a gate - there's a door
I will open it to surprise you right now

You earn a better fate in a better world
Living in the danger zone out in the dust
Better life in a better world - without any pain
Will flow away
Better life in a better world - believe in my trust
Better life in a better world - is calling afar
A world without shadows - a world without pain
You know our love will retain
