I got na na na na - nine lifes

She's got na na na na - nine lifes to survive

No one knows what you think
You paint your hair blue - now it's pink
Live - live - living your own way

She's a punk - debunk her parent's life
Intense - the sense of causing strife
In her mind sometimes she's like a child

Daddy's eyes still watching me
But I set me free

She's got na na na na - nine lifes to survive
She got na na na na nothing left to lose

She got a bad - sad - history
A really sick life wrapped in mystery
She rearranged - changed everything
From a saint to a sinner with a nose-ring

She felt lost - crossed - different ways
Without getting involved with the old cliches
Cat-like she moves through her life

Daddy's eyes still watching me
But I set me free

She's got na na na na - nine lifes to survive
She got na na na na nothing left to lose
In her paradise

Footloose - footloose - footloose

Daddy's girl is breaking free
Time to change the world for me
Life is turning upside down
She one of your kind

She's got na na na na - nine lifes to survive
She got na na na na nothing left to lose
In her paradise
