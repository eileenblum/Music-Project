You try to scar the world now
- somehow - to show
you got the only true belief
Religion for a government
- that has sent - in the end
Death and fear and hate - distrust
But we are free and watch you
- touch you - smash you
To bring you back where you belong

We are the flame - we're fire - we're hot inside
And we will burn - burn - burn you down
We are the flame - we're fire - we're hot inside
And we will burn - burn - burn you down

Society of cowardice - deadly kiss - bloody bliss
How could your terror heal the world?
It seems every progress seems
- just a mess - to aggress!
Knowledge is your enemy
The freedom of opinion - beyond you
Is scaring you - we'll get the truth

We are the flame - we're fire - we're hot inside
And we will burn - burn - burn you down
We are the flame - we're fire - we're hot inside
And we will burn - burn - burn you down

A world where walls have ears
spreading fears - sea of tears
The people coming closer now
Do you really think we're so weak 
we're so bleak - you're the freak!
We fight for our way of life

We are the flame - we're fire - we're hot inside
And we will burn - burn - burn you down
We are the flame - we're fire - we're hot inside
And we will burn - burn - burn you down
