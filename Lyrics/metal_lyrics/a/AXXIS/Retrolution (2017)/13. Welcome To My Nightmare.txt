I know I can't die in this dream
I'm scared to death - I know it's not real
I feel my skin was peeled by heat
The fire burns me down to another piece of meat

I hear the echoes in my head
Bleak and full of dread

Welcome, welcome to my nightmare
Welcome, welcome - but do you dare?
Welcome, welcome to my nightmare
I can stand my fears

Million faces - all around
Their eyes are staring me into the ground
I take my fears that are scaring me
As challenges to set me free

Imprisoned in a castle keep 
When I fall asleep

Welcome, welcome to my nightmare
Welcome, welcome - but do you dare?
Welcome, welcome to my nightmare
I can stand my fears

Wake up when you lay blare 
You can join me everywhere

Welcome, welcome to my nightmare
Welcome, welcome - but do you dare?
Welcome, welcome to my nightmare
I can stand my fears
