Just a sound - more than loud 
And a beat that knocked me out 
One guitar - rebel yell
Don't want heaven - I want hell!

1989 was the time 
to draw the line 
Inside the metal zone 
the family has grown

Heavy Metal Brother - you are, you are my 
Heavy Metal sister - you are, you are my 
Heavy Metal Brother - you are, you are my 
Heavy Metal brotherhood
Forever you and me

If you're in rock, death or metal 
just a way to fight this battle 
Know so many fans and friends 
Even haters shake my hands

Stick together - we are one
One soul, one world, one-to-one
Against the liars all around
