There is a dream about it
Taking the law in our hands
A better world and justice
For people under our command
We are the firebrand - we'll be banned
We are the devil's hand
Beyond the law... for you!

On our bikes we ride through
Through the dark and dusty streets
Where the crime is legal
Fulfilling darkest needs
We take the right to fight - every night... for you

The Seven Devils are back 
The Seven Devils are back 
The Seven Devils are back 
...back in town

We hold the fire higher
When the law goes up in flame 
If you're guilty or a liar 
You can't hide, you'll take the blame 
We are the fire, the flame... for you

The Seven Devils are back 
The Seven Devils are back 
The Seven Devils are back 
...back in town
