All they said - just feels bad
All these words are pain
Coldest eyes telling lies
There's nothing to explain
Preaching water - drinking wine 
For hell on earth they pray 
Creating fear - we have to bear 
All fright they spread away

And I raise my fist to heaven
And I stand up for my right
And I'd like to know if you'll be at my side

The world is mine-mine-mine
I'm the fire
The world is mine-mine-mine
I'll be the storm at night

It seems to be desired
To lead and take the throne
Now I become inspired
By all the seeds they've sown
And I raise my fist to heaven
And I stand up for my right
And I'd like to know if you'll be at my side

The world is mine-mine-mine
I'm the fire
The world is mine-mine-mine
I'll be the storm at night

Wake up! Wake up!

The world is mine-mine-mine
I'm the fire
The world is mine-mine-mine
I'll be the storm at night
