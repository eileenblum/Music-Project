Cut into pieces
What we called love once
All that decreases
In the end I am the dunce
But now I'll change my mind
Enough is enough
You can't give me back
Oh, give me back my love

I can do better - I can do it better
I can do better - alone - without you

Once saint - now sinner
You are my daily battle that I choose
Seems you're the winner
Because you always make me lose
Alright, alright
I don't want to fight each and every day
I don't want you anymore
That's why I say:

I can do better - I can do it better
I can do better - alone - without you

You're like a blade
Cut off slices of my soul
I feel like a shadow
Falling into a deep dark hole

I can do better - I can do it better
I can do better - alone - without you
