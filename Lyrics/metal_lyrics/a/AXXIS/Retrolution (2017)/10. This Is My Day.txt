Raise me up! Push me down!
Hope you won't let me drown 
Moving on - don't look back 
Now I'm back on track
Feels like you - made my day 
Won't let it slip away 
Dash away on the run ...it's fun!

This is my day!
Don't give it away! Don't throw it away! 
This is my day!
Don't give it away! Don't throw it away! 
This my day!
Going my way - oh yes, come what may!

Ups and downs - history 
Carry on the mystery 
Feels like you're my energy 
My stroke of luck - set me free! 
I feel strong, I feel bold
If it's too hot, you're too cold 
I set back - I reset my life

This is my day!
Don't give it away! Don't throw it away! 
This is my day!
Don't give it away! Don't throw it away! 
This my day!
Going my way - oh yes, come what may!

This is my day!
Don't give it away! Don't throw it away! 
This is my day!
Don't give it away! Don't throw it away! 
This my day!
Going my way - oh yes, come what may!
