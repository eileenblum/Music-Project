Can you feel it? Do you see it?
There's a danger coming over our world
Won't you feel it? 
Evil thoughts and lies are spreading all around
Are you blind?
Left behind
In your mind
Get rid of what you find

Burn down your house
Set your mind in flames
Burn down the house
Light up your shame
Burn down your house
We're not all the same
Burn down the house
Burn down the thoughts
That lead to a deadly game

Silent movement - no improvement
Beyond the surface radical thoughts come to light
How could a stranger be a danger?
Your ignorance eats all your brain away

Burn down your house
Set your mind in flames
Burn down the house
Light up your shame
Burn down your house
We're not all the same
Burn down the house
Burn down the thoughts
That lead to a deadly game

Are you lonely? Are you lazy?
Stupid loser? There's a way to get rid of you?

Burn down your house
Set your mind in flames
Burn down the house
Light up your shame
Burn down your house
We're not all the same
Burn down the house
Burn down the thoughts
That lead to a deadly game
