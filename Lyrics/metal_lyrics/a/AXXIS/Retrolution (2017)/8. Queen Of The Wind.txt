She's loving - high places 
She's moving slowly down 
The silence - good graces 
Danger seems to be her crown

It's like crying out all in pain 
Try to be yourself - unchained

She is wild - yes, she's riding wild
Queen of the wind

The wind blows so strongly
She's in a trance in spite of ecstasy
One moment - to set free
She's flying higher divinely
It's like crying out all in pain
Try to be yourself - unchained

She is wild - yes, she's riding wild
Queen of the wind
