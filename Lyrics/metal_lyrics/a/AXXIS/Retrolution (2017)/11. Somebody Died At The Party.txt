Now stop thinking
Go for coma drinking
Give us alcohol
In our party zone
Someone's falling
On the floor and crawling
Now he's lying still
Is this really the big thrill?

Somebody died at the party
Somebody was killed tonight
Somebody died at the party
The drugs have killed tonight

Brunch punch candy
Let us drink the brandy 
Whiskey tasting
We're alone at home
Vodka cola with a little soda
And a cocktail free on top
We're not about to stop

Somebody died at the party
Somebody was killed tonight
Somebody died at the party
The drugs have killed tonight

Helpless drunken and alone
In a world of no control

Alone at home - on our own
The party zone - world of no control

Somebody died at the party
Somebody was killed tonight
Somebody died at the party
The drugs have killed tonight
