I'm inside - in your mind
I'm your inner friend
Dare to dream - don't be scared
When I hold your hand
All you feel deep inside
Is true is real, is pure
Don't banish what you really are
Now I'm here for you - I am your cure

I am the dream chaser for you
I let you be what you want to be
I am the dream chaser for you
I am the way to set you free
- to set you free

There's not black - there's no white
Deep inside your mind
Everything is possible
Leave this world behind
Just one step - follow me
All wishes will come true
This world was made for you

I am the dream chaser for you
I let you be what you want to be
I am the dream chaser for you
I am the way to set you free
- to set you free
