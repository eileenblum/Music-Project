Lies have killed my trust 
In all the ones I've loved 
Things that they pretend 
Mean nothing in the end 
All values that we've shared 
Could I have not been spared? 
It all went down the drain 
And nothing will remain

All my friends are liars 
Why do they fan the fires?
What is up with you? 
Are you really true?
All my friends are liars 
Why do they fan the fires?
It's hard for me to know
What's real and what's a show

Couldn't see behind your eyes
What's true, what's real, what are lies 
I'm real and what are you?
Is this friendship really true? 
Words mean nothing now 
When action speaks somehow 
The opposite takes place 
Unmasking face by face! 

All my friends are liars 
Why do they fan the fires?
What is up with you? 
Are you really true?
All my friends are liars 
Why do they fan the fires?
It's hard for me to know
What's real and what's a show

I won't deny my convictions 
I'm loyal to my belief
I try to be true and honest
It's harder than it seems 

All my friends are liars 
Why do they fan the fires?
What is up with you? 
Are you really true?
All my friends are liars 
Why do they fan the fires?
It's hard for me to know
What's real and what's a show
