The sky is clouded over now,
I don't know if I should go.
So much I have to say.

Feel me, touch me,
do you need me, anymore?

O-o-oh, you hold the answer in your head,
O-o-oh, try to see what I feel.

It's like burning rain,
burning rain,
burning rain,
burning rain,
burning rain.

Raindrops burning up my skin,
Like no secret word's in me
Just trying to explain.

Feel me, touch me,
Am I strong enough to be me?

O-o-oh, you hold the answer in your head,
O-o-oh, try to see what I feel.

It's like burning rain,
Burning rain,
Burning rain,
Burning rain,
Burning rain,
Burning rain,
Burning rain,
Burning rain.

Feel me, touch me,
Do you need me, anymore?

O-o-oh, you hold the answer in your head,
O-o-oh, try to see what I feel.

It's like burning rain,
Burning rain [x8]
