Lights in the demonstration
Fights are all around
Signs of a generation
New ways must be found

'Cause they wanna be free, baby
They wanna be free
See the livin' history

The world is looking in their eyes
And sees a fire burning
The world is looking in their eyes
While the world is turning

Eyes have found a new sight
Lies have no chance
The dream of freedom
That is yet unknown
Is bursting out of their hearts

'Cause they wanne be free, baby
They wanna be free
They are livin' history

The world is looking in their eyes
And sees a fire burning
The world is looking in their eyes
While the world is turning

Hands were held together
Words were spoken aloud
Yesterday it was still forbidden
But now it's all allowed

Hungry for freedom
Hungry for peace
The hunger for freedom
Can only increase

The world is looking in their eyes
And sees a fire burning
The world is looking in their eyes
While the world is turning
