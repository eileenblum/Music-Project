A lot of memories fade away
But not those awful days
When you're a man without grace
A soldier without a face
No one really knows the truth
About blood on glorious shoes
About a million killing hands
About lonely dying friends
And every night you hear them cry
And in your dreams you see them die
Up to this day you see their eyes open wide

[Chorus:]
Face to face with their death
And with only memories left
In those moments full of pain
You feel like you're goin' insane

Your memories still exist
The bad dreams still resist
No one can imagine this-you know
When their thoughts are as white as snow
But in a war all the snow is red
Red with blood of all the dead
Only one thought lets you live on
through those days

[Chorus:]
Face to face with their death
And with only memories left
In those moments full of pain
You feel like you're goin insane
