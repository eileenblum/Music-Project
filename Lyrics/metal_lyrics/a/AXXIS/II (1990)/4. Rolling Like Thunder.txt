I feel the sweat
And I'm trembling all over
Minutes before the show
Stage-fright tonight
My hands are wet and cold
Now it's time to get ready
I have to go
I can hear the people shouting
My blood pressure is rising
Time after time

Rolling like thunder
Feeling a storm deep inside

It's like a fire
I wanna explode in the night

Sweating in the light
Exhausted every night
My heart is beating
And the drum beats in my ears

Dancing in the heat
Stamping with my feet
The music drives me
High and higher
And we do all that we can
To make you feel alright

Exploding in this sound
It's like a trance
Turning round and around

Rolling like thunder
Feeling a storm deep inside

It's like a fire
I wanna explode in the night
