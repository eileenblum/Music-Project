Save me
The earth was young
When I was sown
Deep inside this land

Save me
Helpless I stand here alone
Waiting for my end

Save me
Centuries have flown away
But I know my time has come
Save me
No escape - I cannot stay
Do they know what they have done?

Save me
If you save me you'll save yourself
Why don't you understand?

Save me
Your fate will be sealed
If you destroy me
You will live in a wasteland

My life is your life
And your life is mine
We belong together
Since the beginning of all time

If I were a man
I know what I would think:
"Life is a chain
and we're all its links!"
So all that you can do is to...

Save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me

Wars and pain and misery
I've survived - I still exist
I've lived through your history
And watched you through the mist

My life is your life
And your life is mine
We belong together
Since the beginning of all time

If I were a man
I know what I would think:
"Life is a chain
And we're all its links!"
So all that you can do is to...

Save me, save me, save me...
