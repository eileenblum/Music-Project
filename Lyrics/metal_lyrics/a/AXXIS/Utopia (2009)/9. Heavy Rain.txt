[B. Weiss / H. Oellers]

A black horizon in the sky
Heavy clouds are gliding high
Feel the silence in the dark

I gotta get away
We get no chance
We could not stay
Even if we beg to pray
Clouds fading black and grey

The light is gone
No sun to guide
The shadows spreading out (gotta get away, I gotta get away)
The rain will come again

In the heavy rain and thunderstorm
Devil's flood has just begun
Walking through this dying land
The rain is under his command
Heavy rain and thunderstorm
There's no God, we're all alone
You and I will get no chance
We all burned the candle at both ends

The heaven's darkened by the rain
See the suffering, the drowning pain
See the madness of this world

I really don't know why
We've had the chance to change our course
But what we've done, what we've enforced
Is striking back with wind and rain

But you and I don't wanna die
Though bearing misery
Nothing can turn back the time now we see

In the heavy rain and thunderstorm
Devil's flood has just begun
Walking through this dying land
The rain is under his command
Heavy rain and thunderstorm
There's no God, we're all alone

If only God could hear us pray
Give us one more day
And I pray down on my knees
Oh heaven, hear us cry!
Will the flood of your tears
Ever passing by
Oh tell me why

A dying land, dead frozen eyes
A deafening silence no one cries
Shadows dance without a shape
Creeping through my mind tonight

In the heavy rain and thunderstorm
The devil's flood has just begun
Walking through this dying land
The rain is under his command
Heavy rain and thunderstorm
There's no God, we're all alone
You and I will get no chance
Let the rain come down forever
Let the rain come down forever
