[B. Weiss / H. Oellers]

They creep and crawl
They rise and fall
Spread greed and hate
Above you all

Yes, money rules
Feeding my might
I've managed fools
Crisis worldwide
And you know: I'm your hate
I'm your whore
I'm building the world you adore

The monsters crawl
They rise and fall
Rule our world now
And turn it upside down

The monsters crawl
Not anymore
Break down the world now
It's rotten to the core

Greed is my lust
My inner drive
I'll never go bust
Always revive
And you're my slave
My useful half
So, I'm your pain
Your lifelong chain
I always suck your blood and take your heart
I'm money-mad I tear your world apart

The monsters crawl
They rise and fall
Rule our world now
And turn it upside down
The monsters crawl
Not anymore
The world breaks down
Let's take a chance now
For a better time

You're the plaque
The modern virus
You're the pest
Got deep inside us
Could we ever stop to bless you
I don't know why we don't try

The monsters crawl
They rise and fall
Rule our world now
And turn it upside down
The monsters crawl
Not anymore
The world breaks down
So take the chance and let the monsters die
