[B. Weiss / H. Oellers]

Into my fathers' eyes a little spark of life
Almost gone forever
Father don't go away so much I wanna say
How could I turn back the time now?
How could I live without your jokes, you laughing loud?
How could I keep all my faith?

The day you die
You can hear me cry
My pain inside
Crying out at night
On the day you die
Tears running dry
I hold your hand
Oh father why?
Has time passed by
The day you die

On the day you're gone
There's so much left undone
I will miss you forever
Even if I know that's life
I want you to survive
But I know I'm just dreaming
Give me just one look into your eyes
And open up the skies

The day you die
You can hear me cry
My pain inside
Crying out at night
The day you die
Tears running dry
I hold your hand
Oh father why?
Life goes on and on

So many words unspoken, not said
I'll keep you in my heart 'til I'm dead

The day you die
You can hear me cry
My pain inside
Crying out at night
On the day you die
Tears running dry
I hold your hand
Oh father why?
The day you die

Now you are released
And I will all release
Oh rest in peace
