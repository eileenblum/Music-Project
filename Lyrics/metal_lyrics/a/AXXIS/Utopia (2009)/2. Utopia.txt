[B. Weiss / H. Oellers]

I don't know when I face my life
I look around and see
What's going on everyday
I can not stand
The hate and misery
It really knocks me down
Tell me why we're saving the world of today?
Let our vision fly
Don't know why we don't wanna try

Utopia
And I see the promised land
Utopia
The land of the free
Utopia
The fortune is in our hands to turn around this way of life
Take my hand and fight!

I don't know
When I face my life
Live in a world of lies
Live in a world of fire and ice
It seems to be that our fate is sealed
And in the train of time we're rushing through our life
Like the click of the clock moving through our time
A vision will revive see the signs the time has arrived

Utopia
And I see the promised land
Utopia
The land of the free
Utopia
The fortune is in our hands to turn around this way of life
Take my hand and fight!
All yeah!

I close my eyes here in Utopia
I realize it's not afar

Utopia
And I see the promised land
Utopia
The land of the free
Utopia
The fortune is in our hands to turn around this way
Way of life
