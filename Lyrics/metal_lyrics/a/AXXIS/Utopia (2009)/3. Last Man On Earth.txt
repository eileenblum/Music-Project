[B. Weiss / H. Oellers]

I'm sitting on a silent shore
For now alone for evermore
Isolated in the universe
Never get back the way so doomed and cold
Couldn't turn back time to save my soul
Moving slowly forward all the way
Cold twilight falls, the creature calls
From out of space being immortal or erased

In the name of God and glory times
Give me one more day 'till this world will fade away
Let me take these moments of my life
Oh God, I pray: This last day will be my rebirth
The last man on earth, I'm alive

No one, nobody, there's no life
Am I the only one who's survived?
Dangerous emptiness everywhere
Even though eyes can see but I feel blind
A deadly silence from behind
A world made out of nightmares all around
All twilight falls, dimension walls
An open gate a cosmic door to our dark fate

In the name of God and glory times
Give me one more day 'till this world will fade away
Let me take these moments of my life
Oh God, I pray: This last day will be my rebirth
The last man on earth, I'm alive

In the name of God and glory times
Give me one more day 'till this world will fade away
Let me take these moments of my life
Let me stay a while on this earth to pray
This day will be my rebirth
The last man on earth...
