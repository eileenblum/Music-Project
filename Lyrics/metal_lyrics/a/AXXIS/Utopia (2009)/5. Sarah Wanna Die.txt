[B. Weiss / H. Oellers]

How could it be wrong?
The will of the dying
A little brave girl
Her pain is growing all days endlessly
And I hear voice crying
Every breath is a bare trying to say
No will...To fight as before no chance anymore for what is life for?

When Sarah wanna die
The day to say goodbye
You better let her do what she wanna do
The world is crying: why?
When Sarah wanna die
Let heaven open up its holy door
When Sarah wanna die

Oh what a farewell... Do you hear her sighing?
It's a living hell but still she never gives up her free will
She will keep on trying looking for a chance to find a way now to God
For what is it for?
No sense anymore
How could we ignore

That Sarah wanna die
The day to say goodbye
You better let her do what she wanna do
The world is crying: why?
When Sarah wanna die
Let heaven open up its holy door
When Sarah wanna die

I will save you, please stop crying
I will save you, please stop crying
Your salvation is your dying
Sarah wanna die
In this night hear the angels cry
Only God could tell her why
She says: No that's my life!
She says: No that's my life!
She says: No that's my life!

Sarah wanna, Sarah wanna die
The day to say goodbye
You better let her do what she wanna do
The world is crying: why?
When Sarah wanna die
Let heaven open up its holy door
When Sarah wanna die
