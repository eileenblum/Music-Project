[B. Weiss / H. Oellers]

High above I've gotta be your true lover
And I wanna discover
All about your love

Gonna sing in my heart
And together forever
I will never say never
To my love and pain

Never get down feel the winter
The sunlight is cold
And mountains are covered in snow

I wish it could rain now, forever
The clouds turn to grey
The wind blows I don't wanna go

Let your sun light up my life
Like the snow lights up the night

Let your heart open your mind
Don't wanna hear you say goodbye

Now I close my eyes to hold my dreams inside
I bare my heart for you and now you see me cry

For you I will die
Let all angels fly
Don't leave me alone

I will not pray
I want you to stay
Built my wishing well
I'm under your spell

See us glide across the world and drift into another day
See us glide across the world and drift into another day
Oh hear me crying in the night I wanna save my love for you

Now close your eyes
I bare my heart for you

And I feel cold like in winter
The sun rises high
The angels will open their sky

And I hear the words of the twilight
Beyond frozen fields
The truth and all secrets revealed

So let us glide snowflakes alike
On the ice that breaks tonight
And I know the time goes by
Oh let us fly
And let me close my eyes to hold my dreams inside
I bare my heart for you and now you see me cry

For you I will die
Let all angels fly
Don't leave me alone

I will not pray
I want you to stay
Built my wishing well
I'm under your spell

Don't go away
I want you today
In heaven or hell
I'm under your spell

High above I gotta be your true lover
And I wanna discover
All about your love
Gonna sing my heart
And together forever
I will never say never... To my pain
