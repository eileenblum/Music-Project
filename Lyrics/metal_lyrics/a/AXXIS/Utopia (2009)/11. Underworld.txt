[B. Weiss / H. Oellers]

Will you (Will you)
Will you (Will you)
Try to reach the distant light
Running (Running)
Running (Running)
When the days fade into night

And I will find the hidden gate
I'm longing for so long
I will never know
If I will enter or may die

Down in the underworld life and underworld dream
A mirror shadow-world of what I be
Underworld love and underworld gleam
Don't let me go astray on the way to you
My way to you

Riding (Riding)
Riding (Riding)
Riding on the wings of death
Hear them (Hear them)
Calling (Calling)
Bear me name and my seal my fate

I see my life a battlefield
The future and the past
The secret candle you have lit
Will burn my soul at last

Down in the underworld life and underworld dream
A mirror shadow-world of what I be
Underworld love and underworld gleam
Don't let me go astray on my way to you

Shadows gimme shelter
Let me hide myself tonight

Down in the underworld life and underworld dream
A mirror shadow-world of what I be
Underworld life and underworld dream
A mirror shadow-world of what I be
Underworld love and underworld gleam
Don't let me go astray on my way to you

Shadows gimme shelter
Let me hide myself tonight
