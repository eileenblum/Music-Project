[B. Weiss / H. Oellers]

My eyes open wide
My dreams in the night
So crazy, so wild
When I was a child

No greed and no hate
I followed my fate
Could see angels fly
Could love and I could cry
Childlike, you can see the world through different eyes

The eyes of a child
So pure deep inside
Lifeplayed truth or dare
Could lay my heart bare

All I have believed
All thoughts I have dreamed
Are gone and replaced
By an empty space
And now, I know
That I wanna turn back the time

Through the eyes of a child
I look back on my life
You can see me tonight
Innocent and wild

Through the eyes of a child
And I remember the days of my life
I'm feeling alive

What's left from the past
Are dreams that will last
No chance to come true
I still dream of you

For all I've achieved
I'm feeling deceived
The life crossed my plans
The circle never ends
Childlike, you can see the world through different eyes

The eyes of a child
I look back on my life
You can see me tonight
Innocent and wild

Through the eyes of a child
And I remember the days of my life
I'm feeling alive

And now I know that I wanna turn back the time

Through the eyes of a child
I look back on my life
You can see me tonight
Innocent and wild

Through the eyes of a child
Oh, get a view of the world
Through the eyes
Eyes of a child
