Stay where you are
And hear the natural sounds
Blowin' in your ears
And if you try to understand
Be captured by unknown fears

Cause our world has changed its face
Day by day
See the signs all around
The nature strikes back

Fire and ice
Cold and heat
Hunger and war

Like a drop on a burnin' stone
We'll vanish in the universe
Are we the owner of our own?
No, that's not mankind's earth

Forgotten are all these promises
On which we've build our lives
Forgotten are all the preachers
With all their lies

Fire and ice
Cold and heat
Hunger and war
