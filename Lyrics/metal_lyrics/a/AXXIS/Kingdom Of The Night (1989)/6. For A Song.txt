More, more - I hear your voices crying
My sweat is running
My heartbeat is loud
The spots are burning like fire
High above
Restless - you can't get enough

Voices - I hear your voices and obey
Voices - an' our voices singin' every day

Now we're singin' for a song
For a song we play
Now we're singin' for a song
This time - and every day

The crazy crowd is screamin' for more
It takes no end
You want more and more
Your hands are moving
Like waves in the sea
I'm exhausted - but I'm feeling free

Voices - I hear your voices and obey
Voices - an' our voices singin' every day

Now we're singin' for a song
For a song we play
Now we're singin' for a song
This time - and every day
