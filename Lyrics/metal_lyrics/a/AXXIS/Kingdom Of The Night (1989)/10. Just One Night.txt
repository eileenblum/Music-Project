The snow is falling down on the streets
It dressed the town in white colours
I wait for your call
Or for your knock at my door
But I know that I'll be waiting in vain

Minutes and hours
And hours and days
Time is running
Like sand through my hand
Is it love? What I feel?
Come back again

Just one night
To take this chance to prove my love
Just one night
I'll take you to the edge of heaven
Just one night

Deep in the night my thoughts far away
It's raining - I hear the wind say:
"It's love, what you feel!
she will come back again!"

The voice of the wind
The call of my heart
I'll try a new start
So I'm calling your number:
"Come back again!"

Just one night
To take this chance to prove my love
Just one night
I'll take you to the edge of heaven
Just one night
