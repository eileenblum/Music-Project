Head over heels in love with you
Feeling like an eagle in the storm
All I do is dream of you
I feel like a new born
Falling in love, falling in love
Forever I will sell my soul

[Chorus:]
Never say never Forever in love
I'll be forever in love

The way you move, the way you talk
Takes my breath away
I wanna resist but this love exists
Deep in my heart you'll stay

Falling in love falling in love
Forever -I will sell my soul

[Chorus:]
Never say never Forever in love
I'll be forever in love
