I could feel the spell tonight
The fiddle plays its magic
It seems to cry, to swell and die
All I hear is tragic

[Bridge:]
Go dance away all trouble
Join me and stay
Lets fall into this battle
Listen to the fiddle play

[Chorus:]
Dance into life â the fiddle cries
Dance to survive â the battle of your life
Dance into life â the fiddle cries
All sorrows gone and a new life has begun tonight
Dance for your life

You've lost your love
Your luck, your pride
And you're feeling lonely
Listen to that fiddle tune
Played for your ears only

[Bridge:]
Go dance away all trouble
Listen to the fiddle play

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Bridge:]
Go dance away all trouble
Join me and stay
Lets fall into this battle
Listen to the fiddle play

[Chorus:]
Dance into life â the fiddle cries
Dance to survive â the battle of your life
Dance into life â the fiddle cries
All sorrows gone and a new life has begun tonight
Dance for your life
Dance for your life, all right
