Eyes in fright â the devil inside
That's the reason why she's giving up this night
Face was punched by a demons' touch
Her swollen bleeding lips really hurt so much

Eyes wide shut â taste her own blood
Was treated like a slave â feeling like a slut
In spite of his hate â it's never too late
Never let your fear decide your fate
It's dangerous to wait

[Chorus:]
'Cause Mary married a monster
Mary married a monster man
Mary married a monster
Don't suffer in silence and fight

No way out â no escape
Always living in the fear of being raped
Bad to the bone â a really sick man
Why she doesn't move â why not break her chain?
How could she stand all that pain?

[Chorus:]
Oh, Mary married a monster
Mary married a monster man
Mary married a monster
Your fear decides your fate

[Solo]

Let us scream loud just to break the silence
Living in the shadows of an everyday crime

[Chorus:]
Mary married a monster
Mary married a monster man
Mary married a monster
Don't suffer in silence and fight
