You are killing lives
But you say, "I am sorry."
A million people starving all the time
And isolation grows
But you will not oppose
We will be enthroned on the "last day"

[Chorus:]
I hear lie after lie
You believed and will die
Lie after lie
I won't play â play in this game

I can see a world
Now that is burning
The cross of your redemption has arrived
Oh, banished straight to hell
But still you're feeling well
We will be enthroned on the "last day"

[Chorus:]
I hear lie after lie
You believed and will die
Lie after lie
I won't play in this game

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Lie after lie
You believed and will die
Lie after lie
I won't play â play in this game
This game
Lie after lie
Lie after lie
