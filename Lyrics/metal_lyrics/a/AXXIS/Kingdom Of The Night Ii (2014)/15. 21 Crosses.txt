I've seen the "night of 1000 lights"
The candles burn for 21
Wanted to party and celebrate
There's a tragedy began

But who will take the blame
For people crushed to death
For children dying in the panic crowd
Still hear them crying out loud

[Chorus:]
Will you take away the tears today when we pray
Still feel the shadows of the love parade
Will you take away the tears today when we pray
The memory of their names will still remain
But who'll take the blame

Now silence â still hear their voices cry
Can feel the chaos of this day
And if you ask: who's responsible?
Oh, but the truth is kept away

Look in that mothers' eyes
Can't stand that pack of lies
Her tears, her pain seems to accuse
She needs more than an excuse

[Chorus:]
Will you take away the tears today when we pray
Still feel the shadows of the love parade
Will you take away the tears today when we pray
The memory of their names will still remain
Who'll take the blame
Who'll take the blame

[Solo]

I'm starring at your cross -
Could I stand the loss of July the 24th

[Chorus:]
Will you take away the tears today when we pray
Still feel the shadows of the love parade
Will you take away the tears today when we pray
The memory of their names will still remain
Who'll take the blame, who'll take the blame
Who'll take the blame, who'll take the blame?
