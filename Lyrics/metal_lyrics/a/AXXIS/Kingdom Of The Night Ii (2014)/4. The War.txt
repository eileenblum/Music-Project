I gotta think about the way we're living
I gotta think about that life
Can see the worlds collide â there's no forgiving
Who's really ruling our world now?
We brush aside and ignore...

[Chorus:]
...we're in a war â the war
The war is everywhere
I see the war â the war in you
I see the war â the war
The war behind the scenes
I see the war of the worlds
The voices unheard â now fight

Oh, my world is ruled by cheats and liars
We're in a war for their desires
We're infiltrated by other powers
Strike back â the world is ours!

[Chorus:]
We're in a war â the war
The war is everywhere
I see the war â the war in you
I feel the war â the war
The war behind the scenes
I see the war of the worlds
The voices unheard â now fight

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
I see the war â the war
The war is everywhere
I see the war â the war in you
I feel the war â the war
The war behind the scenes
I see the war of the worlds
The voices unheard, the voices unheard â now fight
