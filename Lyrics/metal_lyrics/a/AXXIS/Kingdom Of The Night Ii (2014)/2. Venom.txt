Shades of blackness â deep inside
You've brought the chaos in my mind
All my senses â fall asleep
I'm falling deeper than deep
Eyes open wide â but I can't see

[Chorus:]
I feel your venom
Running through my veins
My blood will burn like fire
When I'm in your chains
I feel your venom
Your poison in my blood
Got me addicted to your love
Your love will be my drug

So much weakness â paralyzed
I feel my body â cold as ice
It's hot inside â million degrees
My blood is burning â but I'm freeze
Oh, don't stop loving â oh, please go ahead

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
I feel your venom
Running through my veins
My blood will burn like fire
When I'm in your chains
I feel your venom
Your poison in my blood
Got me addicted to your love
You are my drug
You are my drug
You are my drug
My drug
