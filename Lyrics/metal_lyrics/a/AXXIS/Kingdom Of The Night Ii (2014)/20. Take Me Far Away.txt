Sometimes my life is like a storyboard
A book of things, somebody else wrote
I feel controlled with every move I make
It's like a deja vu or am I awake?

The burden of my life â it's left behind
I gotta get away â no matter what I find
Feel the overwhelming moment
When you free your mind

[Chorus:]
Take me far away
Beyond the blue horizon
Take me far away
Let me go my way to you

A set of many rules â I've self-imposed
Was like a prison for my soul that I enclosed
I gotta get away from all that's left
I gotta break my cage in which I was pressed

For now head up and I stay strong
I fake a smile â then I move on
Feel the overwhelming moment
When you free your mind

[Chorus:]
Take me far away
Beyond the blue horizon
Take me far away
Another day is dawning
Love will find a way

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Take me far away
Take me far away
Take me far away
Beyond the blue horizon
Take me far away
Another day is dawning
Let me go my way
