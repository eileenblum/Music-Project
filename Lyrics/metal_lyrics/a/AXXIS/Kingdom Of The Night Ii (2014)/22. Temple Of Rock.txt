Children of the seven seas â are crawling in the dark
No way to run â nowhere to hide â from darkness to the light
It's time for action now â in this modern zoo
No way to feel angry â there's nothing you can do

[Bridge:]
Do you believe
Oh, in this strange world today
Look into my eyes
Just take my hand and let us fly

[Chorus:]
Let me take you to another world anywhere
I'll take you to the secrets of your life
I am praying in the palace of my paradise
Praying for you in the temple of rock

Brother moon is calling me â he's hiding in the dust
A sacred place is all they need â feel the secret lust
Before I try to be like you â I'm rather on my own
Fear is growing in their souls â in my danger zone

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Let me take you to another world anywhere
I'll take you to the secrets of your life
I am praying in the palace of my paradise
Praying for you
I really do
I change your mind
In this modern zoo
In the temple of rock

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
I'm praying, I'm praying
Praying for you
Oh, let me take you to another world anywhere
I'll take you to the secrets of your life
I am praying in the palace of my paradise
Praying for you in the temple of rock
Rock
