Come to me
I'll show you how the world could be
Milk and honey down the hill
Clearest water running still
The paradise is not so far
Following the shining star
Cannot wait I will be first
Heaven will be here on earth
Tonight I'm gonna shut my eyes
I'm blinded by your light
Oh, let the fire burn so bright

[Chorus:]
You're my heaven in paradise
You're a blessing in disguise
You're my heaven in paradise
I hold my breath and close my eyes

I don't see
Why you mean that much to me
Kiss me and I kiss you twice
Let me feel your paradise
Come on, come on take my hand
Follow me and understand
I'll stay here for a while
Touch me with your smile â your smile

[Chorus:]
You're my heaven in paradise
You're my blessing in disguise
You're my heaven in paradise
I'm gonna shut my eyes
I'm blinded by your light
Oh, let the fire burn so bright
I hold my breath and close my eyes

[Chorus:]
You're my heaven in paradise
You're a blessing in disguise
You're my heaven in paradise
I hold my breath and close my eyes
