As I look back at my lover
With open eyes
I feel there's something wrong
I feel that I
Need to change my mind
I know what I have to say

[Bridge:]
And I say â no â I love you
I need you â no longer now

[Chorus:]
I'll go by myself
I need no one else
I'll go by myself
You can't treat me so badly again
Never again, never again

I'll go my way alone
I won't look back and cry
I gave you everything
All that you need
But you turned your back on me
When I needed you

[Bridge:]
So I say â no â I love you
I need you â no longer now

[Chorus:]
I'll go by myself
I need no one else
I'll go by myself
You can't treat me so badly again
Never again

[Solo]

[Bridge:]
And I say â no â I love you
I need you â no longer now

[Chorus:]
(I'll go by myself)
Don't miss you â no never
I leave you now forever
(I need no one else)
From now on, I'll go my way alone
(I'll go by myself)
Don't miss you â no never
I leave you now forever
(I need no one else)
From now on, I'll go my way alone
(I'll go by myself)
Don't miss you â no never
I leave you now so
You can't treat me so badly again
Never again, never again
