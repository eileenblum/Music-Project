Don't watch me â touch me
In the valley of pain
Frustrated â blockaded
I'll go insane
You cheat me â treat me
Like a dog

[Bridge:]
And I feel like a fool
I know we can't recover
We destroy each other
I don't know you anymore

[Chorus:]
I feel your bites deep inside, baby
How do you feel â maybe
You wanna scar my soul
I feel your bites deep inside, baby
And nothing's left maybe
Just a deep black hole â why should I fall?

Oh, your true face â pack of lies
Comes to light
All my pride â lost inside
When you bite
Don't deceive me â leave me
Get out of my life

[Bridge:]
And I feel like a fool
I feel you cold as ice
You are cold as ice tonight

[Chorus:]
I feel your bites deep inside, baby
How do you feel â maybe
You wanna scar my soul
I feel your bites deep inside, baby
And nothing's left maybe
A deep black hole â but why should I fall?
I don't know you anymore

[Solo]

[Bridge:]
Cold as ice â you are cold as ice
Feel you cold as ice â you are cold as ice
Oh, my pain is your delight

[Chorus:]
I feel your bites deep inside, baby
How do you feel â maybe
You wanna scar my soul
I feel your bites deep inside, baby
And nothing's left maybe
Just a deep black hole in which I fall
