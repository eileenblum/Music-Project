Good days are gone â and I don't really know
How could I save you?
All that's left â is a mandolin
To play and cry and I sing
Oh, my Helena â put your hands in mine
This world is not in harmony â what happens is a crime

[Chorus:]
But we got nothing to fear â we are the world
Together we can change our future now
Oh, we got nothing to fear â we are the world
Burn down these walls of sorrow â let's go!
We are the world

Days of fight â I don't wanna hide
I'll be a savior
Come outside â together we are strong
We'll get along and I sing
Oh, my Helena â let's play your mandolin
Hope someday, in this land, again the sun will shine

[Chorus:]
Cause we got nothing to fear â we are the world
Together we can change our future now
Oh, we got nothing to fear â we are the world
Burn down these walls of sorrow â let's go!
We are the world

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Oh, we got nothing to fear â we are the world
Take my hand, take my hand tonight
Oh, we got nothing to fear â we are the world
Together we can change our future now
Oh, we got nothing to fear â we are the world
Burn down these walls of sorrow â let's go!
We are the world
