All right, all right
All right, all right
We're back into the kingdom of the night

The golden rings, the dirty jeans
Nice pictures in my mind
But I have looked behind the scenes
There's nothing of this kind
Still money rules â so many fools
Controlling with their might
But now we're free and independent
Let us rock tonight

[Bridge:]
So get up â go down
Move your legs and stamp around
Get up â get down
Get the kingdoms' crown

[Chorus:]
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
We're back into the kingdom of the night
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonight
We're back into the kingdom of the night

Oh, set us free â that's what we call
Back into rock 'n' roll
No business crap â back to the roots
That's our common goal
We still go on â go our way
We loved to be on the road
Be strong enough to be yourself
That's our secret code

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
