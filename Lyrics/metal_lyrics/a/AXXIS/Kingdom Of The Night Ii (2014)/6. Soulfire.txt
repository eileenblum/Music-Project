I can feel black devils
How they crossed the flame
I could stand my visions
Good or bad â boon or bane
Go with the shadow march
In trance â a secret way
Walk on â don't leave a mark
Don't go astray â this way

[Bridge:]
Hypnotized â so break all the chains of ice

[Chorus:]
Back on track â soul fire
Don't let your flame expire
Let all your shadows fly and find yourself
Back on track â soul fire
Still burning and admire
Your mind can heal, feel, seal your fate
So, get things straight

Like shadows in a hall
You're captured in a cage
Dreams go up to the wall
Try to escape with love and rage
You hear it in your mind
An inner voice inside
This life, this daily grind
Give it up â don't look behind

[Bridge:]
I'm hypnotized
So break all the chains â the chains of ice

[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Bridge:]
And I know we're all hypnotized
We're living in trance
Oh, break all the chains of ice

[Chorus:]
Back on track â soul fire
Don't let your flame expire
Let all your shadows fly and find yourself
Back on track â soul fire
Still burning and admire
Your mind can heal, feel, seal your fate
Soulfire, soulfire
