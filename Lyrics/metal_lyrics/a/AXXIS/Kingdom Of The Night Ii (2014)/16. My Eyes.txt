My eyes can see but I feel blind
So many tears inside
Obscure and confusing
Last night â love was feeling right
And now you wanna go
Why do you wanna leave me?
I wonder why â I haven't seen a sign
Is there a chance like stars to realign

[Chorus:]
So why won't you stay together
Now believe in my endeavor
To save the world for you and me
So why won't you say: no never
My love will last forever
Stay â do believe in what I say:
Our love will find a way â I pray

My eyes can see but I feel blind
Can't look inside your mind
How can I look behind?
My tears â the bleeding of my heart
Will tear my world apart
How could I live without you?

[Chorus:]
So why won't you stay together
Now believe in my endeavor
Stay â do believe in what I say:
Someday our love will find a way
Why won't you say: no never
My love will last forever
What does it take to make you see?
You're my fate, my destiny
My only one

[Solo]

No words â no chance for a reply
I really wonder why that's how you gonna treat me

[Chorus:]
So why
So why won't you stay together
Now believe in my endeavor
To save the world for you and me
So why won't you say: no never
My love will last forever
Stay â do believe in what I say:
Someday our love will find a way
