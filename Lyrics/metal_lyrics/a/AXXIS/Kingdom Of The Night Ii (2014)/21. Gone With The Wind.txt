I hear you crying
See black ravens flying
Oh, mother nature could you forgive

I know we've raped you
We've badly shaped you
Continuously we dig our grave

What we call lifetime
Is just the blink of an eye
And all that's left is dust and wind

[Chorus:]
Gone with the wind â but you remain
Gone with the wind â we take the blame
In the circle of life we'll disappear
There's no one left to shed a tear

Gone with the wind â but you remain
Gone with the wind â we take the blame
Circle of life â we'll disappear
There's no one left to shed a tear
Gone with the wind
Gone with the wind

[Solo]

World is not ours
All the natural powers
Will strike back with might and main

With rivers flowing
And flowers growing
We will be gone for eternity

[Chorus:]
Gone with the wind â but you remain
Gone with the wind â we take the blame
Circle of life â we'll disappear
There's no one left to shed a tear
Gone with the wind
Gone with the wind â but you remain
We take the blame
