She says he doesn't mean it in that way
Maybe she did something wrong â better to obey
The pain abates and life goes on and on
She knew it was her fault â God has sealed her fate

Tell me how many reasons? How many tears?
How much pain does she need to fight her fears?

[Chorus:]
'Cause Mary married a monster so why
Mary married a nightmare
Mary married a monster so why
So why won't she break out tonight
Just to survive

Mistreated and abused so many times
Every day she's living with all these little crimes
Why does she accept her victim's role?
Try to escape
All love and hate
It's not too late
God sealed your fate

[Chorus]

[Solo]

I hear her crying in the rain
I feel her misery, her pain
I hear her crying in the rain
Oh, Mary

[Chorus:]
Mary married a monster so why
Mary married a nightmare
Mary married a monster so why
So why won't she break out tonight
Just to survive
How could I save you tonight
How could I save you tonight
How could I save you tonight
