There's some trouble in my head
Walk the line and I feel sad
'Cause I'm far away from home
Every night I'm on the phone
But without you I'm alone
I've been holding out so long
I'm far away
Away â and I can't help it now
It's time to return
To you again

[Chorus:]
Can you feel me crying
Think I could be dying
Girl I'm gonna miss you
Every night and day
And the sky is crying
There is no denying
I don't wanna miss you
More than for one day
I pray

Only echoes of your sighs
And a shadow of your smile
Oh, you're the only one
I feel your whisper on my skin
So intense I burn within
I can feel you deep inside
And never say goodbye

[Chorus:]
Can you feel me crying
Think I could be dying
Girl I'm gonna miss you
Every night and day
And the sky is crying
There is no denying
I don't wanna miss you
More than for one day
Away
Miss you every night and day
Never say good-bye again
And I cry for you

[Solo]

[Chorus:]
Can you feel me crying
Think I could be dying
Girl I'm gonna miss you
Every night and day
And the sky is crying
There is no denying
I don't wanna miss you
More than for one day
More than for one day
More than for one day
