Your life â your life is kinda bizarre
You just want â you want to get a rock star
In your game â you've got a perfect disguise
And then I'm looking down to you
Into your blue eyes...

[Bridge:]
...are shining bright â like diamonds in the sun
Right away I know â tonight I'll be the one
And I know when the night is gone

[Chorus:]
I'm in your hall of fame â I'm reading my name
In your hall of fame â I'm playing your game
In your hall of fame â I'm reading my name
I'm nothing special â just another pawn in your game

You know â you know I'll take the bait
I'm sure â this trap is gonna be great
Chase me â face me â trace me â now
And I'm looking in your eyes
I'm electrified...

[Bridge:]
...right away â I'm your victim for one night
Right away I know â I'll be the one tonight

[Chorus:]
I'm in your hall of fame â I'm reading my name
In your hall of fame â I'm playing your game
In your hall of fame â I'm reading my name
Oh, I'm your victim â I'm your victim now
You're on the hunt tonight
No escape â you take them all
One by one

[Solo]

[Bridge:]
Right away â away I know
I'll be the one tonight
I'm your trophy now â all right

[Chorus:]
I'm in your hall of fame â I'm reading my name
In your hall of fame â I'm playing your game
In your hall of fame â I'm reading my name
I'm just another â another pawn in your game
In your game
In your game
I'm nothing special
I'm just another â another pawn in your game
