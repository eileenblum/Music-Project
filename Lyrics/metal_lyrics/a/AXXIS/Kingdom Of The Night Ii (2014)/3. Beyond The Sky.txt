Blood sacrifice
A candle light
A virgin tear
Is lost in fear

The darkness grows
A silver glow
Mankind is pained
They were unchained

Calling up the demons
With a magic spell
The masters of all evil
Screaming out their devilish yell

Purple dust of twilight
Confuses our minds
Shadows fighting outright
And everybody will be blind

[Bridge:]
I don't know how to survive
But I know

[Chorus:]
Beyond the sky
A million miles
Out of the light
The shadows die
Beyond the sky
A million miles
Out of the light
The shadows die

Nightingales are singing
Final melodies
The doomsday bell is ringing
For the approaching enemies

I see fires burning
In their frozen eyes
Shadows sent for killing
Without any compromise

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Solo]

Ringing â bells are ringing
Singing â hear them singing
Flying â ravens flying
Follow me to die

[Chorus:]
Beyond the sky
Out of the light
The shadows die
Beyond the sky
A million miles
Out of the light
All shadows die
