[Music, vocal melodies and lyrics: Kim Olesen, Henrik Fevre]

Cut me out, let me go
From these hollow winds that blow
Let me go let me go, itâs an outrageous misfortune
I wanted to seek, I wanted to find
I wanted only things that once was mine

âItâs cold and dark
As the spirit closes in on him
Heâs a dreamer in mind
Just another believer
Who wastes no time
Searching answers endlesslyâ

Riding on the wave of your hand
Over land of symbols that I donât understand
Trying to embrace your new world
This journeyâs unpredictable, a mystery unfurled
Travelled far to see you again
But every dream I had of you was dreamed up in vain
Now Iâm trying hard to break up the ice
To free the man I used to call my friend, but itâs no dice

Itâs crazy, crazy

Once in time, far away
In the land of white and grey
I discovered the truth
What Iâd missed for so long
Is the very thing that keeps you going on

Countless horizons
They once were so fine
Call it thievish, call it fate
I believe itâs possible to recreate
And they all could be mine

Newborn horizons
They dawn upon me
Call it thievish, call it fate
I believe itâs possible to recreate
Now Iâm finally free (newborn horizons)

Riding on the wave of your hand
Over land of symbols that I donât understand
Trying to embrace your new world
This journeyâs unpredictable, a mystery unfurled
