If nothing else will come of this
Than a crazed experience
I might tell you something I think you know
That youâre keeping out of sight
Lost, but not erased
Time will show

Donât stray, youâre destined to remember
âCause you canât stop thinking âbout the day
I pray youâll find what you endeavour
And make peace on the way

You must dig into your underworld
Thereâs secrets waiting there to be found
But brace yourself for a vicious past
So unsafe and so unsound
Itâs time to face yourself

Donât stray, youâre destined to remember
âCause you canât stop thinking âbout the day
I pray youâll find what you endeavour
And make peace on the way

Living with a troubled mind
Defined life and left you in a bind
(you took the only road you knew)
Been wasting your time, wasting your timeâ¦

Only you can change your ways
And reluctance will bring you hell to pay
(Clear your mind and youâll be free, yeah)
Donât be wasting your time, wasting your time

Donât stray, youâre destined to remember
âcause you canât stop thinking âbout the day
I pray youâll find what you endeavour
And make peace on the way
