Lyrics: Henrik Fevre]

Inhale, exhale, stay awake, keep talking, donât give in
The arms of death are reaching out to decompose your skin

Hold tight and the wings of faith will take you higher
Hold on tight and youâll be all right

Patched up, enfeebled and disqualified
From the everyday I had before
My independence cut down to the bone
They told me Iâd live but life is a bore

Thereâs a will but thereâs no way
Thereâs an idea but not clay
Iâm reduced to observing
The life work of others with no voice to sing

Save me from the fate that Iâve been given, save me
My doorway disappeared and everything turned passÃ©

I see the worldly life through different eyes
Now Iâve discerned what lies ahead
Once so importantâs suddenly trivial
Time drags when lifeâs confined to a bed

Thereâs a fortune but no door
Thereâs an island but no oar
Iâm reduced to creating
Vast illusions, daydreaming

Airways, Iâm running up the steps to catch my airways
Itâs childâs play once you get the hang of it, itâs my way
Back to freedom

All night I live the life I once believed in
All this time Iâm close to fine

All night I live the dream I once imagined
Hold on tight

Airways, Iâm running up the steps to catch my airways
Itâs childâs play once you get the hang of it, itâs too late
To be saved in a world that let you down, itâs too late
