You turn your face!
Are you somewhat surprised to find
All that you were and once believed
Is now but a lost state of mind
Back in time
When the future felt infinite
You fought like a king to make a change
Whatever the cost, no regrets

Respectable in all directions
Wheedled into false affections
The ideal tomorrow
Was changed all along
As you grew older
The fire burned a little colder
âTil one day it died out
Ideology turned to mindlessness

There were times when you couldâve done so much more
Than saving yourself, neglectfully
Unlike how you were before
Your world disbanned
And all that mattered was making gold
Regardless of how
You turned your back
On the dogma you had, broke the mold

Wrapped up in your selfish dreams
The world unfolds in perfect schemes
With chaos lurking underneath
The air is getting hard to breathe
Wrapped up in your selfish dreams
The world unfolds in perfect schemes
But whereâs your lifetime guarantee?
The time will come and you will see

Respectable in all directions
Wheedled into false affections
The ideal tomorrow
Was changed all along
As you grew older
The fire burned a little colder
âTil one day it died out
Ideology turned to mindlessness

You turn your face!
Are you somewhat ashamed to learn
That youâll never give up your way of life?
Just mind your own concern!

Respectable in all directions
Wheedled into false affections
The ideal tomorrow
Was changed all along
As you grew older
The fire burned a little colder
âTil one day it died out
Ideology turned to mindlessness
Mindlessness
Total Mindlessness
