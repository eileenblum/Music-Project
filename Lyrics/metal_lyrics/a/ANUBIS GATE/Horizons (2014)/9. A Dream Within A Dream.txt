Lyrics: Henrik Fevre]

This is a dream that we share
A ball full of thoughts in our minds
The night is young
The game is on
And all else falls way behind

Itâs so real, this dreamy invention
Itâs never been like thisâ¦.
The world is twisted around
And we canât control this creation
But itâs never been like this, been like this, been like this, been like this, like thisâ¦

This is a dream going on
Where we can decide what we are and where
We may dissolve the ground if we fall
And the dream might turn into a nightmare

Maybe we grew tired of living on
This narrow path that we walked upon
And maybe we could build it somewhere
A new world made of dreamers

Itâs so real, this dreamy invention
We know but realityâs outdone by far
Now we can be who we are
Though we canât control this creation
Itâs never been like thisâ¦

Thereâs a magical current
Of belief in the air
As we let ourselves in
But when we open our eyelids
And step into the dream
A kind of vision presents itself

A man with lonely eyes
Glazed from all theyâve seen
Worn-down from forced goodbyes
So many has-beens

Somethingâs taken hold of my feelings
Somethingâs taken hold of my soul
I try to crack a hole in the ceiling
But it grows out of hand
Iâm losing my self-control

Why would you leave me?
Why would you give up the world we created?
I thought we could make it and now utopia is gone

King of the promised land
Abundance of luxury
With powers to make a stand
So handsome Iâll be!

This is everything that I dreamed of
This is how my life should have been
But hidden in the back of this dreamstuff
A notion so grim: something is missing

Why would you leave me?
Why would you give up the world we created?
I thought we could make it
Now Iâve been abandoned
And why, after all weâve been through?
Utopia was you

All the fires in side me
Keep on burning my tears
When they should have been shed
In the midst of a breakdown
Iâm disturbingly calm
Am I living or dead?

Thereâs a place I long to see
That resembles home
Where the sky is dressed in blue
And I am citizen unknown

And I wish that youâll be there
Awaiting my return
To the simple lives we knew
I guess you live and learn

My kingdom finally fell
Crashed by loneliness
The wondrous heaven turned to hell
Less is more con more is less

But itâs a dream within a dream
âCause thereâs no way back
The sleep and I wonât separate

So here I am standing
One step from landing in time
So I may rectify my crime
Tossed through the layers
Demolishing chaos
The dream is gone

Maybe itâs a dream within a dream
Maybe things are not what they seem
Maybeâ¦
