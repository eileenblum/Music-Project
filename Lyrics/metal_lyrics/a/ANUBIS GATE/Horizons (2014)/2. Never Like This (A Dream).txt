Lyrics: Kim Olesen]

This is a dream that I have
A glimpse of a world more real
The night is young
My mind is strong
And I walk of paths so unreal

Maybe there's more than meets the eye
More to this world than we see
And what if what's true is a lie?
What if this time I'll be free?

No!
It's just an illusion
It's never been like this, been like this
Where do I go from here?
Caged in a moment's reflection
It's never been like this, been like this

Help me
I'm in search of something new
And something escapes my sight
Maybe I've got answers to question
Questions that lead me to light

Oh no!
It's just an illusion
It's never been like this, been like this
Where do I go from here?
Caged in a moment's reflection
It's never been like this, been like this

I know it's just an assertion
It's always been like this, been like this
And there is no way out of here
I know beyond my conception
I've always begged for this, searched for this, longed for this, strived for this, wanted this, like this
