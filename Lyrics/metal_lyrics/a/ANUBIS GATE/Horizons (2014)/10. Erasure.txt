[Music, Vocal Melodies, and Lyrics: Henrik Fevre]

I call your name
For the seventh time
And when the night sets in
Iâll retrace my crime

I put out your flame
And still the smoke keeps coming back for more
I recall the sound
Of your dreams against the floor
Erasure, rewind
Your life
Not here, no more

Wasting
Iâve been wasting
All this time I tried so hard
To figure out my world
Wasting
Iâve been merely wasting
Hours that remain unsung
By my voice

I call your name
For the umpteenth time
And when the light sets in
Iâll retain my crime
Erasure, rewind
My life
Not here, no more
