Come on home, son
Part from where you are
Thereâs nothing left to you to be there for
Faithful soldier, you made your mark by far

Time has come, step out of the spot
Weâll find you a place where the heroes of war
Take up the lives they used to lead before

Weâll respect you
Weâll perfect you
Weâll protect you
For nothing

Weâll neglect you
Weâll deject you
Weâll reject you
For nothing

Dreadful memories haunt me all the time
How fierce we were in the fields of battle
Stand up straight, soldier, this is not a crime

Donât be afraid, you must carry on
The peacemaking warrior serving his country
It could be the end if you opened your eyes
And turned to disagree

Weâll respect you (you promised to help me)
Weâll perfect you (a breach of faith)
Weâll protect you for nothing
(cause these days Iâm nothing to you)

Weâll neglect you (I was a fool to believe you)
Weâll deject you (why did you lie?)
Weâll reject you for nothing

The damages I saw spread chaos in my dreams
When I canât tell right from wrong, my actions go to the extremes
Every now and then I tend to disappear
I lock the world away, I feel thereâs no room for me here
I used to be the guy with strength enough for two
Affectionate and kind, whatever you might ask I would do
Now Iâm feeling odd, no spark of life, no gun
The fight against injustice only just begun

You promised to help me
But why did you lie?
Youâll respect me, youâll protect me for nothing
Weâll respect you (I was a fool to believe you)
Weâll perfect you (A breach of faith)
Weâll protect you for nothing (Iâm nothing to you)
Weâll neglect you (I was a fool to believe you)
Weâll deject you (A breach of faith)
Weâll reject you for nothing

Every now and then I tend to disappear
I lock the world away, I feel thereâs no room for me here
Long forgotten vet, a soldier with no gun
The fight against injustice only just begun
