Running through the wilderness
Determined to succeed
Improving myself by the seconds
Relentless âtil Iâm beat
My whole life is repetition
I donât know how to end
The dominant obsession that Iâm
Destined to amend

Step by step through burning hell
One manâs wasteland, hours to kill
Next thing I remember is the rock against my head
The devastating heat waveâs gone
Thereâs a cold night sky instead
Both my legs are paralyzed, my throat is sore an dry
I canât help but thinking: My timeâs up, this is goodbye

Forward crawling, arms in pain
My strong determination remains

Can you hear my call?
Whoâs coming to my rescue?
Iâm losing the light in my eyes
Into an endless sky I stare
And my life just passed in review

Hope descends every devastating hour I spend
Heaven knows when it will end

Hear my Call!

Hear my call?
Whoâs coming to my rescue?
Iâm losing the light in my eyes
Into the break of dawn I stare
Now thereâs someone out there calling my name
Thatâs when I realize
Iâm already hanging in the air

Hope descends every devastating hour I spent
Will the gods decide to make amends?
Heaven knows whenever thisâll end
Iâm running out of time
And hope descends every devastating hour I spent
Will the gods decide to make amends
Heaven knows whenever thisâll end
