Come wake up, be serious
You donât have a clue?
The world is turning upside down
And it might affect you too!
Tonight there will be miracles
But nothing left to see
Cause every alteration made
Is forged in memory

Turn your pages, youâve waited for ages
A whole new story, brand new display

Wars have come and gone
No one cares who won
Generation next
Fighting other battles
Where survivors rule
Thereâs always a fool
To ridicule and scorn
Revolution come undone

Hidden from the untrained eye
But right beneath your thought
A higher state of consciousness
The open mindâs resort
And if youâd only dare to search
Your deeper inner space
You might find thereâs more to life
Than the reflection of your face

Turn your pages, weâve waited for ages
A whole new story, brand new display

Wars have come and gone
No one cares who won
Generation next
Fighting other battles
Where survivors rule
Thereâs always a fool
To ridicule and scorn
Revolution undone

Do you feel this world has come to cease?
Like a worn and battered masterpiece
Could be blessed, but you wonât see

Wars have come and gone
No one cares who won
Generation next
Fighting other battles
Where survivors rule
Thereâs always a fool
To ridicule and scorn
Revolution come undone
