[Lyrics: Henrik Fevre]

You've often watched and wondered why
No one seemed to pay attention
You've always blamed your childhood days
All the words unsaid, unmentioned

Time is closing in on you
No way out, nothing left to do
Take the journey to the hidden chambers of your mind

It won't be easy, it won't be nice
To face the man who's pulling your strings still
But only through this sacrifice
You can gain courage and will

Left with no alternatives
You cast your soul into the flames
Let them burn and melt your skin
Let purification begin

You've got to dig much deeper
to find the inner self
You've got to try much harder
to come alive again
And when the night is over
You'll be as right as rain
Purification brings you back from pain

Looking back you often cried
But you never knew the reason
Now anger comes and anger goes
All your life youâve searched for treason

Targetâs changing now you see
Who is who in your family
You shut the door, itâs time to be
All alone for a while

To figure out the true connection
Block out their words unsaid, unmentioned
Beware, donât walk like them
Or their footsteps will haunt you again
