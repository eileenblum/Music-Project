[Lyrics: Sonia Vasan]

Unsought I come to you
Unbound I fly far from you
Unseen I follow
Unloved I need you

Curse me and curse yourself
Scorn me and you scorn yourself
Your shadow in me
My darkness in you

Shades of your little nightmares
Days of your past life are haunting you
Shape shift now, I'm your master
Can you see
Tragedy

Pained ages
Bowed fast to your evil will
Black heart of envy
I'm waiting to break free
I'm waiting to break free

I prayed on your dark dream
Grown great on your fantasy
Your sin revealed me
Your hate released me,
your hate released me

Shades of your little nightmare
Days of your past life are haunting you
Shape shift now, I'm your master
Can you see
Tragedy

Your days, your days
are mine forever
And your poisoned soul,
Your will chained to mine

I'm banished forever now
The world of light's lost to you
I stole your life's breath
Yet rolled you off to death

Wretch now I've made you mine
Come feel my malice so cold
Your darkness in me
My shadow in you, my shadow in you
My shadow, my shadow in you
