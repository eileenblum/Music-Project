[Lyrics: Torben Askholm]

I heard them calling
from a discrowned sky
Whispers in the darkness
The angels have fallen tonight

Faith is not an illusion
It's part of our lives
Life's filled with confusion
We might as well take our lives

Unconcious I'm lying
On the brink to insanity
No more broken promises
I'm a broken entity

Can you see me
Can you hear my call...
Please never leave me...
Don't ever let me fall...

See they are falling
Lost without a trace
Bewildered like children
All they needed was a little faith

Concealed from within
Our lord is calling
Blinded by our sins
We'll never win

Unconcious I'm lying
On the brink to insanity
No more broken promises
I'm a broken entity

Can you see me
Can you hear my call...
Please never leave me...
Don't ever let me fall...
