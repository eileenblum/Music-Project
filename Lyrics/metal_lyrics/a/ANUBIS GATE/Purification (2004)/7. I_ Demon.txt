[Lyrics: Torben Askholm]

Demons go all the way
Unbound on their righteous trail
They were graced by time
Living through their lies

Take me piece by piece
Want to share our common greed
Demonized by the seed
Life is what I need

Confounded in the maze of my soul
You are, you are a castaway
I wonder, I wonder who you are
Are you a demon or are you a god?
Can't see my way through the mist of it all
I found my way through the darkness
Oh Lord

Fuel my righteous hate
The sum of all my fears
I'm spinning around
My world comes tumbling down
Fuel my righteous anger
My hope has been slain
Years in pain, years in misery
Misery

Through centuries of fear
Ages of sin
Years of silence
We became dead from within
Fells like I'm falling
Can hear no sound

Fuel my righteous hate
The sum of all my fears
My world comes tumbling down
Fuel my righteous anger
My hope has been slain
Years in pain, years in misery
Misery, misery
