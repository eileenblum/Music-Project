[Lyrics by Torben Askholm]

I seek one mind
I seek one soul
I hear the beating of my heart

I seek one truth
I seek a place in life
Where I'm worthy of your trust

It clouds my mind
When I'm reaching out for you
Leaving me so cold and alone

Show me what's concealed
Within these walls
An everlasting pain, or is it joy?

I wish you would hold me now
Take away my fears
Let it all out again

I'm losing my way
Taking a last look at my life
Death may be the peace I'm longing for

Father of pain
Father of fear
Please take my darkness away
Father of pain
Father of fear
Bring back my world again

Is this a nightmare?
Or is it reality?
Bringing back my memories

Another spin on life
Another spin on death
For those who feel the same as I do

If I disagree
You might not want to hear of me
Can't hold back the screams anymore

Father of pain
Father of fear
Please take my darkness away
Father of pain
Father of fear
Bring back my world again

He's my father
Father of fear
You are my pain
Father of pain
Brings us the shame
Want to walk into the light

He's my father
Father of fear
You are my pain
Father
Father
You
You
You're my father
