[Lyrics: Henrik Fevre]

Hypernosis, learn to see
Life and death from fantasy
Itâs you your mind is reflecting now

Hypernosis, this is it
The colour doesnât seem to fit,
But itâs you, oh you better believe itâs you

Hypernosis, every dream
Is caught within your thoughtmachine
And itâs cruel to see how confused you are

When hypernosis comes to end
Thereâs no way you can still pretend
And live on like nothing is wrong

I canât stop, I canât stop this silence
Or tell past from presence
Iâm lost in the hands of the future
Looking through my mirror

In my face a number of odd times,
Bad dreams and old crimes
Episodes from my motherâs diary
Written on my body

Hypernosisâ¦

Inside, inside the odious
Long lost and precious
Lies a deranged and repressed existence
Trapped from surfacing in silence

Now Iâm here Iâll force you to surface
Get up, get out and accept your guilt
What youâve done can never be undone
But forgiveness you shall get from above
