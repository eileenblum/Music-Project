[Lyrics: Sonia Vasan]

In the twilight gloaming
I glimpsed your silhouette
In the shroud of midnight I heard you call my name

In the first cold light of dawn
I felt your warmth beside me
And your breath became tears upon my cheek

And if you do not tremble
When you behold your sin
And if you don't recoil
When you look into the mirror
The ghosts of yesterday will conquer you
For those who seek redemption
And I must burn, I will burn

You cast your veil of lead
Your beauty, my pain
Was it all a dream, phantom of my mind?
Was I your creator?
Or your destroyer?
Yet you fled from my arms, where no mortal could go

And if you do not tremble
When you behold your sin
And if you don't recoil
When you look into the mirror
The ghosts of yesterday will conquer you)
For those who seek redemption
And I'll burn and I'll burn forever
