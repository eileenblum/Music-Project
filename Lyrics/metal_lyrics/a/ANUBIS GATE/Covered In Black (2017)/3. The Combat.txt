They fight
Every night
When she's alone in the pale blue light
People running with fire through the air
Taking eye for an eye and she's there

Engaged in

Combat
In the stream, you might might get away when dying
But out here
Out here
It's no game

You will find that your little world will be torn apart
Along with your name

She hides
In the sky
Alert and armed by a thousand whys
How come everyone's turning from her?
The enemy fades and she's caught in a blur

Engaged in

Combat
In the stream you might get away when dying
Out here
Out here it's no game

But you will find that your little world could be torn apart
Smoldering

New breed of peons
Post era in realities
Yeah
Whoa
Whoa

Combat
In a stream you might get to play the hero
Awaiting
A quaking inferno
But you will find that your little world could be torn apart
In one day
