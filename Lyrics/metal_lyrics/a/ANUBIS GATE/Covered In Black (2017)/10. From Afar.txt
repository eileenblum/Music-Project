Born and raised
In the dirt
Guess you're right where you belong
Don't you speak
You'll get hurt
Guess you're always in the wrong
Covered in disdain
Your whole childhood sin a blur
Anguish will remain
Until it's over

Lights will find you
They can see you from afar
Lights will find you
Doesn't matter where you are
Lights will find you
You will never need to hide
Lights will find you
To put your miseries aside

Faced with few alternatives
In this world of right and wrong
All your skills
So much to give
Hold your head up and be strong

Cruel shut the door
Turned your future bleak and fried
Cruel dashed your dreams and left you with the question why

Lights will find you
They can see you from afar
Lights will find you
Doesn't matter where you are
Lights will find you
You will never need to hide
Lights will find you
To put your miseries aside

Covered all in black
As you've given up on life
Stopped dead in your tracks
When these unexpected lights arrive

Lights will find you
They can see you from afar
Lights will find you
Doesn't matter where you are
Lights will find you
You will never need to hide
Lights will find you
To put your miseries aside
