Would it be nice somehow
To lose the plot somehow
Jump off a cliff somehow
Go off a ledge somehow

In the red of night
I'm tempted
In the red of night
I face it all

In the blue of day
I'm haunted
In the blue of day
I take the fall

In the purple dusk
I fight it
In the purple dusk
I stand so tall

In the red of night
I'm tempted
In the red of night
I face it all

In the blue of day
I'm haunted
In the blue of day
I take the fall

There is no time to spare
There's not much time to care
So take me anywhere
Anywhere but here
