Deep inside
I'm carrying the hits and beatings
Of a life
I feel hasn't yet begun
I can hide
The flesh from underneath the bleedings
But the scar
Can never be undone

Every time I go black
Every time I go black
Every time I go black
It's haunting me

I felt so forlorn
My trust in other people faded
As my name
Was trashed all over town
Laughed to scorn
My skin was burnt and saturated
By the crowd
Who worked to bring me down

Every time I go black
Every time I go black
Every time I go black
You're all I see

You would not believe
If I told you what these eyes have witnessed
There's no room
For the young and different
I'm relieved
That my calmer days have finally surfaced
But I still assume
I'm wrong and diffident

Every time I go black
Every time I go black
Every time I go black
I'm all You'll see
