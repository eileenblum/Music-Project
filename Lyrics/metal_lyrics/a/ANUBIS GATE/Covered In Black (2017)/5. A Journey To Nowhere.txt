Cold as ice
And warm like rain
You opened up
And closed again

But no one knew
You caught the fire
But let it go
This time I'm here
To make it cold
Inside of you

Throughout the years
The walls came tumbling
Down in your head

I recall
On that day
Your world went wrong
You could not stay
Our lives turned upside-down
In vain
Looking for ghosts your mind created
A journey to nowhere...

Whatever you may find out here
The road you're on will take you home
Your search for answers perseveres
Until you're free and we'll be gone

(Whirlwind blowin' in you) Whatever you may find out here
(Whirlwind blowin' in you) The road you're on will take you home
(Whirlwind blowin' in you) Your search for answers perseveres
(Whirlwind blowin' in you) Until you're free and we'll be gone
Yeah-

Won't you accept
Your life and give up
This journey to nowhere?
