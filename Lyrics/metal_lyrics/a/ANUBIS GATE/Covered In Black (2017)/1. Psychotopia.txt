I don't believe
I ordered this kind
Of evacuation

Out of reach
Been hiding for years
I thought you'd leave me alone

Brought to live
Within confined space
Best cure for sickness

A mind to solve
In so many ways
Easily disarmed and dismayed

Goodbye abandoned wastelands
You're here safe in my hands

You tucked me in
Ready to go
Off on my own, good

My vivid thoughts
Must cease to flow
If only they could

See the world from my perspective
Lessons learned, so hard to forgive

And we were determined
To leave this hell without you

Trapped in your psychotopia
Psychotopia

Can't say from the playbill
Amongst the mentally ill

I'm down and determined
To leave this hell without you

Deep down in psychotopia

I run through the exit
The camera stands before me

Trapped in your psychotopia
Psychotopia
Psychotopia
In psychotopia
