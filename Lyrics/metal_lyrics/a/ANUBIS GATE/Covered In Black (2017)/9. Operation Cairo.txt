The meeting is adjourned
'Cause somewhere in the system
We were compromised
But won't abort the mission

Our enterprise
On something tithed
Returned too late

Execute Plan B
And a thorough inquisition
Someone spoke a name
Seen out of his position

I am here to save this life
And I'm here to save goodbyes
Yes I'm here to turn things round
To bring our feet back on the ground

Ready to unfold
The injudicious riot
Forces moving in
To make a strong man quiet

Come on, come in
Talk liberties about to fall

In the nick of time
When he's eye to eye with darkness
I manage to prevent
A horrendous act of injustice

I am here to save this life
And I'm here to save goodbyes
Yes I'm here to turn things round
To bring our feet back on the ground

(And the light will fall on these heathens)

I am here to save this life
And I'm here to save goodbyes
Yes I'm here to turn things round
To bring our feet back on the ground

Moving to the underworld of Cairo
Walking to make a man disappear
The guns are last, lurking in the shadows
It's troublesome to make it out in the clear

Real life corruption
Twisted and turning
To new game production
Now it's all up to you

And I'm here to blow your mind
And you're next â recount that line
To feel to the blood upon your hands
In this addictive game of chance
