It's a thought that I've had for years
So many brooks, only one may drown these boiling tears
But it's a roll on a coaster ride
Keeping track of the passing tireless light

With open arms, she took me in
Set sail when you offered shelter from the wind
But being foolish and unaware
I navigated and shipwrecked our affair

You don't know
But I died when they redid you
But diligent, just spent the time

You don't know
But I've been through
Every facet
I bet it's just a case
Of too much time

I've never thought I'd be counting days
Every minute just another book I'll fascinate
I shoulda shaken a different tree
I lost sight of the life I thought was meant for me

You don't know
But I've been haunted by emotions
And the ghost of a shattered dream

You don't know
But I've caused a grand commotion
And reached an all time low

Think again
Before we break the chain

You don't know
But every thought, every aspect
I've been foolish and unaware

You don't know
But I was a better prospect
Reflections come to show

Think again
Before you break the chain
Stop, rewind
No, you can't undo your mind
No

You don't know
But you're still alive in my diary
My fate is just a case
Of too much time

There's nothing I can say
To make it go away
What if I'm not to blame?
What if I'm still the same?
