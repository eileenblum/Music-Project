(Far separated from its winter
A blizzard would rage for one day
While strong men fought the uneven battle
The wind poured out its pain and dismay)

Wait for the anger to subdue itself
You don't have the strength to change it
Like tossed from above without warning
A fistful of ice swiftly stunned him

A voice was heard "You're gonna fly! Guess you can say your last prayer. But I won't let you go. You're gonna fly. Fooled by the undertow."

Snowbound
Boy embraced to death by cold hands of winter
Never had a chance to say goodbye

(As quickly as it had unfolded
The blizzard deceased after taking its toll)

Damage was done when they came to aid
He was cold as the snow he lay upon
As he fought to survive
His struggles carved in snow
Almost angelic.

"You're gonna fly! Snowbound and dressed all in white. But your spirit will rise. You're gonna fly. Embark on excursion demise."

Snowbound
Boy embraced to death by cold hands of heaven
Never had a chance to say goodbye
Never had a chance to say goodbye

Snowbound
Boy embraced to death by the cold hands of heaven
Never had a chance to say goodbye
Snowbound
Boy embraced to death by the cold hands of heaven
Never had a chance to say goodbye
Say goodbye

Left a sea of questions
Left a crowd in grief
