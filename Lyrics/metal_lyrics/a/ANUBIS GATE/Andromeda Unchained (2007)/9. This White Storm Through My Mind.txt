In these rare moments
I feel history
I feel it coming
These waves

This white storm through my mind
Chromed numbness
Determined, here I am

Tired to the bone....
Ignition sequence have started. 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0......

In this sole emptiness
Before the promises
Before the maggots
I caught your eyes for seconds

This white storm through my mind
Chromed numbness
Determined, here I am

Homo erectus
Sapiens
Destructus
Shallow mind, hollow heart

This white storm through my mind
Chromed numbness
Determined, here I am

Strive to reach
Stop at nothing
Strive to reach
Stop at nothing
Evolution illusion
