Welcome to the city of delusion
To the land of your dreams
Now I know that behind these walls
Nothing's what it seems
Children on their bones

You can take me home
I don't want to live here no more!
You can take me home

I can't walk the streets alone at night
'cause tensions of fear
Emerge from everywhere
Worlds at war
No one knows who's right and what it's for
No one seems to care

You can take me home!
I don't want to live here no more!
You can take me home
So you can take me home!
Take me home
