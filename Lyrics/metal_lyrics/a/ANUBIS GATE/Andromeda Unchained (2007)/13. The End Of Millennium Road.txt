All ready!
Time has come to enter
The kingdom of glory
Journey we've waited for

Prediscovered entrance
Far into the future
There foreseen: the early premonition

End of all we know
Dice with death and blood will flow
This was a game of chance
A cruel life romance
Earth is old and frail
Waiting only to exhale
Retaliation for years
Of misuse and devastation

This is the end of millennium road
Standing at the end of millennium road
Standing at the end
This is the end of millennium road

Steep climbing
As company's approaching
What we determine
This moment is crucial
Decide!
Face the strength in anger
Or flee before ignition
History has taught us
Life has no guarantee

Caged like mother's womb
We escape this day of doom
On intergalactic streams
We travel in dreams
Safe and sound we'll rise
From the ashes of demise
Blessed with the powers to heal
Through a new orders coming

This is the end of millennium road
Standing at the end of millennium road
Standing at the end
This is the end of millennium road

Weightless afloat in a distant sky
With wistful gesture we say goodbye
Implosion occasioned
Billions of habitants cry

Every ocean was burning
Heaven roared from blood red skies

Up running
Our liquid inner systems
Watching the battle of doubtful identity
Displayed
Destination typed in
With confidence we enter
Dimension B
The source of alternate energy

Caged like mother's womb
We escaped this day of doom
On intergalactic streams
We travel in dreams
Safe and sound we'll rise
From the ashes of demise
Blessed with the powers to heal
Through a new orders coming

This is the end of millennium road
Standing at the end of millennium road
Standing at the end
This is the end of millennium road
