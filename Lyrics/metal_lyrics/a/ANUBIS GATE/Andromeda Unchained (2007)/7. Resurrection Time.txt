Pale behind the door
I'm doomed to follow
The road to nevermore
On a quest to seek my sorrow

But the steps are upside down
With no banisters to cling on to
I fall without a sound
Through massive halls within you

Pictures of past days discourage my mind
I can no longer tell real from designed

Far from the bottom I'm ready to burn
But fate won't relieve me
From what I must learn

You stayed too long to fight the game
Of passion, war and crime
A self obsessive dream remained
It's resurrection time

Your eyes turn to stone
As I throw the light upon you
Stripped down to the bone
On the path between true and untrue

The answer's loud and clear: we are different dimensions
Flesh will always fear
Bodies with no tensions
Pictures within you will guide you to see
Your whole creation was taken from me

Trusting your false intuition was right
Came to a bitter conclusion tonight

You stayed too long to fight the game
Of passion, war and crime
A self obsessive dream remained
It's resurrection time
