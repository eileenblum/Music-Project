The world's beneath me
The papers of tomorrow
I foresee the name of the game
No hesitation
No complication
All and sundry knows my name

Behold!
I've the strength to survive
I believe I'll derive your every thought from you
Observe, watch and learn
Do you feel the same
Or are you left behind
Reach inside your mind

At my disposal: the key to equilibrium
Anywhere
Combing powers
Of cerebral matters
Enter a godlike heir

Beware!
I've the strength to survive
I believe I'll derive your every thought from you
Observe, watch and learn
Do you feel the same
Or are you left behind
Reach inside your mind

Behold!
I've the strength to survive
I believe I'll derive your every thought from you
Observe, watch and learn
Do you feel your inmost thoughts
Are changing minds
I'll drain you from behind

I'm a king beyond redemption
And all mankind
Shall taste my cruel passion
I'll create a thoughtworld
Upon your minds
And call it my home
