Moving in to possess
The kingdom of long ago
Perfect host for our dream

Run, boy, run
And eat your way through
To the heart of mainframe stream
Turn off and let us in

This is the beginning
Great improvement to your empty world
Can't help laughing

It's a sinister display
Of disorder and decay
You've been taken in and restrained
Andromeda unchained

We were outcast from the stars
Soldiers of a different time
Separating the structure from within

Forged ahead
We face the door to control
The lives of those
Who so cruelly turned against us

This is the beginning
Great improvement to your empty world
Repossessing

It's a sinister display
Of disorder and decay
You've been taken in and restrained
Andromeda unchained

You chained the stars to your advantage
(And) standardized our minds
A make-believe world of order
Exposure's due, supernova!
Your reign is over

This is the beginning
Great improvement to your empty world
Reconstructing

This elaborate display
Of disorder and decay
You've been taken in and restrained
Andromeda unchained
