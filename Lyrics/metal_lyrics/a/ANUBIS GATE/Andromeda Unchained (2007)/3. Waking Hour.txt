I saw them coming in a haze from afar
The distant rumbling, we thought this meant war
Fled to Sector X - The pitch black blinded me
Silence was deafening as the hours went by
Resistance was futile, blood will fill the sky
And there was still enough time to flee

Echo my name, I know you're in here
Show me the way
Through the streets of anguish
You know the game
Survival from our judgment day

Waking hour!
Heaven, take my hand

Our entrails were burning on this day of wrath
Still no one was leaving, still walking the path
Be all my sins remembered, as there will be no more
The first hit echoed - walls would not suffice
The darkness splintered by the light of starry eyes
Soon the heavens open up its doors

Echo my name, I know you're in here
Show me the way
Through the streets of anguish
You know the game
Survival from our judgment day

Waking hour!
Heaven, show your face!
Take my power
I'm unworthy of your grace

Surrender to the lord on high
We're all guilty
The incredible work is wrecked
We've been to blind to see

Waking hour!
Heaven, take my hand
Take my power
I'm unworthy of your grace
Waking hour!
Heaven, take my hand
