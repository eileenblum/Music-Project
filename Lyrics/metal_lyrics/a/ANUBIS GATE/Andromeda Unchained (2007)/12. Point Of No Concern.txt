Take her away
She's had a fit of remembrance once again
Hold her still, you know the drill
We're losing control
If we can't enforce our present regulations

Make the prescribed preparations
Nowhere you can hide
Kept under surveillance
Whatever you decide
You got no independence

The fear we knew won't return
The point of no concern
The fear we knew won't return

Cast from side to side
In a cold machinery
Erasing pain from history
Careless memories
Now ready to be restored

In your mind
Nowhere you can hide
Kept under surveillance
Whatever you decide
You got no independence

The fear we knew won't return
The point of no concern
The fear we knew won't return

Back to "reality"
Recreated, safe and sound
Take a seat, enjoy the ride
With new identity
In familiar surroundings yet unknown
To her mind

The fear we knew won't return
No concern
The fear we knew won't return
