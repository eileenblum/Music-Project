Fear of the unknown day
That comes alive tomorrow
Fear of the voices telling you
What you ought to know?

Kingdom come
The secret lies within
Kingdom come
When you believe, you win
Kingdom come
Your demons canât resist
Kingdom come
Happiness

Fear that your life will never be
What you imagined?
Fear that your thoughts will throw you up
Against the wall, my friend?

Kingdom come
The secret lies within
Kingdom come
When you believe, you win
Kingdom come
Your demons canât resist
Kingdom come
Happiness

Wasting your time
Your thoughts can pull you down
Wasting your time
Reach out, accept your crown
Wasting your time
Youâve put your life on hold
Wasting your time
Let go, just watch it unfold

Kingdom come
The secret lies within
Kingdom come
When you believe, you win
Kingdom come
Your demons canât resist
Kingdom come
Happiness

Wasting your time
Your thoughts can pull you down
Youâve put your life on hold
Just watch it unfold
