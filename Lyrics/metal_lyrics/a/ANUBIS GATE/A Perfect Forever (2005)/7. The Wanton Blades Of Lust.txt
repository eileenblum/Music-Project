How a man may fall, how a maid may crawl
Long and bitter ages bound
How I plead my sin into the ground
My soul ached forth the nightmare from my lips

Torment unending from judgement unsparing
Steadfast am I here in Hell
While your liquid hate devours my flesh

Watching the chosen, treading the hallowed path
Light ones, you never falter
The bread of virtue melts in your mouths
Such pure souls, you enemies of the earth

All my life I cursed the blood in my veins
All my life I ripped the flesh from my bones
All my life I warred with the scarlet hordes
All my life I shattered every last stone

For I looked into the mirror of desire
Dared to touch the mystery
And the dew of mercy kissed me not
And the shadows breathed of my eternal pain

So I ask again, from the mouth of despair
Which is the greater disgrace?
The flesh of sin, so weak and corrupt
Or the spirit and its holy disease?

All my life I cursed the blood in my veins
All my life I ripped the flesh from my bones
All my life I warred with the scarlet hordes
All my life I shattered every last stone

All my life I cursed the blood in my veins
All my life I ripped the flesh from my bones
All my life I warred with the scarlet hordes
All my life I ripped the flesh from my bones
I warred with the scarlet hordes
I shattered every last stone
