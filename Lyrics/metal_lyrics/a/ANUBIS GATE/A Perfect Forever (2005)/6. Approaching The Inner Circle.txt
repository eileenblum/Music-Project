Pulled up before my eyes
From thick ties of blood
The picture of a sick head
Left in pain to rot
The connection that once was
I cut off every tie
His hands evoked disgust
His mouth only spoke in lies

Unavoidable confrontation
Indispensable disgrace
Approaching inner circle

Long lost memories come alive
The further down I go
One by one the pieces fit
The puzzle in my know
Oh how it hurts
Images I see
Now I faintly recall
What you once did to me

Unavoidable confrontation
Indispensable disgrace
Approaching inner circle

Come to me
Help me through the endless misery
Donât you leave me now

At the end of the rope
I venture to see
And everywhere I look
Angels watching me
At the end of the rope
I venture to see
And everywhere I look
Angels watching me

Approaching inner circle
The mysteryâs in sight
Approaching inner circle
With agony and fright
