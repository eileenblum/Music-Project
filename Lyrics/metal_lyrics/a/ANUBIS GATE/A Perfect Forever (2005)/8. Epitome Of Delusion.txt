I take your lives cause I love you
To save your souls
From the bitter truth

The writing on the wall
We couldnât quite believe it
The words just said it all
But we took to fantasy
Another child was born
The beginning of my delusion
To cover up the facts
That we were losing all we had

Possessed by the impossible dream
We had lost all common sense
In pursuit of everything
Possessed by the impossible dream
We had lost all common sense
In pursuit of everything

I felt forced to follow suit
The epitome of delusion
No one had to know
What I was really struggling with
Behind laughs and phoney smiles
I kept the secrets close to me
A 20 hour working day
Was meant to make us stay

In this world of impossible dreams
We had lost all common sense
In pursuit of everything
In this world of impossible dreams
We had lost all common sense
In pursuit of everything

I canât tall you where we stand
Apology with gun in hand

Possessed by the impossible dream
We had lost all common sense
In pursuit of everything
Possessed by the impossible dream
We had lost all common sense
In pursuit of everything

Possessed by the impossible dream
We had lost all common sense
In pursuit of everything
Possessed by the impossible dream
We had lost all common sense
In pursuit of everything
The impossible dream
In pursuit of everything
The impossible dream
