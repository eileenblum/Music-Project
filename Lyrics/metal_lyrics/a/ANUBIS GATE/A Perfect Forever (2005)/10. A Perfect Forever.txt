Spinning a tale greater than man
Utopia unfolds
Days of redemption, a promised land
Utopia unfolds

I hold the key to eternal life
Itâs buried beneath us all
I hold the key to your last breath
I make those great men fall

We were abandoned, left for good
Darkness descends
Wisdom perishes, ignorance prevails
It never end

I hold the key to eternal life
Itâs buried beneath us all
I hold the key to your last breath
I make those great men fall

Fury takes my heart
Despairs takes my soul
Rage tears me apart
Life has taken its toll

In the greatest philosophy
A perfect forever
Lies the root of duplicity
A perfect forever
But nothing endures forever

Discouraged and paralysed
Realising the truth
Everything that we create, shatters
All that was meant to last

In the Valley of Kings
A perfect forever
In the Roman Ruins
A perfect forever
Nothing endures forever

We had the battle of Somme
The ignorance of Bhopal
Annihilation in Auschwitz
And the destruction of Hiroshima

We survived centuries of disasters
Eons of ideologies
Eternities of war
But for how long?

In the safety of our homes
A perfect forever
In the closeness of dear ones
A perfect forever
Somewhere in the future
A perfect forever
Our proudest structures fall
Nothing stands forever
But Iâd like to be proven wrong

We held the key to eternal life
We let it slip away
And when we reach the end of days
All things must pass away
All things must pass away
All things must pass away
