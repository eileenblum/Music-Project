You always hurt my feelings
You always claimed to be a friend
My anger took over
Erasing your lifeâs flame

All those years to remember
Itâs a question of faith
And who is to blame now
Itâs give and take

Glorified
Weâre torn to pieces
Crucified
You watch us die
Petrified
No more excuses
Oh, I am sanctified
Glorified
Weâre torn to pieces
Crucified
You watch us die
Petrified
No more excuses
Oh, I am sanctified

Heavenly father
Why do we suffer this pain
Devoted, gracefully
Sweeping my frail soul

You took all for granted
Never showed gratitude
My burning fury
Turned my vengeance loose

All those years forgotten
Nothing left I can do
The lord is calling
I did it all for you

Glorified
Weâre torn to pieces
Crucified
You watch us die
Petrified
No more excuses
Oh, I am sanctified
Glorified
Weâre torn to pieces
Crucified
You watch us die
Petrified
No more excuses
Oh, I am sanctified

You always hurt my feelings
You always claimed to be a friend
And whoâs to blame now
Itâs give and take

Glorified
Weâre torn to pieces
Petrified
No more excuses
No more, no more
Glorified
We are torn to pieces
Crucified
You watch us die
Petrified
No more excuses
No more excuses

Sanctified
