You, you speak of changing times
In the light of the battles we won
You believe in miracles
Once the door to eternity is gone
Hiding your face, changing your name
Donât let a single thought remain
Out on the road
To a braver, faster world

Here is the future without past
A wicked world forecast
Of the days about to come our way
But itâs a future in disgrace
All reason we displace
Uncertain is the price we pay

Thrust into this man-made dream machine
We believe in the fairy tales we seek
Tomorrow dawns
Before we break of yesterday
Tumbling around
âCause the sunlightâs way behind
Look straight ahead, no time to waste
Life you once knew is now erased
Let go of yourself
And you wonât remember pain

Here is the future without past
A wicked world forecast
Of the days about to come our way
But itâs a future in disgrace
All knowledge cast in haze
Uncertain is the price we pay
