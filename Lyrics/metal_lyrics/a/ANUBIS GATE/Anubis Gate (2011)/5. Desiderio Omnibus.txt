[Music: Jesper M Jensen]
[Vocal melodies: Henrik Fevre]

Lord, I won't deny
I feel allured to try
Interfering with life
and the way we die

Mortal mastery
In darkened scenery
I do the studied downfall
Ready to evolve a

Death control
Training to blow my inglorious life away
And this could be my lucky day

I'm set on going deep
through mind-expanding sleep
to the end and beyond
where no living's ever gone

Feel the whole
Of being in control
On the fabled verge of grandeur:
Perspicuity compared to none

In the mist of dreams
Through a thousand halls of screams
(Deep down: the divine)
I stand before the divine:
The eternal sands of time
(Deep down I feel the)

Death control
I'm able to blow my inglorious life away
And then come back another day
To find the world of the living
Is gracious but dangerous
'cause there's longing in all of us

Desiderio omnibus
