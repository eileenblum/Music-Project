Go on
You've got a lot to live for
Before blood enters the clotting stage
Now there's a fine line
between you and your behaviour
that once was reckless and bursting with rage

It's time to reconsider
Your life is turning bitter

So fly into the sun
Fly into the sun

No one said it was now or never
As time passed you figured it out on your own
There's a number of puzzles unsolved in your mind
For completion, search and you will find

Beware, your past is calling
you out on the edge, you're falling

You fly into the sun
Unveiling your deepest secrets
Fly into the sun
It's only just begun

Throw off your stifling inhibitions
Step in, rave and take what belongs to you

Fly into the sun
It's only just begun
