Juvenile white male died
Brutally battered and ditched in a fountain at dawn
Suspect found, now gagged and bound
I've access to your every thought since the day you were born

I use your eyes,
I use your eyes to see
Telltale eyes
I use your eyes

On display: Yesterday you were taken by feelings you'd never dealt with before
Horrific news, you blew a fuse:
The secret you'd guarded for years had started a war

I use your eyes,
I use your eyes to see
Telltale eyes
I use your eyes

When I gaze at the pictures I find
Every one is a glimpse of your lost mind
You've got nothing to wear but the stains;
the memories of a life in pain

There's an image of all you survey
Every time you were lead down the wrong way
Sneaking out with your pride still intact
just won't be your act
(No way out today - Your mind is on display)

Cornered by this desperate guy
who claimed that he's your flesh and blood
just pushed you this far...

I use your eyes,
I use your eyes to see
Telltale eyes
