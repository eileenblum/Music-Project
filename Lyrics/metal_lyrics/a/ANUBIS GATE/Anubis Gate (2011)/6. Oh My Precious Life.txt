[Music: Henrik Fevre, Kim Olesen]
[Vocal melodies: Henrik Fevre]

I've been taught to measure my time
And I've learnt about this young man
whose carelessness was considered a crime
A destitute and weak also-ran

I stand by the door
Disintegrated
Oh my precious
But cut to the core
It's all I ever wanted
Oh my precious

I fought to live out my dreams
But you tossed and turned 'em your way
From regular and bureaucratic schemes:
A hollow man with nothing to say

I stand by the door
Disintegrated
Oh my precious
But cut to the core
It's all I ever wanted
Oh my precious

I've had the notion
I've been wasting all my life
'cause all wanted
was a world of my own
Without you

I stand by the door
Disintegrated
Oh my precious
But cut to the core
Itâs all I ever wanted
Oh my precious
