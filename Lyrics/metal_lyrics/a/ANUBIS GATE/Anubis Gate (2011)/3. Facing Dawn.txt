Take a seat
The air is bittersweet
Yesterday's news

If I had the strength
to see beyond myself
I might refuse

Trembling boy
defends his weaker hand
with pride and joy

Watching as my life
implodes into the night
Facing dawn

No, I can't give you reason
And I won't search for treason
In a world where I belong

And I don't need no answers
No questions need no answers
An inhuman fight for treasures
In this world where I belong
Just before I face the dawn

Roll the dice
A day in paradise
The blind may lead the blind

Taken by the rise
and lost to endless lows
and groundless highs

As this game of chance
dissolves into the night
I'm facing dawn

No, I can't give you reason
And I wonât search for treason
In a world where I belong

And I don't need no answers
No questions need no answers
An inhuman fight for treasures
In this world where I belong
Just before I face the dawn

I'm master of naivete
And with everything I own
In case the night should turn to grey
I'm praying to be reborn
Before I face the dawn
