Thousands of acres
A blast or concrete
Tall cities rising from years of expertise

Rooms let to men with
Visions and designs
Map of the future in parallel fines

Born to acquire
The thought is common sense
The powers of possession
A world of Ãbermensch

Everybody's into the digital dream
Or caught in the hands of a government scheme

You've got what you want
The world in a dome
You've got what you want
The world in a dome
No contradictions, kept safely at home
The world in a dome

Do you ever wonder how you came this dose?
One step after the other
and a kingdom finally shows

Take hold of the possession
You sure know what to do
But handle with care or it may turn on you

You've got what you want
The world in a dome
You've got what you want
Tne world in a dome
No contradictions, kept safely at home
The world in a dome

Thousands of acres
A blast of concrete
Tall cities rising from years of expertise

Rooms let to men with
Visions and designs
Map of the future in parallel lines

Towering tangents
No room to spare
For charm and affection, for chaos and despair

A grand exhibition of feelings cast in chrome
The last constitution
World in a dome
