[Music: Jesper M Jensen]
[Vocal melodies: Henrik Fevre]

Morning comes early
And nighttime falls too late
Sometimes my shoulders bend from the weight

I've listened for hours
To the voices from within
Arranging my warfare as I'm shedding skin

It's been a long long time
That I've been down this hole
Separated from my deepest soul
It's recreation time
And though it scares me so
I'm off to see The Re-formation show

I'm usually hiding
While the world around me grows
Into the kind I'm reluctant to know

But lately I've wondered
If the sun would take me in
To cope with the life I long to begin

It's been a long long time
I lost my self-control
Separated from my deepest soul
It's dissolution time
and I'm about to go
Off to see The Re-formation show

Life goes on

It's been a long long time
That I've been down this hole
Separated from my deepest soul
It's disillusion time
I was supposed to
Off to see The Re-formation show
