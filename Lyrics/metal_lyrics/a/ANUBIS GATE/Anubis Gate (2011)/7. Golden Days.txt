[Music &amp; vocal melodies: Jacob Hansen]

Wind blows on me
Here comes my qolden days
It's the vital state I'm in
I see the lights
The lights that mesmerise
This young boy to dream on

Dying to go
Impatient to show
the powers I possess
I hunger for success

I find myself invincible
Collecting golden days
I'm counting golden days
My immortality goes on
Collecting qolden days
I'm talking golden days

I could be king
Well I could be anything
in the reckless state I'm in
Theyâll turn their heads
to learn my alphabet
It's the future state of

My world, my space
Old visions set ablaze
They'll sing my songs and pray
To be like me one day

I find myself invincible
Collecting golden days
I'm counting golden days
My immortality goes on
Collecting golden days
I'm talking golden days

Oh, my time had come
Oh, my time has gone

I find myself invisible
Collecting golden days,
Just counting golden days
My immortality is gone
Collecting golden days
I'm talking golden days

Rain pours on me
Here comes my golden days
It's the final stage Iâm in
I see the light that somehow mesmerized
this old mind to wisdom
Rain pours on me
Here goes my golden days
