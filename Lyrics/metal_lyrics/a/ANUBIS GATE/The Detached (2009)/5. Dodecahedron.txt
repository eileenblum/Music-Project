Out here at the timeline at lightspeed I travel although my thinking's barely moving
I'm recharging my senses
Awaiting tomorrow
One more place in time

Just a flash and I'll be back on earth again
Building dreams for free men
Just a flash and I'll be part of life again
Anywhen

Out here at the timeline
The dodecahedron retains the history we're living
A second home for the detached with room for reflection
Out of space and time

Just a flash and I'll be back on earth again
Building dreams for free men
Just a flash and I'll be part of life again
Anywhen

I penetrate the aerosphere
My destination's drawing near
Through halls of myth and dreamy light
The noise, the sand, the building site

Just a flash and I'll be back on earth again
Building dreams for free men
Just a flash and I'll be part of life again
Anywhen
