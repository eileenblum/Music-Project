Weightless in the morning light
I find myself awake
Vaguely I recall the night
My whole wide world at stake

I failed, she came
Broke into my game

In another time with blessing in her hand
She kneels before my bed and I'm supposed to understand

Somewhat older
Time weighs on her shoulders

No one can see all the worlds the have travelled
No on compares with their powers at hand
All of the pieces that puzzled their journey are now in position to land
No one can see it's a strange allegation
Detached with only a lifetime to share
The countdown has started for her expiration
A precious but mortal affair

Knowing that your hourglass has limited grains of sand defines our destiny
I won't part with repetition.
This is what I am
I choose infinity

I'll stay for long,
But some day I'll be gone

No one can see all the worlds the have travelled
No one compares with their powers at hand
All of the pieces that puzzled their journey are now in position to land
No one can see it's a strange allegation
Detached with only a lifetime to share
The countdown has started for her expiration
He's got all the time in the world to spare
