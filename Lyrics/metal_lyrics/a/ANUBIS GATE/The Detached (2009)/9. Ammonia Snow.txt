I look out, the moon is rising
The only light of my experiment:
Imprisonment

I lost myself
Lack of wealth
I lost myself and my mind

I needed time away to understand my deeds of yesterday
It's now a matter of repentance
This stay's about to turn my shady conscience back to live-and-learn
To find the meaning of existence

Engaged by deadly snowflakes
I face a long and painful destiny
Reality

I lost myself
Lack of wealth
I lost myself and my mind

I needed to address
Chaotic realms so easy to possess
I tripped and fell without resistance
This stay's about to turn
my shady conscience back to live-and-learn
To find the meaning of existence
