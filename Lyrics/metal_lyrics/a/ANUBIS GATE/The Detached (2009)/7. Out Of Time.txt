There's a fire within that may burn your skin
It can make you blind and leave the world behind
Every night we pray that our hearts be taken by these forces of magic some day
It may be today

Long time gone
My life was merely day by day
A lone crusade through self-denial and delay

The thought of something more kept me at war until my very mind was opened and out of time
Opened and out of time
When we spoke our words would take the form of a song
While joined in laughter and tears, my sense of time had disappeared

All the things we'd done meant nothing, once the ground we walked upon was replaced and out of time
Replaced and out of time

Replaced and out of time...
There's a light to guide us
Once we understand
