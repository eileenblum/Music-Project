I am enchanted by the tide
The mere anxiety for the ride

Find a way or make one to be heard
It's time to change

On backs of beasts we ride
Chaotic realms subconsciously defied
We're changing snowflakes into water
Bringing damaged cells to the slaughter

I'm on this quest to seek the truth
The scene is set for alteration
Using my powers of infinite youth
To dissolve the desolation
Find a way or make one to be seen
What's done can be undone

On backs of beasts we ride
Chaotic realms subconsciously defied
We're changing snowflakes into water
This journey's set to turn
All human conscience back to live-and-learn
Replacing liquid states with mortar

I am a soldier in the know
Leading a wishful path through the snow
with head held high

On backs of beasts we ride
Chaotic realms subconsciously defied
This journey's set to turn
All human conscience back to live-and-learn
Replacing liquid states with mortar
