It's a flaw, it's a crime
Sadly I've been fooled by time

Thus dissolved by the rain the lethal shower of ammonia caught me unrestrained

Nothing left to repent
My vivid journey finally came to end
As the Sphere caved in and left me in vain

I'm going nowhere
Le me out, hear my prayer
I'm going nowhere
Can't stand up, I'm trying to return to yesterday but my voice is numb and it won't obey

Trains of thought through my mind
How could I have been so blind?

All I gained from my crusade was a premonition of my death only much too late

Every time, every place comes to life within the inner space 'fore my mind gives in
Exhausted by pain

I'm going nowhere
Le me out, hear my prayer
I'm going nowhere
Can't stand up, I'm trying to return to yesterday but my voice is numb and it won't obey

Waiting there in the wings
Knowing what the future would bring
Patiently she watched him go from retraction to deep sorrow
Disintegration began but sheltered under her wingspan
His old heart clung to the bit of life that once was substance
Saved in silence
