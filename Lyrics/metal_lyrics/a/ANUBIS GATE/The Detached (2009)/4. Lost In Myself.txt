My weary soul's divided
I feel it questions all I am
All I am
The wavering inside it
A free man versus caged inhabitant on his own land
The mirrored face bewildered, a fierce contraction
Reaction

Lost in my self
Lack or wealth
Lost in my self and my mind

The skills that I've been given
A revelation?
Devastation?

Enforced eternity
Designed by destiny
My stand was never heard in this obscurity

Lost in my self
Lack or wealth
Lost in my self and my mind
