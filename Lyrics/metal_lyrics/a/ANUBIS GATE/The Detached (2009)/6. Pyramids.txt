Awaiting the sun
A monument of dreams to gaze upon
Tomorrow's foretold
A monument of grandeur will unfold

In this starry night I take a sight at these unworldly structures

In silence
I cross to other worlds
In my stargazing
There's an entrance to something more than this

Awaiting the sun
A monument of dreams to gaze upon
A new era's under way
Tomorrow's foretold
At the crucial break of day
A monument of grandeur will unfold

After ended warlike affairs we've turned our swords to plowshares

In silence
I tend to ask myself
What's eternal?
A delusion?
A fluid state of mind?

Awaiting the sun
A monument of dreams to gaze upon
When darkness turns to light
Tomorrow's foretold
A monument of grandeur will unfold
And it's reaching for the sky
Awaiting the sun
Awaiting the sun
Revealing's begun
