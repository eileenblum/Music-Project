From the urge to seek my sources
I travel to restore and bring myself to break down the door
I'm taken in by vicious forces to realms of death and horror
Submersion into the underworlds at war

Must face the madness though it hurts
Must face the blackness though it hurts

Mortal dread's become a drag on being one with my self

I seem to struggle with defences and the infinity of man threatened by the vulnerable "I am"
In every corner of my senses there's a will to alteration
It's been haunting me ad nauseam

Must face the madness though it hurts
Must face the blackness though it hurts

Mortal dread's become a drag on being one with my self

If someone's out there
I need a word for protection
And if you're out there this oath of blood is bonded by affection

Mortal dread's become a drag on being one with my self
Mortal dread's become a drag on being one with all else
Mortal dread's succumbed
Mortal dread's succumbed
