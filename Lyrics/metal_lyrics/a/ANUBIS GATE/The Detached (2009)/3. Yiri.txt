[Bilao:]
Out of the desert sun
Cathedral vaults so immense
Might even make an emperor lose his stature

[The brother:]
Wait! There's something in the air
You might feel it yourselves
A different chemistry among the brothers

[Bilao:]
I am here to understand the words you're singing
I know I'm a stranger
As yet just a stranger to this circle

The song's beguiling
The brothers are smiling
The distant feeling's gone
The same reflections
Profound intentions
Have brought us closer

[The brother:]
Your proficiency in language increases our chance to map the unknown co-ordinates of our futures

[Bilao:]
How to penetrate the mystery of second sight
The words of a Yiri!
A lifetime of travel compositions

The song's beguiling
The brothers are smiling
United we'll be
Searching for answers
Merging to answer
The holy questions of life

Eyes looking down in prayer

The song's beguiling
The brothers are smiling
United we'll be
Searching for answers
Merging to answer
The holy questions
Searching for reasons
Merging to reason
The holy questions of life
