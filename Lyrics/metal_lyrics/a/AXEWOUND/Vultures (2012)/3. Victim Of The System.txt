Dead in your eyes
Youâll be marked and buried
Countless past lives
Youâve been burnt at the stake

You can hear the screams from the darkness
Just counting the days till she dies
Praying for death

Never ending
With your plagues of the mind
Endless demons
Youâre just killing time just killing time
Itâll never stop
Itâll never quit
Till the day youâre dead
Trapped in a mind like a prison cell
This living hell

You can hear the screams from the darkness
Just counting the days till she dies

Praying for death

Self-medicated / / numb the pain
Victim of the system

Victim of the system
Left to die
Victim of the system
Left to their own demise
