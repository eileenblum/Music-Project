Release this body. Cleanse my soul
From the beginning. Bring on the EXORCHRIST

Take my life
I don't want purity
No longer weak inside
This evil's taking over me
Set me free from this insanity
I offer you this soul
Fill it with your blasphemy
My shattered bones and blackened heart
Will tear your fuckin faith apart
No longer will I walk alone
My body now he calls his home
I feel a presence taking over me

Release this body. Cleanse my soul
From the beginning. Bring on the EXORCHRIST

Freedom Reigns
No longer will I fear
My eyes see past the light
Can see the for what it's worth
Time has come
To leave this world behind
No longer bound to flesh
This darkness caries me away

I feel a presence taking over me

Release this body. Cleanse my soul
From the beginning. Bring on the EXORCHRIST

Hell hell drag me to hell
Set me free fucking drag me to hell

I feel a presence taking over me

Release this body. Cleanse my soul
From the beginning. Bring on the EXORCHRIST

Take this life
Long live the EXORCHRIST
