My eyes are bloodshot,
Blinded from the foil,
Sick from the nuclear waste.

I see you rising,
Everything is wasted,
Now it's time to dig in and survive.

Oh you might as well dig slow,
It doesn't matter cos it wouldn't do any good.

Every new funeral,
Everyone is equal,
The gods can't save you now.

Party apocalypse,
Party 'til you're dead.

When the world has gone to hell,
And there's nowhere left to turn,
This is our final countdown,
'Til we die.
When you know your days are numbered,
Make every second last,
This is our final countdown,
'Til we die.

Time was up when they flipped the switch,
And the whole world was set on fire.

Rather mad no one took the blame,
At last every politician's dead.

Days go by,
Oh it doesn't matter,
Best not to dwell on the past.

Apocalypse has happened,
Now we're just insisting:
Let's get this party started!

Party apocalypse,
Party 'til you're dead.

When the world has gone to hell,
And there's nowhere left to turn,
This is our final countdown,
'Til we die.
When you know your days are numbered,
Make every second last,
This is our final countdown,
'Til we die.

When the world has gone to hell,
When there's nowhere left to turn,
When you know your days are numbered,
Make every second last,
When the world has gone to hell,
When there's nowhere left to turn,
When you know your days are numbered,
Make every second last,
This is our final countdown

This is our final countdown
This is our final countdown
This is our final countdown
'TIL WE DIE!!!!!

When the world has gone to hell,
And there's nowhere left to turn,
This is our final countdown,
'Til we die.
When you know your days are numbered,
Make every second last,
This is our final countdown,
'Til we die.

THIS IS OUR FINAL COUNTDOWN!
THIS IS OUR FINAL COUNTDOWN!
THIS IS OUR FINAL COUNTDOWN!

'TIL WE DIE!!!!!
