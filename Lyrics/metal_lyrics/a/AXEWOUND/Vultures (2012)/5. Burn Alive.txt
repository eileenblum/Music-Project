Hate lives here
I want to crush to your soul
Repulsion disgust for every piece of you
I want to slit your fucking throat
I need to hear you scream
One focus destruction all crushing down on you
DOWN ON YOU

There's no escape from me nowhere left to hide
It's time to make it clear that vengeance will be mine

Your soul is now in hell
You must reside
As Satan's grip gets tighter
Forever burn alive

No way out
You're now within my grasp
Extensive this torture and savour all of this
Your cries for will go unheard
I need to hear you scream
No options it's hopeless I've come to watch you die

WATCH YOU DIE

There's no escape from me nowhere left to hide
It's time to make it clear that vengeance will be mine

Your soul is now in hell
You must reside
As Satan's grip gets tighter
Forever burn alive

You filthy piece of shit
Your fucking times run out
I want to drink your fucking blood
It's time for you to fucking Diiiiiiie

Your soul is not in hell VENGEANCE
Your soul is now in hell VENGEANCE

Your soul is now in hell
You must reside
As Satan's grip gets tighter
Forever burn alive

Vengeance will be mine
