I want to speak but can't describe
I want to see through your disguise
'Cause everytime you're near you leave me
COLD

PAIN
My salvation
I'm not afraid so fuck you and your apathy
FEAR
And frustration
You give me nothing
So take back all your sympathy
BREAK
This is carnage
Destroying all my strength and all my dignity
SNAP
Goes your backbone
If you're addicted to pain then come and get some more

You can't kill me
(Motherfucker)
You can't own me
(Motherfucker)
This is a matter of pride I'm not satisfied
You can't kill me

I want to speak but can't describe
I want to see through your disguise
'Cause everytime you're near you leave me
COLD

STOP
Your complaining
So sick of hearing your shit so fucking sick of it
HATE
Isn't fading
I wanna beat you down and take a piece of you

You can't kill me
(Motherfucker)
You can't own me
(Motherfucker)
This is a matter of pride I'm not satisfied
You can't kill me

I want to speak but can't describe
I want to see through your disguise
'Cause everytime you're near you leave me
Cold
I want to speak but can't describe
I want to see through your disguise
'Cause everytime you're near you leave me
Cold

You can't kill me
(Motherfucker)
You can't own me
(Motherfucker)
This is a matter of pride I'm not satisfied
You can't kill me
I want to speak but can't describe
I want to see through your disguise
'Cause everytime you're near you leave me
Cold
