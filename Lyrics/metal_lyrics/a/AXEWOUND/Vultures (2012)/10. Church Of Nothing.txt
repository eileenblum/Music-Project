Nihilistic
Short fuse, burnt cross
Scepticism
Flows through my veins
No devotion
No bridge un-burnt
Devastation
A moral war

Blind faith. Washed minds
In the Church Of Nothing

Blank stares. Dead hearts
In the Church Of Nothing
Weâre all dead in the eyes of the lord
Weâll break out when the heavens fall
Weâre all dead in the eyes of the lord
Weâre all dead. Weâre all dead

Disbeliever. Mark me, till death
Hell receiver. Reign down, on me
No salvation. No need, no point
Living wasteland. Reject it all

Blind faith. Washed minds
In the Church Of Nothing

Blank stares. Dead hearts
In the Church Of Nothing
Weâre all dead in the eyes of the lord
Weâll break out when the heavens fall
Weâre all dead in the eyes of the lord
Weâre all dead. Weâre all dead
Negatively. Last breath, ill curse
Great deceiver. No end, in sight
Contradiction. Drives me insane
Please indulge me. Pray for the worst

Blind faith. Washed minds
In the Church Of Nothing
Blank stares
Dead hearts
Weâre all dead in the eyes of the lord
Weâll break out when the heavens fall
Weâre all dead in the eyes of the lord
Weâre all dead. Weâre all dead
