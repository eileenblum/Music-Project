Hallucination in a world gone mad
(Thatâs left me blinded)
A search for truth in a pack of lies
(It canât be found)
A constant pull, no direction, no choice
(Iâll hold my ground)
It never stops, it forever just builds
(To tear us down)

Donât let them break you. Donât let them grind you down
Donât let them slit your throat. Donât let them bleed you dry

Nothing is sacred
Blood Money and lies
Nothing is sacred
Death and profits rise

You trade your life for the promise of wealth
(Then all hopeâs lost)
Fall to your knees at the monetary altar
(And sell your soul)
Pledge allegiance to your own moral death
(Itâs cast away)
And now you drowned in an ocean of greed
(Just like the rest)

Donât let them break you. Donât let them grind you down
Donât let them slit your throat. Donât let them bleed you dry

Nothing is sacred
Blood Money and lies
Nothing is sacred
Death and profits rise

Fuel the greed. Sell your soul
Just believe. Fuck the world

Fuck every day that living in this fucking nightmare surrounded,
Each waking hour every confrontation screaming FUCK your
Shallow ideals, itâs to the point of suffocation.
Iâm against the world so
Fuck me, fuck you FUCK EVERYTHING

Donât let them break you. Donât let them grind you down
Donât let them slit your throat. Donât let them bleed you dry

Nothing is sacred
Blood Money and lies
Nothing is sacred
Death and profits rise
