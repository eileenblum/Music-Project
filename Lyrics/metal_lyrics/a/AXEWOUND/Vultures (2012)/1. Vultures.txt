[feat. Synyster Gates]Did you think this would break me?
This fucking scratch won't slow me down
You are not the first
Far from the last

This betrayal you will pay

Did you think this would kill me?
You're ignorance just fucking fuels this fire
Your time will come
Just like the rest

Death To Traitors
Off with their heads
Death to traitors
They will pay

Kill every Vulture
Tear off their heads
Kill every Vulture
Kill them all

I will crush you
Leave you in ruin
I will crush you
Leave you destroyed
Leave your fucking corpse in the road
There to rot
I will crush you
And carry on

Death To Traitors
Off with their heads
Death to traitors
They will pay

Kill every Vulture
Tear off their heads
Kill every Vulture
Kill them all

Your wings will now be mine

Kill every Vulture
I want them fucking dead
Kill every Vulture
Bring me their fucking heads
