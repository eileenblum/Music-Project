Slash and burn in the fields of the mind
Leave your doubts in a smouldering pile
It eats away like a fucking disease
And leaves you dead inside

There is a war that exists inside of me
An internal fight

Murder all self doubt you've ever had
You are your only master
Set ablaze every piece of resolve
Ignite the fires inside

So now the time has come to kiss your ass goodbye

Destroy your fear
Slaughter what holds you back
Destroy your fear
It's time to crush this world

Oh! Fuck Yeah!

Demolition of the psyche
Eradication to the highest degree
Annihilation of the temperament
Leave it dead in the night

There is a war that exists inside of me
An internal fight

This is a funeral weakness
Left in unmarked graves
All regrets buried six feet deep
Where they're never betray

So now the time has come to kiss your ass goodbye

Destroy your fear
Slaughter what holds you back
Destroy your fear
It's time to crush this world

Crush, this, world, now
Crush, this, world, now

Destroy your fear
Slaughter what holds you back
Destroy your fear
It's time to crush this world
