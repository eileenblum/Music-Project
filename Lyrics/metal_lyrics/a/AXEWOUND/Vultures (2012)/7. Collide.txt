I feel the presence
Cold breath upon my skin
A tortured soul
That cries and begs for me
To let it in

Itâs in the shadows
I can feel you in my bones
Just manifest yourself
And show to me
I'm not alone

Yes itâs me in the shadows
It will be on your grave
I want to feast on your spirit
I want to make you my slave

Cast you away
Leave me alone
Here I will stay
For the rest of eternity

When these two worlds collide
Thereâs nothing left behind

Cast you away
Leave me alone
Here I will stay
For the rest of eternity

When our two worlds collide
Thereâs nothing left behind.

I hear the whisper
This future just wont subside
This fight I wont give in
My minds become a battlefield

Yes itâs me in the shadows
This will be on your grave
My only goal is to kill you
I'm gonna make you my slave

Cast you away
Leave me alone
Here I will stay
For the rest of eternity

When these two worlds collide
Thereâs nothing left behind

Cast you away
Leave me alone
Here I will stay
For the rest of eternity

When our two worlds collide
Thereâs nothing left behind.

When our two worlds collide
Thereâs nothing left behind.

No
I wont go
I wont go
I wont leave

No
I wont go
I wont leave
You can't get rid of me

No
I wont go
I wont go
I wont leave

No
I wont go
You can't get rid of me

Cast you away
Leave me alone
Here I will stay
For the rest of eternity

When these two worlds collide
Thereâs nothing left behind

Cast you away
Leave me alone
Here I will stay
For the rest of eternity

When our two worlds collide
Thereâs nothing left behind
