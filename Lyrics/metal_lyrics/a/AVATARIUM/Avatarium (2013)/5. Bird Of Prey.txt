There he is, man in masque...
Human bird of prey
Like the plague he elevates
From the sewers of decay
Sharpened claws, noble face...
Impeccable facade
Merciless and grim;
The bird of prey

Fog and night, Berlin square...
A demon in the street
The czar of blood appears
With a tongue so black and sweet
Crooked smile, a butcher's knife...
A crying moon betrays
Who is there to save you
From the bird of prey?

A bed of roses and glass...
Winter months they pass
I'm drowning like a little girl in May
A sharp smell of Cologne
I'm dying here alone
Is all this beauty just for me?
