Thoughts bound and concentrated
Burning like pyres
Opens new windows
In space and time

Magnified energy
A radiating brain
Dark electricity
My mind screams with pain

Uncharted powers
So beyond my control
Sending out signals
To a parallel world

White noise invasion
A vortex of amber
Wipes out the enemy
From my telepathic chamber

Tides of telepathy
Wave after wave
Psychic technology
Who are you?

Ancient machinery
Pulses released
Goes through the
Airwaves
Psychic war

Oh can you hear me?
I'm left here alone
Anybody out there?
My mind's shutting down
