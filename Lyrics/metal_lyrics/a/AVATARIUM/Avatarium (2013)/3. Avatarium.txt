Here inside the holy...
My private sanatorium
East of Lynx and Lyra...
And left of Aquarius
A secret spot, a shrine...
My own little pantheon
A place of temptation...
So I can go beyond
(So I can carry on)

Avatarium

The smallest room can be...
A giant Colosseum
Here inside my frontal...
Lobe cerebrum
It's a sanctuary...
A magic falsarium
Where I create the
Greatest mysterium

Avatarium

It's my asylum, my great auditorium
Where I drink the lifeblood
Plan the rebellion
Here's my mausoleum
The subbasement wonder room
4 silver stallions, a road to
Pandemonium
So many voices inside my head...

Avatarium

They speak of the living
They speak of the dead...

Avatarium
I am among friends, or am I misled?

Avatarium

I drink to you with a bleeding heart
I call for you when my heart is scarred
I need your love in the darkly hours
You are all, my avatars
