In skull forest shadows hang
Same old story, love is blind
Fools and beggars, kings and priests
A thousand corpses look like leaves

Come in pairs, share the wish
They go like one after cold last kiss
Dark-boned bodies from the trees
Have passed the door to the after-life meet

In skull forest light has fled
Oh, boneflower adorns the dead

From the branches lovers hang
One way trip to the promised land
Side by side and hand in hand
Nobody knows if dreams were found

In skull forest light has fled
Oh, boneflower adorns the dead

In skull forest the brave they hang
The ones that lost or the ones that won
To nurse the dream, to go or stay?
If you have a heart you go all the way
