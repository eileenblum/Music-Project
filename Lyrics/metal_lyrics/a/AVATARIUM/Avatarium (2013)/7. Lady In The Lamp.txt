In the darkly fade
She gives a serenade
Lifts the clouds away
Stars around her face

Her light, it fills the room
The wizard in his gloom
Enchanted... In her cage
She sings before the mage

It is late, but she's awake...
And the silver curtain fell
Her eyes, never cries...
In a tower full of spells

40 magic nights and 40 magic days
Without a word
The orchestra they play

She smiles and sings
In a state of trance
She knows her life will end
When the last chord dies

Lady in the lamp
Trapped inside a prison made of glass
Gives her little dance in
The Necromancer's hand
Lady in the lamp
