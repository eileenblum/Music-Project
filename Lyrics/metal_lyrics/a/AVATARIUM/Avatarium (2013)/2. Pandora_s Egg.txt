Listen to what mama said
Death they buried inside the egg
Long ago when time was young

Deep down under mountain old
Lies all sickness of the world
Never touch what should not
Be touched
Never go where you should not go
Never heal what should not be healed

Why does it rain all the time?
Doomsday omen...
And everything just starts to crack
Pandora's egg... is black!
In the dungeons... poison bleeds...
Frost and fire
Into the bloodstream of the
Human seed...

To crush empires
And you will set it free...
You will let it loose...

Egg of evil
Door to darkness
The gate is open
The seal is broken

The gods, they filled the egg so full
With wickedness, with cold and cruel
With everything that makes us cry
All our sins, they breed and grow
Like a never-ending stream they flow
Into our hearts, and slowly we die
Inside our hearts, slowly we die
In my heart... I die inside...
