The dark he will steal from the shadows
From the neck of the goddess the bling
In a blink will take your sweet pillow
And even the horse under the king

He will snatch the last breath from the dying
The light is ripped from the day
He swears on the truth but is lying
And when luck comes your way,
He will take it away

Robs from both poor and rich men
All this, withoug being seen
Sparrows and wine from the kitchen
And with a gentle hand,
The heart of the princess

The master thief - the great deceiver
He fakes and he steals - the mystery weaver
The master thief - the great deceiver
There's always a thief - the mystery weaver

He's picking the stars like apples
Climbs up the tower again
The thief will be prince and then emperor
But love he can't steal, and no one to call friend

The master thief - the great deceiver
He takes and bereaves - the mystery weaver
The master thief - the great deceiver
There's always a thief - the mystery weaver
