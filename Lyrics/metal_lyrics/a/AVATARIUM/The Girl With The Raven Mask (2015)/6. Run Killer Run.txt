You see the death of the day
In the shine from the lake
The night is waiting in fear
As Bob is awake
Cold as ice like a stone
A wizard at work
And no one will ever know
The gleam of your thoughts

All the fine things, all the gold
The silver linings, in all the world... No save

A small hint of a smile
Eye switching to black
He dresses up in style
The killer is back
You can't get the feeling of dread
Out of your head
Neon lights still twinkle after you're dead

All the fine things, all the gold
The silver linings, in all the world... No save

Fell from the sun
Walk the streets at night
You can't hide from your shadow
Run killer run

The man is old and so grey
In his penthouse abode
A killer on the loose
Wants his sad story told
In the sunset of life he's off the hook
Bob, it's time to pay for the lives that you took

All the fine things, all the gold
The silver linings, in all the world... No save

Fell from the sun
Walk the streets at night
You can't hide from your shadow
Run killer run

There's no escape
From the smoke of your gun
Run killer run

The camera is on
