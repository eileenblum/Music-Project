When the northern winds blow
Outside your frozen window
Ghosts of man and widow
Leave no footprints in snow

Bless the hold, count the hours
Ring of dead souls, sell no flowers
No sympathy for dog or mouse
9 white phantoms around your house

Ghostlight... Lock your door, frost is coming
Ghostlight... All is quite when death is howling
Ghostlight... Hidde inside, darkness growing
Ghostlight... Winter falls and the sky is glowing

Wolfs are near, snow will fall
Hear them scratching on your wall
When evil comes, will evil win?
Oh never let the darkness in

Ghostlight... Lock your door, frost is coming
Ghostlight... All is quite when death is howling
Ghostlight... Hide inside, darkness growing
Ghostlight... Winter falls and the sky is glowing
