I spy with my eye, a little girl going to the market
In her hand a yellow basket, on her head a giant mask yeah

Oh girl with the raven mask
Where do you have your home?
Oh girl with the raven mask
Do you live there all alone?
What can it be?
That you don't want us to see
Was this your idea?
Oh girl with the raven mask
Your secret's safe with me!

I see you walk the pavement, someone's child, a little witch
Do you live in a basement, or in the house upon that hill?

I saw you once before, all alone out on the moor
You were pointing to the clouds, you laughed and laughed, and danced for hours
A little happy girl, in a big black mask, against the world
Where are you coming from, where are you going, can I come?

Oh girl with the raven mask
What lies behind your disguise?
Oh girl with the raven mask
Who hides there inside?
Where have you been?
You look like a dream, what have you seen?
Oh girl with the bird mask
Are you the raven queen?
Who's under the paper sleeve?
What are you hiding from me?
