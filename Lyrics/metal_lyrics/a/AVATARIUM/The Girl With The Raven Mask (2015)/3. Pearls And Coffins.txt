Ooh, child of moon
Child of light
So you sold your soul
In the dead of night?
Headlong into mystery
Love , war and greed
In the grand bazaar,
In the garden of the queen
Oh, what a wonderful scheme

Oh you gave me pearls and coffins
In your usual soulless fashion
I was looking for heart and passion
But all you gave to me
Was pearls and coffins

Bridge across the valley
Arrows from the sun
You crossed me in the gully
In the mist of Avalon
Poison filled the air
The battle had begun
Machineguns blazing on,
But strange, there was no sound
Oh, and you left me for dead

Oh you gave me pearls and coffins
In your usual soulless fashion
I was looking for heart and passion
But all you gave to me
Was pearls and coffins
