There's no silence
To be found
From the voices you hold down
Twin the old times from your floor
Words come streaming back through your door

From the dark holes in frozen ground
Can you hear anguish sounds
Hide from hearing you don't feel
How nothing's true oh
When nothing's real
Oh nothing's real

In the deep well of the past see your memories shining
Like silver in the sun
If you reach beyond you'll find that the deepest sorrow
The deepest sorrow will be gone

Oh, oh, oh

See the guilt
See the shame
How every stone carries your name
Burn your bridges
Dredge your loss
And you let everyone carry your cross

In the deep well of the past see your memories shining
Like silver in the sun
If you reach beyond you'll find that the deepest sorrow
The deepest sorrow will be gone

Oh, oh, oh
