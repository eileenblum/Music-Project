All I want is to see you and slowly burn
To be there, in the arms of the sun
All I know... the last of the wars are won
All I know... our love is still warm

Moments of lies and sorrow,
There's tears and there's shame
A fire there in your eyes
The eternal flame

All I want is to sail around the moon
You and I on a ship of fools
And I see us standing there in the lava
Forever burn in the arms of the sun

Moments of lies and sorrow,
There's tears and there's shame
A fire there in your eyes
The eternal flame

All I want is to be in the seventh heaven
All I want is to be with you
All I want is to fly with the blackest rave
Forever burn in the arms of the sun

Moments of lies and sorrow,
There's tears and there's shame
A fire there in your eyes
The eternal flame
