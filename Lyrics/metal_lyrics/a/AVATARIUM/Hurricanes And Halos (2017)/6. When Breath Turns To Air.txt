[Music &amp; lyrics by Marcus Jidell &amp; Jennie-Ann Smith]

Take my coat
Take this old shoe
We leave as we came naked and true

And soon, so soon breath will turn to air
And then, then I'll be everywhere
Everywhere

Take my hand
Tell me no lies
Prepare your heart
Prepare your eyes

And feel, feel breath will turn to air
And you'll know, know that I am everywhere
Everywhere

Away way away I go
Can't stay don't wish it wasn't so
I can't stay
I can't stay
