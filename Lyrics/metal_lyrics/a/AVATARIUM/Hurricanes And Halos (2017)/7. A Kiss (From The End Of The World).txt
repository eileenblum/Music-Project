[Music &amp; lyrics by Leif Edling]

I thought I'd visit for a while
See Mr. Sun be born, then die
I came to rest and take long walks
Instead the whole wide world went dark

I spent a weekend at road's end
Away from pest, away from friends
Hot card from apocalyptic trip
Sealed with radioactive lips

I blew you a kiss, from the end of the world
And one day I'll return...
So I blew you a kiss from the end of the world
Oh, the stars they burn

At the inferno, acid rain
I'm sitting here with paper and pen
Now the sun is turning blue
See you Sunday, love you too
