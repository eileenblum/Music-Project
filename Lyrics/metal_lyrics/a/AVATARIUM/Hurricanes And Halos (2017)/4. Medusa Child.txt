I am the gorgon... Hair of snakes...
Gaze of crystal fire
I prowl the dungeons, born in a desert cave
My face's the cold white death

I am Desdemona...
Daughter of the three...
Half dragon child
I hide in a hole, the unwanted kind
And I'm as blind... As the world is to me

I just wanna be a child
But they say that I have evil eyes
My snakes will leave you petrified
Turned to stone in sand and salt
I just wanna dream and play
Dance in light of moon and tide
I hide inside the fabled night
'Cause I know I'm a monster child

Medusa...
