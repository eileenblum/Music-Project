See the sun
Rise again
Burn my eye, burning higher
Armed with truth
And feathered feet
I can feel the fire

Winding road
I kneel and pray:
Strong is she who walks alone
This time know
What no one knows
I will throw the first stone

I will go
Where no one's gone
Doubt is fear is my desire
Blood and tears
Dripping down through
Brimstone and hellfire

I am on my way
Jerusalem

Darkness do you lead my feet?
Shackles is ti really me?

Sea of flames rise again
Keep me safe on the road to Jerusalem

Oh so far and still so near
Darkness can you feel my fear?

Sea of flames rise again
Keep me safe on the road to Jerusalem
