From the volcano
Like a bat out of hell
The avenger will rise
From the heart of the flames

Drawn to the battle,
Drawn to the sun
Who's gonna die when the hero returns

Into the fire
Into the storm
Just one desire
Into the hurricane go

Never looked back,
Never to die
A griffin in flames across the sky
Wing-bearing mother 
The heathens will suffer
Lonely assassin,
Bringing the thunder

Into the fire
Into the storm
Just one desire
Into the hurricane go

Swords and circles,
Boots filled with blood
Nothing is sacred for the chosen one
A shooting star,
Crossing the stratosphere
Lonely assassin
You burn in the ash of your words

[2x]
Into the fire
Into the storm
Just one desire
Into the hurricane go
