Feel my burning touch
It drains you of all life
Your thoughts enter my brain
Your skin brittle and dry

Afflicted by my fire
Your eyes are dead and dull
I watch you fall to ash
I will absorb your soul

The withering death, my final gift
My talent from beyond
And as you crumble, you only hear
My poisonous funeral song

A heap, a husk, a pile of you
Is what I gaze upon
You were a breathing waste of life
Now all you are is gone
