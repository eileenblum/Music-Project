Out amongst the nothing, a retreat
The air is dead and stale, the mist it creeps
A filthy, stinking child in rags await
How where you to know she was the bait

You're gonna die!

You stop to help the wretched little thing
When more emerges with stick and rocks and painful offerings
You're beaten, whipped and forced to your demise
Your death is witnessed by a band of cruel and vicious eyes

Children of the filth
Born to rot, raised in ruin
Delighting in their kills

And they are not alone
Your loved ones come to find
When they go looking for you
And then they'll loose their minds
In a rancid cave where lies the grotesquerie bizarre
With live ones behind bars
Cocks and breasts and faces torn are strewn across the ground
While inbred naked freaks
Consume with animalistic chewing sounds

[Lead: Cutler]

One by one your "saviors" are consumed
Their brains defiled, their bones made into weapons foul and true
There's sick rejoicing for the twisted beasts
A severed head stares onward while excrements are released

Children of the filth
Born to rot, raised in ruin
Delighting in their kills
