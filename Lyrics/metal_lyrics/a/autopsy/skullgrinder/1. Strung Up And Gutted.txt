Saw you in the woods again
Sneaking like a rat
Sick pleasure on your mind
Got you in my trap
Hiding, creeping, think you're safe
Feel like you're superior
That's not the way I see it
I'll show you the meaning of fear

Strung up and gutted is what
You are going to be
A trophy on my wall for eternity

The chase, a prelude to the catch
I run you to the ground
A crudgel to the head
You're bleeding and you're bound
Consciousness returns, you're being dragged away
A plea forms on your lips, my boot kicks it away

Strung up and gutted is what
You are going to be
A trophy on my wall for eternity

From the blackness you emerge
In my cellar you're confined
Screaming, hanging upside down
Helpless, twisting, ropes entwined

[Lead: Cutler]

The knife punctures your abdomen
And cuts a trench down to your chin
Finally silent, mouth agape
Gut by gut, I eviscerate
The hunt did not go your way
You did not pass my test
Your head stares blankly down
On a plaque like all the rest

Strung up and gutted is what
You are going to be
A trophy on my wall for eternity
