Underneath the skin
Breeding takes place
Mindmelting reproductives
Insects in your face
Parasitic domination
Nervous system blown
Veinous vermin cannibalize
Brain cells sawn and strewn

Mirror showing maggots
Squirming from your nose
Stick your finger in your eye
Visceral infection grows
Black pus crust issuing
From your rotten ears
Arsenic-filled arteries
Brain damaged beyond fear
