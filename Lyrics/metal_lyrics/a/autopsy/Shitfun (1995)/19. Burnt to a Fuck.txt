Your burning face
A charcoal cinder
Lump of putrid sizzling flesh
Dripping features deforming fast
Scream 'til your mouth fuses shut
To barbeque I sentence you
As payment in my private way
Slow and cruel, I start to drool
For moments you'll regret this day

[chorus:]
I'll burn you bastard to a fuck
Transform your face to shapeless muck
Agony extreme blood runs
Lips become one with your tongue
Eyes almost burst from your head
Not soon enough you will be dead
Frothing bloodily from the mouth
I'll burn you bastard to a fuck

The sweet sweet smell of your burning hell
Inspires the fires that desecrate and melt
I torch your soul, I fuck your mind
You'll be a horror 'til the end of time

[repeat chorus]

[E.C.]

Burnt to a fuck

[repeat verse 3]
[repeat chorus]

[D.C.]

Burnt to a fuck
