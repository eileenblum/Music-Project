Long ago I watched the man bring the
Convulsing white fowl to his mouth, he
Chomped down hard on the neck, blood spurting
And dripping, the body dangled for a second
Then ripped from the head and hit the floor

I bit into the young neck, teeth sinking into
The warm flesh, blood running down my throat
And face, relishing the bits of skin stuck
Between my teeth, drinking all the blood my
Young friend had to offer

I ripped the throat out of the infant I stole,
Holding the thing over me and letting the sweet
Blood rain upon my face, lifeblood gushing from
The gaping hole - the one I created, momentarily
Quenching my thirst

I lacerated the juggular vein of the prom king
With my filed teeth and quickly pressed my lips
To the gaping wound, supping on the thick fluid
Spewing from the virgin throat

I am a modern day freak show
With a thirst for blood
I sup on the life of only the young
I tear and I drink
I kill and I feast
I follow tradition
I'm a bloodsucking geek

[E.C.]
