You're dead you fuck
You're dead at my feet
My revenge is almost complete
Your eyes staring
Staring into space
Seeing nothing, no heartbeat
Limp cadaver shut up forever
Life snuffed with no remorse
I will humiliate your corpse

You lay dead I laugh alive
My blood pumps, adrenaline rises
Can't help laughing as I look
At your corpse underfoot

Stepping on your chest
I yank down my pants
My butthole dialating
To humiliate your corpse

[D.C.]

You lay there limp contorted
I pinch a loaf for you
Your face is spattered with my shit
A pile of brown on blue

[E.C.]

You're dead you fuck
You're dead at my feet
My revenge is now complete
Your eyes staring
Staring into space
As my urine dribbles down your face

Life snuffed with no remorse
I've humiliated your corpse
