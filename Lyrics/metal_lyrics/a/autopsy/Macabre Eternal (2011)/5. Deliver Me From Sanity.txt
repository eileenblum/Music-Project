Haunted by reality
I cannot bear the pain
Called by unearthly screaming
Sickened by the sane

[Chorus:]
Deliver me from sanity
My eyes have seen to much
The very skin around my bones
Is horrid to the touch

A tortured specimen of filth
I grovel on the floor
Something's wrong inside my head
I'm not insane but I might be dead

[Lead - Cutler]

[Chorus]

I see reflections on the wall
But there's no mirror there
This place is dark and sick and cold
Why can't my mind be spared

I dig the eyes out of my skull
My mind is tearing at the seams
Self inflicted lunacy
At last fills all my waking dreams
