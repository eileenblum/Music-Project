Spill my blood
Our blood it comes from the same line... spill my blood
Still I should have seen all the signs... spill my blood
You're a double crossing cunt... spill my blood
I'll carve you, maim you, shape, shame you... spill my blood

You won the only battle
But still you lost the war
Now it's time you die
You fucking whore

Spill my blood... spill my blood
Not from my body, but from yours... spill my blood
I want to see and taste some more... spill my blood
Not from my body, but from yours... spill my blood

You won the only battle
But still you lost the war
Now it's time you die
You stupid whore

[Lead - Coralles]

Spill your blood

As you die I celebrate
A bloody mess of you I make
For you, now it's too late
I spill your blood for fuck's sake

Spill my blood
