Explosive violence
Explosive pain
Armageddon of flesh
Bludgeoned and brained
The beating, the beating
So savage and true
Pummeled skull splitting
With brains leaking through

Again and again
The blows are dealt
Watching the death twitch
Inhaling the smell
The glow of life
Fading from the eyes
A pathetic gasp
Replaces the cries

The game is not over
Your brains I will consume
Bone crushing satisfied
Feasting, covered in cerebral grume
