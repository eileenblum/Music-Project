Sunken eyes, deformed brain
Brilliant madman, beyond deranged
Hidden away, amongst the trees
Echoes of tormented pleas

Menacing thunder erupts in the skies
Innocent idiots soon face demise
Panicked and soaked to the tear stained bone
Enter the refuge where death dwells alone

[Lead - Cutler]

The sickening trap has been shut
You're drugged up and dragged down below
Strapped to last stand of sanity
It's time to be more than you were meant to be
Three you are in nightmare beds
Metamorphosis carefully planned
Your surgeon has sharpened his blades
You'll be changed by his wretched hand

Three screaming pitiful mouths
Dislocated and torn wide obscenely
Sewn in a segmented chain
Mouth to ass, ass to mouth, you're not dreaming
All linked up in unholy connection
Take the thing out for display
Humiliation of what has been wrought
As the sick one revels in his day

No escape, caged and whipped
Paraded for dark pleasure
Intestines pump, throats consume
Ingesting pure infected doom

The head, it dies...
The tail, it dies...
The brain, it fries...

[Lead - Coralles]
