I didn't find this place, it called to me
A reeking from the other side of stone
Underground in hiding as I was
Was that a whisper?  But I'm here alone...

There lay a hole in the ground
A hidden portal in the floor
A putrid breeze was seeping out
Against all sense I set out to explore

[Lead - Cutler]

Through the passage I did climb
Down to a chamber vast as hell itself
Had I lost my mind or did I really see
An abysmal chasm with a bridge of bones
Before me?

A nauseating reddish light filled the gloom
Transfixed I walked up to the bridge bizarre
Horrified I realized the truth
The skulls and legs and arms looked so familiar

In shock I scrambled back up
To the bleakness of the moor
The winds were foul, the bones were gone
I reeled in sickening horror
The abomination of a bridge
Must be the morbid key
I had to go down again and face insanity

[Lead - Coralles]

A dark descent beneath the earth
And hell was waiting there
I stepped onto the skeletal span
And walked across in terror
I reached the other side
To see a coffin standing bare
And then the voices faded in
Grotesque beyond compare

The box was open, death was near
I heard the casket's calling clear
My victims screaming in my head
I stepped inside and closed the lid
