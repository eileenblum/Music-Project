You're here with me to tell
What you've seen
You tremble and shake knowing
Your life's at stake
All around they know my name
I make a living inflicting pain
My ways are sound and once you're bound
I'll hurt my way to your center
Heroes die while cowards cry
Which one are you... will you end here...

Torture
You'll tell me what I want to hear
Or I'll cut you from ear to ear
With all my metal instruments
You'll question all your covenants

Asphyxiation, your face turns blue
Boiling oil burns the skin
Electrocution, fry away your skin
Genital mutilation, never fuck again
It's not too late to change your fate
So use your tongue before I puncture your lungs

Torture
You'll tell me what I want to hear
Or I'll cut you from ear to ear
With all my metal instruments
You'll question all your covenants
I have several surprises in store for you
But you have more control than you think I do

Just say the right words and all this stops
While you stall another piece of you drops

One by one, your fingers and toes
I've cut them all, your blood now flows
Your kneecaps crushed, you walk no more
Blackened eyes, you see no more
Broken arms, broken face
Your heart pumps in a mortal race
I do this not only for my occupation
But also for my sadistic gratification

Broken people always tell the truth...
Many argue but never see tomorrow...
It's never their saving grace...
I always rip off their face...
No remorse...
No apologies...
I'm not sorry...
I have no remorse for you...
Your death brings me pleasure...
Pleasure I can't describe...
A pleasure you will never...
You will never understand...
As you lie and you cry...
I sin...
I enjoy...
I enjoy your pain...
Your pain it brings me pleasure...
You'll never... you'll never see another....
Another breath...
Another day...
You'll never know tomorrow...
You're gonna die...
