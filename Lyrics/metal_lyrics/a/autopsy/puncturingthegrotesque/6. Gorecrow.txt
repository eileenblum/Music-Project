As the carnage continues, the dead slaughter the dead
Doomed to war eternally, just as they were fucked bred
Now as worms tunneling through the earth
Forgotten forever after atomic rebirth

And circling above
Mutant nightmares on wings
The last of their kind
Seeking dead offerings

Picking and scavenging
What's found is devoured
A feast in the fields
Corpse faces deflowered

Black feathered feeders
Distorted and foul
Talons dissecting
Melted meat on the ground

[Crowgasms: DC/EC/DC]

Cracking at bones
Eye sockets ravaged
A murder descending
To harvest and savage

Picking and scavenging
What's found is devoured
A feast in the fields
Corpse faces deflowered
