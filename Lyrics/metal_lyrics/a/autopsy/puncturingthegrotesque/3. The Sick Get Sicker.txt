The defect, the human, the lowest of lows
The madman, the psycho, obsessed with death blows
The might of the weapon, the rape of the sane
The torture more twisted, blood soaked and deranged

More corpses on the fire
While mangled minds conspire
Reason is in the past
Armageddon at last

De-evolution is running it's course
Cretinous mongrels line up for the wars
Tearing each other to teeth gnashing shreds
Boots stomp right over the mercifully dead

More corpses on the fire
While mangled minds conspire
Reason is in the past
Armageddon at last

Barbed wire brutality and face slashing atrocities divine
Stain the streets like a gag inducing putrid wine
Multiple fingers claw at multiple buttons that signal the end
The reaper's scythe is whetted again and again and again
It's too late to stop the final blasts
All are deaf, no one to hear the pathetic gasps
Of the ones who were too eager to slash and slay
The pyres of dead meat glow on this slaughter day

Destruction supreme is the law of the land
Bomb shelters in ruin, all dead at man's hand
Shrill air raid sirens wail onward like ghosts
The earth is now void of it's venomous hosts
