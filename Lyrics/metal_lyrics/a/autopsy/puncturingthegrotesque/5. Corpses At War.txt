The screams of demise are lost for all day
The hands of the humans have blown them away
Atomic fury unleashed with full force
The final conflict, the apex of all wars

The doom knell reverberates under the ground
Where the fallout sinks in form the nuclear clouds

Corpses are stirring below toxic soil
A twisted unlife with no blood left to boil
Skeletal parodies of what used to be
Awaken to fight and defy sanity

The doom knell reverberates under the ground
Where the fallout sinks in form the nuclear clouds

Splintered dead fingers reach outward to strangle
The clash of the ruined, the broken, the mangled
Clawing through caskets, the war carries on
The hatred so deep it can never be gone
