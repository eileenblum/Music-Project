The gears stopped turning years ago
The rats are skeletonized
Their bones merging with the dust of machinery long since failed
Shadows are the only moving things left

Pollution and death permeate the rancid air
Like the foul and final breaths from a doom infested lung
Poison laced clouds hover in defiance of oblivion itself
True sunlight banished beneath the toxic haze

[Lead: EC]

Dystopian lamentations drone
In the form of deformed tendrils of radiation
Gas mask eyes are dead and cracked
Staring blankly at crushed and rusted mechanization

This is where the living cease to be
A gray and dismal monument to futility

[Lead: DC]

The lust for death has finally been fulfilled
Manifest destiny in a crash course with the grave
No innocence, no guilt, no ground unscorched
Man was born to be erased
