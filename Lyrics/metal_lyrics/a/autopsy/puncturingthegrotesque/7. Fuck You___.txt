[originally by Bloodbath]Mother, father, sister, brother
I'm sick and tired of your shit
Every day I see your face and every day it makes me sick

What do you expect from me?
All I want is to be free
Fuck you, get off my back
Fuck you, shut your trap
Fuck you, just go away

Every day I'm being pushed
I am the bomb that needs to blow
I am the king snake in the grass you're gonna mow

What do you expect from me?
All I want is to be free
Fuck you, get off my back
Fuck you, shut your trap
Fuck you, just go away

What do you expect from me?
All I want is to be free
Fuck you, get off my back
Fuck you, shut your trap
Fuck you, just go away
Ten thousand miles away
Fuck you, get off my back
Fuck you, shut your trap
Fuck you, just go away!!!
