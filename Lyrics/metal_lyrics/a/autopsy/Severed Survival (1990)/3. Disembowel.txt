[Music and lyrics: C.R.]

Here I sit surrounded by white
My arms wrapped around my back real tight
What did I do that was so worng that I had to pay
I don't think anyones gonna miss her anyway

I just couldn't take anymore shit
So with a swing of my knife her stomach was split
Putrid bile and guts al over the floor
Couldn't help but laugh at this vision of gore

Severed flesh began to expel blood
The stench of defecation as I cut
Shoved my hand into the gaping slice
As you tried to emit gurgling cries
Intestines on the ground
Guts removed
Disebowel

Twitching....Violently
Dying....In agony
Blood....Comes flowing forth
Eyes....No longer see

[lead: D.C.]

Severed flesh began to expel blood
The stench of defecation as I cut
Shoved my hand into the gaping slice
As you tried to emit gurgling cries
Intestines on the ground
Guts removed
Disebowel
