The hate I have for you
I swore I never would unleash
But here you are in pieces
Lying at my sweaty feet
I masturbate with guilt
While looking at your distant eyes
I've had your torso seven times
Yet still my dick does rise

Lobing up your lifeless cunt
With blood from where your legs were
I slide in with ease
My soul you please
Finger your rectum
You're just as good in death as life
I don't know why I waited
Your head is gone
You cannot speak
Can't think of what I hated

You fucking whore!
Fuck you!

Now I tire of stretching out
Your dead and bleeding twat
Variety is what I crave
So with my knife I cut
Your ass and cunt are now as one
I join them with a slice
The blood and defecation
On my hard-on feels so nice
