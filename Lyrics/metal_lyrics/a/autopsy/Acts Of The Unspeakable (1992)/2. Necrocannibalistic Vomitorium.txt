Zombies raised up from the dead
To feed upon the living
Drinking blood and eating flesh

Maggots crawling in the skulls
Of those who were deceased
Gluttonously ripping flesh
With ancient rotten teeth
Mindless hunger
Gorging on the bloody human feast

Rotten bowels decayed and split
No escape for food
Regurgitation now begins
Zombies puke
Pools of rotten entrails
Flesh and blood spew on the ground
Only bones are left
Necrocannibalistic Vomitorium
