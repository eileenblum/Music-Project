Body bound by chains
Eyes on fire with fear
Try but you can't move
Heart about to burst

Hose rammed up your naked ass
Scream is muffled by the gas
The torment ahead is not your standard affair
I'm a twisted fuck and I just don't care

Soon you'll have a corrosive liquid
Racing through your bowels
Melting your insides

[Leads:D.C]
[E.C]

Down the funnel and through the hose
Into your bowels the acid goes

Bloody foam dribbles out of you
Muffled screams
You die in excruciating pain
