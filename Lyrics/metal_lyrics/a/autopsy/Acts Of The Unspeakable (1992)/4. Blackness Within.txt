Thriving on the hate that burns within my soul
Eyes rolled back with sheer disgust my heart is black
I have no home except the dark which is my mind
The downing of my life (Your Death) is cold

Swarming mass of shadows breeding uncontrolled
Existing to despise and dwell in the darkest depths
Building hatred loathing for the pitiful
Ominous the shroud of black it makes me whole

Blackest of the black
Darkest of the dark
