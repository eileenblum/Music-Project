You'll be slaughtered by the beast

Deep inside the shadows lies the cellar
Where the beast emerges
Filth of legend pale and foul
You'll satisfy it's hellish urges

You'll be slaughtered by the beast

Years long ago when the creature arrived
The slaughter was brutal, just one left alive
A new breed of victims moved into this hell
Murders of innocents quickly befell

Again there was one left alive like before
She soon was turned into the beast's willing whore
A slave to it's hideous mutated sex
She'd kill for this unholy cannibal wretch

Bearing it's voracious young
This nightmarish spawning begun
Tales of torture and screams
Bring unknowing blood offerings

See the midnight tour
Depicting scenes of carnage from the past
The myths are real, you're next to die
Your first visit will be your last

You'll be slaughtered by the beast
