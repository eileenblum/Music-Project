The ancient civilizations
In their temples filled with dread
Were linked together with their gods
By rivers flowing red
Prosperity and power
Gained from bodies without heads

In sacrifice the balance lies
The chosen stricken down
The gods' insatiable lust for death
Had limits never found
Harmony can only exist
With corpses on the ground

Humans squander greatness
The ways of wisdom gone
A cancerous shadow looming
I must bring back the dawn

Selected for this, I am
This world screams inside
The lambs await my coming
I see inside their minds

One by one the open minds
Are standing by my side
Taken from the hand of darkness
For sanity they've cried
Cast aside your past life
You have joined the enlightened pride

[Lead - DC]

The ancient blood will spill again
Our numbers only grow
Our temples raised, our hearts are pure
The power in us flows
I'll lead my people to the sun
The time has come to go
The vultures will feed and I will look down
On the mangled far below
