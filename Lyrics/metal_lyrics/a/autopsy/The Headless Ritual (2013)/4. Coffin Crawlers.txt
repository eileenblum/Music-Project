On the other side of the shattered mirror
My world is dark
From the corner of my blood red eye
Repulsive shadows breed
Grave mist swirls and black clouds harbor daggers
In this hallucinatory wasteland
I hear them crawl

[Chorus]
Spawned from the pits of a sickening world
Coffin crawlers, coffin crawlers
Breath of the stench of the blackest soil
Coffin crawlers, coffin crawlers
Worm like faces and filth encrusted hands
Headstone hiders, casket riders
Eyes like vomit stained clouded glass
Coffin crawlers, coffin crawlers

They open up wounds on the cast away dead
Leaning down with claws imbedded
Inhaling pure death from dessicated heads
Grotesquely twisted limbs
And wretched minds contort
Lifeless eyeballs are removed
With the dead unbeating heart

[Chorus]

They're crawling
Only I can see them
They want to eat my eyes
But I'll take them out myself
Their feast will be denied

[Lead - DC]
