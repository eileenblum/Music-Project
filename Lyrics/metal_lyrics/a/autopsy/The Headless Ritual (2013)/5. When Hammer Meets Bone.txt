Come into our house
Within the darkness we are here
Everyone who wanders in is sure to disappear
The door behind you shuts and locks
You smell the stench of death
That's when the hammer crashes down
And annihilates your head

Your ruined face
It leaves a trail of crimson on the floor
As your body's dragged into a room
With blood it is adorned
The freezer's full of butchered parts
Of others just like you
The rats can eat the scraps that drop
And then we'll eat them too

We've been here for many years
Inbreeding in the filth
Through ages upon ages
Of devouring our kills
A naked blood stained light bulb
Shows the mating on display
Gurgling sounds emit
From twisted worm like writhing shapes

Here we are in wait for you
Deformed and caked in gore
This hammer made of lead and concrete
Ever hungers more

When the hammer meets the bone
Your screams have gone unheard
When pools of blood are red and deep
Survival is absurd
There is no sanctuary
There is no mercy shown
Blunt force smashing is the law
Your skull and mind are blown
