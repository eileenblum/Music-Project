Time has taken your living flesh
Stolen your last gasping struggling breath

Lungs in upheaval, brain in a tomb
Becoming sand in a world of gloom

No teeth in it's skull, yet you're eaten away
Your epitaph clearer while tissues decay

[Chorus]
Your flesh, it turns to dust
The dice of bones are carved and cast
There's pain to bring and time to kill
There's cemetery holes to fill

[Leads - EC]

Despite your will, you can't command
The reaper's all ensnaring hand

[Chorus]
