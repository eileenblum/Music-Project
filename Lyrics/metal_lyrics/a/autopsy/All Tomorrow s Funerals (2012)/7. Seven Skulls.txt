[Music: Cutler, Lyrics: Reifert]

I've got seven skulls
One is staring back at me
Atop the rotting stairs
Is where my family waits for me

At night I go to see them
(No, I am not insane...)
Unlock the door forbidden
That only knows my name
This room is filled with knowledge
Of nightmares, dreams and fears
They all flow through my mind
The real world disappears

I've got seven skulls
seven boxes in a row
Seven spirits free
I'll join them soon, they call to me

One night they made me do it
I woke at four A.M.
I felt their desperate pleading
Their prisons tortured them
They wanted to be free
They said I was the one
My brain was filled with voices
As I picked up my gun
