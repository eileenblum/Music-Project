Squeal you worthless piece of fuck
Before i make you die
Maybe you will shit your pants
On your suffering i thrive

The thrill of the kill is a natural thing
But what makes me live is the fear i can bring

On your knees in a pool of piss
Pleading for your life
Tantalize my reeling senses
With your pathetic cries

Wimpering and begging like a dog
My ways are cruel
My cock is hard anticipating what's to come
You're trembling with fear
How fucking sad
You're just another piece of shit

I can't take your moaning anymore
Pressure building up inside
After i deliver the crushing blow
I climax in your eye
