[Music: Cutler, Lyrics: Reifert]

My corpse shall rise!

In the cemetery now you have arrived
To finally see my flesh from which you stole the life
Though you never were discovered, you're still free
I've got a curse on you, I've haunted all your dreams

You can't believe I'm gone
You must be sure, it must be real
Panic stricken, to the grave
The truth must be revealed

[Lead - Coralles]

With shaking hands and sickening thoughts
You find my resting place
With pounding heart and bloodshot eyes
The shovel desecrates
The time has come to face reality
And visit death
To see my corpse and stop the dreams
To see it knows no breath

[Lead - Cutler]

At your feet, uncovered is the box
You're almost paralysed with fear
Feel the bile creep up your throat
Lift the lid and know I'm here

I lie here rotting, maggots burrowing, feeding, swarming
You can't hold back the nausea
Help won't find you
Stomach twisting, violent retching, defiled by vomit
Now my vengeful corpse begins to rise
I've been waiting here for you
Now it's time to see you die
