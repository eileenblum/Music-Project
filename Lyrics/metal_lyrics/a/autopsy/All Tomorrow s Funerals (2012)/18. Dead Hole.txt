I have been there again
My bare feet caked with mud
Stench of the grave rising from my aching groin

I have been to her again
I have been in her again!!!!
I have experienced the foul pleasure
Brought onto me
I hate myself for it
But still i return

Once more i visit my place of lust
She is there
Just as i left her the time before
As i tear off my restricted clothes
In the dim light of the graveyard
My passion runs its course
"the ecstasy you bring is unsurpassed
Forever be my whore"
