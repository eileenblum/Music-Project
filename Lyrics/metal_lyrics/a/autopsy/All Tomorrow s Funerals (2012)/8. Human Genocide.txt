[Music: Cutler/Reifert, Lyrics: Reifert]

All human life is engulfed in dead flesh
Mindless corpses with worms in their head
Up from the grave the nightmare has begun
A woman screams as the dead eat her son

[Chorus:]
Doomsday is here, the dead walk among us
The people are dying to rise up again
The crypts breathe new life
As the inhabitants emerge
Creating a hell beyond comprehension
Ripping and shredding the flesh of the living
Corpses are walking to prey on the live blood
Decapitation of women and children
Flesh eating zombies devour their guts

Feasting on flesh and bathing in blood
Where there was life, now there is none
Maggots burrowing deep inside
The dead take over, human genocide

[Chorus]

[Lead - Cutler]
