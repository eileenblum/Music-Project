[Music and Lyrics: Reifert]

Desert screams on plains of doom
Your mind will snap beyond the dunes
A village ahead, the stench of disease
Nauseating wasteland, distorted dead trees

[Chorus:]
One eyed vultures feeding
On twisted malformed prey
Are these hallucinations
In this place of foul decay

An image in shadows, radiation diseased
A figure of sickness... No eyes, nose or teeth
You see it comes forward, you freeze up with fear
The horror's upon you as others appear

[Chorus]

An array of the nuclear deformed
Cursed with plague, with wounds they are adorned

A vision of hell, their food you will become
Cannibals beneath a sickened sun
Mental lapse, this nightmare can't be real
Sanity cracked, your brain will not be healed

[Lead - Coralles / Lead - Cutler]

Your dried up scream makes not a sound
their hunger is upon you now
Horrific limbs and faces twist
Your throat is slashed, cease to exist
