Lost and abandoned in a tropical hell
With a ship dead beneath the sea
A group of survivors faces their doom
On this island they'll all know insanity

Unseen eyes from the trees beyond
Taking in the wretched and weak
Weapons razor sharp and poison encrusted
Incisors prepared for the feast

Human traps above and below
There is no safety to be found
The fires will burn bright for the cannibals this night
And the blood will run thick on the feeding ground

All are now captives
Slick with blood and tears
The full moon shows their captors
Leering with rocks and spears

The breeders are selected
Their lives are spared for now
Cruel genitals poised
The air is shattered with primal howls

Ritual lust and sick fornication
This place is alive with screams
Seeds are planted and skin is clawed
If only this were a dream
Bodies are hacked and spitted alive
Slowly turning over the flames
Impregnated slaves are force fed flesh
'Til only the Bones Remain
