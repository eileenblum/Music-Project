Lying here in filth and ruin
Watching the spiders weave
Death tones blare behind my eyes
There's less than ever to believe

I've made a trench across each wrist
While roaches skitter madly
Echoes of too many days of life
Grow more silent gradually

[Chorus:]
Bleeding, seeing, pouring death
A red eternal dream
I conjure paths beyond the veil
It's my blood summoning

Staring at a shattered picture
Despair in every crack
Senses fleeting, heart bursts beating
Drowning in a haze of black

[Chorus]

Puncture wounds, self made cocoons
It's too late to return
I plead to darkness, set me free
There's truth in death, I'm ready to learn
