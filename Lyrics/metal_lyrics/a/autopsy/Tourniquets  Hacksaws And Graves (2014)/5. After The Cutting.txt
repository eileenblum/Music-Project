Steel, Crimson stained
Blood has been drained
pain is no more
dead is your brain

Twist of the knife
Cut short your life
dread fills my eyes

Rejoice in the Cutting
Rejoice in the cutting, and ripping and flaying
and shredding and tearing and rending and slaying
and screaming and bleeding and slashing and crying
and slicing and pleading and gashing and dying

Reap of veins sprayed on the wall
Horrific wounds, the graveyard calls
Red stalactites slowly drip
From head to toe your skin's been stripped

[chorus:]
Mortal wounds blooming wet
The work of the thirsty blade
After the cutting my eyes see death
Layers of meat peeled away

I didn't mean to cut so much
My knife it told me what to do
The darkness came and took my mind
Now all I see are clotting pools

[chorus]

[lead-cutler]
[lead-coralles]
