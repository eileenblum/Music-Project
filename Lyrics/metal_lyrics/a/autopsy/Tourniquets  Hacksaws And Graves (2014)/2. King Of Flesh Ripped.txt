Bleeding from my face from
Where I pulled it apart
Sliced off an ear drinking gasoline to start
Smash my fingers, gouge out an eye
To death I fucking defy
I can take the most and still i walk away
In this contest of gore today is not your day
Your mere contribution surely falls short
After this you'll wish your mother chose to abort

[chorus]:
King of flesh ripped, away your life slips
I'm the king of flesh ripped,
The tightening of death's grip

[lead - Coralles]

Take a knife and slash your face
This room will show you no grace
Hooks through your skin,
Hang you on the wall
When this ends you won't be able to crawl

[lead - Cutler]

[chorus]

Can you take a hammer to your knees?
Forget about giving up, silence your pleas
Nailgun to your hand, are you dead?
Cut off your damn arm, now I'm fed

[lead - Cutler]
