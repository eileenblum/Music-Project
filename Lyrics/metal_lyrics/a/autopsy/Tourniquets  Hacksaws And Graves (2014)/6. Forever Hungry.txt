Rotten chunks of meat littered the ground
Gnashing of teeth and slurping sounds
Limbs are missing and torsos crawl
Humanity has begun the final fall
They stop to look at the sky as if an answer will come
Without cause they continue on, as a beating drum

[chorus:]
Relentless and forever hungry without eyes to see
Dragging guts behind them as they walk and feed
Forever Hungry, never satisfied
Forever hungry, 'til all have died

Ripping and tearing of flesh and bones
The doomed sounds of screams and groans
Succulent meat is eaten raw
Face is gashed, missing the jaw
Entrails pulled for all to share
Torn apart through death's stare

[chorus]

[lead-Cutler]

The living are dead, the dead are living
To satisfy the craving they are giving
One by one all will fall
This is the answer to the blood call

[lead-Coralles]

Forever Hungry
