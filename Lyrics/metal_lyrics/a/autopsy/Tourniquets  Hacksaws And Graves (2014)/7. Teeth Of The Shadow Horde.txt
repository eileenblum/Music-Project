The sun has turned black the shadows have come
Pulverized bones and skulls will be one
The shadows are free, Releasing the plague
All of the venom and volatile hate

[chorus:]
Tendrils of darkness
Seeking out souls
Black fangs sinking deep
Eyes like black holes

Dagger filled shadows are cleaving red flesh
Dark paranoia poisons the rest
Minds stripped and raped, flesh strewn in heaps
All thoughts betraying, man's dark side unleashed

[chorus]

Snuffing out light, snuffing out life
Dark tentacles strangling, cranial mangling

[lead-Coralles]

Humanity Mirrored in Horror and death
Invoking pure madness and stealing all breath
The wake of the slaughter leaves mountains of limbs
and traces of shadows where all death begins

[chorus]

[lead-Cutler]
