Pudtule encrusted, seeping hate
One day it appeared, wretched and glazed

Horrorific orb, lidless and foul
staring back, parasitic
Twisted and wide, leaking disease
visual filth, parasitic eye

I cut it out, the wound was deep
three more emerged, an eye covered freak

Horrorific orb, lidless and foul
staring back, parasitic
Twisted and wide, leaking disease
visual filth, parasitic eye

Horrorific orb, lidless and foul
staring back, parasitic
Twisted and wide, leaking disease
visual filth, parasitic eye

The mirror smashes along with my mind
pick up the shards, stab them all blind
