Place of pain and death, beyond insanity
Out of human sight, beyond the mountain's teeth
Tourniquets
Pieces on the floor, unrepentant gore
Another backyard burial, another ticket back to hell
Hacksaws
No one else comes here, just victims that i bring
Chloroformed and bound, another bloody offering
Graves
Tourniquets, Hacksaws and Graves
The outside world is gone, this room is all you'll know
From now until the end, terror stabs you to the bone
Tourniquets
The tourniquet's administered, it's only just begun
There's plenty of limbs to remove, I'll savor every one
Hacksaws
Squeezing off the veins, cutting off the pain
Drawing out the torture, saw and cut again
Graves
Tourniquets, Hacksaws and Graves
Drinking deep your blood, I'm flying high
Bathing in it as I look you in the eye
Your heart is bursting in your open chest
You'll soon be buried by my hand with all the rest
