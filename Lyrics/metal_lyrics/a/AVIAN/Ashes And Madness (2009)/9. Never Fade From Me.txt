Trembling with fear, I stood over him
His lie filled life was just about to end
Drowning in sweat, he plead his case
I knelt down beside him, and whispered in his ear...

A crash came from the broken vein; I watched her slip away
Screaming pain rang out again; my turn to taste the blade
For all the days that will remain; the memory will never fade...
Will Never Fade From Me

Pretending to be a friend, his smile can't hide the lies
Diluting the wrong and right, as the hours passed by
The rage built from deep within,
Just one shot would do him in
I knelt beside him, and watched him disappear

A crash came from the broken vein; I watched her slip away
Screaming pain rang out again; my turn to taste the blade
For all the days that will remain; the memory will never fade...
Will Never Fade From Me

Days of sorrow fill my each and every tomorrow
Reality it seems no longer cares about me
Haunting words reflecting in the mirror
Remind me of her year after year after year

A crash came from the broken vein; I watched her slip away
Screaming pain rang out again; my turn to taste the blade
For all the days that will remain; the memory will never fade...
Will Never Fade From Me

Deep in my mind I see her final destiny
Never forget her face, she's not to blame;
It's all on me
