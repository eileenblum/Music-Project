Now the time has come at last to recover the past
To dream and live in this glorious land
When the phantoms call, we will all stand tall
Never to fall; We will remember

The time and place beyond all space where we lost our innocence
Shattered dreams can't be replaced they're locked inside our memories
The lion's den will open again unless we seal its identity
Time and Space within our hands will Unlock The Mystery

Voices from the great beyond tell us to carry on
To rise and fight and never give in
As the dawn approaches, from far beyond comes a shining light
We know it's now or never

The time and place beyond all space where we lost our innocence
Shattered dreams can't be replaced they're locked inside our memories
The lion's den will open again unless we seal its identity
Time and Space within our hands will Unlock The Mystery

Take my hand; into the Promised Land I will lead you
Time and space will disappear; I promise you

Step out of the darkened land into the cleansing rain
Into the rays of light shining bright
Clouds will part away into a brand new day
That is here to stay and is filled with hope and promise

The time and place beyond all space where we lost our innocence
Shattered dreams can't be replaced they're locked inside our memories
The lion's den will open again unless we seal its identity
Time and Space within our hands will Unlock The Mystery

From the ashes comes the madness of man
Consumed by selfishness and greed
Chaos will reign upon this earth
For generations upon generations
Until the day that peace will be restored...forever!
