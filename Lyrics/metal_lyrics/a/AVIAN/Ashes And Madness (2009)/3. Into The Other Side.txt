There in the distance, I hear a faint whispering
A fallen angel calling out to me
"Fall away into these arms; they'll bring you no harm"
Softly echoed in the breeze

Look deep in my eyes
Can you see the truth inside
face your darkest fears
It's time to wake up from this dream

Long from wrong or right
Fear will soon subside
The dream world leave behind
Cross Into The Other side

The tingling fills my soul, blue moon glistening
Icy landscape fades like words in the distance
"Fall away into these arms; they'll bring you no harm"
Softly echoing in the breeze

Finally I find the madness washing over me
I waste the freedom and throw away what's left of me
I feel the darkness waste away the fabric of my being
Eternal damnation awaits my spirit; need my sanity

Long from wrong or right
Fear will soon subside
The dream world leave behind
Cross Into The Other side
Long from wrong or right
Fear will soon subside
The dream world leave behind
Cross Into The Other side

There in the distance, I hear a faint whispering
A fallen angel calling out to me
"Fall away into these arms; they'll bring you no harm"
Softly echoed in the breeze

Look deep in my eyes
Can you see the truth inside
face your darkest fears
It's time to wake up from this dream

Long from wrong or right
Fear will soon subside
The dream world leave behind
Cross Into The Other side
Long from wrong or right
Fear will soon subside
The dream world leave behind
