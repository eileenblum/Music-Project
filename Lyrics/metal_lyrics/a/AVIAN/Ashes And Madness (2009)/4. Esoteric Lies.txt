Man kills his brother
Stained sands of crimson flow
Dying for their faith
A dim and sightless clan
They cannot see beyond the veil
of a senseless man

All for one and one for all
The nature of their leaders' call
Twisting lies to make them real
Fighting for their ideals

No more lies
The world is blind to their vengeful eyes
Well disguised
It's hard to find the truth in trying times
The more we try to find the answers buried inside
They beguile the truth with Esoteric Lies

People not of a single mind
Countries broken, divided is what you'll find
You kill in the name of your father

All for one and one for all
The nature of their leaders' call
Twisting lies to make them real
Fighting for their ideals

No more lies
The world is blind to their vengeful eyes
Well disguised
It's hard to find the truth in trying times
The more we try to find the answers buried inside
They beguile the truth with Esoteric Lies

Another hope another fear
Connecting throughout the years

All for one and one for all
The nature of their leaders' call
Twisting lies to make them real
Fighting for their ideals

No more lies
The world is blind to their vengeful eyes
Well disguised
It's hard to find the truth in trying times
The more we try to find the answers buried inside
They beguile the truth with Esoteric lies
