One by one we share the flame,
Blazing high through the land
Sorrow's calling out our names,
Shackled spirits die in vain

Take my hand and follow me,
Together we'll find our destiny
Our world is on the brink of
Having all life extinct
Stop the madness now!
The land of faith will drown!
Tomorrow's fate is almost gone

One by one we share the flame,
Blazing high through the land
Sorrow calling our names,
Shackled spirits die in vain

All the King's Horses and all his men
Fight to save the world from the rain
Fallen heroes live in our hearts
Their selfless deeds have set them apart
All the King's Horses and all his men
Together they will rise again
Demons try to rule our minds
We stand as one; we will never die

We show our children what's in store
If we don't find a way that's pure
Howling winds and fiery skies
Destined to be what's left behind
Stop this madness now!
The land of faith will drown!
Tomorrow's fate is almost gone

One by one we share the flame,
Blazing high through the land
Sorrow calling our names,
Shackled spirits die in vain

All the King's Horses and all his men
Fight to save the world from the rain
Fallen heroes live in our hearts
Their selfless deeds have set them apart
All the King's Horses and all his men
Together they will rise again
Demons try to rule our minds
We stand as one; we will never...

One by one we share the flame,
Blazing high through the land
Sorrow calling our names,
Shackled spirits die in vain.
All the King's Horses; die in vain...
