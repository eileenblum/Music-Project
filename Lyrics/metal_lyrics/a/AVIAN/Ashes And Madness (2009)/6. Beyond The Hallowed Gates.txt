Time falls through the past
Gone for certain
Dreams are never meant to last
They're pure illusion

Chance encounter on a winter's night
Steals your soul
and destroys your mind
Final hopes and fantasies
Take away your reality

The chance you take
Will tempt your darkest fate
Fall From Grace
Beyond The Hallowed Gates

Memories grip your fragile mind
Haunt and torment you
Try to reach out for the light
It will redeem you

Chance encounter on a winter's night
Steals your soul from deep inside
Final hopes and fantasies
Take away your reality

All the dreams you've left behind
Are buried in the darkness of your mind
Hopes and fears aren't well disguised
They leave a trace to be found
The chance you take will tempt your darkest fate
Fall From Grace
Beyond The Hallowed...

Gates of freedom lay ahead
The road before you
is filled with hate
Wisdom and sorrow
Go hand in hand;
It's up to you to control your fate

Chance encounter on a winter's night
Leaves you whole and refined
Final hopes and fantasies
Fulfil your ultimate reality

All the dreams you've left behind
Are buried in the darkness of your mind
Hopes and fears aren't well disguised
They leave a trace to be found
The chance you take will tempt your darkest fate
