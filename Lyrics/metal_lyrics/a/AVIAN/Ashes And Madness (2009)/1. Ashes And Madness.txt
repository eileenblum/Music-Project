From the ashes comes the madness of man
Consumed by selfishness and greed
Chaos will reign upon this Earth
For generations upon generations
Until the day that peace will be restored...
forever!

Someone out in the night
Calls out to the dark
Voices come alive
Rising up from the underworld

Shadows fade from sight
Slipping into the dark dimensions
Lightning flashes bright
Thunder rolls across the wasteland

Fate's disguise has left you blind
The truth is in your mind's eye

Ashes fill the night flowing from behind
Dark reality becomes askew
Flashes in the sky reflecting in your mind
Madness deep inside of you

Turn to look but no one's there
Precious seconds waste away
Life and death slowly turn
Into a dance of deadly decay

Dreams and lies have ruled your life
You raise your hands up to a new sky
Fate's disguise has left you blind
You seek the truth within your mind's eye

Ashes fill the night flowing from behind
Dark reality becomes askew
Flashes in the sky reflecting in your mind
Madness deep inside of you

Somewhere out of sight
Beyond the doors of the dark
Whispers fill the night
Calling out from afar

Phantoms appear tonight
Back from another dimension
Lightning tears the sky
Thunder explodes throughout the wasteland

Dreams and lies have ruled your life
You raise your hands up to a new sky
Fate's disguise has left you blind
You seek the truth within your mind's eye

Ashes fill the night flowing from behind
Dark reality becomes askew
Flashes in the sky reflecting in your mind
Madness deep inside of you
