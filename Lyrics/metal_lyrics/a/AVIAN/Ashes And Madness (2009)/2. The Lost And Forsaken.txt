Fighting the hunger they search for the power
The crash of the thunder shakes the ground down under
Their fragile spirits, uplifting from their songs
Singing to their Gods, what could have gone wrong?

One last tripp across the wastelands
Bleeds their souls into iron hands
Faith and dreams vanish in the night
Blood and tears flow out of sight

The lost and forsaken have been taken

Angels and demons battle for their spirits
A flash of the lightning sends chills and they fear it
The dying embers filling the night sky
The end is nearing, pick up your sword and fight

One last tripp across the wastelands
Bleeds their souls into iron hands
Faith and dreams vanish in the night
Blood and tears flow out of sight

Dreams are not illusions, just another wall
Break the chains around you and you'll stand tall

The Lost and Forsaken have been taken
Alone in the Darkness, their faith has vanished

One last trip across the wastelands
Bleeds their souls into iron hands
Faith and dreams vanish in the night
Blood and tears flow out of sight

Dreams are not illusions, just another wall
Break the chains around you and you'll stand tall

The Lost and Forsaken have been taken
Alone in the Darkness, their faith has vanished
The Lost and Forsaken have been taken
Alone in the Darkness, their pain has vanished
