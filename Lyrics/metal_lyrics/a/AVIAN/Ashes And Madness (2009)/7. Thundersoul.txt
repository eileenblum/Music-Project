Calling out to the voices of your life
Will he find what he's looking for
Emptiness consumes his mind
He's trying to break through the door

A freezing hand from out of nowhere
Reaches out and pulls you through the broken window
A silent cry escapes from inside
It would be wise to heed this distant warning

Run and hide just like a lost and frightened child
A freezing hand from out of nowhere
Reaching out and pulling you into never

Slipping, turning, falling into the underworld
Screaming, burning, calling out to Thundersoul

Why do you fear the coming night
Will you wake to find you're lost inside
The maze that leads you to nowhere
Like a rat that's destined to stay there

Slipping, turning, falling into the underworld
Screaming, burning, calling out to Thundersoul
Twisting, yearning, fading from this cruel world
Screaming, burning, crying out to Thundersoul

Live and learn or die and burn
Face your fears and you'll be reborn
Loneliness destroys your will for life
Rise above and stand in the light

A freezing hand from out of nowhere
Reaches out and pulls you
Through the broken window
A silent cry escapes from inside
It would be wise to heed this distant warning

Run and hide just like a lost and frightened child
A freezing hand from out of nowhere
Reaching out and pulling you into the never

Slipping, turning, falling into the underworld
Screaming, burning, calling out to Thundersoul
Twisting, yearning, fading from this cruel world
Screaming, burning, crying out to Thundersoul
