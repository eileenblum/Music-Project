Time slips away, through winter nights and days
Someday someway, we'll regain all left behind
The past is gone, moved on without a chance now
We carry on, take life's great majesty

All of our memories slowly fade away
Into infinity
Voices cry out begging us to stay
Shadows dancing

Time is all we need to get us through The Fear
Lives and destiny falling through eternity
Days turn into weeks, disappearing into years
Time is all we need to wash away our sins

Children will play in gardens of the Promised Land
Until that day, their dreams of fate will never die
Their light shines on, into the darkness of night
Where we come from, the stars shine as one

All of our memories slowly fade away
Into infinity
Voices cry out begging us to stay
Shadows dancing

Time is all we need to get us through The Fear
Lives and destiny falling through eternity
Days turn into weeks, disappearing into years
Time is all we need to wash away our sins
