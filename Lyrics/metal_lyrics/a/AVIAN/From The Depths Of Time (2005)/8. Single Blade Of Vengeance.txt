They live and die within the gates of time
They run and hide in the distant skies
Horrid crimes against mankind
Destroying the Will of Life

The knife shines bright, stand up and fight
The light blinds your eyes; your mind can't survive

Shadows in the dark
The fear playing its part

In the night, stay in sight, wrong or right
Fight until the death
In the night, through the light, do or die,
With a Single Blade of Vengeance

To tempt your fate is to leave the past behind
The chance you take will bleed the savage heart
Guardlans of Time have you well in sight

The knife shines bright, stand up and fight
The light blinds your eyes; your mind can't survive

Shadows in the dark
The Fear playing its part

In the night, stay in sight, wrong or right
Fight until the death
In the night, through the light, do or die,
With a Single Blade of Vengeance
Don't deny the fear inside, hold on tight
Hold your last breath
Stay alive with all your might; tonight's the night
For a Single Blade of Vengeance

In the night, stay in sight, wrong or right
Fight until the death
In the night, through the light, do or die,
With a Single Blade of Vengeance
Don't deny the fear inside, hold on tight
Hold your last breath
Stay alive with all your might; tonight's the night
For a Single Blade of Vengeance
