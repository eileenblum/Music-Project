Somewhere in the grand universe
Reside the ones that control it all
Across the millions they ate the first
To witness what becomes of our world
Light years away but somehow near
Preying on mankind's darkest fears

From The Depths of Time they're rising
Fearing none they march ahead
Through the past and into forever
They're the ones approaching with the storm

The shattered state of man's blind desire
Has ripped to shreds the grand design
Nightmares of the dying spirits
Tear through the tides of time
Fire winds blaze across our eyes
As the mighty empire falls in demise

From The Depths of Time they're rising
Fearing none they march ahead
Through the past and into forever
They're the ones approaching with the storm

Way out in the dark far beyond, in the distance
Hiding from the light, deep in the shadows of night
Waiting for the spark, from beyond, in the remoteness
They stay out of sight, making sure all is right
Where are they now; they're out there waiting
Where are they now; beyond the light
Where are they now; they're out there watching
Where are they now; the guardians of time

Stand as one we're all united
Here in the valley of time
Emerald warriors you're the chosen
Now the judgement has begun

The lion's gate at last is wide open
The hands of fate are now open wide

From The Depths of Time they're rising
Fearing none they march ahead
Through the past and into forever
They're the ones approaching with the storm

Way out in the dark far beyond, in the distance
Hiding from the light, deep in the shadows of night
Waiting for the spark, from beyond, in the remoteness
They stay out of sight, making sure all is right
Where are they now; they're out there waiting
Where are they now; beyond the light
Where are they now; they're out there watching
Where are they now; the guardians of time

From The Depths of Time they're rising
Fearing none they march ahead
Through the past and into forever
They're the ones approaching with the storm

Way out in the dark far beyond, in the distance
Hiding from the light, deep in the shadows of night
Waiting for the spark, from beyond, in the remoteness
They stay out of sight, making sure all is right
Where are they now; they're out there waiting
Where are they now; beyond the light
Where are they now; they're out there watching
Where are they now; the guardians of time
