Seven strangers gathered in the forest
Speaking without saying a single word
Holding hands, they stood in a circle
Staring at each other's frozen eyes

The visions came as the wind stirred
The end of time is almost burnt

The Fear's rising from within
They can feel it closing in
From the fire through the flame
The Fear is calling their names

Frozen in silence the seven stood strong
Growing stronger with every moment
All are now surrounded by the blazing flames
As the heat from below arises

Nothing can stop this deadly meeting
The Moon's glow reflecting;
Their hearts stopped beating
The end of time; the clock's hands stand still

The Fear's rising from within
They can feel it closing in
From the fire through the flames
The Fear is calling their names

The ground trembles as he awakes
The trees' fury won't stop the quake
A child's cry tears through the night
A telling sign of things to come

The Fear's rising from within
They can feel it closing in
From the fire through the flame
The Fear is calling their names

Seven strangers gathered in the forest
Speaking without saying a single word
