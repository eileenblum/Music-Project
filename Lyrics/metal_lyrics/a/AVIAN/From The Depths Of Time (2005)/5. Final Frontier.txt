Time everlasting is holding us down
Turning everything into a cloud
Never allows us to rise up
Leaving our spirits on the ground

The will of man must make a stand
Tomorrow's children are held by fate
Darkness has dealt us a wicked hand

Now is the time to open the door
And find inside what we're looking for
To reach with our hands and take what is ours
To find the truth and see what's beyond

Why are we here, who will we be
Struggling to see the Final Frontier
Where do we go, who will we know
Dying to see the Final Frontier

We lead ourselves to the gallows
Blindly stepping out of the light
Will we remain in the shadows
Or rise high and take to the sky

Now is the time to open the door
And find inside what we're looking for
To reach with our hands and take what is ours
To find the truth and see what's beyond

Why are we here, who will we be
Struggling to see the Final Frontier
Where do we go, who will we know
Dying to see the Final Frontier

One final chance within our grasp
Redeems the past, secures the future
Within the gates of time, the die is cast

Now is the time to open the door
And find inside what we're looking for
To reach with our hands and take what is ours
To find the truth and see what's beyond

Why are we here, who will we be
Struggling to see the Final Frontier
Where do we go, who will we know
Dying to see the Final Frontier
