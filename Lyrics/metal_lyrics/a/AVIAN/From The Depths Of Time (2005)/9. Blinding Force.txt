Tide is shifting, bells are ringing
As the Sun begins to drown
Men are sinking, nations thinking
Walls are crumbling and now are falling down

Hear the sound growing from down under
Tonight their cries explode from the thunder

Can't see the light on this final night
Words they say will fade away

Searching high, searching low
From above to down below
Rising up through the storm
Ride the sky with Blinding Force
Live and die and never know
What it's like to feel the glow
Time goes by, but still we go
Ride the sky with Blinding Force

Children grieving, thoughts deceiving
And the angels start to cry
Morals broken, fate has spoken
Who is looking through the glass eye

Feel the ground shake from the thunder
The beast awakens to feed the hunger
Can't see the light on this final night
Words they say will fade away

Searching high, searching low
From above to down below
Rising up through the storm
Ride the sky with Blinding Force
Live and die and never know
What it's like to feel the glow
Time goes by, but still we go
Ride the sky with Blinding Force

Earth is quaking, hearts are breaking
As the demons start to rise
Mothers grieving, children screaming
No escaping our demise
Still believing, hope is fleeting
As we look for answers ih the skies

The fear arises in those who wonder
Voices echo across the tundra
Can't see the light on this final night
Words they say will fade away

Searching high, searching low
From above to down below
Rising up through the storm
Ride the sky with Blinding Force
Live and die and never know
What it's like to feel the glow
Time goes by, but still we go
Ride the sky with Blinding Force
