The time has come to save our ruined land
Taking it for granted has led to this doom
Power and glory has played its wicked hand
Little hope we'll survive the catastrophic goom

Days and weeks and months and years
Roll until they slowly disappear
Every man woman and child will see
The death of the home of humanity

The road to hell lies dead ahead
It's too late now; we've been misled
The storm approaches from the west now

As we sail across the sea of time
We carry on; we don't look back
Still we march ahead, As The World Burns

Prophets and seers have warned for many years
Mankind will fall down to its knees
When the line is crossed it will be too late
To return to Eden and revel in its state

Clouds roll in from a distance
A sign of the darkness to come
Rays of light sneak through vapors
Determined to shine on the sacred ground

The road to hell lies dead ahead
It's too late now; we've been misled
The storm approaches from the west now

As we sail across the sea of time
We carry on; we don't look back
Still we march ahead, As The World Burns

Time will never end, hope is gone with hate
Fate is in our hands, but it is too late
Will we transcend, or fall into the well
A step we must take, for mankind's sake

The battle of all ages looms on the horizon
Nothing short of a miracle will stop it now
The rise and fall of Babylon
Should have warned us not to reach so high

Time will never end, hope is gone with hate
Fate is in our hands, but it is too late
Will we transcend, or fall into the well

The road to hell lies dead ahead
It's too late now; we've been misled
The storm approaches from the west now

As we sail across the sea of time
We carry on; we don't look back
Still we march ahead, As The World Burns
