Arrows fly across the sky
Their fires shine in the fading light
The prophets' words are ringing true in these final days

Nothing will remain; have to start all over again
As the dark memories fade, where will the children play

Time ans space meet in the streets of broken dreams
Where can the children play; there's no city of peace
Moon's glow delivers hope all across this hallowed land
Where will the children go; there's no city of peace

Burning candles light the way
Spirits dance the dance today
Wise men gather in the crowd
Their cries yield no sound

Shadows rise again, far above the din of pain
The nightmare never ends; someone please stop their reign

Time ans space meet in the streets of broken dreams
Where can the children play; there's no city of peace
Moon's glow delivers hope all across this hallowed land
Where will the children go; there's no city of peace

The final bell begins to chime
All the sinners stand in line

Nothing will remain; have to start all over again
As the dark memories fade, where will the children play

Time ans space meet in the streets of broken dreams
Where can the children play; there's no city of peace
Moon's glow delivers hope all across this hallowed land
Where will the children go; there's no city of peace
