Today's the day to pay the insane
Until now you've had the edge
Shadows dance across your room
Chasing you with unholy rage

No more are you allowed to dream
The end has come to the legacy
She won't stop until she has your soul
The kingdom has heard her call

Out of the darkness and into the light
The Queen is awakening on this night
Don't try to stop her, don't try to hide
It only feeds the hate inside

Do you remember the game
The one they used to play
When she calls your name
The Queen of the Insane
They came and went away
No one survived the day
The time has came to pay
The Queen of the Insane

Running through the bitter night
Her presence around you everywhere
Fallen child you see the truth in knowing;
She'll soon be there

Energy flows from within
Fate's whispers closing in
Drawing from the face that hides the light
Calling on the sun to shine

Out of the darkness and into the light
The Queen is awakening on this night
Don't try to stop her, don't try to hide
It only feeds the hate inside

Do you remember the game
The one they used to play
When she calls your name
The Queen of the Insane
They came and went away
No one survived the day
The time has came to pay
The Queen of the Insane

A final step taken to defy
Is not enough to break her spell
Lay down and take your final breath
As you stop inside her private hell

All your resistance was in vain
Defenseless to stop her reign
The armies of the damned now hear her call
Out of the ashes they crawl

Up from the darkness arising to fight
Voices awaken them in the night
She'll never falter, she'll never die
She holds the key of the second sight

Do you remember the game
The one they used to play
When she calls your name
The Queen of the Insane
They came and went away
No one survived the day
The time has came to pay
The Queen of the Insane
