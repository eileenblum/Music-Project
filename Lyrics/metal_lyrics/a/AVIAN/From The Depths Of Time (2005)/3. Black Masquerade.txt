Look around, see the fires burning moral ground
In the shadows all this time, feeling safe and sound
Shadows dance through the night; spirits come alive
Fools believe all is right, until no one survives

Blood red moon awaits, will the world awake
Signs of judgment day, time will seal our fate

Black Masquerade's upon us
The dance of fate has begun
The great charade devours us

Secrets made in the dark allowed to get this far
Sinners and saints share their crimes;
Leave their morals on the ground

Blood red moon awaits, will the world awake
Signs of judgment day, time will seal our fate

Black Masquerade's upon us
The dance of fate has begun
The great charade devours us
Black Masquerade has come
The day now has come to run
Black Masquerade's upon us
Chaos will reign our world

Silent cries cut the night, dying embers steal the light
Night and day turn to one, Guardians wait for a sign

Will the world awake, dreams revealing fate
The timeline has been set, will judgement day be altered yet

Black Masquerade's upon us
The dance of fate has begun
The great charade devours us
Black Masquerade has come
The day now has come to run
Black Masquerade's upon us
Chaos will reign our world
