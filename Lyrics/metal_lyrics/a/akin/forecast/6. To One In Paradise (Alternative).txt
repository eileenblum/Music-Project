Thou wast all that to me
For whom my soul did pine
A green island in sea
A fountain and a shrine

A dream to bright to last
But to be overcast
A voice from future cries
My spirit hovering lies

The light of life is over
No more shall bloom the thunder blasted tree
Or the stricken eagle soar!
Such language holds the solemn sea
To sands upon the shore
For alas with me
The light of life is over

And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eyes glance
And where my footstep gleams
In what ethereal dance

The light of life is over
No more shall bloom the thunder blasted tree
Or the stricken eagle soar!
Such language holds the solemn sea
To sands upon the shore
For alas with me
The light of life is over

The light of life is over
No more shall bloom the thunder blasted tree
Or the stricken eagle soar!
Such language holds the solemn sea
To sands upon the shore
For alas with me
The light of life is over
