Another day, another night that fades away
Another dream made up to keep me awake
Another charm created to make me believe
That my whole life is not so vain

Can't make my conscience clear
When did it start to make me grieve?
I only know what I foresee
In the meanders of my brain

I got the whole world in my mind
Everyone else is blind
But all that I can do
Is watch the fall of human race
Please tell me why I deserve this misery
I don't know who can I tell
Every part of my existence feels like hell?
Please cast the spell!

Future or past no one believe
The things I guess th poor outcast
Surely insane
More or less nevertheless
Whatever I can do
These cruel nightmares always come true

Prisoner of my own
Fear at any time
They can appear sooner or later
It will make me burn out in front of you

I got the whole world in my mind
Everyone else is blind
But all that I can do
Is watch the fall of human race
Please tell me why I deserve this misery
Late at night I cannot breathe
And I pray for death to come soon and be my release
