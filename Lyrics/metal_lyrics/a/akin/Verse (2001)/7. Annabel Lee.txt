It was many years ago, by the sounding sea
There lived a maiden known as Annabel Lee
And she fell in love with the mariner
What he said lingers in her memory
She heard him say

Long ago in the kingdom by the sounding sea

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful, beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful, beautiful Annabel Lee

And the Chosen One sailed away on the sounding sea
Leaving behind the Darling Annabel Lee
Every night I sing his words before the sea
For I am what is left from Annabel
Annabel Lee

Long ago in the kingdom by the sounding sea

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful, beautiful Annabel Lee
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful, beautiful Annabel Lee

And so at the night tide
I lie down by the sea
Where my Darling, my Darling set my soul aside
In my sepulchre there by the sea
In my tomb by the sounding sea
