By a route obscure and lonely
Haunted by ill angels only
Where an Eidolon name Night
On a black throne reigns upright
I have reached those lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule
From a wild weird clime that lieth, sublime
Out of space, out of time

By the mountains, by the lakes, that thus outspread
The lone waters, lone
Lone waters, lone and dead
Lone and dead
The sad waters, sad and chilly
Murmuring ever
With the snows of the lolling lily
By the mountains near the river

With forms that no man can discover
For the tears that drip all over

By the grey woods, by the lakes, the new encamp
By the dismal tarns
By the dismal tarns and pools
Most unholy
There go the friends long given
To the Earth and Heaven
By a route so obscure and lonely
Haunted by ill angels only

With forms that no man can discover
For the tears that drip all over

Seas that restlessly aspire
Surging unto sides of fire, unto skies of fire

With forms that no man can discover
For the tears that drip all over
