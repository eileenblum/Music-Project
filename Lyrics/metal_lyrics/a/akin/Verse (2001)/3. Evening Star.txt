Twas noontide of summer
And it was mid-time of night
Star in their orbits shining
Pale, so pale through the light
I gazed a while

And I turn away to thee, in thy glory afar
Proud Evening Star
And more I admire thy distant fire
Than that golden lonely light

The moon was so much brighter
Than the planets you were slaves
Herself in the Heavens
And with her beam on the waves
I gazed a while

And I turn away to thee, in thy glory afar
Proud Evening Star
And more I admire thy distant fire
Than that golden lonely light

And I turn away to thee, in thy glory afar
Proud Evening Star
And more I admire thy distant fire
Than that golden lonely light
