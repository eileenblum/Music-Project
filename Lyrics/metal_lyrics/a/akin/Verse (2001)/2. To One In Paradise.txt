Thou wast all that to me
For whom my soul did pine
A green island in sea
A fountain and a shrine

A dream to bright to last
But to be overcast
A voice from future cries
My spirit hovering lies

For alas! Alas! With me
The light of life is over
No more - no more - no more
Shall bloom the thunder blasted tree
For alas! Alas! With me
The light of life is over
No more - no more - no more
Shall the stricken eagle soar!

And all my nightly dreams
Are where thy dark eyes glance
And where my footstep gleams
In what ethereal dance

For alas! Alas! With me
The light of life is over
No more - no more - no more
Shall bloom the thunder blasted tree
For alas! Alas! With me
The light of life is over
No more - no more - no more
Shall the stricken eagle soar!

The light of life with me
Shall now be seen no more
Such language of the sea
To sands upon the shore

For alas! Alas! With me
The light of life is over
No more - no more - no more
Shall bloom the thunder blasted tree
For alas! Alas! With me
The light of life is over
No more - no more - no more
Shall the stricken eagle soar!
