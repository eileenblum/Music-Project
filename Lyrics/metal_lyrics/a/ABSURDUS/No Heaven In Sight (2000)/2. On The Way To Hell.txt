Cursed I am to walk this soil 
No light of grace shines on me 
In my pain I stare with empty eyes 
Cold walls surrounding me

Alone I crawl my darkest edges 
No warmth of life embracing me 
Through the night, through the light 
The outer dark is waiting me

I can feel...this darkness bleeding on me 
I can feel...life is running away from me

Drown your pain, drown your life 
This emptiness is too much to bear 
Drown your hate, drown your love 
This life ain't worth of living anymore

The pulse of strenght, once forgotten 
Whispers about my buried dignity 
These empty thoughts in these empty rooms 
Nothing compares to this agony

With this fire, with this pain 
My mortal life shall decease with hails 
Joyfull..is my final journey 
Towards those gates 

[pre-chorus]

On my way to hell 
Fucking up life so goddamn well 
On my way to hell 
I've got a soul yo sell 
On my way to hell 
I know the place where bastards dwell 
On my way to hell 
I'm every day 

No spark of hope in this twilight of mine 
The end as same what life used to be 
No dreams of glory, no dreams of life 
Putrefaction fucking guaranteed 

So come to me and gather your harvest 
Bleed your darkest bliss upon me 
Kingdom of fire is all I see 
Fastest lane down my journey will be 

[pre-chorus]
