Now beware 'cos we're all going to die 
Explosion and flames thousand miles high 
Don't you know there's no mercy for you 
Our fate lies in the Big Bang Doom 

It will rip your heart out of your chest 
It will leave you lying cold on your bed 
It's gonna tear your life apart 
It will eat your heart...bloody and raw 

Come down to see how Thy Kingdom will burn 
Step on the line and wait for your turn 
Take a look we're going to fall 
No sign of your "salvation" at all 

[chorus]

We all know it's gonna be pure hell 
But there won't be no-one left to tell 
You will enjoy your pain and so will I 
When all life leaves our beautiful mankind 

[chorus]
