There is a magick that even a time can't corrupt 
Pure hate for mankind, my misanthropic lust 
Cut me once and all of you shall bleed 
I will bring you down, down to your knees 

Can't you see...or don't believe? 
My actions don't give a place for disagree 
But soon you'll see...my harmony 
Your death is only a foreplay for my majesty 

Innerglow, superiority, I'll open the gates of the cemetery 
Feverish mind, greater than thine 
My fury's greater than your world of lies 

Stronger than thine 

Dreamlore so unreal, soon to crumble down 
Scravengers will feast like they've never done before 
My flames shall rise and you can kiss your life goodbye 
The stronger you resist more stronger I'll respond 

[pre-chorus]
