I've been blessed by the great pain of living 
My path is hard, my way is damn heavy 
Through the cold, ice cold snow 
In the cold I will walk alone 

To me the sun haven't shine 
To me that delight is the biggest of all lies 
Wherever I go, wherever I roam 
The darkness is my only hope 

Aah...the reaper my saviour 
When the life turns to night the silver blade will shine 

Don't you come to cross my way 
Don't give me hope of a another day 
Just step aside and run away 
Stay away from my life - my pain 

This frustration you can't feel 
All this anger and misery 
This sickness that reigns in me 
Is this how it was ment to be? 

[chorus]

So you tell me:"There is hope" 
But no, I'm at the end of my rope 
There won't be any victory of Man 
And when it comes to hope...I don't give a damn 

So fuck you and fuck your life 
I'll rape all the things that makes you smile 
And wherever you go, wherever you roam 
The darkness is your only hope 

Just do it and bleed with me 
Reaper is here to set you free 
To release the pain, running in vein 
To undo the dark, to cut hard 

[chorus]
