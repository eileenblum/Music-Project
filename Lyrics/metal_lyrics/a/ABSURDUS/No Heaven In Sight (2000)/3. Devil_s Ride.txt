It makes my blood boil when you say 
- Tomorrow will be a better day 
Well, let me tell, I don't fucking care 
I'm just too eager to get the hell out of here 

Hear me boy, there won't be no joy 
It'll all be swell when I burn in hell 
I love the Devil and his red eyes 
I know he's the fucker to rip apart my heart 

Maybe it's those eyes that burns in mine 
But it's your goddamn shovel that dug my grave 
The way I see only end is to be 
'cos without tomorrow we're free from the sorrow 

There's no need to speak of soul 
When heart is burned by rock n' roll 
And you know me I only wanna be 
One with the bullet when I'll be breaking free 

No heaven in sight 
All my life's just a Devil's ride 
Riding with pride 
Yeah, just hold on tight 

All my life's just one bad ride 
But when I go, I go down with style 
Smashing after fall, blasting to the wall 
Again and again, forever I shall fall 

Yes, I know where I will go 
So toast to you and to rock n' roll 
Overdrive I always ride 
Got the date with the Devil everynight 

[chorus]

One thing I know and I gotta say 
This world never was nor will be ok 
So what there is for you in sight 
But to ride...so let it ride 

There's no need to speak of soul 
When heart is burned by rock n' roll 
And you know me I only wanna be 
One with the bullet when I'll be breaking free 

[chorus]
