If you could see through my dreams 
And if you would fear my fears 
Would you stand by me? 
Would you sweep my tears? 

Follow me into my darkest realms 
Hallucinational, lonely sanctuary 
A kingdom where only strongest survive 
Where all but grief is a lie 

My kingdom 

Through these fields of twilight I ride 
In the depths of grief I dwell 
As my yearning is growing too deep 
I find my end in an ice cold stream 

I fly... 
Through these mighty landscapes of night 
I find... 
Myself trapped in this kingdom of mine
