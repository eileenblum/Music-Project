Snake-eyes burns the night while candlelight glows
My arms are raised high towars the sky
Into the river of oblivion's wine I shall drown
The secrets of clandestine lie before my eyes

Midnight - cracks my spine in two
Divine - ain't this goddamn life, no

Sorrow shine your light to me
Agony tremble the ground beneath me

Poison runs inside my veins 
As you sink your teeth in into my flesh
The guns of heaven will shoot me down
The guns of heaven will shoot me down

Vipers hiss when death hails me with her damned kiss
Cold killing rapture is freezing my lips
Fairytales, fairytales, they all sing to me
This sweet and temptating, delightful melody:

Walk through the shadows of dusk and dance before the fire with us
Let loose the wrath that paints your heart black
But my heart is black, like my wrath will only grow
The crimson stream of life will forever flow

[chorus]

This world is a lie, easier it would be to die
But we live in vain and die for the same
No moon nor the sun can sweep my tears away
Nothing can set me free from this life of agony

[chorus]
