A weapon of war
It's not a disease
Let's even the score

This game's a race

A race to the death
This game's a race
There'll be nothing left

Victim of the future
Just a victim of the past
Victim of the future
Do you think you'll last

It's just a game
A ticket to fame
Who'll know your name

Who will fight
Who will pay the price
Who will die

Victim of the future
Just a victim of the past
Victim of the future
Do you think you'll last

Victim of the future
Just a victim of the past
Victim of the future
Do you think you'll last
