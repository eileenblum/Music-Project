I wait for the subway to hell
Total relentless aggravation
No one will tell

Visions of death
Pass through your eye
The final journey
Of your life
No one knows where you'll be found
Mindless people won't be around

Lost with no destination
Bodies poisoned with sin
Seeing your life's destruction
Destroying the flesh from within

Visions of death
Pass through your eye
The final journey
Of your life
No one knows where you'll be found
Mindless people won't be around

Visions of death
Pass through your eye
The final journey
Of your life
No one knows where you'll be found
Mindless people won't be around
