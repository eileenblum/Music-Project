Devil seeks my soul tries to steal my breath
Fits of anger cry out as I spill my guts
Vomit fills the air as the coffin shuts

Devil seeks my soul tries to steal my breath
Fits of anger cry out as I spill my guts
Vomit fills the air as the coffin shuts

The Lords Prayer

Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the dead
They have ripped my heart out
Stole my soul and took my every breath
I've lost the will to live or die
Or follow in his ways
His death is marching on

Devil seeks my soul tries to steal my breath
Fits of anger cry out as I spill my guts
Vomit fills the air as the coffin shuts

Possession
