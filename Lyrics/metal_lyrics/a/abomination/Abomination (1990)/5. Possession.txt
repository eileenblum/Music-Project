Evil congregation born within my death
Devil seeks my soul tries to steal my breath
Fits of anger cry out as I spill my guts
Vomit fills the air as the coffin shuts

[Chorus:]
Possession
Possession

[Repeat first verse]

[Chorus]

[The Lords Prayer]

Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the dead
They have ripped my heart out
Stole my soul and took my every breath
I've lost the will to live or die
Or follow in his ways
His death is marching on

[Repeat first verse]

[Chorus]
