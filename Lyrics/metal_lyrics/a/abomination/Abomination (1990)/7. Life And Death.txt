Will has broken
Four walls close in
Thoughts of tomorrow
When will they win

Thoughts of suicide
It's just time to do
Will they repeat
The final sigh

The final ways of this one
Of sorrow and disgust
The ticking of the timebomb
The will of those are crushed

Do you believe that heaven
Or hell really exists
If you would just ask me
I think it's just a myth

[Chorus:]
Life, death
They just go hand in hand
Mind, soul
A powerful sad demand
Thought, distraught
Destruction of your sick mind

[Chorus]

[Repeat first and second verse]
