In the tunnel of damnation
I wait for the subway to hell
Total relentless aggravation
No one will tell

[Chorus:]
Visions of death
Pass through your eye
The final journey
Of your life
No one knows where you'll be found
Mindless people won't be around

Lost with no destination
Bodies poisoned with sin
Seeing your lifes destruction
Destroying the flesh from within

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
