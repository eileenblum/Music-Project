Antagonistic pressure
It lives in all of those
Who set the standard for their lives
Who preach upon their goals

They send the squads of police
Enforced authority
But soon they'll break away
Then they'll all be free

Social wars, riots killing
Everything has changed
Death defying mutant warriors
Only will remain

Subliminal seduction
A simple mind control
Pick the brains of those insane
But who's the bigger fool

Watch the city lights
As the students plan their fight
A social war against the system
Plotting their impending doom

[Chorus:]
Impending doom
The time is here
They'll shed a tear
Then they'll pull the knife
They'll kill the one
Who's in their way
Impending doom is here to stay

Wake up from a nightmare
Blood has stained the sheets
Everything been terrorized
Evil plan complete
