He's the leader of the land
He just fronts the Manson clan
Power over all death and sin
Storm the ill

He just does this
Can't you see
Leads the weak in my affairs
Twist the army
Spread the fear

Races colors different creeds
Leeches on to whom be needs
All shall parish burn in flames
Storm the ill

[Chorus:]
Send your money
To the church of Christ
Leeching on like a parasite
Earn a place in the kinder life
Everyone's in search of paradise

[Chorus 2:]
Follower if the president
Do you think he's really heaven sent
He'll just push the button soon someday
It's the fame it's really childs play
