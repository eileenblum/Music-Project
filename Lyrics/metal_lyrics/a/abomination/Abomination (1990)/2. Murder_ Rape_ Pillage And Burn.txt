Put to the battlefield
With gun in hand
Following orders
Every demand

[Chorus:]

Murder, rape, pilage and burn
And kill, destroy we learn

We fight for your country
The land of the brave
We'll kill all your children
We'll make you a slave

We'll rape all your women
We'll burn your house down
We'll kill all your children
We won't make a sound

[Chorus]

[Repeat first verse]

[Chorus]

[Repeat second verse]
