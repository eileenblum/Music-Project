Your antidote for sickness
Is the source of my cure
In a different form of course
With more pleasure
I am sure

They help me deal with the pain
To enhance the pleasure of this life I lead
An addiction or a crutch they are not
And them I do not need

[Chorus:]
But I desire them, I confess
In a strange sort of way
With no remorse, I may add

But worry not you need not pay
I'll influence your decision not
Merely show you both sides
Of the invisible line
Where pain and pleasure collide

You need not tell me of their worthlessness
They've not hurt me I believe
More harmful to some than others
So if you are some reprieve

And though it, it sounds so easy
Distinguish between the two to
You may not, may not know till it's too late
The choice is, the choice is up to you

[Chorus:]
You see I have painfully learned
To infringe my beliefs on no one
I have seen first hand
The damage they have done
I've witnessed for myself
The hands which they have dealt
The blankness in ones eyes
As their brains begin to melt
And as they plead for your assistance
In their moments of confusion
You stand helpless but say
This is only an illusion

The choice is, the choice is up to you
The choice is, the choice is up to you
The choice is, the choice is up to you
The choice which you may lose
