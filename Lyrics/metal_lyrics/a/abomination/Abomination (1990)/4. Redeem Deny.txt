Money from the genius mind
Who help create the master plan
Rulers underground beneath the surface
Slowly wakening

Futuristic weapons just created
For your suffering
Made in his own image
Just to see we did where we'd go wrong

[Chorus 1:]
Tempted from the fruits of life
An onward search for destiny
Callous people reach for power
Leadership and reasoning

[Chorus 2:]
Redeem deny
Redeem deny

Promises are glorified
The evil sins of deadly fiends
Money money changing hands
To buy the world of all demand

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
