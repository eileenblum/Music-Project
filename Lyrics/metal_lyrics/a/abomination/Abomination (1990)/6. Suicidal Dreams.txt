Kill your father
Kill your friend
Kill your neighbor
When will it end

Join the army, navy
Airforce, marines
Follow the battalion
Suicidal dreams

A vicious circle
Of death, sin and pain
History repeats
Again and again

Walk through the darkness
Everyone's asleep
Daytime's their world
Nighttime's defeat

Just a policeman
A figure well known
Product of society
Where did he go wrong

[Chorus:]
Just kill the dealer
Is this right or wrong
Is there no justice
The man with gun

[Chorus]
