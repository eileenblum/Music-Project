Ripped, ripped apart
torn, torn to shreds
Reformation is terror
Re-arrange the exterior

Exuviae the body
When will we begin
Searching for the unholy cure
This is the deadly disease

Injecting fluid
That take away life
We hold the scalpel
They hold the knife

Brought back into the world
In a different shape or form
Put ourselves in the scientists hands
Do you think they really understand

[Chorus 1:]
Reformation
Regeneration
Reconstruction
Everlasting defeat

I have decided this
It's in my hands
I will discover
Another world

[Chorus 2:]
We're almighty
Creators of sin
We mold the world in our own way
We'll soon begin
The experiment has failed
We'll try again
Will we discover
An alternative plan

[Repeat chorus 2]
