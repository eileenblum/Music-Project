Lessons in might, lessons in stress
Teachings of right, reasons of less
Seekers of strenght, only they guess
Will they proceed, or will they suppress

Frequent, illusive, you have the power to follow the one
Decisive, conclusive, the fall of the world has just begun
Wasteful, astounding, violence and force is the only way
Corrupted, misguided, we will lose thousands of people today

The fall of priest Hussein
Allah is to blame
Islamic fools of war
Soon will live no more

Ablative, abeyance, depriving the world with disruption of peace
Deceitful, fascists, holding the fate of the world in our hands
Harmonic, defiance, taking for granted the gift human life
Ironic, compliance, testing the fruits of their progressive toys

Will trade our blood for oil
Until our hands have been soiled
Civilians, pawns and kings
Will pay the penalty

The countdown of the endless problems
All the endless fools soon brought down
Never knowing where they've fallen
Has our Creator been calling

Countless bodies, piles of ashes
Severed mortar, wasteful clashes
Is the worth the whole disaster
Is the life, we're dying faster

Seasons of death, a game of chess
Leaders of pawns, where do they spawn
Just raised for war, to open the door
The door of demise, the deadly surprise
