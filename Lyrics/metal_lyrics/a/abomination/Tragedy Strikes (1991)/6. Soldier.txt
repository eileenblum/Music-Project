We think we're men of steel
We're angry and we're fueled
Commanding, they retreat

Prisoners of the war
Captured fallen peace
Will they find the door

On your knees soldier
Die for peace soldier

Aggrassive
Upperhand
Marching through the sand
Will they take command

Countless causualties
Blood and gore to see
Censored for the week

Dumping oil at sea
New victims of the war
Dying gracefully

Recessions marches near
The checks have all been void
The classes are all clear

We think we're men of steel
We're angry and we're fueled
Commanding, they retreat

Prisoners of the war
Captured fallen peace
Will they find the door
