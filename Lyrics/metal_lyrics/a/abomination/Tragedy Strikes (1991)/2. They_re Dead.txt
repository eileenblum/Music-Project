Where are all my friends now
Acquaintences have come and gone
Past along the road of life
Familiar scenes and photographs

Stand tall
Forget
Stand tall
They're dead

Life has had it's up and down
In past they'd be around
There to lend a helping hand
Friends are often in demand

Enemies and friends just coexist
Jealousy puts me on their hate list
Magazins spells truth in my own words
Recreate the hell they all deserve

Reassured that they've all gone
Once I thought they'd be along
They live behind a platic mask
Such a self assuring task

Censored values, empty visions
No preditions, no decisions
Mother loser living at home
Never left the nest to unknown
Bewildered in the face of danger
Obesely structured fallen angel
Mommy dearest is his savior
Laughing at the newest stranger

Enemies and friens just coexist
Jealousy puts me on their hate list
Magazins spells truth in my own words
Recreate the hell they all deserve
