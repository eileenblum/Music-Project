Alcohol infested lives
In the night they seem to fly
Never ending road to death
Neveer near the home stretch
Lack of guidance, sudden trust
Will they soon forget the loss

Everyone's refuse to drive
Designit in charge of lives
Will they cross the final bridge
Will they parish in a ditch

Pull the plug, the right to drive a privalege
Stop the fools, don't override decision
Pull the plug, the right to die your option
He's the judge, allows this to continue

Best of all evils are never deprived
Consumed by the handfuls and ruining our lives
Violent cutback the system avoids
Protecting the children, from dangerous exploits

Buy a license from the state
Such a little price to pay
Drive them all to sudden death
Pull the plug and gain respect
