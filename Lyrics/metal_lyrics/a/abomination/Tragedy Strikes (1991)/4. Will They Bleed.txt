Aggrandize their strenght
Focalize on their might
Mobilize troops of race
A war in the street formalized

Weapons support wasteful efforts
Deceptions appear in their eyes
The battles of youthful expressions
Countermine the surprise

The battle rages on

Professors of sinful exploits
Neighborhoods fall to shame
Graffiti the powerful voice
Desecrating the way

Violent crime investigators
Seldom follow any clues
No one wants to get insolved
Never wants to be abused

Forces chosen
Peace is frozen
Children corrupted
Equal justice

Silent persecution, no solution
Will they bleed
Bent on retribution, no conclusions
Will they bleed
Festive dementation, defamation
Will they bleed
Suggestive absolution, last conclusion
Will they bleed
