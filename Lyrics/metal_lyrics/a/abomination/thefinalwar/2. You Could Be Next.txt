The threat it comes alive
I've seen the demon's eyes
The dark suspected face
Wouldn't be me?

In death my mind consumes
the lights in every room
I've left reality
And now she's dead

The years are on the run
Disruling everyone
The drug became in doom
I would still breathe

The violence [?]
They know if I'm released
soon they realise
my master disease

Murder, Violence, Believe
Murder, Silence, Disease

You better realise
before you're traumatized
you leave couldn't be me
and I still breathe

I learn the streets at night
I've taken many lives
I've caught my eye on you
You could be next

Murder, Violence, Believe
Murder, Silence, Disease
Murder, Violence, Believe
Murder, Silence, Disease

IT COULD BE ME!
