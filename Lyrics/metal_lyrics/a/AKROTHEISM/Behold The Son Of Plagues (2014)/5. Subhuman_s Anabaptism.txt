We call you, remember us in your sacrifice of bedience. Inner savior, our kinsman redeemer god. Rise from the ancient dark and from the vexation of our spirit. Be the Elohim dressed with the veil of  our perversion and seal our name in your glorious book of life. Be our son in afterlife and believe in us. Repellent faces in masses vomit the semen of their Lord. The carrier of the wooden tomb, shall this burden be mine. On-knees surrounding by the gratefully locusts of the ages. Sing by your ears the hymns of salvation. Mind morphine injected in overdoses through your white eyes. Petrified by the majesty of nihil. And now, wide open, served to the vultures of lust.
Submerse into the waters. The sub-humans Anabaptism. The chrism of purity. Ablution in the name of fatalism. Be clean enough from the greediness. You are now famished for another piece of his body. And you drank of his blood. Those with no eyes shall see the sunbeams of hope. And those with no tongue shall speak the truth. Behold the fall of all creation. The Jordan river became mud. Grab the whore's hand, with the same you held the stone.
Enslaved by the apprehension of hate and anger. A God with human passions?
