Set these wounds, let your filthy scars to reflect your rapturous soul once again. Vomiting mirth, great absolution. Enjoy pleasure through punishment. Betray your faithless god! Violent perfection, bloody argument spreading the shame of a kneeling slave. Holy incision, under the sun of covered decay, comforting your prayers of despair. Capacitate your cankerous glare to see the light of sordid rebirth and slowly deteriorate in an anguished corpse. Merciless reaping of skin until you will be clean in the eyes of your lord. Garment of vengeance a contrition soil. Behold the whip of flawless execution. Rejoice in suffering bless. Be the martyr of a corrupted fate. Be the lie of a leper mouth. Be the choice of a dying mind and heavily breath the air of divine dirt. Be the whisper of a pervasive ambition. Be the voice of a new born daimonic son. Everlasting mechanism of cerebral darkness. A printing machine of stitching alms, examines your sinful body. Resurgering divine truths from the hideous viscera of your subordinate being.
