Prayers through stuttering growls. Infallible grace of malignant narcissism in a vertigo of madness. Monstrous psalms beyond woeful hopes and truths. Gathering of a myriad worms, inside a mind of devotion. Leaving their noxious fluids, completing the pus of a sickening deliverance. Swollen head of heavenly retribution. Internal termination, sacred humiliation.
Generations come and go but the dreadful void of inward desolation abided forever to molest the essence of being. A sacrilegious spawn of esoteric depravation is prospering from the depths of cerebral darkness, flowing in the arteries of an unshriven carrion. Giving life for just a moment to suffer in the light of frightful absolution. Kneeling in  trembling silence, under the magnificence of a clamorous faith. Beneath a sun of a morphine sanctification, shining from the void of aneerie empty eye. Burning in righteous felony, flickering in putrefaction. Enlighten by the vision of a dream figure in the nightmare of a dying god. And rotten is the eternity that lies in the drug of egocentric penitence. Expressed with infected spasms of obedience to the point of subconscious assumption. Ecofantric beating of a secular ghost. Hierophant of tupitude tormenting human flesh, spitting blasphemies to the ailing hypostasis of idolater subordination. Running towards the edge of nihilism. Committing a salvific suicide, you mongrel swines and suppurative pigs.
