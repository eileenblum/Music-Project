Behold your martyrdom! Shrine of betrayal, erasing of sins through violent oaths. Cursed silence, confessing death in flawless dearth. Sovereign solemn void fulfils the shame like a plague from an ancient scar. Verminous whole of anomalous nativity is trembling in endless reviving. Vague delectation of faith under prayers of myriad woes. Shaft of great villain rebirth, degraded monument of infallible chastisement. Well of frantic cleansement. Rising in eternal decay. And dark is the essence of all things, famished for failure. Towards the blight of my being, swarming in the pit of sin. Martyr of man, servent of his highness, skinless straw. Hanging in reverse, suffers a high devotion. Immaculate terror lord, bearer of my inscrutable fate. Rots in front of me. Hovering in abjection on the edge of that bottomless shaft. In an insane blessing of contrition, a stab of reliance enthrones my hideous affinity to him. Dire divine galvanizes the vessel of salvation with a mire of manure pouring from the hangman's seed. Pouring from his fanatic moans of hate, feeding my soul. And I am god an aborted god. I am his sacred ghost. A dog on a chain, waiting in rabidity to commune the venom of his obscene wounds. Under the fever of greed, under a ruthless thirst. I benefit my self, by devouring his holy flesh. Pure from his encharist. Connecting circles of psychic murders. Create his own loathsome chain, holds him in abyss. Spilling scoria with grace, to wash his legs. A lethal miasma of deconsecration. As I consume the divine cancer nurtured in the depths of his spleen. His eyes hermetically tied, keep within, buried, a testament of hatred and revenge. You the seed of our decay, our mortal child. Be the preacher and the third hypostasis of our damnation.
