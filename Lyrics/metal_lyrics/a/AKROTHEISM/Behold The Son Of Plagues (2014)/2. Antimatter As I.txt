Abominable carcass, decapitated inhuman birth. Infallible, splendorous shine, an angelic flame, burning again. Cathartirial furnace, purified boiled blood. Showers of faith in ashes of sin, a joyful reward of redemption. Adorned with the coal of a messiah. A light collapsing the yoke of man. Melting mortal rot with sacred mirth. Morbid radiance warms the orchard of humanity. Flourishing in corruption and every kind of life, pray praise his name. Intrapsychic sadism, an infected pulse is pressing the skull. Neurotic spasms, roaring within, overthrow, severing soul. Incinerated ripped heads, prophets of his come. Filthy tongues, kissing in vain the emblems of a dying religion. Bless us who licked the acid tears from your majestic icon. Bless us in the spell of your perpetual wrath. And let us be the first to walk under your sun of ethereal decay. You our only son and carrier of our dreams. Incessant termination, in rust arise. A holy injection to the conscious of subordinating beings. Carcinogen transfusion, taking away the anguish of mankind's sorrow, dehumanizing psalm. Entreat for a death supreme. Hand in hand the narcoleptic priests are preaching about his birth while trembling in forgiving epilepsy. In paranoid confusion, they placing their mouths upon the utter of blasphemy, mangling everything within. Communing the flesh and blood of the antimatter God. Cataclysmic flood of beneficial rays of faith. Celebrate a rapping diving, a glorious and intense sanction of souls.
