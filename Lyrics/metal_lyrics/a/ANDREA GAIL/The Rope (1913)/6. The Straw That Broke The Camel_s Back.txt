Iâm full of resolve
I have no strength to mortify my anger
I cannot hold this hate inside
Breaking down 
May damnation take them
I am who I am
Theyâre just scums! Oh!
Should I calm down?
Or maybe I should just leave them alone?
Or watch them fall into the arms of decay?
Theyâll have it coming!
Iâm sure that they should not exist 
For heavenâs sake make them disappear
Burn in hell!

Who will restore the balance? [x3]

Is it early days yet for people to live in harmony and without torments?
They say future is in our hands
But why do we feel so helpless then?

Things are waiting for actions from our side
We have to hold our own
I wish we could do more
But future is in mist
Future is in mist
We forge our strength with our own hands
We gotta stick together
And move towards the mist
We hope that our number will grow [x2]
