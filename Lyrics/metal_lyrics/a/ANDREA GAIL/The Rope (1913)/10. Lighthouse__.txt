Night brings patience
And lucidity of mind
Am I the only one who is awake?
It seems to me that right now
Things are even more real and clear
To some extent I am filled with darkness
With darkness
I donât need the sun to be my source of light
Cause Iâve got it inside
I donât need the moon to be my company
Cause Iâve got it inside
Iâve locked the darkness in the lighthouse
Itâs all about keeping it inside and not letting it out
This is what my life turns in
I am filled with darkness and light
Iâm a lighthouse
I donât need the sun to be my source of light
Cause Iâve got it inside
I donât need the moon to be my company
Cause Iâve got it inside
I give my light to those who are adrift and keep the darkness inside
Cause I am
A lighthouse
I donât need the sun to be my source of light
Cause Iâve got it inside
I donât need the moon to be my company
Cause Iâve got it inside
