[feat. Morf from Stanmarsh]Red beams pierce through the sky moving us away from what we have already reached
The place we stand is way too far from where we want it to be
What makes things take an unexpected turn?

Man try to think 
Why donât you just believe
The good old days
They ainât no more
The war has become visible
It has touched upon the sore spots of you
We will move ahead just like we did 
Just like we did before

The good thing is
The good thing is we have our heads screwed on right
Weâve got some common sense
But anyway weâre trying to bring everything back

Things will never be the same
Use the hints that sky gives you
The war has become visible
It has touched upon the sore spots of you
We will move ahead just like we did 
Just like we did before

Be honest with yourself
Stop mourning for the past
Pull yourself together 
And join us!
