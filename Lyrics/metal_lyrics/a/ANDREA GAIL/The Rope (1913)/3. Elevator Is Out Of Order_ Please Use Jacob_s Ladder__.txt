Where is the Garden of Eden?
We search for it
We try to find
We try to grow
What do you think about it?

Break! Broken hopes leave us uncertain
We're walking quite a distant road
To make this all come true
To see the sun, to talk to God,
But we discovered that

Jacob's Ladder breaks!

Erect the monumet to the ideals
Maybe it will soothe you
And maybe not
However act firmly and don't stick to the rules

Resemblance to the experience
Seems to be non-erasable
I do not understand
Whose joke was that

What are we to do now?
Where is our fortune?

This kind of perplexity
Leaves us uncertain
We'll not leave this place
Until we find another one
Another ladder

Keep your eyes open, pals!
Keep your hearts pure!
