Righteousness! [x2]
I wish the blindfold daughter of Earth could see
Whatâs happening to her mother
To her mother
I hope Iâm wrong and she will reward us according to our deserts
According to our deserts

Accept it gracefully
Too late to be afraid
Weâre are ready to sacrifice
We are ready to give out lives to justice
And weâll do that as soon as she demands
As soon as she demands

(Max, what do you want for dinner? Justice!)

We want justice right here
Right now!
Righteousness! [x2]
I wish the blindfold daughter of Earth could see
Whatâs happening to her mother
To her mother
I hope Iâm wrong and she will reward us according to our deserts
According to our deserts
Weâre sick of waiting
Make haste
We need you!
