Thereâs no need to be as wise as Solomon 
To see that world has mired down 
We canât see the end, canât see the end 
We are accountable for our actions
The way we choose determines our future

Have you ever thought that itâs not right
To live your life
Without any sort of aspiration
Weâre not the ones that you will listen to
But we just wanted to share our experience 
Nobody likes to suffer 
Then why do we make suffer others
Itâs not right to make your life go down the drain
Perhaps it would be better to stop and think

It would be better to stop and think
Use your head
Light the torch
A lot of days are ahead and each of them is important
Donât waste your time itâs going fast
Too many things went wrong
Time is up [x2]
Donât be the one who doesnât care
Indifference is like abyss 
It will swallow you
So try to make the right choice
