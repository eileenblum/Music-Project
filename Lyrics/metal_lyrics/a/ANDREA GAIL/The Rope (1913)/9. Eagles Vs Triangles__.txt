I see these guys every time I walk out of my front door 
I leave my house to get some fresh air
I walk, I see their faces full of arrogance
They crawl, they look like serpents in the grass.

Led by the fashion and false ideas theyâre just showing off to piss me off
To piss me off
What in the world does that mean?
Triangles on your shirts
And all-seeing eyes
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?
I am the one who does not believe in this crap
You canât fill the emptiness with the emptiness
It isnât even worth trying

I think I will repeat the previous verse again
I see you guys every time I walk out of my front door 
I leave my house to get some fresh air
I hope some day you will head off from the wrong way
Just donât forget about the things you truly love

Let it be our last attempt to evoke a response from you

Youâre not a mirror
Youâre not a reflection
So fuck the fashion [x2]

Stick to what you truly love
Donât forget about the things Iâve said
If you are born to be an eagle
Why are you pretending to be a flying rat? [x2]
Step over that
Donât be a victim
You are an eagle [x2]
