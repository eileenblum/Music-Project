Itâs 9 a.m. 
You woke me up to meet a new day
Side by side with you we stand
Striving not to lose the count of days
Not to get stuck in the ruts
Side by side with you we stand
Hardships persist
Side by side with you we stand
Side by side
We will pull through that
Iâm with you for bad or worse
Letâs keep these memories in mind to have something
To be proud of
Life is a competition
And we wanna be on top

The winds are getting up
We get stronger everyday
However weâre still so weak
So far from the ideal
Far from the truth

Itâs 10 p.m.
Looks like our days have come to an end
Side by side with you we stand
Luckily we didnât lose the count of days
Didnât get stuck in the ruts
Side by side with you we stood [x2]

Iâm so glad that we went through that together
So many false steps weâve made
But we may call our lives well-spent
Weâve kept these memories in mind 
We have something
To be proud of
Life was a competition
And we almost reached on top
We almost reached the top
