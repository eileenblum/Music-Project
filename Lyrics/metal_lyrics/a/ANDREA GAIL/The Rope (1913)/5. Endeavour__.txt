A question has come to my mind
Why do I keep asking myself?
Where are you heading like a tumbleweed?
Like a rock that falls down the cliff?
You are wasting everything!
I find it hard to believe but youâll always have a chance to turn over a new leaf
Weâre stuck between our desires
Weâre taking hold of ourselves 
But maybe thatâs not the key
Thatâs simply another deadlock
Another delusion
We fucked up!
What if weâre doomed?
Whaaaaaaaaat?
The outcome is close!
It will show you the truth!
I know that sucks to be kept in the dark!
Weâre taking hold of ourselves 
But maybe thatâs not the key
Thatâs simply another deadlock
Another delusion
We are free!
We are free to choose and believe in what we want to believe
And hope that we have one more endeavour! [x3]
