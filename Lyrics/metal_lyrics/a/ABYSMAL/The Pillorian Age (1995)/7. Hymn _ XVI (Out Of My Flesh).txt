Oh Darkness,
I will give the throne onto him
Of Darkness,
I am harvesting the growth of my first spring
Of Darkness,
Through me you gave him the life
Of Darkness,
One world shadowed in me

Throught you - the birth of the Pillorian Age
Throught you - the sand of the Gallow's Land
Throught you - the rest of Velvet Pilloria
Throught you - I will pass on my given oath

So I am falling my son
For my mission is done
My visions and you became one
Out of my flesh...
...you shall build the town
