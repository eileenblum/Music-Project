In the coming of the shadowed night
As the wind circles me in
Licks me wet all throught my clothes
The only one to witness my sin

I, Fornicator
I, the conqueror of your land
You, the carrion of my child
Greet the birth of the darkest eve

Queen Pilloria
I have tasted your tears

Her vagina as cold as ice
My love for her will never die
...never die!!!

Setting sails for the shores beyond
On a mission to seek my kingdom
On a shore so pure and virginal
I found my reich as well as my queen

I, Fornicator
I, the mounter, the man
I, Fornicator
We, the King and the Queen
