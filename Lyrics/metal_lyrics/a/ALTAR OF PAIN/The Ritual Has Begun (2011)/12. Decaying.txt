Rotting, decaying, filthy maggots
Consuming thy sacred flesh
Butcher, murderer, blasphemer kill me
Guide me to the gates of hell

Bleeding a slowly death
Under a freezing moon

All shall be slaughtered
Under the morning star

Satan, have no mercy upon me
Devour this rotting mortal soul

Butcher, unmerciful demon
Make us suffer in agony
