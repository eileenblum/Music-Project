Hordes prepare for battle
Strong pagan fearless men
Enemies they fight to death
Honor until the last breath

Bloodstained swords of death
Valkyries come for the Dead

In the darkness of the night
Swords still they strike
Blood stains the sea
Warning the dead to be

The victorious now reign
On this damned conquered land
Blood thirsty warriors
Burn the dead above the sand

On these shores of death
A painful last breath

Crossing seas, hords of pain
Forever killing enemies again
Draining there blood on the sand
Of this conquered forsaken land
