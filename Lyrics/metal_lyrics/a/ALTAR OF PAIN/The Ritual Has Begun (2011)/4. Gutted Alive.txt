Abducted to the temple of death
Chained to the altar of pain
Strapping your neck, beg to choke
Slidering the blade through your throat

Gutted!
Alive!

Feel the spear pierce your chest
Breaking your ribs ripping flesh
Screams of agony symphony of pain
The walls with blood are stain

Gutted!!
Alive!!

Enslaved to the sleepless gods
Tears of blood you cry
Caressed by the serpents tongue
Gutted alive before you die

Dark temple of death
Cannibals rip your flesh
Altar made of human bones
Rotting pigs fill this home

Gutted!
Alive!!

Your heart a gift for the gods
Your guts a gift for the dogs
These sick feelings inside my head
But how I love to fuck the dead

Gutted !!
Alive!!

Enslaved to the sleepless gods
Tears of blood you cry
Caressed by the serpents tongue
Gutted alive before you die
