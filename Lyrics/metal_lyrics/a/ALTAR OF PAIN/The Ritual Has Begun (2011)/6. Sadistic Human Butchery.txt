A violent state of frenzy, induces murder
Tearing out her face as she stares at me
My instinct forces me to kill
Conflicting personalities haunt me

Sadistic it may seem and so it is
Viciously I carve your flesh

Bursting your ribs wide open
I crave for your demise

Blood drips for the head I just severed
I realise how addictive is my passion
I thrive to kill, no remorse no regret
No mercy on my path

Sadistic it may seem and so it is
Viciously I carve your flesh

Bursting your ribs wide open
I crave for your demise

Mutilation is an art to conceive
I pray for flesh and baptize in blood
The insatiable urge for killing
Indulges my passion together with my conscience
