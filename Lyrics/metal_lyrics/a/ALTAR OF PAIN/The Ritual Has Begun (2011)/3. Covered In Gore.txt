Tightly strapped to my bed
Distorted thoughts through my head
I take the blade and stab it in
All the blood covers my skin

Under the horns of Baphomet
The ultimate blood sacrifice

In the flames of inferno
I condemn your soul

Under the horns of Baphomet
Sentenced you are

Blood ritual complete
Lets begin the feast

River of blood i fall
Drowning my soul
Death angels fly
YouÂ´re about to die

Skin ripped from your head
You rot alone and dead
Spreading death and gore
Guts and brains on the floor

Gore splattered death
Morbid rotting flesh
