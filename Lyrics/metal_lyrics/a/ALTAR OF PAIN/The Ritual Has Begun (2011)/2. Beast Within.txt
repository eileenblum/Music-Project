A half eaten body
Soaked in blood
Rotting by the graveyard
In a puddle of mud

Members rotting everywhere
Only bone to chew
Ripping off a lung
A kidney or two

Blood covers my face
It only feeds my passion
Your entrails coming out of you
One of my greatest actions

Sodomize your every hole
With my maggot filled dick
No use for a tool
That would only make it seem sick

Full moon night, night of the beast
Pleasing my hunger, on fresh meat
