Rising From Their graves
Flesh hungry zombie slaves
Stalking human cunts to eat
Zombies devour fresh meat

Biting into the veins
Your blood is drained
Separating neck from head
Another feast for the dead

Undead zombie slaves
Hunger for flesh they crave
Feasting with no remorse
On every corner a rotting corpse

Under a dark crimson sky
Ripping your eyes before you die
Splattered remains of bloody flesh
Ripping limbs, you bleed to death
