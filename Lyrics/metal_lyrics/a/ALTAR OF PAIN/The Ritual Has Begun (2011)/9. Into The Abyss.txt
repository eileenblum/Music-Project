I am Belial, commander of legions
Servant of hell, general of death
Out of the abyss legions of pain
On the damned land strike again

Innocent pure sinless flesh
Invaded by the forces of darkness
Become now my temple of flesh

Your inside i caress
In your agony i possess
Feel my putrid breath
Feel your death

No ritual can set you free
Deeper and deeper i pull thee
Into the abyss you drown with me
Suffering imprisoned eternity
