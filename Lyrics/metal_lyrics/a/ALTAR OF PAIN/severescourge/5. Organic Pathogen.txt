Existence of molecule structure
Empathise with life
Imperfection forms of tissue,
Structure and function

Breaking the foundations
The birth of iniquity
Entering the seven circle
Expect the void inside

In searching for guidelines
Existing forms when reality dies
Catharsis through the eyes
Of a victim of self despair

Erase the contradiction and rewind
Punishment still feeds the fear
Mental deterioration absorbs affection
Not enough to fill the void

Excruciating pain, never-ending
Tormented emotion, losing consciousness
Suffering any solution
The forceful insertion of a substance

Loosing cohesion and unity
The undergo of fission
Adverse effect gives the need to feed
On human suffering
