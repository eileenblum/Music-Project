Challenging nature with weapon: technology
Changing our minds using machines
Replacement of cells, modified anathomy
Killing us humans, advanced creation... destroy

Survival of flesh, no more emotions
Breathless beings, conscienceless acts
Vanished values, principles undone
Morality ignored, leave no stone unturned

Taking control over humanity
Ingnoring all laws, derived from ancestors
Leaving behind, our host.. the nature
The end day is near, they force the arrival

Producing a race, genetically inhuman
Atrocious creators, believers of greed
Total control, material and ethic
Forgetting the day, that they will be drawned

Fake evolution, massive production
Selecting the ones, aryan excuses
Manipulators of populations
A new age comes where story are men
