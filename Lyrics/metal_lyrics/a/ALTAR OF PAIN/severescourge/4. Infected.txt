My eyes when stripped, 
Undressed by betrayal,...
The abyss I fall 
For visions foresaw.
Fooled we are all 
By those, the famines:
A plague... A curse...
Intoxication! 

Cancer I see into mankind, 
Growing darkened glow. 
A siamese mirrored eye, 
Reflecting rotten humanity. 

Cancer abnormal humans growth. 
Abhorrent, 
My eyes to them.

Gloomed they are, 
Decayed will end.
Alone shall falter 
Consumed to death.
Disdain for hatred, 
With death aside. 
Buried alive;
Indoctrination!

Cancerous thoughts into beastkind 
Growing outer glow.
Lurking actions lies, 
Strangling ingenuous humanity 

Cancer abnormal humans growth. 
Abhorrent, 
My eyes to them
