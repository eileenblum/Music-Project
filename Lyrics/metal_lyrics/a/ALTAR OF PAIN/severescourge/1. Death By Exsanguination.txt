Blood gushing out the dismembered corps
A pool of red mud moving slowly on the ground
Injected powdered glass into his veins
Blood vessels shattered untill deformation
Stagnant eyes covered in dry somber tears
His morbid pale face splitted into parts
No flesh knows of its bones nor skin
lungs impalement using his femur

Brain drenched, fertile juice
Perished entrails, sodomized
Innards fluids, teared off
Nerves mutilation

Pulp of each tooth spread on the ground
Pancreatic secretions merged with diarrhea
Smashed larynx still bleeds drops of spit
Butchered knees chopped until seperation
Loins thrown away for worms devoration
whipped his head with his own broken spine
Nails ripped off and blended to the tonge
Sucking the marrow of his fractured skull

Bones and meat, fragmentizing
Head and feet, stretched tight
Pleasure with axe, stabbed to death
Spine contortion

Severe scourge
Gnawed flesh
Tortured for blood
Tormented as hell
Impious acts
Pagan influence
Offensive demeanor
Purge myself
