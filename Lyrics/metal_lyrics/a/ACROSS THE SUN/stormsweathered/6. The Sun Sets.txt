Can you feel this
Pervading through
Unveil the light
Illuminate
May I wisely
Appropriate

Seek the truth 
You shall find
Righteousness
When the world 
Falls apart

Witness hopelessness
My backs against
This damning wall
Witness hopes impress
I reach for a hand 
To you I call

When that's done
No sunsets
Will slip through your fingertips
(they will not)
Will you stand by me
Or will you just run away
I wander this world paralyzed by hatred
(by this hatred)
If anytime I fall 
Will you pick me up

Witness hopelessness 
My backs against 
This damning wall
Witness hopes impress
I reach for a hand
To you I call

[Repeat chorus]

I feel this
Pervaded through
Unveiled the light
Illuminate
I wisely
Appropriate

Sought the truth 
And I found
Righteousness
When the world
Falls apart
