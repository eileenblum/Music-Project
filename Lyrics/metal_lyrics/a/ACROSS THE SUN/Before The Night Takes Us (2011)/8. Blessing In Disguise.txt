Each morning as I look into the mirror
Your face, adored, appears to me
Reflections of my childhood 
Holding strong still
Replays inside me endlessly

Left without saying farewell
Must have been the angels time to save you
Though I never will forget
Days of mourning must now be through

Since before the moment
Memory took hold
The source of strength and wisdom
A sanctuary, A home
With no regard to reason nor circumstance
All worry ceased and all was right
With the world

No words can express
My love and gratitude
I'll hold it in my heart
And keep you for all time

At least no suffering remains
Never saw it for what it was
A blessing in disguise
At least now confidence remains
Saved your body from its torture
A better place in store

Now moving on
And letting go of regret
Centering on all the lessons
I had been taught 
Applying them to life
To future endeavors 
Along with every step
That is taken

You'll live forever
Through your grace
Through your memory
There you will always remain
