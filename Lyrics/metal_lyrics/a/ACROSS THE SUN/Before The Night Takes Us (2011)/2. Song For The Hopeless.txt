Today's a day for retribution
This all ends here
Now is the time to commit to the changes
That are needed to survive

Look around and see what's missing
Nothing's as it used to be
Smoldering beneath the wreckage
Of a life of atrocity

Faced with the choice of fighting
For lost sense of worth
Or conceding to failure
Accepting the fate of the world created

Must hardships prevail
Over strength of will
Can virtue be found
When all seems lost

There is hope begging to flourish
Should the right words be spoken

[chorus]
Embrace the ones who love
Don't turn and walk away
Salvation lies within
If the heart is open

Only shadows await for those who
Forfeit the right to break free

All have lost their way
Lost sight of reality
It's hope you cope 
That speaks to ones true self
