From it's origin
The bond we set
Seemed never failing
Yet paralleled truths
Would shadow my dreams
With a dormant evil unrestrained

Still trusting nature
Will allow the signs
To be ignored
Never will I falter
This way again

For my will eradicates
Treacherous fallacy
Fate beckons the reaping
Of your alienation

These broken words
Leave shattered hearts
Unmask this trite facade
Triggering loathsome rage
Unforgiving karmic malice

Farewell the favored
The loss is your own
Remember this presage
Losing self is much like being dead

So now this bond is banished
As infinite as time itself
Never again shall it mend
And this farewell is welcome
