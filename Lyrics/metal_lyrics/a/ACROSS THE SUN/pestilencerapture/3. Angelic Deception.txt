Whisper softly in the dead of night
Conspire against yourself
Every selfish act and thought
Comes back with no remorse

Incarcerate the one
Blind with jealous rage
Invoking wrath upon
What now remains

Lay down your weapons
Become yourself once more
Waken, realize, release your mind

Weak willed fall far behind
Sometimes all that's needed
One last push
Straight over the edge

So now the story
Has changed course
What once meant the world
Is now nothing more
Than a fading memory
A vicious facade unveiled

You long to squander
Strength that has been bestowed
Upon the life
That has now become
A lifeless shell
A fossil, preserved in memory
Forever projecting deception
A place only evil resides

The strife endured
You can't leave behind
Your hardships, they become my own
Weighed down by instability
All is now lost

No comfort lies
When the flames have died below
Still I rest in solace
Knowing that all was done to warn
I will not lose myself
In all this drama

Swiftly comes resentment
Burning through no threshold
The realization
Of relentless destruction
Will be found
Only then the true price
Shall be paid
