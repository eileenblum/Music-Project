Since infancy a void
Has plagued my existence
Attempts to disregard such anguish
Only magnified the hollowness

So many years
Have came and went
Without a single trace of you
This half a man, with half my heart
Who I've been searching for
Since I could walk

And still I hold on
To faith that we shall meet again
I'll stay forever strong
Until the day I find
Where I belong

This broken child
Collapses forth
In desperation
Come in, make this life complete
And stay forever more

The memory of you now

Seems like fading moments
Passing by
Like senseless dreams
That beg to wake me
From my comatose reality

Disposed of precious love
As though none was ever needed
Addiction over blood
The time has come to rectify
What you have done

This passage is the fruition
Of a life confession through song
Reaching out, holding on to the hope
That you will make me whole
