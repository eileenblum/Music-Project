Since the dawn of creation
Mankind has been hexed
Constantly torn by forces
Beyond comprehension
The endless struggle
Of pestilence and rapture

They will be heaven sent
Or hell bound
Each with equal intention

Bribing the subconscious
Waging war for control
Manipulation their ambition

From the womb we are mere targets
For earthly free radicals
Shifting shape as they see fit
To compensate for no escape

Steadfast with your convictions
Seek out that which brings obliteration
Utilize each with positive force
A Taoist approach will mean harmony

Now among the enlightened
Rising above
Regardless of the challenge
Transitions with ease
What once destroyed the spirit
Is of no consequence

Falling back to the point
Of no return
Deceivingly simple
Focus, restrain the weakness
You have found a higher power

Pestilence and rapture
Battles within us
Seeking to destroy
The choice must be made now
