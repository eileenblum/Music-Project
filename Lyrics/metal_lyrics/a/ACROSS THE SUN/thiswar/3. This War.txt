We will survive this war
Love and hate in limbo
With myself
Cant take in stride the old ways
Cycled through as new ways to die
Changing strong willed intellect
In to flocks of mindless drones
Taking all but whats been programmed

Its time
Its time to rise in opposition
This recession is getting old
For too long
Stood by and watched life burn
This conversation goes one way
Hear me now

Engage death on my soul
To rain mercy on you
Exalted leaders become our crutch
For power and strength

We all must fall to the remnant
Of what was lost we long for
Wait for me my love
Wait forever more
We all follow exalted leaders
Lead us away from heaven
Wait for me my love
Give me strength once more

We are weakening
Exalted leaders become our crutch
Engage death on my soul
To rain mercy on you

One more time
I see it every day
Take control
Supplement our ways

Wait for me love
Wait for me every day
Give me strength
To move on

Engage death on my soul
To rain mercy on you
