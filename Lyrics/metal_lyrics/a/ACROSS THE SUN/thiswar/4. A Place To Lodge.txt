They say to err is human
And to forgive is divine
What if man fancies
And does himself enshrine

Take care in where you
Make your bed
Take care in where you
Lay your head
Wolves conspire and scheme
They dance in sheep's wool
And admire deceitful dreams
From which truth they cull

A smile complete with dimples
All make for good show
Grins hold a value of dual intent
John Q waves back
With apprehension in tow
Breathe deep and accept
Every sin has a scent

The taller the building
The taller the shade
Ticker tape parades
Help ideals degrade

You contribute yourself
To an unholy alliance.
Against the author of ages
Armed with requisite defiance.
So its true that sheep know the sound
Of their own Shepard's voice.
And even when far can be
Found if be their choice.

Remember the from the fiery furnace
The righteous were delivered un-singed.
And in to that furnace went
The wicked serpent led.

You call yourselves free
But the cost is your
Immortal soul
You call yourselves free
Have your hearts turned to coal?

Out of the blue
Atop their head
Dipped in red
Boast of the dead
Such high degrees scorch
Its got too hot to stay
Writhing flame tongues torch
To soften and mold clay

Remember that from the fiery furnace
The righteous were delivered un-singed.
And in to that furnace went
The wicked serpent led.
When righteous fury came unhinged

You call yourselves free
So define for me this freedom
I pray that you see
That its only fabricated freedom
Free from nothing

The taller the building
The taller the shade
Ticker tape parades
Help ideals degrade
The taller the building
The taller the shade
We will all turn our heads
If were well paid

Participants within
Away you must steer
Writhing flame tongues torch
To soften and mold stairs
To the firmament
