Boiling water scorch my head
Falsely convinced I am dead
Forcing forth a watery grave
Breathing none no safe haven
No safe haven for me
Asinine tribulations
Dramatize stipulations
Contrary accusations
Asinine tribulations

Concaved reality lingers on
Hastening bloodstained heart
Once friendly touch turned fierce
Betrayed again falling apart

We rise and fall
We will live forever more

No matter the trails
No matter the tribulations
You must push through the pain
There is no pain
There is no sorrow

There is no
Asinine tribulations
Dramatize stipulations
Contrary accusations
Asinine tribulations

Concaved reality is no more
Hastened blood-safe heart
Once fierce touch
Is now forever more
Only loves touch
