We have suffered for too long
And waited for the right time
Waited on a long road
To sacrifice the demons
Raised by all the lies, conformed
Led by blinding truth we deny

Awakened now realizations had
(Awakened)
Breathing life in to the things we have shared
(Share our lives)
Binding our lives finding brotherhood
Gaining the strength to do the things we never could

We have suffered for too long
And waited for the right time

How far can this go
How ling will it last
Infinitesimally will it always breathe
Inside our lungs

Waited on a long road
To sacrifice the demons
Raised by all the lies, conformed
Led by blinding truth we embrace

Seeking now for the ways to evolve
(We must grow)
Continuing on the path thats been
Laid before us
Striving for greatness severing ties
With our enemies
Focusing now on the ways to start
A new beginning 

We have suffered for too long
