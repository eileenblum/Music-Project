We have all been built to evolve,
Nothing else but simple progress, 
We are looking for questions to solve,
Answers crumbled beneath this mess,
A man tries to speak of what he has found, 
But the others work to silence his voice, 
Discovery neglect,
Their violent words pierce the skin like a sword, 
Bleeding out the hope he had for a simple reward,
Discovery neglect,
Now he lies beaten across the floor,
Forced to leave his discovery ignored,
Brick by brick it will always confine us,
Look past this, they don't design us,
Move forward to leave the past behind us,
Into the future you'll find us
