Stuck in a dream world
Wake up, wake up I still scream
Constantly in this spiral
I sleep trapped within this dream
As I stand in this vivid slumber
I can feel the textures of my mind
Become surrounded by floating patterns
Made up by weaving lines
In between these orbs of matter
I think Iâve lost my mind
But Iâll venture through this desert
With my eyes open wide
What is this place?
Things look so familiar
In this vivid shade of grey
Is there another way?
To see this place more clearly
Before my mind starts to decay
Have I any other way?
Wake me up
I think Iâve lost my mind
But Iâll venture through this desert
With my eyes open wide
What is this place?
