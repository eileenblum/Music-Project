Stop looking down
At your hands against the ground
Push yourself up and tilt your head
Up towards the sun ahead
This is not the first time
That your dreams feel confined
Donât let the flames turn to embers
Push yourself up and remember
Youâve been waiting for so long
Patiently for your calling
I am the floating whisper
Flowing within your mind
Sometimes I feel so far gone
As time runs so thin
The clockwork is rusted
Sometimes itâs so far gone
And you lose your own direction
As time creeps slowly
Dreams lack attention
Nothing compares
I am the floating whisper
Flowing within your mind
I seek whatâs inside
For what makes your stars align
I am the one that you call bliss
