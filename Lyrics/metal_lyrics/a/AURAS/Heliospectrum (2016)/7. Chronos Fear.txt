Our world's been shaken and tossed upside down
Gravity pulls our weight against the ground
Inside these glass walls we are contained
Inside these glass walls
Hourglass
In this hourglass
Here within the hourglass
Collected and controlled as grains of sand
Slowly shifting as the time flies and passes by
Here within this hourglass
Collected and controlled as grains of sand
We watch our world slip from our hands
Here within the hourglass
Collected and controlled as grains of sand
Slowly shifting as the time flies and passes by
Hourglass
In this hourglass
Can we feel the ground beneath us sinking?
Constantly moving into a new state
The world we know is not the same
Hourglass
