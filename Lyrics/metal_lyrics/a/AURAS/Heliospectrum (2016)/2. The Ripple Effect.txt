I won't stop,
I will thrive,
My heart pulses,
To feel alive,
I can feel my heartbeat,
Ripple right through my chest,
Every time I grasp out of my reach,
With the endless time I invest,
In myself to finally feel complete,
Because my life is a personal test,
I'm constantly our to seek,
A challenge that bleeds out my best,
Challenge that bleeds out my best,
Every drop of sweat down my cheek,
Straining gasp of air to my lungs,
Every drop of blood makes me stronger,
I'm in it for the chase,
Not a reward to be given,
It's not a race,
But what keeps me in rhythm,
To drive through obstacles I face,
As long as I have my vision,
I won't stop, 
I will thrive,
My heart pulses,
To feel alive,
I'm constantly out to seek, 
A challenge that bleeds out my best
