This is my dream
For my eyes only to see
My vision is so clear up in these clouds
Painted with colors that speak to me
There's no darkness that can be found
Just limitless bliss to infinity
The sounds are so bright
Piercing waveforms are so alturing
These lights are held in constant flight
In the sky my mind's aspiring
There is a vivid place
Every time I close my eyes
Stars align within this space
My vision echoes to redefine
This is my dream
For my eyes only to see
There is a vivid place
Every time I close my eyes
Stars align within this space
My voice echoes to redefine
