Missing the days when your art flew like a kite
You continue to indulge yourself with what they call life
Hanging your dreams over a wishing well
Weighing yourself with so much more to gain
While losing the sight of the goals that you use to aim
As you draw the lines across the debts you've caused
You start to see the lack of passion and its flaws
Do you feel alive?
Are you feeling alive?
With your life and the path you choose
Time is running out as you pay your dues
Only to do nothing
You have the ability to give something more
Do you feel alive?
Are you feeling alive?
Do you ever wonder why you're stuck inside?
Do you feel alive (do you feel alive?)
Time is running out
You watch the days slowly pass you by you can't deny
You don't feel alive
As the seasons pass you look through the glass you will see yourself
Now you are alive
Step onto the grass you will see your path you will be yourself
Now you are alive
Do you even wonder why you're stuck inside
Do you feel alive? (do you feel alive?)
Time is running out
You watch the days slowly pass you by you cant deny
You don't feel alive.
