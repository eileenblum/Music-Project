Are you feeling the pressure?
Trust your instinctual perspective,
Sense these surroundings,
Look past the playwright's plague,
And the ones it aims to infect,
Sense the darkness surrounding you,
Clouding your abilities,
To see, to feel, to change,
Your perspective consciously,
Become the inspiration,
And sense your surroundings,
Become the inspiration,
Can you feel it?
Block out the signals,
Keep them out of your mind,
Don't let them plant the seeds of fear,
To send chills down your spine,
Dancing like a puppet,
With no visible strings attached,
They'll use it to pull you in,
Subconsciously to secretly distract,
From the artifice,
I know you feel them, 
Block out the signals,
Keep them out of your mind
