We're all here searching ourselves
To find our niches within this world
So how do we still feel shapeless?
Where do we even belong?
Why do we feel shapeless?
Where do we belong?
Where do I fit in this puzzle?
So many pieces left
I'm lost within this struggle
Confused with every breath
Like lost children in a tunnel
Crawling from the darkness
To get me out from this hole
We are all here searching ourselves
To find our niches within this world
My chest is shapeless and vacant
Yet my heart feels so heavy
I feel my dreams have awakened
Yet my mind, it feels so empty
Where do I fit in this puzzle?
So many pieces left
I'm lost within this struggle
Confused with every breath
Like lost children in a tunnel
Crawling from the darkness
To get me out from this hole
We are all lost.
