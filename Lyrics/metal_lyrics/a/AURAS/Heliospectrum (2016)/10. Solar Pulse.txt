There is a man at the edge of the earth
Sees a wall standing tall leaving him in question
Tracing back to the meaning of birth
Wondering if there lies a clear connection
Hesitant to proceed, he touches the wall
Confused to feel a texture beyond sensation
As he pushes more the wall begins to fall
Revealing to him his life's next equation
We have all been built to evolve
Nothing else but simple progress
We are the questions to solve
Answers crumbled beneath this mess
There is a man at the edge of the earth
Sees a wall standing tall leaving him in question
Tracing back to the meaning of birth
Wondering if there lies a clear connection
Hesitant to proceed, he touches the wall
Confused to feel a texture beyond sensation
As he pushes more the wall begins to fall
As the bricks crash into the ground
Others turn attracted to the sound
The man tries to speak of what he found
But they speak louder now
Brick by brick it will always confine us
Look past them they don't design us
Discovery neglected
Move forward to leave the past behind us
Into the future you'll find us
