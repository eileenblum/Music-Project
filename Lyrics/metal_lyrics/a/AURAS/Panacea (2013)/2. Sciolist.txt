Thoughts of your philosophy
Reflect a vague reality
You have been grasping for, grasping for
Blinded by the ego thatâs compelled you
Youâll never recognize the absence of your doubt
Displace the possession of your prejudgments

Youâre provoking the conflicts that bind us
Regressing further away
Peer back, back at the choices youâve made
Reveal omissions, engage the aspects left behind
Left behind

So, the lucrative stories are what you have sold
Your schemes will no longer persuade

Frail words are not withstanding
This congregation isnât gullible

Broke out into commonality
With intentions of preeminence
That never meant more to me

Searching far and wide
For some sort of reason
To believe in your own superficial knowledge
Your judgmentâs clouded by the anger that you create

Your words mean nothing
Just a waste of breath
Breathe in, breathe in
Itâs all you have left
