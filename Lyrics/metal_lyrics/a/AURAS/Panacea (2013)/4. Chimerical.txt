So look beyond the mirror because
All you see is yourself
And this reign of tyranny
Ends now, right before us
No longer controlled, in this world

This is what our ancestors devised (devised)
Beyond their narrow perspectives
Could they envision a place
Something like this world
Weâre all on the same page

Could they envision a place
Something like this world
That we have now (that we have now)
A place to prosper, free to grow
Donât fear this change

They preach irrational tales of hope
Lacking basis
So bury it (bury it)
So we can find a place we call home
And the world will create new order
Those who felt like worthless organisms
Have finally found their abode

This could be your own demise
That you have set for yourself
This could be your own demise

Breathe in, the water is rising up
Drown in your slavery to the unknown being

Those who breach the bounds
Exceeds their knowledge
Have no place left to stand
No place left to stand
