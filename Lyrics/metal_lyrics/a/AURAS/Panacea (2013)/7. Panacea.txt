We move ever closer
As moments elapse, pass away
Optimistic vision precedes this shift
Configure the complex
Incessant struggle will finally fade
Interrupted by
Panacea ascending
On wings of empathy
Selfless paradigm

Have you ever taken a moment in time?
Peering through the lens of another
Another stance, differing angle
Enable yourself (enable yourself!)

Destroy this ego-driven culture of judgment
The instruments of change are now visible

Another stance (another stance)
Differing angle (angle)
Enable yourself
