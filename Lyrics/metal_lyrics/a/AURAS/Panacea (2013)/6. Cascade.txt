Open the flood gates
I will reveal the stage the masses have yet to see
The source of our progression
Notions of fallacy
Pollute the mindset of those who believe
Release our thoughts
This is my foundation
And it will leave you

Open your eyes to view the surroundings
Their words are so clear
Clearly contradicting
Clearly contradicting

So tell (now speak)
And tell me why are all these walls encasing us
Let us shatter their lies

Their words are fragile
About to break as we show them the way
Just take my hand
Just take my hand
You will be shown

So now you hold yourself against the weight of the world
When it caves in it will leave you breathless
So now you hold yourself against the weight of the world
When it caves in it will leave youâ¦
So now you hold yourself against the weight of the world
When it caves in it will leave you breathless

This is my foundation
And it will leave you breathless
