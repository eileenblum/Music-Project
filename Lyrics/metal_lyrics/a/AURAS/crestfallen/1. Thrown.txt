Monumental elation beyond words
Where dreams are a constant
I, in limitless euphoria, am surrounded
And without despair (without despair)
No time to dwell on uncertainty
Airy day in advance, in trance (in trance)
I foresaw, standing outside my ordinary self
Existing much greater value (greater value)
Comprised memories flow within my consciousness
Remembrance triggers iconic bliss
No expiration for what
I have preserved here
Iâm grounded, yet not weary
My conscience refuses to admit defeat
