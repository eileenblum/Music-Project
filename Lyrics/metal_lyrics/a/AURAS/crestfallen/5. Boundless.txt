Is this where
I'm staged?
Reduced to the central core of my failures
It's weighing me down
Every time
I find myself towards a newer light (newer light)
It constantly leaves the room dimmer
As it fades in a realm of disappointment
Where
I am as certain of my dark misjudgments
I am heavily shifting the angle towards myself (myself)
Ripples through my heart
Bottomless collapsing pressure on my shoulders
Revealing my down casted, weightless self
Weightless (weightless)
In a collapsing cycle within my own lucidness
I am found defeated and beaten
I am heated, yet weakened
As my disallowance creeps within me
Within me, more than a man
Once spoken to be limitless to one's self
Unbounded from the disappointment
I won't let this anger me further
To bring forth my potential
My potential,
I have been unbounded
Finally limitless
This is my stage
To erase all failures that weakened my soul
Lift me upward
Towards the mountains so
I can see the clouds
To bring forth my potential
Within me, more than a man
Once spoken to be limitless to one's self
Unbounded from the disappointment
I won't let this anger me further
To bring forth my potential
