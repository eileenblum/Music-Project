Living under conditions; course of a nation,
Sewn into a complex pattern.

We all are misguided puppets bound in a design.
Crafted; Corruption.
Our human elegance, deprived with disease.
Consumed free will.

Refusal to relinquish our logic,
Preserves our enlightenment.
Pathetic bliss.

Constantly progress and to recur.
Unfold the concealed; structured disregard.

It's been seen; a figured integral that manipulates humility.
Counterfeit fed to the mouth of the innocent.
Our hearts remain floored,
They watch us yield affirming our remedy.
Revealing to us, deceptive hypocrites.

Your efforts are exposed.
The answers are clear through defined anomalies.
Spill paints a portrait, leaks to bear your true colors; fraudulence.

Constantly progress and to recur.
Induced fear and distress left astray; left astray.
