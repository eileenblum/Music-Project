We are not invincible beneath the skin
Death is born when your story begins
We are not invincible beneath the skin
Death is born when your story begins

It's when you realize
Fragments of life
Shatter before your eyes
Time was water turned to dry
As the moments fall behind

Give me a reason not to cry
Because my life has passed me by
Watch my tears start to dry
And take me to the other side
Where space is not confined

Where the concept of time is redefined
And where the relief of pain
Consumes my mind
It consumes my entire mind

We are not invincible beneath the skin
Death is born when your story begins
We are not invincible beneath the skin
Death is born when your story begins
