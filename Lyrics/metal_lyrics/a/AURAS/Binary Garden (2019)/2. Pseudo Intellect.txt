We are frayed in arrays of dishonesty
Pull the trigger
To the truth
Realizing everything isn't the same
Isn't the same

Tear it down into pieces
Make them unable to build it up again
Go vacant; evict them
Let me breathe in the emptiness

We are frayed in arrays of dishonesty
Pull the trigger
To the truth
Realizing everything isn't the same

I am dishonored
I am dishonored

So let them know
I control the truth
I won't believe your lies
So let them know
I control the truth
I won't believe your lies
Believe your lies
