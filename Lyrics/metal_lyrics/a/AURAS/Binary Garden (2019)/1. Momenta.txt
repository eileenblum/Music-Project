As we look in the mirror
We gaze upon a concrete path
We always seem to forget (forget)
A fragment of what we once were;
A child; a portrait
Painted by the ones that held us close
And sheltered us from failure

We are thankful subtly
But a little too speechless
We're always looking forward
Leaving our words behind
And shelter us from failure

We never had a chance to speak our mind
To tell you how we've felt
Out of sight, out of mind
And as we're leaving our words behind
We never had a chance to speak our mind
Out of sight, out of mind

Silent disregard
As they feel the distance
And see our course (and see our course)
Fade away
Silent disregard
As they feel the distance
And see our course

We never had a chance to speak our mind
To tell you how we've felt
Out of sight, out of mind
And as we're leaving our words behind
We never had a chance to speak our mind
Out of sight, out of mind
To tell you how we've felt
We never had a chance to speak our mind
Out of sight, out of mind
