Crumbling stones on a flimsy pedestal
Feeling the wave of surrounding perceptions
A hollow life composed of falsifying hope (hope)

Slowly leveling into the water
Stripping away everything that I have sculpted
Nothing is left but ground zero in my sights (in my sights)
Time feels so bare as the water starts to rise (starts to rise)
Overflowing my mind
Overflowing my mind with doubt
Crumble the heart of a statue
Crumble the heart

Save me from all the pressure
It haunts me as the time makes its way
To the finite end of this
Get it away from me
I've been so caught up with the attention
What has become of me
Bring it all to an end
Get it away from me now

Crumbling stones on a flimsy pedestal
Feeling the wave of surrounding perceptions
Crumble the heart of a statue
Crumble the heart
Crumble the heart of a statue

A hollow life composed of falsifying hope

Won't you save me from all the pressure
It haunts me as the time makes its way
To the finite end of this
Get it away from me
I've been so caught up with the attention
What has become of me
Bring it all to an end
Get it away from me now

Save me from all the pressure
It haunts me as the time makes its way
To the finite end of this
Get it away from me now

Crumble the heart of a statue

Crumbling stones on a flimsy pedestal
Feeling the wave of surrounding perceptions
A hollow life composed of falsifying hope (hope)
