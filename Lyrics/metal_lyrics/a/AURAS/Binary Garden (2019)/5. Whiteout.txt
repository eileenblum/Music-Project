They'll build these walls with empty powers (powers)
They'll fill our trust with empty promises (promises)

Windows of dust surrounds this room we live in
The doors locked shut as long as we could remember
They say we're saved from blindness
The room consumes as we stare
At these walls
Walls so big it barred us all

Shield your eyes from the light
And feel the wrath of gods (feel the wrath as it burns)
Feel the pain and suffering within
A room air-polluted; poisonous (poisonous)
Clouds of dust we breathe

We'll dig our ashes from the dirt
Digging up our memories
This room has burnt down
From the fire
Created by the ones who housed us

Windows of dust surrounds this room we live in
Room we live in

Shield your eyes from the light
And feel the wrath of gods (feel the wrath as it burns)
Feel the pain and suffering within
A room air-polluted; poisonous (poisonous)
Clouds of dust we breathe
