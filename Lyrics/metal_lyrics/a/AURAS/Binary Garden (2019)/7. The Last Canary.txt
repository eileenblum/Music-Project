Questions rippling across the floor
Watch the recurring patterns lift us off the ground
Suspect noises bury our drowned out voices

Whistle blower; the sound blows through the gates (through the gates)
Uneven narrative; we're so numb
Cracking the shell of an hourglass
Closing in (closing in) as time runs out
Artificial sand divides our vision; it divides us

Draining lives like a leveraged buyout
Running on borrowed time and casualties
We see them fade away in plain sight
In front of our eyes; will cry for those who tried
To seek refuge on the other side
Men will lie to keep us free from clarity
Free from our own minds

Save your tears for those who tried (who tried)
To see the other side
To seek refuge on other side
Eyes will cry and men will lie (will lie)
To keep us all born blind
Free us from our minds; reach the other side
Free us from our minds; reach the other side

Questions rippling across the floor
Watch the recurring patterns lift us off the ground
Suspect noises bury our drowned out voices

Drowned out voices
Do they hear us now

Save your tears for those who tried (who tried)
To see the other side
To seek refuge on other side
Eyes will cry and men will lie (will lie)
To keep us all born blind
Free us from our minds; reach the other side
Free us from our minds; reach the other side

Will they ever see the light
How are they moving forward (moving forward)
Our hearts feel so torn from the inside
Do they hear our cries
Do they ignore the suffering (suffering)
Our hearts are torn from the inside out

Whistle blower; the sound blows through the gates (through the gates)
Uneven narrative; we're so numb
