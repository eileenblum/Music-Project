See these eyes
Watch them close to cries
Watching humanity destabilize
We're on the threshold of do or die
What does this world have to justify
Bringing the world to your translucent lies
Embedded into a cold design
A cold design

Why are we so broken
Our home has spoken

Save us now we're drowning here; searching
Trying to find ourselves in time; lost and found
Others looking for steady ground
Are we one with a tree, high above this, tight tension abound

This never ending dream
We thought we wouldn't waste

Pick myself off of the ground
Anything that wakes me up
I can't stand the sight of this nightmare

What is the quality of life
Is this a dream we're wasting
Is this heavens replacement
Is this our world living in hell

This never ending dream
We thought we wouldn't waste
Is this our world living in hell
