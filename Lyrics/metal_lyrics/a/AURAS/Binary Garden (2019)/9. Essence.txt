Can't believe that you're not here in my arms here to stay
I held you so tightly
No escape from the pain
My mind filled with false blame

No escape from the pain
I'm the one to blame
Anything that can make
This better because

I'd sell my soul (sell my soul)
To spend one moment beside you again
I'm drowning slow (I'm drowning)
In this cloudy ocean

I felt the air leave
My lungs when they said
You were gone forever (gone forever)
I spent the time alone
Replaying the moment where
I said my goodbyes

Still no escape from the pain
Redirecting blame
Would my life be for trade
For your life, to have you stay
For your life
To have you say
Anything that can make this better because

I'd sell my soul (sell my soul)
To spend one moment beside you again
I'm drowning slow (I'm drowning)
In this cloudy ocean
