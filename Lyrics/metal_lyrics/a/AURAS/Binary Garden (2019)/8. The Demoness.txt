I see those devilish eyes with the halo tilted
With her personal endeavors
Brightest red stare pupils dilating
I wish I would've seen it coming alive
Back wielding a tail while medicating
Never looking up to god
But chemically meditating

Soul eater, it's a demon
Looking to tear apart, when it's fiending
Rip your heart out when it's feeding
Soul eater, its a demon (it's a demon)

Coming alive to tear your heart inside (tear your heart inside)
And swallow the ocean whole
Drown in the earths blood
Don't let ground flood
We are drowning
Drown in the earths blood
Don't let ground flood

I see those devilish eyes with the halo tilted
With her personal endeavors
Brightest red stare pupils dilating
I wish I would've seen it coming

Cracks your skull with a death stare
Serpent hair shed across the bed
She'll never sleep until she

Soul eater, its a demon
Looking to tear apart
Rip your heart out cold when its feeding
Soul eater, its a demon

Coming alive to tear your heart inside (tear your heart inside)
And swallow the ocean whole
Drown in the earths blood
Don't let ground flood

We are drowning
Drown in the earths blood
Don't let ground flood
