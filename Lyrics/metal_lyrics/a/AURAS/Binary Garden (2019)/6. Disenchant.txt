These leaves are falling from the hollow trees
One by one they float constantly (constantly)
Carried away by the cold breeze
Is this what we all wanted
Fading world on a digital gauntlet

In these wires we're knotted
With these leaves left forgotten
In due time
We'll all be confined (we'll be confined)

Cast away Mother Nature's name
And we can pretend to relate
Fade away leaving your heart in disarray (in disarray, disarray)

Why don't we throw away the earth while it decays
The machines are born here to stay
Single digits embedded into the soil
We'll be confined into the soil
We'll be confined (we'll be confined)

Cast away Mother Nature's name
And we can pretend to relate
Fade away leaving your heart in disarray (in disarray, disarray)

Cast away Mother Nature's name
In disarray
