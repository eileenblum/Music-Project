I knew the price and the price was high, they made us sleep with open eyes.
Keep on digging, keep on rowing, throwing knives like pirates.
I've been dreaming of us sinking.

The sound of whispers, the sound of screams, the sound of the broken who still have dreams.
They can hear us, they can see, they are the ones who never sleep.

No one can see it, no one can feel it.
Keep on digging, keep on rowing, throwing knives like pirates.
I've been dreaming of us sinking down with honor, down to our homes.

You will never defeat us.

The sound of whispers, the sound of screams, the sound of the broken who still have dreams.
They can hear us, they can see, they are the ones who never sleep.

I'm lost, I'm stuck, I'm freezing cold.
I'm stomping my feet on the ground just to keep myself alive.
Just to keep myself alive.I try to scream for help but nothing else but blood comes out.
I'm lost inside, I'm lost inside myself.

No one can stop us.Â
