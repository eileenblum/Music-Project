I swallow everything. I end lives.
I climb the air to the clouds, and burn my friends alive.
There is no path to the light, since I've darkened the sun.
I've filled the ocean with thousands and thousands of corpses.
And all the sinners are here with me, with their mouths full of sharpened teeth.

Hope; you will never reach me.
Love: you will never walk these grounds.
God does not exist here.
Not then, not now, not ever.

I've been carrying my dreams, way up high.
As I walked these stairs, I felt alive.
But no one else could see it, not then. not now. not ever.

Hope; you will never reach me.
Love; you will never walk these grounds.
God does not exist here.
Not then, Not now, Not ever.

I've been carrying my dreams, way up high.
As I walked these stairs, I felt alive.
But no one else could see it, no one else could see it.
There is not path to the light since I've darkened the sun.
I've filled the ocean with thousands of corpses

Hope; you will never reach me.
Love; you will never walk these grounds.
God does not exist here.
Not then, not now, not ever.
