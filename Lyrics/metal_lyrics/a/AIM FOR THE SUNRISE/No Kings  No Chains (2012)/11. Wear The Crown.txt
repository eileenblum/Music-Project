I hold the sky in my hands, I wear the crown.
Not even God can break me down, because I hold the sky tonight.

But if I would stray away.
I'd never let this go, this is the moment I need.
I still believe.
I hold the sky in my hands, I wear the crown.
No chains could ever hold me back.No kings could ever make me bow.

But if I would stray away.
I'd never let this go, this is the moment I need.

I hold the sky in my hands, I wear the crown.
