If I ever get knocked down, I'll always remember what we've been told to, we've been told to
To never underestimate how golden we are (We've been told to, we've been told to)

I know you're struggling with your dreams, so I'll leave a couple of hints.
Don't try to blow up bridges, make it or break it, go through everything.

With thoughts made of nothing, I search for the end.
With arms made of gold, I can't touch anything.
We've been told to, we've been told to never bow to the king that builds us a cage.

As we dive into this pit, we see nothing but envy, from the people that we used to know.
And all of your despair, along with all your doubts, we buried it all six feet down.

So now you've got your say, but my words will not break.
So show me what you're fighting for.
So show me what you got now.
Come on, show me what you got.

We've been told to, we've been told to never bow to the king that builds us a cage.
