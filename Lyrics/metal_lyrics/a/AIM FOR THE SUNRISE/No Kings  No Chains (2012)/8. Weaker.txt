So keep loading your guns.
Just break our hands and nail us up on that cross.
But we wont forget, we will hunt you down and break all your roadblocks.

And I will be a better man, I will step back from all this madness.

From where I stand, I see nothing but cages.
From where I stand, there's no chance I would let em'.
Falling backwards into a grave of fire.
These flames sets me free and from the ashes I breathe.
I burn like a phoenix.

These numbers drives me into a madman.

666 FUCK!Â 

I'm not getting weaker,Â 
I can't get any weaker from all these knives in my back.
I'm just getting stronger, oh I'm just getting stronger from all those fists in my head.

Falling backwards into a grave of fire.
These flames sets me free and from the ashes I breathe.
I burn like a phoenix.
