We raised the monuments, but you tore 'em down.
We marked the border, with our dead hands.
We built the bridges, on which you spat.

You sat and watched us fall deeper into this pit.
You sat and watched us get weaker.
Weak and innocence.
Don't waste your time on me, 'cause I'm already dead.
Don't waste your time on me, I'm already dead.

I am a dying breed, and you'll choke me out.
I crossed the border, while you grew weak from the light.

You sat and watched us fall deeper into this pit.
You sat and watched us get weaker.
Weak and innocence.

Don't waste your time on me, 'cause I'm already dead.
Don't waste your time on me, I'm already dead.

I will not be manipulated by the lady in red.
