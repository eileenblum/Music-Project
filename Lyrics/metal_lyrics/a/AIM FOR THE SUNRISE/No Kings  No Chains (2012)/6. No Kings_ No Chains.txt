For every home they broke, for all the faces I've worn.
For our search for hope, and every light that is born.
They tore down the sky, and fed us with nails.
We saw truth in their lies, but their ambitions will fail.

We can't suffer from loss without conquering the rain.

Oh, God what have you done, to this world we call our home?
We're so alone, we're so alone in this world we call our home.
I have tasted his crown, it reeks of disgust.
It won't make me bow, no son of mine will rise.
But I would give my life to see their demise.

Oh, God what have you done, to this world we call our home?
We're so alone, we're so alone in this world we call our home.

We can't suffer from loss without conquering the rain.

I will ban all our kings and break all our chains.
We can't suffer from loss without conquering rain.

Oh, God what have you done, to this world we call our home?
We're so alone, we're so alone in this world we call our home.
