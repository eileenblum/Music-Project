Exhausted we came, exhausted we go.
Struggled against a superior enemy.
Our
Similar talent in different species.
A bunch of wretch make demands.
Like
Death, this gave no defence.
Swallow your last spittle with fear.
Because
This is going to hurt.

This is why we're searching
For pleasure in
Misery
This is why we're searching for pleasure in misery
Cure the
Emptiness.
He has all you need in his treasury

Oh!

Block your brain from useless
Thinking.
Fight against the disease of weakness.

A white pigeon passed your left ear.

Everything is waking and as
We watch those secrets fade away
Everybody needs a perfect failure.
This burning progress will decay

Exhausted we came, exhausted we go.
Struggled against a superior enemy.
Our similar talent in different species.
