Are you ready now?
Go ahead, take a shot, and make em' burn!
Are you ready now?
Go ahead, take a soot, and make em' burn!

Tearing down, your blue skies,
I can not go on, my lungs will collapse,
They will collapse!

Come on man and stop the lies,
Take a chance and roll the dice, [4x]

Get a grip I want you to stop!

How many times will I let this slip through my fingers?
For far to long I've been waiting for your grace.

Salvation to the lies,
To fucked up for our eyes [4x]

Let this be a proof of madness,
To establish your selfishness.
I'll step back, I'll step back and watch you burn,
Burn in the last walk,
The last walk from here, burn, this walk can get lonely!

How many times will I let this slip through my fingers?
For far to long I've been waiting for your grace.
