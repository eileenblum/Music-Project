We're pretending like we're all alone,
But if we truly are,
Establish this honor.
Walk home with a smile.
Establish this honor.
Try to be the man you want.
The universe, the never ending creation.
The humans, the dying generation.
I think he messed up the wires, oh.

But as long as we believe.
We won't be forgotten.
As long as we believe

We can fight this disease.
The giant hands embrace the sky.
And like they said we can survive.

This rumour we have built.
Love, honour and of peace.
Who said, we can live forever?

I collect the signs as they fall from heaven,
As the leader sets the rules.
The machine turns on.
As the leader sets the rules.
The participants will take the consequences, oh.

If we don't we'll show up, I am gone, I am gone
You will watch those burning books turn to ashes,
They had so wrong, they had so wrong

But as long as we believe.
We won't be forgotten.
As long as we believe

As long as we believe
Your grace will lead the way to liberation

Since the day you left the earth, the stars have never shined brighter.

As time stands still,
We will divide your soul, and let the wind carry you away.
