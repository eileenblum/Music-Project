We stare at the sun, until it blinds us.
No room for responsibility,
We're
Too busy buying lies.

And this claustrophobia will
Choke us, every time we
Try.
I've developed a fear for
Everything, a fear for openness.

I slowly
Start to hope.

As the sky turns red,
As the snow melts in our hands
Your
Tears will lead us in,
And keep us warm and safe again [2x]

And I will leave you
With just a word,
A word that literally describes everything
