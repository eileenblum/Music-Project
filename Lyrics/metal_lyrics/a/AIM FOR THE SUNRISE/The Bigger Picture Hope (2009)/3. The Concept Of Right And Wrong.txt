I've been able to hold it all together, because there was a light at the end of the tunnel.
A life, for all of us.
And now what have I got?
And we will keep
On floating, as long as it takes for the message to sink in.
Keep on floating,
As long as it takes.

Find your way back to grace, and to us!
Find your way
Back to grace, I haven't given up on you yet.

We can't take another step,
We're blinded by rage.
We've given into the weakness, anticipation is choking us.

The walls are closing in,
Don't swear to God,
Swear to me!
The sky is
Clearing up
Don't swear to God
Swear to me
The sun will rise
The sun will
Rise again.

Find your way back to grace, and to us!
Find your way back to grace,
I haven't given up on you yet.

Maybe dangerous to choose the way, I
Rather live than die today
And if the wind invites the rain, the rain invites the cold.
And if the cold invites the snow, we're freezing out of time.

[2x]
Climb
This mountain that ruined your life

Can I get an amen?
From all the lost
Souls in the crowd.
I know what you're afraid of
Take a picture and frame it
Up on the wall, show all your friends how bad you are.
Why do we fall?
