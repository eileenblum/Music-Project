Well, in this life I've seen everything I can see woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air hand in hand
I've seen babies dancing in the midnight sand

And I've seen dreams that come from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men cryin' at their own grave sites
And I've seen pigs all sittin' watchin' picture slides
But I..
Ain't never seen nothin' like you

Do ya, do ya, want my love
Woman
Do ya, do ya, want my face
I need it
Do ya, do ya, want my mind
I'm saying
Do ya, do ya want my LOVE

Well, I've heard the crowd singin' outta tune
As they sat and sang Auld Lang Syne
By the light of the moon

And I heard preachers bangin' on their drums
Rat-tat-tat
And I've heard police playing with their guns
But I..
Ain't never heard nothin' like YOU!

In the country
Where the sky touches down on the field
She lay her down to rest
In the morning sun

They come a runnin' just to get a look
Just to feel, to touch, her long black hair
They don't give a damn
Cause I..
Ain't never seen nothin' like YOU!

Well, I think you know what I'm tryin' to say
Woman
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day

I've seen a 'nuff of this world to know
That I've got to, got to, get it all
Get it all to grow

Now, do ya, do ya, want my love
Woman
Do ya, do ya, want my face
I need it
Do ya, do ya, want my mind
I'm saying
Now, do ya, do ya, want
The ACE

C'mon and tell me!

Do ya, do ya, want my LOVE
Do ya, do ya, want my LOVE
Oh, YEAH!!!
