Well, I'm staring down from Venus in the dead of night
My mind is flashin' back to when the world was right
Your guns and bombs keep rolling off the assembly line
And people keep on starvin' and you think that's just fine

With my head in the clouds it's easy to see
We better live together peacefully
You know the world is still your family tree

So keep it straight... Remember Me
It's not too late... Remember Me

Well I'm floatin' and spinnin' and flyin'
Above the Earth's atmosphere
And I've got a few things to say
You may not wanna hear

Now there's just enough time to repair it
As long as you don't let it get you down
But there's not a whole lot you can do for yourself
When you're buried underground

There's so much yellin' an screamin'
And lyin' and cheatin' and robbin' and preachin'
That we've heard it all

We need some lovin' and carin'
And kissin' and huggin'
And helpin' each other
Or we're gonna fall
And that'll be all
Remember Me!
Remember Me! Remember Me!
Remember Me... Thank You, Good Night! We LOVE YOU!! Rock N Roll!!
