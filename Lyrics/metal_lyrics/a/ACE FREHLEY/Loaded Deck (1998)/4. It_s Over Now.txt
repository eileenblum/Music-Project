You were life and love upon this island
And it was hard but you made it all worthwhile
So afraid that I'm gonna run away
Well, if I was, I wouldn't be here today
And you took me by the heart
And showed me where I was
Deep inside your love

You will never hear me say the words
Never feel the pain that hurts
Never hear me say, It's over now

I look at you, and see that there's a fear
Something's wrong but your holdin' back your tears
Well here is where I am and where I'll stay
So lose the bad thoughts, push 'em far away-ay

Hope and dreams will take the shape
I'm shooting for the stars
And diamonds for your eyes
