[Ace Frehley]

When I wake they're always there
Waiting just to freely please me
While I wash they're occupied
cleaning things so sweetly neatly
When I play they play with me
Willing to do anything

[CHORUS:]
I live me dolls
You must believe me
It's plain to see, they really love me
I love my dolls,
they'll never leave me happily
While I sleep they keep me warm
Nestled right beside me, tightly
As I eat they wait on me
Making sure I'm satisfied

[CHORUS]

[BRIDGE:]
When friends come over they're astonished by the sight
So many dolls in just one place gives them a fright
Don't understand what makes them so uncomfortable...
Around my dolls

[CHORUS]
