[Verse]
There's something movin' in the air tonight
There's something movin' at the speed of light
And it's calling, calling, calling to you
I got a feeling running through my veins
We may never get this chance again and
It's calling, calling, calling to you, yeah!
Some can't understand, and they'll only go so far
It all depends on you, to fight for what you are

[Chorus X2]
Strike the drums
Stand up and shout
It's only rock and roll
It's what we're all about

[Verse]
There's a feeling from inside your soul
There's a message in the rock and roll
And it's calling, calling, calling to you, yeah!
No easy going, no compromise
You know the rhythm's got you hypnotized
And it's calling, calling, calling to you, yeah!

Some can't understand, and they'll only go so far
It all depends on you, to fight for what you are

[Chorus X2]

I'm calling out to you, oh
I'm calling out to you
Calling out to me

[Solo]

[Chorus X4]
