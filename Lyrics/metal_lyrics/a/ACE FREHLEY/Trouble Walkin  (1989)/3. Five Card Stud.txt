I was born the son of a car shark with a deck in my hand
I'm the best at playin' the game I'm known throughout the land
At the tables you'll find me a stack of chips by my side
Poker gin or twenty nine a winnin' hand is my pride
Just cut the pack I'll take the one eyed jack
There's no holdin' back I call your bluff
It ain't no crime winnin' all the time the money's on the line
I play for blood I'm the five card stud
Don't try to con me let's get it understood
You'll never put one past me 'cause I know every trick in the book
Let's play for double or nothin' if you think you're so good
Let's go for broke afraid you're gonna choke
You got one slim hope that ain't enough ha ha ha ha
Well you're outta luck and lost your bottom buck
I hit a royal flush and I smell blood I'm the five card stud
Let's go for broke afraid you're gonna choke
You got one slim hope that ain't enough
'cause I'm the five card stud I'm the five card stud come on
