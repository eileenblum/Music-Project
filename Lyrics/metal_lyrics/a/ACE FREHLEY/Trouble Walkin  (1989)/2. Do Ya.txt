Well in this life I've seen everything I can see woman
I've seen lovers flying through the air hand in hand
I've seen babies dancin' in the midnight sand
And I've seen dreams come from the heavenly skies above
I've seen old men cryin' at their own grave sites
I've seen pigs all sittin' watchin' pictures slides
But I ain't never seen nothin' like you
Do you do you want my love woman
Do you do you want my face I need it
Do you do you want my mind I'm sayin' do you do you want my love
Well I've heard the crowd singin' outta tune
As they sang sang laud lang syne by the light of the moon
And I heard preachers bangin' on their drums oh ra ta ta ra
And I heard police playin' with their guns
But I ain't never hear nothing like you
In the country where the sky touches
Down on the fields she lay her down to rest in the morning sun
They come a runnin' just to get a look
Just to feel to touch her long black hair
They don't give a damn 'cause I ain't never seen nothin' like you
Do you do you want my love woman
Do you do you want my face I need it
Do you do you want my mind I'm sayin' do you do you want my love
Come on well I think you know what I'm tryin' to say woman
That is I'd like to save you for a rainy day
I've seen enough of this world to know
That I've gotta got to get it all get it all to grow on ya
Do you do you want my love woman
Do you do you want my face I need it
Do you do you want my mind I'm sayin'
Do you do you want the Ace
Come on and tell me do you do you want my love
Do you do you want my love oh yeah
