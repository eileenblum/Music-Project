Well I'm starin' down from Venus in the dead of night
My mind is flashin' back to when the world was right
Your guns and bombs keep rolling off the assembly line
And people keep on starvin' and you think that's just fine
With my head in the clouds it's easy to see
You better live together peacefully
You know the world is still your family tree
So keep it straight remember me it's not too late remember me
Well I'm floatin' and spinnin' and flyin' above the earth's atmosphere
And I've got a few things to say that you may not wanna hear
Now there's just enough time to repair it
As long as you don't let it get you down
But there's not a whole lot you can do for yourself
When you're buried underground
With my head in the clouds it's easy to see
You better live together peacefully
You know the world is still your family tree
So keep it straight remember me it's not too late remember me
There's so much yellin' an screamin' and lyin' and cheatin'
And robbin' and preachin' that we've heard it all yeah
We need some lovin' and carin' and kissin' and huggin'
And helpin' each other or we're gonna fall
And that'll be all remember me
With my head in the clouds it's easy to see
You better live together peacefully
You know the world is still your family tree
So keep it straight remember me it's not too late remember me
Just keep it straight remember me it's not too late remember me
Remember me come on remember me yeah yeah
Remember me ooh oh remember me yeah
