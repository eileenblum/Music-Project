Johnny saw her ridin' on a street car named desire
His fate was sealed she could see him comin'
Like a hundred other liars it was no big deal
Rosa had a lover on the shady side of town
He was king of the streets she was his possession
Like a jewel on his crown Johnny better run better run
Better hide your heart better hold on tight
Say your prayers 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart 'cause you're playin' with fire
Ah ha ha ah hey hey hey ah to do too do do to do to
Ah ha ha ah hey hey hey ah to do too do do to do to
The ride was over but the story doesn't end
He took her heart she looked him in the eye
And said they couldn't meet again you could see the trouble start
The word went out that Rosa's messin' with someone
It was on the street Tito looked for Johnny
With a vengeance and a gun Johnny better run better run
Better hide your heart better hold on tight
Say your prayers 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart 'cause you're playin' with fire
Ah ha ha ah hey hey hey ah to do too do do to do to
Ah ha ha ah hey hey hey ah to do too do do to do to
Johnny's holdin' Rosa on a rooftop in the night as time stood still
They couldn't hear him comin' til he had them both in sight
You could feel a chill ooh a shot ran out like thunder
And the blood was on her hands with nothing won
When someone has to die you know they finally understand
Better hide your heart better hold on tight
Say your prayers 'cause there's trouble tonight
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart 'cause you're playin' with fire
Ah ha ha ah hey hey hey ah to do too do do to do to
When pride and love battle with desire
Better hide your heart 'cause you're playin' with fire
Ah ha ha ah hey hey hey ah to do too do do to do to
Ah ha ha ah hey hey hey ah to do too do do to do to
