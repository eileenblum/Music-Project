Go walkin' urban streets and we got ourselves a gun
Now thinkin' about our lives and the
Shapes shapes shapes shapes of things to come
Duckin' down the alleyways of fear a hungry cat calls
And he knows knows knows knows the end is near
Now we can't take it no more we'll smash down society's walls
Bad boys are comin' it's too late to cry
You better start runnin' or kiss your ass goodbye
Bad boys are comin' it's too late to cry
Too fast to live we're too young to die
Listen little darlin' I said you'll never understand
Our times runnin' out out out out in this jungle land
Clock strikes twelve and the wind begins to moan
Shivers down our spines and there's no no no no returnin' home
Now we can't take it no more we're gonna rip down society's walls
Bad boys are comin' it's too late to cry
You better start runnin' or kiss your ass goodbye
Bad boys are comin' it's too late to cry
Too fast to live we're too young to die
We can't take it no no no more
We'll kick down the fuckin' walls
Bad boys are comin' it's too late to cry
You better start runnin' or kiss your sorry ass goodbye
Bad boys are comin' it's too late to cry
Too fast to live we're too young to die
Bad boys are comin' it's too late to cry
You better start runnin' or kiss your ass goodbye
Bad boys are comin' it's too late to cry
Too fast to live we're too young to die
