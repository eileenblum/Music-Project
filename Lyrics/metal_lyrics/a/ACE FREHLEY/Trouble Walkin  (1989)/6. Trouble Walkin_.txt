I am trouble walkin' I'm every mother's nightmare
I am trouble walkin' whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh
Out on the street there's a lesson learned
You play with fire and you'll get burned
On the newstand there's another book
Out on the street what counts is the way you look
'cause I am trouble walkin' I'm every mother's nightmare
I am trouble walkin' whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh
There ain't no doubt I got what you need
You'll be beggin' baby please please please
With every switch sharper than a blade
I got you in my sights you can't escape
'cause  am trouble walkin' I'm every mother's nightmare
I am trouble walkin' whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh take Ace
No matter where you run no matter where you hide
Out here there's a rule you'll find only the strong survive
'cause  am trouble walkin' I'm every mother's nightmare
I am trouble walkin' uh huh whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh
I am trouble walkin' I'm every mother's nightmare
I am trouble walkin' yeah whoa oh oh oh oh
Whoa oh oh oh oh whoa oh oh oh oh it's a cash man
