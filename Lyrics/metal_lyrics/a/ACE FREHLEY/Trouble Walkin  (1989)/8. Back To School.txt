Hot summer's gone and you're still ready to burn
Back from vacation and you're eager to learn
Anticipation mixed with desire
No one can stop you 'cause your heart's on fire
Back back to school I'll teach you all the things that you never knew
You're goin' back back to school
Oh yeah yeah I'll give you everything you know it's true
'cause it's back to school for you
Now I'm the teacher but I have no degree
Forget the rest I'll teach you biology
Now just relax and you'll do your best
Concentrate and you'll pass the test
Back back to school I'll teach you all the things that you never knew
You're goin' back back to school
Oh yeah yeah I'll give you everything you know it's true
'cause it's back to school for you
I'll be your teacher and you'll be my pet
Put down your notebook 'cause there's no written test
Graduation is what you deserve
You'll have no problem 'cause I grade on a curve
You're goin' back back to school
You're goin' back back to school
You're goin' back back to school you're goin' back
You're goin' back to school
I'll teach you all the things that you never knew
You're goin' back back to school
I'll give you everything and you know it's true
You're goin' back back to school back back to school
You're goin' back to school back to school back to school
Back back to school back to school
