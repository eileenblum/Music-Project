Wake up Jack get ready here we come to rock this town
Hold on tight and steady over under sideways down
You must feel the power fix your eyes upon the stage
Watch us now devour everything that gets in our way
Your fascination with my creation adds stimulation rock til you drop
Hard rock nation lost generation end the frustration
Get shot full of rock get shot full of rock get shot full of rock
Taste the hard rock candy guaranteed to melt in your mouth
Jump back now Jim Dandy east west north and south
Catch the rush all over take a chance if you dare
Ain't got time for posers look out Dick you better beware
Your fascination with my creation adds stimulation rock til you drop
Hard rock nation lost generation and the frustration
Get shot full of rock get shot full of rock shot full of rock
You must feel the power fix your eyes upon the stage
Watch us now devour everything that gets in our way
Your fascination with my creation adds stimulation rock til you drop
Hard rock nation lost generation end the frustration
Get shot full of rock shot full of rock shot full of rock
