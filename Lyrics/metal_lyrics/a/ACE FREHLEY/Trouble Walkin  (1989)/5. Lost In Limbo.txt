The party's over in the morning light
My head is spinnin' lost my appetite
Barkin' dog much too loud
Chuck him a bone and get me out of this town
Voices I hear I can't explain
Those neon lights they hurt my brain
Feelin' no pain my body's numb
From hell's kitchen to kingdom come
Not feelin' happy not feelin' sad
Not feelin' anything good or bad
I'm not in heaven I'm not in hell
This must be limbo now can't you tell
Can't you tell come on
Lost lost in limbo we're just lost lost in limbo
Baby we're just lost lost in limbo
With nowhere to go
The morning after is such a bore
Can't even focus on the kitchen floor
Telephone please don't ring
Wanna forget about everything
Not feelin' happy not feelin' sad
Not feelin' anything good or bad
I'm not in heaven I'm not in hell
This must be limbo
Now can't you tell can't you tell
Lost lost in limbo
We're just lost lost in limbo
We're just lost lost in limbo
We're just lost lost in limbo
With nowhere to go
Nothin' to see feelin' no pain
It must be it must be limbo limbo limbo
Goin' down now don't stop me
