[Verse:]
Reckless, in my youth
I didn't know if I was up or down
Senseless, and confused
Sometimes they'd find me in the lost and found
So helpless, tell the truth
Sometimes I'd fall and end up on the ground

[Chorus:]
Lookin' for truth with passion
Tryin' to be in fashion
Knowin' what's right and crashin'
Reckless in every way

[Verse:]
Reckless, every day
I wasn't sure if things were black or while
Rejected, had to choose
Sometimes I didn't have a lot to say
So selfish, and confused
I'd turn the corner, then I'd lose my way

[Chorus]

I'm lookin' for love in passing
Wonderin' whose ass I'm trashin'
Tryin' to be cool, but not caring
Reckless in every way

So helpless
And Reckless
So helpless
And Reckless
So helpless
And Reckless
So helpless
And Reckless

[Verse:]
Helpless, tell the truth
I couldn't focus on the time of day
So Reckless, and confused
I got arrested 'cause I lost my way

[Chorus]

I'm lookin' for love in passing
Wonderin' whose ass I'm trashin'
Tryin' to be cool, but not caring
Reckless in every way

[Chorus]

I'm lookin' for love in passing
Wonderin' whose ass I'm trashin'
Tryin' to be cool, but not caring
Reckless in every way

[Chorus]
