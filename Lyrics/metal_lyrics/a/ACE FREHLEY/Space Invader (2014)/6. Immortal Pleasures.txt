[Forbidden Planet (1956) movie dialogue:]
[Adams:] C'mon Doc, let's have it.
[Doc Ostrow:] But the Krell forgot one thing...
[Adams:] Yes, what?
[Doc Ostrow:] Monsters, John. Monsters from the Id.

[Verse:]
I've seen it all
There's no more need for fighting
And I've had pleasures
Not known by mortal man
I've seen every place
There's no more need for searching
I've got my guitar
So catch me if you can

[Chorus:]
Immortal Pleasures
Immortal plans
An Immortal life
Fulfilled my demands

[Verse:]
I saw Olympus
Not blinded by the light
Majestic kingdoms
Delight at my command
I pushed my limits
Protected by the powers
I was a king
But returned to be a man

[Chorus:]
Immortal Pleasures
Immortal plans
An Immortal life
Fulfilled my demands
Immortal women, oh yeah!
Immortal love
Immortal Pleasures
From powers up above

The tree of life has many branches
We're all connected, binded by love
The Gods enjoy our many choices
If we choose wisely then we have won

I reached the top
There's no more need tor climbing
I was a boy
With my Immortal dream

[Chorus:]
Immortal Pleasures
Immortal plans
An Immortal life
Fulfilled my demands
Immortal women, oh yeah!
Immortal love
Immortal Pleasures
From powers up above

Immortal Pleasures
Immortal plans
An Immortal life
Fulfilled my demands
