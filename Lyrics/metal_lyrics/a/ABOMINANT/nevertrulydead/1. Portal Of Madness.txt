Through Gateways Of Dreams, Enter The Unknown Realms 
Passages To Another Time Where I Submit My Ways.
Conqueror Bringer Of Shame, Master Of Many Names He
Who Speaks In Many Tongues, Why Is This, Time Will
Tell 

Escaping To A Primitive Landscape, Complex Structures
Of A Vast New Race, Darkening Thoughts Of Mortal
Emission, Conquest Of Life Total Submission 
Tears That Fall From My Eyes, Like Liquid Fire Burning
So Bright The Unconscious Mind Is Here To Witness,
Psychotic Trips Through A Portal Of Madness 

Supernatural Beings From An Unknown Void, Surpassing
Through Our Bodily Origins In A Microscopic Form,
Tales Of Terror Which You'll Hear Reveals Your Vivid
Imagination Of Specters You Will Fear 

Falling So Fast Cause Your So Blind, Things Of The
Past Will Come To Mind Catch Yourself Before You Die
Or Forever, Eternally Reign In This Time 

Force Without Form, Come To Light 
Travel Along A Spiral Trace Into The Darken Skies 
Burn The Fleas That Plague With Disease, Torture
Representatives Of Humanity, 
No Where To Run You Try To Leave, Come Out Of The
Dream, Running Towards The Light Of Reality, Your
Quickly Slipping Away 

I Run Towards The Light, 
The Door Is Closing Fast Battling These Dregs Of Hate,

They Submit My Fate Tearing At My Emotions, I Feel The
Pain 
Skin Is Stripped Away, Oh Please Help Me 

Feeble One, Now In My Dominion, I Eternally Damn Thee 
Through Gateways Of Dreams, Entered The Unknown Hell 
Passed Away In A Moment Of Time, Now Your Forever
Lost.
