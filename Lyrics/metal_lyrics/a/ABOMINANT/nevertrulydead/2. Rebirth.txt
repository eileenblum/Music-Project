I As One And I As One Stand Alone 
Wipe Away, These Prophetic Things I See 
Diabolical Experimentation Of Myself 
Into The Life Pod, To Change My Retched Existence 

Reborn, Experience The Rebirth 
I Shall Reign On Mountains High 

Into The Storm Of My Eyes 
And You Will See It, Before Your Demise 
All Of My Children Of The Earth 
Come To See My Temple, On Mountains High 
And Celebrate For The Rebirth Of Me 
We Will Bond As One, To Form Legions Of Hate Power
Overwhelming, 
Crushing, Destroying Sowing The Seeds Of Haste, 
Forever Growing And Changing The Will Of The Other Man

Killing Themselves To Be Reborn Again 

Reborn Is To Die, A World Demise 
So Many Things Are Happening 

Birth Is Painful And Tasteless 
Testimony To The True Apocalypse 
Winter Solstice In A New Generation 

Succumb To My Orifice, Witness A Violent Sight 
They Will Bleed, Onto Me 
You've Seen The Rebirth Of Me, Fall Down And Worship
Me 
It Is Thy Will, Or Be Killed
