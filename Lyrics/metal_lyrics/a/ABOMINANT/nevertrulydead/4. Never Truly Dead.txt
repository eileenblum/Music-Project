Horrid, Feelings, Things That Have Happened To Me In
My Life 
Walls Of Stone, That Entomb Me 
Never Will See The Light 
Shadows, Filter, Takes A Place In My Mind 
Forces Unnatural, Repel To Me, A Hopeless Race Against
Time 

In A Place At The Wrong Time 
Shot Through The Neck, Left Paralyzed 
Coroner Presumes Me To Be Dead 
Nothing I Do Can Change This 
Everything I Try Is Useless 

Immobilized, I Fear The Night, The Blackened Cold
Engulfs 
My Body, Try To Cry, To Show A Sign, But No One Can
Hear Me 

All The Love, And All The Shame 
In A World Now Left Behind 
My Life Is Stripped Away 
From The Gun Of A Homicidal Lunatic 
There Is No Justice For A Crime 
The Guilty Go Unpunished 
Merciless Criminal Minds Are Running Free In This
World 

Angels Come Forth To Take Me To Another Place 
Spiritual Battle, I Fight For My Soul 
They Leave Me There All Alone 
I Am Not Dead 

Mourners Gather At My Side To Say Their Last Goodbyes 
Laying In My Bed Of Death, They Shut The Lid Down
Tight 
Commended My Body To The Ground, Ashes To Ashes And
Dust To Dust 
Leaving Me There, Never Knowing, That I Was Never
Truly Dead 

Immobilized, I Fear The Night, The Blackened Cold
Engulfs My Body 
Try To Cry, To Show A Sign, But No One Can Hear Me 

All The Love, And All The Shame 
In A World Now Left Behind 
My Life Is Stripped Away 
From A Gun Of A Homicidal Lunatic 
There Is No Justice For A Crime 
The Guilty Go Unpunished 
Merciless Criminal Minds Are Running Free In This
World 

Just Leaving Me There Never Knowing, That I Was Never
Truly Dead
