[Nuclear Assault cover]

I am sick and tired of the way you've let things slide
Just because we're young doesn't mean we can't decide
If you think that we ain't got a thought inside our heads
I'm telling you right now that you better think again

Now we'll see what we can do for ourselves
It's time to show us some concern
I'm sick of your god damned apathy
It's time to stand up and make yourself three

You have held us back and pushed us down for all our lives
When it comes to running things you've done a half-assed job
It is time that you learned it's what you do not what you say
And if you refuse to learn we're gonna make you pay

[Chorus]

Viet-Nam and Lebanon, other people's wars
I won't fight unless it's right, corporate wars no-more
I believe this country's worth my life to help defend
I won't fight to help keep Dow Jones out of the red

[1st verse]

[Chorus]
