With hell he comes
Representative of death
For he is the law
Finder of the witches
Souls are lost in the abyss
Accused of black magic
A prisoner to their pain
Death comes creeping
And all the cries of the lies
They will die in Hopkins' eyes
In every town the witchfinder comes
Lost within a lie
Innocent flesh will die
Lash their hands to the post
Bring wood and oil
Set ablaze at their feet
Burn witches burn!
All in one day, life taken away
And the children play
In the ashes of the witches
No church can hold sanctuary
Your time has come
Gaze into the eyes of darkness
See the madness within
Lost is your salvation
Soon you will join the dead
Bashed, beaten broken bodies
Brutality is the key
Slashed, slain severe suffering
Slowly they will bleed
Devil in the flesh incarnate
Lost in wickedness
Mauling, maiming mass murdering
Molested are the weak
The is the lord and law of the land
Killing the innocent by his command
Hopkins is on his way
Death with a human face
