For a while I been hearing, the screams of agony Like
so many people dying For my eyes have seen the worst
in this life, and beyond... The visions of horror from
beyond spectral plains Like a noble warrior I must go
to the outer realms The center of hell There I must
face the unknown master of benevolence In battle... At
the gates I face a path of darkness A trail I must
walk alone A shield I carry, and sword in hand Faith
is my courage, is all I carry in this waste land A
task of bravery, I will prevail I wipe the sweat from
my eyes, the visions of horror A silhouette of demons
Swift as the wind they attack, the battle of destiny
begins The blood and valor is beyond spectral plains I
swing my sword up high, the sounds of steel collide
Hand to hand we fight on, until the very last they
will fall The sounds of the dying, screaming in their
blood Onward I keep marching, for victory is in my
wake Surrounded by darkness and dismay For what lies
before me is the land of death I carry on alone into
oblivion
