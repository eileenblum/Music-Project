In the night the light burns away Dissipating into
shadows In the black hearts that bleeds pure death An
empty shell remains For the last rites of sorrow Eyes
reap of tears A conquest full of questions The answer
lies in wake A figure of black stands before me Eyes
of others watching me For which I face is the unknown
A darker side of my own And the screams of horrific
voices Fills o soul full of fear Is this a dream or
just reality For no one can explain A dark mystery
Forces beyond the unknown Is it just imagination A
silhouette of night that speaks no words Face to face
I see the nothing A stone edged face that sheds a tear
For they enter my body and possessed my soul I turn my
face and look away I close my eyes, I dwell in fear As
I look again the nothing is no more Was it a dream or
true reality Till another night they return again The
endless shadows of evil There's no god that can help
me For I am doomed within my own cell The dark mystery
