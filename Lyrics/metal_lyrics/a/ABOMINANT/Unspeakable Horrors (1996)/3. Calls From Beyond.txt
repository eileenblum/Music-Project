Cold winds from the north seem strange in this time of
year. Electrical storm out of the skies, an enchanting
force is about to appear. All is wrong. This is
unexplainable. They're drawing me. My destiny is
unknown. They speak to me. Voices of many waters.
Drowning me under a pool of bitter sorrow. Portals.
The many doorways of time. Urging me closer to walk
through. Entranced by visions of light. Try to come
back through. The electro-rays of time. An answered is
revealed to my mind. In this place. I'm destined to
die. On my knees begging and pleading. Please let me
go. Somewhere that I can be free. They speak to me in
a convincing way. Liars to a fool. I must obey them.
Calls from beyond. Chantings of deceitful ones.
Witness to see who will be next. Calls from beyond.
Growing closer to your death. Only the fool will take
his last breath.
