Feeling anxiety. Lost reality. Things I can't believe.
Things I've seen. Wrapped in a dream. Are not
relieved. Persecuted all my life for lies I haven't
done. A fugitive on the run. What did I do wrong?
Searching for evidence to clear my name. Piecing
together the truth day by day. Closing in fast. Got to
move. I cannot stop. My frustrations are burning
inside. The expressions I can no longer hide. A
challenging quest for freedom must not waste anymore
time. The past and present is my future. All
accusations are false. Father, I pray for my sake.
Help me before I'm caught. Intentionally accused.
Intentionally accused. Living in total secrecy.
Changing my name constantly. Hiding my images in
disguises. Going from city to city. Within nobody's
reaches. A total stranger in the crowd. It's up to me
to be free. Can't go on living this way. Intentionally
accused. Intentionally accused.
