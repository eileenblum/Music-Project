Falling deeper into a subconscious state. Of a
distorted. Weak from of mind. Blackened in the
spiritual way. Into glory ride. The other side.
Running along beside. Entities guiding me through the
light. What I see. So real. Memories of a past before
me. Unspeakable horrors of life relentlessly. Always
never ending. Mystical. Pathological tempt.
Uncertainty of what is beyond. Voices of the elders.
Echoes in my head. My hands in their hands. A bond.
Commitment. Lost-senseless. Useless. Holding onto a
life that is no more. Bondage. Enslavement. My ways
are of the ancient ones.
