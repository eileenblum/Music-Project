Times have changed in this once precious land. Beast
of burden is what's become of fellow man. And women
weep as their children are dying. Vanquished in a time
without prayer. Burn. Death. Kill. And destroy. In any
race. Watch them die. Murder. Rape. Cheating and
stealing. This is the only way to survive. A new line
of judgment is needed. For a new world order. Who will
pay the price to see? The new law goes through.
Chaotic as the world might seem. In one persons point
of view. In others eye's its a way of life. And it was
always meant to be. To bring forth solutions of world.
But times are out of line. As they pray to god for an
answer. Peace. Looters run wild in the streets of the
night. Lawless world of pain. Fear. Dying. Dark places
of filthy swine. Murderers. Reign of lunacy will last
eternally.
