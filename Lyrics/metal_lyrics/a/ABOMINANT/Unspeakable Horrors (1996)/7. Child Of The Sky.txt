Rain falls from heaven above. What you see. Nothing
can save you. Mother nature is violently disturbed.
When lightening cracks the sky. Sirens scream in the
night. Could this be a dream? Panic spreads throughout
the night. Compelled by fear as the void draws near.
Winds collide. Listening to the broadcast. Warning to
take cover. Sought out b an unstoppable force. Such a
sound of a thousand chariots. What a loss. It is the
cost. The dead are so many. Miles and miles of
devastation. Fire burns deep with the twilight.
Cataclysmic whirlwinds. Breath of god. You're going to
die. Thunder shakes the ground. It leaves you
trembling in fear. Onward this child of the sky.
Destruction is all that's left behind. Devastated.
Lightning turns the night to day. Structures are blown
away. Unexpected and a disastrous surprise. Devastated
by this child of the sky.
