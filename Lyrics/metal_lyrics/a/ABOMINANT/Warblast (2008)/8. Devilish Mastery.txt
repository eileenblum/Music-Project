Darkness empowers me, sickened is my blackened soul
Look into the eyes of madness
Can you see the story to be told?
As a child I was tormented by society
In my world, I grew into sickness and disgusting pleasures
To torture life, practicing the arts of flesh and blood
To hear 'em scream, to see 'em beg for mercy
I am the one who brings absolute chaos
I am death incarnate
Behold my devilish mastery

To stalk my victims at random
Not knowing what hides in the shadows... death!
To look into their eyes
Their fear fuels my high
To climax by blood
The angel of death is smiling
For they all are forsaken by my hand
To cut away their flesh excites me
To fashion their bodies in ghastly art makes me proud
Grisly are the shrines of flesh I display

Stare through the eyes of sickness
The bringer of terror, torture and death
I am the vein that will drain them of their blood
And before me are images of faces and lifeless bodies
The last chapter of life to be told
