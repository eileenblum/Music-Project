A row of spears gleaming bright
Thousands of swords ready
Archers stand strong and ready for flight
Arrows will pierce many
Charging into the enemy
The 13th legion
Fighting strong for Rome
Great Caesar, Hail oh mighty Caesar!
We shall fight and make wastelands of their home
Standing strong they draw close and near
An army so strong and so severe
The earth quakes at your feet
As they march across the plains
Soldiers will fall in defeat
We will fight, may Zeus be our guide
May our enemies fall and die
For the glory of Rome
We lay wake across the land
Triumph, triumphant in battle
Victorious, victorious leaders
Hail the 13th legion, the mighty lions of Rome!
13th legion!
