Feelings of passion and lust
Blackness fulfills my pain and disgust
Sickened is my dying heart
Thoughts are lifeless and impure
Visions of red and the obscure
Indecent, tasteless and obscene
The wretched cold that breeds in me

I care not of others that look down at me
Pathetic and weak, they are a waste of life
Seeing clear for the first time
Truths between truths and lies between lies
Finding the only answer
For each man must find within himself

I call upon no one to give me assurance
Inside my mortal cell breeds deathly silence
To unlock him, to unchain him, the beast within
I control my own fate and believe in what is real
Blackness, emptiness, the evil inside

I spit at the feet of all religions that believe
Their ways are just slandering and corrupting
The masses of foolish believers
Not one of them has the will to stand alone
Drain the blood of all hypocrites

May this world bleed black
All arise in a new found belief, a master of one
Cursing those who look the wrong way
Evil inside
