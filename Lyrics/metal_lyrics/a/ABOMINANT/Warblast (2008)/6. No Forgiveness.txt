Cast out and banished from society
For crimes committed against humanity
Sentenced to life trapped in a cell
To dwell and drown in your own hell
Lost in the darkness you say
Persuaded and controlled
Sadistic and inhumane were your ways
Butcher of human souls

Raped and sodomized of their rites
Benevolent is the mind and heart
Creating the picture perfect death
Taking lives, the last and final breath
Families of the deceased are torn
Saddened eyes burning full of hate
Pierce you like many thorns
Abandoned and sealed is your fate

No forgiveness!

Harvester of tasteless sins, perverse, demented lust
Unspeakable acts so they say, twisted, grotesque
Images of death
Many lives in the blink of an eye
Tortured, butchered and slain
Now locked away for the rest of your days
Convicted, imprisoned for eternity

No forgiveness!
