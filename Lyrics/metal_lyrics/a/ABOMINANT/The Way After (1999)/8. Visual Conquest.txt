I gaze through the waters to see another reality 
To a place beyond hope and fear 
Seen visions of an unspoken paradise 
When will I drift into my own reality 
Oh, the beauty of images seen through fire 
An altered place 
to taste the blood and to become my illusion 
As I fade away like sand 
Now I see the line between space and time 
A dimensional state 
Explore a place through the dark catacombs of your
mind 
My visual conquest 
To open the doors to my future world 
I see hell's fire burn below my feet 
To become animal of my past primate 
To kill again, of the land, in the night 
Second sight, the third eye, to see with my mind 
The knowledge 
To change existence, mutile beyond the norm 
The hideous nothing, the ultimate terror 
To explore the mind, open oblivion's door 
The secret landscape of the mind
