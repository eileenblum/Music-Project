In this perilous nation 
we struggle to live 
And fight for what is ours 
But the time is to late 
There's no one to save you now 
In darkness I hold the flame of hope 
A guiding light for those who will follow 
The world of life is treacherous 
The sorrow you feel 
Is tearing your heart apart 
The pain you suffer is merciless 
The dark lords prey 
Upon your weakness now 
We pray for God to give us the final answer 
And for the words we spoke go unheard 
My pain, wishing that I was dead 
For this life is dying and soon to end 
It's peace what we cry for 
looking for tomorrow's end 
Lost for words, what can I say 
It want the same, so strange 
The world is ending, nothing left for me 
No use trying 
So let it be, the dying world 
Forever be, eternally
