I lie empty, no thoughts in my head. Just knowing what
tonight will bring. The somber shade of star lite sky.
It begins when I close my eyes. Awaken from sleeping
visions. Waken no hours hope forlorn. All I can do,
all I can scream. Try to awaken from this dream.
Dreams of the past possessed my soul. Haunting
nightmares takes control. The screams and cried that
burns within. Laughing sirens on the wind. Reality
obscure by dreams. I feel death close by. Will I die
before I awake. Severe me from my dreams. I lie in
wait for daylight. Trapped by the silence that
surrounds me. Listen to as the night creatures call.
Weakness has profound me. Its all I can do, cant stay
awaked stimulate, lie down take my fate. Disturbed,
darkness descents around me. Close my eyes let it
begin again. Dreams of the past possessed my soul.
Haunting visions take control. Who will hear theses
screams within. Like whispering sirens on the wind.
Reality obscure my dreams. I feel death close by. Will
I die before I awake. Severe me from my dreams.
