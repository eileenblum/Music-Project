Show me the way after 
Feel the pain before my eyes 
Pull the veil before my face 
Feel my pain from inside 
Will the flowers cry at my grave 
Passing pictures fly by my mind 
My last kiss life aside 
Last dream again then I die 

Wrap me in your arms of silence 
Drape me in your dark cloak 
Set aside a candle by my name 
Wither flowers forever more 
I face the shadows of all my fear 
I grief in despair when I see it all 
Night above the light and so below 
I stumble forward for the fall 

As darkness closed my eyes 
I will find the way after 

Behold my eyes of pain 
Tears pour fall soft like rain 
Life has now turn gray 
Look to death now I'm not afraid
