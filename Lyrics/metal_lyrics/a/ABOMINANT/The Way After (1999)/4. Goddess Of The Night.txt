Nightfall, into the eyes of darkened passion.
Nightfall, fall victim to her dark desires. The
tempting lust, two arms to embrace her beauty. Hearts
cry, eyes caress her blackened image. Cold nights
frost, covered in the sleeping snow. A winters spell,
a suspended statue of frozen misery. Her empress
supreme, goddess of the night. Forest of mourning,
magical limbo fire. Her eyes of winter entrancing,
lost in her mystical spell. Guardian of wolves,
bloodlust, the desire of blissful onslaught. In the
night the goddess of desire calls to me. For what she
is, is what I love. I offer her my loyalty and
devotion. Slave to the spirits of night. Bounded in
chains of thy lust. A animal of searing passion.
Nightfall, the icy breath from her lips. Nightfall, a
land of infernal beauty.
