fade away, oh gloomy past. stop your haunting, the
tears your bring. leave thee in peace, tranquility.
you abomination of passionless pain. dwell you shall.
scorn inside of familiar faces. cannot try to hide.
lie deep within my thoughts it hides, then awaken
suddenly. torn inside my mind. scared within me. never
immune to this perpetual sadness. tears. it haunts me.
i close my eyes i close my eyes and sear their faces.
my thoughts are unrestrained, enter the dark catacomb
of my mind. agony and passionless pain. struggle with
my emotion. denying my restless. twisted with my
sanity. like thorns across my face.
