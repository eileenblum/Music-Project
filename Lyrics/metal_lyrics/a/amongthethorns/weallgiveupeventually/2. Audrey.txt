Filled with the deceit wearing a porcelain mask to hide the imperfections
You lit he fire that will burn it all down
A wolf in sheep's clothing

Everything you say, everything you say
Got me questioning, questioning
Just look the other way
While we're burning to the ground
Just look the other way
While we're burning to the ground

You've got the taste of blood on your lips

Everything you say, everything you say
Got me questioning, questioning
Just look the other way
While we're burning to the ground
Just look the other way
While we're burning to the ground
Don't pretend the mask is real
Cover up all of the mistakes
Hoping no one sees you for your true face
I've seen the man that I can be
And it's not the reflection looking back at me

This brokenness inside of me weights on my chest
I'm haunted by your actions in my mind
I lay awake, but can't find peace inside
I'd rather die than be with you
There's no apologies
That make this OK
I'll set your life ablaze

Just walk away
There's a hole in my chest where I used to keep your memory
Forget my name
You're just a mistake

Everything you say, everything you say
Got me questioning
Just look the other way
While we're burning to the ground
Filled with the deceit wearing a porcelain mask to hide the imperfections
You lit he fire that will burn it all down
A wolf in sheep's clothing

Everything you say, everything you say
Got me questioning, questioning
Just look the other way
While we're burning to the ground
Just look the other way
While we're burning to the ground

You've got the taste of blood on your lips

Everything you say, everything you say
Got me questioning, questioning
Just look the other way
While we're burning to the ground
Just look the other way
While we're burning to the ground
Don't pretend the mask is real
Cover up all of the mistakes
Hoping no one sees you for your true face
I've seen the man that I can be
And it's not the reflection looking back at me

This brokenness inside of me weights on my chest
I'm haunted by your actions in my mind

Everything you say, everything you say

Just look the other way
While we're burning to the ground
