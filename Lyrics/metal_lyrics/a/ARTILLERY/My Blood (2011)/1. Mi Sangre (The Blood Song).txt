Look beyond the lost horizonSee what's lurking in the darkYou can follow if you want toOpen up your heart Take a walk into the gardenSmell the flower of despairTaste the bitter fruit of evilBut my child beware Your innocence you will loseThere's no turning backIn life you must always chooseForever you will be my blood You'll see the world explode around youYou'll see the mountains falling, into the seaBut there must be no fear inside youDeep within yourself you will find the key Ride on the wings of an angelFight with the strenght of a lionRide on the wings of an angelYou will never surrender And there will be someone to guide youIf you look deep enough you will find the spiritSometimes the darkness will surround youYou'll wander through the mud, you will find the light My blood lives through you Don't expect to find the answersTo the questions you will askLife is just a simple storyTurn the pages now Your innocence you will loseThere's no turning backIn life you must always chooseForever you will be my blood Mit blod lives on foreverMit blod lives on forever And you must never find the truthThere is no holy manThat will lead you to salvationThe answers lie within yourselfDon't live on your knees(It's better to)Die for what you belive in
