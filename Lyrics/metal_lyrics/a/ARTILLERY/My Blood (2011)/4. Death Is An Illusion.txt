Death is life

I bow down in the dust of what we came from
Silly rules of life determinate my deathstyle
I can see the lies of what you came from
So easy to read like a spoiled child

My sorrow ends within my wicked silence
Two fisted and bitter to the better end
So come out of your closet, and take what you've been givin
I will stand alone and I will not repend

If life is real then death is an illusion
If pain is life I'm lost in life's confussion
If life is real then death is an illusion
If love is hope then love is what we choose from now

With a wire straight from hell's foaming mouth
I will cut off my own head and hold it in my hand
Stand on the mountain of hate and desire
I will defeat my inner self with a raging fire

See the crucifix in flames
I will level with my pain
See the crucifix in flames
I will connect you in chains
In chains

Like a butterfly with wings burnt and soiled
I taste the ugly fruit of self deceit
No man alive will push me off my throne
I am the only one, who will defeit me

I will defeat my innerself with a raging fire
