Behind the little boy's eyes name is written in bloodThere is not a clue in sight, not a moment of clarityGrew up to be a man behind the white fence he rules and he standsFrowning at the happy world outsideBut inside his head it's dark Just remember thisEveryone is a mother's son Different colour different skinScarred for life there is no turning backHe lifts the blade over his headWatch him intoxicated by his victims fearHe is about to deliver his attackBut inside his head it's dark Just remember thisEveryone is a mother's son Monster, the monster insideMonster, we all live in fearFor the monster, the monster insideMonster, the monster is near Ready to kill, ready to strikeThe screams so loud makes him high so highHe walks away in a perfect timeBut he will return to the scene of the crimeBut inside his head it's dark
