The sun no longer shines as bright as itUse to doThe world no longer breath as easy as itUsed to do We're trapped insideThese are dark daysWe're left behindIn so many waysWe're burnt aliveThese are dark daysAre coming for us now The water is no longer running as smoothly as itUsed to doAnd the air is not as clear as itUsed to be See the stone is bleedingHear the wicked thunderFell the earth is shakingThe whole world's going under Our time is slowly runningIt's burning under our feetSee the creatures in painAnd we will not return again
