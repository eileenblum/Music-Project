Great
Into Satans armpit I will crawl to seek my vengeance
The ressurection of his evil world
The sailor lost at sea, look for the sun and moon to guide me
I am that sailor I am his vengeance

The great the great will always be
Great the great will always be
Great the great will always stand
We will hunt you down

A timebomb set to blow, destroy all that you know
The decadence of the western world

So walk with me on the brink of time
I will liberate you from sin and your life of crime
Walk with me on the sands of time
Roll the heads of vanity roll it out of line
How will you live your life, sweet sister
How will you live it now
Who will you run to now dear brother
Who will you run to now

Into Satans armpit I will crawl to seek my vengeance
A simple way of thinking a simple way of life
Now we can conquer all the world
