Raise your handsThrasher!Bang your headThrasher!Scream it outThrasher! Are you ready to killCan you take this mutha downAre you in for the thrillWe're gonna demolitious this town Can you reach for the skyAnd sing this song out loudAre you prepared to dieAnd go out with a shout Have you sent it allDo you feel you can stand the heatCan you take the fallOr do you not accept defeat It goes round and roundGet into the pitIt goes round and roundGet into the shit
