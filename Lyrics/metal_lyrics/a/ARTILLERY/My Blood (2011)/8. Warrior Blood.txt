"This is the moment I've been waiting forThis is all that fills my life this is my dreamI'm in this corner with my back to the wallOnly me I am alone this is all I want" Marching into oblivion, no fear only hateOur god is merciless and iron madeMankind on it's knees, we provide securityInstead you choose to live on your own miseryMisery Running into battles totally unknownThis battlefield is our sacred homeIt's time to unleash this beast of warIt's time to slay this ungodly whore That's why I gotWarrior bloodIt's in my soul and in my heart As brothers we standBlood on blood hand in handLike lions we biteBack to back side by side It's in my bones it's in my soulI will feed my heart with this 'till I get oldFrom generation to generation to generation...It's the bloodline you can't kill
