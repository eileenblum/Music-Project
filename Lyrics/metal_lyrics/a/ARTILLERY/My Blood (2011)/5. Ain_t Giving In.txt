Got no religion, got no excuseIt's my own decision, won't take no abuseGot my own way of living, your life I despiseNothing I could be giving, change the look in my eyes Got no distractions, got a one track mindNoone ever told me, what I needed to findIf you can't understand me, then I just don't careDo you want me to be, when there's nothing we shareWhen there's nothing we share I ain't giving in, to all your goddamm rulesI'm gonna win, I don't listen to fools I know you wanna judge me, you are all the sameThose you can't understand, always take all the blameBut I just don't buy, course I know the scoreSomething never change, we've all heard it before I'm changing the rules
