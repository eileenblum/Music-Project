So it has come to this
You scurry under our feet
A second peace is bliss
Amidst refuse you must eat

Living and dying - without remembrance
Living and dying - at the mercy of ignorance

So you have become the neglected
By the system rejected
Happy if we don't see you
Denial thy name is hero

On hands and knees
A broken song, a broken dance
Your life is dust at the mercy of ignorance

Nothing to soothe your pain
Drugs to numb your brain
A hole in your arm and a hole in your heart
A losing game from the very start
