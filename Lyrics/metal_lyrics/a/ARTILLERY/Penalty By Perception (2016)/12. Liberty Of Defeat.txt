We are at war my friends
Our existence has come into the dark
And bleak and frayed ends
The enemy is our of the usual kind
Purely the genome of all mankind
All mankind â all mankind â all mankind

Fathers fallen by the hands of religion
A darkened aggression with futile decisions
So they abandon all and they desecrate
Their own children, with self-righteous hate
Self-righteous hate

Now we hold on to deceit
Our fate is at the liberty of defeat
A world born under trampling feet
All we have is at the liberty of defeat

What can you do when your hands are tied?
What can you do?

What can you do, when you're chained?
What can you do?

So we are the enchained, cuffed and blinded
The politicians and demagogues behind it
They poison all our minds, bodies and your lives
Whipping us all with fear, hate and lies
Hate and lies

Now we hold on to deceit
Our fate is at the liberty of defeat
A world born under trampling feet
All we have is at the liberty of defeat
