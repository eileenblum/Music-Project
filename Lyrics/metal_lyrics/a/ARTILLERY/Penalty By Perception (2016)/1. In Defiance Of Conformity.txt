In defiance of conformity
Are the chains of society
Ignorance and idiocy
Defiance of conformity

Branded and stranded - my life is my noose
You try to contain me with words of abuse
Try to insult me, a job that's well done
Salvation lies here by being gone

You must see - Fight fight
Brave the pain
You shal find - Fight fight
An open mind

Words like glass breaking, I cringe in disgust
Face of stupidity, wits turned to dust
Can't breathe, can't think, my mind feels like lead
Keep on like this, I will be dead

In defiance of conformity
Are the chains of society
Defiance of conformity
Ignorance and idiocy
Defiance of conformity
Are the chains of society
Defiance of conformity
Ignorance and idiocy

Poor man you must be a sick thing - deep inside
You have no strength, fear being alone

The world like quicksand, I stumble and fall
Can't keep my breath so I must fight 'till last call
I will be gone, lost and insane
Anything I'll do, won't play your game

Poor man you must be a sick thing - deep inside
