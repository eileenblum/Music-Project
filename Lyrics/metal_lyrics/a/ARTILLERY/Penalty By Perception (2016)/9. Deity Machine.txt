Do you find yourself, in the company of lies
Are there no longer, any voices who justifies - you

A different broken shrine, on a different day
The one are the many, confusion had its way

You are Deity, Deity Machine, Deity Machine

Layers of existence, where are you today
Your mind slowly collapsing, no words for you to say

Deity Machine, Deity Machine
Deity Machine, Deity Machine
Deity Machine, Deity Machine
Deity Machine, Deity Machine

Machinery is marching; the light has gone to black
Eyes of eternity see right through your soul

An idea inside your head, a social psychosis
Do we look deeper, or do we welcome neurosis
