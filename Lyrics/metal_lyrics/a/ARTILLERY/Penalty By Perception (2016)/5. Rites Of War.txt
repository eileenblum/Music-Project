When you leave this world
The chains undone and death unfurls
What were the choices you had?
The paths you took - good or bad

Reflections of you - You're fighting a shadow

A chip on your shoulder
Nail in your heart got you colder
Your hands made for caress
Fists of anger fear and distress

Rites of war - conflict deep inside
Rites of war - traveled, short or far
Rites of war - fighting, run or hide
Rites of war - running, from afar

Your steps filled with regret
Who you were and who you met
Did love rule your world?
Walk all alone, solidarity unfurled
