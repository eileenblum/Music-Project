From the distance I heard a voice
Calling my name
Feeling dizzy I'm caught in the noise
Am I going insane?

Dusty clouds surround my head
Is this the devils sign?
The voice said prepare for your death
Cause you're the next in line

Can you see it? Can you feel it?
Something evil has taken control
It's like a nightmare, it's so unreal
Am I losing my soul?
And the magic has gone

Travelling to an unknown place
What will the future bring?
Death shows its evil face
I can hear the Devil sing

Am I alive or dead
It keeps spinning in my head
Am I alive or dead?
I know the time has come
And the magic is gone
