Twisting and turning - it enwraps us all
Timeless and eternal - without vision or recall

Paradox enigma - for our minds to fathom
A Devilish creation - unavoidable, unavoidable doom

We - We are all living
In - in a cosmic brain
We - We are all living
In a cosmic brain - In a cosmic brain

Fabric of existence - seems to be a clue
Atom and nucleus - enormous without hue

Inside outside - you're nowhere to be found
Are you around - yet nowhere to be found

An answer closer - we will never understand
Complexity beyond - paramount, tiny and grand
