What makes it come true?
The biggest fear of your life
Is it all that you can do?
Peace or in strife

In your hour of need
Do you kneel or do you stand?
Driven by hunger or greed
Cast your shadow

Path of the atheist
Believers must fall
Path of the atheist
Choose your path - or not at all
Atheist

Who offends the offender
Dabble truth into lies
Above belief, race or gender
Free spirit flies

So prepare and know my friends
The future holds, my absence
