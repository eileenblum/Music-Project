Shoulder to shoulder, weapons in hand
Mind set and marching and boots in the sand
Our eyes see only the road ahead
Blood and guts and victory or death

Strain and the tear, fatique and the pain
Losing your mind, scars and bloody stain
Darkened vision, no light comes our way
Burned down to the bone, impending tragedy

Live by the scythe - Live by the scythe
Die by the sword
We bring you the law
Live by the scythe, Thundering War
Die by the scythe

Numb to your soul, but never giving in
Shaking hands you lose or you win
End of the line, an enemy in sight
Eternal war, united for the fight

A victim by our hand, a slave to your vice
Controlling you by fear, we are rolling the dice

Hey, hey, hey....

Shoulder to shoulder, weapons in hand
Mind set and marching and boots in the sand
End of the line, an enemy in sight
Eternal war, united for the fight
