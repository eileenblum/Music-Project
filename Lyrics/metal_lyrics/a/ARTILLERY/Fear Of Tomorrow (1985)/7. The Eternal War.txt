Invaders came in from the ocean
Tortured and killed all our men
Raped all our women and burned down
The world we had build up through the years
There's no way out of this torment
They killing us all one by one
We're washing the blood of our bodies
But soon they return again

Invaders - they raped our land
Invaders - death by their hand

They taking control of our system
Tortured and killed all the damned
To fight against all the violence
We all stand apart till we die
What will become of our culture
When madmen have taken control
To be a sign of our time

They came in from the sea
In the dead of night
Blood and misery
In the night you could hear
The screams from those who died
By the hand of the invaders

Who are you creeps that are ruling
Our lives and finally our death
Are you the evil inside us
That's no longer our friends
Are you the master's punishment
Or are you the soldiers from hell
Maybe the fight against evil
Is only a fight against ourself
