[1.]
Bells you hear from everywhere
Fire is lightening through the air
Fear is driving you insane
Death - your life is in vain

[CHORUS:]
He will tear your mind apart
Rip out your soul and heart
He will flame your eyes
He'll leave you no disguise

[2.]
Bells exploding in your ears
Fire is burning up your tears
Fear - now for your life you cry
Death - you know you're gonna die

[CHORUS]

[SOLO]

[3.]
Time has come - incompetent you ruled
Time has come - with life and death you fooled
Time has come - a curse fell on your name
Time has come - you've got yourself to blame
[REPEAT]

[REPEAT 2 + CHORUS]
