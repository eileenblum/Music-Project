[Intro:]
In a time which now is forgotten
Was a land of horror and death
It was known as a place without mercy
Evil ruled... evil ruled that land

In this land behind of nowhere
Lived this man who killed for glory
It was no place for weakness
Evil ruled that land

King of evil, his word was law
Tortured and slaughtered they wanted his head
It was no place for justice
Evil ruled that land

Tyrant from hell
Thy name is written with their blood
King of the past
So cruel and mean you better die
Tyrant from hell
They gonna get you in the end
King of the past
You know you're gonna die at last

Then came the day he lost his head
Slaughtered in hate and blood
It was no place of mercy
Evil ruled that land
