[Intro speak:]
Afraid of light and day
I've got to live this way
Forced by an unknown power
I've completed my deeds of darkness

I believe in evil, darkness makes me wild
I believe in death, dead bodies give me life

Out in the night I dig up dead bodies

Waiting all day for the dark to get satisfied
Hungry for dead meat tonight
I believe in evil, blood thirsty like a shark
I believe in death, I'm dreamin' in the dark

Eatin' in the shadows of the church
I feel the wind blow to my brain
The flesh is dead but it's full of life
The smell of blood makes me feel alright

I'm totally insane, I feel no pain

From down below I heard a voice
Drawn by desire I had no choice
Beneath the shade of death I'm facing their heads
Ill try to fight against but they give a damn

They buried me alive
Now I can reach the sky
Prepare for reincarnation
Purgatory awaits my invasion
My breath is getting weaker
My body is shrunken
Gelatins my eyes and lungs
Now my body is full of life
