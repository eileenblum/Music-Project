I am the bringer of evil
I am the bringer of fright
I am the one with the power
Try me I'll show you I'm right
How can you say you're almighty
Just take a look at yourself
Where is your lovin' and kindness
It's hidden away on a shelf

[CHORUS:]
I will make you burn
From Hell there's no return
I will make you burn
So you will have to learn

You say you created the oceans
You say you created all land
Ans as an end to your workin'
You say you created the Man
How can you say you're almighty
Your creatures are livin' in shame
You did not create love and kindness
And you threw the blame on my name

[CHORUS]

[1 &amp; 2 + CHORUS out.]
