Blood and destruction is all that I can see in this hell
The power of evil destroying my life in a spell
My soul in on fire it feels like I'm burnin' in hell
Bells are ringin' they toolin' my final farewell

Come with me
come with me
Come with me
Into the universe

Vultures are waiting to rip of the flesh of my face
Escaping the devil escaping the whole human race
My body is polluted I gotta get out of this place
I'm leaving tonight cos I gotta get into the space

A world of illusion with no one there to fight
A world without people could that be right
Got to get my soul away from there
Before life on earth it will disappear

We're ready to leave by the darkness
Setting our sails to the sun
Ready to leave by the darkness
Making our self-chosen ones
Nothing con stop us tonight
Get ready to move out of sight
We're leaving your all alive
