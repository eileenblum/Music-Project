Iron arms are knockin' you down
Metal machines destroy your town
Eyes of steel ignore your prayers
Metal machines control your ways

Computer brains they steal your life
Metal machines provoke a fight
Eyes of steel accept no lies
Metal machines allow no crimes

We are too blind to see
What tomorrow would be
We were too blind to know
What tomorrow would show

Iron arms create your world
Metal machines decide your girl
Eyes of steel ignore your prayers
Metal machines control your ways
