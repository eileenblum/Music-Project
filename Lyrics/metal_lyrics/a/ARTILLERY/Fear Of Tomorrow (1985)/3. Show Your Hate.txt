Terror, horror and death - tonight your victim shall die
Pain, torture and fear - your knife is waiting for blood

[1.]
Get out there and destroy - the ones that haunt your dreams
Get out there without mercy - cut them down to pieces
Steel, power and blood - tonight you're escaping from Hell
Evil, savage and wild - hate is controlling your mind

[2.]
Feeling the bad times again - do not want it to last
Now you're revenging your pain - playing the master of Evil

[CHORUS:]
Looser - let it out
Looser - it's time to kill
Looser - show your... HATE
Screams from your victim - He's suffering
Blood on your hands - you're a killer

[3.]
What do you feel are you proud
Delivering your soul to the Evil
Now you've got what you want
There's peace in your mind for a while

[4.]
How do you feel - released
At least for a couple of nights
