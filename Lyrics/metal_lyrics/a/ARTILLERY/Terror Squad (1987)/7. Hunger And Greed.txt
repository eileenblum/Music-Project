You want it all, nothing you give
Searchin' for more is why you live
Your goal is to gain you cause others pain
 Makes you feel well
It's in your head, a sick belief
How come you're never feelin' grief
Your goal is to gain you cause others pain
 Makes you swell

You're searchin' for fortune and fame
But no-one remember your name
Driven by hunger and greed
Your pleasure is others defeat

No limits here, don't ask me why
But when will your mind be satisfied
You reap what you saw what you saw you don't know
Only time will tell
Head in the sky, you're aimin' higher
But only you're a laugh
You reap what you saw what you saw you don't know
King for a day !!

You're searchin' for fortune and fame
But no-one remember your name
Driven by hunger and greed
Your pleasure is others defeat

What you have you have - lying stop lying
What you want you take - dying denying
What you had you left  - lying stop lying
What you left you lost - dying denying

No limis here, don't ask me why
But when will your mind be satisfied
Your goal is to gain you cause others pain
Makes you feel well
It's in your head, a sick belief
How come you're never feelin' grief
Your goal is to gain you cause others pain
Makes you swell

You're searchin' for fortune and fame
But no-one remember your name
Driven by hunger and greed
Your pleasure is others defeat

Monstrocity - they imitate  our lifes
Deformity - caused by impreeding
Brutality - affirmed by the law
Stupidity - costed mutations

Continually - they disregard our lifes
Inhumanity - ignoring our feelings
Dishonesty - they tell us we're alive
For Safety - confirmed under pressure

From Testtube to womb a new life beginning
Sterile injected but doomed to be freak
Experiment with life genetic confusion
With Science as weapon perfection to seek

Before - we lived life in pleasure
We loved - we had natural births
In blood - we pay for our weakness
We are - at war with Science.
