Polution has caused destruction of life
We are warned by Nature ignore it and die
Chemical warfare, Nuclear attack
All causes changes of what's after that

The positive research once made by the Science
Has been turned against as by the Authority
Once a free Planet now trapped in this Nightmare
Where success was expected a failure to be

Before - we lived life in pleasure
We loved - we had natural births
In blood - we pay for our weakness
We are - at war with Science

From Testtube to womb a new life beginning
Sterile injected but doomed to be freak
Experiment with life genetic confusion
With Science as weapon perfection to seek

Before - we lived life in pleasure
We loved - we had natural births
In blood - we pay for our weakness
We are - at war with Science
