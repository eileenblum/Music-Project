Fear of tomorrow - we're waiting for the final crash
The lost illusion - there ain't no light for us to see

Our gods commandments - we once forgot and threw away
Humiliating - our lifes on earth will fade away

A hopeless challenge - we're on our knees
Time's getting nearer
We thought we were wise but we cannot survive on this earth

We challenged nature - we made it fall instead of rise
Our mighty empire - is surely built on sinkin' ground

A hopeless challenge - we're on our knees
Time's getting nearer
We thought we were wise but we cannot survive on this earth

Innocent dreams turned to nightmare
Palace of glass, turned to dust
Day turned to night, don't you care
Life turned to death, forever lost.
