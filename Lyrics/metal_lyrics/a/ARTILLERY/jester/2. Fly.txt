Lost in time, fear has got it's grasp on you
Did no crime
But now you're torn in thousand pieces
Lyin' scattered as you look around
Feels as if your lyin' on the ground
Finally, knowin' there's no hope for you
Let it be, there is nothing you can do
Maybe you will understand it now
Maybe someday they will teach you how

Fly why don't you fly
Leave it all behind
Spread your wings (and)

Take charge of your life, let no one else decide
Take nothing for granted, there's no second time
How you feel, is not a question here
It's for real, can't make it disappear
