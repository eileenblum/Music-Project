[Bonus track]

We came by sea and through the air
Our troops are everywhere
Lies are spread by foreign gods
We can not be controlled

We will win this moral fight
Marching on to your delight
It a world of hate and fear
We will conquer you will disappear

Called upon by a wicked sound
Plant the flag in holy ground
Blood and thunder in the night
The battle has begun

We will survive and stand our ground
Freedom of speech is sacred to us
Condemned into eternity
We will not give in

You can't tell us what to do
What to be seen depend on the eye
Ignorance takes many forms
We will draw what we want

Warhead - Violent bloodsheet
Warhead - Violent demise
