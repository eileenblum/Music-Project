When you're lying in your bed at night
And pray that no harm can be done
I am inside your head, I am inside your room

I'm the voice that you will hear

Inside the dark I'm in control
The noise that you hear is so eerie and cold
The master of strings pulling your mind
Twisting and turning your soul is intwined

Outside the world so easy and calm
You feel that there's no one to do you no harm
Mistakes that you make not easy to hide
It's only a matter of time (be) fore you die

So you start to scream !
Wishing this was a dream !

Not a nightmare
Welcome to your life
Not a nightmare
Walking on the edge of a knife
Not a nightmare
Wake up to your life
Not a nightmare
Living on the edge of a knife

The dark will come to you at night !
Devour your soul devour your life !

Now you're lying in your bed again
And know that the sandman's your friend
He is inside your room he is inside your head

He's the voice that you will hear
