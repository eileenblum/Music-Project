[Bonus track]

See the old man walking crippled and confused
The lines on his forehead he's torn and wiped and used
When he stops and stares at you send shivers down your spine
Ready to go down into his grave today

The more he sees the pain

See the old man frowning a smile so full of glee
The lines on his forehead burns deeper than the sea
Body like an animal wounded and in decay
Ready for his evil of blood and bread and wine

The more he sees....

When death marched in on you
So slowly and forlorn
The maker rattles the cage a new life is born

See the dead man rising from his grave
The scars on his face the sign of things to come
When he stops and points at you, send shivers down your spine
Ready for his evil of blood and bread and wine
