Talking all your nonsense
A child so full of lies
Mindless dumb and stupid
Worthless alibis
All this propaganda
All these wicked games
The patterns on your back
Say you're an ego maniac

Self righteous little wormman
Creating your own truth
Trying to be what you are not
A forgotten misspent youth
Starting up a fire
To provocate a war
Sitting in your sandbox
Acting like a whore

Don't tell me your
Sandbox child philosophy
Don't tell me
You cannot be believed
Don't tell me your
Sandbox child philosophy
Don't tell me
Your lies will be your grave

Terror and lies
You dare not to fight
This is an open invitation to war
Terror and lies
You dare not to fight
One of us is gonna die!
...and it won't be me

You're better left in silence
You're better left alone
No one wants to play with you
Come down from your throne
Your words they have no meaning
Foolish empty whine
Hiding behind your computer
Another asshole standing in line
