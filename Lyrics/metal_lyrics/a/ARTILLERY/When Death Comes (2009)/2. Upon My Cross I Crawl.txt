[Verse 1:]
in this world of sinners
I am set to rescue you all
my name is salvation
follow me now and worship my call

in this world of liars
my name is whispered by those with no faith
I can be forgiven
speak my name, it's never too late

[Bridge:]
but I am so tired of love revenge is what I need

[Chorus:]
feeling trapped inside my cage
The tensions boiling I'm filled with rage
I can never go back to what
I never was before
please forgive me farther hear
I'm not the image you hold so dear
electrified crucified
upon my cross I crawl, and die

[Verse 2:]
agony is rising
inside the holyman made from hell
symphony of angels
tempting me in my lonely cell

to end this new beginning
I must turn the cross upside down
sacrifice is vital
I throw my crown down to the ground

[Chorus]

The lats days are here
the fallen of the sun
caress my soul
I will not believe in you

[Repeat verse 1]

[Chorus]
