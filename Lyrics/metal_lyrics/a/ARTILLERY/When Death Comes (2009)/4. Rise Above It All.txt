No talk no bullshit no more fooling around
Dismiss all that you're saying
On our journey we're bound
Same lies the same babble
No truth in your words
Your ways and bad attitude
Stick it up where it hurts

We're calling for justice
We're rolling the ball
We will rise above it all

Time to turn on the power time to get into gear
This moment will last forever
There's no reason to fear
Rise up to the challenge
See the phoenix bird fly
Soaring high like an eagle
Always catching your eye

We will rise!
