When the night comes down,
Everyone asleep
I step inside my dream,
Delusion

Where I'm so unique
Can rule the world
You know there's no retreat
Delusion

Where I'm everything
Where I'm king

There's no turning back,
Things are outta' control
The dream that never leaves,
Delusion

You can interfere
With my attitude
So just don't show your fear,
Delusion

I shall be king
Bells will ring

Delusions of grandeur
Might be what I need
Delusions of grandeur
Might be what we need

Through the barriers,
That was before
I crawl out of my dream,
Delusion

Should I stay awake,
Or will I give in?
When nothing's what it seems,
Delusion

I feel everything,
I feel real

Delusions of grandeur,
Might be what I need
Delusions of grandeur
Might be what we need

I feel anger rise,
The dream that never dies
The truth is yet to find,
Trapped inside my mind

Delusions of grandeur
Might just be what I need
