Screaming through the night you wake up from your nightmare
To face the frightening fact that everything is true
Something in the dark waiting for you to move
Then suddenly it strikes and you are lost forevermore

You don't know who's your friends --
You don't know where to turn
Just learn to shut your mouth and don't make waves
It's hiding everywhere -- could be your neighbour
Who keeps the country clean so face the facts or it's goodbye

Uniform -- public servant number one -- uniform
Uniform -- playing with his daddy's gun

Uniform -- public servant number one -- uniform
Uniform -- playing with his daddy's gun

Life can be a bitch if you don't know the answers
And you don't wanna fit a sick society
Something they call wealth is justified by egos
But nothing's worth the fact
That you will give your soul away

Uniform -- public servant number one -- uniform
Uniform -- playing with his daddy's gun
