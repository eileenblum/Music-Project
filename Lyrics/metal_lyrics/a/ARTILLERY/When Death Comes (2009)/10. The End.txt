I sit in silence and watch the world go by
And then I'm knowing that very soon will die
Been here for ages and now the time has come
And everything I love will be dead and gone

Eyes wide open to reality
Getting closer immortality

Close the drapes!
Kiss the hate!
Nurse the pain!

Hatred building up inside his head
This monster is for real alive and sad

When I look up to the sky
I see the world is turning
Down on earth it seems to me we live in fear
When I see a blood red sky
I know the world is burning
Then it's time to realize
The end is near

The fire is burning
Your world stopped turning
Your body is hurting
Infinite pain

Voices are screaming
Can't wake from dreaming
Someone is lurking
In the pitch black dark

There's a war going on inside
And there's nowhere left for you to hide
