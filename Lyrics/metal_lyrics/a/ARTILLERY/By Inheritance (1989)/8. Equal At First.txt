When young
There's so many questions to ask
You grow and you have learn things so fast
As kid, everything looks like a dream
Somehow, dreams are not what they seem

You need the learnin'
You need to to know
There is but one way that you can go

At school, there's so many words to be read
You fool, nothing is learned from your bed
Don't you know we're all equal at first
You'll feel, the lack of knowledge like thirst

You talk, but your words they don't make no sense
Why try, when you are not feelin' no tense
You'll flunk, your effort is layin' too low
You punk, you're just too stupid to know
