Human, I can read your mind
Stranger, from the edge of time

Watcher, water's running deep
Seer, when your eyes don't weep
Clear your thoughts
Ease your mind

Don't believe a word
Unless it's proven true
You might just catch a spell
Damnation upon you

Teacher, learnin' from the card
Preacher, lovin' you is so damn hard
And the tales, that you tell

Liar, your brain is runnin' wild
Crier, elemental child
Sinner, playin' with your thoughts
Winner, are you feeling lost?

Solve the maze
Case the haze
