Caught in war time
Trapped forever
Hope for justice
Never, never
In the wrong place
At the wrong time
All your pleading
No one gives a damn.

Lost forever
Thrown away
No one helps you
Time to start to pray.

Left to rot there
Not forgotten
They will call for
Doctor Rotten
He can make you
Tell your story
Even if there's non to tell.

Try to stop it
Tell the truth
Get much deeper
It's hopeless - Hopeless.

Pain
Torture
Breakdown
Alive
Dead
No difference.

You're already - Already doomed
But the doctor hasn't finished yet
Your just living - Just a living wreck
But the doctor hasn't finished yet.

Pain
Torture
Breakdown
Alive
Dead
No difference.

You don't want to mess
With Doctor Evil
He'll make your life a living hell
He'll never stop his endless torture
Manipulates all you cells. 

Caught in war time
Trapped forever
Hope for justice

Lost forever
Thrown away
No one helps you

Time to start to pray.

You're damned - Damned if you talk
And damned - Damned
If you don't
Hopeless situation
You're damned - Damned if you talk.

Pain
Torture
Breakdown
Alive
Dead
No difference.

You don't want to mess
With Doctor Evil
He'll make your life a living hell
He'll never stop his endless torture
Manipulates all you cells.
