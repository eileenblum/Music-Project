Chill my bones!

I see the staring eyes â windows of your soul
Ghost of winters bite â feelings pierce you cold
Where there was reason and hope â all is gone
No longer will the ice breach â no warmth from the sun
From the sun

Deserts of crystal dust â ghosts in the snow
Voices in the air â whispers that you know
Caught in the blizzard, a frozen statue stands
Desperate eyes seeking â a fate of unmoving hands

[Solo: Michael]
[Solo: Morten]

Chill my bones â Burn my flesh
Chill my bones â Burn my flesh

[Solo: Morten]
[Solo: Michael]

Chill my bones â Burn my flesh
Chill my bones â Burn my flesh

Burn my flesh!

These might just be the last words I say
In the water down the fractures of my name
But I feel the fire that sears my soul
The scorching heat of anger, making me truly whole
Make me whole

Chill my bones â Burn my flesh
Chill my bones â Burn my flesh
