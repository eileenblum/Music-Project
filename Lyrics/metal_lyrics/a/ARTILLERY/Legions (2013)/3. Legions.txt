[Solo: Morten]

Handgrenade ballgame, count to 10 and a sec
Bombs they are blowing get ready to feel sick

Napalm rain, acid tears to boil your blood
TMG rhythm, assures the beating of a heart

Pay allegiance
Praise defiance
Become the Legions
Join the Legions

Molotov cocktail, they scrum and brawl in a bar
But thereâs one weapon that will rule out by far

Pay allegiance
Praise defiance
Become the Legions
Join the Legions

Get armed and get ready â a finger on the trigger
A taste for devastation, find a gun that is bigger
Get armed and get ready â a finger on the trigger
A taste for devastation, find a gun that is bigger

Join the fight
Donât look back
March to war
With your soul

[Solo: Michael]

Tiger tank parade, legs march in line
Run for your life â a bullet will find you in time
Canons are firing, machinegun symphony
Bodies crushed and driving with heavy artillery
