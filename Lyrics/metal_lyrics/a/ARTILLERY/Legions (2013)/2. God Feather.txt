Godfeather

I see you going down â going down alone
Expect to be the saved â saved on your own
You reap as you have sown â sown on barren land
What kind of road have you paved?

Those pathetic words cling so hollow
No one really cares for
Who it hurts
Just an inner demon
That you follow

Godfeather

[Backing solo: Michael]

Blame me on anything â anything you see
Itâs only down to one â only yourself
Make the world an enemy â an enemy inside
What you really are you hide

Those pathetic words cling so hollow
No one really cares for
Who it hurts
Just an inner demon
That you follow

[Solo: Morten]

Scared to death â what can make you fly?
No marble law â when you gonna die
God wonât give you â give you any wings
Try to fly â to see the shimmering
Scared to death â what can make you fly?
No marble law â when you gonna die
God wonât give you â give you any wings
Not a single thing!

[Solo: Michael]

Scared to death â what can make you fly?
No marble law â when you gonna die
God wonât give you â give you any wings
Try to fly â to see the shimmering
Scared to death â what can make you fly?
No marble law â when you gonna die
God wonât give you â give you any wings
Not a single thing!
