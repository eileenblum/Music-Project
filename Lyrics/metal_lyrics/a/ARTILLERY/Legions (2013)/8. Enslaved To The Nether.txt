Worms are crawling
Forth from my chest
I reach at them, escape my grasp
My flesh is dangling â dangling from my arms
Alive and dead, putrid eyes alarmed.

Inside my head
Itâs forever
I feel enslaved
To the nether
Inside my mind
It says never enslaved â To the nether.

Since whenever have I stopped breathing
A nightmare inside in which I am wreathing.

Inside my head
Itâs forever
I feel enslaved
To the nether
Inside my mind
It says never enslaved â To the nether.

Dead man walking, foul words talking
A festering corpse, rotten and vile.

The final night, will you ever know
That everyday feels like hell.

I awake from the dream
Covered in sweat
In a vision of death â The death of me.

Inside my head
Itâs forever
I feel enslaved
To the nether
Inside my mind
It says never
Inside my head
Itâs forever
I feel enslaved
To the nether
Inside my mind
It says never
Enslaved â To the nether.
