This is the end, end of times
No more prophetic lies
Fate of doom in the sky
No more false alibis.

No more alibis, no more.

But as closure is another curtain
One thing you know for certain
A dawn will come from destruction
Mortal reconstruction.

Mortal reconstruction, mortal.

Anno requiem â Death comes home again
Anno requiem â Last rite chant again
Anno requiem â Death comes home again
Anno requiem â Time will never be the same.

Apocalyptic smoke fills our lungs
False tales twists our tongues
We canât accept our demise
We rather cling to our lies.

We rather cling to our lies 
We rather cling.

Anno requiem â Death comes home again
Anno requiem â Last rite chant again
Anno requiem â Death comes home again
Anno requiem â Time will never be the 
Time will never be the
Time will never be the same
Again.
