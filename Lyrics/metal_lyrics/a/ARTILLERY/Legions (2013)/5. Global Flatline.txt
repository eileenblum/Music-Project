A storm is coming and it will bury your life
Our neglect of mother nature will end in strife
Our world shall implode as we suck it dry
No care for tomorrow, regardless we will die.

Our seas will flood cities and land
The knife at our throats âtill we understand.

The forest will burn and we choke in the fire
No more air for us breathe â we hang in a wire.

Global flatline
Justice will come in time
Global flatline
Without us the world would be fine.

Global flatline
Justice in time.

You fly your life on broken wings
You see right nothing, only the little things.

Global flatline
Justice in time.
You fly your life on broken wings
You see right nothing, only the little things.

The skies on fire, flood and tsunami
The prospects of our future is quite alarming.

Now we wonât stop and never believe
That we were the cause, ourselves we deceive.

Global flatline
Justice will come in time
Global flatline
Without us the world would be fine.
