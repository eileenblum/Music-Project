It is the Ethos of Wrath
Ethos of wrath.

Can you recognize the eyes?
They stare when you look away
The one behind the lies that smile
A hand on your shoulder at the end of the day.

Make your blood boil
Make your eyes see red
Make your blood boil
Make your eyes see red.

Alone in your room, right behind your back
Something's breathing there, ready to attack
It seems like someone that you know
He talks in your ear, say where you must go.

Make your blood boil
Make your eyes see red
Make your blood boil
Make your eyes see red.

It's got your back - It is the Ethos of Wrath
Leads to attack - It is the Ethos of Wrath
It's got your back - It is the Ethos of Wrath
Leads to attack - It is the Ethos of Wrath.

Blackout rule and your head is a mess
Where you were your mind forgets
Your body sore, tired to the bone
A body in a closet, no longer alone.

Make your blood boil
Make your eyes see red
Make your blood boil
Make your eyes see red.

It's got your back - It is the Ethos of Wrath
Leads to attack - It is the Ethos of Wrath
It's got your back - Ethos of Wrat - It is the Ethos of Wrath
Leads to attack - Ethos of Wrath - It is the Ethos of Wrath.
