I can feel it pounding in my chest
It's throbbing in my temples
I hear hammering thunder in my ears
My whole body trembles

Anger
Anger on the wind
Bliss
Blissfully nauseous
Joy
Joyfully chagrinned
Crestfallen angel smiles

I force onto my way of life
Don't you try to call me back
It boils in my blood, sears in my veins
I wrath I have become

Free
Free on rampage
Sin
I'm happy in sin
Burned
Burned and wasted
A new law has come to town

[2x]
War drum heartbeat
You feel it coming on
War drum heartbeat
Bring the hammer down

[2x]
Face it, blood is law
Make it, never seen before
Force it down their throats
Make it their law

Now it's calling me like an elixir
Elixir of venom
Laughter should be, be a frown
But it's all hollowed out

Anger
Anger on the wind
Bliss
Blissfully nauseous
Joy
Joyfully chagrinned
Crestfallen angel smiles

[2x]
War drum heartbeat
You feel it coming on
War drum heartbeat
Bring the hammer down

[2x]
Face it, blood is law
Make it, never seen before
Force it down their throats
Make it their law
