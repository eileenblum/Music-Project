I sit down on my ass, then I turn on my PC
Diagnostics, virus-scan, I have to wait and see
Then my set-up tells me, that itâs OK to come in
Everything is alright, my session can begin

I hook up on the Internet, I sit and chat a while
I find someone I think I know, though Iâve never seen her smile
Itâs getting kinda personal, my feelings are involved
Sheâs coming home to me, man, my problems could be solved

World Wide Web
World Wide Web

Triple W, Iâm in love with you
Youâre my friend when the day is through
Tell me what to do, to make you love me too
I just canât survive without you

She tells me all the things, that she would like to do to me
She urges me to buy a web-cam, so we can see
I rush down to the store, to buy the hardware I need
I hurry back, I link it up, I set to highest speed

Triple W, Iâm in love with you
Youâre my friend when the day is through
Tell me what to do, to make you love me too
I just canât survive without you

Triple W, Iâm in love with you
Youâre my friend when the day is through
Tell me what to do, to make you love me too
I just canât survive without you

Oh no, sheâs a he!
What Went Wrong?
