Take you life, Iâm gonna take your life
Homicide, letâs make it genocide

Run and hide, why donât you run and hide
Step aside, why donât you step aside

Searching for a victim, anyone will do
If you donât stay inside tonight, my victim could be you
Iâm not selective, I donât care, just wanna see you die
Iâm out there on the streets tonight, so kiss your ass goodbye

See if you can take the heat
Iâm not the therapy you need
The urge inside, Iâve gotta feed
Spawn from a violent breed

See you die, I wanna see you die
Ask me why, donât ever ask me why

Searching for a victim, anyone will do
If you donât stay inside tonight, my victim could be you
Iâm not selective, I donât care, just wanna see you die
Iâm out there on the streets tonight, so kiss your ass goodbye

See if you can take the heat
Iâm not the therapy you need
The urge inside, Iâve gotta feed
Spawn from a violent breed
