You bend it, you shape it, you squeeze and then you rape it
You just donât know what you really do
For money, for power, each minute of the hour
You just canât see that your lie shines through

A legend, a story, a fight for love and glory
Takes place all the time, according to the news
A picture, a photo, a close-up or a total
You just donât care if a victim dies on you

A killer, a rapist, a dangerous escapist
Youâd rather see the story, than see the justice to be done
A boozer, a junkie, a sex-molested monkey
I just donât get it, is something wrong with you?

A winner, a sinner, a big expensive dinner
There is no end to your lack of common sense
A warzone, a dryzone, got people out of their home

A kill, a thrill, you donât care if you lie
You have to sell, to keep your job alive
As cold as ice, you donât care if they cry
Thereâs no remorse, even when they die

Itâs on the streets, the press is loose
Everytime the day breaks through
The news today will make its way
And somehow find its way to you

A model, a rock star, the wrecking of a fast car
You get more famous when youâre dying on the news
A hijack, a stockcrack, a politicianâs sexlack

A kill, a thrill, you donât care if you lie
You have to sell, to keep your job alive
As cold as ice, you donât care if they cry
Thereâs no remorse, even when they die

Itâs on the streets, the press is loose
Everytime the day breaks through
The news today will make its way
And somehow find its way to you
