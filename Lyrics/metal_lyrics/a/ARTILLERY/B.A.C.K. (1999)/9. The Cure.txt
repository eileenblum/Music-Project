Look at me, itâs plain to see, that Iâm no longer here
Can you find me?
They took it all away from me, my mind is out somewhere

They analyze my every move, they strap me to this bed
Set me free
They want to do a lobotomy, they want to cure my head

Drain the pressure from my brain
Suck the juice from me
Sane, Iâll never be again
So tell me what you see

They tell me Iâm no longer fit to live my life out there
Decide for me
Pacified, neutralized, so Iâm staying here

Drain the pressure from my brain
Suck the juice from me
Sane, Iâll never be again
So tell me what you see
