Think about what you would do, if all predictions should come true
If we were meant to be erased, to disappear without a trace
Nature tells us everywhere, soon weâre running out of air
The resources are running dry, we donât even fucking try

Canât you see weâre running loose, when all we have to do is choose
Letâs not make our children pay, millions die everyday
Poisoned by the food they eat, canât even get a chunk of meat
The water in the well ran dry, so all that we can do is die

Blowing up the world
Anarchy unfurled
Chaos, mayhem, greed
Killing our own breed

Brought to sudden death
As the Prophet said
Coming from behind
Killing our own kind

We toy with toxic pollution, we play with nuclear fusion
Take a look around, itâs everywhere you see
We breathe it, we taste it, weâre getting slowly wasted
There must be something somebody can do

It vital, itâs crucial, itâs motherfucking fatal
We heave to stop or we will erase ourselves
The men with the power, sitting in their towers
We have to stop them, on no-one will survive

We have to realized our fate, we have to move, itâs not too late
It takes the help of everyone, there is much working to be done
The human race must change its course, must saddle up another horse
If we donât do, the human race will disappear without a trace

Blowing up the world
Anarchy unfurled
Chaos, mayhem, greed
Killing our own breed

Brought to sudden death
As the Prophet said
Coming from behind
Killing our own kind

Blowing up the world
Anarchy unfurled
Chaos, mayhem, greed
Killing our own breed

Brought to sudden death
As the Prophet said
Coming from behind
Killing our own kind
