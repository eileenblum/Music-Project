Why tell - these lies - everyone will see right through
That Hell - those cries - changing with the weather
Once out â then back â and now youâve got a chance to show
Youâre weak â youâll crack â you know what itâs all about

Youâve seen â it all â nothing here to raise a brow
Could not â be worse â so try to make it better
No choice â no way â as a person you must grow
Within â yourself â lies the answer

You fight â you bleed â you know it ainât no use
You crave â you need â all you can do is lose
You cry â you whine â you are a sad excuse
You fight â you bleed â you know it ainât no use
You crave â you need â all you can do is lose
You cry â you whine â you are a sad excuse
Youâre out of the trash

Canât wait â no more â have to find a passage through
Been here â before â obeyed it to the letter
Your will â is weak â must chance it in a single blow
To break â the chains â that tie you to this place

You fight â you bleed â you know it ainât no use
You crave â you need â all you can do is lose
You cry â you whine â you are a sad excuse
You fight â you bleed â you know it ainât no use
You crave â you need â all you can do is lose
You cry â you whine â you are a sad excuse
You're out of the trash
