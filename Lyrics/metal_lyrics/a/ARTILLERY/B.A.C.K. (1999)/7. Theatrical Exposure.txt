I turn on my TV
I get on my knees
And pray for a good show tonight

But what do I see?
Abnormality
I must get it out of my sight

This bad feeling in me
Comes from what I see
Iâm watching a talkshow tonight

This hostâs doing her best
At making her guests
Exposing their demons to light

You pathetic, donât you know?
Appearing on the show
Showing your perversion really makes you go

Minorities will come alive
Men cheating on their wives
Degenerates of any kind
Theatrical exposure

Minorities will come alive
Men cheating on their wives
Degenerates of any kind
Theatrical exposure
Theatrical exposure

So now you have shown
The world of your own
Youâre sick and itâs plain to see

Ten minutes of fame
They mention your name
Now anything goes on TV

You pathetic, donât you know?
Appearing on the show
Showing your perversion really makes you go

Minorities will come alive
Men cheating on their wives
Degenerates of any kind
Theatrical exposure

Minorities will come alive
Men cheating on their wives
Degenerates of any kind
Theatrical exposure
Theatrical exposure
