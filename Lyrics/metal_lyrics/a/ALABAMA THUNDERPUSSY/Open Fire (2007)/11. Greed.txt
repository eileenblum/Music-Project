Uncounted millions living the dream
Some things just aren't quite what they seem
Drowned in temptations
Black hearts turned ill
Insatiable, can't get their fill

From deep within the pits of sin, a hunger calls to feed
While children sleep, the devil creeps and pumps you full of greed

Unholy millions living a lie and tell it straight into their eyes
God bless the victims and cure the lame
Sometimes they are one and the same

Now greed has gripped your heart
Inner conflict has you torn apart
So goes diseases of the soul
Harbingers of your fate laughing at you 'cause they know it's too late
Your future sealed, the bell does toll
