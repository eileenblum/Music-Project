Got to change, this life's a bore 
You might just get what you're asking for 
I said before that I spoke the truth 
I thank you for your paper trail of proof 

Time will reveal how the righteous wrong 
How they conceal with a forked tongue 
Cherish the words of the dying man 
Only fools compromise themselves 

Greener grass on other hills 
Happiness is not a pill 
With damages done, one should not grieve 
The door hits your ass when you leave 

Time will reveal how the righteous wrong 
How they conceal with a forked tongue 
Cherish the words of the dying man 
Only fools compromise themselves

And you know just when you've hit the bottom 
When your children forget your name

Got to change for what's in store 
God knows we are all deserving more 
I said before that I spoke the truth 
I thank you for your paper trail of proof

Time will reveal how the righteous wrong 
How they conceal with a forked tongue 
Cherish the words of the dying man 
Only fools compromise themselves
