Pistols scream
God's mysteries
Semi-automatic on a lunatic spree
Plagued by birth
Fault of the Earth
Castigate the falsifier with a lead scourge

Sins of the father
Broken by man
Voices exhorting beckon the plan
Taking no hostage; open fire

Duct tape dread
The living dead
Execution style to the back of the head
Lives defiled
mother and child
Evil assailant so turned on and wild, showing mercy for no one and none shall survive
How many times can a childhood be blamed for these actions contrived?
God went away
Spectres arriving to expropriate

Sins of the father
Broken by man
Voices exhorting beckon the plan
Taking no hostage; open fire

Emissary of Abaddon
Black rage sins define
Reprobate hellion
Enchanting angels' minds
Tempt them with a succubus
Conceive hell's uprise
Blood stains the streets of ill desire
Assassins aim and open fire

Dispatching penalty 
Bricks bathe skulls and bones
Inverted crucifix tattooed upon their souls
Hag woman cackling, acknowledging their fate
Waiting for just a taste from lord Satan's plate
To buy the prize, you sold your soul
Charon awaits the ferry's toll
Blood stains the streets of ill desire
Assassins aim and open fire
