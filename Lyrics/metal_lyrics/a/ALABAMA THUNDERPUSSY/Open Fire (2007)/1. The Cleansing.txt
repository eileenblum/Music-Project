Pulses are rising, creatures are dying
Hollywood can't paint these skies
Stenches that linger as Death licks his fingers
Invoking the floods and the fires
Somewhere the sky is beautiful and forgiving
Where are the days before she came to the cleansing?

Evacuations, Earths desecration reverting to bedlam by night
Nature reveals changes oh so surreal
How we've taken for granted this life
Somewhere the sky is beautiful and forgiving
Where are the days before she came to the cleansing?

In the pool of destruction
Swimming with a hungry shark where the bodies litter the shore
Danger cuts across the fields
Leaving mounds of of debris so torn
Souring the path of all 
I fear the wrath of the woman scorned
All have seen her
Deaths dealer
Flushing all peace away
