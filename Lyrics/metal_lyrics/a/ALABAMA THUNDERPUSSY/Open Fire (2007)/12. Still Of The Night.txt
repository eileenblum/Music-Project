[originally by Whitesnake]In the Still of the Night I hear the wolf howl sniffing around your door
In the Still of the Night I feel my heart beating heavy telling me I gotta have more
In the shadow of night I see the full moon rise telling me what's in store,
My heart start aching my body start a shaking and I can't take no more
Now I just want to get close to you and taste your love so sweet
And I just want to make love to you feel your body heat
In the Still of the Night In the Still of the Night over here

In the heat of the day I hang my head down low and hide my face from the sun
Through the light of the day until the evening time I'm waiting for the night to come
In the Still of the Night In the cool moonlight
I feel heart is aching In the Still of the Night
Tell me here

In the Still of the Night I hear the wolf howl sniffing around your door
In the Still of the Night I feel my heart beating heavy telling me I gotta have more
In the shadow of night I see the full moon rise telling me what's in store,
My heart start aching my body start a shaking and I can't take no more
Now I just want to get close to you and taste your love so sweet
And I just want to make love to you feel your body heat
In the Still of the Night Still of the Night Still of the Night Still of the Night
