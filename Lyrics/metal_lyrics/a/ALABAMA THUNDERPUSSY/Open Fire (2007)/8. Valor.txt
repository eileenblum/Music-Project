We fight tonight beneath the jet filled skies
Terror and courage cannot be disguised
Remember family to dull the pain 
The battle's over, yet the war remains

I've given up my dreams
Now you protest and scream
Freedoms you gain are born when good folks die
Even if it's not right, with valor I shall fight
Just help me see the new sunrise

Distrust the enemy with cunning guile
Protect perimeters with no denial
Is my baby safe outside my hand?
And is her heart inside another man?

I've given up my dreams
Now you protest and scream
Freedoms you gain are born when good folks die
Even if it's not right, with valor I shall fight
Just help me see the new sunrise

The stakes are high
I must not die
My chid is all I see
Strong shall survive
I am alive
But now the enemy's stalking me

We die tonight beneath the jet filled skies
The terror overtakes our blood filled eyes
Remember family despite the pain
The battle's over yet the war remains
