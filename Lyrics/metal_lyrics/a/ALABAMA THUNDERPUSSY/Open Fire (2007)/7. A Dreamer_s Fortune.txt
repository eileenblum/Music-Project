Casting shame upon the malefactors is dilution of all their foul play
Also-rans begrudge the titleholder
If you don't cheat you're destined to fail

Dreamers spend their fortunes before they wake
Underdogs become impostors for the accolades

Gracious smile now shakes the hand of triumph
Clean your wounds and head on to brood despair
It's hard to breathe staring at your blue ribbon on the mantle of another's lair

Dreamers spend their fortunes before they wake
Underdogs become impostors for the accolades
I want to taste redemption before my wake
Gotta be the titleholder before I hit my grave 

Green in the eyes of the hungry
Green pockets of the great
Green is the vain imposter
Green grass above my grave
