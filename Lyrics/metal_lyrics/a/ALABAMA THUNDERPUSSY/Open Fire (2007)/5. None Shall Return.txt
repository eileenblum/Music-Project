Strung high above the trees
Discord and entropy
Incessant banter's got me full of spite

I've got no patience, got no time
Misguided shoves
Remove your gloves
Dismiss the warning and you're gonna learn
None shall return

Coiled up and poised to strike
Jackasses are alike
Somehow it seems they breed in overtime

I've got no reason to be kind
You're talking tough
I've had enough
The day our paths do cross you're gonna learn
None shall return

Your insolence now jades
I'll rain on your parade
But you won't step outside
Small dogs without much bite should stay inside at night and bark behind the door
Apologies so weak and frequent that they reek of insincerity

A population that's so vile and base
Eradicating moral code
Their legacy no more than commonplace
Tonight the worthless breed is overthrown
