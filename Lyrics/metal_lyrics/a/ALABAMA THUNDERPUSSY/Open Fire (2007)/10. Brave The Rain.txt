All support the system of denied hypocrisy
Blackened auras justify the selling out of dignity
Set the stage, manipulation the double-dealers sow
Kiss of Judas on my soul
Look out below

Bitter winds are blowing
Freeze the rain upon your back
It's so hard to walk alone in constant fear of their attack
But never mind the barking, for their rotten teeth can't bite
Affectation and decay devour from inside

Pretense and imitation
Birthright of all alive
Some reek of ostentation
Knowing they'll never thrive

Dissimulations posturing behind your cloak
The shameless hands embracing you in facade then slit your throat

Double-dealer from the gutter
Double-dealer from the mire
Take a good, hard look at me now living out what you desire

Underhanded cunning, bastardized duplicity
Leave a bitter taste behind, afterbirth of treachery
Circumvent the subterfuge with vengeance and disdain
Put your boots and jackets on and brave the rain
