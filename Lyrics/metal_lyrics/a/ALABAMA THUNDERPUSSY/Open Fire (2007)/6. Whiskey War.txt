Fists flying, on the run
How whiskey tastes like fun
I've had my back against the stars, face down in mud
Run through the hurricane
Coincidentally felt no pain
Crank up the amplifiers so loud

Don't wanna hear your lip no more
Take on the world
It's Whiskey War

Backcharge the system fast
Cops confiscate your grass then burn it up when they get home
And you're still in jail
Doctors will write the 'scripts
You'll shove 'em past your lips
One legal dealer with a quota

Ain't gonna take that shit no more
Take on the world
It's Whiskey War

Signal towers pushing power overhead
Scam religions, premonitions of the dead
Listen to me, carbon copy wannabe
FUCK YOU

One cannot be what they weren't born to be
Don't take for granted what's your home
I won't pretend I'm aristocracy
I'm just a troop in Whiskey War
