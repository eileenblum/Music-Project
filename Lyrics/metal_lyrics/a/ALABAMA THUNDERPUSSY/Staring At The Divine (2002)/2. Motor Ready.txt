Hold your laughter, soon right after
The facts are brought to our attention
Barely notice what you know best
Which is almost nothing

[Chorus]
Why is there always a reason?
Or something you're your whining about
I've heard the same old story
It's growing extremely boring
See right through your innocence
Nice disguise the excuses
Could have been better, not terrible
For the first try.

Quarts of turmoil dripping quickly
Out of the leaking mouth of yours
Skidding tires, fumes inspire no
Caution flags to prevent the danger

I'll make it easy if that's what you want.
Just hit the highway, when I need you I'll phone.
Don't bother sending any letters to ask if tempers have cooled since the night you left.
I haven't bothered turning the porch light on.
I think it's quite clear this isn't your home anymore.

Who's ever closest I don't notice anyone waiting for your return.
You ought to know this it came from your lips with the rest of the obvious lies
My reactions are distractions for pleasing my own sick humor
Short conversations, complications you've got to watch what you say
This disaster arriving soon twisting the truth with each phase of the moon

Is this what the future holds for me?
Now I've found a certain type of honesty
No make believe or bullshit from you.
