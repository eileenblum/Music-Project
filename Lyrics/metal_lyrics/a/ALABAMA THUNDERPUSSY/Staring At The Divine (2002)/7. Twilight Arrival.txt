A lonely intruder surrounded with emptiness
Screaming silently
A single minute constructed with seconds building to subtract
Pieces of positive matter
Breaking free as it shatters

Twilight arrival leveled dim horizon
Peeking through my window
Desperately watching
Offering some advice I closed the blinds
Sure you come peacefully
If only I knew what was involved

[Chorus]
You'd probably cry a few drops
'Cause I already have
Looked to the sky for a savior
That I never had

Four corners joining holding this structure
Together delicately
Barely awakes while comfort dissolves
Below my angled posture
Visions of a final chapter
A happier ending six pages after

[Chorus-add on]
Swearing there's some kind of heaven above
Yet who really knows?
If something lies outside our souls
I'm sure it's controlled
