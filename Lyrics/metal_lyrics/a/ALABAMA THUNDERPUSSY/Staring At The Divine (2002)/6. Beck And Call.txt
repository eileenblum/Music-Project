Satisfy my tortuous strain
With ease of a simple yes
Magnified to triple the pain
Loves most dangerous test

[Chorus]
Why sacrifice for one who knows
You'll be at her beck and call
Whenever she asks

There isn't a reason to complain
She's only acting for laughs
Pinching nerves pounding buttons
Another loss on your behalf

I find your courtesy
An absolute shame
Take care of yourself
Make her do the same

I'm exhausted
From repeating
My suggestions
Are a waste of breath

Coping with jealousy
Strange stares outside the circle
Creating a scenery
Of hatred from the real you
