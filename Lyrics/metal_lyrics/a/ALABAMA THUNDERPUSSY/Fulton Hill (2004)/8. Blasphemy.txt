One chance to live the dream
Strike now before the dawn
Pierce the night air with a scream
Come on Let's get it on
GIMME SOMETHING
TO TAKE AWAY THE PAIN
GIMME SOMETHING TO BREAK
LET'S GO INSANE
GIMME SOMETHING TO KILL ----
NEED NO EXCUSES
Fist pounding in the air
Raise up the devil's sign
Flying high without a care
Let's go / It's time
GIMME SOMETHING
TO TAKE AWAY THE PAIN
GIMME SOMETHING TO BREAK
LET'S GO INSANE
GIMME SOMETHING TO KILL ----
FEEL LIKE AN ANGEL
FUCKING A DEMON
BURNING DOWN HEAVEN TONIGHT
Sailing the seas
of turpitude and blasphemy
Leak into steam
fogging the brain with metal &amp; weed
Lost in the swirl of sexual hunger
as clothing unfurls
Let's Rock and let's rule
choke on some vomit
and drown in the pool
Drive a nova into a tree
Some idiot just called the fucking police
Wake up next to coyote ugly
Hung over again
Fight 'til you bleed proving again (you're) not a pussy
Drank someone's pee
caught in a trap of hilarity
Freak off the leash over the fence and into the street
Rock hard and ride free
sins of the flesh vested in meat
Wired and weird gnashing of teeth
Poisoned and pasted just underneath
Pass out and go at it some more
Wasting away
BLASPHEMY BLASTS-FOR-ME
