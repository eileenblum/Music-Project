Last night it came upon me.
Got the blues upon sunrise.
As I reached to touch your shoulder, I was struck by the surprise.
You'd packed up your belongings. Stole away into the night.
Nary a sign is left of you here.
Guess I'll lay back down and cry.
Why do they always leave me
Happens just about every time
And I can feel you haunting
Through the back pitch of my mind
There's never been any reason. There's never been a way to explain.
Seems that luck is out of season. Unless it's bad then down it rains.
Growing colder by the minute. Getting hardened by the day.
I'm a lonesome, loathsome creature but I don't want to be that way.
Why do they always leave me
Happens just about every time
And I can feel you haunting
Through the back pitch of my mind
A winter wind chills me to the bone.
Bottle is empty and I still feel alone.
This house is so empty
now that you're gone.
I face the fact that I done you wrong.
Now I see that you had to leave me.
To save yourself and your sanity.
You'll find another
and I pray he's good for you.
Better than I could ever be.
Hope you find just what you need
as I lay right here and bleed Together We will never be.
Through my soul runs stormy rain.
Wrapped up with my old friend pain. Forever.
It's my destiny.
Sometimes I think I know the way
but find myself in a strange land
where I don't know my name.
Left to the dogs, hung out to dry. Wish I could lay right down and die.
I've tried but life's not done with me.
Bye, Bye baby. Baby goodbye.
