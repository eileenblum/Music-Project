BLACKNESS THIS NIGHT IS COMING TO BE
I ARISE AFLAME WITH SURPRISE
DARK NEEDS ASCEND THEN FALL INTO ME
THE MASTER'S CALL
JUST CAN'T BE DENIED
FALL UNTO MY GRACE
BID INTO THE GAME
RECOGNIZE THIS FACE
BUT DON'T SPEAK ALOUD MY NAME
CRAWL FORTH
&amp; WORM THROUGH THE SHADOW
PROWLING CREEP
WITH AN ITCH FOR DEMISE
BLOOD BEAST
BASKING IN THE MOON GLOW
NOT ALONE I'M RIGHT BY YOUR SIDE
FALL UNTO MY GRACE
BID INTO THE GAME
RECOGNIZE THIS FACE
BUT DON'T SPEAK ALOUD MY NAME
NEVER HAD A CHOICE
WHEN NOTHING'S LEFT TO LOSE
HATE FOR SINNER NOT FOR SIN
SOUL IS EASY TO UNLOOSE
FEEL THE COLD HAND GRIP
AWAY THE LIFE FORCE SLIP
DRAGGED ASUNDER AS
CRIMSON SWEET QUELLS
A NEFARIOUS HUNGER
HEED THE SPIRIT CALL
COMMANDS NOT ONE
BUT ALL EYE OF NIGHT GONE BLIND
SO EVIL RUNS FREE
&amp; CLOSES IN FROM BEHIND
MAN FORSAKEN
RENOUNCED &amp; MARKED TO DIE
DEEDS FOR DARKNESS
THE GAME IS IN MOTION.
WENDIGO ARISE.
BOILING OVER
WRATH &amp; RIGHTEOUS RAGE
VENGEFUL SPIRIT
BRINGS HELL TO THE EARTH
AT THE END OF THE AGE
BLACK PITCH THIS NIGHT IS COMING TO BE
THE MASTER'S CALL
JUST CAN'T BE DENIED
