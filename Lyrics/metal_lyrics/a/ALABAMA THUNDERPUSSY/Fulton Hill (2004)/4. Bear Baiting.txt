If it takes too long
Can you give me time?
To make it come alive

I won't be bought
And I can't be sold
And I'm not that old

Broken hands toil on
Take away the ties
Let me see the light

I'm a Black Eyed Dog
And a Ghetto Child
Cut me loose, I'm running wild

Down your diving for a penny
Street smart tough and iron wise
Best of it you bet I'm making
Yet I never have a dime

Brother can you help me
Learn to help myself

This is not a dream
Just the way things be
Fighting for my sanity

Resort to thievery
Just to get on by
'Cause I refuse to live to die

All my friends are dead
Or rotting in a cell
But I'll see them when I get to Hell

Have a drink on me
From this bag of wine
All we have is time

Down your diving for a penny
Streets smart tough and iron wise
Best of it you bet I'm making
Yet I never have a dime

Brother you can't help me
Let me help myself

I ain't the one
You'll never break me see
I'm not the one to taste your treachery

Accuse me now
Right here to my face
I laugh at you and put you in your place

I'll stand my ground / no won't go easy
Oh they stare me down / no I won't go easy
Tear me down / Won't go easy
Bring it on / Won't go easy
I ain't the one
You'll never break me see
I'm not the one to taste your treachery
Accuse me now
Right here to my face
Laugh at you
and put you in your place
