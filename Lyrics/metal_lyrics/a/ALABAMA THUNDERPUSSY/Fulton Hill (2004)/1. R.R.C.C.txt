Over the edge
Time out of mind
Forcing the hand
Towing the line
But why?
Look what you're missing
Turnabout belief
Always second guessing
What do you need?
Rifling obsession
Searching for the key
Don't you ever wonder?
What's in store for thee
Trouble in spades
Schooled in "the way"
Earning the grade
We must subjugate
The mind
Look what you're missing
Turnabout belief
Always second guessing
What do you need?
Rifling obsession
Searching for the key
Don't you ever wonder?
What's in store for thee
DEATH, JAIL, OR ROCK-N-ROLL
I can't deny
LIVE? BELIEVE? SPEAK?
This heart is yearning
To tell the world
They just won't listen
To these words ---- of mine
Why do I even bother
Messing with you all
Like I got nothing better to do
Then take a fall
Life's not fair
Who said it would be?
Nobody cares
For the likes of me
Life's not fair
Who said it would be?
Nobody cares
For the likes of me
ROCK-N-ROLL
WON'T LET ME GO
ROCK-N-ROLL
WON'T LET ME GO
No Rock-n-Roll
Ain't gonna let me go
ROCK-N-ROLL
WON'T LET ME GO
'cause I won't let it
Need it loud
Moving inside
Gods of Rock-n-Roll
Stand by my side
