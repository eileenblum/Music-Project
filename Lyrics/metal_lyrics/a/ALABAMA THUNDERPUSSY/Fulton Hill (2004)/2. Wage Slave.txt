Quick glance into the never
Mind bent on saving time
Bold sense of dunce bravado
It's your ass on the line
Poor pig with nothing on you
scraping &amp; scratching for a dime
To buy back the tattered soul
you sold there
but the truth of the matter
is it's just a lie
AS HOPE DISSOLVES
YOU FALL AWAY ---
9 Tenths of what you borrow
Won't help you
get through tomorrow
Crime becomes a tempting option
To release you from the strain
Here comes the craven wage slave dripping with
sweat, bad blood &amp; tears
Looking to get out,
up above &amp; overchipping away
yet chained to fear
THE SYSTEM FAILS
YOU ONCE AGAIN
ONE FACT PREVAILS
THE ONLY WAR IS CLASS WAR
RISE &amp; Burn this fucker down
ORGANIZE
Turn yourselves around
MARCH ON
Hold high the torch of hope
FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT
Don't let them destroy you
IT'S YOUR CHOICE
IT'S YOUR VOICE
One struggle binds us together
Not going down without a fight
This storm together we'll weather
At the least we'll have our pride
