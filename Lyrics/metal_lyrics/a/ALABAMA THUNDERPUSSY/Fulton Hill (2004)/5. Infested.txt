Get ready
All set
Don't forget
To breathe
THEN HIT THE BOTTOM
Weep ------
THE SALTED SORROW
Cleave -----
TO THE BITCH'S BOSOM
Feel ------
A GROWING CANCER
Reek----
Of need about you
DESPERATION TEEMS
Cause a soul to rattle
TEARING AT THE SEAMS
CONFOUNDED RESERVATIONS
Holding back -----
GIMME THE FORESIGHT
While looking back ----
BACK AGAIN TO ZERO
Here we go again -----
ROUND &amp; ROUND &amp; ROUND
Reek----
Of need about you
The virus takes its toll ---
Drink deep from poison rivers
Pounding down calamity
No chance to ever make it
Overcome with your vanity
Choking on the chism
Puking up the host
Likened to a whore
GIVING UP THE GHOST
FACT FADES FACE
TACTICS ERASE
PROVINCIAL PIGGY
WAITING FOR THE WORM
So your confusing fact with illusion
Acting as though you've known all along
That they are out to get you
Infesting you with a strain of
Ignorance that cannot be cured
So your confusing fact with illusion
Acting as though you've known all along
That they are out to get you
Infesting you with a strain of
Ignorance that cannot be cured
