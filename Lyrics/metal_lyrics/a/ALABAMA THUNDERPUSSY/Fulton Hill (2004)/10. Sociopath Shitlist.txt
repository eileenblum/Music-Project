Encroaching injustice
Whipping your hide
Sending you reeling
Towards suicide
Finding it failing
Turn to the blade
Can't kill yourself
Someone will pay
Bringing it down from above
Revenge is far too sweet
Digging in deep to the bone
Hacking away at meat
It seems so simple
To take another's life
When you lack a conscience
But you have a knife
Strangling stress knots
White knuckle ride
Motherfucker's are useless
Your all gonna die
Bringing it down from above
Revenge is far too sweet
Digging in deep to the bone
Hacking away at meat
Sociopathic drive
Fueling the urge to kill
Psychopathic mind
Controls the will
Voices in my mind
Screaming Kill! Kill! Kill!
Death's the ultimate high
Wanna feel the thrill?
With your blood all over me
I can taste your pain
Your screams caressing
my fucked up brain
Stare into your dying eyes
Sucking your last breath
Drawing ever so close
To your death
With your blood all over me
I can taste your pain
Your screams caressing
my fucked up brain
Stare into your dying eyes
Sucking your last breath
Drawing ever so close
To your death
Off you go
Off you go
Crossed off my shit list
