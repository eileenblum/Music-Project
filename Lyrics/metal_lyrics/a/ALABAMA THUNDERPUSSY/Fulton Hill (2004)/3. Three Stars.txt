All alone yet beset with demons
After forever is a spirit tie
I unfold and wrestle with reason
Seems like it's never gonna be alright
Don't know what to say
When love turns grey
Drunken fool with a pocket of promise
And empty answers shining in his eyes
Dire wolf, hell hound of purpose
Taunted and hunted, licking at my thighs
One look then away
3 stars shine above
Relativity stains
Returns me no love
Remorse regret pounds in like a hammer
Pushing buttons and dwindling odds
Fraying threads weighted
with divine answers
Up to no good ripped, raped &amp; robbed
Reach for you - No where near me
Preach &amp; Learn - the gospel truth
Eyes a burn - wish it would rain
Lost and late for the train
Reach for you - No where near me
Preach &amp; Learn - the gospel truth
Eyes a burn - wish it would rain
Lost and late for the train
After all nobody's perfect
Understand intent was never mine
Carnal caws and a nightmarish circus
Did not ask for this but it's my life
