The world touches my mind, a beautiful sight
A vast expanse of seas, twenty degrees below freezing
The Kirth leave their home, out in the snow
The impact twists the ground, I put on my shroud, one in the crowd
I lead this life, nothing to say, I don't ask why, for the answer is grave
I reap these towns, never question the pain, whether I'm sane,every day I hear that voice, in my ears
One by one they fall, never a thought, never delay
He checks into his room, if only he knew
This will be the last time he can dream
A flicker of the lights, inject in the spine
He doesn't feel a thing, he pays, he leaves
I check the time, 10:35â¦ an hour 'til the first infection strikes
This man's in pain, it's moved to his brain
A headache he believes, he sees no evil
I lead this life, nothing to say, I don't ask why, for the answer is grave
I reap these towns, never question the pain, whether I'm sane,every day I hear that voice, in my ears
One by one they fall, never a thought, never delay
I turn away, this man's diseased, he convulses and shakes
Blue light erupts from his eyes and his face
The essence floats out, it's taking form
I watch it crawl, his spirit, his passive
Turns to me, it lights the lantern
Is this what it feels like to be God?
I feel uneasyâ¦Down the hall the others have now begun
I hear them screaming one by one
The toll is growing
This is how The Default Illusion affects soul
I must go, their faces sicken me
Into the door to bring them home
Turn back into the doorstep, when I am free I will breathe again
Another life and another day,
Who do I serve? Could it be just or evil?
Never have I felt so coldâ¦
Would it be wrong
If I just turned away? No.
Never can I be this low.
But I can't fightâ¦ all I know is to bring them home
I bring them home
