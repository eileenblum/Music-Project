"Then I will make you understand
Imagine that you're crawling across a threshold; across the circuit that controls your life
Imagine there's no motion
There is no feeling
There is no telling what's dark or what's light
The walls are closing, but you can't feel it;
Can't even sense that you're going to die

But how can you escape this tragic malfunction?
No time
And how will you go on without your instruction?
No guide
Heat has become a distraction
Breathe the air that beholds your existence
You're frightened
You're cold
And though you try to fight, it hurts
You cry
The silence fades away
You open your eyes

What do you need from me?
You're free, don't you see?
Just believe in me
I found you
I brought you to life
When darkness consumed your light, I showed you the way

I'll not fester in divinity
Do your best, you can't deliver me
I'm the maker of your pride;
You owe me, fool
I did this all for you, and you can see it's true
Or do you think you're dreaming?
I made you, and I was there for you
I gave it all to you
I was there for you
I was there for you

Now if you strike, I cannot
Will not
Will not be your savior
I'll show you pain, I'll show you might
You will rot in the cycle
I've shed myself
My self-control now wears its final form
I've shown my skin to all the night, now Kar'tahn make your choice"

"I'll die before I choose!
Though everything is true, this is just a ruse
I won't bow to you... I look down at you

I'll breach the surface just to spite you"
My memories of love and home are steering me
The Star is rising
I'm all but dying
I can't remember my existence
I'm gone
"To prove you wrong, and you have lost
Does it feel good?
This all... it seems so familiar "
