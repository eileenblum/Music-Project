After days of just dead ends, I finally find Reflaugh
And then across The Math we set our course,
To warn our people of the kirth
They're craving war

Burned, this place of wonder now lies in disrepair
Stones have returned to the shores of Math
And all its people have left their marks in blood
In The City of Kings

Eair'tra unfolds
The streets once paved in gold have met their end
The walls that scraped the sky now eat the ground
And Umber Tower looms high off in the distance
Where I must go
For Humbra told me

Burned, this place of wonder now lies in disrepair
Stones have returned to the shores of Math
And all its people have left their marks in blood
In The City of Kings

Ascend the stairs;
Into the dark they lead to the chamber where I have found the Umber Tomes
Open them up and read for the knowledge could save us all
Enter a trance
Into my head it flows;
For the power of darkness is mine
And the proamate evolution will serve
It is power that he's given me
Understand that it's not God we fear
My time is here
Stand clear of the people that consume
Live invisible in this world
Individuals made invincible
Is it me?
Inconceivable
Abominations are born from lust

Burned, this place of wonder now lies in disrepair
Stones have returned to the shores of Math
And all its people have left their marks in blood
In the city of kings

As the darkness fills my eyes, it appears that death is my friend
I control now what shall die
Arilayah by my side, we'll fight for Eair'tra
We will kill Fothcrah
Fight for Eair'tra
We will kill Fothcrah
