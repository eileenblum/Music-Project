As I sit alone
I see her eyes, running toward me
Everything I know has been controlled
When I am free you'll reap what you have sown

The darkness flows beside me
This empty space reminds me
Of all the things I've done to stain my soul
And when I'm gone I'll face the undergrowth

I don't believe the fires were all my fault
These false memories conspire to build my walls
I'll tear them down and rip your heart in two
When I am free I'll take your life from you

I'm only asking you for some light
If it's not me, than what else can I do?
I've done your tasks, now just tell me is it true?
If it's not me, than who?
