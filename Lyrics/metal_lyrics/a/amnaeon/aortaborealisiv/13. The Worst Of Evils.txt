"I am life
I am reformed
No one can know this truth but you
Don't be frightened, I am reborn;
A simple change that embraces you

I'll shine for you
Hear me
My love is so scary
I have become The Mourning Star
All that I know burns because of you

My quest ends here
All too soon
No one will know my pain but you
The Maker waits, just to kill time
After I've gone away is when he'll decide to find you

I'll shine for you
Hear me
My love is so scary
I have become The Mourning Star
All that I know burns because of you

A single question for all of this
A thousand answers
A thousand prayers
And through the struggle what got us here?
The worst evils spoke
The worst of evils is you

I'll shine for you
Hear me
My love is so scary
I have become The Mourning Star
All that I know burns because of you

The worst of evils spokeâthe worst of evils is
The worst of evils spoke
The worst of evils is you"
