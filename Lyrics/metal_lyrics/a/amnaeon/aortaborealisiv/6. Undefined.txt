At last I'm set free, my master calls me
So I try to hide all my resistance
Into the door I'm falling faster
The Roof and the Spawn are all I see
Two tribes at war to kill each other
This beautiful place will be diseased
Mort' Mydrea untamed, the people the same
I intrude their world, and I feel like falling back
I live today, no more can I grant these wishes
I've seen my world, simple, but it fits my nature
I need to get back there again
I falter my disguise, lost in dream
Though I apologize, I've been seen
It's never been like this I can't deny it's got me thinking
To see these people running for their lives and almost sinking
But I believe that I've tried
I live today, no more can I grant these wishes
I've seen my world, simple, but it fits my nature
I need to get back there again
So much that I want, not much that I need
Now I know the truth, and it's killing me
Lived a life in dark, who turned on the lights?
I'm not so different after all this
I walked a path of disillusion,
I've soaked my hands in the blood of man
Their faces I still remember
I swear to God that I will repent
For my sins won't go away on their own
At the most life seemed perfect, but I'm forgetting all the lives I could never have saved
