Fothcrah, you'll pay
Oh, I never should have dragged her into this
I watched her body to stone
I watched him stab her in the back
I swear it's all my fault
"I will not let you get away
I guarantee that you will break
I'll not be thrown aside

You're not the one to take me down
No, it's not how she would want it
Now I finally find you
I will not lie, you cannot escape me
How do you like it?
Two fingers placed on your head

And now that Fothcrah's been graved;
I trust this door will take me where I need to be
And all these passives that are blocking my path encourage my wrath
Stomped in the ground till it vent my hatred out
When I see him there, I just stop and stare
The moment that took my breath away

For Aril, I should strike you down
Not even worth my time
Don't even sing that song, you cannot bring her back to life
All this time I've spent chasing that evil inside
But now I've seen your face
You cannot hide

You must be The Maker
All along you've watched me drown
After all this fighting
After all this
Aren't you glad to see me?
I'm right here, you've got me now
After all this time, do you approve?

You were the crow that was there all along
You were the one that followed me through The Undergrowth
You're the creator everything, yet you sit here and watch us burn
How can you sit there and stare?
What is wrong with you?
Do we even matter?
Are you listening to me?

I should run you through
You're evil
