â¦I wake up again, far away
Can this place be real? Miles to see
A creature standing in the distance, to my surprise it looks like me
It's running closer, now its motives are too clear
She is concerned, that in the fall I might have broken something

It sounds like she's trying to speak with meâ¦I don't understand
It sounds like she's asking me my name

She might be what's missing in my life
She might take me home
This time I don't feel so incomplete
This time I'm in love

She tells the story to her brother Reflaugh who's in fact
The captain of a ship called "Wolfpit Drive"
And then the girl says Arilayah's what she calls herself, she takes me by the hand and off we fly
In a way I'm more than attracted to this girl that doesn't know my name (is it so wrong?)

It sounds like she's asking me where I'm fromâ¦ Do I understand?
I look to the end of the valley as Bastradon awakes

She might be what's missing in my life
She might take me home
This time I don't feel so incomplete
This time I'm in love

And when we're alone I can sense the attraction
I get lost within her eyes
And just at that moment when everything's perfect , and how it should be
She cries out, and falls to her knees, her hands on her head she's in painâ¦
I look to the door, and Fothcrah is calling to me
I refuse to go back
I've gained the essence of love in my absence and now I will not go
If I had a choice, I'd want to stay, but must obey my master
Take my hand, and don't let goâ¦ the force is pulling faster
I've grown to know, I've learned to love but it's been ripped from under
So I try to identify what she screamed before he closed the door
