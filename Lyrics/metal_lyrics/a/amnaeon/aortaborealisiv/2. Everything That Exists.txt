"Fate begins to tear at the corners of our hollow existence... let's pray"

A cry breaks out through the darkness
This voice it speaks to me
I close my eyes, and hope itâs just pretend
For it brings no tomorrow
The nightmare's real, brought here to this God-forsaken land
My eyes wrench open, I have no choice but to begin
Above my head the wicked star confirms my fear
It slowly turns, and every passing second feels like years

Apathy's my enemy, this life could be death of me
After all this good I've done, I'm cheated of my century
Document these past events, and tell me your uncertainty
I believe you would agree my life has turned to stone

I could be the Messiah, spreading word of hope and love
I could be evil born, misguiding youth to walk among me
I'd cause catastrophe a mastery of what I have become
Or just a shepherd's son whoâs lost of his sheep and can't go home

Apathy's my enemy, this life could be death of me
After all this good I've done, I'm cheated of my century
Document these past events, and tell me your uncertainty
I believe you would agree my life has turned to stone
All my life's the faintest glow
I can't even feel anymore
I just see the numbers as I approach the door
0237...no more
Tied around my waste, this lantern
Holding all those lives I've stolen
It'll take some time to reconstruct the star's light
I can feel it start shaking
As the ground shifts "Everything That Exist" fades to the gray
Eyes deceiving, my body starts to leave me
Unravels through this maze of systematic control
Crashing on a world that I will slowly destroy
