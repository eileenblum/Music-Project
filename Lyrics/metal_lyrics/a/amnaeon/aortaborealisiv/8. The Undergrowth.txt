Inside of this hive the air is still
All I see is mines
They go for miles
I believe that Fothcrah'll cause disaster
I believe that he has damned this world

Behind the rocks is where I hold my ground til I start the ascend
Against all odds I see them titans down below-
Three times the size of a normal man
Well I draw up the cloak beside me, and I creep my way on through
Cuz I doubt this crow will tell them my movements

In this worldâ
This world I do not know
Where they mountâ
Well, they mount their shame in gold
So now I vent out my frustration
The River: Humbra, I can't cross
With all these natiffs, none can promise me a ride
They say, "The current's just too strong."
Now Ol' Humbra's watchin' me
Now Ol' Humbra's callin'

In this worldâ
This world I do not know
Where they mountâ
Well, they mount their shame in gold
Where the darkâ
The darkness turns your soul
Here I faceâ
Well, I face The Undergrowth

Now Ol' Humbra's watchin' me
Now Ol' Humbra's callin'
Across this river's where I'm headed
This is where I make my stand
This river beckons meâ
Directing every step I seem to make
Close my eyes and jump
The water takes me inâ
Feels warm to my skin
As I tread my way across,
Ol' Humbra reads my every thought
The black tower fills my brain
It whispers out, "Come to me."
All of their lives are in my hands
The Umber Tower must commence
All of this timeâ¦
I understand a proamate is what I am
Use all the strength to climb The Stairs
Use all the strength to climb The Stairs
Use all my strength to climb The Stairs
Into the door I go

In this worldâ
This world I do not know
Where they mountâ
Well, they mount their shame in gold
Where the darkâ
The darkness turns your soul
Here I faceâ
Well, I face The Undergrowth
