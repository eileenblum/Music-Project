Times before you have been staying at home at the end of the world
Now it's a quite different life
You move with zig-zag course from earth to the stars
There's nothing to get leaves this way

It's a trick to your mind
It's a trick to your mind
It's a trick to your mind
It's a trick to your mind

In your comic-strip is the world so alright
Like never before
Everywhere
It's swarming with heroes
Be in luck
With one step in grave

You're still on the run to buy your dreams
Seem to be satisfied with this life of streams
But every time it is so near you are on the run
To prevent to get off from intoxication

Times before you have been staying at home at the end of the world
Now it's a quite different life
You move with zig-zag course from earth to the stars
There's nothing to get leaves this way

It's a trick to your mind
It's a trick to your mind
It's a trick to your mind
It's a trick to your mind

No chance
Is this the ever wanted life you have ever dreamed of
Isn't it really not a terrible trick to your mind ?

Dirty play with yourself - is this game it really worth ?

With every push nearer to death, for you it is programmed
The senses are shrinking from hour to hour
Waiting for your last breath

Hey awake - keep away - wrench from fate - enjoy the day

It's never too late - take your chance
You will not be the last man alive
Hey, stand up, it's a vicious run
See and then you'll thrive

Dirty play with yourself
This has really no worth

Times before you have been staying at home at the end of the world
Now it's a quite different life
You move with zig-zag course from earth to the stars
There's nothing to get leaves this way

It's a trick to your mind
It's a trick to your mind
It's a trick to your mind
It's a trick to your mind
