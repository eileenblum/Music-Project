Start to be aggressive
Search for your evil thoughts
You can lay off your conscience
Even god is on your side

Time is right for carnage
Forget the punishment
Jurisdiction changes
You won't atone for it

Obey to kill
On states command
To win to pray
Law's delay

Yesterday
Human life â was our â highest worth
But today
Duty calls â bring â to nothing â children's birth
Yesterday

You had to fear â punishment â for a crime
But today
Break human rights â suddenly â none atones

Armed forces exist for peace
Propaganda you believe
Reality shows the opposite
Again and again

Time has come to use your drill
Clock of human life stands still
Oppressive behaviour takes it's way
Ten commandments die

Law has changed
Interrupted humanity
None stops the decay
Law's delay

No penance

Evil minds
In a dirty head
Unexpiated
Remains his bloodshed
