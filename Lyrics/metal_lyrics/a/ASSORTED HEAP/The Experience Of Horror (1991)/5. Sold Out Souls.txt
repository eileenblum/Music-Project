It's right now and to every time
It's everywhere and right here
Marching masses view straight on
Alien's fate
They stare at it high above
Don't hear the noise of their chains
They need this high paid hooked sticks
A scaffold for their brains

Readiness for everything they bring
Empty thoughts are full of one thing

It's over them in the air
And drops in to their heads
Rents are being used up
Hungry ones are fed
A brought opinion - too high price
It's word is law and order
Close your eyes, jump in the flood
You will drink

Readiness for everything they bring
Empty thoughts are full of one thing

Sold out souls
Infected brains
Hearts are chained
Minds in vain
Sold out souls infected brains
Hearts are chained
Minds in vain
In vain

Together we are strong
That is their last hope
Fighting everything other
Attitude as dope
Crying, speaking without talking
Words are sick
No more breath streaming death
Fanatical fanatics

Readiness for everything they bring
Empty thoughts are full of one thing

Infected brains
Hearts are chained
Minds in vain
Sold out souls
Infected brains
Hearts are chained
Minds in vain

Sold out souls
Infected brains
Hearts are chained
Minds in vain
In vain

Remember there's no time to creep
