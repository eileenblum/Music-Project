She was a girl of eighteen, Emmy they called her
One night she went out to dance, the last bus was gone
And then he offered: "I'll take you home!"
His name was bob, he was her fairy-tale prince, you know
That's what she still thought

Experience of horror
Experience of horror
Experience of horror
Experience of horror

Did not notice in enormous danger
'Cause emotions fooled her sense, she felt like floating
But what she never expected was the following:
This day would change her life, meaning mental death

Experience of horror
Experience of horror
Experience of horror
Experience of horror

So dirty she felt
Washing her hair, her clothes
Dead her body seemed
Waking at night and scream

She never smiled again after this
No more flashing in her brown eyes
No hope for new life, only suspicion
Just numberless tears and disgust

She still feels his strong hands choking her
The knife at her throat
Still hears her heart beating fearing death
She was destroyed by ...
Worst kind of crime
Worst kind of crime
Worst kind of crime
Worst kind of crime

In fact sex crime is present in environment
Nineteen victims on a day report to police
Product of ill civilisation, ubiquity of fear
Rapists sentence's not a year, victims suffer death

Experience of horror
Experience of horror
Experience of horror
Experience of horror
