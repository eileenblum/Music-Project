Hey you â what you are, what do you wanna be?
What do you care about in your life, what do you do?
Do you know this feeling deep inside your stomach thinking about future?
Do you feel the sharp wind, which sometimes presses you to the ground?

They all tell you how to live
Don't promise what you give

No time
You're born to fly, you're live to cry, you're pushing deep to creep
You're born to fly, you're live to cry, you're pushing deep to creep
You're born to fly, you're live to cry, you're pushing deep there's no time to creep

Remembering this time, when future wasn't there
No tomorrow, only now, can't this go on?
Initiation wallows further, taking more
But I know, time will never get my core

They all tell you how to live
Don't promise what you give

No time
You're born to fly, you're live to cry, you're pushing deep to creep
You're born to fly, you're live to cry, you're pushing deep to creep
You're born to fly, you're live to cry, you're pushing deep there's no time to creep

Hold on your dreams
Searching you will reach
Practise what you preach
Practise what you preach

The remembrance of tomorrow is what you're doing now
Every given away moment no eternity gives back
Loving, laughing, making noise, don't forget tears
Hey you â what you are, what do you wanna be?

They all tell you how to live
Don't promise what you give

No time
You're born to fly, you're live to cry, you're pushing deep to creep
You're born to fly, you're live to cry, you're pushing deep to creep
You're born to fly, you're live to cry, you're pushing deep there's no time to creep

Remembrance of tomorrow
Remembrance of tomorrow
Remembrance of tomorrow
Remembrance of tomorrow
