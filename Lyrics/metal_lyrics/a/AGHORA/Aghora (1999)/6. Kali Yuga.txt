[Music &amp; Lyrics by Santiago Dobles]

Born within a darkened age
microcosmic game of life
Endless cycles endless dreams
dormant beings we've become
Moving away from light
through karmic conditioning
Consciousness self repressed
unaware sustains the stress
Feeding us with ignorance
trapped by time we stay confined
Moving away from light
by carnal conditioning
"Is this real?" you ask.
The reality is locked inside.
Close your eyes.
Take a step into the abyss.
It is far greater
than the world you know.
Like the lotus in the mud,
out of darkness comes light.
Facing life
freeing minds
no more lies
fear must die
In the abyss is life
through the darkness comes light
breaking the frames of time
eternally man must rise
Rise.
