[Music by Santiago Dobles]
[Lyrics by Santiago Dobles, Danishta Rivero &amp; Charlie Ekendahl]

In my eyes I see my life go by
Teaching me the answers to live
Kneeling down I pray
and pour myself to Him
Endlessly I pray
Questioning, questioning my place
in this state
Conscious bliss is near
In my silence I leave my mind behind
Flying through skies
of new worlds deep inside
Breaking through chains
or karmic ties I've made
Feeling His grace
I am blessed by His flame.
Now I've learned
I've realized the truth about myself
It isn't who you are
It is what you do
It isn't what you do
It is who you are
In my silence
I leave my mind behind
Feeling His grace
I am blessed by His flame.
