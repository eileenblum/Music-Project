[Music &amp; Lyrics by Santiago Dobles]

Seeing all the vanity
Rituals leaving children blind
Breeding delusive
Confusing the ancient's way of life
Seeking for their sanity
Living life with irony
It's one thing to be free from sin
And one thing to be the sin itself
Truth reveals nothing more but self
Killing all subjective holiness
Racing time ascension will take place
Granting fruits for actions made
Moving through the ageless void
Confirmed by our ignorance
Why can't we absolve our fears?
To let go and embrace our own beings.
Truth reveals nothing more but self
Killing all subjective holiness
Racing time ascension will take place
Granting fruits for actions made
To reveal the secrets
we must invoke the seeds within
conquering all our battles lifting the
awareness in man
Truth reveals nothing more but self
Killing all subjective holiness
Racing time ascension will take place
Granting fruits for actions made.
