[Lyrics by Santiago Dobles, Danishta Rivero &amp; Charlie Ekendahl]

Searching through the darkest night
Waiting for her lunar signs
Darkness grows around my eyes
Can I hide my fears?
Spirits moving around in circles
Tempting me they feed my eyes
If I hold on, survival is mine
And my spirit will rise.
Feeling the presence
Is it the one I want to feel?
Can I handle the powers that grow?
Moving closer inside my mind
Chanting hymns they hypnotize
Why can't I resist this charm?
Why can't I be free?
Feeling the presence
Is it the one I want to feel?
Can I handle the powers that grow?
Now my fears are gone
Life has burned the sign in me
Immortality has begun
Awakening the god in me.
