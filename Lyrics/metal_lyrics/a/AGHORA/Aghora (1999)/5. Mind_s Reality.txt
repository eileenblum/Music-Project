[Music by Santiago Dobles]
[Lyrics by Santiago Dobles &amp; Danishta Rivero]

In my mind thoughts create
Cosmic fields bring new dreams
In this light I am born.
In your treason
illusion will cause you to fall
Losing freedom
the seed you have reaped
will be sowed.
With your faith life will grow
Bringing answers, blessings will flow
Sacrifice, gesture of God.
In your treason
illusion will cause you to fall
Losing freedom,
the seed you have reaped
will be sowed.
In his eyes
reflected creation unfolds
Moving spheres ethereal beings are born
Folding flesh
the melting of life takes its toll
Testing souls
delusional games have begun.
What is real is only dream
Realization brings us peace
God's gift frees your mind.
