Bound, tightly wound
Cutting through
Feel away skin pulling free

I pull away the fragments
Embedded in each other
It hurts me to dig it out
But it's a necessary cleasing
The sheathes are just distractions
Holding back endless vitality
Ripping towards my essence
I find myself skinned

Bound, tightly wound
Cutting through
Feel away skin pulling free

Piece by piece I tear away
Clawing out my love and pain
All until what's left is emptiness
Stripping all of it in hopes to feed everyone
Making sure what's left is emptiness

I pull away the fragments
Embedded in each other
It hurts me to dig it out
But it's a necessary cleasing
The sheathes are just distractions
Holding back endless vitality
Ripping towards my essence
I find myself skinned

Pulling out the seed of a live heart
Sends waves crashing out flooding settings
Cleansing everything leaving an ocean
Nothing weighs me down ocean of emptiness
