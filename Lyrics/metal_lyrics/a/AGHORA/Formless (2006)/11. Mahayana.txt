We witness a slow decay
A quiet and solemn pain

Look around

View the ground above the seeds we eradicate
Holding shards
Cut profound into wounds that nourish pain

Conferred dreams
Stealing bliss
Feeding lies
Disseminate

Move through a passage
Seek to find answers
Delude yourself from greed
Liberate the soul

Look around
View the ground above the seeds we eradicate
Conferred dreams
Stealing bliss
Feeding lies
Disseminate

Holding shards
Cut profound into wounds that nourish pain

Speaking words
Whispering thoughts
Retract my soul
Debilitate

I silence we fade away
To enter a spiral phase

Move through a passage
Seek to find answers
Delude yourself from greed
Liberate the soul

Look around
View the ground above the seeds we eradicate

Conferred dreams
Stealing bliss
Feeding lies
Disseminate

Holding shards
Cut profound into wounds that nourish pain

Speaking words
Whispering thoughts
Retract my soul
Debilitate
