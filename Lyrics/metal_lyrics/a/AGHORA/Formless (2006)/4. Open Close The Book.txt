We tread inside wrecks of the grind
Leaving our perfections behind
While our soul corrodes and unwinds
Trying not to lose the thread of life

Wheels of bullshit turn just
Like the karmic wheel of samsara
Don't hold on to visions and to patterns
It's all in your mind

The big picture will never care
Let it go and release
Relinquish all control to receive
Butterflies will move their wings

Wheels of bullshit turn just
Like the karmic wheel of samsara
Don't hold on to visions and to patterns
It's all in your mind
Wheels of bullshit turn just
Like the karmic wheel of samsara
Let it write its own course
Just a passage in an empty book

To hell with your soul
To hell with your disappointments
To hell with your earth
To hell with your education
To hell with your greed
To hell with your reputation
To hell with your love
It won't matter it can't save you

Wheels of bullshit turn just
Like the karmic wheel of samsara
Don't hold on to visions and to patterns
It's all in your mind
Wheels of bullshit turn just
Like the karmic wheel of samsara
Let it write its own course
Just a passage in an empty book
