Leaving behind traces of fear
Shedding the soul, releasing pain

Struggling within
Creating binds
Feeding the mind
Believing lies
Blind ignorance
We're frail inside

Confined and trapped beneath the shadows
We hunt the light to free our suffers

Sliding by, moving beyond life
Delve inside, no longer we hide

Struggling within
Creating binds
Feeding the mind
Believing lies
Blind ignorance
We're frail inside

Confined and trapped beneath the shadows
We hunt the light to free our suffers

Breaking through binds
Deceiving lies keeping us blind
Freeing our minds
From ignorance we hide inside
Seeking out
Finding the path leading us out
Reaching the light
