Schemes you can't see
Look around
Dig in deep

Who cares?
Who will stand?
Who dreams?
Who will bleed?

Lies you are told
Look around
Dig in deep

Who cares?
Who will stand?
Who dreams?
Who will bleed?

It's so unfair
It's gone too far
It's a machine
Using us as fuel
It's time to stop
Turn off the noise

What will you do about it?
How will you take a stand?
Tear the mask
Rip the tear
Break the calm
End it here

It's so unfair
It's gone too far
It's a machine
Using us as fuel
It's time to stop
Turn off the noise
It's time to stop
It's gone too far
