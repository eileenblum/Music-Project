Consumed in your pretense
Receded in sustain
Feelings inside that drown in neglect
Secluded in this place
Within cynic embrace
Needless self consumption that destroys my mind

Break away from your thoughts
Don't push me down
I long for your trust

Restless to escape
While memories deflect
Searching for a way delivering my senses
Thoughtless I remain deluded from the chains
Detaining space and time to release my mind

Break away from your thoughts
Don't push me down
I long for your trust

I won't regret leaving behind
All that I once thought as found
Unbound to keep holding back
So set me free
