Take your time and let it go
My friends you still have some breaths to take
There is beauty in this phase
I won't let them shed tears of suffering

Take my hand so you can go
What you leave behind will always be
There's no meaning in life
If you can't close your eyes for a while

I can't tell you it will be O.K.
It's path you take
I can't tell you you will be O.K.
It's a path we take

Don't fear, enter, split yourself from comfort

I can't tell you it will be O.K.
It's path you take
I can't tell you you will be O.K.
It's a path we take

I don't fear letting myself fade
