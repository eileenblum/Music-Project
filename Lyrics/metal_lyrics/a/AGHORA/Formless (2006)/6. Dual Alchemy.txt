In my sleepless nights I wait inside for you
Longing for your shelter
My life is full of dreams fantasizing you
Showing me reality

Feeling duality I rise and follow thee
Lifting my awareness
Feeling yourself in me I realize the need
To liberate my passions

This bond growing free yourself in me
Feeling layers, cleaving endlessly
Constant pressures enveloping space
Feeling layers cleaving endlessly

My skin is full of you
Our blood a piercing flow
Burning through the boundaries
The alchemy of dreams
A fantasy that's true
Shattering reality

Feeling duality I rise and follow thee
Lifting my awareness
Feeling yourself in me I realize the need
To liberate my passions

Feeling layers, cleaving endlessly

This bond growing free yourself in me
Feeling layers, cleaving endlessly
Constant pressures enveloping space
Feeling layers cleaving endlessly
