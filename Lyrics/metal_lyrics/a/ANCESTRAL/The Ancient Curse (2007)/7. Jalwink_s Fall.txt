Now the sun has risen
The dark assault has started
They are unfinished
They are the fear of man

Look behind
I can't see the end
Hear my oath
We'll never lose
Victory or Death

Pain becomes my breath
My ultimate life's reason
I say don't be afraid
Justice is with us

In the sky
The sun lights the day
In my eyes
A fire burns again

See the Prince of Death
On the Iron Hills
Only blood and brutal madness
Evil fury comes
Theater of pain
Lies before my eyes
The sun is dark, the fields are blood
It's the Hell on earth

My steel was never defeated
My mind was never corrupted

Now a messenger of death
Flies up into the sky

And while I'm fighting
Jalwink stands proud
Now a messenger of death
Destroys the life of men
And while I'm dying
Jalwink's falling down

My steel was never defeated
My mind was never corrupted

Now a messenger of death
Flies up into the sky
