They come from the sea
From far beyond
Their ships bite the rumbling
Waves of none

Like a tide that hurls
against the rocks
like an eagle on it's prey
They're marching on

Allies are now distant from here
And the battle's coming as a plague
From the top of this fortress
We're screaming again

Sons of evil we'll never surrender
with courage we will break
This ancient curse
From houses to temples
Surrounded by terror that's
Creeping inside
But the remains
will recall our Fate
They'll bring our fate back

16.000 come to die
In nine days of bloody
Odd resistance made in vain
We sing about an age's end

Mother! Take me home
Death! Take me away

Allies are now distant from here
And the battle's coming as a plague
From the top of this fortress
We're screaming again

Sons of evil we'll never surrender
with courage we will break
This ancient curse
From houses to temples
Surrounded by terror that's
Creeping inside
But the remains
will recall our Fate
They'll bring our fate back
