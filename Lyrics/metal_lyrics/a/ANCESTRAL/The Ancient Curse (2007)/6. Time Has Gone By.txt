Look at a new dawn
The rime hurts our faces
Today, our paths lead us in different places
The way of sorrow, we've crossed for a while,
Will prosecute only deep inside my mind
I relive
What I once lived forever

At the end of the night, the sun shines again
And the shadows hide themselves
Keep the memory in your heart as a fairytale
Remember your name and honour it
Until we meet again
In this land

Over the hills
At the end of the storm
Hear and preserve all these magical words
It's time to believe
It's time to forget
Fulfil your destiny, you must have no regrets

Even though you'll climb
The highest mountain
Do not look behind
Show no fear
Carry on with pride
Let this learning be carved inside your heart
All the things you'll find
Keep 'em inside you
As a silver line which you must follow
Live everyday
As if it was the last one

Over the hills
At the end of the storm
Hear and preserve all these magical words
It's time to believe
It's time to forget
Fulfil your destiny, you must have no regrets
