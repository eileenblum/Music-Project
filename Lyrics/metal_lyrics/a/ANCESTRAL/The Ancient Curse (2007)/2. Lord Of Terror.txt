I'm the one
The King of the Gods
Guardian of Mankind remember my name
Lost in a dark abyss for thousand years
I have returned to destroy your life

I am here
Legend's back for eternity
You'll be my slaves
This world now lacks the holy force

Mortal man you've signed your own
death warrant
In this vision, look at your damned fate:

Deadland and destruction
Around your blind eyes
Screams of sorrow
Will hurt your mind
Horror will come
With its dark wings
I'm the Darkness
Master of the Night.

I'm the only one
King of Terror, lord of Filth
I'm the only one
In my hands, your life will burn

"Fool creature of the night
Your reign is just sand"

Fantasy!
Nobody else can fight against me
Agony!
Is the only way that you will cross
My kingdom will be your

Deadland, wasteland
Your time has come and
Now, my fury will
Disrupt your soul
The wind will breaks your damned
life like
A slight branch swept by the storm

I'm the only one
King of Terror, lord of Filth
I'm the only one
In my hands, your life will burn
