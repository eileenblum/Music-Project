During the night the truth is revealed
After a long wait
The prophecy comes true
The gods are playing with our destiny
And The screams of Cassandra resound
in the air

Ten years ago
We did not believe in our Fate
The flames now say it's too late
Today my house's walls are shining bright

The smell of victory and peace makes us foolish
And now the dawn brings a gift full of hate
and decay

Nowhere and nowhere you can hide your fear
But the fire of betrayal surrounds all the night
and the deep dark
will lead us to the end

We're rising from a flame
From ashes as a phoenix
There's a new beginning
We're roving over seas
The tears of my sorrow are not
shed in vain

We rise from here
From the screams of the slain
Betrayed by the gods

Creeping on tonight, we escape from
the light that
Corrodes our past lives
Faster, much faster we go to the stormy sea
Don't turn your head to look back
Forget your memories they're turned into dust
The age of my people has gone by

Nowhere and nowhere you can hide your fear
But the fire of betrayal surrounds all the night
and the deep dark
will lead us to the end

We're rising from a flame
From ashes as a phoenix
There's a new beginning
We're roving over seas
The tears of my sorrow are not
shed in vain

We're rising from a flame
Rising to begin
From nowhere beyond the seas
We're rising from a flame
Waiting for a time
When shame is avenged by the glory of Rome
