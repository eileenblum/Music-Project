Zeus, the Right, is on my side
His thunderbolt's burning bright
Revenge comes here
To fill you with fear
Death calls death, I take my oath:
I will see, when you are blind!

Innocent blood was spilled on the field
Giving you a new damned day
Would you celebrate
Achilles' end?
You are guilty and the sentence is death
Into the dark, fall into the dark!

Forevermore, your soul will scream in the Hades
And with the damned, the Stygian travel's just
begun

"The end of this endless war,
I know,
It's coming as fast as the hourglass sand runs
I swear you will never go over these doors
You desecrate his body but not his heart"

Shadows on the walls
Blood is flowing away
Mourning for your strain
When ravens eat your body mixed with sand
Gods are laughing
For this sacrifice
You'll never rest in peace

You will see when you are blind
fall into the dark!

Forevermore, you will enter
the silence of Hades
Without rest
Full of pain
Forgotten for all time

"The end of this endless war,
I know,
It's coming as fast as the hourglass sand runs
I swear you will never go over these doors
You desecrate his body but not his heart"

Shadows on the walls
Blood is flowing away
Mourning for your strain
When ravens eat your body mixed with sand
Gods are laughing
For this sacrifice
You'll never rest in peace
