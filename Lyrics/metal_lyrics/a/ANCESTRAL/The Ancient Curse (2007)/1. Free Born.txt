In the age of darkness
The shadows of the cowards fall
Evil thoughts try to stop us
and kill me

Angel of destruction
Sweep the filth away
Erase corruption
And make me free

The beginning of the battle to
Defend our ideals,
In the mighty clash of army
We'll survive again

Fire!
Burn in the
Battlefield!
Purify our souls
Before the Chasm
The magic song is my guide

We are freeborn against the world
Fighting forever the Dark Mighty Lord
We are soldiers of twilight
Standing together against our Fate

For your acts, your name will survive again
Another sacrifice was made for sacred cause
Time has come for all to raise the heads and fight
After the fall of grace, our scream resounds tonight

Hundreds thousands of phantoms
are storming my mind
Madness tries to tame me
but my soul is too strong

We are freeborn against the world
Fighting forever the Dark Mighty Lord
We are soldiers of twilight
Standing together against our Fate
