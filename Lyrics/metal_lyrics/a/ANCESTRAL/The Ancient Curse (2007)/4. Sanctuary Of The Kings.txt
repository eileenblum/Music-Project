At the end of time I feel the whispers of divine
Maybe I'm not prepared, but ancient
towers tell me:
"welcome to the sanctuary of the kings"
Here is carved an hold prophecy

"only a warrior pure in his heart
May stop the fate that's written on the dust"

Another holy war
I am fighting for me and for all of us
And we'll never give up
Another holy war
These words will be my glory
Or the script for my requiem

Faster than light
We are creatures of time
We are just at the beginning
Open your mind
Look inside you the legend
Of kings of the immortal
They live in you and
I'll be your guide
Between your roots
You're child of this strain

Inside the darkness we stand
And we seek our life
Beyond this gate
There begins
The quest for Truth
We're fighting for the Kings

Another holy war
I am fighting for me and for all of us
And we'll never give up
Another holy war
These words will be my glory
Or the script for my requiem

Another holy war
I am fighting for me and for all of us
And we'll never give up
Another holy war
