[Lyric: D. Mendolia, music: A. Olivo, C. Scozzari, M. Mendolia]

Hey, don't look me 'cause I'm crying
You think you I cannot to die
I want to find my way back to life
I need to see another sign of fateâ¦

Hide your pride and never kill again
I feel the taste of freedom close to me!

Ready to escape from twilight, I'll go back to life
My one dream, my only request
Far from the kingdom of war, I'll go back home
I live for my only desire

Hey, what do you think of death?
Seems like she's watching in silence
I want to find another reason of life
I need to feel your presence close to me!

Now it's time to regain what I've lost
Still I'm searching, but truth will never come
Now I see your false smile
Waiting to leave for a new life I'll forget all the evil I've seen

Ready to escape from twilight, I'll go back to life
My one dream, my only request
Far from the kingdom of war, I'll go back home
I live for my only desire

[Solo: Scozzari/Olivo/Scozzari/both/Scozzari]

Spread your wings through the wind so your time will come
They told you a lie, no one can know the truth
Don't be afraid, from the chaos you will rise again
Freedom is a word, no one can understand

From the anguish of night, to the morning calm
My dreams keep me a live (I come from evil)

From the anguish on night to the morning calm
It's time to regain what I've lost
