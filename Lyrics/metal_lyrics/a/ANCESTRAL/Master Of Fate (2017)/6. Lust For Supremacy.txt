[Lyric: D. Mendolia, music: A. Olivo, C. Scozzari, M. Mendolia]

Lost in the darkness never ended
Searching for peace without result
Don't try to wake up from this nightmare
There is no hope inside your heart

Go and kill tonight the phoenix
Go and spread the power to the land!

Through the plagues of war and pain,
Wherever the light goes down
You will taste our lust for supremacy
Until only the strong will survive!

Bring the fear to the whole world
With the steel we spread the law
Our flame forever will burn
We possess the force

[Solo: Scozzari/Olivo]

My hands are red with blood
Only death around my eyes
It's too late for turning back
But my soul will go onâ¦

Through the plagues of war and pain,
Wherever the light goes down
You will taste our lust for supremacy
Until only the strong will survive!

[2x]
Bring the fear to the whole world
With the steel we spread the law
Our flame forever will burn
We possess the force
