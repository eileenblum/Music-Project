[Lyrics: D. Mendolia, music: M. Mendolia C. Scozzari]

Save me this one last time
The torments flowing in my eyes,
I have no choice, I have no fear
To bring me out of this hell

I tried to glance beyond the time
And saw my spirit heal from every scar

Across the sea where the illusions happen
Beyond the dark where the nightmare live
Lost in the waves as souls migrants
Sailing on the route of death

I'm watching through this crossing horror
One day I know we'll meet again to share the sorrow
I'll paint my soul with blood and water
To find my image in this reflection

I tried to glance beyond the time
And saw my spirit heal from every scar

Across the sea where the illusions happen
Beyond the dark where the nightmare live
Lost in the waves as souls migrants
Sailing on the route of death

[Solo: Scozzari]

I saw the world through my hopeless eyes
Along this mystical journey
Crossing the sea of the drowned dreams
One day I'll tell you my tale

Looking at the sky, only time will tell you your fate
Master of your life, will the mystery be unveiled?
Deep into the dark, soon the suffering will finish
Keeper of your fate, will the truth be revealed?

Across the sea where the illusions happen
Beyond the dark where the nightmare live
Lost in the waves as souls migrants
Sailing on the route of death
