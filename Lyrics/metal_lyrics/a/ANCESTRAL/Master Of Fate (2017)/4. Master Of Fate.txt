[Lyric: D. Mendolia, music: A. Olivo, C. Scozzari, M. Mendolia]

Inside the prison where my fears come true,
I can't see the future 'cause I've lost my faith
Tears of illusion now fall from my face
And flow in the river of pain!

However I am, I'm the ruler of fate
And nothing will be the same	
However I can, I can write on your book
The life that I want for you

Take my hand and fly beyond the sky
You can't be free, I decide your fate
The ruling comes like a stormy wind
The battle is starting again, I'm master of fate

Into the mirror where I lost myself
My vision reflects all the evil I've done
Scars of illusion still burn in my head
The madness now flows in my veins

However I am, I'm the ruler of fate
And nothing will be the same

However I can, I can write on your book
The life that I want for you

Take my hand and fly beyond the sky
You can't be free, I decide your fate
The ruling comes like a stormy wind
The battle is starting again, I'm master of fate

[Solo: Scozzari/Olivo]

Like nomads of time, we search for the hope
The voice of your god, can't stop my revenge
I'm the chosen one, the ruler of fate
Wherever you are, my curse will remain
The time has come, here you've found what you're looking for	
Let me fill your helpless soul
Through the wind, my fate will return

Take my hand and fly beyond the sky
You can't be free, I decide your fate
The ruling comes like a stormy wind
The battle is starting again, I'm master of fate
