[Lyric: D. Mendolia, music: C. Scozzari, M. Mendolia]

Search with my hands through the darkness,	
Wind calls my name, to sail on the waves,
Ready to lose life together we fight
When dawn will rise up you're trapped in my wind (to dry my pain!)
In my spell! (to dry my pain!)

There's no time, there's no way, we will fight with all the rage
Across the sea, for victory, will sail beyond the wind,
Into the storm, forevermore you can see the Egadi
When the sun rises up you'll fall in this wind

Fight! A strange wind blows in the sky, you can feel the fear inside,
It burns your heart and your soul, the end is coming, the end is so near, they will fall,
We fight through islands and the sea, waiting for the rising sun,
This endless night makes you blind, one by one they fall in this nightmare, they will fall!

[Solo: Scozzari]

There's no light to guide your way, it's too late for turning back, we fight until the end
From the Egadi we sail, in this water we'll wait for the wind of mighty rising dawn

Fight! A strange wind blows in the sky, you can feel the fear inside,
It burns your heart and your soul, the end is coming, the end is so near, they will fall,
We fight through islands and the sea, waiting for the rising sun,
This endless night makes you blind, one by one they fall in this nightmare, they will fall!
