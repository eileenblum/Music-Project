[Lyric: D. Mendolia, music: A. Olivo, C. Scozzari, M. Mendolia]

Inside my mind
Walking alone deeper into the night
Dreaming to leave the world behind
Crossing the bridge for the circle of life
Leaving my world, leaving my land
When my soul will revive from my carnal remains

Tell me the secret of time and the reason to fly in the circle of life
The light of the dawn, the dark is no more, I pray for salvation, a way to relive

The time will take your soul, no more regrets

Here I am,
In your sad eyes I can read all your sins that no one else could read
The way to freedom is painful and long
We always have to wait
And my soul will revive from my carnal remains

Tell me the secret of time and the reason to fly in the circle of life
The light of the dawn, the dark is no more, I pray for salvation, a way to relive

[Solos: Scozzari/Olivo]

Running through this endless maze, deep inside I feel the wrath
Inner scars that never heal, feel my breath under your skin

Hear my voice and come with me, guide my way like no one else
Never knowing what to seek, never knowing where toâ¦

Someone calling from the shadows, no one here to hush your voice
A void inside myself, from this world where nothing lives

For every soul there's no way out, I'm waiting for the time to leave
I'm face to face with all my sins to find a reason to believe
For every man there's no more time, I'm waiting here to leave behind
I'm face to face with all my crimes to find a reason, find the truth
The reason why I curse the fate that I deserve
