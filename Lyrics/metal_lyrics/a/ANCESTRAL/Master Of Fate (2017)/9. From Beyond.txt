Please let me escape now from this flames
To try not to waste my last chance

For the ones who lost their hope

There's no one that can stop my march
The desert seems like just behind

For the ones who found their light

No one will ever stop me
I'll pass through peace and strife
Ride through the winds of the desert
And spread my rage throughout the earth

Will we survive to find a new life?
I know there's something calling us

Follow your dream just for one night
To where the darkness reigns your mind
Ready to fight and kill, no reason to escape anymore,
From beyond!

Try not to lose the thread of life, no more tears to cry
Waiting here to leave this world I'm not the only one

From this land of despair I'll rise again
There's no peace for me,
And once I'll be healed of all my sins, justice will be done to my soul

[Solo: Scozzari]

You will not be lonely once again
In the name of those who lost their hope

From beyond! Forever..

There's no reason to hide anymore

Hear the wind's call, it's so real, no more reason to hide anymore, I'm finally free!

Out of the stormâ¦.

Follow your dream just for one night
To where the darkness reigns your mind
Ready to fight and kill, no reason to escape anymore,
From beyond!

[Solo: Olivo]
