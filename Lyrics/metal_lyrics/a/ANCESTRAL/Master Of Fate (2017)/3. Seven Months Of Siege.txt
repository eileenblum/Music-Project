[Lyric: D. Mendolia, music: M. Mendolia C. Scozzari]

Cries in the night, they ride fast
The end is near, no way to run
Echoes of war resound in me
The ground is shaking, everything burns

Wisdom's voice is guiding me
Until the light will shine on me

Here we are, far beyond the sea
Too blind to see the truth, waiting for a crimson sign
Here we are, far away from peace
Too strong to feel the fear, waiting for the siege

We'll never give up! No reason to die! What is the illusion?

Thousands of souls are surrounding me
Is this the end of time?
Please Lord, save me, with faith we'll rise from the flames

Here we are, far beyond the sea
Too blind to see the truth, waiting for a crimson sign
Here we are, far away from peace
Too strong to feel the fear, waiting for the siege

[Solo: Scozzari]

There's no time to escape (seven months of pain!)
The fire cleanses our souls (the siege has just begun!)
Now the time has come, let me hear your call (will kill you!)
The evil nights are coming, the war has just begun..

Here we are, far beyond the sea
Too blind to see the truth, waiting for a crimson sign
Here we are, far away from peace
Too strong to feel the fear, waiting for the siege

There is no time to escape! Is this the end of the time?
