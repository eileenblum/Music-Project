[The Ironclad Warriors and the Dreadnauts rushed to meet the invading Extropian Army with a crushing blow. The warriors were already strong, but their warlords shouted to the top of their lungs, rallying them into a state of invincible frenzy! Together they were one
voice, heard for miles as they charged!]

"My warriors, the time is now!
Hold high your heads and shields!
They march with hearts of silence,
but we will be heard...
The voice of our people is righteous!
We are the Light in the Darkness!
So hold your ground, brace yourself, and
prepare to strike down with the words!"
- Nirtok, Ironclad Overseer

"Serve yourself. Serve your needs.
You'll go down as nothing!
(We will speak!)
And destroy with every word!
Apathetic; You're a leech.
Your pretense tries to silence me, but
(We will speak!)
And our voices will be heard!"
- Jahn, Ironclad Warrior

(...We will be heard!)
"Take my thoughts, clean my soul, take this all away...
False reality is all we have left...
Is all we have left."
- Treg, Enlightened Ironclad

"Our voice is a body; Able to be cut, bruised, hurt, abused...
And I know the pain,
but just let it embrace you, let it play through,
cus that's what keeps us true!
At some point we all fight for our lives,
every day living voiceless, I know what it's like!
But you can see now, there is a voice to guide you!
We are the voice that speaks words so true!"
- Kala, Ironclad Healer

"Now we will take...
All the pain and suffering!
And scream with worlds of strength!
(We will speak!)
And destroy with every word!
There will be nothing left,
And we won't look back!
(We will speak!)
And our voices will be heard!"
- Bahl, Ironclad Warrior

"Your true faces...
twisted by years of disregard,
[for who we are...]
You are dead to us.
You are just so dead to us..."
- Dahn, Dreadnaut

"You tried to remove our will.
It became our ability to fight!
Nothing so big could go unheard!â
- Bani, Ironclad Captain
