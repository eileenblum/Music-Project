We learn in life that all conflicts have two sides:
Two enemies, and two heroes.
Two forces to support, and two forces to wish the worst upon.
Between one and the other, a middle-ground...
The desire of both armies.
The heart of all battle is here.
The core of bloodshed and defeat...
Dominance and victory.

The one aspect of humanity that could keep us united is what could give one man power,
And the hope for such power is a gravity unmatched,
Rendering this one hope to be that which divides us...

It is the powerful, who attract the weak.
It is the weak, that become the army.
The army marches to battle.
And the battle is what kills the hopeful.

(What was over, has only begun.)

A different beginning is on the horizon;
With time undone, darkness fades to light.
One frame of mind becomes another,
And our vision turns from black to white.

Only moments for breath to be caught,
We plunge back into the fray...
To see from the eyes of another,
As the night succumbs to day.

...Remission: Unto War.
