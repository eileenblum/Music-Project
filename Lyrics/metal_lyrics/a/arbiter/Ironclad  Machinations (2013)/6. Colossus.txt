[Xa, Commander of the Extropian Army, had pulled back the extermination effort. The remaining Extropian war-boats moved homeward to Eos Umbra while the Ironclad warriors collapsed on the shores of Eos Lux, panting and vomiting from fatigue. Xa stood upon the deck of one
war-boat, ablaze in his forbidden anger, and shouted from his dark heart:]

"You have not heard the end of me!
I will see to your every death!
And when we reassemble for war!
You'll lay dead!
Then we will truly see where you end up when your life is gone!
No more co-operation... you will lay dead!"
- Xa, Extropian Council Overseer

...And you cannot prepare...
...For what walks your way...
...A terror unbeknownst to man...
...A towering machine of death...

âThe Visitors unto Earth shall bow before him:
Colossus!
Extropian kind will soon ascend...
The primitive Humans will burn, and turn to dirt!
The beast of steel. Immortal man...
They forge as one. Colossus: Born!

...The MechaGod is born.
His Son is manifest.
Colossus: Walk and bring unto them death!"
- Xeno, Extropian Scientist

"We have suffered no loss. We retreat to forge the beast!
One with power beyond your God's, and you will know no further victory.
You have left us weak and injured, but fate cannot be denied.
Our destiny to ascend and conquer as Extropians will never die!
Hold your breath, prepare for the worst, your days are numbered,
For when we meet again, it will be our last encounter!

You may have won the battle,
But you will not win this war!
This isn't over!"
- Xa, Extropian Council Overseer
