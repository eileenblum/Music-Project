[An hour after the Extropians' extermination of Humanity had begun, Ironclad reinforcements arrived. They were the Dreadnauts-- Small in number yet large at heart. They shouted cries of bravery to their invaders. Some Extropian soldiers questioned their chance at victory
and, against their way of living, began to call on superstition and luck to pull them through. Their superiors thought otherwise: "Hush your pleadings! On this day, the Ironclad will fall!"]

"They will fear us,
And we will watch them die;
Torn from the years of their oppression
Keeping them alive."
- Xeth, Extropian Deathbringer

"Put your faith in something more,
Than the God that they say,
Sees your every move...
Does he watch you hit the floor?
When your days are shattered;
With nothing left to lose?"
- Xel, Extropian Elder

"There's another way for the chosen ones.
There is a 'God' for the rest of us,
Programmed to conquer till the end of time.

This is Extropia;
Dawn of the MechaGod!
And we will see the
Rise of the Black Dawn!â
- Xa, Extropian Council Overseer

âExtropians, quell your fears!
The MechaGod will guide us through this full-scale war.
Hold your ground and keep your faith in our destiny...
We have been chosen!

(They will fear us!)

They will lie dead, and we will outlive!
Rising to the next world to conquer again and again,
And again and again!â
- Xra, Extropian Battleguard

(Put your faith in something more!)

...This is Extropia;
Dawn of the MechaGod!
And we will see the
Rise Of the Black Dawn!
