[The Great Divide had begun. Prophecies long foretold of a split among all men and a war thereafter. The Ironclad and Extropian armies rested from their first day at battle-- friends and family lying dead under a wake of vultures. Both sides rose the next morning weary
from battle, unwilling to continue the slaughter. Their heads hung and morale plummeted... until the two most powerful voices in all of Eos approached their tired armies; Nirtok, Overseer of the Ironclad Army and Xa, Overseer of all Extropian peoples. Both stood tall
before their armies and delivered powerful yet all-too-similar words:]

âWe are the voice of words so true!
We are the Ironclad... built for war!
The time is now for us to strike!
We guide this world so kept in the dark,
But our enemy is holding us back!
With the power of a dark sun, they assemble for war!
Their years of Machinations have come down to this day...

So let it be known: War is at hand!
For years we have been dividing! (for years we have grown apart...)
The time to divide has come!
...What will you defend?
We are faced with a war between us!

This is fight or flight! Fly or die!
There's no more questioning when you look at the sky!
So together we stand: With unity and pride!

...And with the Dreadnauts
...We will speak and be heard!
...We are hellbent for victory!
Ironclads: We are the Judgement!
We have the power to hush the roar of silence!
We have the power to tip the scales of existence,
And change all that is Time and God!â
- Nirtok, Ironclad Overseer

...We are all the Arbiter...

Now We Diverge:
