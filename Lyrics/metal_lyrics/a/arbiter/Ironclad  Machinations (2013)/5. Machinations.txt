[Though the Extropian soldiers still rained death on the Ironclad Army, they were pushed back to the Azurean Shores, constrained to their war-boats there. With more water as ammunition for their ice weaponry, Extropian forces found new strength, but the Ironclad had
proven their power. There was frustration among the Extropians as they began to lose their footing, and at the onset of this uncertainty came the long-forgotten anger and despair the Extropian way of life strove to avoid.]

"You wanted war? Well you've got a war!
Extermination for the last of your kind.
We will fight with all we have left to give!
...Driven by the god...
By the god that does not live!
...Strike now and kill!
We grow weak, but victory is ours;
Charge like the darkness
through a shattered heart!"
- Xa, Extropian Council Overseer

â(We are)
No longer made by your maker.
(No longer made...)
No longer made by the sky!
We are made... by what we made!"
- Xeno, Extropian Scientist

"Through all the betrayal...
The pain we've endured...
How could we permit this injustice?
For ten years, we have suffered alone;
No family, no friendship, no warmth in our hearts.
Driven to exile by our own kind...
For we were too different to unify...
But we are the chosen!
Destined to sail the final ocean!
War does not end, so we must begin again.
We will ascend as Extropians!"
- Xel, Enlightened Extropian

(We Will Ascend.)

"Begin again! Fight for your life!
See how your horizons have shrunk.
Time has run out, now fight!
Fight!
And though our lines grow weak...
(Swing down the arm of might!)
And though our numbers drop...
We will... We will...
Send the tremors of our Machinations...
To the end of Time and God...
...End God."
- Xa, Extropian Council Overseer
