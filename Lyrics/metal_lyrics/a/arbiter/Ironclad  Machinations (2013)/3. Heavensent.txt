[The Great Divide had begun. Prophecies long foretold of a split among all men and a war thereafter. The Ironclad and Extropian armies rested from their first day at battle-- friends and family lying dead under a wake of vultures. Both sides rose the next morning weary
from battle, unwilling to continue the slaughter. Their heads hung and morale plummeted... until the two most powerful voices in all of Eos approached their tired armies; Nirtok, Overseer of the Ironclad Army and Xa, Overseer of all Extropian peoples. Both stood tall
before their armies and delivered powerful yet all-too-similar words:]

"Extropians, the time is now...
We'll be the keeper of the stars.
We guide this world...
But our enemy is holding us back.
With the rage of beasts, they assemble for war!
Years of Machinations have come down to this day...

So let it be known: War is at hand.
For years we have grown apart...
The time to divide has come.
Who will you die for?
We are faced with the end of an era...

...This is fight or flight. Fly or die.
There's no more questioning when you look at the sky.
...So together we'll fight: With unity and pride.

And with the MechaGod...
We will silence the voice...
Heavensent from the sky...
Extropians: We are the Judgement.
We have the power to hush the roar of silence!
We have the power to tip the scales of existence,
And change all that is Time and God!â
- Xa, Extropian Council Overseer

...We are all the Arbiter...

Now We Diverge:
