[As the Ironclad and Extropian forces charged, a massive conflux of the two armies occurred. Blood spilled and lives were lost as each side struggled to be the one allowed to live on. The Great Divide was in full effect. Clashes of armor, weapons and icy explosions shook
the Azurean Shores, and echoed deep into the heart of Terragrove. Screams of victory and agony danced among each other to the song of battle. This is War.]

"Now We Divide!
Ironclads, your end is now!
We will ascend!
In the end we will stand triumphant!
...We will stand triumphant!
We will be immortal!
...We will stand triumphant!
...We will stand triumphant!
You will bow to our black hearts!
...We will triumph!

Now is our time; We divide and... we will conquer all!
...Conquer all!
...We will conquer!"
- Shouts from Extropian Soldiers

"We kill, we die... but time marches on!
We've grown apart... so we can grow strong."
- Xau, Extropian Elder

"Find your faith in the MechaGod,
It will see us live forever!
Do you really think... God will save you?
How could you hide from the truth?
There can only be... One Fate.
How could ours be untrue?
What you believe... Is the source of all suffering!
Why can't you see?... Your way of life is nothing!"
- Xa, Extropian Council Overseer

"We kill, we die... but time marches on!
We've grown apart... how can we grow strong?"
- Xau, Extropian Elder

"Only we... will see the face of Time.
Only we... can see the face of "God."
When we arrive in Eternity...
...We will be at peace.
No longer burdened by your ways.
And then we can ascend!"
- Xa, Extropian Council Overseer

"We kill, we die... but time marches on!
We've grown apart... now we can't grow strong..."
- Xau, Extropian Elder

...This isn't over yet!
