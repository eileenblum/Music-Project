[After days of bloodshed and defense against the Extropian onslaught, the Ironclad Army drove away their foes. Having retreated, the Extropians and their supposed "MechaGod" did not seem so powerful, after all. That evening, the Ironclad and their people celebrated their
victory. Nirtok, the Grand Overseer of the Ironclad, stood upon a high rock in the city square and shouted to his people:]

"My brothers! Today we know glory!
We defend our beliefs and our families!
The wind is on our backs...
And for the Ironclad, this day is one of victory!"
- Nirtok, Ironclad Overseer

"Illustrious transcendence,
Steel to toil and blood.
Hallowed be these grounds,
Laced with grandeur.

Echoing;
All the reasons that they fought,
Monument to what they loved.
Fraught with deceit and rooted in terror,
The spoils of immortality cannot be denied."
- Ma'tau, Ironclad Stargazer

"...But we have not, heard the end of the Extropians!
I know they will hope for our every death!
Yet when they reassemble for war...
Fear us, for they will lie dead!

Then we will truly see,
Who will be gone, and who will live forever...
...And who will live forever? Who will be gone?
(Then, we will truly see!)"
- Nirtok, Ironclad Overseer

"And now the Light Dawn is free to rise!
They programmed their limitations... ours end at the sky!"
- Cocidius, Dreadnaut Warlord

âVictory and defeat are each of the same price.â
- Thomas Jefferson

"We will pay, all the same, to show our enemy...
The power of the Light!"
- Elos, Ironclad Hero
