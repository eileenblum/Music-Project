[As the Ironclad and Extropian forces charged, a massive conflux of the two armies occurred. Blood spilled and lives were lost as each side struggled to be the one allowed to live on. The Great Divide was in full effect. Clashes of armor, weapons and icy explosions shook
the Azurean Shores, and echoed deep into the heart of Terragrove. Screams of victory and agony danced among each other to the song of battle. This is War.]

"Now We Divide!
Extropians, this is your end!
And we will rise again!
In the end we will stand triumphant!
Nature will overgrow!
...We will stand triumphant!
...We will stand triumphant!
Our violence will tear you apart!
...We will stand triumphant!
...We will triumph!

And now; Our time! Divide and prepare! We Will Conquer all!
...Conquer all!
...We will conquer!"
- Shouts from Ironclad Warriors

"We kill, we die... but time marches on!
We've grown apart... so we can grow strong."
- Lumo, Enlightened Ironclad

"Find your faith in Earth,
She will guide us home!
Do you really think... You will ascend from Earth?
How could you hide from the truth?
There can only be One God.
How could ours be untrue?
...What you believe, Is the source of all suffering!
...Why can't you see? Your way of life is nothing!"
- Nirtok, Ironclad Overseer

"We kill, we die... but time marches on!
We've grown apart... how can we grow strong?"
- Lumo, Enlightened Ironclad

"Only we... will see the face of Time.
Only we... will see the face of Time!
When we arrive... in Heaven...
...We will be at peace.
No longer burdened by your ways.
And then we can ascend!"
- Cocidius, Dreadnaut Warlord

"We kill, we die... but time marches on!
We've grown apart... now we can't grow strong..."
- Lumo, Enlightened Ironclad

...This isn't over yet!
