[Touretteâs Guy:] âThe last time I gave a shitâ¦ I got fucked!â

Letâs Go!

[Bringer of the Red Dawn]
I have been waiting for this day to come: We put in our time. Our dedication.
We want so much more but what we have, we fucking earned.
Can you say the same? Or will you leech your way to the top?
You want everything, but we have so much more!

[Wings of the Albatross]
Is this what you call musicianship? Have you really worked so hard for this?
Riding the wings of the Albatross just to stand here with us today.

[Clockburner]
These days are passing faster than you know.
These days are passing faster than you know, I am watching you drown in
yourself!
So drown in yourself as days go by:
Finally this day has come. We put in our time, our dedication.
We want so much more but what we have, we fucking earned.

[Decree of Annihilation]
Youâre fucking weak!
As we ride into battle, you should probablyâ¦
Prepare to die!
With my brothers by my side: take steed motherfuckers!
Itâs time to ride!
Hooves of THUNDER. Wings of FLAME. Blades of STEEL. Bringers of PAIN.
We... shall... always... rise!
