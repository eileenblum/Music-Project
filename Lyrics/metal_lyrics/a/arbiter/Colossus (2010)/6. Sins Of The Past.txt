Please forgive me for what I have done. I need a new life now, far from what
Iâve become.
I can never let go of that binding stress. Years have gone by now and still I
regret.
Those black days, are never leaving me. Those days are never letting me go.
So how can we move on from the sins of the past?
And how can we grow strong for the deeds of the future?

[AiaeaiA]
Look to the skies and shed this frustration. Just let it go.
Peel away the skin of the past. Chip away the sins of the past.

[Crooked, Twisted]
We canât forget, our horrid past. Our wrongful ways will always show...
Through this rotted, wood of despise. Crooked, Twisted: Cursed... as deserved.

[Out of Body]
Now lift your head up and see yourself. (Now lift your head up and see yourself
moving on.)
Gaze in your mirror, and see yourself. (Gaze in your mirror, and see yourself
moving forward.)
Look out the window and see yourselfâ¦ (Look out the window and see yourself
moving onâ¦ forward to a new day.)

[Out of Mind]
Please forgive us for what we have done, we have a new life now, far from what
weâve become.

[Daymaker]
Head up: shoulders back.
Take it in: this fresh air.
We must move, forward now.
There are new horizons abound.
There is so much more, than what you do in life.
There is so much more, than what you do in life.

[AiaeaiA]
Forward: holding nothing back. Live for yourself: strive for ultimate success.
Go now: time spent moving on. Lift your head up and shine on.
May the wind be on your back.
