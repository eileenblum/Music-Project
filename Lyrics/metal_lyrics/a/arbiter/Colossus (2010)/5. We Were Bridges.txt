[Severance]
How can you sleep at night knowing I am suffering?
You fucking shameless and worthless slut.
This swelling hatred is far from gone.
Then shut your fucking eyes and look away.
This was the last time.
Your last chance to steal innocent life.
Your last chance to destroy what I have come to be.

[Bridgeburner]
Iâve watched this family fall apart...
ONE BY ONE!
Iâve watched my friends pack their bags and fucking leave.
I canât be blamed for their ill decisions.
I canât be blamed for their ill decisions.
You are all a failure in my eyes.
Youâre all a failure to each other.
I canât be blamed for your ill decisions.
I canât be blamed for your ill decisions.
So fuck yourself over in your sleep, cus youâre nothing to me you worthless
slut.
This swelling hatred is far from goneâ¦
So shut your fucking eyes and die away.
FUCK!

Return from whence you came: The Succubus of Shame.
