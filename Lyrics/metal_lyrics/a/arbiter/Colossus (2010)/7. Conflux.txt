[Your Eyes in Mine]
And this page is useless. A pen spilling inkâ¦ Erase it.

[Your Mind in Mine]
âLet him who crawls enamourâd of decay, Cling to his couch, and sicken years
away;
Heave his thick breath, and shake his palsied head; Oursâthe fresh turf, and
not his feverish bedâ

[To Null the Void; A Thought Divine]
And from nothing comes something elseâ¦
Abysma hugs my thoughts. Course the edge of existence...
Like Columbus weâll sail and scale the walls universal.
We will only sleep at night when the stars are mounted, like trophies:
glimmering/rings brandished, synchronized/eyes dilated in fear/earshot of a
void/avoiding consumption/shun the thoughts of glimmering/rings brandished,
synchronized/eyes dilated in fear/earshot of a void/avoiding consumption/shun
the thoughts of nothing:

[A Sudden Burst of Clarity]
Live.

[A Lost Rainbow of Frailty]
Colors exploding in fluid waveform.
Pen is useless no more, witness the prismatic refraction,
to and from these directions to a new frontier:
it is our fear that keeps us sitting and sleepingâ¦
but in our fearâ¦ weâre stronger than ever!

[With Gale Force Winds]
Brace yourself for the change, Itâs in the air!
Brace yourself for the change, Itâs in the air.
You can feel it in your bones, Life wonât be the same:
Colors exploding in fluid waveform.

[A Religion]
Live your dreams. Blind: Youâll see.
The picture is painted with your dreams.
Bring it all, together now...
Though art is lostâ¦ Weâll find it again.

[The Conflux Has Arrived]
âBeholdâbut who hath seen or eâer shall see,
Man as himselfâthe secret spirit free?â¦
(And cry, Remembrance saddening oâer each brow,)
How had the brave who fell exulted NOW!â
After years of world-bending machinations, triumph is at hand.

[Your eyes in mine, your mind in mine, To null the void; a thought divine:
A sudden burst of clarity, A lost rainbow of frailty...
With Gale Force winds, A religion:
The Conflux has arrived.]
