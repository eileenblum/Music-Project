In Conquest; think not of the pawns, for the King yet reigns.

[Judgement Arrives]
We are Arbiter.

[Unspired]
This year the dead will mourn for the living.
A sudden silence is the music of birth.
This year the dead will dance around the fire
to celebrate what life was never worth.

[Screams of Warcall]
Watch the dusk of a new dawn, learn the words to a new song.
Push back your fears of death: we are warriors now.
We are warriors now. Watch us stand merciless.

[Whispers of Deadfall]
I am Silence, Hear me ROAR.
Hear me! Hear me now!
Kingdoms fall to my whispers, this world bows to my screams!
I am silence so hear me roar. I am silence so hear me roar.
