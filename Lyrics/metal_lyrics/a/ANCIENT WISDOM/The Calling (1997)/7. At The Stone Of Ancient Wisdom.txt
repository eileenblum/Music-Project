I call onto thee, Father of Sin 
Eyes glowing with the flames of Hell 
Sulphur-fire burning within 
I call onto thee, enslaver of light 
I'm your servant, your tool and son 
Accept my gift in this Cursed night 

Father, I give you my blood 
At the Stone of Ancient Wisdom 
I give you my blood 

I call onto thee, bringer of storms 
Whom will consume the earth 
Yet your Flame keeps me warm 
I call onto thee, King of all Kings 
Oh, Great Dragon, bring me Hell 
Embrace me with your wings

:and blood kept on falling from the blackened sky,
mixed with feathers and tears from all those who died 
A kingdom once filled with joy and warmth, 
now forever buried beneath the shadow of our Horn-Crowned Master: 

I call onto thee, Father of Sin 
Eyes glowing with the flames of Hell 
Sulphur-fire burning within 
I call onto thee, enslaver of light 
I'm your servant, your tool and son 
Accept my gift in this Cursed night 

Father, I give you my blood 
At the Stone of Ancient Wisdom 
I give you my blood
