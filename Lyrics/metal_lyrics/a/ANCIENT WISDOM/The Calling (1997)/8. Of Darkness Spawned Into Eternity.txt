The seed of Darkness planted in the depths of my soul 
Evil, ancient Demons gathered, a corn of Fire sown

My chamber within carry the pride of the Beast 
I'm branded with Sin, upon the slaves of god I feast 

Born, never to follow the laws of your feeble lord 
Born to raise the Flag of Hell and lead our supreme horde 
Born, never to bow before your crucified idol 
Born to serve unto Satan, serve unto Him 

The seed of Darkness planted in the depths of my soul 
Evil, ancient Demons gathered, a corn of Fire sown 
Sulphurfields, where His image burn 
Engraved onto my soul, His image burn

My chamber within carry the pride of the Beast 
I'm branded with Sin, upon the slaves of god I feast
