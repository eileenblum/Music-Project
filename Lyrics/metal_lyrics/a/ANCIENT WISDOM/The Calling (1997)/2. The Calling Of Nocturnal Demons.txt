Come forth, possess me
Servants of Satan 
In this night I'll dethrone him 
The king of the jews 

Rise, enchant me 
Grasp my soul 
Incantation of Fire 
Consumes the light 
Greet the Flames, disciples of christ 

By the Flame in my soul 
I gaze through this world 

Come forth, possess me 
Servants of Lucifer 
Bring me Thy strenght 
Infernal Chaos 
As I summon the Demons of Yours 

By the Flame in my soul
I'll drown this world in blood
