Plunged down are the twelve holy gates 
Shattered angels, their blood stains the golden streets 
Demonhordes, blaspheme the image of god 
Seven spirits dead, never to be seen again 

The spiritual strenght of Hell smashed the chain 
The Great Dragon, free to reign supreme 
The sky is darkened by the Abyss smoke 
The thousand years, never to come again 

Twelve apostles of the lamb thrown into the lake of burning sulphur, 
for those are now truly slaves under the Horned One, the Father of all time:
:The second death awaits those, who's name was written in the book of life: 

The second war, in the heavenly realms 
Servants of god, tormented in the Lake 
Their thrones are burned and the lamb cries 
Jesus Christ, never to be worshipped again 

And the battle is over 
The "glory" of god is buried 
And so is his kingdom 
The Ancient Serpent stands tall 
The Dragon: the Beast: the Father: The Devil: Lord Satan: Hail Him.
