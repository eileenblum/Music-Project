Through the Grimlands, on paths unknown 
Through the godless realm, following the visions call 
Shadows, unite me with Evil 
Let me chare your darkest pride 
Unveil Thy kingdom wide 

And the gate was opened 
My eyes, eaten by the frost 
Blinded by icewinds 
Carried away on Ravenwings 

Through Frostlands of Profanity 
Through the Eternal Wintersky
Visions of Ancient Blasphemy 
The ones of light must die

Eternalized through Hailstorms 
An Entity of Hate 
Enthralled Domains of Darkness 
Holds the Beast's Fate 

Within His castle, a throne of ice 
Beyond the fortresswalls, a Profane Domain Forlorn 
The Shadows, the Guardians of His land 
Furious winds They ride 
In the Profane Domain of the Frostbeast
