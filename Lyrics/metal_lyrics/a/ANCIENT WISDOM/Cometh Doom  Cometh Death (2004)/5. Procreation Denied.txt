Embodied fire
(Fiercely) emerging from the deep
A sulphurplague embraces the earth
Feeble humans, poisoned by their spell
Unable to breed again

Wombs infected and semen turned to pus
Infants impaled and on stakes torched alive
Feeble humans, extinguished by their spell
Never to breed again

Mankind, forever gone
Grand destruction of Jehovahs sons
Hail the final genocide
Procreation denied

Embodied fire
Descending to the depths
A total death embraces the earth
Filthy humans, never to breed again
Never to walk the earth ever again

Mankind, forever gone
Grand destruction of Jehovahs sons
Hail the final genocide
Procreation denied
