Take a deep look into these eyes of mine
Fear the legion that stands behind me
Our vengeance will take the life of thine
We take pleasure in murdering thee

With the strenght of countless of storms
We arise, burning with hatred
With joy we'll take the life of yours
We arise to seal your fate

We've come to execute you
The earth you walk shall die too
Triumph infernal
Our vengeance equals your doom

The soil is poisoned by blood
Christ's children are turned to dust
We've reversed the ways of your god
Retaliation of the rebellious

We've come to execute you
The earth you walk shall die too
Triumph infernal
Our vengeance equals your doom
We are what was and shall be
The death of man you shall see
Triumph infernal
Our vengeance equals your doom
