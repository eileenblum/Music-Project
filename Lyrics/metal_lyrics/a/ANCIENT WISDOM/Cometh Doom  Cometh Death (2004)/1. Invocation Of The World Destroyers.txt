I invoke thee
Majestic destoyers of life
Great bringers of torment
I command you to rise
Apocalyptic triumph
Darkness veiling the world
Great bringers of havoc
Let your fury be heard

Thy legions come
Thy will be done

Come forth, legions of Satan
Burning with strife
Come forth, legions of Hell
Punish all life
Bring torture
Bring death
Great plagues unfurl
In the name of Lucifer
They will destroy this world

Nowhere to run, no shelter to find
They'll slit the throat of the whole mankind

I invoke thee
Majestic destoyers of life
Great bringers of torment
I command you to rise
Apocalyptic triumph
Darkness veiling the world
Great bringers of havoc
Let your fury be heard

Thy legions come
Thy will be done
