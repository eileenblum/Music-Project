The sun will be darkened
The moon will not shed it's light
Ravenous storms encircle the earth
And winds of fire consumes all life
Perdition comes with thunder
Flames are raining from the sky
The holy empire is failing
Humanity is doomed to die

Death is coming like a ferocious storm
The wind brings diseases and pain
The earth is an open and bleeding wound
All her energy has been drained

Welcome doom, call forth the final demise
Welcome death, after doom thou shall rise

The earth is shrouded in ashes
A dead monument is all that remains
The sun has been darkened
Mankind exterminated
Perdition came with thunder
Fire brought down the sky
The holy empire has failed
And all of mankind has died

Death is coming like a ferocious storm
The wind brings diseases and pain
The earth is an open and bleeding wound
All her energy has been drained

Welcome doom, call forth the final demise
Welcome death, after doom thou shall rise
