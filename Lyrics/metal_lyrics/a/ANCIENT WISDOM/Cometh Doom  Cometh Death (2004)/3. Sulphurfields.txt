Dimensions shattered, torn apart
Merged into a new universe

The four elements, turned into one
An existence of fire created
Eternal torment, burning
Humanity burning, eternally

Doomed to wander the Sulphurfields
Cursed to the realm of the Sulphurfields

Scorching winds
Blazing high
Searing storms
Crimson sky

The flames are sentencing you all to death
Their tounges speak with a burning breath
This eternal land burning bright
In torment you'll die by their spite

Scorching winds
Blazing high
Searing storms
Crimson sky

Doomed to wander the Sulphurfields
Cursed to the realm of the Sulphurfields

Dimensions shattered, merged into one
An existence of fire created
Eternal torment, burning
Humanity burning, eternally
