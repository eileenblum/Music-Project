The earth trembles and shake,
The soil breeds flames
Demons rising with wings of fire
And He comes forth, the fallen from grace
Risen in rage

With swords of fire held high in fury
A spiritual battle on earth
Legions are summoned, legions from hell
God's creation burns

The air reeks of burning flesh,
And the sky is covered by smoke
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Jehovah's creation destroyed by Lucifer's lust
