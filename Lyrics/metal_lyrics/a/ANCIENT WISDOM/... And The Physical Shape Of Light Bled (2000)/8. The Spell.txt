Take your place in the circle
Watch the mystery unwind
One cup of your lifeblood
Two parts of your mind
Thirteen faceless disciples
In a room froze with fear
Summoned there by the master
Then he appears
Under the spell
The mark of the Beast is upon you now
Under the spell
The mark of the Beast. You must serve him well.
Under the spell
Dances at midnight
Naked but for the mask
Feasting Heaven's destruction
The spell has been cast
The power is total
Eclipse of the Son
Evil forces are strongest
His will to be done
Under the spell
The mark of the Beast is upon you now
Under the spell
The mark of the Beast. You must serve him well.
Under the spell
We all bear witness
To the ritual of life
While some choose to follow
The shadows of night
Forever banished in darkness
For those who've taken the vow
These things are of your own doing
You'll pay for it now
Under the spell
The mark of the Beast is upon you now
Under the spell
The mark of the Beast. You must serve him well.
Under the spell
