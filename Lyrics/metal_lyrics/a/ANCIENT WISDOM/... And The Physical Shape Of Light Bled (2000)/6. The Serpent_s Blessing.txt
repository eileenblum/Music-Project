The Garden of Eden is silent
The presence of god is not there
Take a deep look into the Eye of the Serpent
Your pureness will then disappear
It opens your mind, it will open your eyes
Embrace the powers of Satan
Free yourself from Jehovah's lies

Rebellious souls of the past
Blessed us with sin
By turning their back on god
The Serpent he triumphed
It opens your mind, it will open your eyes
Embrace the powers of Satan
Free yourself from Jehovah's lies

The Garden of Eden is silent
The presence of god is not there
Take a deep look into the Eye of the Serpent
Your pureness will then disappear
It opens your mind, it will open your eyes
Embrace the powers of Satan
Free yourself from Jehovah's lies
