Funeral Of The Mind
A Journey Called Dreams
To Kneel Before The Black
As The Gate Opens

I Follow The Raven
Through Moonlit Gates
Into Castles, Where Hymns
Are Blasphemous
Where Darkness Is Light
Where Death Is Life
Where Candles Burn Forever

And As Shadows Become Pale
The Throne Belong To Us
Us, Who Forever Lives In Darkness
