The Cold Breeze Touches Me
And The Dark Clouds Fill The Sky
I Travel Alone
Ravens Land Next To Me
Their Eyes Are Black As The Night
They Guide Me Through

This Can't Be True
I Can Not Be This Near
Now I Will Leave

At This Place I Have Always
Longed To Be
To Enter The Dead
I Have Crossed The Endless Rivers
To Where Death Is Real
My Heart, Eternally Black

This Can't Be True
I Have Arrived
My Kingdom Is Here
Forever
