A Cold Wind Will Rise
From The Graves Where Darkened Kings
Slept Their Eternal Sleep
And As Snow Covered The Northland
Veins Of Life Becomes Empty
And Sky Turns Black
While Blood Melts The Icealtar

Through Storms Of Ancient Wrath I Sail
Into Lands Of The Blackened Sun
And As I Reach The Shore Of Dwelling Souls
The Black Winds Of Death
Embrace Me

Gazing Into A Lost Millennium
Only Touched By Hands Of Evil
Unknown Powers Forever Resting
* For The Dead Has Been Enthroned
And I Am Forever Here
In The Land Where Snow Falls
Falls Forever *

Through Storms Of Ancient Wrath I've
Through Lands Of The Blackened Sun
And As I Reached The Shore Of Dwelling Souls
The Black Winds Of Death
Embraced Me
I Am Free
