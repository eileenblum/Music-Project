As Howlings Sound
And The Moon Is Full
Candles Create The Only Light
While I Raise The Chalice Of Mine

I See Myself Reflected
In The Goats Eye
My Blood Is Released
And I Lick The Wounds

Now I Am The Beast
Together With Other Immortals
Summoning Thy Ancient Ones
Until End Of Time
In The Forest Where Spirits Forever Dwell
