...all i have felt i have suffered with words
are only emotions of mine.. they little matter
storms of withered and decadent life
desires and sufferings awaken with hate and wounded feelings
... with cold marks of death
oblivion: cover me in cold earth with a tunic of mist forgotten
oblivion: make my emotions melt under the black sky of a moonless night
"to stop pain causes pain" whispers the nocturnal wind
my last tears flow to form a puddle of desperation
where he dark flower of my desires be born... and my hate!
the face of solitude stares at me telling me:
"i invited you to suffer in this sepulchral life
you can come back to the void... eternity i am"
