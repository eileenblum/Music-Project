...behind my eyes
a black space remains where nightmares reign
the inner empire of shadows
a dance to the abyss of silence
the antechamber to cruel reality
the refuge to this worldly hostile empire
the oniric projection with hate, towards life
perishable nightmares of an inevitable dawn
where I just find death, ruin and desperation
under this empty sky, I scorn human feeling
and I shall rest in the enclosure of my gloomy dreams
cold and eternal...
