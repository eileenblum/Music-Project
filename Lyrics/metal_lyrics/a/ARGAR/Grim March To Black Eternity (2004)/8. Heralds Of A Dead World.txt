...th etime of benegrance falls, slow and sad
dark paths where everlasting hate fights
suffering continues and pain is endless
human flame involves the light of life
heralds of a dead world
make their destiny on their black weapons
the wind of anguish sharpens its hate
blood of wards flows from inert earth
listen to the screams of a meaningless race!
look at your destiny through the raven's eyes
breath takes the throne of life
victory has always been for her
you've just been means for her inexorable victory
you are just greed
you and just hate
you are bengrance and the virus of life...
heralds of a dead world..
condemned to the eternal shadow... heralds of the dead world
