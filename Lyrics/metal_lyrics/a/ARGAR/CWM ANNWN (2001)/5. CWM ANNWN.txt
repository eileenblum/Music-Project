Fatality heralds
United next to disturbed corpses
Condemned souls... lost in limbo

Nocturnal beings... on eternal (infernal) pilgrimage
We're invoked by our Lord... God of the dead
Gatherer God of heathen souls... Death;s Persecutor we're invoked!

We appear from deepest crevices of hell
To exterminate innocent souls and unbaptized creatures

Our black horses neigh...
Our black wolves howl...
Our black swords long for opening human flesh
Our gloomy hunting begins...

We appear from the deep forest to lived-in days
Reddish moon illuminates our path
Our spectral troops hunt population's catches
Communion among blood, fire and steel has culminated
Our eternal roam will follow without mercy
The dead's god will stay satisfied...
