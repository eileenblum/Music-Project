Nightfall over the reign of... greed
...Of egoism... of weakness...

Night over civilization's paradise
Is a shroud tumulus

We stay sunken
In hypocrisy's throne

Honour and death
Dictate our tyrannized black souls

Greed's throne...
Must die

War of vengeance
Of hate... of blood

Our eyes reflect our ancients' wrath
Earthily forces of heathen empire possess us...
Destruction ceremony, purification ritual, attack!!!

Storms of acid rain will cross your closed minds
Winds of wrath exalt echoes of human agony
Millions of corpses will form the stone of infamous civilization

Lunar dawn shows miserly mankind's result
Victory!!!

Lunar dawn shows miserly mankind's result
Result of hate... of blood... of death...
Pure hate black!!!!
