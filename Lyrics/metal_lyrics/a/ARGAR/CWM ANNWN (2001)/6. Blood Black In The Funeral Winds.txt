Born in the dark maternal earth's centre
Bastards of heaven, of the light, of the sun
Owners of the night, tied to the shadow's world
Born in the black kingdom, of thickness and darkwood
Bred by the black goddess of heaven and night

Taught to the war's art
Preparation to the death's art
Destined to give the suffering art

Red travel that we begin from hell
Red in the wind of foulsmelling air
With our red stench...

Red souls we slide against the wind and the light
Blood black in the wind
Coming the frost moon winter
Black souls capturing the life of sun
Coming the war, coming the death and the suffering
Blood black in the wind
