You ask me for my blessing
But that I cannot give
A monument to a false legacy of a life you didn't live

To spend your time stacking stones
A good way to be overthrown
And build your tower out of bones
On the back of another's groans

No I don't have all the answers to the questions that you seek
But I know that you're preoccupied with the wrong side of these
Machinations in your plans
You can build your tower with your own damn hands

You can build that tower high
Build it toward the summer sky
But it will fall
You hollow minded fool, you did it all in vain

When the brick and mortar fails
Know your deeds write better tales
And only time can teach the lesson child
You will learn
