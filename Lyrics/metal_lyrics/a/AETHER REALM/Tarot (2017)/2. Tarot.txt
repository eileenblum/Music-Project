Riding hard through the barren wasteland
Over mountains and plains
Pursued by a foe out to claim my homeland
One will die this day
I fear the worst for this foe is peerless
with the axe and the sword
in facing this trial
One chance for suvival
A witc lives in these woods

Burdened by the farsight
Cursed to live a half life
Can't you see we all are blind
Spare me your riddles witch, can't you see?
They mean nothing to me

Take what you must from me
To gaze into the future
The light is fading and I don't have much to lose
What are you waiting for
Go ahead and deal the cards
You've the knowledge I need to win this war

Doomed to a life on the run forever
Will I fall if I stand and fight
Only one way to know
I've nowhere else to go
So let my fortune be told

Burdened by the farsight
Heard you the first time, won't change my mind
Cursed to live a half life
Gave you all I had, and I'm out of time
Can't you see we all are blind
Spare me your riddles witch, can't you see?
They mean nothing to me

Spark the incense, kill the lights
Place your trust in the runes and the bones
Only you have the means to say the future
it is written in stone

Far to the north in the land where the cold winds blow
You'll find yourself feeling lost and alone
It is there you will meet your end
At the edge of the earth you will die my friend

So make your stand in the fading light
And have no fear you will win this fight
Have faith in yourself, you have come this far
Strike true my child
