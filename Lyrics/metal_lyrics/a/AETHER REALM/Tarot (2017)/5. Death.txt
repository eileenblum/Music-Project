Sister dear, I never dreamed that I would find you
In the light of the dying day
I see the tears reflect the light upon you
And it's been so long since I've seen your face

Faced with the dark, I once chose wisely
I felt the light and it felt good
But three years and I don't know what happened
But something changed in me

He feels numb lost in time
Hears whispers of a world in an endless night
But he won't miss the life he had
If this is really death then it's not so bad

Fed to the crows, they picked my bones
And left my body to decay at the whipping post
I can still see the blood running through my hands
And if I had another chance to live I think I'd rather be dead

He feels numb lost in time
Hears whispers of a world in an endless night
But he won't miss the life he had
If this is really death then it's not so bad

He feels numb lost in time
Hears whispers of a world in an endless night
But he won't miss the life he had
If this is really death then it's not so bad
