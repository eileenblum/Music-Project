Your obsession will swallow you whole

The chill of death clings heavy
And the stench of blood still strong
Can the gnawing of guilt of your blunder
drive you to face the devil you spawned?

His pallid skin hangs loosely, with a chaos in his wake
A harbringer of sorrow, fear, of pestilence and plague

So whether you will survive, will be for you to decide
Can you break the cycle of madness festering
Deep inside of your mind?

You can read the scrolls and consult the tomes
That the ancient ones laid down
And you may find a way to sever the bond
Or you may find the solution's only total
self annihilation

This will cause your name to mean traitor
And the accusation rings true
You see, you blindly lusted for power
And then you gave the devil his due

The circle drawn, the blood released
That ritual performed
And then the awe replaced by horror
As you beheld the terrible form

So when the smoke begins to rise
O'er ashes of your kind
It's only then you'll know the cost
Reach inside, expose it all to the light

This task won't fulfill you, it might even kill you
But the choosing is easy if you don't have a choice

It's time, to kneel to the floor
And savor that last sweet breath
As you're sharpening the blade
You will use to extinguish the inferno made flesh

All it took was a drop of your blood
And it was summoned from the fiery plane
But you know the incantation weakens over time, you only have
yourself to blame
to send it back from whence it came

You will bleed yourself until you're barely clinging onto life
Not enough, you're gonna need another pint
So draw your sigil, thumb the blade now meant for you
In your heart you've always known what you must do
Raise that knife above your head and drive it down

So twist the knife into my side, it's through that pain I feel alive
I want the world to know I threw it all away

He to the world appeared to die
But in his heart he felt divine
He wants the world to know
To heed to the call

You feel the fear consume you cold as ice
A wretched token of your sacriface
Bind your souls and cast them down to save your kind
Before you find

Why should I cast my soul away for a world that never cared for me?
