In the comfort of the water's cold embrace
Gripped tight by the undertow
I let the water carry me away

Drifting far from the sight of land
A strange calm and inner peace
The monumental choice but a distant feeling

Feel the terror taking hold
Grip and break your bones
It will drag you down
Push the feeling deep inside
Reach and calm your mind

Light will dim, and hope recedes
You can hang yourself from the gallows tree
But in time even the mightiest oaks will fall
Will you still be there at the end of it all?
Ash to ash, dust to dust
Swords grow dull and iron rusts
I feel the weight of the water bearing down on me
But I got two good hands and I know my strength

Tje calm pierced by a realization
I have to swim for shore
This is not the way I'm meant to go

There's a peculiar beauty
Revealed when your flame burns low
That blurs the lines between the light and the darkness

Feel the horror sinking in
Rip and tear your skin
It will drag you down
Push the feeling deep inside
Reach and calm your mind

Skies cloaked in darkness
The fire starts to fade
Shivering, friendless
And I'm afraid I've lost my way

What if I never had the power
What if I never had the will
Then all remaining is the journey
It had to mean something
