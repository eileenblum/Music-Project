Long have been complacent with the hand I've been dealt
Restless and weak from the life I've built
So I'll journey afar, for there's glory to find
And I'll fill out my entry in the annals of time

Bid my farewell to the ones I love
Their grief but a fleeting feeling
For nature is calling, my heart compelled
Every branch, every leaf has a story to tell

Fear is swirling within me
A tightening grip on my heart
In a world where nothing is certain
The fear of failure looms large

No room for these doubts
I'll cast them far away and
Take up my father's sword
History favors the daring
And only the brave will receive the eternal reward

Will you be here ready to guide me?
When I must leave this dream behind me
A beacon of hope, but fading away
I have to let that light die

Mother, father, sister
I'm sorry for what I've done
But the man I've become is
Is no longer content with comfort and home

Cold is the wind that chills me down to my bones
And cold is the knowledge that for this I abandoned my home
Cold is my sorrow, like a knife in my chest
And cold is the path that I chose
For what worth can be found in glory in the lands that I roam

Raise your eyes, case your gaze high
And forget your sorrows

Cold is the wind that chills me down to my bones
And cold is the knowledge that for this I abandoned my home
Cold is my sorrow, like a knife in my chest
And cold is the path that I walk
But I carry those memories close to my heart
And remember them fondly when I gaze at
The sun, the moon, the stars

So we'll find our dreams fade in time
In time our dreams leave us blind

By moonlight and starlight
Those shadows led me astray
Take comfort in darkness
Hide me away from the light

Hide with me from the light my child
I'll show you another way
Burn away your sorrow in the cleansing fire of power

Colors swirling around me
Shifting landscapes obey my every command
But still I don't possess the power to fill the emptiness

Swallow and take what you thought you were meant to be
And reconcile it with who you are
Another lesson learned in time, and, oh, you'll find
You don't know what you want until it's gone

I've hailed to the cosmic masters
I've walked the astral plane
And travelled to distant worlds

Time like a river flows,
The one thing I don't have the power to change
The only thing that matters

Mother, father, sister
I'm sorry for what I've done
For the man I've become
Finally knows the true power in home

A broken legacy
A tale of tragedy
Take heed my friends
The path of pain isn't always
The means to the end you seek

By moonlight and starlight
I turn my gaze to the sky

The sun, the moon, the stars
Shine less brightly with you so far
I never knew sorrow
'Til you asked me to follow my heart
For all the tales I've told
And these whispers of silver and gold
I'd throw them all away
To gaze on your face once more

One more time

With his burning brand he split the skies
And plucked out the stars, one by one
With an aching heart he cursed his name
And nothing would shine as bright as her again
