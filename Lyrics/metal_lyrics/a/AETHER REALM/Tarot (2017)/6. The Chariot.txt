For far too long I've been imprisoned in the dark
Held by the fear that stills the hands and cools the heart
I can feel it even now
Feel it grip and drag me down
Back down to my comfortable despair

But staying down, it never got me very far
I can refuse to take the fate that's in the cards
Don't be afraid my friend
This need not be the end
But we must make the call
Ask yourself will you rise or fall

So if you think you can stop me
You can think again 'cause I'm going strong
I've got my fight and I've got my drive
And you can cast your doubts but I'll prove you wrong

Sure as the twilight casts the starts across the skies
It's creeping back like a disease that clouds the mind
I feel it every day
Inescapable decay
I hear the calling of the void

When you feel you lack the will to carry on
The deepest darkness of the night's before the dawn
Don't let it steal your pride
Just make it feed the flame inside
Oh, you must learn
Find your strength and let it burn

So if you think you can stop me
You can think again 'cause I'm going strong
I've got my fight and I've got my drive
And you can cast your doubts but I'll prove you wrong
So if you think you can save me
You can think again 'cause I'm doing just fine
Oh no, I don't need a saviour
And you can cast your bones, but my fate is mine.

You've labored under every pine
And broke your back a thousand times
Bearer of a thousand scars
Take care not to forget who you are

So don your armor, we won't be delayed
Join the force or get out of our way
Feel the ancient ones guiding your hands
Let go of your fears; heed their demands

So don your armor, we won't be delayed
Take up your arms or get out of our way
Feel the ancient ones guiding your sword
Let fly all your fears and respond to the call

So raise your glasses for the fallen ones
The ones who lose their battle and succumbed
So raise your glasses for the fallen ones
Would you grieve for your fallen son?

So if you think you can stop me
You can think again 'cause I'm going strong
I've got my fight and I've got my drive
And you can cast your doubts but I'll prove you wrong
So if you think you can save me
You can think again 'cause I'm doing just fine
Oh no, I don't need a savior
And you can cast your bones, but my fate is mine.
