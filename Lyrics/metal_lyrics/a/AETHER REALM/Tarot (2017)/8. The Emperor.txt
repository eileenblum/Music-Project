At the throne too afraid to fight
Where are you while your sons and daughters die
Too many years growing fat from the another's work

At the top of the tower high
So unaware that your people may defy you
After years growing lean in a laborious world
and I feel it

Down in my heart, down in my soul
Down in my bones, and the blood that you stole
I think that I feel a change in the wind
So pick up your swords and cover your skins

Ash into ash, and dust into dust
See I'm holding onto live just to fuck you up
So when we come for you, you'll be the first to find
That you're no emperor of mine
No emperor divine
No emperor of mine

You see we've had it up to here you son of a bitch
And now the hammer's coming down, coming down on you
We're gonna take it back, and then we'll take you out

There's nowhere left to run, nowhere left to hide
For justice to be served, the masters must be tried

God damn
Stand up and die with a sword in your hand
Judgement is coming, judgement is nigh
You will be sentenced to death for your crimes
