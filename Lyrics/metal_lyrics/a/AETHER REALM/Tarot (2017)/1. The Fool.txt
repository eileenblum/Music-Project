In the shadow of the light,
I lived as a shadow of my past life.

Tears of the father, blood of the son
Through years of dishonor, come undone
So I'll armor myself with this knowledge
And I'll match my speed to the wind
I'll journey away, far from this place
and pray, none will know me as a "friend"

By moonlight and starlight
Those shadows let me astray
Take comfort in darkness
Hide me away from the light

Her hand gripped mine
I went with an open mind
But the light she shined on me
It burned me deep down to my bones,
And I promised I would never
Allow myself to feel the light again
Through the flesh that sloughed from the bone
Was blackened and diseased
That flash was not my flesh
That blood was not my blood
Yet still in the shadow I hide
Drag me back into the grave
And let me die

Cling to comfort child, no longer
Suffer with pride
The pain: Healing
Wait not, for time will surely
Not wait for thee
Is that the ticking of the clock
Or the beating of your weakening heart?
Hear the thunderous rumbling
