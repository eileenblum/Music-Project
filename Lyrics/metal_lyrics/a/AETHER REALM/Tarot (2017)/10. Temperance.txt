Gods I call to thee
Grant me life and strength
And if my strength should fail
Grant me force of will
Should my will be broke
Grant me light and hope
And If my hope recedes
Give me death and peace

On that autumn day
I met an old friend
With her hand in mine
We sat and talked a while
As the hour grew late
She spoke of a quiet place
Where the gods will hear your prayer
I will take you there

Gods I call to thee
Grant me life and strength
If my strength should fail
Give me force of will
If my will should brake
Grant me light and hope
When my hope recedes
Give me death

Gods I call to thee
Grant me life and strength
If my strength should fail
Give me force of will
If my Will should brake
Grant me light and hope
and when hope recedes
Amen
