A golden sunset 
Prelude to the star cloaked sky 
Yet this beauty only serves to remind me 
Of the passage of time 

We are but grains of sand in an hourglass 
And we're falling fast 
So take haste 
Don't delay 
For the wheels of time's eternal flow 
They halt unfaltering progress for no one 

Another day and another step 
Another hour that we're closer to death 
And what we have we waste away 
Unfeeling cold decay 
And what we have we waste away 
Naive to mortal fate 

We are but grains of sand in an hourglass 
And we're falling fast 
So take haste 
Don't delay 
For the wheels of time's eternal flow 
They halt unfaltering progress for no one 

Fear not your death 
For the hour of your doom is set 
And there is no escape 
Invoke your inner flame 
Ensure that none forget your name 
Time slips away 

Mourn not the dead 
In their tales they live again 
Save your tears for the living 
Who never truly live 

This is your life, so rise up and live 

We are but grains of sand in an hourglass 
And we're falling fast 
So take haste 
Don't delay 
Your time, it slips away
