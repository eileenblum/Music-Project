Without the fire 
And the path from which we strayed 
The cold begins to bite and I begin to fall prey 
To the winter, I feel his icy hands upon my neck 
Unearthly sounds echoing all around 
As the wolves begin to circle for the kill 
The corpses of their victims strewn across the snow
Their eyes reflecting the stars they cannot see 

Blinded by a swirling light 
Drop to your knees and pray 
for your life 

Surrounded by ice and snow, the frozen winds around you blow 
You'll be dead before you stand, the gods have turned their backs 

A force this great not seen for a thousand years 
Leaving nothing in it's wake 
All will fall into the maw 
of terror cloaked in white 
Engulfing all til hunger's satisfied 
You won't escape the winter's grasp 

Just bare your skin 
Accept your fate 
Lie down and wait 
There's no escape
