Something not of this realm
Has sent a chill running down your spine
Intruder! The call raised the alarm
For centuries, for far to long
Trespassed upon her land
The time has come for reaping what we've sown
A cloud of smoke and a flash of light
Should have prepared ourselves for horror's strike
Now there's nothing left to do

As we await our doom
As we begin to melt
Flesh suddenly made liquid, our skeletons unzip themselves
Above the chaos
The moon begins to rise
Come daylight, none will be left alive

For we've fallen on the wrath of the witch
With cold hands and heart of stone
She'll tear our flesh from bone.
Swampwitch!
Caught in her terrible gaze
Taking back the debt unpaid
You've reached the end of days
At the hands of the witch!
Swampwitch!

Hear the rattle, know the sign
Last thoughts of the ones you'll leave behind
This punishment, long in the making
You've brought upon yourself

[Eric's VOKILLS]
The Swampwitch cometh to break my back
She drank my tears and ate my sack
The Swampwitch cut off my limbs and threw
Them all into her Swampwitch brew
The Swampwitch cometh, you're next in line
Recite your prayers, you're out of time
The Swampwitch, she will dine
[END ERIC VOKILLS]

For we've fallen on the wrath of the witch
With cold hands and heart of stone
She'll tear our flesh from bone.
Swampwitch!
Caught in her terrible gaze
Taking back the debt unpaid
You've reached the end of days
At the hands of the witch!
Swampwitch!

[Jack solo]

As we await our doom
As we begin to melt
Flesh suddenly made liquid, our skeletons unzip themselves
Above the chaos
The moon begins to rise
Come daylight, you will be left to die

ARGGHHH
EEYYAAH
BLEGH
UGH

For we've fallen on the wrath of the witch
With cold hands and heart of stone
She'll tear our flesh from bone.
Swampwitch!
Caught in her terrible gaze
Taking back the debt unpaid
You've reached the end of days
At the hands of the witch!
Swampwitch!
