The color drained from life 
A crushing hopeless mist 
I'm standing at the edge of the abyss 

Possessor of ancient might 
Knower of the ancient light 
You've given but not received 
A rope and a branch are all I need 
Possessor of ancient might 
Knower of the ancient light 
You've given but not received 
Will you bestow these gifts on me 

As I climb closer toward 
My sweet untimely end 
My thoughts, they wander as I ascend 
My future is written in blood 

As I turn my gaze to the stars 
One last look at the world I loved 

Perched upon the brink with the noose around my neck 
I've made my choice, I won't look back 
And yet I'm somehow called to wait 
Perched upon the brink with the rope around my neck 
But a force unseen commands look back 
I see what I have left to give 

As I climb closer toward 
My sweet untimely end 
My thoughts, they wander as I ascend 
What the future holds for me 

As I turn my gaze to the sky 
One last look at the world I love 
And I break from the embrace of the oak 

Possessor of ancient might 
Knower of the ancient light 
You've given but not received 
Why would you bestow these gifts on me 
Possessor of ancient might 
You've looked to the ancient skies 
Instilling a hope in me
