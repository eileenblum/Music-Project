I am one chosen by the gods 

As the down begins to break 
We march to meet the horde 
Invaders armed with spear and sword 
Ten thousand legions strong 
A loathsome blot upon the land 
I thirst to see their blood upon my hands 

Outnumbered ten to one 
The air is heavy, as the sun 
Begins to draw the sweat from every man 

Oh, a sudden change 
My breath, it catches in my throat 
I falter from the pain 
And filled with fear 
I turn to flee 

Oh, what have I done? 
I've left my men to certain death 
A coward's mark upon my head 
But wait, for in my path 
A shadow looms and speaks to me 

Turn and fight 
Harness your heathen might 
You will take revenge for the fallen ones 

An eerie light descends 
A sudden peace from the wind 
A new sensation overcoming me 

Now filled with lust for blood 
I turn and tear back 
to the site where courage faltered for me 

Oh, I can't believe 
The sight obscene 
The field of dead 
Stretching far as eye can see 

Oh, I've failed them 
I have forsaken my only calling 
Oh, retribution 
My only wish, but how? 
No map to guide my feet 
I'll guide you, I'll find your way 
The shadow spoke to me 

I am 
I am 
I am one 
One chosen by the gods 

[Heinrich solo] 

With nothing left to lose 
I step back to the fray 
their force asleep and none will ever see another day 
My courage has been found 
begin to cut them down 
Revenge, revenge is my name 

Death is their only destiny 
My blades are dancing in perfect unity 
releasing my rage for what seems like eternity 

What the gods have wrought in you today, let no man tear asunder 

I wish to return to ethereal state 
No pain or feeling 
Relenquish my body in the darkened night 
I slowly drift away 
Leaving my body I'm finally free 
No physical traits 
The perfect being 
Rush of color, divine new realm 
Come with me, Come with me 

I am one chosen by the gods
