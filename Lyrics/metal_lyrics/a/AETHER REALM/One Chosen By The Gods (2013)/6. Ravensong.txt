Oh I wish I could fly
With the ravens high above
The fog of the earth
For majestic flight
To soar through the skies
True calling of my rebirth
For I long to feel
The tears of the stars
The wind caressing my wings
Oh gods by my sacrifice
Grant me the freedom it brings
Watch the earth below me unfold
As I complete the primordial rites
My greatest desire
In legend foretold
The master of the skies
For I long to feel
The tears of the stars
The wind caressing my wings
Oh gods by my sacrifice
Grant me the freedom it brings
This life is nothing but agony
I long for the great infinity
So I
So I
I look to the skies
Wishing
Wishing
For this change
There is
Nothing
For me in this life
I give
Myself
Give my soul to the gods
My vision obscured by a blinding light
The very air is electrified
My ritual, do I dare to think
That the gods have heard my plea?
What is this I feel?
Twisting, transforming
I take to the skies
Desire fulfilled
A new paradise
And I fly
My new life
Midnight black is my shroud
My former shell disavowed
New muscles twisted and intertwined
The power begins to intensify
I bid farewell to the earth, for now
I sing the Ravensong
