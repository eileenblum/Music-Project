In the dawn at the sun's first rays 
We initiate the end of days 
Perilous quest for paradise 
Far away from this land of snow and ice 
No pity for those lying dead 
Our vicious path leaves the ground stained red 
The aether realm for which we travel the earth 
In the hopes of a new birth 

A lair in the sky for which we seek 
From the depths of the earth to the highest peak 
Forcing the masses to bow to our lord 
we are born into battle, we die by the sword 
Laying waste to the land and all who defend 
Our swords cutting down their finest men 
For the heathen wars have no true weight 
As you stand before ethereal gates 

No pity for those lying dead 
Our vicious path leaves the ground stained red 
The aether realm for which we travel the earth 
In the hopes of a new birth 

A lair in the sky for which we seek 
From the depths of the earth to the highest peak 
Forcing the masses to bow to our lord 
we are born into battle, we die by the sword 
Laying waste to the land and all who defend 
Our swords cutting down their finest men 
For the heathen wars have no true weight 
As you stand before ethereal gates 

To the aether realm we return at last 
To reclaim our throne of the ages past 
Ruling the land from a higher base 
We have rightfully taken our true place 

A lair in the sky for which we seek 
From the depths of the earth to the highest peak 
Forcing the masses to bow to our lord 
we are born into battle, we die by the sword 
Laying waste to the land and all who defend 
Our swords cutting down their finest men 
For the heathen wars have no true weight 
As you stand before ethereal gates
