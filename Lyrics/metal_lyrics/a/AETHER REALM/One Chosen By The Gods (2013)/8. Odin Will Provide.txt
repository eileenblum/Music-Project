Riding hard across the fields
Across the barren wastes
The rider pursues his enemy
Asks gods for gift of haste
A wild look found in his eye
Shows the thrill of the hunt
Ride
For a fire burns
Inside
Before the flame dies
No fear for your journey
Let Odin be your guide
Fight
With the strength of Einherjar
Ignite
Your furyâs side
And think not of your survival
For Odin will provide
Through the amber trees
Leaves crushed by boot and hoof
Over snow-capped mountains
Through swamp and desert bare

[Solo: Arnold]

Exhausted, he turns to fight
The rider, not a second thought
Steps down upon the sand
Axe silhouetted against the sky
They brace for the hit
Both masters of their craft
Nothing but focus shows in either face
For the first to falter
Is the first to meet deathâs cold embrace
As the sweat begins to shine
Moon rises toward the sky
The stars as the only witnesses
Watch from the blackness
Fear not the blade of knife
With Odin as your guide
A false step yields the perfect time to strike
And Odin will provide

[Solo: Dougherty]

Ride
For a fire burns
Inside
Before the flame dies
No fear for your journey
Odin will provide
Ride
For a fire burns
Inside
Before the flame dies
No fear for your journey
Let Odin be your guide
Fight
With the strength of Einherjar
Ignite
Your furyâs side
And think not of your survival
For Odin will provide
