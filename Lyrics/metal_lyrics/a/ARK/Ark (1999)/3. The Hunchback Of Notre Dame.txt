STARING DOWN AT THE MARKED PLACE
FROM HIGH UP ABOVE
I RING THE BELLS IN MY TOWER CELLS
I DREAM OF SOMETHING PEACEFUL AND WORM
A FREAK OF NATURE I WAS BORN
LONLY WIND TELL HOW TO BEGIN

I'M HIGHER WHEN I'M DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT
I AM BOUND TO WALK THE NIGHT
DIVING TO A WISHING WELL
WHERE HOPES AND DREAMS CAN BREAK THE SPELL
A PLACE WHERE I CAN FLY TOWARDS THE SUN... FREE
FREE ME

IN THE NAME OF LOVE
BREAK DOWN THESE WALLS
I CAN TAKE NO MORE
MADE OF FLUSH AND BLOOD... OH DEAR GOD
GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE

THERE'S DARKNESS IN MY SOUL
I WANNA LEARN TO LIVE
LIVE TO LEARN

LOOKING OUT OVER PARIS
SO MANY THINGS I COULD CHERISH
SMELL THE GREEN BE A PART OF THE SCENE
CHILDREN PLAY THEIR LAUGHING
AND I'M JUST ANOTHER FAIRYTALE
DREAMS TO ASHES TO DUST

I'M HIGHER WHEN I'M DANCING IN THE MOONLIGHT
I AM BOUND TO WALK THE NIGHT
DIVING TO A WISHING WELL
WHERE HOPES AND DREAMS CAN BREAK THE SPELL
A PLACE WHERE I CAN FLY TOWARDS THE SUN... FREE
FREE ME

IN THE NAME OF LOVE
BREAK DOWN THESE WALLS
I CAN TAKE NO MORE
MADE OF FLUSH AND BLOOD... OH DEAR GOD
GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE

I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
I'M TRYING HARD NOT TO LOOSE CONTROL

WELCOME TO NOTRE DAME MY FRIENDS
WHERE THE PIGEONS FLY AGAIN
I'M A GHOST IN THIS TOWN
A KING WITHOUT A CROWN
I'M A FIRESTORM
CRAZY... MAY BE
GET READY TO FACE THE DAWN

OH YOU'RE THE BEAUTY AND I AM THE BEAST
IN THIS CATHEDRAL I HOLD THE FEAST
AND I'M IN COMMAND
THIS IS MY LAND
I'M CRAZY MAY BE
AND IT'S ALL THAT I KNOW

THERE'S DARKNESS IN MY SOUL
AND I'M TRYING HARD NOT TO LOOSE CONTROL
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR SO LONG
