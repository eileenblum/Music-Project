VIKING
I'M A VIKING
AND MY NAME IS VICTORY
I'M A SNOW MAN IN A SNOW LAND
AND I SAIL THE SEVEN SEAS

I KNOW...
YOU KNOW...
WE KNOW...
WE'VE BEEN MARCHING ON FOR SO LONG
RISING... FIGHTING
MAKING LOVE AND WAR

GO FOR POWER GO FOR FREEDOM
WHO HOLDS THE KEY WHO CAN OPEN THE DOOR
GO FOR JOURNEY GO FOR REASON
LOOK FOR THE ANSWER
WILL WE EVER KNOW?

LIKE THE SINGERS AT WORLDS DAWN
WE KEEP SINGING THAT SAME OLD SONG
FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST
THERE'S A SION THERE'S A QUEST... YEAH
FOR THE SINGERS AT THE WORLD'S END

THIS IS MINE... THIS IS YOURS... THIS IS THEIRS
THIS IS OURS... THIS IS COLD... THIS IS WARM
THIS IS LIFE... AND LIFE IS FOR ALL

WARHEAD
I'M A WARHEAD
AND I COULD BE THE END OF THE WORLD

LIKE THE SINGERS AT WORLDS DAWN
WE KEEP SINGING THAT SONG
FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST
THERE'S A SION THERE'S A QUEST... YEAH
FOR THE SINGERS AT THE WORLD'S END
FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SEA
WE'LL BE DANCING YOU AND ME
GO FOR POWER GO FOR REASON GO FOR FREEDOM
LOOK FOR THE ANSWER
WILL WE EVER KNOW
LIKE THE SINGERS AT WORLDS DAWN
