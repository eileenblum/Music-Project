NOW I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING BABY
YOU SHURE KNOW HOW TO KEEP A GOOD MAN DOWN
I GAVE YOU MY HEART AND SOUL
KEPT YOU WARM WHEN THE NIGHTS WERE COLD
YOU SAY YOU NEED SOME TIME TO THINK IT OVER
BUT I CAN'T WAIT NO MORE
DOWN THAT LONG WINDING ROAD I'LL GO
RUNNING FAST AIN'T LOOKING BACK

FOLLOW A CLEAR BLUE SKY
ON ALL THE DREAMS I'M DEPENDING
UNTIL THE DAY THAT I DIE
I'LL BE WAITING FOR SUNRISE

WHERE THE WINDS BLOW
THAT'S WHERE I GO
DOWN THE RIVER TO THE SEA
LIKE A BLIND MAN
IN A STRANGE LAND
WILL I EVER SEE THE DAY

WILL I EVER SEE THE DAY... WOMAN

I KEEP ON PUSHING HARDER
EVERYDAY THE SONG
REMAINS THE SAME

AND I NEVER SEEM TO LEARN
BET MY HEART ON LOVE
NOW I GOT MEMORIES TO BURN
EVERYWHERE I GO THERE IS A TROUBLE
ALWAYS DOUBLE... BABY
SPEND MY TIME DRINKING TOO MUCH WINE

I CAN'T TAKE IT NO MORE

FOLLOW A CLEAR BLUE SKY
ON ALL THE DREAMS YOU'RE DEPENDING
UNTIL THE DAY THAT I DIE
I'LL BE WAITING FOR SUNRISE

WHERE THE WINDS BLOW
THAT'S WHERE I GO
DOWN THE RIVER TO THE SEA
LIKE A BLIND MAN
IN A STRANGE LAND
WILL I EVER SEE THE DAY

AND I'M ON THE RUN...

WHERE THE WINDS BLOW...
WHERE THE WINDS BLOW
THAT'S WHERE I GO
WILL I EVER SEE THE DAY
WILL I EVER SEE THE DAY

WILL I EVER SEE THE DAY

I KEEP ON PUSHING HARDER BABY

WHERE THE WINDS BLOW
THAT'S WHERE I GO
DOWN THE RIVER TO THE SEA
LIKE A BLIND MAN
IN A STRANGE LAND
WILL I EVER SEE THE DAY
WHERE THE WINDS BLOW
THAT'S WHERE I GO
DOWN THE RIVER TO THE SEA
LIKE A BLIND MAN
IN A FOREIGN LAND
WILL I EVER SEE THE DAY

WILL I EVER SEE THE DAY... OH LORD... WOMAN
