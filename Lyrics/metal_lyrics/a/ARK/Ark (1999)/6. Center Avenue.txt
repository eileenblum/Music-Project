IN THE CITY OF EIGTH MILLION PEOPLE
LONELINESS JUST COULDN'T BE SHARED
THERE I WAS AGAIN IN THE HOUSE OF LOST REGRETS
WITH BURNED OUT HYPOCRATES
THE INCRAWD SAID
THEY'D BE HIP TILL THEY WERE DEAD
THEY'RE WORE THAT COOLNESS OF THEIRS WITH PRIDE
AND DIGNITY
YEAH YEAH...

IF YOU WANNA HEAR SOME THRUTH
I'LL SIT DOWN AND TALK TO YOU
DOWN ON CENTER AVENUE
I'LL SHOW YOU THAT THE BLUES
JUST AIN'T SOMETHING YOU LOOSE
DOWN ON CENTER AVENUE

SHARP DRESSED OPINIONATED PEOPLE
DEDICATED FOLLOWERS OF FASHION
WITH THEIR POINTED HEADS
BUYING ALL THE REASONS THEY NEEDED
TO LIVE IN THEIR STORYBOOK DOWNTOWN DEAD ENDS
WITH FOUNDIMENTAL LIBERTIES
THAT WEAR IN MAJORITY OF ONE
THEY WERE SWIMMING DOWN THE DRAIN OF FREEDOM
IF YOU ASK ME I JUST BARELY GIVE THEM A 10% STATUS
IN THE COOL PARADE BUT NO ONE EVER ASKED ME
SO I WOKE UP EVERY MORNIG TOOK A GOOD LOOK AROUND
AND WHEN I THOUGHT THINKS MIGHT BE OKAY
I REALIZAD THIS SMALL TOWN CROWD
WITH LITTLE DREAMS WERE BUYING ALL THE TIME THEY NEEDED
TO FIND REASONS TO BE YEAH...
SO LISTEN KNOW LOOK ME UP SOMETIMES
AND BRING ALONG SOME WINE

IF YOU WANNA HEAR SOME THRUTH
I'LL SIT DOWN AND TALK TO YOU
DOWN ON CENTER AVENUE

JUST AIN'T SOMETHING YOU LOOSE
DOWN ON CENTER AVENUE

AND THERE WAS NOTHING THAT COULD BE DONE
