LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS MY FRIEND
YOU'VE BEEN RUNNING SINCE THE AGE OF TEN... YEAH
LOOKING FOR THE WINNER
STEALING LIKE A SINNER
LITTLE GIRL YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN

OH... IT'S JUST ONE MORE DAY YOU KEEP TRYING HARD
IN EVERY WAY
BETTER WATCH OUT NOW LADY OR YOU WON'T MAKE
IT TO THE CROSSROADS

REACH OUT FOR SOMETHING
DON'T LET YOUR SPIRIT FADE IT'S A BIG BLACK SKY
AND YOU'RE TOO HIGH
YOU NEED A WARNING
THE BELLS ARE RINGING NOW

OUT THERE LIVING ON THE RUN FOR A WHILE
IN THE BACK OF YOUR MIND LIVES THE SCENE
OF THE CRIME
LIVING A LIE WE BOTH KNOW YOU AND I
WE GOTTA KEEP OUR HEADS ABOVE THE WATER

IT'S JUST ONE MORE DAY
WE KEEP TRYING HARD IN EVERY WAY
ON THE HIGHWIRE
WE WON'T MAKE IT TO THE CROSSROADS

REACHING FOR SOMETHING
DON'T LET THE SPIRIT FADE
IT'S A BIG BLACK SKY
AND WE'RE TOO HIGH
THIS IS A WARNING

THE BELLS ARE RINGING NOW

BURNING DOWN... DOWN... DOWN... DOWN

GOING DOWN

GOING DOWN... DOWN... DOWN... DOWN... DOWN

AND WE CAN'T GET MUCH HIGHER... OH LORD

HERE WE GO AGAIN MY FRIENDS

IT'S JUST ONE MORE DAY
AND WE'VE BEEN RUNNING SINCE THE AGE OF MEN
LOOKING FOR THE WINNER
STEALING LIKE A SINNER

OH... REACHING FOR SOMETHING NEW
DON'T LET YOUR SPIRIT FADE
IT'S A BIG BLACK SKY
AND YOU'RE TOO HIGH
THIS IS A WARNING
THE BELLS ARE RINGING NOW

REACHING FOR SOMETHING
DON'T LET THE SPIRIT FADE

BURNING DOWN TO THE GROUND
THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD
BURNING DOWN TO THE GROUND
