IT WAS A NIGHT IN JULY
STORMY WEATHER FOR YOU AND I
CAUGHT IN THE RAIN
AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO BLAME
WE WENT SEPARATE WAYS
BUT I CAN STILL SEE YOUR FACE
IN EVERY CROWD
AND BABY IT DRIVES ME WILD

NEVER SAW THE SUNSHINE
TILL YOU TURNED YOUR LOVELIGHT ON
I NEVER SAW THE MOON SO FULL BEFORE
TILL THAT NIGHT YOU HELD ME THIGHT

ACROSS THE BALLROOM FLOOR
I COULD SEE YOU DANCING SLOW... BABY
YOU ANGEL YOU
NOW YOU'RE THE PERFECT LOVER... WIFE AND MOTHER
AND I STILL KNOW YOUR NAME
YES I KNOW YOUR GAME
YES I KNOW YOUR WAYS... WOMAN

MOTHER OF LOVE
I'M UNDER YOUR SPELL
DRIVING TOO FAST INTO THE RAIN
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
TO RESCUE ME
I'VE BEEN WAITING MY WHOLE LIFE
GUESS I'LL ALWAYS BE A RESTLESS HEART... BABY

STAIRING OUT OF THE WINDOW
PRECIOUS TIME WHERE DID YOU GO... WHERE DIDI YOU GO
ALL THE YEARS PASSING BY
AND I CAN STILL HEAR YOUR SIGH... BABY

I NEVER EVER SAW THE SUNSHINE
TILL YOU TURNED YOUR LOVELIGHT ON
I NEVER SAW THE MOON SO FULL BEFORE
TILL THAT NIGHT YOU HELD ME THIGHT

YES A NIGHT IN JULY
STORMY WEATHER FOR YOU AND I
CAUGHT IN THE RAIN
AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO BLAME
WE WENT SEPARATE WAYS
BUT I CAN STILL SEE YOUR FACE
IN EVERY CROWD
AND BABY IT DRIVES ME WILD

MOTHER OF LOVE
I'M UNDER YOUR SPELL
DRIVING TOO FAST INTO THE RAIN
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
TO RESCUE ME
I'VE BEEN WAITING MY WHOLE LIFE
GUESS I'LL ALWAYS BE A RESTLESS HEART

PEOPLE TALK BUT THEY JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ALONE
THERE'S A MAN OUT THERE
AIN'T GOT NO HOME
HOPING JESUS WILL FIND HIM
WHEREVER HE GOES
THE DARK CLOUDS NO THEY WON'T DISAPPEAR
THE LIGHT IS GONE
NOW IT'S DARK EVERYWHERE BABY...

... PEOPLE TELL HIM KEEP THE FAITH
YOUR HEART WILL TELL YOU
THEY GOT NO REASON TO TELL HIM A LIE
THEY DON'T CARE IF HE LIVES OR IF HE DIES
FIRE BURNING IN ME
GUESS WE'RE TOO BLIND TO SEE

MOTHER OF LOVE
I'M UNDER YOUR SPELL
DRIVING TOO FAST INTO THE RAIN
LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
TO RESCUE ME
I'VE BEEN WAITING MY WHOLE LIFE
GUESS I'LL ALWAYS BE A RESTLESS HEART
