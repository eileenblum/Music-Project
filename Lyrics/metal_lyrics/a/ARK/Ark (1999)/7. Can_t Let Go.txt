GIPSY QUEEN WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING I HAVE EVER SEEN
IT'S DRIVING ME OUT OF MY MIND
THE THOUGHT OF YOU MAKES ME GO BLIND
WE MET AND I CAN'T FORGET
I'M OUT OF CONTROL BUT I WON'T LET IT SHOW
LIGTH AS A FEATHER
WANNA FLY FOREVER

I HAVE SEEN SO MANY FACES
THERE HAS BEEN SO MANY PLACES
SO MANY CHASES

A FORTUNETELLER TOLD ME ONCE
IT'S WHAT'S INSIDE THAT COUNTS
AND NOT THE THINGS I THOUGHT I NEEDED... ANGEL
I CALL YOU ON THE PHONE FROM SOMEWHERE
WISH THAT I COULD BE THERE ALWAYS IN MY HEART AND SOUL
YOU'RE THE ONE I'M DREAMING OF

I CAN'T LET GO
YOU'RE SO FAR AWAY FROM ME
I MUST FULFILL MY DESTINY
CAN'T LET GO
YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO FACE THE MUSIC
AND BABY IT'S JUST SOMETHING I MUST DO... YEAH
SOMETHING I GOTTA DO... LORD
ROLL THE DICE PAY THE PRIZE
BABY YOU KNOW I JUST CAN'T LET GO
OVER AND OVER
THE SCENES ARE REPLAYED
THESE MEMORIES JUST WON'T FADE
DIAMONDS AND PEARLS COULDN'T BUY YOU GIRL
YOU'RE A JOYRIDE NOT OF THIS WORLD
YOU MAKE A SPECIAL MAGIC
YOU HAVE IT ALL
SOMEHOW WE'LL FIND A WAY
AND I PRAY EVERY DAY

A FORTUNETELLER TOLD ME ONCE
IT'S WHAT'S INSIDE THAT COUNTS
AND NOT THE THINGS I THOUGHT I NEEDED... ANGEL
I CALL YOU ON THE PHONE FROM SOMEWHERE
WISH THAT I COULD BE THERE ALWAYS IN MY HEART AND SOUL
YOU'RE THE ONE I'M DREAMING OF
I CAN'T LET GO
YOU'RE SO FAR AWAY FROM ME
I MUST FULFILL MY DESTINY
CAN'T LET GO
YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO FACE THE MUSIC
AND BABY IT'S JUST SOMETHING I MUST DO... YEAH
SOMETHING I GOTTA DO... LORD
ROLL THE DICE PAY THE PRIZE
BABY YOU KNOW I JUST CAN'T LET GO

LIGTH AS A FEATHER WANNA FLY FOREVER
YOU'RE SO FARAWAY FROM ME... IT'S MY DESTINY.
