WHY DON'T WE HEAR
WHY DON'T WE SEE
IS THERE NO FUTURE FOR YOU AND ME
WHY DO WE HIDE BEHIND A MASQUE
SUDDENLY BREATHLESS
ALL IS BLACK AND BLINDING ME
TRUTH IS A LIE AND LIES ARE TRUE
WHAT IS WEAK IS SOMETIMES STRONG

SENDING A MESSAGE TO ALL
SENDING A MESSAGE TO GOD
WE MUST BRING LIGHT TO THE DARKNESS
IN TIME WE WILL RISE ABOVE

HEAL THE WATERS
EARTH IS THE LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER
AND GIVE US MAGIC
RELEASE OUR DEVOTED SOULS

LOOK BEHIND YOU
YOU'VE SEEN THE KINGDOMS FALL
SUBLIMINAL WARS MAKE US CRY FOR SUNDOWN
HOLY MAN WASH THE BLOOD FROM YOUR HAND
GODLESS BEHAVIOR THROUGHOUT THE LAND
I FEAR YOU - YOU FEAR ME
BUILDING OUR BRIDGES ETERNALY
GATES OF HELL CAST THEIR SPELL
YOUR MARK AND YOUR COLORS ARE BRANDED ON YOU

SENDING A MESSAGE TO ALL
SENDING A MESSAGE TO GOD
WE MUST BRING LIGHT TO THE DARKNESS
IN TIME WE WILL RISE ABOVE

HEAL THE WATERS
EARTH IS THE LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER
AND GIVE US MAGIC
RELEASE OUR DEVOTED SOULS

ANGEL WINGS BURNED TO ASHES
SCATTERED THROUGH THE SKY
THE SMELL OF CINDER AND MELTING STEEL
THIS WOUND WILL NEVER HEAL

SENDING A MESSAGE - A MESSAGE TO ALL
SENDING A MESSAGE TO GOD

HEAL THE WATERS
EARTH IS THE LAMB TO THE SLAUGHTER
AND GIVE US MAGIC
RELEASE OUR SOULS.
