RAIN ON MY DOORSTEP
I GOT YOU ON THE LINE
THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING
THAT MONEY CAN'T BUY
WEIGHT ON MY SHOULDER
WHY WOULD YOU LEAVE
I THOUGHT WE WERE SPECIAL
YOU GOT ME ON MY KNEES

DON'T BRING IT DOWN - IT DOWN
DON'T SAY IT'S OVER NOW
I CAN'T ENDURE THE PAIN
DON'T BRING IT DOWN
BABY LET IT BE

WORDS BEING SPOKEN
TRYING HARD TO UNDERSTAND
LIFE HAS NO MEANING
IF I CAN'T BE YOUR MAN
YOU SAY LOVE IS OVER
AND THAT WE GREW APART
THE VOICE OF ANOTHER
ECHOES IN YOUR HEART

DON'T BRING IT DOWN - IT DOWN
DON'T SAY IT'S OVER NOW
IF YOU'RE GONNA LET IT RAIN
DON'T BRING IT DOWN
DON'T BRING IT DOWN ON ME
BABY LET IT BE

YOU KNOW I CAN'T ENDURE THE PAIN

RAIN ON MY DOOR
YOU'RE NOT HERE ANYMORE
AND I NEED AN ANSWER OR A REASON
CUTS LIKE A KNIFE
I AM STABBED IN THE SIDE
AND I BLEED
DON'T LEAVE ME BURNING IN THE FIRE

.YOUR BLOOD RUNS SO COLD.

DON'T BRING IT DOWN - IT DOWN
DON'T SAY IT'S OVER NOW
IF YOU'RE GONNA LET IT RAIN
DON'T BRING IT DOWN
DON'T BRING IT DOWN ON ME
BABY LET IT BE
IF YOU GONNA LET IT RAIN
LORD DON'T BRING IT DOWN
DON'T BRING IT DOWN
'CAUSE I CAN'T ENDURE THE PAIN
DON'T BRING - DON'T BRING IT DOWN
BABY LET IT BE
