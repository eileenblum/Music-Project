STARS ARE RESURRECTED
SHIFTING OVER DESERT SKIES
SAND SIFTING FROM THE HANDS OF WAR
SOLDIER IS YOUR CONSCIENCE CLEAN
CAN YOU FEEL THERE'S SOMETHING DEEP INSIDE
LAY YOUR WEAPONS DOWN
LET THE CHILDREN PLAY HERE
A CRY FROM THE PEOPLE
BUT THERE'S NO ONE THERE TO HEAR
AND THE WORLD IS WATCHING.SILENTLY

WE'RE HALFWAY THERE WE SEE IT COMING
SO IN DESPAIR WE MUST BE STRONG

THERE'S A LIGHT ON A SHADOWED SKY
HOPES AND DREAMS FOR YOU AND I

IT'S TIME TO AWAKEN - IT'S WAKING HOUR
A NEW DAY IS BREAKING - THE FUTURE'S NOW
IT'S HERE AND THEN IT'S GONE

SING A SONG FOR THE BROKEN ONES
AND OUR FAITH WILL REAPPEAR
'CAUSE THERE'S POWER IN THE MELODY
POWER ENOUGH FOR CHANGES
IF GOD IS HERE
HIS TEARS ARE FALLING NOW
POURING FROM THE CEILING OF THE SKY

WE'RE HALFWAY THERE WE SEE IT COMING
SO IN DESPAIR WE MUST BE STRONG
IT'S TIME TO AWAKEN - IT'S WAKING HOUR
A NEW DAY IS BREAKING - THE FUTURE'S NOW
IT'S HERE AND THEN IT'S GONE

WAKE UP
