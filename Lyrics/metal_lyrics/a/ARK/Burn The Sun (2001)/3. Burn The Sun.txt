ENIGMAS OF MIND
SPACE AND TIME
THE UNEXPLAINED PROTECTED FILES
PORTRAITS FROM THE OTHER SIDE
FLYING SORCER SHOOTING HIGH

TOURS THROUGH THE SOLAR SYSTEM
A PRODUCT OF IMAGINATION
CLOSER THAN YOU REALIZE

FLAMES GETTING HIGHER
PLAYING WITH FIRE
HIGHER AND WE CAN'T RUN
THERE'S TOO MANY POWER GAMES

PARANORMAL STARBIRTH CHILD
FAST AS LIGHTNING BEAMS THE SKY
A MILLION MILES PASSING BY

A RIDE THROUGH THE SOLAR SYSTEM
A PRODUCT OF IMAGINATION
CLOSER THAN YOU REALIZE
A SCIENCE FICTION REALITY

TRYING TO BURN THE SUN
FLAMES GETTING HIGHER
PLAYING WITH FIRE
HIGHER AND WE CAN'T RUN
THERE'S TOO MANY POWER GAMES
