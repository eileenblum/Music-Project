HIGH ON YOU
I FEEL LOVE AGAIN
THERE'S NO PRETENDING HERE
IT'S LONG AGO SINCE I'VE HAD A REASON
SO STRONG AND TRUE
IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU GIRL

I USED TO BE A BIRD OF PREY
CRYING TO BE HEARD
A HEAVY HEART
CARRYING THE WEIGHT OF SORROW

TALKING ABOUT IT
YOU WERE THERE SAVING ME FROM DARKNESS
LIFE HAS NEVER BEEN - EVER SEEMED SO BRIGHT
OOH ON THE DAY YOU CAME TO ME
THE WAY THAT YOU PARALYZE - NO DISGUISE
I REALIZE THE POWER
LOST IN A SEA OF LOVE
DON'T WAKE ME IF I'M DREAMING

I USED TO BE A BIRD OF PREY
CRYING TO BE HEARD
A HEAVY HEART
CARRYING THE WEIGHT OF SORROW

SOLITUDE AND BROKEN HEARTS
LIVING ALL AROUND US
CENTURIES OF ASKING "WHY THE WIND BLOWS HERE"
SEARCH A SOLUTION TO SAVE US FROM PAIN
FROM FALLING TO PIECES
I SURVIVED A WAR WITH DEMONS
AND I'VE ERASED THE PAST
IT'S A NEW BEGINNING.WAKING UP
WAKING FROM MY SLEEP
I FEEL ALIVE.AND WE'RE GONNA DANCE

YOU WOKE ME FROM MY SLEEP
I FEEL ALIVE BABY
AND WE'RE GONNA DANCE TONIGHT.IT'S ALRIGHT

I USED TO BE A BIRD OF PREY
CRYING TO BE HEARD
A HEAVY HEART
CARRYING THE WEIGHT OF SORROW
AND THE PIPER PLAYS THE CALL
COME ON.COME MARCHING ON
