[Japanese bonus track]

SILENT IS THE RAIN
WASHING PAIN AWAY
FLOWERS TURNING GREY
NO MORE TEARS TO CRY
NOTHING MORE TO HIDE
NO MORE WAYSTING TIME

GOODBYE TO YOU
GOODBYE EVERYONE
GOODBYE EVERYTHING
GOODBYE BRAVE NEW WORLD
CARRY THE MORNING
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.SOMEWHERE

NO MORE STRUCK BY WORDS
OR THE SOUND OF BIRDS FLYING
NO REGRETS OR ANGER
NO MORE SECRET SMILES
NOTHING MORE TO BRING
NO MORE SONGS TO SING
I'LL MEET YOU THERE.SOMEWHERE

GOODBYE TO YOU
GOODBYE EVERYONE
GOODBYE EVERYTHING
GOODBYE BRAVE NEW WORLD
YOU MUST CARRY THE MORNING
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.SOMEWHERE
