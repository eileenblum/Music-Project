WALKED THROUGH THE CROWD
MY HEAD HUNG LOW
THEIR SENDING AN INNOCENT SOUL
AS THE ANGELS CIRCLE DRAGON HILL
AND SATAN SETS HIS STAGE

IT'S A SACRIFICE FOR THE PEOPLE
AN ACT OF EVIL

NO ONE TO HEAR YOU CRY
ONLY THERE TO WATCH YOU DIE
SOON YOU'LL BE BREATHLESS
DEALT IS THE CARD OF THE HANGMAN

I STARED INTO THE CRYSTAL FULL OF PROPHECIES
HUMAN CHARACTERS IN THE BOOK OF CHANGE
AS THE ANGELS CIRCLE DRAGON HILL
AND SATAN SETS HIS STAGE

A SACRIFICE FOR THE PEOPLE
AN ACT OF EVIL
PLEADING TO THE STARS
DELIVER ME FROM MADNESS

NO ONE TO HEAR YOU CRY
ONLY THERE TO WATCH YOU DIE
SOON YOU'LL BE BREATHLESS
DEALT IS THE CARD OF THE HANGMAN

WE ARE MOVING TOWARDS TIME UNTOLD
IN FOR INFINITY
FOREVER ENDLESSLY
BUILDING THE TOWER OF KNOWLEDGE AND POWER

NO ONE TO HEAR US CRY
THERE'S NO TIME FOR YOU AND I
SOON WE'LL BE BREATHLESS
DEALT IS THE CARD FOR THE HANGMAN
NO ONE TO HEAR YOU CRY
ONLY THERE TO WATCH YOU DIE
SOON YOU'LL BE BREATHLESS
DEALT IS THE CARD OF THE HANGMAN
SO MUCH FOR THE FUTURE
FLOODED WITH SORROW
WILL WE SEE TOMORROW
NO ONE WILL HEAR YOU CRY
ONLY THERE TO WATCH YOU DIE
SOON YOU'LL BE BREATHLESS
DEALT IS THE CARD OF THE HANGMAN

I SAW HER FACE IN A MAGAZINE
SHE WAS THERE SMILING BACK AT ME
IT WAS A SPARK TO THE FIRE AND I FLEW HIGHER
HER HAIR AS BLACK AS COAL
HER EYES WE'RE SLIGHTLY BLUE
AM I IMAGINING THE BEAUTY REFLECTING

WILL SHE EVER KNOW MY NAME
I'M DREAMING
THAT SOMEDAY SHE'LL BE MINE

IT'S LOVE THAT FEEDS THE FIRE
IN FOR DESIRE I DIVE ENDLESSLY
I CAN'T STOP BELIEVING
LOVE WILL BE THERE

I KNOW YOU'RE OUT THERE SOMEWHERE
MY DREAMS ARE ALL ABOUT YOU
BABY WE COULD WALK THROUGH FIRE
YOUR POWER I DESIRE
LOVING FROM A DISTANCE
AIN'T GOT NO RESISTANCE
BEHIND YOUR MADE UP FACE
YOUR SECRETS EMBRACE

WILL SHE EVER KNOW MY NAME
I'M DREAMING
SOMEDAY SHE'LL BE MINE

IT'S LOVE THAT FEEDS THE FIRE
IN FOR DESIRE I DIVE ENDLESSLY
AND I CAN'T STOP BELIEVING
LOVE WILL BE THERE
LOVE WILL FEED THE FIRE
IN FOR DESIRE I DIVE ENDLESSLY
I CAN'T STOP BELIEVING
LOVE WILL BE THERE.BE THERE SOME DAY
