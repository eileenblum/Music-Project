HERE I STAND
A HEARTBROKEN MAN
I WAS A BAD SEED IN YOUR FUTURE PLAN
WHEN IT RAINS IT POURS
THAT'S WHEN YOU HIDE AND CLOSE THE DOOR
I'LL NEVER BE THE ONE YOU WANTED

I SENT YOU A LETTER
I THOUGHT IT'D BE BETTER THAN CALLING YOU

I'M MISSING YOU
I'M THE MAN YOU NEVER KNEW
ALWAYS BLUE.OVER YOU
AND I CAN'T HELP IT
I CAN NOT FAKE IT
FOR I STILL LOVE YOU

I DON'T KNOW YOU.ANYMORE
BEHIND THE SHELL LIES SOMETHING WOUNDED
HAVE YOU FOUND YOUR SUPERMAN
AND DOES HE FIT YOUR MASTER PLAN
I FEEL IT HARD TO SEARCH FOR SOMETHING NEW

I SENT YOU A LETTER
I THOUGHT IT BE BETTER THAN CALLING YOU

I'M MISSING YOU
I'M THE MAN YOU NEVER KNEW
ALWAYS BLUE.OVER YOU
AND I CAN'T HELP IT
I CAN NOT FAKE IT
FOR I STILL LOVE YOU

I CAN SEE THE STARTS ABOVE
THEY WATCH US LIVE
THEY SHINE UPON OUR FRAGILE LIVES.AND CRY
CAN I ASK YOU WHY WE TURN OUR HEADS THE OTHER WAY
AND LOOK FOR SOMETHING WE WILL NEVER FIND
IMAGINARY DAY.WHEN PAIN IS WASHED AWAY
WAITING FOR FREEDOM
GIVE US REASON TO LIVE
MISSING YOU

A HOTEL WHERE NOBODY STAYS
A PIANO THAT NOBODY PLAYS
IS WHAT MY HEART FEELS LIKE
EMPTY ROOM COLD DARK STAIRWAY
YOU LEFT ME BROKEN HEARTED
ALL ALONE ON THE ROAD TO SOMEWHERE

I'M MISSING YOU
I'M THE MAN YOU NEVER KNEW
ALWAYS BLUE.OVER YOU
AND I CAN'T HELP IT
I CAN NOT FAKE IT
FOR I STILL LOVE YOU
