After the fall from earth we went away
We built our own world is that a reason to stay
There is so much to explore
There are many planets in space
Somewhere an unknown war
Let us return or is it too late
Is it too late
We packed our bags and we locked the doors
We found the right tracks we'd travelled there before
It's 2086
A hundred years after the war
The fall from earth
Is it wise what we do
Has the enemy left our world
Left our world

[Chorus:]
Fast with overdrive our return to earth
Aliens are outta sight but they have learned
A hundred years after the war the seas are blue again
The holocaust no more new life has begun
And there is so much to explore
And there are many other ways
Oh death tears and war
We're gonna love it it's not too late
It's not too late

[Chorus]
