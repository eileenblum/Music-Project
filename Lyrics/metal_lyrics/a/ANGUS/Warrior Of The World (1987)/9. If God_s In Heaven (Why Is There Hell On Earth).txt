If there's a God in Heaven tell me oh Lord
Why is there Hell on Earth
Why must we suffer and cry and many people will die
We have one life for what it's worth

[Bridge:]
Believe in yourself
Believing your love
Do what you do
When push comes to shove
Are we losing our way tell me oh Lord
Are we losing the human race
Are we counting our days living under a sword
Will we vanish without a trace

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
It's your own life
It's the only way
Seeing is believing
You are here to stay

[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
