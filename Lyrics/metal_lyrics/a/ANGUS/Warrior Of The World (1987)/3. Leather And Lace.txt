Her body it is trembling,
Excited by the pain
The feeling is so different -
It's driving her insane

Like a savage beast she cries
But feels no shame
Instead of loving he's got a
Mistress to tame

[Chorus:]
The leather beats -
Left an ugly trace
Like silver lace on her lovely
Face

The instruments of torture
Soaked with her sweat
The pain is beyond the limit -
His spirit is free but her body
Looks dead

Pain becomes my pleasure
When I hear you sigh
Your body is my treasure but I'll
Never let you die
The pain becomes my
Pleasure, through your tears
I hear you cry
Your body is my measure but
I'll never let you die

[Chorus (x2)]

The leather beats
Left an ugly trace
Like silver lace
