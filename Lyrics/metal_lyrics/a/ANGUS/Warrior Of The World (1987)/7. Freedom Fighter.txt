Now the time has come you gotta pick up your gun
And fight for your right for your freedom
No holding you back cause you're wild and you're young
Fight for your rights for a reason

[Chorus:]
When you feel down and out
Go out and shout
Show them what you've got
Walk tall and proud
Fight for yourself
Your love and your life
There's no need to cry

They'll give you promises they'll get you down
But standing alone has no reason
Just fight for yourself don't follow the crowd
United we're strong and it won't take so long

[Chorus]
[Chorus]

Life's just a dirty lie
