My life was empty
I was living day to day
Until I met you girl
I hadn't really found my way

It didn't take so long
You mend everything to me
But like the blind who leaves the blind
I couldn't know the fool was me

[Chorus:]
Love has showing me the way
It's like a million stars in your eyes
And now I'm begging you to stay
You know I just can't say goodbye

And now your leaving
It was a kind of thing to do
To call me on the phone
And said tomorrow you be gone

Loving you so easy
Why does it break my heart to go
You wanted to release me
Was it all part of your show

[Chorus:]

I'm a fool with love
And I'm begging you to stay
