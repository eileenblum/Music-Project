Sometimes I find myself in black despair
Suddenly it comes over me but from where

[Chorus:]
When it's dark and I cannot sleep
I become angry and so sad memories come to me
Is it the life I lead
I find myself in black despair is it a warning

Oh I better just take care
A deep sigh almost can't breath air
I go deeper down can I come out of it
And far into the night life is getting sick

[Chorus]

Used to be a bad boy but now I feel compunction
I used to love it all now there's this crushing depression
The black despair became so strong almost drowned in tears
But my life goes on grab the bottle live another year

[Chorus]
