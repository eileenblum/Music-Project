Money is alright by me cause nothing in life is for free
Make a fortune in a couple of years makes me feel good no reason for tears

[Chorus:]
Money I wanna swim in it
Spend too much live fast take too much make it last

Money you know I need it too
It makes me feel good to do what I gotta do
I can hear them say it makes you turn bad
But I've worked so hard and now it drives me mad

[Chorus]

I'm tough I'm gonna live it up
I've got a need so bad I just cannot stop
Money... satisfies

[1st Verse]
[Chorus (2x)]
