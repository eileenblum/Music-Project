The main event you know we're feeling good
We're gonna rock this town tonight
We're here to steal your soul with metal rock 'n roll
And you won't stop until the morning light

[Bridge:]
We're rockin' come and hear the call
No stoppin' you can take it all
We're burning all through the night
Burning down the house so come and take it all

And keep on rockin' down deep inside
You know the heat is gonna get you gonna take control
Cause it's a feeling that you cannot hide

[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Who are we
What do we want to be
Warriors
Fighting to be free [x2]

Feel this force
Join this cause
And rock unite
Yeah we'll rock all night

[Chorus]
[1st Verse]
[Bridge]

[Chorus:]
Who are we (who are we)
What do we want to be
Warriors (warriors of the world)
Fighting to be free [x2]

Feel this force
Join this cause (fight for freedom)
And rock unite
Yeah we'll rock all night
Warriors of the world...
