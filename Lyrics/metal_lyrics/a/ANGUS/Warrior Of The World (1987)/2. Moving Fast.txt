I've got a friend who's never clean
A sadder wreck you've never seen
He drinks all night in the Blacklight Bar
Tries to stay with the fight but his mind's too far
Don't stop moving fast
Cheating the light finishing last
Switching gear getting up speed
Run for a curve feeling the heat
Pull up the break look for the line
Turning the wheel feeling so fine

[Chorus:]
Maybe tomorrow maybe today
You know it so well it's all part of Hell

He's living too fast he's gonna die young
Not finishing last he's second to none
And like Jimmy Dean he's gonna live on
On his wild machine he'll melt for the sun

[Chorus]

Moving fast
Getting high
Moving fast
It's easy to die

[Chorus]
