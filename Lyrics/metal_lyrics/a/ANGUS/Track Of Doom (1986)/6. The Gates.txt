Run through the Heaven Gates
Everybody knows it is time
Run so you won't be late
It's all over our time

[Chorus:]
The Gates are open for you and for me
Please don't you worry war you'll never see

Hell is for bad
Heaven will make you feel glad
Let the rage begin
They've already let us in

[Chorus]
[Repeat 1st Verse]
[Chorus (2x)]

The Gates are open for you and for me
Let's go to Heaven then you will see

[Chorus]
