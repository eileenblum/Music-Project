Sweet woman can you give me some wine
Alcohol is nice and I love to feel fine
Sweet lady is there something to feel high
Sex is nice but it's sensation that I like
I touch the sky

The Moon and the Sun are not that high
I'm totally burning out
Oh I hope it will never stop
Lost control [4x]

Sweet woman will you bring me high
I'm in Heaven and the stars pass me by
Sweet fantasy it's like live and die
It's all over me and it's in my mind
I touch the sky

Oh can we go that high
I am looking through your eyes
Those hot looking eyes
Moonlight queen it makes my life worth
You'll be my queen you make my life too short
Moonlight queen give me your stuff
The apple of my eye you get my feelings high
Moonlight queen give me your stuff

[Repeat 1st Verse]
