The heavy weight warriors are ready for their attack
When dawn breaks through soldiers will be back

[Chorus:]
What can it be this night
It's the march of the undead army

The heavy weight warriors are ready for their attack
When dawn breaks through soldiers will be back
Out from the undead their bodies became awake
Their victims get slaughtered let there be no mistake

[Repeat Chorus (x2)]

The march of the undead is seen with fear
Monster man take over your death is near
The march of the undead is seen with fear
Monster man take over your death is near

The holy soldiers are creeping at night
Are out for blood but they can't stand the light
The Hounds of Hell crawl back into their holes
At sunrise the undead will steal your soul

[Repeat Chorus (x2)]
