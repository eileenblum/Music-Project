If Thor's hammer is high above the rest
All the Gods are shivering they know there'll be a test
The flying monsters with Gorgon as their leader
Are leading to destruction Eros is fighting either
A giant collision is like Damocles his sword
They're fussing and fighting just for fun when they get bored
When Giants collide the lightning is flashing
And wrathful Gods swords are clashing
A giant collision is like Damocles his sword
They're fussing and fighting just for fun when they get bored
If Thor's hammer is high above the rest
All the Gods are shivering they know there'll be a test
When giants collide the lightning is flashing
And wrathful Gods swords are clashing
