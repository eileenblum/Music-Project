Many long years ago
Love at first sight
So nice what she had to show
Blond hair hips so nice

[Chorus:]
Made love on through the night
Loved rough hold on tight
Years passed by long nights we shouted
Now it is it's finally out

Wake up in the night
Reaching out she's not there
My sweet why did we fight
Oh so angry she didn't beware

[Chorus II:]
Many long years we hold on tight
It's over now I began the feeling's right
Now he's rich and shouts out loud
I'm happy it's finally out

[Bridge:]
She slammed the door
Couldn't take anymore
He didn't care
Why didn't she beware

[Chorus II]
[Bridge]
