Always felt there was something going on
I never knew that the feeling was so strong
People are melting away
It's the cause of nuclear ray
Well cities are blowing away
Politicians not able to stay
They all go to their shelter
And the people on earth yes they meet Hell

[Chorus:]
Love is the meaning of life
Don't throw it away no no you won't survive
Learned man not able to stay
Don't throw it away no no you won't survive

[Chorus II:]
Love is the meaning of life
Don't throw it away no no you won't survive
H-bomb we died at last
Life was not meant for us no no no not for us
