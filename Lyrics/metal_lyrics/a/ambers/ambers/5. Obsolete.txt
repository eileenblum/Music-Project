I hold my breath
How did we end like this
Digging our grave
With every step you take

Shadows crawl upon this beauty
Shadows you cast upon yourself
The sanctuary of all beginnings will fade away
Dragged down by the hand you used to guard
Dragged in the abyss leaving you scared
Will you will you fade away with me
Am I obsolete
I am not obsolete
Have you forgotten what it means to breath
I am not obsolete yet we waste away
Have you forgotten what it means

Where will I find the strength to break this curse
Slipping into the void our beloved earth
I hold my breath colors start to fade
Look at the mess we have made
Will you will you fade away with me
Am I obsolete I am not obsolete
Have you forgotten what it means to breath
Yet we are wasting away
Shadows crawl upon this beauty
Shadows you cast upon yourself
The sanctuary of all beginnings will never serve you again
