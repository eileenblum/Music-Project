A species drenched in malevolence
You can't be saved by the likes of men
But I endure for all it's worth
A weary gaze upon this earth I see
A creation defiled that can't be saved
Longing for an early grave

In a world weighted down by death
You can't be saved by the likes of men

Darkness of hell and a night deprived
We found ourselves under meager skies
A fate that won't subside
We will all waste away
Further forging the eclipse
Longing for an early grave

A species drenched in malevolence
You can't be saved by the likes of men
But I endure for all it's worth
A weary gaze upon this earth I see
A creation defiled
Longing for the end

Darkness of hell and a night deprived
We found ourselves under meager skies
A fate that won't subside
We will all waste away
We can't be saved by the likes of men
