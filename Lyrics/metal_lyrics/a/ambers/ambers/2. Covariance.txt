I am just an instance an occurrence
Mind and matter forming and disband
Lost in the vortex in this moment in time I coincide
Do you feel unique as you wake and breathe
With no purpose on your mind
There must be more than this
A leaf that blows in the wind

We are all peripheral
Like grains of sand running through my hands
Exist like a spark in the night
One fragile moment you blow out

A glimpse like a spark in the wind
Fragile moments now astray
I wrapped myself in disbelief
We are drifting away

Lost in the vortex in this moment I coincide
I lost myself in the crowd

We are all peripheral
Like grains of sand running through my hands
Existence like a spark in the night
One fragile moment you blow out

A glimpse like a spark in the wind
Fragile moments now astray
I wrapped myself in disbelief
We are drifting all away

Just a glimpse like a spark in the wind
Our life fades away in the great scheme of things
Closing our eyes

I am just an instance an occurrence
Mind and matter forming and disband
