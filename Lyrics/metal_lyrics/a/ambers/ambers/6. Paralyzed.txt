Have we faced this truth in vain
The crown of creation yet is our fate the same
We don't seem to feel this pain
So we are marching on to the point of no return

I have fallen victim I am the same to blame
Paralyzed
Too far away too abstract to grasp
I'm nothing but a passenger

I have given up control
Lethargy has served to tie my hands
I am just a sad excuse of what I wish to be

We are paralyzed they took our minds away
We are paralyzed distractions are leading
This lethargy served to tie my hands

Free me from my restrains
Free me from my restrains

Have we faced this truth in vain
The crown of creation yet is our fate the same
Some more pills to numb the pain
So we're marching on to the point of no return

I have fallen victim I am the same to blame
Paralyzed

I've given up control
Lethargy has served to tie my hands
I am just a sad excuse of what I wish to be

We are paralyzed they took our minds away
We are paralyzed distractions are leading
This lethargy served to tie my hands

So we are marching on as fear ceases to exist
In our minds
In our minds
