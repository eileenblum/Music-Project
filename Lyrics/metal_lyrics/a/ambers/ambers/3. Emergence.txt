Sacrificed by the altar of interest
False intention veiled in righteousness
Desolation in the name of progression
Burn it all down I will be the king of the ashes
King of barren land

A black mass emerging from chaos
A ladder you failed to climb
Born from the womb of abysmal dark
Hidden in plain sight

They taught us fear
We taught them hate
Bound to the evil that we create

Sacrificed for progression I can forgive but I never forget
You burned it all down and I will be the king of the ashes
King of barren land

If you fight blood with blood guess what will be spilled
Now we are bound to the evil that we create
Condemned in reflections of consequence
They are facing the darkness
Dark that never ends

They taught us fear
We taught them hate
Bound to the evil that we create
Born from the womb of the abysmal dark
Hidden in plain sight

Sacrificed for progression I can forgive but I never forget
You burned it all down and I will be the king of the ashes
King of barren land

A blood debt repaid
