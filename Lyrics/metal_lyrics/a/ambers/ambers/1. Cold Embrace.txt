Life is passing by you suffer sorrow fills the void
Sadness as a residue still resides in my head

Eternal sleep took him gently in his arms
To wake up nevermore

Taken by a cold embrace as they called his name
Life was stolen and non given back

Descending

Transcending through the spheres
Were there is no above no below

The frailty of life has never been so clear
Hold it tight as long as it still runs through your veins

Descending now cold beneath his touch
As this light started to fade you leave us in the dark

The sorrow fills the void you left in our hearts
Descending

The spheres

Transcending through the spheres
Were there is no above no below

Cherish the gift of life
Before it is denied
