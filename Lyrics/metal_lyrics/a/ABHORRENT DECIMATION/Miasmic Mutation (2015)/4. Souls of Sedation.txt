Suspended, distant life, desire conflicts the mind,
Distracted, distorted, vision of my own design,
Repugnant existence, content with forging a life,
Replacing ambition with subservency.
For now, we are living, amid futility,
Look beyond the arcane message thatâs carved into the minds ofâ¦
Aimless, liars, void of meaning,
Deny your forms direction and give into despondency.
We are the souls of sedation
We are the curse of creation
A decline, over time, shattered dreams, abolish life,
Disregarding purpose, deepen the distortion â a state for the condemned,
Spiritual purgatory, undefined destiny, revel in agony,
Shrouding real life, with your fantasy.
The blind will soon be forced to see,
The dismal traits of flesh that form society,
Voiceless, hatred, longing to break free,
Give your form direction and constitute supremacy.
We are the souls of sedation
We are the curse of creation
Boundless hate for this life,
Atone for hollow avarice,
Your living lie you despise,
To leave with nothing, nothing but a debt.

I, the words of all deceased,
Forming from the scorn of wretched serenity
I, the grind of regularity
Present in the core of every expression
Repulsed by survival, the cloud is closing in,
The mind for now departs the flesh, submitting to the phantom mist,
Faithless, titan, immortal being,
First strip the mind of purpose then ravish the carcass.
We are the souls of sedation
We are the curse of creation
We are the (we are the) spawn of dejection
We are the (we are the) souls of sedation
Just as the nimbus ordained,
Reverend of pain and suffering,
Begin the march of ruin,
Onward to grave misfortune, bound by the monotony.
We are the souls
We are the curse
We are the souls of sedation
We are the curse of creation
