I can see the burning of souls,
Cast out the scriptures,
Forget the rotten,
Forget false idols,
Open your mind in age of new enlightenment.
Remove the manacle,
Cut out the tongue of Christ,
Disgusting holy society,
God's word is useless to me.
Terminal reality,
Religious incantation,
Terminal reality,
Your idols are gaunt as we drain them of life.
I can hear the slaughter of gods,
Allowing immolation,
Unchain disciples,
Freedom of billions,
Open your mind in age of new enlightenment.
Erase your devotion,
Rip out the heart of hope,
Think of those adrift in recollection,
One day, they will struggle to breathe.
Terminal reality,
Cerebral incantations,
Terminal reality,

Your idols are gaunt as we drain them of life.
Do not be controlled through life by limitations,
Beyond this earth there is no mass salvation,
He has lost without chance to defend.
His disposition, rots.
Rots!
How are we to perceive what is dying in his mind,
Memory, sympathy, simple actions are denied,
Liberty for one more day,
You had your chance to advance.
Erase the devotion,
Rip out the heart of hope,
Think of those adrift in recollection,
Your god means nothing to me.
Terminal reality,
Religious incantation,
Terminal reality,
Your idols are gaunt as we drain them of life.
Terminal reality,
Cerebral incantations,
Terminal reality,
Your idols are gaunt as we drain them of life.
