I, the rotten beast, the afterlife,
Promises of god are set aside,
Beckoning the end, my genocide,
Forever waiting, thisâ¦ my time.
Eternal repulsion
Into the ice, I see them slain,
Glacial resolve, calcify the pain,
Frozen for their sins, the end of days,
Never to see the sun again.
Eternal repulsion,
Human rejection.
Lies, rooted in the crystal deep,
Hiding from a world that they failed repeatedly.
False, teachings lead them to believe,
The sacrifice was made, long before they were conceived.
So now they rest in peace with me,
I will not relent the torturing,
Exploit the young, now withering ,
You must watch them die and burn with me.
Eternal repulsion,
Human rejection.
Lies, rooted in the crystal deep,
Hiding from a world that they failed repeatedly.

False, teachings lead them to believe,
The sacrifice was made, long before they were conceived.
Traitors, frozen in ice.
Traitors, questioning why, brazen with their life.
Traitors, insolent minds.
Traitors, frozen in ice.
Retrospective scream from inside the ice,
Bodies void of life but with active minds.
You, can't foresee the suffering the bodies will be open to,
Cryogenic mutilation, icy walls surrounding you.
Is this not the heaven you want. You will feel
Eternal repulsion
The rotten beast, the afterlife,
Promises of god are set aside,
Beckoning the end, my genocide,
Forever waiting, thisâ¦ my time.
The epoch of god has passed,
A new dawn has begun.
The titan can finally bask,
Surveying all that's lost inside this glacial vortex.
