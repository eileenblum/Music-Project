I did not beg to the monarch of heaven,
I did not kneel before the king of hell,
No wash of light to bathe me in,
No eruption of flames to devour my eradicated flesh.
I am the idol of sacrifice,
Preserved in perfect form,
In the planetary cavity,
Until a day of reckoning.
I am the icon of loss,
Buried beneath the ice,
In a crypt of asphyxiating solitude,
Until my heart beats again.
A servant to deaths design,
Weep for the world you once knew.
I did not lay with a siren of sin,
I did not feast on the beauty of flesh,
No tempting snake to lure me in,
No conception of lust to suppress my craving skin.
The final resting place, this is history personified.
View, the past as present day.
We are set to wallow in the mire,
Forget your thoughts of the afterlife,
This is reality,
Formed among the frozen waves of lost mortality,

There is nothing beyond this agony
Conceal earth like a cloak, a mental state of degradation,
Offering to the immortals, I can hear them screaming for me...
Now I have formed, I will give this earth a revolution,
Remodelled orb, I have given life a definition
Cleansing the earth, anew,
You will not live beyond me
I did not beg to the monarch of heaven,
I did not kneel before the king of hell,
No wash of light to bathe me in,
No eruption of flames to devour my eradicated flesh.
Memories, fail me.
Sorrow, consumes me,
Contact, eludes me,
There is, nothing
Forget your thoughts of the afterlife,
This is reality,
Formed among the frozen waves of lost mortality,
There is nothing beyond this agony
Sentenced to death.
