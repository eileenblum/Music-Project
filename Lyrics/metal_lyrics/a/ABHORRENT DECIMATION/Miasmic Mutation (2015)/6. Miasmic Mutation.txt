Across the planes of infinity,
From the ice you can see my divinity,
Greater than life,
Darker than death,
In my wake I leave a cosmos bereft,
Without my, existence,
Your controlled until the end,
Only now I let you see,
Only now I set you free.
The cloud of death and fear,
Miasmic mutation,
Let the cull begin,
I have stood before the end, and your god, is not there.
Above the ice of fatality,
The rapture of mortality,
Witness my, genocide,
Your controlled until the end,
Only now I let you see,
Only now I set you free
The cloud of death and fear,
Miasmic mutation,
Let the cull begin,
I have stood before the end, and your god, is not there.
I'm taking form, an allegory of your life and god (life and god),
In viribus aniame, mortuorum ego (mortuus),
I've taken earth, repulsed by the silence as life is lost (life is lost).
Growing, I will infect what is left,
Leading the lamb to its serpent,

The king of the lost souls,
Beckoning the end.
Damnation ingrained,
Simply removing everything,
Give your life to me.
Mutation waits for nothing,
I, I am the alpha.
Open the graves of my dynasty,
Tarnish the tale of fantasy,
Now I have formed, look to me,
Dictator of the frozen sea.
Dominate, serpentine,
Your controlled until the end,
Only now I let you see,
Only now I set you free.
The cloud of death and fear,
Miasmic mutation,
Let the cull begin,
I have stood before the end, and your god, is not there.
I'm taking form, an allegory of your life and god (life and god),
In viribus aniame, mortuorum ego (mortuus),
I've taken earth, repulsed by the silence as life is lost (life is lost).
In viribus aniame, mortuorum ego (mortuus),
In viribus aniame, mortuorum ego (mortuus).
