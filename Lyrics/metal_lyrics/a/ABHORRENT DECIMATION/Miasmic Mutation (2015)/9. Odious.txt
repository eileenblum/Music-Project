This, a message from a future world,
Despair is the breath that I expel,
Centuries have passed,
Countless days have withered away.
The taste of death in every mouth,
Unhallowed grief on every brow,
Misery is a part of your destiny,
Hate is the fruit that draws you in...
To the portal, my soul is dead (we had our time),
Wading through glare, set deep in the crevasse,
Screaming, for hell to avow.
I paid in blood and bone, yet my debt remains,
My corpse, to be held captive in this glacial domain.
Emptiness, darker than the hole from which I came,
A sacrifice nailed in this shallow grave.
Born odious, ingrained, never to see the sun again.
Born odious, enslaved, never again to taste the flesh.
Born odious, repulsed, breathless sleep until the dawn.
Born odious, detained, in pain.
I am ingrained,
I am enslaved,

I have repulsed,
I will detain.
Forever trapped within,
Wanting to be all of my suffering,
The serpents are begging,
Screaming, for hell to avow.
I paid in blood and bone, yet my debt remains,
My corpse, to be held captive in this glacial domain.
Emptiness, darker than the hole from which I came,
A sacrifice nailed in this shallow grave.
Born odious, ingrained, never to see the sun again.
Born odious, enslaved, never again to taste the flesh.
Born odious, repulsed, breathless sleep until the dawn.
Born odious, detained, in pain.
Born odious, ingrained, never to see the sun again.
Born odious, enslaved, never again to taste the flesh.
Born odious, repulsed, breathless sleep until the dawn.
Born odious, detained, in pain
