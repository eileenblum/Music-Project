I take your final breath, sadistic rhapsody,
Surpass divinity in the echoes of the vortex.
Tell your secrets to the deep, repent is for the weak,
The open eye signifies, the incarnation finally speaks.
Pathetic murmurs of penance, a solitary journey into hell,
In the mouth of the genocide chasm, sacrificed is the catechized martyr of the form.
I take your final breath, sadistic rhapsody,
Surpass divinity in the echoes of the vortex.
Rapture in the maelstrom,
Set free your darkest of depravities, give your hatred to me.
Immure minds need to quantify, do you die with the misery held?
Or do you rise with the grievance revealed? To give life to the mind of this withering human shell.
I take your final breath, sadistic rhapsody,
Surpass divinity in the echoes of the vortex.
Its victim, selected through calculated bigotry,
Malignant tyranny, consuming all it sees.
Forging the macabre void, taking on odious form.
Lament, revenge, excess, detest marks the beckoning of its dawn.

Suffocate the myth of speech that it needs to feast, harbouring its oracle beneath the sea
I can hear the screams of falsehood it blissfully reaps,
Living deep within the entity,
Your life is not enough, your thoughts are what it longs for, mutation growing strong with every fibre of your soul.
Echoes
Denounce the throne of bone, the whirlpool draws you in,
A new dawn has begun, the shape will kill again.
The final breath, mortal rhapsody,
Surpassed divinity in the echoes of the vortex.
Voided of consciousness,
Dragged from the light, where death sets in forged from lies.
Bathe in lucid misery, I am the design
Cascade into the
Echoes of the vortex
