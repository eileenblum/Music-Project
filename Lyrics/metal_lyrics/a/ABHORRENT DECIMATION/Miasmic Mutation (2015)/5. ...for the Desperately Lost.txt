Audacious lust for,
Expiration and decay, flowing from my rigid horde,
I have formed from the vast desolation,
If your soul is crippled and despondent offer your soul to thee,
Stay with me in my domain beyond this world.
O' future self, I know that I have sinned,
Forgive me as I take this blade and end the suffering,
I could not fathom a life that I dictate,
So have this husk for its procession, turn me to slate.
Separating mind from remains, taken to the deviants gateways,
Overcoming mortal boundaries, was the only answer for the desperately lost

Deafening screams,
Heard from below,
Chants of the dead,
At his command.
O' former world, how loathsome it had been,
The semblance of delirium had wilted from within,
Chilling visions of my burial, consecrate my adoration,
Overcoming mortal boundaries, was the only answer for the desperately lost

Deafening screams,
Heard from below,
Chants of the dead,
At his command..
The dire shift, from this reality,

Into the crypt of ice and deceit,
The frozen tomb, elevates my state,
Is this your design for the desperately lost.
Expiration and decay, flowing from my rigid horde,
I have formed from the vast desolation,
If your soul is crippled and despondent offer your soul to thee,
Stay with me in my domain beyond this world.
O' future self, now that we have sinned,
We see the corpse in crystal form renew its prejudice,
Tempted, baited, sealed within,
Confined inside a private hell, the grief now echoing.
Separating mind from remains, taken to the deviants gateways,
Overcoming mortal boundaries, was the only answer for the desperately lost

Harrowing deed,
Frozen in form,
Cries of the cold,
At his design.
Deafening screams,
Heard from below,
Chants of the dead,
At his command.
