I drowned and entombed
I refuse to relent
Glaciate the servants
To save them all from sin

Waiting for centuries
I told them my vision would mirror the end of days

They worship terror I can't negate
Creating a void in space
I have resurged to restore what is left for me

I murder all the inhabitants
Swallow the soul of existence
Still I will decimate
'Til nothing remains

Eradicate, faith
Obliterate, your belief

I am the proof that your god is dead
I am the prophet of hate and regret
Give promise, then fail
Those who were to lead blind
I will erase God for all mankind

I slaughter and maim
I refuse to believe
That with boundless freedom
Man reveres doctrine

This is the end of the ancient prophecy

Replace the suffering
Longing for something to shepherd my misery

I remain to see his light
I remain to see him fight
I cannot feel the spirit you're praying for

I murder all the inhabitants
Swallow the soul of existence
Still I will decimate
'Til nothing remains

Eradicate, faith
Obliterate, belief

[Solo]

I am the proof that your god is dead
I am the prophet of hate and regret
Give promise, then fail
Those who were to lead blind
I will erase God for all mankind
