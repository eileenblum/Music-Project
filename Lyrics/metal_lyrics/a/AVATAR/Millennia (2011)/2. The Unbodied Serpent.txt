Before a yawning gulf of time he stands
alone in the long-drawn evening twilight
melting into the everything, swallowing darkness
he stands, his soul, an empty cauterizing wound

His psyche:
Oh, unbodied serpent
the eye deep in thought
oh, unbodied serpent
full of pride and glory

In his bare hands he clasps a star
a star reflected by the pure steel of this knife
(and) he wonders, is the star one of his memories
or a future over the yawning gulf of life?

His eyes meet the sea, his survivor
and survivor of the spiral of time
the wind (which blows away the time)
caresses his face as a passioned gasp of breath
and disturbed by images, he heard the call

His psyche:
Oh, unbodied serpent
the eye deep in thought
oh, unbodied serpent
full of pride and glory

The moon sank low under the edge of the world
a sight he might never seen
behind the lenses of his eyes the emptiness took place
and on his body appeared a rose of the purest blood
