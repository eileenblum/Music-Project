(365 BC) The Macedonian godchild... we hear his name
his father Philip... blessed his fame!
Aristoteles... his name we sing
wisdom and courage he taught our king!

From Greece until the Indus, may my faith forget to speak
Egypt shall be mine, Alexandria shall be born
with 35000 men I stand, the Persians we shall stride
all those other men, their lives forlorn!

Alexander The Great!

King Darius, your fleet I made to sink
all the continents of the world shall belong to me
I spread my words, with violence or with peace
because Hellenism is my faith, so kneel or be dead!

Across the world, my armies will march
towards our goal, the land of the unknown
I'm the king of the world, the messenger of gods
one king, one people, for our soil we will fight!

Alexander The Great!

Entire Corinth, they hoped to see this mighty king
all, except one, named Diogenes of Synope
while he was enjoying the warmth of the sun
Alexander arrived, with his head up high
he greeted the man: "Get out of my sun"
so said Diogenes. Alexander, unconcerned, spoke:
"If I would not be Alexander The Great.
I would like to be Diogenes"

Alexander The Great!
