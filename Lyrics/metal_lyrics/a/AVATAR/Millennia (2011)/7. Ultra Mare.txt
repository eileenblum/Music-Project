My little girl
you fascinate me
intrigue me
amuse me
draw me away
and lift me up
from the heaviness of thought

Undressed
nothing exists without
these warm hands
draw you away
and lift you up
curling and crawling
nothing exists outside

My little girl
light of my life
lustre of my crown
sing to me your silly songs
amuse me
seduce me
convince me and remind
that something exists inside

Undressed
I want to make you feel
like a leather jacket
I want to wear you out
touching softly
the unbearable
essence of life

Tristful black
may do
without me
when I'm into you
