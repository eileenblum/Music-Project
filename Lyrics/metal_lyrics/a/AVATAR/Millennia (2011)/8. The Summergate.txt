Its surface playful as silver birds
the stream trickles through the gateway
the sun embroidering
intricate patterns upon the rocks
scattered about by time itself
once again I hear the soothing whisper of
my fair lady, the dryad of summer gate
beautiful yet broken descants, firm but trembling

This is the past turned to present
remembering this blissful picture
torn apart your loss
a dying petal on a ravishin flower

I hear the falls where I first met you
mingling with my tears, the flow of life
I feel my hand upon the cold stone
where before I caressed your white skin

This twilight grove of willows
is darkened by your presence
your flaunting black hair engulfed by the sun
joining the dancing shadows upon your tomb

This is the past turned to present
remembering this blissful picture
torn apart your loss
a dying petal on a ravishin flower

Ruakha
Ruakha treiaki'u enki e-shaosa'ye
