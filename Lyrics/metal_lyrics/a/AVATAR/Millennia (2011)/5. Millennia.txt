Out of his caverns came a curious caveman
into a world unchanged by human hands
first in time, at the dawn of man
unaware of the swords, the bloody wars
a million lives in a finger full of shit
a necessity to kill to survive
now left behind in between the stars

In cigarette fumes so loud and clear
four thousand million years implode
to Cambrium wine the king endears
his wings to sanction mayfly years

By a lack of love the genius creates - Millennia
to the burning point of sublimation - Millennia
holier than holy the heavens collapse - Millenia
in science, in earth and in procreation - Millennia

Lightning is the fundamental power of the universe!

The secret of the sun is now revealed
and brought to life by civilisation
out of the many came forth the few
ephemeral, a genius forms a generation

Wisdom can't be stopped by senseless guillotines
the world spins around, the time turned back
medieval sounds of siege aren't stronger
than victorian pride and prejudice

In cigarette fumes so loud and clear
four thousand million years implode
to Cambrium wine the king endears
his wings to sanction mayfly years

By a lack of love the genius creates - Millennia
to the burning point of sublimation - Millennia
holier than holy the heavens collapse - Millenia
in science, in earth and in procreation - Millennia

I do beseech you honestly
no spaceship rides on carelessness
in plastic forms the fumes are born
the lighter lits a mad god's death

By a lack of love the genius creates - Millennia
to the burning point of sublimation - Millennia
holier than holy the heavens collapse - Millenia
in science, in earth and in procreation - Millennia
