No more grim triviality persues your breasts
firmly heaving upward, containing naught but red wine

Closing the chapters of a life within the confines of memory
this past of mine covers a deeper love, a touch of humor not quite my own

Closing the picture, this place of mine
covering deeper spaces never suspected to find you all
breaking out so much harmony within

Ever so silent, ever so alive discovering a humor that is not quite my own
A life I've never suspected to find you all inside

I remember the mountain, I remember you all
I'm sorry to say this picture isn't real
