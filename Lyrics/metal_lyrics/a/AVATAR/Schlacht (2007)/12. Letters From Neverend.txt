One second of life between cradle and grave
A lifetime to face all man's shortcomings
Your loneliest sleep is when you're awake
Open your eyes and look into forever
In the whirlwinds of time you'll soon be forgotten
Your existence a lie that's never been told
The shortest path to the end of the universe
Is to look into your inside out

You are me
I'm them
They're you
It's all a question of cloaks and masks
You are me
I'm them
They're you
The masquerade stops
This is Neverend

I wanted to show you this place in my mind
Deep into the forest away from the world
A land I'm forgetting and discovering each time
I dream of forever and turn into God
This is the mirror that shows me the world
The reflection cast shadows of your height and shape
And you're looking back from inside of my body
And smiles to a life that ends

You are me
I'm them
They're you
It's all a question of cloaks and masks
You are me
I'm them
They're you
The masquerade stops
This is Neverend

Neverend!

One second of life between cradle and grave
A lifetime to face all man's shortcomings
Your loneliest sleep is when you're awake
Open your eyes and look into forever

You are me
I'm them
They're you
It's all a question of cloaks and masks
You are me
I'm them
They're you
The masquerade stops
This is Neverend
