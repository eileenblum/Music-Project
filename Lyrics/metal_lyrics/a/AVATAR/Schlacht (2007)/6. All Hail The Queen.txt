BOW DOWN! BOW DOWN!
BOW DOWN! BOW DOWN!

She roams the skies on a starless night
Ghosts among drones seeking the final solution
Parasite sees and parasite knows
She'll find you and she'll save us all
It's war

BOW DOWN! BOW DOWN!
WAR!
BOW DOWN! BOW DOWN!

Stand up
Raise your hands
All hail the queen
Get down
On your knees
All hail the queen

She flies with the lords on winds of the moon
Her visions reaches furthest of all
Whatever the cargo, the carriers will fail
Whatever the cost, the hive must prevail

BOW DOWN! BOW DOWN!
WAR!
BOW DOWN! BOW DOWN!

Stand up
Raise your hands
All hail the queen
Get down
On your knees
All hail the queen
