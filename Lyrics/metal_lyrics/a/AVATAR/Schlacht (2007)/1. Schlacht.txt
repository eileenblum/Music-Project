Under the butcher's knife
Life is more present than ever
A life that fades away
Before I die I'll dream
One dream that'll last me forever
Forever dead in sleep
The green beneath the waves, first time seen
By drowning

How could you know?
How could you know this was living?
Nobody told
Nobody told you about living
Now you're leaving...
DIE!

Like mother Nature rules
Survival of the filthiest
The maggots make the rules
The highest of humans,
Still just the lowest of life
The rulers in the dirt
Look at the world from the eyes of a pig

We all deserve to die!
We all deserve to die!!
We all deserve to die!!!
WE ALL DESERVE TO DIE!!!!

Cannibalism, cannibalism
Cannibalism, cannibalism
Cannibalism, cannibalism
Cannibalism when a swine eats a pig

This is what it'll always come down to
Don't you see what you're all doing?
Don't you feel?
Slaughtering just to be slaughtered and tamed by yourselves
You're just meat!
The quality of your flesh measures your life span
WE ALL DESERVE TO DIE!!!!

How could you know?
How could you know this was living?
Nobody told
Nobody told you about living
Now you're leaving...
DIE!

How could you know?
How could you know this was living?
Nobody told
Nobody told you about living
Now you're leaving...
DIE!
