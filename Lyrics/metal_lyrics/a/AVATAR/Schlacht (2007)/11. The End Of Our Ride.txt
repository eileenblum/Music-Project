Try to freeze the moment
She's as close as possible
To the enemy
To the wall
Try to breath through the smoke
Get as high as possible
To resist what flows
To survive the ride

I thank what's almighty that I never looked
Never looked into your eyes
I hate the times that we are parted
Not in flesh but in mind
I could kill to find away to lift your curse
But I am hoping for life
I fear that the end of the falling will
Be the end of our ride

Try to flee the moment
He's as dark as possible
To make sure he's living
Wrapped in cloaks
Loves the shattered clouds
As they kiss his crown
Can't resist what flows
To deny the ride

I thank what's almighty that I never looked
Never looked into your eyes
I hate the times that we are parted
Not in flesh but in mind
I could kill to find away to lift your curse
But I am hoping for life
I fear that the end of the falling will
Be the end of our ride

Try to read the movements
To save some lives
Try to laugh at moments
When the stakes are too high to take on

I thank what's almighty that I never looked
Never looked into your eyes
I hate the times that we are parted
Not in flesh but in mind
I could kill to find away to lift your curse
But I am hoping for life
I fear that the end of the falling will
Be the end of our ride
