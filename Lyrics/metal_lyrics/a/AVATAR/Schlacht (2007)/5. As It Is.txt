Tears of faith roll down  my face
A glimpse into perfection
A minute of eternity
In absence of rejection
A Presence of simplicity
Observing all that is
In Grace of contemplation serenity and bliss

Matter whirling like a stream
Recreating these bodies
Consistent it would seem
But flowing, not here to stay
In your bodily sensations
As true as " truth" could be
A path to liberation
Aware - Just letting be

Feel your pleasure, pain
As it goes away - And i say
It's not here to stay
Just observe...
Observe it as it is
Try to stop the rain
And it'll be in vain
Feel your pleasure, pain
To Face...
To face your own resistance

They can not grasp who you are
And neither can you my friend
Disguised like the Avatar
A mystery of flesh and bones
Feel the faith of life refill you
Arise and pass away
Like dust from distant shores in wind
Blowing, Not here to stay - Not here to stay

Who is this You, walking?
Was that your Choice?
Who is this You, talking?
Was that Your voice?
Something more, something less?
Process of consciousness
Nothing more, nothing less?
For us to curse, for us to bless

Feel your pleasure, pain
As it goes away - And i say
It's not here to stay
Just observe...
Observe it as it is
Try to stop the rain
And it'll be in vain
Feel your pleasure, pain
To Face...
To face your own resistance

Feel your pleasure, pain
As it goes away - And i say
It's not here to stay
Just observe...
Observe it as it is
Try to stop the rain
And it'll be in vain
Feel your pleasure, pain
To Face...
To face your own resistance
