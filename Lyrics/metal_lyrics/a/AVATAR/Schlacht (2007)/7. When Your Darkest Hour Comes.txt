You turn your back
Turn your back
Turn your back on me
There are flowers in the desert
Waiting for you to rain
Make a wish
Make a wish
Make a wish for me
You have never cried for help before...

Eyelids tell no tales
Of the ghosts that haunts your eyes
When your darkest hour comes
I'll be your guide

There are more tears
Are more tears
Are more tears than sweat
You held me trough my falling
You made me
I'm reborn
There's no more fear
No fear
No fear of failing
We're turning to each other
And I'm turning into you

Eyelids tell no tales
Of the ghosts that haunts your eyes
When your darkest hour comes
I'll be your guide

Turn your eyes in and your words out

The door is slammed
Door is slammed
So I'll break the wall
I'm coming out to get you
I will never let you go
We're in control
In control
In controlled chaos
Your element is fire
Ride out with my storm

Eyelids tell no tales
Of the ghosts that haunts your eyes
When your darkest hour comes
I'll be your guide

Eyelids tell no tales
Of the ghosts that haunts your eyes
When your darkest hour comes
I'll be your guide
