Have you ever wondered what would
Happen to your soul if you'd open a door?
Have you ever listened to the wood and
Wondered who it's calling for?
Have you ever dreamt of heeding
The call that's inside your chest?
Have you ever dared to imagine
A chance of you taking the test?

Fight!
This life is yours
This life is yours

Child, grow wild
Like the flowers' dance
You've only got one chance
In this lifetime
To give them a sign
Find your way
To where the sinners roam
Just look under the snow
And find starlight
Don't Give them your prime

Do you even dare to imagine a
Life outside your cradle?
Do you belong to those who fear that a
Sting of life would be fatal?
Can you smell the autumn rain when you
Hide behind your walls
Can you see the stars that shine?
You could be the star that falls

Fight!
This life is yours
This life is yours

Child, grow wild
Like the flowers' dance
You've only got one chance
In this lifetime
To give them a sign
Find your way
To where the sinners roam
Just look under the snow
And find starlight
Don't Give them your prime

For all that's dying
Just let it die
Break out of the wheel
And you're alive
