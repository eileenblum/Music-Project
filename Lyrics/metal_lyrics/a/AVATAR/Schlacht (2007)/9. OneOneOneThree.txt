I know we've been wandering
To long and to far
But behind those hills
They are
The ones who are dancing
Blessed by the Star
I'd like to pretend
I'm among them

Could it be?

My longing began at one one one three
I just realized how hollow I am
I came here to taste a drop of your wine
And maybe I'll be ready for the dance

The steps are hard
And our feet a weary
But maybe the dance will make us fly
Yet still I'm unable
To rise to my knees
The chains around my wrists are soft and warm
"Soft and tender..."

My longing began at one one one three
I just realized how hollow I am
I came here to taste a drop of your wine
And maybe I'll be ready for the dance

No one has ever cleared my doubt
No one has ever given me the answers
No one knows the dark I see
And no one can see light as I
No one dreams the dreams of mine
No one commits my sins but me
No one has ever seen but You
And I know it's true

I'll stand tall as a child
And ask for forgiveness
No more lies as I hear
The voice from the hills

The voice from the hills

My longing began at one one one three
I just realized how hollow I am
I came here to taste a drop of your wine
And maybe I'll be ready for the dance
