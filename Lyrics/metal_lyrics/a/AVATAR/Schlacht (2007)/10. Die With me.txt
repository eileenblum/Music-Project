Floating, into the dark
Falling, dreams fall apart
I long for, the light of the stars
I watch the sky as it falls
Caught in a cage I've made myself
Self made cage
Looking up on the planet rain
End of our age

I can not take it on my own
I can not take it all alone

As the world comes to an end I ask
Will you stand here by my side and cry with me?
And as it all falls apart I need
To know that you'll stay and die with me

Breathless, turning to stone
Helpless, don't leave me alone
They're fighting, the voices in me-
Keeping me from fighting free
But in your arms they all fall in silence
And let me sleep
In your voice a soothing song
Just let me sleep

I can not take it on my own
I can not take it all alone

As the world comes to an end I ask
Will you stand here by my side and cry with me?
And as it all falls apart I need
To know that you'll stay and die with me

In the end all I do is a lie
...In the end...
In the end all I do is a lie
...In the end...
In the end all I do is a lie
...In the end...
In the end all I do is a lie
...In the end...
