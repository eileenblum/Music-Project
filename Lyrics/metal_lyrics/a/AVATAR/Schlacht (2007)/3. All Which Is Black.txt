Father
Please stay away
Let me run, let me run
Let me out of this place
Father
Don't take me home
Let me stay in the light
Where there's no place for you

Father
Why are you mine?
Tell me of freedom
Of escaping from you
Father
I feel the tide
Father... father
HELP ME, I'M DROWNING

This demon child
Comes from my seed
And all which is black
Is mine
He's mine

Mother where are you now?
This like is cold, I'm alone, I'm a ghost with no name
Mother, can't you hear?
A voice that screams that is me
That is me
Mother
You've let me down
I'm doing time for a crime I didn't commit
Mother he pulls me down
Mother, mother
HELP ME I'M DROWNING

This demon child
Comes from my seed
And all which is black
Is mine
He's mine

Abort refuse destroy forget
Kill the son I never had
Abort Refuse destroy
FORGET

This demon child
Comes from my seed
And all which is black
Is mine
He's mine

This demon child
Comes from my seed
And all which is black
Is mine
He's mine
