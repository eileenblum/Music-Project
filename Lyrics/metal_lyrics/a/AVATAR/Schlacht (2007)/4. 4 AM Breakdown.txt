Night...
Childhood
Is what you see
If you manage to cut through the curtains of rain
Childhood
Is always there to remind me
To remind of all the pain

It always gets you in the dark
It's always leaving a mark
You're being crushed like a grape
It fucks you while you scream "rape!"
They're saying that they're your friends
You're being fucked out of sense
School, work and all that you eat
March with the Nazis!

Angel
Can't you see?
She's not as she's
Supposed to be
She gives me
Everything
(YOU GAVE ME EVERYTHING)
Just give up and get in

Baby girl
Let me taste all of you
Can you be my
Paper doll
Porn star
And all they want me to want you to be

Angel
Can't you see?
She's not as she's
Supposed to be
She gives me
Everything
(YOU GAVE ME EVERYTHING)
Just give up and get in

Angel
Can't you see?
She's not as she's
Supposed to be
She gives me
Everything
(YOU GAVE ME EVERYTHING)
Just give up and get in
