With the pride of the silent Storm
Came the Hordes of the Dark conqueror
For Thousands of ages crossing the land of Stars
Carrying a crown of thunders

Under a sky of a million of moons
Mortals watch the coming end
A prophecy made long time ago
By the eternal nothingness...

Chaos returned under the mastery of Ancient Lords
The night feels like eternity again
Everything... the ancient Kingdom
Like written in the neverending Books

Darkness rises eternally before the dawn
The stars know their meaning in the
Endlessness of Time
So let it be, eternally...

Under a sky of a million of moon.
Mortals watch the coming end
A prophecy made longtime ago
By the eternal nothingness...
