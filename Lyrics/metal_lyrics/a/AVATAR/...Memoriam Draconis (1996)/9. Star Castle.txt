Domes cover underground Chambers
raising a (Mighty) tower tall to the Sky
Where the Lords of the West gather
Once again to explore the Crystal Night
Instruments of Oak and Brass at hand
Before the Gateway to the Stars they Stand
Circular joined in concentration
Persistence, anticipation
The window Opens

Respire the flow, the scolding stream!
Threefold the current of Zephyrous Wings!!!
While infringing the doors of the alluring sky
Mesmerized by the Astral constellations

Lost Souls shelter in churning seas
Primordial shapes on Solar Winds
Masters of Space, time and Infinity
No barrier they do not Overpass!!!

Domes cover underground Chambers
Noble Lords stand tall to the Sky
Whilst they Carry Draconis to the Netherworld
Black clouds gather on Western Winds
Shiver, burn and Atomize
Galaxies of perennial marvel
Unforsaken Oceans enshrined
In a Matrix of Worship and Devotion
