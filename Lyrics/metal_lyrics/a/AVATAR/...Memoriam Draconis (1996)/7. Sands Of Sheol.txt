With fire and sword, with water and dagger
With the assistance of thunder and rain
With the open sky above I concieve
With the Blood and with pride I unchain...
Satan!

Into spirals coiled His Wisdom
Venture forth the Maskim Ways
Under the Sign of the Foremost Lord
Tread the Sands of the Farthest Shore!
...the Farthest Shore!

His Will penetrating the essence of my being
His Dream of Dark Majesty I share
...I Share!... I Share!
Chanting... Chanting... Forevermore!

Like a Tree, chained to the earth
But always reaching for the Stars
Through the sands of Sheol bleeding I crawl
And I know that I'll reach the Sea...
And His breath raving, tearing at me
Pulling me down it compels me to kneel

Cold Steel embrace, shivering Kiss of God
Stripped naked I lie feeling old, So old
From beginning to end I witness
The Names of the Dead
Enter me...

A morning breeze blows through my hair
I face the day but in my Heart I see
The Sands take their rise to bury and Darken
The land of RA! The land of RA!
