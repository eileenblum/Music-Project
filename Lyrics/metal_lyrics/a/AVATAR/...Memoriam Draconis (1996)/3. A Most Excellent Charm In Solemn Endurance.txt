By the works of Darkness... My
By the works of Hatred... Eyes
By the rites of the Waste... Meet
By the words of Pain... Yours

And our eyes meet the flames!

Zi dingir Cutha, Kampa!
Zi dingir Absu, Kampa!
Zi dingir Cutha, Kampa!
Zi dingir Absu, Kampa!!!

No spice shall ever silence my hunger
No wine shall ever silence my thirst.
No delight shall ever satisfy my senses
No woman shall ever satisfy my lust.
My eyes meet yours and I turn my face away
