The light has killed my deepest emotions
My thoughts are as snowed winterfields
I am one with the pit, enemy of the Sun
Immortal is what I will become
I fear the day, Live by the Shadows of Mephistopheles
We became the Emperors Of the Night,
The destroyers of the crucifix
On lonely nights I dance with the Wintershadows
And satisfy my deepest Desires
Evil powers Bestow upon me and feast with me,
The powers of the Thorned Moon Nanna is with us
Emperors of the Night
I open my arms, cold winds blow through my Soul
My eyes look into the Black mirror
Now I see it clear, eternal Darkness shines
Through the gate, I will Follow...
Hate lives by my side, vengeance is my Desire
I drink your Blood From the Chalice of Abaddon
I howl as a Wolf of Fenriz
I belong to the eternal Shadows
Emperors Of The Night
