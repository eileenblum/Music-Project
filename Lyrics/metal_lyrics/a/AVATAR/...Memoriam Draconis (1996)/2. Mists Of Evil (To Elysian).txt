Sadly, I depart
To a land too profound
To be discouvered
By mankind

Engendered out of images
Fed by broken hope
I fly... my wings carried
By the breath of ages...

The decay of your love
Was the key to my voyage
To settle in your dreams...
Forever

Encouraged by your fear
For them who were wrong
and were predistined
To stay this way

Like a whirlwind
You pass by
Clothed in your mantle of innocence
The passing of the fluxes
Forever put down!

Undecieved, loathesome whore
You take me to Innaya
The paths are burning
With the greenish fire of repressed sadness

Elysian
Enveil me with your velvet eyes
Elysian
Forelorn goddess of the lie
Elysian
My broken heart will be erased
Elysian
Tenderly walk by... disgraced

Elysian
Take My Grief... To the Gods
Elysian
The one I loved... Oh
Desipience

Releaved...
