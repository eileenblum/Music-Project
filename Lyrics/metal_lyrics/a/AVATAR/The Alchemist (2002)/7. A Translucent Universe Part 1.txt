All pregnant women have in their woms two infants; the stronger of them can't accept the existence of someone he should share everything with.
Still in the woms, he chokes his weak brother and tries to disolve him in surrounding clear fluid that bends truth as a crooked mirror.
Man comes alome into this world his mortal sin upon him.
He is to live in solitude, his murder disclosed by the stigma of his hideous size, as by a wound ugly at sight.
Mankind consists of ogres with cannibal teeth.
They began with fratricide and provoked evil cascading.
They wander the world, sick of remorse and despair.
These deadly sins occur in a translucent universe.
The menacing shadows from an immemorial past are haunting each one of us.
