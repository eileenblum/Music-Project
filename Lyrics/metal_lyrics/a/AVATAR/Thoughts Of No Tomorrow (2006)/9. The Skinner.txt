You look so different
When you're dead and gone
And when you're dead and gone
I'm alone

(I) To hold you
To feel you
(Feel) Be with you
Inside of you
(Your) Never felt this alive (pain)
(We) I hold you
I am you
(Are) We are one
(The) My blood runs through (same)
Your Veins
The skinner

To smell you was not enough
Just to hear and watch
Just to kiss and touch
Not enough

Skin you to be inside of you
Try to find the beauty within
My feelings are sincere and true
Just for you

Never smile, never cry
Never again
Never smile, never cry
Never again

Do you feel the same? (can you feel the pain?)

SKIN HER!!!
