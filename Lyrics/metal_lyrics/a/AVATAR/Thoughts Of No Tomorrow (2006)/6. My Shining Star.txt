Bastard
You little creep
Time after time
You prove that you're blind
Listen
Don't try to think
Shut the fuck up
I want you to stop

Open your mind for my heart to enter
Embrace the wind
Don't fear the light
Open the gate - The battle can start
Embrace my sin
Or get out of my sight

You will kneel before it
My shining star
Won't it mean shit?

Force fed
With your commands
You nag and you nag
You'll kneel and you'll beg
Please don't
Just listen to me
Hear what I say
This is the way

Open your mind for my heart to enter
Embrace the wind
Don't fear the light
Open the gate - The battle can start
Embrace my sin
Or get out of my sight

No more
I'll bite the hand
Enough is enough This got to stop
It's over
I am my own
No longer your slave
Free to walk away
