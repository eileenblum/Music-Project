Do they dream?
These machines have eyes
I'm floating! I'm failing! I'm controlled!
A new way to fade away
Rebuilt and falling apart
Failure, frustration
Fading suns burn out

I'm asleep in a stream of consciousness
Mourning the broken rays of a sun
That I've tried to reach since day one

It's just a vanishing dream
Between the ports of sorrow
And the gates of hell
Am I alone in here?
Inside its program:
Suffocate the last ones
Who look at the stars

I try to hide in a safe place
Away from their faces
Eyes watching me
Alive to die for what's greater
Plastic creator
My river runs free

Beneath my feet: Bodies
Make up the gear wheels
That keeps me alive
Choked on the shit that they feed me
And as they kill me
I'll die with a smile

Fuck!
Weren't we supposed to dream?
Then why is all I see these shadowns?
Just fucking shadows!
Imprisoned within imaginary walls
Built with lies and false promises
For the sheep that follow
Who am I?
A peasant given life to choke in this lie
All these borders and lines you've drawn in my mind
Am I really alive?

I'm asleep in a stream of consciousness
Mourning the broken rays of a sun
That I've tried to reach since day one

I'm playing their game
Just punishing myself
For trying to stay alive
Access denied
I'm not the only one inside my mind
My price tag is my birthright
For their profit they force me to fight
