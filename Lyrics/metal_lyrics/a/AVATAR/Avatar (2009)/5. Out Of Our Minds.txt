Is there anyway we could go faster
I have to get away, have to claim my chasm

All gone
We took a road heading for the dark now
All gone
And this road brought us all apart

We drive... Turn right
Out of our minds
We're out of our minds

No time... Shout out
Out of our minds
We're out of our minds

It was the game we played
The game became our virtue
We wanted to escape
We never meant to hurt you
