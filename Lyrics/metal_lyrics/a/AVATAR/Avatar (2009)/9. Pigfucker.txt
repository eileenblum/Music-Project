(jag ska bara spotta ut snusen)

You poor excuse for a man
Fucking maggot in my eye you are cancer
You're fucking pathetic
Thief, motherfucker, coward
Asshole

How can you live with yourself?
Fuck!
What are you doing here
You're in my head

You're in every inch of me
Every bleeding wound is your doing
This corpse will not rest
I'll find you motherfucker

And then you'll / she'll / I'll die

A whore bred by you hands
Too fucking scared to walk to your grave 'cause she knows she'll find me
there
I'll find her, motherfucker

I'll stab you like a pig
Pigfucker

I puke blood and I stand
By the fallen I never forgot
I will avenge every single life you've destroyed
