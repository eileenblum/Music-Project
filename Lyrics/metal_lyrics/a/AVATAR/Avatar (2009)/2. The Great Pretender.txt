Time to thrill, there's time to kill
'Til your mom's gone away
She don't want us to play

Get your cuffs, we'll be cops
I'll be good, you have been bad
You're the best that I've had

Naughty girls and naughty boys
Made the best of noise
They are best as toys

They enjoy, and they destroy
Everything they cross and they are coming for us

Let them come
Oh let them take us down, so I can be someone
You will remember

Let them come, oh let them take us down
So I can be the one
The Great Pretender

The nights are dark, the days are black
But we are not alone, we are a part of the show
They like to watch, they like to touch
Tickle private parts, they are my work of art

Always broke and in debt
Never miss anything I can steal
Wet and soaked, a living dead
Scratch a wound that I don't want to heal

Let them come
Oh let them take us down, so I can be someone
You will remember
Let them come, oh let them take us down
So I can be the one
The Great Pretender

Let them come
Oh let them take us down, so I can be someone
You will remember
Let them come, oh let them take us down
So I can be the one
The Great Pretender
