We're heading for failure
We're all gonna die
It's the code of the roadkill

It's the call of the night
Our force is stronger than ever
And the flames grow higher now

And there's no way to make us stop, NO!
We're going down

Crawl through Gehenna
It is crossing our path
Some will be crushed and some will still stand

Whatever the cost we'll deliver
And we'll all be remembered forever

Raise your glass for all the roadkills on the side of the road
Our brothers who died by death 'n' roll
In the end we all will be roadkills out in the cold
Sister, you wen and sold your soul

May God show mercy on your soul

We're in for the pleasure
We're in for the ride
It's the way of the living

It's the way we will die
Our anger is stronger than ever
And our bounds are tighter now

And there's no time to get away, NO!
We'll take this town
