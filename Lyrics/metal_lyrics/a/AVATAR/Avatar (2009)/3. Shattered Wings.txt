There's something in your eyes
I saw it grow, you walked away
Someone's gonna pay...
Don't care if people die
You wouldn't stop to save a life
Let them die away
They die away

You're frozen
Parted in two
Please don't let go

Save me catch me please
Shattered wings will let you down
Someone's calling can't you hear?
Something's burning when you're near

"Oh could it be?" you ask
Could you have been somebody else?
Who were you meant to be?
They shaped you, now they're scared
The pain is back where it belongs
Scars won't go away
Won't go away

You're frozen
Parted in two
Please don't let go

Save me catch me please
Shattered wings will let you down
Someone's calling can't you hear?
Something's burning when you're near
