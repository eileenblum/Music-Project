She came with the spring
As birds start to sing
The queen of the fairies dance
I joined I took the chance

Now bittersweet memories
So bittersweet

A lover's dream like a star in the sky
To pass away like a sweet Lullaby
Tell me why did the fire die

Tell me why
Like a star in the sky
A soothing breeze like a sweet lullaby
A lover's cry
Farewell...
Goodbye...

With leaves came the end
The fall of a friend
Tied to the wheel of time
The fairies came to die

A lover's dream like a star in the sky
To pass away like a sweet Lullaby
Tell me why did the fire die

Tell me why
Like a star in the sky
A soothing breeze like a sweet lullaby
A lover's cry
Farewell...
Goodbye...

There's no such a thing as forever
There's nothing we haven't invented

We're all meant to die, just remember
No one will hear

No gods will hear
No gods, no fear

No gods will hear
No gods, no fear
Will hear
No fear

Your soul is a lie
Your suit is a lie
Your mind is a lie
Your money - a lie

Your car is a lie
Your love is a lie
Your job is a lie
Your body - a lie

No gods will hear
No gods, no fear

No gods will hear
No gods, no fear

We're gods of the inside
There's nothing not inside
We are connected
I'll stay in the lie

A lover's dream like a star in the sky
To pass away like a sweet Lullaby
Tell me why did the fire die

Tell me why
Like a star in the sky
A soothing breeze like a sweet lullaby
A lover's cry
Farewell...
Goodbye...
