Look at you (you, you)
Is it true
Are you here on your own (on your own, on your own)

I've waited (and waited, and waited, and waited)
It's true - Down with the king
Fight, come and claim your throne, be the star of the show

Their envy can't hurt us
We're fast and they're dead
They're stuck marching
The march of the dead will go on

Oh remember me
Remember me
Remember me, yeah!
They'll die
Die by hands of heroes
We'll live a revolution of two

Look at me (me, me)
So obscene
I was once like you
I was scared just like you

They caught me, they tried to obtaim me - They failed
Now I'm running - Running straight in to their core
Let's declare war them war - Give them something to live for

On land and on water we'll win in the air
We're outnumbered
But we've got the bombs
We won't hide
Try... You can try

Bring it on
Never in their hands
Never by their laws
We're taking back control

Come on
Never in their hands
Never in their laws
We're taking back control

Just like snow (snow, snow )
Melts away and fades in our heat
They will fall by our feet

They'll beg us for mercy but mercy won't show
They will perish
We punish where punishments due

And by the next day you'll hear them walk away
We beat them but we could not save them
They're lost

They're still marching
The march of the dead will go on
