Hear them marching
But not under roof of law
We fall in line and
We march as one
I answer God
The God of war
And by the night I was ready

Now we're breathing, we breathe as one
We don't speak but,
We share a thought
We share a hunger
We share a hate
And in the end, we will share death

So far we travel through your nightmares
The Swarm will live and die for her
The Queen Of Blades

Now we see her
The wings that carry us
The hand that pulled us
Out of our sleep
She is the answer
She is the call
She is the scent we'll follow
Getting stronger
With scent between the stars,
This human fear, oh rotting stink
She knows their kind
She knows their path
And on this path is our victory

So far we travel through your nightmares
The Swarm will live and die for her
The Queen Of Blades

Hear us marching
So many hooves and claws
We fall in line and
We march as one
We answer God
The God of war
And by the night we were ready

Call on the stars
The swarm has been reborn
One million roars risen
But it hurts
No machine
Oh no machine
No machine left by sundown

So far we travel through your nightmares
The Swarm will live and die for her
The Queen Of Blades
