Look at how they've used you
Well they could only push you so far
Their words are drilling through you
But you're seeing light through the scars

Girl you'll go far

Engines on
We're heading out of here
Hell's lost son
Will take you in his care

Reload
Don't close your eyes
We'll shoot our way out

Reload
Don't close your eyes
Go dynamite

The cops are looking for you
And they will come for me too, don't hide
I need you now, so stay cool

We have to go, we'll break through, we ride
