[Owl and Eagle:]
Blessed is this final hour
Devour is my soul
I foretold the arrival
Arise from the hole

[Wolf:]
Hear what I am saying
The Eagle brings the day
Watch them as they're praying
Pray the sun away

[Owl and Eagle:]
Burn the emerald towers
The cowards and thorns
I stand my conviction
I leave this earth scorn

[Wolf:]
Hear what I am saying
The Eagle brings the day
Watch them as they're praying
Pray the sun away

[Bear:]
As I go to the river to drink
I learn that your tears all taste exactly the same

[Wolf:]
Hear what I am saying
The Eagle brings the day
Watch them as they're praying
Pray the sun away

Hear what I am saying
The Eagle brings the day
Watch them as they're praying
Pray the sun away
