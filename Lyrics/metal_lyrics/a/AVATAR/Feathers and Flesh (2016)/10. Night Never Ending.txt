[Wolf:]
Pathetic, ridiculous
Your quest for the grail has brought you nothing
Nothing to show you were here
...We're not here...

If you give up
Your bloodline will fail
You fought for nothing
Nothing can hurt you but fear

...Do not fear...
Do not fear

Night never ending
The weapons we bring are our souls
You know! You know!
You know what it means to feel real
So rise up claim the sky
We fight! We fight!
Night never ending

Night never ending
The weapons we bring are our souls
You know! You know!
You know what it means to feel real
So rise up claim the sky
We fight! We fight!
Night never ending

Night never ending
The weapons we bring are our souls
You know! You know!
You know what it means to feel real
So rise up claim the sky
We fight! We fight!
Night never ending
