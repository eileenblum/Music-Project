[Pike]
I'm gonna pull you down
I'll take you where it hurts
I'm going to wear the crown of the king of tainted unnatural birth
And the sun has failed
It doesn't reach my sky
Every ship that sailed through the void of the surface I swore to survive

I'll never die
Never die

Drown your sorrows in black waters
I'm waiting
Waiting forevermore
All in vain
Nobody came
Drown your sorrows in black waters
I'm waiting
Waiting forevermore
All in vain
Nobody came

I've fed on you before
And I will feed again
You never knew yourself like I did, girl I tell you, I am your friend
We'll leave the world alone
Two stories underground
I'll never leave this vicious, delicious, precious treasure I've found

Are you afraid to die?
Never die

Drown your sorrows in black waters
I'm waiting
Waiting forevermore
All in vain
Nobody came
Drown your sorrows in black waters
I'm waiting
Waiting forevermore
All in vain
Nobody came

I tell you who I am
You tell me where it hurts
You can rest assured that your kind was never meant for this world

Drown your sorrows in black waters
I'm waiting
Waiting forevermore
All in vain
Nobody came
Drown your sorrows in black waters
I'm waiting
Waiting forevermore
All in vain
Nobody came
