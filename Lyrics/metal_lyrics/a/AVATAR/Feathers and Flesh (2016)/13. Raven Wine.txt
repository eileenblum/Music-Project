[The Ravens:]
Resistance is futile
We know you're alone
Weak like a small child
We're taking you home
You've got our attention
You can't flee - you're too slow
We'll call this redemption
A toast to all we have known

In their eyes
It's in the eyes
Sweet taste of dying misery (hey)
Going blind
I'm going blind
I'm so high, so high, so high
In their eyes
It's in their eyes
These 99 dead barrels of skin
Going blind
I'm going blind
So high, so high, so high

It's all in the details
The lives they have lived
The taste of delusion
I must admit
I've got putrid perversions
Embracing them all
Dead tiny soldiers
Their final downfall

In their eyes
It's in the eyes
Sweet taste of dying misery (hey)
Going blind
I'm going blind
I'm so high, so high, so high
In their eyes
It's in their eyes
These 99 dead barrels of skin
Going blind
I'm going blind
So high, so high, so high

Resistance is futile
I must have you now
To taste the illusion
Of a life of my own
Do I got your attention?

Down the throat
Out of my mind
Anything to feel alive
Living like I was alive
Down the throat
Out of my mind
99 skin barrels served warm
Ready for the taking
Ready for the taking
Raven wine
Sweet raven wine
