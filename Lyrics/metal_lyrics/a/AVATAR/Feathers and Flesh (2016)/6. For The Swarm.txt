[Bees]
Gotta, gotta work! Work! Work! Work! Gotta work!
Gotta, gotta work! Work! Work! Work! Gotta work!
Gotta, gotta work! Work! Work! Work! Gotta work!
Busy, busy,
There's so much to do here
Gotta, gotta work! Work! Work! Work! Gotta work!
Gotta, gotta work! Work! Work! Work! Gotta work!
Gotta, gotta work! Work! Work! Work! Gotta work!
I must fly!

So the day begins
All assigned a role
For the greater good
Thousand eyes don't see themselves

Gotta, gotta work! Work! Work! Work! Gotta work!
Gotta, gotta work! Work! Work! Work! Gotta work!
Gotta, gotta work! Work! Work! Work! Gotta work!
Busy, busy,
There's so much to do here
Gotta, gotta work! Work! Work! Work! Gotta work!
Gotta, gotta work! Work! Work! Work! Gotta work!
Gotta, gotta work! Work! Work! Work! Gotta work!
I must fly!

So the day begins
All assigned a role
For the greater good
For the sisterhood

So the day begins
All assigned a role
For the greater good
A thousand voices

For the swarm
For the swarm
For the swarm
For the swarm
