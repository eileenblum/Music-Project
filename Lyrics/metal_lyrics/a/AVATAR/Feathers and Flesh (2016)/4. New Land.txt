[Owl:]
A new world awaits
I'm flying without an escape plan
Break through the gate
Take off, take me on
Break through the sky
I will save you

I woke up too late
Danger ahead and behind us
Become and create
Here comes the dawn,
Crossing the canyon

Fly beyond the oceans
Trying to find a place
Home is somewhere out there
Somewhere you'll be safe
Sleep my child and dream of the new land

You won't be alone
Remember, you've all got each other
Crack through the stone
There's silver inside
We'll all be alright

Fly beyond the oceans
Trying to find a place
Home is somewhere out there
Somewhere you'll be safe
Sleep my child and dream of the new land

New born,
Promise
Soon we'll be departed
Sleep until we reach the new land

[The Winds:]
(New world awaits
Don't be afraid
Sleep until we reach the new land)

[Owl:]
Fly beyond the oceans
Trying to find a place
Home is somewhere out there
Somewhere you'll be safe

Fly beyond the oceans
Trying to find a place
Home is somewhere out there
Somewhere you'll be safe
Sleep my child and dream of the new land
