[Grasshopper:]
I sing one last song
By your tombstone
I pay my respects
Alone
Dream, fiddle dream
The leaves they are falling
I'll face old king frost
Alone

There goes the summer
There goes the summer
There goes the summer
I'm so cold
I never thought we'd end it like this

Sheltered from snow
I watch as you slumber
Breathless and deep
Alone
Songs play no more
My fiddle is silent now
I carry on
Alone

There goes the summer
There goes the summer
There goes the summer
I'm so cold
I never thought we'd end it like this

If I had one chance to go back
If I had one chance to go back
I wish that I could get you back
I wish I had
I wish I had

There goes the summer
There goes the summer
There goes the summer
I'm so cold
I never thought we'd end it like this
