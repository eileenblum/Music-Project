[Owl:]
Never had a dream this lonely
Where did everybody go?
Never had a dream this dark
Wake me up! Please make it so!
Never had a broken spirit
I can not let this world go
Never had a broken wing
How do I fly? I do not know!

Lay feathered limbs upon the stones
My severed wings, my broken bones
I flew through fire and darkness cold
Here my tale ends - all has been told

Given to the wind
Sky burial

I give the night my final breath
For far too long I've been stalling death
I search beneath me, extend my claws
Step out of time, unbound be laws

Given to the wind
Sky burial
