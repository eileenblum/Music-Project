[Eagle:]
Cut through the clouds with the speed of a demon
I am as I was as I will be
Lord of this world - can you hear me? I'm screaming!
God above all things beneath me

Oh! Ah ha ha ha!
What a sensation
What a sensation
Can you feel it?
Can you see what I see?
I'm drowning the light
The light

Ladies and gentlemen
Your hero has returned again
Everything is going to be OK
Ladies and gentlemen
Your shepherd and your very best friend
Bow your heads
The man is here to stay

[Owl:]
Pitiful one, you speak without seeing
Intruder, you came uninvited
The hunt has begun and soon you'll be bleeding
Stare at the night sky, ignited

[Eagle:]
Oh! Ah ha ha ha!
What a sensation
What a sensation
Can you feel it?
Can you see what I see?
I'm drowning the light
The light

Ladies and gentlemen
Your hero has returned again
Everything is going to be OK
Ladies and gentlemen
Your shepherd and your very best friend
Bow your heads
The man is here to stay

Ladies and gentlemen
Your hero has returned again
Everything is going to be OK
Ladies and gentlemen
Your shepherd and your very best friend
Bow your heads
The man is here to stay
