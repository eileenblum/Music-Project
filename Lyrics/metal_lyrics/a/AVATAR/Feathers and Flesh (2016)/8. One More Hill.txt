[The Eyes:]
Every path will lead to war
It's carved in stone, our fate is sealed
Promise that we'll meet again
Just make it 'cross the battle field
Everybody bleeds the same
In pitch black darkness, who can tell?
Moving on through the madness
We buried our brothers where they fell

Every path will lead to war
It's carved in stone, our fate is sealed
Promise that we'll meet again
Just make it 'cross the battle field
Everybody bleeds the same
In pitch black darkness, who can tell?
Moving on through the madness
We buried our brothers where they fell

A name
A name
A name
I'd give my soul for a name
Something
Something
Something
Let feel like there's something for me

Just one more hill to climb
Just one last song of glory
You said that we could fight the dawn
Where can we go?
Where can we go?
Where can we go from here but down?
You've cursed us all

Every step a greater lie
And every night the same old dream
Swallowed in a wave of flesh
And nobody can hear me scream
Everybody turn in shame
Don't want to see the house we've built
Peel our skin and stab our eyes
It's all it takes to hide our guilt

A name
A name
A name
I'd give my soul for a name
Something
Something
Something
Let feel like there's something for me

Just one more hill to climb
Just one last song of glory
You said that we could fight the dawn
Where can we go?
Where can we go?
Where can we go from here but down?
You've cursed us all

Just one more hill to climb
Just one last song of glory
You said that we could fight the dawn
Where can we go?
Where can we go?
Where can we go from here but down?
You've cursed us all
