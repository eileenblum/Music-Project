[Owl:]
They said that nothing could hurt you
You were never afraid
Voices would echo
Chanting your name
You were invincible
Earthquake and thunder
Stopped at the wonder
Bent at your will
You used to run over tundras,
In hale storm and rain
The night was your ally
Night was your name
You were one with her
Couldn't tell you apart
The flames in your heart
Lit up the path

Close your eyes
We'll hunt another day
I will remember you
When the snow lies red

Your songs will be sung forever
As long as there's life
You'll be remembered
Untouched by the light
I will be no more
All things will perish
Voices diminish
But yours will be heard
Step out of this darkness
This world falls apart
The spirits await you
Arise to the stars
I will follow you
I'm not far behind
It's finally time
Light up the path

Close your eyes
We'll hunt another day
I will remember you
When the snow lies red

They said that nothing could hurt you
You were never afraid
Voices would echo
Chanting your name
You were invincible
Earthquake and thunder
Stopped at the wonder
Bent at your will
You used to run over tundras,
In hale storm and rain
The night was your ally
Night was your name
You were one with her
Couldn't tell you apart
The flames in your heart
Lit up the path

Close your eyes
We'll hunt another day
For every day there's a night
For every night there's a song
And every song they have sung was meant for you
It didn't matter to you
The way it mattered to me
I won't let them forget

I will remember you
When the snow lies red
