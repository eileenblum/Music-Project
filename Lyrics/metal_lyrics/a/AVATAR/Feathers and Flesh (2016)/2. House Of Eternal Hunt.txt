[Owl:]
I'm reborn
Ruthless and just,
I soar
The sky is my throne
The gates,
To the predator realm,
Awaits
Sworn to the moon,
And the storm
Silent shadow
High upon the throne

Don't care if you're ready
I'll take what is mine

Sworn to the starlight
Tonight is the night
Call from the wild - I can feel it
Endless horizon
No sun in sight
House of eternal hunt

It's my time
My darkness, my might,
Divine
It has been foretold
This land,
Will live and die by my hand
Child to the moon,
And the storm
Silent shadow growing
I'm reborn

Don't care if you're ready
I'll take what is mine

Sworn to the starlight
Tonight is the night
Call from the wild - I can feel it
Endless horizon
No sun in sight
House of eternal hunt

I take one last look,
At the emerald towers
The end has come
Please, hunt with me one last time
The emerald towers,
Are swallowed by the sun

Don't care if you're ready
I'll take what is mine

Sworn to the starlight
Tonight is the night
Call from the wild - I can feel it
Endless horizon
No sun in sight
House of eternal hunt
