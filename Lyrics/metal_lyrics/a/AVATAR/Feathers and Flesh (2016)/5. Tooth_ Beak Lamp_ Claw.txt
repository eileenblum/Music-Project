[The Eyes:]
This little beast,
Went out in the world
Found out he had brothers
Was finally heard
This little beast,
Was Nature's own error
Grew like a tree
Born to spread terror

This little beast,
Went out in the world
Found out he had brothers
Was finally heard
This little beast,
Was Nature's own error
Grew like a tree
Born to spread terror

For every speck of light,
In a clouded mind,
Shines an eye in the forest,
Watching and waiting
As soon as you sleep we come out
You've got your time
We have our patience
In the end you're outnumbered
We all can see you,
And deep down you know we're right here

Eyes open wide
Open your mind
We can take him
We can take him
We can take him
We can take him
We can take him
We can take him
With tooth, beak and...

Claw our way through,
Feathers and flesh
We have to fight our last breath
Nothing can hurt those,
Who never were taught how to die
Take in the scent
Smell of the wild land
We awoke to defend it
You will not hear us,
And once you can see, it's too late

Eyes open wide
Open your mind
We can take him
We can take him
We can take him
We can take him
We can take him
We can take him
With tooth, beak and...

This little beast,
Went out in the world
Found out he had brothers
Was finally heard
This little beast,
Was Nature's own error
Grew like a tree
Born to spread terror

This little freak,
Went out in the world
He also found sisters
A world full of hurt
This little freak,
Was Nature's own error
Grew like a tree
Born to spread terror

Eyes open wide
Open your mind
We can take him
We can take him
We can take him
We can take him
We can take him
We can take him
With tooth, beak...

...And claw
