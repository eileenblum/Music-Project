A stranger rode into town
He rambled something 'bout a crown
He said, "Please pour me a drink
I need a second to think
It's just this thing that I feel
There ain't no chance that it's real
Can't be real, no
I saw a tower of gold
A new dimension unfold
And now I fear for my soul."
Well son, it's already sold

There's danger in having fun
We'll take it - let it be done
Just do what you want to do
This town has room for you too
Lay down, embracing the earth
This is your final rebirth
Final rebirth
The sky falls right in my face
The mountains rise up like waves
This sweet unnatural landscape
This is my final escape
