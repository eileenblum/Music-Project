The last spoken will of a warrior King:
"Bury me next to my soldiers
Set my horse free and let people sing
Of their son with the world on his shoulders
Then look to the mountains
I left my grave wide open."
Eyes fixed on the mountains
"I was buried at dusk, at dawn I return."

Here it comes
Death undone
King after King

From this tomb we shall build you a throne
In your name we shall sing
Light your torch, let the flames lead you home
Long live the King!

The heart of a King can be measured in dreams
Reaching the sleep of his people
A whisper of ghosts saying we'll be redeemed
From our sins he will build us a castle
One day we'll be stronger
We will ride right beside you
Until we are stronger
We put stone upon stone, await your return

From this tomb we shall build you a throne
In your name we shall sing
Light your torch, let the flames lead you home
Long live the King!

The longing for sun and a heartache undone
Breaking the back of false idols
Bring our King home, for among us are none
Who is worthy to be his disciple
Out there in the wasteland
There's something coming for us
A call from the wasteland:
He was buried at dusk, at dawn he returns

Here it comes
Death undone
King after King

From this tomb we shall build you a throne
In your name we shall sing
Light your torch, let the flames lead you home
Long live the King!
