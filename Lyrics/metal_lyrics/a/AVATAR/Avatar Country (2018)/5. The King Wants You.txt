A train in the distance
I hear the whistle
A lonely tune calling,
Telling where the wind is blowing

At the station
An army's waiting
Spend my whole life not growing
Now the whole world is coming

I don't know why we're fighting
I just know that I'm going

A chip on my shoulder
Everyone's getting older
Heroes die young this fight
I'm still a child inside

You are a soldier now
The wind will blow this bitch right up
They cannot drag us down
The crowning heads will keep our fortress strong

The best of the greatest
The greatest but few
The soon-to-be heroes
The king wants you

The king wants you

Sixteen years, my mother's son
A big boy wielding guns
Marching, falling, getting up
Never knew how to stop

Wrote a letter
Said things are better
Taught me how to fight a guy
I wish I knew how to live and lie

I don't know where we're going
It's better to go without knowing

I'm ready and willing
Literally make a killing
It's a game
It's all the same
As long as someone knows my name

You are a soldier now
The wind will blow this bitch right up
They cannot drag us down
The crowning heads will keep our fortress strong

The best of the greatest
The greatest but few
The soon-to-be heroes
The king wants you

The king wants you

Left
Right, left
Left
Right, left
Look at the king
All eyes on the king
All hail the king

The best of the greatest
The greatest but few
The soon-to-be heroes
The king wants you

The king wants you
