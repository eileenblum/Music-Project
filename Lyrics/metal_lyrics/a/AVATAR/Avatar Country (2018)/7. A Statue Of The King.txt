On this glorious day we're all citizens
By all your warrior's names we swear diligence
Lay the first stone we lay at your feet
All the world trembles, begs and flees

Everybody wants one
Everybody needs one
Everybody heard the word, it's a sign
Well, no one else can make one
If you're the one to take one
But I know that you know
You know, that I don't lie

Everybody wants one
Everybody needs one
But they don't grab a stone, the rocks, the box
So they can own your sword
But we don't wanna share one
We have worked so hard, so hard, alone

Harder than steel is my king's will

Emissaries, dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen
My beloved citizens
It is time to ignite the mighty flame
Of the royal beacon
And then unveil the statue of our ruler
We celebrate, we built
A statue of the king

Bigger than the last one
Bigger than the best one
Bigger than the tracks we drag to these trains
There's nothing to compare to
No one can prepare you
But I know that you know
You know, that I don't lie

Stronger than the last one
Bigger than the best one
Make it from the stone and rocks and moss
So you can try to make one
Cause we ain't gonna show one
We all worked so hard, so hard, so hard

Emissaries, dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen
My beloved citizens
It is time to ignite the mighty flame
Of the royal beacon
And then unveil the statue of our ruler
We celebrate, we built
A statue of the king

Harder than steel is my king's will

Emissaries, dignitaries, ladies and gentlemen
My beloved citizens
It is time to ignite the mighty flame
Of the royal beacon
And then unveil the statue of our ruler
We celebrate, we built
A statue of the king
