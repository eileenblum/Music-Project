From the innermost sanctum
Of the secret halls
A drum is pounding
Calling you home
Call upon all who've heard his voice

Come and see the spectacle
A sight you won't believe
Chaos in the cosmos
This is your destiny
To the stars, we take off
Reach out and touch the night
Soldiers forged in metal
My king, I've seen the light
Engines set to battle
Let's go, I'm not afraid
Come to me, destruction
And come whatever way
I have roamed the planet
But I shall search no more
Raise the flag in victory
What are you waiting for?

From eons long forgotten
Until the end of all
Unborn, undead, eternal
Upon his throne

Spread your wings of flames and sorrow
Time to rise for our tale has just begun
Take this land as your loved one
You were born a legend

Fear of life takes hold of you
Let go and come with me
I have heard his promise
And what you need to be
Lord beyond the darkness
Uncovering your third eye
Forging righteous weaponry
We'll fight, live free, and die

From eons long forgotten
Until the end of all
Unborn, undead, eternal
Upon his throne

Spread your wings of flames and sorrow
Time to rise for our tale has just begun
Take this land as your loved one
You were born a legend

Spread your wings of flames and sorrow
Time to rise for our tale has just begun
Take this land as your loved one
You are born again

Brother, take your given share
There are no strangers here
Celebrate your rebirth
Ignite the atmosphere
Kneel and swear on your soul
Allegiance to the crown
Stand up knighted by his sword
The secret drum still pounds

Spread your wings of flames and sorrow
Time to rise for our tale has just begun
Take this land as your loved one
You were born a legend
Legend
