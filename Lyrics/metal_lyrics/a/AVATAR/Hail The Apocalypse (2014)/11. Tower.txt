You look like you need a friend
Let me in and we'll pretend
Light some candles, do not cry
I'll sing you a lullaby
You lost your key and cannot leave
I'll play with you and make believe
I'll keep you safe with all my power
I will build you a tower
In every stone I'll carve your name
Nothing will be quite the same
Laughter at the midnight hour
In our own little tower
Ashes paint our bedroom gray
They shall be our finest days
As I pledge my precious flower
Keep you safe in a tower

Stay inside and dream of towers
Wake up all alone, welcome home
All alone you count the hours
Right where you belong, welcome home

Don't be scared, you won't be hurt
I promise that I'll keep my word
Just behave and we can play
Just do everything I say
Do not speak and do not think
I will give you everything
Everything within my power
I will bring to your tower

Stay inside and dream of towers
Wake up all alone, welcome home
All alone you count the hours
Right where you belong, welcome home

Oh oh oh ee ooh
Oh oh oh ee ooh
Oh oh oh ee ooh oh oh, ooho [2x]

See hope on the horizon
What you where will fade away
Every day of every season
Is devoured by the gray

Stay inside and dream of towers
Wake up all alone, welcome home
All alone you count the hours
Right where you belong, welcome home
