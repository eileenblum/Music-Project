How can I sleep?
When everyone else turns to dust
How can I breathe?
When my mouth is filled with their ashes

Another day lost,
Trying to exit the program
I've seen enough to feed
A psychosis for a lifetime!

My angel!

When did it start?
This force is too strong to resist
Where is too far?
All I did was try to save them

Haunted by screams,
Chasing me back to my childhood
I cannot free,
I've got tormentors for a lifetime!

Come, bloody angel,
Break of your chains,
And look what I found in the dirt
Pale battered body,
Seems she was struggling
Something is wrong with this world

Yeah!
Bloody angel!

All that I know
I'm willing to give it away
All that I love
Disappear like sand in ocean

Remember the lives,
Lost with their withering pages
Trying to hide,
But I see tragedies for a lifetime!

Bloody angel!

Come, bloody angel,
Break off your chains
And look what I've found in the dirt
Pale battered body,
Seems she was struggling,
Something is wrong with this world

Fierce, bloody angel
The blood is on your hands
Why did you come to this world?

Everybody turns toâ
Everybody turns to dust,
Everybody turns toâ
Everybody turns to dust...

The blood is on your hands,
The blood is on your hands.
The blood is on your hands!
The blood is on your hands!

Come, bloody angel,
Break off your chains,
And look what I found in the dirt
Pale battered body,
Seems she was struggling
Something is wrong with this world

Yeah!
Bloody angel!
Bloody angel!
