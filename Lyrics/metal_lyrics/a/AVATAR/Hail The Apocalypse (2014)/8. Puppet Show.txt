Puppet king, oh puppet king
When you sleep do you dream of control?
Everything, run by strings
Your shadow has a voice of its own

Puppet king, oh puppet king
Have your subjects found out that you're dead?
Whispers sing in the wind
The puppet mob has come for your head

Puppet show
Puppet show

Puppet king, oh puppet king
The end is near
The curtains comes down
Hear them sing, dance and drink
A puppet king without a puppet crown

Puppet show
Puppet show

All the children sing
Of a crownless king
When the children sing
Then you will know... the puppet show

Puppet show
Puppet show
