[originally by Nirvana]Underneath the bridge
The tarp has sprung a leak
And the animals I've trapped
Have all become my pets
And I'm living off of grass
And the drippings from the ceiling
It's okay to eat fish
'Cause they don't have any feelings

Something in the way...mmmh
Something in the way, yeah...mmmh
Something in the way...mmmh
Something in the way, oh...mmmh
