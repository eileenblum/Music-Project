Get in line with the plans
Deconstruct
Reassemble
Drill a hole in your head
Say hello to the future
Reproduce
Reconnect
Realize nothing changes
You are part of a piece of a fucking machine

Get in line
Get in line
Get in line

Say your prayers
Speak the truth
Lie and suffer in silence
Sell you soul to the screen on the altar of progress
Scan the earth
Print the sky
Draw a map of the circuits
See your part in the scheme of the fucking machine

Show your face
Hide your scars
Be the pride of your nation
Take a gun
Shoot a load
Join the army of puppets
be in time
Stay online
Stay in tune with the noises
Hear the voices that scream in the fucking machine

Get in line
Get a life

God among machines
