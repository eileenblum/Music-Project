We Were Supposed To
Take On The World
But Every Day
Pulled Us Further...
We've Gotten Used To
Live In A World
That Doesnt Want Us Around

Torn Apart...

We have Outrun You
So Many Times
But Every Fight Takes
Another...
Been Looking Through You
Time After Time
We have Seen Through
All Your Life

ARE WE 
MORE THAN JUST A PART?
ARE WE
LOST RIGHT FROM THE START?
JUST TELL ME...
