I Entered The House
On The Hill One Day
Trying My Beest Just To Get Away
No One Was Home
But The Voices Were Clear
They Let Me Know
I Was Welcome Here

LIFE IS SO WONDERFUL
LIFE IS SO BEAUTIFUL,
STAY A WILE
NO ONE GETS OUT ALIVE
LIFE IS SO WONDERFUL
LIFE IS SO BEAUTIFUL,
JUST SMILE
NO ONE GETS OUT ALIVE

I Walked Down The Halls
Of That Haunted Place
A Whisper Was Leading Me
Through The Maze
Promising Warmth
Knowing My Name
Knowing My Reasons
And Why I Came

A Face In A Painting
Looked Down On Me
Smiled At Me Loving And Tenderly
Reached Out Her Hand
Stroking My Hair 
Suddenly Voices Were Everywhere
