[iTunes Bonus Track]I've been waiting a lifetime for this
And I will stop for nothing
I have overcome bigger obstacles than you
This is a one lifetime chance
And I, I'm out to get it
The table turns, the rules have changed
I'm your king, you are my slave!

Dying to see you dead
I'm dying to see you dead

Choosing you for my vengeance
And this is a perfect position
I am letting go, gonna change to stay alive
Take a look at the lyrics
Writing a storm through the thunder
And it's me I've broken free
I'm your king, you are my slave!

Dying to see you dead
I'm dying to see you dead
[x2]

No!

Dying to see you dead
I'm dying to see you dead
[x3]
