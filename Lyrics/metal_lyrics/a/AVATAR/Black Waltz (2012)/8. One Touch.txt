A New Nightmare
Is Born And Nurtured
To Each A Hell Of HIs Own
A New ORder
It Pulls Us Under
Why Are You Turning So Cold?
No One, Nowwhere
Theres Nothing Out THere
To Each Some Pain Of His Own
Cant Remember
How Did I Get Here?
Why Am I TUrning So COlt?

ONE TOUCH...
ITS SO COLD AND SILENT
WHY CANT I STOP FROM FALLING?

In Closed Quarters
We'll Spend Our Future
An Apocalypse Of Our Own
Its All Empty
Theres Nothing Left Here
Why Are We Turning So Cold?
