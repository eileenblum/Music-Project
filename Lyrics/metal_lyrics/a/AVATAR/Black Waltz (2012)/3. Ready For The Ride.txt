You can say what you want, I know what I am doing
I don't want us to be gone
No time to make escape you will soon be
Out of the shadows ready to face
You can say what you want, I know I'll make it better
I know what you want me to do
I want to fight but I'll never be a quitter
You cannot break me
I will not take it

There is but one way to do this
Ready for the ride

You can take what you want, for every time I loose it
I don't want us to be one
How come we make it up and not bring it
I work like an anchor at your dispense
You can take what you want, I know I don't deserve it 
Running away from my turn
Rebels ascend if you tell me I will steal it
No one can change me
I want to break it

There is but one way to do this
Ready for the ride

There is but one way to do this
Ready for the ride
There is but one
