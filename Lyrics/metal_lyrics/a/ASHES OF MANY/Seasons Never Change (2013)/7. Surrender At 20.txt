A FIGHT IS FAR FROM OVER
IN A WAR THAT NEVER STOPS.
EACH VICTORY REMINDS US
OF THE BATTLES THAT WEâVE LOST.
OUR HANDS BEGIN TO BLISTER,
OUR EYES ARE GETTING TIRED.
WEâRE PUSHING FORWARD
WITH THE ENEMY NEXUS IN SIGHT.
INSTEAD OF TURNING AROUND,
INSTEAD OF GIVING IN.
THIS WAR IS FAR FROM OVER,
THIS WAR IS YET TO BEGIN.
PUSH THEM BACK TO THEIR TOWERS.
WE WONâT SURRENDER.
TO NO ONE.
INSTEAD OF WASTING MY TIME
I REFUSE TO GIVE IN.
IâM TAKING MY PLACE BACK IN LINE.
INSTEAD OF TURNING AROUND,
INSTEAD OF GIVING IN.
THIS WAR IS FAR FROM OVER,
THIS WAR IS YET TO BEGIN.
PUSH THEM BACK TOWARDS THEIR TOWERS.
WE WONâT SURRENDER.
TO NO ONE.
INSTEAD OF WASTING MY TIME
I REFUSE TO GIVE IN.
IâM TAKING MY PLACE BACK IN LINE.
FOR I HAVE BEEN WASTING MY TIME.
IT SEEMS LIKE MY TIME IS NEAR.
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
FOR I HAVE BEEN WASTING.
IT SEEMS LIKE MY TIME IS NEAR.
