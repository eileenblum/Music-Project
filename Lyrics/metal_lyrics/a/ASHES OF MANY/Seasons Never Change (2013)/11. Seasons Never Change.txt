I HAVE THE ANSWER
TO YOUR QUERY OF WHATâS MORE.
IâVE BEEN TROUGH THIS
ONCE BEFORE.
DO YOU DARE TO QUESTION
THE DIVISIONS OF THE YEAR?
WHAT WOULD YOU TRY TO CHANGE
WHEN YOU KNOW
THE DECISION IS YET TO BE MADE?
THESE SEASONS NEVER CHANGE.
FIGHT YOUR FEELINGS
BUT DONâT LET HABITS PROVE YOU WRONG.
YOUâVE BEEN DOWN THERE
FOR FAR TOO LONG.
JUST LIKE YESTERDAY
IâM STILL WAITING FOR TOMORROW,
FOR THE DAY THAT PROVES ME WRONG.
ALTHOUGH TIMES HAVE CHANGED
IâM STILL TRYING
TO REWRITE THE PATH
JUST LIKE YESTERDAY I WAIT
FOR DECISIONS TO BE MADE.
THESE SEASONS NEVER CHANGE.
CHANGE, COME TO ME.
DONâT LET LIARS PROVE YOU WRONG.
YOUâVE BEEN TROUGH HERE
FOR FAR TOO LONG.
CHANGE, COME TO ME.
DONâT LET LIARS PROVE YOU WRONG.
YOUâVE BEEN DOWN HERE
FOR FAR TOO LONG.
THESE SEASONS NEVER CHANGE.
