THIS IS MY LAST DECLARATION.
EVERY SECOND I HOPE
FOR THIS MOMENT TO PASS.
THE LAST COMPLICATION
IS FOR ME TO DECIDE
WHAT TO DO NEXT.
THEY WONâT BE FOLLOWING YOU ANYMORE.
I WILL BE ON MY WAY BACK HOME.
THE LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE
WILL NOTICE YOUR SIGN.
BUT THE WOUNDS THAT DEFINE YOU,
THEY WILL BE OPENED ONCE AGAIN.
THE LIGHT IN THE DISTANCE
WILL NOTICE YOUR SCARS,
AND THE EYES THAT REMIND YOU,
THEY WILL BE HAUNTING YOU ONCE AGAIN.
THIS IS MY LAST DECLARATION.
EVERY SECOND I HOPE
FOR THIS MOMENT TO PASS.
THE LAST COMPLICATION
IS FOR YOU TO DECIDE
WHERE TO GO NEXT.
I WONâT BE FOLLOWING YOU ANYMORE.
I WILL BE ON MY WAY BACK HOME.
YOUâLL BE THE LAST TO KNOW.
FORGET THE ONE THAT TRIED TO
OPEN THE WOUNDS TO REMIND YOU.
YOUâLL BE THE LAST TO KNOW.
