LACKING THE SENSE OF SIGHT,
LIKE IN THE ESSENCE OF CONSCIOUSNESS.
SOMEHOW WE FAILED TO SEE,
HOW COULD I ACT SO BLIND?
RAISE YOUR HAND, RAISE THE QUESTION.
HOW COULD YOU ACT SO BLIND?
WHY DID YOU LEAVE ME TO DROWN,
IN THIS DESERT? TRAITOR.
I WAS HERE TO PURSUE A SOLUTION.
I WAS HERE FROM THE START, TRAITOR.
YOU WILL BE FOLLOWED,
WE WILL RETURN.
THE WAR HAS BEGUN.
WE CALL THIS WORTH FIGHTING,
WE CALL THIS DESTINY.
WITH THEIR ARGUMENTS IN MIND,
WITH THEIR WEAPONS
CONCEALED BENEATH THE SAND.
WEâLL GIVE UP EVERYTHING TO FIND
THE ANSWERS.
WE DONâT UNDERSTAND.
FORCED INTO WAR.
I WAS HERE TO PURSUE A SOLUTION.
I WAS HERE FROM THE START, TRAITOR.
YOU WILL BE FOLLOWED,
WE WILL RETURN.
THE WAR HAS BEGUN.
WE CALL THIS WORTH FIGHTING.
WE CALL THIS DESTINY.
WITH THEIR ARGUMENTS IN MIND,
WITH THEIR WEAPONS
CONCEALED BENEATH THE SAND.
WEâLL GIVE UP EVERYTHING TO FIND
THE ANSWERS.
WE DONâT UNDERSTAND.
