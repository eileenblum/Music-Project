ALL THE ATTEMPTS TO RECLAIM MY HEART FAIL THROUGH FALSE DESIRE.
SHE APPEARED TO SEE IT LIKE A BURDEN.
SHE DOESNâT WANT TO CARRY.
ONE ROAD WITHOUT DIRECTION,
NO ESCAPE WITHOUT CONFRONTATION,
NO HOPE, NO SOLUTION.
THESE THOUGHTS WILL KEEP ON RETURNING. LOOKING FOR REASONS TO INTERFERE,
A REASON TO STAY IN SIGHT.
THESE FEELINGS ARE LED BY NOTHING.
I KNOW THIS ISNâT RIGHT,
FOR BOTH SIDES.
WHY I AM AFRAID?
I WILL KEEP CONFRONTING
THIS FAMILIAR PLACE.
I AM AFRAID AND THIS WILL CONFRONT YOU, BUT IT DOESNâT CHANGE,
IT NEVER SEEMS TO CHANGE.
INSTEAD, IT MAKES ME COME TO LIFE.
WHEN YOUâRE LOST,
WHEN YOUâRE TROUBLED,
I WILL COME TO LIFE.
BUT THESE ARE NOT YOUR PROBLEMS
AND YOU ARE NOT THE ONE TO BLAME.
WITH ALL I HAVE I TRIED TO REACH YOU,
STILL YOU DONâT SEEM TO NOTICE,
ANYWAY.
EVERY TIME YOU SEE THE FLARES REACH HIGH,
I WILL COME TO LIFE.
WHEN YOUâRE LOST,
WHEN YOUâRE TROUBLED,
I WILL COME TO LIFE.
