YOUâVE LOST YOUR MIND
THAT TIME YOU LEFT ME DROWNING THERE.
ALL THOSE MOMENTS PASSING ME BY.
IâVE LOST MY FAITH IN YOU TODAY.
YOU DONâT DESERVE TO BE FOLLOWED.
YOUR WAYS, THE GAMES YOU PLAY BRING US
DOWN.
I WONâT FALL FOR YOUR TRICKS.
YOUâRE THE CORRUPTION.
NO, I WONâT FALL FOR YOUR SMILE.
I WONâT FORGET.
I FEEL YOUR PRESENCE,
A HELPING HAND.
IâM ALMOST CERTAIN
YOU CAME BACK FOR ME.
A SECOND CHANCE.
YOUR WARMTH SURROUNDED ME,
EMBRACING ME WITH STRENGTH.
WITHOUT HESITATION
I GRABBED HER HAND.
SHE SMILED
WELCOME TO THE END.
THEY DRAG ME DOWN
WAY UNDER TO THE BOTTOM
WHERE EVERYTHING TURNED BLACK.
NO BRIGHT LIGHTS TO FOLLOW.
NO TURNING BACK.
BUT I WONâT MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES AGAIN.
LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I MEAN.
LET ME CLIMB BACK TO THE SURFACE.
I WONâT MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES.
LET ME CLIMB BACK
TO THE SURFACE.
