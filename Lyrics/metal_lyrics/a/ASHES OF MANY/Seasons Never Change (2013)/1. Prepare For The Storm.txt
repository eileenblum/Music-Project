I WONâT TAKE THIS NO MORE.
VILLAINS APPEARED WITH HARROWING SCREAMING,
BARING THE FLAG OF CORRUPTION.
WE COULD NOT FEAR COLORS OF SHAME. THEYâRE ONLY MAKING ME STRONGER.
I WAS AROUND
WHEN THE STORM DESTROYED OUR SHELTER.
I WAS ABLE TO HIDE,
I WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY.
COLORS OF SHAME.
THEYâRE ONLY MAKING ME STRONGER.
NOW PREPARE FOR THE STORM.
IâLL PREPARE. WARN THOSE THAT CARE.
IâM HERE FOR A REASON,
I WAS LEFT TO FIND
WORDS THAT KEPT ME DOWN.
IâLL PREPARE FOR THE STORM.
COLORS OF SHAME.
THEYâRE ONLY MAKING ME STRONGER
