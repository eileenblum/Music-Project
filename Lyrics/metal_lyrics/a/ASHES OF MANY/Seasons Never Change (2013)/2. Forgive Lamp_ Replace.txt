MY CONFESSION, HEAR ME OUT.
IâM SPEAKING THE HONEST TRUTH.
NO UNDERLYING REASONS.
THE SOURCE OF THIS BEHAVIOUR,
ROOTED DEEP INSIDE.
BLINDED BY AGGRESSION.
BREAKING BOUNDARIES,
DENYING ALL CONSEQUENCES.
NO UNDERLYING REASONS,
THE SOURCE OF THIS BEHAVIOUR
KNOWING WE ARE BLESSED BY SIN.
MY PROMISE, MY BURDEN.
YOUR PROBLEMS, YOUR MISTAKES.
DENYING NEVER BROUGHT US FAR,
THE TRUTH WILL LEAD A WAY.
THESE PROBLEMS WILL FADE.
REMIND THE MISTAKES,
FORGIVE AND REPLACE.
AGING DOES NOT MEAN YOUâLL CHANGE.
SWALLOW YOUR WORDS OF CONVICTION.
YOUâRE STILL THE SAME.
SWALLOW YOUR WORDS OF CONVICTION.
YOUâRE STILL INSANE.
SWALLOW YOUR WORDS OF CONVICTION.
YOUâRE STILL THE FUCKING SAME.
