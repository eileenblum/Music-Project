WHEN THE TRUTH CAME OUT
ALL THE ANSWERS LEFT ME WIDE AWAKE.
THE WORDS YOU SAID
WILL NOT BE WRITTEN DOWN.
I ACCEPT YOUR CHOICES
STILL THE REASON LEAVES ME WIDE AWAKE.
WHY DID YOU WAIT?
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
A CLOSED NOVEL
AND IâM A COWARD AVOIDING THE FIGHT.
BUT PRESENTLY MY WILL GREW STRONGER.
IâVE FOUND A WAY TO SPEAK MY MIND.
WITH TIME THE CLOUDS GET DARKER,
ALL THESE THOUGHTS ARE IN MY WAY.
I KEEP TRYING TO TAKE IT BACK.
IN YOUR EYES ITâS TOO LATE.
THEREâS SO MUCH I NEED TO TELL YOU,
THEREâS SO MUCH YOU NEED TO KNOW.
THEREâS A REASON FOR MY ABSENCE.
I CAN NOT SEEM TO LET GO.
WHY AM I EVEN TRYING?
LET ME BE YOUR ANCHOR.
LEAVE THE REST TO ME.
