I WILL RETURN.
THEREâS SOMETHING LEFT INSIDE.
THE WAVES WILL GUIDE US
THROUGH THE TEMPEST,
THROUGH THE HEAVY RAIN.
ALL THIS TIME,
YOU REALLY THOUGHT YOU COULD
SCREW ME OVER?
ALL THIS TIME,
YOU REALLY THOUGHT YOU COULD
BRING ME TO MY KNEES?
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO STOP ME?
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO TURN ME AROUND?
AND NOW I FACE THE CONSEQUENCES.
AND NOW I FEEL BETRAYED.
THE TIDES ARE TURNING AND
THE WATER IS CLOSING IN.
I WILL BE COMING BACK,
GUIDED BY THE WAVES.
I WILL BE COMING BACK.
THE TIDES HAVE TURNED.
I WILL RETURN.
WHAT WOULD IT TAKE
TO CHANGE MY MIND?
FOR WHAT ITâS WORTH.
I WILL RETURN.
THESE WAVES ARE OUR OPPONENTS.
I WILL RETURN.
THESE ANCHORS BRING US SOLACE.
I WILL RETURN.
THEREâS SOMETHING LEFT INSIDE.
THE STARS WILL GUIDE US
TROUGH THE TEMPEST,
TROUGH THE HEAVY RAIN.
