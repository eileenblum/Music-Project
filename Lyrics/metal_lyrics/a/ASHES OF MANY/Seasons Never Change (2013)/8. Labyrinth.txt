LEAD ME TOWARDS THE EXIT
âCAUSE I CANâT STAND ANOTHER DAY.
JUST FAILURE AFTER FAILURE.
THESE WALLS DONâT SEEM TO FADE AWAY.
STILL EVERY DAY IâM TRYING
BUT EVERYTHING JUST STAYS THE SAME.
I CANâT STOP MOVING FORWARD.
I CANâT STOP LIVING YESTERDAY.
AS LONG AS I ACCEPT
THE RAVAGE YOU CAUSED.
AS LONG AS I DISGUISE MYSELF
BEHIND MY SELF-REGARD.
NO LONGER POSSESSED OR RETAINED.
NO LONGER LOST IN THE LABYRINTH
OF YOUR MISTAKES.
ENOUGH.
I MUST CONFRONT THIS DISEASE.
VOICES, THE WORDS I FEARED.
THEYâLL BE ERASED.
THEY WONâT REMAIN.
NO LONGER BOUND BY MISTAKES.
ITâS TIME TO MAKE A CHANGE.
I WILL REMAIN.
