MY ADVICE.
DONâT LEAVE YOUR WINDOWS OPEN TONIGHT.
THE MORE YOU TALK,
THE FASTER THEY WILL FIND OUT YOU LIED.
RISE UP.
CLOSE YOUR EYES.
THEREâS NOTHING LEFT TO SEE.
ITâS NOTHING BUT SCOURGED LAND
BELOW YOUR FEET.
MY ADVICE.
DONâT LEAVE YOUR WINDOWS OPEN TONIGHT.
THEY WERE SEARCHING FOR A WHILE.
I WAS JUST THE RETAINER,
I DIDNâT MAKE IT BACK IN TIME.
I WAITED FOR THE SUN TO RISE.
WHAT HAVE I BECOME?
WHAT HAVE I DONE?
WE SHOULD RISE UP
AND RETURN FROM THE ASHES.
BECAUSE SINCE YOU FAILED
WE WERE LEFT WITH THE SCARS.
RISE UP,
LETâS RETURN FROM THE ASHES.
YOU FAILED,
I WAS LEFT WITH THE SCARS.
I WAS JUST THE RETAINER.
I DIDNâT MAKE IT BACK IN TIME.
I WAITED FOR THE SUN TO RISE.
