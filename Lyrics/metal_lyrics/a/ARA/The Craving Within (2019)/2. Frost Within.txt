Frost and snow covers all my holy ground
Thoughts and prayers are spoken without a word
Sun and moon are both in harmony
Spirits and ghosts sing their song with me

You can never step in the same river twice
You never heard my voice
My eyes said enough

Naked and uncloaked, bare down to the bone
I have nothing to offer, but my heart and my soul
Unsheltered and vacant, I reveal myself complete
Never holding back, no conditions, no regrets

Defenseless I confess to the craving within
Iâll never turn back
This worldâs not for me
