I breathe because you give me life
The romance lies in our sacred joining
A hand reaches out, but clutches nothing
There is welcome burning in my veins

Gazing at the stellar brightness of your mind
And as I know you and your dreams
We agree in silence
This is the bond that I nurture

I gasp for breath, just one last breath
You could save me, but your reach is in a distant place

A tale of two lives with the same twisted fate
Blackened and withering away
Never finding words which fit

Wishing and hoping for tomorrow to come
