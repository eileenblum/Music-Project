From the dark arrives a vision in bloody clothing
The tormented ones falls to their knees
Step down from your pale horse
And welcome me to your domain
These are the scars of an aching wound
I died when you died, hanging from the tree

The dancing fire in your eyes
I will burn with pleasure (for you)
For (all) this and more I pine
For all this and Ãsgard too

500 visions haunts my sleep
500 valkyries speak my name

Now I stand at the shores of Valhalla
Where I died so many years ago
Will I finally get to live?
Will I dine at Odins table?

My resolution is strong as steel
Iâll never back down, my will is the key
Fire and fury will reign down upon
Any man who tries to steal my throne
