[Lork]
A life devoted to my praise of the supreme
That token in her hands was my prize to redeem
And whatever test I blew, now his trust in me is through
To him I'm just number 2
I don't know what I did wrong.

I don't understand what's going on,
Where is this doubt rising from?
What is this division father claims to see?
I did what I had to do, I did follow every rule.
I don't understand what he thinks
Is corrupting me

There's not a hint of dark in me,
No hint of dark in me, no hint of dark,
No darkness in me
I will never let him cut me out
This charade is not on me
Someone needs to talk some sense in this head!
I'm sure it's the crystal's fault,
I know something there is wrong.
I will never let that rock dictate my life again

There's not a hing of dark in me,
No hint of dark in me, no hint of dark,
No darkness in me

OscuritÃ 
One little drop
The infection spreads on his tainted heart
It spreads on his now tainted heart
Finding no sign of resistance, the dark takes control

[Lork]
I have no demons to tame!

No! I can't stand he chose Eirene
I'm a victim of

[Storyteller]
OscuritÃ 
One little drop
The infection spreads on his tainted heart
OscuritÃ 
One little drop
The infection spreads on his tainted heart
It spreads on his now tainted heart
Finding no sign of resistance, the dark takes control

[Lork]
I have no demons to tame!
