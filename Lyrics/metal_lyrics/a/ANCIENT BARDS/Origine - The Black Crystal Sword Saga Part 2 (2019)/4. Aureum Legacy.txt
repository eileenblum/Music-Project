[The Supreme]
My beloved precious children
I have gathered you today
For a change is coming to pass and it's gonna be OK

I've been searching for the answer
I lost faith along the way
But I always had the Aureum to remind me not to sway

I prepared you for the road ahead
And I taught you how to seek the truth
Let the crystal lead your every move
I've been doing it so long, now it's your turn

I received it from my father in its bow of opaline
I see how your spirit shine bright
Now the Aureum's yours Eirene

My dear son please don't be angry
Win your battle from within
In your heart there's light and darkness
And you're standing in between

I prepared you for the road ahead
And I taught you how to seek the truth
Let the crystal lead your every move
I've been doing it so long, now it's your turn

Now, my flesh and blood,
I consign the world to your hands
This is the White Stars's design, this is our duty divine
This sacred mission is the meaning of our lives

[Storyteller]
La viltÃ  domina, la vanitÃ  semina
L'oscuritÃ  germina, la sacertÃ  punirÃ 

L'empietÃ  domina, la vanitÃ  semina
L'oscuritÃ  germina, la notte vincerÃ 

[The Supreme]
Now, my flesh and blood,
I consign the world to your hands
This is the White Stars's design
This is our duty divine
This sacred mission is the meaning of our lives

Now, my flesh and blood,
I consign the world to your hands
This is the White Stars's design
This is our duty divine
This sacred mission is the meaning of our lives
