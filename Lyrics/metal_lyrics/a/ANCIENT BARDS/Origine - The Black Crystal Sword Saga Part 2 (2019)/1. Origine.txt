[Storyteller]
...Now it is time for you to know about its genesis.

Once upon a time, long before Lastworld existed, there was a heavenly place inhabited by the Aeons, divine entities, eternal yet mortal.

At the center of their universe was the White Crystal, the substance and power that constituted all creation, the host of the ever flowing flux of life, the nourishment of all things.

The Aeons had consecrated their existence to meditation, in the pursuit of absolute Wisdom, a profound form of awareness that would allow them to discover the meaning of their existence and the purpose for which the White Stars had created them.

Handed down from generation to generation was their exhausting practice of devotion to pure contemplation, in an attempt to approach the vibration of the crystal and become one with it.

This was the Chite Crystal World.

(Every creature here is connected
Through the crystal life flows)

Every creature here is connected
Through the crystal all is flowing,
Through the crystal all is moving
Through the crystal all is growing.

Every creature here is connected
Through the crystal all is flowing,
Through the crystal all is moving
Through the crystal all is growing.

All creation breathes in harmony (harmony)
