[Storyteller]
The end crawls on the last two souls,
in a barren world,
all that's left is destruction.

Prospect slit by a dreadful split.
When the fates are done, the two sides of the whole will finally cross swords.

He is the champion of unwanted souls
the defender of cowardly deviance
everything that he wants, he takes it by force,
he takes it no matter the cost.

She is the brightest pure being of all,
the descendant of mythical candor,
in her conscience she keeps, the true key to be in touch with the heart of the world.

[Man]
You can't win this, just step aside
I'm tired of your spineless demeanor
Get on my side, into the dark
avoid your impending demise!

[Woman]
I'm not enticed by your words of demise,
you won't lure me into joining your venture.
Every blow from the dark, I'll fight back with light,
by wielding this Black Crystal Sword!

[Storyteller]
The ascent
of primeval forces in the night
ignites the ancestral fight

[Woman]
In the rise
of primeval forces in the night
our past and future collide

Impious dystopia
a sentence of doom
moving away from the truth
Wisdom is lost

[Man]
Knowledge is out there for me,
I will take it as I please.

[Storyteller]
The ascent
of primeval forces in the night
ignites the ancestral fight

[Woman]
In the rise
of primeval forces in the night
our past and future collide

Impious dystopia
a sentence of doom
moving away from the truth
Wisdom is lost

Impious delirium you chose the wrong path
it breaks my heart,
I can't let you fulfill your plan
