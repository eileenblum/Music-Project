[Chief of the Rejects]
My brother gather 'round
Let's welcome our new guest!
It's been a draining run,
You better get some rest.
Our wait was worth the while.
The chosen one is here
He joined us in exile,
Now payback time is near.

[Rejects]
Ego fero densum malum
(The Thick Evil of the First Night)
Primae noctis atri leti
Quod is densum malum habet
Bow down to the chosen one!

[Chief of the Rejects]
Here, Lork, the malum's yours
You are the leader now
Soon wisdom will be ours,
We'll take it, we know how
We're feeling loud and strong
A thirst we cannot quench,
Before we move along
We want to get revenge.

Primae noctis atri leti
Quod is densum malum habet
Bow down to the chosen one!

[Chief of the Rejects]
Leave your hopes redemption,
Lead us in the ascension!
We'll do as you ask, we are your people now.
