[Storyteller:]
When all the haze dissipates

[Lork:]
This body is empty,
Where is my father?
God, what have I done?
He is no more.

[Voices:]
Run away! run away!
Murderer, run away!
Run away! run away!
Murderer, run away!

[Storyteller:]
Blood threads weaved in the dark
Warp is doom, weft is loss
The die is cast there's no turning back now

[Lork:]
Can't you see this body is empty?
He's not here, where is my father?
Someone help me, what have I done?
It's my fault now he is no more!

Can't you see this body is empty?
He's not here, where is my father?
Someone help me, what have I done?
It's my fault now he is no more!

[Voices:]
Run away!
Run away!
