[Lork]
Though my pride's unbowed,
My affliction's loud
And my thoughts belong to chaos
There's no end in sight
To my growing spite
And the cause of my trouble is you.

[The Supreme]
What's that fiery look in your eyes?
Your demons are finally taking over.
With these words of hate that you mouth
You sound like the Chief of the Rejects.
Wisdom can't be snatched with the sword,
You have to achieve it with dedication
My dear son please don't be deceived,
Wake up from your stubborn denial

[Lork]
Aberration, instigation
Domination, castigation
Condemnation, aggravation
Aspiration, abjuration
Is this what you call depravity?

You're so sure of what you've been told,
You follow their teachings
Without contention.
How did that work out for you dad?
Did you ever hear from the crystal?
I bet I can prove you all wrong
And shatter your faith in a million pieces
I will find the truth on my own
And show you who's the real hero

Aberration, instigation
Domination, castigation
Condemnation, aggravation
Aspiration, abjuration
Is this what you call depravity?

Though my pride's unbowed,
My affliction's loud
And my thoughts belong to chaos
There's no end in sight
To my growing spite
And the cause of my trouble is you.
I remember now
How you told me how
I have always been your diamond
Am I courtly now?
Am I special now?
Am I your little promising boy?

[Voices]
We are reason, listen yo us
Your compassion is misplaced now
Swing your knife and end his dull life
His guard is down, it's the right time

[Lork]
I hear captivating voices
I'm delighted by their presence
I believe them, they are right, soon
I will be the leader

Meet my blade dad
You can see how it feels like to
Be stabbed through the heart!

Though my pride's unbowed,
My affliction's loud
And my thoughts belong to chaos
There's no end in sight
To my growing spite
And the cause of my trouble is you.
I remember now how you told me how
I have always been your diamond
Am I courtly now?
Am I special now?
Am I your little promising boy?

Though my pride's unbowed,
My affliction's loud
And my thoughts belong to chaos
There's no end in sight
To my growing spite
And the cause of my trouble is you.
