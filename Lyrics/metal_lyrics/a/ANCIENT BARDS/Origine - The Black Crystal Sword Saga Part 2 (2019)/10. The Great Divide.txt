[Part 1 - Farewell Father]

[Storyteller]
Soon after the break of day
Eirene prepares for a ride,
But when she walks through the yard
She strips on a horror that tears her apart

Her lifeless father is there,
Laying in a pool of blood,
The blade still lodged in his chest
There's not doubt this crime
Was committed by Lork

[Eirene]
Farewell Father
Light of my light
Goodbye Brother
I lost you too

May the ground be light to you
I will do my best to keep your legacy alive
Sit tibi terra levis
Farewell Father!

[Storyteller]
Now her composure is gone,
She feels so crushed and alone
She doesn't know what to do
So she calls out to her grandfather for help

The old man stares at his son
Silently sinking in pain,
Eirene can't subdue her grief
She falls on her knees and the desperately cries

[Eirene]
Farewell Father
Light of my light
Goodbye Brother
I lost you too

May the ground be light to you
I will do my best to keep your legacy alive
Sit tibi terra levis
Farewell Father!

Desolation
Grows and break the banks

[Part 2 - Teardrop]

[Storyteller]
One tearddrop springs from her eye,
Then runs down her cheek,
It lingers on her lip,
Then drips from her chin

It falls on a crystal rock
And as if by magic the rock lights up.
The crystal shines bright.

True enlightenment, pure sapience,
Only come from self-knowledge,
From embracing your weakness
Understanding every motion.

[Part 3 - Il Grande E Forte Impero]

[Lork]
I, abandoned by the light in this exile
I am the fallen one
I, I am the sacrifice

Awakened by my brothers,
With reprisal we'll be back
The Rejects are now forever
Sickened by the light

[Rejects]
Ego fero densum malum
Primae noctis atri leti
Quod is densum malum habet
Venga il grande e forte impero!

Long night and terror we bring
The great and strong empire will come!
With our king at the lead,
No mercy to plead,
He won't hold back when his destiny calls
All hail the new king!

[Lork]
Yes, we'll crush the Aeons standing against us
With the fire and the flame
We, we'll make Eirene repent

We are darkness,
We are nothingness, pure eternal void
We are the empire of the Black Death

[Rejects]
Ego fero densum malum
Primae noctis atri leti
Quod is densum malum habet
Venga il grande e forte impero!

Long night and terror we bring
The great and strong empire will come!
With our king at the lead, no mercy to plead,
He won't hold back when his destiny calls
All hail the new king!

[Eirene]
In my sorrow
I will stand tall
I will honor you

[Grandfather]
Your tear, Eirene, is the harbinger of a very welcomed message. The light that emanates from the crystal is the proof that you are pure-hearted one, chosen by fate to give us meaning and purpose! My dear granddaughter, your father was not wrong! You are the one who shall be blessed by wisdom for you are the legitimate owner of the Aureum. I am proud of you and so honored to be here by your side.

The pain that shakes your is also the force that sustains you, as you are now one step away from discovering the meaning of our life and attaining true understanding. But, to be able to concentrate on your destiny, you must first defeat the darkness that lingers over the world
To do this, you will have to forge a weapon from this bright crystal.
You will create the blade that shall silence all the forces of evil

You will call it the Whyte Crystal Sword.
