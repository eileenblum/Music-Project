[Storyteller]
Valiant knights laying still on the floor
this is how this tragic story goes

Bravery sometimes is not enough
when you're faced with darkness itself 

In the end Sendor couldn't be stopped 
now his plan is complete
he can bring back on his own
the sweet treasure he's lost 
for a father's love can go 
all the way 

The evil wizard 
puts a spell on Dorus
but his soul won't come back 

[Sendor]
Silence reigns in the ghostly halls 
even the owls speak no more

All is calm and the feel is surreal 
but inside I have a restless heart 

[Storyteller]
In the end Sendor couldn't be stopped 
now his plan is complete
he can bring back on his own
the sweet treasure he's lost 
for a father's love can go 
all the way 

The evil wizard puts a spell on Dorus
but his soul won't come back 
The evil wizard tries all over again
but his soul won't come back 

Anger and pain
drove him insane 
he will kill 
the defenceless kings
but as he goes for them
a windowpane break
she turns around 
and Daltor is there! 

[Daltor]
You see I'm here 
your magic tricks are
nothing compared
to my dexterity in the art
of training dragons like this one
you see I'm here 
the game is over
you will regret
you will repent even thinking
of stealing that cursed crystal sword 

[Storyteller]
Daltor's shaken 
by what he sees before him 
tired of fighting 
but now he's ready once again 

[Daltor]
Look what you've done 
these people are good
they don't deserve to die this way
from the hand of 
a miserable filthy coward man

Look what you've done 
you crazy monster
how could you be so cruel and cold
to hurt so bad 
a lady so fair and fragile 

[Storyteller]
Daltor's shaken 
by what he sees before him 
tired of fighting 
but now he's ready once again
to start another round 

[Sendor]
Alright now I've had enough
I see you seem to know it all
if you don't mind we could draw our swords 
and solve this thing as men! 

[Storyteller]
When all hope seemed to be gone a light came through the dark. Daltor on the back ofthe guardian dragon broke through the windows of the castle landing behind Sendor. Seeing the kings and Dorus lying unconcious on the ground he took back his Silver Sword. Sendor's look is full of hatred and pain, the magic sword has made him furious. A long and intense battle is about to beginâ¦ 

[Daltor]
Raise the sword!
For the glory and peace, let the fight begin!
