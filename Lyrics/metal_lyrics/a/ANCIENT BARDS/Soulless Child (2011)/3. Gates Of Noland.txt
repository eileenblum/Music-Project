[Storyteller]
Meanwhile the heroes are searching for a way
to get to the Dark Cave as soon as they can
they're ready for anything to stop the impending war
this is what they gathered for
they stick to each other and they promise to themselves
they won't let fear or vengence take control over their lives
now that Dorus has the sword they're feeling strong again 
feeling finally as a whole
even tighter than before 

Step by step they walk in line
Alron's leading the way
to the inaccessible 
gates of Noland 

[The Group]
Waving our banners with pride we go
from the mountain tops to the shores
with our heads up high
to the moon so bright
we deliver our song tonight 

[Storyteller]
The end of Lastworld is near and they feel
that peril and anguish are waiting for them
Now that Dorus has the sword the wizard will succumb 
and then peace will shine again
even brighter than before 

Step by step they walk in line
Alron's leading the way
to the inaccessible 
gates of Noland 

[The Group]
Waving our banners with pride we go
from the mountain tops to the shores
with our heads up high
to the moon so bright
we deliver our song tonight
