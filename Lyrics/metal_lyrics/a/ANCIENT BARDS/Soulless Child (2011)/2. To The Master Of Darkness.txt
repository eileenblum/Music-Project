[Storyteller]
A dazzling light
rips the sky
drawing lines through the dusk
nobody sees it
the heroes keep walking on
cruelly the sunlight is hitting his armour
that's reflecting rays all around 

Wonderful creature 
with instinct to kill 
with his magic Sendor has stolen your will
mighty and strong
oh so quickly you zoom
showing Daltor his doom

Wonderful creature 
with nothing to fear
you fly over valleys so fierce and austere
holding and clutching the knight in your claws
against your holy laws 

[Black Dragon]
Give up! you foolish madman
Give up! you cannot win
Start saying your last prayers
cause your life won't be spared

Give up! you foolish madman
Give up! you cannot win 
Start saying your last prayers
cause your life won't be spared 

[Daltor]
My spirit's pure my faith is strong I won't give in 
though I ain't got my silver sword 
I'll save myself and you! 

[Storyteller]
Daltor is choked with the strength of the grasp
he still has one last weapon that he can clasp
now he bends outwards to reach for his foot 
puts a hand in his boot

He takes a dagger that secretly kept
to hold and to use just in case he was trapped
wounding the dragon blood starts now to drip
so it loosens its grip 

[Black Dragon]
Give up! you foolish madman
Give up! you cannot win
Start saying your last prayers
cause your life won't be spared

Give up! you foolish madman
Give up! you cannot win
Start saying your last prayers
cause your life won't be spared 

[Daltor]
My spirit's pure my faith is strong I won't give in 
though I ain't got my silver sword 
I'll save myself and you! 

[Storyteller]
Wounded, bleeding from his chest and possessed
the beast fights the king of the west
casting shadows on the land
leaving traces on the white sand 

[Daltor]
now listen, hear my voice
I know your heart is still in there
refuse his guidance
I know you can 

[Storyteller]
Wounded, bleeding now it's no more possessed
now freed its spirit can now rest
casting shadows on the land
leaving traces on the white sand 

[Daltor]
Now my dragon fly me to Sendor
take me into the heart of Noland 
where the sun never shines and the fog's always thick 
where the sounds just gets lost in the forest
take me straight to the master of darkness!
