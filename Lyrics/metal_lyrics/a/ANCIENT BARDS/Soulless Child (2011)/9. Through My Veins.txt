[Shena]
The battle wages on as cruel as it can be
swords slashing on the shields make sparks that fill the air
no holds barred here I nearly lost my ring
my friends are on the ground it's time for me to hit 

[Sendor]
My arms get stronger and stronger
with every breath I take
I feel the power of this sword
through my veins

A god is growing inside me
it feeds my every cell
I feel the power of this sword
through my veins 

[The Group]
Oh how he blows us away! 
Oh how he makes us fall! 
We can't last for long
we are on our knees! 

What a perfect chance for us to be
the glorious kings the world needs
Let's fight him back
fight him 'til death! 

[Sendor]
Come on, show me what you've got! 

[Alron]
King Rahed has lost his senses, Shena takes her turn
she thinks that killing Sendor will mend her broken heart
My rod's powerless, I don't know what to do 
I hope that he won't hurt the woman he once loved 

[Sendor]
My arms get stronger and stronger
with every breath I take
I feel the power of this sword
through my veins

A god is growing inside me
it feeds my every cell
I feel the power of this sword
through my veins 

[The Group]
Oh how he blows us away!
Oh how he makes us fall! 
We can't last for long
we are on our knees! 

What a perfect chance for us to be
the glorious kings the world needs
Let's fight him back
fight him 'til death! 

[Sendor]
Come on, show me what you've got! 

[Storyteller]
Sendor screaming out like a demon
strikes them showing no mercy
full of hatred and endless fury
he's turned into a monster
scattered fragments of glass
bodies lying on the stairs 

[Shena]
The battle wages on as cruel as it can be

he's turned into a monster
