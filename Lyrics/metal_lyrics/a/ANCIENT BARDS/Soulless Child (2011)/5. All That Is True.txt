Standing by the window
two shadows are getting closer
tight in a warm embrace

Swayin' under the moonlight
caressing each others hands
with such a peaceful grace 

Gently she leans now
her head on his chest 
feeling his heartbeat
she lets her hair down 

[Woman]
My love I can't do this 
we knew it from the start 
I just can't be with you 
You're not from around here, 
you're not one of my kind,
this love's against the law 

[Storyteller]
He kisses her forehead 
then shifts to her neck 
she starts breathing faster
the passion's too strong 

[Man and Woman]
To my heart you're all that is true (I feel you) 
and I won't give up on you
loving you is all I can do (I know) 
you're all that's worth living for 

[Man]
My love let me love you
for nothing can come between us
not even your cruel laws
Together we can make it
and I'll be yours forever,
untill death do us part 

[Storyteller]
He kisses her forehead 
then shifts to her neck 
she starts brathing faster
the passion's too strong 

[Man and Woman] 
To my heart you're all that is true (I feel you) 
and I won't give up on you
loving you is all I can do (I know) 
you're all that's worth living for 

To me you're my air 
you're all that I see 
my angel of love
loving you is all I can do (I know) 
you're all that I need 

[Man]
After this union a baby is born 
we'll secretly raise him until he's ready 
to prove to the world our love
is true and we'll be free 

[Man and Woman]
To my heart you're all that is true (I feel you) 
and I won't give up on you
loving you is all I can do (I know) 
you're all that's worth living for

The new family were happy, peace reigned among them, they lived united in the hope that some day they could share their joy with the world, but sadly the baby became sick and died. They never recovered from their loss and eventually this shock led them to insanity.

[Man and Woman]
To my heart you're all that's true and I know 
I won't give up on you!
loving you, oh it's all that I can do and I know 
you're all I'm living for
