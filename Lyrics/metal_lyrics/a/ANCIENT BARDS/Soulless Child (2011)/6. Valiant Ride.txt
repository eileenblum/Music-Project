[Alron]
Here we are, this little army
will defeat the evil Sendor 
he lives on an island on the Dead Sea 
in a castle of horror and grief 

Down the hill there is a cabin 
there we'll find an old mad man 
he will give us the map to where we must go
in exchange for a quail and a boar 

Hurry my friends there's no time to hesitate 

Now the map is leadin' our way 
to a pier where there's a raft 
and a small piece of wood to use as an oar
oh get ready to row to the sea 

We're on board, the water's smelly 
it's like all the fish are rotten 
the waves hit the old tub making us sway
and it is also starting to rain 

Hurry my friends there's no time to hesitate 

[The Group]
For as long as we know how to use our weapons
there's nothing that can destroy our force
For as long as we know how to stay together
there's no man or demon that can frighten us! 

[Storyteller]
Approaching the shore
Thunders, bolts, raging wind and pouring rain
short earthquakes shake the ground beneath their feet 

[Shena]
This place is hell
how can someone live here? 
It's a place with no soul 
it's a place of despair

I wonder how a man can cope with this loneliness
it is way too much
ever for the darkerst sinner 

[The Group]
For as long as we know how to use our weapons
there's nothing that can destroy our force
For as long as we know how to stay together
there's no man or demon that can frighten us!
