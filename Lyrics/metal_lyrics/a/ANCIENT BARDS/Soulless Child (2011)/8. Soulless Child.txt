[Sendor]
Welcome my guests, I've been waiting
for so long for this fine day to come
it's a pleasure to finally meet you
Come here Dorus and join me my son 

Woman I'm talking to you now
I guess you never told 'em the truth 
there was something so slightly familiar
in the boy that was walking with you

[Shena]
Of course no I never told 'em 
my lil' boy had died in my arms
as much as I hate to say it
he will never come back 

[Sendor]
Shena you're wrong you could've saved him 
oh if only you weren't so blind 
with your magic you could've resurrect him 
and by now we'd be living just fine 

[Shena]
It was pointless using my magic
you know it can't bring back the soul 
there's nothing able to do that
not even that crystal sword 

[The Kings]
Now we can see you're devoured by sorrow
and your intentions were good somehow
but you don't know the power of that sword 
you'll soon be overwhelmed 

[Sendor]
When a man loses his love 
and a disease takes his child away
there is no way to fill the void
his heart constricts in endless pain 

[Storyteller]
And so he did it by himself
he tried a ritual from ancient myths
walked through the graveyard, with tears in his eyes
knelt on the tomb and then brought him to life 

Even though he had lost his love
he had his son back but with no soul 
his look is empty he's like a toy
he hugs him and then they disappear 

sixteen years later Sendor's back 
he has come up with a cunning plan
takes control over his marionette 
and sends him to Daltor 
He will say that he had found the sword
and is ready to unleash a war
the four kings will gather and prepare
to go and face the menace 

[Sendor]
Woman I'm talking to you now

his heart constricts in endless pain 

[Storyteller]
And so he did it by himself
he tried a ritual from ancient myths
walked through the graveyard
with tears in his eyes
knelt on the tomb 
and then, then he brought him to life
'cause he felt it was good 
'cause he felt it was right
he never thought he was going off track
and decieving himself 

the heroes now are getting tired
this went too far, this has to end
the wizard's mad, they launch their attack

As soon as they get close
a light shines from behind him
now the chest is open, he grabs the sword
