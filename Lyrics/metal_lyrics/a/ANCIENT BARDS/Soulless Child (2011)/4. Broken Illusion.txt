[Alron]
We're before the cavern's gates
at the entrance of this dark place of loneliness
it was dug into the rock
by an ancient tribe
to imprison their outlaws

On the left side of the cave 
there's empty spot
where the black dragon used to be
but on the other side 
even the white dragon is missing 

We must walk into the cave 
Walking down into the heart of the mountain
The cobwebs will hide the waypay attention
cause it's easy to get lost 

We're inside a labyrinth
made of long tunnels that'll take you nowhere
bones here and there on the groundoh yes, 
this one's a risky mission 

[Shena]
Down there my ring says follow my lead
the thing we're looking for is down there 
soon we will solve the mystery of the sword
here we are this is the place 

[The Kings]
The boy told the truth
the chest's not in its place
he was right the chest is no longer here
our fear has become reality
now our duty is harder than ever 

The boy told the truth 
the chest's not in its place
he was right the chest is no longer here
our fear has become reality
now our duty is harder than ever 

The boy told the truth
the chest's not in its place
he was right the chest is no longer here
our fear has become reality
now our duty is harder than ever 

[Rahed]
Let's go my friendswe gotta go there 
we must reach the dark lord 
before it's too late 
we will go together
to the perpetrator's den 
and save the day!
