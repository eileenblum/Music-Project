Only darkness
I can feel the beat of my heart getting weaker
A tightness that makes it hard for me to move my body
IÊ¼m tired
I can feel the wind through my hair, the beating of his wings
All around itÊ¼s dark
But I can see a light far from the distance
You canÊ¼t die now
Find your strength Daltor!
