[Alron]

Just right before we left,
I was catching my breath,
I was binding up my wounds
and checking myself everywhere
for broken bones.
I had nothing there left to do,
until I looked up
and I saw it laying there,
I saw the shattered sword.

History says we owe respect
to this legendary sword.

We know, oh mighty kings,
the Dark Cave is where it belongs.
We'll lay it there for the world to see
we restored our eternal peace.

As soon as I stood up,
I collected the pieces
and then put them in this pouch,
which I tied to my belt
to keep it safe.
But now look at this, everyone,
the crystal is white!
I don't know what this change means,
the black has gone away.

History says we owe respect
to this legendary sword.

We know, oh mighty kings,
the Dark Cave is where it belongs.
We'll lay it there for the world to see
we restored our eternal peace.

We know, oh mighty kings,
the Dark Cave is where it belongs.
We'll lay it there for the world to see
we restored our eternal peace.

Here falls the blue veil of the night,
the deep blue veil of the night.

[Daltor]

Lie there for eternity!
We should stay here and rest our bones,
I think we deserve this much at least!
Oh majestic, proud Black Dragon watch our sleep,
this will be your last guard.

[Shadow]

"Oh lowly, unsuspecting sleeping kings, your immense
valor makes my duty all the more harrowing. Oh, there
you are... When I look upon you the part of me that still
remembers my life on these lands craves to touch you.
Sadly, those memories don't belong to me anymore and
my purpose is different. I see you in your restless sleep
and I know what you're dreaming of... images from the
ancient legend... it all will soon be clear, I promise, but
now you need to wake up, wake up Daltor, wake up!"

[Daltor]

"Uh! Uh? Who is it? Who's speaking?

[Shadow]

"Don't be afraid Daltor, it's me, your father"

[Daltor]

"What? No! No! That's... that's impossible!"

[Storyteller]

Thick, dark voracious clouds
have devoured almost the entire castle,
while unforgiving gloom
still drips down carving stones like knives of terror.

Evil is still around!

[The Dark Demon]

I'm finally free, I'm finally out,
I was there, trapped for so long,
held down, locked and kept in chains,
closed in, since the beginning of time!

I am the anguish darkness fears,
everything from now on will change.
Bow down for there's no escape,
indulge me and if you don't you will die!

[Storyteller]

Echoes in the halls,
whose voice is this?

For the righteous there's no rest,
no truce to his misery,
'cause the universe relies on him
to protect, fight and serve.

Maybe a preventive spell
has brought Sendor to this world again?
Duping hard the laws of death
to put an end to what began.

Evil is still around!

[The Dark Demon]

Damnation is a trifle
in comparison to my depravity.
Wicked, cruel and unmerciful,
perverted since the beginning of time!

I'm finally back to rule the world,
everything will bend at my will.
I'm the Lord of all your souls
indulge me and if you don't you will die!

[Storyteller]

Echoes in the halls,
whose voice is this?

For the righteous there's no rest,
no truce to his misery,
'cause the universe relies on him
to protect, fight and serve.

Maybe a preventive spell
has brought Sendor to this world again?
Duping hard the laws of death
to put an end to what he had begun.

In its presence, turmoil, crisis!
Nothing grows and nothing rises!

[Father]

"With Dorus' arrival so began your venture forged in
deception. What you were seeing was just a body brought
back to life, for Dorus was a child without a soul, sent to
you by the Dark Wizard. You were deceived, and used, by
Sendor, for he needed your weapons, brought together,
to open the chest containing the black crystal sword. He
needed that sword and its supreme power, a power that
he thought could also bring back the soul of his son too.
With this well-orchestrated deception he got what he
wanted, he got the sword."

[Father]

"But that sword, a source of pure evil, is not made
to be held by men as it makes them lose their
reasoning, and you son, you did the only thing
you possibly could do. But see? The pieces of
crystal have turned white... that means that you
released something far more dangerous than
Sendor, something that only an old legend dares
to talk about. There's nothing left to do now
but prepare to face the worse, because the legend
is becoming truth and the truth is now.
History is repeating itself: the most ancient of
evil has been freed."

[Daltor]

No! Things are so much worse than before!

[The Dark Demon]

"Finally! I have been awakened!"
