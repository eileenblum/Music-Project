Ego fero densum malum
primae noctis leti mei

Look down don't raise your head,
just stay there where you are.
What is the quickest way
to take away that sneer?
Don't fight, don't mess with me,
don't tell me you despise me
cause I don't care at all,
my heart knows no regret.

You will perish
in the attempt to
try and stop me
just like your father

You took all the blame, 
you grew up in pain,
all of this time you never knew
it wasn't your fault,
the whole thing was staged.

How about now?
Where is your rage
that kept you alive,
throughout these lands, across this life
when I'm the one that made him go home,
pick up a rope and hang himself?

he stepped on the chair and put
the rope around his neck?
