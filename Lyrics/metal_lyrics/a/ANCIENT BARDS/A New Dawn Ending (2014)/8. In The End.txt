Move it guys, let's get out of this place,
everything is falling down.
Turn around, we cannot go this way,
cause the last flight of stairs has collapsed.
This doomed castle is changing its face,
see, the walls turned into rocks!
And the floor is so uneven and thick,
waits for us to stumble down its clefts.

... Hurry my friends there's no time to hesitate...

Follow me on this meandering path,
put the corpses on my back.
Careful now, we all better crouch down
or these tangled branches will strike us.
There's the sea and the stream looks so strong,
hope it didn't steal our raft.
Come on Shena, I know it's hard,
but we have to get soon to the pier.

... Hurry my friends there's no time to hesitate...

Tribute we pay to the goddess of war
who stands by the side of those in the right, 
calming their fears with the feeling that good
always wins in the end

These two bodies need a proper burial that's for sure,
we'll give them a due funeral and then return to our realms.
