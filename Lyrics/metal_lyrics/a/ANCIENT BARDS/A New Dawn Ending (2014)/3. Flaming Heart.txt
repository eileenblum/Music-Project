[Man]

Be careful my son there's a bear
there in the clearing,
I taught you what you need to know,
this time it's your turn.
Come down now and sneak through the grass,
slowly get closer,
don't ever lose sight of your prey,
don't make any noise,
feel the wind blowing
and breathe in the wild
in sweet harmony.
Every fighter knows 
that his chances are stronger
when peace lies within
Go!

Well you made the bear run away,
you're injured and dirty,
Why didn't you listen to me?
Do you ever learn?

[Daltor]

But father it wasn't my fault,
I did what you told me,
I followed your every advice,
look what they got me!
Maybe it's time to admit that you are worthless,
you're grey and you're old.
I don't wanna hunt with you ever again,
will you leave me alone?

[Storyteller]

In Daltor's flaming heart
when judgement falls apart,
resentment runs like a river that flows out of its bed,
infectious makes him lie,
disown his blood ties,
disgrace the holy bond of family.

[Daltor]

My words resound in my head,
I'm incredibly sad and ashamed at the same time.

[Storyteller]

Running fast between the oaks,
sliding down the slopes,
Daltor leaves the forest and heads to his father.

[Daltor]

I'm rushing to get back home,
I can't wait to see him,
I want to look straight in his eyes,
and apologize.
I hope he'll forgive my contempt,
I'm so unworthy.
Oh father please open the door!
Oh please let me in!
You can't leave me outside just let me explain,
I'm breaking in!
Oh my god he's hanging down from the ceiling!
Oh why! Tell me why!

[Storyteller]

In Daltor's flaming heart
when judgement falls apart,
resentment runs like a river that flows out of its bed,
infectious makes him lie,
disown his blood ties,
disgrace the holy bond of family.

In Daltor's aching heart,
as his world falls apart,
despair grows faster than weeds on sunny summer's day,
it feeds upon his guilt,
for he has to be
the new king of the West
and be brave
and pretend
for no one has to know
it was his fault!
