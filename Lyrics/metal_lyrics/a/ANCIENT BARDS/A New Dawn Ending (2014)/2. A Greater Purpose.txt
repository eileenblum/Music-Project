Thick, dark voracious clouds
wolfing down the tops of the highest towers
bleed unforgiving gloom
that drips down carving stones like knives of terror

[Daltor]

I was always so narcissistic,
superficial and arrogant,
slaying dragons to satisfy
nothing but my vanity. 
All the glory and adoration
made me feel like some kind of god,
I was sure that my valiant deeds
would go down in history.

Here on my shoulders i bear the weight
of so many faultless lives,
my sword's so much heavier now
that I know they all depend on me.

Seeing things from this new perspective
all my past seems so trivial,
I was only a fatuous boy
living out his own deceit.
I am filled by this new awareness,
for my sins I will make amend,
I will cherish the wisdom born
from my strange epiphany.
Here on my shoulder I bear the weight
of so many faultless lives,
my sword's so much heavier now
that I know they all depend on me.

with his cruelest enemy,
while he's waging the battle
with the demons inside of him!

Embrace my evolution,
cause I sense I was brought to this life
for a greater purpose.
Smack down the fiend!

See the mortal dance
Left right left right up down up down
One hops forward one steps back
dodges blows bending to the side
Left right left right up down up down
One hops forward one steps back
Cold blades cut the air seeking flesh hungry for bones

Though this day of grand disillusion
might as well be my very last
I am grateful for I received
the great gift of clarity
The result of past behavior
wasn't meaningless after all
if there's anything I've ever learned 
is to spear cold-bloodedly

Here on my shoulders i bear the weight
of so many faultless lives,
my sword's so much heavier now
that I know they all depend on me.
