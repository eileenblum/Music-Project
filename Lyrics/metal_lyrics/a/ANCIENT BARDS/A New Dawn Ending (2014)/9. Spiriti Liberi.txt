In the Plain of the Rocks there's a meadow,
with a large willow tree,
like a miracle it grows
on that hostile ground.

[Rahed]

Over those hills there's a valley
caressed by the wind,
where the fawns quench their thirst
in the crystal clear lake.

After this goodbye I won't get a chance
to come back here and visit their graves.
Any place we choose is gonna be fine, cause their spirits are free somewhere.

He's with him somehow,
running through the fields with him right now,
laughing with his son for the first time,
soaking deeply in his love sublime, 
reunited.

Spiriti liberi da quel che fu
Persi nel tempo infinito lassÃ¹
