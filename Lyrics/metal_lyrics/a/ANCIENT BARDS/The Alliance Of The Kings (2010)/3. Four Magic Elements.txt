[Storyteller]
The journey began
The fearless heroes left
Heading for a place
Far oh far away
They had to warn Alron
The prince of the North
Of the terrible danger
That threatened all the lands

He holds the secrets
Of the black magic
His weapon is
The magical stick
There's the power
Of all black magic
In the hands
Of the prince!

Fire, for a rain of a thousand flames
Idro, for a waterfall of cold sea
Thunder, for a roaring electrical storm
Blizzard and Hailstorm, a thousand ice thorns

He holds the secrets
Of the black magic
His weapon is
The magical stick
There's the power
Of all black magic
In the hands
Of the prince!

Fire and flames, paralizing ice
Water and thunder the four magic elements

Fire and flames, paralizing ice
Water and thunder the four magic elements
