[Daltor]
You, that fly in the sky
Black Dragon die!
Throw flames from your head
trying to kill me
you don't know
who you are facing
blood on your teeth
but now let the fight begin!

[Black Dragon]
He is my spirit
he lives in my heart
he's guiding my will
so I must kill you

[Daltor]
Guardiano eterno
Sendor is in you in your heart
I will fight for my lands!

[Black Dragon]
Yes I am only the first
the first guardian
of the sword
in my head
darkness is cold
Sendor has my control

[Daltor]
This is my spirit
my virtue and strength
with full devotion
I'll honor my call

Guardiano eterno
Sendor in you in your heart
I will fight for my lands!

I am Daltor the dragonhunter
I will sacrifice all that I have
I will brandish my silver sword
and I'll kill you
there's no mercy for the betrayers
I am Daltor the dragonhunter!

[Sendor]
No! my dragon! what have you done? you can't give in now, it can't be! he's just a foolish king! but trust me, I will give you all of my strength, there's only one thing left to do: stand up my dragon, spread your wings, fly high reaching the sky and kill him NOW!

[Daltor]
I am Daltor the dragonhunter
I will sacrifice all that I have
I will brandish my silver sword
and I'll kill you
there's no mercy for the betrayers
I am Daltor the dragonhunter!
