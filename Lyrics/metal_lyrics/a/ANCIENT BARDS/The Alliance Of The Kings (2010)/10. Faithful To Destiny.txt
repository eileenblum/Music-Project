[Alron]
Oh Daltor, our fellow, you passed away
you left to reach the fields
where sorrow and suffering cease to exist
and your rage can rest at last.
I feel it, your spirit, it is with us
and it won't leave our side
your body may be gone but your soul is here
attending us in the Dark Cave

[Dorus]
For my lands, for my gods
i will find the holy sword
we can't fail, we're all mighty warriors
We will march, we will fight
only fate can divide
our legend from victory!

[Alron]
We promise your sacrifice won't be vain
we'll never stop the quest
and Dorus is given now the silver sword
that you let fall from above
I feel it, your spirit, it is with us
it gives us strength and hope
your body may be gone but your soul is here
it's guiding us to the Dark Cave

[Dorus]
For my lands, for my gods
i will find the holy sword
we can't fail, we're all mighty warriors
We will march, we will fight
only fate can divide
our legend from victory!

[Sendor]
il grande e forte impero
rifiorirÃ  nell'impeto
l'angelo oscuro nascerÃ 
notte e terrore porterÃ 

[Group]
furore ed ira giacion nel nostro cuore
crudele Sendor, figlio del tuo stesso male
il nostro cammino non si fermerÃ 
fin quando la giustizia non trionferÃ 
in pugno la spada, nel cuore la vita
negli occhi la speranza di pace infinita
il nostro cammino non si fermerÃ 
fin quando la giustizia non trionferÃ
