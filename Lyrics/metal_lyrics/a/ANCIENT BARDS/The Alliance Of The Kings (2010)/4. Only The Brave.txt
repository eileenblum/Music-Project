[Alron]
Making our way through the reign of the elves
We resolutely follow our path
The air is icy and sharp on this holy Blind Mountain
We must reach the dwelling of the oldest elf
We must never give up!
For our souls are bold and we don't know what fear is!
Arrows fly
From his eyes
The sun's hit by
A gold bow

[Rahed]
At my disposal my knowledge and life
To help you defeat this villain
In my heart burns only the red flame of justice
Power of arrows and glory of gods
Lead our way straight to the goal
For the peace of our lands we'll be victorious

[Group]
Arrows fly
From your eyes
The sun's hit by
Your gold bow

Mighty Rahed king of the elves, yes we need your help
That holy black sword must be found for the glory of the lands

This war won't break out
So precious blood won't flow
May courage walk beside us for eternity
Only the brave!

Arrows fly

This war won't break out
So precious blood won't flow
May courage walk beside us for eternity
Only the brave
shoot arrows in the
Sky from their eyes

Mighty Rahed king of the elves, yes we need your help
That holy black sword must be found for the glory of lands

This war won't break out
So precious blood won't flow
May courage walk beside us for eternity
Only the brave!
