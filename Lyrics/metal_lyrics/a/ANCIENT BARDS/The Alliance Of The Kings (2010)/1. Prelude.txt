The story I'm about to tell you,
happened long ago,
in a land far from here
It is not yet time for you to know about its genesis...

Until that moment Lastworld
seemed to be surrounded by eternal peace,
but nothing lasts forever...

Sendor,
the supreme dark wizard,
came to know about the existence of a mysterious sword
that gave its holder Absolute Power:
immortal life,
unbelievable strength
and knowledge of all magic.
Noone knew about the sword
except the four kings
from the four corners of the world.
The sword had been hidden in the Dark Cave,
in Noland,
under the cover of darkness,
and locked in a hidden place
that could only be opened
if the four weapons of the four kings
were revealed before it.

The existence of the sword was kept secret for its enormous power.

This is the story of the Black Crystal Sword.
