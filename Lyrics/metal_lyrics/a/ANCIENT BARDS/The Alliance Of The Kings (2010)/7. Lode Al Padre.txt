[The shadow]
We reached for the rainbow
And we followed the stars
Right now at the end of the day
Together we stay
The four magic weapons
Are finally gathered
as pawn of your dark evil plan
my mission's complete

You're gonna be the king
Everything will happen as before
The story will repeat
For this is Your will

Father I praise You father
This is for You
You'll be satisfied
Father I praise You father
Glorious mighty Lord.

The cave might be distant
But I'm sure you can feel
The flavour of victory
Already in your mouth
Trumpets will be playing
Your name will be invoked
The name that is constantly worth
My unreserved faith.

Father I praise You father
This is for You
You'll be sutisfied
Father I praise You father
Glorious mighty
Father I praise You father
This is for You
You'll be sutisfied
Father I praise You father
Glorious mighty Lord.

Il nostro cammino Ã¨ appena iniziato
ed ora il gruppo Ã¨ stato formato
e suoneranno trombe
acclameranno il tuo nome
il nome che non conoscerÃ  mai il dolore!

Father I praise You father
This is for You
You'll be sutisfied
Father I praise You father
Glorious mighty
Father I praise You father
This is for You
You'll be sutisfied
Father I praise You father
Glorious mighty Lord
Oh glorious mighty Lord!
