[Shena]
The kings are coming
from their lands
they're calling me
it must be serious
if this time
they have come this far

this visit
is unexpected
I'm anxious to know
no time to waste
lower the drawbridge
and open the gates

among them there's a stranger
I don't understand

the kings are reaching
the parlor
I'm worried as hell
the truth they tell me
is even
worse than I thought

I feel there's something
unusual
that's happening to me
I feel there's something
familiar
in Dorus's voice

in the look of the stranger
something makes me start

chaos-clearness
reason-madness
balance- sadness
crushing in my head

[Storytellers]
Luminous-skin with the look of an angel
Shena the queen of the Kerims of ice
mistress and guardian of Icy Forest
Beautiful lady so fair and pure.

[Shena]
Sendor is weaving
his webs around us all
the whole world's in danger

[Storytellers]
Luminous-skin with the look of an angel
Shena the queen of the Kerims of ice
mistress and guardian of Icy Forest
Beautiful lady so fair and pure.

[Storytellers]
The face of her majesty
reveals the clash
a weighty feeling is
growing in her frozen mind
she's staring at his eyes
she wonders what is tearing out her soul

[Shena]
The kings are ready
to take off
I'm leaving with them
I'm not at ease with
this perception
I have in my paunch

I feel there's something
unusual
that's happening to me
I feel there's something
familiar
in Dorus's voice

in the look of the stranger
something makes me start

chaos-clearness
reason-madness
balance- sadness
crushing in my head

[Storytellers]
Luminous-skin with the look of an angel
Shena the queen of the Kerims of ice
mistress and guardian of Icy Forest
Beautiful lady so fair and pure.

Luminous-skin with the look of an angel
Shena the queen of the Kerims of ice
mistress and guardian of Icy Forest
Beautiful lady so fair and pure
you can see in her eyes.
