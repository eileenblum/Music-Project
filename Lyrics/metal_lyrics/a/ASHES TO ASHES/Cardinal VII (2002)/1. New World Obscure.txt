A moth lands down on a withering rose
Like a silent mission from the dark
Drifting around chasing fading light
On a never ending search for shelter
It takes a million men to conquer the world
The moonshine englightens and covers it all
It's bringing them down, down in the fall

Like a thousand screams
Breathing down your neck
An all - Devouring dragon
Like a thousand down your obscure

Slave new world
A breed of slaves

The time has come for the brave to muster
In the crimson sunset they shall gather as one
Internal wisdom strengthens the powers
Hatred feeds the spark in their eyes
Bravens surveil the new world birth
To witness the changes in the earth
Mankind exceed and growing stronger
History repeats itself

Lizards evolves in the dusky horizons
A deadly challenge - Prepare to fall
Dwelling salvation - Lost creation
They are shadows of the holy
Spirits are restless and yearning revenge
Utter darkness tighten the clench
Souls that are true are hard to bend
But blood in the soil will tell of their end
