Came to life in shame
The lust one couldn't tame
Now taking it's toll on you
At first heedless and in denial
Then the longing
Became the confession

Can't resist - You're the reciever
And in awe you thirst and obey
You willingky drink from the well

In the dark
The darkest hour
I am the scream inside the scream inside the scream

Mesmerize
I always deliver
Tantalize
The needles and pins
Carved in skin and mind
The shiver down your spine
I'm the one
Behind the closed eyes

A call that seduces
Intrigues and entwines
In the place with no doors
In raptures you'll shine
Pulling you under
A heart that pounds
As the heavens resound
Breathe it - feel it
The carnal instinct running in your veins

Take my hand
And kiss the ring
I will lead you to the promised land

Like the lamb
To the slaughter
I will lead you to the promised land

In the dark
The darkest hour
I am the scream inside the scream inside the scream

Mesmerize
I always deliver
Tantalize
The needles and pins
Carved in skin and mind
The shiver down your spine
I'm the one
Behind the closed eyes

Mesmerize
Enslaved forever
Tantalize
By the venomous kiss
Grace you with the splendor
There's no end and no beginning
I'm the one
Behind the closed eyes
