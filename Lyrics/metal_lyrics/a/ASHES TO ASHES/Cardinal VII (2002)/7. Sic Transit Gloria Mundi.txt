Led towards the eerie distant
By seductive forces
Symbolic memories
Becomes false convictions
Obsessions pre - Ordained
Epidemic cult of perversion
The essence of man
Quintessence reversed
Twisted and bleeding

Run silent, run deep
Never make a sound
Surpress any feeling

Run silent, run deep
When hope - Becomes nothing
I shall ressuect

No silence broken with no tongue
''Sic transit, sic transit''
Leaving the stone unturned
''Mundi, gloria mundi''
Building castles of sand
''Quo vadis, qou vadis''
Thus passes the glory of the world
''Quo vadis domine''

Condemned to feed in the dark
Mundane pleasure
Make believe - Blasphemy
To fill the gaping void
Who are to tell
What heaven and hell harbours
The world is blood
To the shark in the raging sea

Run silent, run deep
Never make a sound
Surpress any feeling

Run silent, run deep
Whan hate - Becomes nothing
I shall ressurect

No silence broken with no tongue
''Sic transit, sic transit''
Leaving the stone unturned
''Mundi, gloria Mundi''
Building castles of sand
''Quo vadis, qou vadis''
Thus passes the glory of the world
''Quo vadis domine''

Waiting in the wings
Whan hope - Becomes hate
I shall ressurect

No silence broken with no tonuge
''Sic transit, sic transit''
Leaving the stone unturned
''Mundi, gloria mundi''
Building castles of sand
''Quo vadis. qou vadis''
Thus passes the glory of the world
''Quo vadis domine''

''Qualis rex, talis rex''
''Mundus vult decipi''
''Manus manum lavat''
''Sic transit gloria mundi''
''Quo vadis domine''
