You sense the thunder and chaos subside
Standind proud among all of their lies
Never to burn your eyes again and
Listen to their hollow words
And forever question what awaits you there

You're tasted sin
You're tasted truth
AS a blind you've seen the world

Bearing the weight of it all
Never to repent if it should fall

Can you remember - Will you remember
The days of lust and greed
No fortitude from the written word
Did prayers bring them closer to the savior
Or did they bleed

Falling to their knees
Questioning theis believes

You're tasted sin
You're tasted truth
To shed some light on the mystery

Bearing the weight of it all
Never to repent if it should fall
Through ages of no innocence
Nothing to confide in

Never wash the sins away
There can be ''No absolution!''
There can be ''Only one!''
