Beyond the dark dawn of time
Scriptures we don't understand
Walls of fear in the dim
Testimonys in the sand

The dark power awake
The ancient superior
A sacrifice to the sun
The feast for the gods has begun

The luxuriant landscpae's forlorn
Sacred ruins in the cave
The inheritance of the scorn
Reigns in this valley of the brave

A veil og mist moving swiftly along the mounrainside
The sanctuary appears abandoned and vulnerable
A call from beyond - There's a sigh
Now the curse will seal your fate
A dead calm sea encloses the place that should not be

And with their eyer wide open
They saw, they knew, they suffered
The pride of heaven and the dark existance
Will assail this sacrilege
