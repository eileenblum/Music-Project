Days of no trust are upon us now
The blind leads us all into oblivion
Visions are fading and torn apart
Memories are all that's left in a bleeding heart

Who cries for the mourning
Remembering those days of glory

Chasing shadows from a melting sky
Praying for a new beginning on the edge of time
Searching gor the answers but it all ends in lies
The meaning has slipped away now the dream dies

Cold winter winds
The lightning and the storms
Passing by

Cold winter winds
The lightning and the storms
Passing by
