Lost in the shadows
Left with a broken dream
The fire turns to smoke inside a silent scream
No God to follow
Nothing from all those years
There is only pain to fill our darkest fears

Our eyes are bleeding
The blind must lead the fool
And now we know we're locked inside a dying room
We are all hearing
The tolling bells of doom
And now we know we're locked inside a dying room

The dying room
