I hear the cold wind calling when the night comes down
I reach for the light beyond the night
I close my eyes to the lonley world
Now there is something waiting there

It's my only light
The power of my dreams
Never whay it seems
It's my only light
The power of my dreams
Never what it seems
Castle in the air

Embraced by the sea and the eternal tides
The waves and I will flow as one
No more pain, no more misery
I will cross to the other side

Rise above the pain so deep inside
Through a vision I will glide
Between the Devild and the deep blue sea
I will be no more
On wings of eternity
I'll fly forever for a world of only painted skies
With burning stars that never dies
