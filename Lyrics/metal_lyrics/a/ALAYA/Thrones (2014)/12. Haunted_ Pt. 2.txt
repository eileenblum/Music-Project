I've a thought for the worse, let's find a new way
To elevate our disdain, make it okay
Adjust the face, give it your own name
If it feels like home, then you've found a way around making right

Around having to take from your own
If that's all you ever have to know
You can leave every waiting hand to hold
Disgrace and vague resolve
