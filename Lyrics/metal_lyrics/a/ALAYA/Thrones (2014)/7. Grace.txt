He said I have respect for the dead
As much as anyone
It's all the same meat and bone

He said our hands can pull from the rest
The life to give us one
It's all the same meat and

All we need, we find ourselves
Take it home

Screaming to attenuate in a hell of blades

All we need, we find ourselves
Take it home

All we need, we find ourselves
Take it home
