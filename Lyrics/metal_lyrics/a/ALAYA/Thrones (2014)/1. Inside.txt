Collision led you bound
as blood poured from your mouth,
forward to the red that met with envy;
a phantom in the frame
to find her way inside.

Cut into the axial sinking teeth through tongue.

Tonight no one can take it away.
And before I find the words to explain
you'd kill me again.
So enjoy your last night.
