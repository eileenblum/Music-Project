Closed eyes don't wonder
Lead me under until it's over.
Vacant minds don't wander.
Make for cover, for those who sleep don't suffer.

"See how I could be bounded and count myself a king
were it not that I have bad dreams?"

Vacant minds don't wander.
Lead for cover until it's over.
Pray, we hide from thunder.
Never wonder for those who wake to suffer.

Vacant minds don't wander.
Never wonder, for those who sleep don't suffer.
