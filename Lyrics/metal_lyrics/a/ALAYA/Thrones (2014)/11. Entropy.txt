Dead skin will tear away, shed in thankless stares.
Align, fall true and sever.
Aim to erase a fault line.
Each breath like kerosene/breaking ache.
Complacent that I judge hell while feeding it.
Trace and amputate this well.
Broken veins may never hold their place again.
Fall true. Sever. Separate.
The end.
