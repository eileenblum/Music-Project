Mockingbird in fear of what's to come
Harken the sound of your haunt taking wings to the ground
Mockingbird in fear of what's to come
We need an angel to feed on, to lead us unclouded

When it rots, can we dig up the bones?

Stay in somber static
The sound of the white noise is here
There is no death, only transition
When it rots, can we dig up the bones?

Digging for skies, I've been buried here
You've been asleep, but we're wide awake
This house of hearts is our open grave
So tell them we're here, but we're here to stay

In somber static
The sound of the white noise is here
There is no death, only transition
When it rots can we dig up the bones?

Uncovered lies, I've been buried here
You've been asleep but we're wide awake
This house of hearts is our open grave
So tell them we're here, but we're here to stay
