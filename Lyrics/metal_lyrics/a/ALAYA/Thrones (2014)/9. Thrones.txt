When empty thrones have spoken you will know
the worth of souls.
Don't pray for those fallen, they don't relent feeding
from their own sense of failure/chasing ghosts.
And when they run screaming all the way, "We lack
the faith! We let it go!", when empty thrones have spoken, you will know the worth of souls.
You will know the worth of souls' frail grace.
Still, hold their place in arms broken of shape.
Yet, they are replacing anchor for their grave shallow
impression that fades when empty thrones have spoken.
You will know the worth of souls.
