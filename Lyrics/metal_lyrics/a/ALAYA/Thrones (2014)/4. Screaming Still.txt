God only knows
The people here have nowhere else to go, nowhere else to go
Can you see their eyes?
They're scared of what will happen when they die
Who the hell am I?

What you spill, is it worth its weight in surface
To reconstruct old frame, and shelter the soul
Hear it screaming still

Can you show me where the road begins or where it ends?
No I can't pretend
That all the places I have been have nothing to compare to this
And all your bliss

Save, for the other, worn all the same

What you spill, is it worth its weight in surface
To reconstruct old frame, and shelter the soul
Hear it screaming still

Bend the walls above your bed, you hear the whisper
Bend the walls inside your head, it calls your name
Things we cannot understand, we cover with the sleep
But in our dreams they are but tearing at the seams
