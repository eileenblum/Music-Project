Wakes show paths they chose
Unfold iteration as they call
After faded hope
We hold the wasteful within

Waves call cast intone
And turn our voices for their own
All we know, their stabilizing drone

Wakes unfold
Paths of breaking
Waves that claim us all
They hold our paces to their call

This relayed a sentence I caught
Passing as they sank
Left waiting, ever chained to harm's paces
Now we stray

Iteration as they call
After faded hope
Pacing to their call
All we know, their stabilizing drone

Wakes unfold
Paths of breaking
Waves that claim us all
They hold our paces to their call

Paths of breaking
Waves that claim us all
They hold our paces to their call
