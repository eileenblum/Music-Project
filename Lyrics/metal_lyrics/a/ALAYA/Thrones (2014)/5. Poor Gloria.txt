If I could speak endless truths
Would daylight cut through and wake us up from all we know
Or would it burn like eyes set to the sunset
West, to your skylit sable

Take care how you cut yourself with postmortem knives
Sweetness to heartless turns cruel
Sweetness to heartless turns to appetite for spiders and flies

Know what to say, ruminating
No farewell to matchless light
A closing thought to settle the end
We write and though the mirror shows
Nothing more than versed hope dying cold, remember

Take care how you cut yourself with postmortem knives
Sweetness to heartless turns cruel
Sweetness to heartless turns to appetite for spiders and flies

Come to terms with time
Relative to crossing distance of the mind
Call the ghost in through aperture
The mirror shows nothing more than versed hope dying cold

Take care how you cut yourself with postmortem knives
Sweetness to heartless turns cruel
Sweetness to heartless turns to appetite for spiders and flies

Take care how you cut yourself with postmortem knives
Sweetness to heartless turns cruel
Sweetness to heartless turns to appetite for spiders and flies
