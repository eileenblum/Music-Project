Hello, is there anyone there?
Are we the only breathing among the dead?
They'll reach out their hands, and drag her home

Where will you go, walk among the living
Dead help feed the lies below
They all will bleed their colors
So wipe away her tears, because her beauty is all in vain

Hello, is there anyone there?
The alabaster walls have stained her memories
They'll reach out their hands, and drag her home
Down, down underground

Where will you go, walk among the living
Dead help feed the lies below
They all will bleed their colors
So wipe away her tears, because her beauty is all in vain

Hello is there anyone there?
Are we the only breathing among the dead?
