Memories of habits during life,
Memories of carnal lust...
Two zombies driven
By reciprocal smell of flesh.
Two stinking corpses:
Finger taken off,
Swinging rotten heads,
Clothes covered with blood.
The dead touched each other,
Seeking for the reciprocal sexual organ.
Two stinking corpses seeking for
Sexual pleasure, memories of carnal lust...
Two corpses started to devour each other:
First the penis now dead,
After a long vaginal gnaving.
Memory of sex before becoming zombie...
the dead, ravished by excitement,
Started to destroy reciprocally,
Opening wounds all over their bodies
To attain the total collapse 
On The Ground just a heap of rotten organs,
Two heads taken off,
Still trying to bite, to eat.
Memories of habits during life...
Pool of blood and rotten flesh
in the house of the ancient carnal lust.
