Is there a Zombie love? I want to love a Zobie.
Love after death is the true reality:
My quick putrefaction helps me to understand my life... our life.
LOVE YOU IN DECAY
LOVE YOU IN DECAY
The person i love will be rotten at the point of death
I want to love her... with her taken off fingers,
With her cheek's tendons exposed to light wind, blowing by now perennial
to sweep away the organic remains whose fucked after death.
I want to love her until total destruction day.
I want to see fasting vermins upon us, upon us the stench of putrefaction
Our bodies pulverizing after the last fuck
To understandt our walking with dangling head and withered bodies
Maybe we are here to become a vermins mass
And will start wardening decomposing
Just then i'd like to smell the one final scent of death (and putrefaction...)
I want to love to hide time's defects, but now really love each other.
LOVE YOU IN DECAY
LOVE YOU IN DECAY
... and i'd like our remains to warder togheter forever.
I love you as you're Zombie. As you wat to taste with me the end.
