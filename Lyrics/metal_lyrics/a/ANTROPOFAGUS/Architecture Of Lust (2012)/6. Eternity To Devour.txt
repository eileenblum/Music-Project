Subterraneal creation, my body is under a pile of ruins
My rebirth requires sacrifices from your kingdom
Blood is an essence of my destiny,
I'm servant of chaos and I'm crawling silently

I will have to eat for eternity...
And death will rise!

Physical dissection pervades my memory
I leave this cold death

Locked in a attic, study how to nourish the prey
The taste of his muscles is the rebirth of my flesh

It's time to rise again, gory human leads me to immortality
Eternity to devour

Victims come into my room unaware of their slaughter
They see before an undead corpse
This new trip will be lethal for them
Muscle's fiber as a meal... this diabolical ritual is a sign of my return!

A possessed woman... she wants me to fuck!
Decieved soul, a bitch with no morals
...represents to me the last blood's path
Last portal for my bloody presence

In the world... the world of lambs
I will return!
