Behind this dimension,
Disarming the crossroad between death and lies
Imparting an illusion of carnal desire
Your eyes filled with conscientious weakness
On the knees with agony
Waiting for the rebirth of puritan

I reflect the light in your eyes
Eyes that bleed helplessness in front of my word
Useless waste of blood
You crawl on the ground like worms
Offer your mind to my will...
Why!?!?!?

Ire on srit durnat ezes rait
Iki on slait gret ro en tar
Za ihd slai iki on gelan asakan
Cir qu raam-nesi feron nef iki zait

I have no lord
The puritan ordering our bloody act
We holding the ancient secret in your hands
We are in praise before him

Cerebral illusions
Awaits us...
False promises
Reciprocated with pain...
Lies!!!
