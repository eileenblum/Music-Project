This beast is reborn in me,
Reclaiming the sorcery... in my universe.
Transcending the weak
And invoking the source
Torturing his body to see the unlighted reign
Painting my body with the blood of your veins...

Carnage!!!!!

Resuming my thirst for revenge
And choosing the perfect victim
The moon will draw the massacre's path...
I'm beyond control... and you're flesh for the beast...

Salvation - The creatures of Midian glorify your death
Refuse the light - Centuries of obscure submission
Have wiped my morbid darkside...
I'm a predator and you're welcome
To the depths of hell!!!!

The monster who I am tastes your agony
Impurity is my insanity
Fall apart is my brutality
My desire of blood hasn't morality
Your flesh is mine!!!!!

Run,
For fear of the afterlife
For saving your mortal soul
Step by step, I'll follow your breath

Stop,
And left to taste
Your guts will not be a waste
You turn your back to the light
Indulge in the land that rejects the sun!!!!

The monster who I am...

Run,
For fear of the afterlife
For saving your mortal soul

The beast takes meat
The beast desires flesh
The beast rising for human's blood
The beast will save the underworld
