Mutilated corpses around the room...
Fragrance of blood remains in the atmosphere
The breath of your pain is the awareness of evil...
The room of pleasure is ready for you
My love is all hooks and chains
Your orgasm is a hiss of suffering and pain!

Ready for the beast
Blessing upon my redemption

DIE!!! - The rebirth of souls
DIE!!! - Blood and pain
Cry - The seed of my madness
It's a controversial sadness!!!

This majestic whore
Pray to be owned by the cenobites
And the blood-orgastic benediction begins

Rit:
Blessing upon my redemption
The slave's world will soon be mine
Blessing upon my redemption
Guts and rigor will be my new creed

Gore, torture, blood
Gore, torture, blood

Sense of immortality
Seeing that my body is dismembered inexorably
Brutalizing my force to infinity
Invoking the day...
Of my decay

Mutilated corpses around the room...
