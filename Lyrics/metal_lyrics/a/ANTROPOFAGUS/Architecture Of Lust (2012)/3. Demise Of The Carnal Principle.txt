Covenant...
Nightmare...
Wretched premonition...

With massive force, the chains came out from magic cube
Tore my skin and changed my nailed face

Great temptation of the arcane enigma
Six old faces, a mysterious voice from the depths
Combination which leads to madness
Mind's annihilation for the secret

The time has come!
Demons feel the fear in my mind
Enter in your muscle with sharp knives
Baptized the floor with mortal's blood
Scattered guts as victories' trophies
...and the glory that will come to me
Covenant...
Nightmare...
Omnipotence in me
Demise of the Carnal Principle

Now, I command the circle of cenobites
Now, I'm the black pope

We are called to meet the most extreme pleasures
Ready to discover new horizons of suffering
Overshadowed any rays of light
We live to scatter pains of hell
