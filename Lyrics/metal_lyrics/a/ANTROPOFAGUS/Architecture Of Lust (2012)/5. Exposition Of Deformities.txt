A dark course has been set
The long road has been undertaken
Humanity has slaughtered our bodies
With absolute inhumanity
Tearing our flesh, without any sense of pity
With smiling faces, brutally pushed us into oblivion
Condemned to the eternal gloom

Derided in our being, scarred by your hands
Our punishment is mentioned in every lighted corner
From your alleged god
Abhorrent violence inflicted on our corpses

Used as a rejection of god's creation
Symbol of blasphemy for all mortals
The darkness we have taken in hand
Aspects of our deformity will be exhibit their grim fate

Exposition - Our flesh
Deformities - The sign
Exposition - Our dawn
Deformities - Our cabal

Derided in our being, scarred by your hands
Our punishment is mentioned in every lighted corner
From your alleged god
Abhorrent violence inflicted on our corpses
The darkness has given us new life
Aspects of our deformity will be exhibit their grim fate
