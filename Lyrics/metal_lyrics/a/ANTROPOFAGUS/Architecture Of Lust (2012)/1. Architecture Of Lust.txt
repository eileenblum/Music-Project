Abomination, Sodomy, passion for the flesh 
Desolation around your lost soul 
Coronation of the vile actions... 
All this has been created to give new life.

Before the Ceremony, the Cenobites evoke grief 
The sinister light 
Surrounds the place Of suffering 
The sway of the Chains.. 
The sadistic beating of the Teeth 
Prelude to the glorious torture!

Let us introduce hooks in your skin 
Our Chains are covered with blood 
Organs &amp; Bones decorate this temple 
We start with your sorrowâs level!

Architecture of Lust 
... everything is designed to study your flesh.. 
Sensitivity Dies under our blades 
Architecture of Lust 
Rending Pain

Terrorized by our appareance 
Cherished by our hooks 
Pierced without any remorse 
Slaughtered for the last ride 
Harrowing screams expand on the walls 
Shreds of meat decorate the floor 
Architects lust for the glory of darkness...
