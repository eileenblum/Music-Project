In the name of an unborn child
in the name of a progeny denied
in the name of my twelve names ...

I can create envy among humans
I take what I will never be for me
In the infinite universe ...

To procreate has no end
I can't have him !
My serpents will observe
the sufferings of mortals
powers of the gloom remove
children into nefarious nights.

Beast of the Apzu
chained to this fate
slave of the acts and consequences
of the hatred.

In the name of my curse
In the name of darkness
In the name of my putrid wombs
a sacrifice will happen every night
Abysou!

Rises the desire of vengeance
the blasphemy is lasting
over millennia...

Vile demon of no man's land
explore wombs invaded by sperm
devours every step of life
blood will flow through the channels
along your path

Stillborn...
to satisfy the hunger of the monster that she is!

"Suffer ...
Cries of pain!"

I can't have him !
My serpents will observe
the sufferings of mortals
powers of the gloom remove
children into nefarious nights.
Beast of the Apzu
chained to this fate
slave of the acts and consequences
of the hatred.
