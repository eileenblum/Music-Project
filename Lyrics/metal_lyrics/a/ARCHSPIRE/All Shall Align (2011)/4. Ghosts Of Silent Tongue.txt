The root of the human animal sprout,
From the eroded soil, of all things past.
Left to carry, free of breath and blood,
Fixed on our benevolent past.

There is no escape, from the powers,
Fed by, primordial aggression,
Which beats so effortlessly,
Through the hearts of man.
Yet we suppress,
To carry without true existence,
Descend in to the vile.

Ridden of purpose,
As each nerve exhausts
Transcendence through infuriation
At its base form.

Without engrained tendencies,
We impede indecence,
From this we rise.

Free the violent mind,
This is nostalgia for our paleolithic rights.
Bleed out incompleteness,
Abolish the inner fiend through chaos.
Confide in innumerable worlds.

Bleed.

Rule the self by releasing the source of self.
Let the ancients rush through you,
Bleed out the false god eternal.

Delve in the uncertainty of our Earth.

Bleed out.

Will to conquer purity,
Calm and extremity,
Torch emotion.

Be your God.

Will to conquer purity,
Calm and extremity.

Violent enlightenment,
Violent path of the enlightened soul.

When compassion subsides the self will arise.
Detest thy mother who's name be our realm.
For she is the whore of the monotonous heaven.
We are the Ghosts of Silent Tongue.

Violent enlightenment,
Violent path of the enlightened soul.

Praise the accursed and defiled,
Exterminate belief,
Vent through torture,
True self rise,
Be your God.

Scatter thy entrails before the savage beast,
Sacrifice the weakness of man,
Scatter our mortal burden,
Upon the scorched oceans of black.

Never shall thy fast from such innards,
Smother these offerings with the still-racing mind of your infant within.

Once placed upon this altar,
Thou are destined to become,
Thou are destined to truly live.

Free is the soul accustomed to the onyx,
Yet with all light withdrawn,
Illuminate the chasm of all things beyond.

Dwell not in the lifeless before you,
For thou has removed the place of it's former confinement.
At one with this truth we are enlightened,
At one with this truth we are enlightened by violent mankind.
