Leave this earth behind
Ascend upon the skies

To fruition comes the plan mapped by the allied sect
To appose the ghosts of tongue
All breeds vow to protect
To relinquish atrocities made by once mortal men
The self-fulfilling profits of natural orders descent

We will hunt them find them kill them on earth air fire and sea
Are elements will be our weapons, sculpt the laws of each

Take to the skies
Mute testimonies of the lost arts of antiquity

Strength encompassing
Ascendance to the summoning
Rise from earth

Conquer the live undead
Redeem our species
We are our elder's seeds
Transport in secrecy
Employ the recoil of all that is

Ancient burden not with pain those heroic that which ensue this conquest

Guide them unscorned through your righteous maze of burning stars

Follows now/ the internal/ process of /transportation to/ the collective assembly
Assurance of/ your return/ lay only/
----upon our full/ victory
First vanquish the repulsive pulse of fear that rots within

Release the mind release the flesh!!!
remove your eyes now
Sink your vision/ deep within/ your imploding mass/
What remains will follow
Cacophonic/ shrills leech/ the exhausted/
Dissipating breath out your throat into the air
The blood well/that lets/ from your/ ----
Dormant sockets hosts your soul
Let it billow/ from the fading/ flashes of your/ decomposing

Your self now filters up through the crimson mist
Of your empty shell. Become as light not seen
Yet to behold all sight without eye

To hear the echo of your banshee without the use of sound

All red encompassing/ not alone/ yet without the self
Threads of your past remain/ to engulf/ what now elevates
Thoughts form to you as skin/as beckons/ selfless destiny
A mockery of flesh/ serves now as/ your protective shield

The composition of your past/ frail recollect/protects you from awaiting / atmospheres/ alien to man
No longer are you human/ but a pure catalyst of man/
To join in the sÃ©ance/ on the planet/ where the eldest lay

Arrive encrusted/ in the ash/ of your scalded live/on the Omni ancients/ infinite/ resting ground
