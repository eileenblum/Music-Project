Man defies itself
Desecration of time and space ensues
Rising from beyond
Secreting dormant breathless bodies rising from our bleeding soil

Atrocities defying mortal's foundation of scientific probability under which we praise
Returning as the coexistent dead forms of the living subjects instantaneously transplaced
Captive in a dimension of torment to infinitely dwell upon the plateau of dead energy slaves

Hell it was deemed that which contained the lifeless versions of all things at any point conceived
Sadistic depictions of all forms of creation from every extension of molecular construction
Parade the deceptive lingering decrepit obscured contradictions of our cognitive creations
Indecent experimentations made flesh
Relentless pursuit of chaos

Enslaving our own kind

(Only those truly encased in their art experience life, this is mine.)

Consequences of endeavors
Altered by unseen forces
Limitless the Powers gained
By the soldiers who crossed over
To the scape of un dead
By harnessing with precision
The ringers attempt to transcend
Through there violent chaotic vision
Doppelgangers once discovered
Where held captive by researchers
Methods of interstellar travel
Where examined intricately
By an elite branch of psychic
Pawns of the military
In their remote hypnotic state
They tore apart the human subjects

--- outbursts controlled
Employed troops
To a sycophantic world

With blood now on their hands
They return from foreign lands
As enlightened super human beings
Of a secret psychic sect
Pursuing methods of serial chaos
To astrologically project

Arch spire

Abusing power. conflict ensues
A battle to rival the storms of creation

solvo validus navitas ignotus tenus omnis
(Release powerful energy unknown to all)

Neo morfic state
Eliminating plight
Neglect the sacred rights of the dead

(Let now this sound consume all senses within you)

All that is shall align
To end what we all know as time

all that proves sound in this world will be gone
