Die dreaming.

The visions of beings came to me while asleep,
With the implicit wisdom of the powers to awaken dream.
These creatures of many I am not dreaming of,
For my dream is as real as I can realize.

These sightings soon become increasingly cognitive,
I gain the knowledge of one hundred thousand alien species during R.E.M.
They have proven to be real, others can see them too,
We have been selected to join them beyond

Rapid Elemental Dissolve,
All Shall Align,
Align and ascend.

These things planted seeds inside of me nocturnally,
Breeding an alliance to defeat the Ghosts of Silent Tongue.

While inside my senses thrive,
A collective bond within the hive,
I feel our voices unite as they encircle me.

We have woken, all as one,
From our sleeping selves in that we rot.

Dormant no longer.

As it forms and speaks it's name, the Earth dies dreaming.

Mending deathless motion as we all become extensions of the eldest,
Our path reset to take no course by the laws of time.
We evolve from the flesh that once bound us,
A collective conscious joins to recreate the first molecule,
Born free.
Created is a new replacement life source,
One of massless, formless, endless presence.

As it forms and speaks it's name the Earth dies dreaming.

Forces of infinite origin have taken steps
to return our conceived cycle of life
to a structure outdating Earth.

Questions of transcendence follow now,
I must ask myself,
Does the alignment create the belief in the elite,
Or the reverse?

As it forms and speaks it's name the Earth dies dreaming.

The collective constructed a landscape of matter generated through a collaborative focus abiogenetically.

We will supersede the need for this dormant human body,
Disposing of this now fading shell by means of lucid dreaming.
And ascend as one beginning the war on sleep.

Alliance for timeless existence
has begun
Rapid Elemental Dissolve.

The end is what is and what will be combined,
when the Ancient one speaks it's name All Shall Align.
