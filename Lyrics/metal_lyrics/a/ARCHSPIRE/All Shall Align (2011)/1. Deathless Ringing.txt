what was once born of this earth..

now returns not of this earth...

breath less
bodies arise compelled by a grim unworldly force
___ ___
making host fresh blood to return to their domain
blood less

exhumed
feasting with vigor in our area of rule
vehemeth
plague manifest from this vision of future prelation
these beasts
not what once they where, mimic the prints of our kind with carnal detest

our cities engrossed in crepuscular massacre

putrid/ display of man/ never/ can they become

fueling an insatiable lust for normality
skinning one whimpering fragile face at a time

putrid/ display of man/ never/ can they become

deathless ringing

unforeseen, these replecants of vengeance, casting incessant horrors upon the innocent
to extinguish life in one horrendous instant
with what appear meek mortal hands they deconstruct..

skin and bone

remorseless detest for man

reign of dark reflect upon us

as/ they rise/ we fall/ before/ them

breathless
bodies arise compelled by a grim unworldly force
___ ___
making host fresh blood to return to their domain
exhumed, feasting with vigor in our area of rule
vehemeth
plague manifest from this vision of future prelation
these beasts
not what once they where, mimic the prints of our kind with carnal detest

the epidemic was unleashed when exploring the trafficking of humans
to unknown dimensions through gateways on planet earth

the first kin of pure evil, born without guidance
now induces its feeding spree
staining the streets with our blood
