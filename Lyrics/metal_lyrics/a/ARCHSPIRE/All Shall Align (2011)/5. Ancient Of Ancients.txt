The Great galactic assembly congregate upon the plains long before the time of man,
Where the species of all worlds collide in prayer in sacrifice,
Where the altar fires burn infinite,
They halt their feuds, and unite for the better of all creation.
For the all-knowing, all-seeing one,
To cast his vast, luminous and terrible rays across unfathomed myriads of worlds,

Altar fires burn infinite,
Come forth to free us all,
Oh great storm of elements.

[2x]
The concealed of the concealed ones,
The eternal of eternal ones,
The mystery of mysteries,
Upon your throne of flaming light,
The entity of entities,
The eldest of the aged ones,
The knowing of all unknowable,
Reach out to our hundred thousand worlds.

We await your return, when all shall align,
Through divine right, we embrace in whole,
The nature of your cosmic delineation.

The ancient of ancients,
Great storm of elements.

Awake the spiritually dead,
Into ever-lasting life,
Rise from the deepest, darkest bowers,
Of our universe.

Supreme one awake,
From your slumber,
To free the dead,
Limbiotic which haunt vacantly the planet of lost souls.

Let your serpent never mingle*,
Lest confusion exist within you,
Radiate across our skies,
To bring purity to the just and unjust of all beings.

[2x]
The concealed of the concealed ones,
The eternal of eternal ones,
The mystery of mysteries,
Upon your throne of flaming light,
The entity of entities,
The eldest of the aged ones,
The knowing of all unknowable,
Reach out to our hundred thousand worlds.

Come forth.

Engrossed below the alien monolith,
We witness opposing forces devour planets,
We suspend belief until your resurgence, father of time abolished.

Come forth ancient, arise,
To free the dead souls of our tribes.
