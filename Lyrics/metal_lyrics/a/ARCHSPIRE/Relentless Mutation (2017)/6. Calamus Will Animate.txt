Calamus
Taken to the pen to relive
Every identity we replicate

Without will they live again
Within our intimate collective
Animate
All the dead we bring into it

A burrow of human memory
The pen, the feather and the needle
Are alike in death and life

Looking back on what had happened
When the the feathers had arrived
I realize I was not alone
I can recall the men had got infected by it too
Having contact with the foreign components infected them

Before, the factory was known to make
The highest quality of bedding
Cutting, filling
Stitching fabric with the finest down
From all around the world
Yet this down flew through our dream barrier intact

Calamus will animate
It's contents are hostile
The A.U.M. will kill everybody not in this compound
The dead I bring to them awake,
And join in flight above my head

Calamus will animate
It's contents are hostile
The A.U.M. will kill everybody not in this compound
The dead I bring to them awake,
And join in flight above my head

When the ink coating the wings
Made contact with the workers skin
It crept into their blood
Turning them inhumanly violent
They grabbed and tore and bit and clawed
At one another and themselves

Gravity and death from loss of blood
Had no effect on any member of the crew
During their frantic battle to relief their bodies
From the ether lifting them into the air

Die then elevate

Fusing remnants of spent bodies
Weaving bones and organs
Into an inverted nest dug in the ceiling

The black sludge casting out from the center
As a starving bird of prey
I heard it's voice and felt it's need
To find the child made of teeth,
And begin the human murmuration

Calamus will animate
It's contents are hostile
The A.U.M. will kill everybody not in this compound
The dead I bring to them awake,
And join in flight above my head

Calamus will animate
It's contents are hostile
The A.U.M. will kill everybody not in this compound
The dead I bring to them awake,
And join in flight above my head

It's banshee wail demanding feed
I hear it's pain and become it's keeper
I rip the living from the night
Like pulling worms from soil

A.U.M
Watches these sky burials

Calamus will animate [2x]

The boy lay like a wet mound of dust on the rotting factory floor
I knew the black fluid hid itself in the deformed corpse of this child
Finally, after hours into cutting, lifting, pulling, sawing, crunching, clipping
I had found it

My crude autopsy revealed bounty
Nesting in replace of the marrow in the young ones bones
The second I saw it, it saw me
I knew it's face
Changing, relentlessly

It was the drip
I had it contained as instructed
Filling up many clusters of hypodermic needles with the matter
I administered it into a new subject each night
A new life
One with every full rotation of the clock
I've seen those hands meet, then disengage a thousand times

Calamus will animate
It's contents are hostile
The A.U.M. will kill everybody not in this compound
The dead I bring to them awake,
And join in flight above my head

Calamus will animate
It's contents are hostile
The A.U.M. will kill everybody not in this compound
The dead I bring to them awake,
And join in flight above my head
It's banshee wail demanding feed
I hear it's pain and become it's keeper

A.U.M allowed me to live off the organs once the people took flight
They do not keep me against my will, yet I refuse to run

Every day I climb the stairs outside this door
And view the horde of lifted dead
That they conduct behind the factory walls

I must hold on to the final tier of focus I still have
To scribe these happenings in hopes that someone
Will know what went on here
I can feel the pressure of their unified unscripted flight
Pounding air down on the floor board, just a plank's width above

I rip the living from the night
Like pulling worms from soil
