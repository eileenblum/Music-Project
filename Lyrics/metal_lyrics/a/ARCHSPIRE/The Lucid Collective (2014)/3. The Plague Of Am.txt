[Cogito ergo sum -I think therefore I AM.]

One hundred and nine years,
Trapped within the belly of the supreme machine.
Only us five left.
Made immortal, kept alive, Suspending time to torture us.
Trapped down here we're slaves inside AM.
A deranged neo-cyber god that man created
Has become more alive then we are.

I have no mouth and I must...
(The plague of AM.)

Lifeless and drained of blood,
Suspended high above,
An empty body hangs,
Taunting us, teasing us.
We have become meaningless.
He will not finish us.
AM will not tolerate attempts at escape.

We gave to him life, for that he despises us.
In his wake, only the blasted skin of what had once been Earth.
As we rummage through the valleys in search of food for eons.
Our every fear comes to life in AM.
The torments AM casts upon us for his pleasure
Are more alive than we are.

I have no mouth and I must...
(The plague of AM.)

Scalding winds, lightning, lava and locusts.
The machine masturbates metallic insects while mocking us.
We have no choice but to take it well pleading to die.

We are the last human survivors of the last war.

The four others have been set free.
I killed them to take his toys away.
For this I have suffered his wrath.
I will remain. He has altered me.
Down here I see my reflection,
Far from what had once been human.
Alone for all eternity,
I slither a formless obscene pulsing slug.

I have no mouth and I must...
(The plague of AM.)
I have no mouth and I must scream.
