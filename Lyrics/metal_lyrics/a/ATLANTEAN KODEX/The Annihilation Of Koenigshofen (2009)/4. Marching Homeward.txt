Foreboding mountains, threatening skiesBeyond these walls of stone, our sacred homeland liesTen years have passed now, since we left homeThe green hills of my country, soon my weary eyes shall see again From the black mountain a cold wind blowsStanding stones along our path bear marks of ancient runesMidst howling gales pounding of drumsWhisper turn to battlecries chaos soon will rise Beneath the black mountain we're lead astrayNever to see our home againBeneath the black mountain our journey endsNever to see our home again Black folk of the mountains, watching our flockDark shapes are moving twist trees and barren rockGreen feathered arrows take down the steedsThrown into the dust, we will journey to the island of the dead Blessed be the old gods, sacred warrior hordesBlue their painted faces, the clash of bronze swordsDark invocations grant eldritch strengthBloodshed for the blood god, we are dying in this godforsaken land Led to black mountains into the cavesNever to see our home againLiving and captive die in decayThose not sacrificed forever be enslaved Unspoken terrors lurk in the nightChaos, doom and sacrifice awaitGrotesque idols out of times before the lightTorture, death and slavery our fate Led to black mountains into the cavesNever to see our home againLiving and captive die in decayThose not sacrificed forever be enslaved Beneath the black mountain we're lead astrayNever to see our home againBeneath the black mountain our journey endsNever to see our home again
