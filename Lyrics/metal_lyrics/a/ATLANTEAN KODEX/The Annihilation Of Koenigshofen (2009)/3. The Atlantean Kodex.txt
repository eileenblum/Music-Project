Beyond the veils of timeWhere past and future intertwineWhere written history subsidesSubconscious memories ariseFive keepers hold the keysTo unlock the gate of dreamsBehind the wall of sleepWhere Choronzon lies in wait Behold the Urkraft, behold the sacred forceWe strike with the wrath of the rightfulWe wield the invincible puritan bladeBehold the fire, behold the forceWe command the iron battalionsIn the dawn of this new iron age Sorcerers of yore wove mighty spellsWhile swords met shields like ringing bellsIn places deep where dark things sleepIn hollow halls where dead kings weepWhere harps once sang with joyOf the splendour, now buried beneath the seas Behold the Urkraft, behold the sacred forceWe strike with the wrath of the rightfulWe wield the invincible puritan bladeBehold the fire, behold the forceWe command the iron battalionsIn the dawn of this new iron age The days are growing darkerAnd what the coming age might holdEven the wisest among us cannot sayAnd though some things are better left undisturbedWe must not bury the pastOr we will be buried by the future Heed to the - Atlantean KodexKneel before - Atlantean KodexBow your head - Atlantean KodexShare the madness, the fury and the might
