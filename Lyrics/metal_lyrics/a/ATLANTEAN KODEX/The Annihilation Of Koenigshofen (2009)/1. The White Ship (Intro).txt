Beyond the sombre blueOf distant horizonsI heard a song in the windFrom shining pinnaclesOf snow-crowned mountainsTo the dark heart of deep forests green Telling tales of the strange dreaming landsEast of the setting sunAnd there appeared a tall white shipTwist nights clouds and starlit sea And I followed the wake of the white shipCasting off modernitys gyvesTo the lands where I reignedBy my fathers side...again
