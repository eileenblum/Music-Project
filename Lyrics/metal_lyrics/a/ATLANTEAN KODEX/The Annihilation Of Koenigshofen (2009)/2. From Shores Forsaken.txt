Along ancient leylines down to the seaOn moonlit shores ten thousand meetNo words to be spoken, no thoughts to be thoughtWaiting in silence, as great magic is wrought Moonlit our witness blessed be the nightCalm be the waves may the winds be rightGods and great spirits fled from these landsEvil reigns by the black hand a few strong still stand And wind fills the sail we head for the seaHear destiny calling let east and west beWhat they may be just the ways of the wind Across vast oceans onwards we flyThe veil has been lifted the leavetaking's nighOnly our memories are bound to the soilFrom shores forsaken we leave this mortal coil And wind fills the sail we head for the seaHear destiny calling let east and west beWhat they may be just the ways of the wind "The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it." Leaving the shores wave no handsLong was our wait we're leaving todayStill on the dark waves seven tall ships lieGolden sails set morning star our guide
