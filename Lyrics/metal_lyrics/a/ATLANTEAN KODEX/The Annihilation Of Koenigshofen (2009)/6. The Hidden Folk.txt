"Where is the horse and the rider? 
Where is the horn that was blowing? 
They have passed like rain on the mountain, like wind in the meadow."

While ages passed, we dwell alone
Alone we wandered, died alone
'neath shadow green and standing stone
-'neath shadow green and standing stone
Far from the rule of modern throne

Beyond the veils of mistclad forests
As ages passed, we fought alone
'neath shadow green and standing stone
-'neath shadow green and standing stone
Alone we stand, alone we fall

As ages pass, we pray alone
-Alone we wandered, died alone
Alone with gods and gods alone
-Alone we stand, alone we fall
As guides to show us on the way
-'neath shadow green and standing stone
And light the road of the unknown

Our age has passed, we sail alone
-Far from the rule of modern throne
Into the west on ships of gold
-Carried by winds far from our homes
The evening star will lead us onward
-As guide to show us on the way
White shores are calling - ever home...

While ages pass, a legend's born
-Alone they wandered, died alone
Of shadow green and standing stone
-Far from the rule of modern throne
Who will remember the hidden folk?
-Who will bear the crown of oak and bone?
Borne on the wind their tale lives on....

Who will remember the hidden folk?
-Far from the rule of modern throne
Borne on the wind their tale lives on....
