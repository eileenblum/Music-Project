Once More the chains of time are fading
As the three-fold goddess shows her face
Neath dark horizons armies gather
Apostates tremble as we march

The godless heathens they cower in their crannochs
As we march forth from Autumn's golden mist
Ten-thousand Strong, in search for glory and wisdom
The ageless altars of reason now in sight

The gates of twilight open, a crown of oak and bone
Enthroned in stone and starlight
The goddess unfolds the path

Arise now from thy sleep*
Cast off the chains of guilt
Her voice is calling you
The goddess stands unveiled
In the light of the evening star**

Wooden idols gaze from solemn dead eyes
Witness to the pagan age
When blood was spilt in hope for summer and corn
And dead cold bodies lowered to the moors

The road to Keter beckons
Crown of the Sephirot
Vanquished is all iniquity
Dominion of timeless bliss

Arise now from thy sleep*
Cast off the chains of guilt
Her voice is calling you
The goddess stands unveiled

The goddess in the darkness spoke
Of days to come and empires to fall
Awake now! From the sleep of thousand centuries
The spell has been broken
Your soul is free to soar

For all the words unspoken, for all the deeds undone
For all our shattered dreams, for all the songs unsung
For all the lines unwritten and all our broken hearts
For all our wounds still bleeding and all our kingdoms come

For all loved ones never forgotten and all burning memories
Goddess take our hand, oh won't you grant us peace
For all that we are longing for yet we shall never have
Beyond the dreaming west, once we all will be healed
