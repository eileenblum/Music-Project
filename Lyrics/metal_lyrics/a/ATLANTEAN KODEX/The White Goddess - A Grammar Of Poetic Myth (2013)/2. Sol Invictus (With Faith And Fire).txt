[Dedicated to Paul Busson (1873â1924)]

Sol, Sol Invictus
Sol, Sol Invictus

In this holiest of seasons, twelve nights betwixt the years
The silence of winter is all-consuming
Our homesteads lie sleeping the old folks are watchful
Gruesome tales of corn-demons (to forewarn) the young
Over the mountain, to the hidden temple
Where the pillar of flames shall be summoned by the priest
On through the biting frost and the wind-driven snow
A belling of stags echoes in the woods

In this ice-cold Solstice night death and resurrection await
To invoke the rebirth of the sun

From darkness grows light, from ashes a fire
To conquer the cold
The rites of Yuletide defying the times
The virgin-born child

Sol, Sol Invictus
Shining Guardian of the west
In saecula saeculorum
Conquer with fire and with faith

A solemn pilgrimage through nightclad wintry woods
Ghosts of winter screaming to lure us all astray
Neolithic magick, wisdom without words
Bloodbound memories pierce the gossamer veils of time

In this ice-cold Solstice night death and resurrection await
And summer shall (fall on)** our soil

From darkness grows light, from ashes a fire to conquer the cold
The rites of Yuletide defying the times
The virgin-born child

Sol, Sol Invictus â Shining Guardian of the west
In saecula saeculorum â Conquer with fire and with faith

Blood-sacrifice for the three-fold goddess
Summon the Goat with a Thousand Young
Mithras Invictus Jesus Christus
Fire brings cleansing, fertility through death

Mummers rage through snow covered villages
Reaping the souls of the careless and young
Domina Perahta grant us good harvest
In barter for the blood of one third of our youth

The sunwheels are rolling, the hillsideâs on fire
From Albion to Attica old Europeâs ablaze
Unbroken tradition, neolithic bloodline
The Horned God approaches, the chanting now fades

Il dyi ei ischturien. Ei ven ad esser sarain.
Ei ven freid. Dieus mora!

At the standing stones the scythe will set him free
Bound to the oak, the Kingpriestâs life for our creed
A crown of mistletoe, reborn for all to see
For a new year, in a red dawn, as the new sun

Sol, Sol Invictus
Invincible sun of the west
In saecula saeculorum
Conquer with fire and with faith

From Atticaâs green pastures to Albionâs white shores
From Thuleâs boiling geysers to the walls of Hagar Qâim
Beneath the fragile crust of this modern age of reason
A darker world lies waiting, primordial and pure
Hidden in the shades from ratioâs great*** pondering
to rise when the stars are right

Sol, Sol Invictus
Lightbringer of the dreaming west
In saecula saeculorum
Conquer with fire and with faith
