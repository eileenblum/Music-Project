A maiden by the seaside was taken from her land
On a bull across the waves until she reached a foreign strand
Her father, a great king, less human than divine
True godhood she would find - Twelve stars in azure skies

Stronghold walls of Uruk, Etemanaki's fane
Mighty rock of Zion your legacy remains
Aeneas left his mother Troy, summer birds search for new lands
The goddess sends her siren's call, across the continents

On a strong white bull, the goddess rides
In the darkest night twelve stars will rise
Daughter of the east with an azure gown
Our new Jerusalem we found

And I saw brothers fighting, not for honour but for gold
Enthralled by foreign agents like cattle we are sold
Oh goddess grant me an answer! Pray, make me understand!
Will the brothers fight forever? Can they be as one again?

The goddess speaks:
"My son. War is forever. He's the father of all men
But brothers once united will stand as one again
My touch was felt in Dublin, my voice was heard in Spain
Ten thousand years may pass by, but this fortress shall remain"

There are shadows over Athens and Rome still lies in flames
In these days when need is great, there's no heroes there's no saints
But when the night is darkest, Prometheus' torch will burn
And the goddess on a white bull - though she never left - returns
