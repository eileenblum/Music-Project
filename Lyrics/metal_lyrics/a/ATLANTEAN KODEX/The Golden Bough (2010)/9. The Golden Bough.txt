My longing heartIs filled with lightsWith lost bellsWith silver spires and starsAnd I will wander very farFarther than those hillsFarther than the moonTo beg the Lord"Grant me the Golden Bough"To give back the soul I hadWhen I was a childRipened with legendsWith a blossom crownAnd a wooden swordAnd thousand dreamsStill to be dreamt
