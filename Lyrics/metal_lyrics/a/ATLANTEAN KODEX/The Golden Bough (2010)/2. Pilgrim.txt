From dreaming halls beyond the westThere strong and free a storm will riseA boat it bears with biting breathAnd a pilgrim from the lands of hopeBeneath the moon and under starsHe will wander far from western strandsWhen need is great through Europe's nightUnknown to mortal men The years have passedOur ancestral Henges awakePilgrim! Wanderer!Truth-bearer lead us to warIn hallowed halls our horns resoundPurify this holy groundAnd from the ruins of EuropaAgain we shall rise He will come unto the timeless hallsWhere shining fall the countless yearsAnd endless reigns the Elder KingUnder Mountain, ravens circle the peakAnd the pear-tree shall bloomOn Walserfeld plainThe king will rise from the throneAnd sweep these dogs from his lands The years have passedOur ancestral Henges awakePilgrim! Wanderer!Truth-bearer lead us to warIn hallowed halls our horns resoundPurify this holy groundAnd from the ruins of EuropaAgain we shall rise The world is grey, the mountains oldOur people's hearts are ashen-coldNo harp is wrung, no silver trumpet callsThe darkness dwells in Europe's hallsYet we still remember, we few who dwellIn this far land beneath the treesThe truthThe lightThe dreaming golden spiresThe starlight on the Western Seas
