So you drank the bitter waters
The salty wine of death
What cries the west wind? (Cry the west winds)
Iron wave hands took your breath
Pale moonlit coasts repeat the answer
Sighing dark mechanic mills
Cease your ever-turning mourning
Shine forth upon our clouded hills

Waters could not have killed you
Nor fire, Atlantis, my friend
Downfall grows in the hearts of man
But the west wind recalls still your sound
So we plant in the abyss
A tree that lifts your ground
We will see Atlantis again

O land of green, oh land foreseen
Where did you go?
O land of green, oh land foreseen
Gone long ago

Seven wanderers still living
(In memory) blue mountains now island hills of green
The keep burning the desire
The rise of Atalant foreseen
