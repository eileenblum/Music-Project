Like gold fall the leaves in the wind
Long years numberless, as the wings of the trees
The long years have passed into the west
Beneath the blue vaults, wherein the stars tremble
In the song of the wind

From the forests and the green mountains far to the east
To the hills of Franconia, dreaming in peace
See the fields full with grain, shining like gold in the sun
Oh land of my youth and old age

As the Danube rolls slowly to the seas of the east
Tall keeps of Bohemia are guarding the Reich
Land of proud halls
Where legends resound in the night
Oh, land of once and forevermore

Through years of longing we march
From here to the end of the world
I lead my folk to the gate
Where past and today become one
Through years of longing we march, as seasons pass us by
Relentless in our stride, we enter the mountainside

Standing stones guard the tombs
Of our fathers long gone
Und the oaks, proud like titans defying the sun
Telling the tale of the days when our folk still was young
And took these lands as ours

I remember the time, I remember the place
I remember the woods, where I first saw her face
Now the winds from the east strike fear in our hearts
Lost are the days of our youth as we part
Oh, Upper-Palatinate!
Where have you gone? Once proud were our ways
Now all barren hills lie covered in shades
Our past but a dream, no stars light us home

Through years of longing we march
From here to the end of the world
I lead my folk to the gate
Where past and today become one
Through years of longing we march, as seasons pass us by
Relentless in our stride, 
We enter the mountainside

When winter comes, the winter wold
That hill and wood shall slay
When trees shall fall and starless night
Devour the sunless day
When wind is in the deadly east, then in the bitter rain
I'll look for thee and call to thee
I'll come to thee again!

When winter comes and singing ends
When darkness falls at last
When broken is the Golden Bough
And light and labour past;
I'll look for thee and wait for thee, until we meet again
Together we will take the road beneath the bitter rain!

Together we will take the road that leads into the west.
And far away we will find a land
Where both our hearts may rest.
