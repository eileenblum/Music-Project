A black wind of pain is cleansing the land
Crushing the sons of the prophet
As tolerance has failed
Feel no remorse, feel no regret
For our children to live their blood must be shed
Invoke the true name of God (Shemhamforash)
Reclaim these once free and mighty lands

The spells of the temple bring doom to their halls
Their empire is dying, their culture will fall
Never yield! Never lay down your sword!
Drive your spears through the heart
Of the Saracen hordes
The oath has been sworn
Three spells will be cast
For Katholick Magick and metal will last

Invoking the sigil of
Saint Michael the Warrior
Defender of Europe
The first spell has been cast

Invoking the sigil of
Saint Andrew, the Martyr
Protector of Europe
The second spell has been cast

Invoking the sigil of
Saint Mary, the Virgin
Mother of Europe
The third spell has been cast
