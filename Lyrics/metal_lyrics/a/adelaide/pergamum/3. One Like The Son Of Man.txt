Sent from above To unleash seven plagues
With the first comes a white horse
The rider held a bow
The second spreads disease that made brothers kill brothers
He died for me as he did for you
Saved by his grace
Step it up
Your end is near as locust fill the sky (They fill the skies)
You had your chance to pray for forgiveness
You had your chance
With the third comes a black horse
Salvation belongs to my God Who sits at his throne for you
You had your chance to plea for forgiveness
The fourth one came to heal disease
look inside you heart
Take a look at the sky
Take a look at the black sky
Your End is Near
