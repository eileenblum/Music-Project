So if I don't even try I will make no mistakes
Expose my flaws
Because in the end I yield no gain
procuring life by epiphoric means
Bring me forth, for I have tried
This is a lesson that ends when life has ceased
Sick of lifeless faces staring at blank walls
I see what you're becoming
Follow me to these abysall graves where you slave for false lords and become
your fear
Do you live for this world?
Sick of these lifeless faces staring at blank walls I see what you've become
Rot in this life of unrepentance
Decompose in your anguish
swallow every distasteful drop of sludge
I have seen these demons and the obscurity they inflict upon your shadow
They cannot hide
I'm screaming through this withering corpse
Passing off a final breath
Sleep now, your choice has been made
Overwhelmed you repress your mind from my words
This is the way we roll
Temporary subdued extinction
