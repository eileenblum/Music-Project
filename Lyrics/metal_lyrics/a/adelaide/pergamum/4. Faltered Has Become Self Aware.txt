Silence is what you should have had since the start
You should have realized defeat but you're already damned
Walk this path that you have strayed
I used to be just like you, cold and alone
I used to live like you, but now I have hope
This is what I have and what I am
I walk this path that you have strayed
You can't deny
Fall apart as I watch you try
Disobey and deny what can't be destroyed
Hope you have enjoyed your time and you die with every lie
