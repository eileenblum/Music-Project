Pray that this message will spread with haste and be honored
For not everyone has faith, but the lord is faithful
For not everyone has faith
He will Strengthen
He will Strengthen
This massive heap is falling I cannot see
This Burden will surely represent the death of me
May he direct our hearts into love
May he direct our hearts with Perserverance
He strengthens me
For you yourself should know how to follow
Don't bend under the weight of the world
For some prophets of this church are hollow
Pray to be delivered from the wicked man
For not everyone has faith but the lord is faithful
He shall not Forsake
