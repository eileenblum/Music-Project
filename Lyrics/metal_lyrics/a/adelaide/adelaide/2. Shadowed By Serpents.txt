Come gather 'round my children
Sit back and hear these words that flow so freely
Sit back and hear these words
Like a lamb to the slaughter we are lead
So blind to truth so innocent
Stay true through the false prophets
They spread lies
God show us your light, lead us through this darkness
God show us your light lead us through this armageddon
Come Gather 'round, my children, come
