As I lay awake
And watch the room's slow decay,
I'm breathing heavy, I have chosen,
And this is the only way.
And as I scream the whispers
And I listen for delay
Wander through the smoke and mirrors
And i'll live as one, as flame.

Seeing past the answers,
Looking through the sky

Learn to see, view it all,
Breathe, and close your eyes

Revel in this overthrow,
Silence is denial,

Burning shallow symphonies,
Leave this all behind.

I am carved and painted
In glorious display
I am living, and golden,
I am parchment, I am clay.
I have no fear, no weakness,
The walls are whispering my name,
I am power
I am perfect
I will live as one, as flame.

Seeing past the answers,
Looking through the sky

Learn to see, view it all,
Breathe, and close your eyes

Revel in this overthrow,
Silence is denial,

Burning shallow symphonies,
Leave this all behind.

So, have you learned to see, open up?
Fear reduced to charcoal,
And in passion, you will find it all,
In this flame, you will become whole.
