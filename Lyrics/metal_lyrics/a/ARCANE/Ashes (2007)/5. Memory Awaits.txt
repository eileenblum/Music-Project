The light washes over me
Awake, but unfamiliar...
another day of memories awaits

I'll breathe for you, I need you here,
shadow of an embrace
another path, another love or hate

These memories await you,
they may not seem your own,
nothing awaits but what you choose to know
these memories await you,
proof waits for the blind,
nothing anticipates like what you've left behind.

I am not afraid of memories...

These memories await you,
a path, a state of mind,
nothing awaits but what you choose to know,
these memories await you,
proof waits for the blind,
nothing anticipates like what you've left behind.

It's alright.

It's alright.

It's alright.
