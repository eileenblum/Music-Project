[Part 1: Awakening]

Accelerate.

[Part 2: Aware]

Finally awake,
Millennia of slumber,
Finally aware,
Infinite cracks in the mechanical monolith.

Final understanding,
An open mind will see,
Her light is where it all begins,
And ends, and through Her, man is free.

Bask in light that surrounds,
Revel in warmth, Her grace,
Forget.

Infinite cracks in the mechanical monolith,
Infinite cracks in the mechanical metropolis,
Infinite cracks in the softest flesh.

[Part 3: Power]

So powerful in our abilities,
Creating more than we could be,
Destroying every inch of flesh
Our eyes would let us see,

We opened up our consciousness.

More powerful
Percentages rise
More powerful
Test patients die
More powerful
Adoration for those still alive

We were never aided
By our own creations
We simply made up better thoughts
And put them on display

[Part 4: Machinations]

Mankind eroded
Mechanical custodian
Our new angel of Death

Dust fills the sky,
Blood in the tides,
Helpless to our own machinations.

[Part 5: Revelations]

As her light reaches us
Rising on a new day
Light touches air
Already full of past mistakes

She claims more satellites
Unbeknownst to those below
Who continue breathing
As the ruins glow.

Never faltering in her release
Weâre swept away by tides of light
She becomes aware
Of her presence in the sky
Her presence in our lives

She is awake, She has become,
Real, imagined, mother, father
Life, death, light and shade,
Blood and water, She is made.

Look on and smile,
At the rise of a new god.
The rise of a real god,
We welcome the Dawn.

Infinite cracks in the mechanical monolith,

Infinite cracks in the softest flesh.
