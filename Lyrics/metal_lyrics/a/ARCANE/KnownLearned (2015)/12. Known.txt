Don't forget what you've learned
These long lessons
The bridges you burned made the world turn
And times when, blood to the bone
Hand in hand
Live your life chained to the stone
You'll be home then
We'll have time then
I know you'd like to believe what you're told
With your eyes closed
But knowing gets old
Don't forget that you will always be my little girl
My sweetheart
My sweetheart still, when I'm gone
We'll have time then
Don't forget who we are
Like deep ocean will mirror the stars...
She loved you
And I miss her too.
