Maybe I haven't been all that honest
Maybe I wasted my time
A sudden kindness
At the last
I find myself hanging on here
This is the end I had planned
Bring me love
Bring me this quiet breathing
Hand by hand
Counting the end of my rope
I still have rope
This is where my fight ends
I deserve no more than I've made for myself
Black stones in the well
This has been the only love I've ever known
Whispering a goodbye.
