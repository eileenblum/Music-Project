I had an instinct to run
I had an instinct to fly
We had it all figured out, you and I,
Traced endless roads in your skin
We walked the water we owned
I had an instinct to run
But I was flesh and bone... for once.
Down by the water she fell
We promised blood to the bone
Dive headfirst into the well
Where I was welcomed home
With open arms
I had an instinct to run
I had an instinct to fly
We had it all figured out, you and I
We ran out in colour...
We ran down like water
