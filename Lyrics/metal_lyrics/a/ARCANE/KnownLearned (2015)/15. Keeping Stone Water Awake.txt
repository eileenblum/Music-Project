Wait for night
If you can't wait for me
Wait for night, oh night
If you can't wait for me
What was lost
What was left here
What is old
What is over
What I need
What I kept here...
No...
"She'll go far"
Were your words
Know that she'll go far
Hold me here
As I drift toward the end
And all coming so fast
We've saved the best for last
(Just breathe, it's only water)
What was lost
What was left here
What is old
What is over
What I need
What I kept here...
Know that she'll go far
When the water comes
I hope that you'll be ready
To just drink in deep until you drown
When the water comes
You'll swallow down your words
The things we know now
She'll go far
Just breathe it's only water
What was lost
What was left here
What is old
What is over
What I need
What I kept here...
No... she'll go far
