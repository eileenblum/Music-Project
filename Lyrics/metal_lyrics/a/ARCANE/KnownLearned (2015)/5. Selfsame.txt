You just keep fighting the war we sent you on though it may not be true you wage
It on and just like waking up you fight your war
You just keep walking that road, over and gone, burden's a dreaming that you
Won't give up on and we are waking up, to fight your war
Give me the voice to be heard and I will fill my lungs before long
I'll cry the end of the world haven't you heard?
Your selfsame, gone, you just keep singing the same tired old song
Your war with none left to blame
Echoes life long a time for waking up a time for war
Give me the voice to be heard, and I will fill my lungs before long
I'll cry the end of the world haven't you heard?
Your selfsame, gone
The peace we find
That selfsame lie
Will end for none
Till it is done
Another name
Drowns just the same
We stood and swore
To end this war
I fought my war, and with my words
I find no peace in waiting
Give me the voice to be heard
The weight, the water wear their consequences.
