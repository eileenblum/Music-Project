I will dig two graves for us
Just want to see this enemy gone
There is no time
I just want to see this enemy gone
The war that leaves us all behind
I can see it in your eyes
The seed inside us multiplies
Caught you again, I know your face
You played the snake, you promised me
King in your world made out of glass
We'll wait to see just how long the liar lasts.
Call me the cancer wrapped in skin
The mask you bear is wearing thin
I can see you in the light
Questioning mine
But these unturning eyes
Are leaving us all blind
THe anchor between us drags us down
And in those depths, we will both surely drown.
Reach for my hand, I offer peace, please brother
Take it, we will find release
"Keep it!" he said, "I wish the ground beneath your feet would give way,
There'll be no peace! I am the hand that bears the knife's weight!"
I will dig two graves for us
Just want to see this enemy gone
There is no time
Just want to see this enemy gone
So bring me the end, bring me that fire
Breathe in smoke and spit out ash
The snake won't admit it
But it's certain now that this too
As all things, shall pass
I can see you in the light
Brother of mine
With these unturning eyes
We left the whole world blind
It begins now
You hear that voice from the crowd...
Finally, fear in your heart, that old stone
This is how it starts
We've waited for it
We've been begging for it
And it won't be long
Until we're raising our voices in song
We are the voice of the crowd
We are fire aloud
We are the ones who stood first
The hill and the stone
The deep and the thirst
We are the voice of the crowd
We are fire aloud
We are the silence at the end of sound
Listen closer, perhaps you can hear us now...
We believe that the man who brings his heart is home...
If the fight isn't over, then let this be known;
We'll go down by the sound of the songs that we've sung
And I welcome the drowning
Fill these empty lungs
And I know that there's nothing that waits for me there
But the peace in the silence
I've earned it I swear
In the face of unturning eyes
I have no fear
There is no god, and I am standing right here
Open arms to my brother
I say: "Welcome home"
Find the peace in each other
We've waited so long
Neither question nor answer will come from above
Bury hate with the coward
The answer is love.
