Light folds you to me
I hold you in new sheets
I see her in you
I follow you into sleep
And I must
And I will
I'm still here
Just you and me, little one
I'm still here
Never let go
Calm, there's more time than you know
Slow, don't grow just yet...
Stay like this
Stay right here
Stay with me
And I must
And I will
I'm still here
Just you and me little one
I'm still here
I'll never let go I swear
Still here
And I must
And I will
I am better, now
Can you, little burdens, show me how?
I swear by her eyes that you won't be alone
And I will
I will build a home
I will, with these hands, will build a home
And I must
And I will.
