A sea of one thousand
Chained to the stone
One thousand years waiting
Bury the seed we've sown
Keep your thunder
Roll your bones
The water in your lungs
Is all you've ever owned
...And all you know.
Keeping stone 
(Affliction and desire)
Keeping stone
(Silence brings the liar)
Face it, your lies end alone
Wait, my brother
Patience, this fire will soon become light
Keeping stone 
(Affliction and desire)
Keeping stone
(Silence brings the liar)
Keeping stone
But I will stand and raise a voice like sound on fire
Water awake
We will sing your end with every breath we take
Keeping stone
Face it, your lies end alone
Wait, my brother
Patience, this fire will soon become light
We will make it right
