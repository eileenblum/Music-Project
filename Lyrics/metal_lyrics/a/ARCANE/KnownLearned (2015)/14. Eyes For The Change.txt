Everyone's been waiting for my starryeyed advance
But I'm on the final page
The text has nothing left
The keys keep whispering my death
And my eyes are screaming out my age
We've been looking out on the infinite recursion
Just been wasting time
Something makes me smile
I tell it to the walls
And I know what I have made mine
I can look over my shoulder
Just to check
Just to be sure
But love is old
You can be more
You can sit with your eyes open
Damned to crack the camel's back
But I am strong today.
