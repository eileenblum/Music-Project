Into my arms
Bathed in sunlight
Focus meets calm to pass the oldest time
It can't be wrong
To fade like this, unknown
Over and on
Over and gone, she was...
What I would give to stay here, I'm longing
To throw my charge to the fire, embrace nothing
We drink it in
To find ourselves at home
we sang
Over and on
Over and gone, she was...
