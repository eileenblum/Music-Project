Weight of the world
Coming down's always harder...
You're fighting yourself
Nothing left but time to make you a liar
There's always time
Enough to conquer my will
Wait on the world
I am down soft beside you
I've never been closer than now to life
And love
We are as nothing as it gets
And that is all you need
And I am just a memory
Far from fragile
As I live and breathe
And we were sleeping children
Without voices
Neither sound nor sight
And I can't face tomorrow
Let the music be my blood tonight
We are still learning
Again and again
Soil...
Bleeding the fight from me
This contemplated toil
Dig through the soil
To find that we have none
Treading so soft and lightly down
Wearing the scars to remind me now
Wait for it
I swear I will die for it...
You're safe now
Home
Soil
Bleeding the fight from me
This contemplated toil
Dig through the soil
To find that we have none
Home is right here.
