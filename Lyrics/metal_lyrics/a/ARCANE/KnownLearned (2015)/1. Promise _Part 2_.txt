'Hope is all I have'
He called out over his shoulder
To no one at all
Lost in the wind went the word
Never heard by the one
Over and on
He sang to the silence at night
An answer would never come
(He hoped for... longed)
Till caught on the wind came the word
A whisper, the wilful;
'Come home'
Over and gone
She waited
He would travel far to find her
Finally she breathed her answer...
Over and gone
A promise kept is all that's left
Nothing changes
Over and on,
Over and gone, she...
Over and on,
Over and gone...
He sang his own funeral pyre
Eyes lost in the last breath of fire
Caught in spiderweb family ties
Lost in dreams of a child with her eyes
Over and gone
She waited
He would travel far to find her
Finally she breathed her answer...
Come to me, my softest memory
My sweetest mistake
Eyes open... please wait...
Don't fade...
Wait for me.
A promise kept is all that's left
So by the window she waits
Singing
