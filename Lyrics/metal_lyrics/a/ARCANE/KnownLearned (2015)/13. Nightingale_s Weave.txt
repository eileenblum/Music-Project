Never wanted any more than
All you provided me
Fighting gravity
Dust in the shape of you
Stares into shadow
But I can still see you stand
Building a home
Tell me you know these hands
Not hers, but mine
Father, I know you...
You're holding onto this moment
I see you, you're trying to stay
BUt this is it, just quietly go
Please.
There is no more to say
Hard enough to know you're gone
I'd wished for one more day, but
If this is it, then let it be now
Let it go, please
Drift away
Never wanted any more than
You provided me
Fighting gravity
Dust in the shape of you
Stares into shadow
But I can still see you stand
Building a home
Tell me you know these hands
Not hers, but mine
Father, I know you can
Hold onto this triumph
Father...
Lay your head down
Your work is done
And I'm alright
Please, father
Lay your head down
Deep ocean mirroring the stars
You gave me my heart
