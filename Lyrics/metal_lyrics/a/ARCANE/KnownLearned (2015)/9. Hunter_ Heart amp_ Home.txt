Tiny man sings his own lullaby
Into blue eyes
Born in this room
No windows or doors
He whispers:
"Home is right here, my love...
Between my back and yours!
Home is right here, my love...
(Between my back and yours)
Skin to skin
She rises gently
Resting safe where fire meets water
Rising hands chase shivers
She sang to the hunter
"Heart and home is all I hoped for,"
Hold
Oldest man knows the world's not the same
He gave more than most to conquer his change
Here in this breath, sweet joining of souls
The broken is mended, the unfinished whole
Home is right here, my love...
(Between my back and yours)
Skin to skin
She rises gently
Resting safe where fire meets water
Rising hands chase shivers
She sang to the hunter
"Heart and home is all I hoped for,"
Hold
Soil
Bleeding the fight from me
This contemplated toil
Dig through the soil
Hunter
Oldest man knows the world's not the same
He gave more than most to conquer his change
Home is right here.
