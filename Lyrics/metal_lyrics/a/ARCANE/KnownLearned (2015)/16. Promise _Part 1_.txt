He would travel far to find her
Finally she breathed her answer
She'd been waiting by the window
Finally he held her close...
And did not let go
She had kept it safe and secret
Standing silent by the window
Finally she breathed her last
For what she had to give was final
He held her
He had made a simple promise
Whispered in their final first kiss
Cradled in his arms, she lay still
Never made it home...
But she will.
