all speaking tounges and backwards
voices fading through the fire Cthulu loves you Leviathan pulls you
screaming down into the mire

my windless angel is the only thing inside
that's real I'm drawing down the moon inside to see if I can feel

I'm drawing down her fingers to seal my eyes
to steal my lips to still my sighs in pyracanthean bed of sorrows
asleep in aphrodite's lies

and I've given in to all you are and lie
below your falling star I'm reaching inside this bridge of sighs to
make believe as your truths become lies that all I try and all I do

are all I was and all I am and all i'll
never be all I was all I am you are all I never see inside the moon...

I'm drawing down the moon I'm drawing down the moon
