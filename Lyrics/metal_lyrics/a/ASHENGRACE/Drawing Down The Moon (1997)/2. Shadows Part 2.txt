and there's a shadow beneath the sun
and shadows in the valleys where we run
the darkest corners will sing out loud
to hear all of heaven's sounds
in the time it takes to slowly slip away
we smash the silent years into a day
take a chance, why don't you try
to take your dreams to heaven's skies
and the sun sets in the hollow of your eyes
I feel your shadows swim within my empty halls
and your shadows remain just like the Ring
the one to rule them all.

roll your fate with the dice if you lose you pay life's price
and when this moment slips away
you open your eyes to shades of grey
and as your window closes tight
your shadows swim across the night
it takes a moment to close your eyes
and keep them closed, oh keep them closed
(keep them closed)
'till all dreams die.
