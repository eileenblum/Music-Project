I'm breaking windows in the hollows of your eyes..
slip inside your well of souls to drift out with the tides.
The writhing, breathing, ragged holes
hang like children in my eyes
and hold me down beneath your lips
and swallows me alive.

and maddening your voice is in my head,
lead me to your flower bed
and every fear and every dread
are all the dreams I dream instead.
You are the leaving
that leaves nothing left behind
but this heart and this hate
and this love and this fate
this is all this is all I can feel...
I'm sinking deep beneath your world
to sleep inside your empty stare.
Even though I know just what you are,
I know I wouldn't care.
Seated in your judas cradle
taking me inside and then
I lose the things I used to love,
I'll never feel the same again....
and maddening your voice is in my head,
lead me through your flower bed.
And every fear and every dread
are all the dreams I dream instead.
You are the leaving
that leaves nothing left behind
but this heart and this hate
and this love and this fate
this is all this is all I can feel inside for you..
this is all this is all I can feel inside for you...
this is all this is all I can feel inside for you...
