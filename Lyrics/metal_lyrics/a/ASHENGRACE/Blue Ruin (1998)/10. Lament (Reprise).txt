this feeling is fading, this promise lied, this soul has nothing to feel inside
these friends forget, these stars will fall, these words mean nothing to you at all

this child is abandoned, this dark burns clear,
the one who believed in me disappears
this love is over this endless dread
is all I have left to feel instead

sleep... perchance to dream...
