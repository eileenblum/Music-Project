from a distance I see this cynical world has come to be

everything that it promised it never would become
from a distance I see the curtains draw to a close
on the dreamers and poets and all that you love
goes down with the setting sun

their words are written in stone, their faces adorned with gold
I've been to their sages and the wisdom of ages
but I've never been this cold
with cheshire cat smiles they shattered this trust
I used to have gold but it soon became dust
I don't believe in god, I don't believe in love,
but I've always believed in you

from a distance I feel the fabrics open in down in your eyes
holding close, holding fast, but always holding me down
in an instant I try to open these wings unlearning to fly
face up to the rain asleep in the stale underground

their words are written in stone, their faces adorned with gold
I've been to their sages and the wisdom of ages
but I've never been this cold
with all that you love, and all that you need
no matter how long you try to believe
in the dreams that won't come and the words
that won't go either way, in the end you know

one foot on the staircase, one foot on the plains
either way i'll be waiting for you in the sun and the rain
I've never been this high, I've never slipped this low
the things that I dream, the dreams that I love
are the only things left that you'll never know

you'll never know
