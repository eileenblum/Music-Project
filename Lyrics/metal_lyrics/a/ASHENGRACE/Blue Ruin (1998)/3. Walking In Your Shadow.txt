I'm walking in your shadow beyond your aching stare
too close to consequence, too far away to care
I'm gazing in your smile broken by the girl
it's not the end of the line but it feels like the end of the world

I'm going down on my knees for the last time to make you see
I'm open wide before you know, who do you want me to be?

I'm walking in your shadow in the sands of heaven's door
I bury myself in the riverbed where so long ago I washed upon your shore
I slip beneath your waters, dragged down by the stone
I breathe in winter and wait for the kindly ones to come and take me home

I could be all that I am, I should be all that you want
I could be all that you see, if I am anyone but me
