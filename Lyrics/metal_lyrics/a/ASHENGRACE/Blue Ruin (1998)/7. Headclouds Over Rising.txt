across the children close, beyond the faces where I hide
in this empty torn up word, this creeping deep inside
this heaven swims into the blue you know I still look up to you
in love in everything you do, in every everything you do

render me in shadow, hold me in the face of a girl
when the marching men are drawing shades around your useless empty world
no love no more no reasons for
no hope no light no open doors
no words no consequences
no truth no pride no elegances

the storm of pain in coming soon to make these lies pull down the moon
all that you love sets down below and drowning fast in the undertow
on comet's tails we're breaking free from what's to come, from what will be
we know just where we want to go, for all of you, you'll never know
(she will be more than all you are, she'll never see your falling star)

where no shadows block the sun
where no hope is lost, where no rivers run
where the sun blooms for just one day
where we find the place, a winter hideway
forevermore I live this day

I let my ashen graces down, and pull my heart up from the ground
just for one chance to shine brighter than a thousand suns
for love, for truth that now is gone
I once was lost, but now am found
was blind but now I see

and for rhiannon is my elation
and for the lost ones there is nothing
and for rhiannon is my elation
and for the father there is nothing...
