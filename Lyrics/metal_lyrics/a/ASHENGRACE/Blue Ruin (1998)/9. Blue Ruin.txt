cold, distant light...
in this stale instant I might

believe I might be one with you
it seems it's all I ever do

this is pain, this hunger to be
more than I am but who I used to be
all I see in your sweltering gaze
is all that will never be

"you surround me in a tower of gold
you gave me dreams to dream and helped them to unfold
you saved me from myself and freed me from the stone
you are the bluest ruin I have ever known.
You took these broken wings and taught them how to fly
you gave me dreams to dream and gave me reasons why
you made me believe in you, you made me all you home
you are the bluest ruin I have ever known"

dark frozen stares...
across the aching sea of neverwhere
through the looking glass the sorrow swells
her bold pronouncement and her tale to tell
this is the (there is no) easy way out
through the Tower to the razor's shout
she spins the web around me and pulls me to my knees
she sets ablaze the Giving Tree and throws it to the sea

"you submerge me in your static gaze
you leave me burning in the shimmering haze
you are the one who leaves me clawing down alone
you are the bluest ruin I have ever known
you inspire me in ways you cannot see
and when I let go of my failings you'll be there to remind me
i'll drown in sorrow's wake, dragged down by the stone
you are the bluest ruin I have ever known"
