your silver glimmer haunts me chasing sundogs in the sky
I'm awake in semuta, and witness to your lie
to sink into the sea to sleep in your darkness
we climb to your temple on the dark side of the moon in our endless disguise

awaken, awakening time to sleep, perchance to dream
in the hollow halls of forever to wait and wait and wait and wait for you

timeless, sunless we've become to fall so far, it was all for nothing
these things I cannot change these things are said and done

your eyes become the chariot of time that tears me across the sky
in a reign of sand, to me, to know to always wonder why...
