these echoes play across her footsteps in the undertow, fading through your winter
and all the places that we used to know
colder still these feelings drown beneath your feet in velvet sounds
you bring me here, and bring me home and hold me close, and hold me down

it's a change, it's a turn it's the wrong way in a city paved with time
it's a heart, it's a burn, it's a reason and all the blame was mine
it's a night, it's a time for breaking it's a throb in a soul unfurled
it's a loss, it's a bridge of silence from here to the end of the world

and all we were burns slowly in dying fires and falling trees
and we become just one more reaching hand slipped deep into the sea
these fading eyes can't catch the light so far in front of me
that shines from all you tried to hold and throbs forth to bury me

it's a sin, it's a lie, holy water that never removes the stains
it's a drug, it's a fix, it's a mainline of the purest form of pain
it's a word it's a page of promises that are always broken (but always remain)
it's a drown at the hands of poseidon, it will never be, it will never be the same...
