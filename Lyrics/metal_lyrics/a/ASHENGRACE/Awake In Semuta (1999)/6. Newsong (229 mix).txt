is your skin a nervous wreck whatever shape
it's in and this longevity, believe me feels this good
and what for you to worry, I wont bring you down...

and there's something about this obsesssion
and if you people manage in disposession
all these worlds are all for me and if you never call for me
then refrigerate after opening and take your mind off of dwelling on this
and your kiss of tequila lips on me
please say you're reading say you're reading me

and I will sin
and I will lie
I will then live
and I will die
I will disguise
and I will rise...
shut up, you don't know anything...
