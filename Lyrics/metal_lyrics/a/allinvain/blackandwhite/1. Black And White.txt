Everywhere I look, I
I see your face you smile
I see it so clear, so bright
when I close my eyes, I
I see the dark that I fear
the emptiness in my heart

Release me, from this sorrow
whisper in my ear
tell me, everything's gonna be alright
from this sorrow
whisper in my ear
tell me, everything

I've made so many mistakes
I could say I'm sorry a thousand times
but that won't bring you back, no
that won't bring you back

Let me be, for just a second
to get my thoughts in the right direction
you saved my soul, I used to see
everything in black and white

Everywhere I look, I
I see your face you smile
I see it so clear, so bright
when I close my eyes, I
I see the dark that I fear
the emptiness in my heart

Release me, from this sorrow
whisper in my ear, tell me everything
from this sorrow
tell me everything
