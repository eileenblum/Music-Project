You speak for the ones that have sufferedÂ 
Nothing is what it seems when you open your eyesÂ 
It's your last shot, I can't resist the ?

Take backÂ 
What they took from youÂ 
Take back

There are blood on your hands now, tears hit ground they got scars from ear to earÂ 
Feel the ocean embrace you, hold your breath, one last push

Did it ever make sense to you,Â 
that we were all invisibleÂ 
In a world, that used to be our home
That used to be our home

(And all the sleepless nights, because of them)Â 
Because we are,Â 
We are The Forgotten!

Take backÂ 
What they took from youÂ 
Take back

We're outnumberedÂ 
And we knowÂ 
It's our last changeÂ 
For revenge, (for revenge)

Did it ever make sense to you,Â 
that we were all invisibleÂ 
In a world, that used to be our home

Because we are,Â 
We are The Forgotten!

Bleed for your sons,Â 
You got to,Â 
You got, you got toÂ 
Bleed!

Blood, sweat and tears, painÂ 
scars from ear to earÂ 
Screams, fire, rape, they'reÂ 
hiding away from fearÂ 
There are blood on your hands now,Â 
let your rage take over, and set us free

Did it ever make sense to you,Â 
that we were all invisibleÂ 
In a world, that used to be our home
In a world, that used to be, our home

Take a deep breath, inhale the filthy airÂ 
gather your strength up and riseÂ 
Smell the victoryÂ 
Inhale the new eraÂ 
this is all yours,Â 
it's all yours again
