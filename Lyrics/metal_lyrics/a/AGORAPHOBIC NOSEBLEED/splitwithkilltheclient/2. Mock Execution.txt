Arabian goggles over Baghdad. Condoleezza steamer on an old man's chest.
I don't give a fuck, Saddam took it like a man.
Bush would have cried, begged for his life, taken out a second mortgage on his soul,
fucked around on his wife and defaulted the entire loan.
Life's a lovely tit to gently squeeze or a boob to wrench and bruise.
I honestly don't give a fuck, unemployed and the economy is great.
To all the southern boys getting sand pounded up their ass, my thanks.
America escapes the breadline again, this time in hi-def, seven speaker surround sound.
Ate so much wartime pussy I'm really puttin' on the pounds.
Life's a lovely tit to gently squeeze or a fucking boob to wrench and bruise.
