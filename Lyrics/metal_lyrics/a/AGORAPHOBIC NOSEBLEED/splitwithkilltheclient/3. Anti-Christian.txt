I don't worship the devil, I just hate Christians.
Ids slaughter them all if i could, wipe them from this "heavenly" earth.
Anti-christian, not the Antichrist, this is no Gothic struggle. A reason to pray in school.
Weapon of war, not Satan. Burn their churches, homes and schools.
Bring me Pat Robertson's head on a fucking plate.
Evangelical holocaust of a biblical proportion. Moses separating church from state.
Ammunition convey to the front lines, hicks in body armor, armored saints.
Biological attacks across the bible belt. The fat of the American farm land set a flame.
Take no hostages, kill them all, in their saviours name.
