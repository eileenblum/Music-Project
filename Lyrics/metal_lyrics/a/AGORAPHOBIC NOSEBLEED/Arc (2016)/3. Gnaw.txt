"Before the advent of modern anti-psychotic medication most suffered of schizophrenia were unable to live or function independently."

A sharp snag,
caught against
in the snare
guilt clutch
guilt clutch cut
a dead end
struggle to understand

stunt
slow breathing
Give my early years back

and I can begin
and I can begin

Stretch the reject
Punish and affect
the wild wretch
the wild

the wild wretch
the wild wretch
the wild
the wild wretch

the edges we gnaw
caustic and sour
I beg for better

scrawl and watch you
murmur hope,
I beg for better

Punish and affect
the wild wretch

Punish and affect
the wild wretch
the wild wretch

Punish and affect
the wild wretch

the wild wretch

"Am, ...
... to understand, but I ... someone
I love my life.
And I don't even know ... survive like ... to die
How many notice ...
I just ...
My mom died, my father took off of me.
It hurts, it hurts so long."

Tear and trap
Knot
Stump slaughter
Sanity pulled
taught
pulled tight
shot

Stamp slaughter
knot
Tear and trap

murmur hope,
live in shame.
murmur hope,
live in shame.
