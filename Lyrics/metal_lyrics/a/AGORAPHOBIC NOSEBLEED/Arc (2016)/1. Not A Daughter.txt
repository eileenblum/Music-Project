Not knowing
Where illness ends
And you begin

At night
Confusion worsens
I become the center
Of hallucinations

You call
I come
These last memories...

Stop hurting me
Why are you doing this to me

I am nobody
Not a daughter
My face, empty
Empty as your eyes when you asked me
To end you

You stopped eating months ago
You were meant to die, months ago
When the cancer was caused by them

I wondered when
You would die

Your mind, a prison
My last moments with you

Get out!
Get out!

I am nobody,
Not a daughter,
Empty
