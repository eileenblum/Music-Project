Too late
The light left
Your hand twitched
Warm still

I cried your name
Forgive me
For not being there
Too late

I hate that you went
Without me
Unaware

I cried your name
Forgive me
For not being there
Too late

Blush left
A yellow hue
A frame so thin
I cried your name

A cold room
The TV buzz
A nurse who barely knew
Your name
Your living face

Forgive me
For being too late
