Hydra Head Records reissued Agoraphobic Nosebleed's legendary 6" PCP Torpedo as a double disc set entitled PCP Torpedo/ANbRX.
The first disc consisted of the 10-song, 6-minute original single.
The second disc is over an hour's worth of remixes off PCP Torpedo by breakcore and noise core music artists.
Many of the remixes are unrecognizable, but the experimental nature of ANb makes for an interesting reinterpretation.


Thanks to dnb_gabber_head420 for sending track #0.
