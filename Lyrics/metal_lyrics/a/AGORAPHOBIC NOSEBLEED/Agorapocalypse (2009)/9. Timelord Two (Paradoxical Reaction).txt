Agoraphobos
One-dimensional hatross
Alesis Time Machine
Seventh bastard son of the seventh bastard son
Locust abortion technician with deicidal tendencies

I traveled time to kill an unborn Christ
Nocturnus A.D.

Umbilical carefully collected, put into cryo freeze

But I've returned to godless times
Times of understanding and peace
The evidence was everywhere
I had not slain our savior, but the beast

In a world where I never existed
No friends, no family, no ANb
My cargo sold for next to nothing to some Japanese
That years later was rumored to have had programmed
The world's first blast beat
