All avenues blocked off
Following the stench of profit
Forward thinking impaired
All minds closed tight
Charcoal blinders on
Widespread hearing loss
Suffocating stagnation
The world stops turning

Ready to pull the trigger
Slip our necks in the noose
Happy to oblige
If there's no other way
Orwell's nightmare
Slowly reveals itself

At an end! No other way!

Unadvanced
Kept in the past
No real change
To our day-to-day
Brains retreat
Old forms of defeat
We believe
What we're told to see

Trudge to work, watching our feet
Nothing to look at up above our heads
Plugged in to our beloved lifeline
Never noticing the future at an end

At an end! No other way!
