A Wal-Mart shopping spree begins a tri-state killing spree

Some Wall Street metalhead with a tribal armband tattoo
Has just lost his mind
Lost his fucking mind

In a white man's world
Pointless, cold and cruel
We start our day enslaved and end our day depraved

No more sick white guy shit
No more in white guy mode
No more gore or sketchy Asian porn

No more

That's why when I go
I'm taking whitey with me
As many as I can splatter before the clock runs out
See you in hell, you fucks
All covered in blood
Buddha laughing atop a pile of human skulls
