I don't want to fuck your face
I want to wrap my dick
Around your throat and choke you

I slapped a dead man in the face
With his own hand and laughed out loud
Self-awareness on a level
You couldn't possibly conceive

It's not the weed or all the bullshit I read
It's the fucking disillusionment and suffering
Of every living being

The sixteen aspects of the four noble failures
Spend your life with tears in your eyes,
Complaining endlessly

My smile invites suspicion as life sucks like a leech
I'm giving up my ego, my desire, my vanity
All to fill one tiny need
To spread open my ass and shit on your dreams
