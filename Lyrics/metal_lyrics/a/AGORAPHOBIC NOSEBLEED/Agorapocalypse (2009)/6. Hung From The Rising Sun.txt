Jerking off in meetings with his attorneys
Sentenced to death

Holy man, supreme being
Biological weapons, levitation, drugs
Where he was once blind, he can now see
Stand down!
The eye of Horus is opening

Asahara has requested
To be fed only pork
For his last meal
Wild boar

Giraffe tongue makes
A noose around his head
Hung from the rising sun
Until made immortal

He dropped into a white lotus
Butterfly bursting from his eyes in a cloud of sarin gas
Traversing the globe, wings spread
Landing only once, for a moment, on a retarded kid's head
