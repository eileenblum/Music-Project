utter abomination.
manipulate the circumstance to gain a stranglehold to your pathetic existence.
you dont... you aren't... take every opportunity to stop you dead in your tracks,
crush and smash every purpose you had into the ground. you're going down.
piss on and extinguish your oxygen-stealing life.
I'll be the stomach-block in your life. you aren't shit to me. [pete benumb]
