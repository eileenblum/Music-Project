The further away from the human race the better I feel.
I'd rather starve and live on the edges of nowhere than do anything at all.
I don't like to be near them, when someone even brushes against me in a crowd I react.
In a crowd I react.
Till you open up a can of cat food you're going to be burnt.
I'd rather starve and live on the edges of nowhere than do anything at all.
One more beer I'll take you all, all of you...
