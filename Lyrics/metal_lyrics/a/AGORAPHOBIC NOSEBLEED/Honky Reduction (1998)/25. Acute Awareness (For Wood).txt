...
Tightening the coils of seven years
Breathe in, breathe out

...
...
Hold your breath 'til I say when

Breathe in, breathe out
...

Lost in the tall grass
Vipers fill the green
Feel the teeth of angels
Biting at your feet

So close to what you came for
But farther from the truth
Something else to die for
Staring up at you
