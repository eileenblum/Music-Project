Shooting radioactive materials into the bloodstream
Hitting my brain like a hammer
Knocking me to the ground
With every step I take
I must get aboard that plane
50 thousand feet
The controls just went haywire
Just stay calm
Stay in your seats
Skull starting to cave in
Nose starting to bleed
Just try and stay calm
As you're torn from your seat
Travel the friendly skies
Improvised radioactive device
Emergency landing
Middle of nowhere in the middle of the night
A suburb somewhere within the united states
That in just 5 years will have tripled it's cancer rate
