What's a racist joke amongst friends?
Is this pin the devils tail on the honky again?
Like my memories and feelings
My sense of humor
I must have misplaced
Have any other fuckin' party games
Like Simon says
Watch your fuckin' mouth
Around the fuckin' adults
Duller days ahead
Keep your chin up
And get that nose right up in that ass
Don't want to look like a jerk around the ladies
That's right it's better you start off a liar
And work at the bra strap from there
Of addicts and actors I've never known
A coke head to forget a line
Don't forget to give the little slut a polite kiss goodnight
After feeding her all that shit how you're the nice sensitive guy
Fuck you I would rather piss on my own hand
Than to shake yours
