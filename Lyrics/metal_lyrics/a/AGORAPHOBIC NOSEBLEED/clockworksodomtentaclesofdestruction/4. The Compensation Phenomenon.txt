[SIDE B : TENTACLES OF DESTRUCTION]

A INTERESTING BUT HORRIBLE WORLD SHALL COME.
THIS IS THE TRUE MEANING OF THE RETURN TO THE RIGHTEOUS WAY AS PREDICTED BY BUDDHA.
THE CRISIS OF PERISHING, A ENDING.
THE COLLAPSE OF CIVILIZATION IS IMMINENT.
THE WORLD SHALL ENTER SEVERE TIMES, ENTER THE COMPENSATION PHENOMENON.
THE COMPENSATION PHENOMENON WILL BECOME MORE SERIOUS AND WIDE SPREAD.
IN THE HUMAN WORLD CHAOTIC AND ABHANT PHENOMENON WILL CEASELESSLY INCREASE.
A WELL FEED MAN ON THE STREET WILL BE SOMEONE TO AVOID.
