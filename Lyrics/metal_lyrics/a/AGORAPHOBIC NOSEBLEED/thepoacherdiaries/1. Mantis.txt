the world looks like a finger painting done with
broken hands i saw the last mantis today eat its own
head and fuck itself into nothing into nothing i'm
told that we had hands once and we started carrying
knives now we have knives instead so even when we try
to embrace we stabe learn to lick your wounds for the
taste learn to lick your wounds for the taste
