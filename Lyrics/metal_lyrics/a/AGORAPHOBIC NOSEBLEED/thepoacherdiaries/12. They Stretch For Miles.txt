Up for days cutting losses and trading in the most precious of wings
The nights never end, and these ghosts will never know true rest
They stretch for miles, they take me home
In the name of love and you I say...
sometimes when you win the war you lose it all
Towering, they stretch for miles
speaking as eloquently as the tallest of tales
They stretch for miles
They take me home
