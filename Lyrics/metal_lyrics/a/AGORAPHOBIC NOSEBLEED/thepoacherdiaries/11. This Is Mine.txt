And the clouds they break above our best intentions
The rain it pours upon our last kiss
Somewhere between the stinging sheets of city rain
and the thunderclap, we see who we are
And this is all I have, this is all we are
The ground shakes with your every smile
And hearts are crushed in an instant
The rain it pours upon our last kiss
Somewhere between the stinging sheets of city rain
and the thunderclap, we see who we are
Three years then four days, and one sentence later
I rise from ruin, this is all I have, this is mine
Today, I rise from ruin
