[Hebrew text:]
('There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush. Moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up' [Exodus 3:2])

I've learnt of brimstones
I've learnt of ambers
But a thing like this
Is far beyond what I've learnt to know
A sorcery of some origin
An ancient force
A flame that keeps to grow

Unburning flame
Undying knowledge
Inflamed can't be this fiery perception
Embrace the strength
Bow and acknowledge
To answer the uncalled Hebrew question

[Hebrew text:]
('When the LORD saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from within the bush' [Exodus 3:4])

Recreating everything in every single word
In awe I knee before the ruler of the world
I'm but a shepherd, I cannot lead no man
I won't defy the voice, but I cannot understand
If truly you are God, If you can see inside my soul
Who am I to stand against the Pharaoh, and who am I at all?

Who am I at all?

On this forsaken mountain nothing is mundane
This voice is telling me of a land forgot by men
My lord has spoken true
His words sculpture my heart
The warrant is superb, indeed the high command
Even as a stammerer your distant voice be heard
Now I'll leave my home and gather all my herd

[Hebrew text:]
('So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh to bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt' [Exodus 3:10])

Unresting fire, the sacred flame of God
From this moment on to you my lord I vow
A holy cleansing, secular shell being shed
As instant as a heartbeat - I'll follow his command
