[Hebrew text:]
('Every born son you shall cast into the Nile' [Exodus 1:22])

Many sleepless nights
Far too many troubled days
The prophets are grim at thought
The oracles have spoken

Dark and gloomy eyes
Turned hellish red in mind
Every born son you shall cast into the Nile

And I know for sure
That they won't endure
Something's got to give
They will crumble down

Show them no remorse
Make them feel the pain
Spill the blood of every son
For this is not in vain

Be silent my child
Be silent my child
Your tender cry
Visions in your eyes

And I won't let go
No I won't let go
Embracing you
My Child
Stay with me

[Hebrew text:]
('And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, Whom the lord knew face to face, in all the signs and the wonders, Which the Lord sent to him to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, And to all his servants, and to all his land, and in all that mighty hand, And in all the great terror which Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel' [Deuteronomy 34:10-12])

Distant sound of evil
Getting closer with each step
Must hide before they reach
Quick, hide before they breach

I know that they look for you
You're safe with me
God holds your hand

Silent screams
For if they hear us
It will be the end of his life

I'll sacrifice myself
For you, my child,
I'll sacrifice my soul

My gracious God
Please send me an angel
With crystal white wings
Which under it we safely abide

No evil can harm us
Holy savior
Protector of kingdom of heaven
I'm calling your name...

Hear me!

I've seen the light shining from above

[Hebrew text:]
('The Lord make his face shine upon thee' [Numbers 6:25])

[Hebrew text:]
('End she took for him an ark of bulrushes and put the child therein, And she laid it in the flags by the river's brink.' [Exodus 2:3])

Hush my baby don't you cry
My love for you is eternal
Like the everlasting fire
You light up the darkest corner of my soul

God please, God please hold his hand
Protect him from our sins
Show your grace
Bless the child

Watch him from a far
As he floats along the Nile
Aimlessly drifting
Washed away with all my tears
My sorrow
My pain

A tear drop falling
Ripples my reflection
And I can't let go
