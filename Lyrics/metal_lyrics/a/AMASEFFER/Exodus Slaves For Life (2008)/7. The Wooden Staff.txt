[Hebrew text:]
('The Lord of the Universe who reigned
Before anything was created.
When all was made by his will
He was acknowledged as King.
And when all shall end
He still all alone shall reign.
He was, He is,
And He shall be in glory.
And He is one, and there's no other
To compare or join Him.
Without beginning, without end
And to Him belongs dominion and power
In his temple my soul shall rejoice.
Our messiah He shall speedily send.
And then we shall sing in the holy temple,
Amen amen, The Awesome one.')
