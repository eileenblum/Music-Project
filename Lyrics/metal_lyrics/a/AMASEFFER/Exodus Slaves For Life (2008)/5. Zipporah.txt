The clouds are long gone
The sun is shining from above
A fountain of life in the desert
I saw her standing by the well

[Hebrew text]

I fell for you my one true love

[Hebrew text]

You are my guiding star

[Hebrew text]

I whisper your name

[Hebrew text]

Come my dear and cure my cries
Day and night I can't rest my eyes
Screams inside of me torturing my soul
I hear my crying brothers

[Hebrew text]

I fell for you my one true love

[Hebrew text]

You are my guiding star

[Hebrew text]

I whisper your name

[Hebrew text]

Fallen from grace, will these wounds heal?
Scarred by hands of faith, a higher seal
Desert daughter please help me feel
Is true and destined love for real?
