[Hebrew text:]
('And he cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A host of evil angels.' [Psalms 78:49])

Two brothers stand; their eyes are caught with fire
They know no fear from the tyrant on the throne
A simple wish not granted, to worship for their god
There's no compassion inside the Pharaoh's heart of stone.

Blood consumes the waters; tainting red the sacred Nile
The rancid stench of death harbours winds for miles
The cities and the temples, flooded now with frogs
And their croaking lasted days until Moses gave his word

The Pharaoh's slender patience was reducing with each night
But to free the Hebrew slaves was an unimaginable right
Though the word that spread in Egypt was speaking of the awe
That was penetrating slowly about a God they do not know

A host of evil angels - each has a different sword
Striking down at Egypt in the name of the one and only God

By the brandish of the staff a cloud of dust arises
Carried by the desert winds and turning into lice

Harming none in Goshen, infecting with their woe
A gathering of vermin collide against the Hebrew's foes

God presents severity like never seen before
His words to Moses rumbles like the distant thunder roar

The pestilence and sickness that stroke the heathen fold
Are the labour pains of freedom taking out their toll?

Storming down with holy anger
Rain of fire destroys all
Unending swarms of God sent furies
Covering the suns in whole

[Pharaoh:]
[Hebrew text:]
('Get thee from me! Take heed to thyself, see my face no more; For in that day thou see my face... thou shalt die!')

[Moses:]
[Hebrew text:]
('My lord, master of the universe, Flesh and blood when he comes down to rage war, his ministers and servants surrounding him in all his glory. And you supreme king of kings, judge us for we are your servants and they are your allies. Come and rage war with hem, hallowed be the name of God... For ever and ever!')

The Pharaoh's heart was stubborn
But the grief was greater than his will
By taking every first-born
Entire Egypt chilled
