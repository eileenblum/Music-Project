Into the land of evil I walk
A path so dark
Leads me into the Kingdom of Darkness
Creatures from a place unknown
I can feel them possessing my mind

Deep into the abyss I fall
With a neverending pain
You will never understand
What I feel

I have left the disgusting planet of God
To join the army of suffering souls
I am now one with the dark forces
The conquering of human life has begun!

Deep into the abyss I fall
With a neverending pain
You will never understand
What I am
