When the mystical fog stand beneath the dark clouds
And surrounds me in my own emptiness
I can see the shapes of my nightmares
The shapes who haunts me night after night.

Alone about my visions
I can no longer hear my thoughts
If my mind lives in another world
What is reality then?

I'm still searching for the meaning of life
When the silence is coming over me
The loss of my soul, to another time
Do almost feel true

Walking through spaces
Will my end never come?
I can feel the flames (from nowhere) but not see it
Am I still human?
