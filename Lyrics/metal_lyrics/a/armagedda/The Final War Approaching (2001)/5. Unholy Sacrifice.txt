[Lyrics by A]

I am your sins
i am your mind
All throught i'm you
hear my call

Sacrifice!

I possess you
into the deepest black hole
i am the creature
you fear

I am the demon
in your head
i ride the darkest
Thoughts in your mind

You cant see throught it
death blocks your eyes
this is not a dream
this is reality

Sacrificing demons
come and join my unholy soul
this is our first day
it has just begun
Unholy Sacrifice!
