[Lyrics by Graav]

Without beginning
will my hate for your lies,never end.
Weak humans,like you
will feel the fear of death...
If you're not blessed of of your faith.

Break down the undead
So they shall see real darkness
Do not show mercy against life
We willnot miss them...
They will not miss us.

"The world" is trying to change me
well fuck off,i still support
what i've aways believed in
Through my eternal journey.

Executions runsthrough my mind
When i'm passing my darkest thoughts
my death will never be here,
i have never lived.
