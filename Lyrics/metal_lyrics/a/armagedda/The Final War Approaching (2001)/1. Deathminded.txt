[Lyrics by Graav]

In this cold night
I feel my soul life again
when i think of the world
that i left beyond this dark side

The true evil against humans
Is still alive inside me
All i can feel is emptiness
From the dark angel's power

When the time has come
i will return with death on my mind
And with my immortality
You will be prepared to die

I can hear voices
voices from the dark past
My fantasies turn real
then the dead lives again

I saw the truth
when i walked the eternal journey
the future of the world
will burn in my flames
