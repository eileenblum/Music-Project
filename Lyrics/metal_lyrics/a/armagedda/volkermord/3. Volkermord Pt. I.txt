I can feel it in my mind
The real evilness is coming
And we are waiting for it
Possess our pure souls

Those creatures who hate us
Will have their minds drown in the skuggons shadow
Your end is never coming, your life will never end
Because your mind will be lost in an eternal suffer

Come on and fill my mortal soul
I will not betray you
Just give me strength to protect our rising DEATH kingdom

After this day will the smell of death remind us
That the mighty dark thing came at last
It will now lead us into the great spirit battle
And my conciousness have I left in my past
