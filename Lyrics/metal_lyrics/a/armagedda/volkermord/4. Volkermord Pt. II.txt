Victim! I will sacrifice you to myself
And you will join my ocean of blood
Down in my underground castle it is
Only your blood that's keeping me warm

My hate is controlling me completely

The children who I dragged down to my place
Are now aware of how their life will end
I'm sending the evilness over my (the) world
And everyone will feel what I have made

My hate is controlling me completely
