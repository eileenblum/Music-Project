I don't like the modern humans
I don't care if someone of them dies
I'm not happy to see your ugly face
As long as you're still alive

You won't infect me by your presence
But you will make me sick of hatred
I cannot hold myself any longer
I'm about to make you suffer

You call yourself Christian
But you don't know what it mean
Just wanna stab all the hearts of stupidity
I have the guts you never get from your god
The time has come to glory the true master

I look at you and see pure weakness
You are one of those who doesn't have a mind
