The emperor from the eternal dark
I'm thee worthy
The spiritual war is here, I can see through my sense
We are waiting for the moment, to kill or be killed
He is heavens damnation

Take part of His devilish creation
Before Jesus will take part of you
The dark is carrying the strength
That will lead the life to it's end

I am supporting the army of mayhem
Bringing fatal diseases to the world
Death will leave you to your destiny
We are heavens damnation
