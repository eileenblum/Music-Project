I'm calling you to me
Hear my words in yout mind
Hear me speak without tunes
From the endless worlds of fire

I have found you
I'm now the tormentor of your soul
Wherever you may hide
I will turn light for you to darkness

Ancient spirits
Created by evil
Follow my voice

I can see destruction from a different side now
When the demons have drowned my mind
You can't hide in the darkness
If you don't belong to it
