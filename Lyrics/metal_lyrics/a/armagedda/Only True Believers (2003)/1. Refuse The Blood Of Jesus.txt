I have refused the blood of Jesus
I have kissed the goat
I glorify the true master
And I give my soul to him

The beast controls my mind
No one can resist his power
He is the lord of everything
Satan lights my desire

I have refused the lekamen of Jesus
I have been baptised in unholy blood
I glorify the tyrant of evil
And pray for armageddon to com

The beast controls my mind
I can't resist his malicious charm
He is my master forever
Satan lights my desire
