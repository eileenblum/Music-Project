Over endless field of sorrow
Through dark woods of Silvan
Following the voice of Satan
To a kingdom, hidden for light

Angels of death walking by my side
Lucifers demons entices me to him

Over empty fields of nothingness
Through everlasting darkness
Follow the path, away from mortal life
Soon I will be there

Angels of death walking by my side
Lucifers demons entices me to him

Tonight I shall die
And enter the realm of Satan
Tonight I give my soul
To the flames of hell
