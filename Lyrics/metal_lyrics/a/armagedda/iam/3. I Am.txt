I desire the darkness in light
A desire that never stop burning
I support the evil in mankind
The evil that never dies
I feel those thoughts you get
When the hate has poisoned your sense
I know my time has come
My mind is drowning in death

I am no longer
The one without believe
I am no longer
The one I've used to be
