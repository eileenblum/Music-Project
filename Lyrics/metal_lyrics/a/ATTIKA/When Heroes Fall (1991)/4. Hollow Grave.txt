[Longobardi]

Can I be redeemed from this life
There's no meaning to my end

I was left behind to fend for myself
And I don't know where I've been

I haven't lived to see my dreams
My past is an empty shell

The world has had its full of me
Will I have my chance as well.

They've locked me away in a hollow grave
And I've lost all hope of ever being saved.

They lied to take me from my home
Said my victory lied beyond the sea

Now lost, forgotten, maybe dead
Someone cries for me

I had to sacrifice myself
I must lose so we can win

And I dare not try end my life
For I'll only lose again

Don't lock me away in a hollow grave
Don't shed a tear I can't pretend I'm brave
I'm lost inside a world that's not for me
And I see no sign of ever being free.

I've dreamed the horrors of war
I've tasted my blood and gore
But now I face the worst
I'm dead before my time
Though my yes cannot see
I hear them burying me
I've forgotten how to scream
And they've given up on me.

I fought a war to stay alive
I killed my faith in man
Now I'm a forgotten pawn
Left behind to stand
Alone against what has become
A farce before my eyes
I only wanted to be left alone
Now I'm left behind.

My family has erased my life
To forget about their pain

And though I live among the dead
I'll never breathe again

Myself and all the others must face
That our longing inside has died

And we've become a nation of ghosts
A lost forgotten tribe.

The years have past, the days grow long
I'm a victim of my own pride

I don't know if I could live again
My home is now on this side

My father in heaven look down and answer
Where does my destiny lie?

I was never prepared to live this life
Now I'm not prepared to die

I'm left behind to die in a hollow grave
And I know no one will ever speak my name

The world goes on as though I've never been
And to fade without a fight, a forgotten sin
I cannot bear to see my name

That no one ever speaks
And eyes that never see
The forgotten epitaph of my hollow grave.
