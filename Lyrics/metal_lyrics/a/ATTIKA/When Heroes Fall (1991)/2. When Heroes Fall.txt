[Longobardi, Patelski]

When you came upon the land
To free our people
They followed you to reach
A higher glory
But when you tried to show them
How to break from their chains
They didn't want to soil their hands
As you scarred your very own

You're never forgiven
When you bare your frail humanity
For their flock must face
Their righteous vanity.

Know the sign of their frustration
When you've overstayed your welcome
Beware the fear in their eyes
When Heroes Fall.

In the beginning
You were held in high esteem
But then your words began
To fall on ears of stone
And when you force your ways
On the disenchanted
You become a scapegoat
For all the superstitions.

And all these shattered people
Who pledged worship
Who seeked you out to
Pacify their void
For all the wealth of Truth
That's cast upon them
It becomes a blinding light
When the magic is all gone.

For now
You're nothing to those people
They turn on you to only follow
Some other golden idol.

Know the sign of their frustration
When you've overstayed your welcome
Know the fear in their eyes
When Heroes Fall.

You left yourself
A vulnerable open wound
And they seized upon your
Power from within

You set yourself up for the fall.

And when they feed on you
And drain your very being
And you're left behind a
Noble empty shell.
Then the roar of the crowd
Turns from cheer to jeer
When everyone has taken
Everything you have to offer.

And now
You're run out of the cities
You're spurned and then forgotten
As you pass the torch of power.

Hear the crash of the spirits
Of the foolish draped in darkness
Hear the decay of purity
When the real world calls.

Understand that the masses
Have no need for tired truths
They'll create another savior
That won't shatter their illusions.

Know the sign of their frustration
When you've overstayed your welcome
Beware the fear in their eyes
When Heroes Fall.
