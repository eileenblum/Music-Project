[VanWar]

You think you're gonna get away
From all this insanity

But really you are caught
In the mist of actuality.

Dark minds of deception
Control the corridors of who we really are

One nation under the rich
Cut the poor and watch their bleeding scars.

They call the shots from
Their one sided ivory tower view

Brought up to live like kings
And only see what they want to.

Like a plague of uncertainty
The crimes of justice are everywhere

And the dreams of greatness
Mean nothing to a world that won't care

We've become a machine like society
Numbered like the pieces of a puzzle, systematically
Predecided destiny printed on a computer page
Slowly fallen into the hands of the information age.

What am I gonna do, confrontation coming to
As the hour ticks away it's moving near
These are dangerous times we are living
In a nightmare of mechanical fear.

Why can't you see we're all just prisoners of habit
And foolish pride has us believe we hold some kind of magic.

Face to face I am forced to choose
And meet the eyes of no remorse

Their skulls are emblazed with the lies
Of those who believe they know the righteous course.

Where are the eyes of the past
That saw a free world among men

Obviously the blind had lead all others
To a bound and chained end.

We are made to believe that
The ones who do lead are supreme

But I make the key that sets myself free
ETERNAL ANARCHY

Why can't you see we're all just prisoners of habit
And foolish pride has us believe we hold some kind of magic.
