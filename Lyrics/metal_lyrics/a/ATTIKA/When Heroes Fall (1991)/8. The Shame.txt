[Miller]

Our world
Is slowly dying

It's being killed day to day
By the use of man.

The paradise
Of the Milky Way

We don't appreciate
What we have at hand.

Last night
Alone with my thoughts

Thinking about
The future of Mankind.

The Evil
That sleeps within us

Is unleashed
By those who don't understand

The Shame
Of being human

The only one
Who kills just for thrill.

The pain
Is growing daily

What adults don't kill
Their children will.
