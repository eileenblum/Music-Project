[Longobardi, VanWar]

The stars above the night
Shine out on the sins of us all.

The prince and the fool battle out
2000 years apocalypse shall fall.

Just as the scriptures told
The first of seven signs
Our fate rests on the shoulders of hope.

Look into the Guff the sparrow sings his song
When the hall is emptied the sparrow sings no more
It's the seventh sign, it's the final warning
Life's colors turn to stone, she is left to save the world alone.

With the help of the knowledge
She solves the questions to break the chain.

The mortal cries out who dies for the
Word of God must be saved.

Child of the future
The world of God is spoken
The wrath of his fury it can be broken.

Look into the Guff the sparrow sings his song
When the hall is emptied the sparrow sings no more
It's the seventh sign, it's the final warning
Life's colors turn to stone, she is left to save the world alone.

The sparrow is still singing...

She reaches out to save him
But the final sign has already come.

And in the hour of loneliness
She gives birth to the soul - less one.

The dream begins to open
The questions asked again
The answer has been chosen
I will die for him.

Look into the Guff the sparrow sings his song
When the hall is emptied the sparrow sings no more
It's the seventh sign, it's the final warning
Life's colors turn to stone, she is left all alone.

Look into the Guff the sparrow sings his song
When the hall is emptied the sparrow sings no more
It's the seventh sign, it's the final warning
Life's colors turn to stone, she is left to save the world alone.

The heavens are calm again

Remember...
