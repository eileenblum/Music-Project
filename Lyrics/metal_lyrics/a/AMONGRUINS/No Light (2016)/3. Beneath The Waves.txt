[Music &amp; lyrics: Sverd]

The gaze fixed upon me,
Venom in my brain
Distorted face behind me,
I canât bear the strain
My mind is slipping away
From reality
My thoughts are taking me
Towards insanity
The voices I hear in my head
Are becoming alive
I am one with the dead

Make me realize
There is something here
For me
Something to believe in,
A way for me to live
How can I feel alive?

Beneath the waves bury me
Another night
With a pain that wonât leave
In the abyss I am able
To breathe,
Away from lifeâs misery
Beneath the waves bury me
One more night
With that darkness in me

The sea engulfs me
In her black embrace
Water is filling
All the empty wounded space
Falling deeper inside,
In the palace of tides
Where you canât see the light,
But the eyes
Still remains open wide and
I am falling deeper inside,
Through a million cries

Let the agony back,
I cannot die
But I wonât arise,
I donât need your lies

Beneath the waves another night
With a pain that wonât leave
In the abyss,
Away from lifeâs misery
