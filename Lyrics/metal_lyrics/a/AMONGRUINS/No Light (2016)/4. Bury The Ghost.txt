[Music &amp; lyrics: Sverd]

Follow me into the depths
Of my soul.
My plot is of darkness
And scorn
To dethrone the ones who
Enslave, our kingdom shall
Rise to the day
The night is falling
Softly upon our open wounds
Our blood is running
To capture their crimes
The sun is failing
Once more to rise
Behind the ridge
But clouds of madness
Will capture their sins

You see them running
Across the mountains,
Lakes and seas
To save the strength
They used to carry within
But the sun is failing
Once more to rise
Behind the ridge
And clouds of madness
Will capture their sins

There is no trace to be found,
We were wandering round
And round and round
The devil I arriving ashore,
On the fields in circles we go
How many are there, where
Will they go and they are
Singing with woe?
In the woods
To bury the ghost,
To rip their spirits
From this world

As we are approaching,
Our shadows devour
Their mouths wide open,
Their heads they fall down

Their blood is running,
Poisoning the ground

Dead trees are rising
Piercing through the clouds
The sun is failing once more
To rise behind the ridge
But clouds of madness
Will capture their sins
There is no trace to be found,
We were wandering round
And round and round
The devil is arriving ashore
On the fields in circles we go
How many are there, where
Will they go and they are
Singing with woe?
In the woods
To bury the ghost,
To rip their spirits
From this world
