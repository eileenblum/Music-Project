[Music: Sverd, Thanos, lyrics: Sverd]

I cannot turn back,
Itâs been so long
All the time
That we spent apart
I was prone to illusions
To follow them like they were real,
But everything
Was still surreal
This is written in fire
Flames of war
Bigger than wrath,
Stronger than hate
Whatever has happened
Is left to decay

If you were to witness
The world would suffice
Among the ruins of life
Bringing the wrath
Just to survive
The promise was there,
The feeling was clear
This pain resorted to fear
Crushed beneath
The weight of the world
I dissect my soul,
Withered lost all control

Ride with me,
Pierce through the night
With these fiery eyes
Burn with me, 
Carry me under
Your wings tonight
Fly high,
Feel deep inside all
The demons ascend
Through the fire
Fly high,
Spread your wings
Open wide
This will be
Our last sear sacrifice
No need to go back
All the feelings I had
Memories follow
The moments of disaster
Burn my memories
Into one dream
