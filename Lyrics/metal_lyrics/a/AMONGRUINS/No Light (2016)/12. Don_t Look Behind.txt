[Music &amp; lyrics: Sverd]

Bring the fire, melt the ice
Claim whatâs yours to take
Despised forever
Abandoned in an open grave
To reign supreme over those
Who left you behind

Spill the dragonâs blood
Burning tonight in your veins
Bearing the mark
Of the horse and the flame
To ignite the old passage
From exile to reign
Raging with fury, bury them
Deep in your pain
Crushing down all enemies
Bringing on the chaosâ rage
To ignite all the armies
For the ones who are dead,
They shall rise to your gaze

Fly, ride far from your life
To the dawn of a new one, beginning
Donât cry, donât look behind
For the ones who have bled,
They shall rise
Fly away from their lives
Cause a new one is beginning
And cry but donât look behind
For they shall ride by
Your side

Bring the fire,
Burn them tonight
Burn them away and ride
Burn them and ride
