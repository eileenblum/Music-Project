[Music: Sverd, Thanos, lyrics: Thanos]

Creation of my mind
Gives me false belief
Just left myself behind
For that I just have leaved

My thoughts
Are travelling far away
My heart to walk the distance
Empty-lonely,
With memories in depot
My mind is driven out of here
With my lost soulâs the infant
Hopeless-pointless,
With hope to die this instant

My thoughts are playing
Tricks on me
No light to show me brighter
The wells of agony
That I am falling under
No light

My breath
Is slowly chocking me
A light is fading farther
No hope
To save myself for me
This shit canât kill me faster
My thoughts
Are travelling far away
My heart to walk the distance
Hopeless-pointless,
With hope to die this instant

Thereâs nothing else,
There has never been
The less I get, the more I give
And as I dreamed, left alone
Without you

I will be on my own
And as your pictures
Will presence your absence
There is nothing more
To change the substance
I want you to know,
Donât care if you bother
The lie of yours
Is the truth of another

We are all searching for
Someone whose demons play
Well with ours
Not a matter of skin or
Someone to forget that we
Are counting the hours
More ambitious we get as our
Ego resets,
But weâre starting to sink
Life canât be measured
By the breaths that we take
But with those
We are trying to exhale

Thereâs nothing else,
There has never been
The less I get, the more I give
I want you to know,
Donât care if you bother
The lie of yours
Is the truth of another

No light
