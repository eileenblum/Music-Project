[Music: Sverd, Thanos, lyrics: Sverd]

Thereâs nowhere to hide
My blood cries out revenge
My mind is set to kill
As you are falling deep
In the night
And you cannot hide
You will taste our revenge
Youâre running an endless mile
As you are falling deep
In the night
Drown

Have you ever seen
Those eyes
You took away their lives
Itâs in your hands now,
Make it right
I see despair
And I see no change
Only promises,
I know you shall break

Divided youâll be crushed
By our hand our hearts
We are the ones
Who will bring you down
We are the ones
Who will fight
We will fight

Have you ever seen
Those eyes
You took away their lives
Itâs in your hands now,
Make it right
I see despair, I see no change
Only promises,
I know you shall break

Have you ever seen
These eyes
You took away our lives
Itâs in your hands now,
Make it right
I feel despair and I feel hate
We will fight back
And you wonât reign
