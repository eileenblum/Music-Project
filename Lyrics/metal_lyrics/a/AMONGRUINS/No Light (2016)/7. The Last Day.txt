[Music: Sverd, lyrics: Thanos]

Letâs take it serious indeed
Just tell me that I am not
What you need
Just tell me straight
And all will be right
And let me get you
Out of my sight

God, I canât take a breath
I am choking

It took years for me
To understand
And not just to be
Now I end in the same path
I understand, it wasnât enough

I canât take a breath
I am choking

The last day
No room or nothing to say
All memories run out
Through your eyes
Like pictures
the last day
You touched my head as I lay
And looking straight into
My eyes
You saidâ¦

Your cold eyes
Are burning my skin
Inside my heart forever will be

A dose of ass kick you need
It may throw you
Out of your greed
And help you realize what
Youâve got
Wherever youâll go now
I will not
Go now and wear the mask
It will help you hide enough
From your past
And maybe help you
And make you forget
We know as well,
In shit you will get
