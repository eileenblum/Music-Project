[Music &amp; lyrics: Sverd]

On my own in this vast,
Cold room
Walking endless circles,
Darkened hours
Timeâs book turning
The last page
I am still waiting for a change

Then a look into my eyes
Trying to feed me
All these lies
In your inner chamber, strong
Your power yet so frail
Then a touch full of bliss
A kiss from your poison lips
In your inner chamber, strong
Your power yet so frail

Will I ever rest in peace, put
An end to my black dreams
All the fears feeding my soul,
Trying to break free
From this world

For my loneliness
And fro my silent cries
Theyâre all running
Through my eyes
For the rage
And screams in me
That you never dared to feel

Then a look into my eyes
Trying to feed me
All these lies
In your inner chamber, strong
You power yet so frail
Then a touch full of bliss
A kiss from your poison lips
In your inner chamber, strong
Your power yet so frail

Through my eyes
A touch of bliss
A kiss from your poison lips

Will I ever rest in peace, put
An end to my black dreams
All the fears feeding my soul,
Trying to break free
From this world
