[Music: Thanos, Sverd, lyrics: Sverd]

Lavish words with no remorse
You reached under my skin
Piercing through my heart.
The coldness
Calling for my sins
I try to find, to realize what
Went wrong with my dreams
Lost in a glance,
No second chance
The roots of life are ripped
From down below

Cast away between
Dimensions,
Plunging in my grief
Discovering the nightmares
That I buried deep within
Found myself again led by the
Screams of agony
I have to try, no time to cry
The game of space and time

Lost in space and time

Making me suffocate,
No time to breathe,
The sand of time
Are burning my skin
Crawling in places my mind
Cannot reach
Scratching and scrapping
With intensity
Carried away by demonic winds,
The sands of time
Are stopping for me
Choices, decisions
So hard to see
A lifetime fulfilled
By intensity

Intensity
