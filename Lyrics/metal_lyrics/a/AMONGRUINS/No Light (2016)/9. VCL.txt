[Music: Lithras, Sverd, lyrics: Lithras]

The pain is searing
Inflamed, diseased gut
For my relief
A place of healthy plants

Pushing, hurting
Crying, hating
Leprosy from my insides
Infects the plants with disease

Crates of leper lettuce on the
Shelves of vegan marts
They believe theyâre healthy,
Mistaken, poor imbeciles
Leprosy is spreading among
The vegan mass
Activists engage in ignorant
Coprophagia

Lepers shambling
Limbs are falling
Vegans dying

The pain is searing
Leprosy is spreading
