[Music: Thanos, Sverd, lyrics: Thanos]

These are
My words of confess
No lies hidden beneath
This is my way to patience
Reasons that you still live
No longer ask or answer
On what we should have been
It took too long to master
What I should not be

But you are coming again
You play with my feelings
And mess with my head
Canât understand
What you are hiding behind
I am either alive
Or I walk with the dead
You take me back
Into horrible places
You show me things
That I want to forget
But all that fragile reality
Iâll throw away
And Iâll never regret

This was enough,
I had enough
The more that I kept
The more disturbing
The things I felt
Now run to be sure
That Iâll never find you
And I tried to let go
But I only have love
For bruises on you

You had one thing not to do
And you have done it
My walls are closing in to you
Run âem and fuck âem

But you are coming again
You play with my feelings
And mess with my head
Canât understand
What you are hiding behind
I am either alive
Or I walk with the dead
You take me back
Into horrible places
You show me things
That I want to forget
But all that fragile reality
Iâll throw away
And Iâll never regret

Please father forgive me,
For I have sinned
The things Iâve done,
I never meant
Iâll never forget
The things that I did
But those Iâve sinned for,
Iâll never regretâ¦

You had one thing not to do
And you have done it
My walls are closing in to you
Run âem and fuck âem
