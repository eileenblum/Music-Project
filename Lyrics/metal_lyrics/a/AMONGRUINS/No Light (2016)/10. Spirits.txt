[Music: Thanos, lyrics: Sverd]

Cry, when sorrow is all
That is left
And kingdoms rise
To darken the skies
Grow, into silence we enter
We go where all future
Lies unknown
We still go through
The everlasting snow
Our strength against the cold

You should know
There comes a time
When this silence
Breaks in the night
Hear their cries tonight calling
Your name from afar

To find the gateways of denial
Where rivers flow
Through time
Will our spirits cross
To the other side
When he comes wreathed
In clouds
With darkness in his mind
Will our spirits cross
To the other side

Under the sunâs last rays
Disorder is your way out
Do not linger here forever for
The present denies
From the depths I am calling,
Fallen to disgrace

You should know
There comes a time
When this silence
Breaks in the night
Hear their cries tonight calling
Your name from afar
Tears and prayers
To cover me,
But this beauty is just a sin
You left me to fight alone,
You left me to fight the world
