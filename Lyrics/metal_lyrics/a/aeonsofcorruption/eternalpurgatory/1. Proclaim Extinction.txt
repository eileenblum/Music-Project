For far too long this putrid race now walked the earth / Contagious waste - you shall tremble with fear / As I arise and devour everything that you love / There is no saviour and no redeemed / I AM THE DEMON THAT KILLED ALL YOUR GODS / Unending purification will be all
that is real / And when the chants of extinction resound in your ears / All your pleas will be unheard / This is no call, no demand / This is a promise to break / All of the branches you took / And built your lives on as fakes / I won't forgive any sins / I am perdition
within / I have come to cleanse / This earth and all life on it Humanity will witness what I'm able to do / There is no god to safe you / No place where you can escape / THIS IS YOUR PRICE FOR LIFE / THIS IS MY VENGEANCE / The end is near / Prepare to fucking die
