YOUR EXISTENCE DISGUSTS ME / I will end this with my own hands / Prepare to meet your creator / I am a product of hate / Resentment, lies, fraud and pain / My flesh is marked / From this hell that you call life / And all mankind is passing by / With their empty eyes / We
are condemned to extinction / But I wont surrender / I will fight for my life / This cant be the end / I will fucking tear apart / Everything that comes in my way / All your innocence means nothing to me / In catatonia you'll rest until there's nothing left to save / I
am the epitome of evil / I AM THE HELL YOU WILL ROT IN FOREVER / In hate I prevail / Your life will turn to dust / My lungs crave for your soul - in everlasting thirst / And your words are like poison / Though I never heard your voice / In fucking hate I prevail / This
is your downfall / Words cannot describe what you did to me / What you're doing right now / All my tolerance has vanished / My anger has become hate / My hate will become your demise / Treachery - will reign upon you for you're just a waste / Calamity â AND YOUR LAST
BREATH I WILL TAKE VIOLENTLY / Enemy â I will destroy your heart and rip your guts apart / FOR YOU ARE NOTHING BUT A DISGRACE TO MY LIFE / And I can't stand to see you prey on what I - built up â as if you were its own creator / I will find pleasure in dismembering you
completely / You're a fucking infamy / Your inaptitude is the cause of your failures / I condemn you to the highest extent / This urge cannot be repressed / Every cell in my body demands your death / Cavernous thoughts overcome your mind / Who are you to think you won't
be confined / To this place I dreamed of so long in my head / Where the rain is your blood and YOUR LIFE MEANS NOTHING / It's still in my head / BUT I WILL MAKE IT REAL / This I promise / It's still in my head / But I'll kill you tomorrow / This I promise / It's still in
my head / But I will make it real / This I promise / It's still in my head / But I will slaughter you / THIS I PROMISE
