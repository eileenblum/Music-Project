THERE IS NO CHANCE TO ESCAPE / From this nightmare / You're lying on the floor and struggling for air / Every bone feels like broken / I will redeem you from your pathetic life / It's not the end - this is just the beginning / Of what you have to go through / The only
thing that contents me is your blood on my hands / Can you hear the demons inside me / They're screaming for victims / I will not fight against this possession / Your offering will release the pure evil / My will shall be done / I WILL SHATTER THE BASICS OF EXISTENCE /
It's you I delete / When the air in your lungs is replaced by sulfur / Rage shall fill your minds / When the demons amongst you take off their masks / Countless hours of torment /Weaken your mind to the point of perdition / My minions will not halt at any volition /
Until the day that you rue all your insolences / You must feel my hate / FUCK / Everything you once adored will now perish from my hands / And with cruel hearts they will rage upon you and your land / Ultimately blood will pour out your bastard veins / YOU WILL BE ALIVE
BUT NOT OPERABLE / Suffocating - throat split into half / Trachea squeezed and your head crushed / The endmost thing you will see is your waist ripped to shreds / SLAMMED TO DEATH / This is a decimation / This world turns to a fucking graveyard / Your dead bodies pave the
way to my throne / Now lay and rot beneath my feet
