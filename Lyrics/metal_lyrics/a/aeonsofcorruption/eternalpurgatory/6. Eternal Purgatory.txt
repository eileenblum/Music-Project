What is this pain / This drill inside of my head / It's getting deeper - I SCREAM / I thought I have reached the end / But it's still too soon / Everyone I loved is buried under the debris that I used to call home / Hot blood is flowing throughout my mouth / I feel like
puking my guts out / My limbs - mangled from the hounds of hell / My brain - rumpled from the hands of the devil / A grin is becoming apparent in front of my eyes when my flesh starts to melt down from my bones and dissolves from the inferior being I am / Worthless scum
- this is the way I'll rot / Bathed in my blood and exposed to the heat of the eternal purgatory / I'M FALLING FASTER / FALLING FASTER INTO SLUMBER / I'LL NEVER WAKE UP AGAIN / THIS WORLD IS DYING / Bereft of our right to exist - nevermore shall we depredate another
kingdom / Tremendous horror will sprout from the seeds of our own ruthlessness - and drain the fruits of our civilization / As maggots we lived and as maggots we die now / Eternal ravens, they feed on my skin / But I can't perceive any pain no more / I feel hell
demanding my soul / My creator, he calls me back to his realm / I now become one of them / I am fixated / I am a bloody statue / CEASELESS AGONY / We must not lose sight of our failing ever again

All I see is fire.
