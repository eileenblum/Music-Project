These tears of sadness
Falling with the grace of autumn leaves

I have walked the path
Carried my mournful wounds

A burden I am (to you)
That is why I spilled my tears

These tears of sadness
Symbolise the absence of thoughts
(What have I done to deserve this)
That is why I cry
As the silence withers
These mournful tears of sadness
