Waves wander the sea
Millenium mirrors reflect
Disappearing without a trace

When time was restrained to descent
The ocean disappeared
and vast deserts
They were revealed
We sank into the desert
The Dreamking and I..........

I Died.... I Died....

And we became one
I left my mortal coil
there in the desert
As we sank desert

We were reborn.....
We wander the sea
All but one
All but one
All but one
