Deserts of vast eternity
from which I cannot escape
Oh, woe be upon me
The pain of solitude

Choirs of damnation
Chanting in my dreams
'Life shall be no more
Life - thou shalt diea

Not shall the knife
Sleep in my hand
I lament and bewail
As my soul withers

Alone I wander
This be the fate I choose
An inner, desolate void
I shall fear no more
