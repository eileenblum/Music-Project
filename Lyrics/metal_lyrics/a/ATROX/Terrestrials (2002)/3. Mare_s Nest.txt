At last I've found you. You're here, you're mine, you're a machine. Hear my tales, decipher my dreams, tell me things.
So happy. What can I use you for - ogling, nestling, coddling? Keep up the spirit, enliven me, keep me alive, don't let me die.
You're beautiful as only you -Heebie-jeebies! - You blow bubble-flies into my belly. Have a glass of gastric juice, have it all. 
I want to see you cry. I want to see you hurt. Let those tears flow. Shall I cut onions for your eyes? Let your tears flow.
Miss me, long for me, be desperate for me. You're a jumping jack, you're a golliwog. Maybe you don't exist at all.
Warm hands when they're numb of holding you so tight. Stay in your nest and I'll put a flea in your ear.
Paroxysm - craving much. Cataclysm - giving much. You stay in your nest.
