Do not leave. Leave me weak. Do not leave me alone with this loony they say is me.
A mooncalf - I am in panic, I am manic. A changeling. Pinioned, crippled. I am, believe.
I can't come to terms with the terrestrials. I can't come to terms with me.
A lifetime's worth of tears gathered up in me. I've been on the verge of tears all my life. How can you be me?
I'm postponing my life again as so many times before. Self-pity is my substitute for others mercy. Contempt is my comfort.
