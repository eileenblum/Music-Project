My tentacles ache
This phantom pain is oh so confusing
I'm extraneous matter to the world
And so estranged

Look at me any way you want
My components are human and human and human and human
Strip me down to humanity
And cut me up into human and human and human and human
Into atoms of the fragile
I'm human I'm human I'm human

See I bleed red like you
What was that? Thought I heard you cuckoo

It may be I speak moron fluently
But you may be - if possible - even lamer than me
Yeah you could out-moron me anytime
We'll both stay with the mooncalves
Cause we're both aliens
Equally expendable
Equally valuable
So let's talk moron to moron
What's so great about being unique anyway?
We all are
