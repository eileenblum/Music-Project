If you can't cope with the answers don't bother to ask
If you can't cope with the sights don't bother to look

Once you've seen it you can't make it unseen
Once you've heard it you can't make it unheard

You just stay ignorant
The easier it is to fool you
All you'll know is
That you just don't know

- Relax my intention is absolutely not to tell you that...
Lalala I'm not listening
- Don't worry I can assure you my intention is not to tell you about...
Lalala I can't hear you

Don't bother your pretty little head
Knowing too much can't be good for you

If you can't cope with the knowledge don't bother to learn
If you can't cope with the stench don't dother to smell

Once you've heard it you can't make it unheard
Once you've seen it you can't make it unseen
