We've been blind pretending we can see
Been as dazed as dazed can be
We'd turn up to the light to see what the darkness looks like

Let's share this vigil

I would sing you a lullaby
If I wanted you to fall asleep
I would tell the truth
If I wanted you to fall from grace
I would make you murder me
If I wanted you to fall apart
