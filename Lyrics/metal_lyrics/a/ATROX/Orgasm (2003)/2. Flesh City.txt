Here where the dead mourn for the living

We eat cannibals before they attack
We eat cannibals and ask afterwards

We can't control our headless horses
As the mongrels snap at their feet

Masturbating teens round every corner
Euphoric with daze and violent with lust
The virgin rapes in clumsy manners
Claims innocence and yells at his scapecock

We constantly move graveward but
We ache too much with greed to actually die
We practice compulsory revival
Of the suicidal

Producing child-size armour and straitjackets for kids
Lobotomizing angels as leper eats their wings
Building drive-thru brothels of glass
Aborting alien fetuses with drill
Serving fillets of genitals in restaurants
Life is but a scream within a scream within a scream
