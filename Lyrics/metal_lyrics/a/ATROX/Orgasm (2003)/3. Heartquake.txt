How I'd love to experience a heartquake
But oh so afraid it will end up with a heartache

These untimely little deaths
Would leave me out of breath
Life would flash before my eyes

You might become a liability
And I a reliability
Still I'd know how it feels

The absence
Is highly present
It smothers me
Absorbs me like a black hole
The absence of longing
Fills up time and space
Tons and tons of emptiness
Weigh upon me

You're a bumpkin groping and falling
But you're my pumpkin prescious adoring
Wish for you to say it
First

Better to have failed in true love
Than never knowing what you long for
Better to feel pain
Than to feel nothing
