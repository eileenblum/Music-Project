Seeing how the lines keep crossing
And how we meet again
Observing how the coincidence is moving
The space I'm in
The room we're sharing
So much smaller now
Funny how the perspective is exceeding

Such a strange construction
Very badly drawn
He was a new engineer
He wasn't from here
Couldn't see it
The vantage point is rising
I can see it now
Got to go change my perspective
There's towers disturbing
My excellent view

Gotta go change all the angles now
Gotta go change my perspective now
Changing my perspective
Gotta go change all the angles now
Gotta go change my perspective now
Changing my point of view

Cutting to the bone and through it
Broken now is healing
Allowing myself to open
What was meant for me

Leaving what is safe
Leaving the garden
Such a strange sensation
This urge I've got for motion
Got to go looking around
I'm leaving what is safe
I leave the garden

Creating a map
Put yourself in the middle
Changing my perspective
Constructing a world
To fit with your plan
Changing my point of view
Pay close attention to every detail
Changing my perspective
There are images bigger than this
Changing my point of view
