Show me the warning
Show me everything I need to know
Show me the warning
I haven't tried this before

Gotta get away
Gotta get away
Oh, I'm tripping
Just one more time
And I know it's for real

This is my vengeance
And I know this time I will win
Don't you try and disappoint
The maker and the creator

Show me the warning
