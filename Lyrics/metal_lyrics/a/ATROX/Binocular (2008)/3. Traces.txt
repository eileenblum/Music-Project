Did you ever reconsider your life
Did you ever try to turn your motion twist
Did you ever believe in yourself
Do you still need the proof

Been choosing to walk under ladders
For much too long, much too long
Been trying to get back
To where the connection starts

White solitary statues
Looking at me
Standing sideways
White solitary statues
Wearing nothing but time

If you can relate to this
We can be on top of it once again
The climber needs something
To be getting over

Going into overdrive
Readjust to the level I am on

just as I turned away
you came and changed it all
Because your eyes kept seeing

Traces, traces of phases
Leaving traces
Leaving traces on faces

Did you ever reconsider your life
Your position changing
Following your flow
Are you willing to climb once again
Do you stay on the ground
Could you ever hear that knock on your door
Banging louder, louder
time is catching up with you once again
And you know you're in charge

Just as I turned away
You came and changed it all
Because your eyes kept seeing

Waiting for the moment to arrive
Waiting for the moment
Wait for it
