Re-connect to an earlier time
The place of understanding
Seeing, knowing
Everything has changed

The memory keeps it open
Tick-tocking like a time bomb
The memory keeps it clear

Somehow the pace is higher
Got to adjust my timing skills
Somehow the taste so sweet
Swallow the pill and make it there

Popsicle

Leaving sticky marks on the floor
Leaving fingerprints on the door

Using mirrors, to see around corners
Play the game, hide away
Using cameras to re-connect

The memory keeps on spinning
If I return I will stay there
The schedule keeps me on time

Keep me running
Keep me awake
Keep me running
Keep me awake

The fading image is now
Popsicle
