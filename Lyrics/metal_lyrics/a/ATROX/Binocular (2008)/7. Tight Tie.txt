Wearing my tight tie
My new white shirt
The official image
Is ready to start the day

Flawless on the outside

Deciding what role I'm playing
Got my lifestyle habit
I will not change

Polished I am...

Who do you want me to be?

Visions of grandeur
Bigâ big fantasy
Fixing what's dull in the reality
Change around
So I can soothe them all

You have no idea what's going on
And how I hide my tracks
I will deny every wrongdoing

This might be the cover story
This might be the big breakthrough
I'm in the news â I'm in the news

Marking off my territory
Putting up my fences
I can still see you...
