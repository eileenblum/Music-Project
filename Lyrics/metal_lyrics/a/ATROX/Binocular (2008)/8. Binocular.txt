Oh, it's that feeling again
Can't deny it
I have been without it for so long
Oh, it's a crazy idea, and I like it
You gave directions all the way

You came, you conquered
Took me for a spin
And i liked it
I was good, it was good
The questions are deleted
Found the essence
Want to keep it
And I should, and I should

See, did you see them colors
They were brighter
So much happened in such short time
We went along with the madness again
Oh, been down, been down

Rise
Get up and take control
It is good
Rise
Will not let you tempt me
Though I should

Seems like I'm searching again
There's nothing more to find
Seems like I'm leaving again
So long, leave it all behind

Don't know what's left of me
'Cause I gave it all to you
So thankful for what you took away

Been down down been around
Been a digger
