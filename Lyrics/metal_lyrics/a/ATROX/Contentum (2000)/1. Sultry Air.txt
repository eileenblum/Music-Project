The days lean against
One another
And glide slowly into slippers
Of gathering darkness
Eve walks with velvet tread
Towards my orchard
Sinks in the tarn within me

A motion in the corner of my eye
Someone's heart beating time with mine

Your heart glows through your skin
Your heart expands and contracts

Your smile in my hair
Your laughter all in me
You're travelling through my veins
Florid embrace
Strawberry mouth
I'm filled to the edges with you
