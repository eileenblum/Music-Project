I am the Ignoramus But he believes he is concealed when blindfolded And he believes he can
read minds Words written in ink on
cerebral paper And he believes if he becomes learned he'll die, therefore he ignores all
wisdom And he believes sweetness
would wipe him out, therefore he tortures himself And I'm no longer the ignoramus
