Some time ago
And for a period of time
I lived on another planet
And in another galaxy
Where time
Didn't exist

There were no seasons
No nights or days
There were no calendars
No hourglasses

Sometimes I wrote letters to earth
To ask what year, what season it was
Sometimes I wrote letters to earth
To find out how old I had become

And sometimes I was seventy years old
But other times my granddad wasn't even born
So my letters to him were returned
And I had to note on the envelope
Which year it was supposed to arrive in
Once, for a test, I sent a letter addressed
"Planet Tellus anno 2050"
But I never got neither an answer nor the letter in return

I don't know how long I lived there
I forgot the meaning of words like
"Tomorrow" and "soon" and "suddenly"
I became both patient and impatient

The strange thing, though
Even if time didn't exist
I always had plenty of time
