Peek through the hole
And enjoy the lizard dance
Come see the lizards' dance
Out of their skin

See them throw their first tails
Watch the hundredth tail
Form behind a purple body
Come see the lizards' hypnotic dance
See them dance out of their skin...
...and slip into the cauldron

"poor lizards
swimming naked in icy water
I'll light a fire under you...
...if I can only find other matches..."

"you fool!
You can't cook soup on me
I can stand the heat
I'll sprawl in your mouth
I'll curl round your tongue
And I can assure you won't relish me
But...here, have my tail
And now give me my swim mask
I want to explore this kettle!"
