The autumn sun is restrained to wither
as the winter assumes with its pale pride

The last of life is smothered
Only the remembrance of a season's departure is left behind
as a ghastly hand sweeps the landscape
The eternal conquering of seasons
And deprivement of beauty and life
The sun is restrained to wither
Only to perish into the twilight of seasons

An eternal eclipse between phases of conquering
