[Music: COLIN-TOCQUAINE / GUIGOU]
[Lyrics: COLIN-TOCQUAINE]

Life after death through out the ages facinates man
Funeral the deads ritual frees the souls
An opened door to a second life

Embaulm cadavers for thousand years lie six feet under
Symbols of death cover the coven with precious stones
To pay the toll to cross the styx

[Lead : Alex COLIN-TOCQUAINE]

Come with the dead to heaven or hell then rest eternally
Dream of mankind immortality will stay a secret for
Eternity

Life after death through out the ages facinates man
funeral is the deads ritual

[Lead : Alex COLIN-TOCQUAINE]

Burial desecreation
