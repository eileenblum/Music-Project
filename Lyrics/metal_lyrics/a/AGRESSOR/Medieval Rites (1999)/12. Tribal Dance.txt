[Music &amp; Lyrics : Alex COLIN-TOCQUAINE]

Look inside the past
Of humanity
Hear the tribes
Tearing the forest serenity
According to ritual
They gathered at night
To pray the gods of nature
Throught their tribal dance

Look inside your past
and face the heritage
Left by the ancients
And find a thruth who scares
Now read in your heart ,
Free your demons
Exorcize your fears
And face your soul

I summon you
To gather at dawn
To dance around the fire
And push the border of your mind
Hey !my tribes, hail my name
Worship me forever
In your tribal dance

Look inside you
Deep inside-..
