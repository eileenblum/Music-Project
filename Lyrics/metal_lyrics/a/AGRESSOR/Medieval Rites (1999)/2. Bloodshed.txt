[Music &amp; Lyrics : Alex COLIN-TOCQUAINE]

Rains of fire fall from the sky
Warmachine spread death
Under the siege the castle resist
To waves of soldiers assaulting the town walls

Noone survived on the battlefield
The aggressors attack with no mercy
Noone survived under a rain of steel
A bloodshed forever written

Enemies invade territories
Burning the land, raping your wives
Dogs of war now arrive
Just pray for your life

Bloodshed

The fog now rise among the army
Of winged soldiers blowing fire
With the blazing sky and the plagues
Near is the end of the war

Prepare for the ultimate fight
The grim reaper 's approaching now
The weak will no longer survive
Just pray for your life

Noone survived on the battlefield
The aggressors attack with no mercy
Noone survived under a rain of steel
A bloodshed forever written
