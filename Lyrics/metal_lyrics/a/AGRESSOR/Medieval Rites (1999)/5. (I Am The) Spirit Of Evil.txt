[Music &amp; Lyrics : Alex COLIN-TOCQUAINE]

I am the spirit of evil
Back from the dead
I'm here now out of darkness
To haunt your fucking nights

I am the spirit of evil
Back from the dead
And you'll suffer

I was lost in the darkness searching the light
Glowing eyes showed me the way out
Through the tunnel of smoke i ride the light
And now i'm back to life, you're gonna die

I'm your worst nightmare
I am the spirit of evil
