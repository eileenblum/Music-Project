[Music &amp; Lyrics : Alex COLIN-TOCQUAINE]

My heart bleeds
Pain engulf my soul
I feel despair
Loneliness tear me

I'm a damned soul
Condemned to suffer
So dark so sweet
Are my thoughts

Would you embrace death and follow me till the end
With this thorn in my cold stoned heart and my shattered hopes

My heart 's still bleeding aahhh ! !
Now bless my soul
Lost in the shadows

Forever shattered
My heart's been torn and i wander around
