[Music &amp; Lyrics : Alex COLIN-TOCQUAINE]

Tonight as the full moon rise
Trees are speaking. Weird!
Magnetic stones charge the air
As we enter the domain of
The sorcerer

Mother nature gave us the power
To read in her vein and live with less pain

Who's gonna read this tongue
Who's gonna spread this tongue

Make one with universe
To charm, to curse

A legacy from ancient time
Rituals spread by word
Incantations, esoteric rites
Condemned by church
[Lead : James Murphy]
The sorcerer
Spider webs, dusty bottles
Antique book inside the circle

Venomous snakes float in the bottle
Batwings concoction boil
Toad eyes powder for magic filters
Praise under the moon

Witchcraft eternal praise
Break the oath go to blaze
Lord of shades dance on your grave
Sin fear of god
Witchery eternal quest
Evil or secret of life
Wisdom flame of knowledge
Shadows he knows
The sorcerer
