TERRIFYING CRIES INVADE THE CHAMBER
FROM THE DUNGEON OF TORTURE HIDDEN IN THE CASTLE
I SMELL THE BURNING FLESH
I SEE THE INSTRUMENTS OF TERROR
I FEEL THAT ONLY DEATH WILL STOP MY PAIN

TWO GUARDIANS ARRIVE AND BRING ME OUT
THEN I KNEW THAT MY LAST TIME HAD COME
NOW I FEEL THE BLOOD TASTE IN MY MOUTH
FEAR OF PAIN MY HEART ACCELERATES

I FEEL THE BLOOD FLOWING IN MY VEINS

TRYING TO ESCAPE, I ENGAGE IN BATTLE
BUT THE GUARDIANS STRIKE BACK
THE FORCES LEAVE ME, THE FIGHT IS LOST

I WOKE UP UNCHAINED TO THE WALL OF THE CHAMBER
FLAMES FROM THE TORCHES LIGHT THE TABLE OF BLOOD
VISIONS OF DISMEMBERED CORPSES LIE ON THE FLOOR
PAINFUL DEATH THE HANGMAN APPROACH TO 

TORTURE

[SOLO ALEX]

UNCHAINED TO THE WALL, NO WAY TO ESCAPE
TIGHT CHAINS TEAR MY FLESH, PAIN BEGINS
I FEEL THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
PENETRATE MY BODY AND GRIND MY BONES
BLOOD'S FLOWING MY LIFE ESCAPES

THE HANGMAN TOOK THE AXE AND CUT OFF MY HAND
BLOOD'S FLOWING MY HAND MOVES ON THE FLOOR
FLAMES FROM THE TORCHES BURNING MY FACE BURNING MY EYES
THEN I FEEL A KNIFE UNDER MY SKIN

I FEEL THE PAIN
I SCREAM IN VAIN
I'M GONNA DIE
