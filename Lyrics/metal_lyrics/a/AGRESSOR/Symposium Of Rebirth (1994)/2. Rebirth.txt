[MUSIC: COLIN-TOCQUAINE/GUEGAN]
[LYRICS: COLIN-TOCQUAINE]
[BASS: JOEL GUIGOU]

YOU'RE FALLING
YOU JUMPED FROM THE BRIDGE
YOU FLY IN THE AIR
IN ONE MOMENT
YOU'LL TOUCH THE GROUND
YOUR GUTS WILL FLOW
YOUR SKULL WILL EXPLODE

REBIRTH?

LIKE AN OLD WARRIOR
YOU DIVE ON YOUR TARGET
WHAT DO YOU FIGHT?
IS IT YOUR LIFE?
IS IT YOUR MIND?

YOUR SOUL NOW FLYS AWAY
MEETING THE GODS

[SOLO ALEX]

YOU'RE WALKING IN THE SHADOW KINGDOM
SEARCHING THE LIGHT
YOUR ACT MAY MEAN YOUR REBIRTH
BUT NOW FOR US YOU'RE DEAD

[BASS SOLO JOEL]
[SOLO ALEX]

YOUR REBIRTH MEANS YOUR LAST TIME DOWN HERE
IN ANOTHER WORLD YOUR SOUL WILL REBORN

[THIS SONG IS DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF ERIC BERQUISIER RIP]
