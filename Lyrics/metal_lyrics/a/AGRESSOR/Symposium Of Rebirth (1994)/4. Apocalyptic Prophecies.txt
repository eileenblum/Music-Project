[BASS: JOEL GUIGOU]

THREE RELIGIONS: CHRISTIANS JEWS MOSLEMS PRAYING TO THE SAME
GOD, CALL HIM HOW YOU WANT: WIND HAZARD TIME, LET IT BE DONE

ALWAYS FIGHTING TO CONQUER THEIR SACRED LAND
FOLLOWING THE PROPHETS WORDS AND DYING IN HIS NAME
RELIGIOUS CONVICTION EMERGE
UNDER FALSE IMAGE

SOMEONE WILL RISE FROM THEM
WILL SPREAD HIS WORDS
AND WILL LEAVE US
A WORLD IN DECAY

BLOODY BATTLEFIELD WHERE ARE LYING DEAD
IN URBAN WAR BULLETS &amp; STONES SPREAD DEATH
THE PRIESTS ARE PRAYING FOR PEACE
THE SOLDIERS ARE TRAINING TO KILL

[THEME: ALEX]
[CHOIRS FROM "OPERA DE LYON"]

HEY! HEATHEN LISTEN TO ME
IN A WORLD OF DIFFERENCES SCREAM YOUR HATE
PERSONAL THOUGHT BECOME A FIGHT
ON THE WAY TO THE DIVINE LIGHT

WHY? TO AWAIT THE JUDGMENT OF GOD...
