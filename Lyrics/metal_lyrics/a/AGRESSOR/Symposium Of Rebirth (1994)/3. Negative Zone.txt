WEIRD UNIVERSE
ALL IS REVERSED
NO TIME NO LAWS
IN THE UNKNOWN

ENTER THE NEGATIVE ZONE
ENTER...

FLOWING CREATURES
IN SOLID STATE
PARADOXAL RUPTURE
IN THE FORBIDDEN GATE
SEE YOUR REFLECTED
SOUL IN THE DARK
CONVICTED IMAGE
TO THE OTHER SIDE

ENTER THE NEGATIVE ZONE
ENTER...

[SOLO MANU]

ENTER...

[SOLO ALEX]

BETRAYERS LURK FROM YOUR SIGHT
AWAIT ORDERS TO STAB YOUR BACK

...ENTER...
