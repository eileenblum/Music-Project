For a thousand years
My voice has gone
I can't understand this brutality
Day by day
The dreams are destroyed
Ambition is greater than everything
The rulers
Most of them
Don't care about everybody's welfare
And our planet
Goes toward the chaos
Where the meek suffer

Open your eyes to the world
We have our share of blame
And if the achievements come late to us
They will be left to the future generations

At the moment that millions of dollars are spent
On nuclear tests and stupid wars
Thousands die of hunger and starvation
Aids and cancer take their toll
And society is terrorized by drugs
Violence and injustice

Open your eyes to the world
We have our share of blame
And if the achievements come late to us
They will be left to the future generations

Society mides their problems
Like turning a page you don't want to read
Cowardice of the rulers shocks me
Are we cowards too?
