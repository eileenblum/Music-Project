To the old man in the end of life
Don't rest more nothing
To leave the long days to pass
Waiting for the death
In soul bring the great pain
Of exclusion and forsake
And today your mind is full
Of questions without response

What the old man want to say
The words don't organize more
And be with touched expression
When know that old brothers die
And your soon forget you

The long live was to past
And the time to make rude all
They don't get to create affective
Win the sorrow and the pride

Don't back the time and to begin
And the past will torture you until the end
For the old man rest the guilty and lonely
For the life of indifference and hostility
