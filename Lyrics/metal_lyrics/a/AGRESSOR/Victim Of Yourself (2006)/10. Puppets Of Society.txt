People are different
Leaving his own personality
Living together in the same society
Overrating materialism
Many are not what they seem to be
Just playing a role
Selling his soul to the devil
For pleasure of riculess and ostentation

I hate the greedy ones
The false and liars
That idolize money and power
And those that respect
You for what you have
Not for what you are
Puppets of society

They think they are superior
But they are puppets of society
That without understanding
Are always demanding from you
They wanna set fadisms
The way you dress, your hairstyle
Even the music you listen
Never forget you are free

I hate the greedy ones
The falses and liars
That idolize money and power
And those that respect
You for what you have
Not for what you are
Puppets of society
