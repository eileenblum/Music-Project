Dr wouter basson
Diabolical mind
Of apartheid system
In south Africa

Basson was an army officer
And ran project coast
A program of chemical and biological weapons
Against the opposites to apartheid
Mass contamination weapons
Killing microorganisms are created
Anthrax cigarettes, salmonella sugar

Commission of truth and reconciliation
Found documents and witnesses
It was forty-six charges against basson
Judge hartzenberg dismissed the deponents
And acquitted them for lack of proofs
But the struggle is not over
