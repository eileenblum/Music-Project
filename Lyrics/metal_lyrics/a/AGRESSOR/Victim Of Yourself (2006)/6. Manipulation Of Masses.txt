Watch out
They want to brainwash us
The overbearing power
Intends to take hold
TV, papers and radios
Act on the unconscious
Silent conspiracy
That changes your mind

Don't believe in the media
In all they tell
Seek others sources of information
And make up your mind

Manipulation of information - in your mind
Manipulation of information - and of your destiny

Tendencies communication
Legitimizing interests
Verbal illusion
Collective brainwashing

Don't believe in the media
In all they tell
Seek others sources of information
And make up your mind

Manipulation of information - in your mind
Manipulation of information - and of your destiny
