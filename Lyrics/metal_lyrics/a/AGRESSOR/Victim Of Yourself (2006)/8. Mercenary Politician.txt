Mercenary politician that eludes the population
Corrupt false now they are your friends
A handshake a strong embrace
To kiss a slum boy you bastard
Your falseness touches me
You can use your hypocrisy
In a trick previously prepared
To take the beast to the power

Mercenary politician promising what you can't do
Education safety are your aims now
Feigning worry under pledge of changes
At coast of a vote you pig
It's a sad reality
Your promises are a trap
Prepared by your rabble
To the ordinary helpless people

Your frauds will be found out
The swindles will be exposed
But as always it will go unpunished
Your dirty money can't corrupt many people
Seduce other ones but not everybody

Your crime is indiscussable
But the justice is failed
Your social condition helps your
Impartiality revolt's me
Mercenary politician
Death warranty is your fate
There must be something in your conscience
Which hurts you till the end of your life
