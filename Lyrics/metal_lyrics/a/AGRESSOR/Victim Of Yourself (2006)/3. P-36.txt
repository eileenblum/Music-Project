Sirens blast
Panic strikes the workers
Rescue team stand by
Hurry to put out the fire
In one of the stilts of the oil rig
At this very moment they're took by surprise
For a great blast takes form
There is nothing more to do

P-36 goes down
Carrying with it
The bodies of the workers
Soon the tragedy will be forgotten
Remaining only the pain of the families

The authorities try to provide answers
Without admitting their own blame
Rope always breaks on the weakest point
New contracts replacing those who are gone
But what to do about the marks
And nightmares left on the orphans??

P-36 goes down
Carrying with it
The bodies of the workers
Soon the tragedy will be forgotten
Remaining only the pain of the families

Oil rigs are like
Volcano at high sea
At any time
Will take their toll for the negligence
Of the irresponsibility
And indifference of the authority
