In depth in dark from the farthest boundaries
An infinite power spreading his dream of fear

This damngerous curse
Comes from the unknown land
It's the first time, you open the gates
And day after day
Developing its unformed mess
Sprawling arms, guts and bumps
Invade all your carcass

You can't stop this UNKNOWN SPELL
These bumps tear your brain
You can't stop this UNKNOWN SPELL
It's a psychological pain

One day time will come
The spell will leave your brain
You'll be ripped and torn
And your brain will be erased
