Life isn't worth living
A smashed up logic rules our instincts
In our world, life has no sense
But it's not a sense
It's a desire
Everyone knows that our motion of time
Changes it's voice according to our fancy
Intense pleasure spotting from my guts
Invade your wet body

Creeping over your mind
Tearing your phantasm
Infectious contence of life
Rules all of your acts

Human race raugh procreate a chain of circumstances
Will stop in your life
Everyone choose his ideal
Don't be trapped

Feel these abstract emotion
Invade your neurosensors
Pleasure and pain rule you...till death

This plague is here, there's no way to hide
High level of contamination
Cos it's a PARALYTIC DISEASE
