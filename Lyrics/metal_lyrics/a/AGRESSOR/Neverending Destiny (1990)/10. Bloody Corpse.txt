In the night the wind of war blows towards that plain
Black horseman await the command to start the fight of pain
Shield and dagger, all weapons gleam in the dark night
Spirit of death and the lord of war breed an evil might

[Chorus:]
As the signal is done the slaughter
begins and the soldiers starts to fight
Disaster, pain and tear invade all of this peaceful land
Come from hell, the horsemen with the unholy fight
In an endless cry the massacre stops
but see the BLOODY CORPSE

In the air, on the land, at sea and everywhere
War and panic, flesh and blood are creeping through this world
But some survivers have joined their forces to kill again their mystic powers
The legend comes back when the mystic warrior is pack

[Repeat chorus]

Barbaric roars and noises of war, revenge and fortune is ours
Unchained slaves and their holy priests have lost their powers
The demons quam their fortress when their lord celebrates his victory
Wizards invoke the mystic forces to fight the hordes

But the wind of war is still blowing through this night
Invisible mystic forces without mercy
Emerged from nowhere, that warrior has gone
A mayhemic destruction, it's a plague which picks the bones

[Repeat chorus]
