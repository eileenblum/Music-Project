Since the dawn of time, values we've declined deranged the path to transcendence
Principles deployed, restlessly decoyed submission marks our indifference
Apathy stripped our souls of imperative empathies and we don't complain
Liberty we dreamily traded for false security have we gone insane?

Decide, to decide the inside of your insight
Torn asunder, the beasts of burden.
Decide, to de-side, the inside of your insight
Reside just beside, the full sight of your outside
Defy to define, the refined that you will find
Decide, inside no longer the Beasts of Burden

Rules and fools go hand in hand in blindness tools for the new order casting its promise malice
Tasting the imperial lie wasting the sanctified equal as modern slaves to the graves

No peace of mind, no serenity fake embodiment of identity
We willingly shrouded morality don't you see our obsessive reality?
Rotten norms we validate kept us bowing while growing our hate
Are we destined to suffer the weight and celebrate, grand conformity they legislate?

Stacked, corroded pessimists crushed industrial masochists
Gripe conjointly divided we remain pathway to be conquered in the brain
Paralysing loss, privacies we've tossed it's time we start to evolve
Louder is the voice, clearer is the choice that will never perish or dissolve
Realize, we are not creatures merely feasting on demise absorb the truth
Liberty cannot be traded for false security and now you see it too
