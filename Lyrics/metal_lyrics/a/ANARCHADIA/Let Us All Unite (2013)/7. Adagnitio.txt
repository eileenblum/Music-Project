I am the essence of light Heaven and hell they dwell in me
Conceived as the universe started imploding immaculately
I hold your salvation I spawn your impalpable doom
Exponent omnipotent from the cradle to your tomb
You have witnessed my signs the ancient possessions that slipped your primitive minds
Those who embraced my inner strength enslaved you, till the end of time
Concealed exerted abused by the perverted

Descended to fill the void while your ignorance expanded the concept I mourn your putrid pathetic forfeit
Embrittled, you have lost all your sources to unequivocally frivolous forces
Exiled in a bedlam of eminent embodiment, how you regiment
Your sentiments to the elements of non-sense lament
Consciousness fathomed the bliss foresaw the claws of the parallel kiss
Venomous, to decadence the masters used their will
I gaze with a blaze at your phase of standing still
Motionless, stagnant, are your minds blinded from the fight that leads to my divine,
The precious redemption it creates envision your next plan towards me
See beyond the purpose. Break the vicious circles that sealed your fate

I am the essence of light Heaven and hell they dwell in me
Conceived as the universe started imploding immaculately
I hold your salvation I spawn your impalpable doom
Exponent omnipotent from the cradle to your tomb
You have witnessed my signs your dormant existence shall reach its final line
The limitless incentive to epiphany emancipates you until the end of time
