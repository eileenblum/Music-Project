For so long I have traded my fate
To reconcile with the demons within
Countless times I have looked death in the eye
A high price you pay when you struggle to win
How many scars have I embraced along the way?
How many walls have I demolished so I could proudly say?

Invincible,I have become a rebel spirit on the run
Invincible, I have become a rebel spirit on the run
Invincible I have become, a rebel spirit on the run
Untouchable a misfit son, grasp it or shit it the war's begun
Invincible I have become, a rebel spirit on the run
Unthinkable how wars are won, grasp it and spit it, be the chosen one

I have pledged allegiance to a certain cause
A path was proven by some it would collapse
Pile up the sheep within marginal thoughts
But the margin was never for me I knew I would relapse
Labyrinths are the motive for your virgin sanity
Your everlasting lucid wanders illustrate duality

Without stretching my mind, I could have never earned my freedom
It was a simple yet a powerful choice, I confronted my demons
Could never leave myself locked up in a cage, not when I am bleeding
I knew the day would come and my roar would define the ultimate meaning.

Destiny is a step ahead, in every trivial detail you pretend to deny
Every sign is a spiritual conflict, but the truth is right before your eyes
No more extortion I have burnt the gallows' pole
No more indoctrination,only pure determination
There shall be no fucking intention, to ever alter my direction
Burden eradication, a new found infatuation
Destiny is a step ahead, in every trivial detail you pretend to deny
Every sign is a spiritual conflict, but the truth is right before your eyes
