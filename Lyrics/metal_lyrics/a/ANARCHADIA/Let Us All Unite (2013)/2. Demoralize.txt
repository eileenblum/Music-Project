Freeze now and pay attention to the alarm
Breathe out now you are fucked by the lethal charm
We don't need no crystal ball to predict our horrid fate
Mind-trapped by the corporate love machine,spilling its dogmatic plague

It is no secret, this sacred curse
Concealing what it's worth
Mankind brought down to their knees
Well disguised even the truth could not set them free
Demoralize destabilize
What has been established to appear so sublime

Material extension, at the expense of human souls
Bedevils those who surrender,to the system's protocols
The collective ego only justifies why the poor are bereft of rights
No limitations required,when ideals are compromised.

How long, will the conscious wheel keep turning?
How come we don't mourn the loss of lust for learning?
How far are we willing to crawl through this travesty?
How blind are we to neglect questioning authority
