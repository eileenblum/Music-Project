Ages of social upheavals been staged, restlessly seeking mass control
The global empire, the false pacifier, shall no longer take its toll
Repugnant art of the wicked instinctively provoked the beast
Dehypnotized against the forces of corruption now conquering every wall and every street

One for all this is the wake up call
Behold the fascist fall occupy the wall
One for all this is the wake up call
Behold the fascist fall occupy the wall

Complete disposal of denial revolution of the mind
The oath we solemnly take is finally awake "Riot is the language of the unheard"
Catastrophe,Economy segments of wretched slavery
No wonder,we still ponder through grim identical policies.

Unholy deficits define the elite inevitable financial depression
Higher ups exposed, yet their visions imposed a mindless fusion reeks delusion
We have been elements of consumption but reality's infection is passing away
Each crisis is funded by the men behind the curtains when lives are derivatives on display
