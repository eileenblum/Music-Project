[feat. Jon Schaffer]Here they come, the neglected words the screams of the active minds
We still recall, the universal call where truth and truth collide
Their seeds of oppression, and history's mission
Clear lessons for all to see The Promised Land conspiracy
We deciphered your design discrimination is intertwined
You feed the project of the new century thus your wars are justified

Distance is no longer a border
Respect existence or expect resistance
The chant of the true world order
A bleeding poet not a breathing soldier
Respect existence or expect resistance
The chant of the true world order
True world order is real

Defy the top of the capstone enforcing the master plan that you are all alone
And subject to terrorist attacks so we will fight them in their land, but we are never coming back
The media of segregation welcomes world depopulation
They will violate your core perception
To make you fall for the great deception problem reaction solution
As the masses chase the illusion of freedom

Defy the top of the capstone enforcing the master plan that you are all alone
Watch out, the anonymous flounce the mirror of all your crimes
Like an iron fist, we will coexist and forever stand the test of time
This darkness will alter, and your minions will falter
We will crush your fantasy, and retrieve our destiny
