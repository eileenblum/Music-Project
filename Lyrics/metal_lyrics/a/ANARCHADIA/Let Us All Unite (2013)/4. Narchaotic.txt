Indigenous will to start the journey unaware what this realm contains
Come trespass this sacred gate the passage to our domain
Arrhythmic world of hectic fury like a needle in your veins
Pale and saturated in habitual transgression hooked on dissolution and disorder
Symptoms of hypnosis firmly twisting our psychosis condoning our dismay a little longer

Kneel; you're marked in this delusion junkie thoughts feed your illusion
Forced fed, dependency extend your hands into fallacies
Cryptic shit will shape your cure choke to death, shallow death is pure
You inject your paradise dignity's blood you sacrifice

Intentions are irrelevant, to the merchants of misery
Logic becomes an irony, a step towards insanity
Get your fix and numb your senses, join the creep parade
Lucrative art of captivation minds under the merciless blade!

Will is confiscated, uncontrollably sedated to revel in its decimation.
Lacerated, defiled under the all Seeing Eye that's harbouring annihilation
Order out of chaos becomes the creed adhere to the conflict, arouse their greed.
Order out of chaos becomes the creed adhere to the conflict, connive and bleed!

Imagination in a nightmare of turmoil compelled to struggle till it rots and reeks
A monumentally dysfunctional society brings forth the revelation they plead
Chances scattered with unripe convictions let open wide the gates of hell!
We will surely be progressing in slaying all depictions when feeding this enchanting spell
Pale and saturated in habitual transgression hooked on dissolution and disorder
Symptoms of hypnosis firmly twisting our psychosis condoning our dismay a little longer!

Heal; you're free of this delusion one key thought is "kill your illusion"
Ingress to what you're meant to be transform your futile birth tendencies
Toxic plots never cured before they only left traces to the hidden door
March out, scream your lullaby or stay in and be another sacrifice
