[E. Kaldschmidt / E. Kaldschmidt]

There's a curse that rests on me
My misgivings won't let me be
I can see doom on its way
But there's nothing I can do or say

I can't interfere
When the end is near

I see tragic visions of death
That haunt me in my dreams
And take away my breath
Life ends in the hour of death
Which no one can foresee
Except for me

Any time death calls I can see
Pictures in my mind of ferocity
All the people about to die
Haunt me in my dreams and ask me why

Abandoned to your fate
When it is too late
