[E. Kaldschmidt / H. Ziegler]

You take advantage of other's misery
Always considering your own good

Hassle and corruption
A master of your trade
Causing inconvenience
Planning people's fate

No use to hide away
You take all what you want
But on judgement day
You'll know where you'll enÐ²

For all the troubles that you have caused you'll pay
You'll be damned for all time
You will never see the light of day adain
You are damned for all time
Damned for all time

For years you worked hard on yourself
Bulding an empire of fear

Power by oppression
Mischief paves your way
The number of your victims
Is growing day by day
Damned!
