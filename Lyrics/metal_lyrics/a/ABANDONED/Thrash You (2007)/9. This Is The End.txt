[E. Kaldschmidt / E. Kaldschmidt]

Can you see them coming?
Can you hear them bray?
Don't stop, keep on running
Death is on its way

Unrelenting forces
Evil, wild, and mean
Vast sadistic outrage
Nobody ever has seen

This is the end
They'll kill
This is the end
We'll die
One foot in hell
You'll see
This is the end
My friend
For you and me

Now they're getting closer
No one will defy
No use for resistance
Now it's time to die

Unrelenting forces
Crushing all the land
Incarnated evil
Getting out of hand

Can you see them coming?
Can you hear them bray?
Don't stop, keep on running
Death is on its way
