[E. Kaldschmidt / H. Ziegler]

Save me - I cannot stand this agony I feel
Hold me - now that my life comes to end
Release me - from this pain for this cannot be real
Embrace me - though you don't understand

Farewell - to all my friends
This is the end
I can't take it anymore
Goodbye - but don't you cry
Cos all the pain
Will be gone forevermore

Doctrine - your fucking principles make me get astray
Suffer - Now in my hour of death
Surrender - there's nothing left for me to do or say
Abandoned - while taking my last breath

If you were in my place
You wouldn't be the same
You couldn't stand this feeling
You couldn't stand the pain
So give me peace and save me
For the sake of humanity

Cos we can't live forever
But we can die in dignity
Die in dignity!

Save me - I cannot stand this agony I feel
Hold me - now that my life has an end
Release me - from this pain for this cannot be real
Embrace me - though you don't understand
