[Demo 2008 track]Find out the intentions
Behind eyes temptations
Who is getting the keys to decide?
You try the reasons
To find all solutions
But you cannot seem to describe

How freeze is into your heart?
An empty field to remind
A thousand mistakes and thoughts may clean up on your face

Run then leave you take my hand
To understand
Believe in what I say
You'll understand

Cry out your sensations
The true of revelations
You're lost in the middle of time
You're drifting in your dream
The clues like a sinner
Snake searching victims at night

You have been searching yourself for so long
Then leave you to take my hand
To understand
Believe in what I say
To understand
