You get to know
Why they enclose your mind
What's the joke?
Call suppression: life
You get to see
All the tricks behind
What's the poke that can bring them down?

We get to know
Why we depend on scarce resources
why we still claim for oil and gold?
don't you see how they put you away from
your independence day

Aplush final warning
Rudolf diesel says
A plush final warning
Stanley Meyer says
A plush final warning
Paul pantone says
Watch out! Live it up!
They want power
They will take you away

Undercity cries
Endless war
Dead forsaken minds
Than only a few geniuses survive
I got to say
You better run for life

You get know
We've been suppressed by the empire
Whose business groups just want control the system
On behalf of praise for power, glamour and fame

Aplush final warning
Rudolf diesel says
A plush final warning
Stanley Meyer says
A plush final warning
Paul pantone says
Watch out! Live it up!
They want power
They will take you away

To get the right answers
We don't know
Just make the right questions, go astray
we have been subdued before we born
time to reset the game
Watch out!

Aplush final warning
Rudolf diesel says
A plush final warning
Stanley Meyer says
A plush final warning
Paul pantone says
Watch out! Live it up!
They want power
They will take you away
