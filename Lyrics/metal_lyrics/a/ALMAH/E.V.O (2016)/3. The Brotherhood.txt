Her man
We're only one
One dream
One heart
One blood

We've grown
We had to leave behind
The fears and the childhood
'Cause there was only one

Only one
Way to carry one
When life stole our loved ones
That's the trail
Where we found our creed
Brotherhood

Hand in hand
Sown the fields of war
We will stand together
As only one
Honoring our memories
Brotherhood

Hey man
Almighty one
You made us steel and gold
Don't think despite the thorns
We'll give up
We knew the truth
'Cause there was only one...

Only one
Way to carry one
When life stole our loved ones
That's the trail
Where we found our creed
Brotherhood

Hand in hand
Sown the fields of war
We will stand together
As only one
Honoring our memories
Brotherhood

An unknown belief
Fills our dreams with what i say
To be signs from another world, another land
There was always only one...

Only one
Way to carry one
When life stole our loved ones
That's the trail
Where we found our creed
Brotherhood

Hand in hand
Sown the fields of war
We will stand together
As only one
Honoring our memories
Brotherhood
