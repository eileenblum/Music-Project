Energy into thoughts
Keep it in silence
Burn!
'til your freedom goes down

The future for their plot
We gotta overthrow 'em
It's time
To free our mind and soul
Corporate war

Burn!
Throw the faith against the walls
Jump in the fire
Burn!
Give 'em all their own laws

We gotta overthrow 'em
It's time
To free our mind and soul

Crucify
This future for their plot
We gotta overthrow 'em
It's time
To free our mind and soul
The final coup
