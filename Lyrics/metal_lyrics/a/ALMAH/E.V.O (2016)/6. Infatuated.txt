I'm breaking down the walls of fear
I've done so many things to understand
My subtle energy, the empirical
My ablaze life force

Infatuated
Infatuated

To get all you want, to live, you better runaway now
All you want, to live, you better find a way out
Livin' on the edge
You're not alone

You don't need to be a practitioner,
Fundamentalist or so
Just free your mind and live the here and now
For enlightening thoughts

Infatuated
Infatuated

To get all you want, to live, you better runaway now
All you want, to live, you better find a way out
Livin' on the edge
You're not alone
