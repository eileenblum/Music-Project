One million of worns incite the fear
One million of victims lost and killed
One more statistic for the news
Another family cries, just one more bill

They take your right to protect yourself
Steeling your guns, you pride and realm
Capital punishment
Falls only on you

Oh! No more illusions
I'm not a number
Oh! No more illusions

Which human rights they defend indeed?
What prison is colder, yours or their?
all values reversed in the name of greed
by 16 they had learned how to put you on knees

They take your rights to protect yourself
Steeling your guns, your pride and realm
Capital punishment
Falls on you

Oh! No more illusions
I'm not a number
Oh! No more illusions
I'm not a number
Oh! No more illusions
I'm not a number
Oh! No more illusions

"You may whrite me down in history, with your bitter, twisted lies,
you may trod me in the very dirt but still, like dust, I'll rise.
Does my sassiness upset you? why are you beset with gloom?
'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells pumping in my living room,
just like moons and like suns, with the certain of tides, still I'll rise."

Oh! No more illusions
I'm not a number
Oh! No more illusions
I'm not a number
Oh! No more illusions
I'm not a number
Oh! No more illusions
