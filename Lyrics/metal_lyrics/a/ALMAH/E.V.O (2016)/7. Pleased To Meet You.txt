We have abilities
We have affinities
we wonder when we'll die

Where's my humanity
That is behind the scene
We'll never see the light

We've lost our liberty
We sold our soul for greed
And then we pray for life

There's no morality
Irrationality
We're going back in time

Oh! Living in a absolute dark - alienated -
Oh! Runaway!

Pleased to meet you!
Unknown ways
Deep in the man lives
A glimpse of fate
We're going all against the clues
That the life presents us
Pleased to meet you!
Unknown ways
Please don't make me crawl out
We're digging our own grave
We're walking toward the ways
The point of no return
- no return -

We want complexity
N capability
There's no regret to learn

Oh! Living in a absolute dark - alienated -
Oh! Runaway!

Pleased to meet you!
Unknown ways
Deep in the man lives
A glimpse of fate
We're going all against the clues
That the life presents us
