For someone like me
With an open heart
just afraid of confrontations
Fear of life
There's no tomorrow
Just unknown tides

Far away from all your problems you can fly
higher than an eagle,
fast as a ray of light
you have no border
No limited mind
You're out of order

you fall deep down in space
Resemblance to the stars
Innocence
Immortal sense of life

Have you ever thought,
How we can teleport?
Anybody knows
How we can be alive?
We're not who we were
Just understand

For the the holy scriptures
Revelation's realm
For the science flaming eyes
A visionary
Where do you go now?
Expand your mind
Where do you go now?

you fall deep down in space
Resemblance to the stars
Innocence
Immortal sense of life

you fall deep down in space
Resemblance to the stars
Innocence
Immortal sense of life
Ungodly conscious sight
