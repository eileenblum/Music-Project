I'm walking through
A cold path
I'm alone

I can't feel a living form
I'm not anymore

When I bleed my body cries
It screams so loud
like a wolf

When the indigos arrive
And peace is found
So welcome home
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

A war is living around

Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!

A war is living around
A color caught in between
Purple and blue

Ina less materialistic way
Across the truth

In the world's transition
grace millennium
Time awaits

In a new dimension
A new salvation
Rises over again

You've been lonely
Lonely
You've been dreaming of a new world
You've been lonely
Lonely
It was not in vain
