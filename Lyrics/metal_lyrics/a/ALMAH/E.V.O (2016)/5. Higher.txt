Is there any truth behind the myth?
warriors in life, strong and brave
fearless and proud to conquer men
Oh!

Goddess of wisdom, lore and spell
fighting with shield, axe, arrow and bow
Riding the fields of the overwhelmed
The tale of the woman warrior

The ancient Greeks and Romans believed they came from
Caucasian Albania
The chant of the amazons still cries

Higher! Higher!
Climb the hills and glimpse the land
We still go higher

Amazons lived near the reign of gagarians in the northern's land
Where people worshiped the moon and rain
Oh!

Name of the king of kings, they spell
River that carries gold and rage
Amazon river, mermaid realm
Where demons just across the forest

The ancient Greeks and Romans believed they came from
Caucasian Albania
The chant of the amazons still cries

Higher! Higher!
Climb the hills and glimpse the land
We still go higher
Higher! Higher!
Stillness in the eerie night
We still go higher
