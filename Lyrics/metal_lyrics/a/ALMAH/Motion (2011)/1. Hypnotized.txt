Riot!

Gather the troops
On the top of the hills
Letâs defeat all the different thoughts
Cut all the heads
And impale all the weakest
Drink their blood for your gods

Bend âem with your greed
Enjoining the dirty laws
And perpetuate your scorn
You keep striking
And you keep fighting
You brag about your high score

Get up and win at life â youâre hypnotized

(Iâm dreaming) â youâre paralyzed
(your nightmare) â youâre held in time
(Iâm screaming) â donât go astray
(your new voice) â youâre just a slave

Aside the reality
You canât see around you
You trample your brother for glory
You cheat us, no remorse
No feelings, no regret
No limits, no face, no soul

Believe youâre a hero
In fact you are a âzeroâ
Infection of self-confidence
We live in world
Where we need to be winners
Wherever it takes, oh lord!

Get up and win at life â youâre hypnotized

(Iâm dreaming) â youâre paralyzed
(your nightmare) â youâre held in time
(Iâm screaming) â donât be astray
(your new voice) â youâre just a slave

Gather the troops
In the top of the hills
And defeat all the different thoughts
Cut all the heads
And impale the weakest
Drink their blood for your gods

(Iâm dreaming) â youâre paralyzed
(your nightmare) â youâre held in time
(Iâm screaming) â donât be astray
(your new voice) â youâre just a slave
