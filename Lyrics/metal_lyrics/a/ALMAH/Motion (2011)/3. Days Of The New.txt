Feeling
What you want to
New sensation, new vibration
You canât refuse!

Feeling
Iâve left old days
Breathe this new air
Keep the spirit lighting your ways!

Go ahead, donât let your dreams all behind
Kick all the fears and the threats you will find
Cast out your ghosts
Let the sun come in and shine

Days of the new â (youâre retrieving)
All the good news â (youâre restoring)
All your life â (youâre returning)
To âthe youâ â (on your own)
I welcome my bloom â (Iâm retrieving)
All the good news â (Iâm restoring)
All my life â (and Iâm heaving)
Over you â (all the scorn)

Screaming
Your demons unleashed
This is my life, no one is taking it from me

Coming up stairs, going beyond the skies
Youâll feel the freedom just tearing the scars
Let it all out
Let the sun come in and shine

Days of the new â (youâre retrieving)
All the good news â (youâre restoring)
All your life â (youâre returning)
To âthe youâ â (on your own)
I welcome my bloom â (Iâm retrieving)
All the good news â (Iâm restoring)
All my life â (and Iâm heaving)
Over you â (all the scorn)

If somebody someday tells you what to do
You look in his eyes and tell him the truth
âyouâre just a piece of shit, you know Iâm right!dope!â

Days of the new â (youâre retrieving)
All the good news â (youâre restoring)
All your life â (youâre returning)
To âthe youâ â (on your own)
I welcome my bloom â (Iâm retrieving)
All the good news â (Iâm restoring)
All my life â (and Iâm heaving)
Over you â (all the scorn)
