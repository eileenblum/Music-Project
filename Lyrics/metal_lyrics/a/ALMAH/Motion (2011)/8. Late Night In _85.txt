It's cold out here
Silence screams inside my head
The sound of trees
Fills my ears with memories

Chapters of life
Lost in the stars
Late night in '85
My childhood then slept forever

And I bleed for unreal wounds
And I bleed for unreal wounds

You know I'm here
You know I'm still your biggest friend
You know my fears
And all my goals along the way

Chapters of life
Lost in the stars
Late night in '85
My childhood then slept forever

And I bleed for unreal wounds
And I bleed for unreal wounds
And I still run away
From myself everyday
And I bleed for unreal wounds

You lived by my side
Long enough to be loving you
You taught me to be who I am
Suddenly as rain
You came and went away

And I bleed for unreal wounds
And I bleed for unreal wounds
And I still run away
From myself everyday
And I bleed for unreal wounds
