How can we live with this
Power and misery
Do they fight
Or order to fight for them?

Somebody dies in vain
'Cause somebody seeds the fear
What do you see?
A future in a dead end street

There's a reason to restrict
Bounds and freedom: you get strong!
Mask your faith behind guns
Zombies dictator

Their people eat rotten bread
While their destructive souls
Make a toast
For the death industry

There's a reason to restrict
Bounds and freedom: you get strong!
Mask your faith behind guns
Zombies dictator
There's a reason to resist
The imposition of terror!
All the people born free
Zombies dictator

Die

You lead the hades through the hill of no hope
You foresee all disgrace of the west

Die

Wield guns and aim your head
And adorn the desert with your blood
Save us now
And burn in hell with your mob

There's a reason to restrict
Bounds and freedom: you get strong!
Mask your faith behind guns
Zombies dictator
There's a reason to resist
The imposition of terror!
All the people born free
Zombies dictator

Die
