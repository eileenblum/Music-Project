Life in motion, modified
Draining thoughts from mechanized minds
Cultivate the inner void
Empty image crafted in frozen time

Taken chances put away
Declamations of obsessive aim
Shameless, cold naivety
Becomes the agenda

In a glimpse, everything new
Out of nothing, you see the light
Random patterns, now taking shape
Incarnations of what you create

Welcome to the realm of dreams
Nothing's really what it seems to be
No one tells you what to do
Limitations you will never know

Fill the canvas with your wish
Let your hand be guided by the darn
Just a foolish vision now
Changes all forever

In a glimpse, everything new
Out of nothing, you see the light
Random patterns, now taking shape
Incarnations of what you create

Daydream lucidity
It's deep inside the visions you awake
Beyond reality
You'll find the answers to your troubled days

Daydream lucidity
