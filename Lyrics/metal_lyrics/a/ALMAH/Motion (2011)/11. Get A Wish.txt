[Bonus Track]Dream and spread your dreams to someone else
You get the wings to fly
Higher and higher then you dive deep inside of you
Freeze all your black thoughts and blow them up
In thousand of pieces and
Get in the rain, let the body get blessed
Slip through the wind, running so fast
You are the miracle, wish all you can wish in your life
Until the last chances, chances for your victories!
Gotta go! Gotta go! Gotta get to the top
Get a wish, get a wish, get a wish to you
Always you have freedom keep on moving!
Gotta go! Gotta go! Gotta get to the wish!
Get a will, get a will, get a will to you
Always your own dreams will keep on moving!
See! Your hope is rising from the flood
In a thousand forms of dreams
Get in the rain, let the body get blessed
Slip through the wind, running so fast
You are the miracle, wish all you can wish in your life
Until the last chances, chances for your victories!
Gotta go! Gotta go! Gotta get to the top
Get a wish, get a wish, get a wish to you
Always you have freedom keep on moving!
Gotta go! Gotta go! Gotta get to the wish!
Get a will, get a will, get a will to you
Always your own dreams will keep on moving!
