Dive into your deepest pain
Changing everything you are
Don't let yourself go
Don't fall, don't flow with

Spin into your hurricanes
Your last chance has just arrived
Don't let yourself go
No pain, no gain
Let yourself grow

Promise me you won't fade away
Nothing is over, now is your time
Don't let yourself go
You fight, don't choke
And rise again

And you revive
And live another day
You're free so try
To get another chance
The old is over
And the new has come to stay
Now set your soul alight

And you revive
And live another day
You're free so try
To get another chance
The old is over
And the new has come to stay
Now set your soul alight

Look out!
