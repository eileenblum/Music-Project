Every possible away
Every possible time
Everything takes place at once somewhere
All we dream and hope
Promises and lies
All that we can think of, all that we cannot devise
Adrift in reality that flows from our feelings.

My mind turns and turns, still I canât let go

Take a step into the river
Let its waters flow inside you
Wash away, cut away
The branches that pierce your soul
Living and drifting

Inner self in silence
Stars on the horizon
Shining like a mantle made of light
All that we reject
All that we neglect
Lie in such a place where we wonât be able to get back
Behold the equality that goes while were dreaming

My mind turns and turns, still I canât let go

Take a step into the river
Let its waters flow inside you
Wash away, cut away
The branches that pierce your soul
Living and drifting

River flowing backwards
Bringing past illusions
Carrying the waters we once swan
Will you close your eyes?
Will you lock your hearth?
Will you have the courage to look within the worst of you?
What is done, is done, you better believe it.

My mind turns and turns, still I canât let go

Take a step into the river
Let its waters flow inside you
Wash away, cut away
The branches that pierce your soul
Living and drifting
