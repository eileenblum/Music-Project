Days are flowing in silence
As a whisper cries in the wind
Sacred notes will find the gates

Days are clear and it's shinning
As a river sowing the field
Walking by the unknown
You can reach the distant lands

Cross the fire, raise the still
Where the freedom is dying again

You leave yours fears all behind
"Until your tears can be gone"
Face your own wishes and let your spirit go
To the sacred land of meaningless world

Hear the cries of the black wolf
Find the keys there over the hills
Mountains hide the north ways
But reveals a beautiful land

Fire!
Go!
