[Music / Lyrics: Edu Falaschi]

A decision can change all your ways
Your belief gives you strength to retrieve
In your fears you can dive
All the tears you can dry
Just depend on you to carry on

There's a magic flame hidden inside
There's a golden bell wishing to chime

Somewhere - places to go
Signs and meanings that flow
Grab your chances and just carry on

Oh! You'll live forever
If you bring your spirit together
With you into the world you belong
Then your dreams can live again

Someone told you the feelings you hide
Are the mirror that reflex your pride

Somewhere - places to go
Signs and meanings that flow
Grab your chances and just carry on

Oh! You'll live forever
If you bring your spirit together
With you into the world you belong
Then your dreams can live again

Go!
Look out!

Go! Go! Find your freedom
Go! Go! Going forward

Oh!
Screams in your mind say to go
Oh!
Step by step you light your soul
