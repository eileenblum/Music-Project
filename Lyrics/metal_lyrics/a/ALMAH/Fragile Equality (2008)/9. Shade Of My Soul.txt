[Music / Lyrics: Edu Falaschi]

Listen - To the sound of quiet
Whispers - Fade on the horizon
Living - Through the light and shadow
Waiting - For the night to take the sky

I knew all the way
It would tumble
Over
And still
Once again

I will take it
All these tears and face the
Morning
Waiting for the light to shine on

Here I stand
As long as the sun lights
The unknown
The shade of my soul
Still remains

Racing through the void still
Dreaming - I can feel the world now
Staying - In this maze of frozen
Faces - Staring at the endless night and

Here I stand
As long as the sun lights
The unknown
The shade of my soul
Here I stand
As long as the sun lights
The unknown
The shade of my soul

Standing here under a pale sunrise
The whole universe seems so blue
Wasting my time trying to realize
What keeps me away from the new?

Oh!
