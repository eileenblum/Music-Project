[Music / Lyrics: Edu Falaschi / Felipe Andreoli]

Just like dark and light
End and start of day
Balance is in sight
Free from our mistakes

Inceptions of a war
Is the human way
Ignorance is the door
To the end of days

Did we learn a thing?
From our sorry past
They keep on pulling strings
And we keep falling fast

Can they read my mind?
Witness my distress
Coming from the fight
Of feelings i repress

It's time to leave it all behind
And try to make you just understand
When we are bound to watch and cry
A fragile equality can be dead

Freedom for the few
Rights that do not dare
Nothing here is new
We don't seem to care

I will watch you fall
For it has been done to me
As long as I recall
Blood I see in gray

Just try to leave the past behind
And take your own fate under command
It's time to leave it all behind
And try to make you just understand
When we are bound to watch and cry
A fragile equality can be dead
