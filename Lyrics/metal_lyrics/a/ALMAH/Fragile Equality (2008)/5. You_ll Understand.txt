Beyond the boundaries known by man
The lies a truth no one could stand
Becoming one with those you hate
Will make you humble to this land

You wanna master the world
You wanna master your hate
You hate is mastering you

A shadow crosses through your heart
As though as you were never there
You feel so small and you would scream
But all you do is stop and stare

You wanna master the world
You wanna master your hate
You hate is mastering you
Burning Fire

You'll understand - all this domain
Is something you - will never tame
Through all the slow - incessant pain
That then made you - what you became
Just face your own terror and rise up again

You fight the void beneath the sky
You make up foes you fight against
No matter what, no matter how
The battle rages in yourself

You wanna master the world
You wanna master your hate
You hate is mastering you
Burning Fire

You'll understand - all this domain
Is something you - will never tame
Through all the slow - incessant pain
That then made you - what you became

You'll understand - that in this world
Or own mistakes - we see as our foes
Through all the slow - incessant pain
That then made you - the monster to slay

Just face your own terror and rise up again
