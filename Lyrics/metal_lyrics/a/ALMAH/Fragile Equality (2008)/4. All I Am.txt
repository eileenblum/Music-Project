[Music / Lyrics: Felipe Andreoli]

Through your eyes
A world unveiled
Feels so cold without you
Seems like life's
An ever growing stream
Of regrets

Moments lost
As tears in rain
Silent portions of me
Fading sight of vain lucidity
Nothing gained

Leaving this side
I'll move on for now
And I don't know how
But if I'm gone tomorrow
Don't cry
All the things I am
They will ever be in your memories

All that time
I've lost in fear
Couldn't stand so much truth
Never knew
Where was the end of me?
The start of you

Leaving this side
I'll move on for now
And I don't know how
But if I'm gone tomorrow
Don't cry
All the things I am
They will ever be in your memories
You cannot hide

And I'll move on for now
I just don't know how
But perhaps I'm gone tomorrow

And I'll move on for now

I just don't know how
But perhaps I'm gone tomorrow
So I don't know how
I will ever be
In your heart
Into your heart
