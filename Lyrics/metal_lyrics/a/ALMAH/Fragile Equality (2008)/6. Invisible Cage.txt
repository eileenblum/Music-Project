Find out the intentions
Behind eyes temptations
Who gets the keys to the stars?

You try all the reasons
To find all solutions
But you cannot seem to describe

How cold is it inside your heart?
"Inside your heart"
An empty field to remind
Like Jesus you feel piercing thorns in your face

Run to reach your finest days
Bad memories fade
You take the pain away
Invisible cage

Cry out your sensations
The true revelations
You're lost in the middle of time

You feel scars still linger
You flow like a sinner
Snake searching victims at night

How cold is it inside your heart?
"Inside your heart"
An empty field to remind
Like Jesus you feel piercing thorns in your face

Run to reach your finest days
Bad memories fade
You take the pain away
Invisible cage

You have been searching yourself for so long!

Run to reach your finest days
Bad memories fade
You take the pain away
Invisible cage

Run to reach your finest days
Bad memories fade
You take the pain away
Invisible cage

Invisible Cage
