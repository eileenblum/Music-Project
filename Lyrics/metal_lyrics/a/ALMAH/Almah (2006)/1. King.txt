[Lyrics By Edu Falaschi]

Drowned by the fury
Of the evolution times
You lose all
Lose your reputation for the glory
Controlled by the force of alienation you say...

I'm the king
I'm the king
From my own war
I get the pain

Live to be the best, oh!
Best of what?
You don't realize but you are lost
You are nothing but a puppet
And the greed will burn you first
You can say...

I'm the king
I'm the king
Your self-control has disappeared

When you build around yourself
Golden walls it seems like your shell
But watch your acts
be prepared when
Fall your mask

You're the one
You're the myth
You are the ocean
You shape shift
And for the thirst
For the pain
When all is over
Wound by wound
Trick by trick
You'll see
You'll pay
For all the darkness living in your soul
For all the freedom you have been stolen
From my mind you feed your lamb
With my growth
This way you can say

I'm the king
I'm the king
From my own war
I get the pain
When you build around yourself
Golden walls it seems like your shell
But watch your acts
be prepared when
Fall your mask

You're the one
You're the myth
You are the ocean
You shape shift
And for the thirst
For the pain
When all is over
Wound by wound
Trick by trick
You'll see
You'll pay

So said the bishop

"Once
I was not insane
I could dream away
And I crossed the sky"

Don't
Be a shallow man
Give another chance
To increase your life

"Now
I can't see my deep inside
Tell me who I am
I can't pay this price"

I'm the king
I'm the king
On my own I live my misery

When you build around yourself
Golden walls it seems like your shell
But watch your acts
be prepared when
Fall your mask

You're the one
You're the myth
You are the ocean
You shape shift
And for the thirst
For the pain
When all is over
Wound by wound
Trick by trick
You'll see
You'll pay
You'll see
You'll pay

Forget your prayer.
