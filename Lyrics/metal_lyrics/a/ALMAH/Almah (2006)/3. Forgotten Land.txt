[Lyrics By Edu Falaschi]

Sometimes the morning seems dark as the unknown
Night seems without ending as a road
To the forgotten land

[Solo]

Thousands years and thousand dreams are gone
Hidden within tears they're still alone
Drifting in the endless sea those souls beg for the death
Just waiting for the arrival of the sails of Charon
To the forgotten land

Someplace where there's no time to lose
Some world where lies are more than truth
An empty space inside your heart
Someplace where hope is obscure

Misery...
Shallow lives and  haunt 'em as a ghost
It feeds the greed that drinks right from the source
And enriches the stronger one

[Solo]

Hungry eyes arrested numb souls
Floating in the skies they cross the rainbow
To the forgotten land

Someplace where there's no time to lose
Some world where lies are more than truth
An empty space inside your heart
Someplace where hope is obscure
Obscure
