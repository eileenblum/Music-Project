[Lyrics By Edu Falaschi]

Time running fast it rides the wind
That slowly touches your skin
Find your missing piece
While precious minutes are flying free
Like the quiet winter's leaves
Like the space sleeps and dreams
On the sun...
Miles away

So you feel
Passing by
Something as real
As the rise of the primitive chaos

World's beginning
Ero's arrow hits your heart
You don't see the scars
You became divine
Hell where the fire burns the creed
Blesses your purest feeling
Like the wild flames that sing
On the sun...
Miles away

So you feel
Passing by
Something as real
As the rise of the primitive chaos

You're the sun of the night
You're the spark thats sets on fire
You're the shield of my life
You're my shining star
