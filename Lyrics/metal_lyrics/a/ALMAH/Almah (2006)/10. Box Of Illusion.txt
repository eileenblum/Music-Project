[Lyrics By Edu Falaschi]

Our reason hides a thousand ways
Sometimes clear, sometimes dark
Our emotion is like an endless tale
Sometimes is real, sometimes is not

Hold on!
Your inner trip has just begun
Go on!
Don't let this journey slip away
Start over!

When our soul is kept inside a box of illusion
All of your fortune then depends on your own attitude, yeah!
You always knew that all your knowledge was asleep
So it rolls on
All days

Even a secret mind can leave a trace
Even you can hide a crime
When you're trapped and there is no way out
Let your spirit find the light

Hold on!
Your inner trip has just begun
Go on!
Don't let this journey slip away
Start over!

When our soul is kept inside a box of illusion
All of your fortune then depends on your own attitude, yeah!
You always knew that all your knowledge was asleep
So it rolls on
All days

[Solo]

Hold on!
Your inner trip has just begun
Go on!
Don't let this journey slip away
Start over!

When our soul is kept inside a box of illusion
All of your fortune then depends on your own attitude, yeah!
You always knew that all your knowledge was asleep
So it rolls on
All days
