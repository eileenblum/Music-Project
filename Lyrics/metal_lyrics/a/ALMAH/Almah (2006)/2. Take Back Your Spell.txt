[Lyrics By Edu Falaschi]

You all desire your rise on death
You are forgetting to regret
Don't wonder why you're creeping instead
Of you flying over everywhere

I'll be on time
I'll be ahead
Don't spend your strength
My fire is drowning all your threat

Beyond the lies
And free of your chains
I live and I ride on my pride to the edge
Of reason and I'm above all the evil that lives in your head
So take back your spell!

Oh! Thousands eyes watch over your steps
Wherever you go, I will be there
You feed your heart with envy and hate
I get stronger through all of your mistakes

I'll be on time
I'll be ahead
Don't spend your strength
My fire is drowning all your threat

Beyond the lies
And free of your chains
I live and I ride on my pride to the edge
Of reason and I'm above all the evil that lives in your head
So take back your spell!

[Solo]

Beyond the lies
And free of your chains
I live and I ride on my pride to the edge
Of reason and I'm above all the evil that lives in your head
You're lost in the valley of the death
I'll triumph forever
