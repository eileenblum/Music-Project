[Lyrics By Edu Falaschi]

Born a child
King of the kings
He's the heir of his father's death

New empire
New domain
Surrounded by the greed and rage

The skies greet the jewel of death
The legend arises to reign

"Crucify enemies
Burn and kill who threat my breed"
Treason and lie stole his dreams
Now the curse is alive in freedom

The skies greet the jewel of death
The legend arises to reign again

We are the children of lies
We are the children of lies

Children of lies
Children of lies
Lies
