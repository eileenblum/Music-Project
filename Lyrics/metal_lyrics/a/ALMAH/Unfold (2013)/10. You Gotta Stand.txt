It took me so long to realize
That I'm away from old days
I shed a tear or two in life
It doesn't make me a weaker

Yeah

I remember all thing I've done
Some were good and some were not that bad
I made friends and sorehead through this life
But I just keep the good feelings instead

You gotta walk on and fly
You gotta walk on and dare
You gotta walk on and cry
You gotta walk on and stand

You gotta stand

Would you pull the trigger if you were
Standin'in my shoes, you're not a man
Behind the scene you're just another one
Dare for your own life
Get outta my way

You gotta walk on and fly
You gotta walk on and dare
You gotta walk on and cry
You gotta walk on and stand

Ain't going to wastel! Got no more to say
Oh no
Now I'm back on the road, running through the night

You gotta walk on and fly
You gotta walk on and dare
You gotta walk on and cry
You gotta walk on and stand

You gotta stand
