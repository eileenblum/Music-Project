Who's your suspicious?
What's your distress?
What's your conviction for your regrets?

Soon will come the eruption
Soon will come the end
Brave will be the heartless
Weak will be the men

Don't trust propaganda
You just believe in your heart
Don't trust what you see

You must believe what you descry
(They give us alms for their lies)
You must distrust before you adhere
(They build a temple through your fears)
You get to keep away from light
(This light is not what you describe)
You buy a pig but get a poke

Cannibals in suits
Conspire with their scum
Erase the trace of roots
And raise the devils' son

Fear stops creation
You do not steel
A wolf in sheep's clothing
Feed the hunger of the leech

Don't trust propaganda
You just believe in your heart
Don't trust what you see

You must believe what you descry
(They give us alms for their lies)
You must distrust before you adhere
(They build a temple through your fears)
You get to keep away from light
(This light is not what you describe)
You buy a pig but get a poke

There's only lies
