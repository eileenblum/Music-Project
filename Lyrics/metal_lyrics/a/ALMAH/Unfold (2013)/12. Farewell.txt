A lonely place to go
An empty space of soul
A breeze that wispers words
to my heart

I see the lights go down
The echos in the hall
But life is just like this
Right now

I'll carry on living without your love
Thanks for all the things that you have done
You always will be here inside my world

With memories I walk on, drift along
Our history just has begun
