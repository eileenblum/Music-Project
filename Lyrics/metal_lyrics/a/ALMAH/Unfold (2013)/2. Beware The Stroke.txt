In my time
I will know
What's the way
I should go

There's a light
Shining through
In the space
In the blue

All my life
I'll remember
That the strength is
In my blood

Right time, right place, fate
We'll never know

Bright night dark day
Life is toil
It's all a blow

That brings you to life
It brings you to the row
Keen eyes,green light
Aim high and shoot low

You live and learn
Beware the stroke
Lifetime! It's not a chance
Write now your ways

Take off the blindfold
See where you can go
Dodge the punch
Get free to rock and roll
Life is na open field with golden ways
For those about to love
You're in the game

Wrong time, wrong place
Mischance, what a choke

Tough time, black sky
Always give you force

To bring you to life
It gets you into the row
Keen eyes,green light
Shoot high, aim low
You live and learn
Beware the stroke

Liftime it's not a chance
Write now your ways

Take off the blindfold
See where you can go
Dodge the punch
Get free to rock and roll
Life is na open field, with golden ways
For those about to love
You're in the game
