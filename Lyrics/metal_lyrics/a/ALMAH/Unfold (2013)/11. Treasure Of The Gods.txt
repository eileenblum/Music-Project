I can move away
just to make you understand
you are in an ocean
full of cruel lies and people want to make you stay away from here

There's a moonlight, and winds and a lonely way
I can't dream anymore
There's a room with a window to nowhere
I'm no way out there

Uh! What a hard time
I hear only voices away
Uh! I've got a real life
I need to be free again

I can move and
I can see for the first time
All the things I let the fear steal from me
Now I'm free to breathe again, I'm not afraid
I caught the spirit I've got the chance to fly high

Always, someday
You never knew
You'll never find
All days, Today
You get the keys to open minds

Your flame will burn eternally, you know, for all remaining years
The sky is now your playground
Home is now the sun
Your dreams are now your destiny
And fortune comes from your beliefs
Ablaze and in full flight
Today has just begun

Eternal
Return from death

And on the ashes of this nest
You raise the soul and bring it back
Love wove with deathly fire
Justice has been done

You fly over the seas of grief
And find again all your relief
From heaven hear the bell's chime
Annunciations come

Eternal, immortal
Return from death

Spread your wings and take flight over the hills
Greet the gleam of sun's fire
Gloriuos anew!
Your renewal may start inside yourself
Get the new light and shine
Beaultiful realm
From now on

You're soaring up into the sun
Dreams you can reach with all your might
Forever bird of fire
Leave behind the pyre
Within the last eleven lines
Your victories will get the prize
Unfold your legendary
Treasure of the gods

Eternal, immortal
Return from death

Spread your wings and take flight over the hills
Greet the gleam of sun's fire
Gloriuos anew!
Your renewal may start inside yourself
Get the new light and shine
Beaultiful realm
From now on
