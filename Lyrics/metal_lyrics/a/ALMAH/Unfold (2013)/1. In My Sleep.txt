Down
You let me down
You will take nobody down again

Endless lives
Creeping lives
Infectious souls don't put me out of the game

Tear us apart and let's see who will rise again

Loud
Cry out loud
Scream and shout to give you one more chance

Now you fight
You'll arise
Use this chance to learn and to be heard

Tear us apart and let's see who will rise again
Hide from the mirror 'cause you know we are all to blame

Face
Night and day
As one minute, there's no tomorrow

In my sleep
I awake
And I wish I could see there's no sorrow anymore

Fight
For your life
Set you free from the opression's nails

Live your life
Leave or die
Get the spirit of the freedom ways

Tear us apart and let's see who will rise again
Hide from the mirror 'cause you know we are all to blame

Face
Night and day
As one minute, there's no tomorrow

In my sleep
I awake
And I wish I could see there's no sorrow anymore

Down
You let me down
You will take nobody down again

Endless lives
Creeping lives
Infectious souls don't put me out of the game

Tear us apart and let's see who will rise again
Hide from the mirror 'cause you know we are all to blame

Face
Night and day
As one minute, there's no tomorrow

In my sleep
I awake
And I wish I could see there's no sorrow anymore
