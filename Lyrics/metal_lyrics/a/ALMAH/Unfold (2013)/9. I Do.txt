Start demanding
All you would like to transform
Start creating
All you want to feel

Mind accomplishes
Find a away to materialize
Stop degrading
All you can't achieve

Don't forget! Don't live
Without your soul
See behind the scenes

You can go
Further over the dreams
If you want it
Do you belong
To a wonderful world?
I do

Grab the chances
Bring the days out of the storm
After turbulence
Comes the time of peace

Dive deeply
Where you cannot see the light
There's the secret
Of eternal life

Don't forget! Don't live
Without your soul
See behind the scenes
Beyond the dreams you cannot see

You can go
Further over the dreams
If you want it
Do you belong
To a wonderful world?
I do
