One mind leading
New times written
You're not alone
We're on the way

Cry for
Wings of Revolution
It's all around
Give it away

Oh
A new beginning is on the way

Young blood
Old lies
Disillusions
Hold on! We're on the way

Rise up inside
Keep the new light
Turned on
Give it away

Oh
A new beginning is on the way

Follow through
Don't give up
Take your chance
Make a stand

Go

They will try to put us down but
There's a chance to turn things around
Let's take our confidence back
Never been a time like right now

Honor, freedom, justice, future
It's all about what we deserve

Oh
A new beginning is on the way
Face the sun of a new day
