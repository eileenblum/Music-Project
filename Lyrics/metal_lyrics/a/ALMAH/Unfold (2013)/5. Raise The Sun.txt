Driving through
A lonely road
I put my mind in a frozen numb mode

A hundred miles
I have to go
Sweetest moment
Leave me on my own

All I feel is true
A thousand miles of freedom running through
All I see is the way
To keep me astray and far away from you

When the night just turns to day
Gather all your sins and run away
Cause you ride so fast to hell
When your fears arrest you as a cell

All I feel is true
A thousand miles of freedom running through
All I see is the way
To keep me astray and far away from you

Now I'm free
So I will let you go
End of winter
Raise the sun
Close the windows
Lock the door
Take the freeway
To the stars

All I feel is true
A thousand miles of freedom running through
All I see is the way
To keep me astray and far away from you

It's all an another night, it's all you in another night
