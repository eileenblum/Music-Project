Times of the new domination
What is truth or lie?
The power seeds the alienation
Or is it just our mind?

Hidden message of degrading
Keep the nations blind
Consumers good just bring frustration
(But) it makes you feel alive

You own your soul and mind
You're free to touch the skies
You'll know when you fell inside
What's the meaning for your life

Believer
Chase the evil with the power of your mind
Believer
They are trying at all costs to keep you aside
All alone

Shadowns of the egyptian ages
Shadows of today
Neglect all the information
Keep the dreams away

They destract you into oblivion
Heading to control
Eye of horus
Feed the system
And take the food of soul

You own your soul and mind
You're free to touch the skies
You 'll know when you feel inside
What's the meaning for your life

Believer
Chase the evil with the power of your mind
Believer
They are trying at all costs to keep you aside
All alone

Yeah

You'll know when you feel iside
What's the meaning for your life

Believer
Chase the evil with the power of your mind
Believer
They are trying at all costs to keep you aside
All alone!
