All the sweetest words I can say
Are not enough to describe you
So I say

All I feel is peace, calm and grace
When you are here just by my side
And I pray

For you life, for your dreams, for your soul
You're indeed
My purest beautiful love

Warm wind
Fills my heart with love
I wish you all the best you can get
So live your life as a lovely dawn
Bright and lighting the stars

I've been waiting for someone like you
But I didn't think I'd have such a gift
Dreams come, dreams go and you're always here
'Cause you're real and part of me
So I pray

For you life, for your dreams, for your soul
You're indeed
My purest beautiful love

Warm wind
Fills my heart with love
I wish you all the best you can get
So live your life as a lovely dawn
Bright and lighting the stars

All we live together will always be forever
You do believe, you've got a friend
I know you'll live some hard moments, it's life
But never alone

Warm wind
Fills my heart with love
I wish you all the best you can get
So live your life as a lovely dawn
Bright and lightning the stars
Shining right through my heart
You're my beautiful love
