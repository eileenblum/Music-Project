There is only person who could save humanity from Artides
Knowing that he will return in just a few couple of days

Down in a cellar beneath a great castle a secret laboratory is hidden since 200 years
Where generations of alchemists where hidden and prepare to stop the return of Artides

The list of ingredients is somehow special but effective
According to the holy white stone of rapture and decay

Gathered when there is no moon to see surrounded by skulls of bonobos
On a field full of mature rye covered in candy floss and lanterns of a frog fish

Prevent the return of Artides

Blood
Pus
Cyanide
Medulla

Combined with the already called necessaries and thrown into a pit of living cows who are threatened by bees, mosquito and sheep, blinded by scarfs made out of silk

Generations of alchemists had to wait to make it possible
To fulfill the requirements of what is needed to prevent the return of Artides

Prevent the return of Artides
