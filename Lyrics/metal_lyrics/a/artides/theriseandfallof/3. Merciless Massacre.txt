That fucking child ruined everything
(stopped my resurrection)
The mind of my new host bursted
(into uncountable parts)

Each part stands for one archetype
Each of them needs to be ceased to exist
Violence will not help me in here
Words need to cause the merciless massacre

Pedophile, choleric, murderer, faithful, racist, cock
(my mind is whirling),
Chauvinist, feminist, normal guy, slave trader, antrophosop, flat-earther
(this body is my end)

Each personality stands for one archetype
Each of them needs to be ceased to exist
Violence will not help me in here
Words need to cause the merciless massacre

When I finally was disgusted by so many human stereotypes
(and lost the fight)
Tartaros was executed by the alchemists and released me
(from this sick hell )

Each personality stood for one archetype
Each of them needed to be ceased to exist
Violence would not help me in here
And words could not cause the merciless massacre

Only a bunch of frightened cows could stop
The growing lunacy inside my mind
Not knowing where the journey would take me now
But everything is better than staying in here
