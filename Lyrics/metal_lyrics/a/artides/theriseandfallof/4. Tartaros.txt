Oh this irony saving poor Artides sinking into depths of nothingness
Instead of sending him in front of the throne of King Mafuba!
Bewared of filling rice cooker with demon souls in eternity
And smell the stench of the unwashed hairs of King Mafuba!

Bewared of the endless screaming of stillborn animals
Waiting to be slaughtered in the abattoir
Just to be eaten by the holy master of nothingness
King Mafuba and his 7-headed horse

One day our universe was created by an unplanned chemical reaction (like it happened later with penicillin), when the King Of Nothingness ate the eight head of his horse and triggered a Tartaros, which lead to the divine explosion.
