Completely broken by delusion
Artides suffers various nightmares
While moving back through centuries
His personality will suffer

Six pink bushes filled with clowns offering candy dragging him close
He is torn into pieces, they tear of their clothes, enjoying every part of him

Broken by delusion

His next nightmare feels endlessly
Sitting in a classroom alone with a
Teacher armed with Wolverines claw
Scratching the blackboard permanently

Sitting in an office covered with a suite calculating things without knowing why
The clock strikes 5, the clock strikes 9, the clock strikes 5, the clock strikes 9

Broken by delusion

Raped by clowns, punished by a teacher and working in an office, again and again
When Artides finally lands on the earth again he only wants to stop humanity
