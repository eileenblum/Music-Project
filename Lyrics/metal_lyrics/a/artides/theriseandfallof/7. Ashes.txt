Put under pain that he couldn't even know that it possibly exists
And thrown into a hole with colors outside every known range
Seeing his mother and father and son, but none of them exist
His parents are dead, his son yet unborn, who could be the mom?

From the ashes we will rise

Realising the hole is a gate through time he is curious where it leads
Will he meet his parents, his son his wife, how will his journey go on?
Invigorated by the possibility of, having wife and kids
He screams into the eternal unknown path in front of him

From the ashes we will rise

Rise!

Defeating those who fought us (rise)
Saving my ancestors (rise)
Recreate the family (rise)
Taking over control (rise)

From the ashes we will rise
