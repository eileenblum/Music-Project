Waking up from restless sleep, the beginning of a nightmare
Feel the crawling deep underneath my skin like somethings there

My body blotched with staring eyes and talking mouths
Whispering a name I've never heard while dribbling blood
I recognize every single eye and the screaming voices
They belong to my affairs and my unwanted children

Overwhelmed by my emotions I fall back into a deep dark void

After regaining my consciousness I stare at my chest
The head of an infant covered by my skin starts instructing me

"Cover your arms and go back to work or I kill your family
Your kind staggered your very own blood enough times
To gather the power I needed to recover
Together we will make this world a better place"

Going back to work with an infant head in my chest
As I exit the house a Child stares into my mind
