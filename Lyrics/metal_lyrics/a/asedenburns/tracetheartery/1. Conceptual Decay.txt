Disposition in no light, forgotten
Sterilize and defeat, any right to project
The overlooked, with the martyrs, strain upwards to find
Integrity lost, sanctity dead
Understood that no understanding survives
That with no one to lead, no one Is lead
way untold, towards a lack of such reprise
still, integrity's lost, sanctity's dead

still with honor we claim outright

full within all of our
thoughts, brief in all of our
claims on what we all hold
to be our significance
unto the world
to never be bought
until the meaning proves itself infinitely too much to bear

to be right, as we celebrate, the age of conceptual decay
it just doesn't fair, to hold sight, and in confidence, search for a way
moving forward, were advancing on square one and losing all ground set before
through the depths of civility, but seeing only what we spawn

to be right, as we celebrate, the age of conceptual decay
it just doesn't fair, to hold sight, and in confidence, search for a way

motive to abridge, exhibition of restraint

Disposition in no light, forgotten
Sterilize and defeat, any right to project
The overlooked, with the martyrs, strain upwards to find
Integrity lost, sanctity dead
Understood that no understanding survives
That with no one to lead, no one Is lead
way untold, towards a lack of such reprise
still, integrity's lost, sanctity's dead
