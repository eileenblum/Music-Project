The testament you pray for, is counteracting everything
The surrogate, the savior, the undertaking straight into the ground
Your dying eyes will never see your fate in front of you
Fall to arise in the unknown, fall to arise no more

on no account arrange tradition, of high morale
but guarantee your place in self assurance of complete return
a plea, arise
a hope, arise,
a light to clear the look of desperation from these eyes

a plea, for closure
a hope, to stand, to stand for anything
a right, to understand
a reason, to never, to never look away

is it really much too wide
is it that incomprehensible
are we so far too the side
that well never fine our way at all
