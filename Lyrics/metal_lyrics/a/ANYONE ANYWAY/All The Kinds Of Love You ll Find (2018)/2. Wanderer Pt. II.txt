Show me your heartbeat
I promise you, that I'm listening.
And in my head I meant what I said
But now I'm afraid that I'm losing you again
What happened to your heart beating against only mine?
Now I'm alone,
How could I have jeopardized our time?
What are your fears? I'll tell you mine
I think I made you too important in my mind
And now I'm afraid that I'll never see you again in this lifetime
Now I'm drawing a blank,
I'm making a scene
How could I have not been listening?
I'm sorry. I mean it.
I have no breath at all
I can barely speak the words
Your heartbeat deserves
So I'll wander on
I just couldn't find the words
I'm sorry I wasn't careful
Everyone makes mistakes
This was an easy one to make
