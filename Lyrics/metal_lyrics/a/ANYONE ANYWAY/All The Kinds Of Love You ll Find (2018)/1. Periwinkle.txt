I heard your footsteps to the door
Your walk was all I had to know
I forgot how patiently you wait for me
And how long I made you wait
So do I stay here, or am I lost?
Is there something better where I'm not?
Am I prisoner to myself?
Or am I chained down by something else?
And can you really ever tell
Your smile is all I want to see
But I know behind the door there is nothing
If I could tell you what you asked me
I'd say I miss you, so does Sunny
And I pray please take the pain away
So do I stay here, or am I lost?
Is there something better where I'm not?
Am I an outcast, without a home?
We were never meant to be on our own
A time to grieve, a time to smile
Well I was angry for a while
But now I pray, please take the pain away
So do I stay here, or am I lost?
Is there something better where I'm not?
Am I a prisoner left to wander all alone?
We were never meant to be on our own?
We've all got death in our bones
