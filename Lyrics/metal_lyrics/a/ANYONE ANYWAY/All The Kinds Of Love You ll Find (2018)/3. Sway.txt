Will you always be a part of me?

Keep on knocking 'til the end
Well, have I lost all hope and motivation?
Let me out of this sinking feeling
That I'll never understand your plans

Sway, did I sway
When they carried you away?
Will you always be,
Be a part of me?
Stay, you couldn't stay
And now this fear is crippling
There's no way this door is opening
But for now I guess I'll just keep knocking

And the crunch of the snow under my feet
Makes me, for a moment, feel at peace
Let this silence be a moment pointing
To what I need to see, please show me
Is it you, is it me?
Is it what I want?
Is it what I need?
Sway did I sway
When you were taken away from me?
Now your smile is just a distant memory
Change, things had to change
I wish that they had stayed to say
The door will open
So just keep knocking
Let me out let me live again I hate this world that we're living in
Let me out of this sinking feeling
That I'll never understand your plans
I'll never understand the plans you've made, but for now I guess I'll just keep knocking
