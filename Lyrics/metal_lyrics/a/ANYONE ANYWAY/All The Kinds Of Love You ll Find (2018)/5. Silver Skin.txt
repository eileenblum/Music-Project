So away with the gray
And all the thoughts that make me think
Unloved I live and I'll die
Without having better used my time
Not what I thought, not what I planned
But you've given me silver skin
To find my way back to you again
I know you're waiting
Taking in what you told me
Suffering gives way to joy
I'm sorry I believed the lies
But if it were otherwise
I might not know your name

So I learn of the grace
That I'm given every day
Why are you downcast
Please stay steadfast
Even in the darkest things
But my heart breaks away
Like waters held in place
Once the barriers removed
That sinking feeling floods my chest
But it's nothing new
Straining to see what might be ahead
Finding myself at crossroads again
I walk with you to see the grave, still you wait
In my suffering, you gave me grace

Taking in what you told me
Suffering gives way to joy
I'm sorry I believed the lies
But if it were otherwise
I might not know your name

A time is coming
It might be here now
You'll find yourself broken
You're not alone
You're not without
Broken, lost
Now I know I'm not a lost 'cause
Though I wander to the grave,
You're my hope through the pain
Still working
Still moving
Still scared
Still care
Take my heart
Take my life, overcome
Not without you
