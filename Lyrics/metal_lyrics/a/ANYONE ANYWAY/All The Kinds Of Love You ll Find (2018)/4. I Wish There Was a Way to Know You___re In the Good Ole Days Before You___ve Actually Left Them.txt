The scent of a moment that I have come to adore
Leaves as fast as came it won't surround me anymore
But from time the time while we're caught up in our lives
That pine embodies those moments it might have been OK to die
And I'm fine
It's all sublime
This is nothing new
But is it just a waste of time
And where else can you find hope
When all we have are memories and I'm afraid to let mine go
Free my soul
And keep it free from the world
The hardest part of moving on is
Waiting on what will happen next
What will I do, if the rest of my moments
Don't amount to what I want them to
On the other side the grass or was greener in my mind
Well it looks so easy but really all it makes is misery so I will let go
It is so
Clear to me my memories
Are not the hope I want to find
Where else can you find hope
When all we have are memories and we can't let go
'Cause we're afraid
'Cause we're alone
Lost to ourselves and to the world
The hardest part of moving on is letting go
I have learned to let it go
