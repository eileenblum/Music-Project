I was at the hospital laughing at cripples
Then I heard your kid just died
Suddenly, that was funnier than the cripples
So I tracked you down and made fun of you

[Chorus:]
Your kid died, and you cried
And I thought it was funny
[x2]

It was an open casket wake
I spilled my beer in your kidâs coffin
Your mascara ran because you were crying
So I kicked your husband in the balls

[Chorus]
