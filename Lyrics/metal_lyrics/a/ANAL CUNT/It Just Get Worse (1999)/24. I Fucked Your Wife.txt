Your wife was so fucking bored with you
I was in Boston for a court date and she fucked me
I threw an ashtray through a Chinese restaurantâs window
I met her at an Upsidedown Cross show

[Chorus:]
I fucked your wife
I fucked your wife â I bent her over
I fucked your wife
I fucked your wife â your marriage is over

Larry Lifeless was buying her drinks
I told her how I used to be a crack head
Next thing I knew, she was jerking me off
Youâre jealous because your band went nowhere

[Chorus]
