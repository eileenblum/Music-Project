A few years ago, I snuck Freddy Mercury into your sonâs room
I gave him anesthesia so heâd never remember getting raped
You spent your life savings putting your kid through college
Then he died of AIDS, so you wasted your money for nothing

[Chorus:]
I made your kid get AIDS, so you could watch it die
I made your kid get AIDS, so I could watch you cry

You thought your son was on a diet, so you didnât worry too much
At the funeral, I told you what happened and laughed at you
I didnât think that you suffered enough
So I shot your wife in front of you

[Chorus]

Braces, summer camp, college, you wasted all your money
Food, clothing, trips to Disney World, you wasted all your money
Birthdays, Christmas, the tooth fairy, you wasted all your money
Lunch money, field trips, toys, you wasted all your money
