I thought you were a fat chick
Then I realized you were pregnant
I thought it would be funny if your baby died
So I kicked you in the stomach

[Chorus:]
I kicked you, your babyâs dead [x3]
Ha ha ha, your babyâs dead

There were no stairs to throw you down
There was no roof to throw you off
There were no coat hangers around
So I kicked you in the stomach

[Chorus]
