[Chorus:]
Hitler was a sensitive man [x4]

He went to art school when he was younger
He wanted to be a painter
Hitler was a vegetarian
He was also a non-smoker

[Chorus]

He hired gay and handicapped officers
He was concerned about overpopulation
If Hitler were alive today
Heâd listen to The Cure, The Smiths, and Depeche Mode

[Chorus]
