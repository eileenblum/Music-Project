Jim Howell beat his wife so his brother-in-law fired him
We were trying to think of ways we could help him out
I saw you wearing a 311 shirt and reading French poetry
To your lesbian lover who was wearing a beret

[Chorus:]
I paid Jim Howell to rape you [x4]

First we gave him a fifth of Old Crow and some Schlitz
We told him youâd probably be at the Random Road Mother show
While you were talking to Joe Bonni about clove cigarettes
He yanked you away and fucked you up the ass

[Chorus]

RAPED, RAPED, RAPED, you got raped by Jim Howell [x4]
