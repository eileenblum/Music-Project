I never bothered to find out why youâre in jail
But, I think itâs funny that you are
I hope you didnât actually do it
And your life got ruined for nothing

[Chorus:]
I donât know why youâre in jail
And I donât fucking care
I hope you get raped every day
Iâm glad youâre stuck in there

You were probably in a drunken Indian blackout
You were drinking Listerine in the desert
Your bartender shut you off, so you tried to scalp him
Then you tried to shoot an FBI agent

[Chorus]
