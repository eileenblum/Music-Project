âIâd like to work here without being harassedâ

If you work with me, prepare to get harassed
When youâre standing at the copier, Iâll pinch your ass
I donât care if youâre ugly, donât care if youâre old
Youâre still a woman and I want to make your life miserable

[Chorus 1:]
Iâm gonna make you quit, Iâm gonna make you quit, Iâm gonna make you quit because youâre a woman [x2]

Iâm gonna spread rumors that youâre easy
Iâm gonna threaten to rape you on your email
Iâm gonna leave a dildo on your desk
So everyone can see it you stupid cunt

[Chorus 2:]
Iâm gonna make you quit [x3] because youâre a woman
Iâm gonna make you quit [x3] you fucking cunt
Iâm gonna make you quit [x3] you fucking bitch
Iâm gonna make you quit [x3] you stupid cunt

âLeave me alone!â
