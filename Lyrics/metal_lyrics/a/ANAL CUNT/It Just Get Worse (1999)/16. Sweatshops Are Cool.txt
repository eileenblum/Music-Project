You came to this country for a better life
You spent weeks hiding in a leaky boat
You work 18 hours a day, 7 days a week
For 50 cents an hour, you shouldâve stayed home

[Chorus:]
Sweatshops â you can barely afford rice
Sweatshops â your homeâs infested with mice
Sweatshops â 100 of you live in one room
Sweatshops â I hope you get deported soon

Iâm glad youâre underpaid
Iâm glad you get ripped off
Youâre too dumb to go on welfare
You suck guys that look like Dig off

[Chorus]
