Thereâs 3 of us, thereâs 6 of you
Weâll still beat the shit out of you
Your band sucks, your band is gay
You kicked us off the tour, 'cause we blow you away

[Chorus:]
ENT are scared of us
ENT are scared of us
Theyâre fucking gay
ENT are scared of us

First you ripped off Discharge, then Napalm Death
Youâre gay homosexual faggots, plus youâre fucking gay
Weâre faster than you, weâre heavier than you
Weâre better than you, and Dean has a dumb haircut

[Chorus:]
ENT are scared of us
ENT are scared
Theyâre all a bunch of faggots
And theyâre fucking gay
