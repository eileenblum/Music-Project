I was in a bad mood because my crack house got busted
I saw you and your dumb looking wife waiting for a train
I could tell it was true love
So as the train pulled in, I pushed her into it

[Chorus:]
I pushed your wife in front of the subway [x4]

I pushed your wife in front of the subway
It was on the orange line, but the tracks were red
I pushed that cunt in front of the subway
You had to tell your daughter that her mommy was dead

[Chorus]

It was so crowded no one saw who did it
Then I saw you crying like a fucking pussy
Good thing she never got the chance
To tell you she was pregnant again

I pushed your wife in front of the subway
