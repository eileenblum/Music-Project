Your dog was your only friend
You spent your life savings fixing its broken leg
You loved it more than your parents loved you
And then I ran it over

[Chorus:]
Your dog was dumb and now itâs dead
My tire tracks are tattooed on its head
[x2]

I dragged it 50 yards down the street
And you ran after me in tears
I almost cried because I was laughing so hard
Then I turned around and tried to hit you

[Chorus]
