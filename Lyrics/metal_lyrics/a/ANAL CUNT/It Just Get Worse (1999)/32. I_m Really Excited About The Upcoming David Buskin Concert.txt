I bought a bus ticket to the log cabin
Iâm gonna start a pit during the first song
Iâm gonna request âPapa You Were A Sailorâ
Iâm gonna bring 3 lighters to the show

I was really psyched to see Morbid Angel
I was really psyched to see Upsidedown Cross
I was really psyched to see Al Stewart
But not as much as

[Chorus:]
David Buskin, David Buskin, David Buskin is coming to my town

He was much better with Batteau
But heâs still heaver than Six Feet Under
Iâm gonna drink 5 cases of beer before the show
And smoke tons of pot, crack, and dust

I was really psyched to see Judas Priest
I was really psyched to see Black Sabbath
I was really psyched to see Phranc
But not as much as

[Chorus]
