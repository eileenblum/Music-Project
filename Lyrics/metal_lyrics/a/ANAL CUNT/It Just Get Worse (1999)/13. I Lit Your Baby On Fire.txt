I spent all my money on drugs, and couldnât afford to fly
I took a greyhound bus, you and your brat sat next to me
It wouldnât shut up, so I lit it on fire
For 30 seconds it was louder, then it shut up

[Chorus:]
I lit your, I lit your, I lit your, baby on fire [x4]

You came back from the bathroom and smelled something burning
You realized it was your baby and I started to laugh
You asked the driver to pull over, but he laughed at you too
You yelled at me, so I roasted some marshmallows on your kid

[Chorus]
