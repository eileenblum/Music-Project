[Chorus:]
Eric Clapton sucks, Eric Clapton sucks
Eric Claptonâs gay, and heâs fucking gay

Your father is the 4th worst singer
After Springsteen, Seger, and Petty
You were sick of his gay fucking songs
So you jumped out a really high up window

Your father sucks so fucking bad
You knew youâd get beaten up at school
You were sick of hearing âYou Look Wonderful Tonightâ
So you jumped out a really high up window

I almost wish you didnât die
Because I hate the song âTears In Heavenâ
I was glad you died until I heard that song
And Kevin Sharp is gay
