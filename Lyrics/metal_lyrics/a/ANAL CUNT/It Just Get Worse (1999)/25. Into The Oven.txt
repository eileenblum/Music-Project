First you lived on a farm
Then you got your head cut off
Then I bought you in a grocery store
Pretty soon youâll be on my plate

[Chorus:]
Into the oven [x3]
Iâm gonna eat you for Thanksgiving

Iâm not a faggot vegetarian
I donât care if the Indians lost their land
I think itâs really funny that they did
I like eating lots of food on Thanksgiving

[Chorus]
