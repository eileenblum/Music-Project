[Chorus:]
Women, natureâs punching bag [x4]

You didnât get me a beer
You were one minute late with dinner
You bought the wrong kind of beer
You wanted a career

[Pre-chorus:]
[Censored part]

[Chorus]

You forgot to cash my unemployment check
Youâre having your period
You want to visit your mother
You want to have another kid

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
