Ska is gay, Reggae is gay
Youâre fucking gay and youâre not punk
You say you hate corporations, but you were on NBC
Londonâs calling and theyâre calling you gay

[Chorus:]
Rancid sucks, Rancid sucks, Rancid sucks, and The Clash sucked too [x2]

If Kenny G had a Mohawk, he wouldnât be punk
If Yanni had dumb tattoos, he wouldnât be punk
If Garth Brooks pierced his nose, he wouldnât be punk
If Liberace sounded like The Clash, he wouldnât be punk

[Chorus]

Youâre gay, you suck [x6]
And The Clash sucked too
