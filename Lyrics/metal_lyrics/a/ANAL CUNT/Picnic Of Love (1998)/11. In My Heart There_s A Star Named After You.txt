As I look out the window, at the lights in the sky
It brings back the memories, and a tear to my eye

I see a star that we picked, as the landmark of our love
Our love would never die, as long as it was lit above

In my heart there's a star named after you
It's still inside me, even though that we're through
You were my angel, my gift from heaven above
But that star's all I have left of our past love

We'd lie under that star, on many a soft clear night
We'd lie on the green, green grass and hold each other tight
Until my actions eclipsed the sunshine of your love
All my apologies, they would never be enough
