When I look through the waterfall I see your eyes
Brings out feelings in me, girl, I just can't hide
With a smile on my heart and a flower in my hand
Girl, I'd love to be with you on a ???

When it rains I'll be your umbrella
I'm so glad to be your fella
I'm gonna take you to the zoo
I'm so in love with you

I've got waterfall wishes every day
I've got waterfall wishes, makes me happy but afraid
I've got waterfall wishes all day and night
I've got waterfall wishes to make you feel alright

If I were a pirate, you'd be my hook
About our tender lovemaking, girl, I could write a book
You're the sparkle in my wine and the pea in my pod
When we get together, girl, it'll be real hot

When it rains I'll be your umbrella
I'm so glad to be your fella
I'm gonna take you to the zoo
I'm so in love with you

I've got waterfall wishes every day
I've got waterfall wishes, makes me happy but afraid
I've got waterfall wishes all day and night
I've got waterfall wishes to make you feel alright
