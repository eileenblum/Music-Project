I was selling flowers by the side of the road
And you came to the flower stand
I was telling you about pansies and roses
But you tried to grab my hand

I'm flattered, but it's my choice
Sorry, I'm not that kind of boy
You may see a heart as a toy
Sorry, I'm not that kind of boy

You think love is a game, whatever you wish
But for me it's years till that magical first kiss
I'll wait until my heart's on cloud nine
Your lust-filled existence is far out of line

I'm flattered, but it's my choice
Sorry, I'm not that kind of boy
You may see a heart as a toy
Sorry, I'm not that kind of boy

You dared to ask me for a date alone
I was shocked you didn't want a chaperone
You were attractive, but way too fast
How could you expect this to ever last?

I'm flattered, but it's my choice
Sorry, I'm not that kind of boy
You may see a heart as a toy
Sorry, I'm not that kind of boy
