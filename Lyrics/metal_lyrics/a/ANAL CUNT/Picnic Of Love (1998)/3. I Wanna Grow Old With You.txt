I wanna wake up with you every day of my life
I'm oh so glad that you're my loving wife
I don't know what I'd do if you ever left me
I'd be worse than a ship lost at sea

Oh baby, you
I wanna grow old with you
My love for you, baby
Will always be true

When you're sick I'll be by your side with some tender loving care
Through all the good times, and when the cupboard is bare
When the baby is crying, I'll let you stay in bed
I'll honor every promise that I ever said

Oh baby, you
I wanna grow old with you
My love for you, baby
Will always be true

[Spoken:]
And on that sad day when one of us will depart
I'll be full of despair, it'll break my heart
But when I look back to our hopes, our dreams, and our love
I'll be glad to be reunited in the heavens above

Oh baby, you
I wanna grow old with you
My love for you, baby
Will always be true
