Help! This is Mother Earth!
Somebody please help me!

The corporations don't even care
While the rain forests go bare
Oil spills &amp; tanker wrecks
Don't show the sea creatures any respect

The park turned into a parking lot
The woods turned into a shopping mall
The swimming hole turned into a sewer dump
Isn't there anyone who cares at all?

Greed, greed, greed, greed, greed
Greed is something that we don't need

You stand by and watch the corporate rape
But not me, I made this tape
After 12 years of Bush &amp; Reagan
We've become an insensitive nation

The park turned into a parking lot
The woods turned into a shopping mall
The swimming hole turned into a sewer dump
Isn't there anyone who cares at all?

Greed, greed, greed, greed, greed
Greed is something that we don't need

Corporate greed, rape and crime
The laws are stepped on all the time
Polluting the water, they don't even think
But their money won't help when there's none left to drink

The park turned into a parking lot
The woods turned into a shopping mall
The swimming hole turned into a sewer dump
Isn't there anyone who cares at all?

Greed, greed, greed, greed, greed
Greed is something that we don't need
