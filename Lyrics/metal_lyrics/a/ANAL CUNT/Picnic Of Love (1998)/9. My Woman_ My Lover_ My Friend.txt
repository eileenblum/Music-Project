You were my high school sweetheart and my girl next door
You've been my lifelong best friend and so much more
We matured into each other's arms, we were never apart
You blossomed into the woman who owned my heart

You're my woman, my lover, my friend

I pushed you on swings, we played in the sand
I bought you ice cream from the ice cream man
I looked at you like a gardener looks at a flower
I would stare out my window at you for hours

You're my woman, my lover, my friend
You're my woman, my lover, my friend

You are my tender loving juice fruit, my reason to live
My heart's like a butterfly with flowers to give
I remember looking back to our high school prom
When I shook your dad's hand and gave flowers to your mom

You're my woman, my lover, my friend

I showered you with love, flowers and pearls
And you've given birth to our baby girls
You're my succulent sweet buttercup, and more importantly my friend
We're inseparable love cuddlebunnies til the very end

You're my woman, my lover, my friend
You're my woman, my lover, my friend
