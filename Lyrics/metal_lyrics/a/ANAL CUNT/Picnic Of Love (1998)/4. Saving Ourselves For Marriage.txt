I saw your deep blue eyes from afar
I saw you at the church bazaar
I asked the priest to introduce me to your mother
And I asked her to introduce us to each other

I asked you to go on a picnic of our own
But you insisted on taking a chaperone
I apologized for being so bold and rude
So I invited your parents for lemonade and food

We're saving ourselves
Saving ourselves for marriage
Saving ourselves, for a baby carriage
Restraining ourselves, till the moment's right
Saving ourselves, for our wedding night

After four years of dating, I decided to take a risk
I held both your hands, and kissed your rose-petaled lips
We stared into each others' eyes, wondering what was next
But we knew not to ruin our love with pre-marital sex

We're saving ourselves
Saving ourselves for marriage
Saving ourselves, for a baby carriage
Restraining ourselves, till the moment's right
Saving ourselves, for our wedding night

Years went by, our courtship was grand
One day I asked your father for your hand
I'd never treat you like an object, only like a lady
I'd never consider having sex, except to have a baby

We're saving ourselves
Saving ourselves for marriage
Saving ourselves, for a baby carriage
Restraining ourselves, till the moment's right
Saving ourselves, for our wedding night
