Please Sir, let me court your daughter
I'll treat her like the way I oughta
When I take her out I'll have her home by ten
I'll treat her better than the rest of the men

I'd love to have your daughter's hand in marriage
I'd love to push around a baby carriage
I wanna shake your hand &amp; call you dad
I'll never make your daughter sad

I want to carry her books home from school
I'll put my jacket over a puddle for you
I'll be your shelter in the worst of any storm
I'll always be there to keep you safe &amp; warm
