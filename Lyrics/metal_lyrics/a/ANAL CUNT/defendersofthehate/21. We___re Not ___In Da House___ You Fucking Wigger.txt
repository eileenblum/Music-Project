Real niggers always use you
Real whites think you suck
You want to give us props
But we hate you, you wigger

[Chorus:]
You think you're black- you're not
You think you're cool- you're not
You're not black- you're gay
You think you fit in- niggers hate you

Talk like a white man
Or Iâll beat your face in
You're not Doctor Dre
Stop thinking you're black

[Chorus]
