Your characters supposed to be 40
But you have to be at least 80
The make-up department should win an Emmy
For making people think your alive

[Chorus:]
Chuck Norris- you're really fucking old

You're the worst singer I have ever heard
You're even worse than I am
You should be climbing out of a grave
While you sing the fucking theme song

[Chorus]

You look like you just got embalmed
And were shopping for a coffin
Your partner looks fucking stupid
Being black and wearing a cowboy hat
