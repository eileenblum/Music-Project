You're such a fucking hebe
You're always freebasing pennies
You went to a plastic surgeon
And got your nose enlarged

[Chorus:]
You've got a tattoo of a penny- you're a hebosaurus
Your uncle's Murray Lender- You're a hebosaurus
You know all the words to Yentil- you're a hebosaurus
You're breath smells like a bagel- you're a hebesaurus

You have a yamaka welded on your head
You've tried to shoot up money
You beat off inside of banks
I want to stuff you in an oven

[Chorus:]
You've got a tattoo of a dradle- you're a hebosaurus
You idolize Gene Simmons- you're a hebosaurus
You think Scott Ian's cool- you're a hebosaurus
Your breath smells like matzoballs- you're a fucking hebosaurus
