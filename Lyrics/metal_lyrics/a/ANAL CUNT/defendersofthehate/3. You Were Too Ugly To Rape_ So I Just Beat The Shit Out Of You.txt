Rape [x4]

I drank a case of whiskey
And you looked like Jeanine Jizm
I drank another case of whiskey
And you looked like Roseanne Barr

[Chorus:]
You were to ugly to rape, so I beat you up
When I looked at you, I had to throw up

I drank a case of whiskey
And you looked like Sheila Micheals
I drank another case of everclear
And you looked like Ileana Douglas

[Chorus]
