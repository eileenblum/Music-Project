Jacques Morali wrote the heaviest music ever
Glenn Hughes had a deeper voice than Will from Mortician
He wore chains before Slayer and Venom
Jacques Morali was portrayed by Steve Guttenberg

[Chorus 1:]
If you don't like the Village people- you're fucking gay
If you think Jeff Olson was better cowboy- you're fucking gay
If you think Ray Simpson was a better cop- you're fucking gay
If you think Y.M.C.A. was their best song- you're fucking gay

All death metal songs were ripped off from Village People
"Evil dead" by Death is actually "Liberation" from the Village People
Will Rahmer looks like he should be in the Village People
No, Morbid Florist wasn't a reference to Will Rahmer

[Chorus 2:]
If you think Death were good after their demos- you're fucking gay
If you think rape is wrong- you're fucking gay
If you think the holocaust wasn't funny- you're fucking gay
If you think of Hellhammer as the drummer of Mayhem- you're fucking gay

Y-O-U-R-E-G-A-Y You're gay
