You toothless inbred retard
Why do you still even care?
Thereâll never be another Civil War
Youâre mad 'cause your trailer has a flat tire

[Chorus:]
The south wonât rise again [x4]

What could you possibly gain
By breaking the country in two?
Your overalls are gay
Let go of your sisterâs tit

I think itâs cool that you make moonshine
Itâs even cooler when you go blind from drinking it
How come your ancestors didnât realize
Theyâd lose 'cause their president was named after Boss Hogg

[Chorus]
