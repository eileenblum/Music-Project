I know this guy named Howard Wulkan,
he is really bald.
He has no hair on his head,
that's because he's bald.

Howard Wulkan [4x]

He be working at .......... [inaudible]
He used to work some place else.
He looks like that guy from ..........
and he's bald.

Howard Wulkan [4x]

That man is really bald,
He looks like ..........
He could really shave his head off.
ROCK ON BROTHER!

Howard Wulkan [4x]

.............
I'm not only the hairclub president,
I'm also client
