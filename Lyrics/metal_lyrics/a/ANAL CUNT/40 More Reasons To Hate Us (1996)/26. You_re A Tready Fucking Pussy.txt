you always talk behind my back,but when i see you,you want to shake my hand
when i see you ready to fight,you change your story like i knew you might
you grew up wanting to be just like me,but i'm not cool in your clique
anymore
i never changed with the trends like you did,so you're not allowed to like me
anymore
you always do whatever's fashionable,and you hate me cuz i don't
you want to be everyone's friend,and you hate me cuz i won't
you're defending someone you barely know,you're such a fucking homo
