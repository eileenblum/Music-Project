[Manowar cover]

HEAR THE POUNDING, ARMY OF THE NIGHT
THE CALL OF METAL SUMMONS US TONIGHT
AND GATHER WE ON THIS SITE
TO BEHOLD THE POWER AND THE MIGHT
WE WEAR LEATHER, WE WEAR SPIKES, WE RULE THE NIGHT

OFF WITH THE LIGHTS, HERA THE SCREAMS
SEE THE BANGING HEADS AWAKEN TO THEIR DREAMS
THE SOUND OF METAL SO LOUD IT CRACKS THE BEAMS
PLAYED BY WARRIORS CALLED THE METAL KINGS
A HERO'S WELCOME TO THOSE WHO HEED THE CALL

WE ARE TOGETHER, WE ARE ALL
WITH HANDS HIGH, FISTS FILL THE AIR
AGAINST THE WORLD WE STAND
HANDS HIGH FOREVER WE'LL BE THERE
GLOVES OF METAL RULE THE NIGHT, YEAH

LEATHER, METAL, SPIKES AND CHAINS
GLOVES OF METAL RAISED TO SHOW THE BRAVE
INTO THE DARKNESS MARCH THE ARMIES OF THE NIGHT
BOUND BY METAL WE LIVE THE FIGHT
WE WEAR LEATHER, WE WEAR SPIKES, WE RULE THE NIGHT

WITH HANDS HIGH, FISTS FILL THE AIR
AGAINST THE WORLD WE STAND
HANDS HIGH FOREVER WE'LL BE THERE
GLOVES OF METAL RULE THE NIGHT, YEAH
