I wish my dealer was open
It's too late to get some more coke
My dealer is closed for the night
And for once I'm not totally broke

I wish my dealer was open
I wish my dealer was open
I wish my dealer was fucking open
I wish my dealer was open

You stupid spic, why aren't you open
You fucking spic, why won't you answer your fucking phone
You goddamned spic, why aren't you open
You worthless spic, I know that you're fucking home

I wish my dealer was open
I wish my dealer was open
I wish my dealer was fucking open
You god dammed fucking spic pick up the phone

ANSWER THE FUCKING PHONE, SPIC!!!
