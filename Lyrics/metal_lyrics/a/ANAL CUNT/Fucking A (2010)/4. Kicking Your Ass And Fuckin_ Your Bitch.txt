[Written by: Seth Putnam]

I just ordered my 30th whiskey
Your bitch comes over, starts gettin' frisky
She says, âAren't you the badass singer of A.C.?â
Next thing you know she starts to blow me

Your loser boyfriend is getting pissed off
As she sees you sucking me off
The little pussy spills my fucking glass
Next thing you know I'm kicking his fucking ass

[Chorus:]
I'm kicking your ass and I'm fucking your bitch (x4)

I punch his face in then I pull down her pants
I start to fuck her in her fucking ass
She starts screamin' and yellin' my name
She fucking dumps you cause you're fucking lame

[Chorus]

After I fuck her she's no use anymore
She crawls back to you she's a worthless whore
Now you're covered in blood and she's filled with my cum
I tell the bartender, âBring me drink 31!â

[Chorus]
