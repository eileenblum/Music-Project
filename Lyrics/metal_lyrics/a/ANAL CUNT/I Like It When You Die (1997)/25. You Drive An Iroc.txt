you're from the north end-wop
you're from revere beach-wop
you can't have a barbeque-wop
the spaghetti always falls through-wop

[chorus:]
you drive an el camino,your hero's barbarino,your cousin's name is guido,on the beach you wear
a speedo

you drive an iroc-wop
your girlfriend has a mustache-wop
you were an altar boy-wop
you got raped by a priest-wop

[chorus]

you put on a bottle of colonge today,you're italian and you're fucking gay
your fucking name is fucking vinnie,and you're a greasy fucking guinea
you can't have freckles-wop
they slide off your face-wop
you braid your girlfriend's breast hair-wop
you shave your granny's back hair-wop
