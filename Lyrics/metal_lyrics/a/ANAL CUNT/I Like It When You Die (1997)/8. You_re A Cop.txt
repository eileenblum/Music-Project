powdered sugar on your fingers, coffee on your shirt
bribes in your pocket, you never do any work
you fat fucking slob you just sit in a car
until you get off work then it's back to the bar

[chorus:]
you fucking pig-pig
you're a fucking cop-cop [x4]

you never catch any crooks but harass everyone else
your fat fingers don't fit the trigger you're too slow to catch a nigger
you're a suburban cop because you're scared of the city
you broke a stool at dunkin donuts because you're so fucking fat

[chorus]

[repeat first verse]

[chorus]
