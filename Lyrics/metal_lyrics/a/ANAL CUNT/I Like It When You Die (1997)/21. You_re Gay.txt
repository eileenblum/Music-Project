[chorus:]
y-o-u-r-e-g-a-y,you're gay [x4]

you volunteer for charity work-you're gay
you care about the environment-you're gay
you're a ballet dancer-you're gay
you're a cake decorator-you're gay

[chorus]

you subscribe to honcho-you're gay
you go to fashion shows-you're gay
you love playing hacky sack-you're gay
you go to poetry readings-you're gay

y-o-u-r-e-g-a-y,you're gay
