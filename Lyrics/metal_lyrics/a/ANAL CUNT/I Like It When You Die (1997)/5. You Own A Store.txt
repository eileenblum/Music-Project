hide your dogs, hide your cats-gook,gook
you can't drive, your face is flat-gook,gook
your eyes aren't straight, it's you i hate-gook,gook
you pick rice, we bombed you twice-gook,gook

[chorus:]
you're a fucking gook [x4]

your accent's gay, please go away-gook,gook
you look alike, you ride a bike-gook,gook
you own a store, i kicked in your door-gook,gook
you fucking gook, you make me puke-gook,gook

[chorus]
