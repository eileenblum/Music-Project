[Part I: "Spear forest"]

A marchin forest of spears in the dusk
Warmachine's raping the earth
Bloodstained black banners dance with the wind

Hail the warlord
Who rides in the front

Black armour reflects the moon
Spectral realms on his demon forged sword
His hunting eyes....
His hunting eyes are wolves

Drums of war- Pound hard as lightning strokes
Mountain sides shakes by the sound

Roars from the horns- Rides hard on the wind
Death is the name of the hymn

The crests of one thousands clans is upheld
Be shattered forever or march with us now

[Part II: "The honouros onslaught"]

Marching onward- leaving wasteland behind
Black sorcery and steel in command
Marching onward as a blizzard of swords
Allegiance is sworn to the black god

Foul our deeds- Terrible our deeds
A burning tundra's left behind
Steam from the bodies wich have fallen in the snow
Rises like thick fog to the sky

Iron and blood- Trampled sculls in the mud
Arrows like rain- Desecrating of the slained

[Part III: "The Mercenary"]

Come to me...
Weak ones- be food to my axe
It's twin edges thirst for your blood
My winter pale horse grinds down all resist
I ride with the speed of the light

I need no shield- As i plough through the field
I gaze towards the sky for the sign of...

[Part IV: "The appearance of the warrior wraith"]

Three dead man rode across the sky
Three kingly warlords of the night
Three hunting spirits crowned with silver thorns
Upon beasts long forgotten in time

Terrible to behold
Mortal men weeps blood in fear
Darkened wraiths
With burning whips
Three servants of Danu
Three knights of Crom-Cruach

[Part V: "Death of abominable light"]

This should be day but the moon stands high
The sign is bright- the end is near
Few men lives when the battle seace
Deaf for pleas we give them peace

[Part VI: "The coming of the rightfull king"]

Castle walls may come fall down
Kingdoms be shattered for our crown
May cities crawl by our feets
In deadly grace we'll ride the streets

Wictory- I breed thy breeze
The taste of iron in my mouth
The coming of the rightfull king

I rule this world- Now I roll the dice

[Part VII: "The honorous onslaught"]

Marching onward- Leaving wasteland behind
Black sorcery and steel in command
Marching onwards as a blizzard of swords
Allegiance is sworn to the black god

Foul our deeds- Terrible our deeds
A burning tundra's left behind

Steam from the bodies which has fallen in the snow
Rises like thick fog to the sky

Iron and blood- Trampled sculls in the mud
Arrows like rain- Desecrating of the slained

[Part VIII: "The Mercenary"]

Come to me...

Weak ones- Be food to my axe
It's twin edges thirst for your blood
My winter pale horse grinds down all resist
I ride with the speed of the light

[Part IX: "A hail and prayer to the celtic gods"]

Gods of all things wild
Of storm and warlit sky
Of battles past present and to come
With faith in thee I know I can not die....

[Part X: "Epiloge- Battlestorm"]

My testemony
The march of warlike damned
