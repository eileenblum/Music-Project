[-A beggar attempts to guide the boy back to the path of hope and truth.]

A beggar with faith, I see.
But as I can tell, you have lost everything.
So what makes you keep believing?
What keeps you from giving?
Tell me now, because I need it more than ever!
âI know with all that has gone away,
youâd think that I would be filled with hate.
The things Iâve witnessed are examples of
How realityâs gear turns us.
If we face reality, thatâs when weâll feel true.
And with that, you will be able to find the truth.â
So was it meant to be? To see the things I have seen?
To lose what comforted me?
âIâve been in your position; given up on myself before
What you canât forget is everything happens for a reason.
Itâs hard to keep that in mind,
But everything will be fine in the end.â
Oh, how selfish I have been to think that I am nothing
When youâre out on the roads, out in the cold,
Where we throw our dignity!
And yet, you still have hope for this world.
âJust know youâre worth something
All it takes is faith.
I can only hope you have learned.â
