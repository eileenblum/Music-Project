[-The boy finds no comfort. There is nothing left for him in this world, or so he thinks.]

Coming to terms as an insatiable man
After searching for all these years.
Itâs time to admit of my ignorance;
I will not find her comfort here.
Iâve wasted my youth searching for lies.
No, nothing can save me now.

With eyes closed, I speculate on what I called my own
Before death decided to play its role.
With eyes open, I realize that this world has nothing to offer
All I have is hate!
This world has nothing to offer.
And I have no faith!
This world has nothing to offer,
So I will forsake my life!
And I will end it tonight!
This is my volition!
