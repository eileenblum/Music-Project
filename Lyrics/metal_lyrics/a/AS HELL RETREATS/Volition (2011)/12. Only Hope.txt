[-The boy is rushed to a hospital. A friend, the father, and the minister visit him to share their thoughts. ]

âYou coward! You try to rid yourself from this life!
With all the bitterness you had for this world,
I know you had a heart of gold like you use to haveâ¦â

âWhat have I done? I never showed care for my son.
This is the consequence for my negligence.â

ââ¦I can only hope you use it well on the other side.
But I will keep hoping you do not pass.
So that it can be shared, so that your heart can be shared.â

âI keep asking why youâre still in pain
If you wear the scars of my mistakes.
Oh, but I was wrong to throw you past my walls
And wound you deeper still for questioning your faith.
But no manâs doubts could ever change the truth
And now I see how much you need to be in her arms foreverâ¦ 
I can only hope you wake up from this sleep so you can
be the angel she would want you to be
Whether itâs here or up there.
We can only hope!â
