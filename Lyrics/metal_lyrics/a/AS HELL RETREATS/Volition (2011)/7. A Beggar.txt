[-The boy visits his motherâs gravesite. He notices he is not the only one in the graveyard.]

As I walk in the black morning grave
A man of wisdom is who I see.
Not the one we talk about in the sky,
But someone we spit on or deny
Because of greed. (Because of me!)

He is a man with something to prove
And he has nothing to lose.
And while I do nothing for anyone, anymoreâ¦
He keeps firm for something greater.
I must learn.
