âWe both know that I am no comfort, no being anymore. But what you do not realize is that deathâ¦that death is only a beautiful way out of the restraints of our hardened lives. It is a sight. A rebirth. So release me! Because I have been released from your world and its sleep! We will reunite on my sanctityâs timeâ¦not yours.â

Wake up.
