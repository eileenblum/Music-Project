[-The boy feels alone, and is looking for comfort. He requests an audience with a minister of his church, believing that this man will have answers.]

Iâm looking for answers.
Iâve been told I can find it here.
Iâve been praying, but Iâm not feeling any better.
I come to you to seek truth.
Tell me now, why is she gone?
âSometimes the good Lord gives and takes away
And we will never understand.
You must know it is for a good intentionâ
And for that, he has lost my attention
To love a murderer.
How can I forgive him for that?
âFaith is a key to keep your head up high.â
Even that has been a struggle.
Thatâs reality.
âBut it is all for his plan
I have faith in you, you know.â
Iâve had enough of this reality.
Iâm ready to throw it out
My hope, my faith, and yours.
What makes you think I can still believe?

âThen take your little faith out of my walls! Iâve had enough!â

I was only finding comfort here.
Now you have shunned.
Youâve shunned me.
