[-With confusion and anger growing inside, the boy cannot have faith in a religion that does not welcome those who are questioning or in doubt.]

Is this what you call âthe truth, way, and life?â
To abolish the minds that wonât see eye to eye?
Just know youâre no better than me,
Whether Iâm a child of God or not.
Youâre told to live and love,
But instead, you try to think youâre above everyone.
Well, to your god that has influenced you:

I am no longer yours
I will separate my mind from those
Who have sacrificed themselves
To be poisoned by your words
That have never helped me.

Is it hard to believe that I will not be like you, and I never will?
You manipulator, you donât control me anymore.
You donât control my mind, anymore.
