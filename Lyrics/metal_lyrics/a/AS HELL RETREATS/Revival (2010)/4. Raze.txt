We can overcome anything
That stands in our way
And together we will raze Hell.
Raze Hell.

This world has had enough of this torture
It's not taking care of the orphans and widows
I am so sick of this filth

We can overpower the demons
And together we will raze Hell.

This darkness will make us heartless
If we keep idle

I can't stand to see you like this
And neither can His son
So raze Hell from your future.
