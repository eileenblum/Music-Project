Why do you look up to me when I am only human just like you?
I'm a failure, I fall.
I never give my all.

Don't depend on the person I am
I get lost in skepticism, too.
I get lost.

We're not gods, we're only messengers.

Quit looking straight for the answers.
Look up. Look up. Look up.
To someone who gives His all without exceptions

The only thing I can do is give you aid
Because I can never guide you all the way
Because sooner or later I will be gone.
And He will still be by your side.
