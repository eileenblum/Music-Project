What have we become? People who say we care for each other?
A nation where we are under God?

We ignore, we deny, we never pay attention to the sins we commit to the helpless
to the sins we commit to the helpless.

If weâre supposed to be one nation under God, why are we denying the blind?
Why are we denying the sick? My God, we are not under You.
We are the disease. We are listed under the disease.
American Christianity is a disease.

America, if we can find ways to kill people, we can find ways to help.
Quit with the overspending on violence that makes us the contradiction.
Thatâs sending us straight to hell.

We are a contradiction and I apologize to those whoâve held out their hands.
I apologize. Iâm appalled now.
