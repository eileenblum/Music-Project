You are the one who tells my future
Or you attempt to at least
And I listened, thinking you were my savior.

I was the desperate one
The aging of life caught up to me too fast
And then I realized what you all plotted
You tried to steal me
Steal my freedom of what I truly want to believe.

It's been three years and I've got only one thing to say.
Don't steal my God.
Don't you ever steal my God from my reach.

I believed in your words and not his
But to me, my brother
You're still my brother forever
And I still love you
But don't you dare attempt to be my God again.
