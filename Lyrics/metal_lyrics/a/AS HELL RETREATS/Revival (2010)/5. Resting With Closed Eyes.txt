We rest with closed eyes
Never knowing when someone will leave us behind
Instead we shut it down, we shut it off.
We all become lost of what should always be found

Ignorance blinds us.
Ignorance blinds us all from beauty
Beauty of having a thought for ourselves.

Instead we discriminate the ones we love
And push them aside
The next thing, they leave the world
Our world, our arms, our grasp
And we can't apologize anymore

Jesus, you only ask us to do one thing
That is to love all and serve all.
But we become weak instead with demons
We become impure

We can fight this off, we can overcome.
With you Lord, our Almighty.
Amen.
