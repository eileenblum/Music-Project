Starting over with no hope for turning back
Still it's calling me, it's calling me
Saturated with a vigorous routine
I hear it calling me, still calling me again

Under this stress it's a mess I cannot avoid entirely

Trapped in distraction again I fall the victim to fighting thoughts with focus this paradox will be the end of me

Wired head to toe the rest must go
Wired head to toe the rest must go
No need for an alibi

I can't recall what's next
Unless I learn from a past demise
This scattered recollection fails
My mind is pacing back and forth through walls of a restless daze and consciousness is fading

What breaks inside is not the world to me
But will I ever make my way back safe inside this remedy
What breaks inside is not the world to me
But will I ever make my way back safe inside this remedy

Will I ever make my way back safe safe inside this remedy
If I had an ounce of strength left I could assure myself that I'm alright

The fall of a battling man is unstoppable
The fall of a battling man is unstoppable
Watch your step

What breaks inside is not the world to me
But will I ever make my way back safe inside this remedy
What breaks inside is not the world to me
But will I ever make my way back safe inside this remedy
