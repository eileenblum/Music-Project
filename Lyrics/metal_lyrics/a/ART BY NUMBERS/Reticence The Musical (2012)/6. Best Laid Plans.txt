I've finally got something to say but I buried it alive
Now it's too too late for me to deny it 
I've finally got something to say but I buried it alive
Now it's to too late for me to deny it 

The rules are only in play
When consequence is unnamed
The rules are only in play
When consequence is unnamed

And everybody else has reason to walk away 
You got to know somebody to know that things are going to be okay

So I left a note pertaining to all the detail left unsaid
The good deeds got erased but I left the bad ones on her bed

And when the list is read out loud 
You'll know exactly where I've been
It's not about the things I've done
It's only a matter of where I'm going

The rules are only in play 
When consequence is unnamed
The rules are only in play 
When consequence is unnamed
The rules are only in play 
When consequence is unnamed

And everybody else has reason to walk away 
You got to know somebody to know that things are going to be okay
And everybody else has reason to walk away 
You got to know somebody to be okay

I know exactly what you're thinking
You're worlds apart from meâ¦don't be mistaken 
You know that I can't be part of this but maybe I'll stick around for a while 
Little did you know that I was unstable? 
Wondering out about a world of strangers 
False pretenses I made amends 
Shaking the hand of a lasting endeavor 
I've been falling so long that I can't feel the breeze
But now that I've found a releaseâ¦I am free
