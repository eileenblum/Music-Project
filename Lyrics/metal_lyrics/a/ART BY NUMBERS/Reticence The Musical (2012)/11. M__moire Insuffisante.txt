Fortune smiled and took him by the hand
You'll never have to worry
You'll never reach an end...she said
Times stretching you thin but the answers just around the bend
Now patiently waits his turn to discover a truth 
Behind doors newly opened to him
It seems that nothings promised
Another act yet still the same page he finds himself
Right back where he began
Only now with pockets worth of empty promises in his hands

Pin it all on your scapegoats
Oh how misleading 
They're surely the ones who cost you 
Now that your dues are paid
Let complacency be the fire for your regret 

Retrospect seems so familiar 
With a feeling of despair 
Holding on to the ground
Until the feeling you're bound to 
Falling off the surface disappears

Retrospect seems so familiar 
With a feeling of despair 
Holding on to the ground
Until the feeling you're bound to 
Falling off the surface disappears

Traces leading us 
To an ends that did not justify the means

When you losses are cut 
Is it more than skin deep?
We've created a way out now

When you losses are cut 
Is it more than skin deep?
We've created a way out now

Retrospect seems so familiar with a feeling of despair 
Holding on to the ground
Until the feeling you're bound to 
Falling off the surface disappears

He counted each and every grain that trickled down
But long since overdue was the accounting of his own
Wasted wishing a past could be undone
