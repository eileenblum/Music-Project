Under the circumstances 
We were bound to find a new ambition
Letting go of this trend
Without a fascination
There is always unrest
Take it as a privilege
You'll find your existence

Undermining what they built is your escape
Take it and run while you can before...too late

I have misinformed you *background whispers*
I demand your best intentions
I demand your best intentions

And there's no telling what's been done
It's just a state of mindless

I've been around this story too long
Can we find another way to move on?
They're only following tradition
Can we find another way to move on?
They're only following traditionâ¦follow me

And I'm doing the best I know I can
But they're taking the most from me again

I'm setting the course ahead
Few and far and between are etched in stone
But I'll be the first to take a leap of faith

We played the best of foolsâ¦the best of fools
And we had time to spare
We played the best of foolsâ¦the best of fools
And we had time to spare

They're only following tradition
Can we find another way to move on?
They're only following tradition
Can we find another way?

We played the best of foolsâ¦the best of fools
And we had time to spare
We played the best of foolsâ¦the best of fools
Regressing to the meme
