Carry me
Up across the atlas
Let it be
Wash my hands or find me in open sea

On and on
Surely there's an end to this
I've been left out
I realize I've landed on the other side
Considering all I've heard
Confiding in what I know
Wondering why I'd ever wait so long

You know I can see further than I should 
But will I hesitate
Ending up alone
Will you add to my persistence?
With the details that I'm shown
Ambient lights behind the skies 
Burning everything that I recall
You reveal my true disguise 
When you are breaking down these walls

I am reciting all alone and on my own 
Can you be more than I will know? 
Are you whispering to me? 
Leaving marks for me to find
Will you leave me on my own?
I can see it now and it's I'll ever know
Insecurity as we sway in situation

And we'll let it be 
As we're testing our foundation

I can see it now and it's all I'll ever know 
Insecurity as we sway in situation...
