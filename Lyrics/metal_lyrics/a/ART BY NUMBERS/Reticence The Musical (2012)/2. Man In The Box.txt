Blissful Ignorance, such a shame that we can't enjoy
Tune our minds back in to the stream, and together we'll flow

"Pardon me my dear, you are mistaken
There is nothing here to find a claim with
Please file to the back
You're interrupting
Smooth transition helps to hide disruption

There's a vacancy unknown
Only those who fill the void return intact...I'm told
There's a vacancy unknown
Such a mystery to those who haven't
Oh no, tell me, what am I supposed to do as everything in front of me unfolds
Calm but concerning, search these worlds, so preoccupied.

When you find yourself shaking,
It's just the medication that's withdrawn from haunting you

It's no concern of ours, just know we're saving the best part
Remind yourself that you're expendable
A perfect symmetry that lies beyond comprehension
Don't be so bold to call out towards the sky
Did you ask yourself why?

So proud to reveal deception but so unprepared to find what lies beneath
Now you're bound by restless fear, uncovered all the pieces that provided shelter
Understand there is no turning back this time
Because you've gone too far, you've gone too far,
Understand this is not negotiable
I fear you've gone too far, you've gone too far this time.
