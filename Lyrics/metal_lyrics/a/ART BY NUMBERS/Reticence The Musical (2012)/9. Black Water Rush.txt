Be cast aside
For crimes that were pure
Only to find
You're empty handed
Once more and I 
I'll be a believer
Of the truth in wine

You can't tell me anymore
These understatements will
Surround me with 
With ivory and lore

I'm fixed
Ready to stand surrounded 
Breath in these flames
We'll rise from the ground andâ¦

Once more my crimes were pure
We all end up empty handed
Once more and I'll be a believer still empty handed

No more
Ridiculed for always asking why
No more
Ridiculed for always asking why

We appose every right
Can we ingest the night and hang it on our hopes
Why hang it on everything?
Why waste it on anything?
Why hang it on everything?
Just watch we're both becoming empty handed.
