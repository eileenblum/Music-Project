We've compensated our days
We've gone and done it our way
Don't fear what's to come of us
We've done it plenty of times 
We've done it plenty of times before

Such a road ahead
We're weighing the impossible at hand
We're weighing the impossible at hand

With a break in the passage taken
A comprehension of choice to make
With a silent reserve we ponder
The lasting effects of our ways

We're stuck in this state of ecstasy through debris
Unfortunate times have fallen upon our feet
We're stuck in this state of ecstasy through debris
Unfortunate times have fallen upon our feet

We're only saying what we want you to know 
Give us your attention 
Taking us so far away
She said that pain is only temporary
We play and pay her gain

Believe me when I say
We took the simple route towards 
An honest mistakeâ¦an honest mistake
We took the simple route towards 
An honest mistakeâ¦an honest mistake

We're stuck in this state of ecstasy through debris
Unfortunate times have fallen upon our feet
We're stuck in this state of ecstasy through debris
Unfortunate times have fallen upon our feet

Returning the path we fell down almost seems too far
We'll make the most of this under the lights the world is ours

We're only straying from ourselves when we break our word
Don't repress it just embrace the chance to hold on to what's left
We're only straying from ourselves when we break our word
Don't repress it just embrace the chance to hold on to what's left

We're only saying what we want you to know give us your attention 
We're only staying until we've taken care of unfinished business
Awayâ¦away she said they have placed these ambitions on our hands
