Don't be so certain of what's left at hand
I'm tearing up every page so eloquently put but misconstrued
We never stood a chance

Waiting on others to finally discover it's just an empty space that binds us
To the world to everything we've ever asked for ourselves

Our promises best unkept have already found us
And all the while we still claimed sanity
And all the while we still claimed sanity

These lasting words took the best of us and tore our lives apart

My final fear was the first of every choice that I regret
Life takes away all the rest of what had given clarity
Too late never replace what's left it's all taken for granted

I won't underestimate the damage
So far everything is unappealing

And all I feel is that the worst to come is right around the bend
My only hope is to reverse what's done and suffer consequence

This is more than a just reward
This is more than I bargained for
This is more than a just reward
This is more than what I thought was in store
