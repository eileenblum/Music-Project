Wide eyed and waiting
Arms are at my side
There is no time for wasting

You've got to be kidding me 
You're always beating on my back
You're always pushing me to be more than I am

On and on once more with my eye on the prize
Looking at the mirror with no obvious place to hide inside
And I'll prevail with the slightest of hands these ships will set sail
And under my command we...
Divided and conquer 
The raising of flags will fill the sky andâ¦

We are nothing but relegated men at bay
Brave harsh seas and follow me find glory in the wind

Be cunning 
Be clever 
And let it show

A thief at heart from the start cause it's all I'll ever know
If things weren't so dark waiting here in the after glow for you 

I am trading black for blue
Waiting in the after glow for you

Never found a reason to go on alone
Never took the time to clear my mind 

We are only relegated men
We'll find glory

Still caught in the perfect place 
At the worst of times thinking twice 
But now its the perfect time to adjust the line 
And reverse your thoughts of old
Remember the motions before you carry yourself away 
You're now in the perfect place
But you're out of time don't give up
You're not the only one
