Sanity fades with every breath I take
I'm drowning in shadows
on the way to my fate
None of your words will ever
reach me again
I'm drowning in shadows
I'm calling your name
Now here I stand in a shade
of my dream
I start to forget that you
blame it on me
You don't know if you're right
It's just hatred you see

When the night falls down on me
This is the time where I can see
I need no longer run away
When the night falls down on me
All of my sadness disapears

Still I am disdained by you
Still I am blamed by you
Color me black till I hate forever
Hate me till I hate my self forever

[Chorus]

Now I know I'm still alone
And have to face the light
No escape - I have to stay
And hear your abscent cries
My memories are fading away
Desperation will end

[Chorus]
