Once againthe pictures
disarray
No more empty words
that go astray
Paralize I step into
the stream
Hoping all my lies
will follow me

I feel the dawn rise in me
The light disappears
I start to regret
I can't breake these chains
I die to live again

Ever so I try to turn arround
Electrifying voices
tie me down
My senses are erased
I'm breathing in the flames
The termination has begun
I cannot break these chains

[Chorus]
