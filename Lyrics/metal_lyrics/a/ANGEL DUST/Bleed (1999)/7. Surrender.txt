I still heart the tales
That often have been told
I hardly tried to listen
Discover word of gold
Knowledge ain't wisdom
But led you through your life
And all I ask you for
is let me live mine

I hear a voice
From deep inside - open your eyes
The truth of one is
another book of lies

From birth till death
There's a road for everyone
Easy to survey so easy to run
But all simplicity might be a lie
And your grave was digged
Long before you die

Those words of stone
decay so soon
Your truth ain't mine
Why're you so sure you're divine
My life- just a cesspool of lies
My life- anyone could supply
My life- ignorance with no remorse

Beat me - treat me
Respect I am silent
And deaf of all those
curent instructions
That you - spit on - me
Imagine I am one
Just like you who believes
It's worth to besome one
Of love - of faith - and pride
Do you believe that your god
Is anybetter than mine
Are you sure it's his will
My kind - is the next one - to die

Surrender - why do you think I should
Surrender - do you belive I ever could
Surrender - to make you believe I'm fine
Surrender - this ain't a term of mine

Wars have already been tought
No one is left to die
Have you come to an answer
Who's better you or I
A voice breakes the silence
And tells the only truth
That will last forever
My word for my own life

[Chorus]
