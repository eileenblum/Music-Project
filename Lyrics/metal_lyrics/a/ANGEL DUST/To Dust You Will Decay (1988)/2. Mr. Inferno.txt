There is a land in the middle east region
ruled by black gold
and a crazy religion
There is a satan with certain charisma
he instigates thousands to play the Kamikaze game
the tyrant has the power of words
His bible is built on barbaric foundations
laws from a forgotten century that live again
to die is a straight way to glory
Black widows march proclaim their own slavery
and even children grow to fighters in war
David fights Goliath Uncle Big Satan
the banner of the holy warblood for bloodlife for life
Mr Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
A hellish old man plans the overkill riot
he letz his land bleed till end in a war for his pride
it's his demonstration of might
The distinguised expression on face of the old man
his hiding ideas full of madness for adamned deadly game
We won't retain to fight it back
save the ballance land he rules
We'll hold the power on the border
they've sworn the oat
hand die on his order
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
So it's destroyed the work of a century
the iron towers melt down in the fire of hate
No survivor in a war out of gain
pain or glory described in the book of all fates
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
makes the blood boil in the veins of his land
Mr. Inferno he is responsible
Holding the lifes of his man in his hands
[repeat]
He is responsible
