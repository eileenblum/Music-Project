Seventh day restless I wait
yes I wait for the right word
twelve o'clock this is my time
time to change to the nightbird and like
a snake I am winding myself into tight jeans
the look on my face's gonna make all the
girls know what I mean
I come in the music stops
and you see everyone turning
then I walk cool as I can
straight to the bar and start smoking
I feel hot looks in my back
and I'll soon chose my victim
I am the king and my right is to show you
what I need
You know here I am again
it's my show
now I'm back on the road
so show action and go
I think of the time that I waisted
how can you tell till you've tasted?
Why nobody told me I'm wrong
I can not be
can not be king all my life
[solo]
My straight face is lying about motions
that live in my heart
like a figure of stone
I am waiting for you to start
You know here I am again
it's my show
now I'm back on the road
I think of the time that I waisted
how how can you tell till you've taisted?
why nobody told me I'm wrong
I can not be
can not be king all my life
