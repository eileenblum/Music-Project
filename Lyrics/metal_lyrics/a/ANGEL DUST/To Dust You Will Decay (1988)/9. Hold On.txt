You ride on a silver spider
captured in his net
and your prince rides beside you
he knows no way to help
You walk through tubes of mistery
you see light at the end
but when you reach the exit
your're cought by thousand hands
You ride on a silver spider
captures in his net
and your prince rides beside you
he knows no way
You fall pictures create the lies
You fall but your mind denies
Hold on don't you lose your dreams
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
don't you lose your dreams tonight
In the night
You sail on a purple ocean
the wind inflates your wings
burned by an old emotion
your wooden sailboat sinks
When flames of memory touch you
you'll see they've burned so long
and deep in a nest in side you
another dream is born
You fall ...
Hold on ...
You ride on a silver spider ...
Hold on don't you lose your dreams
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
Hold on save your fantasy
Hold on save dreams for me
Hold on every nightmare's got an end
