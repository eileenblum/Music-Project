Can you hear the rolling thunder
pounding through the sky
gods revenge will always find you
when you hide in the night
there is no forgiveness for you
when you pray down on your knees
you've got to fight to fight the slavery
in the bad dimension heat
You've got wingswings of an angel
yeah you've got wings
wings of an angel
To take you to the stars
to take you on your last fight
they're taking you so high
higher &amp; higher &amp; higher &amp; higher &amp; higher
taking you higher
taking you high
Then you meet the evil wizzard
to sell him heart and soul
you should escape from this dimension
before you're getting cold
there'll be no forgiveness for you
when you pray down on your knees
and when the angels sing of glory
you're lost in deepest haze
To take you to the stars
to take you on your last fight
they're taking you so high
higher &amp; higher &amp; higher &amp; higher &amp; higher
taking you higher
taking you high
Thunderbolts are striking
your sword with golden blade
you feel you bleed so badly
but you're fighting till the end
there is no forgiveness for you
when you pray down on your knees
and when the angels sing of glory
you're lost in deepest haze
You've got wings
wings of an angel
yeah you've got wings
wings of an angel
Wings of an angel
taking you high to the sky
Wings of an angel
so you can fight the slavery
[repeat]
