You're running into tragedy
signs announcing danger
for your life
will end in agony
and your bodies will decay to dust
Dust you are created of
and eternal laws can never change
change in our universe
dust to dust decays
You'll roast in flames
with the soals fo no name
your bones burste under mountains of bones
A voice from some
whereis calling your name
when you're in league with the gods
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
Everything that you achieved
all you tried has been in vain
you're treated with indignity
somewhere in a nowhere you will
fight
for the right to survive
don't blasphemise the holy signs
who will you bein the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
who will you bein the judgment of gods
after the night when you'll die
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
pay attention to my warning
Pray
Or to dust you will decay
on a painfull morning
To dust you will decay
you will decay
