Retread - lay down the row
That I've been told to fight,
- For whom?
The child in me is dead,
Innocence is lost,
Ripped out of my heart,
- By whom?
I've found my way;
So I thought and so I hardly tried
my whole life
Or could I have failed?
Oh, "Lord" watch over me
So I prayed each night
And believed to do the right
How could "He" fail?
Too dull - to open my eyes
Too blind - look, what's behind
Too vain - to confess my own lie
Pain - through which hell we have gone
Pain - into void we were thrown
Pain - we brought and we suffered
Pain - mankind went insane
Pain - there's no way to undo
Pain - 'cos I followed you too
