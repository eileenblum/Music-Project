Light a candle for redemption
Ridiculous you are
Blame the demons
Blame the fire for atrocity

Wise man's words of revelation
Stuck inside your minds
Destination Arian-nation
Hate is what you are

I am the pain you suffer
I am the hope you feel
I am eternal fire - for you believe
I've got this evil - got this evilness

Salem's burning, crosses turning
Burn in desire's name
Light a candle for redemption
Riculous you are

[repeat chorus]
