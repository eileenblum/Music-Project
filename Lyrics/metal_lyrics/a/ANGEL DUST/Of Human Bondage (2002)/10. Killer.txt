So you want to be free
To live your life the way you want to be
Will you give if we cry
Will we live or will we die, yeah

Solitary brother, is there still a part of you that wants to live
Solitary sister, is there still a part of you that wants to give

Jaded hearts heal with time
Shoot that love so we can stop the bleeding
If we try and live our lives
The way we want, the way we want to be, yeah

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat chorus]

Racism in among future kings can lead to no good
Besides all our sons and daughters already know how that feels

[Repeat chorus]
[Repeat chorus]
