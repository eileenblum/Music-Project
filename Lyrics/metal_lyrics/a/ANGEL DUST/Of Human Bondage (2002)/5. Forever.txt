It's a tragedy - that's coming near
Hatred chains our thoughts - born in fear
Makes our children be martyrs of vanity
Sacrifice in another gods name

We speak of love and mercy 
While only bullets answering every thrown stone
We praise our lord in heaven
But all our deeds are by blood and pain

Let's lay down our swords now
And let the blood dry now
It's not our destiny to be enemies
There can be a tomorrow
So let the blood dry now
No war can last forever

Time of killing lasts for so many years
Life lights burn so fast - all that's left are tears
Do you really believe our gods want us to kill?
Not one word of our belief tells this is out lords will

Time runs fast for you and me
But still our souls can be saved by the glory of love
Take the hand that reaches out for you
Let's end the madness before it's too late - too late

[repeat chorus]
[repeat bridge two]
[repeat chorus]
