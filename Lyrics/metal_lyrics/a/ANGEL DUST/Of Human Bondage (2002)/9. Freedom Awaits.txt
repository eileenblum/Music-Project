Listen - did you hear that voice from inside ourselves
It's echoeing the weariness that's hunting us
It's getting dark we both can see
Pathetic words won't rescue me
Love is just another word for grief

We are drowning in the tears once fallen
Why don't the shadows disappear?

Please awake you holy one
Please awake 'cause freedom awaits
Now awake my only one
Please awake 'cause freedom awaits

It's useless to love the one I hurt so deep
Can you feel the slowing down of time?
One word could even make you cry
One single touch could make you die
You must know I never could resist

[repeat bridge]
[repeat chorus]
