Don't speak...
Of the silence that falls on the future
I won't say - but I believe there is something in my mind 
It's hard to expect there will be no surprises
Don't feel - there's a sign of what's coming - we divide

Keep us together
Don't silence our souls
In this dread - ripped apart again

You know my aim is for you to be my last resort
Don't heed the empty mindless call
I don't feel hatred towards you
This is my last remorse
Here comes the ending
Unite - in the mystic world
Unite - in the mystic world
Unite - and overcome

Don't say that the cries of tomorrow are silenced
Don't think like we will be living in ecstasy

[repeat bridge]
[repeat chorus]
[repeat bridge]

Don't feel my agony now
This is my last real hope
Don't heed the empty mindless call
I don't feel hatred towards you
This is my last remorse
Here comes the ending
Unite - in the mystic world
Unite - in the mystic world
Unite and overcome
