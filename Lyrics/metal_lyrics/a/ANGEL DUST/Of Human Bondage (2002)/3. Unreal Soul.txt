Starlight shines in another world 
Spent my life in a dark dismay
It starts with you for what it's worth
Can't speak your name, or I go insane

In another world - back to my soul
I know there's nothing here, oh yeah

Seems I'm back in a loveless world
Can't understand what it's worth
Step outside the lifeless game
I've never understood what it says

In the fucking world blacks out my soul
I know there's nothing real - oh

There's nobody else who gives this to me
'Cause whoever said my soul would heal?
There's no one who shares in my whole misery
For who will say my soul is real?

I step outside this fucking cage
New forms of life cry out and rage
I feel flying back the loveless fear
To check and see my soul is real

[repeat bridge one]
[repeat chorus]
[repeat bridge one]
[repeat chorus]

There's no one who shares in this whole mystery
'Cause whoever said my soul was real?
I laugh out but now of the whole misery
'Cause who will save my soul, it's real
