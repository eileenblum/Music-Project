With might the forceful makers build
Machines that will take control
Inhuman - They use us to
build and to guide them
We turn our backs and we'll lose it all

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye
You tried and you tried
You lied and you left me here for so long
Don't say farewell
When you go to hell
You're a machine and you will never die

Inhuman - They are taking over

And they will always be
Wind up men controlling us
Manifesto humanity
