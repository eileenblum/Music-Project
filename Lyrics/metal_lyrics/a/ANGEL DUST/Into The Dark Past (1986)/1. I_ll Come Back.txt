Iâve been working hard, working hard up to now
But now you kick my ass
Put me down, on the street
Iâm sleeping on the sidewalk
Got no food for tomorrow
And if I stole an apple
Iâd be damned in your eyes
But Iâll come back
Some day, one day
Got to debt to pay
Iâll come back
Donât look around
Some day, one day
Iâll be standing there
When Iâm back
Iâve bled my hands to repair your big car
Working night and day
To make your ship and your steel
You said Iâm no one without your help
Iâll show you soon
That Iâm not your fool
Youâre down on me
Screwed my brain, till it hurt
You broke my soul, âcause I needed a job
But you must realize you drove me insane
You canât go this way any longer anymore
