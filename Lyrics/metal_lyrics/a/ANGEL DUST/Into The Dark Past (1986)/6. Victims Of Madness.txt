He comes out from nowhere
To seize power for himself
He knows how to seize the might
Enough power to start the fight
Itâs exactly the right time
To realize his plans
Plans for another world war
Now he sees his chance
Madness â he is totally insane
Madness â the only word to describe this man
Madness â only few know what heâs gonna do
Madness â but its too late
No one can stop him on his way to the top
Not many foresee the disaster
But their hands â are bound
And their mouths â have been shut
By the legions of all around
Weâre all going to be
Victims of Madness
Victims of Madness again
Madness â again thereâll be total war
Madness â death in the atomic roar
Millions â destroyed in a senseless war
Millions â crippled by a degrading life
He comes out upon us from the void
To seize the power to himself
He knows the way to occupy the might
Enough power to start a global fight
Heâs promising heaven but heâs planning hell
His promising visions, put them all under spell
Marching for Revenge
You never asked me if I wanted to be born
And now you tell me how I ought to live
Right from the start you had your plan
Had it all planned from the beginning to the end
I must do what you demand from me
You give me (the) orders â and I have to obey
But it canât go on that fucking way
Time has come for me to break the chains
