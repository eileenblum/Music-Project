To bring it to an end
Fighting for my rights
Fighting to cut my ties
Itâs time to start my life anew
I have my own schemes I donât need your rules
Unlimited freedom will never exist
But after your patter I donât wanna live
I must do what you demand from me
You give me (the) orders â and I have to obey
(But) Iâm not the only one who hates to live that way
Time has come for us to break the chains
Marching for revenge
To bring it to an end
Fighting for our rights
Fighting to cut our ties
I donât wanna live without a future and aim
I make my own rules just for my own game
I donât care what you think about this
Itâs just my own game I donât wanna miss
