Fighting my fight to survive
Iâll never compromise
Iâll take your lives
You better get out of my way
Iâll go through hell
Iâll fight till the end
Iâm ready to strike
Iâll make you run
Youâll run for your life
But you cannot hide
This is the fighters return
Cities will burn
Watch out
Iâll be bullet in your heads
You cannot provoke me any longer
You screwed me up, now expect my revenge
You brought that shit upon you
Iâm your executioner
And my wrath will be my gun
Iâll make no prisoners
I will make you run
I asked for your help
But you pushed me back
I needed your love
You offered me hate
Iâm only defending my life
You want to destroy me forever
