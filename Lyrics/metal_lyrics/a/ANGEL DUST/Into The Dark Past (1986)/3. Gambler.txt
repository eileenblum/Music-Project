Heâs just a gambler
Like everybody, too
He plays in smoky backrooms
He plays the odds like you
All he trusts is luck
His only guarantee
He gambler till the end
He looses more than he will ever win
(He plays like you like me)
GAMBLER â youâre playing with fire
GAMBLER â itâs a cheaters liar
GAMBLER â you stake all you got
GAMBLER â this game is too hot
This game is too hot
Win
Lose
Inside &amp; cage
Win
Loose
Youâll win no gain
The trick of a card
You hold in your hand
May blind your eyes
When you have an ace
Then you need a spade
Donât play with fire
