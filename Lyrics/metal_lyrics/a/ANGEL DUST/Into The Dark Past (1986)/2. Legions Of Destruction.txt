It must happened in another time
In another place called âFAARâ
The sky was red and cloudless
Darkness blocked out the stars
It was a time of pain and death
When only the bad did survive
When you had, what you possessed
Was a weapon and your life
Just a few were strong enough
To play the deadly game
Against the legions of death
The legions of destruction
It must happened in another time
In another place called âFAARâ
A bloody tyrant
Leads the fates of âFAARâ
The legions obey his command
To spread his reign of terror
Up and down the land
At the risk of their lives
Hit and run in the night
At the risk of their lives
Sworn to die, kill and fight
