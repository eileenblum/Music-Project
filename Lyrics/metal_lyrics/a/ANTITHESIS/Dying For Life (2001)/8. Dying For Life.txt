The soul lives on beyond this life will you ascend into the light
Or be consumed by nothingness
Or cast into the black
For as above is so below and only one will take your soul

I've been to the grave
I've seen my life end
Of my own free will
Death by my own hand my blood has been shed

My soul has been damned
My spirit condemned
My sin I repent

With broken heart and broken mind
I took my life before its time
For one must die to rest in peace
I tried to put my mind at ease
I never thought my suffering would last for all eternity

The soul lives on beyond this life will you ascend into the light
Or be consumed by nothingness
Or feel the flames of hell fire

I've traveled afar to the ends of the earth
I watch from afar, in shadows I lurk

For every death, a life is born
A soul is sent, a soul returns
My life on earth a living hell
A pain I know too much, too well

My mortal soul is in despair
A punishment I cannot bear
Forsaken by God, exiled to the land of lost souls
Into the unknown, tortured spirit in limbo, I roam

Almighty God! All merciful, please hear my cry
He listens not, my plea for forgiveness denied
Thou hast been given life
Thou shalt not taketh away!

My absence of faith
My wings will not fly
My soul will not rest

A paradise awaits the saved the promise kept to thee of faith
Lived by the word, receive the son
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done
Deliverance, divine wings of rapture rejoice

The angels fly to the light
They're guided by voice
I'm left behind in anguish
I mourn my own death

Forevermore,
Unborn dying again
And again, dying again, dying for eternal life
