Today is the day we go our separate way
No longer will I carry twice the weight
It's time to cut you loose

You won't drag me down this time
Misery loves company
Your invitation I decline
I watch you sink in the quicksand
But you refuse to extend your hand

You've been crying wolf for years
Now I see the wolf is you
Am I a victim or a volunteer
You prey on me, still I pray for you

Some people never change
I don't believe you will
I don't intend to wait
For snow to fall in hell

You took my charity for granted you took advantage of my trust
I guess I should've seen it coming
I let my guard down and you struck

Forget you ever knew my name
Ask this of me and I will do the same

There's nothing more to say
Your silence says it all
You best be on your way
Just remember not to call

And remember to forget the brother you never had
I am not my brother's keeper!
