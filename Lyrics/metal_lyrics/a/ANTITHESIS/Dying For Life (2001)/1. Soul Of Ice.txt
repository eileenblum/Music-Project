Sorcerer, blind me with your eyes
Deny me, cast me aside
Mine is vengeance, now I see
Unleash the killer within me
Dark clouds come rolling in
My mind is scarred with your sin

Show me what your tarot holds
Your ending now unfolds
Look what your future holds for you
Do what the demons tell me to do
Extinguish all power to be free
Remove the shadow cast over me

See the moon turning black
For me there is no turning back
No magic left to succumb
My final quest has begun
Tomorrow seems eternally still
To the years that pass me by

I've seen visions of my past life
And the wreckage left behind
Now I stare lost into the mirror
Tearing questions from my mind
No one is there for me to turn to

My hands held up to the sky
Asylum my only friend
The night turns without end
No tears left to cry
I am a soul of ice
