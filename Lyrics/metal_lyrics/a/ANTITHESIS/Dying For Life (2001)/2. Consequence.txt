Random acts of cruelty
Victims lying in the wake
Friend or foe it makes no difference
You are always on the take

Act without reason, the choice you have made
Thinking only of yourself
You take chances without regard
Clueless of the cards you have dealt

Acts of dissension, malicious intent
As long as you get what you're after
You have no fear of retaliation
Here in the now or here after
I am but one of those you have hurt
All that I hear is your laughter

I see you there, you do not care
Walking the tightrope of life
With no safety net
Living your life as a fool
So take what you can get

It's all consequence
It only makes sense
To reap what you sow
It's all just a show

Look beyond the facade
And take one look at me
The world does not revolve around you
I'm not here to serve your needs

But you can't accept the truth
You're not invisible
In the shadow of a doubt
Build a fence around the wall

I see you there, I do not care!

It's all consequence
It only makes sense
To reap what you sow
It's all just a show
