When you wake up in the morning
Can you tell me what you see
A gentle flowing river
Or a stormy troubled sea

In this life you will find
Tests and trials and despair
If your faith is strong
you'll know where to cast your cares

Hold your head up high, not with pride or arrogance
Be glad to know you got another chance

I know the pain that's in your life
Been down that road before
Just when things were going right
Fate had a twist in store

Two roads I must travel on
One life for another death
One voice whispered in my ear
Don't you give up just yet

On a trail of tears, I have to face my fears
Unlike the other one, left life with his own gun

Just what went through his mind
That peace he'll never find
How do I carry on, now that my brother is gone?

My life flashed before my eyes
When I was twenty-five
When I thought this could be the end
I fought to stay alive

I was indestructible
I lived an ideal life
But things change for better or for worse
Each life a gift divine

From the lessons learned and the bridges I have burned
I have found but one true friend
Who will stand by me through times of complexity
And help me through the times of trial

When I look in a mirror I can tell you who I see
A man with new beginnings
Living out his destiny

I am here with you in spirit
I will never leave your side
I'll be right here if you need me
Take my hand and walk with me

All the while these are times of trial
Carry onward through the darkest miles
