I know you better than you think
I know a lot about your past
And why you wear a mask

You may deceive with your disguise
And you may buy yourself some time
Until the end of time

To yourself, your reflection tells a lie
Look inside, there's a dark side that you hide
I make my presence felt
I will not be ignored

Just like an open sore
I help to hurt it more

I am the wound that will not heal
I am the secret you conceal
I am the truth you can't reveal

You thought I might forget
Vanish without a trace
Just when you least expect then I will show my face

I am the witness to the crime
I am the track you left behind
I am the setback in your plans
I am the blood upon your hands

You tried to bury me
But I came back to life
Now you must carry me
Until the day you die
Until you die

I am the bed in which you sleep
I am forever yours to keep
