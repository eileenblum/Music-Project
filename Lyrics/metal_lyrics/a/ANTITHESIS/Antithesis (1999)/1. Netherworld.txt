Tossing, turning, restless
Can not sleep
Drenched in perspiration
Dampened sheets
Nestled in nocturnal darkness lay
Reeling, my subconscious
Mind at play

Drifting, fading, falling
Losing grasp
Clinching, gritting, grinding
Teeth I gnash
Astroplaning dreamscapes
I survey
Out of body, spirit floats away
Half asleep, half awake
Upon the edge of twilight
Past the gate, past the maze
Guided by your mind's eye

Exit the realm of reality
Opening the doors of perception
Through the corridors
Of the labyrinth
Enter the limbic void

Drawn to moaning voices
Calling out my name
I walk into a room
I thought from which they came
Bodies wrapped in orgies
Writhe in mortal lust
Sculptured figures made of flesh
Turn into dust

Right before my eyes
Changed the scenery
As the floor falls out
From beneath me
Sucked through a hole to an infinity
Into the vast unknown

Tormented cries of those
Cast into the abyss
The screams descend
And hallow in eternal pitch
The vacuum vortex
Swallows souls
In swirling stew
Into the belly of
Leviathan they spew-
That's when I woke up
