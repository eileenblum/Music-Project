Etched in marble, scarred in memory
Meet thy maker be thy judge
Life so precious you have taken
God have mercy on thy soul

Death, the doorway to a new life
Passing through the tunnels' light
At the end a soul is weeping
Heaven's gates have been denied

Damn thy soul to roam in limbo
Sins upon thy shoulders weighed
Exiled angels fall from grace
With fractured wings aflame

In this realm there are no boundaries
Step beyond into unknown
Live as shadow, one with darkness
Walk among the wailing souls

To take thy own life, the ultimate sin
Death is no escape, a new life begins

Thou art Godforsaken, thou must seek forgiveness
Merciful thy judgement, so it shall be done
For one thousand years, thou must seek redemption
As an apparition, stuck between dimensions

In limbo, to roam in spirit
A shadow, at one with darkness
