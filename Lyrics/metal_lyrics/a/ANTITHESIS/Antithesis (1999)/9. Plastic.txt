Who are you to judge like you're a some kind of saint
I tell it like it is, you tell it like it ain't
I go by what I know, you go by what you hear
Preach your hypocrisy to someone else's ear
You make me laugh how you perform for your peers
I'm not amused, your acting bores me to tears

You sit on your throne, your flock, merely clones
Deemed king for a day, a self proclaimed savior
Upon your pedestal high

You symbolize all I despise, you and your kind
You represent all I resent, your state of mind
You symbolize all I despise, you perpetrate
You represent all I resent, you are a fake

Contradictions, insert foot in mouth, the truth is out
You truly believe that no one perceives you to be
A deceiver you are

Open your eyes, you haven't got a clue
Behind your back, your peers are mocking you

Look around you, who can you trust - no one
Cover is blown

Judas and Brutus are waiting in line...
With daggers behind their backs
