Shadows hug the walls
Embracing
Whispering, breathing
On my face

Tell me of forbidden dreams
Help me help you
Make them true confessions
Shared
Let me know my secret's safe with you

Speechless, only body language
Translates our emotions
Understand

Lying, here beside you
Undressed feelings exposed
Are now expressed

Tell me all of your desires
Tell me yours are mine to keep
Lighting secret fires
Moans in morning hours
Know not sleep

Trusting, exchanging vows
Two liars chancing
We commit ourselves in lust

Knowing, soon the dawn
Will end our evening
We will count the hours
We have spent
Lighting secret fires
