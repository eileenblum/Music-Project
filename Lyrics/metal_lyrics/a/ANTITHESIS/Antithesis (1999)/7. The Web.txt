Welcome to my parlor, with a gesture
I am lured inside
Bitten I am helpless as the poison cripples my mind
A worthy specimen chosen to be the mate
She straddles over me and offers me the bait

Caught in her web, as she consumes my head
Caught in her web, her appetite is fed

Hunger, she devours, her desire overpowers me
Stuck in disposition, I'm defenseless, I feel her sting
As she seduces me I'm kept immobilized
Bound in the ecstasy of what I fantasized

Caught in her web, as she consumes my head
Caught in her web, her appetite is fed

She wraps her legs around me
As she contorts her body
With all my strength I fight her
Constricting even tighter

I struggle, she laughs
I can't escape her grasp
I cannot endure another minute more

Mistress, dominatrix, is her fetish
Just a fatal wish
Torture gives her pleasure
She abuses from experience
Her mating ritual has merely just begun
Another victim lured, another web is spun
