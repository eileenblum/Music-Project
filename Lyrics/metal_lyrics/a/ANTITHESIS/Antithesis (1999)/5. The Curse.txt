I rest here on this pillar
I am a granite king
And you will bow and worship
My praises you will sing

My immortality
The reign goes on forever
The valley of the kings
Dare you to take my treasure

You dare invade my chamber
Inside a curse awaits
Unearth my sepulture
And you just sealed your fate

Mere mortals can you hear me
I do not want you here
I warn you do not trespass
In you I strike with fear

You start the excavation
Grave robbers at first light
The glint of gold is blinding
To take it only right

My patience now is ending
You now fall one by one
And few will be left standing
So shall my wrath be done

The boy king now is laughing
You fell into his trap
You risk your life for fortune
In death no turning back

You were a flesh and blood king
Like any mortal man
Your curse is just a mind game
You had no master plan

Ashes to dust you are, your spirit lost forever
Sarcophagus of gold
Remains of earthly pleasure

I leave you with this question
It's time that you decide
Was the curse for real?
Or just a curse of the mind?
