I'm stupid, impotent
My feelings aren't important
I'm useless, worthless
Nobody, good for nothing
We argue so often
I guess I'm good for something

Chew me out
Bite my head off
Spit it out

Take it out on me
Set your demons free
Wounded verbally
Scarred internally

Words can wound
Words can scar
Words of war
Words are swords

Accuse me, it's my fault
I'm injured by your insult
Intending, offending
It's clear, I'm comprehending
The more I ignore you
The more you push the issue

Bite my lip
Shout your mouth off
Bite your tongue

Take it out on me
Set your demons free
Wound me verbally
Scar me mentally

All I do you criticize
You refuse to compromise

What's your point? Do you know?
Cut me down, that's your goal

Change the subject
Must we linger on this topic
You won't reason
I am finished
Wasting my breath

Everything is a debate
Simple things you complicate

Words can wound
Words can scar
Words of war
Words are swords
