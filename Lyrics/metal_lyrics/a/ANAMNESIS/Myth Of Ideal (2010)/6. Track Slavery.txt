Scars of yesterday
Shows your past today

Everyone could judge you
You wash them away
Every voice could kill you
It's like your last day

You need salvation
With its flame and love
Give us new belief
Without fake and lust
Screens are going blank
Emptiness inside
want to fill it
With its magic light

Could you show your face?
What are you afraid?
Taking off this masks
Brings you only pain?
Could you show your face?
What are you afraid?
Taking off this mask
Brings you only pain?
