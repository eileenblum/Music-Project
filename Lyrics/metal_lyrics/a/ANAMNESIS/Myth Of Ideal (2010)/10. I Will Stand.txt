I will stand!
I'm not broken!
Your words
hadn't demolished me!
You made rules
in this game!
But you couldn't see

That you've
lost the sound
That you've
lost the ground

I will stand!
I'm not broken!
I'm not a pawn for you!
You could shoot me!
I will be alive!
You could crash me!
I will be alive!

I'm real
Made of flesh and blood
What's with you?
Only dark thoughts

See me dying
Standing on my knees
But I won't lose
I've got the soul in me

You could burn my home
You could kill the life
But we won't lose
We will stand!

I will stand!
For the victory!
For the innocence!
For the life!

Save it together!
Army of alive!
For the innocence!
For the life!

No more ignorence!
No more lies!
For the innocence!
For the life!
