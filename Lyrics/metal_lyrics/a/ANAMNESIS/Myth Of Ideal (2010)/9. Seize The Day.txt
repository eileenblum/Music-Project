"Seize the day" only pray
Blow these words to the air
never change your way

But in the kingdom of deaf
Blind one on the throne
I'm the man who can see
Through the flame of stars

I'll try to make a step
On this road of fire
No remorse and regret
For those one
Who sold our souls

My heart can always find the way to break the walls
To find my own mind in the crowd of different souls

Bullet, find the truth
Bullet, stop it now
I'm full with the fury
Death for everyone
And I stay between
This routine and live
Could I find the exit?
Could I stay alive?

"Seize the day" only pray
Blow these words to the air
never change your way.
