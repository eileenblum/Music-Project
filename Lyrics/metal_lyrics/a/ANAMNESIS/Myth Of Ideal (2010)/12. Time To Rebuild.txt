Keep your eyes on destruction
This world is falling everyday
And it's coming between us
I feel the bitterness inside

Time to rebuild
This world for me ... and you
It's time to be together
For me and you

The storm can bring us freedom
And vanish all the chains of fear
I'm not alone I know that
It helps me in the world rebuilding

Time to rebuild
This world for me ... and you
It's time to be together
For me and you.
