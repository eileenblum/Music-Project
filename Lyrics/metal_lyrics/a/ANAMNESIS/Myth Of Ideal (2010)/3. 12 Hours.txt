12 hours before
Before you see this place
And the other side
12 hours before
Before you reach the place
And the other side
12 hours before

Equality at the begging
Couldn't save its face up to the end
To risk while you're alone
Looks like a glory step
So when you're not alone
The fate could split your thoughts
And you'll never know your future choice

For one it gives a life
And for the other- death
For one it gives a life
And for the other- death

While you make your choice
You're one in charge.
You keep everything under control.
Everyone plays this game
And you could lose,
So it's gonna be your last 12 hours.

12 hours before
Before you see this place
And the other side
12 hours before
Before you reach the place
And the other side

So you loose, and it will be your last
12 hours.

You don't respect and analyze
The other way of mind
So if you chose being on the top
Hatred's your epitaph
Equality at the begging
Couldn't save its face up to the end
Your own mistake could crash one's life
And make you blind and deaf.
