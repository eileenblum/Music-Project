My mind flows to the past
I see the birth of the sky
I'm reflected to it
But there's something
That could destroy
Sunrise in your eyes
I want to feel free
And stop wasting time

On contemplation of the end
I'm still lulled 
But hope to wake up
From that liturgical dream

Lift your mind 
To see the blessings
Drive your own way
You'll see who 
You used to be
Don't left me here

Don't left for dead
We could survive
I'm not homeless
While I love you
Blood runs through me
And makes me feel alive

Every breath's for you

I'm reflected to it
But there's something
That could destroy
Sunrise in your eyes.
