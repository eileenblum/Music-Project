There's no hope to behold and survive
Don't believe anymore, lose it right now
You're in chains, enchained by abyss depth
It's only the beginning, but you're in the end

Damnation of the days
Presses your chest
You're breathless
You're breathless
You're seeking for the exit
And you know about the door
Damnation of the days
Damnation of the days

But you're ready to make a step and win
You can unlock this door
And turn everything back

Time of damnation,
makes people blind from fake temptation,
and we must fight that stagnation

And got to find a belief

And everything again Will be full with light of love
You'll inspire the abyss With the sense
And all the broken wings Are full of strength to fly
And the crushed throat Can sing again

It won't come back
Nothing to offer, anyway
No death, no lies, no pain
Only glory

Time of damnation,
makes people blind from fake temptation,
and we must fight that stagnation

And got to find a belief.
