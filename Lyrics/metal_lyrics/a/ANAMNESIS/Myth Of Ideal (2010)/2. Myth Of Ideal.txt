Brand new world
full of love and illusions
Under the gun
One wrong choice
for two charmed people
And they've got no time
It was my decision
to change the path
And your strength
was turned against
Now she's caught
by the death

It's just a myth of ideal
Which I can't reanimate anymore
Your usual sweetness and sensuality
Were taken by the second dose
Your coldness stops
Stream of my dreams
I'm fulfilled with the fears..
And I've got no time
It was my decision
to change the path
And your strength
was turned against
Now she's caught
by the death

Finally, take my hand...

Your fate is mine,
And you know-
It is not the end
We aren't lost...
