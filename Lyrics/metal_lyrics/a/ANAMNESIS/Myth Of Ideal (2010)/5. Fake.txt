Caught the plague
The terrible leprosy
The city became strange
It's black and skanky
Violence is the only way
To wrest a life from evil's jaws

The city's groaning
And dying day by day
Streets are full of murders
Thieves of heart and soul
They don't feel anything

Death on the canines' edge
Is a dream of everyone
Remained in that place
Those who are alive ... alive

I'm locked here alone
In the trembling and hollow
Hiding in the depth
Of my mind
Nailed to a cot
With the ropes of fear
These beasts' whisper
Is sinking me down

They've already come
They're among us

I'd like to run away
But I'm still locked

Stop!
It's changed now!
Was it fake?
Was there only my dream?

Stop!
It's changed now!
It's a fake?
It was only my dream?
