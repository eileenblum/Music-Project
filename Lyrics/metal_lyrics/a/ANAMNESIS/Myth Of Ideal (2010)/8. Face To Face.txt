Today isn't yesterday
Every second got its heart
Every whisper got its sense
Stop hurrying now

Just hold a second in your hand
It'll brighten your way
The bell tolled for heroes
And you're moving again

But something's happened
Your eyes are engorging
Face to face with your fate
You couldn't keep your anger
In that silent cage
You're not a part of this crowd

Don't feel yourself
Like a grey cloud
Your heart is a fire
And your thoughts are bright

But please don't shoot
Think of peace and life
You can kill with words
You can cure by mind
Every day got its sense
Everyone got its heart

Just hold a second in your hand
It'll brighten your way
The bell tolled for heroes
And you're moving again

But something's happened
Your eyes are engorging
Face to face with your fate
You couldn't keep your anger
In that silent cage
You're not a part of this crowd.
