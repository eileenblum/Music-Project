Pitiful humanityDestroying rights and natureEmbraced by insanityTortured by the fear of deathInside their soulsDiscriminationThey'll pay for their cowardiceThey'll see our might Damage in the airThirst for destructionSentenced to see their livesIn our mighty evil handsInside their soulsDiscriminationThey'll pay for their cowardiceThey'll see our might Circle in FlamesInside the cowards willBurn until their bones will meltCircle in FlamesThe time is coming forSweeping all the ignorants In the darkest parts of the universeWhere the purity has no place to beEvil civilizationsHave spread their stink on earthRuining their motherlandSearching for dominationPolitical manipulationsCreating dogmas to kill our freedom Fall from the throneThis place is no more for youBastard, fanatical product
