Sons of the lostKingdom of fireTurningto dustLaunching it higherFighting for those who will rise up withinThesign of the sun is wisdom and hate  Disordered nations Embraced the lightsof hell The legions of the lordsServing evil forcesEnslaved and purified Destroying those who failedTo see their powerIn their worstnightmares Fallen angel horned  Pentacle is burningDevouring all theblindThe king is rising To take his revengeEnslaved and purified Destroying those who failedTo see their power
