Inside our sensesInner perceptionBlinding our minds to unmask realitySource of damnationReligious poisonDestiny of mankindThat turned our future to dust Gods of the pastI invoke the secrets unveiledShow me your sacred, strong evil insideI will sacrifice my soul to the oriental wind I saw the past in the gleam of the light Shadows of the gods that brought knowledge to our kindInsanity brought to our time Instead of greatness and might Ancestral signs in our mindUnconscious souls, we are lost in the dustWe are lost  I saw the past in the gleam of the light Shadows of the gods that brought knowledge to our kindFalling from the stars Launching fire in the sky I drink the blood of the almighty oneI feel the power of the angel insidePraying to be the chosen oneWho will bring light to my kind
