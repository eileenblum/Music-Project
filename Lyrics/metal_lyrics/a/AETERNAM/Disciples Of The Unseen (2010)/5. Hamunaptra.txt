Approaching the final raysOpen the book of the deadYou'll see the truthShining in the sarcophagus of thy lordImothepBringer of disastersI invoke the beastThat sleeps in the depth of tombs HamunaptraThe sacrifice is yoursKingdom of deathI scream the incantations I am the force that sleptThree thousand years in the darknessAnd spilled the blood of the impureI am the force that sawYour decadence haunting your lifeTill the poisoned blood was shed The sacrifice is nowI open her chest and read the incantationsAnubis, god of all godsArt thou hearing meWake the dead from sleep
