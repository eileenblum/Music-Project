Adam said:

In the garden of
Eden
I call you at my side 
Before death can takes me
Get the seeds from the
tree of life

Back to the gates, down his father 
Who by this time has died

Before he covered him with dirt
And placed the seeds of life 

Nailed to
the cross of life 
The lies had been thrown into the light 
Golgotha, save us
from 
Mortality and spread your power 

The mighty Massra tells 
That Seth
became the lord of the night 
He rapes the good and he lets 
His legions fall
upon the earth

كائنات النار في أوج القوة
يقطع رأس العبيد
