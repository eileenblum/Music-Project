Ancient lord of the
sun
Who rules the sands of time
Witnessed the glorious era of Akhenaten

Behind his wisdom 
The beauty has risen
Upon the lands 
With the reign of
Nefertiti

Beyond her eyes 
Was born the power   
Within her heart
The
virtue of Massra
The perfect one arised

Her gaze is like the wind
Burst of
eternal life
A vision
Haunting the dreams of thousands 
Her skin is like the
sand
Shinning as day but cold as night
She is all men's worse sin

Dark
mother of all civilizations 
Embrace my soul and let me die in your heart
