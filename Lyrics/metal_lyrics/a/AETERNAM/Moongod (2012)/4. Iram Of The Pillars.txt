I see you in the glance of the water
I feel you, enchanted queen of the sand
My life is a jewel for you
I lost my sight
And my speaking
Alone in the desert I'm wasted and seeking salvation

Howling into the land of dreams
The temple of sins of the ancient Djinns
Riding the horse of the Sarasins
Ascending the seas of Arabian kings

I hear you from the edge of the tower
I praise you : "Lord of Sheba'ha, appear!"
And send me to the kingdom of souls
I had lost my sight
And my speaking
Alone in the desert I'm reaching my illumination
