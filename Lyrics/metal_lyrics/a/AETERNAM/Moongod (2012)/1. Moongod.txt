Progenies of the holy tribe
Governors of the horizon
Prophecies has now revealed
The coming of the almighty savior
Invading the lands of the infidels
Spreading the word of their lord
Assimilating all their heritage
Destroying all their holy idols

Disciples of the lunar kingdom

Warriors of thy liberty
Their devotion is greater than their beliefs
Fear is not a part of their daily battle
The Lord is guiding their fate
Defying the hordes of the sun
Lighting the fire on the world
Launching their terror, butchering the nations
Their only god Allah remains

Crawling on the lands
This falling kingdom of God is becoming the sands
Of this barren desert that witnessed the birth
Of your own loss

Extoler of Arabian deities
Behold the demise of your lineage
Deliver your kind from this enchaining grave
And rise from the ruins of history
Illusion of God is no more
The era of slavery has come to end
The essence of man is the only path to reach
The ultimate illumination
