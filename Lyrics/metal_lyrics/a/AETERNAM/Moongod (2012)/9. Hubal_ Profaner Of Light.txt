Chaos is devastating all the nations
This is the aeon of loss
The impostor prophet is now believed
Forsaken idols, overwhelmed
Sons of IsmaÃ«l
Heaven has chosen for thy
The moon you will worship now
The only god of Arabic tribes

Allah! Sinister deity
I will defy every verse
And defy every word you spoke

Sabean Moongod's legacy
Enslaving spirituality
This old Arabian poetry
Is archaic obsolete fantasy

People of Arabia, those who crossed the sands
Your fate has been torn from history of man
The blast of Israfil, the fear of your existence
Is now reduced to nil
Now expend!

Demise of an ideology
Unveiling the clarity of the lie
The infectious poison expelled from our bodies and our minds
The fallen idol of the moon is scattered before their eyes
Liberating hordes of chaos from their slumber

Hubal! Profaner of Light
Hubal! Devourer of Sunlight

The end of an era is coming
The spheres of the sky ignited by
Communion with spirits of ancient civilizations
O sons of Jahilia ascending from the stellar race
Destroy the pillars of the Moongod's empire

He is the chosen one
Brighter than the sun
Fallen before the dawn of oblivion
