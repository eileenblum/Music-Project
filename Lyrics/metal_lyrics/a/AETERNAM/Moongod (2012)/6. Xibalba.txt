I saw the hordes of stars
Praying to cross the borders of life
Afraid of the dreadful faces of the gods of Metnal
I saw the horror of being sacrificed for Kukulkan
And penetrate into dark rifts of fear

I served my bloody heart on a plate of gold
For the sake of saving my damned world

A thousand corpses upon the lighted serpent
Collapsing on the tainted stairs of Hun-Came
Reptilian eyes, igniting the offered flesh
To the blood thirsty sphere of the sky
Dissected bodies, stacked beneath the temple
Ritually drowned in a lake of blood
Heads of the sacrificed
Open the gates of Xibalba!

I witnessed the rites intended to satisfy the gods
Beheading and disemboweling of thousand painted slaves
My destiny was written on the scribes of Palenque, enlightening me
To the gory carnage that awaited my flesh

I feel the blade
Getting through my heart
The end is now!
