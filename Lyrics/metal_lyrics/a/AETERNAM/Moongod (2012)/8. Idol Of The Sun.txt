Holding the Chakra, the Conch and the Mace
The god of the dusk is now devoid of grace
His arms and hairs of gold are bursting in fire

The sky is illuminated
Descent of Äditya is coming
The son of KaÅyapa came down to punish

Surya! Idol of the sun
Chariots of seven horses rise
Surya! Idol of the sun
Enflaming the emptiness

Mithra, solar deity of chaos
I am contemplating the sacred Gayatri Mantra
Release your fury on who disbelieve

Destiny of the rising sun
Crucified as a thousand of slaves

Son of Osiris
Unveil the scorn of Jesus Christ
