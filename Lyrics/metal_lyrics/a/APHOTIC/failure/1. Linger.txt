I don't want to leave
You can't make me go
I won't let you grieve
Your stomach sink so low
I won't ever leave
You can't make me go
Pinacoline soaked permeated illusion
Rapacious twitchy repentant delusion
Break me into
Whatever you want to
Throw me to the wind
I will reform again
Do it, do it again and again without end
Blowing in the wind, fluttering down, close the lid
