Spotted eyes searching
Twisted minds contriving
Berampyre your thinking
Or fall like the procacious
With your back against the wall
YOu have so far to fall
Grasping at the dead air
Fight overwhelming viciousness
Turbulent and unfair
You struggle and lose consciousness
Your sterile seed is spread
They are the living dead
Pendulate the water
Bashing against the cleft
Cling to your life force
As it's beaten away slowly
