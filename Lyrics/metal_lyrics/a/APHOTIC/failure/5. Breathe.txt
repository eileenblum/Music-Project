Wait to breathe
I want to see
If you'll wait for me
Under the dying tree
Break
I want to see you break
Succumb
I want you to succcumb
Fake
How could you be so fake
Breath
Nowhere to take it from
Dumb
How could you be so dumb
Struggle for your life
Why won't you let go
I will twist the knife
And watch your blood flow
Don't it feel good
Yes I knew you would
Look into my eyes
Never thought I could
