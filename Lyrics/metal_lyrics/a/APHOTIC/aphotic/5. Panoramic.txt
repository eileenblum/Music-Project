Being as
An amber film I float
Light is
Dimmer as I settle
Like a fragile star
Eclipsed by a black hole
Percept, guard, clung, wavering in the breeze
Suspect, angelic, like a leaf through trees
Shadow, protect from failed dreams and impurities
Intranquilyzing energies surround
By coincedence or fate, her I found
My power to sterilize
Angelic mind tranquilize
Crystal clear to realize
Joined, our gazing eyes
Not to be
I, I must purify
Ascending
Away, I will return
