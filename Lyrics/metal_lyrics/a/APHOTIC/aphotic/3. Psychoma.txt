Entranced in irreversible thought
Believe in reality, I will not
Trained and taught
Blamed and crucified
Residual night time visual
Unclear sight strained
Irritate the ember of perception
Gravitate the physical gas
Leviate the twirling twisting storm
Cold, the melancholy envelopes all
Hot, the anger turns to a fleeting thought
Drain of thought
Psychoma tried
Conquer the waves of sight
Crush the day of light
