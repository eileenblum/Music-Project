Mold is growing in bluish form
Textured and grained to opposite flow
The hair like surface adorn
Like tines to oppress the down like show

Tear away the sky type felt
Light as a feather, not even an ounce
To look inside one falls to swelt
The rays inside to pummel and trounce

To peel and peel would be of no use
The source is abundant and ready to fuel
The spores together are quite loose
To break the bond before they rule

Stripnomelane effects are born
When charred and singed from above and below
The now rocky surface will soon be worn
For the hair like surface to adorn and grow
