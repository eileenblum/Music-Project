Everyone wants to be me
My reality no one should see
So I will remain unclear
Strained under weight that a mind will bear
Unrelenting clutter in my mind
Clarity so hard to find
So inside of here I'll stay
Till I'm rendered trapped one day
In this anesthetized maze I am to be
Stay away, don't come after me
Or my reality you will see
Locked in nowhere under this glazed stare
Mystified in terror, how will you fare?
No, I don't need you
Feeble pity
In my reality
I'll set you free
Free me...
