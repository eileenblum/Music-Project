Mighty weight I feel
Pressure is relieved
One I will kill
The one I deceived
Existence now in hindsight
Embrace forevermore
Blackened tear
No more fear
Under veil of dark
Up upon my throne
Next departure not known
Like an endless cloud
Blown across a grey sky
The depressed have no light
Smthered and extinguished
Feeble emotions reek
Of sight or by eternal light
To others this grim horror
This welcome scene of gore
Empty all is in eternity
With worthlessness this life bore
