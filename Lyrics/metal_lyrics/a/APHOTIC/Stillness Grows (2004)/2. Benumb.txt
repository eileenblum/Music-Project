Dim voice drifts void limb trim tried
Otalgia I hear
When you are near
Blind I see
When you're next to me
Benumb I feel
Gone, it is you that steal

Myopic it is when I leer
Despondaent it is when I peer
Dead it is, I you will fear

You float around my head
I cannot think straight
Straight
Let the hammer down
Smoke is rising now
You wait
Falling down to the ground
A lifeless mound
You I love and hate
I hate
