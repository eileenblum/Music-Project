Beyond the darkest horizon
My fears will gone forever
Where truth is hiding
Where fears are our dreams

Where the light is

Beyond the darkest horizon
Is hidden my past
Where remains silent
The ruins of my dreams

Someone told me to fear the dark
Where the evil there lives

Darkness join me
In my darkest dreams

Beyond the darkest horizon
Where I had learned to fear
Is forbidden knowledge
Now I look there with no fear

Beyond the darkest horizon
I feel safe from there fake light!
