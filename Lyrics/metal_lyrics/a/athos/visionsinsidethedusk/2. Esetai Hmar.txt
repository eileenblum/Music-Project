Hail Hail...
Voices from a fade past
whispering under the earth
As the sky becomes darker
as they come and reveal
Their flag is  proudly risen up the sky
Feeling the wind of war
I hear their voices Esetai Hmar...
Now that the sky turned black
and their spears are
reflecting into the dark
Singing the song of the war
as from Hades are rising more
Their silent faces seem thirsty for blood
Their sword on guard  with look that spits fire
Athena bless us with your wisdom,
Poseidon make the earth to tremble again
Ares engage my hand  give me the power
Zeus father of all Gods we raise our banners
The Banners of our war
Now they hit their spears
on their shields As they attack
Killing the fake king
Burning the symbol of lies the Jewish cross
Destroying the temples of misery
And the old symbols are rising again
Proud in the sky With one voice
I can hear them  Esetai Hmar
