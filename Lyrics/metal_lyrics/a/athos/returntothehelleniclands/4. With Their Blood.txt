Olympian Gods mercy on us
Listen the voice of your children
Guide the path to the eternity
Find your way back

Olympian Gods mercy on us
Mighty Zeus drop your thunder
Poseidon calm your wrath
Forgive your children

Show me the glory of your wisdom
Lead me to the path of Erebus
Your glory will shine again
For all they did we'll make them
to pay With Their Blood
