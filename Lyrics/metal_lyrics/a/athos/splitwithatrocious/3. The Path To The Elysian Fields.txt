Mystic the paths for the elysian fields the place where all heroes meet
The place that heroes took their reward after life

Psahno ton dromo ton eonio mesa apo to vasilio ton skion

Iahes ton hroon psithiroi psihon se kaloun na vretheis sta elysia pedia

But the path is so hard you must listen the voice of your blood

To aima pou kila zesto se odigei stin alitheia pou den gnorises pote

Now you hear clear the voice of your blood

Listen to its voice its your ancestors call
To the elysian fields

Listen and follow their path!
The path to the elysian fields!
