An eagle breaks through duskclouds and haze
appears on the top of the battle

The fear now gone
From soldiers hearts
Ares and its spirit
Is now with us

The spears shine under the warm sun
The soldiers are ready for battle

With honour in their hearts
They worship the god

Of War

Now Swords and steel are tasting their blood
The sound of steel echoes of death

And the God Of war now laughs On his throne
