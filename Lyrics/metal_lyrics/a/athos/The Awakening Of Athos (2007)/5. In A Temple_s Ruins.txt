I stand in front of the ruins of a Temple, Its shine hidden under a Christian church
A piece of stone is whispering its story of blood
A statue is lying with no head, a God is crying with no home telling me the story of blood

[Apollo:]
I can hear their cries inside their silence
A story ended in blood, a blood of Christian love
Memories are spoiled around a grief can be never solved
Of the pasts the darkest time, the history of Christian love
Years have past but the flame is alive from the ashes burning
What made on lies shall in times...
The Christian love shall DIE!!!!

And the God cried and his tears dropped on ground
From the tears a name was written... NEMESIS!
