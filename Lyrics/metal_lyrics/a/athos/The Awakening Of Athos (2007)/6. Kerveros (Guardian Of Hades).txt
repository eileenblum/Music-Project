In the deep dark abyss an unsleeping guardian
He stays there guards the gates of Hades
Three heads and with no mercy, Guardian of the Elysian fields
Offspring of mother Echinda, ferocious watchdog of the underworld Guardian!!

Kerveros stands at the gates of house of Hades
And fawns of the dead as they enter in the world of darkness
Eats anyone who tries to pass back to the world of living

Kervere watch guardian one day we'll meet
As I will pass the gates of Hades
