in this life I have enough interests of my own
don't care to reap the rotting crop you've sown
if I wouldn't live for myself in the first place
what lifeless, hollow ghosts I would then chase?

motherfucker
selfish
TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS!
egoist
self-centered
hedonist
FIRST THINGS FIRST!
fucked up
no future
freak show
IN YOUR FACE!
realist
no one wins
life is death race
LIFE IS DEATH RACE!

all fucked up!
ups and downs molding my identity
ignoring the norms of modern society
if the shades of grey were thrown upon this rack
in the end the screen would be divided white and black

earn my trust and be treated as an equal
break that bond and suffer the sequel
pointless views and meaningless statements
mankind's ignorance could never be underrated

LIFE IS DEATH RACE!
