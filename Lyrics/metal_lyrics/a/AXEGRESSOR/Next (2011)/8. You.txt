for some, life is just a big failure
for others, series of small victories
you can create a lifetime of grace
you are what you create
you can!

choices, chances
opportunities
choices, chances

as comes the end
curtain descends
final hour draws near
no regrets, no reason to fear

this life may seem too dull and short
it's you who gives up and becomes an underdog
you fail!

choices, chances
opportunities
choices, chances

as comes the end
curtain descends
final hour draws near
no regrets, no fear
mission now complete
no room for pleas
leaving with pride
all is done, all is right

all things accomplished
all that was achieved
forming the spine of every memory
all that was said
all that was done
everything that made a stand
as soil and soul becomes one

choices, chances
opportunities
choices, chances

as comes the end
curtain descends
final hour draws near
no regrets, no fear
mission now complete
no room for pleas
leaving with pride
all is done, all is right
