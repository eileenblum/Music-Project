you gotta be passionate
choose your fate
you gotta be clear and straight

you gotta get your own kicks
play no tricks
you gotta get all things fixed

on your knees!
my kingdom may not be the biggest
my star may not shine so bright
there are no diamonds in my chest
yet for its rust alone I would sacrifice

no one will help you!

what are you fighting for?
tell me more
is it life you adore?

none of you can be free
this is me
no one else, can't you see

on your knees!
my kingdom may not be the biggest
my star may not shine so bright
there are no diamonds in my chest
yet for its rust alone I would sacrifice
my plans may not be the wisest
the words I speak hardly qualify
you may not like what you see
but I shall never betray my kind

never forget
for all things great
a sacrifice
has to be made
force of will, ego overkill
do what thou ever wilt!
not for the ultimate victory
forever! total honesty

no one will help you!

you gotta scream if you hate
hesitate
and you know it's too late

you gotta act, common sense
nothing else
make a pact with yourself

on your knees!
my kingdom may not be the biggest
my star may not shine so bright
there are no diamonds in my chest
yet for its rust alone I would sacrifice
my plans may not be the wisest
the words I speak hardly qualify
you may not like what you see
but I shall never betray my kind
