from our cradle to our grave
for the land of the fucking brave
defended for nothing's sake
no one left, no heads at stakes
"preserve future!" we proclaimed
pride is lost, might is gone
cannonfire sealed our fates

now comes the time of silence as our lives go by
and pass before our eyes, cold loveless eyes
hearts, still pulsate, are hardened and chained
cheerless peels of doom tormenting empty shells

as the spraying crossfire tears flesh and souls
the meaning of an ideal gets lost in the dust
blurred and corrupted purpose of oneself
innocent human baits sent to final doom

crossfire!

from our cradle to our grave
for the land of the fucking brave
defended for nothing's sake
no one left, no heads at stakes
