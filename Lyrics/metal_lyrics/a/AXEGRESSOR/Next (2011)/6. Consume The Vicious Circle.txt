hold on to the moment
cherish the cheapness
wipe away the mask
forget the weakness
tonight's the night
feel the tension rise
raising hell
like no one else
no...

when there's no tomorrow
and all is here today
don't waste your precious time
to fuck the pain away

live fast, make a stand
die hard
live fast, make a stand

leave the past behind
to find it around the corner
consume the vicious circle
lessons never learnt
tear the skin
exuviate
recurrence
competence
no...

when there's no tomorrow
and all is here today
don't waste your precious time
to fuck the pain away

tonight's the night
time to smite
strike'em down
without a sound
no...

when there's no tomorrow
seize each and every day
don't waste your precious time
to fuck the pain away

live fast, make a stand
