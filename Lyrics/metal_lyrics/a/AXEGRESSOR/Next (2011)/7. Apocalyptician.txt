FIRE!

whirlwind hurricane
exceeding lunacy

no need to serve
no need to please
just fuck it all!
there's no peace

burning madness prevails
mental disarray
twisted and unstable
your adversary

no need to serve
no need to please
just fuck it all!
there's no peace

when I go down, you all shall fall
when I go down, the world will burn
when I go down, you all shall fall
when I go down, you burn just like
fucking chaos inside my mind
reaping sanity

no need to serve
no need to please
just fuck it all!
there's no peace
