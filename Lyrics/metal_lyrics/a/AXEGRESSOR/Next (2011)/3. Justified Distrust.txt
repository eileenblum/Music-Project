obey the master
follow the leader
block out your mind

dissected truths, justified distrust
in a world of lies I feel only disgust
selected truths, unjust norms
in a world of lies prepare for...

senseless provocation
hysteric denial
mental agitation
prepare to be...

blacklisted, tested
cashed-in, sold out
sentenced, condemned
browbeaten, blown up

opinions - assholes torn apart
bend over - and bow to the opposite
break through - enter the core
freedom - that's what the art is for

do what you wanna do
not what they allow you to
stand up proud and fight
you have the power, you have the right
do what you wanna do
not what they let you to

obey the master
follow the leader
block out your mind

if you raise your voice in discussion
you are on your own
if you throw the first rock
if you stand out from the line
if you are devoid of concession
you will stand alone
