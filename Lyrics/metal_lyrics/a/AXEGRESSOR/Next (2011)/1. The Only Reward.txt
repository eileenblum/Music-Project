rising from beneath
to start the battle of battles
no prisoners will be taken
cowards driven like cattle
scared fuckers running about
still their heads up their asses
delivered from their lives
metal opium for the masses

the only reward
is the thirst for war
dead or alive
matters no more

betrayers taken to the gallows
backstabbers shall walk the final plank

the only reward
is the thirst for war
dead or alive
matters no more

this is the war to end all whores
give it all for the cause
sacrifice everything
west coast holocaust

born to battle
fit for fight
sworn to war

the only reward
is the thirst for war
dead or alive
matters no more

this is the war to end all whores
give it all for the cause
sacrifice everything
west coast holocaust
