the cause may change
ingorance stays the same
herded awareness defines your worth

[Chorus:]
dullest case scenario
greater of two evils?
social pressure - social pressure
but I donÃ¤t fucking care

colors may change
fear stays the same
yet no one pays heed to at the end of it all

[Chorus 2x]

system - based on - silent - compromise

election
force-fed selection
erection of impotent idols
built upon nil demand
fairy castles made of sand
to be washed away by the next tidal wave

the cause may change
ingrorance stays the same
herded awareness defines your worth

[Chorus 2x]
