if procreation would be set subject to license
would there be brighter expectations for all of us?

[Chorus:]
Every change unused
walked like a dog in the leash
human dignity misused
independence dumped in the ditch

if you imbecile waste of flesh would be put to sleep in time
should it be celebrated or viewed with moralistic spite?

[Chorus]

15...
years of suffering
months to pay each miserable mortgage
minutes of glory
seconds to blast if all away

15...
years old, pregnant, junkie, crackwhore
kicks shall solve the threatening problem
hits in her face
times more shall end it all
