you can argue about opinions
for a lifetime and beyond
but behold the moment of truth
when facts seal the tightest bond

primitive quarrels, empty barrels
they make the loudest noise
meaninglessness
disregarding option and choice

a thinking man's blitzkrieg
is to crystalize the clause
not to use brawls as means
to justify a brittle cause

apointless view in a world of shit
rip solid ground to stand
just half-thrutsh, lies and gossip
and with no wits to demand

national persistence 
shameful mockery in the hands of tools
national resistance
learn to abuse the social tools
national persistence
age of disgrace in a rat face
national resistance
to deal with the facts when you are

out of the safety zone
a flash of insecurity
moment of compromise
claim your heritage

fistfucked by the world
truth cast in your face
hatred is not enough
to solve your inner shame

you had the power
to change the statur quo
but in the bitter end
you are the smallest man in the world

resist - racist?
persist to exist
with a fist!
