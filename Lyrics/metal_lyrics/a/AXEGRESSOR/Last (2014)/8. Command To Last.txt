we got into this game to satisfy our neds
this pit was built to make to make every body bleed
show no mercy, have no fear - total hell breaks loose
it's up to you, in or out, no one else will choose

[Chorus:]
circle pit full of shit
circle pit full of shit
get the fuck out
if you can't take a hit
this is old school mosh fucking pit!

polished sport music, kissing every ass
the circle pit of emo boys we shall fucking blast
show no mercy, have no fear - total hell breaks loose
it's up to you, in or out, on one else will choose

[Chorus]

safe and sound
running around
perfectly fit
in the circle pit

raise middlefingers high, resist this plague
FUCK MODERN METAL - plastic, weak and fake
bleeding lips, aching hips, bruised face and ass
twisted wrists, broken fists, mosh pit titan clash
show no mercy, have no fear - total hell breaks loose
it's up to you, in or out, on one else will choose

I spit
in the circle pit!
