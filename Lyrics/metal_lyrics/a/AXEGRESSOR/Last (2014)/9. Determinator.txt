even after the greatest, the vstest of destructions
there will be a room for chance to rise again

through life it's so damn easy just to crawl
than take what it gives and proudly stand tall

fight for it - don't regret it
fight for it - don't regret it
determiined
will power
strength and courage
get up and manage (trust yourself!)

a man or a maggot
a fighter or a faggot
if you really want it - you will get it

without the useless feeling of pity and remorse
you can unlock a portal to another universe 

for humans are so damn cheap to sympathize
than have them igored or simply neutralized

fight for it - don't regret it
fight for it - don't regret it
determiined
will power
strength and courage
get up and manage (donÃ¤t give up!)

a man or a maggot
a fighter or a faggot
if you really want it - you will get it
fight for it - don't regret it
fight for it!
