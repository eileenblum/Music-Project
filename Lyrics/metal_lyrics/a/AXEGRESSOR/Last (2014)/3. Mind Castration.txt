Mind castration!!!

shivering shreds of existence
unread blurry appearance
crawling, painful awareness
of the value of nothingness

[Chorus:]
The less you care
the more you can achieve
the more you recognize
the more you can't believe
the more you try to reap
the more there is to sow
the less you try to hide
the more there is to show

micro-communal burden
too heavy to bear alone
shallow, hollow aspects
replace mutual respect

[Chorus]

frustration
an every-day feeling
mind castration
a fist through the ceiling

[Chorus]

a fist through the ceiling
a fist through the ceiling
