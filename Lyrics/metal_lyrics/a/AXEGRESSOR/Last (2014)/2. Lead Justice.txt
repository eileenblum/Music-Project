hands tied, mouth shut, made to follow
eyes closed, mind blunt, forced to swallow
ultimate decision to end it all
desperate attempt - the final call
total - fatal - final

aces up his sleeve
never hit the spot
replaced with a rifle
what once was, now it's not

bridges burnt to a crisp
a spray of lead means justice!
share the drama of the moment
when the spine breaks

silenced, shut down human self
contempt, obedience, disrespected
the straw that broke the camel's back
this calls for more than a bottle of Jack
total - fatal - final

aces...

bridges burnt to a crisp
a spray of lead means justice!
feed the karma of the moment
when the fates clash
a desperate act of extreme torment
a potent suicide note

never speak, never open up
keep the world's weight to yourself
show no weakness of compassion
keep up the act till the bitter end

aces up his sleeve
never hit the spot
replaced with a rifle
what once was, now it's not / and the result is

fatal combination
an unstable man with nothing to lose
no reason to survive
all paths blocked, none to choose

a challenge os succes
requirement of toleration
inborn social distress
the pressure of adaptation

cornered for the very last time
picked up the shortest straw
felt the closing of the walls
a spray of lead means justice for all!
