in absolute darkness
you cannot travek with a speed of light
forget the far reaching dreams
settle for your miserable destiny

future in your hands
so they chopped them off
home is where the heart is
so they tore it out your chest
aimless human being
cast out from this life
zero goals to achieve
grinded by the eternal wheel

in absolute madness
dead end is the only way out
forget the voices of reason
settle for your miserable fate

regret every dead
you have ever done
merciless reality check
rips your soul to pieces
rootless human being
no place in this life
the only goal remains
waiting the end to come

no future!

in absolute darkness
turn your face towards eternal light
forget all love and hope
settle for your miserable fate
settle for your miserable, disgusting, ife-defiling fate!
