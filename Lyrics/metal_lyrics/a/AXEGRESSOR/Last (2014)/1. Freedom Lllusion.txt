Staring down the well of humanity's pieces
in the end it's all the same to drown in feces
eyes empty, motionless, staring at nothingness
values raped and ruined, couldn't care less
harlot scum giving head for easy dirty bucks
junkie sluts simple-minded sitting stupid ducks
inbred rats shitting in their own crumbling nests
cryings wimps givings up the final rank test of faith

against this world
you have too much freedom

spineless pigs not worth a puke in the dust
worthless swine sporting a culture of lust
I am part of dying race and too proud of the fact
that every single human being is worth a stinking rat
under smothered banners we were taught to march
homo sapiens supermen, robots without a heart
world inbred with clones pretending all is fucked nice
for hell is where we live and this hell is where we all
shall die!

against...

this world - a playground of souls
sold before nothing was done
stand proud and you will lose
cos if you fuck with the world
it will... fuck you

sheep and the sheepherd
with us or against us
read my lips carefully
I'm agaisnt all of you

this world...

sheep and the sheepherd
with us or against us

I don't swallow the things you follow
scorn is peaceful state of mind

spineless...

against...

I don't belong to this goddam herd
they will get what they deserve
I just take what the suckers reap
and reign upon the self-made heap
you are on my black list
your fate is sealed with my fist
which destroys all moralists
and cheap cunt culture pigs
next to die!
