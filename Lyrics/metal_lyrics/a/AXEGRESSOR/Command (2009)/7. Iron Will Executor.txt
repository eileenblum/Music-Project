iron will - final kill!
to take a life, to take a life
to touch the flame burning bright
to take a life, to finally come alive

no tomorrow
the day has come to its end
strong determination, zero hesitation

once in a lifetime
for a passing moment
I will gain control
I will take a life

to take a life
to have control
to reach the goal
to rule again
to seize the day
to prove yourself

to take a fucking life!

to focus on the extreme - to serve the only cause
to reap away the weak and powerless thoughts
not blindly believe and take this life for fucking granted
what will blow away a feeble mind is the final day of judgement

iron will - final kill!
to take a life, to take a life
to touch the flame burning bright
to take a life, to finally come alive
