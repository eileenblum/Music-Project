not worth the skin Iâm wearing
cursed by the world Iâm staring
I shall never be the same again
walked on a wire thatâs broken
damned by the truth Iâve spoken
I shall never be the same

feed on the energy of my death!

sometimes we are one
yet never we are not
living with both of you
inside this same slut
your tongue in my mouth
your breath in my lungs
your dirty fingers cling around my neck

no one is yourself
in this empty shell
I am none to me
screaming out for help
your sight in my eyes
your shame in myself
your filthy thoughts linger in my brain

dead-end street - no way out from this maze
paranoia - hell within, a ratsâ race
medication - modern science keeps me sane
deathstination - nowhere I can find my mind
