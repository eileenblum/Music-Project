mentally paralysed
emotions petrified
itâs no use to live
thereâs nothing more to give

and you never gave anything
the cycle of existence getting smaller
the rope around your neck tighter
the darkness getting darker and you have lost the lighter

hear the strangling silence
feel its determined strength
the courage you never had
the power you never felt

an outcast, outside
vacant lifeless core
thrown aside, empty inside
this is the you waited for

dead since birth
strangling silence
lifetime of nothingness
strangling silence
silenceâ¦
