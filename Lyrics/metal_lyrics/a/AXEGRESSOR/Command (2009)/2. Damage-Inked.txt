Your blood is the ink these lines are written with
Your skin the canvas pictures are painted on
Engraved mental fresco, plain example of art
A calling to create, now straight from the heart

Damage!
Inked!
Damage-inked to the bone
Body-mind-soul
Complete devotion
Outlet of inspiration
Complete devotion
Absolution

Sharpened quills are puncturing your crimson skin
Lyrics through flesh, words and letters carved deep within
Straight to the heart, scribbling random figures
While this artwork burns like the blazing flames of hell!

manifest â creative declaration
mental quest â inner exploration
trust yourself â personal creation
enrich your life â express perfection

This song serves as an instrument to reach utopia
This line as a path to the ecstasies beyond
