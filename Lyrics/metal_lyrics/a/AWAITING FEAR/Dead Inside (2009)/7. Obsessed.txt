Torn between two realities
lost inside maze of torment
echoes screaming through the distance
reality changes.

Blood inside me boiling,
head to explode,
defences collapsing,
ancestral call grows strong.

Body begins to move
to unearthly sound,
glowing bridges appear,
in distance in orgy creatures collide.

Through anger,through laughter

I'm dying,I'm screaming,
I'm dying,I'm bleeding

Sweat on their face,unseen threads pulling,
skies screaming in red,serpentine flesh

Whispers inside my head,my arms begin to move,
strange circles appear,a ritual of doom.
