I see corpses
vultures fly around
as their bodies
rot on the sacred ground
I see terror
fear is all around
as I hold my rifle
I will shot man down

I walk in the street
battlefield is gone
no bodies no blood
there is no war...

I can't escape from them
from engraved memories
all my spirit
roams corrupted
I see terror
fear is all around
as I hold my rifle
I will shot man down

from the forgotten past
it is possessing me
as my body
somewhere rots gutted

I can hear them
but I can't see them...

I can feel them
but I can't find them...

I want them dead
but I can't hurt them...

I want to shoot them
but I can't make them bleed

I start to run
and try to hold my line
I take the gun
spot and aim the enemy
I see them
I'll try one more time...
to kill them
to win this battle...

FIRE!!!
