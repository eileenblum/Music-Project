All the time of this world
is yours to cry
the reasons for your quick demise

To become one with the earth
To hear the answers to all questions

Your brain is dead
Now you're a corpse
Your brains is dead
Now you won't care

Your brain is dead
It's the end of life
Your brain is dead
Empty gaze to nowhere

Stench Still Bliss Dust

Decompose

Slowly

Now you're a mineral
