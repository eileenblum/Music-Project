Under the dirt
where maggots feed
in a coffin sealed by stone
sacred bones dwell
awaiting the rebirth
buried long time ago
by our ancestors
to ensure our home

place of our ancestors
to keep the memory of old times
keeping the reminder of real gods
keeping the reminder of truth

take a look what we are doing
cause it may be the last time you did
make it up to our karma
or die by the hand of living dead

funeral throne!
