Look around you there is nothing to see
Except the asses and pumped up tits
glittering faces and silicon lips
empty brain hookers won the round

On TV
In the bus
on the streets
all over earth
globalistic culture
is bringing the dirt

Money and fame is all they need
they will ride thousands of cocks to fill their greed
Hookers don't see that their soul bleeds
globalistic culture upon them feeds

Fancy haircuts,polished nails
fags acting like victims all desecrated
shitting about their broken hearts
their life is same like their fate

Like all fashion they will die
but its existence won't make us cry
we will withstand and breed
upon our anger we will feed
