Misanthropy,depression,suicidal ideas
Mania,dementia,psychosis
that dwell inside your mind....

Feel free to vomit

Vomit the pain from inside
that is like cancer
eating up your guts

release yourself
from that vain
don't forever
rot in your pain

The sickness and emptiness
form of well known mental disorder

make the stomach bleed
you must break free,
from the thing inside.

vomit that gathered through time
vomit that kept you behind

behind life behind reality
in your mind locked forever
