Forever kept self inside
for better tomorrow,
they prisoned ourselves in
objects full of emptiness

they poisoned our land,
they poisoned our future,
they poisoned our brains,
they'll poison our children

in the graveyard
for our souls
buried within
like ghouls
the prison
made of concrete
in the shell of their hell

We all live in concrete prison
we dwell in our rage

Concrete prison we dwell in it,
Concrete prison we die in it.
