I see corpsesvultures fly aroundas their bodies rot on the sacred groundi see terrorfear is all aroundas i hold my riflei will shot man down I walk in the streetbattlefield is goneno bodies no blood      there is no war... I can't escape from themfrom engraved memoriesall my spiritroams corruptedi see terrorfear is all aroundas i hold my riflei will shot man down from the forgotten pastit is possesing meas my body somewhere rots gutted I can hear thembut i can't see them... I can feel them but i can't find them... I want them deadbut i can't hurt them... I want to shoot thembut i can't make them bleed I start to runand try to hold my linei take the gunspot and aim the enemyi see themi'll try one more time...to kill themto win this battle... FIRE!!!
