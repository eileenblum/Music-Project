Something slimy trying to take our home awaysinking trough depressionno food enough to remain.Illeum attackingbastard saw it's chanceAppendicitis 'round the cornerCrohn's approaching its way. Ugly creature squeezing usright inside our lair.Bouncing, hitting, making soundsintruder out we say.Baby, baby to be born,suffered us in wombhis blood denyingblood defying(creating)cursing bloody doom. We twist and turn,hoping she will understandhearing screams in distancebut it all remains the same.Down belownear the very endfriends scream in panicsome big, growing red. Ugly creature squeezing usright inside our lair.Bouncing, hitting, making soundsintruder out we say.Baby, baby to be born,suffered us in wombhis blood denyingblood defying(creating)cursing bloody doom. Convulsions started,throwing him out,pain unbearable,poop mixed with blood. Blood, blood, blood!!! Evil forces screamingkeep the linePush and press troughbellow underground.Trough the pain strongermoving trought tunnel lightone last try armyand we prevailed trough night. Ugly creature that squeezed us is now outside our lair.Our army made it right,intruder's out we say.Baby, baby now is bornout from our womb,made it trought first crytill next time goodbye.
