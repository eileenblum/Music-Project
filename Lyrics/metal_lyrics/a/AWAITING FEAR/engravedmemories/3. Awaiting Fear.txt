Believe in yourselfBelieve in your dreamsTrough the silenceNone there it seemsClosing your eyesSlowly you breathWaiting for signFor him to reappear Trembling beginsYour heart beating fastSweat on your faceItch on your back.Scream from insidePanic ariseWalls closing inCrawls on your skin Awaiting, fear!Awaiting, fear!AwaitingÂ fear!!! As the portal opens and blue light comes throughtyou see the image of humanoid shapeand oreol around itbut is it the one you wanted to callor is it not you dont knowAs it slowly aproaches thowardsall you fell is fearÂ Believe in yourselfTrough the silenceCosing your eyesWaiting for sign.Believe trought your dreamsFor there he'll reappearTo cover you fearsTrough the night! AwaitingÂ fear!!!
