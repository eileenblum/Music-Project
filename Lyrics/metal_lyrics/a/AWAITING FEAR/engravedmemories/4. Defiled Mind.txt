Station filled with people
mind starts to boil
can't watch them live
can't stand their talk
running into swarm
can't stand their talk
starting the clensing
can't stand their smell

Activate the granate
parts of bodies fly away
intentness left to rot
smiles wiped away

When I watched them
ignorance is blasting
stupid dwellers
must kill them all

They are still children
but as they grow
they will become like them
ignorant
those beneath the cross

Defiled mind [x2]

ACTIVATE [x4]

ACTIVATE [x2]

activate the granate
parts of bodies fly away
intentness left to rot
smiles wiped away

They are still children
but as they grow
will become like them
those beneath the cross

Defiled mind!
