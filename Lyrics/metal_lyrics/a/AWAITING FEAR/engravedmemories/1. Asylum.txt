Innocent creation
Hatred now
Made to be the highest
yet betrayed by God
being so fragile
being so proud
bringer of chaos
from whom dead hide

Forgiveness... not seeking
Nor to... be found
Screaming...in anger
Bind... in dark

Truth is denied
To all living kinds
God still forbids
truth to be found
yet he awaits
in deep cellar in dark

Assylum...awaits!

Alone struggling
To preserve life
Endless time
Soundless cries
Loosing what's left
In crazed mind
Asylum awaits
For deceived one

Forgiveness... not seeking
Nor to... be found
Screaming...in anger
Bind... in dark
