Pus soaks this dirt
cancer to this land
the roots turn sour
drowning in rotten decay

does this sound fair
infarct heart of the earth
bringer of the plaque
must I bare this cross much more

I am the Martyr
in smothered hope
I bare
this cross
cross of changes

I am the martyr
of the gangrene harvest
of virulent incantation
obscene conjuration
