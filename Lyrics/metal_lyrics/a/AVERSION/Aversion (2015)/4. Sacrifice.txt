There is a war lust in my abysmal heart
A darkness below and a darkness above
I whisper forbidden words into the blacked flames
I spit sulfurous blood into the wind as I summon...

Against your fate I will watch you fall to my knees
A catatonic state of pure bliss and true misery
A sacrilegious rupture of venomous faith divine
My eyes in ecstasy as you become the blood eagle in the sky...

Beyond the moon you now soar
Bottomless clouds lead you to your karmic despondency
Into black oceans you will bleed
Fly with false freedom as I caress your lung against my chest
Rise Judgment
Rise fate
Bring Karma
Bring Hate

Under the shadow of the moon
I witness your half eaten face
As you too have consumed yourself dry and empty
I have considered myself full and complete
I now watch your proud eagle plummet to the withering ground to suffocate
Into the darkest oceans you will follow
Forever the deepest rivers you will swallow
