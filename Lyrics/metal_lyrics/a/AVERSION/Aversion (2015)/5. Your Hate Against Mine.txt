The blood on my hands I won't deny
these crimes Iâve been sanctioned Iâll die for
death to the merciless tyrant
we will burn in black flames together
your hate against mine
a sacrifice I will make for your destruction
to purify your spiritless soul
for eternity I will feed off your suffering
your hate against mine

I summon the spirits you desecrated due to your selfishness

My blood is rivers of hate
a power you have burdened me with
Give rise to forces infernal
as they suffocate you in the depths of hell

Semper ardenti igne purganda
Nam spiritus invoco te conterat
tenebras autem interitus et vindictae
da mihi virtutem enim ultionis
