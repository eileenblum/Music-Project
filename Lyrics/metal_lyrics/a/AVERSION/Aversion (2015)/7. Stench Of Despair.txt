On this forsaken morning
Through the murky foggy air
The forest moaning of agony
A heavy stench of despair
A twist of violent mangling
Has grabbed my visceral soul
Has leached into my arteries
And disfigured my entity

Through the path of skeleton dirt
On the soil of human tears
Revealed was the mass grave I lay in
The executionary wrist upheld

Brother, let the raven take you away
While our corpses rot in the ditch of Katyn

Cursed soil, bottomless pit of torment
Hungry and thirsty for flesh
Cursed in blood, under the wings of the raven
Take me away
My ghost one with the mountain
