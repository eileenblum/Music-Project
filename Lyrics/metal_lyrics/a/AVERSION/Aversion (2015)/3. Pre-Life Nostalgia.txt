Binded in karmic bonds
enslaved by memory
stillborn in blood
still I crave veins of flesh
roots I have inside the womb
new rebirth chosen by fate

psychic memory I retain, traces between now and then
in nostalgic divinity, choose I can't
blood-soaked-alive
live-is-to-die

infinity, road to nowhere
black ash, mind in darkness
failed, deformed creation
vacant, forever lost

under the dark shadow of the tree of life
I have never found my peace of mind
under the raven's wings I fly
lost in the northern winds of time.
