On this night he foretold my future
The ancient wolf with the burning eyes
âthis is the night of your resurrectionâ
from the top of the highest mountain
raining down my immortal blood
in the darkness an unholy power

make me of blood and flesh again
make me a heart that beats
make me feel the cold mountain air
make me a soul that grieves again
give me another chance to die
âthis is the night of your resurrectionâ

Follow follow the path of the wolf
Follow follow the blood streaked Carpathian sky
In my dreams I can feel the presence of my eternity
A forbidden life not meant to be
I rip and eat the flesh of the maggot womb
Profanus Cortus!
I rise from the corpse which gave me life
The ground screaming in fear
as I cry tears of unholy lust
