i'll cry alone
when the curtain fell
down from the sky and
storms through my distressed
seat of passion

i'll cry alone
when tranquillity diffuse
in winds of funeral hall
and cover my mournfull tears
with a thick lay of pain

then i will speed through the heavens,
i will speed through my life
speed through time
then i will speed through the heavens
i will speed through my life
speed through time

then let all leaves
descend into a deep sleep
and let the ache amplitude
in every corner were malignancy is lurking

let me be silhouetted
upon the unlitting sky
as i draw down my life
on tissue paper and silent decline away

then i'll speed through the heavens
and i'll speed through time
speed through time
then i'll speed through the heaven
i'll speed through the night

let me be silhouetted
upon the unlitting sky
when i'm drawing down my life
let me be silhouetted
as i silent decline away

i'll cry alone
