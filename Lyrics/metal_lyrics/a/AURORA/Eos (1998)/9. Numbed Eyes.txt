i wish i could
turn me into something
try to neglect the reason
that you passed away

i wish i could hide into the dark
vanish through my reflection
into the blood coloured sun

all the love we once had become
has vanished and is forever gone
we didn't dare to open our eyes
and realize our own disquise

i wish i could rewind the nights
were you and me gazed with numbed eyes

i wish i could turn back the time
where you and me fucked...
