silent we are laying here in the desert
no trues, no flowers
just us bathing in eachothers blood and passions

stoned we are

the sun glows like an inflamed eye
the light is bright and the eye of a snake comes above

stoned we are

danzing summer
danzing you and me

weird love and danzing summer
the first kiss and the gentle
words from your burning lips

pure poetry

naked we are danzing
a serenade for the lonelyness
the depression, the love and the blood
eternaly we shall fly... high

stoned we are
