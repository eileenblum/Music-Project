sitting in the fields
the blood coloured fields
and wonder about the day
i was coming back to life

i clearly remember
the bright shining light
coming through the skies
gazing through my eyes

i remember
how i trembled as i saw your body
i remember how divine i felt
as i saw your face

sweet child o' mine

suddenly the light
was gone forever gone
i heard the birds cry in the sky
and teardrops falling to the ground

aurora borealis

that moment i knew
that something unusually
had happened to me

i opened my eyes and i realized
that i was coming back to life

aurora borealis
a part of me is still in your sky
