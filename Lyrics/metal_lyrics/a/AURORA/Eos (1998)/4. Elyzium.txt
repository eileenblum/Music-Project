how lovely
you're standing in the rain

i want to feel you
hold you and kiss you
i want to kill you
and see you flying high

but how can i make your
dream come through
and how can i show you elyzium

(please) follow my dream
for eternity, follow me

i don't know who i am

(who are you?)

through my life i have
crucified heaven and christ
eventhough my god is eternally

my last wish is to - open your flower
make your hunger come through
and reach elyzian fields
from the depth of tranquillity
