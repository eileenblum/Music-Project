look at the colours in the dreaming water
the moon sets in a sea of love
far away stands a girl
watching the slit open the sky
tears are falling

in her mind - a pictured boy
in her vain - a bloodbubble
which is tearing her apart

black tears

in her mind - a pictured boy
in her vain - a bloodbubble
which is tearing her apart

black tears
they are crawling
they are falling
on her breast

through the dream she flew to the sky
where the eyes of truth always are watching you
she flew with tears to the hidden sky
where dead angels sing
and the love never dies

black tears

where the love of generations never dies
