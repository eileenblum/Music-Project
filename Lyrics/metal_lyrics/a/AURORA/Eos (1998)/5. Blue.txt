the sun glows
like an inflamed eye
and blinds our cosmos
with illuminated beams

blue...
but who cares?

in faint we slumber
we don't percieve
what is happening
outside these cold walls

above the (passive) houses
a young man tries
to take his life
by walking the (crossing) line

(still) the birds are hooding
for the heated blue
but they cannot find it
instead they decline away

the hazard wind blows cold
and cover the (animated) skin
with pain
while we all pass away
