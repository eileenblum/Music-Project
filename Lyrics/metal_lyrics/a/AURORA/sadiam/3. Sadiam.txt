when you feel like someone to rely on
and you feel like someone

who kissed the snake
ran away hid in the dark
for someone you relied on
who needed to run
for the hidden gun
in vain for the twisted one
in someone
then run

when everything is sad
and you don't know
whether you're alive or dead

cast the dies, burn the old wife,
choose life
