... now my barbaric body
becomes an easy prey
to every wildanimal

and every wind
shall breath in the shadow
of every numbness tree
murmuring and whispering for his hideous sin

julia went down
down down to the ground

to hell and never coming back
to hell, julia went down she'll never return anymore

ablazed and graft down
and yet blossom as spring in its pride
with apples like condemned devil heads

and julia is no more
as she walked out the door
from which she'll never be returning
while she went down

now her soul is scald
in tartaros' streams
and feeds at hell' deadly tree,
beyond lethe, beyond bitterness fruit

demon's dwelling
in iron of hungry flames
her soul is seeking into orcus' sea of flames

julia went down
down down to the ground
