can you hear a man
hammering his face against the door?
he is to numb
to use his hands

can you see a man
trying to talk with his wife?
but she'll never let him in
"because she is f...... someone else"

i'm coming home

...the man invites her...
welcome to a new machine
welcome to a new beginning

...the wife invites him...
welcome to the final chapter of life
welcome to the final step of me
welcome to a life in hell

still home!!!

why can they never forgive?
why do i feel like a pig?
why is the world so cold?
why can't we greet a new morning?

did you see the man
falling down to the ground?
he was begging on his bleeding knees

did you cry the day
you couldn't feel me?
or are you still a (cynic) bitch
who will never forgive?

... did you ever feel the same sin like i did?...
