DID YOU EVER FEEL ME?
DID YOU EVER TASTE ME?
DID YOU HEAR MY CRIES?

THEY WERE THIRSTING
THEY WERE BURSTING
THROUGH MY DARKEST SKIES

NO AND YOU NEVER GAVE A DAMN THING...BUT!

YOU TRIED TO DRAIN ME
YOU TRIED TO BREAK ME
YOU TRIED TO KILL ME
YOU FUCKING HATED ME

COULD I EVER BUIRN?
BURN AND EVER LEARN?
WHEN YOUR VENUS WOULDN'T SHINE?

SHINE AND SPREADING WIDE
WIDE AND BRIGHT
SO I COULD FEEL FINE?

NO AND YOU NEVER GAVE A DAMN THING...BUT!

YOU TRIED TO DRAIN ME
YOU TRIED TO BREAK ME
YOU TRIED TO KILL ME
YOU FUCKING HATED ME
IN THIS ROOM...
