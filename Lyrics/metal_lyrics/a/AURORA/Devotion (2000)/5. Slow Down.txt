YOU TELL WHAT I DO WHAT I NEED
BUT I FEEL THE BRAIN IS TRAPPED
AND I'M INSANE?

HEY WOMAN SLOW DOWN
HEY WOMAN SLOW DOWN

AS YOU DON'T NEED TO SET
THE CONTROL OF THE HEART
OF ME ANYMORE

HET WOMAN SLOW DOWN
HEY WOMAN SLOW DOWN

AS I'M THE ONE TO REIGN
IN MY KINGDOM OF SLAIN
AS I'M THE CAPTURE OF FIRE
THAT BURNS WITH DARKEST DESIRE

SO DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO
AS I'M THE MASTER, I'M THE BLASTER
AND DON'T TELL YOU LOVE ME TO
AS I'M DYNAMITE AND I'M TERRIFIED
THAT I'LL MAYBE BREAK DOWN!!!

HEY WOMAN SLOW DOWN
HEY WOMAN SLOW DOWN

SO DON'T TAKE MY FRIENDS
AWAY FROM ME
