DON'T YOU BE SORRY MRS. PINK
YOU ARE JUST A BLINK OF AN EYE
EVERY MAN'S ALTERNATIVE 3
STILL A SWEET SUGAR CREAM

YOU ARE ADORABLE SMILING
AND YOU NEVER ASK FOR ANYTHING
AND THAT'S WHY I LIKE YOU
MY LITTLE PINK THING

SO LET DOWN
YOUR SOUL TO ME
SO LET DOWN
YOUR PANTIES FOR ME

AS YOU'RE THE PINK NAIL
THE NAIL I NEED
THE NAIL THAT BLEED
WHEN I WISH

DON'T YOU BE SORRY MRS. PINK
LIVE THE FLESH LIKE YOU THINK
DROWN ALL YOUR SORROWS
AND FORGET ALL ABOUT TOMORROW
AS THE SECOND RIDE SOON WILL FOLLOW
