DO YOU REMEMBER WE TUMBLED AROUND
JUST LIKE CRAZY DOGS IN TOWN?

AND WE WERE DYNAMITE?
AND LOVE WAS A DELIGHT?
EVERY DAY AND EVERY NIGHT?
JUST YOU AND ME AND YOUR CRAZY DOG?

A NEW MORNING RISES
AND EVERYTHING'S FINE...
A DOG IS MAD, A LUNATIC CAT
SAW RED AND WENT BLIND...
A WOMAN CRIES INTO THE SKY
AND SIGHS WHILE YOU DIE!

AND DO YOU REMEMBER I WAS TERRIFIED
AS I COULDN'T SHE WHAT MADE THE DOG BITE

NAYBE IT WAS MY FLESH?
WAS IT TOO SWEET?
DID I NOT TREAT YOUR DOG WELL?
DIDN'T IT ANY LONGER LIKE ME?
WAS I REALLY SUCH A CREEP?

BUT WE ARE STILL ONE BIG FAMILY
YOU AND ME AND THE CRAZY PUPPY

AND I'M DYNAMITE
AND I'M TERRIFIED
EVERY DAY AND NIGHT
STILL TERRIFIED OF YOU AND YOUR CRAZY DOG
