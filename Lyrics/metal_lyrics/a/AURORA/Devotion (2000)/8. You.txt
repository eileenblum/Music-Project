SO HERE I STAND
IN NO-MAN-LAND
WITH A SUN
IN MY HAND

WHICH SPARKLES WITH
YOUR DEAD BEAMS
THROUGH MOONS CREEK

NO...YOU CAN'T RUN YOU CAN'T CRAWL
THROUGH THE LIFE YOU (ONCE)ADORED
EVENTHOUGH PAIN IS TOO STRONG
AND YOU CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE

SUN IS BURNING
EVER ETERNAL
INFERNAL BURNING

DANGEROUS MAD
FOREVER SCREWED
REMIND ME OF YOU

NO...YOU CAN'T RUN YOU CAN'T CRAWL
THROUGH THE LIFE YOU (ONCE)ADORED
EVENTHOUGH PAIN IS TOO STRONG
AND YOU CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE

(HER DEVILISH SOUL)
WHAT IS THE HEALING OF LIFE IF LIFE IS POINTLESS
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE IF WE ARE LIMITED
TO THE DESIRES AND PASSIONS WE FEEL
WHY DON'T WE TEAR DOWN THE WALL WHEN DREAMS
AND SOULS ARE HOLD IMPRISONED
WHY IS TOO LITTLE HANDED OVER TO FATASISM AND PSYCHEDEALISM
WHY NOT BE FREE AS THE EAGLE AND HUNT THE PASSIONS YOU SEE
WHY NOT REMAINS AS YOUR BLACK GOD INFINITE IN THE CYNIC FLESH
WHAT THE HELL HAVE I DONE???

...YOU BREAK ME!!!
