NO ONE FELT LIKE YOU AND LITTLE I
LIKE A FRAGILE LEAF ON A RAINY NIGHT

WE OPENED OUR EYES IN THE SKY
IN THE HOPE OF SEEING THE SIGN
TO MOVE FURTHER OUR DEVOTED LIVES

AND WE BUBBLED WITH LOVE
AND OUR STONED EYES
WERE TRAPPED WITHIN THE SUNSHINE

BETWEEN US NOTHING BUT AIR
THE LOVE WE DESPAIRED
THE COOL BREEZE DOWN THE SPINE

NO ONE FELT LIKE YOU AND LITTLE I
LIKE A FRAGILE LEAF ON A RAINY NIGHT
COMFORTABLY NUMB AND OUT OF MIND
DEAD TO THE BONE OUT OF TIME

AND OUR MINDS UP IN THE SKY
DIDN'T PASS US ANY SINGLE WORD
EVENTHOUGH WE DESPERATELY TRIED

BUT WE COULDN'T FIND THE WORDS
THAT WOULD BREAK THE SILENCE
THAT SURROUNDED US WITH SLOW DEMISE

BETWEEN US NOTHING BUT AIR
THE LOVE WE DESPAIRED
THE COOL BREEZE DOWN THE SPINE
AND THE TWO FRUSTRATED CLOWNS

... BUT I WANTED TO SEE
WHAT YOU WERE WEARING INSIDE
BUT I COULDN'T BREAK THROUGH
AS YOUR SKY WAS THICKER THAN MINE...

BUT DEVOTED WE WERE?
