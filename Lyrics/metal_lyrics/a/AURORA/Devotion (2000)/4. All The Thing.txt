WHAT I FEEL TODAY IS SOMEHOW A SLOW DECAY
SO I GUESS I WILL PRAY
TOGETHER WITH BOTTLE I DISMAY
SO I CAN END MY DAY

BUT THE BOOZE WON'T KILL SO I SWALLOW TEN PILLS
IN THE HOPE THEY WILL RELEASE ME
FROM THE DREADFUL MEMORIES
THAT KEEP COMING BACK ON ME

I'M INSANE
ALL THE THINGS THAT COME TO MIND
KILL ME ONE AGAIN

BUT THE DRUGS DON'T WORK AND THE BOOZE ONLY LURKS
SO I GUESS IT'S MY CONCLUSION
THAT LIFE IS A PIECE OF HARD WORK
MRS. PINK DOESN'T LIKE ME
AND I'M NO LONGER HAPPY?

I'M INSANE
ALL THE THINGS THAT COME TO MIND
KILL ME ONCE AGAIN

MRS. PINK DOESN'T LIKE ME
AND I'M NO LONGER HAPPY
SO I GUESS I WILL CEASE
THE DAMNED BLACK LEASH
NO I CAN END MY FUCKED UP TWISTED LIFE
AND DROWN MY BELOVED WIFE
