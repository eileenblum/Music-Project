[Music: Terp - lyrics: Frolund]

Watch me
I'm falling
Inti the deep
Into the sea
See me
I'm breathing
Perfect breathing
Beneath the sea
There's no way
out of this deep
There's no way
out of this sea
There is no hope
for you or me
So I just want
to be beneath the sea
So don't pull me out
Don't release me
As my soul shall forever
swim beneath this sea
