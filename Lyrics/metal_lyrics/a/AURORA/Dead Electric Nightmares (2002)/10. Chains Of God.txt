[Music: Vestergaard - lyrics: Frolund]

Like a cosmic Venus veiled in white
carried upon intergalatic light
You carried your golden wings and fiery eyes
ever afloat in dark eternal skies
Forever
Like a comet racing in the sky
You're moving faster than light
You're encircling your lucky star
And moon and sun are light years away
Pull him out of the chains of God
Before it's too late
