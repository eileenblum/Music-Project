[Music: Terp - lyrics: Frolund]

Beyond the metaphysical spectre
there was perfect light
Only light, there was no hint of darkness
Nor was this moment ever in the past
Nor could it ever be. Outside time
It simply was. Perfect. Eternal. Pure
Existence
The Universe spun, and so did us
Not as beings but as monads in a reverie
In gravity's grip, no circle was pure
No being was being, yet by being we were
Eternal, forever an instant of light's electricity
We were stars, sea seed, galaxies, quarks
Nano things shinning on some starlit
For eons or seconds we were exactly the same
Existence's essence could be nothing than less
All were rapidly burning through nothingness
All were
The same were
eternally around you, within me
Was only light

[Solo: Broberg]
