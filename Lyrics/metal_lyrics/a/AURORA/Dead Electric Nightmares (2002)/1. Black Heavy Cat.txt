[Music: Vestergaard - lyrics: Frolund]

Imagine the complications in our useless lives
and the frustrations we're building
withing our selfless tries
We're consumed within our mediocre tears
and our minds are fucked for several years
You live you learn, so they say
But the lesson you have been told
remains the same every single day
But whenever you go out
destiny is at our back
sticks to you like a black heavy cat
We're trying to make sense of absurd things
Bearing our burden on heavy wings
Gather all our joys and sorrows
but life is still completely shallow
We're reaching out to cease the day
and climb the highest tree in big dismay
What drives us to improve?
What drives us to go on?
I don't know
'cause tomorrow we'll be gone
