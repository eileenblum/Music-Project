[Music: Terp/Vestergaard - lyrics: Frolund]

We were the avengers of life
The men without heads
Playing with ourselves like marionettes
We were lost in streams
Lost inside an electric dream
Believed we were ego cuasa sui
Another God, another plastic machine
We questioned the existence
of other beside being ourselves
Believed everything comes from nothing
and that nothing comes from everything
We saw our faces painted in neon colours
A few electrifed faces
Only scratched down, painted down on transparent flesh
We were the avengers of life
The men without heads
Playing with ourselves like stupid marionettes
We were infants Still bleeding in our mother's womb
Black eyed kings Dead, cursed and doomed
We saw our flesh as spots
inside the misty dark of our brain
And we believed that the perception
only happend inside our heads
