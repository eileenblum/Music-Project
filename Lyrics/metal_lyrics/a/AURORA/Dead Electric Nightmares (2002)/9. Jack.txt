[Music: Terp/Vestergaard - lyrics: Frolund]

Hey little girl
I would like to show you
my photo collection
Here I stand with Jack in my hand
You were perfect little girl
So perfect
Hey yellow girl
Here I stand in
No-mans-land
With a stupid sun in my hand
My love to you were too strong
And since you're no more
I have brought this gun
Soon I'll put it to my head
Pull the trigger
Then I'm dead
Hey black girl
Here I sit on my bed
with wild staring eyes
Pretending I'm already dead
Hey little girl
Will you miss me like I miss you
when you see the photo
of my blood painted room
