They observe our emotions as if they could absorb them and use them as their own
They're feeding on our fears, pushing us into tears

We are deviated from the human potential
A world for terror occurs frequently, connected with error

What they are attempting is so absurd
The way to a man's beliefs is through absurdity

They can't succeed, but they are driven to it anyway
Struck with delusional beliefs about divinity, the way to a man's beliefs is through absurdity

They get their way with us, because we have betrayed our own capacities
Ignorant and perverted rulers that were thought to imprison all our souls
