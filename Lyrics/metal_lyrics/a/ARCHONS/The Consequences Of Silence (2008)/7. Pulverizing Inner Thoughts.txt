It's already too late for you my child
Did the truth reach your innocent mind?
Now you surely know what's awaiting you

Illusion of the new born dissipated

All wired together we created a new dimension
That can be accessed by all ones, old and young

Facing reality, earlier and earlier
Starting life with those macabre visions
So young and already pictures of death
Turning your dreams into nightmares

Pulverizing inner thoughts
Upcoming generations all messed up
Innocence replaced by torment

Spent most of my time obsessed by the atrocity perpetrated by man

The way things are evolving... the future can only get worse
