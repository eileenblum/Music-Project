Replacing human existence
Wiping the disgrace that we are off the surface
We prove ourselves unworthy
A living failure completely obsolete

We no longer have control over our surrounding
The source of what we is so complex and unique
But our ambitions pushed us to the edge
There's no way back and the harmony between us and our land
Has been broken
Since the beginning of the human era
We got rid of everything in our path

We've gone too far and assuming that we are above all may be our last mistake
Now that we are obsolete lifeforms, we'll be treated like annoying parasites
