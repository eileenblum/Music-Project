Self-confidence shattered in a million pieces
A part of you will be no more, cause of the cruelty of them speeches

The realm of dreams becomes a way out
Two distinct worlds in a single person

You have chosen the way out
But now, face reality

The fall
Paralyzed by the absence of truth
Of a dreamer
Will it all be taken away

Many questions to ask, and resolve
One day will come when you will die
Without understanding
You will subdue yourself

If everyday we had known as a fact
That it would be like that

We wouldn't keep it up
