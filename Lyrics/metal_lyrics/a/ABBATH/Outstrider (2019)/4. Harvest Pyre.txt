I am the ruin of all a squint can dim survey
I am the dearth of hopes' dystopic cowl dismay
I cast the baubles through rapine my fortune ill-acquired
Upon the flames rent the night deny the trinkets vice desired

I squander riches lay the bitches lust a jaded spray
I dream of nightmares conjure monsters sip decay
From breast of goddess milk the darkness blood a dulling wine
I angle sideways path a blind maze defy the scythe of time

Tap the jugular bleed the vampire
Tar the slime pit surf quagmire
Heal cadaver harvest pyre

Raw Wound!

I trawled the aether sweating reefer
Sole belief I'm beneath her
Glow decrease her in abyss deep
I unsheath her like a reaper

Tap the jugular bleed the vampire
Tar the slime pit surf quagmire
Heal cadaver harvest pyre

Reap Ripe Raw Wound!
