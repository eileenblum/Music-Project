War gods steadfast by my side
Wake of entrails stream behind
Where Ordnung rules I divide
No curse or threat will break my stride

Cerberus snaps at my heels
Chased outta Hades' blighted fields
Rebel don't beg freak never yields
What Mammon won't give the outlaw steals

Eons do not age my frame
Immutable as pouring rain
Scars evolve but never change
A mind removed from all but rage

Keep your chains
Your barricades
Keep your cage
World ablaze

Wanted scum in hell banished bedlam banned
Bloodied, broke, unbowed death denies me now

Charybdis guards the threshold where sanity unfolds
The curse of Behemoth mutates me in the shadows
Life despised me then death denies me now

From womb I burst, sharp of claw
Shipwrecked my life and swam for shore
From red-dyed sea I struck the beach
Bled my enemies dry my knife a leech

Arc of reaper's scythe
Seraphim's demise
Chaos deviant thrive
Neither dead or alive

Too debauched for hell
Scorned by heaven's crown
Heretics rebel
Death denies me now
