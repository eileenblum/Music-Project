With fist on hilt I wade thru guilt towards the Bridge of Spasms
A flailing limb cast across the yawning Maul of Chasms
Hooked to ledge at sanity's edge steel convict clamped in irons
It undulates squirms like bait hung 'bove pit of lions

That fickle whore Fate forced my gait to tread this skyward path
On skeletal thread blind man led by echoes of strangled laugh
With every step terrors swept fears like flies in rift of mind
I crawled, cracked nails clawed the creaking boards of crooked spine

Torpid Styx twist viscid fist through bowels of howling Deep
My demons spare not one nightmare ever rode plague-ridden sleep

Nailed to the mast! Flee pox of past!
Ignore the sirens' shrieking hearts
Sail the flux! Ride upheavals!
Dive beyond immortal charts
In lee of Bridge of Spasms I split among the atoms
In lee of Bridge of Spasms I split among the atoms

Like oroboros I swallow tale like oroboros I swallow tale

A Raw nerve stretches ganglion curve till ventricles erupt
I flow like blood through floating vein's arterial aqueduct
Crest the arch, gaze aghast, upon Oblique of Great Divide
It mirrors morass, life-spans' collapse, loop of ego's pride
