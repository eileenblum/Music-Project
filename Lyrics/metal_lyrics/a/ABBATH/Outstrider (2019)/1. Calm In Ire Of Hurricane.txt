Perish the dead mesh stripped from our bones
Stark is the carcass cursing our wake

Whipped core corrupt, crack'd self destruct!
Shed our shell corrosion hatch in burst of shame

A thousand lashes cuts us to our core
We find calm twist and burn dervishes spun whole

Sever the neck of bare throat stretched before us
Drink from jugulars, asphyxiate thy mind
Swallow lost spirit that pines for inhalation
Mute shrieking sirens rife with tongues to bind

Crotch-deep, drenched in gut-floods' acid rush
In womb-burst of birth-scum, drown like rats in cage
We paw the ion bars as nailless fingers scrape for flaws
Scratched they erupt in gash of glans of necrophage

Calm in ire of hurricane

Whipped core corrupt, crack'd self destruct!
Shed our shell corrosion hatch in burst of shame

Spitegeist reflects death's mnemonics's tool
Echo-chamber pitched to hells subsonic howl

In twinkle of anemic vein
Coughing like a rusty chain
Fate squats within a mangled skein
Exuding calm in ire of hurricane
