Tear the veins from ivory limb
Smooth as shards of porcelain
Slip between the talons
Raking guts across the coals
Clamp teeth 'pon burnished knuckles
Bite down hard! Don't let go!

They owe you what you are!
Pay in blood for every scar!
Bathe in spray of Ã¼berflow
In Maestrobator's afterblow

Bind your wounds with crimson wires
Knot your bone quench desires
They owe you each last drop!
Of ejaculate crotch shot!
The damned will dance on every grave
Chastity shall misbehave

Slip between the talons
Raking guts across the coals
Clamp teeth 'pon burnished knuckles
Bite down hard! Don't let go!

Laterigrade's the way to grow
Claim the stageâthe realm I know
Striving highâswooping low
Stride out wide enslave the show!
