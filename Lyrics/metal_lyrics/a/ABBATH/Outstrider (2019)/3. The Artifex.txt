Reclined in swathe of bedlam's grimoires
Sheathes of ancient vellum cradle skull
Sigils scour sallow skin, copper veins
Drip gnosis, draw mind from mortal lull

I pluck the stitches, stun the senses
Milk the pain I graze
I storm the portals of dead immortals
Trapped in yesterdaze
I dive to new depths, plunder sunk wrecks
In culp of fetid drain
I seek the artifex, disenchant hex
To lift this curse of Cain!

Artifex absorb a corpus
Alchemy in limbic vortex
Archetype bequeath a gene
To murder Eden, dismember dream

Beyond arc of reaper's lethal grace
The shade of Cain shrives guilt in mud
And golems raised all display his slain
Brother's bludgeoned face
