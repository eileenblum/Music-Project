Ashes of the Damned - bourne on pestilential winds
Zephyrs flay the sky - cinders bath in blaze
Scorch raw starry vault - Above the earth accursed
Carnage beyond despair - souls seared in gaze.
Embers of warriors - fuel legends heroes bled
Seidmen weep the tears Valkyries fear to shed.

Ashes of the Damned

Serpent-tongue sick with thirst - in thy venom we immerse.
Necrotic Lord Bless Our Chains - baptise heathen flesh in flames.
But free of all Rapture's stain. From ash The Damned will rise again!

Rats, spread deadly spore - bubonic swarm.
Claws, of vermin rake - ancient graves.
Belch, necrotic maw - kisses blistering.
Melt, Death's face to yours - Decay with Grace.

Frost, bite iron lung - demonic storm.
Spit, last heathen words - against the hail.
Flesh, raise heavy chains - curse the skies.
Spark, suck lightening strike - the final nail.

Ashes of the Damned - bourne on pestilential winds
Zephyrs flay the sky - cinders bath in blaze
Scorch raw starry vault - Above the earth accursed
Carnage beyond despair - souls seared in gaze.
