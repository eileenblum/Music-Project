Damnation calls
Final blasts close the earth
Immortal victory
Winters bane upon the masses
Snow spiraling towards auroral clouds
Clear nebulous visions sight
Soulwinds fall into the dark ice realms
Where you now reach far

Blackwinged ravens cry for tragedies to come
Lurking with snowfall
By doom they drag the robe of ice
Frozen of heart you now reach far

In the nebular ravens winter
Winds are known from where they blow
Nebular ravens winter
Strength comes from us above

Ravens season has begun
Melancholic ageless and unknown
Mesmerized you fall in our domain
Freezing in the heart

Sojourn from the elder ravens
Beauteous winter birth
An eerie mage
Emblazoned with the biting winds
Damnation calls
With staring glowing yearning eyes
Poised they strike again and drag
Us all below

In the nebular ravens winter
Winds are known from where they blow
Nebular ravens winter
Might bestowed from us above

Ravens season has begun
Melancholic ageless and unknown
Mesmerized you fall in our domain

Inhale the effluence of the demonworlds
Freezing in the heart
