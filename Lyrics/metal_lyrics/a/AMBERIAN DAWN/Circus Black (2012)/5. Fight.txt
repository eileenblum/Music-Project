You doubt is haunting, still you wait for the truth,
Can't see the victim's you.
You try to compromise, fate throws the dice,
Your soul is turning grey.

[Chorus:]
Fight!
Or run though your life
Face your enemies
Stand up for yourself and just believe
The fear is just inside but it's hard to find.
Use your anger to fight for your will!

The darkness frightens, shadows whisper,
The evil's hunting you.
Sometimes you're certain it is still near
Wishing for you to fall.

[Chorus]

[Guitar Solo Kimmo]
