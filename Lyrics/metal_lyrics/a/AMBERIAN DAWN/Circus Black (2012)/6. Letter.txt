No longer frustration, no more I'm listening to this.
Too many moments I have shared someone else's dreams.
It took time to make up my mind,
But when you say these things I'm certain that
I deserve much better!

[Chorus:]
You see greatness lives inside
It is truthful for the mind
Greatness lives inside
It's not yours to take.
It is helping ones in need
Giving value for a friend
You have got it wrong - these things you're not!

For nothing I tried to please you by staying in the shades.
By doing all the things your way, like you say,
But where's my dream?
I tried to tell you a thousand times
That if you do these things just your way,
I'll continue my own way.

[Chorus]
