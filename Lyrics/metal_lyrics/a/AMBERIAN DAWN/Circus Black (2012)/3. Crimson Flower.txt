[feat. Jens Johansson]Once upon a time in a distand land,
A merchant had three daughters.
They asked different gifts from their old father:
A golden crown, a crystal mirror and the last one,
A little scarlet flower.

[Chorus:]
The crimson flower is hard to find
A magical forest keeps it inside.
If he picks it then the beast will take his daughter.
The crimson flower lies there within
So does the heart of the beast and deep
In his mind he fears that no one will break the spell.

Then the old man's youngest daughter
Went alone into the forest
And she found the castle where she would stay eternally
There in time she fell in love with her silent keeper.

[Chorus]
