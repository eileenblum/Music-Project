[Guest male voice: Nils Nordling (verse &amp; chorus)]
[Guest male voice: Tuomas Nieminen (chorus)]I'm watching the waves that pass by
Watching the clouds that make me
Dream that I'm falling
Into the ocean of the sky
Watching the autumn of my life
And now finally I see the truth.

[Chorus:]
Blue sea
The spring of human souls
We're children of the sea
The horizon's our home
We're children of the sea
You'll see blue sea in our eyes
We're children of the sea
Twice we play with the sun.
- I share with you this dream.

I'm floating through forests of the sea
Meeting the creatures in the deepest abyss.
I'm starting to understand why they changed the
Ocean to the sky above
- To be closer to the sun!

[Chorus]
