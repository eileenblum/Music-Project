Into the wilderness the child now wanders.
The guardian next to her safely guides her back home.
Far away is her home and she is frightened,
Dark is the forest path back to her own loving home.

[Chorus:]
See how the light spreads her wings and
Shields this child with light 'cause
Dark is the night
And innocent the child.
See the bright light on the path it
Shines through your heart!
How could the child fall
Without the guardian on her side.

Dark is the forest, the shadows are moving.
The fir trees are whispering in the night wind, and the
Hungry beasts lurk behind the light circle.
This light is the shelter for her lonely journey home.

[Chorus]
