One thousand years ago by the mountain side
I lived like a ghost with my green-eyed horses

I grieved for my fiancÃ© in a gown pearly white
I cried by the river calling ancient forces

Tears blending with the water
I said the words and wished for the final answer

Beautiful magic river
Beautiful magic river
Show me what I wish for:
My only love I seek
The only place to be
The price you ask I will pay to thee

The surface of the water was calm for a while
I hoped the river would show the right direction

Trying to say those words again, my tears streaming down
The only thing I saw was my own reflection

Fears blending with the water
Those words were never the final answer

Beautiful magic river
Beautiful magic river
Show me what I wish for:
My only love I seek
The only place to be
The price you ask I will pay to thee
