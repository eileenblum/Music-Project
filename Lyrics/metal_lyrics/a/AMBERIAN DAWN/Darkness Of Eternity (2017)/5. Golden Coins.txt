Twilight comes holding a map to an endless highway
Only lost souls stay looking for shelter
Just the scent of a melted candle dares stay inside
Where all the clowns circle the ring hearing the entertainers
Sing

Oo-oo come and see us
Golden coins will free us
So you pay to see us
Take your seat and dream the carnival is here

Oo-oo come and see us
Golden coins will free us
So you pay to see us
Take your seat and dream the carnival is staying in town

Painted veils cover the scene of missing memories
The black stripes hang seeming alive
A lonely wolf walks by the ringside serving false remorse
Where all the clowns circle the ring hearing the entertainers
Sing

Oo-oo come and see us
Golden coins will free us
So you pay to see us
Take your seat and dream the carnival is here

Oo-oo come and see us
Golden coins will free us
So you pay to see us
Take your seat and dream the carnival is staying in town

The last dance, the last song
Too much to grieve for, too much to pay for
No more

Oo-oo come and see us
Golden coins will free us
So you pay to see us
Take your seat and dream the carnival is here

Oo-oo come and see us
Golden coins will free us
So you pay to see us
Take your seat and dream the carnival is staying in town
