I hear the gasp of dying light
And feel the coldness coming nigh
I know it's time to say goodbye
To all the stories for bedtime
Oh, I try so hard to stop the tears from falling

The days of the sun no more time to come
The tears like pearls need their way to run
I feel alive my work is done
Something different has begun

Come and dance the waltz with me
So softly, so sighing
Darkness of eternity
All curtains, all blending
Come and dance the waltz with me
So softly, so gently,
One two three echoes on these sealed walls

The night has come, the afterlife
When morning comes I need to hide
I feel the cold, I'm not that weak
I feel the power of a missing beat
Oh, I tried so hard not to hear darkness call

This night I died or so they think
I am not dead or a living thing
The gasp of light no longer be
Another story to begin

Come and dance the waltz with me
So softly, so sighing
Darkness of eternity
All curtains, all blending
Come and dance the waltz with me
So softly, so gently,
One two three you can hear my silent call

The night has come, the afterlife
I feel the coldness coming nigh
I hear the gasp of dying light
I know it's time to say goodbye
Oh, one two three echoes on these sealed walls
