I'm standing in front of the bridge of tomorrow
Fear is keeping me still facing yesterday's sorrow
Feeling alive seems like a faraway unknown dream
Asking the question is happiness not my scene

Sleepless nights
My downcast mind is praying for
Re-finding the rising morning sun
Sleepless nights
My downcast mind is praying for
Re-finding the rising morning sun, anyone

After the storm only unknown silence
Nobody cares, no-one's asking for forgiveness
All the hope, it is gone, washed away with rain
Everything's faded, all that is left is pain

Sleepless nights
My downcast mind is praying for
Re-finding the rising morning sun
Sleepless nights
My downcast mind is praying for
Re-finding the rising morning sun, anyone

[Guitar solo: Emil]

Sleepless nights
My downcast mind is praying for
Re-finding the rising morning sun
Sleepless nights
My downcast mind is praying for
Re-finding the rising morning sun, anyone
