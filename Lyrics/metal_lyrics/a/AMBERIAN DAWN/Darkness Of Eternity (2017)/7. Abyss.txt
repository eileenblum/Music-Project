I walk in peace, you don't
We've been circling our love, for so long,
Our time in silent, quiet moments.

Wanting to run away
We hide in the dust of storms
The world has turned upside down

You're looking into yourself too much
Out of my reach without my touch
It will only take unto a lonelier place inside our demons

I will comfort you my love, never ask me why
Time will heal your heart my love, as time goes by

Our thoughts are meaningless
Feeling numb again we walk alone
'Cause in total silence nothing matters

In this black nothingness
We're waiting for release
Wondering if what we had will ever come back

It doesn't kill you but it scars
We are leaving behind the past
And we will learn again to be without our demons

I will comfort you my love, never ask me why
Time will heal your heart my love, as time goes by

I will comfort you my love, never ask me why
Time will heal your heart my love, as time goes by
I will wait for you my love, 'til the end of time
The time is right for us my love when your heart is not numb
