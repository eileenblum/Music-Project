Almost morning still dark is the sky
A timeless space for you and I
We touch the stars with our fingertips
Luna my darling

Soft and silent the time we had
Missing hours that never last
Whispering stars of the night we trust
Luna my darling

Higher
Under the sky we hide tonight
The stars are calling
Fire
Feeling the night is not enough
Our eyes asking for more
Closer and just hold me, hold me
The stars hide the lovers tonight

Once in my lifetime there's so much to give
So much to live in stolen moment
Asking now for another way not to feel pain
'Cause sorrow helps morning light guide the night away

Quietly spoken forbidden words
Safe and sound, nothing hurts
Touching the lips with our fingertips
Luna my darling

Burning fire like there never was
Sighing words of the falling stars
Already crying when we saw the light
Luna my darling

Under the spell we ride tonight
The stars are falling
Knowing the time is not enough
Our soul asking for more
Come and take me closer, closer
The stats hide the lovers tonight

Once in my lifetime there's so much to give
So much to live in stolen moment
Asking now for another way not to feel pain
'Cause sorrow helps morning light guide the night away

Once in my lifetime it all will change
And we will stay in stolen moment
Asking the stars something to give
A moment to live
'Cause we feel th pain when light guides the night away
