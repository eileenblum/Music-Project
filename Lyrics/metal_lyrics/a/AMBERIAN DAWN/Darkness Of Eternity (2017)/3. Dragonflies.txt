Hiding in the nighest tree
Waiting for the morning
Dreaming 'bout the evil queen
Shade is sleeping

Thinking 'bout all the years
Of serving and fighting
While playing hide and seek
Shade is awakening
It's the beginning of a new era

Game on
Fly with me my dragonflies
Lash with your wings of sorrow 'til tomorrow
Game on
Fight with me dragonflies
Sing with your golden tone and let your raging
Fire burn

Planning for the silent move
To kill the evil queen
Scouting the destroyed land
Shade is stalking

Leading his trusted men
Quietly seeking
Destruction of the kingdom
Bu he is failing
It's the beginning of a new era

Game on
Fly with me my dragonflies
Lash with your wings of sorrow 'til tomorrow
Game on
Fight with me dragonflies
Sing with your golden tone and let your raging
Fire burn

[Keyboard solo: Tuomas]

Now all behold
Shade's fallen down
Wings torn apart
He went beyond the point of no return

Game on
Fly with me my dragonflies
Lash with your wings of sorrow 'til tomorrow
Game on
Fight with me dragonflies
Sing with your golden tone and let your raging
Fire burn
