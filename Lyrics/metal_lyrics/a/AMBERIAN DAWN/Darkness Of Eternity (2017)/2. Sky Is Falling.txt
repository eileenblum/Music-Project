The silver line in the melted sky
Sways its coldness next to me
Back and forth never asking me why
The heavy air is closing in

The smell of desperation's floating by
Leaving darkness to hold me
Round and round the silent silver line
Closing in distressing me

In a war of clarifying northern lights are dying
Drip drop the tears are falling
The missing color line, there's something so clandestine
Drip drop the sky is falling
Sealing the gates for thousands of years
Making silver ashes faded
Guarding all hope from endless fears
Watering the empty shell for nothing
This time the last word is loneliness

Dying colors of the northern sky
Almost nothing to be seen
Up and down the comets drifting by
The air is heavy to breathe

The fading line of melted minds
Grieving darkness holds me
Back and forth, never asking me why
The world is dead to me

In a war of clarifying northern lights are dying
Drip drop the tears are falling
The missing color line, there's something so clandestine
Drip drop the sky is falling
Sealing the gates for thousands of years
Making silver ashes faded
Guarding all hope from endless fears
Watering the empty shell for nothing
This time the last word is loneliness

In a war of clarifying northern lights are dying
Drip drop the tears are falling
The missing color line, there's something so clandestine
Drip drop the sky is falling
Sealing the gates for thousands of years
Making silver ashes faded
Guarding all hope from endless fears
Watering the empty shell for nothing
This time the last word is loneliness
