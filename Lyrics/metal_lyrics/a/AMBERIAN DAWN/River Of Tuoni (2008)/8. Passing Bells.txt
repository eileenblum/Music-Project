Passing Bells
Call for me
In my shroud
I'm sentenced to death

Passing Bells
Call for me
In my shroud
I wait for final call

When the morning comes
I will hear the death drums
Calls for me the last march
Calls for me the last march

At the dead's door
I will feel no agony
And I'll accept my destiny
I'll accept my destiny

Passing Bells
Call for me
In my shroud
I'm sentenced to death

Passing Bells
Call for me
In my shroud
I wait for final call

For the last time
I will see the sky at morn
And walking towards ending
Walking towards ending

Still feel ?
Until I breathe my final breath
At last I will be free
At last I will be free
