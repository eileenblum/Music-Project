Wind is blowing through my wounded soul
Darkness shades me as I'm longing and yearning
Darkness surrounds me swallowing me into endless night

[Refrain:]
Watching the moonlight
Waiting for sunrise
To bring the light into night!

Like a white rider
Riding on sun-rays
To take me back into light
Into light

Warm my soul and melt the ice of my heart
Melt the snow which covers up my broken chest
Poor heart is frozen longing for sunrise to melt the ice

[Refrain:]
Watching the moonlight
Waiting for sunrise
To bring the light into night!

Like a white rider
Riding on sun-rays
To take me back into light
Into light
