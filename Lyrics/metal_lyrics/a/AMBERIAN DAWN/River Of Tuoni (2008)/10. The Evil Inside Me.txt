Oh Father, now hear me! This sinner on her knees!
Oh Father, now hear me! This sinner on her knees!

When I turn my head towards your light I see this shadow
shading my eyes, fear I can't hide, evil's after my soul!
Dominating all my thoughts evil takes my soul.
Fear I cannot hide how dark pulls me away from your light!

Oh Father, come save me! The evil's after me!
Oh Father, come save me! The evil's after me!

Evil lurks under my skin there dwells an enemy within.
I am the worst what I fear - I'm the evil that is near.
Father hear me, evil's in me - I pray to save my soul!
Fear I cannot hide how dark pulls me away from your light!

Gloria Patri, et Filio, et Spiritui Sancto.
Sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper, et in saecula saeculorum.
Amen.

Oh Father, come save me! The evil's after me!
Oh Father, come save me! The evil's after me!

Evil lurks under my skin there dwells an enemy within.
I am the worst what I fear - I'm the evil that is near.
Father hear me, evil's in me - I pray to save my soul!
Fear I cannot hide how dark pulls me away from your light!
