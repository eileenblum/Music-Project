Spent years in tears
Drowned myself in fears
Lived in a cage filling
My life with rage

Tied my wings so tightly
Gravity felt mighty
Needed to feel the wind
Under my wings

[Refrain (2x):]
My wings are my eyes
I'm seeing the blue skies
I'll fly, I'll fly away
And will find my way

Lost the joy of living
Closed myself from feeling
Lost the ability to fly and flee

Left my world with tears
Iron cage with fears
Strengthened my wings
Now I'm learning to fly

[Refrain]
