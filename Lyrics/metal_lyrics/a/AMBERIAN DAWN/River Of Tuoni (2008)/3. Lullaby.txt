Deep in the earth land of dead...... the dead are welcoming their king!
Deep in the earth lies a new born baby boy...

Hush, o precious child! Among the dead you rest in peace.
Hush, o infant king! The dead salute the son of darkness!
Hush, o precious child! Among the dead you rest in peace.
Hush, o infant king! The dead salute the son of darkness!

Ruler of dead sleep on the breast of the beast......... the corpses are ready and awake!
Doom shall face Earth upon your ascension......

Hush, o precious child! Among the dead you rest in peace
Hush, o infant king! The dead salute the son of darkness!
Hush, o precious child! Among the dead you rest in peace
Hush, o infant king! The dead salute the son of darkness!

You black-souled son of mine you'll reign the mighty kingdom of the dead
You'll make your mother proud, so sleep and dream until comes Night!

Hush, o precious child! Among the dead you rest in peace
Hush, o infant king! The dead salute the son of darkness!
Hush, o precious child! Among the dead you rest in peace
Hush, o infant king! The dead salute the son of darkness!
