Ravens over battlefield are marking the chosen
brave northern warriors to their last fight.

Shieldmaidens ride the wolves in the sky with ravens
scouting the battleground for souls of slain heroes.

Choosers of slain...

Valkyries ride through the night sky
singing fierce battle-cries,
Valkyries, choosers of slain, come ride their wolves!

Howling wolves in the night carrying female deities
escort the dead warriors to Odin's hall.

Armour of Valkyries flashes up over the skies
shading a strange light - the northern lights!

Choosers of slain...

Valkyries ride through the night sky
singing fierce battle-cries,
Valkyries, choosers of slain, come ride their wolves!
