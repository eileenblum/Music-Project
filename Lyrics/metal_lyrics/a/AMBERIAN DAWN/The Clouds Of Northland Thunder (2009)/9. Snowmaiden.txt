Made of snow is her heart and her soul,
living only from winter ice and the breeze, so cold.

Daughter of Spring and Frost,
no warmth in her heart.
Daughter of Spring and Frost
no warmth in her heart until he came?

Lel- oh- Lel -oh -Lel - play your flute again!
Spring, warmth and sun will come and soon
they will melt her heart!

Spring came brighter and paler she grew,
tears rolled down from her eyes springing streams new.

Daughter of Spring and Frost,
no warmth in her heart.
Daughter of Spring and Frost
no warmth in her heart until he came?

Lel- oh- Lel -oh -Lel - play your flute again!
Spring, warmth and sun will come and soon
they will melt her heart!

There she stood before Lel barely alive,
falling onto the damp earth she looked at the sky.

Made of snow was her heart and her soul,
living only from winter ice and the breeze cold.

Daughter of Spring and Frost,
no warmth in her heart.
Daughter of Spring and Frost
no warmth in her heart until he came?

Lel- oh- Lel -oh -Lel - play your flute again!
Spring, warmth and sun will come and soon
they will melt her heart!

She vanished and a light mist rose slowly to the blue sky
