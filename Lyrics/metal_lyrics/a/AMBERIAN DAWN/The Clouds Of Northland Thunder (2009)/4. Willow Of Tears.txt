In the shades of
The verdant forest
Tender and mild winds
Are washing the leaves

Echoing whispers
Lead me to valley
Where a tree stands in
A silver dress

[Chorus:]
Leaves shaped of tears
Of sorrow and lonely tears
Gleaming in the light
Of the rising sun
The silvery leaves are
Covering all my tears
As I sit under
The Willow Of Tears

Whispers are calling
In Beaming dreamy air
On the meadow where
The willow and I

Wait for the mist to come
To dance on silver pond
It slowly guides us
To eternal sleep

[Chorus]

[Solo: Kasperi]

[Chorus]
