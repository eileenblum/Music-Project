Before the Era of the human
The seven mighty bears
Ruled the northern land with firm hands.

From the fellowship with human
Were born the seven sons
Who would people the cold Northland.

"They fled this world to the stars leaving their lands to their newborn sons!"

Under seven stars,
Seven stars of Great Bear,
Grew the Seven Sons of
Mighty bruin and man.

In stars the souls were raised,
Souls were raised to our land.
Sons of Seven Stars
Mighty bruin and brave man!

In the veins of these young men
Ran blood as thick as tar
Fiery souls hungered to woodlands.

Through the dark backwoods they wandered
And with only bare hands
They ploughed the frozen, poor land.

"Force of the claws in their hands,
Human hearts lived for their firtree lands!"

Under seven stars,
Seven stars of Great Bear,
Grew the Seven Sons of
Mighty bruin and man.

In stars the souls were raised,
Souls were raised to our land.
Sons of Seven Stars
Mighty bruin and brave man!
