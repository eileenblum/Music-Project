In the early sky
I see the light of the Morning star
shining bright, and
from the open ground
I hear the harmony of voices singing far away.

Follow the light,
it will lead your way to harmony!
Follow the light,
with only one reach you can touch the First light!

Purity, eternal shine - power of the Morning star!
Harmony of colours are shining the eternal light.

To the sky I send my light,
join the power of the morning star and
wholeness of the greatness
Sun and Stars, the Milkyway in the wide Universe!

Follow the light,
it will lead your way to harmony!
Follow the light,
with only one reach you can touch the First light!

Purity, eternal shine - power of the Morning star!
Harmony of colours are shining the eternal light.
