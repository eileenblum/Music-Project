He's lonely and waiting for his beloved one.
Time passes and no one's coming to shore.
Now yearning and longing he takes the offer.
The sea is seducing and promising more.

"Sleep now my love
Let the soft waves carry you.
Float in silently and fall asleep."

Come now follow...follow me into the sea!
Come now follow...
Come now follow and I will sing you into soothing sleep.
Come now follow...hear the Sea singing!
Come now follow...
He's willingly changing into the ocean's young groom.

He's looking at the sea, the rain is raging.
His heart is lamenting, clouded by tears.
Longing for loving he hurls himself to depths
Not seeing the white sails coming to shore.

"Sleep now my love
Let the soft waves carry you.
Float in silently and fall asleep."

Come now follow...follow me into the sea!
Come now follow...
Come follow and I will sing you into soothing sleep.
Come now follow...hear the Sea singing!
Come now follow...
He's willingly changing into the ocean's young groom.
