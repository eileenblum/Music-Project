Look behind the closed doors,
Search in the empty drawers
What you're looking for you shall not ever find.
The secret is hidden from the greedy eyes,
Possessive hands and selfish minds of foolish and ignorant men.

Still it is followed â the fools for the power!
"Talisman behind many wars and its greedy eye wants more.
Stars are sad for the children's blood and crying!"

See the shimmer of the golden piece, 
The beauty of the necklace against your pale young skin
Does it make you glad?
None of the beauty of the jewels shall you take into your tomb,
The earthly bed is equally cold for our human bones.

Fight for the glory despite other's worry!
"Talisman behind many wars and its greedy eye wants more.
Stars are sad for the children's blood and crying!"

"Talisman behind many wars and its greedy eye wants more.
Stary are sad for the children's blood and crying!"
