After God created man he called for the angels
To fly down on Earth and bow before his creation.
Driven by his pride this angel made his plans
Against God and all the angel's force,
Gathered his own army of the fallen angels
To strive for the highest seat of God!

God and his angel forces
Encountered the power of fallen angel army
And a war arose in heaven
 â Michael and his angels fought the dragon!
No longer place in heaven,
He was thrown down to Earth with all his angels.
Misusing the free will of the mind
He signed himself a place in Hell!

[Sataniel:]
I won't yield before a man!
I won't yield before a man!
I won't yield before a man!

Sataniel being one of the highest Archangels
Fount it too humbling by far, refused to obey.
In the third heaven the harmony of angels
Was disturbed by a deceiver
Who convinced some angels to join him
And he seduced Eve from the shelter of God!

God and his angel forces
Encountered the power of fallen angel army
And a war arose in heaven
 â Michael and his angels fought the dragon!
No longer place in heaven,
He was thrown down to Earth with all his angels.
Misusing the free will of the mind
He signed himself a place in Hell!

[Sataniel:]
I won't yield before a man!
I won't yield before a man!
I won't yield before a man!

[Sataniel:]
I won't yield before a man!
I won't yield before a man!
I won't yield before a man!
