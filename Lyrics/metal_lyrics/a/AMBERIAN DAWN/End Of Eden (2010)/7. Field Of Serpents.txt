Forge thyself a golden plowshare,
Forge the beam and mail of silver.
Ant the with ease
Thou can plow the field of serpents,
Plow the field of hissing vipers
 â plow the soil of evil Hisi!

I'll hunt thine ancient mother of evil,
Hunt thine origin, o hissing serpent
 â vilest thing of god's create
SyÃ¶jÃ¤tÃ¤r, ancient mother, thy creator
 â this is thine origin!

Serpents there of every species,
Lempo furrowed it with the white horses
And his plowshare!
With a beam of flaming iron!
Never since has a northern hero
Brought this field to cultivation.

I'll hunt thine ancient mother of evil,
Hunt thine origin, o hissing serpent
 â vilest thing of god's create
SyÃ¶jÃ¤tÃ¤r, ancient mother, thy creator
 â this is thine origin!

Get thee hence, thou loathsome monster,
Clear the pathway of this hero!

I'll hunt thine ancient mother of evil,
Hunt thine origin, o hissing serpent
 â vilest thing of god's create
SyÃ¶jÃ¤tÃ¤r, ancient mother, thy creator
 â this is thine origin!
