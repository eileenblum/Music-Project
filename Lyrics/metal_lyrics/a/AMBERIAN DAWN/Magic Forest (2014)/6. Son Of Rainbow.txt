At the end of June
From dawn to dusk, in vain
The five brothers are waiting for the rain

Calling for the raindrops
Singing songs without words
Hoping soothing sparkly raindrops'll
Reach their world

Ha-i-ja-i-ja-i-jaa-i-ja-i-ja-i-jaa
Slide down the rainbow
Ha-i-ja-i-ja-i-jaa-i-ja-i-ja-i-jaa
Only once you go

One of the five brothers
Makes a promise to the rain
It's the one and only fateful wish to make

Shine in five colours
Have your last pouring rain
Take the colours of the rainbow to their place

Ha-i-ja-i-ja-i-jaa-i-ja-i-ja-i-jaa
Slide down the rainbow
Ha-i-ja-i-ja-i-jaa-i-ja-i-ja-i-jaa
Only once you go

Ha-i-ja-i-ja-i-jaa-i-ja-i-ja-i-jaa
Slide down the rainbow
Ha-i-ja-i-ja-i-jaa-i-ja-i-ja-i-jaa
Only once you go
