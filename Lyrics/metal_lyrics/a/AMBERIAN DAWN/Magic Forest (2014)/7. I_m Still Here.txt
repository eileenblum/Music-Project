I'm hearing your heartbeat
My awaited changeling
Everlasting moments, no a sound,
Tell me we'll never meet, my son

Your picture is blurring,
My fading changeling
I'm forever drifting aimlessly
For the day you signed your life away

Can you hear me?
I'm still here.

My changeling
My changeling

Your steps fading away
My wandering changeling
I can picture you in shiny stars
Only that way you are never far

Still hearing your heartbeat
My beloved changeling
In this feeling that is full of grief
I am spent for eternity

Can you hear me?
I'm still here.

My changeling
My changeling

My changeling
My changeling
