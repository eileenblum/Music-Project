Pictures that adorn the wall
Cryptic writings guide you through
Find the path and pay the price
Godspeed, my king

Through the mirror and through the wall
Let your mind seek a lot more
Find the path and pay the price
Farewell, my queen

I will see you again in time, my king, in time
I will see you again in time, my queen, in time

Hidden lines of secret words
Walls of painted grey figures
Find the path and pay the price
Farewell, my king

Part of a tale she lost her crown
Inheritance of her bloodline
Find the path and pay the price
Godspeed, my queen

I will see you again in time, my king, in time
I will see you again in time, my queen, in time

By the mountain lie we two
Underneath the grey gravestone
The path is solved and price is paid
Memorial

I will see you again in time, my king, in time
I will see you again in time, my queen, in time
