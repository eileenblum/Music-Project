There was a time
You were everyone's confidant
Your mind was full of the torment
To be the one

Their complaints tortured you
With every spoken word
That made you crawl

Secrets, you'll hear alarming secrets
Those words will kill your inner self
Silence, your time in endless silence
Will never ever end

Secrets, you'll hear countless secrets
Those words will kill your inner self
Quiet, be quiet
Your time in silence
Will never ever end

Their need to talk
Gives a lifetime of misery,
Remorse of telling
With life full of enmity

They had to silence you
With needle and thread
They sew your mouth

Secrets, you'll hear alarming secrets
Those words will kill your inner self
Silence, your time in endless silence
Will never ever end

Secrets, you'll hear countless secrets
Those words will kill your inner self
Quiet, be quiet
Your time in silence
Will never ever end

Secrets, you'll hear alarming secrets
Those words will kill your inner self
Silence, your time in endless silence
Will never ever end

Secrets, you'll hear countless secrets
Those words will kill your inner self
Quiet, be quiet
Your time in silence
Will never ever end
