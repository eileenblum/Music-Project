In your dreams you are invited
Only a few can hear their calling
Wake up, you girl, they're sent for you
Blue sea is going to capture you

You're going to sing with us, green-eyed
We're going to lure you here
Waving drowsy waves
Seeking for broken hearts, wanderers waving goodbye
For the last time

I can hear my thoughts, I'm aching recollections from past life
Waves pull me down, I'm scared I will die
I'm paralyzed inside my mind

You're going to sing with us, green-eyed
We're going to lure you here
Waving drowsy waves
Seeking for broken hearts, wanderers waving goodbye
For the last time

[Guitar and keyboard solos - Tuomas]

I'm going to sing with the green-eyed
I'm going to lure you here

I'm going to sing with the green-eyed
I'm going to lure you here
Chanting drowsy waves
Seeking for broken hearts, wanderers waving goodbye;
I'm sorry
