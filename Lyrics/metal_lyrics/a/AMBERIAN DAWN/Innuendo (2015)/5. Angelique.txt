Say my name
Give me salvation
In this world I pray

Say my name
Give me redemption
In this world
Unforgiven soul I am
Unforgiven soul I am
Unforgiven soul I am

Piece by piece you gathered me
Still I wasn't the same
One piece was shattered in the sea

Word by word you questioned me
I didn't know my name
My life had vanished into the sea

Please, say my name
You only have to say three words to give me life

Say my name
Give me salvation
In this world I pray

Say my name
Give me redemption
In this world
Unforgiven soul I am
Unforgiven soul I am
Now forgiven soul I am

Day by day you carried me
Still I wasn't the same
One piece was grieving for the sea

And the day you questioned me
Your words: "Please, marry me"
And life was finally by the sea

Please, say my name
You only have to say those words to give me life

You said my name
You only had to say those words
You give me life

You said my name, gave me salvation
In your world
Unforgiven soul I am
Now forgiven soul I am
Angelique la Mer I am.
