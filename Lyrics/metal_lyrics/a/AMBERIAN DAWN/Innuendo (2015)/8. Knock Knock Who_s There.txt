If I take my time
I should get it right
I could hear a sound of knocking
There's no one near, nothing to fear
I just wait a while

I sit and I wait
Should I have escaped
I keep staring at the wall
There's no one here, still I can hear
The opening door

Step or two lead to the wall
Three and four
I start falling

Someone is knocking on the door
I hear you, winterstorm
Open your world, I want to play along
What is winter like?
Castles built of ice?
Show me, I wanna know

Someone is knocking on the door
I am the girl of the sun
Open your world, I want to have some fun
I know what summer is like
How the water shines
Show me, I wanna know!

White, icy and cold
The crust of snow
This has to be a winter morning
Smile on each face in the middle of chase
Like a beautiful dream

Icy fields and more
I stumble and fall
Knowing it's the best time of my life
This is winter time
More icy rides:
I wanna go

Feeling on top of the world
Whiff of cold
Now I am falling

Someone is knocking on the door
I hear you, winterstorm
Open your world, I want to play along
What is winter like?
Castles built of ice?
Show me, I wanna know

Someone is knocking on the door
I am the girl of the sun
Open your world, I want to have some fun
I know what summer is like
How the water shines
Show me, I wanna know!
