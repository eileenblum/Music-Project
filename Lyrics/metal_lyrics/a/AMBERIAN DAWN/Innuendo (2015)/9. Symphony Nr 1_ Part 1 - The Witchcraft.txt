Midnight is quiet, nature listens
Far is the clamour of streets
Silence, the breath of wind
Perfect is the timing for the gathering

Living in the village
Light a heart, a young girl gambols in the field
Roaming, she finds an old rune
Visions in blood
Heed an old prophecy
There's going to be heat

Can you see?
All her rotten features
Can you see?
How disturbing to look at
Can you see?
Her guilty face's been eaten
Signs of bloodmade witchcraft

Can you see?
All her rotten features
Can you see?
How disturbing to look at
Can you see?
She's a wicked creature
Signs of bloodmade witchcraft

Judgement was made in the secret meeting
The elders preparing for the hunt
Fire, spears and pointy forks
Such a weird anomaly must leave the earth

Hounded in the village
Fear in heart, the young girl is running for her life
Crying, begging for help
Visions of blood
See an old prophecy
It's going to be real

Can you see?
All her rotten features
Can you see?
How disturbing to look at
Can you see?
Her guilty face's been eaten
Signs of bloodmade witchcraft

Can you see?
All her rotten features
Can you see?
How disturbing to look at
Can you see?
She's a wicked creature
Signs of bloodmade witchcraft

Surround her
Be careful keep your distance and beware
Do remember that she's a witch

She's dangerous
The capture of the creature must be done
We are convinced that she's a witch

It's so dark
I don't understand
What have I done?
I am so young just about to start to see...
The light...
