I wanted piece of the happiness
A young heart so eager to fly with the rest
I preened down my feathers and tired my best
To sneak out before my nightly rest

I held my breath
My heart was beating
Felt excited for my wings were truly open

In my early days my faith was strong
I had to tell myself to ease my yearning heart
In my darkest days my faith was gone
I has to teach myself to heal my broken heart

The sweet wind turned and carried me
See, my wings were open

Using my sight like a hawk they sent
I found the place where all they went
Soon I was sure that the night was all mine
I didn't know I needed to hide

I held my breath
The air was like a storm cloud
And again my wings were truly broken

In my early days my faith was strong
I had to tell myself to ease my yearning heart
In my darkest days my faith was gone
I has to teach myself to heal my broken heart

The sweet wind turned and carried me
See, my wings were broken

My feathers all like sodden
And bones, are all they broken?
I'll take my leap of faith
And relearn how to fly

In my early days my faith was strong
I had to tell myself to ease my yearning heart
In my darkest days my faith was gone
I has to teach myself to heal my broken heart

The sweet wind turned and carried me
See, my wings were broken.
