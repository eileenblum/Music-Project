I truly felt unworthy while you
You were the one who was feeding me with lies

You had your chance to hold me
And now the milestones will guide
I'm bitter but better
I feel like a winner

Heard feelings and regrets
Never again!
I hoped for revenge in the light of the moon
Heartbroken loneliness
Never again!
I lost my beloved one that night in June

Leave me alone
Don't want you near me
I fear the rise of the evil

Leave me alone
Don't stay beside me
I'll have the strength from upheavals
From now on

I had my chance to hurt you instead
Now I'm the one who is living in a lie

Only me who to turn to
And now watch me my love
I'm still better but bitter
I fired my gun

No feelings no regrets
Ever again
I lost my true love in the light of the moon

And when this story ends
There is no love
I took my revenge on that night in June

Leave me alone
Don't want you near me
I fear the rise of the evil

Leave me alone
Don't stay beside me
I'll have the strength from upheavals
From now on

Leave me alone
Don't want you near me
I fear the rise of the evil

Leave me alone
Don't stay beside me
I'll have the strength from upheavals
From now on.
