Welcome
Please, do enter to my court
Look at all these paintings
All these crystals
Could you stay all your life?

Moving slowly to the golden door
A peaceful voice she heard:
"Welcome to my court, my friend!"

Dancing shallow puppets, wedding bells
She heard that voice again:
"Let me introduce myself!"

The court is having a ball in dominos
I welcome you all
The mirrors on the walls show me who to adore
The wedding is on

The court is having a ball in mirror hall
I welcome you all
The paintings on the walls show you who to adore
The wedding is on

Look at him
He's been here long before
A noble:
"Pardon me, I'm the count of moan and grief"

To rule with him?
He's a sad and lonely man
"I'll give you all you yearn
I will prove our love will burn"

The court is having a ball in dominos
I welcome you all
The mirrors on the walls show me who to adore
The wedding is on

The court is having a ball in mirror hall
I welcome you all
The paintings on the walls show you who to adore
The wedding is on

Step into the light of a thousand chandeliers
Walk down the aisle
Give our wows
And I'm the countess now and forever

The court is having a ball in dominos
I welcome you all
The mirrors on the walls show me who to adore
The wedding is on

The court is having a ball in mirror hall
I welcome you all
The paintings on the walls show you who to adore
The wedding is on.
