I travel in time
There and back through the halo
Until the end of the light

I wear the veil of shadows
Dark, still ethereally light

Your time and my time
Soon will they combine
All our senses will be as one

My kind and your kind, no ending timeline
Peaceful and never-ending is a dividing line
When travelling in time

I stand in the light
Too divine when the rain falls
Calm is the break of the dawn

I wait at the edge of the halo
Now and till the end of time

Your time and my time
Soon will they combine
All our senses will be as one

My kind and your kind, no ending timeline
Peaceful and never-ending is a dividing line
When travelling in time.
