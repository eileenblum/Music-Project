Waiting blindfold for messages untold
The feelings is suffocating
The scheming mistress ignoring
Her own hosted one

Constantly gasping capturing ceiling
The rumours so mesmerizing
The weakening mistress is needing
Her will to be done

I keep my grieving to myself
I even fake my heart's glee

In my chamber I'm alone
Are my dreams to kill for?
I keep my distance my hate will grow
I never let them know...

Eyes are piercing, bones are aching
Prowling: her satisfaction
Grasping, paralyzing
Their lives will be mine

Horrendous feelings is so rewarding
Awareness is worth waiting
Secretly ended lives will be blended
In my insane mind

I keep my grieving to myself
I even fake my heart's glee

In my chamber I'm alone
Are my dreams to kill for?
I keep my distance my hate will grow
I never let them know...

I keep my grieving to myself
I even fake my heart's glee

In my chamber I'm alone
Are my dreams to kill for?
I keep my distance my hate will grow
I never let them know...

In my chamber I'm alone
Are my dreams to kill for?
I keep my distance my hate will grow
I never let them know...
