In seven cycles
The living hell is finally over now
It's time to have the closure now
Somehow

Too many bygones
The true resistance is getting stronger now
Can't bear it any longer now

You're an addict to this time
Your only known reality
The truth you'll never realize
The sand in your hourglass is draining to it's end
However I try you're blind to my infinity

(Truth you'll never realize)

Is my life perfect?
Is melting water even true?
I guess the time is tricking me again
Somehow

The seven cycles
The time I live in, is it true?
A bliss?
A greater heart?
I'm getting there

You're an addict to this time
Your only known reality
The truth you'll never realize
The sand in your hourglass is draining to it's end
However I try you're blind to my infinity

(Truth you'll never realize)

Look how the time gives us smiles
Hints a reason for you to survive
Descending lower and lower
Reflections in water you almost can see
That's why you think life could be a devious Innuendo

You're an addict to this time
Your only known reality
The truth you'll never realize
The sand in your hourglass is draining to it's end
However I try you're blind to my infinity

(Truth you'll never realize)
