Long long ago shiploads of golden arrows
Everything was ready for the war
White linen sails, the laughter on the deck
The black doves aboard

Dressed up as pirates women took their places
They were young and they were beautiful
Daggers and garters, cannon of pure grace
Prepare! Seize arms!
Get ready, they're coming!

Sea!
Give us your strength, lead the way
Moon!
Give us your light, show us the way
Wind!
Give us hope when the time comes
Home!
Give us the reason to fight

We're fighters, we're reckless
Hey ho!
We're all so fearless
We're after fame and gloria

We're drinking, we're tempting
Hey ho!
We're singing
We are enchanting warriors!

In the end you will all surrender!

The banner of black doves is feared across the seas
Women so graceful, silk and armony
Eyes on the horizon, minds of the coming fight
Again they shall prevail

The line of rifles and scent of powder
Ruthless and wild that's the way they are
Sweet victory it is their only aim
Again! Seize arms!
Get ready, they're coming

Sea!
Give us your strength, lead the way
Moon!
Give us your light, show us the way
Wind!
Give us hope when the time comes
Home!
Give us the reason to fight

We're fighters, we're reckless
Hey ho!
We're all so fearless
We're after fame and gloria

We're drinking, we're tempting
Hey ho!
We're singing
We are enchanting warriors!

In the end you will all surrender!
