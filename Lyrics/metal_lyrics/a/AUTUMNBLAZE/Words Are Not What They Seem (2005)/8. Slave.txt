It's such a perfect slave
I clearly feet the madness growing
Between her boiling veins
The mirrors laugh again
Somebody signs a song of doom and scare
A funny visionary

Hey you
I'm sure you wanna travel now

Hear what I offer you
Take these pills and your dreams will come true
See where you've travelled to
Straight in my arms
No one will find your crew

We can't predict when she'll collapse again
Her drowning face inside the lava flow

Hey you
I'm sure you wanna travel now

Hear what I offer you
Take these pills and your dreams will come true
See where you've travelled to
Straight in my arms
No one will find your crew

Hey you
I guess we should forget what happened
Hey you
We'll fly around the milky way

Call me â one night under the milky way
Save me â is there any place we could stay?
