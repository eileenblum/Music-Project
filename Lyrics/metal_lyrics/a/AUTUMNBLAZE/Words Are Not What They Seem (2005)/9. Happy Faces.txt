I've been walking through a burning town

Searching for a park of happy faces
A weeping man on the foul ground
Trying to smile without a reason

Happy faces have left the planet
Happy faces don't exist

He cried for help but I just said cold
I am not your saviour today
There was a moment when I saw his face
Sad without reproach
I hated myself

I've wandered many miles towards the sea
Demons of a weeping man behind
The streets are waves again, they bury me
I was never born to go ashore

Happy faces have left the planet
Happy faces don't exist
Happy faces have left our planet
Happy faces never existed
