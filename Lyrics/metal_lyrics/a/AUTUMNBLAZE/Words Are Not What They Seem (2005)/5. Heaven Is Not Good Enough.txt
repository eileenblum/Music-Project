You had so much time
To throw away these chains
To feel the cool touch of fading emptiness
Without a pilot you tried to fly
Escape from sleep... from sleep

You always land on the same cold place
When will you recognize
That all the things you do are wrong
At least you shouldn't wait too long

One day you lie in a white shroud

You'll feel heaven is not good enough
All words are lies of a black hole
Maybe life is just a bad joke

Tell me what's impossible
When you and me are real
When you and me are real

I don't understand you
I don't understand anything
