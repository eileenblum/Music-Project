Long ago the clouds were brighter
We rode on spanks
And darkness became a good friend
When doubts, thieves of colours
Piled up again
The rooms were strange
They seemed to be aware of my fear

Who was breaking in my mind to kill me
Who came along to take me away (to the river)

Now we're sitting here
Bowed like beggars
The clouds are low
We still wonder who payed the caravans
To the strange rooms

Who is breaking in my mind to kill me
Who comes along to drag me to the river
