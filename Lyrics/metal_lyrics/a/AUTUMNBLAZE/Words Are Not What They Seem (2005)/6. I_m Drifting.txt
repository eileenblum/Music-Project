Somewhere on a highway
I lost you in the darkness
Today it's like a mad dream
Of gloomy changes I never understood

You are unaware
Good girls seem to sleep

You tried to hate me on a highway
There was no sun behind red traffic lights

You are unaware
Good girls seem to sleep

He has saved me from the grey demon

Now I'm drifting
I've found my soul

Somewhere on a highway
I lost you for the last time

You are unaware
Good girls seem to sleep

He has saved me from the grey demon
Now I'm drifting
I've found my soul
