Try to forget what you know about me
There is no clue at all
Try to forget what you know about me
You won't decode the whole

Nothing has changed since you buried the trail
Afraid of being alone
Nothing has changed since you buried the trail
You won't decode the whole

Say, where is my soul?
Say, where is my soul?

Try to forget what you know about me
There is no clue in your world
Nothing has changed since you buried the trail
You won't decode the whole

Say, where is my soul?
Say, where is my soul?
Say, where is my soul?

You won't find me 'til you leave your dead trail
You won't see me when you look at me
