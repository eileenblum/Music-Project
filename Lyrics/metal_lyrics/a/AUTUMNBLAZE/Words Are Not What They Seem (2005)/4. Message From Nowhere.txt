Careful steps on the corridor
A sudden quiet in front of my door
I stand up with bated breath
Someone calls my name

You will fall in love

I lie in bed again, my shiver's gone
If I knew myself I'd be stunned

You will fall in love

Far from city lights and all that hurts

I'm thinking 'bout message from nowhere
