Visit yourself and tell me how you feel
Always I knew what you meant but now I don't know
I see the trembling veil of your soul and tears that never dry...never 
dry
Woe is me - sometimes I can't sleep at all
So close - the distance still grows
And sickness, our foe, still blows
I noticed your fragile thoughts and stars that changed their colours
We sat together so far away...so far away
Yesterday I sang a melody of autumn
In your hearse we'll rest tonight
Tränensaat am Seelengrab
Das Leben zerrinnt
Ein Tropfen im Wind
Narbenworte, Bruderpein
Ach! Wer errät mein trübes Sein?
So close...yet so far...yet so far...
