I sleep on a thin drowning rope
To burn inside the fragile sea
I saw you fall many days
My nights were cruel - windless boughs
To you I wrote fevered rhymes
Oppressive sounds inspired me
I am...
...scared of a moment that won't come
...scared of a landscape draped with clouds
...scared of a wilted envelope
...scared of your poem's parting verse
