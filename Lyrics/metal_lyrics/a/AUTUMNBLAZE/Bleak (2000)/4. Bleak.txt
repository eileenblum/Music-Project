My mind is bleak and toneless are these walls
Moments are passing by like trains that never stop
I think without a thought but somehow I think after all
The breath of nightly calm would cure my tumbling heart
You'd be frightened if you were here
To embrace my life - has to sear
The shore remains unmoved
By those rousing cries that are flirting with sleep
I've wandered to find
But still, still I'm not there
A journey so infinite
And still, still I'm not there
You'd be frightened if you were here
To encourage - life has to sear
