Music is drifting 
On invisable roads
Music is shelter
When your walls are grey again

[Chorus:]
Say, what do you feel when you listen to
a floating wave of moments
Say, what do you hear when you're alone
and the party is over

Music is naked
While you sing
Music is a cure
For a futile conversation

[Eldron, 4.10.2001]
