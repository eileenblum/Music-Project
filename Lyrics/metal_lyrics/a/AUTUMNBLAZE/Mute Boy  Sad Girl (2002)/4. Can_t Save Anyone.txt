I thought it was over but it never will be
There's always something left in the air - a blink of you
Too many nights we spent together
Too many secrets we told each other
I won't forget your look when everything was dead again
for a while, for a minute

[Chorus:]
Can't save anyone
I have tried to tell you that I'm too sad and scared
Can't save any sun
You have tried to do the same but I wasn't there

Do you remember when we laid on our balcony
The flowing sound of music all around
A perfect easiness
A perfect moment to trust
