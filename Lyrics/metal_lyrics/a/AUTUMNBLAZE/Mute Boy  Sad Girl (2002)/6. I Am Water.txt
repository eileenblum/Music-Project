There are days I feel as tired as the oldest man
An empty shadow in the park
I am a raindrop swimming on the window pane
It's always the same dull pain

I'm just here to drown

Before I go to sleep I try to think of something good
A permanent ocean and you

[Chorus:]
I am water
You only have to dive into me
I am water
My mute heart - a singing wave

Tomorrow is another chance to say nothing again
Someone could find me in the park

Am I just here to drown?
