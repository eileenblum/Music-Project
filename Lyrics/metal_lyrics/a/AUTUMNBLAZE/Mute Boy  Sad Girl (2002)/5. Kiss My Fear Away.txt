A wintry morning
Only me alone
Alone with unmourned thoughts
They couldn't speak anymore

A silent afternoon
Far, I heard your voice
And whispering snow
Fell like an elegy

[Chorus:]
O calmest sleep - kiss my fear away

A peaceful evening
I was engrossed in self-oblivion
I couldn't weep anymore

A brooding ode to the night
Of raging agony
It was bleak and cold
I couldn't laugh anymore

Those sufferings I have shed for you
Will cry as bleeding memories
I dream to burn this incureable song
But how could I ever live again?

[Eldron, Dezember1999]
