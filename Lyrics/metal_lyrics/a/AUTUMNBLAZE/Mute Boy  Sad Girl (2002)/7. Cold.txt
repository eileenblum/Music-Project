Scarred
Your back was turned
Curled like an embryo
Take another face
You will be blessed again
I was cold as I mouthed the words
And crawled across the mirror
I wait 
Await the next breath
Your name
Like ice into my heart

A shallow grave
A monument for the ruined age
Ice in my eyes
And eyes like ice don't move
Screaming at the moon
Another past time
Your name
Like ice into my heart

Everything as cold as ice
Can no one save you?
Everything as cold as silence
And you will never say a word

Your name like ice into my heart
