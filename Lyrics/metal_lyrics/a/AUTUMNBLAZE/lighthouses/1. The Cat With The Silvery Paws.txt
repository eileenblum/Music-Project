Roads, these roads are clad in smoke
Your talks are drifting past like trains - they scarcely stop
Now I'm gone astray in here
Where tired walls are chattering...... Don't stay! Don't stay!

... and all the ones around me are fainting shapes again

Fear has shut away your dreams
You walk towards a smokescreen, fretful tool

I start to sing a song about the cat with the silvery paws
She plays with starry blades of grass and dreams her little life away
I wonder where I am - under the snow in a sunday cloak
But you just say I'd think too much
Maybe you're right - who will ever know?
