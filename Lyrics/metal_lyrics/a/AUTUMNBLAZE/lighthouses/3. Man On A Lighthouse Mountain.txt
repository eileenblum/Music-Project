O, how I'm longing for you
But I know, your heart goes for the blue
O, so hard to let you flow
Into the sea, your window is closed for me

Leave the man on the lighthouse mountain
He never fell in love
He don't know he could miss a woman's glowing kiss

O, how I'm longing for blue
But I feel, there's something completely new
O, my heart is trembling shy
I doubt again, but I must say goodbye

Leave the man on the lighthouse mountain
He never felt her tender breath
His helpless eyes, they do not miss
Just staring through the ocean's bliss
