Tell me how long I've been waiting for
a wake-up call late in the evening
Tell me where I've been so many times
Close to the distance here in my sleeping room ...

... I'm freezing ... here

Tell me why the ghosts always frighten me
Back to the caves of my childhood I ever run

... but still I'm freezing ...

Wake me up in the evening
When landscapes are covered with a dark blue film
Wake me up in the evening
When noises scream and shivers rise

Moving little nightmares
Rumours of shivering cries
and a minor road swirling and creeping towards its slow end!
