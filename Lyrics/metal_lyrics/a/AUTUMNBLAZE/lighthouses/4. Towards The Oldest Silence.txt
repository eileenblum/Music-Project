Years ago I saw a waveless ocean
Far and great, beyond everything I knew
Nights were glowing, the days too long
For a young man's dreamland and his fancy-song

We lay together on summer-meadow islands
Amazing eyes turned towards the oldest silence
We tried to catch a glimpse of our past
Our primal sea, so deep and vast

All I know, a black hole's coming closer
Hold me on, I fear the nightmare's drowning me

If I dreamed of my most precious moment
I would point at the sparkling waveless ocean

All I know, a black hole's coming closer
Hold me on, I fear the nightmare's drowning hand

All I knew, a fever burned within me
Hold me on, I hope it never comes again
