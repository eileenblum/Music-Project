Who are you?
You're not the sorrow that you feel
The past is gone
And you have survived
Your thoughts are the anvil
Your feelings iron
Your will is the hammer
So forge your wounds away

In the forge of your soul
You can change everything

Who are you?
You've lost so very much inside
But not yourself
There is still light

Your dreams are the anvil
Your love is iron
Your vigour is the hammer
So forge your ache away

In the forge of your soul
You can change everything
