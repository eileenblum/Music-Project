We were one - twin stars
But haughtiness turned out as a stumbling block

We were one - two burning souls
But haughtiness brought us the downfall

Woven tunes can wake the souls
Of the sleeping ones
Woven tunes can change this world
And heal the deepest wounds

We were one - twin stars
But haughtiness turned out as a stumbling block

True life is much more different
And souls are weak
Self-righteous - puerile dreams
We couldn't save anyone
