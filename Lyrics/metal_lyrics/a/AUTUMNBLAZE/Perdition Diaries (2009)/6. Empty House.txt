I lost myself - somewhere outside
And while I delved into my splintered soul
She left this house - dancing with the sun
That I couldn't see anymore

This house is empty
Shelterlike prison - prisonlike shelter

Meaningless pictures at the walls
I can't see them - nothing there
Burned, drowned, erased
I solace myself in sleep and numbness

This house is empty
Shelterlike prison - prisonlike shelter

This cross is too heavy to bear
Where are you, brother?
I need you more than ever
In this cruel hour of death

This house is empty
Shelterlike prison - prisonlike shelter

Where are you?
Where are you?
Save me! Please!
Please!
