Open your eyes and see the traces
In the sky and in the gutter
They were always there
But you didn't recognize

Open your eyes and feel the one
In every sacred moment
He was always there
But you didn't recognize

Unimagined ways
Into a life never expected
If you want nothing you'll get the whole

Open your heart and feel the touch
Of an honest tender spouse
Always there and by your side
No harm can break your soul

Open your heart and feel the touch
Of your children's lucent eyes
They know all secrets
Of your ever-sounding soul

Unimagined ways
Into a life never expected
If you want nothing you'll get the whole
