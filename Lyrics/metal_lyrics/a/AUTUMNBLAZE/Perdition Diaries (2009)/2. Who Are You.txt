Who are you?
The same question almost every day

These bleak eyes in the mirror aren't mine

Who are you?
Every day -- I can't remember

I am a proud man
And life is no misery at all
I am a proud man
husband - father
And life smells good
But...

Who am I?
These bleak eyes in the mirror aren't mine

Somewhere inside
Are withered pictures
Almost untrue
Drowned in wine
Kissed away
But...

Who am I?
These bleak eyes in the mirror aren't mine

A rusty armament
A broken sword

Blood stained memories
Resurging - resurging

I had to burn a fucking kingdom
But...

Who am I?
These bleak eyes in the mirror are mine...
