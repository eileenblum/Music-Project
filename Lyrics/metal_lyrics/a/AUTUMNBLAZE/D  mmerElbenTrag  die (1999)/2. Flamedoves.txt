Let my flamedoves rise
Through the dark and gloomy clouds
Born in skyclad dresses
Floating through the starlit skies
Taste my crystal feathers
Forged in soulspawn tragedies
Join the firedances
Bathe in living symphonies
My dearest sundressed moonlit child
Let me caress your marble cheek
I weave you a home in my flameforged world
As nocturnal fires
Born in scarlet raging seas
I heard flowers breathing
Raging spirits we will be
And the gates of morning
Melt in soulgold diamond tunes
Hear the cosmos roaring
With our soulspawn melodies
My dearest...
Mein Kind im Sonnenmondlichtkleid
Der Garten blÃ¼ht, du bist befreit
EntzÃ¼nde die Fackel der Seelenbrut
