Dryadmother angelic queen
Enhanced by thy mellow lily-scent
She is weeping marble rain
Still her children's worldly bane
Honeydwarves and steeds of bronze
Yellow-red orchids with universe horns
Alas! We'll loose our majesty
For strangers have stained the gardeners key
Golden fairies
Fervant arcs of silent woe
Ebon water
Sent by bitter elfin-bows
Flaring chants of a nightspawn iris
Candlelight fields in violet dew
Spiritodes were onc so close
Ashamed of mortal dreamless view
Like a starving deer I shun
To drown in wintercharm as one
Thy rainbow sighs
Pale and weary
Crowned by falcon swarms
And widowed evengold
Bloodveiled moor
Wildgrown fairydome
Mirrored countenance
Portrait of the dryad's home
