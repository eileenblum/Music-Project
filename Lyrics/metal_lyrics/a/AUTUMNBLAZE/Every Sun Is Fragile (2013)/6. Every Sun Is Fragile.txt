[Music &amp; lyrics Markus B.]

You've teached (sic) me how to
Tame the wars inside
But I cannot hide
There's too much rage
Bleeding from my self-made cage

Oh, lord, check my thesis
That every truth is fragile
And we just have to accept
The future fights will tear us apart again

Cause every sun is fragile
And this is good somehow

I've learned how to
Destroy the beautiful moment
It's like a dying scent
There's too much erosion
And a sense of failed visions

Come closer to me
I need your wounds right now
I don't wanna die like a dead man
The flame must shine again

Oh, lord, check my thesis
That every truth is fragile
And we just have to accept
The future fights will tear us apart again

Cause every sun is fragile
And this is good somehow

Can you see the tower?
No?
It's still hidden.
But someday you will be there
