[Music &amp; lyrics Markus B.]

War is invisible
Crawling like bitter silence
Souls are visible
Inside unmirrored moments

I've been walking through invisible fields
And it was damn cold as you said
Maybe I will come back once again
But prepared with much better shields

Life is invisible
Dawning like the fires of the sun
With one big bang
Our nothingness explodes
And there is a meaning

Will I ever reach invisible fields?
Will I ever reach your eyes to drown in?
Is it too much I'm looking for?
Is it just a useless torch?

Too many traces
Buried by the sea
Find your lost places
Washed away by destiny
