[Music &amp; lyrics: Markus B.]

I see you standing at the edge of science
Praying to misguided gods
We are the good people you've sworn
But hey, are you really sure about?

Apart from that there was a wonderful place
Destructed by years when life burned a maze
Into the wild romantic shores we've created
Where fairies of gold and some more darlings waited

Now there's just paper to heal the sun
A fight against the bleeding road
That covers life with moments of rust
Terror is not what comes from the gun

A place for paper diamonds
Is it too much asking for?
A grave for all the tyrants
Running against our fragile core
