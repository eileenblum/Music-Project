[Music &amp; lyrics: Markus B.]

No sun, no rain, no cloud for me
Just endless peaceful agony
One breath could wash away all joy
And I'd be gone, thy milky boy

There must have been a day in June
When darkness veiled the edge of moon
In somber rage I climbed the hill
A cloak of black disguised my chill

Hey
Burn your life
It's such an easy game

Youth shall be a flawless sword
Just tame the blade, romantic lord
And then one day without a warning
Your eyes are seared like deserts swarming

Hey
Burn your life
It's such an easy game

I should destroy these foolish words
Few rhymes don't make a serious bird
But, well, it's just my style, you know
So take the tram, you way will show

Hey
Burn your life
It's such an easy game

Go on, go on and hide your flame
Go on, go on and hide your fears
Then you will get itâno more tears
