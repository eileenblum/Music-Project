[Music by Markus B., lyrics by Arisjel]

Your heart is empty
Murderer of god
Secularly dancer
Without a breath of pulse

But life will hurt you
With swords of ice
One day
I know

Cold soul
What will you keep inside
When the truth
Covers your pride?

Your heart is sunless
Murderer of hope
Empty outer world
A sunless road

Cold soul
Without resonance
When tunes arise
To tear the veil
