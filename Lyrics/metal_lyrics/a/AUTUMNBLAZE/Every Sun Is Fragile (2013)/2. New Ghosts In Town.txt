[Music &amp; lyrics Markus B.]

Yesterday a little boy knocked at my door
He said, "New ghosts are in town."
And a creepy blow touched my heart
I said there was nothing to be afraid of
It'd be just the way our eyes deceive us

The boy nodded and ran away
But from somewhere the ghosts arrived in town
I felt like an idiot but I couldn't tell him
The world only knows bad teachers in this case

Everyone feels
Everyone screams
No one can change
The way we proceed
When new ghosts are in town

The night was just dark and my dreams ever darker
There was this boy from yesterday, but wrinkled and old
He sad I was coward, a blue savage hidden behind paralysed skin
And I just ran away through sunless roads
Woke up with garbled senses, fighting with my new ghosts

We are scratched by something we cant' comprehend
Folded by demons and already bent
We only can comfort a little boy's soul
The ghosts are here but they just play their role

Everyone feels
Everyone screams
Someone can change
The way we proceed
When new ghosts are in town
