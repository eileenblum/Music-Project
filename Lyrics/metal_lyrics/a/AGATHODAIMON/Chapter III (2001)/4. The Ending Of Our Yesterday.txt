And when the moon enrapts the streams
And trembles on the fen
A thousand years have flown it seems
Since then
For if today I part the veil
And see what time portended
I feel that long ago the tale
Was ended

Little I knew in youth's enchantment
That it is alike absurd
Or to lean against a shadow
Or believe a woman's word
For if today I part the veil
And see what time portended
I feel that long ago the tale
Was ended

Though she once betrayed
Though empty words spoken
I wished she'd have stayed
Remain with a heart that's broken

For I no longer am confined In that sweet country's spell
I have left you far behind
Farewell

Fair autumn still its breeze delays
Upon the springs that wail and sigh
And through the leaves the whisper strays
Of my sad dreams that now must die
