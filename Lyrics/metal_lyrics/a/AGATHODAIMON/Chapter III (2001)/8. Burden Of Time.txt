Tumbling against walls of stone
Arcades filled with silence
The frozen hand of nothingness breaks my mind
Crazed eyes follow my stars
Echoes fill the air
Locked in halls of solitude
End my pain
Exitless rooms, paths without end
Useless days increase the burden of time

Stonecast faces stare at me
Prayin' for release
Every day another scar

Break these chains
I don't see summer's sun,
Dark is my tomb
I don't feel autumn rain,
My senses numb

I don't see winter's snow,
Blind are my eyes
I don't feel rising spring,
Burden of time
