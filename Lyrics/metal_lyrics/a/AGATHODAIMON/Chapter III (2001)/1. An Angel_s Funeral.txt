A weeping procession, moving through the snow
Silent pale faces, perceptible pain
Winter silence - terrible tranquillity
Cold eyes starin' far away

Mirrors of mourning, nothing else
Blinded by grief they are...everyone
Awaitin' your final way
Watchin' the frozen pit and see
We've lost reality

A field of crystal tears, the downfall of heaven
Snow softly falls, frozen tears from above
This bitter loss...an angel's funeral
A casket filled with beloved flesh
Cold as the world around
I can't believe what my eyes see through clouds of icy breath

No bird sings in dead trees
No sound fills the frozen air
I stand at the angel's tomb... alone
A whole world ending to exist
