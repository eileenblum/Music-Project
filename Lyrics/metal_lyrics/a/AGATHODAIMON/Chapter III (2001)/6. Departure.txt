We part for ever from today
Farewell beloved one
And I, unto may death, your way
Will shun.

I care not now where you may go
You can no more bereave me
Today the sweetest girl I know
Does leave me.

[Chorus:]

And the air still moves my curtain
As it used in times of yore...
Moonlight down the lane uncertain
Only you come nevermore

Nor shall I as in former hours
Build spanish castles high
With star-lit windows, and with towers of sky,
When, shivering with bitter cold
Through winter nights uncertain
I watched lest you perhaps unfold
Your curtain.

O what delight to stroll with you
Beneath that flowering trees
When poured its light their branches through,
The moon.

[Repeat Chorus]

That I might catch with rapturous thrill
The words that you let fall
And that today I barely still
Recall.

How often did I secretly pray
Swift night her sails would furl
That we might thus forever stray
Fair girl.

[Repeat Chorus]
