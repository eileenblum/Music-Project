Where the wind blows over the mountaintops into the ancient sky
And the flowers whither in the shadows of an autumn night
Misty fog arises from the valleys and hides the face of the moon
Underneath the ground lies a forgotten wisdom deep entombed

As long as ravens ride the nights
As long as the spirit of the earth takes seat between the spheres
The path beyond was locked behind the gates of consciousness - the mirror of the soul

Time is passing by the mist, is creeping through the deserted land
And all the forests throw their leaves into the growing realm of sand
A whispered cry which told the tale of earth is hurt from above
It drowns the night into bright light and breeds a paradise beyond
And the wind unveils the hidden treasure from the soil
A sweet melancholy fills the plain with a lovely sound
Unleashing the key to the gates of consciousness

Take my hand I'll show you heaven
And walk the path beyond with me
Together we will stand the night and flee from the void
