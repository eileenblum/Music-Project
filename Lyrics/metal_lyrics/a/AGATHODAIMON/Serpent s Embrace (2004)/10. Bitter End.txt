Once I sat down and pondered
About a sense I have wondered
I have searched my deep, inner core
And I said... to think I shall not anymore...

The thought has aged me whole
It ruined body, mind and soul
Oh, thoughtless if I'd been born
Couldn't wail, nor could I've been torn

Fetid thought, spawning curse
I shouldn't invoke thee anymore
Only pain and suffering you brought
The worst disappointment you are

I'd want to live without knowing
In this world or in it's following
Since then, misanthropy
My alibi you should be

And when the grand dark hour falls
I'd be far from mankind's calls
Into the great wide I would dive
Unaware if I am dead or alive!

Once I sat down and pondered
About a sense I have wondered
I have searched my deep, inner core
And I said... to think I shall not anymore...

Fetid thought, spawning curse
I shouldn't invoke thee anymore
Only pain and suffering you brought
The worst disappointment you are
