Endless fear, darkness holds me
I don't know it I am wrong or right
Where is my world that I loved so before?
All has gone, bleeding, dying

You don't know what you have done to me
Left me hollow inside, feel like dirt
I wanna slam you, just wanna kill you
All I want to see is you, lying down in pain

Forever I will hate you
Is all that I can say
Leaving the ghost of you behind
Tears of sorrow I will never spill again
Scratching your face out of my mind

Are you really sure what you wanna be now?
It's just a fake to me, yes
Fuck yourself and die a painful death
I don't need you to love me anymore
Get away and leave my life alone
One step away of twisting your neck
The crown of the human race
Fuck you, is it really you

Loving you, killing you, loving you...
