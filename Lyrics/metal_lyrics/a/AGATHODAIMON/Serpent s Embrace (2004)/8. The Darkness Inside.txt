Life sometimes feels like a nightmare
When every step you take is a wrong one
With only binary choices there
Seeming fair?

They say that time does slowly heal
But memories amplify the pain I feel
Forever haunting me, it's so unreal
And still we dream... as we walk down the line...
We forever sleep

Since ages dead inside
A plunge red shrine

Emotions and hope subside
Foul like altar wine

Life sometimes into a nightmare
When every step you take is a wrong one
With only binary choices there
Seeming fair?

Not when luck has gone
And I said
Not when luck has gone

Living a life beyond light
With darkness to pattern my fate
Feelings left aside
Left with despair and nothing but hate
Left to witness
The final fall of mankind
No outcome of existence

Life sometimes even seems like it goes on
Still every step you take is a wrong one
Maybe you can wake up anytime you like
But you can never leave
You will never achieve
The feeling that life goes on

Or are we already gone?

Left to witness
The final fall of mankind
No outcome of existence
Floods my heart and mind

A lifeless thing in living guise
Leaping off to quick demise

A blind man in a cave of eternal light
Remnants of a dream that fades

Life at times is hard to comprehend
But every step leads further to the end
Still even death is but a guess
And darkness weaves with many shades
Darkness weaves with many shades

Take a look beyond the silver glades
See darkness weave with many shades
