In a thought I'd rest
Like a sign in a glorious gloom
I crawl under her skin
To divinely kiss her skin

I just claim on my purity
In external community
I'm not searching for (any) solutions
But trying to avoid confusion

Till fades the very earth and sky
Your heart completely broken
And all the world hangs on a sigh
A word but party spoken

I'm looking for resistance
And you'll feet my persistence

If you are here to obey me
You get what you deserve
When thoughts pursue me
Can't decide what's true in me

I just claim on my purity
In external community
I'm not searching for (any) solutions
But trying to avoid confusion

I'm looking for resistance
You'll feet my persistence

To disguise desire's utopia
To feed the emotional idea
To forget not to forgive
To arise from dignity's ruin...
