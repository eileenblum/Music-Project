She was the dawn of a new day
The crystal voice inside my head

A golden sun in past times, floating high above
Looking back from now, collection of strange days, for loveSerpent's embrace

Darkness waiting in her eyesSerpent's embrace
She gave birth to a worm of lies
A place of shadows mourn
A soul eater - serpent's embrace
She was the dawn of a new day
But all it brought was pure and sorrowful dismay

The sky and sun turned black
Nailed black as ebony
And there was no turning back
No turning back

And at time I realized
Everything must surely end - some daySerpent's embrace
Darkness waiting in her eyesSerpent's embrace
She gave birth to a worm of lies
A place of shadows mourn
A soul eater - serpent's embraceEvery dawn of a new day
Too far away, but death in cheap
There's a giant, black sun below
Maybe just below the ground, about six feet deep
Beneath the undertow
Beneath the undertow
