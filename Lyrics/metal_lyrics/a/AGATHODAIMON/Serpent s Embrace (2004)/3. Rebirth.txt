I have seen how the same human souls
Wander through different bodies
Drifting through the centuries
When flesh decayed

For ages drifting in the wind
Through landscapes unknown
Among worlds where the suns never die
Where moonlight is bright as day
Beyond timeless void
Beyond all the spheres
In a realm where the powers of earth
Are bound in the fathomless sky

An endless journey
Perpetual suffering

When heartbeat has died
And earthly life has ended
The trip through the emptiness begins
Vultures free your bones
From flesh and blood
Make your spirit soar

Your soul lost in space
Struggling for a new life
Awaiting rebirth

To be captures
In a human body again
