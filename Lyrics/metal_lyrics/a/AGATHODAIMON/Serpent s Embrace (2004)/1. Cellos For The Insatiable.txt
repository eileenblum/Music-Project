Once again, Jekyllish I follow the trail of fireflies - and diamond eyes
And moving like fog, I starve to raise
Sleepwalking hunter in the night

Step into an ongoing nightmare
Go - ride into blistering trails below - tear heart and soul
Stop - for Jekyllish I'll haunt you, though
A sleepwalking hunter in despair - take care of you

I brave for sin - shedding my skin

Curtains fall over my shroud, around my wrists the orchestra plays
Frozen, this bosom aches, piercing lullabies, piercing preys
Only cellos, black robes and gowns, dimly dance for air in grief
And looming portraits of a mother gazing at my inner pleas

Fear me for Jekyllish I'll haunt you, your trail of fireflies and diamond eyes
Moving like fog, I starve to raise, sleepwalking fiend, caligarish sorrow
I invoke the queen of spades... and slowly breathe the verse of fate
I reap the mists of grace to bid farewell to faith

Clenched cries, her drowning sweet hands bygone, waving and fleeting
Dull slave to my mournful twists she bled, like a rainbow leaking
Wax victims in a ritual, echoes to quench my frailty at dawn
The fifth horseman I become, riding those whispers spawned

Fear me for Jekyllish I'll haunt you, your trail of fireflies and diamond eyes
Moving like fog, I starve to raise, sleepwalking fiend, caligarish sorrow
Soon forgotten faces shine on shattered mirrors, remnants of rape
Supremely, skin cellos play the ghost of melodies and darkest shade

Fear me for Jekyllish I'll haunt you, your trail of fireflies and diamond eyes
Moving like fog, I starve to raise, sleepwalking fiend, caligarish sorrow

A warm tune for claws and chaos I breed the rust of wind
While, holding bacl loss, shame and tears

I brave for sin - shedding my skin
