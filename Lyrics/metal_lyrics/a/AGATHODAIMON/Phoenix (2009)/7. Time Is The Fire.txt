Skies above the endless seas
Engulf horizons till they disappear
At a sign a ship shaking its masts
Passes by like a fortress floating on wastelands
Flocks of cranes sail to the skies
Where never ending paths arise
Neath the blunt and timid sun
Skies above the endless seas
The shil, the ocean, the days are... gone
Likewise lives and youth pass by
They pass away, like a lie
Likewise lives and youth pass by
And die...
Skies full of stars above endless seas
Horizons till they disappear
An enormous ship shaking its masts
Passes by like a floating keep
Skies above the endless seas
The ship, the ocean, the days are... gone
But till I'm not 6 feet underground
My angels bow to my mourning sound
And sing along my weeping, over and over again
Likewise lives and youth pass by
They pass away, like a lie,
But till I'm not 6 feet underground
My angels, bow to my mourning sound
And sing along my weeping, over and over
With the passion of a new born lover
...Again
And then, I will look behind to the world
Like those who don't have much to tell (eachother)
When they can't say what they want
In the shadow of these ancient walls
In their silence, I lay down to rest
In the same silence that swallowed the travelers
Who fell asleep in time
Who are now... forgotten... by aeons
Time is the water in which we drown
Time is the fire in which we burn
Likewise lives and youth pass by
They pass away, like a lie
Likewise lives and youth pass by
...and die
Time is the water in which we drown
Time is the fire in which we burn
