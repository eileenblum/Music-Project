Cry with my tears, crawl across the floor
This body of clay may need no more
He gives you hope, he shows his care
Or is your patience a form of despair?
For a moment I feel embraced
Now that I'm unbound
My eyes have lost their grace
I scream a demonic sound
Shed all your tears, my friend, come release them all
We've flooded heavens, hear their desperate call
While Death becomes angels. Death becomes real
All of god's work you know - It's devil's deal
(Will you be... lost struggling in vain?)
Within the fields of sorrow, I pass to the other side
Facing my deepest hollow, which mirrors my dark light
Cry with my tears, my dear, the waters are coming down
Call my name, aloud, but before you drown
Cause god and Satan, you know
They reach out their hand
So they are reconciled within me, my friend
Shed all your tears, my dear, all these words as such
'cause in this world of lies, all your words... don't mean much
(Or will I come once more to rescue you again?)
Within the fields of sorrow, I pass to the other side
Facing my deepest hollow, which mirrors my dark light
Shed all your tears, give me your hand
Look into my eyes, make your final stand
Whereever you will go, hence, go without regret
Within the fields of sorrow, I pass to the other side
Facing my deepest hollow, which mirrors my dark light.
Shed all your tears, give me your hand
Look into my eyes, make your final stand
It's been so long, I hope you don't forget
Whereever you will go, hence, go without regret..
