Years of ignorance have gone
Mankind destroys and rapes the earth
The world withers and the end comes soon
Will I, can I ever by unbound and flawless
Will I, can I, ever be so alive
Another step to peace
Another memory has gone
Another time we'll see the end
The setting of the sun
And all the shades seem now so clear
Every cloud has disappeared
The sun encases all the moments we'd wish to be seared

[Chorus]
What brings the end, what brings the time
What keeps my memories alive
What makes the world we're living in a better place at a better time
What brings the end, what brings the time
What makes this world we're living in a better place for a better life
The years went by and the earth still falls and decays
Slowly, we unfurl the storms
Will we, can we ever be tougher, stronger than the rest
Can we ever be so alive?
We've gone finally but why
The wave of fortune passes by
The thirteen demons burn the gates
And so the earth enrages

[Repeat chorus]

Can't you see all the blindness in their eyes
Can't you feel that the spiteful ghosts arise
Don't you know I'm the sinner in disguise
I sense your dirty lies

[Repeat chorus]
