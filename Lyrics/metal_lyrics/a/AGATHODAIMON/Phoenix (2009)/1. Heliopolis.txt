Heliopolis in flames alight, a flickering and rebirth
Enlightened night overthrown by a place of shame
The scorched sky converts night
You wish for light to call
Face to face with the madness
The call of fate to save us all
Daily horror that brings you sadness
When smoke arises from the planes
With a loud, triumphant sigh

I always bleed, I always heal
I live to die anew, it breaks me, it burns me...
All around us is just decay
There's no means to wash the pain away
You will turn your head and say
I always only cared about me

[Repeat chorus]

When the darkest tempest roars
Passes by with quiet wings
Landscapes swiftly burn away
and fall apart to dust
All around us is just decay
There's no means to wash the pain away
You will turn your head and say
I always only cared about me

[Repeat chorus]

The memories, the pictures, the melodies, the wars
Everything I was, everything I earned
Grasped in my claws
All around us is just decay
There's no means to wash the pain away
You will turn your head and say
I just cared about -- me
No more years of waiting
The final days, the conflagration
Feathers falling from my wings now -
Here comes sunset

[Repeat chorus]
