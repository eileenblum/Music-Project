Throughout the field
Of unshaded grace
Within the land
Of the neverending sun
With all the appropriate compliance
I strive for the sunset
For all time from now to then
I can not free myself from the memory
Warmth surrounding me
In the darkest corner of my mind
A childish joy overwhelming me
While aggrieving insects
Smashing rocks on them
A wholeheartedly joy
Aggrieving, crushing
It fills me from the navel to the chaff
Now, as I refuse to soar myself above others
It's getting cold, deep inside of me
It's been a decision of my mind, not of heart.
A coldness that makes me shiver
Catches up to me, displaces warmth.
Abiding my decision
I ache for the times I was free
To unleash this childish joy and warmth
The decision was made somehow
Without my anticipation.
It's a long way from home one to the other side
A fucked up journey
When you try to walk away from yourself
From the darkest corner of your mind
The decision was made somehow
Whitout your anticipation
Into the never-ending sunset
The memory, a so called friend,
Is always accompanying me,
Torturing me by reflecting what I was.
I cannot free myself from the memories
In the land of the never-ending sun
