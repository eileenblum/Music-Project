You're standing numb
Looking back
How long already?
How could you fool flee to the world
Just right before the break of winter?

[Chorus]
And nothing in this world will change
All just stays the same
The world - a gate
To a thousand deserts, silent and cold
And one who's lost what you have lost
Does stop at nothing, never rests
You're standing pale
Damned to go off on your winter-travel
Just like the smoke that's always seeking
Colder, chiller, higher skies

[Repeat chorus]

Fly, bird, and sing your song
In the way of the desert bird
And hide, you fool this bleeding heart
In ice and snow, in chill and scorn
Save your prayers before they swoon
This bitter cold that came so soon
Every story has its end
His future dreams forever banned
Oh my dearest Winterchild
Overwhelmed by coldness, ice and snow at night
The crows are screaming
And fly whirring towards town
Soon it will snow-
Woe betide those who don't - have home

[Repeat chorus]

Fly, bird, and sing your song
In the way of the desert bird
And hide, you fool this bleeding heart
In ice and snow, in chill and scorn
