Way down to heaven
your needless resource
Is a forecast of cruelty and dismay
Cast into mirrors
An ambush on its course
You are blemish, frailty and decay
Will I get at something
Will I ever be complete
Build by dust - born to slave away
Taste an angel's life's blood
So pure and bitter seet
Buil of nothing - born to decay

[Chorus]
Deep in my mind there rests the ghost
Of an innocent soul
Capped by darkness and dismay
Out of these depths
I slay so cruel and so confident
Will I ever be set free
Lust prevails my temper
Endless rapture turns to grief
A silent scream which fraudulent arises
Without shelter, your wounds lead me to lambency
Spouts truth above your lies
Step by step, piece by piece
Cut by cut - we reach the end together

[Repeat chorus]

Take this cloak from me - your offer I will not embrace
A failure once for me - not to be driven into hate
Will I ever be set free
Will I ever be complete
Will I ever be set free
Will I, can I, ever be complete?

[Repeat chorus]

Come set me free
