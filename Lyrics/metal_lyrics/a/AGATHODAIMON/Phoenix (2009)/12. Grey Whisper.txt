Dust and oblivion lay down onto my name
My stone they've raped with the rules of the game
A grey whisper dying
New grey day upon me
Fetters all the colors
That (once) used to be
No, you can't deny it
Can't deny the raining
Catch my tears falling...
And sip of me, and drink of me, at last
As if you didn't know, me, memory, to tame
I should have known it would never be the same...
I'd live twice the pain to even be the flowers
You'd hold for me in vain
Dust and oblivion lay down onto my name
My stone they've raped with the rules of the game
I'm like lost chapters of an old an welken book
Please wipe your tears, my dear, and my funeral look

[Chorus]
Driven by suffering
Haunted by hate
Whatever tomorrow brings
I sharpened my blade
As if you didn't know, me, memory, to tame
I should have known it would never be the same
A grey whisper dying
New grey day upon me
Fetters all the colors
That (once) used to be
No, you can't deny it
Can't deny the raining
Catch my tears falling...
And sip of me, and drink of me, at last
Where are the sweet poems
Pieces of the whole
Pictures of you, violins
To indulge my broken soul
Rain, music you wrote
For your beloved dead
Word splintered before
They could have been said
I'd die once more
To live this moment again
To hold you near
To soothe my pain

[Repeat chorus]

Driven by suffering
Haunted by hate

[Repeat chorus]
