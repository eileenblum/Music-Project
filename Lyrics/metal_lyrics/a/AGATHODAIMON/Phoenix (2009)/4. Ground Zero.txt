Peering into darkness without prospect, the future to be left in despair
A presage gorn of plenty filled with plague and famine
Unbroken mind case dramatic ground zero
From a distand dream to be seen, surely undreamt yet unbelieved
Seem to be, with me, in severe insanity
Forever there, forever deceived
No disguise of fevered innocence
A lovers fear in mourning, epiphany

[Chorus:]
Another life, another time
Dream of stars but proclaim fire
As flames meet earth, I throw you down
To watch your flesh blister and char
I anoint you, dress you in white
Attempt to allay those fever dreams
These pitiful dreamers...

Witnessed the reconstruction of fallen stars
Your life is doomed, a misplaced soul you are
Your thoughts are sparkles in despair
Fighting the cold, inconsiderate emotions
Confusing future threatening ahead
Deep down the abyss of my crystalline soul
Into the valley of sore thoughts
Like that insignificant refuge of lies
That make you shiver, that make you cry
No disguise of fevered innocence
A lovers fear in mourning, epiphany

[Chorus]

Edacious burning, destroying, turning
What was living to death
Walking, stalking, going, gone [2x]

[Chorus]
