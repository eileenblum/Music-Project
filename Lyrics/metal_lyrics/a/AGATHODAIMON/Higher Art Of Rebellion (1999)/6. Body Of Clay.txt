Cry with my tears
Cry with my pain
Still in the cold
Neverending rain

With one of your kisses
My words you'd freeze
From one of your kisses
My bleeding would cease

Shed all my tears
The flood devours all
The earth, us, rushing...
A shy, whispered call

Death becomes angels
And they won't turn away
Defying all my yearing
And my body of clay

Cry with my crying
You end up like (a) mole
Death loves the angels
Retired into my soul

As I'm drained and welken
My last wish I sigh
Let me be, darling
Tears in your eye.
