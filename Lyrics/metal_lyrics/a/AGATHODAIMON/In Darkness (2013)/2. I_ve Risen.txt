Through my eyes, with one hand
For my will, within a breath
I grabbed, owned... and brought terror to all the foreign lands
I took the precious gift of life... throughout any realm of existence

I have risen
I have risen

I gave life to thousands of sons and I saw them all fall before me
I ruled the weak, I ruined worlds in my endless decades of might
Uncountable is the amount of suns I've seen rise, pass and sink
Unnamable all the kingdoms I've seen, conquered and destroyed

I have risen
I have risen
For my will be done!
I have risen, between the strong, above the weak
I have grown up with demons and angels, in struggle and silence

(You still) see my tales on the wall of any grave in forgotten lands
(You can) see my shrunken temple, my body, once the house of a god
(You can still) see the statues standing on my kingdoms soil, showing my pride
(You might) realize my triumph above all flesh and steel, the god and devil am I

I have risen
I have risen
For my will be done!
I have risen, between the strong, above the weak
I have grown up with demons and angels, in struggle and silence

I have risen, between the strong, above the weak
I have grown up with demons and angels, in struggle and silence
I have risen, between the strong, above the weak
I have created paradise and hell, in my era of domination
