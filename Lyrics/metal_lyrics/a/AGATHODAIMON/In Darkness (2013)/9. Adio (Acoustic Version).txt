[Bonus Track]Let's go together with a flare
As for today, we do not care...
And we will leave this world behind
Drunken of love and also high.

Oh, holy death, take us away
On your black wings into the night.
Oh, holy death, take us away, goodbye.

We break down as the stars burn cold
Burn bitter and cold inside our hearts
Got a wound so deep, so deep and old...

We break down as the stars burn cold
Burn bitter and cold inside our hearts
Got a wound so deep, so deep and old...

One last embrace, a final kiss
As for tonight, no one will miss us...
And I follow you to hell
Farewell.

Oh, holy death, take us away
On your black wings into the night.
Oh, holy death, take us away, goodbye.

We break down as the stars burn cold
Burn bitter and cold inside our hearts
Got a wound so deep, so deep and old...

We break down as the stars burn cold
Burn bitter and cold inside our hearts
Got a wound so deep, so deep and old...
