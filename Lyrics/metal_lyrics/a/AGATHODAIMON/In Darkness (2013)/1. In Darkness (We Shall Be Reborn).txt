There on the fields of death we meet again
Surrounded by all the light - in vain
This is our fortune â this is our burden - this is our last home
This is the ending â this is absolution - this is our final tomb

In Darkness we shall be reborn
In Darkness we shall be reborn
The shadow gods call with a wolves howl

Oh great Akasha, let me rest
Under a radiant moon I pass your last test
This is our ending â our last goodbye
Death is calling with his sweetest lullaby

Destroy my shell to settle my ghost
Carry me amongst the few of the lost
The knife is sharpened â my skin is free
O Mother Night â bring me to thee

In Darkness we shall be reborn
