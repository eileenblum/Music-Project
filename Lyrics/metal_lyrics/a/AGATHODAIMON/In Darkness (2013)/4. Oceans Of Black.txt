Beckon our last goodbye when you hear this call
You can't face the fires once you feel them all

Another time - another day - maybe once we can return
We together in the oceans of great darkness we will burn
Lay down with me and listen closely to the sounds of the old blue
Tellin' stories long forgotten - can't you hear they're just for you

Another time, another day - maybe once we can return
We together in the oceans of great darkness we will burn

Feed the flames of the pictures I adore
We come together for the end while he's calling us for more
Play the violins of death upon your naked skin
Kiss me one last time and let us die in sin

Once we will meet again in the burning halls
Where all the sorrow flows and slowly death befalls
Oceans of black shall carry us throughout the night
Where only death is real they shall be our guiding light

Swim, let yourself be carried with the tide
And on a lovelorn day, put all your fears aside
Behind the dreary path, look back to all that's past
To realize that life is just the way to endless death at last

Feed the flames of the pictures I adore
We come together for the end while he's calling us for more
Play the violins of death upon your naked skin
Kiss me one last time and let us die in sin
