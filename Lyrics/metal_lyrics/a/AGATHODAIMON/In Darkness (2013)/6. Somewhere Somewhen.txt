When all the dust of gone times
Is blown apart through the world's new spheres
All pain of forgotten dark times,
Is broken by the light of a bright growing day

Somewhere, somewhen...

Empty new world, unknown surrounding
The power of creation is now in our own hands
Beyond the knowledge of everything outside our realm
We are forever to be

Somewhere, somewhen...
We'll meet again

Survived the wildest waves
Climbed the highest hills to see
Crept through the most forgotten valleys
And fought unimaginable wars

Somewhere, somewhen...
We'll meet again

Survived the wildest waves
Climbed the highest hills to see
Crept through the most forgotten valleys
And fought unimaginable wars

Somewhere, somewhen...
We'll meet again
