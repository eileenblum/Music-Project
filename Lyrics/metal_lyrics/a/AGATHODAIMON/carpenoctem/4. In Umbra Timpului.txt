Deep into the darkness peering
Long I stood there fearing
Dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before...
But the silence was unbroken
And the stillness gave no token
And the only word there spoken
Was the whispered word: "Veritas"
This the dark whispered
And an echo murmured back the word
Merely this and nothing more!

Fools and faith conspire
Questions of desire
That they never owned before
Kings without their armour
Men without their honour
We all slip into oblivion

Monuments of distant knowledge and remains
Stare undying from this end into the life
They are the dark inside the night
The ghosts of which the poets write
And the dreams that night's embrace
That slowly leave without a trace...

Eu te slavesc nocturna, cu bolta innoptarii
O, doamna a tacerii,
O, vas al intristarii

Vreau sa m-agat detine, spre cer navala dind
cum viermii de-un cadavru s-agata misunind!

O, suflet sparge-odata, ingustati inchisoare
Si scutura-te-odata de-alest lut pamintesc!

Oh, the scarlet skies
drown the cold sun
Onto the funeral cries of the dying eve
And there's a foreign shade in mine
It's the time's greedy scythe!

Eu te slavesc nocturna, cu bolta innoptarii
O, doamna a tacerii,
O, vas al intristarii

Vreau sa m-agat detine, spre cer navala dind
cum viermii de-un cadavru s-agata misunind!
