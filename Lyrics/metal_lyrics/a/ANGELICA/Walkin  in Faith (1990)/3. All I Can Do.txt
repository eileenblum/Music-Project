Well I don't know
it all looks new
It's the same Ol'...
Puttin' in time I'll
honor you Lord with
all that's mine.
Gimme Gimme never gets
workin' hard to bring it in closer
need ya to stand right by my side.
I will, I will, I do, I do.

[Chorus:]
It's all I can do is to say
and to carry my candle
another day.
Should I be brought
before nations. I'll say
only what you want me to say

Well I don't know
all so new and it's gettin' so old.
how many will die
before we uproot
the money tree?
Gimme Gimme never
ever ends. The more I get
the more I want, ya ya
But I don't want to let
it get to me.

It's all I can do...
