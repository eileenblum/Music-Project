Another day in the tale
and I'm blinded still by
the walls of temptation.
Just isn't fair when you
need somebody
there to fight this sensation.

These walls won't stand
I'm holdin' the hand of the Lord
to take these stones away
My soul's on fire with what I see
but my flesh won't metl away
It keeps callin' and callin' and
callin' my name.

Something inside knows
if we try.
We can have a dream
I do believe
I need to hear voice to
cheer my heart and
send me on my way.

[Chorus:]
Hold on, for a little
while hold on for a little
while longer.
Be strong wait and see
cause I still believe
that the rainbow's still
within reach.
that your love can cover me.

Alone once again still
can't comprehend Your
grace and Your mercy
You want to bare my pain
and despair
Lord bare it this evening
