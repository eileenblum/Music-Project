Tonight I will delight In your word, give me sight to seewhat your will is.I hope that I'm not wrong.Lord make me strong,to walk from sin again and again Chorus:I'm walkin' in faithShow you LordI'm strong enough to stayI know what right and wrong isI'm talkin' in faiththe promises You madeI mean to take. I'll give it all that I've gotcause I know I love you alotcan't wait to see youI want to carry on hopin'It's not long before You take your brideup and away I'm walkin' in faith You're in my sightand I'm aimin' for the targetloaded and readytime's been well worthwaiting on you I'm walkin' in faith
