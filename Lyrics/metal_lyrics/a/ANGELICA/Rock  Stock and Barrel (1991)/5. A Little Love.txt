Sometimes it's all I see
The lonely souls in need
Don't we recognize the sound
Of a broken spirit's plea

Where do we belong
When we live in a world
That seems so wrong
Are you with me?

A little love goes a long, long way
But it hurts 'cause I want you to stay with me
Don't you think I know how it feels

At times it knows no bounds
It's showered all around
It fuels the fire in me
It's a love that's Heavenly

Where do we belong
When we live in a world
That knows no love
Are you listening?

A little love goes a long, long way
But it hurts 'cause I want you to stay with me
Don't you think I know how it feels
A little love goes a long, long way
But it hurts 'cause I want you to stay with me
I know to well how you're feeling

A little love goes a long, long way
But it hurts 'cause I want you to stay with me
