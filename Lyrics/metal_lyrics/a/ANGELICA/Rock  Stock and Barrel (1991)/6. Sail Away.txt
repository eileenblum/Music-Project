My head is spinning
My eyes are weak
It's just another day
Accustomed to this indecision
Oh, here we go again

Burned the bridge as I walk along
Down the road that I've taken
Can I return Lord, if I am wrong
Does the path need to be straightened

The memory of the dream I've held
I pray you keep from fading as well
Let it never part from me

Sail away
Mark the course that I'll be taking
Sail away (sail away)
Let me know 'cause I'll still be waiting
Sail away (oh, oh, woah)
Heal the hurting and the pain
Sail away (sail away)
Bring me out so I can see

Heads or tails
My life is turning
The coin is wearing thin
The winners gonna wear a smile
But losers gotta live

Burned the bridge as I walk along
Down the road that I've taken
Can I return Lord, if I am wrong
Does the path need to be straightened

The memory of the dream I've held
I pray you keep from fading as well
Let it never part from me

Sail away
Mark the course that I'll be taking
Sail away (sail away)
Let me know 'cause I'll still be waiting
Sail away (oh, oh, woah)
Heal the hurting and the pain
Sail away (sail away)
Bring me out so I can see

Sail away
Mark the course that I'll be taking
Sail away (sail away)
Let me know 'cause I'll still be waiting
Sail away (oh, oh, woah)
Heal the hurting and the pain
Sail away (sail away)
Bring me out so I can see
