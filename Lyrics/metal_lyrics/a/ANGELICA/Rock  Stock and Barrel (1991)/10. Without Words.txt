Once in a while
I feel like I gotta say
Something that comes to my mind
At time it feels like there's no other way
So I put to music
When I'm  at a loss for words
It's easy to read
My mind ain't able
My heart wants to say
Just how much you mean to me

I don't mind but I realized
You think I'm trying to hide
There is a meaning present
In the tears that I've cried

Without words
And not without meaning
Without words
I still get the feeling
Not with words
But I still got something to say

Everytime I pick up and start to play
I'm taken into my own world
It seems like words don't belong, it's absurd
But I gotta pick up, move on
'Cause the preassure's on
We don't all agree
Seems a shame that the words are the
Life and the soul is what's buried beneath

I don't mind but I realized
You think I'm trying to hide
There is a meaning present
In the tears that I've cried

Without words
And not without meaning
Without words
I still get the feeling
Not with words
But I still got something to say

I don't mind but I realized
You think I'm trying to hide
There is a meaning present
In the tears that I've cried

Without words
And not without meaning
Without words
I still get the feeling
Not with words
But I still got something to say
Without words
And not without meaning
Without words
I still get the feeling
Not with words
But I still got something to say
