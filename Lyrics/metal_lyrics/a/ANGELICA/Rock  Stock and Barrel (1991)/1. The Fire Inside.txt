Burn into me a new way of living
A way that I can perceive
Sad to see so much rejection
A race that will just not believe

I wanna carry all I am giving
It's all that you want from me
I've been tried to be overtaken
I rejoice in your victory

I, I come alive when I feel the fire inside
I, no I can't hide the light that belongs in my life
'Cause you keep it burning

Strengthen me to stand through temptation
And in the strenght of your name
Empower me, show me the weapons
The weapons I need
Guard my mind, alert and aware
The sight of the battle ground
The captain approaches, His coming is near
Let no offense be found

I wanna carry all I am giving
It's all that you want from me
I've been tried to be overtaken
I rejoice in your victory

I, I come alive when I feel the fire inside
I, no I can't hide the light that belongs in my life
'Cause you keep it burning

I, I come alive when I feel the fire inside
I, no I can't hide the light that belongs in my life
'Cause you keep it burning
I, I come alive when I feel the fire inside
I, no I can't hide the light that belongs in my life
'Cause you keep it burning
