Here all alone
This time I've been thinking
Just been hoping again
I look to the sky
Wonder what's waiting
Can Heaven still be on my side
Spent all this time
Waiting for answers
I can't wait anymore

Running and waiting and hoping
Do dreams ever just come along?
I've just begun to believe
That I'll get there if I remain strong

Break for a view of what's really happening
Once it goes I'll be gone
Waiting for news that it's closer than ever
Gotta keep pushing on

Starting to feel
Like I'm running on empty
Time I draw the line
You know where I'm at
I've been trying for ever
Been coming back time after time
Now I've spent all my hope on this vision
It's soon gotta come alive

Running and waiting and hoping
Do dreams ever just come along?
Don't wanna leave but it's time
To think that I might have been wrong

Break for a view of what's really happening
Once it goes I'll be gone
Waiting for news that it's closer than ever
Gotta keep pushing on
Break for a view of what's really happening
Once it goes, once it goes I'll be gone
Waiting for news that it's closer than ever
Gotta keep pushing on

Break for a view of what's really happening
Once it goes I'll be gone
Waiting for news that it's closer than ever
Gotta keep pushing on
Break for a view of what's really happening
Once it goes, once it goes
Waiting for news that it's closer than ever
Gotta keep pushing on
Break for a view of what's really happening
Once it goes I'll be gone
Waiting for news that it's closer than ever
Gotta keep pushing on
