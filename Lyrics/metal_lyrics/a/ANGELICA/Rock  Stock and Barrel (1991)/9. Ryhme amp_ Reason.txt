Little by little
We stagger through life
Filling our pockets with change
Never consider how bitter the end
And gamble our lives away

Round and round the centuries come and go
None the wiser, wise men laugh and joke

Rhyme and reason
Don't wanna listen, hey
Gonna answer anyway
Rhyme and reason

Ashes to ashes
To dust I'll return
This we all understand
From where I came
I brought nothing with me
And I'll take with me much the same

On and on now you'd think we'd learn
Millions have died, never to return

Rhyme and reason
Don't wanna listen, hey
Gonna answer anyway
Rhyme and reason

It's what I know
Now what I see
There's a spirit inside of me
I will arise
When I've died
To give account on the other side

Ashes to ashes
To dust I'll return
This we all understand
From where I came
I brought nothing with me
And I'll take with me much the same

Rhyme and reason
Don't wanna listen, hey
Gonna answer anyway
Rhyme and reason
Rhyme and reason
Don't wanna listen, hey
Rhyme and reason
Rhyme and reason
Don't wanna listen, hey
Gonna answer anyway
Rhyme and reason
