Feeling better
Now that I understand
Just what you require
And I know that I'll win 'cause I can
Knowing that you set the standard for me

All in all, it's really not what I had expected to see
Lately though, I've been learning that it's only
Just between you and me

And what's all this talk about a ball and a chain
Can't you see all the freedom I've gained
Cover me

I've got to give all the good that I can get outta me
I know the bad gives me trouble but it shows me I need
A little help just to lead me along
Pick me up, shake the dust, then move on
Cover me

Real as it is, it doesn't mean it's always easy to believe what I see
Now and agin, you know I'd like for you to tell me that things are o.k.

Wish it was as easy as a phone call away
'cause I could use some advise here today
Cover me

I've got to give all the good that I can get outta me
I know the bad gives me trouble but it shows me I need
A little help just to lead me along
Pick me up, shake the dust, then move on
Cover me

Feeling better
Now that I understand
You say that everything matters
Just remember those prints in the sand
And the end will justify the means

I've got to give all the good that I can get outta me
I know the bad gives me trouble but it shows me I need
A little help just to lead me along
Pick me up, shake the dust, then move on
Cover me
I've got to give all the good that I can get outta me
A little help just to lead me along
Pick me up, shake the dust, then move on
Cover me
