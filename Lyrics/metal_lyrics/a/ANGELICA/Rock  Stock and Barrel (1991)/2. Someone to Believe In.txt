Who'd believed the dreams we shared
Our ambitions took us there
We didn't know, we didn't care
All of a sudden to my surprise
The pains of reality arise
Could I have known, my dreams were just lies

No one ever talked about
The method or the reason
As I stood here on my own
I've got to wonder what I need

Someone to believe in me (in me)
Someone to stand and agree
I know I see
But I need some help to succeed
Someone to believe in me (in me)
Someone to reach for the need
I know it's true
But I need some help to believe

Now as I see above the crowd
It doesn't look easy, I don't know how
Can you explain, this vision to me
Left or right, it's so unclear
I missed the voice that I gotta hear
Just gonna stop and wait 'til I find you

No one ever warned me when
This wheel went into motion
Never showed me how to steer
In a course full up to here

Someone to believe in me (in me)
Someone to stand and agree
I know I see
But I need some help to succeed
Someone to believe in me (in me)
Someone to reach for the need
I know it's true
But I need some help to believe

Someone to believe in me (in me)
Someone to stand and agree
I know I see
But I need some help to succeed
Someone to believe in me (in me)
Someone to reach for the need
I know it's true
But I need some help to believe

Someone to believe in me (in me)
Someone to stand and agree
I know I see
But I need some help to succeed
Someone to believe in me (in me)
Someone to reach for the need
I know it's true
And I need some help to believe
