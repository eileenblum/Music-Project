Can you imagine
A paradise unseen
Would it seem worth searching for
I'm sure you know what I mean
Now and again I'll wonder
What's in store, can this be real
The end of every man
Reminds me that it is clear

There is a part of me
That wants to stop, get off and leave
'Cause I know that I'm ready to go on home

Home sweet Heaven
Where I wanna be
When you know there's a new world waiting
This place can lose it's appeal
Home sweet Heaven (Heaven)
When you know there's a kingdom coming
Days are lived in perfect peace

Come and take pleasure
I know for sure you'll agree
A new realm of understanding
Become your reality
Given a measure
Of what it takes to believe
Don't be caught without the excuse
To answer for your plea

The day seems brighter when
You keep in mind the very end
And you know that you're ready to go on home

Home sweet Heaven
Where I wanna be
When you know there's a new world waiting
This place can lose it's appeal
Home sweet Heaven (Heaven)
When you know there's a kingdom coming
Days are lived in perfect peace

Home sweet Heaven
Home sweet Heaven
Home sweet Heaven
Home sweet Heaven
Home sweet Heaven
