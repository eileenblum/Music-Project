Welcome to our devolution
As mother nature screams
The lunacy of self-delusion
Is larger than it seems

I cannot bear the things I see, the way we treat the air we breathe
Desecrate the world with our pollution
Mankind kills, then kills again, anything that makes a sale
Feel the Earth's despair and retribution

Basic instinct, self-survival
Will turn farms into dust
The Earth begins with its reprisal
Machinery will rust

I cannot bear the things I see, the way we treat the air we breathe
Desecrate the world with our pollution
Mankind kills, then kills again, anything that makes a sale
Feel the Earth's despair and retribution

Stripped away all natures' wonders
Reveal beneath a beast
A torrid land of death and umbrage
Our life on Earth will cease

I cannot bear the things I see, the way we treat the air we breathe
Desecrate the world with our pollution
Mankind kills, then kills again, anything that makes a sale
Feel the Earth's despair and retribution

I cannot bear the things, I cannot bear the things I see
I cannot bear the things, I cannot bear the things I see
