Trapped behind security
Razor fences high
A fortress within a fortress
To enter, you dare not try

Electrical error, a cruel twist of fate
Releasing components, your skin disintegrates
A structural deviance, a cruel twist of fate
Unleashes the poison from nuclear waste

Nowhere is safe
And nowhere is home
Nowhere is right
For this abhorrent tomb

Electrical error, a cruel twist of fate
Releasing components, your skin disintegrates
A structural deviance, a cruel twist of fate
Unleashing the poison from nuclear waste

Hold the power -- Tight in your hands
Hold the power -- It's yours to command

Scream in terror -- Scream into your hands
Scream in terror -- So much for your plans

Altering species
At geneial level
Mutating offspring
As no god intended

Electrical error, a cruel twist of fate
Releasing components, your skin disintegrates
A structural deviance, a cruel twist of fate
Unleashing the poison from nuclear waste

So much for your plans
