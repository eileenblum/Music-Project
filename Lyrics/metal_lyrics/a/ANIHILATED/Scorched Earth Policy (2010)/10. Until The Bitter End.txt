Ghosts of war surround us, their warning clear to me
We find the path behind us will lead to misery
A mindless quest for power births the army of the dead
I cannot stop the voices, the voices in my head

We will fight on until the bitter end
Until the bitter end
We will scream on until the bitter end
Until the bitter end

Your religion has betrayed you, an agent of the state
Manipulate, control you and what you tolerate
Lambs to the slaughter, you follow heedlessly
Obeying without question, ignoring what you see

We will fight on until the bitter end
Until the bitter end
We will scream on until the bitter end
Until the bitter end

The voices keep on calling, screaming out to me
If I don't fight the power, no one fights for me
And so, two decades later, we stand screaming again
Standing here and screaming until the bitter end

We will fight on until the bitter end
Until the bitter end
We will scream on until the bitter end
Until the bitter end
