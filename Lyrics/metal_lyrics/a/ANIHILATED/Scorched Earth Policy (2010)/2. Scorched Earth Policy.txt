Scales fall from my eyes
I've been blind too long
Shut myself off from the world
While everything went wrong

Earth groans beneath the weight 
Of a million war machines
Preaching unrequited hate
To win by any means
With a heavy heart and a tarnished soul
I stand in line to pay the toll
A lesson in true lunacy
A Scorched Earth Policy

Do you only care for
Me, myself and I?
Are these the lies you whisper
As another child dies?

Earth groans beneath the weight 
Of a million war machines
Preaching unrequited hate
To win by any means
With a heavy heart and a tarnished soul
I stand in line to pay the toll
A lesson in true lunacy
A Scorched Earth Policy

Your children do not know you
They're programmed full of hate
Mankind has learned nothing
But another way to rape

Yet still you go on killing
Still you do pollute
Still you teach your children 
That the self is absolute

Earth groans beneath the weight 
Of a million war machines
Preaching unrequited hate
To win by any means
With a heavy heart and a tarnished soul
I stand in line to pay the toll
A lesson in true lunacy
A Scorched Earth Policy
