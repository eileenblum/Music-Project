Look through the dark eyes of the mind
Witness what we have become
Millions live in poverty, are starving
Dead before their life has begun

The human soul
Seen through the dark eyes
Displays its potential for pain
Desecration knows no bounds
Drenched in the bloody rain
The human soul
Seen through the dark eyes
Displays its violence and rage
Desecration knows no bounds
Drenched in the bloody rain

The rich, they hold all of the power
They subjugate and enslave the weak
Create their kingdoms built on sand
Foundations crumbling at their feet

The human soul
Seen through the dark eyes
Displays its potential for pain
Desecration knows no bounds
Drenched in the bloody rain
The human soul
Seen through the dark eyes
Displays its violence and rage
Desecration knows no bounds
Drenched in the bloody rain

Even life seems so disposable
Nothing now is seen as unique
Take what you can and give nothing back
No quarter, no surrender, no retreat

The human soul
Seen through the dark eyes
Displays its potential for pain
Desecration knows no bounds
Drenched in the bloody rain
The human soul
Seen through the dark eyes
Displays its violence and rage
Desecration knows no bounds
Drenched in the bloody rain
