We turn a full circle, it's all in our hands
The rise of the warrior, the descent of man

We turn a full circle, revert to our roots
Towards death we hurtle, behaving like brutes

We turn a full circle, we no longer care
The carcass of society torn open, laid bare
We turn a full circle, rape, pillage, loot
The flag of convenience is what we salute

A weapon of consumption, a weapon of our greed
A weapon of destruction, a weapon: take heed
A weapon of death, a weapon of speed
A symptom of out lunacy to make our Earth bleed

Sanity is ending, mankind is descending
Death's hand extending; darkness never ending

Spiralling out of control, savagery becomes normal
Civilization swept away - we turn a full circle
