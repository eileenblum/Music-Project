Hiding your eyes from the sight
Your life thrown away years ago
The dragon has stolen your pride
Swallowed your dignity whole

Contemplate your lonely death
The choices you have made
Lying still in your own filth
Your sanity decays

Your body decayed from inside
Your will falters and dies
Deep inside a spark lingers on
Trapped you will live on

Contemplate your lonely death
The choices you have made
Lying still in your own filth
Your sanity decays

How did I get here? Where did I go?
Why did I take my first hit?
The reasons are pointless, the arguments void
You dealt with the dealers of shit

Struggle to wake from this hell
Shadows close in round the room
Locked in your personal cell
Your body becomes your tomb

Contemplate your lonely death
The choices you have made
Lying still in your own filth
Your sanity decays
