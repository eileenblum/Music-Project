Meditation, the thrill of the kill
Exploitation, the price of the hunt
Cruelty and degradation
Open season on the old and the runt

I need to see the body count, on that my mind is set
I want to kill, I love to kill, and what I want I get
Living for the moment of emptying my guns
The predator has come
And when the dollars turn to blood, youÂll drink them like a whore
In a year I will come back and look to kill some more
Living for the moment, of carnage by the ton
The predator has come

Salivation, excitement and fear
Around me death is near
Termination with no thought
Eliminating any soul caught

I need to see the body count, on that my mind is set
I want to kill, I love to kill, and what I want I get
Living for the moment of emptying my guns
The predator has come
And when the dollars turn to blood, you'll drink them like a whore
In a year I will come back and look to kill some more
Living for the moment, of carnage by the ton
The predator has come

Humankind: The ultimate prey
For your greed, now you pay
Terror will reign here
Insanity now draws near

I need to see your body die, on that my mind is set
I want you dead, I want your head, and what I want I get
Living for the moment of ripping out your lungs
The predator has come
And when the bullets cut you down, will you turn and roar?
Will you see the flesh tear free as your lifeblood hits the floor?
Living for the moment of seeing your skin hung
The predator has come
The predator is here
