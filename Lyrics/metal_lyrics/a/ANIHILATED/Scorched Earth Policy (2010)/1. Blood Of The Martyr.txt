Bring to me your only child and bring to me your wife
Bring to me your hard-earned cash and bring to me your life
Place your faith in me alone, obey my every word
Come to me and live in bliss, my outlook is unflawed

Blood of the martyr flows free in my veins
My madness is irrelevant, I revel in fame
The lost and the ignorant flock to my hall
The weak and malevolent, they all hear the call

Give me all your riches and give to me your wealth
I will take your money and spend it on myself
I make love to your daughter, your sister and your son
And be worshiped here on Earth as God's chosen one

Blood of the martyr flows free in my veins
My madness is irrelevant, I revel in fame
The lost and the ignorant flock to my hall
The weak and malevolent, they all hear the call

Any who leave us, possessed they must be,
Whoever would leave our blessed sanctuary?
An example be made of their unrighteous sin
For I have detected their Devil within

We all die together, united and free
Leaving sin behind and the Earth's misery
The blood of the martyr released me from its spell
The murder of innocence, the journey to hell

Blood of the martyr flows free in my veins
My madness is irrelevant, I revel in fame
The lost and the ignorant flock to my hall
The weak and malevolent, they all hear the call

So come all before me and drink from the cup
The chalice is poisoned, from it you must sup
Give it to the children, shirk and you die
Struck by the bullets I fire from on high

Give it to the children, shirk and you die
Struck by the bullets I fire from on high
