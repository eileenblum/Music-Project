Release, set me free
caught, in foreign fields
condemned, to slavery
marine, now detainee

Why, leave me here?
spare, me fear
far from home
lost in a war zone

Starved, condemned to life, here,
forced to fight war
death lives here

Decay, denied by the USA
denied by them
their embarrassment
far from home
lost in a war zone
