Apocalyptic death deadly rain
Orders from above, the insane
Retaliation strike, "it's our turn"
Turned to molten flesh we burn

Termination time pay the toll
Flames tear your flesh, burn your soul
Humanities time is done
Plunged into the flames of Armageddon

Mechanical error, twist of fate
Releases the weapons of hate
Reaper waits at hell's door
Defiling the dead with his claws

Termination time pay the toll
Flames tear your flesh, burn your soul
Humanities time is done
Plunged into the flames of Armageddon

The age of man dies
Unseen through scorched out eyes
Mutants arise from the ash
of a world destroyed in a flash

The rain of death from the sky
Ensures that we fry
Death, plunge, into the flames, of Armageddon
A thousand years cool the earth

One thousand years cool the earth
Begins a frozen rebirth
A new ice age has begun
But first we have to burn

Termination time pay the toll
Flames tear your flesh, burn your soul
Humanities time is done
Plunged into the flames of Armageddon
