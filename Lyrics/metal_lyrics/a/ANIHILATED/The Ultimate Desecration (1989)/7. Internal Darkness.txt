An enormous hole
Eaten away
By invisible gas
Causing decay

Cancer levels rise
The seasons change
Cataclysmic alteration
Nature dies in pain

Atmospheric screen
Filtration of the sun
The ultraviolet rays
To the earth they come

Too intense for the skin
Melanoma spreading fast
From an overdose of light
Flung into eternal dark

CFC the mistake is we realised far too late
Oh far too late too late
