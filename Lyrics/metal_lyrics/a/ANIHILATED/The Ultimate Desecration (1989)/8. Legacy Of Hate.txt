Cold, radioactive cloud, descends upon the earth
Freezes the sea.
Blinded by the snows glare,
We must prepare, we must beware
Of Nuclear winter.

A gigantic cloud forming in the atmosphere
Blocking out the sunlight
Effects of dust pollution a thousands years of night
Ending of creation.

Ice packs are forming
In the arctic wastes
Slowly moving southward

Remnants of humanity
Seek a safe new home
Descend into the earth

Blood congealing in the veins
Cannot reach the heart
Freeze to death, a legacy of hate

No more fires burning, from thermonuclear war
Winter is descending.
Complete, eternal darkness, arctic tundra void
Polar winds are howling.

Earth freezes over
Becomes a lifeless shell
Devoid of population.
The ground becomes a prison
For those who went below,
They begin mutating

Blood congealing in the veins
Cannot reach the heart
Freeze to death, a legacy of hate

At last the sky is clearing
Dust is blown away
The earth begins warming

Melting of the ice flow
Reveals a broken land
Wiped clean of desecration

Freed from their prison
The human race ascends
Blinded by the sunlight

Legacy of the ancients
Reveals a blank new world
For them to start afresh

Blood congealing in the veins
Cannot reach the heart
Freeze to death
A legacy of hate

Cold radioactive cloud
Descends upon the earth
Freezes the sea

Blinded by the snows glare
You must prepare you must beware
Of nuclear winter

WINTER
