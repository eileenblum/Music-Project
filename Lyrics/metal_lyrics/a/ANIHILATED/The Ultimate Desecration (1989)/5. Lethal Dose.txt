Over-spill of radiation
Arsenic and lead pollution
Excrement floating past,
Damaging the cytoplast.

Surface oil floating free
On the great eternal sea
End of life coming close
Giving us a lethal dose

Distemper of the canine breed
Product of our demon seed
Untreated waste flushed away
Into the sea diseases stray

Viral death stalks the deep
Contaminates the fish you eat
End of life coming close
Giving us a lethal dose

Toxic time bomb is set
Soon it will detonate
Destroy where life once came
Our greatest resource down the drain

A sterile pool of stagnant death
Will mans element be next?
End of life coming close
Giving us a lethal dose
