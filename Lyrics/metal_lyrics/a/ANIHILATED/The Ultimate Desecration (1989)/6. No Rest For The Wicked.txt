In the deepest darkest lair
The wicked plot mankind's despair
They never cease their endless quest
To sink their knives into your chest

And when your fate is thus complete
Upon your graves they'll dance their feet
And return once more unto their plans
To eliminate the race of man

War, all die within the zone
Flesh, ripped, torn from the bone
Fire, scorches, obliterates
Hate is all that it creates

You have lost this unholy war
No rest for the wicked their law
All must die

Plague festering body and mind
Rot, decay from the inside
Hell has come unto the earth
Released in the atomic burst

You have lost this unholy war
No rest for the wicked their law
All must die

No rest for the wicked
Their evil will live on
No rest for the wicked
Will mankind never learn?

From where has this evil rose?
Where does it go to hide?
Look to your own souls
For the wicked they dwell inside

No rest for the wicked
No returning to the void
No rest for the wicked
'Til mankind is destroyed

You have lost this unholy war
No rest for the wicked their law
All must die

Pain, final unyielding pulse
Relief as you give up the ghost
Terror the unknown to face
Death a new world to hate

You have lost this unholy war
No rest for the wicked their law
All must die

Return to earth to reign
And play their deadly games
The end results the same
You lose
