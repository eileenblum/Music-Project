Exquisite sacred creatures
Hunted to the brink of death
To give unscrupulous traders
Another form of wealth

Screaming skinned alive
Screaming skinned alive

Brutal act of genocide
To these creatures from the sea
Sunlight glints on sharpened steel
Sadistic killing spree

Screaming skinned alive
Screaming skinned alive

Indiscriminately dish out pain
Ending life spill blood
Savagely reveal the plot
A corpse turned inside out

Screaming skinned alive
Screaming skinned alive

Brutal act of genocide
To these creatures of the sea
Sunlight glints on sharpened steel
Sadistic killing spree

Screaming skinned alive
Screaming skinned alive

Even in your own homes
A witness to this scene
Scream out in anger
At fur coats so obscene

Screaming skinned alive
Screaming skinned alive

Brutal act of genocide
To these creatures from the sea
Sunlight glints on sharpened steel
Sadistic killing spree

Screaming skinned alive
Screaming skinned alive

A brief breeding spell
Allows the stocks to swell
The cull a call from hell

A year of needless pain
Blood will stain the ice
Young skins hung out to dry

WHY?
