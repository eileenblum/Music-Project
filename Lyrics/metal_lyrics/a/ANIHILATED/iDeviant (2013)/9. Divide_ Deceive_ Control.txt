Aberration sickness greed a selfish time
Burning their own houses, fighting crime with crime
No conscience, regret, feast, fuck, forget,
swallowed into the storm
Divide, Deceive, Control
Divide, Deceive, Control
Do the work of the state
Divide, Deceive, Control
The future lays in ruins, dead before it's time
A barren lifeless legacy, inheritance of pain
Feeding business, we bear witness to the insane human sickness
Divide, Deceive, Control
Divide, Deceive, Control
Do the work of the state
Divide, Deceive, Control
Morons fight amongst themselves without a second thought
Slash and burn the policy but it will come to naught
Fleecing the nation, mind masturbation, the sickness infects us all
Divide, Deceive, Control
Divide, Deceive, Control
Do the work of the state
Divide, Deceive, Control
The nation it ignores it all brushes it aside
Tells you that it is all a lie and then it hides behind
The politician's crocodilian smile of victory
Divide, Deceive, Control
Divide, Deceive, Control
Do the work of the state
Divide, Deceive, Control
Divide Control
Divide Control
Divide Control
Divide Control
Divide
Control
The Human Sickness
