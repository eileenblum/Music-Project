Checking your mind crimes against the state
Your thoughts your desires the dreams that you make
Communication is open to us
To think else but centre is poisonous
End of Free Speech
Death to the Deviant!
End of Free Will
Death to the Deviant!
Be careful be wary the witch-finders waiting
Laying the traps for those not conforming
Do not consider your thoughts to be free
We hold all the power as we control the streets
End of Free Speech
Death to the Deviant!
End of Free Will
Death to the Deviant now!
Stealing your freedom with the greatest of ease
Prepare the arrival of the thought crime police
Infesting, molesting your personal thoughts
Profiled person checking your haunts
Stealing your freedom with the greatest of ease
Await the arrival of the thought crime police
End of Free Speech
Death to the Deviant!
End of Free Will
Death to the Deviant!
NOW!
