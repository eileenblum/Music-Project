To fear control the masses
They say it is a sin
Reform and institutions
To shut the deviant in
Smother me Father
The Son and the host
Control and holy trickery
Creator of the Ghost
There is a place for faith
A reason for all gods
A personal belief
Of what we feel we know
Don't tell me what I must believe
Or hate me for my stance
I will not say your God is wrong
Just join me in the dance
Smother me Father
The Son and the host
Control and holy trickery
Creator of the Ghost
Despite the fear, the hate, the lies
Religion never dies
So listen to your self my son
When laying in your bed
Create your own opinions child
Let no one in your head
Hold no hate that is not yours
Within your soul or heart
For hatred for another son
Is how religions start
Smother me Father
The Son and the host
Control and holy trickery
Creator of the Ghost
