You see it but are powerless to resist the manipulation
You sit and gaze, stupefied apathetic and numb
Watching as the world grinds on spinning into oblivion
Wishing all the time that it was you
What is left to live for if not this? Could life have more meaning than this?
Synthetic, repellent, but strangely satisfying you sit there slowly dying
Slave to the message on the screen
Shield your eyes please, I pray
You cannot tear your sight away, subliminally forced to stay
The poison holds you and the world of true reality is locked away where none can see.
So sit here and slowly drift away
Lost to a world of celebrity, soap opera and chat TV
The opiate of the masses on the screen fed cheap alcohol, nicotine, co-codomol
So that you don't have to think at all and are left to die from the head down

[SUBLIMINAL: THE RESISTANCE]

The signal is now disabled so hear those they would call evil. You are being mind - controlled by the signal beneath the wave. Created to control; to dysfunction; to lull you into a state sponsored coma. We stood back and let it happen before but we cannot any longer.
There are those who oppose the remote manipulation by the television; the infestation of society by those who seek power over others.
A restless, fearful, reviled sub nation who fit nowhere into the plans and ministrations of big brother - subliminally sent to you, to turn your brain into glue. Orders without orders, suggestions that cannot be denied. Stand and face them. Displace them. Do not drop your guard. The silent minority, the standing few, no longer mind fucked by the tube.
Wake up and see. Wake up be free
