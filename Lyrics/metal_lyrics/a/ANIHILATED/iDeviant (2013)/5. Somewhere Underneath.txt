I make no excuses
I am fuelled by rage
Despite my best intentions
The beast in the cage
Driven by despair
I kill because I care
Until I take no more
Then the beast will roar
Somewhere underneath the demon Lurks
Somewhere underneath the madness works
Someone take responsibility
Respond to this hostility
I stand and shake with apoplexy
And then I draw my gun
Somewhere underneath the demon lurks
Somewhere underneath the madness works
Driven by despair (my wrath)
I kill because I care (not enough)
Jesus told me (so do it)
Justice ends with this bullet
Somewhere underneath the demon lurks
Somewhere underneath the madness works
Bursting out freely from somewhere underneath
Drag you down screaming to somewhere underneath
