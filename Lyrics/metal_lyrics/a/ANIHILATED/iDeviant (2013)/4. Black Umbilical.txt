Children connect to the monster in the room
Its glowing eye controls the mind tells them of their doom
What to eat and what to wear who to love and hate
When to laugh, how to cry, who to inseminate
Silent and compliant constant intermission
Obedient to the orders from the screen
Don't think just watch, a member of the cult
Your brain grows fat and then they feed
Growing from infancy plugged direct to your TV
Let the signal soothe your troubled mind
A product of society a symptom of our apathy
Slipped before the one eyed babysitter
Only one way to free them from this doom
Cut the black umbilical the link to surrogate womb
Growing from infancy plugged direct to your TV
Let the signal soothe your troubled mind
Cyclopean gaze from the cradle to the slave
Cyclopean gaze from the cradle to the slave
Cyclopean gaze from the cradle to the slave
Waiting for the feedback to begin
Force fed shit, force fed lies, see the truth through other eyes
Having no opinion of your own
Growing from infancy plugged direct to your TV
Let the signal soothe your troubled mind
Crack the whip crack the whip, the circus begins
The only info state controlled production of the scum
Dictatorships control the feed to keep their people dumb
