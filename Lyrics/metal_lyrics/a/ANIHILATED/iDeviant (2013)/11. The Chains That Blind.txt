The cross, the blood before me
Imprinted in my brain
Standing as a monolith
A symbol of the pain
Break the chains that bind
The chains that make you blind
Ignorant to sin
Unless we break the chains
Fleeing from the future trying to pull back
Darkness overtaking me blood is turning black
Dying earth our legacy, to underline supremacy
Knowing our stupidity
The sufferance of man
Break the chains that bind
The chains that make you blind
Ignorant to sin
Unless we break the chains
Left to walk this cursed earth
The ones that did not die
DC'd from the info feed, freely without lies
Shame regret and disbelief
How did we last this long?
Armed with our technology
A quest for wealth the crime
Break the chains that bind
The chains that make you blind
Ignorant to sin
Unless we break the chains
The chains will go on and on
Binding us 'til kingdom come
The chains will go on and on
Binding us 'til kingdom come
The chains will go on and on
Binding us 'til kingdom come
The chains will go on and on
Binding us 'til kingdom come
Wake up and see
Wake up be free
