Bury the dead in the glory of war
Hero or victim or one to abhor
All crushed beneath propaganda machine
To win hearts and minds with a shock awe regime
Burning behind the lies, searing within the mind
The rules of engagement the threshold is reached
The wicked in power should all be impeached
The death of a soldier, the price of revenge
War is a business the business of blood
Support the rich presidential godhood
Deification of war monger one
A national hero, it's favourite son
Demonization of enemy mine
Dehumanising their family line
Burning behind the lies, searing within the mind
Rules of engagement the threshold is reached
Wicked in power should all be impeached
Death of a soldier, the price of revenge
War is a business the business of blood
Support the rich presidential godhood
Creating widows and orphans alike
Life turned to ashes a town set alight
Bring democracy and law
Bring democracy to the poor
The dead will declare there's no glory in war
No winner, just victims cut to the floor
I have no faith in propaganda machines
You cannot win hearts with a shock awe regime
Burning behind the lies, searing within the mind
Rules of engagement the threshold is reached
Wicked in power should all be impeached
Death of a soldier, the price of revenge
War is a business the business of blood
Support the rich presidential godhood
Aid those who oppose them, weapons we send
The enemy of my enemy is my friend
Aid those who oppose them, weapons we send
The enemy of my enemy is my friend
