Growing of my empire, a nation of sin
Will you commit the treason so I will let you in?
Joining my masses of tortured lost souls
The diseased and the damaged, free from their holes
Your life it will belong to me, your money will be spent
Will is twisted in my hands, go wherever sent
You may even kill for me lose your hold on sanity
Once I have my hands on you I will not relent
The nation turns its back on us, outcast we become
Underclass of nowhere men, living off the scum
Did you think I cared for you, that all my gifts were free?
Unless you break away from them, you're mine eternally
Your life it will belong to me, your money will be spent
Will is twisted in my hands, go wherever sent
You may even kill for me lose your hold on sanity
Once I have my hands on you I will not relent
Lord of the flies; Lord of all lies
Pretend to be your all time friend, I hold you close to me
Cage you with my kindness, and never let you leave
Create for you a way of life that you cannot escape
Until you suffer everything you cannot get away
Your life it will belong to me, your money will be spent
Will is twisted in my hands, go wherever sent
You may even kill for me lose your hold on sanity
Once I have my hands on you I will not relent
Lord of the flies; Lord of all lies
