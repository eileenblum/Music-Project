Silently the web was spun
Brought to life by our will
Caress you with an iron fist
Though we are many we are one
Stamp out all resistance
Terminate unique
Androgynous and faceless
Prey upon the weak
Suck you in spit you out
You will fall have no doubt
Merciless and cold
Though we are many we are one
Possessed is the word
Obsession with the perfect world
Spawning clones of ourselves
Increase the hate increase the wealth
A single minded nation
Of a single mind
Cathode ray injected
Though we are many we are one
Stamp out all resistance
Terminate unique
Androgynous and faceless
Prey upon the weak
Suck you in spit you out
You will fall have no doubt
Merciless and cold
Though we are many we are one
We are one
We are one
We are legion
We are one
We are one
We are legion
Suffer all the children
Bring them here to me
Worship with devotion
We testify to thee
You will think just like us
Children vacant and spineless
There will be no dissention
Though we are many we are one
Stamp out all resistance
Terminate unique
Androgynous and faceless
Prey upon the weak
Suck you in spit you out
You will fall have no doubt
Merciless and cold
Though we are many we are one
We are one
We are one
We are legion
We are one
We are one
