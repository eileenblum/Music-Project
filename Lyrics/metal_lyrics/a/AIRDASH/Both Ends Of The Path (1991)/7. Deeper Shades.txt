Good morning sun nice to see you again
Do you know what was going last night?
Tell about mad occasions I have sown
The tale of lovers, killer and dealers

I can see deep and deeper shades
Yet the deepest is pretty much the same

I saw pale face with two green men
They were making up names just for fun
Man ran away and ended up dead
He wanted a shower but slipped down the drain

No one likes
To be a stereotype
To be a someone without fingerprints or a face

I can see deep and deeper shades
Yet the deepest is pretty much the same
Endless change keeps me awake
Darkness in light - there's something I like

Bye bye bye I do another round
Tap tap tap I do my tapping down
I'll be back at dawn to hear some more
Now climb your steps to the 21st floor

No one likes
To be a stereotype
To be someone without fingerprints or a face

I can see deep and deeper shades
Yet the deepest is pretty much the same
Endless change keeps me awake
Darkness in light
