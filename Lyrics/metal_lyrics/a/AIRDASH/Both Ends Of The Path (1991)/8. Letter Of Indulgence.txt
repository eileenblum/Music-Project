People are telling me about the desperate times
To which our sins are soon us leading
The world is poisoned by the devil deeds we've done
We must appease the angered gods

Can't you see that country dies
Taken over by surprise

I don't know why the claim we should change
Our ways of life
I don't know why my hands are dirty
There is no time to think, I've got to be going now
I'll make a confession still some day

Public opinion is to care
So I have to pay my share

Each must take part
I just don't belong
Goals are so far
"Have you ever thought of thinking?"

They keep on preaching that the end is coming
If we don't go back to where we started
I've had enough I can't take that shit no more
I need a letter of indulgence

They keep on preaching that the end is coming
If we don't go back to where we started
I said: enough

I've got a letter of indulgence

Each must take part
I just don't belong
Goals are so far
"Have you ever thought of thinking?"
