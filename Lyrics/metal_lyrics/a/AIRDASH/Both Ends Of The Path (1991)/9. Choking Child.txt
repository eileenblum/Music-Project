Seek power, gain trust
Vote yourself in election
Be nothing, do nothing
Be just a numb politician
I'm a true believer of a real deceiver
Could you believe

You built a world for me to live in
All the good things you gave
For good cause we fight wars
Maybe I'm not so fond of your world
We are the children breathing vomit
From the past

Breathe, Breathe chocking child - Let me help you
Breathe, Breathe chocking child - Don't die
Breathe, Breathe chocking child - Will to live
Breathe, Breathe, Breathe - Let me help you now

They say it's real, but it's a dream
We aren't equal in the eyes of law
Not yet, maybe never
Maybe I'm just a fool
I hope right deeds will grow seeds
Into an act

I vote justice, I vote peace
So I won't vote at all
As long as man have to prove
His innocence in a court
Why do you feed me if I am not hungry

Breathe, Breathe chocking child - Let me help you
Breathe, Breathe chocking child - Don't die
Breathe, Breathe chocking child - Will to live
Breathe, Breathe, Breathe - Let me help you now

Do what you want if you don't think it's wrong
Do what you please, watch out for others feet
Individual rights balance a million people
If you want to kill people, dress up in green
- And join to army

Breathe, Breathe chocking child - Let me help you
Breathe, Breathe chocking child - Don't die
Breathe, Breathe chocking child - Will to live
Breathe, Breathe, Breathe - Let me help you now
[Repeat]
