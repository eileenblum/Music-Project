I never knew that moment could
Last longer than forever
The moment that it takes to change
After giving the strings to an mp
Responsible of nothing
Explanations and promises are talk
I always thought that I'm not the one
Who is digging in the dirt
After "miscalculation" the blaming finger
Is pointing at an empty shirt
I need no one to explain
Give me someone to blame
The lonely top where phony jokes
Keep licking each others' ass

[Chorus]:
Piece by piece they built a wall of silence
Built to last against riots and violence
Brains are stunned and lips are sealed
Staring at one point
Piece by piece they built a world of silence
There's no place to hide
When silent feeling screams

It isn't hard to be brave
In your own corner table
If something comes up
Keep your mouth shut
Just look like a VIP
So close that I could touch
So close that the official mouth
Is wise to keep shut
I wonder when this hiding ends
And someone takes a stand when the ceiling comes too low
And the walls collapse
Neutral policy
The taste of caffeine
Leave the bed and go ahead
Find out what comes up

[Chorus]

Whose to blame anyway
I don't know no one explains
Whose to blame anyway
At least there is no one to blame
Whose to blame anyway
They' all look the same they all look gray
Whose to blame anyway
"No comments is all I got to say"
