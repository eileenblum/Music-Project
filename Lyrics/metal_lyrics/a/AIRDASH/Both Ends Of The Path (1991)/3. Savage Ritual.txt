A picture comes to silver screen
Air floats serene
Pieces join the company
Walls around me

Time takes a lie
In the opening scene
But I don't eat this shit
About Adam and Eve

Page by page the book reaches the end
Written and read, but left unsaid
Ultimate greediness got four souls to feed
No use to preach about wound not yet seen

Nature signs an evergreen
Reminds me of black trees
Rain drop falls on a leaf
It corrodes the skin and the cancer wins

Acid razor cuts my face
- To whom it may concern -
After the raid left in disgrace
- To someone who may care -

Written in rock
My last will
- To someone who may care -
- To whom it may concern -

Figure, shapes, colors and the magic sound
Hills, lakes, springs and the wind
