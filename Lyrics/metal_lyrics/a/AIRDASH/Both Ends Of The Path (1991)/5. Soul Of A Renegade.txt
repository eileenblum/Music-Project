Awoken by the thought
Of a never-ending agony
He took the right to break the chains
But they stole the wind beneath his wings

They wanted to make it clear
It's them he must fear
They liked to interfere
Switch off his rebellious mind

They made you a real deal, a fair deal
They offered you freedom for your thoughts
Well, sometimes confession can be a crime

So they locked you away for a thousand years
And tortured your mind with their own fear
They raped your thoughts with disbelief
Another day will break
The pain might ease, but the scars remain
They deprived your dignity

Impropriate behaviour
Your crazy fantasies
'Bout opposing governmental power
Don't fit in this society

They made you a real deal, a fair deal
They offered you freedom for your thoughts
Well, sometimes confession can be a crime
Did you ever realize?

So they locked you away for a thousand years
And tortured your mind with their own fear
They raped your thoughts with disbelief
Another day will break
For you the soul of a renegade
They deprived your dignity

Did you ever realize
That they could lock away
Your rebellious soul
They locked you away
