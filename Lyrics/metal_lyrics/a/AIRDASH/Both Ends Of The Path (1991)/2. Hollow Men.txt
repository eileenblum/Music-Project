You look a bit pale under your blanket
Didn't see the sun, but you saw the sunset
It's a bit shame
You look a bit pale
You haven't got a gran to meet in afternoons
Didn't feel OK - You skipped school
It's a bit shame
You don't feel OK
Watching four o'clock rerun
Eating lunch from the barrel of a gun
World has gone crazy
Out of it's mind
You got an idea
You heard it from a seet
Watching the five o'clock rerun
Wondering how it will be done
It's a voice of a lost generation
A bit shame
It's the way we head to the end
Not with a bang, but with the hollow men
You got a big hole in your raincoat
If storm break out you'll need a boat
It's a bit shame
Now it starts to rain
You spent five years in the famous high-school
Graduation day didn't wait for you
It's a bit shame
You did it in vain
Watching six o'clock rerun
The barrel is filled up, up to it's brim
It's a voice of a lost generation
A bit shame
It's the way we head to the end
Not with the bang, but with the hollow men
Mind masturbation in your lazy chair
You missed all the action cause the game was so fair
Eruption is close, but you will never come
It's a voice of a lost generation
A bit shame
It's the way we head to the end
