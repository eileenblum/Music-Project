Take a look down at the seaside
Do you recall that old white house
There is a garden full of black flowers
An old man sitting by the window
He's trying to find the peace of mind
He's dreaming of something
Trying to remember
Life doesn't exist anymore
Feel no hate
Feel no pain
He stands at the of the path
