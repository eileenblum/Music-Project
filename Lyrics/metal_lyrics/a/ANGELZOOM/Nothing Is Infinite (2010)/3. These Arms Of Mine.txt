IÂ´m standing at the roadside - IÂ´m the grass
Observing frightend amazed the whole world
the sky is clear, sometimes falls rain on me
Migratory birds fly southbound
I look up to the cars are rolling past
I try to look inside of oneÂ´s (at) last
A little child  weeps bitter painful tears
I try to understand - what she feels

I  fall down - she is crying on
And I know - IÂ´m alone

Suddenly comes a thunderstorm
In the dark I try to find home

I feel in these arms of mine
ItÂ´s in my own right
No one cries
I know in these arms of mine
No one hurts
let it shine

I feel good- no more pain for sure
And I know IÂ´m secure
I find home- despite the darkest night
In my own right shines a light

I feel in these arms of mine
ItÂ´s in my own right
No one cries
I know in these arms of mine
No one hurts
You let it shine

IÂ´m standing at the roadside - IÂ´m the grass
Observing frightend amazed the whole world
