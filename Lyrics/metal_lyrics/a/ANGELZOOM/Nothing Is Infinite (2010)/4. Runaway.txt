People run away
and donÂ´t look back
But even in their eyes
you see the wrong track
People lost their dreams
theyÂ´re not as right as rain
And even in their eyes
you sense the pain

Run away
and your dreams will fade away
Believe in you
itÂ´s easier to stay
Run away
and you will never find the end
Your fears will fade away
when you will stay

People live their life
they take on challenges
Even in their eyes
you see no fear
People live their dreams
they are as right as rain
And even in their eyes
there is no pain
