WeÂ´ll always create perfect human
WeÂ´re  always form decent results
Seperate the DNS
killing our tenderness

Cloned people exist and run
A finest selection health and strong
exemplary locked and secure â¦ they were
consciously manufactured

They are so real and all so nice
Appreciate weight and price 
They are divided into pieces
here a lever, there a heart

Who said we were humans

Lord-Why does it happen?
