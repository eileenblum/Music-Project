Waiting for a pitch-black night
Where Angels do fall down
The place where kings have lost their heads
And the desert hate a town
Where our hearts were grazing
Where I plant
There I plant a maple tree
With my own hands

Everyone cares each day
In life and farewell
Behind the sky I care for you
Everyone cares each day
Cause life means farewell
Behind the sky IÂ´m guarding you

Waiting for a blood-red dawn
Where angels bleed for you
IÂ´m watching you beyond the sky
IÂ´m longing for a new
A new life in your cold world
Where I plant
Where I plant a tree for you
With my own hands

Everyone cares each day
In life and farewell
Behind the sky I care for you
Everyone cares each day
Cause life means farewell
Behind the sky IÂ´m guarding you
