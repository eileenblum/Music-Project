I feel the emptiness
Inside my soul
so cold
I fight against my tears
I`m crying silent
hold me

hold my hand and take me to my Innermost
there where I can remember
what I feel now
deeper to my soul
myself
to the Innermost where I remember
what I feel

I loose my balance now
inside of me
guide me
I fight against the pain
for the salvation
heal me

Flying leaves everywhere
Gliding feathers in the air
And I know
I will fly

hold my hand and take me to my Innermost
there where I can remember
what I feel now
deeper to my soul
myself
to the Innermost where I remember
what I feel
