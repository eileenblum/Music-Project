Stories of old
And lost generations
Tell about princes
Saving the weak
Community was
People's salvation
Creating the heroes
Protecting the weak

All we own is this handsome world
All we have is this fragile world
All these treasures we're saving
All our lives we'll stay craving

Stories of old
For new generations
Together we're stronger than war
We'll climb every mountain
We all have the same hot red blood
Drink from the same fountain

All we own is this handsome world
All we have is this fragile world
All these treasures we're saving
All our lives we'll stay craving

doo doo doo
doo doo
doo doo doo ....
All we own is this handsome world
All we have is this one small world
