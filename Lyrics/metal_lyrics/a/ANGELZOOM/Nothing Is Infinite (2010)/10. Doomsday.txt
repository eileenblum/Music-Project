I couldn't lie in my bed
I was lost in fear of death
Couldn't find a way to sleep
The abyss ahead was dark and deep

But someone - then opened my mind
made me able to fly with time - ahead
the stranger was holding my hand
and I could see the rebirth of a land 

On the eve of our doomsday
I fell in love in a stronger way
the magic creature from deepest space
gave me safety and hope for a better future place

I couldn't lie in my bed
I was lost in fear of death
Couldn't find a way to sleep
The abyss ahead was dark and deep

But someone - then opened my mind
made me able to fly with time - ahead
the stranger was holding my hand
and I could see the rebirth of a land 

On the eve of our doomsday
I fell in love in a stronger way
the magic creature from deepest space
gave me safety and hope for a better future place

On the eve of our doomsday
I fell in love in a stronger way
The lovely stranger from a distant place
gave me safety and hope for a better future place

On the eve of our doomsday
I fell in love in a stronger way
The lovely stranger from deepest space
gave me safety and hope for a better future place
