Hypnotised
I hear a dark voice
I feel dazed
I have no choice

Days gone by
I feel I`m weightless
I have lost my mind
And I still (start to)

Fly

Trust me now my angel    
You`re what I made - You can`t escape

Dreams pass by
Regain consciousness
Sensetive to pain
But I still

Fly

Trust me now my angel    
You`re what I made - You can`t escape

Don`t lead me back                    
I`m feeling high, let me still fly
