[feat. Apocalyptica]

If I was a bird in your hand
Longing for a new Fairyland
You've opened up my door
You've set me free
Always would return to your hand

If I was a Pearl on the Ground
Only deep blue Sea all around
But you would find my Light
You'll rescuse me
One day, when all my calls will resound

But if I was a Flash in your Daydream
One Day you'll see my Sign on your way

[Chorus:]
I turn the sky to dive into your dreams
I'd turn the sky to fall into your dreams
A million times for you
I hope, I beg and pray for you

A million times for you
I hope, I beg and pray for you

If I was a Tear on your Face
Fallen like a Star lost in Space
I crossed your Galaxy a hundred times
To fall asleep inside your Embrace

But if I was a Flash in your Daydream
One Day you'll see my Sign - I will wait
I wait

[Chorus 2x]
