There's something inside me
That pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control I fear
Is never ending
Controlling...

I can't seem
To find myself again
My Walls are closing in
I've felt this way before
To find myself again
My Walls are closing in
I've felt this way before
So insecure

[Chorus:]
Crawling in my skin
These Wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort, endlessly
Has pulled itself upon me
Distracing, reacting
Against my will I stand
Beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem...

To find myself again
My Walls are closing in
I've felt this way before
To find myself again
My Walls are closing in
I've felt this way before
So insecure

[Chorus 2x]
