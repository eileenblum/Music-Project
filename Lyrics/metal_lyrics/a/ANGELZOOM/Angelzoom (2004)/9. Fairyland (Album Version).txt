Colder than Ice
The World falls apart
Cold like a Stone
The spell on the Souls
Colder than ice
Your hand on my Heart
A world made of stone
Let tenderness freeze

[Chorus:]
Save the Fairyland we live in
Where all failings are forgiven
Feel like hunted by a Griffin
I fall down
Straight down
Save the Fairyland we live in
Where my failings are forgiven
Feel like hunted by a Griffin
I'm falling straight down

Catch my Daydream
Catch my Fall

Colder than Ice
Night all around
Cold like a stone
The Heart of success
Wasteland of Ice
We fall to the Ground
A World made of Stone
Let Tenderness freeze

[Repeat Chorus]

Falling down
Falling down
Catch me
When I'm falling down
Please come to me...

[Repeat Chorus 2x]
