[feat. Roedernallee]

My steps within three feet elsewhere
They say: don't dare, don't leave that square
My will, their will, can move, stand still
My part, no heart, I must fulfill

Like a rising Monster
All veiled in grey
See the walls of Dawn
They warn you of the day

[Chorus:]
Come back my dream
Into my Arms
Into my Arms

[Chorus]

Their will, my will, just act, don't feel
Their kind, my kind, brought me to heal
Accused of something, nothing all alone
I had to bang the nails into my head
The guilty one

[Chorus 3x]
