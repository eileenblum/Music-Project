Otium cum dignitate
Otium cum dignitate
Otium

Sun shines bright
My heart is laughing
I'm happy
What I do is nothing

A light heart

Otium cum dignitate
Otium cum dignitate
Otium

A light heart

Worries have to be driven far away
Only love can bright your day
Waft yourself to regions of stars and light
It's shimmer still beams clear and bright

With my childlike heart
And trusting mind
I'm glad about and blithely
What I find

A light heart

Worries have to be driven far away
Only love can bright your day
Waft yourself to regions of stars and light
It's shimmer still beams clear and bright
At night
