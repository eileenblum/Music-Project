I sit at home
Look out my window
Snow all around
I hear a sweet sound
I see Santa Claus
Dream of a sleigh ride
And angels sing a song

Tonight your eyes shine like a Christmas dream
Silent night you've found your way to me
Eyes shine like a Christmas dream
Your light inside my heart

Inside your smile
My world is turning
Sweet scent abounds
All candles burning
You paint the Christmas stars
On painted heaven
And angels sing a song

Tonight your eyes shine like a Christmas dream
Silent night you've found your way to me
Eyes shine like a Christmas dream
Your light inside my heart

Tonight your eyes shine like a Christmas dream
Silent night you've found your way to me
Eyes shine like a Christmas dream
Your light inside my heart
