[feat. Milu / Mila Mar]

Why cry all the people
Staring at the sky?
Listen to the Preachermen who prophesies
Angels lost their light
Can't give us a new dawn.
A kingdom of no faith and hope is born

[Chorus:]
One light will tear apart the night
Bringing back a newborn sun
One light will tear apart the night
Bringing back a newborn sun

Why die all the angels
Guarding our light?
Lost inside the maze of
Everlasting night.
People broke their heart with bombs and guns and greed
Shaped a desert based on hate and need

[Chorus]

Why cry all the angels
Staring at the rain?
Watching all the children
Who got fathers cane
Won't we ask that god
Do harmony on earth
That peace and love and hope our hearts reserve.

[Chorus]
