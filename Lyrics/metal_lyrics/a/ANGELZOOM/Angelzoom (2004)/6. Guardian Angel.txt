I send a request to your heart
My hope is gone it tears my dreams apart
I lay my head now down to sleep
The time is now to find out what I need

I loose my way, I journey far
On roads of heaven fills with love

My guardian angels preach to my heart
Follow the moonbeam and the spark

Another time
Another place
A better time to make it something true
Another life
Another love
I wish my dreams come true, what can I do

I loose my way, I journey far
On roads of heaven fills with love

My guardian angels preach to my heart
Follow the moonbeam and the spark
