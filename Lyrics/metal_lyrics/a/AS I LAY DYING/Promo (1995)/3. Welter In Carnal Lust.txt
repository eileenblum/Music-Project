I'm deeply delighted by your glamorous beauty
In a magic realm we linger forevermore

A glint warms my heart like sunbeams the earth
Impassioned love-affair of eternal glee

Lovelorn harmony, here to respire
We lust in ecstasy, forever combined

Softly the wind touches our bodies
We do breathe fragrant fulfillment

Welter in carnal lust

A glint warms my heart like sunbeams the earth
Impassioned love-affair of eternal glee

Lovelorn harmony, here to respire
We lust in ecstasy, forever combined
