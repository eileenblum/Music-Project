every breath caustic air. poisons breach my lips. shackles of skin burn me. lonesome for a world where no one lives. i don't belong here. next to saints and thieves. i belong amongst a void in an absence of feeling. i must be destroyed. to rest. un-tormented by waking hours. unscathed by uncertainty. never to be taunted by an ambivalent god. to rest. un-tempted by the flesh. unscathed by uncertainty. never to be taunted by an ambivalent god. diem perdidi donatio mortis causa. HATE. HATE. HATE. HATE. we are a legion of vermin. the dominant species, a parasitic race. the time has come for an interregnum. come armageddon. i beg you to come. end this madness. we deserve nothing at all. none but agony. humanity must fall. coerced by nonexistence. my morbid request. into the void. bring us all death.
