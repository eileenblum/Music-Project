to welcome the withering. the sweltering has come to an end. burnt and empty just like me. falling into autumn. open up the flood gates. submerging capernaum. we are all messiahs. we are all heretics. it fears me but not my words. nor callousness. nor disgust. buried deep behind my eyes. swells beneath my disguise. it fears me but not my words. nor callousness. nor disgust. in emptiness I reside. the fragile hollow of a beautiful lie. there's no peace in decay. and in life there is no certainty. there's no peace in death. not until I can hold it. the serenity that death offers me. the silence of the soil. i've bricked and mortared the east gate. there's no sympathy here. i'd rather writhe in perdition than slip through martyred hands.
