Your vacant eyes tell a tale of beckoned deceit. Your skin pale and lifeless, this is where redemption and revenge meet. A lover's grip around the neck of that which I cherish. If I've been the ills that beg you, why must you haunt me?

No deed be forgiven, no deed gone unpunished. For the lack of compassion, for the sake of hatred. You've instilled a loathing reminder, you've awakened unbearable lust.

I bask in ravenous glory. I will seize the day, amongst days.

Consumed with apathy and disgust. Bearing witness to the Hells that have become me. An undying hatred. The bitter taste of inerted sorrow. Claw out my eyes. Take from me my heart. But still I'll stop at nothing to fall asleep to your screams. And as the warm light fades from your eyes I'll kiss your ghost in my dreams.

Sleep.

Gods won't stop me. Hell won't have me.

I bask in ravenous glory. I will seize the day, amongst my last days.

Immortal. Immortality
