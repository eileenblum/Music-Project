Hope slumbers
In abyss.
Swallowing
The light.
Long since leaving
This world behind.
Infrequent and feeble.
Bound to its imperfections.

Entombed together within this common enemy.
Endless search for answers.

Together in this void
Prodding the kindling anew.
Now there's nothing
Left to burn.
Nothing else to give.

Freedom is a finite being.
This decorated cage will wash clean,
Its biomass cycles
until the ground is gone.
Foundations collapsing all around
Footprints in the sand, drowning with the tide.
Infinity swept away as dreams become denied.
There is always something
But in the end, its ambivalence has to die.
