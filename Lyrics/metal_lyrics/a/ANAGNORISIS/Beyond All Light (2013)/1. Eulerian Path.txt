Twilight and high tide.
Drowning myself in the darkness.
Godâs light removed.
Innocence lost in the current.

Born from the stars of a different hemisphere
I am the black flame
Swallower of light.

Abuse to photosynthesize.
Fictitious peace blooming in distress.
Morning glory mourning through
Vegetation whispered lullabies.
Looming dawn tearing at the night.

Zasas! 

The world treeâs void is my seed
embracing ideation fantasy.
Prayers/pleads/screams
Nowhere to hide but eternal night.
In reflection, through taking the helm
Divine presence deceased
Truth within this solitude
No trinity, only me.

Violence, heralding in a new path.

A new era of unrelenting woe
Imprisoned within my caustic flesh.
A sentence not placated by time. 
Abandoned and misled from life.
No guided path back from sacrifice.
