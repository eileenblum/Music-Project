All my failures begging for an end.
These false promises becoming anchors
Drowning with the hopes of something real. 
Estranged to this person I've become
I feel contempt and diseased.
Solidifying my hatred of forced existence.
Pestilence pulses through my veins
Paralyzing me.
It keeps me from draining it all. 

This place I dwell is a hollowed man. 
Boarded up and black with rot. 
I dream in better lights with less reflection.
Shadows upon shadows cast inside    

Like death masks piled on until thereâs no identity. 
I know there must be more to me.

I raise my eyes upward, into the night. 
Into the darkness that existed before the light.
Downward to death, the foundation of all life.

Sigil marked for non-existence.
This cursed blood can't kill what's already dead inside.

It becomes misplaced to those I call friends.  
As I attempt to terraform this misery.

Caustic is my nature. 
Eroding life around me
Self-hatred binds my will to change.

As a lion let me drink from blood of your Christ
Awaiting salvation with open jaws
Shepherding hope into the belly of the beast.
Digesting tired faith and shitting out lies

I don't deserve happiness.
I haven't earned the right to self-peace. 
Preservation through malice is the irony 
As I'm consumed with thoughts of death. 
When time comes 
I'll enter my forest with no ribbon, just rope.
