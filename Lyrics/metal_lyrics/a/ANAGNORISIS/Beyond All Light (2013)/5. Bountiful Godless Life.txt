A sea of hollowed stalks
Breaking in the wind.
Weathering the torment
Without sickle bringing end.

Diseased wrought and dying
Lusting for the dust.
Soil longing to be nourished
Selfishly awaiting the rotting husk.

In this bountiful godless life!

Call to the end.
A playwright always has a stop.
Burdened by social taboos
Nailed to the fucking cross.
Ending life before godâs time
A testament to true satanic rite.
Transcending beyond all light.

Illuminated by fire
This weakened state
Like a temple set ablaze.
Tearing at the roots
To purge this buried fear.

Shedding this christian skin
To be reborn in blackest sin!

Scorching this field of purgatory
Intent on ending this plague.
Every grain blanketed by ash
As pantheons
Dawn a reddish haze.
I'll lay down my arms
When everything I know is dead and gone.

There is no dying, alone.
Only leaving or being left behind.

In this bountiful godless life
Nothing is forbidden.
Doing what must be done
through self-annihilation.

No honor in existing for others.
Everyone will fail you, in due time.
Fear no man, or god
As you walk away from the sun.
