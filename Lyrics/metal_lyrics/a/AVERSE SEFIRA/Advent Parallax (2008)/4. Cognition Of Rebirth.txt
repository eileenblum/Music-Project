Cancerous Redeemer
Sick touch of the black
Awaken into new worlds
Adjust to foreign eyes
Our own
Becoming vision

Dimensional Perceptions
Float and Interlock
Abyss between Idea
And Actual collide
Now one
Transmigration

Negative conceiving
Itself as a Positive
Extraced in Recursion
Kingdoms of Unbalanced Force

Machine â Rancid
Eldritch â Cosmic
Undying

Broken open
Wandering Unmanned

Form dissolute
Reaching into Aeons Past

Inexorable Volition
Travel Indefinite

Travel arrested
By the astral lugubrious
I know the subtlety of horns

Sacrificial urn
Bearing a cremated hand
To touch the World
Beyonde

Arclit visage of decomposition
Ejected biological
Trapped in a fascination of the process.

Ineffable Flesh of Ages

I open the Door
I am beneath the sky
I feel the Breath of Millennia

I close my eyes
And see 13 Worldes
I seed
I birth
I force into the Void

Chains of Flesh and Change
Burning in Dead Fire
The Meat shall perish
At this feast, all starve
