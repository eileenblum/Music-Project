Numbing states of languish
Surging across aspectual abyss
Awaiting absorption
Disquieting vibrations

Importance lies
Coadunating towards
Subconscious navigation
Becomes

Murder confinement
As an obstacle of motion
Nature exalting
The equanimity of struggle

Subrogation
Gilded in guilt
Cast aside

All fetters melt away
Releasing the pulchritude
Of mastery
Obfuscated in the face
Of the moral

Blood flesh
Death earth

New life taken
Taking shape
