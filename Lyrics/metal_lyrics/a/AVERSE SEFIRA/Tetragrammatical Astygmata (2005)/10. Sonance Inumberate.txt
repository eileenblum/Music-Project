Spirit and fire
Now Caul and Costa
Subject to time's process
Where once we were not

Instruments of providence
Dulled, out of tune
Warped by the word

Behold!
Your heaven
Dripping with blood
The promise of a brighter sky
Now gone...

Dwelling in eternal grace
Locked in battle divine
Vestment skin woven to dust
Seeping blood once wine
Breathless beats of ragged wings
Usher us to mortal spoil
