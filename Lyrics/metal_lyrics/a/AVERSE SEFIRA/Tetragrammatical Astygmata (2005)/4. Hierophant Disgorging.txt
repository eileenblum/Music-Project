Tests of spirits
Tastes of blood
Bile rises to form vestments

Destruction
The inevitable
The ineffable
The result of distraction

One hand
Grasping a presentation
One hand
Shying from the flames

Qlipothic trembles
At the roar of the void
Appellations raised
As shields in search of glory
Wheeling suns
Propulsing ascendancy
Fylfot steps
Walk the sky
