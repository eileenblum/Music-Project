Conduits
Running above and below
Cyclic
Manipulations
Celestial and terrestrial
Intertwined

Hierarchy

A child's thirst
For one replacing many
Aspirations

Stamped into
The wax of the world
Sealing eyes and mouth

Rectitude

The chrysalis
Begins as a poem
The extrapolations
Are engineered
Abstractions
Overlapping
To veil truth

Quod Semper
Quod Ubique
Quod Ab Omnibus
