Dissect worlds
Lay bare for all to see

Invaginated consciousness
Bearing the germ

Venesected will
Pallid from dying symbol's let

Virulence transubstantiated
Passing from kith to kin

Hesitance of beyond death
Enshrines still too much terror
To take by hand
To behold with open eyes

Hide from nothing
Except
