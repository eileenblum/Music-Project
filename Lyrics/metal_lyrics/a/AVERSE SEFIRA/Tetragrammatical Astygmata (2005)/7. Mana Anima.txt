Causative emotions
Manifest in sleep
Somnambulist lucidity

Cognizant of the need
For the destruction
Of the vessel

Animus dominant
Consciousness sequestered
Vision and thought become
Transcendent existence
Animate through will alone

The magnification of struggle
In the struggle for magnification

Allocations for sorrow
Pale in the face of action
