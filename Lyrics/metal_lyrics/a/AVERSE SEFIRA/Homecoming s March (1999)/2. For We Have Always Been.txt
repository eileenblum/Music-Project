Wretchedly ancient, never to fade for we have always been
Beyond immortal, beyond all time for we have always been

So cold and long a path we tread A fiery sphere to light our way
Of human suffering we hone our art So hard and cruel do we remain

Silently we thrive on blood and grief
The desperate cries that go unheard
This mania is ageless Its legacy bled
Remained unseen before their eyes

and once upon a time you thought the world
was safe so tender and ideal yet poisoned at its soul

and so we now descend to Eden's pale remains
finally reduced to a violent speck of dust

Wretchedly ancient
Never to fade
Beyond immortal
Beyond all time

For we have always been
