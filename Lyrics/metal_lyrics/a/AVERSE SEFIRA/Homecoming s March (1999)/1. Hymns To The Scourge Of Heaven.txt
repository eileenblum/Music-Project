Older than the fall, we emerge from the left hand ballast'd against our opposing ten we are united in purpose
Warring in heaven we've come to earth in preparation for our razing of elysium
Perversions of Wisdom we turn battles' tide Pyrrhic to Victory crushing Dominion
Ungiven to Mercy we weaken Strength's pride fading Beauty's allure in our sight
Breakers of Foundation bringing ruin to Crown withering Splendor Incomprehensible
From beyond the aeons before the mythos we were there thralls to no sovereign
Birthed by will we flew the cosmos we have always been we shall always be
On tattered wings we fly on tattered wings we fly
This hell we make is our kingdom and we shall have it here
