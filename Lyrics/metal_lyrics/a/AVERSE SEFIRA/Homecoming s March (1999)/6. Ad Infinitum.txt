So very weary we stand on the edge of the world and frown â Do we halt?
Or press on?
What choice do we have?

The nectar of life has grown sour
Yet still we are forced to exist
In these shells for all time
We'll never be free!

This immortality is grief
Our armour stained with the blood of one thousand years before
Deprived of your eternal rest
Our wings hang lower as this burden takes its toll

Shrouded in shadow we move across dimensions unseen
Crying out as we fly
Our voices unheard

Waning, yet undying we long for a suitable end and yet,
we are cast in our roles Infinity calls...

Bound to walk amidst His Chosen Destitute in this existence empty...
Unwhole
Cast without souls
So sickeningly
Divine

So very weary this immortality is grief waning, yet undying Infinity calls
