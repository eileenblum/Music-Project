Alone in my sepulchral,
Mountain fortress tower
I have scurried away from the elysian fields

I sit awaiting the death of time I am so weary
Realization sets into my bones
Decaying the marrow

Limbs creaking I pull the cobwebs tighter about me
Ashes and soot drift to the floor
The world has become so cold and dusty

Gates of pearl, yellowed and cracked
Clouds of silver have tarnished
Seraphic wings
Have been fettered and rent

The ascended wander lost
Among the ruins of paradise
Gone to squalor In my absence

They cry out for my return
But I don't want to listen
Yet their pleas still fill my head
Leave me alone!
