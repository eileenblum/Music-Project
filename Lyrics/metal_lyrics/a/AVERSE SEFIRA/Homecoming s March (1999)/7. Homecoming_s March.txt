Returned to your heaven upon our tattered wings
to see of what's become the place that once was home

Trodding upon the splintered gates striding through the soulless guff
elysian fields lay fallow, have we returned for this?

For desolation striven
Have the masses toiled
And so where have you gone?
And so where have you gone?

Vainglory's light has blinded thee thinking you the one, true god.
but forget not who carved thy thrones and who shall pull them down

Crowned by the hand of man believing of what they're told:
that you weren't here for them but they were here for you

And so is your folly revealed!
To be loved above all else!
Blinding with false light's truth!
Masking Jealousy's motivations!

We're not here for them, they are here for us...

They're not here for us, we are here for them...
