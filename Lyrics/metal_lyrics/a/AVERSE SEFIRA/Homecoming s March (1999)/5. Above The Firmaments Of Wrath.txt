Amidst a once great empire a looming shadow falls
Darkens its once golden streets obscures its crumbling walls
The shadow's name is destiny it bears a fiery wrath
It seeks to raze the sinners and burn all in its path

Lead us into temptation

We fear and fight and fornicate and profit through deceit
Ebbing closer to our fate and ushering defeat
But now behold the sunless sky and hear our screams beneath
Bodies cast in hardened ash and souls that find no peace

Lead us into temptation

Hands reach for the sky
Begging for salvation
Asking their god why
Burned in congregation

Hands stretch towards the light
Meeting with aggression
Cleansed and cauterized
Punished for transgression

So the prophecy shall pass when nothing mortal stands
Cataclysm's come at last and the mad god forsakes the land
Finally this world shall be a dead and empty shell
Free of human levity a cold, barren, blasted hell

Decline and Fall, ashes will be our fate
