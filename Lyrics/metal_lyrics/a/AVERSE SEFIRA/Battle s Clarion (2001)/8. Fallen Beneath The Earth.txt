Open heart, sacrament
You are lost to me
And it is of my making
Paradise had, though corrupt
Destroyed through my will

Longed for you
Tremulous, hectored
Loving me, hating you
Yet still enthralled
Trembling in fury
Yours and mine

I must make my own way

Equal... to you
Unrivaled... by others
Cannonized... by desire
Sent here... perdition
Conterminous... purgation
Uncoupled... from union

Cast out, released, consigned

My vallation, incunabulum

Fallen beneath the earth
