For every battle fought and won
Someone must tell the tale
Lest we forget our warrior's vow
And leave our arms at rest

The countless times
We've raised our voices
Threatening to crack the sky
Now once again
They'll hear our turmoil
And brace their shields in fear

Abysmal voices herald our fury
The hiss of swords
Drawn forth in rage
This piercing hymnal
Is growing louder
Vibrating names of those reviled

Deafening verses steel our cause
A wicked crescendo signaling war
In final chorus we ascend
To craft a song anew

They'll wilt before us
Too late they hear the cry
Restrained
Within their fear
Made deaf and then destroyed

A song of ancient terror
Deathymn
