Ring wretched bells
Choiring the fall

Adversary named
Mantle proudly worn
I stand against

As above, so below

There is a part of you in me
There is a part of me
That must be in you
Resist though you may
If indeed you do...

Wide is the way
Twelve are my wings

Libertae tute mae ex deus!

Now I'm free!
