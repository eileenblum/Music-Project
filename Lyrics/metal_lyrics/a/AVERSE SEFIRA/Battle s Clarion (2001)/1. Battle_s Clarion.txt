Consanguineous
Unsure as we are
On where you stand
We cast upon you
The light of question

Though you walked our ranks
For all times recounted
We see that perhaps
It was not always so

Memories etched in stone
Unyielding
Wielding
Whim and remembrance
As engines of war

Delator
Mercurial you are
To turn about
When in darkness past
You came to us
For aid

It matters not
Coveted sanctimony
Shall not aegis you
Seduced to indulge in fancy

It is you who must prepare
And are not prepared

The lines have been drawn
The clarion call has sounded
To battle!

Phantom transgressions
We shoulder upon you
No forgiveness
Counterfeit sins

Paranoia unfounded
You take arms against us
Velitation
You cannot win
