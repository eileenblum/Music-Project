[A Scholar Of Time]

[I. Save me II. Hold me]

Wake me Love me
Help or Hurt me
Let me Teach me
Freezeâ¦ Please!

'Correct your mind and
Your life will fall into place'

Swimming in sorrow
Gets you nowhere
The past is never
What we wanted

Time and time again
And after your great tribulations
Fled from life again
But future was yet to be known

"When I let go of what I am
I become what I might be"

Rivers of olden
Get you nowhere
The past is never
What we wanted

Time and time again
And after your great tribulations
Fled from life again
But future was yet to be known

Hold me
Love me
Hurt me
Teach me

Hold me
Love me
Hurt me
Teach me

Hold me
Love me
Hurt me
Teach me
