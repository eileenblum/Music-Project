[The Prison, The Hurt]

Was a time I thought life is all fun n' games
â¦Guess is not
Now the time passes by and the nights and days
â¦Bleed my heart
In a prison inside in my mindâ¦ I
Tried so hard, played my part
I can't take it

Years went by and I spent borrowed time, living for borrowed dreams seemed fine oh it's not
Such a fool, so naive, my own eyes to deceive, who was I denied âbleeds my heart
Fixed n' numb, all this weight on my back; the struggle wearing poisoning smiles
Heard me not?
I can't take it!

[The Anger]

Why my ramparts crumble?
Why I hate the looking-glass?
Why I halt n' falter
While doing all I thought I must?

Thought I had it figured
Thought I knew it all for sure
Thought I've mend the glitches
I think it's time to let it go

[Solution? Salvation?]

Challenge myself to live my
Life as I truly want
Rise and set aims high and
"For, ever so far round"

Searching
Seeking
A road to
Somewhere

Searching
Seeking
A route to
Elsewhere

[2nd time]

Challenge yourself to live your
Life as you truly want
Rise, overcome your fears
Aim, "ever so far round"

Searching
Seeking
A road to
Somewhere

Searching

A route to
Elsewhere
