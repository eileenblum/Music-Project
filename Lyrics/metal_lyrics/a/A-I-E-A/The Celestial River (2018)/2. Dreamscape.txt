["Hope is a waking dream."
âAristotle]

I know
I know the dream is real
'Cause it surrounds me
Connects my soul to all
But tell me
If the pain is real
'Cause it devours me
N' constantly I fall

Aether bear my soul
For a thousand years, I
Roam for
Hope is a waking dream, so
Forward and beyond
I go

I know
Although the dream feels real
Should rouse myself, but
Helps to ease my soul
Part real
But consciousness declares
I must awake, now
Or forever be alone

Aether bear my soul
For a thousand years, I
Roam for
Hope is a waking dream, so
Forward and beyond
I go

Run
Run into the deep
Your soul was fast asleep
Kept into a dream
'scape
Dive into the deep
Put your mind to sleep
Let your heart to run
