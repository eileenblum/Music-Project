Look, how the leaves dance
Down the street
Wind, in your hair
Gives me chills

Watch, how the waves hit the sand
Like memories
Sun, on your hair and your feet
Salt on your lips

How we try
All the time
Wipe away
Dissonance
Justify
And align
Emotions n'
Facts

Run, run
You trust none
Past is
A foreign land âso you
Run, run
You fear none
Heart is
A memoir âso you

Trace, back a feeling
Walk with it
Learn, let it go
Frolic free

When I was young how I roamed
Frivolously
Mull, all the times that have shaped
All that I came to be

How we try
All the time
Wipe away
Dissonance
Justify
And align
Emotions n'
Facts

Run, run
You trust none
Past is
A foreign land âso you
Run, run
You fear none
Heart is
A memoir âso you

Run
Run
Run
Run
Run

Run, run
You trust none
Past is
A foreign land âso you
Run, run
You fear none
Heart is
A memoir âso you

Run, run
You trust none
Past is
A foreign land âso you
Run, run
You fear none
Heart is
A memoir âso you

Run, run
You trust none
Past is
A foreign land âso you
Run, run
You fear none
Heart is
A memoir âso you
