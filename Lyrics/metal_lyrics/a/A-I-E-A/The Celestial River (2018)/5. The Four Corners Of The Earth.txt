I will find the reasons
And I will find the rue
Search throughout the seasons
I will search for you

Faith in me
Let yourself go
This is real
Close your eyes and feel
Take my hand
Go beyond hope
Don't look back
"It's always darkest just before the day dawneth"

When all hope seems lost
And out of reach
I close my eyes to find you
When the world feels torn
And all seems wrong
I close my eyes to find you

I will climb the mountains
And swim across the sea
Search the constellations
Oh I will search for thee

Faith in me
Let yourself go
This is real
Close your eyes and feel
Take my hand
Go beyond hope
Don't look back
"It's always darkest just before the day dawneth"

When all hope seems lost
And out of reach
I close my eyes to find you
When the world feels torn
And all seems wrong
I close my eyes to find you

For you I'll walk through fire and flames and turn the world around until I find you
For you I'll walk a thousand days to the four corners of the earth
For you I'll walk through fire and flames and change the world in me until I find you
For you I'll walk and follow rivers to the four corners of this world
For you Iâ¦
