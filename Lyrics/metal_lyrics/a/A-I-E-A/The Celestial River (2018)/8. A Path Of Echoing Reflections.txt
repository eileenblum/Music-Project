Tame your thoughts
Don't let them
Yell, dictate
What's true for aye

Stands
Still
Pure
Whole
Firm
Plain
Hale
And shines

Misguided you confuse
A photo print for its Ã¦thereal prototype
It's like a mind abuse
You see an imprint and value it as life

Lost and weary
Well known scenery
Chasing shadows
Whistling arrows

You're my core
My silver cord
Feel so lost
In this world
Without you

I lived my life in the wrong direction, and
Was always bold to raise my voice and give advice
Spoke out loud to find my way through echoing reflections
Advice; is nothing but a rolling dice

The path is yours
To walk alone
I just speak
To find my own
Past is past
Words are strong
I should just
Love you more
