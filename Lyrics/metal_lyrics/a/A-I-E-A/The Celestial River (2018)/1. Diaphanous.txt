I try, try to speak
Words come out but
All
â¦Act so as if
I've never spoken

It was hard to see
That the one I should blame
No one else but me was
I'm the one that should change

Hear me now, just hear me now
Hear me, just hear me!

Years have passed
Like rivers underneath
Time at last
To finally set them free

Tried, tried to see
What was my fault
N' all
...Act so as I
Never was present

Wasn't hard to see
As accept n' distill
If I can't hear my voice
There is no one that will

Hear me now, just hear me now
Hear me, just hear me!

Years have passed
Like rivers underneath
Time at last
To finally drill them free
