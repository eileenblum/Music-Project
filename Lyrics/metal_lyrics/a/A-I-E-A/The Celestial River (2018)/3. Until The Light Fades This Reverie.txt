Fly with silver wings
Take the heavens
Indulge yourself and laugh at risks
Live for ever

Fly with silver wings
Take the Sky
Indulge yourself and learn to live
Do or die

[Part 3]

Ask, and receive
The answers, all await for

You must be, strong and pure and then you
Have to be, brave and true and then you
Ought to be, wise and prude and then you
Be your self, your true self

[Part 4]

I will always honor my ancestors
I will always impress my gods
I will always respect nature
I will always speak my mind
I will always fight for justice
I will always defend myself
I will always stand my ground
I will never be ashamed
I will never stray from honor
I will never break an oath
I will never be what you want
I will never be ashamed!

[Part 5]

I see you in a dream
I see you smiling back at me
Stay with me to this shore
Until the light comes bright back at me

I see you in a dream
I see you smiling back at me
Stay with me to this shore
Until the light shines straight from within

I see you in a dream
I see you smiling back at me
Stay with me to this shore
Until the light fades this reverie
