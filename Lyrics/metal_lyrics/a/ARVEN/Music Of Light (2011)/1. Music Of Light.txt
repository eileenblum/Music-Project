Singing all night with the music of light
Dancing around, sun is finding it's way
This magical music takes hold of me
Now I feel so free in the wind

Singing with you
Here by the rainbow
Dancing around 
Whispering your name
Singing with you
I want to ask you
If you'd like with me to stay

Now that we're dancing in streaming light
In the old ballroom with you by my side
Between young maids and noble knights
It feels like inside a dream

The shining sunlight is warming my face
Looking to heaven, a gentle embrace
With you beside me I feel so alive
Lying in fresh summerfields

Singing with you
Here by the rainbow
Dancing around 
Whispering your name
Singing with you
I want to ask you
If you'd like with me to stay

Now that we're dancing around and around
Hypnotized by the colours and sounds
Stars are no longer out of reach
And I feel so free

Singing with you
Here by the rainbow
Dancing around 
Whispering your name
Singing with you
I want to ask you
If you'd like with me to stay
