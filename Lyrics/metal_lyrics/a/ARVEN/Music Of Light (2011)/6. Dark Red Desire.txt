I look into the darkened sky
I feel the wind moving
Deep in my veins I feel it all
It flies away
The darkness comes and captures me
He takes my breath away
Inside of me a demon wakes
I feel my strength

I got a feeling deep inside
I'm not alone in here
I hear his breath, he's all round
The time has come

You're close behind me
Touching my skin with your breath
I can feel your pale lips
Desirously searching my neck
Let us conquer the night
Following your burning lust
We reach the point
Of no return

My body feels enlightened warmth
Your resurrecting kiss
My blood is moving through your veins
Now I'm your bride

You're close behind me
Touching my skin with your breath
I can feel your pale lips
Desirously searching my neck
Let us conquer the night
Following your burning lust
We reach the point
Of no return

You're close behind me
Touching my skin with your breath
I can feel your pale lips
Desirously searching my neck
We have conquered the night
The world has now come an end
We've reached the point
Of no return
