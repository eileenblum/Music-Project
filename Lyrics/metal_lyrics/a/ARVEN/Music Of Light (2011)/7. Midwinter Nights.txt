The king's eldest son hasn't ever married
The king was raged and has decreed:
The lady who performs the task he has set
Shall become the prince's lawful wife

Go to the darkest cave
The dragon's sleeping there
I hope your heart is strong
Kill him with your mighty sword
Go to the darkest cave
The dragon's sleeping there
This takes you three days long
I wish you wisdom and faith

Two of the three have died in battle
They have fought with swords and greatest spears
But the last and youngest sang a tune so lovely
The dragon dropped off to enchanted sleep

Go to the darkest cave
The dragon's sleeping there
I hope your heart is strong
Kill him with your mighty sword
Go to the darkest cave
The dragon's sleeping there
This takes you three days long
I wish you wisdom and faith

A passion glory
Moonlight singing hope and joy
The prince has now married
A faithful heart Midwinter poetry
A passions glory
Dancing at the setting sun
The old dragon's dead now
And the king's son has found his one

The night has turned to a sunny morning
The gentle breeze is full of hope
But they can not see that after nightfall
The eyes of the dragon glow in the dark

Go to the darkest cave
The dragon's sleeping there
I hope your heart is strong
Kill him with your mighty sword
Go to the darkest cave
The dragon's sleeping there
This takes you three days long
I wish you wisdom and faith
