Deep in the forest lies
a castle ruined by time
It's stones lay there
as the centuries went by
If they could speak they 
would tell a traveller
Stories from long passed days 
of battles and of feasts

Among this walls there
once has been life
Babies were bought into
the world abd old men died

Characters from ancient past
Awake up in my fantasy
Mighty kings and noble knights
Come to life once more

From far away I hear a sound
it appears to me
That in a minute a hunt with
horses and hounds will ride back in

Characters from ancient past
Awake up in my fantasy
Mighty kings and noble knights
Come to life once more

Characters from ancient past
Awake up in my fantasy
Mighty kings and noble knights
Come to life once more

All this dreamy fantasy
Makes me fall asleep
And another day has passed
How the time flies
