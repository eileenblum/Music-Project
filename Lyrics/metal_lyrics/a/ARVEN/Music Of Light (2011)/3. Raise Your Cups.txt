Roll in the barrels and bring in the jugs
Quick, set the tables and ask in thebards
Tonight when the setting sun lights up the
mountain
The king is having a glorious feast

Brothers and  sisters raise your cups
High in the air
Fill them again and drink it up
Celebrate

Light up the torches and let's dance together
Raise your hands high up into the air
Tomorrow there will be a new beginning
But now we gonna drink one more beer

Brothers and  sisters raise your cups
High in the air
Fill them again and drink it up
Celebrate

Oh oh, oh oh....
