I'm so alone
I have lost all I ever wanted
Only his love I have kept in me
He's gone away and my heart turns so cold and empty
He left me alone to bleed

From far away I can hear voices in the darkness
I feel so sad and I dream of him
At even fall he met me on the bridge of waters
He held me tight and the time stood still

At this night-time I felt alive
I saw the moon rising, up in the sky
At this evening he came to me
And he said he loved me more than his life

There's no love that lasts forever
Without him my hearts is crying
There no life left inside her
Without him I'll die

There's no love that lasts forever
The coldness has come to take me
There no life left inside her
My heart turns to stone

There's no love that lasts forever
Without him my hearts is crying
There no life left inside her
Without him I'll die

At this night-time I felt alive
I saw the moon rising, up in the sky
At this evening he came to me
And he said he loved me more than his life

There's no love that lasts forever
Without him my hearts is crying
There no life left inside her
Without him I'll die

There's no love that lasts forever
The coldness has come to take me
There no life left inside her
My heart turns to stone

There's no love that lasts forever
Without him my hearts is crying
There no life left inside her
Without him I'll die

Now with the wind I just feel that my soul grows colder
I dream of him, darkness is my light
I sense that I'm dying and I'm lying on the
bridge of waters where we met
I feel his warmth here and my soul flies away
