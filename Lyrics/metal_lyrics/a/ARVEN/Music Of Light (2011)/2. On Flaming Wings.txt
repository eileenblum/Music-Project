Tell me, can you watch the sun
Can you stand it?
Oh tell me, can you watch the sun?
Come on it's fun

As we're riding on flaming wings
We fly towards the stars

Tell me, can you watch the sun
Can you stand it?
Oh tell me, can you watch the sun?
And take the first step?

For the path is a rocky one,
The journey will last

Tell me, can you watch the sun
Can you stand it?
Oh tell me, can you watch the sun?
And go to the end?

Sometimes I wish I could fly away
Leave everything behind and go my own way
Listen to the words of my longing heart
Follow the written path of my destiny
