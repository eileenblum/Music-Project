He left his home when he grew up
To reach the stars
He wandered around everywhere
To find the place of dreams

The light was pale
The moon was shining down on him
He walked alone through the night
Searching for more wisdom

What more could he say
He's hoping to find light of day
But deep inside him he knows
That sunlight is far more away

An owl was howling from a tree
The wind was cold
Fading away in the dark
Glimmering moon shadow

He was afraid inside
He didn't know the way
Shallow lake sang a song
He fell on his kness and prayed

What more could he say
He's hoping to find light of day
But deep inside him he knows
That sunlight is far more away

The day has died
And the night passed away
And now for him there's just nothing to say
And soon he'll find in the rain of the night
That every journey will come to an end

He was alone and sad
Beside a willow tree
Crying for sense in his life
He finally realized

In all his life he searched
For truth so far away
But the truth itself
Lay deep within his soul

What more could he say
Now he has found light of day
Still deep inside him he knew
It wasn't a journey away
