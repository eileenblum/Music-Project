When I look back I see your face
The smile in your eyes
The moments that we both shared come to
my mind
Those wonderful times

In my life you were the one
who loved me in spite of myself
It hurt to say a last goodbye
And watch you drift slowly away by my side

Let the sadness go away
Let the rain wipe away my tears
For forever my heart belongs to you
And I know you'll be always near

There's no one waiting at the door
It's empty inside
But every place tells me the story of
Your life by my side

While other friends came and went
You stayed by me, one true heart
I'll never find that peace again
You were there for me, you could understand

Let the sadness go away
Let the rain wipe away my tears
For forever my heart belongs to you
And I know you'll be always near

Let the sadness go away
After everything we've been through
You forever will stay inside my heart
I will always remember you

I can not fill the space you left
It won't be the same
No matter where I go and what I see
This silence remains

Forgive me if I did something wrong
Cause I've never meant to hurt you
So fast the years passed us by
There's never enough time to say goodbye

Let the sadness go away
Let the rain wipe away my tears
For forever my heart belongs to you
And I know you'll be always near

Let the sadness go away
After everything we've been through
You forever will stay inside my heart
I will always remember you

When I look back I see your face
The smile in your eyes
The moments that we both shared come to my mind
Those wonderful times

Forgive me if I did something wrong
Cause I've never meant to hurt you
So fast the years passed us by
There's never enough time to say goodbye
