In this world, so full of hatred
Broken bodies, broken souls
Wars are ranging for all times
Darkness creeps inside your heart

Look around you now
and tell me just what you see
people are living in darkness
look around you
their eyes aren't alive any more
you can reach no one's soul

Is this the end?
What's this for?
No one can hear
Screams behind the door

Fallen angel, oh hear my prayer
World has become, world has become hell
All alone now, let me die here
The enemy waits right behind you

Look around you now
and tell me just what you see
people are living in darkness
look around you
their eyes aren't alive any more
you can reach no one's soul

Is this the end?
What's this for?
No one can hear
Screams behind the door
