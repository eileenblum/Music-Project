I feel weak 
Broken by the one who 
Promised me to protect 
Me and hold me tight 
Until our last breath 

I'm freezing cold 
Left without your warmth I've 
Given you all my trust 
All I had to give 
Nothing left untouched 

Please put your strong arms around me 
Hear my desperate screams 
I need you now 
From the bottom of my heart 

Put your strong arms around me 
Hear my desperate screams 
I need you now 
From the bottom of my heart 

Time has passed 
Images have faded 
Like a trace in the sand 
But I realized 
Time can heal no wounds 

You're still here 
An empty space beside me 
Where you once used to be 
Where you held my hand 
As I learned to fly 

Please put your strong arms around me 
Hear my desperate screams 
I need you now 
From the bottom of my heart 

Put your strong arms around me 
Hear my desperate screams 
I need you now 
From the bottom of my heart 

With my last 
Strength I hold on 
To your hand, I must 
Can't let you go 
And I fall 
Deep down I fall... 

Please put your strong arms around me 
Hear my desperate screams 
I need you now 
From the bottom of my heart 

Put your strong arms around me 
Please don't leave me behind 
I need you now 
From the bottom of my heart
