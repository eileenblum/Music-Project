Another day, another night 
The world goes on, time goes by 
But for me the time has stopped, has stopped 
You're here by me, where you belong 
We laugh and kiss, our love is strong 
Another second, another minute of my dream 

Your friendly smile gives me that peaceful feeling 
Your gentle touch shows me how much you care 
Please hold me near, let me forget all the world around 
No one exists beside you and me right now 

You were the one I had to love 
With all my faith, all my heart 
I reached for you, you took my hand, my hand 
A special time, a special bond 
I found what I was looking for so long 
A place to see one another 
For who we really are 

Your friendly smile gives me that peaceful feeling 
Your gentle touch shows me how much you care 
Please hold me near, let me forget all the world around 
No one exists beside you and me right now 

Your friendly smile gives me that peaceful feeling 
Your gentle touch shows me how much you care 
I feel the warmth of your hand on my skin and it's all I got 
My memories of times that now have passed...
