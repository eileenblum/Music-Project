I, I close my eyes 
I see you there and think of former times 
You've gone too far, you broke my heart 
What have you done? 

I wanna hear you scream, I wanna know for sure 
Inside my darkest dream, I wanna hear you scream 
I wanna hear you scream, I wanna know for sure 
I want to be alone with you, alone with you 

How could you do this to me? 
Break the promise you made 
I believed every lie you told me 
You left and there's so much pain 

This, this is the time 
This is the day for seeing you again 
Pain everywhere, flowing through my veins 
Burning my soul 

I wanna hear you scream, I wanna know for sure 
Inside my darkest dream, I wanna hear you scream 
I wanna hear you scream, I wanna know for sure 
I want to be alone, alone with you 

How could you do this to me? 
Break the promise you made 
I believed every lie you told me 
You left and there's so much pain
