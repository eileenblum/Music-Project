The night falls upon our land 
Slowly, the sun is hiding 
Anticipation 
Fills up the air 

Head for the sacred place 
Gather around the fire 
Keep quiet and listen 
The stories begin 

Come, join our circle tonight 
Take a seat right here by our side 
Tales of magic, love and desire 
Told by the heat of the fire 

The elders begin to speak 
Voices so rich and deep 
They take us away 
Into other worlds 

Come, join our circle tonight 
Take a seat right here by our side 
Tales of magic, love and desire 
Told by the heat of the fire
