I've been looking for you all my life 
I've been waiting all this time to be found by you 
I've been walking the streets 
Looking into every stranger's eyes 
Waiting for a sign, for a tiny spark to touch 
This lonely heart of mine 

All my life I have searched for you 
You will light the night for me, like the moon 
Bring love and joy to my way 
Like the sun on a summer day 

I can see you when I close my eyes 
I know what it would be like to walk by your side 
People all around tell me I am being so naive 
Maybe they are right, but I feel I have to heed 
The voice inside my heart 

All my life I have searched for you 
You will light the night for me, like the moon 
Bring love and joy to my way 
Like the sun on a summer day 

One more day comes to close and I 
Still wait for you to arrive 
Have you lost your way 
Will I lose my faith in being with you someday 

Day after day I've been searching for 
Something to show me, who is the one for me 
You're a dream, you're my fantasy 
Light up the fire, lead me home, set me free 

All my life I have searched for you 
You will light the night for me, like the moon 
Bring love and joy to my way 
Like the sun on a summer day 

All my life I have searched for you 
You will light the night for me, like the moon 
Bring love and joy to my way 
Like the sun on a bright summer day
