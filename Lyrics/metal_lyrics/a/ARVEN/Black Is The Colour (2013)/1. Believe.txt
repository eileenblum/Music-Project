One day as a child you open your eyes 
And see the world ahead, open wide 
Ready to explore adventures of life 
You set out on the journey 

But one day you'll learn that not all dreams will come true 
Sometimes we must face grief and loss 
Blinded by fear, lost in the dark 
At some point you will need all the strength that you've got 

High above there is a star that shines bright for me 
Gives warmth and light 
And in times of need I know for sure 
There is someone who believes in me 

Totally excited you open your heart 
To make a former stranger your special one 
Magical connection, two hearts beat as one 
You're sure it lasts forever 

But one day you'll learn that not all dreams will come true 
Sometimes we must face grief and loss 
Blinded by fear, lost in the dark 
At some point you will need all the strength that you've got 

High above there is a star that shines bright for me 
Gives warmth and light 
And in times of need I know for sure 
There is someone who believes in me 

Certainly not all dreams will come true 
Sometimes we must face grief and loss 
Blinded by fear, lost in the dark 
At some point you will need all strength that you've got 

High above there is a star that shines bright for me 
Gives warmth and light 
And in times of need I know for sure 
There is someone who believes... 

High above there is a star that shines bright for me 
Gives warmth and light 
And in times of need I know for sure 
There is someone who believes in me
