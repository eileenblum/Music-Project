Every time I close my eyes 
I see your face, your broken smile 
And all of my memories come back to life 

Suddenly my life was changed 
And overnight 
The world has turned to something strange 
The leaves have fallen from the tree of my life 

Don't look back, please go on 
Though it's hard to leave behind your shattered dreams 
They seemed so real 
Time will heal the pain oh please believe 

Nowadays the fog grows deep 
It keeps away the sunlight from my aching skin 
All warmth and colours disappeared 

What has been 
Is etched upon my memory 
Is cut into my open chest 
I know I'll never be the same once again 

Don't look back, please go on 
Though it's hard to leave behind your shattered dreams 
They seemed so real 
Time will heal the pain oh please believe 

Has all the best passed, or is it yet to come? 
Will a new love last or will it come undone? 
What am I here for, which road is mine to take? 
A new dawn, a start and an empty page
