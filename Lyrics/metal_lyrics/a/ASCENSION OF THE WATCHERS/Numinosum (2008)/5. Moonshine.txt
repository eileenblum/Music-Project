I gaze on the moon as she shines on me,
So bright in my eyes, a heart so clear and blinding,
Shining on my face paled by my disgrace.
Like a star, from heaven you burned and fell,
Mesmerized, I glowed underneath your spell

Her shadows, they seem to whisper to me devotions that echo the seas,
My shadows, they seem, to reveal in me my oceans of lies and deceit,
Shining on my face paled by my disgrace eclipsing, she has fallen
And time has dimmed and darkened the moon no longer shines for me
