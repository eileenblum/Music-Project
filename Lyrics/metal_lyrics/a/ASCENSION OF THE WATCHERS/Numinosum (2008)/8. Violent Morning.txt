Violet Morning full of grace a new dawning on my face
A flower blooming every day you pierced my soul and touched my faith
You are the light for my love you are the love for my God

Violet Morning I feel you shine enlightening my space and time
In your warmth my heart did find a pure soul, a love divine
The only light in my eyes the only love of my life

You are the light for my love you are the love for my God
The only light in my eyes the only love of my life
You are my morning sun you are the light where I begun
