There is nothing left of me there is nothing that you see,
All I am is memory and that is all you will be.
Nothing ever lasts forever.

Everything that I have won all the hearts I have shunned,
Like a ghost I leave you stunned alone in bed, wretched, feeling numb.
Nothing ever lasts forever.

Looking at me with mourning eyes I know your pain as you cry,
My thirst for love, my need to fly my freedom, my souls desire.
Nothing ever lasts forever.
