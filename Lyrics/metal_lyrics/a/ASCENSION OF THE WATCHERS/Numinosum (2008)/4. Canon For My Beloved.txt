You were the first to believe you were the one, you helped me see
You raised me up and out from my grief you took my hand and set my soul free
I broke your heart, released your tears now I can feel you floating away from me

Your loneliness, a beckon call distance and days that let love fall
Time hangs above your heart all the betrayal that tears us apart
I never meant to hurt my love this way I never meant for my heart to stray
I broke your heart, released your tears now I can feel you floating away from me

I love you I do I feel you floating away love that has fallen away
Sadness takes you now disheartened and disavowed
I broke your heart, released your tears
Now I can feel you floating away from me
