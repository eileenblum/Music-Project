Dreams are like razors I hold in my hand memories bleeding I don't understand
Blood stained prayers are left unanswered fading echoes that no one has heard

Every word I have ever written falls like rain from the dark heavens
I lost all control of my heart and soul now every praise is for whom I toll

These mortal moments will be lost in time like every tear I shed from my eyes
Like fallen angels who dream of ascent my every regret becomes a lament
