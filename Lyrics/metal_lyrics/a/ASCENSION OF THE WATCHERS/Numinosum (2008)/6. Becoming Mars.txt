The anger swells like rising tides like two lost souls that soon collide
Tonight I witness all the angels throw all of their stones down on me
The constant thorn that's in my flesh was solely placed and laid to rest
All that I am is all that you made so you blaspheme me in your holy place
Ever so slowly the stranger becomes me ever so slowly I surrender blindly
Why am I forsaken my heart was forsaken

This broken man was fuelled by rage through endless time he suffered pain
As all the stars light up the sky my love remains dark in my eye
I felt the war, I fought alone I sought mercy within your home
I was turned away, petition denied I had no friends for this heart to confide
Ever so slowly the stranger becomes me ever so slowly I surrender blindly
Why am I forsaken my heart was forsaken
