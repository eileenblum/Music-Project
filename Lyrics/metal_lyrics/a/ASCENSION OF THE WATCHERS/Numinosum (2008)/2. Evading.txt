Are my dreams a sign are my dreams just you in disguise?
Will this heart find will this heart be denied?
Endlessly I still search endlessly, forever onward?
Are my prayers heard are my prayers meaningless words?
My God hear my prayer

This young heart is scared scared by a fate that we share.
Visions of you unclear existence of you I should fear.
Are my prayers heard are my prayers empty words?
My God hear my prayer My Lord can't you hear me?
