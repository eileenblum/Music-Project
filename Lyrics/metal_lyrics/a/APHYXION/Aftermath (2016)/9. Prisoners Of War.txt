It's time to question their reasons, 
Is it really worth dying for oil? 
A war build on secrets
These plans were meant to recoil

One step closer to the edge
Afraid to speak your mind?
I hope you doubt your pledge
When using guns to hide behind

This war can't be right
Pray the sun will never rise

To all the prisoners of war
There are facts you can never ignore
Question the reasons, I implore 
'Cause we're all prisoners of war

You realize your hands are tied
Awakening all your fears
Even though you win the war
You'll lose so much more
So ask yourself what this is for
Did you destroy or restore?
This war can't be right
Pray the sun will never rise
To all the prisoners of war
There are facts you can never ignore
Question the reasons, I implore 
'Cause we're all prisoners of war

The nights were never silent
The air filled with screams of despair
My mind embroiled in violence
I can never be repaired [2x]

To all the prisoners of war
There are facts you can never ignore
Question the reasons, I implore 
'Cause we're all prisoners of war
To all the prisoners of war
There are facts you can't ignore
Question the reasons, I implore 
'Cause we're all prisoners of war
