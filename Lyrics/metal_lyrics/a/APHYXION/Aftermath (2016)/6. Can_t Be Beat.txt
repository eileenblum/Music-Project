Straight from the depths of my heart
This is where I belong 
Our union stands strong

You can say what you want
This is the place I call home
The one thing you may never take from me

Forever forced to normality
Taking away what matters to me 
I seek refuge in brutality
This union can't be beat

Can't be beat

And we are loyal down to the bone, 
Never shall one be left alone,
You know where you belong
Our union stands strong

Forever forced to normality
Taking away what matters to me 
I seek refuge in brutality
This union can't be beat

We are the final resistance 
Driven by hate
And we base our existence
In this unity
Straight from the depths of my heart
This is where I belong 
Loyal down to the bone
Never shall one be left alone
Our union stands strong
Stands strong

Forever forced to normality
Taking away what matters to me 
I seek refuge in brutality
This union can't be beat

Can't be beatâ¦ this union can't be beat
