Your endless consumption
Comes with a price
You are left with no other options
Than living a synthetic life

We count dollars, we count dollars, when we should count seconds [2x]

We dwell in madness
Synthetically stimulated
Swallowed in blackness
By plastic manipulated
Consumer consumed

This insane obsession
Must come to an end
Mental regression
Forever condemned	

We count dollars, when we should count seconds

We dwell in madness
Synthetically stimulated
Swallowed in blackness
By plastic manipulated
Consumer consumed

Corporate cannibalism
Victorious capitalism
The creation of needs

We dwell in madness
Synthetically stimulated
Swallowed in blackness
By plastic manipulated

We dwell in madness (synthetically stimulated)
Swallowed in blackness (by plastic manipulated)
Consumer consumed
