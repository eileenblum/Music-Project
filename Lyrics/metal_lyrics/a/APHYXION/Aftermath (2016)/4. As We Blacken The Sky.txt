As the forest burns away, as the planet's turning grey, 
As we keep on giving birth, to children condemned to a world in pain
Everyone dies in vein
We will forever stay the same

You've lived your life with your hands painted red
Take a fucking stand you pitiful prick
So many years of misconduct and neglect
As we blacken the sky
As we blacken the sky

As the smog in the air blackens the sky
As our lives goes on, based on a lie
As we count our final hours, only with ourselves to blame
I am left with shame
We will forever stay the same

You've lived your life with your hands painted red
Take a fucking stand you pitiful prick
So many years of misconduct and neglect
As we blacken the sky 
As we blacken the sky

The forest burns away 
The planet's turning grey
Radiation everywhere
Chemical waste 

You've lived your life with your hands painted red
Take a fucking stand you pitiful prick
So many years of misconduct and neglect
As we blacken the sky 
As we blacken the sky
