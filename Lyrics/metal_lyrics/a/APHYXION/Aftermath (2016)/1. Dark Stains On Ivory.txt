We starve the Earth, we empty it whole
We have non-regrettingly sold our soul
To a bigger TV and an empty front lawn
All well knowing our future is gone

The sun burns up, the sky turns black
You're suddenly aware there's no going back
Retreat to your homes, your TVs and lawns,
Wait for the eclipse, when retribution will hit

Dark stains on ivory
Stains that never goes away
This is our heredity
We were never meant to stay

Dark stains on ivory,
Stains that never goes away
A world in decay
This place, our home, forever in pain

With order restored, we shall try again, 
This time with patience, love and respect
For the creatures around us, the planet, our home
As soon as we learn to step down from the throne

And we must keep on this track, not fall back
Or once again the sky will turn black
Mother Earth will swallow you whole, 
You pathetic creature, who sold his soul

Dark stains on ivory
Stains that never goes away
This is our heredity
We were never meant to stay

Dark stains on ivory,
Stains that never goes away
A world in decay
This place, our home, forever in pain

We starve the earth, we empty it whole
All well knowing our future is gone
When do we learn to step down from the throne?
Wait for the eclipse (wait for the eclipse) when retribution will hit. 
Dark stains on ivory
Stains that never goes away
This is our heredity
We were never meant to stay

Dark stains on ivory,
Stains that never goes away
A world in decay
This place, our home, forever in pain
