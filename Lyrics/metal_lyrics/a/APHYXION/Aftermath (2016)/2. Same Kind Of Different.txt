So get this fucking straight 
We are in this together, never alone 
You are flesh I am bone 
We were left for nothing and pushed aside 
Beaten, picked on and left to die 
Let the hate consume you 
Together we rot 
In this pit of salvation 
This unprejudiced spot 

I will mark you my path, so step in my tracks, 
Now that I can truly see 
We are the same kind of different, you and me 
We share the suffering 
We keep on wondering 
Now that I can truly see 
We are the same kind of different, you and me

Honed for perfection 
Subject to aggression 
Being used as tools for control 
But we were meant for another role (for another role) 
Let the hate consume you 
Together we rot 
In this unprejudiced spot 

I will mark you my path, so step in my tracks, 
Now that I can truly see 
We are the same kind of different, you and me 
We share the suffering 
We keep on wondering 
Now that I can truly see 
We are the same kind of different, you and me 

We've been left for nothing 
Pushed aside 
Beaten, picked on and left to die 
Reach out for my hand, I will lead you the way 
To a sanctuary place, within your hate and your pain...

I will mark you my path, so step in my tracks, 
Now that I can truly see 
We are the same kind of different, you and me 
We share the suffering 
We keep on wondering 
Now that I can truly see, 
We are the same kind of different, you and me 

I'll mark you my path 
So step in my tracks 
Now that I can truly see 
We're the same kind of different you and me 
We share the suffering 
We keep on wondering 
Now that I can truly see 
We're the same kind of different you and me
