For too long have we reached for the sky
We can never we be satisfied
Profit comes first, only quenching our thirst
We will never have enough

More needs more and an eye for an eye
What a pitiful world, built on a lie

We were destined to fail
Although we were given the tools to prevail
Our greed and our lust was unveiled
Destined to fail
Waiting for the day when I stop to care,
Forever trapped in this nightmare
Consumed by the need to always exceed
The limits of this world, the limits of our earth

More needs more and an eye for an eye
What a pitiful world, built on a lie

We were destined to fail
Although we were given the tools to prevail
Our greed and our lust was unveiled
Destined to fail

Waiting for the day when I stop to care,
Forever trapped in this nightmare
More needs more, an eye for an eye
A pitiful world, built on a lie

We were destined to fail
Although we were given the tools to prevail
Our greed and our lust was unveiled
Destined to fail
We were destined to fail
Although we were given the tools to prevail
Our greed and our lust was unveiled
Destined to fail
