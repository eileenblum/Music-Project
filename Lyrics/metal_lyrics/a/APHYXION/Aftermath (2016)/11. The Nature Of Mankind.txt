The chemical nightmare, arisen to haunt you
Poisonous fumes creeping under the door
I'm gonna put on my shades, watch you bathe in hate
Serve your own fucking head on a silver plate

This is the nature of mankind â so blind
So determined to be left behind
When we torch the sky, the planet dies
Oh, so blind â the nature of mankind

You've poisoned the air, laid the forest bare
Vengeance is next, I solemnly swear 
I'm gonna put on my shades, watch you bathe in hate
Serve your own fucking head on a silver plate

This is the nature of mankind â so blind
So determined to be left behind
When we torch the sky, the planet dies
Oh, so blind â the nature of mankind

Your never ending appetite to capitalize
Is the root of the problem, the disease that must die

This is the nature of mankind 
So determined to be left behind
When we torch the sky, the planet dies
Oh, so blind â the nature of mankind
This is the nature of mankind â so blind
So determined to be left behind
When we torch the sky, the planet dies
Oh, so blind â the nature of mankind
