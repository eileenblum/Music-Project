Now take a look deep into my eyes, 
Hear my words â you're a slave to the lies
I see your addiction to society's rules
Hear my words â you're a blind fucking fool

Prepare for the upcoming riot
Hear my words â your life has expired
I see your addiction to society's rules
Hear my words â you're a blind fucking fool

There are lines to be crossed, you will pay the cost
We'll always fight for our cause

We'll be a part of the solution
Where others fail â we'll succeed
Reaching for absolution

Burn your self-pity, 
Burn the self-absorbed masses of slaves
I just can't relax, while you walk in the tracks
Of former generations mistakes and mishaps

There are lines to be crossed, you will pay the cost
We'll always fight for our cause

We'll be a part of the solution
Where others fail â we'll succeed
Reaching for absolution

There are lines to be crossed 
Get a grip on your shit 
You'll pay the costs
Don't you fucking quit
We will fight for our cause
Ready to commit? 
Not everything is lost
Rebuild it brick by brick
We'll be a part of the solution
Where others fail â we'll succeed
Reaching for absolution
Get ready for the revolution
Where others fail â we'll succeed
We're ready for retribution
