Your pretty lies, your suit and your tie, 
Your absence of empathy sickens me
Your double standards and counterfeit smile
Your existence â our demise

Who is really to blame? 
The blindfolded sheep who keeps voting the same,
We drown in blindness!
Nothing will change, we stay the same

Are you sorry when the lights begin to fade? 
Are you sorry for the promises you made? 
Some day you'll be ordered to explain
Some day you'll be placed with the blame
You promised us change
Gave us nothing again (When the lights begin to fade) 
Some day you'll understand our pain
Some day you'll lose the game
You promised us change
Gave us nothing again
When the lights begin to fade

Not all hope is lost, fight for the cause
Gather your strength and spit in their face
We will stand together as one
Fight for our beliefs, against the human disease
We lie awake at night
Waiting for change
But now I realize
It's all the same again

Are you sorry, when the lights begin to fade?
Are you sorry for the promises you made? 
Some day you'll be ordered to explain
Some day you'll be placed with the blame
You promised us change
Gave us nothing again (When the lights begin to fade) 
Some day you'll understand our pain
Some day you'll lose the game
You promised us change
Gave us nothing again
When the lights begin to fade

And as I break your jaw, and as I split your spine 
I remember the past, what you have done to mine, 
And as I hear you screams, I see it in your eyes
I recall everything that is done by your liesâ¦

Some day you'll be ordered to explain
Some day you'll be placed with the blame
You promised us change
Gave us nothing again (when the lights begin to fade) 
Some day you'll understand our pain
Some day you'll lose the game
You promised change
Gave nothing again
When the lights begin to fade [2x]
