Now that your hollowness is clearer than ever, 
Now that our eyes are finally open
Fed us with panic and despair, as long as you dared,
But now we're waking up to take affair

Now that your emptiness is clearer than ever
Your wheel of life is falling apart
Humanity, never meant to be
But now we're waking up to take affair

Your rules do not apply
I am liberty
And don't you even try 
To force it down on me
Suppressed by the system for way too long
Why fit in, why fit in, why fit in when you were born to stand strong? 

Now that your pretty lies are clearer than ever
Now we're finally ready to fight
Led us to darkness and death, take your final breath, 
'Cause now we're waking up to take affair

Now that my warnings are finally heard
Now that your life has come to an end,
Humanity, wasn't meant to be
But now we're awake â we'll take affair!

Your rules do not apply, 
I am liberty
And don't you even try 
To force it down on me
Suppressed by the system for way too long
Why fit in, why fit in, why fit in when you were born to stand strong?

Inhale the fumes, your eyes are getting heavy now
First delusions, now paranoia
I'll cut off your eyelids for you to see
What I'm about to do to thee 
Stay awake â this is far from over
Vengeance â and finally peace
Your rules do not apply, 
I am liberty
And don't you even try 
To force it down on me
Suppressed by the system for way too long
Why fit in, why fit in, why fit in when you were born to stand strong?
