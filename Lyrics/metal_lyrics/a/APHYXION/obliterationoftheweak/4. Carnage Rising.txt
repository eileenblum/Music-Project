I create sick illusions
I twist your mind
Mess with your head
You beg me to stop
Iâve fucking had enough

Madness fills your mind
So much fear in your eyes
I want you to feel the pain
The agony,
Deep inside [x2]

Ripping off your skin
Revealing your flesh
Exposing your guts

Salt your wound
Cry my name
Salt your wound
Cry my name, my name, my name

Madness fills your mind
So much fear in your eyes
I want you to feel the pain

Your tearfilled eyes
Means nothing to me
Draining your mind
Make you feel the agony
