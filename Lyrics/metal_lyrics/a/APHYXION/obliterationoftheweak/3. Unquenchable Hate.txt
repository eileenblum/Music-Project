You walk away,
Filled up with shame
I have abused you
In any possible way
First despair
Filled up my mind
Then I got blind,
Rage blurred my sight

Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
Hate storing up
Soon to be released
Inside of me

Tell me, tell me what you see [x2]

An unquenchable flame
Building up, inside of me
Unleashing the hate,
Condemned
For all eternity

No regrets for what Iâve done
You started what I now have stopped
No regrets!

Look into my eyes
Tell me what you see
Hate storing up
Inside of me [x2]
