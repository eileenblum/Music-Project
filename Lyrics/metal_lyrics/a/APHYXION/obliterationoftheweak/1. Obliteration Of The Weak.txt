Inflamed eyes, festering wounds,
bestial instincts blushing up in my brain
My body is shaking, Iâm grinding my teeth,
Transformation complete
Suddenly bloodlust, what have I become
No more mercy, no more mercy to anyone!

Visions plaguing me, repressing them
The sky is turning red, going insane
Annihilate, mutilate, the cleansing has begun

Suddenly bloodlust, what have I become
No more mercy, no more mercy to anyone!

Feeling the pressure, boiling in my veins
Must cure this world, from its disease.
Annihilate, mutilate, obliterate the weak.
Burn it down, down to the ground
Burn them down, let their rotten flesh smell, make them all know, weâll give âem hell
A new era, soon to come
A new era, of the strong
