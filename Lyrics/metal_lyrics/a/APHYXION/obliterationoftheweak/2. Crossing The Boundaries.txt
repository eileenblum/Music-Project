Pushing you beyond your limits
Let me see what youâve got
Held your hands high
Reach for the forbidden
Breaking your limits
Shut off your feelings
Stand up for yourself
Donât give a shit what they say
Means nothing to me

Release your anger
Untie your ropes
Set free the beast in you

Stand up for yourself
Donât give a shit what they say
Fuck your past
Believe in nothing, but yourself
Exposed and broken?
I donât give a shit

A lifetime of weakness, has lead you to me
No more mistakes, no more reason to run away

Stand up for yourself
Donât give a shit what they say
Fuck your past
The future is in your fucking hands

Now take the last step, you just crossed the line
No more infirmity, you are sickening me
Sickening me...
