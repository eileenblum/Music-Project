All I hear is your
hollow screams
I see you twisting
your body in pain

The darkness, is embedding your mind
The pain, growing inside
You will never, see the sun arise
Your life has met its end

The walls are closing in
Now you will pay
For a life in sin

I hear your screams for mercy
Want me to put you out of this misery?
Your life in pain has met its end

The darkness, embedding your mind
The pain, growing inside
You will never see the sun arise
Your life has met its end

The walls are closing in
Now you will pay
For a life in sin
