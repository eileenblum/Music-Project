Now I understand
This searing transparency burning my eyes, my eyes
We are the outcasts of society
Take a moment, feel the sobriety
In my voice
We are the born abominations
We cannot be loved
We cannot be killed
And we start to apprehend
How we strangled ourselves
Still we donât change our ways
Now weâre just counting the days
For our decimation
My eyes are burning 
Now that Iâm awake, I will never close my eyes again
Alas, I no longer fear death
I feel it
Slowly getting closer 
no more sleep
Insomnia taking over
I fear for the day, 
Where our voices fall silent, 
suppressed and controlled
overcome and contained
Afraid to wake up again
To this life in vain, I will never close my eyes again, again 
We are the born abominations
We cannot be loved
We cannot be killed 
We cannot be killed
Born abominations
And we start to apprehend
How we strangled ourselves
Still we donât change our ways
Now weâre just counting the days
For our decimation
