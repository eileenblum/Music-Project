Your life withering away
Who will remember your name
Keep on believing, oh keep on believing
That all this shit will make sense in the end 

You've got your job from nine to five, a little house, a pretty wife,
The tension building up inside
Let go of your senses,
Stand up

Fight
Believe

Just looking at your face, makes me vomit in disgrace

Is it really you, living your life
Or are you pulled by the strings of this fucked up mankind?

No one to turn to,
It's time to face yourself

(face yourself)

Your soul inflicted, with the disease of society
Reach out, take affair, release your inner hate
Just looking at your face, makes me vomit in disgrace

Is it really you, living your life
Or are you pulled by the strings of this fucked up mankind?
