Feeble is the man of our time
Dreaming to live, dying to hide

Blind belief in authority
(It must be stopped)
Is the greatest enemy

You god-fearing mortal!
What have we become? 
The choices made, 
For this world of shame
Must be undone
Soon our time is up
Our time is up

A world in pain
Divided by faith
Mother Earth in decline
By religion entwined 
Will this ever stop? 
Do you not feel corrupt?

Blind belief in authority 
(it must be stopped)
Is the greatest enemy

Biblical nonsense
Corrupting your brain
Leaving our world in pain
We are the ones to blame
