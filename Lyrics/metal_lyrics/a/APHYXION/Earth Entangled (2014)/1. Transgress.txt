Itâs time to wake up, to let go of your fears
Rise and shine, rise and shine
The human race is in decline
This is the bottom line, the end of time

Trying to make this a better place
Never again shall we feel this way
Make a move while youâre still breathing

Let go of yourself
This is no hallucination
Let go of yourself
Reach out for your temptations

Get the fuck up, make this life worth a while
Rise and shine, rise and shine
A chilling cold running down my spine,
Change will arrive, this is our time

Trying to make this a better place
Never again shall we feel this way
Make a move while youâre still breathing
Violate! Abuse and exceed!

Fuck the Commandments!
To hell with your norms!
Violate the system!
Give us our freedom!
Letâs change our ways!
Put a stop to the decay!

Trying to make this a better place
Never again shall we feel this way
Trying to make this a better place
Never again shall we feel this way

These faceless crowds, following orders
This anonymous herd, obeying, succumbing
