We had such potential
But we squandered our gifts
Never shall my children see the light of day
Our existence decays

Our blind pursuit of technology
Only accelerated our doom
This is our decimation

We are cherishing
Our slow self-destruction
The world is perishing
But life must go on

It is time, no more days is of prime

Blinded by the extravagance
Fooled by our intelligence
Deluded by the hollowness
So empty and shallow
Cherishing
Self-destruction
Perishing
Must go on [2x]

It is time no more days is of prime

We are cherishing
Our slow self-destruction
The world is perishing
But life must go on

We are cherishing
Our slow self-destruction
The world is perishing
But life must go on

Cherishing
Self-destruction
Perishing
Life must go on
