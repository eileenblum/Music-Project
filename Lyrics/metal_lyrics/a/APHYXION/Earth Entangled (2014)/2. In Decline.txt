The earth is trembling beneath me,
Slowly falling apart
What a relieve it would be 
To close my eyes, never to wake up again 
To close my eyes, never to wake up again

There are no truth nor lies
We are in denial
Everything controlled from above
Slowly blinding us

The sound of dying machines  
Our poison, our medicine

Hear the sound of the dying machines
Our poison and medicine 
The city surrounded by the barren, tepid sea
Bathed in the light of a sun in decline

There are no truth nor lies
We are in denial
Everything controlled from above
Slowly blinding us

The wind is blowing so cold 
It smells metallic, synthetic
We remain out of control
[2x]

The flaming grounds open wide,
As I bathe in the light
Of a sun in decline
I hear the earthâs cry
There are no truth nor lies
We are in denial
Everything controlled from above
Slowly blinding us
No truth nor lies
Controlled from above
No truth nor lies
Controlled from above
