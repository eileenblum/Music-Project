Take your time, ask yourself
What are we here for? 
Your everyday is soaked in the standardized opinions
Made by the leading society
Made by the leading society

Stand up and refuse
Letâs fuck up the norms of humanity
Time to realize the truth 
We are beyond the edge of sanity 
Brainwashed, mindblown, nothing left of the single individual
Mindfucked, brainstormed; with whatever propaganda told
(Propaganda told)
No more creating false facades 

The new breed of dehumanized children
Just a product of the encaged lives of the everyday man
Stand up and refuse
Letâs fuck up the norms of humanity
Time to realize the truth 
We are beyond the edge of sanity 
Brainwashed, mindblown, nothing left of the single individual
Mindfucked, brainstormed
No more creating false facades

Life drained by the disgrace we have become
You are lost
Stand up and refuse
Letâs fuck up the norms of humanity
Time to realize the truth 
We are beyond the edge of sanity 
Brainwashed, mindblown, nothing left of the single individual
Mindfucked, brainstormed
Oh, dear children, you are lost
