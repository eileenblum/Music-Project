Locked together in hatred
Ripping my mind up open
This is the edge for me
One more step 
willlead me to insanity
This is the edge for me 
One more step 
Will lead me to insanity
Every sense of humanity
Fading away
Memories haunting
The lust for blood so taunting

Never shall we be forgiven
Never shall we be forgotten

Remnants of the past
Scars the land
What have we become? 
What should we have left undone? 
The deterioration has begun
Here we fucking go
This is the edge for me 
One more step 
Will lead me to insanity

Every sense of humanity
Fading away
Memories haunting
The lust for blood so taunting

This is the edge for me 
One more step 
Will lead me to insanity

Sweat on my hands,
as I grab your neck,
the snap of your bone, 
reaches my ears
