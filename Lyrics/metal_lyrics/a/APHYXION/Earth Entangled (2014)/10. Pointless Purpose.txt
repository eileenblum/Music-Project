Destructive intentions, no interventions, forever the same
Raping our planet, sucking out all life
No greater meaning, that is our purpose, itâs all lies
The man that I am, everything I despise

Everything will change, but we will stay the same
Weâre back from the start, always tearing apart 
[2x]

I am nothing but the pain I feel inside
Leave behind nothing but the control of my life
We serve no purpose, we are worthless
And everything will change, but we will stay the same
Our greed and hate is everything that man became

So I ignite the soil, and watch the world burn

In the night, I rest
My body is a battlefield, dreams and agony
I have the power to do anything

Everything will change, but we will stay the same
Weâre back from the start, always tearing apart
[2x]

This is my nature
To destroy everything
This is my purpose
We are worthless
