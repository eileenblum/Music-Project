Entwined by the culture he raped
The day of reckoning is near
We shall breathe once again,
Think free thoughts as free men,
Itâs time for us to realize ourselves
Realize ourselves
Reach out, take control of your life
Do not stumble, have no fear
You are free, you are unique
Civilisationâs peak
We are the free men

This is how we shape desperation
This is how we shape the fear of death
This is how we shape exploitation
Wake up, wake up, wake up
A plague on the human mind, we are dying inside
Like cancer, tearing you up from inside
Tearing you up from inside
Like cancer 
Tearing you up from inside
This is how we shape desperation
This is how we shape the fear of death
This is how we shape exploitation
Wake up, wake up, wake up
The day of reckoning is here!
We are breathing once again!
Thinking free thoughts,
we are free men
