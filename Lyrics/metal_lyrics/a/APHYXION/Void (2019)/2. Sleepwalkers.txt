Sleepwalkers
Never speak of the world
We dream about life
Sleepwalkers
Afraid of colors
We hide our smiles

[Bro:]
Pinching my arm, just to let myself know I'm awake
Drugged by the world, stunned by the choices we made

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
We're not living life enough to die
Barely breathing, barely alive
We're not living life enough to die
We are the sleepwalkers of our time
Stuck in a place between sleep and awake
I'm barely breathing, there's nothing left
We're not living life enough to die
We are the sleepwalkers of our time

Sleepwalkers
Can't stand alone,
Always look to the ground
Sleepwalkers
Don't dare to be themselves
At most someone else

[Bro:]
Pinching my arm, just to let myself know I'm awake
Drugged by the world, stunned by the choices we made

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
We're not living life enough to die
Barely breathing, barely alive
We're not living life enough to die
We are the sleepwalkers of our time
Stuck in a place between sleep and awake
I'm barely breathing, there's nothing left
We're not living life enough to die
We are the sleepwalkers of our time

This world has derailed my mind
I ask myself, what is really worth to save?
Clouded thoughts closing in from behind
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave
We're not living life enough to die,
We're not living life enough to die

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
We're not living life enough to die
Barely breathing, barely alive
We're not living life enough to die
We are the sleepwalkers of our time
Stuck in a place between sleep and awake
We're barely breathing, we have no feeling
We're not living life enough to die
We are the sleepwalkers of our time
