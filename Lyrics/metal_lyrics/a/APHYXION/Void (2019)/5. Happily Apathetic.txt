A tear sees its chance
In a moment's imbalance
My thoughts has bound my words
I've looked beyond horizons
For happiness, my call
Who will catch me when I fall?

[Bro:]
I want to be indifferent
Feel nothing at all

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
'Cause I got no hope, hearts not listening
All my dreams are gone, 'cause I got no faith
Can't do this anymore, I know it's my own fault
Got no faith no hope in this broken home
I just wanna feel so happily apathetic

I've spend my whole life
Living up to expectations
Of this wrecked world
I've looked beyond horizons
For happiness, my call
Who will catch me when I fall?

[Bro:]
I want to be indifferent
Feel nothing at all

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
'Cause I got no hope, hearts not listening
All my dreams are gone, 'cause I got no faith
Can't do this anymore, I know it's my own fault
Got no faith no hope in this broken home
I just wanna feel so happily apathetic

Is there any truth in my dreams?
Is there any weight in my words?
Is there any light in my eyes?
Or am I spinning lies?

[Bro:]
I want to be indifferent
Feel nothing at all

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
'Cause I got no hope, hearts not listening
All my dreams are gone, 'cause I got no faith
Can't do this anymore, I know it's my own fault
Got no faith no hope in this broken home
I just wanna feel so happily apathetic
