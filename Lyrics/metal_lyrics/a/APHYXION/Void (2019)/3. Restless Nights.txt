It's hard to even think
The darkness covering my thoughts
My eyes start to blink
I'm over-thinking everything
4 AM knows all my secrets
Insomniac brain overload
Paranoia keeping me sleepless
My head is gonna explode

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Dreams like reflections
Of the future I wasn't given
Sleepless infection
Why can't I just give in

My mind works the night shift
So tired I can't move a limb
My eyes start to blink
I'm over-thinking everything
4 AM knows all my secrets
Insomniac brain overload
Paranoia keeping me sleepless
My head is gonna explode

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Dreams like reflections
Of the future I wasn't given
Sleepless infection
Why can't I just give in
These are my restless nights
These are my eternal fights
A sleepless infection
Why can't I just give in

Now it's 5 AM, fucking 5 AM
The dawn is under the horizon
So tired I can't move a limb
I'm over-thinking everythingâ¦
I'm over-thinking everythingâ¦
I'm over-thinking everythingâ¦

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Dreams like reflections
Of the future I wasn't given
Sleepless infection
Why can't I just give in
These are my restless nights
These are my eternal fights
A sleepless infection
Why can't I just give in
Restless nights
