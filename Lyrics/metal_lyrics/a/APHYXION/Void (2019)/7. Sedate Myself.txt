The easy solution to derail my mind
To escape from reality
The easy solution to leave behind
A mind entwined in agony
I know it's not the way, I know it's not alright,
I can't help myself, I know it's not alright
I know there's help out there, I know there's people who care
But I can't reach them

[Bro:]
I can't feel my fucking face, everything becomes so numb this way

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Sedate myself
Escaping from reality
Sedate myself
To feel free, oh to feel free
I dug myself a hole to deep
To numb my pain, to fall asleep
Sedate myself
To feel free, oh to feel free

I am looking straight in the carnival mirror
Watch my demons come clearer
All is centered around one thing
It's drawing me nearer every day

I know it's not the way, I know it's not alright
This is who I am, I know it's not alright
At least that's what I tell myself every day
To make the thoughts go away

[Bro:]
I can't feel my fucking face, everything becomes so numb this way

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Sedate myself
Escaping from reality
Sedate myself
To feel free, oh to feel free
I dug myself a hole to deep
To numb my pain, to fall asleep
Sedate myself
To feel free, oh to feel free

The days are blurring out, but it's better this way
Just one more moment of precious silence
To keep from hurting, to keep my thoughts at bay
I sedate myself every single fucking day
At some point this poison will sting
At some point this poison will sting

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Sedate myself
Escaping from reality
Sedate myself
To feel free, oh to feel free
I dug myself a hole to deep
To numb my pain, to fall asleep
Sedate myself
To feel free, oh to feel free
To feel free, oh to feel free
I dug myself a hole to deep
To numb my pain, to fall asleep
Sedate myself
To feel free, oh to feel free
