I haven't slept for three days
When I close my eyes, nightmares come alive
Instead I try to stay awake
See if I can make it through another day

[Bro:]
I keep pushing the thoughts away
I'm gonna take one day at a time
But my thoughts keep going astray
To a place that I cannot hide away

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
I keep looking for a gap of sky
I keep looking for reasons to stay alive
I wanna live, not hardly survive
I keep looking for a gap of sky

Sometimes I pinch myself
To see if I recall, still feel at all
Physical pain, cruel disharmony
Trying to make it through another day

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
I keep looking for a gap of sky
I keep looking for reasons to stay alive
I wanna live, not hardly survive
I keep looking for a gap of sky

If I could try again
Take a different path
Stay in the slow lane
Maybe I would find a way

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
I keep looking for a gap of sky
I keep looking for reasons to stay alive
I wanna live, not hardly survive
I keep looking for a gap of sky
