Have you met your demons?
Have you felt real pain?
Have you fought yourself so hard, that your body collapsed?

Have you tried to drown, with your head above water?
Felt life leave from your lungs, felt your body's collapse?

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Have you really felt the pain?
Have you ever felt that you were here in vein?
Loosing yourself, into this hell
So tell me have you ever really felt the pain?

Have you felt you were asleep, when you were really awake?
Have you been trapped in a nightmare, that kept repeating itself?

Have you ever felt your heart pounding through your chest
From when you wake up 'til you go to bed?
Loose yourself in agony
This is your brand new reality

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Have you really felt the pain?
Have you ever felt that you were here in vein?
Loosing yourself, into this hell
So tell me have you ever really felt the pain?

Dolor

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Have you really felt the pain?
Have you ever felt that you were here in vein?
Loosing yourself, into this hell
So tell me have you ever really felt the pain?
