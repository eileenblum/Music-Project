It comes in waves
My heart is racing out of control
The weight of this world
The weight of this world is pushing me down
A stifling feel,
My body is set aside, petrified
The pain in my head
The pain in my head, this feels like the end

[Bro:]
Don't let it suck me in, don't let it take possession of me

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Whirled into the void
I can't drag myself out, this feels like the end
'Cause I'm whirled into the void
Don't let it suck me in, oh this feels like the end
'Cause I'm whirled intoâ¦

The fear of loss
I'm short out of breath, so tight in my throat
It feels so unreal
It feels so unreal, so out of this world
A stifling feel,
My body is set aside, petrified
The pain in my head
The pain in my head, this feels like the end

[Bro:]
Don't let it suck me in, don't let it take possession of me

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Whirled into the void
I can't drag myself out, this feels like the end
'Cause I'm whirled into the void
Don't let it suck me in, oh this feels like the end
'Cause I'm whirled into the void

My whole body shaking, can't feel my legs
Please just bring me back home
Paralyzed, afraid to die, can't feel a thing
My mind is trapped where my demons roam

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Whirled into the void
I can't drag myself out, this feels like the end
'Cause I'm whirled into the void
Don't let it suck me in, oh this feels like the end
'Cause I'm whirled into the void
