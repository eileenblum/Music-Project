No man is an island

I can't get too close
Afraid to be hurt again
But I hate being on my own
Driving myself insane
I haven't been outside my door
For more than a week (for more than a week)
My mind in a state of war
Solitude I seek (solitude I seek)

[Bro:]
I won't wait for them to cut me up, to bring me down

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
I didn't choose for it to be this way
But now I'm by myself again
I fortify myself in my decay
My ship is sinking, no man is an island
No man, no man is an island
No man, no man is an island
No man, no man is an island
My ship is sinking, no man is an island

I can't hear my soul
Everyone is talking shit
I choose to be on my own
About to lose it all
I haven't been outside my door
For more than a week (for more than a week)
My mind in a state of war
Solitude I seek (solitude I seek)

[Bro:]
I won't wait for them to cut me up, to bring me down

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
I didn't choose for it to be this way
But now I'm by myself again
I fortify myself in my decay
My ship is sinking, no man is an island
No man, no man is an island
No man, no man is an island
No man, no man is an island
My ship is sinking, no man is an island

The noise of constant silence
This solitude is strangling me
The weight of my own existence
Pulling me down, burying me

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
I didn't choose for it to be this way
But now I'm by myself again
I fortify myself in my decay
My ship is sinking, no man is an island
No man, no man is an island
No man, no man is an island
No man, no man is an island
My ship is sinking, no man is an island
