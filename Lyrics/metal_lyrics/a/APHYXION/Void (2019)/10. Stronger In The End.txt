I was living, but I was never breathing
This shit's got me broken up
I never say a thing, but inside I'm screaming
Just make this feeling stop

[Bro:]
Just when I think I can't hold it any longer
This is making me stronger

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
I'll rise up like the day, unafraid
With a will to fight in spite of my pain
I will do it all over again
I will be stronger in the end

I do not know how to surrender
'Cause my whole life's been a fight
Oh, and I try, try to remember
How it feels to be alive

[Bro:]
Just when I think I can't hold it any longer
This is making me stronger

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
I'll rise up like the day, unafraid
With a will to fight in spite of my pain
I will do it all over again
I will be stronger in the end

I might have to bend
But I'm not gonna break
And I won't allow it to drown me again

[Bro:]
Just when I think I can't hold it in any longer
This is making me stronger

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
I'll rise up like the day, unafraid
With a will to fight in spite of my pain
I will do it all over again
I will be stronger in the end
