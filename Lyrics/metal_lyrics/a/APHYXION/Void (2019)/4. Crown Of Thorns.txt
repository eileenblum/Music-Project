Bright and early, I'm awake again
For my daily race, never ending chase
Gotta slow down, gotta get a feel
I'm slowly starting to self-debase

Can't step out of the wheel, although I know
There are other ways to meet my craze
For too long time, too much on my mind
I'm slowly starting to self-debase

[Bro:]
We all have demons, I choose to feed mine

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Now I've driven myself to the ground
Thought I had the bull by the horns, this is a lesson to me
I wear my crown of thorns
I thought I had the bull by the horns, the bull by the horns

It worked out fine for so many years,
On the edge of myself everyday
Gotta slow down, gotta get a feel
I'm slowly starting to self-debase
What have I done? What have I become?
Another fucking mule, a slave of income?
For too long time, too much on my mind
I'm slowly starting to self-debase

[Bro:]
We all have demons, I chose to feed mine

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Now I've driven myself to the ground
Thought I had the bull by the horns, this is a lesson to me
I wear my crown of thorns
I thought I had the bull by the horns, the bull by the horns
This is a lesson to me, I can't step out of the wheel
Got to slow down, I've got to get a feel
I wear my crown of thorns
I thought I had the bull by the horns, the bull by the horns

Oh, we all have demons and we like to feed 'em
Yes, we love our demons and we like to feed 'em

[OmkvÃ¦d:]
Now I've driven myself to the ground
Thought I had the bull by the horns, this is a lesson to me
I wear my crown of thorns
I thought I had the bull by the horns, the bull by the horns
This is a lesson to me, I can't step out of the wheel
Got to slow down, I've got to get a feel
I wear my crown of thorns
I thought I had the bull by the horns, the bull by the horns
