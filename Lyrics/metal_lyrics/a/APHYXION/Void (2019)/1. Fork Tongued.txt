Every lie I make
Everything I fake
It starts to get true in my head
But if I came clean
If I broke the routine
You would wish we never met

Fork tongued
I'm sorry that I lost myself
Fork tongued
For living life in disguise
Please pull me out of this river of deceit
Without you I am incomplete
Fork tongued
I'm incomplete

Too proud to admit
I've reached the bottom again
I wish I could reach out for help
If I came clean
If I broke the routine
You would never understand

Fork tongued
I'm sorry that I lost myself
Fork tongued
For living life in disguise
Please pull me out of this river of deceit
Without you I am incomplete
Fork tongued
I'm incomplete

I can't look in your eyes
The guilt is killing me
Living my life in disguise
The guilt is killing me
I'm sorry that I lost myself
I'm sorry that I lose myself
I'm sorry that I lose myself

Fork tongued
I'm sorry that I lost myself
Fork tongued
For living life in disguise
Please pull me out of this river of deceit
Without you I am incomplete
Fork tongued
I'm incomplete
