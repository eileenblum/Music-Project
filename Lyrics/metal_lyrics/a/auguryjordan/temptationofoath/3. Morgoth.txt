[Lyrics and music by Phexataan]

The shadows fall upon us
The earth divides into two
The pure and the evil
The dark side we fall upon
An oath by our nation
Our pain converts into your damnation
We were born to fight
All our enemies, you will (shall) burn

We fight for dignity, we fight for divinity
We fight for dignity, we fight for divinity

We are the troops of metal
An army of immortals
From the wild desert we came
Into a habitation of dragons

The shadows fall upon you
The earth molds again
Evil spirits dominating
The dark side you fall upon
We are the troops you fear
Warriors of the world beneath
All our enemies
Together in hell, you shall burn

Death for the blacksmith, death for the fearful
Death for the blacksmith, death for the fearful

Burn shall thy fleeing war

The Dark side we fall upon
