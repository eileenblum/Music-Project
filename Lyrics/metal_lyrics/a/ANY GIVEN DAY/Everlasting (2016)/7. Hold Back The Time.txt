Hold back the time
Slowly we belong to yesterday's youth
It's hard to bear the ugly truth
Time waits for nobody and standstill is death
We seize every second like it's our last

Breathe deeply once forget the time
10 years have passed in a blink of an eye
With no chance to escape
We walk the line straight to our graves
Walking the line straight to our graves
The line straight to our graves

[Chorus:]
Try to hold back the time it's running out too fast
All the years that we had are buried in the past
The more it goes the more it takes away
On the path of time we've gone astray

Hold back the time

Time is no healer (time is no healer) â time is a thieve
Nothing lasts forever except our memories (memories)

[Chorus:]
Try to hold back the time it's running out too fast
All the years that we had are buried in the past
The more it goes the more it takes away
On the path of time we've gone astray

No matter how many mountains we have climbed
And burning bridges we have crossed
In the end every moment we had
Was a moment we have lost?

Nothing lasts forever
Old pictures in gilded frames
Lock them deep into your heart
The memories are all that remains
