Visit me just one time â one time with your true face
Impress the strangers so you like smoke and mirrors
Decorate your facade to get what you need
They will let you down â regardless

[Chorus:]
No mask of lies can hide the truth
No mask of lies will carry you

Reflect yourself just one time and look deep in your eyes
Is it worth it? All the victims? All the lies?

What will save you now?
Don't judge a book by its cover
What will keep you alive?
Blunt knife on throats of each other
Don't rely on anyone â you are dealing with demons
With closed eyes â nothing on mind â but your own beauty-treatment

[Chorus:]
No mask of lies can hide the truth
No mask of lies will carry you
No mask of lies can hide the truth
The mask of lies will bury you

What will save you now?
What will keep you alive?
Reflect yourself just one time and take a look deep in your eyes

This is the world you have created
Your own world of loveliness and hatred
This is the world you have created
Your own world of loveliness and hatred
This is the world you have created (you have created)
Your own world of loveliness and hatred

[Chorus:]
No mask of lies can hide the truth
No mask of lies will carry you
No mask of lies can hide the truth
No mask of lies will carry you
