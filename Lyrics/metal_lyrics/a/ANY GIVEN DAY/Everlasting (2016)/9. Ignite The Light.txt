Ignite the light

In the light of a candle â that gently gleams
Digging through the cullets â of my broken dreams
I pick them up to put them back together
To start something better
But life has other plans for me

[Chorus:]
At the end of the tunnel
I can see the light
There is still a little something left
Inside me to ignite

I look out of dead eyes â to the naked floor
Searching the room â but can't find a door
Give it up â don't resist â down on your knees
The chokehold I'm in makes it hard to breathe

It's so hard to breathe

No way outside â away from here
My last hope disappears

[Chorus:]
At the end of the tunnel
I can see the light
There is still a little something left
Inside me to ignite

Fight fire with fire turn darkness into light
There's still a little something left
Inside me to ignite

Against the flood I'm standing tall
Tear down the ruins before they fall
A rain of fire and bursting flames
Ashes and smoke are what remains

Against the flood I'm standing tall
Tear down the ruins before they fall (before they fall)
A rain of fire and bursting flames
Ashes and smoke are what remains
â¦are what remains
