Masks of iron, dirt and gold
Faces hiding, looks so cold
Gilded with the most precious jewel
Masks to cover, masks to fool

Chandeliers and cloaks of black
Beauty dancing back to back
With ugliness and jealousy
Behind the mask no one can see
No one can see â your fuckin' identity

[Chorus:]
Burning candles on the floor
It feels like you've been here before
Cause every night and every day
It's just another masquerade
Masquerade

Just another masquerade

Tear off your mask
Tear off your skin
And show the world your disgrace

You can't take off your mask
It has become your only face
What will be left â I ask
When we stop the masquerade

When we stop the masquerade

[Chorus:]
Burning candles on the floor
It feels like you've been here before
Cause every night and every day
It's just another masquerade
Masquerade

Just another masquerade

Tear off their mask (tear off their mask)
And if it's still sticking to their face
Tear off their skin (tear off their skin)
And show the world their disgrace

When we stop the masquerade
