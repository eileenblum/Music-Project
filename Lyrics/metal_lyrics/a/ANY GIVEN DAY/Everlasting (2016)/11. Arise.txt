[feat. Matthew K. Heafy]This is our legacy, your heritage
Our life, blood and promises
We are an iron unity
With bloody shields
Against the same enemy
This is our legacy, your heritage
Our life, blood and promises

[Chorus:]
Out of the ashes we will rise
Like a phoenix on its first flight
This is the chance to build new life
We'll make history tonight

Your eyes are the window to our souls
Open them wide and lead us to our hidden wounds
To stop the rain, to melt the clouds
Heal it from the inside out

[Matthew K. Heafy]
Against all odds we stand tall
No one can hurt us nothing at all

Now it's the time to fight and strife
Get rid of the mess inside
Abandoned souls to purify
We carry on until we die

[Chorus:]
Out of the ashes we will rise
Like a phoenix on its first flight
This is the chance to build new life
We'll make history tonight

Rise! Rise! Rise! Rise!

Now it's the time to fight and strife
Get rid of the mess inside
Abandoned souls to purify
We carry on until we die
