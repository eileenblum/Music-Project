As I walked through this deathly quiet place
A tomb for every heart's disgrace
The chains lie silent on the stones
Walls are built out of skulls and bones

In obscurity I've lost my track
Between helplessness and shades of black
Too tight to move - too dark to see
Without a light to guide me

Is this where I meet my doom?

[Chorus:]
If all hope is gone - I accept my fate
I lay my head on this broken slate
When I'm dead - assign me a place
Pile my bones and rest my soul
In this empty space

I took the wrong turn
And followed the forbidden path
To a place I should not be
A place of hatred and wrath

With every step I move forward (forward)
It takes me two steps back
With every breath that I take (I take)
The sling gets tighter around my neck

[Chorus:]
If all hope is gone - I accept my fate
I lay my head on this broken slate
When I'm dead - assign me a place
Pile my bones and rest my soul
In this empty space

Is this where I meet my doom?
My cold infernal tomb?
Desperate cries without a sound
The only way out is the way deep down

[Andy Posdziech solo]

With every step I move forward (forward)
It takes me two steps back
With every breath that I take (I take)
The sling gets tighter around my neck

Is this where I meet my doom?

[Chorus:]
If all hope is gone - I accept my fate
I lay my head on this broken slate (on this broken slate)
When I'm dead - assign me a place
Pile my bones and rest my soul (rest my soul)
In this empty space
