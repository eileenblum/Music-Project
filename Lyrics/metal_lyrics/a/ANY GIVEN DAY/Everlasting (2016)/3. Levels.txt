A one way ticket to reality â destination unknown
A death trip to infinity or a journey back home
Is this really happening or only in my head
Free fall in slow motion â maybe, we're already death

Should we drift apart?
Or swim against the tide
Just one simple choice to make
What is wrong and what is right

[Chorus:]
We're all playing the same game
Just in different levels
We're all suffering the same hell
Just with different devils
Small gearwheels in a big machine
Of sadness and sorrow
Fed with desperation and
Iron tubes to swallow

Narcotics running through our veins
To keep us calm, to numb the pain
Unreal stories implanted to our minds
An artificial coma â false truth real lies

Should we drift apart?
Or swim against the tide
Just one simple choice to make
What is wrong and what is right

Stories â lie hidden in the sands of time
We look up to the sky for one single sign
Motionless on the ground
As with a broken spine
Waiting for someone to stop our decline

[Chorus:]
We're all playing the same game
Just in different levels
We're all suffering the same hell
Just with different devils
Small gearwheels in a big machine
Of sadness and sorrow
Fed with desperation and
Iron tubes to swallow

We don't know what we want
We don't know what we get
Two pills on the table
One is blue, one is red
