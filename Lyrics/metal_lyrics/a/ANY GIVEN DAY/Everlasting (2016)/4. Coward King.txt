Breathless you reach for your crown
Beyond burns everything you've ever known
Just a poor man is all that's left
A scorched portrait is your bequest

Your tormented soul the demons shall keep
Onto parchment are composed your guilt and greed
The dust of decades underneath your feet
Your spirit still yearns still seek

[Chorus:]
You had everything and you've lost it all
The highest flight it is the deepest fall
Can't you hear the darkness calls?

The tide that rises is the tide that falls

Coward king
Your fortress walls have failed
Coward king
Your whine will be to no avail
Coward king
The kingdom stands ablaze
Your numbered days have turned blue to grey
Coward king
Your fortress walls have failed
Coward king
Your whine will be to no avail
Coward king
Can't you hear the darkness calls?
The tide that rises is the tide that falls

Breathless you reach for your crown
Beyond burns everything you've ever known
Just a poor man is all that's left
A scorched portrait is your bequest

You had everything
You had everything
Can't you hear the darkness calls?

[Chorus:]
You had everything and you've lost it all
The highest flight it is the deepest fall
Can't you hear the darkness calls?
