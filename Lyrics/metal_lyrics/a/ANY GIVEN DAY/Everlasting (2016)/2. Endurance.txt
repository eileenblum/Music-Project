This is who we are and this is where we stay

We are strong, we are determined but not free of mistakes
Our life is the hardest lesson â it teaches us to resist
Still proud, still honest â our greatest gift

[Pre-chorus:]
Every day is another crusade â we defend it with all we've got
Eye for an eye â armed to the teeth â blood for blood

[Chorus:]
We have to go straight until we fall â we take it the hard way
There's no need to change tomorrow if we can change today

This is who we are and this is where we stay

We've got to take our life back â one chance to make it right
Hold your hands beside the flame â breathe in and keep it alive

[Pre-chorus:]
Every day is another crusade â we defend it with all we've got
Eye for an eye â armed to the teeth â blood for blood

[Chorus:]
We have to go straight until we fall â we take it the hard way
There's no need to change tomorrow if we can change today

Obliterate â what makes us weak
Full speed ahead â salvation is what we seek
What's done is done â let the past be the past
Arise and take each moment as if it's the last

Trust â when no one believes
Live when you're almost dead
Breathe â to stop drowning
Don't trust those lies they told you

[Chorus:]
We have to go straight until we fall â we take it the hard way
There's no need to change tomorrow if we can change today
We can change today
