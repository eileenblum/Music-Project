[Chorus (speaking):]
This is the kingdom of the sinners
Ain't no hope for the saints?
We have to fight for what we believe in
We keep going forward never looking back

Finally we have reached the lowest ground
There's nothing more to lose
Another chapter has just begun
There is so much left to prove

We are calm and resolved
Even when the going gets rough
Go hard or go down
Cause enough is enough

The darkness behind us â in deepest black
Keep going forward (forward) and never looking back

[Chorus:]
This is the kingdom of the sinners
Ain't no hope for the saints?
We have to fight for what we believe in
We keep going forward â never looking back

Never looking back
We will never look back

Go hard or go down â is the headline of the game
Forget the old agony â by causing new pain
When the going gets rough â we've gonna get rougher
Through all these year's we've learned how to suffer (how to suffer)

The darkness behind us â in deepest black
Keep going forward (forward) and never looking back

[Chorus:]
This is the kingdom of the sinners
Ain't no hope for the saints?
We have to fight for what we believe in
We keep going forward â never looking back

Never looking back (never looking back)

We have to fight for what we believe in
We keep going forward â never looking back
