[Chorus:]
This is our farewell â the pain we've caused remains unspoken
A sanctuary for the heartless â a heartless home for the broken

The eternal night comes down and covers us from within
The city lights go black at the sight of your pale skin
Nothing's around, except the will to comprehend
This is where it started and this is where it ends

[Pre-chorus:]
Can't you hear my heart â it beats for you
Through all the time â it beats for you
It beats for two

[Chorus:]
This is our farewell â the pain we've caused remains unspoken
A sanctuary for the heartless â a heartless home for the broken

We tried so hard â but we have failed
We have exceeded the line â and stayed jailed
Memories of a forgotten past guide us through
The best of me is the worst of you

[Pre-chorus:]
Can't you hear my heart â it beats for you
Through all the time â it beats for you
It beats for two

[Chorus:]
This is our farewell â the pain we've caused remains unspoken
A sanctuary for the heartless â a heartless home for the broken

The further we went on our path together
The further we have grown apart forever
