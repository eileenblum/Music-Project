[Chorus:]
I am alone (I am alone)
This bitter man that I've become
Hold my breath â laid to rest
Drown in my tears there's nothing left of me
I am alone
The angry man upon his throne
I can't pretend â the great descent
Take my hand until the end

You see me on the horizon
I am the air you breathe
I sold my soul to the seven seas

Condemned and lost
Pulled off course
I will never leave â I'm always yours

[Pre-chorus:]
Each time I stand ashore
With sand between my toes
I remember and I know

[Chorus:]
I am alone (I am alone)
This bitter man that I've become
Hold my breath â laid to rest
Drown in my tears â there's nothing left of me
I am alone
The angry man upon his throne
I can't pretend â the great descent
Take my hand until the end

The water will wash away my pain and sorrows
A stranger in the night who blindly follows â who follows
This is the path I choose and this is the place I die
When heaven rests itself upon the earth
I'm one step closer to the sky

To the one I loved â now lost
To the one I sheltered from the rain that turned to frost
To the sunken feeling when I saw your face
I will perish in never ending disgrace

You are the sea â I am the shore
I will never leave â I'm always yours

[Pre-chorus:]
Each time I stand ashore
With sand between my toes
I remember and I know

[Chorus:]
I am alone (I am alone)
This bitter man that I've become
Hold my breath â laid to rest
Drown in my tears â there's nothing left of me
I am alone
The angry man upon his throne
I can't pretend â the great descent
Take my hand until the end

There is a world inside me
It lives, it hurts â it barely breathes
I cast my heart into the sea
If it means it brings you closer to me
