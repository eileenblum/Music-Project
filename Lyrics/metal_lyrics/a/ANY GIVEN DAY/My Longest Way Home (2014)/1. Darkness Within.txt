wake up - wake up

wake up when the dark hits the ground
I'm searching for something
that can never be found - no
my blood is boiling and the sweat is running cold
wake up when blue turns to black
a pale face in the mirrow
cruel thoughts in my head
my body is burning - all the silence is much too loud
so fucking wasted

I feel so fucked up - it feels so good
don Ìt need no second chance - no need for excuse

oh my god what have I done
I have gone way too far

blood covers the floor - spill the blood
you cover my skin - spill the blood
darkness covers the walls - spill the blood
darkness from deep within

look at the world straight through my eyes
this ugly place is slowly dying
I never felt so alive
before a new day sets this night is mine

I love the feeling - to lose all control of myself
every night - every night -
when the moon is full - up in the sky
I'm like an animal - driven by the hunger for life
a human beast - everyone dies
everything dies tonight

sleeping on a bed of nails - walking on broken glass
a thousand needles in my skin - I couldn't care less
suffer in ecstasy - I cut a smile into my face
this is the life I wanna live - cause I'm not dead yet

don't need no second chance - no need for excuse
I take back what's mine tonight - nothing to lose

look at the world straight through my eyes
this ugly place is slowly dying
I never felt so alive
before a new days sets this night is mine

blood covers the floor
you cover my skin
darkness covers the walls
darkness from deep within

don't fuck with me
better get out of my way - better get out of my sight
I burn this fucking city down â tonight
don't fuck with us
