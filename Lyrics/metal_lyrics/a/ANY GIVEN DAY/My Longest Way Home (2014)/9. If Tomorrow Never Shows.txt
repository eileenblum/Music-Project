no desire - no regret -
no more despair - there is no hope left
I never felt so jaded - I never felt so wrong
all love has turned to hatred - I'm better of all alone
without you sucking me dry

I will never forgive you for what you've done to me
I will never forget you - just wait and you will see

if tomorrow never shows - I just want you to know
we once were one - but now these days are over

don't tell me now - with a smile in your fucking face
that you are lost - you are down and out
how does it feel
that shit you're talking don't mean nothing
to me - anymore
you will get what you deserve - you fucking whore

FUCK YOU

no desire - no regret - no more despair - there is
no hope left
I never felt so jaded - I never felt so wrong
all love has turned to hatred - I'm better of all alone

if tomorrow never shows - I just want you to know
we once were one - but now these days are over
you don't need to run and hide
I will find you anywhere
I will never forgive you
until you're dead like me
suffer just like me bitch

your poison words still taste so sweet
but these wheights tide up around your feet
keep on pulling you down - pulling you down
to the ground of the deep black sea

no desire - no regret -
no more despair - there is no hope left
I never felt so jaded - I never felt so wrong
all love has turned to hatred - I'm better of all alone

no desire - no regret - no more despair

if tomorrow never shows - I just want you to know
we once were one - but now these days are over
