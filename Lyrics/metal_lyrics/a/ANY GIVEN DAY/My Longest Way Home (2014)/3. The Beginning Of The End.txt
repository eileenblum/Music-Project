This life is constantly on its way down I have learned my lesson well
Such a bitter pill for me to swallow
Like a fucking desease
That corrodes from inside

Goddamn this makes me fucking sick I can't take this any longer
Goddamn I'm fucking sick
Born again at the beginning of the End

With every breath I try to breathe
The hole inside me grows
With every day I try to live I die a little more

Empty hearts
Wasted hopes
Forgotten dreams
Broken Bones

All the time that I was lost I have learned my lesson well
From cradle to grave
What have I become
What doesn't kill makes me more strong

Dying is easy
This life is a bitch I open my mind and clench my fist
Still unbroken, still alive
A one man army, a one man fight

All the time that i was lost I have learned my lesson well
From cradle to grave
What have I become
What doesn't kill makes me more strong

Don't let this life beat you down
Stand on your feet or die on the ground Eat the dirt and bite the nail
SHOW ME WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF!!

Your time has come now
Breathe in
Bleed out no more sick and tired Breathe in
Bleed out now i'm spitting fire
