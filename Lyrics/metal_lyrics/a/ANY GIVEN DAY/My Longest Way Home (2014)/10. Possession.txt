The reflection reveals only what we want to see
facing the betrayal of humanity
the unhollowed root nurtred by the bursted plague
abstract our attitude to life

this is what we've become
a self betrayal breed with no remorse

our empty souls are hopelessly possessed
this mental possession will lay us to rest
wired and castigated by devils hand on a burial ground

it's deep deep down below

stillborn we are drifting in incubators
lying in open graves - forevermore
the reflection reveals only what we want to see
facing the betrayal of humanity

this is what we've become

our empty souls are hopelessly possessed
this mental possession will lay us to rest
wired and castigated by devils hand on a burial ground

WE COME SO ALIVE

it creates our human shell to an existence of eternity

once the prey is down
a sense of relief flows to us
while we await your last breath
doomed from its birth
addled we're obliged to murder
