The weight of the world lays on my shoulders
I carry it as long as I exist
The strain of life is pushing me forward
and I will never let it go

The weight of the world lays on my shoulders
I carry it as long as I exist
The strain of life is pushing me forward
and I will never let it go

Wind blows through sails on heavy seas
holding with both hands tight the helm
Even surrendering wonÂ´t ease the pain
looking ahead and never go back again

There is a fire burning deep inside
itÂ´s my redemption and I decide
Count my blessings - touch my face
I close my eyes in these times of grace

In time the sunÂ´s gonna shine on me
my longest way home
the hardest path of destiny

Destiny!

The weight of the world lays on my shoulders
I carry it as long as I exist
The weight of the world lays on my shoulders
I carry it as long as I exist
The strain of life is pushing me forward
and I will never let it go

The weight of the world lays on my shoulders
I carry it as long as I exist
The strain of life is pushing me forward
and I will never let it go

IÂ´m searching for freedom - all I found were chains
IÂ´m looking for love - but all I found was hate
To find it cost me everything I had
and to get it takes everything I am

This moment is all that matters
Weigh the anchor in the eye of the storm

HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS
