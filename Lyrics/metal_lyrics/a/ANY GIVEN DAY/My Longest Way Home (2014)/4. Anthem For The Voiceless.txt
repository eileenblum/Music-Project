we push you to the limit again
can you feel the shockwave
come take the first punch
we are bad to the bone - my friend
troublemaker - we just can't get enough

the ground is shaking under your feet
walls are falling - we're tearing it down
bang your head and pump your fists
grap your friends and freak out to the sound

with the noise of a million throats
we scream it out loud
we are the thundering voice of the voiceless
with the brute force of a sledge hammer that hits
right into your guts
and what's left behind in the shattered glass
is blood sweat and tears

this song is our anthem - hold your fists up high
the soil is bursting - fire is burning in the sky
this song is our anthem - hold your drinks up high
we stand together as one - until we die

nobody moves - then nobody gets hurt
better wishing the best - but expecting the worst
do this again till the break of dawn
fill your glasses up - pour the killfort down
we are troublemaker - we are bad to the bone

this life means pain and it's a long hard road to walk
every minute is a lifetime - our time is much to short
building castles out of ruins - with the back against the wall
giving up was never an option - nothing can hold us down
