have to rise and rise again - come on
till all the lambs become lions
to tough and proud to give up
much too strong to lose
compassion is for the dying
choke down all of the dirt and spit out my anger

it's not a threat - it's a promise
I will make you taste the pain
it's not a threat - it's a promise
revolution is my name

bite my fingers down to the bone
I will find the way - I know my goal
kick the pedal down to the floor
because what you reap is what you sow

what you reap is what you sow

get up off your knees to arise
everyday a new battle to survive

you shall not fear death
but a life you never start to live
never say die - never say die - again

this story begins - as death takes one more soul
this story begins - just with a headshot
the timebomb is ticking - your mayhem is near
the blood is falling down with every single tear

what more can you preach - what more
if there is smoke there is fire
I throw my cards on the table
I don't give a fuck
avoid no fight - I am no fucking coward
these scars remind me that my past is real
you shall not fear death but a life you never start to live never say die - never say die - again

one man's meat is another man's poison
better watch your fucking back
never a failure - always a lesson
I break your fucking neck
