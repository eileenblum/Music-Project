Congratulation - you finally made it
there's nothing good left inside of me

I'm running through your veins -
like poison in your blood
every single word I whisper -
slits you like a thousand cuts
read between these lines - it has only just begone
you are so full of shit - we are so fucking done

we are so fucking done right now

dead and gone

I Ìve tried to be a better man - I Ìm not
the first cut is always the deepest
I don Ìt knoe the answer - but I know the truth
Inside - everything torn to pieces

I've waited for this moment so long -
it's burning from inside
this all makes no sense to you -
how could you be so blind
I've tried to be a better man -
but right now I'm not
swollow all your lies and keep you fucking mouth shut
don't waste my motherfucking time -
keep your mouth shut
right now

I love to hear you cry
I love to see you die

blood is slowly dripping from a knife
the only way for me to say goodbye
your blood is slowly dripping from a knife
read between these lines

I've tried to be a better man - I'm not
the first cut is always the deepest
I don't know the answer - but I know the truth
Inside - everything torn to pieces
I've triede to be a better man - right now I'm not
I don't know the answer
I am the truth

how does it feel to dig your own fucking grave

buried alive
it's all said and done
dead and gone
