words are hurting me from deep within
you are pushing nails beneath my skin
again I'm tainting my body and soul
abandoned with my heart shaped piece of coal

I don't know how it could get this far
drowning the truth seems to heal my scars

you won't ever hear that pounding in my chest
it's buried alive - left behind - forced to rest
I'm escaping to be dead forever
I am so soaked out - it never felt better

I cannot imagine to live without being nump
forgetting my fears and sorrows when I'm drunk
everything is moving in slow motion
hurting myself cause my feelings are frozen

I don't know how it could get this far
drowning the truth seems to heal my scars

you won't ever hear that pounding in my chest
it's buried alive - left behind - forced to rest
I'm escaping to be dead forever
I am so soaked out - it never felt better

you won't ever hear that pounding in my chest
this blackened heart will never be a part of me again
it's buried alive - left behind - forced to rest

you won't ever hear that pounding in my chest
it's buried alive - left behind - forced to rest
I'm escaping to be dead forever
I am so soaked out - it never felt better
