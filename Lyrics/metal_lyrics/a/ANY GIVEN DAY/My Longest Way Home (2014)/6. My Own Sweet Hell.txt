kiss your fucking ass goodbye

I won't let this happen
stay the fuck away
I won't let it go

suffer the same fate
wasting away till the end
wake up on the other side
a hot bath and a cold razor-blade
like a gunshot straight to my face - it hits me again
tie me a rope - counting the days
my eyes full of dust - full of dirt

counting my days - will this be the end
tie me a rope - my mouth full of dust
and a smile made of stone in a melting face

finally the monster in me has become alive
this monster wears my skin
the devil has taken my soul
I wanna be honest - I have no choice

I have found myself - in my own sweet hell
these old wounds won't heal
they will hurt forever - bleed forever
in my own sweet hell - I've found myself
my scars will never heal
they will bleed forever - hurt forever

suffer the same fate
wasting away till the end
wake up on the other side
a hot bath and a cold razor-blade

all what is left behind is worthless now
everything I ever loved is ripped apart

finally the monster in me has become alive
this monster wears my skin
the devil has taken my soul

I wanna be honest

in my own sweet hell - I've found myself
my scars will never heal
they will bleed forever - hurt forever
I wanna be honest

in my own sweet hell - I've found myself
my scars will never heal
they will bleed forever - hurt forever
