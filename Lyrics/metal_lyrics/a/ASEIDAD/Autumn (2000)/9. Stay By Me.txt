Where the streets fall down the planet
where the cow's spit calls devil
the litl' people lives on the spider net
laughing `till their skins smells like evil.

The night comes down my eyes,
my body tremble with courage
almost dead, almost alive
and the pain must be discharged.

I'm dreaming the hell
fire runs in my throat
I'm feeling the hell
my ears full of blood.

The night came nearest, near to my head
I won't die if you're here with me
with your breathe I can run from death
stand by me, stand by me.
I can't heal my pain
tha attack rides my brain
stomach turns insane
I can't heal my pain.

I'm dreaming the hell
fire runs in my throat
I'm feeling the hell
my ears full of blood.

Don't call the priest,
he won't believe me
please hold my hand
your touch release me
open your mouth
your air is fresher
gimme your lips
just stand - by - me.
