I used to take a second for a pray
I used to sleep on a freezing bed of stone.
Chages twist your life
Changes twist your mind.

Time has come again
time to be alone.

What I belived
now is a ready gone, already gone
are lonely tears dancing inside a storm.

I'm crying, resting on myself
I'm dying, shifting life to death
I'm falling, down from the height
I'm dreaming, from heaven to hell.

With a white moon in a dark sky
on my own like the moon the emptiness surrond me.
(crying, dreaming, falling, drifting, fading, away
