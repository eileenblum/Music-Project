Your sweet efluvium
distilled in drowned season
receive it from 
receive it from 
your strange lips,
I've engendered
silent caress
but now you can
but now you can
break my self. 

Angel efluvium, entomb me beneath the bitter cloak
angel efluvium, your efluvium in my mouth.

You can die in other love
I denied your urge
I'm buried with my faults 
`cause you embrace me
`cause you embrace me. 

You can die in other love
I denied your urge
I'm buried with my faults 
`cause you embrace me
`cause you embrace me.
