A car run fast in the ave.
leaving a trail full of blood
you think we'll never can get you
you think you'll never stop.

have you ever thought `bout my feelings?
did you have some mercy at all?
people says you paid for my killing
all i have is a stomach to crawl.

Papers shows you acting your play
paying for a story of silence
paying for a short twist of fate
you know you have no defense
you know you have no defense.

Your son is waiting for justice
a stranger is paying the crime
i ask what kind of shit is this
Actually, you don't give a dime.

Papers shows you acting your play
paying for a story of silence
paying for a short twist of fate
you know you have no defense
you know you have no defense.
