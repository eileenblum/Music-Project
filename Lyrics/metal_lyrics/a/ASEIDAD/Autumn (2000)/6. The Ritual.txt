On the mountain flames are trying to burn the sky.
The wizard dances around the rising fire.
gods are waking up in the sky,
spirits lose control.
The energy is blowing from their eyes,
in the town people are afraid, look them cry,
trying to catch her soul
from the other side.

Suddenly she came from the freezen winds,
with a mortal sweet kiss
touch his lips and take his soul away.
