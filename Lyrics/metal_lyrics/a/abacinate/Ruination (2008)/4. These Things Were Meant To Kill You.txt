My head is full of change
Reaching for something strange
Iâve spent all my time just not giving fuck
I canât stay
Can you seeâ¦ see it behind my eyes?
Take it and hide it and live in the dark
Please donât speak
Quick ecstasy, Quick dose of Scotch Whiskey
Where are my keys, I swear I can drive this thing
I hope I kill little children, I hope I hit a tree
Nothing to live for anyways, Iâve got nothing loose
A good taste of snow, and it hits when it hits the back of my throat
And Iâm alive now!
Made to thrill you, all along these things were meant to kill you
Fast women and fast machines
Someone who knows, but it ainât possible
Weâll all burn!
Made to thrill you, all along these things were meant to kill you
Fast women and fast machines
It will always thrill you, these things above all things were meant to kill you
Fast women and fast mistakes
When youâre drunk and stoned
And youâre all alone
Lock all doors and destroy your fucking phone
Spill the bong, talk like a wasted slob
It ainât so bad as the last I had
Puts my mind in overdrive
Bloody nose and loss of erection
A Teenage whore wants it somewhat more
âItâs Jesus in a bowlâ She said.
A sniff of H
Then stomach torture
I lose my mind, then get a grip
Stumble, Trip, Fuck, Shit, Kill Me Quick
This will be my relief
Letâs interbreed the sanguine seed
Turn into a whore with dying eyes
