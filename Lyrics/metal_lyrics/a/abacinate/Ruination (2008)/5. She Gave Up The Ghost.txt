Lost, consumed in a moment
Engulfed by illusions behind her eyes
There is no solution to being a liar
Deceiving the beast
This all made sense until just then
Letâs just pretend that god is dead
Pressedâ¦ Back is breaking, Praise her eyes
No solitude within the lusting mind
Please believe me and waste your time
This all made sense until just then
Letâs just pretend that god is dead
No certain direction but certainly blind
Regress is endless as the end of all time
Smashing all boundaries, never confined
Burning my bridges, cutting my ties
Nowâ¦ Faced with consequenceâ¦ Should have planned it ahead
Might as well be dead, Over and over again
A Fuck thatâs the slice of all time
And I must be out of my mind
I canât begin to describe this shit
Youâve got me out of my mind bitch, you!
Slaughter your Daughter
Misogynistic killing spree
Her blood is so hot
I will do this just for me
My Sword stays Wet
I am now beside myself
Regret? Remorse?
Itâs too late to think of that
Your Cuntâ¦
Sheâs giving up the Ghost again
Whore? Slut?
Or just another Fuck-Friend?
Or Love?
I wonât forget what you just said
Now Youâre Dead
Score One for Jesus; Itâs a Sin â Prayâ¦
What The Fuck?!
One Less Mouth to Feed for me
The end result is like Blood in your Feces
What Iâve done I canât take back
The eyes roll back in the head as I stand and
Watch Her Bleed
If anyoneâs dead it should be me
What in the god-damn Hell could I have been thinking
What Iâve done I canât take back
I guess itâs time to end this life
Why My Life?
I canât Lie for long
I Just need to Off Myself, Your Blood is my Shelter
It feels just like back in the Day, Playing with Razors
We can be Free and Rot in Hell, Iâll Love You Forever
A Fuck thatâs the slice of all time
And I must be out of my mind
I canât begin to describe this shit
Youâve got me out of my mind bitch, you!
-This brings us Closer-
