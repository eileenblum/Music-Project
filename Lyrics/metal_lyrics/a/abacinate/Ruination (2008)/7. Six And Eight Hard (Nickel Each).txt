I realize Iâm obscene
Thinking things I shouldnât think
Think of things that we all see
All the time on your T.V.
Sluts are cool, Whore is cool
If youâre drunk, itâs all good
Suck a cock, think of Mom
The Hymenâs broke, on cum she chokes
And sheâs only thirteen
No longer a virgin, and whoâs to blame?
Reality? Or T.V.?
Media banks on it, Ruining Youth
Too much acceptance of moral abuse
Will be our downfall, Weak and Complacent
Chasing a farce, A false Dream
And this dream will be just what you prayed forâ¦
Lies!!!
And so we preach fornication
Lost souls recruited in force
And so we reach jubilation
Let me rejoice because our kids are all whores
Iâm sorry, what?
Explain your intentionsâ¦
The new wave hookers,
Five!
A Teenage Queen of the Torture Soul
The horror is so hot
Donât beg when you come aroundâ¦
So youâll get ahead in life, just making an offering
Sexual favors and a touch of class
You want the fame and money, the glitz and glam
But they never taught you a certain respectâ¦no
Media â Silver â Gold
The Center Attention
The Force Fed Misdirection
Itâs Me, Always Me
On Your T.V. Screen (X4)
Iâm sorry, what?
Explain your intentionsâ¦
The new wave hookers,
Five!
A Teenage Queen of the Torture Soul
The horror is so hot
Six And Eight Hard (Nickel Each)â¦
So youâll get ahead in life, just making an offering
Sexual favors and a touch of class
You want the fame and money, the glitz and glam
But they never taught you a certain respect
Girls Gone Wild featuring Your Child
Tell that little bitch she hasnât lost her touch
