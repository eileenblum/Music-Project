I can sleaze my brain disease and smell the interfection
Smoke some shit, weâll talk some shit and maybe learn a lesson
Kill all the scum and all the pigs and crooked politicians
Grab all your guns and all of your sons weâll start this revolution nowâ¦
Before itâs too late
We must recuperate
Open all blind eyes
Look forward to the end of life
The things weâve seen
The things I know that you know
We can not be the only ones that know right know whoâs got to goâ¦
We bleed from inside
Intestine pain spreading out
Crystals behind our eyes
Thirsty for your glands
Should I sew this shut or leave it open?
Fluids mist the air spreading interfection
Infecting all weâll start this revolution
Ending all of time
The ones who donât believe me
Weâll cast out from our lines
And theyâll all die believing
The Interfection makes the lawsâ¦
