I hate this place more, get me floored
Abject failure, familiar
My eyes are sore
Mistakes in the course of whatâs worth living for
Poster child for cerebral palsy
Heartfelt concerns nauseate
Use me for this vivisection
Itâs not entirely too late
Experiments are necessary
Deforming, living surgery
Anesthesia, likely not to benefit
More generally, ending the suffering
I hope I neverâ¦
I hope I never come backâ¦
I am not self-conscious at all
Only here as means to an end
I will not be self conscious at all
I am only here as a means to an end
This end is manâ¦ [X4]
Use this body for vivisection
Sensible to pain, no affection
Of pity, certain things savoring of cruelty
To cut up alive, involving dissection
Call it what you will
Remove my eyes, Iâm sick of vision
Life lived black and still
Kill my mind, itâs my decision
My consent, my own will
I canât reason â I canât speak â Only, Will I sufferâ¦ here [X2]
Various chemical substances injected in me
Stick around, when it goes down, itâs something to see
Beat my legs with hammers and then smash in my knees
The only way to cure this shit depression disease
Donât feel bad, itâs all I have, itâs something I need
Let me be for a whileâ¦ Let me be forever
The broken dreams of a childâ¦ Let me be the never
Herophilos - Six hundred dead â Experiments are necessary â This has always been
Iâm losing sight; Iâve lost the state of mindâ¦
Torture Board Death Chamber â Lab Rat Cart Racing
Scientific Merit Ethically Defended
The cutting of or operation, While Iâm wide awake
An Investigation, For Physiological and Pathological
Minute or Pitiless Examination
