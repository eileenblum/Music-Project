Such values I learned
Somewhere in days past got burnt
Rip the memory down
Bury it deep in frozen ground

I took my age of lividity
Blackened eyes of naivety
Where did everything get lost?
The consequence my lifestyle "fuck it" cost

The hardcore and the piss poor
Euphoria is my knees, fucking whore
That shit caresses my soul â Turns flesh to steel (reserve)
Scars and emotions I will never have to forget, less feel

Bleeding my honor â I let down my father
Why repent â Why bother
Bleeding Honor

I could see the doubt in your fucking face â I don't need your help, I
Don't need family â you could give it all to me and I'll just fuck it away
â I never learn, only fuck and bleed

Blood that came with a message to heed â Straighten the fuck right out!
I saw your life end in my dreams â Straighten the fuck right out!
I Could not move, I could not breathe â Straighten the fuck right out!
All the sick shit that I've seen â To straighten the fuck right... out!

Bleeding my honor â I let down my father
Why repent â Why bother
Bleeding Honor

And still, the voices beg me...â¦

Burn your bridges... Burn your bridges...
Rape yourself. Unstitch the stitches
