Crawling from the teenage years (Beat Down)
We were just a bunch of queers (On Dope)
Dopes...

I have a dream of Violent Screams
A vivid, blooded scene â Disgorge!
Paint it red, scent of death
I'll always have these fucked up morbid visions in my head
Bought a gun, made me cum when I dropped the first ones â Faggots!
Killing can be fun, if you've got the right gun
50 CAL FANTASY!

She was looking so hot when she was twelve years old.
But age fourteen she was lost, when she got pregnant
He was the hottest boy in class, they fed his ego
But when he raped that little bitch, he died in jail, Son
Joe was the class President and he became a Cop
One day he let his guard down; man took his gun and shot him DOWN!

Turn on the T.V. or open a magazine
I'm slapped in the face with all the shit I won't believe
Gonna buy a shotgun and just go on a rampage
And leave behind miles of dead bodies rotting
Politics and the filthy rich add to my frustration
Got me thinking thoughts of the sickest relation

Your love came from my blood
My love comes in your blood
Send you to your bleeding one above
Now you'll get what you de(fucking)serve
