Knowledge Is The Weapon 
Against The Hunger In The Land 

Solitude Met Herself 
Lessons From The Primal Step 
Memories From An Ending Life 
Liars Can't Stop The Tribes

Brother Is The Son Of Rape 
The Blood That Once United 
Wanna Choose The Way They Die 
Look Inside Their Minds

The Ancient Teachings Fails 
Movement Of My Culture 
My Beliefs Have No More Tales

The World Will Be Extinct 
And Your Flesh Will Rot With Mine
