An unreal dream
Where peace is all around
Beneath the glimmer of color
The shadow of the thorn
With open eyes shining
Through the empty halls around
What once seemed real
Just a shadow in my mind
Longing, searching for the truth
Say, say where I stand
Beneath the silent wheel
The same dusty road
A heart marble cold
Feeling nothing but contempt
With eyes in search for freedom
Blinded by prejudice
A mind in search of wisdom
Fooled... again
Longing, searching for the truth
Say, say where I stand
I want to know the answer to
What lies beyond this hand
Betray your will
Release these chains that hold me down
Empty gods that stain you life
Guilt remains
Defeat the gods that hold me down
These pantheon walls no longer stand
Lost within yourself
Try to reach for something new
The rose that promised hope
Withered from within
Stop staring at the sky
You are way above at the moon
