Your words cut deep just like a knife
Make me bleed
Poisonous venom you live in hate
Feed me fear
It's hard to see behind your lies
As your words betray your thin disguise
Words adrift in a sea of lies
Lost in the tides
Destroy at will to find what you lack
A stab in the back
It's hard to see behind your lies
As your words betray your thin disguise
Your intention is hard to erase
A masquerade with an angel's face
In your eyes the burning desire
Words behind a heart of stone
Don't mean a thing
Cover my eyes so I can see
With my soul
Your intention is hard to erase
A masquerade with an angel's face
In your eyes the burning desire
I want to see what's real tonight
