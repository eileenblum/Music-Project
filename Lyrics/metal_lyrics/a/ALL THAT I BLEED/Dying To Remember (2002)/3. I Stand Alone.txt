One more time it burns at night
As the tears fall
I can't remember the last time I cried
I can't explain how much I hate or love myself
But do I lie if I say I feel the same way about you?
This lullaby is only in my head
The real world is the one you represent
Why can't I see you in the mirror
Father, mother I stand alone
And I can't face the world
As I choke on reality's sick and twisted game
I see my life and I just can't stand it
As I bear you and the one's you've handled
Where did she go
As you held me in your arms
Once again I lay here at night
As a wayward son consumed by things gone wrong
God I can't explain how much I miss her
As I kneel in tears asking her to come back
This guilt is a part of me alone
This emptiness the one I represent
Why can't I see me in the mirror?
Father, mother I stand alone
And I can't face the world
As I choke on reality's sick and twisted game
I see my life and I just can't stand it
As I bear you and the one's you've handled
Where did she go
As you held me in your arms
