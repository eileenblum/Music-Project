That hunting voice
Begins to break free
I must accept what can't be changed
And try to forget the rest
Ignorance, oh the endless fight
For what is really worth
Feel the wrath
Tame it's drive
There's no use in looking back
Just tell me what to do I confess
Unseen is the truth
Binding are the lies
I'll dare escape from my demands
And leave the past behind
Ignorance, oh the endless fight
For what is really worth
Feel the wrath
Tame it's drive
There's no use in going back
Just tell me what to do I confess
The plans laid before me
Are simply not the will of who I used to be
The darkness inside me
That hunting voice that burns inside of me
Ignorance, oh the endless fight
For what is really worth
Feel the wrath
Tame it's drive
There's no use in looking back
Just tell me what to do I confess
