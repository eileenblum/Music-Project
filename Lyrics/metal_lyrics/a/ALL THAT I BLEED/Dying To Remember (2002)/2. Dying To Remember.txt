Time drifts away
The moments gone forever
Tears have all dried up
And a wall of stone took your place
Dreams disappear
Night and day now seems the same
My soul needs a fountain
Your holy love to ease my thirst
Lord I need an answer
I feel a need to know
I remember the silence
The words you never spoke
Dying to remember
Dying
This existence plain and shallow
I need to find my way again
Dying to remember
Dying
This existence plain and shallow
I need to find my way again... again
Fight against the tide of time
There is no use in looking back
Dreams are taken from our hands
As water washes away the sand
Life has made me stronger
Everyday a new game to play
There's no one to blame
I just look at my own self
Life is like an infinite race
No one can take my place... no one.
Apart from everyone
Not in body nor in mind
I saw a man build his kingdom in the sand
Denying the freedom that he could find
Without you everything is black
Without you I could never find
Find the path that leads the way
The way into the Promised Land.
Lord I need an answer
I feel a need to know
I remember the silence
The words you never spoke
Dying to remember
Dying
This existence plain and shallow
I need to find my way again
Dying to remember
Dying
This existence plain and shallow
I need to find my way again
