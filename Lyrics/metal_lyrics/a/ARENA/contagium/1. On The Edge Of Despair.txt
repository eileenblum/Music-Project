Lying there
With spiders in your hair
No one seems to care if you survive
Blood on your face
All over the place
No one seems to care if you live or you die
We're the same you know
Putting up walls and dodging the stones
We're the same you know
Walking in the crowd, but living alone
Don't let this life decay to misery and hate
Don't throw it away
Don't leave it too late
Lying there
On the edge of despair
This is where I should have been
Black and blue
All battered and bruised
This is where I should have been
Lying there
With death in the air
Too young and unprepared for such distress
Hanging on
But not for too long
Too young and unprepared for such distress
We're the same you know
Putting up walls and dodging the stones
We're the same you know
Walking in the crowd, but living alone
Don't let this life decay to misery and hate
Don't throw it away
Don't leave it too late
There will be a time and place
You'll be sure to find me there
Praying that I won't be too late
To take you from the edge of despair
We're the same you know
Putting up walls and dodging the stones
We're the same you know
Walking in the crowd, but living alone
Don't let this life decay to misery and hate
Don't throw it away
Don't leave it too late
