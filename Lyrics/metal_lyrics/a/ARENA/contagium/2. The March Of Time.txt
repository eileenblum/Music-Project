Am I invisible?
Far away from the safety line
And the petty little lives of all mankind
With my eyes closed
And my aching head inclined
Can you see me now?
Keeping in step with the march of time
I write the verse and I find the rhyme
I listen to the rhythm but the heartbeat's mine
I'm singing along to 'One for the Vine'
Can you see me now?
Keeping in step with the march of time
Am I invisible?
Far away from the screaming minds
Waiting for a taste of the blood red wine
Don't look close
You won't like what you find
Can you see me now?
Keeping in step with the march of time
Staying on guard with your powder dry
Got to be quite ready when the missiles fly
Fighting the tide is an clear act of crime
Can you see me now?
Keeping in step with the march of time
Playing all the parts
It hurts when they laugh
But keep that smile spread wide across your face
'Til your head splits in half
Just try to keep the wolves at bay
Let them joke about you
They don't know you well
Never let them see into your mind
They'd go spinning down to hell
Just try to keep the wolves at bay

Don't fight against what they say
'Cos your under attack night and day
One moment of trust could leave you lost and betrayed
Far away from the safety line
And the petty little lives of all mankind
Keeping in step with the march of time
I write the verse and I find the rhyme
I listen to the rhythm but the heartbeat's mine
Keeping in touch with the march of time
Let the days and years erase me
Let life go by, decay the signs, and fade me
Let the days and years erase me
Let life go by, decay the signs, and fade me
Let the days and years erase me
Let life go by, decay the signs,
And fade me from this world
