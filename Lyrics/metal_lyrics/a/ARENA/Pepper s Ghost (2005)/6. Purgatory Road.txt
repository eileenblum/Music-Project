From the first to stand on the fields of Waterloo
Through the two world wars and landing on the moon
The search to find forgiveness and to bury all my shame
Got to let this burden go, got to shoulder all the blame

One day, I will lie down
And rest here forever
Till then my heart beats â heart beats!

I'm here to stay - Till the Martians land on London Town
Won't fade away - Till the science world takes cancer down
I'm here to stay - Till they synthesise the ozone layer
Won't fade away - Going to hold out for an answer to my prayers

They fall at the hands of dark corruption
From saintly deeds to poisonous intentions
Living with remorse on Purgatory Road
Keeping me alive â watch the evil grow

One day, I will lie down
And sleep here

I'm here to stay - Till the Martians land on London Town
Won't fade away - Till the science world takes cancer down
I'm here to stay - Till they synthesise the ozone layer
Won't fade away - Going to hold out for an answer to my prayers

I'm here to stay - Till the Martians land on London Town
Won't fade away - Till the science world takes cancer down
I'm here to stay - Till they synthesise the ozone layer
Won't fade away - Going to follow all my prayers

I'm here to stay - Till humans walk the ocean floor
Won't fade away - Till man can find an end to war
I'm here to stay - Till the polar caps freeze up again
Won't fade away - Going to hold out for an answer to my prayers
