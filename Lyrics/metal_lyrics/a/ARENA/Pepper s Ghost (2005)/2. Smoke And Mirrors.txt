Do you hear the voice?
Shouting down the Midnight Friend
Do you hear the voice?
An empty requiem

Tell me who you are
To treat me like a fool, canât you be
Honest from the start
Explain these tainted rules

Calm me down
A sirenâs crown
Graceful sounds
Ease me round

More than smoke and mirrors
Can't you see me on the stage?
More than misdirection
Don't you let me fade away!

Spinning out your web
You planned to bring me down â Wrong again!
You crawled inside my head
Corrupted what you found â Wrong again!

Lead me on
A sirenâs song
Draw me in
Break my wings

More than smoke and mirrors
Can't you see me on the stage?
More than misdirection
Don't you let me fade away!

More than smoke and mirrors
Can't you see me on the stage?
More than misdirection
Don't you let me fade away!
More than smoke and mirrors
Can't you see me on the stage?
More than misdirection
Don't you let me fade away!
More than smoke and mirrors
Iâm more than smoke and mirrors!
