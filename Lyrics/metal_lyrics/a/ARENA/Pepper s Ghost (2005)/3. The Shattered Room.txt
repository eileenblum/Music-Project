Scooping the moon from a starlit pool
It ripples and breaks into luminous jewels
And shards of light float through the night
Moonbeams of magic shining like eyes

Shooting the breeze as the clouds roll by
A face in the rain and a voice in the sky
Showering wisdom like newly formed pearls
That fall to the ground in this innocent world

Here in this Darkest House - Living with these ancient wounds
Here in this Darkest House - Trapped inside those shattered rooms

So many lies - blighted ambitions
Caught in a race - a certain collision
Stumbling over the paths of depression
Too scared to search for the answers to questions

Lost in this Darkest House â Living with these ancient wounds
Lost in this Darkest House â Trapped inside those shattered rooms

Hide brother hide â Veiled in disguises
Circle of spies - Fighting for the highest prize
Offer a culture - Must now divide them
Melt into every crowd - Bringing our defences down

Lost in this Darkest House - Living with these ancient wounds
Lost in this Darkest House - Trapped inside those shattered rooms

I see the shadow of this lupine condition
Howling in the mountains with a wolverine heart
He's always running from this state of aggression
Given half a chance he can tear you apart
No mercy for you! No sleep for the doomed!

I see the shadow of a vampireâs obsession
Eternity's a curse that will drive him insane
A life of guilt and such violent confession
Donât look away; he'll drain the last drop of blood from your veins

Lost in this Dark House â Watch your back and stay awake
Lost in this Dark House â Sleep would be a cruel mistake
Lost in this Dark House - living with these ancient wounds
Lost in this Dark House - Trapped inside these cold and shattered rooms
Lost in this Darkest House - Lost in this Darkest House
Living with these ancient wounds - Trapped inside these cold and shattered rooms
