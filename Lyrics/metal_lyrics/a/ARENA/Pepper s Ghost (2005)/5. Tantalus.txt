Standing in water, but dying of thirst
This is my thanks and this is my curse
Try as I might, the fruit on the trees
All remain beyond reach, beyond wishes or pleading for
One last chance

Waiting for time to pass me by
Waiting for freedom, waiting to die
Where can I go, in a world without hope?
There is never a place for a soul that has broken so

Trust in no one - Trust in no one

Linking the chains that weigh down your reason
Nothing to blame, but the actions you choose
Driven insane by the conscience of treason
Running in vein from a life of abuse

The closer I get the further I am
The journey I make is the course of the damned
The distance I go is no distance at all
And I climb to the sky but find myself falling so

Trust in no one - Trust in no one

Quench my thirst - Fill my heart
Feed my mind - Don't leave me starving
Hold my hand - stay close by
Talk to me - Don't leave me crying here

Standing in water, yet dying of thirst
This is my thanks and this is my curse
Empty forgiveness for old indiscretions
And such condemnation for just one transgression

Find me now - set me free
Find me now - set me free

Waiting for time to pass me by
Waiting for freedom, waiting to die
Why do you smile at my timeless ordeal here
And why do you laugh at my hopeless appeal for your mercy?

Tear away the chains - Free me now
No one else to blame â Let me go
Tear away the chains - Free me now
Driving me insane â Let me go
Tear away the chains - Free me now
No one else to blame â Let me go
Tear away the chains - Free me now
Driving me insane â Let me go
