Crawling through the poison pool
Hiding eyes with bleeding hands
Every step another fool
Kings and Queens of sand

Over there an angry god
Violent brow and negligence
Making waves that can't be stopped
Unafraid of consequence

Chosen faith's a lottery
Heaven sent down forgeries
Miracles and travesties
Irreligion sows that seed

Staring through the Judas Hole
See what I can see?
Every covenant of souls
Drum roll payments paid to me...

Bethlehem to Bedlam Fayre - No one helps, no one cares!
Let the people mock and stare - See them run around, around, around

This place - So far gone
Darker than hell - A stagnant field of dreams
That face - Speaks to me
So much to say - But nothingâs what it seems
You're only human - Just mortal to me
You're only human â Just an earthbound disease!

Those eyes â Madness reigns
Acid tears â A constant stream of pain
That life â wasted here
Nothing left â No mourners, no name
You're only human - Just mortal to me
You're only human â Just an earthbound disease!

Bethlehem to Bedlam Fayre - No one helps, no one cares!
Let the people mock and stare - See them run around, around, around
Bethlehem to Bedlam Fayre - No one helps, no one cares!
Let the people mock and stare - See them run around, around, around
Bethlehem to Bedlam Fayre - No one helps, no one cares!
Let the people mock and stare - See them run around, around, around
