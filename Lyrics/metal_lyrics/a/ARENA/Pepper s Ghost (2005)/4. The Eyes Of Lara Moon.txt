There in a dream â More than it seems
A Morbid theme - Through the eyes of Lara Moon

Back from the grave â A twilight state
Help came too late - Through the Eyes of Lara Moon

No chance to change - What came before
The senseless rage - Through the Eyes of Lara Moon

And so we wait - Night after night
To share that fate - Through the Eyes of Lara Moon

You saw it coming - But you did nothing
You just kept watching â Through the eyes of Lara Moon

It's hard to fight
When you're struggling for breath
And it's hard to smile
Noble in the face of death
There's no defence
To quell a greater force of will
One desperate flight
But needlessly their blood is spilt

Endure the bleakest days
Light the visions crowding in
Identify the blame
Expose the guilty and the sinners
Vocation holds us here
Even to the end of days
There's no inaction
That will feed the hungry flames

And so we wait - Night after night
To share that fate - Through the Eyes of Lara Moon
Nowhere to hide - Night after night
So dead inside - Through the Eyes of Lara Moon

And so we wait - Night after night
To share that fate - Through the Eyes of Lara Moon
And so we wait - Night after night
So dead inside - Through the Eyes of Lara Moon

Through the Eyes of Lara Moon
