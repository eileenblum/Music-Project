Silently calling 
I hear myself speak 
My breath is in my hands 
I cry out your name 
Silently calling 
I feel so at peace 
And the time to surrender 
Is the time you will take hold of me 
What did you do when you woke today 
What did you feel, were you sad or afraid 
Searching your thoughts 
for reasons or meanings 
And the choices you made 

Silently calling 
In a field of dreams 
Where memories fade 
They keep passing through 
this soulless maze 

What did you do when you woke today 
What did you feel, were you sad or afraid 
Searching your thoughts for hope or relief 
Looking for safety in the falling leaves 

Splinters of virtue 
From splintering hearts 
The door is always closed 
As it was from the start 
Masters of freedom 
Masters of light 
Will you ever let me go 
Take away this second sight 

What did you do when you woke today 
What did you feel, were you sad or afraid 
Searching your thoughts 
for warnings and traps 
Nothing in your life will be the same! 

Hanging to the sail 
Caught behind the storm 
Wait for the waves to come 
Know the fear 
Hide behind your smile 
Crying for mercy 
Hanging to the mast 
Caught behind the storm 
Wait for the sea to foam 
Climb....Climb....Climb up to me 

Hanging to the sail 
Far beyond the storm 
Lightning across the sky 
Catch the rope 
Cling to hope 
Watch as our lives flash by 
Hanging to the mast 
Beyond the storm 
Saltwater burning 
Shield your face from whiplash sprays 
Hold your breath and 
Neptune will make his next move 

Hanging to the rail 
Caught within the storm 
Watch for the jagged land 
Follow a line 
From another time 
Washed up on stone and sand 
Grab the mast 
Caught within the storm 
Reach for a helping hand 
We could share this calm experience now 

In shadows I can see the light 
I whisper your name 
But it's lost in the night 
Watching reflections of my own solitude 

Heartfelt indifference 
towards actions and truths 
In shadows I can see light 
I whisper your name 
In the night 

Spare me from those sirens' lies 
Spare me from this grand illusion 
Spare me from those weeping eyes 
And promises of absolution 

Shall I stand without defense 
Now that death is all around me 
Did you hope for my surrender 
Leaving me to die on the 
bloodstained ground 

It's only a lifetime 
Where heroes need heroic deeds 
It's only a lifetime 
Where children dream of breaking free 
Follow the cause 
Follow the signs 
Drawn by a song to our own demise 
It's only a lifetime 
Dragged across the rocks by the sirens' whisper!
