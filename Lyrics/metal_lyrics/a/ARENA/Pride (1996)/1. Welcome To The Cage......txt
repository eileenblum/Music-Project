No more choices born from freedom 
No more kings and no more kingdom come 
Live in fear of what your doubts are 
You may find all your nightmares 
Knocking down your ivory tower 
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the cage 
Welcome, welcome to the world we made 

Forced apart by blind divisions 
Inspiration, rash decision making 
Ignorance and tears, innocence and early years 
Beware the chaos that will tear apart 
that game you play 

Welcome, welcome, welcome to the cage 
Welcome, welcome to the world we made 
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the cage 
Welcome, welcome to the heart and soul 
that freed the slaves 

When you're forced to the wall 
By the sheer weight of will 
When you're fighting between one another 
Be sure that you know who the prisoners are 
And don't turn against your own brother 

Behind every thought is a far greater plan 
You can feel as the elements gather 
Be sure on which side of the bars you are on 
You will live with your choices 
forever.....forever.....forever! 
Forever........ever.....ever.....ever.....ever.....ever 

Welcome, welcome, welcome to the cage 
Welcome, welcome to the world we made 
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the cage 
Welcome, welcome to the heart and soul 
that freed the slaves 
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the cage 
Welcome, welcome to the world we made 
Welcome, welcome, welcome to the cage 
Welcome, oh, to the shattered world we tried to save 
The spirit that will never fade 
Heart and soul that freed the slaves 
Welcome, welcome to the cage!
