Traitors - Heathens....don't thank me! 
Empires - Princes....don't thank me! 
The fellowship started here 
With bleeding hearts and fine cause 
The brotherhood started here 
With fevered brows - malevolence 
Beaten - Howling....I'll drag you down! 
Kneeling - Cowering....I'll drag you right down! 
Soldiers - Victims....don't thank me! 
Warriors - Pilgrims....don't thank me! 
The fellowship started here 
With righteousness and lunacy 
The covenant started here 
With screaming souls and vitriol 

Can there be comfort left 
For one who lies bleeding in the fields 
Remorse and second thoughts are not enough 
To shield me from the consequence 

Horses - Warcries....Don't thank me! 
Forces - Armies....Don't thank me! 
Dedicate your life to this 
With blood vows and loyalty 
Dedicate your life to me 
With suicide - atrocity 
Onward - Fervent....I'll drag you down! 
Torture - Torment....I'll drag you right down! 

Can there be a heaven still 
For one who lies bleeding in the fields 
A pardon for these actions and passions 
Committed in the name of our salvation 

Innocence of acquaintance or liaison 
The darker side of hunger and need 
We reach a path - 
the way beyond reason 
Now we have sown that nemicidal seed 
And I can count on you to let me bleed 

An act of trust is as fragile as a child 
And we have led as far as we can lead 
We'll make a pact from threats and insecurities 
Things will arise from lies and disagreements 
And I can count on you to let me bleed 

Let the meek lie down! 
For they shall not inherit the earth from me 
Let the meek lie down! 
I will never set your people free 
Take no prisoners! 
For they shall not receive any hope from me 
Take no prisoners! 
I will never set your people free 
Death is the enemy! 
For he waits in the field of blood for me 
Death is the enemy! 
I will never set your people free 
Let the meek lie down! Let the meek lie down! 
Let the meek lie down! Down! 
Let the meek, let the meek lie down!
