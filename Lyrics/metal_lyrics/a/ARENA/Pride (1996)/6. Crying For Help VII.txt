Help me, help me.........help me 
Let us share this hope 
That we may close our eyes in peace 
Follow what may rise from this 
Standing in the halls of grace 
Let my people go 
Was the cry I heard from far away 
I should have known 
Not to trust every word I heard them say 

Help me, help me.........help me 

There's a face I can see 
Staring back in desperation 
Nowhere to turn to now 
Drowning in this sea of fate 
Don't run! Don't hide! 
The devil will find you anywhere 
We should never have lied 
The sin was always there 

Help me, help me.........help me 

This choice must be free 
Answers do not grow on trees 
We must face our enemies 
With faith in one another 
Don't fall down! Don't lie down! 
You can lean on me my friend 
The future may not bring us luck 
But together we can go down fighting! 

Help me, help me.........help me 
Help me, help me.........help me
