It's just a matter of course now 
Like some ritual or formality, 
that's guiding me 
Violent flows the venomous dance 
Chasing through the system in a frenzy 
of enhancement 
Addicted to your belladonna kiss 
I am running in the shadows 
Anonymous, invisible to all the world but you 
How can you be so proud of the 
things you do 

Medusa! Hollow words and promises 
Bow down in servitude before this throne 
Medusa! You always know my weaknesses 

Only with a heart of anger 
Could you freeze the lifeblood in my veins 
Only with a heart of anger 
Could you bleed the strength, 
put out the flame 

Poisoned by your belladonna kiss 
I am trapped in the web 
I am drowning in the bitterness 

and all that I can pray 
Is that I die in your embrace again 

Medusa! Hollow words and promises 
Bow down in servitude before this throne 
Medusa! You always know my weaknesses 
I turn to stone 

All I need is a bloodstained jewel 
Or a poisonous flower 
All I yearn for is the siren's cry 
Or the torment and endurance 
in the final hour 

Medusa! Hollow words and promises 
Bow down in servitude before this throne 
Medusa! You always know my weaknesses 
Oh! I'm paralyzed before this vision 
Medusa! Hollow words and promises 
Bow down in servitude before this throne 
Medusa! You always know my weaknesses 
I turn to stone 

Addicted to your belladonna kiss 
I am running in the shadows 
Anonymous, invisible
