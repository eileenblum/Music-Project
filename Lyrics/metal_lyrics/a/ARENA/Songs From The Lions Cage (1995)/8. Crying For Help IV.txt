Who makes these choices 
Who waves the final hand 
When wisdom is more than 
age or reason 
Who makes these choices 
Who makes the final stand 
When solitude is all 
that you believe 
It's all the same 
And you really should have known 
It's all the same 
When your heart grows cold 
and you're all alone 
This has no name 
This feeling that I used to know 
It's here again 
I can see the tortured souls 
as they cry for help 
Take my hand 
I'll lead you through the 
traps and snares 
Take my hand 
I'll feed you and I'll clothe you like 
My only child 
There is nothing left to fear 
My only child 
There is nothing left 
to hurt you now! 

Who makes these choices 
Who waves the final hand 
When all around 
I hear the sound 
Of pleading for a helping hand 
Who makes those choices 
Who makes the final stand 
When far away I hear them say 
They couldn't give a damn.... 
Give a damn! 

They're crying for help.... 
Help me! 
They're crying for help... 
Help me! 
They're crying for help... 
Help me! 
They're crying for help... 
Help me!
