Soon there will come a time 
Whether a life like mine 
Reaches you 
Touches you 
Under a cloud of fear 
No longer need me here 
Feeling secure 
Part of the cause 

Dramatic setting for 
Friendship is not so pure 
Innocence...influence 

Now we have come so far 
Etched on my mind unsure 
Commonsense...Confidence 

Far reaching consequence 
Born from indifference 
Leave me here now 

Forgotten with pretence 
Forward and sufferance 
Leave me here now? 

When the time was right 
And the signs were clear 
I should have known 
But I didn't hear the warning 
......The calling! 

When the moment came 
And the lonliness 
Was falling in 
I couldn't find a reason 
....I stopped believing 

Once more to the breach 
There's nothing left to teach 
me now ....Now! 

Stand up and be counted 
No more time for doubt, 
stand up 
Stand up! 

Was it empathy or apathy  we shared 
There's no understanding 
When honesty's not there 

No hand me down excuses 
Insincerity too far 
Are brave enough 
or strong enough 
when truths are told in halves 

Now its obvious 
It's so obvious to me 
Now its obvious 
In this wilderness you'll see 
That hollow words are reckless 
Allies souls can move apart 
Surface wounds infectious 
Through to your Achilles heart. 

"Forgive them, for they know 
not what they do" 
What is forgiveness? 
Who grants forgiveness? 
Who gives a damn? 

I'm breaking out of this wilderness 
I turn my back on all the 
make believe and promises 
A soldier of fortune 
I fell once before 
But I live again! 
I'm part of this once more! 

I'm breaking out of this  wilderness 
I've cut my way through all 
the sympathy and tenderness 
A soldier of fortune 
I fell once before 
But I live again! 
I'm part of this once more!
