Desperation on your own 
Let the kindred spirits go 
Keep on building, stone on stone 
Never fail, never doubt 
Stands alone, stone on stone 
I shall lie within this shrine.... 
Waiting for ten thousand years 
Free from preconceived ideas 
Isolated, hibernating 
Sleeping through the age of man 
Darkest hour before the dawn 
Patiently, silently 
Hanging on a single hope 
Clinging to a fragile rope 
Desperation, preservation 
Keeping the faith 
Too much at stake 
Do what the Gods say... 

Every day the idea grows 
Money is no object so 
Keep on building, stone on stone 
Let the temple reach the clouds 
Stands alone, stone on stone 
Working on the grandest scale 
How could worshipped idols fail 

What is mine is mine you know 
Rights are not for you and so 
Keep on building, 
Stone on stone 
Make it strong 
and make it proud 
Stands alone stone on stone 
In this glory lies the key 
Mine is immortality 

Untold wealth hidden with care 
by stealthy people 
Promised riches stored in haste 
by urgent people 
Sworn on the good book, hard look, 
hardly a whisper away 
Sworn on the new faith, keepsake, 
keeping a distance away 

Jewels lie thick, as far as the eye 
As far as the eye can barely see 
Elegant crystal, the wishful 
Dragged through the sands of time for me 
Born from resistance, innocence 
Into the darkness the blind will be thrown 
Born from acceptance, vehemence 
Venomous promises innocent foes 
You will all hear me, all fear me 
Standing in line with your faith at your feet 
Do what your will has and fight back 
Come meet your maker, Your saviour! 

One man, fate unknown 
Born of stone on stone 
One flame lights the fire 
Dawn of stone on stone 
My faith will stand up alone 
Your light enriching the sacred stone 
One man, fate unknown 
Born of stone on stone
