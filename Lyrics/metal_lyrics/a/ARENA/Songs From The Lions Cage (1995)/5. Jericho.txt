Forget the lights 
Forget the sounds 
You no longer need me round 
Lost my patience 
Lost my pride 
The story of my life 
Innocence is no way to hide 
Forget the light 
Forget the sound 
Why do you have to drag me down 
Men of night, In disguise 
Slay this barren child 
Sadness is your only friend 

"Please forgive me 
I didn't mean to 
play with your emotions 
Tear apart your passions 
Please forgive me 
I didn't mean to 
Hurt you with false meanings 
Hurt you with false feelings" 

Is what you see 
Is what you get 
Overhearing distant sounds 
Is what you wish 
Is what you hope 
Given both ends of the rope 
Both ends of the rope? 

When you turn against the system 
and the rules that are taught 
The true unconscious law 
an action without thought 

To free yourself forever from the shackles and the chains 
Of any kind of hell 
You can call this need by any other name 

When you stay held down for most of your life 
It's not hard to find a cause 
It's the catalyst behind the knife... the knife! 

Gonna turn the tide against you 
Gonna make this private revolution 
Gonna smash the gates and march right through 
Gonna tear apart this institution 
I'm coming down to find you 
Gonna make this private revolution 
Better keep this faith behind you 
Gonna lead the way to new solutions. 

Jericho - I'll bring those walls right down on you! 
Jericho - I'll bring those walls right down on you! 

Gonna turn the tide against you 
Gonna make this private revolution 
Gonna smash the gates and march right through 
Gonna make this private revolution 

Jericho - I'll bring those walls right down on you! 
Jericho - I'll bring those walls right down on you!
