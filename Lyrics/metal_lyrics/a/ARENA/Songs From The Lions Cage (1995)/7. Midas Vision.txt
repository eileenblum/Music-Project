Creeping out into the night 
Keep your hands outstretched and 
your eyes closed tightly 
Running out on your own 
Don't answer the door or the telephone 
This is no kind of a dream 
Not a blessing but a curse 
This is no illusion 
You've had them before - 
this isn't the first 
Reaching out - so cold! 
What did I say - did I do 
To lose my hold on you 

Everything you touch 
With your finger tips - 
Hurts so much 
There's a fallen wish 
it's shattered on the ground 
like a broken gift 
The Midas Vision 
Was always beating in your heart 
The foolish greed, the golden seed 
Is dragging out of the reason 
and tearing you apart! 

Reaching out - so cold! 
What did I say - did I do 
To lose my hold on you? 
Reaching out with 
all that I could give 
What should I say - should I do 
To make you.... 

Holding out, holding out your hands 
Open up, open up your eyes 
Is that the knock 
or the ringing of the bell 
Open the door 
to your own private hell. 

Reaching out - so cold! 
What did I say - did I do 
To lose my hold on you? 
Reaching out 
with all that I could give 
What should I say - should I do 
To make you live again? 

Reaching out - so cold! 
What did I say - did I do 
To lose my hold on you? 
Reaching out 
with all that I could give 
What should I say - should I do 
to make you live again?
