In the distance 
Hidden from sight - patiently 
Waiting for me 
Part of the night - enemy mine 
This horizon 
Darkness and light - opposites 
Drawn together, one forever 
Wrong and the right - enemy mine 
Now is the time to decide...... 
Don't answer me with the same old questions 
Don't patronise with those tired old solutions 
I've heard these before, I've been here before 
Don't pay me back with the same old deceptions 
Don't give me facts and predictable suggestions 
I've heard these before, I've been here before 
Then you're screaming all the time 
You don't listen any more 
When you threw out the hope with the dustbin liners 
You were standing alone with your coat of kindness 
Covered in mud - it was soaked in my blood 
When you fed me to the lions 
in your personal arena 
And you watched till the cries 
and the prayers grew weaker 
Head in my hands - Dripping tears in the sand 
The roar of the lions 
As the victim lies damned and alone....... 

When agony comes 
more from hope than failure 
Look further than your preconceptions, 
expectations 
Where the power of the mind can 
take you out beyond this reach 
Higher than the dull 
and simple world you know so well 
Back to paradise....... 
Who keeps the child - Tell 
me which is the mother? 
The need in her eye, 
and the eyes of the other 
and I've seen this before, 
I've been here before 
Cut the child in half, 
give a piece to each woman 
A desperate chance, 
the last hope has fallen 
Just like before, 
I've felt this before 
And the gurgles of laughter 
Are echoes once more in my heart 

So I lie down in my mothers arms 
And I cry in my mothers arms, praying 
Praying for the end to come..... 
A friend to come and rescue me - right now 
So I listen to my mother's voice 
And I listen to the 
Only choice she had to make 
Living fear cold and naked 
Throw me away? Don't throw me away 
"Take the child - it's yours!" 
Was the only thing she could have said..... 

Does it matter to you? 
In the lion's cage we're all the same 
Does it matter to you? 
It's a child's game with a child's name 
Does it matter to you? 
If I place the blame upon your shoulders 
Don't try to fool the world 
Don't try to rule the world again..... 

Throw away my life in the fireplace 
With the old love letters 
And the Nottingham laces; 
Trying to forget the warm embraces 
Video suppers and the funny faces 
Does it matter to you? 
Does it matter to you? 
Does it matter to you? 
Does it matter at all?
