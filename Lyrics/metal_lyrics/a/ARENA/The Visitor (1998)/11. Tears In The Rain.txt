This is a clown's tale 
Falling over 
Again and again 
He paints his face 
With colours from the sun 
But he is living in the rain 
This is a clown's tale 
Jumping up 
Spinning round and around 
He kicks his heels 
To the laughter of the crowd 
But from inside there is no sound 

Why do we all fail to see 
The darkness in another's heart 
Why do we all turn our backs 
On open wounds 
And failed attractions 
Painted on the canvas there 
Written in the books we share 

This is a fool's tale 
Rolling over 
Again and again 
Telling jokes 
To cool the anger of a king 
But he can never be the same 

This is a fool's tale 
Tripping up 
Spinning round and around 
Try to walk 
Beyond words of the wise 
Then reach a place too high 
Show them you can fly 
And dream until you hit the ground.... 

Don't offer sympathy 
When you've just walked away 
Don't play apologies 
And sentimental games 
I stood before the world 
And gave you my heart 
And it may never beat again! 

Don't give me hollow tears 
Or empty cries of shame 
Don't try to turn away 
By throwing me the blame 
I stood before the world 
And gave you my soul 
And now I'm living in the rain! 

This is a clown's tale 
Falling over 
Again and again 
He paints his face 
With colours from the sun 
But he is lying in.... 
He is dying in.... 
He is crying in the rain
