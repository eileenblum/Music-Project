Lying here 
Can't even feel the cold 
Just a tingle in my spine 
A bitter line of hope 
Lying here 
Can't even see the sky 
Just a tingle in my fingers 
A shiver in my soul 

Don't walk towards the light 
Still got those pins and needles 
Turn back, embrace the night 
Am I ready to be judged like this? 

Lying here 
Can't even turn my head 
Just a tingle in my feet 
A shimmering before my eyes 

Lying here 
Can't even touch my face 
Just a tingle in my throat 
A living moment, isolated 

Don't walk towards the light 
Still got those pins and needles 
Turn back, embrace the night 
I'm not ready to be taken yet 

Don't walk towards the light 
Still got those pins and needles 
Turn back and hold the night 
I'm not ready to be taken yet 

This is not my time 
I'm not ready yet 
I'm not ready........after all
