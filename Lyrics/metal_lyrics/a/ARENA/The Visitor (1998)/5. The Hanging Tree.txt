Walk along the waterfall 
Watching as the world turns red 
Wonder where the river flows 
And the blood on the river bed 
Poison lies too close to us 
Reach across the salt and sand 
Moving deeper into the land 
Following the waterfall 
Watching as the world turns green 
Wonder where the river flows 
The copper face remains unseen 
Ignorance has failed to cleanse 
Reach across the salt and sand 
Moving deeper into the land 

Crying as the earth cries out 
Weeping as the land decays 
Wonder if I could have helped 
Maybe I'd have found a way 
Poison lies too close to us 
Reach across the salt and sand 
Moving deeper into the land 

Cling to the branch of a tree 
That was waiting for 
Something to preach 
Someone to teach 
The Word was the first 
And the last to be heard 
From the branch of the tree 
It was praying for me to fall down 

Climb to the top of a tree 
That was waiting for 
Someone to warn 
A life to be torn into 
Pieces of gold 
For a soul to be sold 
And the heart of the tree 
Was crying for me to come back 

Take me to the hanging tree 
There's a man in the light 
And he's pointing at me 
Guide me to the hanging tree 
It's the place that I come from 
Walk along the waterline 
Reach across the salt and the sand 
Moving deeper into the land 

Take me to the hanging tree 
There's a boy in the light 
And he's staring at me 
Take me to the hanging tree 
It's the place that I come from 
Walk along the waterline 
Reach across the salt and the sand 
Moving deeper into the land 
I'm falling.....Falling down again!
