I've seen that face before 
Demon eyes watch what an Angel once saw 
I've seen that face before 
Lying in shadows but hard to ignore 
No where to run 
No where to hide 

I've seen this place before 
A wilderness born from the torment of souls 
(Yes!) I've seen this place before 
A memory lost as the story unfolds 

No where to run 
No where to hide 
No where to run 
No where to hide 

...."I will always find you!" 

We played this game before 
Counting no cost but keeping the score 
(Yes!) We played this game before 
Eyes to the front and backs to the wall 

I've stood right here before
