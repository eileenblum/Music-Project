There's a light behind the veil 
And it's calling to me 
There's a force behind the veil 
And it's waiting for me 
There's a hand 
Reaching out 
Holding on 
Won't let go! 
I defy you to stand 
On the crack in the ice 
With the power of your hand 
On the crack in the ice 

Rising, rising 
I can feel your hands upon me 
I can feel your arms around me 
Rising, rising 
I can feel a breath inside me 
I can feel a warmth inside me 
Rising, rising 
I can feel your hands upon me 
I can feel your arms around me 
Rising, rising 
I can feel a breath inside me 
I can feel my heart begin to burn 

"Open your eyes" 
I can hear the Visitor! 
Shaking me 
Rousing me 
Waking me 
"Open your eyes" 
I can hear the Visitor 
Warning me 
Rousing me 
Calling my name 

"Open your eyes 
Open your eyes now!"
