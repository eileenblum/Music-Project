Dead calm 
Raining all over me 
Too late 
Sense of mortality 
Dark skies 
Threaten to swallow me 
Down to the flame 
While my flesh and my bone melt away 
I defy you to stand on the crack in the ice 
With the power of your hand 
On the crack in the ice 

Men 
Raped and discarded 
Are left dead 
The vultures will feed on them 
Lost cause 
Tearing this life apart 
Thrown to the flame 
While my flesh and my bone melt away 

I defy you to stand on the crack in the ice 
With the power of your hand 
On the crack in the ice 

Take this moment so close to my heart 
You held the white rose out 
Just before we parted 
Take this moment so far away in dreams 
I can feel the thorns bite 
But the flower died, it seems 

Hold this feeling so close to my heart 
You brought the passion out 
Just before we parted 
Hold this feeling so far away in dreams 
I can feel the thorns bite 
But the flower starts to bleed 

I defy you to stand on the crack in the ice 
With the power of your hand 
On the crack in the ice
