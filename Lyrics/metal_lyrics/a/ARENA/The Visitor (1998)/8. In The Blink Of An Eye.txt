Why should all the wise survive 
When nothing is what it may seem? 
Why do all the living die 
When only the dying remain? 
Helpless are the broken wishes 
Dashed upon the window pane 
So close! But I'm one step ahead 
My shadow is all you will touch 
Too late! You waited too long 
I stole the freedom 
You needed so much 

Do you hide away from me? 
There's nothing here you should ignore 
Do you close your eyes on me? 
You've made that mistake once before 
Helpless are the shattered wishes 
Dashed upon the window pane 

So close! But I'm one step ahead 
My shadow is all you will touch 
Too late! You waited too long 
I stole the freedom 
You needed so much 

Search far, search wide 
Lying down is not a matter of pride 
Look hard, look deep 
Never try to take this line of retreat 
Don't let the bastards grind you down 

So close! But I'm one step ahead 
My shadow is all you will touch 
Too late! You waited too long 
I stole the freedom you needed so much 
So close! But I'm one step ahead 
My shadow is all you will touch 
Too late! You waited too long 
I stole the freedom 
I know that you needed so much
