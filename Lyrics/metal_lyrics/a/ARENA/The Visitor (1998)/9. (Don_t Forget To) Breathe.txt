Half heard cries in the night 
Bolt the door, put out the light 
The clock just stopped, time goes slow 
Listen to my voice on the telephone 
Fine prayers, sweet dreams 
Don't forget to breathe, my friend 
You're not the only one 
To look me in the eyes again 

Half heard screams in the night 
The man's down deep 'cos he died of fright 
There's a dog bite - Flash light 
Throw him in the room with the clues and the dynamite 

Fine prayers sweet dreams 
Don't forget to breathe, my friend 
You're not the only one 
To look me in the eyes again 

You saw! You saw! 
A figure in the fog with razor claws 
You saw! You saw! 
A devil in the dark, we've met before 

Fine prayers, sweet dreams 
Don't forget to breathe, my friend 
You're not the only one 
To look me in the eyes again 

Half seen shadows in the night 
Burning hands and tortured sight 
All the children of the storm are waiting 
Half seen shadows in the night 
Blood red rooms and fire light 
All the children of the storm are waiting 

And as you stand glued to the line 
Your heart just stopped 
And now you're mine! 

Don't run away
