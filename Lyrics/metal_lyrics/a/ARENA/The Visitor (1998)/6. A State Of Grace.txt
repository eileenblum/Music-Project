Thinly veiled, a cruel disguise 
Vengeance lies behind these eyes 
Glaring from the pulpit 
As the Fallen Angels follow me 
Plageristic sermons 
Hiding voyeuristic undertones 
Foolishly they will embrace 
And ignorant they follow me 
You've never truly known 
The kind of place that I come from 
You turned your back on all the signs 
That bore the words of warning 

Come to me my simple child 
Tear apart your innocence 
Pray with me beloved son 
And I will help you find a way 
Think before you throw yourself 
Upon the tables and the merchant s 
Are you sure this temple 
Isn't just another cruel perversion? 

You've never truly known 
The kind of place that I come from 
You turned your back on all the signs 
That bore the words of warning 

Don't look for comfort in this house of mine 
Don't ask for mercy at my image or my shrine 
Don't seek forgiveness at this house of mine 
Don't build a temple here 
And wait for me to walk into the fire 

I will make this promise now 
A simple thing, a sacred vow 
Come with me my pretty Angel 
I will show you how to fly 
We will fall together 
Into unforgiving night we plunge! 
Chained by sin and clothed by guilt 
We will be as one forever 

Don't look for comfort in this house of mine 
Don't ask for mercy at my image or my shrine 
Don't look for comfort in this house of mine 
Don't break the Holy bread or drink the Holy wine 
Don't seek forgiveness at this house of mine 
Don't build a temple here 
And wait for me to walk into the fire
