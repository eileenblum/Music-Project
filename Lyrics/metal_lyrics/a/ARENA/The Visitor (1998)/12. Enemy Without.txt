Something on the edge of this place 
Something on the edge of my mind 
Getting closer to me 
Growing stronger in me all the time 
The young foretell a life ahead 
The old look back on a life that's been led 
But I - I see nothing 
Got too much sand across my head 
Sit there waiting for the phone to ring 
Hopes in the attic, tied up with string 
On a top shelf, bottom drawer 
Any place I could ignore 
The falling of this hero 

No! Don't let the child die here 
Don't let the child die here 
Don't let his life just fade away 
Don't let the child die.... 

I made a promise - my soul laid bare 
Signed and sealed on a wing, on a prayer 
But thrown to the darkness 
It lies beyond repair 
This solemn oath I swore to you 
Has been neglected and unused 
In a back room, not on show 
Anywhere just not to know 
The falling of this hero 

No! Don't let the child die here 
Don't let the child die here 
Don't let his life just fade away 
Don't let the child die.... 

I let the orphan fall, tears remained unseen 
I let the child die on signal fifteen 
I missed the vital signs and all of the meanings 

You cannot judge me 
That's not your place 
There's a jury for the crime's of my disgrace 
You hide behind those vacant words 
Have you seen what I've seen? 
Have you heard what I've heard? 

You cannot judge me 
That's not your right 
This is my room, no key, no light 
You stand behind those faithless words 
Have you seen what I've seen? 
Have you heard what I've heard? 

No! Don't let the child die here 
Don't let the child die here 
Don't let his life just fade away 
Don't let the child die here 

Don't let the child die here 
Don't let the child die here 
Don't let his life just fade away 
Don't let the child die here 

Don't let the child die here 
Don't let the child die here 
Don't let his life just fade away 
Don't let the child die
