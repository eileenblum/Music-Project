Look for me here 
It's blacker than the night 
Look for me here 
But don't throw me in the light 
Keep me on the inside 
A part of the team 
Keep me on the inside 
I don't care what that means 
Oh - Like the ghost in the Firewall 
Oh - Like a virus in the system 
Oh - Like the ghost in the Firewall 
Let me in 
Let me fade away 

Look for me here 
My name is Legion 
Look for me here 
We are many - we are one 
Keep me on the inside 
Lost in the crowd 
Keep me on the inside 
Don't try to force me out 

Oh - Like the ghost in the Firewall 
Oh - Like a virus in the system 
Oh - Like the ghost in the Firewall 
Let me in 
Let me fade away 
Let me in 
Let me fade away 
Let me fade away
