He waits in the dark for lives, misguided and wrecked 
The catcher of innocent souls 
He's proud of his human collection 
Of losers who give up the chase 
Of winners who fail to look round 
He creeps up behind the fallen and blind 
They're gone! With hardly a sound 
'Save me - somebody reach out a hand 
Save me from eternity caught in the grip of 
The Butterfly Man' 

He waits in the dark for the scent of anger or hate 
He hides behind ignorance 
And it's never for long that he has to wait 
A gentle caress 
Is enough before fear takes a hold 
The warning signs come far too late 
By then he'll have captured your soul 

'Save me - somebody reach out a hand 
Save me from the agony caught in the grip of 
The Butterfly Man' 

'Save me - somebody reach out a hand 
Save me from eternity caught in the grip of 
The Butterfly Man' 

'I've been here for so long 
Don't even know what my purpose ever was 
I don't even know where I belong 
Through the years I've been waiting 
Even time has lost it's meaning 
Don't even know where I belong' 

'Can't ever turn from this path 
Don't even know what alternatives there are 
Perhaps I wandered too far 
I've been here for so long 
Don't even hope for an end to all of this 
I have no choice, but to carry on' 

There you are fighting to escape from the womb 
Dying in the snares of your chosen beliefs 
Were you not set free far too soon? 
There you are bathing in the warmth of creation 
Drowning in the blood of your chosen beliefs 
Prisoners of fate 
Living in a state of sedation 

'Save me - somebody reach out a hand 
'Save me - somebody reach out a hand 
Save me from eternity caught in the grip of 
The Butterfly Man' 

He waits in the dark 
The catcher of elegant souls 
Extravagant souls 
Belligerent souls 

He waits in the dark 
His arms open wide 
Never too short 
Never too tall 
He'll take them all
