Many times this world has been my playground 
An endless field of images, not too profound 
I let you read between the lines, if you think you can 
Part of someone's grand design of 
Sainthood, childhood....Slipping through our fingers.... 
There it is in black and white for you to shout out loud 
But all those empty promises just sow more seeds of doubt 
Let my vision smother you in heartache 
It freezes like the venom from a rattlesnake 

It really doesn't matter now, the end will be the same 
It really doesn't matter how the world will rise again 
There's nothing you can do to stop the river flowing blood 
The betting man has played his hand 
He's waiting.....waiting 

Look for me in everything material 
live and breathe philosophy and spiritual escape 
You'll find me in the films and in the theatres 
Through the minds of novelists and orators 

It really doesn't matter now, the end will be the same 
It really doesn't matter how the world will rise again 
There's nothing you can do to stop the river flowing blood 
The betting man has played his hand 
He's waiting for the flood 

You walked with me before, you know 
We crossed this land before, you know 
You talked with me before, you know 
You held my hand before, you know 

It really doesn't matter now, the end will be the same 
It really doesn't matter how the world will rise again 
There's nothing you can do to stop the river flowing blood 
The betting man has played and we're just 
Waiting for the flood 
You followed me too far and it's too late to turn around 
You followed me too far to stop the world from being drowned 
There's nothing you can do to stop the river flowing blood 
The betting man has played and we're just 
Waiting for the flood
