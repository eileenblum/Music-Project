What I dream tonight may rest with me 
Till morning comes again 
From the truth comes light 
We're vulnerable, as we shelter from the rain 
This is a place where all I touch 
May not be as it seems 
When I close my eyes I pray that you 
May shield me from this pain 
Hidden from my sight 
So dangerous, as we shelter from the rain 
This is a place where all I touch 
May not be as it seems 
And still we go on waiting for Friday's Dream 

It's a world that's far away 
From the sound of people calling 
'free me from these chains' 
It's a moment of escape 
As the blood of fallen angels scars the earth 
Tearing at the innocent once more 

What I dream tonight may rest with me 
Till morning comes again 
Weakened by our doubts 
We cling to this as we shelter from the rain 

It's a world that's far away 
From the sound of people calling 
'free me from these chains' 
It's a moment of escape 
As the blood of fallen angels scars the earth 
Tearing at the innocent once more 
It's a world that's far away 
From the sound of people calling 
'free me from these chains' 
It's a moment of escape 
As the blood of fallen angels scars the earth 
Burns the earth 
Tearing at the innocent once more 

When I close my eyes I pray we'll find 
A shelter from the rain 
What I dream tonight may rest with me 
Till morning comes 
Till morning comes and I wake up
