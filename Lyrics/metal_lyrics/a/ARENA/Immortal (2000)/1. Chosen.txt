Take a leap of faith if you want to find out! 
We live amongst you 
In the guise of the mortal men 
You'll never see us in the crowd 
We only look towards 
What purpose we've been sent 
And wait until the time is now 

Take a leap of faith if you want to find out 
Better hold on tight if you want to know how 
Take a leap of faith if you want to find out 
You have been chosen! 

Imagine you can tell us all apart 
From prophecy or old wives tales 
Or from the warnings of a singular birthmark 
But these are merely all false trails 

Wisdom spat from the whirling chair 
Shaking the bars when they stop and stare at me 

Take a leap of faith if you want to find out 
Better hold on tight if you want to know how 
Take a leap of faith if you want to find out 
You have been chosen....Now! 

The faceless followers knelt in prayer 
Near Whited sepulchres and lightly coded software 

Freedom of speech - But we have no voice 
Freedom of spirit - But we have no choice 
Given no help - To meet these demands 
Given no help - It's out of our hands 

Never turn around never look behind 
Got to turn the water into wine 

Take a leap of faith if you want to find out 
Better hold on tight if you want to know how 
Take a leap of faith if you want to find out 
You have been chosen....Now!
