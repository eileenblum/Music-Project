I can see the other side 
Keeping my head bowed down 
I can see them all around 
Dead staring eyes 
Donning their Ascension robes 
Waiting for the time 
Shouting down below 
'I told you once before - I told you so!' 
Got to build a tower 
Need a better line of sight 
We're climbing up the net 
We're reaching for the sky 
Got to keep on rising 
Take a ray of burning light 
We're climbing up the net - through the sky 

I can see the other side 
Try to keep a hold 
Take the rollercoaster ride 
On some binary code 
Speaking in a single tongue 
Think a single thought 
Touching everyone 
Reaching out - we've been here before 

Do I join in the race, keep my enemies near? 
Am I forced to embrace this modern veneer? 
Will I ever break free from this house of cards? 
The truth is the victim - it was dead from the start! 

Got to keep on rising 
Take a ray of burning light 
Got to keep on rising 
We're climbing - We're climbing up the net 
We're climbing - We're reaching for the sky 
We're climbing - We're climbing up the net 
We're climbing - We're reaching for the sky 
We're climbing up the net 
A ray of burning light 
A better line of sight 
We're reaching for the sky 
We're climbing up the net 
A ray of burning light 
A better line of sight 
We're reaching for the sky
