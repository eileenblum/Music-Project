This moment seemed so far away
A thousand long lost yesterdays
Floating down an endless stream
Of seconds, minutes, hours and weeks

We search for clues, we work we strive
To find a meaning in our lives
But when it's all been said and done
The end is the same for everyone

And yet as I cross this great divide
I finally see the other side
The sum of what I came to be
My genuine identity

But does it really matter now
Something we should care about?
Perhaps it has no meaning here
Perhaps it has no meaning here
