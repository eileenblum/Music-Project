Leaving here is hard to do
Every time I think of you
All my plans, my secret schemes
Failed to meet my hopes and dreams
You will never know
Just how far I had to go
You could never guess
And now it's far too late to confess

Take a serious look at how this works
Do you stand in line or push 'til it hurts
There s an end design you can put to bed
It's easy it's simple
Like everybody said

But the tick and the tock of the cosmic clock
It hammers in your head
The tick and the tock of the cosmic clock
It hammers in your head
Hammers in your head

You could sneak it in like a back door pilot
Sell it as a classic or a late night high
Don't let the final plan go dead
It's easy, it's simple
Like everybody said

I thought there would be more time
Plenty of time to go I thought there would be more time
But fate said no no no!

And the tick and the tock of the cosmic clock
It hammers in your head
The tick and the tock of the cosmic clock
It hammers in your head
Hammers in your head

Leaving here is hard to do
Every time I think of you
All my plans, my secrets schemes
Failed to meet my hopes and dreams
You will never know
Just how far I had to go
You could never guess
And now it 's far too late to confess
