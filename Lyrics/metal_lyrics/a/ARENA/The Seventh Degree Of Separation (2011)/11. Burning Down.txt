So this house is now on fire.
Let me warm myself
The flames no longer burn me.
There's no danger to my health

I can see the falling cinders,
Making ghosts upon the ground
This place is the story of my life,
And I see it, I see it burning down!

Not much time left now, before my final bow
I'll let the fires rage, so I can clear the stage
I need to purify if I am going to rise
Into a different place
Into a different state

This place is the story of my life,
And I see it, I see it burning down!

Not much time left now before my final bow
So I must clear my head on any doubt or dread
I need to sanitise if I am going to rise
Into a different place
Into a different state

All signs are gone now of my previous existence
All signs are gone now of my relevance significance of worth

When this fire is truly over,
There is nothing to be found
This place is the story of my life,
And I see it, I see it burning down!

All signs are gone now of my previous existence
All signs are gone now of my relevance significance of worth
All signs are gone now of my tedious existence
All signs are gone now of my innocence my childhood or my birth
All signs are gone now of my previous existence
All signs are gone now of my presence here or consequence on earth
