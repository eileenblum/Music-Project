Throw me on that bed of nails
Every spike another tale of
Thoughtless voices
All the roads they lead to here
What l made of all the years
Reckless choices

This is my show
It 's all that I know
The sum of my actions
A life as it flows
Don't read my mind
You'd hate what you find
Those short cut solutions
The trail of the cruel and the kind

See those nails
Every spike another tale of wrong intentions
All mistakes were mine to make
No one else is here to blame self-deceptions

This is my show
It's all that I know
The sum of my actions
A life as it flows
Don't read my mind
You'd hate what you find
Those short cut solutions
The trail of the cruel and the kind

Grieve for me
But don't try to bring me back now
Weep for me
But don't try to bring me back
Remember me
And I can live on forever
Remember me
And l can leave on in you

Baggage that l throw away
Clean the slate and start again
Now is my finest illusion
How will they remember me?
Was I everything I seemed witness my finest illusion
Throw me on that bed of nails
Every spike another tale
Throw me on that bed of nails
Every spike another tale

Grieve for me
But don't try to bring me back now
Weep for me
But don't try to bring me back
Remember me
And I can live on forever
Remember me
And l can leave on in you

This is my show
It 's all that I know
The sum of my actions
A life as it flows
This is my show
