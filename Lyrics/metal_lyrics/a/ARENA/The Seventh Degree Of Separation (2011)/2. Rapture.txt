I always wondered how my destiny would go
Taken by the ocean, abducted by a UFO
Caught in a field with a crowd of devotees
Waiting for the final judgement!

No repentance here
Don't try to feed my fear
By now you should have learnt
I'll leave on my own terms!

I always wondered how my story would resolve
A strong defiant gesture
Resolute and bold
Not lying here in shit
Corrupted by disease
Waiting for the final judgement!

No repentance here
Don't try to feed my fear
By now you should have learnt
I'll leave on my own fucking terms!

Don't tell me what you think I should believe
Don't tell me what you think I should believe
Don't you sow those dark prophetic seeds
Watch them grow into hysterical screams

No repentance here
Don't try to feed my fear
(Can you hear me? Can anybody hear me)
By now you should have learn I'll leave on my own terms!
(Can you hear me? Can anybody hear me)

So now I'm ready to accept what comes
There is no rapture here so
I must take this final journey
I must walk alone

No repentance here
Don't try to feed my fear
By now you should have learnt
I'll leave on my own terms!
