Gathered here
Drowning in their
Angry tears
Why do they not
Understand
Why do they not comprehend?

Torn from the world by some dark fate
Suddenly no one can hear what they say

Cry for them
Sometimes life is not fair
Mourn for them
Sometimes life is not fair

Pity these creatures of twilight
Walking the earth and yet lost from its sight

Cry for them
Sometimes death is not fair
Mourn for them
Sometimes death is not fair

Prisoners of their unfulfilled ambitions for life

Nothing left but empty shells
Bitter shreds of living selves
Torn from the world by some dark fate
Suddenly no one can hear what they say...
Silent and grey

There they stay
Watch them fade away
As the thief of souls
Lets their hearts decay

Anchored to the earth they haunt us
Shackled by their rage they haunt us
There they stay
Watch them fade away
As the thief of souls
Lets their hearts decay
There they stay
Watch them fade away
Thief of souls
Thief of souls
