It all began with a single spark
The universe the world and me
That spark, it's still there, the source of living things
The source of this eternity

I saw the little people working there
In the echoes and the chambers of my mind
And I saw the lantern man as he stood so still
And the child knew this gentle soul, his kindness

The light went on and he was gone
But the meaning, the meaning still remained
Like the fading away of a sweet familiar taste
Like the cleasing of the cool summer rain

I was a child then
I never understood
I was a child then
But I knew more than I should
We are innocent
We are ignorant
We are a spark from the tinderbox
The element
The miracle

I had no time for the hand on my shoulder
I had no time for the voices in my head
I didn't even notice when the room grew even colder
This was no sleight of hand this was no silver thread

If there's magic in this show, it is greater than we think
They tried to tell me once, to decide what I should think
I am free now
I am free

With age brings a blindness of the spirit and the soul
If only you were here now I could finally tell you

I know I know!
We are children
We could never understand
We are dancers, we are actors we are players in the sand
We are children
We could never understand
We are part of this arena;
We are part of this band
We're a spark from the tinderbox
We're a spark from the tinderbox
