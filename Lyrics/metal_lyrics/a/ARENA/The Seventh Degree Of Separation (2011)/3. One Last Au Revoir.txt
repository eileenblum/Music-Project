Tapping the table fourteen times
Setting the cutlery down in line
Don't leave the house 'til the gas is checked
And checked and checked and checked and checked

Keeping those curtains tightly shut
Or I'll be back to close them up
In the middle of the night middle of the night
Just to sanitise my mind
Then I stop for a moment
Time to question this life so
Where did I go wrong
I let this cruel obsession thrive

So here we are
Just one last au revoir
I counted out the goodbyes and the fare thee wells so far

Keep the invisible rope as straight as a rope can ever be
If you walk around a lamp-post
Then walk back to keep it free
Don't tie it up with people;
you've got to hold them to the right
And never let the rope never let the rope
Get too tangled or too tight

Then I stop for a moment
Oh the freedom I have found
I'm back in control
These prison bars are melting down

So here we are
Just one last au revoir
I counted out the goodbyes and the fare thee wells so far
So here we are
Just one last au revoir

So here we are
Just one last au revoir
I counted out the goodbyes and the fare thee wells so far
So here we are
Just one last au revoir
I've thrown away the numbers; we were rivals from the start

So here we are
Just one last au revoir
I'm free of all those bindings I just blew them apart!
Just one last au revoir
Just one last au revoir
Just one last au revoir
Just one last au revoir
