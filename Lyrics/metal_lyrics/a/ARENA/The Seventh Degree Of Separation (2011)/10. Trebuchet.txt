Now I pass the point of no return
There is no way back
Take the choice
Embrace this place
Don't harbour needs to look back
This is me here...
Let it all go...
Slung like a rock through the layers
Now
This is me here...
Falling away...
Got to let go of the past now!

There are symbols in the silence colours in the darkness
Now I know what I have always known but I was sightless
Look at it all...
Trappings of life...
Soon they will pass from my memory
Am I so sure?
Can I let go?
Do I exist if I'm set free?

No blanket pictures
No custom cocktails
Let go the creatures
Houses and hotels
Time to go and walk into the light
Time to go and walk into the light
No more possessions leaving behind them
All those confessions need not deny them
Time to go and walk into the light
Time to go and walk into the light

Now I pass the point of no return
Now I pass the point of no return

Naked and alone
Am I the only one?
Fading from the world
Is this where I begun?
Turn around and look
Resist the urge to run
Fading from the world
Is this where I begun?

Naked and alone
Am I the only one?
Fading from the world
Is this where I begun?
Fall into a state of tranquil calm acceptance
Fading from the world
Is this where I begun?
