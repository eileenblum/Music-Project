Am I still here? Am I hidden from your sight?
Did I suddenly expire; did I walk into the light?
But maybe there is time; one more trick up my sleeve
There is still so much to say
Can anybody hear me?

I'm suffocating
Can't you hear me shout
Wrapped up in soft voices like a reverential shroud
I'm suffocating
Can't you hear me cry
A constant flow of faces on parade before my eyes

Can anybody hear me? So much to say
The secrets I have kept
Stories from the good old days
Can anybody hear me? So much to say
The politics of people
And the games we choose to play

This is not a coma I am resting my eyes
Tired of the noise and scared of the lies
But for one night only I will captivate you all
With one last piece of magic, one last miracle

I'm suffocating
Can't you hear me scream?
As you stab me in the arm in search of somewhere good to bleed
I'm suffocating
Can't you hear my prayers?
A rain of gentle hands trying hard to show they care

I could fly so high and free
If my soul wasn't anchored to me
I've got one last show I have to do
And my powers of illusion will amaze and puzzle you
Pull the rabbit from an old and battered hat
Cut the lady into pieces, just like that
I will mesmerize and dramatize and obfuscate
And I'll finish with undoubtedly the greatest
The greatest escape!

Can anybody hear me? Am I hidden from your sight?
Did I suddenly expire; did I walk into the light?
Can anybody hear me? Am I hidden from your sight?
Did you see me turn to stone, or go missing in the night?
Can anybody hear me? Can anybody hear me?
Did I suddenly expire; did I walk into the light?
Can anybody hear me? Can anybody hear me?
Have I turned into a statue, or gone missing in the night?
Can anybody hear me?
