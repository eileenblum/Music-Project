There is no conjurer, or sleight or hand involved
There is no mystery to be solved
This is a magic with a purity of form
This is a miracle

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Don't rely on what you see
You've got to keep your faith in me... Now!

You cannot hide in the safety of the crowd
This is the moment when you step right now
You surely know this is no cheap and common trick
This took a lifetime to perfect

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Don't rely on what you see
You've got to keep your faith in me... Now!

You're flying now
And that's what matters
You're flying now
And that 's what matters
You'll never fall from safety with my arms around your waist
And that 's what matters
That's what matters

Close your eyes
I said close your eyes
Don't rely on what you see
You've got to trust in me
Take the leap I've got you!
Close your eyes
I said close your eyes
Don't rely on what you see
You've got to keep your faith in me
Faith in me, faith in me

Close your eyes
Close your eyes
Close!
