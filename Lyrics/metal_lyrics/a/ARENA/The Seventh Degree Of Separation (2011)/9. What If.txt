What if the world had been different that day?
What if I'd chosen to stay?
What if you'd stopped me from running away?
There's that twenty twenty hindsight that keep us sane
I know what you'd say
Sometimes other paths seem safer
We just drifted away

Am I for real or just something you made?
A man that your dreams would create
You should have known that the fiction would fade
There's that twenty twenty hindsight that keep us sane
I know what you'd say
We were simply an illusion
We just drifted away

We could never have known
Where our futures were guiding us
We were never alone
Our defences were hiding us
Can you see what we could have been?
Did you ever believe? Could you believe?

Should I have tried to become this ideal?
Could I have made this fantasy real?
I know what you'd say
We were always too afraid
We just drifted away

We could never have known
Where our futures were guiding us
We were never alone
Our defences were hiding us
Can you see what we could have been?
Did you ever believe?
Could you see there was truth in me?
We were almost there

We were never alone
Our defenses were hiding us
Can you see what we could have been?
Did you ever believe?
Could you see there was truth in me?
We were almost there
