Now my friends just watch the screen
And witness magic in ways you've never seen
And don't be scared by the images you find

For these are merely shadows from the corners of your mind

And now behold a forest scene
A picture of serenity
But scratch beneath the surface
And you'll know the true obscenity

It's too late now
Pandora would be proud
You have peered into the darkness
And found what you have found
It's too late now
Pandora would be proud
You can struggle in your harness, but the only way is down...

It's too late now
Pandora would be proud
You have peered into the darkness
And found what you have found
It's too late now
Pandora would be proud
You can struggle in your harness, but the only way is down
It's too late now... It's too late now!

Run my friends from the horrors you have seen
Could it be my creatures are escaping from the screen?
But surely these are images
The cannot cross this line
For these are merely shadows from the corners of your mind

Do you know who I am?
I'm the man who can summon the fright of your life
Do you know who I am?
I'm the man who can bring all the dread to the light

Don't ever doubt what I can do
Don't ever doubt what I can do to you!
