You don't know me, but I know you
You are the man behind the writing on 'stability of truth'
So unaware, so sure of what is real

Your are the man who chose to question
My convictions with such zeal

But I can smile
Leading from the first
As I pass you back your papers
And watch you blindly reach out for the curse
Take the curse... it is yours now!

You don't know me, but I know you
The die is set and you embark upon your
Journey of the damned
The course is laid, there's no reprieve
You should have stayed your hand from criticising
All that I believe

I give you thirty days
A chance to see more clearly
I give you thirty days

Some time to think
For sense to prevail
No doubt you'll try
No doubt you'll fall

Seven ancient symbols
A promise made in hell
Drawn from living blood
This anger can't be quelled
Seven ancient symbols
A bond from Satan's hand
Drawn from living blood
The one who's cursed is surely damned!
