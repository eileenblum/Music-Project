Will you miss me when I'm gone?
Did I affect the life of anyone at all?
Did my presence here on earth
From my death back to my birth
Make a change of any worth
Will you miss me when I'm gone?

Time
Time is running out
Time is running out

Will you miss me when I'm gone?
I started out with best intentions
But my plans begun to stray
All my colours turned to grey
Did it matter any way?
Will you miss me when I'm gone?

Time
Time is running out
Time is running out

If this were prayer, then where would it go?
If there's anybody up there, then now's the time to show me
To show me!

When all else fails even cynics kneel and pray
And that is where you find me today

Time
Time is running out now
My time is running out
Time is running out now
Time is running out
Time is running out now
My time is running out
