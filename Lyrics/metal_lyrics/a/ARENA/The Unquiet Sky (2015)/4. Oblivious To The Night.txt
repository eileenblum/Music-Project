Please don't take things as personal
If I'm critical of what you write
It's merely my opinion, in mind alone
And not bond out of spite...

Tranquil is a place among my books
Harbor of stories and truth
I could spend my days in this literary nest
Secure in the life that I choose

Sanctuary is a place among letters
A landscape of fiction and fact
There is safety here in my castle of words
There is nothing I want or I need or I lack...
