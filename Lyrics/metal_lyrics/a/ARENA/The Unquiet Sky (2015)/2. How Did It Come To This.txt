Something now, is something that will always be
This is far beyond some earthbound human plan
In this universe we're merely specks of sand

Nothing more than man

Tell me, how did it come to this?

What we do, may light an unexpected fuse
Every left or right may lead to consequences
If the butterfly should flap its wings
If an angel sings

Tell me, how did it come to this?
Tell me, how did it come to this?

Once a child, I tried to hold eternity
Take a leap of faith and never fear the fall
But as I floated to those distant shores
I would hit the wall

How could I believe...
There was something on the other side of it all
More than any man could truly understand
More than I could comprehend
So how did it come to this?

Honestly, I never thought I'd seek adventure in my life
Never thought that I would walk so dark a road
In this universe we're merely specks of sand
Nothing more than man

Honestly, I never thought I'd read such judgement in my life
Never thought that I would fall upon this road
And if that butterfly should flap its wings
If an angel sings

So how did it come to this?
How did it come to this?
