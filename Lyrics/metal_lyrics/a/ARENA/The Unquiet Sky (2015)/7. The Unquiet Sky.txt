The face of evil can draw you in
A cold veneer of beauty spread thinly over sin
Before you start to run it can offer you flight

But it's too late now
Here comes the unquiet sky

Taciturn and gentle it floats across your path
A shadow barely visible to the blameless heart
Yet with it comes a sense
Of darkness in your soul
And waiting for the end
Will take its toll

The face of evil can be warm and secure
A dependable guide with intentions all so pure
So tear off the crimson mask and reveal the countless lies
But it's too late now
Here comes the unquiet sky

The face of evil can be woman or be man
With an offer of friendship
And a steady helping hand
You were warned about those secrets
So convincing and so wise
But it's too late now
Here comes the unquiet sky

Taciturn and gentle it floats across your path
A shadow barely visible to the blameless heart
Yet with it comes a sense
Of darkness in your soul
And waiting for the end

These eyes in the mist burning red and burning bright
But it's too late now
The unquiet sky
There's a pulse in the air that smothers all the light
But it's too late now
The unquiet sky
