There's a link that ties us tight
We can't see it, others might
It is pure and it is strong
Not deceptive, never wrong
It doesn't matter where we are
And no distance is too far
Through the fire and through the flames
We are opposites and yet the same

"Like one, that on lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread
And having once turned round walks on
And turns no more his head
Like one, that on a lonesome road
Doth walk in fear and dread
Because he knows, a frightful fiend
Doth close behind him tread"

And maybe, just maybe, that shard of light shines through
And the fates decree the survivor could be you
And maybe, just maybe, that ray of hope shines through
And ensures the last man standing is you... you!

Sealed in hate
I see seven symbols painted there
To curse your fate
Let the traveller beware!

And maybe, just maybe you can make it through the years
By accepting, as you must, that all is not as it appears
And maybe, just maybe the acceptance of that truth
Will ensure the last man standing is you... you!
Whatever you do with your life
Watch for the unquiet sky
Whatever you do, day or night
Watch for the unquiet sky
It will drag you in like and sensual addiction
You're caught in the web
It will drag you in
And perpetual affliction
You're caught in the web
Whatever you choose to do with your life
Watch for the unquiet sky

Sealed in hate
I see seven symbols painted there
To curse your fate
Let the traveller beware!
Carved in blood
I see seven symbols painted there
What's done is done
Let the traveller beware!
