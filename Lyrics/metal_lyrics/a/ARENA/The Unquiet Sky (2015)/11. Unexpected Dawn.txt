The time has passed, the waiting is now over
The curse was lifted from my short and fragile life
The sands ran through this torn and twisted hourglass
But it's not me that has to pay the price
You failed to break the final straw
I am no more a helpless pawn
So I see another day, this unexpected dawn
So I see another day, this unexpected dawn

And it was you that paid the final cost
One error and your house of cards was falling down
Foundations built on nothing more than ignorance
You never did control the demon's crown
Vanquished by the might and awe
Of forces spawned from darker lore
So I see another day, this unexpected dawn

So I live my second chance now
Wiser in the knowledge I have gained
So I live my second chance now
Mindful of the shadows on the floor
So I see another day, this unexpected dawn
So I see another day, this unexpected dawn
