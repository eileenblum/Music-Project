You look at me, but you fail to see
You look at me, but you fail to see
So this disguise is enough to fool
Your arrogance and your sense of self control

Despite your nervous disposition
And your fearful superstitions
Here I stand in your line of vision
You call yourself a dark magician

You look at me, but you fail to see
You look at me, but you fail to see

I am but feet away waiting to work my plan
The curse held tightly now within my trembling hand
I pass the paper
Anticipate
You take it willingly
You walk away!

You look at me, but you fail to see
You look at me, but you fail to see
