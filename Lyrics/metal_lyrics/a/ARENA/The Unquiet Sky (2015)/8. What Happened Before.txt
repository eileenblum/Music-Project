It's happened before
It'll happen again
Disaster in the Air
Misadventure on a train
A body torn to pieces
With no apparent cause
A legacy passed down through some ancient evil lore
Waiting to fall upon its prey

It matters not where I might go
Some quiet leafy glade
Some crowded west end show
However far I wander
I'll always know
That there will come the time when it
Deals that final blow!
Waiting on the edge of my vision
Waiting fall upon its prey

Hell hath no fury like the demon now unleashed
As it roars across the earth
Hell hath no fury like the demon now unleashed
As it seeks to find the owner of the curse

Hell hath no fury like the demon now unleashed
It happened one before
It'll happen once again
Hell hath no fury like the demon now unleashed
As it roars across the earth
Roars across the earth
Hell hath no fury like the demon now unleashed
As it seeks to find the owner of the curse
