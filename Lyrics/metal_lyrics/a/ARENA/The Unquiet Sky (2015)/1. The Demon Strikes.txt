You can hear the Theremin
And the hungry wolves cry out
You can sense the demon coming
And your poisoned heart is choked with doubt
Thirty days were given
Now your time is running out...

Can you hear the sound of darkness?
Can you see the curtain fall?

A song that floats
Like a fading crescent moon
Desperate and haunting
As it tries to fill the room
That melody, it knows you now
It's singing clear and loud
Your time is running out!

Can you hear the sound of darkness?
Can you see the curtain fall?
Can you hear the sound of darkness?
Can you see the curtain fall?

It is all about survival as you dance the Devil's tune
And the curse demands a victim
You must face this all too soon
You try to run away now, but always you'll be found
You can sense the demon coming
For your time has just run out!

I can hear the sound of darkness
I am falling to my knees
As it crashes down on me!
I can hear the sound of darkness
I can see it - it's in the trees
As it crashes down - crashes down on me!
