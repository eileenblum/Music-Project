I spy an innocence caught in your eyes
It shines and beckons me close
I bathe deep in the light of your eyes
They shine and banish the ghosts
How far do travellers go
To reach the safety they yearn for so?
I spy a vulnerable look in your eyes
It draws and beckons me close
I try to shield you from venomous lies
To guide you away from the lows
How far do travellers go
To reach the safety they yearn for so?
I spy the memories trapped in your eyes
The scars are vivid and close
I bathe deep in the light of your eyes
They shine and banish the ghosts
How far do travellers go
To reach the safety they yearn for?
How far do travellers go
To reach the safety they yearn for?
