So little time
So far to go
But your life was
Torn into shreds by the people you know

So little time
So far to go
But your hopes were
Thrown to the wind by the raining of blows

Help me to find a way to talk to you
You can't ignore
What went before
Help me to show you what we need to do
Long before we met
Both our stories had been set

So empty now
Too scared to feel
Hide away and
Wait for the wounds to scar over and heal

So empty now
Too scared to feel
Nothing left but
Swear to the world that these tears are not real

Help me to find a way to talk to you
You can't ignore
What went before
Help me to show you what we need to do
Long before we met
Both our stories had been set

Help me to find a way to talk to you
You can't ignore
What went before
Help me to show you what we need to do
Long before we met
Both our stories had been set
Help me... Help me!
