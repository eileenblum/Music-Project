Could it be my memory has cheated me?
Could it be these memories have lied?
Could it be a fiction written in my head?
Circumstance beyond control, no reason and no rhyme

Could it be those giant spiders do exist?
Could it be they wait beneath this room?
Could it be part of me is playing tricks?
Even now the logic fails I can't escape this fallen tune

Zhivago wolf playing in my mind
Brought to me by kids TV
My father played that melody
Zhivago wolf playing in my mind
Different moments close in time
Pathways merge into a single line

Could it be I threw my cap into the ring?
Could it be she really tamed those bears?
Could it be my long lost friend began to sing?
Curious experience my conscience will not let me share

Zhivago wolf playing in my mind
Brought to me by kids TV
My father played that melody
Zhivago wolf playing in my mind
Different moments close in time
Pathways merge into a single line

Zhivago wolf playing in my mind
Recollections so bizarre
Only I know what they are
Zhivago wolf playing in my mind
Brought to me by kids TV
My father played that melody
Zhivago wolf playing in my mind
Different moments close in time
Pathways merge into a single line
A single line!
