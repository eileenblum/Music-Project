They say it's not been worth it
That I don't deserve it
Is my presence just a multitude of scams?

Now this road I'm taking
Is it all just faking
Am I here through sleight of hand?

A paradise of thieves
Don't ever let me leave
A paradise of thieves
That no one would believe

Is there someone near me?
Who can always hear me?
With a helping hand
That threw a lucky six

Is it intervention?
Or some new invention
Is this just a bag of tricks?

A paradise of thieves
Don't ever let me leave
A paradise of thieves
That no one would believe

A paradise of thieves
Don't ever let me leave
A paradise of thieves
That no one would believe
