Better than I saw you
With my red eyes closed
Rely upon my mind
To tint my vision rose
Every moment shared
Was on the breaking wheel
It was stronger then because
We never made it real

Virtually invisible to you
I am virtually invisible no matter what I do

I can't walk right into any room
Yes walk right into any room

Better that I find you
With my blindfold tight
Tap in all the codes
To begin another night
Every moment shared
Was on the breaking wheel
Give me more intensity and thrills

Virtually invisible to you
I am virtually invisible to you

Here I sit at the centre of my web
Spinning out my charms and promises
Every fragile second every magic thread
A chance to share my sickness my viruses

Virtually invisible to you
I am virtually invisible to you
Virtually invisible to you
Yes! I am virtually invisible to you

I can walk right into any room
Can walk right
I can walk right into any room
Can walk right in!
