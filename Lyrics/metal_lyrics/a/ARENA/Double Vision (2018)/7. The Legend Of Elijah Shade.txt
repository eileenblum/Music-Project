[I. Veritas]

You have seen me before
In the myths and the legends
But I'm not as you think I should be
A monster that feeds
On the human desire to be free
Enslaving the spirit
He dines on the souls
Of the ones far too weak to escape
He has walked amongst men
Since no one knows when
If he's seen it's already too late!
You are wrong!
You misjudge me
My truths are obscure and unknown
You are wrong!
Let the one without sin be the one to throw stones
To throw stones
You are right there is evil
That lurks in the shadows
But fear is a foolish disease
No - Don't be too quick
To let ignorance guide your beliefs
You are wrong!
You misjudge me
My truths are obscure and unknown
You are wrong!
Let the one without sin be the one to throw stones
Life is never black and white
Many shades can hide from your sight
Life is never black and white
Good may still prevail through the night
Life is never black and white
Good may still prevail through the night
You are wrong!
You misjudge me
My truths are obscure and unknown
You are wrong!
Let the one without sin be the one to throw stones
To throw stones

[II. I Am Here]

For the first time
I walk into your lives
A most unwelcome stranger
A traveller arrives
I know that look
There's suspicion in your eyes
That look of hesitation comes as no surprise
I am here
For better or for worse
I am here to heal you
To lift that curse
I am here
Though you'd throw me down to hell
Despite your fears only time can tell
But every time
I walk into your lives
I'm seen as the big bad wolf
In sheep's disguise
Though I'm not near the innocent that dies
Those looks of doubt and loathing
They come as no surprise
I am here
For better or for worse
I am here to heal you
To lift that curse
I am here
Though you'd throw me down to hell
Despite your fears only time can tell

[III. Saevi Manes]

You're the judge
You're the court
You're the jury
You have bought into a lie
Do you even know why?
So strange
What you see isn't real
Not the 'me' you think you know
Watch the paranoia grow
Just because I choose to take
A twilight path of my own making
So hide!
With your heads in the sand
You've been fed a fairy tale
It's a suicidal trail
Just because I choose to take
A twilight path of my own making
Now!
I will banish all these ghosts
Now!
I will banish all these ghosts
You're the judge
You're the court
You're the jury
You have bought into a lie
Do you even know why?
Invite the beast with open arms
He fooled you with his empty charm
Now!
I will banish all these ghosts
Now!
I will banish all these ghosts
Now!
I will banish all these ghosts

[IV. It Lies]

On a feather bed it lies
Cocooned in a haze of midnight sun
Unconscious
To the forces gathered at its tomb
Just steps away they cower
Behind the hopes of stake and cross
Wrapped in a fragile veil of faith
And driven by their sense of loss
This is for Ken
He was too young to die
And Agatha
Why did she leave us so soon
Dear Jennifer
Oh such an innocent soul
And this is for Brian and this is for June
Bowed in fear
They choose to walk the path to hell
Far too late
That resting peace lies somewhere else!
This one's for Dan
In the prime of his life
And Tommy who truly would not hurt a fly
There's Alice and there's Sarah
So cruelly erased
It just makes no sense
Did they all have to die
Bowed in fear
They choose to walk the path to hell
Far too late
That resting peace lies somewhere else!
They can't win
That's why I'm here
I'm here to help!
Like or not
I'm the best chance you've got
Like it or not
I'm the best chance you've got

[V. Tenebrae Down Here]

I can see them glowing
Glowing in the dark
These cold and empty souls
Watch them glowing in the dark
Down here
I can find them wandering
Wandering in the dark
These cold and empty souls
Wandering in the dark
You are their nightmare
But I am yours
I am more than just myth!
Down here
I can see them fading
Fading away
These cold and empty souls
Watch them fading away
You are their nightmare
But I am yours

[VI. Omens]

Writing's on the wall now
You should have seen the signs
Read between the lines my friend
Read between the lines

[VII. Redemption]

It is gone now
I took the pain away
It is gone now
It is corrupt and decayed
You couldn't outrun the shadows
Where the terrors of the night await
You could cover your head

Pretend you're dead
But you knew that you couldn't escape
They dwelt on the periphery
Their claws upon your shoulders
Whatever you tried
There was nowhere to hide
Your world got a little bit colder
If hope has paled to nothing
If you need a helping hand
Just call for me
I will pull you free
Together we will stand
We will stand!
I will always find you
Yes!
I will always find you
Before the day has ended
As the light begins to fade
Oh you will not remember
My presence or my name
This curse has now been lifted
You've broken from your chains
But you will not remember
My presence or my name
For an age I've travelled
A thousand year crusade
They have known me before
They are the ones I found
The ones I saved
I will always find you
Yes!
I will always find you
I will always find you
Yes!
I will always find you
