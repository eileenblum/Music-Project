I thought I had more time left
For the wild and the new
Looking for the signpost
Never threw me a clue
And now you say you're sorry
But there's nothing you can do
Well sorry's not an answer
There's still nothing you can do

No matter what I try
I'm ending up right here
Alone to face the darkness and the fear

Where's the miracle I need
Where's the dream to set me free
I've been poisoned again
When I'm clinging to the day
As the future fades away
I've been poisoned again

Searching for a chance now
I only need a thread
Going to make this fight my own now
Got it clear in my head
I am not a hostage
There is hope in every breath
No, I am not a hostage
There is hope in every breath

No matter what I try
I'm ending up right here
Alone to face the darkness and the fear

Where's the miracle I need
Where's the dream to set me free
I've been poisoned again
When I'm clinging to the day
As the future fades away
I've been poisoned again

No matter what I try
I'm ending up right here
Alone to face the darkness and the fear

Where's the miracle I need
Where's the dream to set me free
I've been poisoned again
When I'm clinging to the day
As the future fades away
I've been poisoned again
