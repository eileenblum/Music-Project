You dare to wear the emperor's clothes
But we see right through your games
You brag a thousand golden shows
There's a void behind there claims

You try to raise yourselves so high
By attacking those around
Every grain of truth is fried
In your hunting ground

Spin and spin 'til your followers give in
Throw that mud at the wall
Spin and spin 'til your followers give in
Going to sucker them all

Writing cheques your ego can't cash
It's a bubble that will burst
You wake up and it's gone in a flash
And you won't have been the first

You try to put yourselves on top
By treading others down
You boast of everything you've got
It's just a paper crown

Spin and spin 'til your followers give in
Throw that mud at the wall
Spin and spin 'til your followers give in
Going to sucker them all

Whoa oh take a good hard look now
Do you need this fools disguise?
Whoa oh take a good hard look now
Can't you see the mirror lies?

Floating around your fantasies
Losing track of what is real
So convinced that we believe
Convinced of your appeal

You built a man with feet of clay
Fearing to be overthrown
And now to keep the wolves at bay
You stand alone

Spin and spin 'til your followers give in
Throw that mud at the wall
Spin and spin 'til your followers give in
Going to sucker them all

Whoa oh take a good hard look now
Do you need this fools disguise?
Whoa oh take a good hard look now
Can't you see the mirror lies?

This fiction grows
How far can you go?
This fiction grows
Don't you think we know?

This fiction grows
The seed you sow
Ho far... how far can you go?
How far can you go?

Whoa oh take a good hard look now
Do you need this fools disguise?
Whoa oh take a good hard look now
Can't you see the mirror lies?

Whoa oh take a good hard look now
Can't you see the mirror lies?
