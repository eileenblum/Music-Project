Pouring fuel across the fire
Let the flesh evaporate 
I can hear it in their crazy voices
They're opening the floodgates
Shout loud that burning mantra
With the confidence of fools
Let it be me
Who sets you free! 
Exile! You show no mercy
You're living in a mindless state
Exile! You've crossed the line this time
You've thrown it all away

And you can drag this new pariah down
Till the lifeless body breaks 
I can see it in their angry faces
They're opening the floodgates
Shout loud that burning mantra 
With the unity of fear
Let it be me
Who sets you free! 

Exile! You show no mercy
You're living in a mindless state
Exile! You've crossed the line this time
You've thrown it all away

Exile! You show no mercy
You're living in a mindless state
Exile! You've crossed the line this time
You've thrown it all away
