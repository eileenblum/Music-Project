Some bitter puppeteer tore away my right to choose
Dealt me shit instead of cards
Watched me bluffing from the start
Some warring cavalier rode the truth into the ground
Dragged me screaming by the feet
Left me sprawling in defeat 
Right - right to the end
We are joined till the universe fades into darkness again

Some deep deluded author wrote new chapters in my life 
Threw my hat into the ring
Let the lady start to sing
So here we face each other, in the blackness of the night
I don't care how it appears
This ends now, this ends here

Right - right to the end
We are joined till the universe fades into darkness again

I can read your mind - Your future's so defined
Beware you've crossed the line this time
Are you so sure of what you'll find
A victim of your lies
A witness to your own demise
There's nowhere else to turn

Right - right to the end
We are joined till the universe fades into darkness again

I can feel your craving - The way that you behave
I can hear the thunder roll
The pleading of a million souls
You've done this to yourself
You've done this to yourself
There's nowhere else to turn

Right - right to the end
We are joined till the universe fades into darkness again
And you know, yes you know
We can't survive alone... on our own!
