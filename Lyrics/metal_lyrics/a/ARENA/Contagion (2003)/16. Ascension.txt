I feel vindicated 
Looking back on what I've done
Not so complicated
When moments meet as one
Are you ready to part the veil?
And write a new beginning to this tale 
Rising up
I see creation from the sky
I'm learning to fly
Rising up
I see creation from the sky
This freedom is mine 

Standing on the mountain
The olive leaf in hand
Drinking at that fountain
So that I might understand
Are you ready to start once more?
With no idea of what's in store
Are you ready to part the veil?
And write a new beginning to this tale

Rising up
I see creation from the sky
I'm learning to fly
Rising up
I see creation from the sky
This freedom is mine
Rising up
I see creation from the stars
We've travelled so far
Rising up
I see creation from the stars
We've travelled so far
Rising up
I am rising up
