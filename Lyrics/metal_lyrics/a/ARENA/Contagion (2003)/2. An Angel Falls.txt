An Angel falls, so fragile and exposed
Soon lies crushed and wasted - Too delicate to hold
A soulful melody innocent and pure
Rises to the sky and is lost for ever more 
As guilt rains down 
And scars the faith of man 
It flows into the ground
We will never wipe the bloodstains from our hands

A failing heart, vulnerable and weak
Waiting for the moment to beat the final beat
Surely there is someone who'll reach out
Surely there is someone who'll reach out
