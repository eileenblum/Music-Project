I am the painted man
With a frown on my face 
And a language you don't understand
A wild refugee 
That is all you people can see
I am the painted man
With a smile on my lips
And a living tattoo on my hand
That's no guarantee
Of the truth you people can see 
Why - With poison so strong in our hearts
And the world torn apart 
Why - when our actions bring nothing but pain
Can't you see that we're painted the same?

I am the painted man
With bile in my veins
From a dark and sinister plan
Blind and deceived
That is all you people believe
I am the painted man
No thought for the world
I was here when the nightmare began
Wrongly conceived
That is all you people believe

Why - With poison so strong in our hearts
And the world torn apart 
Why - when our actions bring nothing but pain
Can't you see that we're painted the same?

Come down from your ivory towers
Corruption devours us all
Come down from your ivory towers
The hunger devours us all
