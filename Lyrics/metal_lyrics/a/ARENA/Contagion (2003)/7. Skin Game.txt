Knowing what I know
I'm never free to come and go
But when I try to open doors
I burn when daylight hits the floor 
Playing the skin game
Breathing the blue flame
Playing the skin game
In sight, insane

Knowing what I know
I've been looking for a space to grow
And maybe I can set you free
Yes maybe I can set you free

Playing the skin game
Breathing the blue flame
Playing the skin game
In sight, insane

I'm content to live in the vacuum I have made
A comfortable existence on my own
The problems of the world are there for others to debate
I prefer to face my days alone!

Kneeling down before I sleep 
Never said a prayer that I believed
One day you'll understand 
Why have I become this way?
Maybe it's another quirk of fate 
Yielding to my DNA 

Try to live on my own
Reborn once more as a whisper on the telephone
Unafraid of it all
Every thought, every dream, I will call! I will call!
Now I'm living alone
And all I am is a whisper on the telephone
Making sense of it all
Every thought, every dream, I will call! I will call!
