We've sown the seeds now
Don't know where they may fall
Just lonely ghost towns
Empty churches, empty town halls
We've travelled far now
And so into the wilderness we crawl 
I'm floating through the debris
Of reference books and catalogues
Climbing over sun baked bones
Of Kings and Queens and Demigods

You can take away my crown
But you'll never bring my spirit down
I won't give in 
Try to push me off the rope
I will float down on the wings of hope 
I won't give in 

I wander through the dead lands
Computer chips and stereos
Powerless technology
Instruction books and videos

You can take away my crown
But you'll never bring my spirit down
I won't give in 
Try to push me off the rope
I will float down on the wings of hope 
I won't give in 

Time may fly - And I will search the world for you
Rainbow skies - And I will cross the seven seas for you
Race on by - And I will find my way to you
Rainbow skies - And I will cross the universe for you
