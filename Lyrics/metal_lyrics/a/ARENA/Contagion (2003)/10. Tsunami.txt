A wave that rushes headlong through the darkness
An eternal flood that violates our minds
A mighty river thirsty for our sanity
A waterfall that crashes down upon mankind 
The foam that smashes deep into the shoreline
A tidal force that's pumping through our veins
A wordless voice that echoes in our beating hearts
Driving every living soul insane

There's nowhere to hide now
There's nowhere to run

A skyline that is changed beyond redemption
The planet with it's back against the wall
Man was overflowing with self confidence
The time was overdue that he would take the fall

There's nowhere to hide now
Nowhere to run 
There's nowhere to hide now
Nowhere to run
