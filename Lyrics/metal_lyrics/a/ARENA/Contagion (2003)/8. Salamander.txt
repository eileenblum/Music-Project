Blue fire, spreading across
From my finger tips - a powerful chaos
Ice cold, consuming all
Unstoppable advancing wall of
Radiance, marching forth
For the final throws of a world war 
Bow down before the truth
I hear the cry - too late to stop you 
Burn - Like a moth to the flame
We'll burn - As the fire calls us by name
Burn - Like a moth to the flame

Blue fire, spreading across
From the farthest shore - the final cost
Go back to the other place
Another side of a well known face
Blinding light, the world falls down
I will draw you in to the slightest sound
Reach out, follow your heart
To the end of time - You will not be the last

Burn - Like a moth to the flame
We'll burn - As the fire calls us by name
Burn - Like a moth to the flame

Blue fire, a creeping curse
There is nowhere safe in the universe
Too late, you are hypnotised
By the gentle waves, as they dive and rise
One strike of a single match
And the human race is reduced to ash
Bow down before the truth
I hear the cry - too late to stop you

Burn - Like a moth to the flame
We'll burn - As the fire calls us by name
Burn - Like a moth to the flame
We'll burn - As the fire calls us by name
