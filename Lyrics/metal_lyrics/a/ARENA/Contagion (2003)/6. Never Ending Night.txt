Just a simple thought, cast into the light
Leads to such destruction - never ending night
In my blind obsession to avoid the fools I've seen
How could I not recognize the fool was always me? 
As guilt rains down 
And scars the faith of man 
It flows into the ground
I will never wipe the bloodstains from my hands

This seed of hate was carried in my soul
Waiting for the moment when it could take control
Surely there is someone who'll reach out
Surely there is someone who'll reach out

A failing heart, vulnerable and weak
Waiting for the moment to beat the final beat

As guilt rains down 
And scars the faith of man 
It flows into the ground
I will never wipe the bloodstains from my hands

Is there someone who'll reach out?
Surely there is someone who'll reach out
