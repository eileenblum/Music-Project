We walked the line, and made it out on the other side.
We were so blind, how can we see when we canât open our eyes?
(We walked the line) We walked the line, and made it out on the other side.
We were so blind, how can we see when we canât open our eyes?

Open your eyes. And see how dangerous it could be to see what weâve consumed.
Weâre living without a purpose, living without a compass.
On a ship without a captain, weâll sink into the blackness.
Of an ocean depth so deep we canât find light to help us see.

Pour salt in my wound, stitch up my face. Will I make it out of this place?
Forget the past, stand eye to eye, show your scars, this is your fight.

The wicked will fall. The wicked will cease to exist.
Their cities will burn. Theyâll crumble beneath their feet.
(As wicked) As wicked weâll fall. As wicked weâll cease to exist.
Our cities will burn. Theyâll crumble beneath our feet.

Weâre no better than anyone else.
Weâre no better than anyone else, but we can change ourselves.
Weâre no better than anyone else, so why do we pretend?
Weâre no better than anyone else, but we can change ourselves.
Weâre no better than anyone else, so why do we pretend?

So as you sit on your faulty throne, making promises you cannot keep.
One day youâll be overthrown, till then we will not sleep... we will not sleep.

We will tear apart this wasteland, in search of the truth.
We will tear apart this wasteland, in search of the truth.
