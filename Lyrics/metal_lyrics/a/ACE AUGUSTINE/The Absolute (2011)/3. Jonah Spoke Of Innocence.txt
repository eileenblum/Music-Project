Goodbye, youâve chosen your path. Iâm sticking to mine. Whoâs going to stop you now.

Look back to the times where weâve pointed out the stupidity of society...
Oh... ...of society... of society.
Never again will I rage this war with myself.
Never again will I bow down on... on my knees.
Never again will I rage this war with myself.

When all is said and done I will hold strong. When all is said and done I will hold strong.

Nothing will stop me now. Iâve made my stand, and Iâm never going back, Iâm never going back.
Iâve made my choice, so Iâll use this voice and believe.
Making waves in these dark waters isnât as easy as it looks.
Nothing will stop me now. Nothing will stop me now.
Nothing will stop me now. Nothing will stop me now.

For I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Oh.... Oh....
No, nothing will stop me. No, nothing will stop me. No...
