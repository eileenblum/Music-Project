And Iâve read these words about a million times.
From page to page, from word to word.
The message is clear, but misunderstood.
But how can I believe such hypocrisy. From an institution so unfair and unjust.

For I am a believer, but still I am a sinner.
I have seen the lowest of lows, and the highest of highs.
I will believe in the truth, the truth will set you free.
What life are you waiting for?

To the core of my being, Iâll stand tall and Iâll stand true.
To the core of my being, Iâll stand tall and Iâll stand true.

Savior such hypocrisy, this was not intended. The truth will set you free for all eternity... eternity.
These chains Iâve wrestled with for so long be gone, be gone.
These chains Iâve wrestled with for so long be gone, be gone.
These chains Iâve wrestled with for so long be gone, be gone.
These chains Iâve wrestled with for so long be gone, be gone.

Be still, look to the sky, and know where youâre from.
Be still, look to the sky, and know where youâre from.
Be still, look to the sky, and know where youâre from.
Be still, look to the sky, and know where youâre from.

Be still, look to the sky... (Weâll break the mold we made and make it all for you.)
...and know where youâre from. (Weâll break the mold we made and make it all for you.)

And He said: "I am your Creator, your Alpha and Omega. I am the Word."
"I am your Creator, your Alpha and Omega. I am the Word."
Yeah... "I am the Word." "I am the Word." "The Word."
