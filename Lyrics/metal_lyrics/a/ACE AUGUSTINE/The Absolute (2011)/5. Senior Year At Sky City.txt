Stuck in this white world. Walls caving in. Walls caving in. The tides will turn.
Oh... The tides will turn. I promise you. The tides will turn. I promise you.

I will be there for you. I will be there for you. Iâll see this through.
I will be there for you. I will be there for you. Iâll see this through. Iâll be there. Iâll be there.

Youâre on my turf now. Youâre on my turf now. Cause youâre on my turf now.
Searching, swiftly, all your life, you canât hide.
Searching, swiftly, Iâm there for you, Iâm here for you.
Take my hand, weâll make it through. Searching, swiftly, all your life, you canât hide.

Oh, no, I wonât let you down. Can you hear the glory of the trumpets.
