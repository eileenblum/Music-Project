Reminiscing, youâve been reminiscing your foes for too long.
Now get a grip on your goals, and push through your struggles... your struggles.

Sometimes the problem lies within the main source.
Can you find the courage to stand up for your inner being... to stand up for your inner being.

Swim deeper for your strength. Walk further for your wisdom.

The defendant has stepped forward. The defendant has stepped forward.
The defendant has stepped forward. The defendant has stepped forward.
For time is of the essence, repent, repent and be clean... be clean.

Temptation never looked better on anyone else.
The man in the mask looks inviting, but please remember yourself.
Temptation never looked better on anyone else.
The man in the mask looks inviting, but please remember yourself.

You chose your path where thereâs hope, now letâs move forward.

This is a callout to the world, and all the stars in the sky will burst.

Unmask yourself, my enemy, for youâre a sinner.
Unmask yourself, my enemy, for youâre a sinner.
