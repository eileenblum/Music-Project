Iâve been to the bottom, where I fought my past. Reaping the silence is how I finished last.
Go away, youâve done your damage here. Leave this place, youâve cost us so much fear.

All these days Iâve been hiding from you, from the truth.
The weight that my heart holds is devastating.
You fooled me once, youâve fooled me twice.
And to think Iâd fall for your games again.
Abandon your cargo, this place is rigged.

To my Father, Youâve seen the worst in me.
Captive inside this place, the blueprints failed me, thereâs no escape.
Captive inside this place, the blueprints failed me, thereâs no escape.

Where will I go when Iâm gone? Where will I turn to in these hard times?
For Jesus Christ, my savior. Iâve found my home and it lies in You... lies in You.

Iâll stand my ground, I am who I am, and you wonât change me.
Iâll stand my ground, I am who I am, and you wonât change me.
Iâll stand my ground, I am who I am, and you wonât change me.

He who will not reflect is a broken man.
Who are you to judge me, your lies are spilling through your eyes.
Who are you to judge me, your lies are spilling through your eyes.
The tables have turned (the tables have turned),
Iâm not your pawn (your pawn), I wonât play games any longer.
