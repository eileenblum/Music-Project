Theres something that Iâve been dying to tell you.
For a death in me is a death in you.
Absorbed in the thought of doing my best.
Everyone takes a staggering pleasure in proving their falseness.

You are the air I breath, you are the steps I take,
you are the words I speak, you are the life in me.

Letâs see Your mission for I am a warrior. Can I walk the plank and still hold composure.
Sinking down to the ocean deep. Iâm moving forward, but Iâve failed to see.
Sinking down to the ocean deep. Iâm moving forward, but Iâve failed to see.

I will not break, my feet are planted firmly on the ground.
Take a look at me, itâs who I am. You try to change it, but youâre pounding the sand.
Close your eyes, let the light surround you. Donât look back, for youâre now on your way.
Close your eyes, let the light surround you. Donât look back, for youâre now on your way.

Weâll light the match and burn this place to the ground.
All misconceptions will be gone without a sound.
Oh God the end is near before the time runs out.
Letâs save these hearts and minds, for soon You will come down.
Iâll be the filament and Youâll be the fire. Youâll be the truth, and Iâll be the liar.
Iâll be the filament and Youâll be the fire. Youâll be the truth, and Iâll be the liar.

Iâll be the filament and Youâll be the fire. Iâll be the filament and Youâll be the fire.
Iâll be the filament and Youâll be the fire....

This place is burning down. This place is burning down.
Oh, this place is burning down. Oh, this place is burning down. Oh...
