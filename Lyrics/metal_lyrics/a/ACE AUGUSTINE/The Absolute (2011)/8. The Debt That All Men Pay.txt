I see you drowning. Iâve come to hold you down.

This is the cycle that I will lock you into. Without air youâll breathe anything I give to you.
So self-absorbed you fail to see yourself. Iâve got my hold on you and Iâm not letting go.

Iâm the puppeteer, and you have lost control. Iâm the puppeteer, and you have lost control.
Oh, marionette, how you move when I tell you to move.
Oh, how beautiful the look of conformity wears on you. Hell has met its match.

Repent oh wicked one, false encounters donât fool me.
Repent oh wicked one, I said coward are you weak.
Who is your god now as your burned in this eternal fire,
you canât change the damage youâve done.
And as your burned in this eternal fire, you will take away the lives youâve won.

So seal your fate, there is only one, there is only one God.
So seal your fate, there is only one, there is only one God.
All out of hope, Iâm a broken man. Where will I go?
(So seal your fate, there is only one, there is only one God.)
All out of hope, Iâm a broken man. Where will I go?
(So seal your fate, there is only one, there is only one God.)
All out of hope, Iâm a broken man. Where will I go?
(So seal your fate, there is only one, there is only one God.)
All out of hope, Iâm a broken man. Where will I go?
(So seal your fate, there is only one, there is only one God.)

As you walk towards the fire, as you make your final choice.
Look up to the light, look up to eternal life.
