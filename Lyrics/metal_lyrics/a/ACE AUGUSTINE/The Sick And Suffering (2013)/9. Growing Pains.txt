Am I asking for to much
I give credit where it's due
Only to find myself face to face with you

Words of wisdom don't take what you have for granted
You find yourself without hope
Everything's now abandoned
Everything's now abandoned, abandoned

Oh!

Question everything you know
Like you have all the answers in the palm of your hand
Question everything you know

I've been dying to reach the end
And when I'm here I hope I find what I'm searching for
Now tell me was it worth it, was it worth it
Please don't tell me it was just a waste of time

This is a game of follow the leader
You'll lead the way and I'll be the reaper
With caution the truth slips away, the truth slips away

The time that is spent
It could go on for days
I wish you could know this feeling I can't portray

I'm not sure what I'm living for
It eats me alive from the inside out
It eats me alive from the inside out

I've been dying to reach the end
And when I'm here I hope I find what I'm searching for
Now tell me was it worth it, was it worth it
Please don't tell me it was just a waste of time

I find it hard to believe
I can't do this much longer
I seems like my thoughts are getting the best of me
I set out on this journey not knowing what was ahead
We cast the first stone together
And made a destiny my future the best of me, the best of me

I've been dying to reach the end
And when I'm here I hope I find what I'm searching for
Now tell me was it worth it, was it worth it
Please don't tell me it was just a waste of time

I've been dying to reach the end
And when I'm here I hope I find what I'm searching for
Now tell me was it worth it, was it worth it
Please don't tell me it was just a waste of time

Purity finds its purpose finally
Purity finds its purpose finally
