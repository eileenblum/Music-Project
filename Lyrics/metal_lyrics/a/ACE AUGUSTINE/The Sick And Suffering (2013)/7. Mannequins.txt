Display window mannequins parade down the street paved with conformity.
Each individual stands out in the mirror and yet blends with this mixed crowd.
Dead in the mirror, step into this life.
Even your reflection, can't look and say, "You're just as lovely on the inside."

Oh why don't you understand, that you are not these people.
So paint yourself with gold, and make a habit of being alone.
We're monsters, turned out by the machine, fabricated by society.
We get by, on our own greed, we've lost our own identity.

You're alone in this world.
There's nothing on this earth that can save you now.
If all you're looking for are flaws you'll find them.
If all you want is change, you'll get it.

Can I write a beginning for the helpless and give a beat to the heartless?
Can I save myself and those beside me? Can I save anyone?
Crack the plastic molds, make room for growth.
I know I'm a sinner, but God knows it's time to wake up.

Oh why can't you understand, that you are not these people.
So paint yourself with gold, and make a habit of being alone.
We're monsters, turned out by the machine, fabricated by society.
We get by, on our own greed, we've lost our own identity.

There's nothing here that makes you worthy.
There's nothing worthy that you have left.
This filth is making it hard to breathe.
This filth is making it hard to believe.
