We're only treading water, trying not to sink,
as these waves take us places we never were.
We're only sinking deeper, to the bottom of the sea.
So don't tell me I am safe if I'm drowning, don't tell me there's good in me.

Don't tell me I'm saved if you're lying, don't tell me what you can't see.
Don't tell me I'll live if I'm dying, unless you make it your duty to save me.
Don't tell me I'm safe if I'm drowning, don't tell me there's good in me.
What good are words in the middle of a struggle, I need silence.

What good are words if I cannot speak, at the bottom of the sea,
at the bottom of the sea.
We're only treading water and trying not to sink as the waves take us places we never thought we'd be.
We're fighting the current and forces at bay.

They're taking us places, we never thought we'd be.
I'm struggling to find my safe harbor.
I need an anchor to keep me still.
I'm just a ship, that's failed. â¨That's sunk with no hope of ever being found.

So don't tell me I'm sad if I'm laughing, don't tell me what you can't see.
Don't tell me I'm dead if I'm living, don't take that away from me.
Don't tell me that grace is impossible, unworkable, unfeasible.
Don't tell me I'm sad if I'm laughing and don't tell me that its unattainable.

There's a truth to be found. (There's a hope to be had.)
There's a red-skied night. (There's a red-skied morn.)
There's a good, there's a just. (There is evil and sin.)
There's a God who forgives (There's a devil, he lives.)
Hell does have flames, but they don't offer hope, they swallow it, they burn it.

The ocean still trembles above my face but it's getting calmer as I'm sinking deeper.
