Don't give up
Give all that you got
This is your final lap
Open the door
Because you need some more
The stuf that you adore
Crawl as a snake
And never take a break
It's like a piece of cake
Play tha piano
Repair your car
Prepare the meal
Hurry up
It's you last lap
You gonna make it
You gonna take it
You gonna break it
