This house is full of reptiles
Full of tails and feet
Full of snouts and tongues
And that terryfying screech
It's too full to move in here
I can't even mowe my head
I probly won't make it to the John
I guess I'll piss beside the bed
This house is full of reptiles
Dragons and lizzards rule
So much noise my head explodes
Someone is shaking me like a cnoor
My hous is full of reptiles
Dragons and lizzards rule!!!
My house is full of reptiles
And it's ain't fuckin' cool!!!
