I gave up everything
Even though I was a king
I sat under the crown
I'm waiting for the light
I won't be leaving soon
'Cause life is just waiting
But I know for what
It's good to know
That it's only diception
I'll wait 40 days or 9 lives
It really doesn't matter
What counts is here and now
Not surfing in California
Light is worth 100 prayers
Demons stealing peace are merciless
They are strong but can be beat
By 2 small girls: Love and humility
Bright so light!!!
