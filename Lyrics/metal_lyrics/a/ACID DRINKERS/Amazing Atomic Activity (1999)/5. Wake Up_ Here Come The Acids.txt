Wake up! It is 4 in the morning
Wake up! Someone's knocking at the door
Maybe someone is starting the third world war
Maybe someone wants to borrow sugar, ooh.
Get up
Open up
Hurry up
Wake up! Here come the Acids
Wake up! It is 5 in the morning
I know you are waiting, you are always waiting
Don't plan on sleeping a wink for 3 days
I gonna mix, gonna make purple haze
Get up
Open up
Hurry up
Wake up! Here come the Acids
Get up! It is 6 in the morning
Just unplug the phone, I won't leave you alone
Shit! There's no way, I'll leave you alone
I've been going like this for many days! Ooh!!!
Get up
Open up
Hurry up...
