I shouln't have reached my hand out
For something that wasn't mine
You know what, what that means
You've been there, there with me
You know what, what that means
You've been there, there with me
When you're empty, empty inside
You don't think if it's wrong or right
I really wanted so I took it
I know that wasn't too very smart
It was there so I went for it
Again no one saw us do it
It was there so I went for it
Again no one saw us do it
They couldn't even, even catch s
We were being very careful this time
You don't have to be angry in me
Oh, sweet lady, please, set me free
And justify, justify, justify, justify me
