Do you think, I'm a thing of a past?
Do you think, I'm not gonna last?
That it's time to humor me
That I should take my place in history
I stand like a matterhorn
I am stubborn like no other
And I'm sure I'll never sink
Gozilla is my younger brother
Do you think, I'm a thing of a past?
Do you think, I'm not gonna last?
That it's time to humor me
That I should take my place in history
I stand like a matterhorn
I am stubborn like no other
I stand like The China Wall
I got muscles like a ball
Do you think, I'm a thing of a past
Do you think, it's time for me to end
That I stink of mud and fish
That time is not my friend
Spoken: I chose the tastiest bits
I'm gonna whistle like a kettle
I present to ya my amazing atomic activity
Here I go, on my own
Do you know my atomic activity
