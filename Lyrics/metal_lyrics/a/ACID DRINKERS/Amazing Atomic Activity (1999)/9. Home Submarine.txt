I was living in a fort
And I didn't want to leave at all
I didn't even have a plan
Even to poke my nose out
And that was really nothing
I have done this all before
Pissed off at the time
Me and 1000 bottles of wine
Yahoo told me long ago
'Bout an under water boat
Close the curtains, shut the door
Take it down to the ocean floor
Sitting here beneath the sea
Me and my friend damn TV
We are waitin' for the time
When we will leave the ocean slime
I'm sailing in my submarine home
I'm hanging in my water world
