Played a gig in South River Town
5 minutes in it got shut down
Cops said it was too loud
Problem was the pissed off crowd
Left the bar with a beer in hand
One hour later I was in the can
Can't drink on the streets 
in the States no way
That's the way things are in the USA
Left the bar with a beer in hand
One hour later I was in the can
Can't drink on the streets 
In The States no way
That's the way things are in the USA
Cops told me a Polish joke
then he found my friend had coke
Bail was paid we were on our way
Once again greenbucks saved the day
You can't drink on the streets in the USA
No way!!!
