You're set on standing in my way
I know that you are after me
I feel you like my shadow
That's how clearly, you persue me
Don't you think it's gone long
Can't you leave me in peace?
It's the damn middle of the night
Because of you I can't sleep.
Really now you've gone much to far
I know you've done your best
Just go ahead and shoot me
Then at least I'll have some rest
Don't you think It's gone on long
Can't you leave me in peace?
It's the damn middle of the night
Because of you I can't sleep
You better shoot me, honey, now
I will have some rest
You better shoot me, honey, now
You have done your best
