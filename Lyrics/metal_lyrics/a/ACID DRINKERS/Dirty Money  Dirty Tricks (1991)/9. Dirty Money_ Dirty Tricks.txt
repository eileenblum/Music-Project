Hey, fool where from are you comin' ??
I can assure you, you got nothing to do here
On you soft, little face
Hey, fool you got any business ??
I can assure you, here's no business for you,
You can only lose your head,
You can only get heated!
O.K fool, so you want to play,
But are your prepared to take the risk ??
I Don't think, that you will leave rich,
I Don't think, that you will leave healthy !!!
[Chorus:] Dirty money
Dirty tricks
What's the swamp
Everybody wants to cheat me !!
