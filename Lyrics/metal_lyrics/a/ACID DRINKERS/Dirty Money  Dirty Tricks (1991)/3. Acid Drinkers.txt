Boy, you can go away
And don't try and come back
I don't forgive mistakes.
don't you excuse yourself
You're a scabby liar
We need some blood to clean our honor.
I am a Titan of patience
You will lose your first battle
I wont give you my hand.
don't follow me !!!
You will get lost on the first mile
I wont tell you the rest
See you in a cuckoo's nest.
I don't talk with bastards
I don't ever talk 
You know, Its not in my style.,
No, No, No, No !!
I trust no one
You know I walk my way !
[Chorus:] don't follow me ---- You'll kill yourself
Stay at your place don't think bout' me
don't follow me ---- You'll kill yourself
We were not made to win !!
