Lend me your gun, I've got someone to kiss
I'm still nervous when I walk down the street,
Fresh wounds, old wounds, every one knows
Don't scream on me here we go !! . . . 
I sell old block, I fly straight
Got no time to rot, I've got new carburetor
I'm leavin' this suckers valley
And they are peevish like the deepest asshole !
My blood is hot, hot as hell
My leash was bitten through, no time to lose
Leavin' the ghetto, I'm not lookin' back
I'm not willing to suppurate !
Oh, kiss my ass, I'm on my way now,
But I stop at every alehouse
I feel the force, I've got the power
Gonna make it show like rapid fire.
I am a shark, I'm the leader of the pack
Every one looks at my crocodile shoes
And no one knows what's in my head
No one know's, if I'm good or bad !!
I'm back
You'll see your own dead body
I'm back
I'm angry and bloody !!
You cannot stop me, man.
