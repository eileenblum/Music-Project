What's happened ---- you leaving' so early
I could say: It isn't right
Don't try to tell me, you're feelin' so bad
Don't try to lie ---- you Don't wanna fly !
I saw you sittin' alone in your room
Lookin' in the mirror all the long nite
And someone told me, you're feelin' so old
You're feelin' so tired, you cannot see the light !
What's happened ---- you leaving' so early
I could say: It isn't right
Don't try to tell me, you're feelin' so bad
Don't try to lie ---- you Don't wanna fly !
I cannot help you, no, where is your power,
You Don't wanna tell me what's wrong !
I couldn't turn back on you, what's going on, yeah,
You Don't wanna...
I cannot leave you here, where is your force, yeah,
You Don't wanna...
I cannot help you, no, take you to a doctor,
You Don't wanna...
Are you a rebel ?!
