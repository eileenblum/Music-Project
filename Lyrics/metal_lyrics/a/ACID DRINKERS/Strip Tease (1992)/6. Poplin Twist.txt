Psychodelic band gives them a rhytm
swollen procession in disgusting hops
look at the blind - men following the sound
exciting cacophony - money play but...

Close this shed
Sister you became wild
you shake your ass in a bad rhytm
my dear friend you lose your good manners
In morbid dance
you stifle [x3]
If you only feel the blues, jah, jah, jah
