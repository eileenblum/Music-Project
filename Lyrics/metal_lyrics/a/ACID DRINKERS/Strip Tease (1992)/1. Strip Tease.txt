Money is a nerve of war, love and theatre
and I'm convinced, fuck, it isn't funny
and you're asharned, when you talk about money
but it's your mask, I will pull out the true
I'm gonna humble you, I wanna strip you,
I wanna force you to...
Psychical strip-tease
You sau to me tolerance, it smells of falsehood
you drive a knife in my back, takin' bout botherhood
now you're telling 'bout friendship, it is nasty and it's cheap
it is your mask, I will pull out the true
I'm gonna humble you, I wanna strip you
I wanna force you to...
Psychical strip-tease
Running with the devil
Dear blockhead, dear lovely muthafucker, I present you 
panorama of mu crotch, Are you indignant?
Don't be indignant, boy, my little sweet sucker
it is your mask, I will pull out the true
I'm gonna humble you, I wanna strip you 
I wanna force you to...!
Psychical strip-tease [x8]
