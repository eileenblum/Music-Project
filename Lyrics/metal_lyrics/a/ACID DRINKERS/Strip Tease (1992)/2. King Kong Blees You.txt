Attention everybody
attention gays and women
I've made a proclamation
you've got to hear it
I wanna put red - heat
on frost - bitten brains
I wanna do it well
with awful pain

President is on my side, it makes me feel alright
President is on my side, it makes me feel alright 

Attention everybody
attention bitches and killers
I got a plan of war
You've got to see it
this plan is rather easy
I gotta reach the rot
I'm proposing prudence
I was born as a nut
President is on my side, it makes me feel alright
President is on my side, it makes me feel alright
