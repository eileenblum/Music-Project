Soft words you can whisper to my charming asshole
Soft treasons, bloody gossips, abominable stories
I will spit on your head, you'll know your neurosis
Your lying eyes make me really f...in' mad
I'll repay, my boy, be sure
I was too nervous, I had piece of mind
I was too colored inside, I thought, that I'm strong
But my sense of safety, my sense of immunity
Burst like a meagre, faulty condom
I'm gonna make an order in, in your brain
You cannot be a dick, so bad to me, OK
Yes, I will be your medicine man, oh baby
I'm gonna make an order in, in your brain
I'll uproot bad habits
My feelings are transformed and breaking through the ass
Of this old red haired bitch - Autumn
Wallow in a gutter
S... eaters, supermeaters, welcome to the club
Greetings to your company and get out of my sight
F... you and your nice lies
I'm gonna make an order in, in your brain
You cannot be a dick, so bad to me, OK
Yes, I will be your medicine man, oh baby
I'll repay, my boy, be sure!!!
