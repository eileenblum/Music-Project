I've appeared without a reason
Yeah, I came without an invitation
I climbed into your heads with my dirty shoes
And sick behavior
I sit down aside your face
And I grasp your most sensitive place
And I don't care that you're calling the police
Yeah, I'm the best customer of the gallows
I'm the best customer of the gallows
I'm a rocker, A real mothaf...er
I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker, A real mothaf...er
I'm a rocker, A real mothaf...er
I've arrived here without warning
Cos I heard something just like calling
And I'm insolent, nervous individual
I'm property of the executioner
I'm gonna lash your boorish conscience
And I'm tenderly treading your hearts
Oh, I don't care that you're calling the police
Yeah, I'm the best customer of the gallows
I'm the best customer of the gallows
I'm a rocker I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker, A real mothaf...er
I'm a rocker
I'm a rocker, A real mothaf...er
I'm a rocker, A real mothaf...er
