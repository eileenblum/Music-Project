Kick in the brain, still the same, oh, please tell me
What's my name
Hook in neck, fire storm, bloody rain, year, it came
Breaks my skull, hits my eyes, what fun, where's my arm
We're the heroes, victory, what's the caddish melody
It's dedication for this creeping meat
Requiem for corpses the blues of the bat
My hysteric hymn, my dance macabre
And wonderful charm of your big, burned head
War is over, fight is over, but blood is boiling
War is over, fight is over, but blood is boiling
I am mad, maybe dead, sea of s..., trash in mouth
Talk of hate, bullets taste, no heartbeat, bloody sweat
Noise in head, I see red, I'm unclean leave me please
Got no power, I can't cry, f...in' nightmare every night
It's dedication for this creeping meat...
War is over, fight is over, but blood is boiling
War is over, fight is over, but blood is boiling
No don't go, don't turn back, look at me, yeah, at me
Living corpse, real wreck, here I am, don't forget
It's dedication for this creeping meat
War is over, fight is over, but blood is boiling
War is over, fight is over, but blood is boiling
War is over, fight is over, but blood is boiling
War is over, fight is over.
