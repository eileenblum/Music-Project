People, listen, for whom the war
beautiful, international brawl
I'm in no mood to bargain
make me know the name of land
There's no day without war
selling conflicts is my job
the business is payable
you wanna buy massacre - money on the table

god bless this fuckin' deal
it's only ripping hearts
I'm a juggler of the fate [x2]
People, listen, for whom the land
a brand new contry with a pretty flag
I'm a prominent hate expert
I'm a juggler of the fate
I'm a pure businessman
I trade in disasters
everything is practiceable
you wanna fill cemetery up - money on the table
god bless this fuckin' deal
it's only ripping hearts
you must only come and pay [x2]
People, listen, for whom pestilence
an exeptional virus - the killer
million victims guaranted first day
you must only come and pay
it's my unwritten law
crime, genocide is my play
it's profitable activities
you wanna buy a war - money on the table
