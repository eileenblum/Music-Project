Deep darkness, hard stench, the dirt, the pressure
poison - gas, the circus, we vade in the sea of shit
my fear, my blindness, impotence, it makes disorder in brain
we stand in heep of dung
Yeah, we're a submarine, we sail in sinkin' swamp
dead souls, impunity, insolance, confusion,
disorder, lawleness, it is a time of lie, an anger, and tears, 
decay, disruption Time of lie
An anger, and tears, decay, disruption, robber, jingoism
we toy with TNT, oh, karel, rhey want to strangle, to break us
I'm frighten, oh fuck, they mean a bloody juice
Yeah, we're a submarine, we sail in sinkin' swamp
dead souls, impunity, insolance, confusion, lawleness,
lawleness, time of lie, time of lie, an anger, and tears,
and decay, disruption
Time of lie
we fret anf fume, yes, we fret and fume
Just like rats inside the cage
Do you know, do you know something about madness
Do you know, do you know something about madness 
Do you know, do you know something about madness 
do you know, do you know something about
something about, something about madness!! Madness!!
Just like rats inside the cage
