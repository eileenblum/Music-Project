He died on the edge of the town
Poor, poor Ronnie
Oh, why, why dude
You were not a fool
Is this a new killer in town
Ha,Ha you gotta look around
Smelly kiss of fate
F...in' asshole stopped on his road
The crafty killer
The graves filler
So long, So long, So long
See you in heaven
What's the panic in the branch
Who's gonna leave
Who's gonna capitulate
Go down spider, don't wait
Is this a new killer in town
Ha,Ha you gotta look around
Now Ronnie lies
Imitating excriment
It's not a lucrative job
You're finished boy
Bye, Bye Ronnie
Bye, Bye Ronnie
