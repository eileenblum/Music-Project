This Strange situatien makes you sad
you feel a big piece of shit in your poor head
yeah, take it easy my little friend
it's only beginning, no, no, not the end.
Don't make me laugh, you wanna use the knife
I got better poison, honey, you gotta stay alive
Don't make me sad, you really want to leave
By the way you're right, death is health, that's true.
Now you gonna lie, now you gonna try try to run for your life
fake your silly smile, try to stop your cry
You're bleeding, you're shouting
you're crying, you're dying.
Heavy shame bites your brain.
Ooooh, you are lost my dear!
Tears are sweet, yeah, you know
I'll tell you nothing, U'm not willing to talk
We'll have a dinner, but am I hungry? Not!
I got a business - hey, shut up and go away!!
Now you gonna lie, now you gonna try to run for your life
fake your silly smile, try to stop your cry.
You're bleeding, you're shouting
you're crying, you're dying.
He
