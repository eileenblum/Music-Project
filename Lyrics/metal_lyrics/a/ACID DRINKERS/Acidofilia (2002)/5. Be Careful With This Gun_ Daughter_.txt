Sweetheart!
Pack your lunch!
Pack your extra magazine!
We have a wonderful day ahead!
Your Magnum is laying by the phone
Ready for the day
Don't look that way, honey
I know it's like a second right hand
Did you clean the gun?
You know that's important
Be alert at your lessons
Have eyes in the back of your hand
Be quick or you will die
Don't be taken by suprise
There is an early relase
For shooting dealers!
Can anybody?
No! Nobody can!
Tp help me to stop
To be still a man
We have a wonderful day ahead
Be quick or yuo will be dead
We have a wonderful day ahead
Be quick or yuo will be dead
We have a wonderful day ahead
Be quick or yuo will be dead
We have a wonderful day ahead
Be quick or yuo will be dead
Can anybody?
No! Nobody can!
Tp help me to stop
To be still a man
Can anybody?
