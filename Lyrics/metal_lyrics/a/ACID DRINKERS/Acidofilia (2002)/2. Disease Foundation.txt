Take the diamonds
Take the gold
Fill the pockets
Call the whores
Start to clean your
Fancy cars
But I'm not willing
To see your snouts
I hear the snakes
I see the crocks
They suck my blood
They bite my bones
But I'm too merry
To scream and shouts
Still not willing to see your snouts
He needs a cure
Got to stand up
He needs a guide
To climb on the top
Never gonna give it up!
Digging your grave on the sunny beatch!
Just play with madness!
So try to cheat me
How good you are
Your smile is wide
You lick my butt
Sometimes you win
Sometimes you loose
But every cause is good to booze
I hear the snakes
I see the crocks
They suck my blood
They bite my bones
But I'm too merry
To scream and shouts
Still not willing to see your snouts!
He needs a cure
Got to stand up
He needs a guide
To climb on the top
Never gonna give it up!
Digging your grave on the sunny beatch!
Just play with madness!
