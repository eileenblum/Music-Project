Gold fever in the city
I filled my pockets full
I stuffed myself completely
I'm looking like a wool f
I loaded all the bags
Now I need t oget them move
The car is loaded to the max
That's all that I could do!
Working as gard as I could
Digging in a diamond mine
I filled my whole ass full
Taking as much as I could find
I threw them in a bag
I am gragging it like an ox
The basement has been filled up
That's all that I could do!
Digging in a diamond mine
I cross the final line
Digging in a diamond mine
Digging on, digging on! ...uuu...
I'm digging on...
Digging in a diamond mine
Digging on, digging on! ...uuu...
I'm digging on...
Digging in a diamond mine
I fell so fine
I cross the final line
I cross the final line
Silver fever in the village
People's heads are coming off
And I know where and what
And I won't tell anyone
They are digging like mad
Wondering, searching, swearing
And I filled up the chest
And that's all they saw of me!
Diggind in a diamond mine
I cross the final line
Digging in a diamond mine
Digging on, digging on! ...uuu...
I'm digging on...
Digging in a diamond mine
Digging on, digging on! ...uuu...
I'm digging on...
Digging in a diamond mine
I fell so fine
I cross the final line
I cross the final line
