Don't go too far away
That doesn't work for me
In next few hours
All the killers will be free
No need to wander
Sit by the telephone
just stay at home
Stay all night long
Don't go too far away
That doesn't work for me
In next few hours
All the killers will be free
No need to wander
Sit by the telephone
just stay at home
Stay all night long
Stick around just stick around
Just stick around [x3]
Just, just, just, just
Stick around just stick around
Just stick around
Wait at the end of freeway
I will pick you up on way
Hang in the local area
We got a lot of things to say
Sit in the corner
Of the same old bar
I will get you on my way
Gona dance to Whiskey In The Jar
Wait at the end of freeway
I will pick you up on way
Hang in the local area
We got a lot of things to say
Sit in the corner
Of the same old bar
I will get you on my way
Gona dance to Whiskey In The Jar
Stick around just stick around
Just stick around [x3]
Just, just, just, just
Stick around just stick around
Just stick around
Just, just, just, just
Stick around just stick around
Just stick around
Don't go too far away
That doesn't work for me
In next few hours
All the killers will be free
No need to wander
Sit by the telephone
just stay at home
Stay all night long
Stick around just stick around
Just stick around [x3]
Just stick around
