How did you get in my hell?
How did you get in my hell?
Your blood has such a sweet smeel
Your blood has such a sweet smeel
I never expected you
I never expected you
Will you let me taste it, too?
Will you let me taste it, too?
But others can give me more
But others can give me more
I won't let you find the door
I won't let you find the door
I won't let you find the door
Others can give me more!!!
Blind, drunk eyes
Hipnotized
Blind, drunk eyes
Never, never wise
Following the special sound
Following the special sound
I whirled round and round
I whirled round and round
I sat on the carousel
I sat on the carousel
Like I was under someone's spell
Like I was under someone's spell
Thanx for an awesome ride
Thanx for an awesome ride
I felt I could fly
I felt I could fly
Blind, drunk eyes
Hipnotized
Blind, drunk eyes
Never, never wise
All that's left is sweet
All that's left is blood
Maybe we were wrong
Never mind, thanx God
Maybe I was nut
Never mind, thanx God
Blind, drunk eyes
Hipnotized
Blind, drunk eyes
Never, never wise
