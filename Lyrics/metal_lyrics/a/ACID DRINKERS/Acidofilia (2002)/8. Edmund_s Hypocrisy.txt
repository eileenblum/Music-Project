To weak to exist
In the gossip press
But we like your cynical games
He's too old a slender blond
Hey, Ed my main man
You have amazing blow out brain
Hey, Ed you'll be dead!!!
If you jump into my bed!!!
That's no good
Not that equipment
Ed is clever
He knows how and where
Sweaty hands and red face
Old stupid Ed
They got him by his nakes ass
Hey, Ed you'll be dead!!!
If you jump into my bed!!!
You fucker!!! [x4]
So shine, you son of the bitch
I want to see you on TV
Keep going you old freak
Even if it rain shit
Let nothing hold you back
Don't wring your neck
Can you hear the bell?
See you in hell
Hey, Ed you'll be dead!!!
If you jump into my bed!!!
