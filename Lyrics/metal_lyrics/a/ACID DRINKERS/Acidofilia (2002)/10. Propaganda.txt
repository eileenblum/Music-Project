Show me more blood
Show me more bones
Let me hear more screams
Help me rot to the core
Show me more fear
Give me more pain in my ass
I am ordering horror
I am ordering a frightful shock
My fists are going to drown in blood!!!
Show me more blood!!!
Show me more bones!!!
Much more than ever!!!
Give me the menu
With the best recipes
For a perfect murder
For a brilliant attack
Show me more coke
More and more happy addicts
I want to see more bodies
Secret rotting flesh
My fists are going to drown in blood!!!
They are giving me more blood
From morning to night non stop
Bulldozers ride over the bones
Ears are filled with the sound of screams
They are giving me more fear
My fists are going to drown in blood
And so much pain in my ass
And I take it all like a starving man
My fists are going to drown in blood
Horror is the bargain of the day
Show me more blood!!!
Show me more bones!!!
Much more than ever!!!
More blood!! More and more
and more!!
More blood!! More and more
and more!!
