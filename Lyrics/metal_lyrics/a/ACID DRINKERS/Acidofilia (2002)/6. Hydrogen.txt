Another day,
Another lied,
More hopes and words
And thoughts black as a nite
Another place
Another time
Another needing and bleeding and
pleading
And such like
You can't explain
I can't deny
We can't take off, blow off
The sins kept us alive
You felt great
You felt fine
But I stumbled so humbled
Seeking any good sign
I don't sink, I will not crack!!!
I won't bleed, I'm on my straight way
back!!!
I close my eyes
I disappear
i stopped the time, in time
So I could eat my fear
No farther steps
No looking on
And no feeding, exceeding, proceeding
And so in
I won't sink
I won't crack
But go away, get away
I won't turn you back
And all is said
And all is done
And all the gains and losses
Burned in The Almighty Sun
I don't sink, I will not crack!!!
I won't bleed, I'm on my straight way
back!!!
Another day,
Another lied,
More hopes and words
And thoughts black as a nite
Another place
Another time
I don't sink, I will not crack!!!
I won't bleed, I'm on my straight way
back!!!
