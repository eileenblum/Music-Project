SPIKE IN MY HEAD !!!
I'm so damn superstitious
I run from black cats
I don't wash my dick on weekends
You can't change that, so don't try
I am so damn superstitious
I shake hands with chimney sweeps 
I don't talk to taxi drivers
With a whore I screw the pimp
I am so damn superstitious
I sleep the thirteenth away
I don't screw the wives of friends
I don't piss in the wind, no way
I'm so damn superstitious
I don't hunt for Charles at nite
Ola is the girl I want
Dealer's gonna get a fight
Another spike in my head!!!
Another spike in my head!!!
Another spike in my head!!!
Spike in my head!!!
I'm so damn superstitious
I run from black cats
I don't wash my dick on weekends
You can't change that, so don't try
I am so damn superstitious
I shake hands with chimney sweeps 
I don't talk to taxi drivers
With a whore I screw the pimp
Another spike in my head!!!
Another spike in my head!!!
Another spike in my head!!!
Spike in my head!!!
