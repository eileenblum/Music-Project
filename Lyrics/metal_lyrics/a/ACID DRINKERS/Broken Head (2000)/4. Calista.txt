I wanna be thin like you, uhh
Thin as my monthly payment.
I could wear your dresses baby
By the monday night, by the pale moonlight
I'll enjoy to wear your stilletos
Your pajamas could be perfect for me
I'd rummage your wardrobe baby
By the monday night, by the pale moonlight
I wanna dig in your dump !!!
I wanna dig in your dump !!!
I wanna dig in your dump !!!
I wanna dig in your dump !!!
I wanna be a dancer
As good as you are
I could pinch your ass
When I hold you tight, by the pale moonlight
I adore the mega mess
You got inside your head, your brain will be my bed
I wanna dig in your dump
When I hold you tight, by the pale moonlight
I wanna dig in your dump !!!
I wanna dig in your dump !!!
I wanna dig in your dump !!!
I wanna dig in your dump !!!
Skin and bones!
Crocodile gloves!
She loves the jazz! 
Baby be my guest!
