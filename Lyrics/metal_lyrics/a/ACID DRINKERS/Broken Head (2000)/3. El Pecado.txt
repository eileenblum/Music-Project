It comes in without pain
Dissolves everything inside
It shrinks and tightens my brain
Throws my consciousness aside 
It reproduces like rats
Tastes like candy, burns like the sun
A spider builds it's sticky nets
Gets a hold on everyone
Burns red! ! !
Makes me a liar! ! !
Devours me ... desire! ! !
Gonna grasp the nettle
Gonna puke and clean the sly's den
I will proof my mettle
I will have it finished to the end
Half a man, half a moon
At the end of the hall
Licking all my wounds
Happy cuz I've done it all...
