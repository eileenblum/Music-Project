(He) pounded my head with a rubber hammer
Now I'm shorter by over half a meter
I don't look down on anyone anymore
I don't spit on anybody's head
(He) pounded my head with a rubber hammer
Now all I have is a screwed up head
Do you know what a drag it is
Having a broken, wasted head?
Rubber hammer and broken head
Rubber hammer and broken head
Rubber hammer and broken head
Rubber hammer and broken head
Don't have money for a mechanic
Or a doctor or a shrink
Now I will just wander around
Short, with a smashed in wasted head
Rubber hammer and broken head
Rubber hammer and broken head
Rubber hammer and broken head
Rubber hammer and broken head
That hammer could fuck your whole day...
