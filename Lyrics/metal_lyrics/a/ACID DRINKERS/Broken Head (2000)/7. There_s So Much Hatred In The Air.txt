There's so much hatred in the air
That it it's hard for me to breath
There's so much venom in the air
I can feel it's pressure around me
There is so much hatred in the air
I need to kick it in the ass
My buddy said (that) I lost my mind
I don't care 'bout that!
Don't wanna kill anybody tonite 
Gonna stay in bed
My buddy said (that) I lost my mind
I don't care 'bout that!
Don't wanna kill anybody tonite 
Gonna stay in bed
Sweat is pouring out of my body
I need to have a drink
I need to turn off the damn TV
I can tell something is not right
All Polish men are going bald
I think that's rather funny
With out any hair they start to work out
And loose their sense of humor
My buddy said (that) I lost my mind
I don't care 'bout that!
Don't wanna kill anybody tonite
Gonna stay in bed
My buddy said (that) I lost my mind
I don't care 'bout that!
Don't wanna kill anybody tonite
Gonna stay in bed
There's so much hatred in the air
That it's hard for me to breath
There's so much venom in the air
I can feel it's pressure 'round me
There is so much hatred in the air
I need to kick it in the ass
So much of that shit is in the air
That the laundry won't dry on the line
My buddy said (that) I lost my mind
I don't care 'bout that!
Don't wanna kill anybody tonite
Gonna stay in bed
My buddy said (that) I lost my mind
I don't care 'bout that!
Don't wanna kill anybody tonite
Gonna stay in bed
