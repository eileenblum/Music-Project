Don't go to where I sleep
It's a place not very nice
Don't listen as I mumble in my dreams
You won't hear anything nice
Ref.: Everybody needs some time to rest
Let me have some rest
Everybody needs some time to rest
Let me have some rest
Respect those few hours
When I don't need to shake
And don't disturb me when I fall
I am a monster when I awake
[Ref.:] Everybody needs some time to rest
Let me have some rest
Everybody needs some time to rest
Let me have some rest
Don't go to where I sleep !!!
Don't go to where I sleep !!!
Don't go to where I sleep !!!
Don't go to where I sleep !!!
Don't go to where I sleep !!!
Don't go to where I sleep !!!
Don't go to where I sleep !!!
Don't go to where I sleep !!!
[Ref.:] Everybody needs some time to rest
Let me have some rest
Everybody needs some time to rest
Let me have some rest
Everybody needs some time to rest
Everybody needs some time to rest
