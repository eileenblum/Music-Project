Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot !!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
So you ask me to dance
Draw me out on the floor
I will give you the rhythm
Don't you look to the door
Sway your hips to the music
As I draw you in close 
That's the DOG ROCK baby
Take another big dose!!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot !!!
So you ask me to dance
Draw me out on the floor
I will set the rhythm
You can show me the step
Softly you sway your hips
As I grab you by the ass
That's the DOG ROCK baby
Take another big dose!!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot !!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
Take another shoot - dog rock!!!
You will feel so much pain
You will see so much puke
Plug your ears if you want
You won't hear the bad news
Piss your pants on the floor
Feel the hard times no more
That's the DOG ROCK baby
Take another big dose!!!
