If you really loved me, you'd take me out to town
If you really loved me, you'd never forget me
If you really loved me, you wouldn't give me the things I don't want
If you really loved me, you wouldn't want anything but me
For you I'm always there
Just walk there aint no stairs
For you I'm always there
Just walk there aint no stairs
You can't buy a walkway to heaven cos they don't exist
If you really loved me, you wouldn't leave me waiting in the hall so long
If you really loved me, you'd give me some of your time
If you really loved me, you wouldn't hang on others arms
If you really loved me, you wouldn't want anyone but me
For you I'm always there
Just walk there aint no stairs
For you I'm always there
Just walk there aint no stairs
You can't buy a walkway to heaven cos they don't exist
If you really loved me, you wouldn't break my hurting heart 
If you really loved me, you'd never doubt my love
If you really loved me, you'd take me everywhere you go
If you really loved me, you wouldn't want any more
For you I'm always there
Just walk there aint no stairs
For you I'm always there
Just walk there aint no stairs
