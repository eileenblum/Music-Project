I don't remember if I let it be known
I was a butcher, I even cut myself
I worked with precision, I was merciless
There was no sorrow, there was no pain
I cut my body and leashed my brain
Did you beat me
For twenty days
Burned me alive
And finished by pissing on my grave
No sorrow, no pain
I cut my body and leashed my brain
Maximum Overload
I whipped my eyes, probably a million times
I would cruise around the city wound up
I was up to no good and I never got caught
There was no sorrow, there was no pain
I cut my body and leashed my brain
Did you beat me
For twenty days
Burned me alive
And finished by pissing on my grave
No sorrow, no pain
I cut my body and leashed my brain
Maximum Overload
