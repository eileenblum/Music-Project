A piece of living meat
Was the nicest gift I could ever give
He never thought he'd see
A second chance, a second chance to live
Take out the blown out valves
A brand new shiny pump
A technical machine
High octane blood to clean
Pump, pump the plastic heart
Give it a jump, give it a start
I emptied out the tank
The poison blood it stank
His body turned to black
Raging out in our attack
I couldn't remake a ma
If it weren't the master's plan
I worked until it was dark
Then I gave the pump a spark
Pump, pump the plastic heart
Give it a jump, give it a start
