The lava kept on flowing
The islands was covered
The lava kept on flowing
An information river
My private kingdom smothered
An information river
Multimedia deceit
Coming down my street
I don't wanna be your trash can
I'm not a garbage truck
With endless space for junk
The lava kept on flowing
I don't have a nervous system
That's just a sewer system
An information river
Don't stain my close
With fuel from your hose
I don't wanna be your trash can
The TV news it flew
It crushed me in its wake
The lava kept on flowing
Telling all what's new
To listen was a mistake
An information river
The radio puked on me
How much can one man take
I don't wanna be your trash can
The lava kept on flowing
The islands was covered
The lava kept on flowing
An information river
My private kingdom smothered
An information river
Multimedia deceit
Coming down my street
I don't wanna be your trash can
