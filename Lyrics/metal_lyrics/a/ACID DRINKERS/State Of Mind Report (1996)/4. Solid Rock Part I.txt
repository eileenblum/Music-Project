Is there someone in your life
On whom you can depend
Who will never sell you out
Betray you as a friend
Everybody needs someone sure, someone true
Everybody needs a solid rock, I know I do
Who'd die to set you free?
Is there someone in your life
You trust and never doubt
Thta when you're cryin' out in need
He'd come to help you out
Everybody needs someone sure, someone true
Everybody needs a solid rock, I know I do
Who'd die to set you free?
Is there someone in your life
Who'd give up their all to be
A friend who'd never let you down
Who'd die to set you free
Everybody needs someone sure, someone true
Everybody needs a solid rock, I know I do
