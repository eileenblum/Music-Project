.....Everybody listen to me
You better stop, don't start me up
To battle
2000 years many pretext to fight
2000 years when one came to unite
We always fight over what we should say
Why can't we see that we're on the same way
So many years so much wasted time
Lets not repeat the mistakes of the past
To reconcile there's a chance everyday
Why can't we see that we're on the same way
.....Everybody listen to me
You better stop, don't start me up
To battle 2000 years so much division and hate
Why can't we see all the things we agree
Always the same that's not what I say
Why can't we see that we're on the same way
2000 years many pretext to fight
2000 years when one came to unite
We always fight over what we should say
Why can't we see that we're on the same way
.....Everybody listen to me
You better stop, don't start me up
To battle
2000 years many pretext to fight
2000 years when one came to unite
We always fight over what we should say
Why can't we see that we're on the same way
You better stop, don't start me up
To battle
