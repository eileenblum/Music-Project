Fifty bears jumped on my neck
And fago told me it would come back, yeah!
He said: "Sometimes it's very painful
When they are biting and trying to suck, suck!"
You see, this evening as an executioner
Tormented me again
And lost apostles kicked my ass!
Kicked so strong
And the colored lady did nothing
To make me feel well
They killed my soul
I wanted it cos I'm a fool In Rome you will take your vengeance
-Rocca was sure
It is to be ninety-two, yeah!
-Some guys will cry
And the city always knows where I'm going
In it;s swollen dead body
The city will send apostles
The city's not stupid
Waitin' 4, waitin' 4
Fago wrote me a letter,
He said: "I got no money
For bread, for wine, and for condoms, either but..."
