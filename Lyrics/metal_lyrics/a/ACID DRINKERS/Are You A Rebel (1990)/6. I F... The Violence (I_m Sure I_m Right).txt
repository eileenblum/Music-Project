(I'm Sure I'm Right)
Did you see these guys fighting on the streets
Did you hear these f...ers, waitin' for you and me
Did you see your friend, bleeding on his knees
Do you feel the fear, darkness is coming here
Did you see the blood on the walls of houses
Do you feel the fear, darkness is coming here
I f... the violence and I'm sure I'm right.
