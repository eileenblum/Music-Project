I'd have to be blind - to be safe
I'd need to be deaf - to be safe
I would need to be wounded in all my senses
But then i wouldn't be human
Wouldn't be able to tell
About what is going on in my heart!!!
I'd have to be stupid not to see the enemy
I'd have to be an idiot to ignore him
I'd have to be out of my life
But then i wouldn't be human
Wouldn't be able to tell
About what is going on in my heart!!!
So what's happening in my heart of a pacifist?!
