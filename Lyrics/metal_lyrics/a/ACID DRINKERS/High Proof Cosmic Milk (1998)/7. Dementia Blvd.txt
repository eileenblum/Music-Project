Let's meet at midnight on madness alley
Have lots of time our walk will be long
Leave you pan, leave you camera
You'll write everything in sprint
You'll need to take courage
As well as patience
Let's meet at midnight on madness alley
Have wide open eyes write everything in sprint
We'll drink with fear
We'll snake the hand of death
Decadence will be our guide
Smell of terror
Smile of idiots
Echo of gun shot
Let's meet at midnight on madness alley
You gotta have a brave heart look around you:
Hallucinations shame, remose lack of will
Do think we'll be able to return
Smell of terror
Smile of idiots
Echo of gun shot
