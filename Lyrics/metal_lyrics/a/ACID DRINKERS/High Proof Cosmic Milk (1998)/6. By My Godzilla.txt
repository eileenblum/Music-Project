I can't shhot something thet dosen't exist
I can't forget about what's in me
I can't vomit what i didn't eat
I can't hide from the shadow
I can't fight with a monster
Cuz i don't look suicidal
I don't call the guys for help
I can't endanger them
Devour me i'm a big cheezcake
Eat until you're full
I'm an all you can eat
Bar drink me all up
I'm a pint of the brew
Devour me as i stand
Be my godzilla [2x]
Devour me As i stand
Be my Godzilla
I can't call the doctor for help
Be my godzilla
I can't hide from the monster
Be my godzilla
I can't fight with a monster
Cuz i don't look suicidal
I don't call the guys for help
Devour me as i stand
Be my godzilla
