Loaded like a nuclear head
Filed up to the top
Muscles like a football player
Blind as v1
Doesn't know where to hit
But he'll demolish it for sure
Like a blind fate, like doom
Like a rhino, like the bloody rain
Leave the house
What a light
Leave the house
What a sound
As much pent up energy
Like tgv
Precise as a tornado
Doesn't know where's his front
And where's his ass
Bloody joyous black despair
Leave the house...
Brain left safe in the closet
There with underpants
On a shelf
Like mentak rainy day savings
Laying next to the penny
Pinchers purse
Leave the house...
Loaded like...
