I don't think i've seen
Something like that
I'm preety sure that
I haven't tired that
I'm ready for everything that Drives me hungry
It's not about stuff i've
Tired i've paid
Fly high wings are wide
Hit the clouds fall &amp; die
I devour friends
I'm bosom buddy driven by
Free gas fill up the glass
I'not staring thoughtlessly
At the stars so high
I'm waiting for a diet
Of cosmic milk
Fly high wings are wide
Hit the clouds fall &amp; die
I don't think i've seen
Something like that
I'm preety sure
Thet i haven't tried
That get loaded on energy
Let it put you on your feet
I reccomend a diet of
High proof cosmic milk!
