There is no life
In what you selling me
There is no life
The love that you offer
Is synthetic stuff
Is synthetic stuff
I can`t see any happiness
In what you`re dealing
You can keep goin` for it
You only gain on shit
Goin for it
Gain on shit
There is no life
In what you selling
There is no life
The love that you offer
Is synthetic stuff
Is synthetic stuff
What you call truth
Is just poisonous lies
Stop telling me I need
To be ideal man
Goin for it
Gain on shit
There is no life
Is synthetic stuff!!!
