Johnny started to play
With it at shool
And finished in the forest
His friend played with
Matches
They didn't save him
Doctors couldn't put him
Back together
Shorty milked the cash
Box dry
Today he's in the nut
House
Who infected the poison?!
Where is the poisonous well?!
Who shit in the stream?!
Who?!
That doesen't look good.
That doesn't even sound good.
My home is a castle
My street is a battlefield.
That's not funny
Now i gotta booze
That sounds disgusting
Like a rattlesnake blues
Who infected the poison?!
