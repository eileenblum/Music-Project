A vision of unjust justice still frightness me
I kill a s... and they sentence me for killing a man
it's a vile vision - fear on your face
I'm not qualified in that direction
I'm in the mood for serious selection
it's time to mend, repair the mind
I look for expert - he's hard to find
So what can we see?! It is a vile vicious vision
so what can we feel?! yeah it's a vile vicious vision
so what can we see?! so what? vile vicious vision
so what can we feel...
A river of words from a black box still poisons me
I offend a sack of shit and I'll pay for offending a man
I feel like burning, buring this dump
I need a power to break it down
So what can we see?!...
