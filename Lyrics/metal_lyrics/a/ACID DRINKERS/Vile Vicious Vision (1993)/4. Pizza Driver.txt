He left town a long time ago
angel dust tempted him
and he went after a woman
he was a real hit over here
He keeps rigging something on the side
yeah, he was a leader of the pack
it was a dream team, nothing to say
with the public he had his way
Never, never give it up! [x4]
He won't sit still for long
every now and then he drops by
a good drive pushes him and me
so I heave peace of mind
Never, never give it up! [x4]
