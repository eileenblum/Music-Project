Tonight I'll fight
With dream, It's always unkind
This dream, Bout him
Oh, f..., it's creacked
My lover visits me
My lover frightens me
Nasty pig's kissing me
His dick, In dream
Is touching my cheek
His ass, In dream
Over my face
My lover visits me
My lover frightens me
Nasty pig's kissing me
My lover visits me
My lover frightens me
Nasty pig's kissing me
My gloom, His love
Is my f...in' doom
His ass, In dream
Over my face
My lover visits me
My lover frightens me
Nasty pig's kissing me...
