Let the most stupid one speak
nervously scratching his ass
I'll have the chance to smell
that ugly pompous stench
let the dumb - ass make me laugh
let him make my pressure rise
Cheap emotions win
swallow minds in a deep sleep
I smoked a pack of cancer sticks
because of an elite dick
I will know who to look for
when I wind up in detox
Kamikaze club, I can fire you up
Kamikaze club, I can fire you up
My body is too weak
my hair's growing back to front
they're gonna transport me there
I won't be normal anymore
I will know who too look for
when I wind up in detox
