Buy yourself some drums
and a guitar too
turn on the mic
we're jammin' dude!
Steady as she goes
it's an easy beat
let's record this stuff
so what if it's s...?
Don't look back
watcha doin' man
don't you know that tuning
guitars isn't in?
fire it up
let's play on ten
we'll play in the basemant
where the bass is beter, man.
Play that riff, is it E or A
gimme a break, no one knows anyway
we'll make a demo and sell the whole lot
nobody wants to buy it?
Oh, f..., why not?!
