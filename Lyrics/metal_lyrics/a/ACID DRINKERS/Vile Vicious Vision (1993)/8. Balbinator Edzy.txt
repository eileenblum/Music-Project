Butterfly precedes a broad and she's big carier of death
I'm selling small - time s... so I can buy some bread
horse is eating horse, rain beats against my butt
a spy is in the window, street cars suck
Pat on me my lonely back, pinch my pink baby - ass
wake me with a 3-ton clock, I can't believe he's really here now
The bastard grinds, sucks so sweetly,
how high he flies, he sucked out my spine

An ugly old - fart's begging, I'm ashamed to give him change
booze puts my lights out, with my boot I wake a snake,
the witch has a pink pussy, a black stone is healing me
the cab drivers feels the heat, at eleven we will meet. 
Pat on me my lonely back, pinch my pink baby - ass
wake me with a 3-ton clock, I can't believe he's really here now
This bastard grinds, sucks so sweetly,
how high he flies, he sucked out my spine
Balbinattor Edzy
Brain's oming apart at the seams
this cheap slut won't leave me be, a white rubber, maybe pink?
Batman! Howya doin' brother, I can't stand smoking grass
Balbinattor's on the loose, rain beats against my ass!!
Bastard grinds, sucks so sweetly,
how high he flies, he sucked out my spine
Balbinattor Edzy
