Close your eyes and count to three
When you open them, I'll be here
I come back like a boomerang
Like a bad penny in your purse
Bart and I will unleash hell
You will spice it with your sauce
Place and money is correct
It is time to wake the demons

Close Your eyes and pray the lord
When you finish, I'll be here
I'll be gushing and spewing
Like bugs bunny and a tank in one
I'll tango in such a way
That the day will never start
Let somebody raise the curtain
We should have already begun

Wake the demons
Wake'em up
Wake the demons
Now

Close your eyes and call the monsters
When you open them, we will be here
Close them back, we will not vanish
Sorry, We've been welded together
Even if shit was raining on our heads
We'd play in one team from now on
And now tell me, the fuck
Is my shadow as drunk as I am?

Close Your eyes and pray the lord
When you finish, I'll be here
I'll be gushing and spewing
Like bugs bunny and a tank in one
I'll tango in such a way
That the day will never start
Let somebody raise the curtain
We should have already begun

Wake the demons
Wake'em up
Wake the demons
Now

I come back like boomerang
Don't you even try to hang yourself

Close your eyes and count to three
When you open them, I'll be here
I come back like a boomerang
Like a bad penny in your purse
Bart and I will unleash hell
You will spice it with your sauce
Place and money is correct
It is time to wake the demons

Wake the demons
Wake'em up
Wake the demons
Now

I come back like boomerang
Don't you even try to hang yourself
