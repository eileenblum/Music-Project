Eyy. I got the ball
Hmm... I got the line... I bend the ball, ball to the line
Oh, yeah, the ball to the line

Though you haven't got the ball

I bend the ball to the line
I bend the ball to the line!

I bend the ball, ball to the line
Oh, yeah, the ball to the line
I bend it like enchanted
I bend it 'cave I'm haunted
If you have not got the ball
Enter! And mine we will coil
You'll be absolutely pleased
What? You didn't eat meat?
