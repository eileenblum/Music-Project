There were Jennifer and Ben
But, in fact, they were ten
The ten I have never seen
Though thousands there have been

Yes, and them I did adore
As their friends from second floor
When they got uot of my sight
I was in an awful plight

Hey, Lord! What's the matter with you?
We are waiting for the miracle!

There were Jennifer and Ben
And the feeling that join them
There were Jennifer and Ben
Each of them a hooligan
There were Jennifer and Ben
And the feeling than join them
Was natural and evident
And blinding like atomic blint

Hey, Lord! What's the matter with you?
We are waiting for the miracle!
