Drown me like the great flood
The one that struck few years ago
Fill me, I want to be fat
As if I were pregnant rat
Make me a happy bastard
With his belly like a pot
Cover me with your ocean
Blow me with your wrath

Suffocate me with your size
Make me flat like model's tits
Feed me with sight
I will explode like a tnt
Fill me up with your fuel
I'm going to whirr like a diesel
Mix me with your big-sick drink
I will feel the last vertigo

That's my soul, I wanna fill
Make's me smile, let's make that deal
That's my heart, you can rape
That's my body, you can take

Fill me please with your despair
I will be deep like remorse
Sell me your every tear
Easy! I will stand the strain
Spice your anger really hot
Easy! I will never puke
Pour it slowly into me
Pour it till I'm poisoned

That's my soul, I wanna fill
Make's me smile, let's make that deal
That's my heart, you can rape
That's my body, you can take

Suffocate me with your size
Make me flat like model's tits
Feed me with sight
I will explode like a tnt
Fill me up with your fuel
I'm going to whirr like a diesel
Mix me with your big-sick drink
Bite me, eat me
Pour it slowly into me
Pour it, I'm gonna fell hot!

That's my heart, you can rape
That's my body, you can take
That's my soul, I wanna fill
Make's me smile, let's make that deal
That's my heart, you can rape
That's my body, you can take!!!
