... And the night got swollen
Bloated like a man drowned
In the river
That night I turned on no light
There was nothing to look at
The big and black one arrived
And he bit my very heart
I was not surprised by that
I did not fall any pain

... And the morning has died
And the sun got arrested
It carries a life sentence
I have never expected
I'd become an eskimo
And absolutely carelessly
I have thrown up my feeling
I have never expected
I'd become my own shadow
I have thrown up my memos
And I felt my black heart
Pumping my cold black blood

It was high time for me
To go and get a beer

Death called me late that night
She calls anytime she has a problem
Death was weeping on the phone
And I didn't know what to say
I have never expected
I'd become my own shadow
I have thrown up my memos
And I felt my black heart
Pumping my cold black blood

It was high time for me
To go and get a beer
