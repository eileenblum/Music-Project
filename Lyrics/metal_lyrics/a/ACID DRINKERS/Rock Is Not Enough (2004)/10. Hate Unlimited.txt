Gentleman. Ladies! Get gassed!
It's been always going on
Yourself why don't you, please blast?
Could you, please, kick the bucket
And keep out of my business
Sacriface yourself for the masses
This brave deed to fame will rocket

Could you drink poison, please?
And then picturesquely die?
Will you blaze on live tv
Hey people hang this man
His face seems antisocial
His nation let's enslave then
Great money is waitig there

Hey, babe, I've got a soul for sale
Start to trade. Don't stop now

You'd better dance to my tune then
And say what I want to hear
I can see no other option...
