You circle like a bloody vulture
You watch me from distance
You shoot a piercing glance
You have fucking expectations
You mutter under your breath
With your big distorted mouth
And you swear quietly when
I don't dance the way you want...

You careflly watch my hands
You're stiff like in a bloody dance
You analyze my every word
Just as a psycho. Twisted teacher
You are always stalking me
You stuck to me like a leech
And you swear quietly when
I don't dance the way you want, so...

When you say to me "Fuck You"
Say It louder...

In your mouth you have a snake
Hissing to me ear at night
And the spiders in your eyes
Crawl on my face when I sleep

When you say to me...

Your shadow is stuck to mine
Your breath blows to my feathers
And you swear quietly when
I don't dance the way you want, so...

When you say to me...
