I sit the magazine together with other bullets
And do you really think. My fate is fucked up?
I stifle in the dark chamber. I'm cramped like in an asshole
I will feel like a loser, until they fire me out!

I am a stray bullet, what do you think?
When will I reach you? I am a stray bullet!

Now I'm sitting in your skull
And the plan has been completed
I'll repeat it with no doubt
I'll devour your young heart

I sit in the rifle barrel. I'm embedded perfectly
So hard and slender too. I'm dope clean totally
I'm waiting for my kick. I'm waiting for my kick
I'm waiting for my kick. I'm waiting for my kick
Naughty boy. Where. Do you think
Will I hit you, little prick?

I am a stray bullet, what do you think?
When will I reach you? I am a stray bullet!

Now I'm sitting in your skull
And the plan has been completed
I'll repeat it with no doubt
I'll devour your young heart...
