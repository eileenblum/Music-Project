You're calling me late at night
Spasmodically breathing
You whisper to my tired Ear
An Unintillegible message
Slow!
Stone it!
F... it!
Don't creep like a pig!
You read me your last will
While you're sleeping
Your gabble is maybe charming me
But can't you see
You're drowning I tell you
You must go to bed
I don't know what I know
And I don't call a medicine man
I should know that you drown!
