The joker is funny
Joker is great
His the best in this branch
He's got the biggest pay
Country wide clown
The most stupid star
The moron of the year,
But Don't try to shoot him down
Don't talk so loud
Wall's got ears
And if you talk to loud
It costs too many tears
Don't shout so loud
I know that you are brave
But If you shout too loud
You are digging your grave! 
Everybody knows he's invisible king
He's jumping like a frog
I fell a horrible stink
You know this perfect joker 
So listen girls and boys
He's going to turn you on to obedient toys
Don't talk so loud
Wall's got ears
And if you talk to loud
It costs too many tears
Don't shout so loud
I know that you are brave
But If you shout too loud
You are digging your grave!
Stand on your head
Now eat s...
This joker is amazing
Yes, he's a real hit
He's average f...er
This man has no feelings
He has a secret hobby
This hobby is killing!
