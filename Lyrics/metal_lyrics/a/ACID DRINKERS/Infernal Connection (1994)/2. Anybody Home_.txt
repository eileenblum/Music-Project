Use your wise head
Use your wise mind
It is nothing bad... test imagination
Check your big brain
You won't feel pain
I think you won't fade, so...
Anybody home?!
I got something new which you can use
You, you got to try, I do not lie
Don't you feel bad
I can Scream help
Your face is red, maybe you wanna pray
This way isn't mine
You got to try
You will feel fine, so...
