Meet your destiny
Meet your judge
You will be free
My war is your war
Yes, your head belongs to me
Another dead nut!
Another soul to God!
Alles Raus!
Dancing in the slaughter-house
Wet hands, noise in head
Why my dreams are f...in' mad
My crime is sentence
I wait for your deadly dance
No way, I got to tell
You must look good
You will meet your God
Stand up, Wake up, bell,
Leave my home, see you in hell!
