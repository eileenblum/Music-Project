I've been down
I've found a gun
I start to fight, against...
Stand by my side,
One thing in mind
We gotta find
IQ Cyco!
Place in city
My brand new gun
Cry of dick
My laughter
Sleeping head
Sleeping Hands
Sleeping soul
IQ Cyco
Another one bites the dust
IQ Cyco
Cyco Hype
I stick it to your dead bad brain
One way, this is your finish Cyco hype
Place in space
You are my first
My brand new gun
Sick, Smile
Sleeping head
Sleeping Hands
Sleeping soul
IQ Cyco
