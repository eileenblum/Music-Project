I love this smell
I love this sound
As an napalm in the morning
I kick out the door
I look around
And I see the same faces again

Of the people who tell me
What I should do, and where I should go
The same advices to compromise
I'd rather break their necks right now !!!

With empty words, spilled over tears
Don't take me down
You're loosing your life, but wasting my time
You want take me, what I have done

I knot it
I saw it
So you can give me nothing more
I wanna lead my life alone
I love it
I feel it
So I don't need your charity
I wanna lead my life alone
You better down on your knees !!!

I love this smell
I love this sound
I hate the people destroying my plans
Maybe you think
I am insane
I don't need to act on your brain-dead advice

Loudly admitting, nobody knows it better than me
Fallowing my way stomping for years
You'll gonna crawl trying to change me
