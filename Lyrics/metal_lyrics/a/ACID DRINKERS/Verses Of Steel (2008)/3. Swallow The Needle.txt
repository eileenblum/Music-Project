Lay down !!!
Wait for injection
Everyone is curious what you gonna do...
Come down !!!
Call the reflection
About shining light - is it false of truth ???

They can give me nothing
I turn away my easy face
Show me more respect, now
Don't provoke my primal rage

Sit down !!!
Listen to the question
Every cop is looking for the rest of your crew
Come down !!!
Stop that silly action
On every TV set there's a view of you...

They can give me nothing
I turn away my easy face
Show me more respect, now
Don't provoke my primal rage

On your knees !!!
Try to freeze
Silence !!!
Smell the violence
One hit !!!
That's the rules of street

Sleep well...
Put your head down
Everybody's watching what you dream about
Wake up !!!
Talk about connections
Every local cop wants to know what you've got ???

I left my better side
Look for me in crimson lane
To stay brute is my human right
Soon they will find me insane

On your knees !!!
Try to freeze
Silence !!!
Smell the violence
One hit !!!
That's the rules of street
