Bring in front of my face:
The drunkard, the poet, the virgin's grace...
Bring the man, who saw whole world
Let him sit by my right hand

Cads - out of the door !!!
Kick the abstainers ass !!!
Bring booze and hamburgers
Widow's children be blessed !!!

Cads - out of the door !!!
Kick the abstainers ass !!!
Bring booze and hamburgers
Widow's children be blessed !!!

Hundred long nights, won't close my eyes
Start to fill this empty hole with fuel of my soul
Let's start to roll...

Man who jumped out of jail
He's lighting cigar with a ten
Tonight our reason's best
To commence to sharpen claws

My Queen - dancing to Frank
This act - burning my mind
Hey sheikh - open the tap !!!
Widow's children be blessed !!!
