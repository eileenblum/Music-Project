I've been drinking indifferently
I've been fucking indifferently
I was drunk like a death on the average
And as usually I escaped the scythe
I've been
Down indifferently
And like an average nitwit
I've been
Dreaming about comeback

Beat the drum, you morons !!!
We carry the villainy
Like they carry the Ark...
But our procession is dark

I am closed between rubber walls
In the crowd of rubber freaks
They have pumped a superbalm
In my delicate pipes

And the crowd of the freaks is rockin'
They have short and very weak tails
Freaks are ashamed of Comodo Snakes
They will jump through the bars of the cage

Beat the drum, you morons !!!
We carry the villainy
Like they carry the Ark...
But our procession is dark

Beat the drum, you morons !!!
We carry the villainy
Like they carry the Ark...
But our procession is dark
