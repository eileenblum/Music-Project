This morning the sun will
Wake earlier, you've got to come
Back, back in the darkness
Before the day will wake
They should not see you in light
I'll try to close their eyes
Don't let them catch you

The wolfs are too scared tonight
The moon and the stars will wail
Vamipers take the shower
First since one thousand years
Where is an order and law
The bard is quiet and pale
Junkie and livertine
Starting to create new being

You are not able to stop rough cut, now...
You are not able to stop rough cut, now...
You are not able to stop rough cut, now...
You are not able to stop - got to give it up...

Angry night !!! morning was so stiff...
We died before we start to live
We died before we start to live
Angry night !!! my uncommon junkie
We died before we start to live
We died before we start to live

My good god, you can see it...
You're so easy, when you smoke your cigar...
Where is the law and tradition ???
Where are the black leather shoes ???
Where is your funeral suit ???
My alb is yellow and red
Junkie and libertine
They are again starting to killing new being !!!

Angry night !!! morning was so stiff...
We died before we start to live
We died before we start to live
Angry night !!! my uncommon junkie
We died before we start to live
We died before we start to live

You are not able to stop rough cut, now...
You are not able to stop...
