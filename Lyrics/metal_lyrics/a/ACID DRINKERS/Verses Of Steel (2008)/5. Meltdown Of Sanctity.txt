Trying to be so good
You tore out god of my heart
To rule is only law
Is the only way you've got

No matter how hard you try
To change my mind
No matter how hard you fight
I won't loose my life

This empty words of prayer,
Bleeding eyes of hatred, freaks me out
Another dance of madness,
Where the saints are sinners, sightless life.

Broken morality, the meltdown of sanctity
With no humility, inside insanity

Born so pure, trying to change and defy
Broken morality, the meltdown of sanctity
After the crowd, taking easy way of life
With no humility, inside insanity.
