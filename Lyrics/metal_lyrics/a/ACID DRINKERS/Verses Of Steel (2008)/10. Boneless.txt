My spine is home...

My spine is home
Down in the basement
I don't need it here
I feel uncomfortably
When I overdress
I feel mentall mess !!!

My spine is home, in the basement
I don't need it here, I feel uncomfortably
When I overdress myself
The spine is stiff and hot like a hell

It stops many of my motions
Spine keeps me in devotion
That bone still keeps me plumb
But I like the level on the ground...

Stone in my chest - colder than ice
Terrible style
Stone in my chest, cold as an ice

I cannot rock easy
Skeleton limits my range
At least I don't need to bow
I don't need to bend for a change

And when I gotta wear it
To come in the limestone cage
I'm sitting in the bony prison
I'm looking through the bars-bones - hey

Stone in my chest - colder than ice
Terrible style
Stone in my chest, cold as an ice

Stone in my chest - colder than ice
Terrible style
Stone in my chest, cold as an ice

I'm cracking when I'm moving
I'm rattling when I'm starting to lie
I'm smoking when I'm unfaithful...
When I drink - I'm loosing style...
I keep this armour home
In special, concrete case
I keep this armour home
In special, concrete case
