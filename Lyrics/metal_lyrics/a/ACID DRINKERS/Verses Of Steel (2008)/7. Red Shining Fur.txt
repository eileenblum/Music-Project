She is a cool cat
Her fur is orange - red
Yeah the cat is so hot
On the back she's got brown dot
She lies on a floor
And her eyes are closed
And her heart is like stone
She's gonna suck you to the bone

I gotta got that animal hair
You know - I'm a collector
I'm a reincarnation of a Cherokee
I'm gonna scalp that cat - will you help me do that ???
Uuu, will you help me do that ???
Uuu, will you help me do that ???

Bring me the razor, let's scalp another one fur
I will create you, you'll be another dead star
Bring me the razor, let's scalp another one fur
I will create you, you'll be another dead star

Now I've got that red shining coat
I will use it a cashmere scarf
Yeah, that fur is wet and warm
With every minute I want in more

I am naked and I am hungry
Bring me something to wear
The hurricane won't chill my neck
Oh, throw that fur on my back...

Throw that fur on my back
Throw that fur on my back

Bring me the razor, let's scalp another one fur
I will create you, you'll be another dead star
Bring me the razor, let's scalp another one fur
I will create you, you'll be another dead star

You know - it's about 20 years
When faethers are out of the fashion
Give me the rags, you tiger
Or I'll take it by first occasion...

I am naked and I am hungry
Bring me something to wear
The hurricane won't chill my neck
Oh, throw that fur on my back...
Oh, throw that fur on my back...

Bring me the razor, let's scalp another one fur
I will create you, you'll be another dead star
Bring me the razor, let's scalp another one fur
I will create you, you'll be another dead star
