Where did your wing take you ???
You won't disappear on island...
My eyes are turned to the east
But I see the things on the west
My ears are turned to the east
But I hear the whispers of yours
The whispers of hills in the city
My eyes and ears are double 4.

When I turn my head
Black sail is creeping back
When I turn my head
Black scarf round my neck

Every fuckin' year at your birthday
I gave you darkness as gift
'cause we don't want to see the sunlight
Fuck the sunlight !!!
Our roads was bitter - is it strange ???
The road tasted so sweet
And I will find you again, will you bet ???
I'll get you...in a black sail wrapped.

When I turn my head
Black sail is creeping back
When I turn my head
Black scarf round my neck

When I turn my head
Black sail is creeping back
When I turn my head
Black scarf round my neck

And I'm still alone in my bed
Since that time I sleep without pigs
I turn my eyes on the island
I'm putting my muscle to the wing

When I turn my head
Black sail is creeping back
When I turn my head
Black sail is creeping back !!!
