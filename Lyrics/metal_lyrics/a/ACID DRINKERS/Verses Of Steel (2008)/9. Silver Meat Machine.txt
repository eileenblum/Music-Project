That old good machine
Silver meat machine
Pumping aviation oil
Aviation oil - the best

It gives a terrible kick
It's beating like a stick
When it will hit - it will kill
When it won't kill - it will whirr
Be cruel, my machine - machine - made in steel
Be cruel, my machine - machine - made in steel

I won't replace you for another one
I will not look for the other scum
Go on, go on, go on !!!
Come on - break out the storm

That old tin with a rust
Loyal pork diesel
The bolts and the rivets crushed
To drive, we need no reason !!!

An engine booms like a bell
Can you feel that hellish smell ???
When it will hit - it will kill
When it won't kill - it will whirr
Be cruel, my machine - machine - made in steel
Be cruel, my machine - machine - made in steel

I won't replace you for another one
I will not look for the other scum
Go on, go on, go on !!!
Come on - break out the storm

My meat, obese machine
Fast like a weasel
It creaks, it screams, it grinds
This brute is unkind...
When it won't kill - it will whirr
Machine - made in steel
When it won't kill - it will whirr
Machine - made in steel

I won't replace you for another one
I will not look for the other scum
Go on, go on, go on !!!
Come on - break out the storm
