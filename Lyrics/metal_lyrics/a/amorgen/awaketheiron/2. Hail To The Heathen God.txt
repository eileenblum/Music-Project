His tale began during a treacherous storm
His mother lay dead, so he fled
Only one way to run
The forest

(he) Ran to the nymphs of the forest of old
Destined for greatness, a tale to be told
He grew to a man, that none'd dare to cross
Worthy of praise, Dionysos

Sing and dance
and drink from my wine

(Hail to heathen god)
Fire, in the midst of the ring
nymphs are dancing, his name they sing
To this world, you truly are a gift of the divine,
now spread your wings, and spread your wine

Demons of the forest,
and the creatures of the woods
have gathered all around the god
to drink his mighty brew
Exalted with his people,
every man he came across
said "you're truly worth our praise"
Hail Dionysos

Hail to the heathen god

He went from hamlet to hamlet
where his words drew a crowd
He said "Bask in my glory, indulge in my wine
It's so good to be divine!"

Demons of the forest,
and the creatures of the woods
have gathered all around the god
to drink his mighty brew
Exalted with his people,
every man he came across
said "you're truly worth our praise"
Hail Dionysos

Hail to the heathen god

Sing and dance
and drink from my wine
No more praise,
let's just drink till the sun shines bright

(as he descended from the heavens
man gazed upon his drunken glory
he reigns from his mighty throne
the god of drink)
