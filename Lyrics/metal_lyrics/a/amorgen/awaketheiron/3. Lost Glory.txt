Once, I travelled land and sea, 
A warrior strong, feared was my steel. 
My name was known throughout the pits of hell 
But my glory was taken, in anguish I fell 

I fell to the blade of a knight 
His armor as black as the night 
Barely alive was my fate 
Never to rise again 

He haunts me still 
I can still feel his breath, 
Breathing down in my neck 
He left his mark on my flesh 
My honor was torn, 
My glory forever forlorn 

The battle was over, my wounds were great 
I lay there for days, but death never came 
He granted me life, a fate worse than death, 
A life full of shame, fear and regret 

I would give you my all, 
To see the black knight fall 
Stripped of his glory and fame 
Never to rise again 

It haunts me still 
I can still feel his breath, 
Breathing down in my neck 
He left his mark on my flesh 
My honor was torn, 
My glory forever forlorn
