Far beyond the mountains
lies a city, carved in stone.
It's walls hold a vengeful people,
banished long ago.

But time can not heal every wound,
this grudge won't fade away.
Hatred for the western lands,
(their blood we demand).
Centuries of desolation,
within these savage lands.
We'll bring their desecration
(they will suffer by our hands)) .

The time of revenge draws near.
We are banished (no more).
Sharpen thy axes, ready your swords,
march for glory, (prepare for war!!!

The time has come to leave our city behind,
where we were shackled for so long.
Where we bottled up our rage and fury.
Upon the heathens we will set them free.

Exile to the savage lands,
can tear one's soul apart.
Live and you'll become a man,
now go forth and take revenge.

The time of revenge draws near.
We are banished (no more).
Sharpen thy axes, ready your swords,
march for glory, (prepare for war)!!!

Bonded by our oaths of blood,
by our paints of war.
Let the war drums take control,
(The western lands must fall).
