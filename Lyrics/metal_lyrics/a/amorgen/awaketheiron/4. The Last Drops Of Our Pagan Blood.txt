The last drops of our pagan blood
flowing through the gates of time
vultures circling, hounds at the door
no prayer left for the divine

Endtime dawning on our world
spirits fleeting in the storm
darkness imprisoning our mortal earth
what once had been now lies torn

The grasp around the ancient sword
loosening grip once more
lives lost to the ancient horde
weâve reached the blackened shore

Never to see my homestead again
nor visit the lakes of my youth
my hopeful dreams lie ripped and torn
dying where once I proud stood

Beasts of burden weighing me down
when will my torment end
the loss of life yet to be mourned
from this madness I can not ascend

Embers burning in my eyes
stillborn my heart feels this night
counting seconds 'till the moment I die
no longer able to put up a fight

No prayer left for the divine
vultures, circling, hounds at the door
flowing through the gates of time
the last drops of our pagan blood...
