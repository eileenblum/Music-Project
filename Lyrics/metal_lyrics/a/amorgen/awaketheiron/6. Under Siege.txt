Sound the call to arms 
The savages are at our walls 
May your blades strike true 
The castle must not fall 

Not much is needed to defend your own, 
A sword, a shield, and some bloody backbone 
Times like these seperate the boys from the men 
Try not to die if you can 
In our hands lies our nation's honour 
Our way of the sword is tested 
Stand proud with bravery 
only part with your life when your foes lie bested 

WALLS, TORN, ASUNDER, 
KING-DOM, UNDER, 
UNDER SIEGE 

Leave the battlements, 
They have broken through the gate 
We have brought this upon ourselves 
our ways have sealed our fate. 

Show them the meaning of a painful death 
Show them annihilation 
Our city lies in flames, yet all that remains 
our soldiers elite 
In our hands lies our nation's honour 
Our way of the sword is tested 
Stand proud with bravery 
only part with your life when your foes lie bested 

WALLS, TORN, ASUNDER, 
KING-DOM, UNDER, 
UNDER SIEGE
