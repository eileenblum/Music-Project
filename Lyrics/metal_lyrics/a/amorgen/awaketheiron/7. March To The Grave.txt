As the dust fades away, 
Revealed are those, all lead astray 
Slaughtered in a battle 
For some monarchs pride. 

All these men, they were all blind. 
For war they left their homes behind. 
A warriors kin thought him strong and brave, 
But they knew he would end up dead in a shallow grave 

Kings, they wage these senseless wars, 
But commoners, they wear the scars. 
Steep is the price of victory, 
But the kings are not the one to pay this fee. 

What are the spoils of the soldiers greed. 
A shade, the faintest of memories. 
Forgotten by their loved ones, 
Lost in the sands of time. 

The children grew up without a father as guide, 
And in time they raised a kin in kind. 
But the call to arms sounds again, 
Now itâs their turn to die in vain. 

Kings, they wage these senseless wars, 
But commoners, they wear the scars. 
Steep is the price of victory, 
But the kings are not the one to pay this fee.
