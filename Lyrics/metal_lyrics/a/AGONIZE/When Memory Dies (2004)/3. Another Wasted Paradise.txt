Insanity dwell within this hell
Putridity burning life
Without any shame, others are to blame
Greed is now united to make us die

In another wasted paradise

Future is here bringing us fear
Minds becoming blind
Never to stop until last drop of blood
Collapse the only praise

In another wasted paradise

Seems like and heaven turned us back
And collided with hell
For everything that we have done
For all what we had become
