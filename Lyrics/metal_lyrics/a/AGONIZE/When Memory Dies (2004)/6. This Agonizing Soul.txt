I fed of power
That is running trough my mind and veins
Which cannot deny all the sorrow and all the pain

Can you save me
Can save me from myself
When memory turns all my love into hate

Than I don't really care
If the end of our time is came near
Because of the pain that I feel
An everlasting pain
So forever I will stay in control
Of this agonizing soul

Veil of sorrow with delight had embraced
One life that was about to be erased

Can you save me
Can save me from myself
When memory turns all my love into hate

Than I don't really care
If the end of our time is came near
Because of the pain that I feel
An everlasting pain
So forever I will stay in control
Of this agonizing soul

This soul has no solution
Destroyed by evolution
That is making human being blind repulsive kind
