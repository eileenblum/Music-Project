Before the anger comes
To embrace my being
And before the inner part of me
Just disappear

When sanity collapse
And lead me into hate
There is one moment of truth
To direct the fate

That bliss is calling my name
To show me the way
Where should I walk
This bliss is calling my name

When there is no escape
But to follow wrath
Senses disappeared
And then I am on the path

Beyond serenity
Of anger and hate
There comes that moment of truth again
Once more again

That bliss is calling my name
To show me the way
Where should I walk
This bliss is calling my name
