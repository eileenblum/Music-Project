Before your love now I chose hate
Before embrace, to die fate
And perennial silence

You ever-changing from of life
Behind million faces now you hide
All you do is built upon a lie

Your end now is near
Soon and you will taste fear
My revenge is close
I hear it call my name
In this repulsive prose
My hate remains the same

My eyes had never seen
That much hypocrisy
And perennial violence

You ever-changing from of life
Behind million faces now you hide
All you do is built upon a lie

Your end now is near
Soon and you will taste fear
My revenge is close
I hear it call my name
In this repulsive prose
My hate remains the same

How far will this go
It is useless to pray
All is evil, with nothing good to say
