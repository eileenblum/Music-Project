I am away from all oblivious matters
With all remembrances that are feeding my life
Just go away, with all your disgusting patterns
Of immortality that are just burning the sense...

Of something that can't be undone - the past
That still lives inside
Hidden within the mind
Directing our future with hands made of hope

Hope is all around us
And all we need to do is to give her embrace
Never to stop, thinking of days behind us
Never trying to hide the true face...

Of something that can't be undone - the past
That still lives inside
Hidden within the mind
Directing our future with hands made of hope

But still we wonder 'till when
With every breath
With every step we take
Awaiting for immortality to come

But do we know
That our existence is becoming a lie
From the moment of truth
When memory dies...
