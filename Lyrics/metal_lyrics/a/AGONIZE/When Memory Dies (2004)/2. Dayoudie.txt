There will be retribution
That will come out from deep within
There is just no solution
To justify your sins

Without the words you speak
Your eyes are telling story that you deny
Soon you will choke in your lie

Behind of your insanity
And all your loud silence
Lies a spark of clean humanity
To hunt you until the dayoudie

Don't try to hold your breath
'Cause sooner or later the air will come inside
You will be facing death
In victory you'll die

Same story is with truth
You hide it, but it will be brought to light again
Lies affirming the sin

Behind of your insanity
And all your loud silence
Lies a spark of clean humanity
To hunt you until the dayoudie
