I can't deny all the hatred that I feel
When I look in your eyes
I cannot lie, because some wounds will never heal
The hate is now my praise
That I got from you

But it will never tear me apart
This hate is now my guide
Throughout these hollow times
It is now my path, my precious wrath

You give me fear, and you tried to break my mind
You devastated truth
You give me tears so I could cry out of my eyes
You bastards are made out of lies

You'll never tear me apart
This hate is now my guide
Throughout these hollow times
It is now my path, my precious wrath
