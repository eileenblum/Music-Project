In this world of vanity
Prejudice and fragile smiles
Evergreen insanity
Is forcing us to (mentally) die

Suffering is destiny
Of millions, of millions
Now all purity is gone

So if you await enlightenment
It will become just waste of time
If you await enlightenment
Than your mind is blind

In this world of vanity
Prejudice and fragile smiles
Suffering is destiny
For all, all of us

So if you await enlightenment
It will become just waste of time
If you await enlightenment
Than your mind is blind
