Now I am calling nature
Asking her for forgiveness
For all the sins that I have done
And to ask her question why

Truth always hurts
And innocents are paying the price
Who is the one to judge
Who will live and who will die

Why freedom is sin why it hurts
Is perpetual demise
Becoming our only truth

Where did all beauty gone
And where are all those that I love
Is story of father - son
And from you forlorn

Why freedom is sin why it hurts
Is perpetual demise
Becoming our only truth

Now wherever the dark is near
It reminds me to a long time dormant fear
Because it have a stench of truth
Repulsive images raped youth

Truth always hurts
And innocents are paying the price
Who is the one to judge
Who will live and who will die

Why freedom is sin why it hurts
Is perpetual demise
Becoming our only truth

Now I am calling nature
Asking her for forgiveness
For all the sins that I have done
Forgive me I am your son
