Her knees have lost its skin to the ground. The water cleanses, washes away
their every sin. The wooden floor hurts the open wounds âI have faith that his
eyes are resting on me, his kingdom will comeâ. A tender voice reaches the
dream she was caught by again. âWe need to get away from here, no one will save
us from each other!â From each other!
We are the pigs so kill us or be trembled by reason. We are the wolves that
will not let you touch our hearts. There will be people like you for many more
years, it seems weâre stuck in evolution and weâre slowly drowning. Itâs our
duty to take care of our freedom, itâs the greatest gift we got. Itâs our life,
itâs my freedom. All this time, all my life. I believe in world where we have
opened our eyes.
