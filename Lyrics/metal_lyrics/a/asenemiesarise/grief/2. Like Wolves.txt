A simple gift wonât do the trick anymore. Those kids need more than you can
offer!
Itâs greed and jealousy that keeps their fires burning.
Brief times of happiness and no more contentment.
(âI want it all!â) It seems the world is spinning in a pace we canât keep up
with.
This is where the blessed parade. The sight of you gasping for breath.
You did everything to make the headlines but instead you ran right into
rejection.
You will have everything but me!
Hordes of the lost have seen the beacon that leads them.
The light is brighter than their eyes can handle.
Wandering around in a city that revolves around them.
You will have everything but me.
