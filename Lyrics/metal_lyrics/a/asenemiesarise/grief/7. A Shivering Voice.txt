A mild breeze lifted the curtains. The smoke entered my lungs. Burned
photographs escaped through the open windows into the night sky.
The flames couldnât burn away my past, it only made my shadows leap higher. And
for a while it felt like every sound disappeared. This world is not my own and
that will never change.
There is that breeze again, this time it took me away, my body felt lifted from
the surface. Too long too cowardice.
And thatâs when I felt the arms around me. She pulled me back.
