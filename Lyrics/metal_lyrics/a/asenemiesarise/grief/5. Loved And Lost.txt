A shout echoes through the hallway âhow can we live like thisâ. It has been
months since we had food in our stomachs.  The mother, she gathered, her
children in a single room, âhold on to another letâs keep you warm tonightâ.
The streets today, now count more houses and more rubble, then families. The
snowfall has covered every tree and every river.  My child, no storm can keep
us parted. You are the only thing that kept me alive.

So far away, between a liar and his loved ones.  Heâs writing his letters in a
low candlelight. His hand is shaking, his mouth so dry, The cold sweat on his
forehead makes him shiver And the man starts to cry and the man starts to cry.
More tears then ink tell his story.
Running back, as fast as his legs could take him, would leave him dead
