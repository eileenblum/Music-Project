He knows the grudge he harbors, and what itâs doing to him. âThose waves of
whiskey will always crash down on youâ. Searching for guidance, he tripped over
every stone. âDo what you have toâ. A soft womanâs voice sounds from the
speakers. She tells him homeâs just a minute away, homeâs just a minute away.
And he stares right at his home, dimmed lights, no one awaits him.
Come at ease and let it rest, he hears himself scream. âAm I the only one, used
up pushed aside â. Heâs not the easiest fellow âI canât sleep, I canât sleep, I
canâtâ. Away he goes with his eyes closed shut a heart unfilled. âI might not
be a winner, but Iâm sure as hell not a coward, Iâm not afraid to dieâ.
