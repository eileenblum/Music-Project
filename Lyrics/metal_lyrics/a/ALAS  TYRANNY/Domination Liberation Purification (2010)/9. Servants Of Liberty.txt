I am awake now
The spirit conquers, the hero guides
You will be vanquished
My fused soul, the alliance

My ambition, the hero's pride
No virtue is an island
United as one we will prevail
This heartless evil will be destroyed

[Chorus:]
Fighting now, for our dying cause
We are servants of liberty
The ancient evil dies tonight
And we will be set free
Fighting now, for our dying cause
The enemy of your lost religion
Your callous heart, your crime undone
We are servants of liberty

Hatred for your vile hearts
Fuels me in my determination
My spirit is gone, the victim is worthless
My days are numbered, my time is short
The battle rages, I will fight on
I am invincible!

You are done
I will be victorious
You are done
I make my last stand!

[Chorus]

I will fight!

I will destroy you -- landing blow by blow
We retaliate -- A split attack by two
My armor cracking -- My hateful fire burns you
Your terrible decay -- Deflected by my shining resolve

I banish you to hell; my sorcery can not be countered
We disbelieve you and your illusion falters
United in twin resolve - dual attacks, your downfall
Now we strike at the heart of darkness

Fighting now, for our righteous cause
We are servants of liberty
The ancient evil has died tonight
And we are finally free
Fighting now, for our righteous cause
The enemy of your lost religion
Your callous heart, your crime undone
We are servants of liberty
