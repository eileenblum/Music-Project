What have I done, this can't be right
Am I evil, in doing good?
Ignorance, may be my shield
I did as I was told
Condemned: is that my role? Mercy: I deserve none...
These crimes are mine alone

Was I deceived?

You belong to me, under my control
The spirit of aggression won't let go
Sacred orders, hatred abounds
With holy zeal we'll tear you down

I need guidance, perfect moral light
To steel my mind
I am bound to my path
I am weak and powerless
I am bound to the rails
Please save me

Can it be true? Can I be destroyed
By inaction...?

I need a savior
Please show yourself

I need your strength...
