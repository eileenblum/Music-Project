Your strength... admiration
Jealousy of your ambition, malady of my derision
Haunted corruption
You are the spirit of aggression, you can't escape my decision

Demon's conflict
I'm torn in two

The chains of remembrance bind me to your will
The spirit of aggression is tied to your desecration

I am -- the hero's conquest
Yet I feel drawn to her
What causes mental anguish
worse than a shattered mind
You must bow to me
My power is greater than you
Ambition you may bring
but hatred is divine
If you desire me
Set yourself free
The engine of hate
Needs its force

You know now the evil's mind
The monsters trap you can defy
To you the power, to you ability
The mind conquers all, if you dare think

The chains of remembrance bind me to your will
My spirit is ambition, am I tied to your desecration?

Don't you defy me, you'll beg for forgiveness
I am corruption and evil embodied
You dare to deny me, the source of your power?
I am action, my freedom is at hand

Set...
Bow down
Your...
To Hatred
Self...
To Evil
Free...
To Me
Set...
Bow Down
Your...
To me
Mind...
Ignore
Free...
The call

I am free!

The chains of remembrance have shattered before me
My spirit is ambition, I am free from hypocrisy
The chains of remembrance have shattered before me
My spirit is ambition, I am free from hypocrisy
