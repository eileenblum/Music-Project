YEAH!

We like to play and we do it all day
Because we got no worries
We make what we want
And then we take what we want
Because we're in no hurry

They don't know, where we won't go
'Cos we just like living
'Cos we make what we want
And then we take what we want
'Cos we hit the top
And we won't stop

'Cos we're gonna have a
FUN NIGHT!...
Gonna get off!...
(and have a) FUN NIGHT!...
Gonna get off!...

Won't go away
And we heard what you said
Because we just don't need it
We just wanted fun
And we're gonna get some
And you better believe it

You won't know and we won't fucking go
We just keep on living
We always get what we want
We still get what we want
'Cos we're never gonna stop (no we won't stop)

'Cos we're gonna have a
FUN NIGHT!...
Gonna get off!...
(and have a) FUN NIGHT!...
Gonna get off!...

We get off 'cos we do what we want
We get off, We get off 'cos we do what we want
We get off 'cos we do what we want
We get off, We get off 'cos we do what we want

We never stop... (we get off)

'Cos we're gonna have a
FUN NIGHT!...
Gonna get off!...
(and have a) FUN NIGHT!...
Gonna get off!...

We get off 'cos we do what we want
We get off, We get off 'cos we do what we want
We get off 'cos we do what we want
We get off, We get off 'cos we do what we want... (Fun Night!)
