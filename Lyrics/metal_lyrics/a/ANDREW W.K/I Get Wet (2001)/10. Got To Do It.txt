You gotta keep up
You gotta keep going...
No you never let down
You gotta keep going
You gotta keep up
You gotta keep going

I went around the place where we once went before
But I never knew it hurt so bad
I wandered back again, but you just slammed the door
I never knew it hurt so bad

We were nothing but kids on top
Never gonna stop
We never let down
We gotta keep up
Keep our heads on 'high'
Never gonna die
'Cos we gotta keep it alive

When you're down on your luck
You gotta do it
'Cos you can't get enough
You gotta do it
You never give up (NO!)
You got to do it
Gotta do all the stuff that you love (no more turning)

When you're down on your luck
You gotta do it
And you're covered in mud
You gotta do it
You still going on (YEAH!)
You got to do it
Gotta do all the stuff that you love

You gotta keep up
You gotta keep going...
No you never let down
You gotta keep going
We gotta keep up
We gotta keep going

But you left me down so many times and took me back
But I'll never turn around again
And now my life is back
I'm back on the track
And I'll never burn it down again, No

'Cos we were nothing but kids on top
Never gonna stop
We never let down
We gotta keep up
Keep our heads on 'high'
Never gonna die
'Cos we gotta keep it alive

When you're down on your luck
You gotta do it
'Cos you can't get enough
You gotta do it
You never give up (NO!)
You got to do it
Gotta do all the stuff that you love (no more turning)

When you're down on your luck
You gotta do it
And you're covered in mud
You gotta do it
You still going on (YEAH!)
You got to do it
Gotta do all the stuff that you love (no more turning)

When you're down on your luck
You gotta do it
'Cos you can't get enough (YEAH!)
You got to do it
You never give up (NO!)
You got to do it
Gotta do all the stuff that you... Love
