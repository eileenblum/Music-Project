People started killing wherever she goes

When she comes she's a red hot set of lips
And when she comes and you just don't know
She won't try and stop you
But she'd go and kick you when you're down on the ground
She just disapoints you
Even though you give it everything you can (all that you can)
You've got to make her understand
That you are a man

(You dont stop!)
She gets what she wants
(You dont stop!)
She gets what she needs
(You dont stop!)
I get what I need
(You dont stop!)
I need your love

You don't stop when they're taking your love (girls own love)
You don't stop when they're making your love (girls own love)
You don't stop when girls own love (girls own love)
You don't stop when girls own love

People started killing wherever she goes

She gets off without you
And when you get it up
She's a puttin' you down
She won't try and stop you
But she'd go and kick you when you're down on the ground
She just disappoints you
Even though you give it everything you can (all that you can)
You've got to make her understand
That you are a man

(You dot stop!)
She gets what she wants
(You dont stop!)
She gets what she needs
(You dont stop!)
I get what I need
(You dont stop!)
I need your love

You don't stop when they're taking your love (girls own love)
You don't stop when they're making your love (girls own love)
You don't stop when girls own love (girls own love)
You don't stop when girls own love
