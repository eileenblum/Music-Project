This is your time to Pay,
This is your Judgement Day.
We made a Sacrifice,
And now we get to take your life.
We shoot without a Gun,
We'll take on Anyone.
It's really nothing new,
It's just a thing we like to do.

[Chorus]
You'd better get Ready to Die,
(Get ready to Die).
You'd better get Ready to Kill,
(get ready to Kill).
You'd better get Ready to Run,
Coz,
Here we come.
You'd better get Ready to Die,
(Get Ready to Die).

Your life is over now,
Your life is running out.
When your time is at an End,
Then it's time to Kill again.
We Cut without a Knife,
We live in Black and White.
You're just a Parasite,
Now close you're eyes and say Good Night.

[Chorus]
You'd better get Ready to Die,
(Get ready to Die).
You'd better get Ready to Kill,
(get ready to Kill).
You'd better get Ready to Run,
Coz,
Here we come.
You'd better get Ready to Die,
(Get Ready to Die).
You'd better get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die.
You'd better get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die.
You'd better get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to Die,
Get Ready to...
If we're not,
Not coming,
Then you better get Running,
And you'd better get Ready to Die.
