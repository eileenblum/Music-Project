I never knew Girls existed like you,
But now that I do,
I'd really like to get to know you.

[Pre-Chorus]
The Girl's too Young,
She don't need any better.
Its all coming back,
Can't you feel it.
The Girl's too Young,
She don't know any better.
Its all coming back,
Can't you feel it.

[Chorus]
She is Beautiful,
(She is Beautiful).
She is Beautiful,
(She is Beautiful).
The Girl is Beautiful.

You're giving me moves and hints from all sides,
And when you hit like that you melt my eyes.

[Pre-Chorus]
The Girl's too Young,
She don't need any better.
Its all coming back,
Can't you feel it.
The Girl's too Young,
She don't know any better.
Its all coming back,
Can't you feel it.

And though I never know you,
I look at your face.
To tell you that I love you,
Don't know what to say.
I give everything I got to the Beautiful Girl,
The Only Thing I live for in the Whole Wide World.

[Chorus]
She is Beautiful,
(She is Beautiful).
She is Beautiful,
(She is Beautiful).
The Girl is Beautiful.

I ain't got nothing to lose,
(Nothing to Lose).
gonna throw it away,
and talk to you.
(She looks Good) She looks Good,
(And it's True) And it's true.
The Girl is Beautiful,
She is Beautiful.
I ain't got nothing to lose,
(Nothing to Lose).
I'm only living one time,
And I want you.
(She looks Good) She looks Good,
(And it's True) And it's true.
The Girl is Beautiful,
She is Beautiful.

[Chorus]
She is Beautiful,
(She is Beautiful).
Na na na na na na na na
She is Beautiful,
(She is Beautiful).
Na na na na na na na na
The Girl is Beautiful.
She is Beautiful,
(She is Beautiful).
Na na na na na na na na
She is Beautiful,
(She is Beautiful).
Na na na na na na na na

I ain't got nothing to lose,
(Nothing to Lose).
gonna throw it away,
and talk to you.
(She looks Good) She looks Good,
(And it's True) And it's true.
The Girl is Beautiful,
She is Beautiful.
I ain't got nothing to lose,
(Nothing to Lose).
And i'll never forget
When I saw you.
(She looks Good) She looks Good,
(And it's True) And it's true.
The Girl is Beautiful,
She is Beautiful.
