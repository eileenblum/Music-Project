Aaaah

You,
You work all night,
And when you work you dont feel alright.
And when,
When things stop feeling alright,
(ALRIGHT),
Then everything is alright.

[Pre-Chorus]
Coz,
We will never listen your rules,
(NO)
We will never do as others do,
(NO)
Do what we want and we'll get a Front View,
Do what we like and we like what we do!

[Chorus]
So,
Lets get a Party goin',
(LETS GET A PARTY GOING)
Now its time to Party and we'll Party Hard.
(PARTY HARD)
Lets get a Party goin',
(LETS GET A PARTY GOING)
When its time to Party,
We will always Party Hard!
PARTY HARD [x16]

YEAAAAHHHH!!

Alright!
You,
You worked that night.
And when you party you feel alright.
But when,
(BUT WHEN)
When things start feeling alright,
(ALRIGHT)
Then Everything is alright.

[Pre-Chorus]
Coz,
We will never listen your rules,
(NO)
We will never do as others do,
(NO)
Do what we want and we'll get a Front View,
(WE)
Do what we like and we like what we do!

[Chorus]
Lets get a Party goin',
(LETS GET A PARTY GOING)
Now its time to Party and we'll Party Hard.
(PARTY HARD)
Lets get a Party goin',
(LETS GET A PARTY GOING)
When its time to Party,
We will always Party Hard!
PARTY HARD [x23]
