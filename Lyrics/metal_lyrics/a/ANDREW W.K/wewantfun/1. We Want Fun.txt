["Jackass: The Movie" Soundtrack]Well if we had our own willing way to go
You'd be doing things, and hoping there's antidote!
When we saw that we'd give you it all!
we're thinkin' you're a lady, yankin' our chains an' all!

We can get a try!
We can get a try!
with a 1, 2, 3
You'd be startin' to drown!
We can clear the floor
We'd give you a bangin'
ladies and gentlemen do it together!

We want you to give us something more...
You have to lay down on us!
We want us to get up off the floor...
Don't ever lay down on it!
We don't want to ever live or die!
We gotta get out we can make it today
you gotta HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! make it today!

We want fun and you better believe it!
We want fun 'cos we desperately need it!
We want fun, but you don't understand...
... you gotta HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! make me a man!

We want fun and you better believe it!
We want fun either take it, or leave it!
We want fun, and we're gonna get pasted!
We want to have fun, and we want to get wasted!

When we had the time of our life
We'd hook up with the gang and take you through!
Then you'd be in the back of our van
Mum and dad started gettin' real bad!

We want you to give us something more...
You have to lay down on us!
We want us to get up off the floor...
Don't ever lay down on it!
We don't want to ever live or die!
We gotta get out we can make it today
you gotta HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! make it today!

We want fun and you better believe it!
We want fun 'cos we desperately need it!
We want fun, but you don't understand...
... you gotta HEY! HEY! HEY! HEY! make me a man!

We want fun 'cos we medically need it!
We want fun either take it, or leave it!
We want fun, and we're gonna get pasted!
We want to have fun, and we want to get wasted!

We want pie, want pie, want fun YEAH!
What do we want? What do we want?
We want fun, want pie, want fun YEAH!
What do we want? What do we want?
We want fun, want pie, want pie YEAH!
What do we want? We know what we want!
We want pie, want pie, want pie!
We want to have fun, and we want to get wasted!
