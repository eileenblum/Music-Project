I
I am alike
A lot like you
Oh, like you

I do what I want
And I want you
Oh, want you

I learned all that I need to know
To understand I love you so
You get me, I get you, we get us

I can't explain it anymore
I'm not too young to know for sure
You get me, I get you, we get us

I didn't know what I was
Didn't know what I wanted from love
But now I know that I'm right
Even if you won't have me, I don't care.

Because I'm
Really in love
Really in love
I am falling really in love

Really in love
Really in love
I am falling really in love

In love
When I'm saying your name
In love
Know it's not the same
In love
I'm down on my knees
Please don't go

You... you live alone
And I do too
I really really really really want you

You've got no things you need to say
The love I have won't go away
You get me, I get you, we get us

I didn't know what I was
Didn't know what I wanted from love
But now I know that I'm right
Even if you won't have me, I'll keep trying

Cause I'm
Really in love
Really in love
I am falling really in love

Really in love
Really in love
I have fallen really in love

In love
When you're saying my name
In love
Know it's not the same
In love
I'm down on my knees
Please, please, please
