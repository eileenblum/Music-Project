Had the power on full
And a reason to run
Learned a little bit slow
But it's better than none

Learned a little bit slow
But at least we had fun

Looking out on the lot
Driving over the dance
Riding up to the top
Bringing lunch in advance

Riding up to the top
Bringing all that I can

If you only do good
And you figure it out
If I do what I should
If I do it all now

Don't be waiting for luck
Find a way to do more
Are we doing this?
What are we doing this for?
Because we can...

Before the end of our lives
The end of our lives
The end of our lives
Before the end of our lives, oh

There were days that I stole
But I also got robbed
So I made a mission my goal
And a vision my job

Made a mission my goal
But the vision got lost

If you only do good
And you figure it out
If I do what I should
If I do it all now

Don't be waiting for luck
Find a way to do more
Are we doing this?
What are we doing this for?

To love the times we have
To like what makes us sad
To live when others die
To lose and say goodbye
To last until our moment comes

But it isn't over
You know it isn't over
You know it isn't over
You know it isn't over
You know it isn't done

Before the end of our lives
The end of our lives
The end of our lives
Before the end of our lives, oh

Just because this life ain't easy
Doesn't make it bad

It isn't over
It can't be over
Be glad
