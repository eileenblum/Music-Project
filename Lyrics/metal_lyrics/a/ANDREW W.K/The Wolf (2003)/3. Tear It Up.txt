And if any last one of you ever likes to be part of this war, part of it, you get out, you get out, you get out, one two oh,

I met a lot of friends who were cool
But a lot of them were jerks
And when I found about the trouble I was causing
It only made me act even worse.

I played a lot of horrible songs
Yeah, a lot of them were bad
And when I listen back to the way I used to play,
It only made me even more mad

I used to take what I wanted for free
I only ever saw what I wanted to see
We were jerks, we were bad and that's all I ever wanted to be.

Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up
Tear It Up all night
Tear It Up up up up up up up
Tear It Up Tear It Up all right
Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up
Tear It Up all night
Tear It Up up up up up up up
Tear It Up Tear It Up all right.

Come on, you've got none, you want it
you cant give in, you get out, you're bad come on.

I never cared much about rules
And I did what I wanted in school
I hung out on my own, I went it alone
And I probably really looked like fool

But I did it like I'm top of the rope,
And I'll do it like I'm top of the rope.
Until I let go, until I let go,
I'll always tear it up on my own.

Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up
Tear It Up all night
Tear It Up up up up up up up
Tear It Up Tear It Up all right
Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up
Tear It Up all night
Tear It Up up up up up up up
Tear It Up Tear It Up all right.

Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up
Tear It Up all night
Tear It Up up up up up up up
Tear It Up Tear It Up all right
Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up Tear It Up
Tear It Up all night
Tear It Up up up up up up up
Tear It Up Tear It Up all right
