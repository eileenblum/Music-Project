Life's too short
So do what you want
I've said it before and I'll say it again
So everyone just do what you want

People will laugh, and tell you to mop
People will call, and here come the cops
It's all beaten up and going to town
You did what you could, and put the ball out of bounds.

I'm totally stupid
totally stupid
totally stupid.

People don't like
What you do
Give them what they want
Give them what they have
Give them what they are
And they should

People don't care
They tell you what to do
Do what we can
And put the ball out of bounds
And we dig deep pulling out
Out of the ground

I'm totally stupid
I'm totally stupid
I'm totally stupid
I'm totally stupid
Totally stupid
Totally stupid
I'm totally stupid

Would you give up all you want
To keep the things you got
To keep the things you got

And would you give up all you got
To get the things you want
To get the things you want

All the things we want are here
We have to face our fear
We have to face our fear.

When we look into the future
To the place we haven't gone
See what we haven't done
We have known it all along

If we wait until tomorrow
Will tomorrow ever come?
This is where we're coming from
And we're not the only ones

When we find ourselves in trouble
We can find ourselves a way
You can find a place to stay
And the place is always safe

If you have a heart that's in pain
Don't be afraid
You're not to blame
There's a better world inside of us
Where we always thought it was
You don't need to hide
You can open up your eyes

And you'll discover
That there is another, world
