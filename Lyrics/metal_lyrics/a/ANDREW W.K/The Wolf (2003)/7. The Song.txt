Do you really want to go down now?
Do you really want to know where I've been when I go out?
Can you understand what I'm feeling?
And do you understand what it means, man?

When you here the sound
Feels just like a pleasure
And when you hear the sound and you know
We're coming for the sound
Don't ever stop the pleasure
Remember what it's like coming down
And don't stop singing the song

That's what we said, we said

Don't ever stop the song
You can never stop, singing your song
Singing it loud and you're singing it long
And you can never stop
No, never stop, the song

You don't know that sound when it feels bad.
And you lost what you knew So you took what they had
Now you try to take it from others
But try and mess with us and you'll suffer brother!

When you here the sound
Feels just like a pleasure
And when you hear the sound and you know
We're coming for the sound
Don't ever stop the pleasure
Remember what it's like coming down
And don't stop singing the song

That's what we said, we said

Don't ever stop the song
You can never stop, singing your song
Singing it loud and you're singing it long
And you can never stop
No, never stop, the song
