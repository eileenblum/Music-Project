You walked out on your best
But you knew they would never pass the test
They mess your life around
But your life's taking their life
Taking them down

And you never give it up
When they stab you in your back
Because their backs are going to break when you go
So you jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump
They're not going to hurt you anymore

You never give it up
Give it up give it up
No you never give it up
You don't
And you jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump
You're going to have to make it on your own

They just took your last friend
But you knew they would get theirs in the end
You put their lies behind
'Cause your life's taking their life, making them fry

And you never give it up
When they stab you in your back
Because their backs are going to break when you go
So you jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump
They're not going to hurt you anymore

You never give it up
Give it up give it up
No you never give it up
You don't
And you jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump
You're going to have to make it on your own
