I'm longing for silence
I feel like sinking in it
To escape from life
Which like death
Precedes me in every step of mine
It is an imperious desire like the song of sweet muses
Everyone succumbs to its charm

Silence shrouds and shields me
It fills up my lonliness
I will ride the waves of wind
In order to fly far away

I will remain alone
Nagging is the noise of melancholic memories
Like a crown of thorns
It has laid down on my heart
Its screams of pain resound in my mind

Soft silence
Lymph of my reflections
Nektar of my thoughts
Inspirer of my most hidden dreams of escape.
