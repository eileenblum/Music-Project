From damp and beating abysses of oblivion I'm born again,
from a viscid and filthy larva I open my wings
and by fraud I will surround you too,
I struggle convulsively.
The blood flows and you only want...
...to see it flowing awaiting for my help.
From damp and beating abysses of oblivion I'm born again,
from a viscid and filthy larva I open my wings.
Why do you suffocate me?
You hiss me in vain
When you have invoked me.
I will be your salvation
And your damnation,
as if I were your god!
Why you suffocate me?
You hiss me in vain,
when you have invoked me.
And the shouts of fame
Will be heartrending barkings,
I will lacerate his heart
But you will savour the pleasure;
always asking more and more.
Every new dawn
will be the delirious agony of mind.
You called me from the deepest abyss of soul.
Unware of how hugely beautiful and ravenous I was
My freedom will be its detention
And finally will be able to...
...see it be in its death agony.
Its blood so warm.
You have never belived it.
Why do you suffocate me?
You hiss me in vain
when you have invoked me.
I will be your salvation
And your damnation,
as if I where your god!
And here is the last rite
With which you will savour the nektar of life!
From a viscid and filthy larva I open my wings
And by fraud I will surround you too
I struggle convulsively.
The blood flows and you only want...
...to see it flowing awaiting for my help.
From damp and beating abysses of oblivion I'm born again,
from a viscid and filthy larva I open my wings.
I will fall again into the eternal sleep untill a new call
And by the following twilight
more filthy and powerful,
I will rise from the death,
devouring human certainties
of life and death.
