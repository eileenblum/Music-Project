Awake
As a poisoned  present
A statue carved in jade
The stone that steals the hearts
From unfaithfuls
Dethrones your kings

Look at me
And feel the pain
Mixing with the taste of blood
How the arrows of time
Tear every second apart and
Invoke the dawn

Have you seen how the moon lies to us?
Listen the howls of despair

What will you do
Without the crown of pity?
You'll have to fall and crawl again
It will guide you, the taste of sin,
Through the path of solitude

To disappear when we love
And become a shadow
That will dissipate

A nightmare invoked
In a sun that has died...
