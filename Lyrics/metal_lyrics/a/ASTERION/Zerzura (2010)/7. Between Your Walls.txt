Shadows rise beneath your feet
Endless torture
I feel the flame of dawn
Embracing a dreamless night

Desperately
The forbidden fruit dampens my lips
Reveals the secrets of a paradise
Forged by the desire of an infinite time
Face to face
Yearning disappears

I have seen wolves howl at the moon
Reclaiming freedom
Their tears flow like rain
Moisten my soul after each battle against solitude
Spirits sink into my wildest form

My breathing became the nightly pulse
A wandering song about the end
Between those two cold hands
That caress the memory,
The mystery of  your birth
The Silence inside

My desire,
Death was forged by your will
When the sun gave us the first dusk
And the night was forever crowned

Carnivorous winds
Carry me deep into
The eerie wealth of certain death
Beyond the labyrinth's threshold

I will finally rest once between your walls

Our memories are replaced
With infected tears and a taste, oh, so bitter
This is Nowhere
A place where only dreams prevail
A place where nightmares are our parables
That we somehow decipher
In the depths of despair
