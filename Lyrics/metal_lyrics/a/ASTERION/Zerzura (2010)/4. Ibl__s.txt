Darkness calls
Enveloped in your cloak
I shall never bow before a Clay man

I am Fire
Breeder of your sins and pain
Sneaking whisperer in the hearts of men

Wind-curved sand hills
Landscapes of your misery
My burning realm of mirage wealth

The wind that scatters
Recalls
What the future was made for

I walk stealthy through these hallways
Invoking with my dual tongue
The wonders of a virgin kingdom
Endless wishes
Curse what the Gehenna will not grant
Because of my wreath

The wandering being shall walk with shivering steps
While his fears will be reflected every night
On a moon abandoned, left on her own

I will hold your back with my claws
Stimulate your heartbeats
Wishes, sins will crown your victories
I'll announce your soul her doom
Bodies return to the original dust
My hands will write with cloves the future

I will seduce with sneaking movements
The tree of life to grow the fruit of my will
Feel my taste, the nectar of my tears
Poison you souls with lies
Feel the pain, the woe and the fear
I'm the eye-stealer crow
