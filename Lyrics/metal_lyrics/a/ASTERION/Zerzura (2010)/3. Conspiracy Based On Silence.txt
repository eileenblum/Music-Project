All histories resumed in a verse
Are prayers that were not heard
By the insane past
That saw us fall

Decaying before an awful sight
The sun cries for us all
As death will at last
Rule in our hearts

Winds
Turn into mourning storms
They carry me like dry leaves to dispel the autumn

Conspiracy based on silence
Destroys softly our hopes
Devours our roots
I close my eyes, where brimstone tainted tears are born
They Recall the beginning
Back to the very doorway of Asterion's labyrinth

Remember once more your astral insanity
And spawn your doom
Remember your origin
You've played with the dagger of sin
As you heard the Declaiming of
Luciferian verses that your tongue has never met
Because you're afraid
