For years I struggled through starless nights! Sheer endless darkness Sheer endless fights! I've lost my vision! I've lost my way! 
No colours, no light! Who took the sky away? 
This journey was a long one without an aim ahead! 
I found myself down on my knees in conversation with the dead! Begging for an answer 
to the question of life Begging for pain 
to prove if I'm dead or still alive!
