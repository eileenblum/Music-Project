Oh father tell me 
about the sun 
about the universe 
and why we did what we have done! 
Oh father show me 
the way to go 
the way to do things right 
like our people did long time ago! 

Why do we speak 
while we have nothing to say? 
And why do we behave 
like we were gods, day by day? 
Reflect what we are 
relearn to believe what you feel 
Reject what they preached 
and return to what's pure and real! 

I wish you could see 
that this world is a place of energy! 
A realm of wisdom, 
a place of light, a shining fire through the night!
