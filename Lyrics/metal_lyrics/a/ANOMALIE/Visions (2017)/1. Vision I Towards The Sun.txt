Read the signs within the fires! 
Feel their message deep inside! Hear the voices of those shadows and hear their songs across the night! 
We are nothing but flying sparks, 
small lights thrown into the void. 
A gleam of hope, where darkness prevails! 
Some came to remember, some came to forget Some came to burn... to burn what they regret! And while the moon soon lays to rest 
We will stay to give our best, 
to do what must be done 
to guide our friends towards the sun! 
Incende quod adorasti, adora quod incendisti!
