Soundlessly a shadow lies at my feet 
A silent companion, the only friend I need 
At a place like this, concealed and full of strength I wish that you could see what no one can but me! 
I was given just one second 
To decide to leave or to stay 
As this path knows no return 
So I made my choice and I passed this way With every step 
Another burden of the past 
Grew pale, just faded away 
Released my heart towards the end of the day! 
It feels like I'm dreaming Like the day conquered the night! Every single stigma Covered in guiltless white. The grey old river congealed in all its dignity Completes this blink of perfection before I find myself ...again!
