Sometimes in my dreams 
I see the lands that I once called home I see eyes full of joice 
full of undiluted hope! Sometimes in my dreams 
it takes my breath away 
to hear the whisper of the winds telling what no one else could say! 
Reflections of old 
manifest the transience 
of all that I behold 
of all that once was told! 
I tried to clutch 
what I've lost long time ago 
what haunts my soul 
when I close my eyes and let my mind go! 
A monument that I can't touch 'cause it's too great to reach A monument that I cannot see 'cause it's too wide to percieve. 
Sometimes in my dreams 
I see the lands that I once called home I see eyes full of joice 
full of undiluted hope! Sometimes in my dreams 
it takes my breath away 
to hear the whisper of the winds telling what no one else could say!
