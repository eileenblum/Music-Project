I â the wanderer 
a nomad of the other side 
transmitter of old secrets 
roaming through the tides 

I âthe warrior 
the shield for the weak 
I call the ancient ones 
The spirits within, the ghosts of the past 
oh, deliver us from sin! 

This is my sacrifice 
invoking the forces beyond 
The fire's burning deep inside 
In the name of life, for those I've lost, I carry my cross! 

The essence of existence 
expires like the embers of an ashen dream 
But light shall return in innocence 
with the first gleam of a yet arcane divinity!

I â the messenger 
the voice of the speechless 
keeper of the flames, 
of the face with many names! 

I am the silent shout 
awakening the petrified 
A guardian of old 
a flame of the gods 
the saviour of the lost! 

This is my sacrifice 
invoking the forces beyond 
The fire's burning deep inside 
In the name of life, for those I've lost, I carry my cross!
