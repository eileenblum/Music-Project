Today is when 
the voices in my head stop screaming my name 
Today is when 
The die is cast and all doubts are fading away 
Today is when 
my sorrows are losing importancy
I have lost all faith
I'm right on the edge and I'm not here to stay!

Tear down the walls between reality and the world beyond 
Burst your limits and follow me into pure ecstasy! 
Distorted visions, blurred reflexions - I'm losing control!
Haunting retrospections the voice of the past screams for my soul! 
An evermore rush Commands my mind! 
I can't give enough to pay the price for the healing light! 

Choose your way to leave this place!
No more fucking compromises! 
It's the day of reckoning!
The time has come to spread your wings!

Today is when 
the voices in my head stop screaming my name 
Today is when 
The die is cast and all doubts are fading away 
Today is when 
my sorrows are losing importancy
I have lost all faith
I'm right on the edge and I'm not here to stay!

Tear down the walls between reality and the world beyond! 
Return to your roots! Follow the heart that beats deep inside of you!
Listen to the sound of the rain that falls towards the ground 
and sing your very last song about the realm where you belong!ï»¿
