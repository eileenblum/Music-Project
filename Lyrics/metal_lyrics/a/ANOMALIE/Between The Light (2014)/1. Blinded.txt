My world seemed perfect
so warm and full of harmony
I saw a future so constantly...

But I was blinded by the light
I did not see what was behind
I did not recognize the truth
Instead, I put my trust in you

I forgot that trust means pain
I forgot that nothing is forever
I forgot that life's an unfair game
Witch you can't win, never ever!

It's hard to push forward while everything I desire lies behind me...

I will not recure what went wrong
I will not be a fool anymore
I will not be as blind as before
Never again!

After all I'm alone in the rain
but I've learned to strangle the pain
To see my life in a different point of view
I no longer care about you!
