I didnât see the blue in the sky
Although I knew the sun was shining so bright
For such a long time I had no clue if I was alive
After years in darkness I step into the lightâ¦ again.

And still I hear the call of my inner voice
I still see the shadows behind the lights

Again Iâm running 25 hours a day
The sins of my past right next to me
Again I know that all this beauty I see
Soon melts away like dreams in the dawn of a new day!

The night falls apart
Colours return to life
Feelings, so long forgotten
Fulfil my soul again!
