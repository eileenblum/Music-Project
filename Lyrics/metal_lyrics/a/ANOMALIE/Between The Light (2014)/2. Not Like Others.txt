Do you know the kind of feeling
Which says everythingâs alright
While you know it's not?

Do you sometimes take a look in the mirror
Asking yourself whatâs wrong
What is true and whatâs a lie?

I remember the day that changed my life forever
I remember the moment that opened my eyes
Since them Iâm different, not the same anymore
Life showed me a better way, I just had to open the door

I hated myself for so many years
I fought, night by night, thousands of fucking tears
But I have learned that my point of view is the only thing that matters
I have learned to accept the fact that Iâm just not like others!

Days in grey, senseless hours
There were so many, I stopped to count
To save my will to live

I did not see the beauty of flowers,
The green of woods, the smile of the sun
I was forlorn in agony

I hated myself for so many years
I fought, night by night, thousands of fucking tears
But I have learned that my point of view is the only thing that matters
I have learned to accept the fact that Iâm just not like others!

I hated myself for so many years!
But the chance of a new life was always near!
I changed my life, walked a new line instead of an old one
But in the end I am as blind as before and Iâm still not like others!
