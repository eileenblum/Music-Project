Disrupting the balance between mass and motion
A fragile marriage, no chance to survive
Tectonic harmonics force collapse into oceans
The human race washed away with the tide

The collective calm in mortal oblivion
Instruments of the tyrannized
The collective calm in mortal oblivion
Decimated and pulverized

Scorched skies, magnetosphere disappeared
Oceans rise, as the earth beneath your feet sinks deep into the sea
Burned alive, spontaneously combust into ash and dust
Vaporized turning all of earth into a burning ball of dirt

The collective calm in mortal oblivion
Instruments of the tyrannized
The collective calm in mortal oblivion
Illumination right before your eyes

Earthâs rotation slows to a pause, ending all centrifugal force
Gravitational tug of war, land mass drowning in a water world
Virulent biosphere, solar winds rip through the sky
Technology in the hands of the wicked
Magma shooting through the soil, global quake as continental plates grind
The foremost authority in fucking with nature
And now it's too late

Billions die in the blink of an eye
Forced to pay the price for the abuse of the device
Mass extermination a state of devastation
The world set ablaze, bring forth the end of days

Pandoraâs box unlocked by fools of infamy
Unleashing hell on earth, a living nightmare
Absolute chaos erasing all mortality
The stench of death consuming the air
Water Bloated Bodies
Amassed on virgin shores

Monolith bringer of death
Chaotic inane extermination
The calm replaced by excruciation

Avarice of the few and privileged order
The origins of the cursory, travesty cast down upon all
Ignorant to the realm of possibilities
The consequence is a fate thatâs shared by all
