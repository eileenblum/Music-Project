Torture: subconscious and domestic, how it feels to ship a âunitâ home to you in plastic, cold storage and a casket, open your present and inside you find your darling pride and joy. Question your leaders and their methods. What we call freedoms have all boiled down to bribery. Our list of choices exists so we think we have some to make, but if you try you will discover the subtle difference between the complacent free and the ones that makes the waves. Why must we die when bureaucrats tell us to? Why must we sacrifice ourselves for the disbelief of others? Why must we be thrown away? Why must we die under false pretense? Torrential downpour of bodies bagged and toe-tagged with names and ranks or destinations but the only information of any importance is the number theyâre assigned. What it is to be a statistic blows my mind. Why has our sense of humanity gone awry? Pseudo-villains, planted for propaganda, remind us who we can trust, who we can put our faith in, no one. Boasts of accomplishments falling on dead ears, a severe affliction of blind faith following the blind. Why must we die?
