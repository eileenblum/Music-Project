Eat the dead, cut the flesh
Disgusting, shameful fate
Death comes slow, writhe in pain
Who can blame one faced with difficult choice
Trapped in snowy walls
Strip meat from bone
Human body carved up like any other animal
Feed the hungry children first
All join in this unholy feast
Survival instinct kicks in first
Desire to live overcomes repulsion
Soon the tasty meat is craved
The dying are given a helpful push
Half-eaten bodies strewn
Limbs, skulls, and hair
Fleshless bones
Whether in hell or on earth
Not sure if it matters
Re-discovered is the dark history of our ancestors
Human's vile survival techniques
Half-eaten bodies strewn
Limbs, skulls, and hair
Fleshless bones
Horrendous melancholy tragedy
All join in this unholy feast
To become cannibal
