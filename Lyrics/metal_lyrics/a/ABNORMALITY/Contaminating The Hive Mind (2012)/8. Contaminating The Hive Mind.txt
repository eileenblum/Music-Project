The ability to dream surrendered by design
An illusion of bliss forced into the mind
Accepting false purpose, adopted accordingly
Disguised to justify such stoic conformity

Indoctrination of a species
Happily a vassal population
Embracing standardized sublimity
Affirming total adaptation
Construct of impossible complexity
I am the virus it strives to find
Infection spreads this viral intensity
Contaminating the hive mind

The nature of being scrubbed from the program
Replaced with misconceptions that grow like tumors

Eugenics corruption
Merging man and machine into one
Systemic malfunction
Purging the damage done
Genetic dysfunction
Swarm and structure torn apart
Corrective instruction
Reformed purpose turned on the oligarchs

Command and control of the construct has changed hands
The puppet master's strings have been caught
Empowering the souls intertwined with the hive mind
Free to view the world as they want
Sifting through your many displays of enslavement
Your need to feed your greed at all costs
The hive defines your reign as a virulent infection
And aims to exterminate in disgust

The demise of the tyrants
With indescribable violence
