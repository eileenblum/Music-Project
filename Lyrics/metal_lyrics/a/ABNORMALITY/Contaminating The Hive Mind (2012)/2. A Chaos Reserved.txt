Unintended consequence derived from willful ignorance 
Wake to find the rights you take for granted non-existent 
The world around you self destructs, centuries of blind trust
Combine to form a worm to suck you dry for its own enrichment 
No consolation; enslaved by thieves and liars 
No resignation; embrace, adapt, survive

A seemingly deafening roar of silence
Preceding a chaos reserved for giants 
Completely depleting imperial domination 
Bleeding its greed into a sea of subjugation 

Free to be enslaved by the masters of your choice 
Corrupted republic infiltrated on every front
By sycophantic agents of the bloodlines of royal cunts 
A legacy of squandering in mind numbing subterfuge 
Liberty inversion to nationwide servitude 
Conditioning the masses to be ignorant and consume 
Feeble minded drones taught to choose the path to total doom 

Divide and conquer, strength in numbers
The typical blueprint to seizing power 
The rise of a monster, feeding a hunger 
The violent extermination of evil fucking cowards 
A chaos reserved!

Your reign of ruin through deception and cold blooded crime 
Is hereby nullified 
The flame burns lucid, consuming this house of lies 
Devouring the bloodlines

Unintended consequence derived from willful ignorance 
Wake to find the rights you take for granted non-existent 
The world around you self destructs, centuries of blind trust
Combine to form a worm to suck you dry for its own enrichment 
No consolation; enslaved by thieves and liars 
No resignation; embrace, adapt, survive

A seemingly deafening roar of silence
Preceding a chaos reserved for giants 
Completely depleting imperial domination 
Bleeding its greed into a sea of subjugation
