Innocence. Intervals I cannot recall
Eliminated and replaced. With psychotic animals
Obedience. Disassociation overhaul
Synapses interface with cerebrally integrated protocols
Slipping in and out of sentience
Excruciating senses
Bio-cybernetic enhancements
Installed on adolescents
Monarch Omega
Isolate. Traumatized until fractional
Split into a clean slate. Readily extractable
Indoctrinate. Fabricate the unnatural
Victimize &amp; segregate. Agitate the irrational
Triggered metamorphosis
Emotionless psychosis
Circumventing my own existence
Manifesting someone completely different
The wicked soul emerges
Corrupted flesh personified
A blank stare
Mechanical. Fragment of a shattered mind
Eradicate. My purpose unmistakable
Silently infiltrate. Erase the erasable
Assassinate. A face I find unnameable
Though he tries to run his fate is inescapable
Victory not yet certified
I celebrate my own suicide
