Everywhere, faces I see stare back in despair
Trading places with those faces
Won't go far but you must hold on
You don't know what you've got, until it's gone
And without fear, to disappear
You pay the price, for your life
Hope as high as the mountains,
With our faces against the southern winds
I'll grasp inside, to stay alive,
And face my fears, with the will to live
You must become the change you wish to see in the world
If you want to go far, go together and blanket the cold
You must become the change you wish to see in the world
If you want to go fast, go alone but never back up and fold
Everyday, you have to face the fight, to find a way
Nothing's easy, that will please me
As I search for truth and hold on
To everything I've found in 'til I'm gone
And at the end, my life is spent
I'm facing death, with the path I went
Hope as high as the mountains,
With our faces against the southern winds
I'll grasp inside, to stay alive,
And face my fears, with the will to live
You must become the change you wish to see in the world
If you want to go far, go together and blanket the cold
You must become the change you wish to see in the world
If you want to go fast, go alone but never back up and fold
Desolate
This is becoming
And beneath the feet of us this Earth will shake.
