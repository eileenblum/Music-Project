It will take the treasures invested in your soul
As the sky turns red and the oceans boil
From the depths , of the untread, given birth by a distant sun
Apophis discriminates against no one
To turn sand into glass
We'll be done by midnight
When the sky is turned to stone
And its earth against earth
The death of the sapian
The wise and the faithful
Only the man with the reason
Will this notice be useful
Destroyer of worlds
You can black out the sky
Our reasons to live and lie, are our reasons to die
Obscene, is the waste of this earth,
A celestial body for that it is cursed
More then, this plague of man
We yearn for wings and lungs with air
As our reign on earth comes to an end
Suicide, in mind, for a death before our time
The corruption flow is our fatal crime
So hold your breath until your lungs are wet
But hold your loved ones closer, in the darkness, hold composure
We're failing but we're alive
To find your piece of mind
Search in this great divide
