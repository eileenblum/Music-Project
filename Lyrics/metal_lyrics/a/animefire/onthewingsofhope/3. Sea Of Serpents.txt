Walking blindly, looking through the eyes of scripture
They pick the teachings only fit for today
Man-made gods, moulded in our only image
Blind faith and myths compose all our history
What's the voice inside? My mind is filtered with the moral Zeitgeist
There was no sin,
But the absence of truth in the world
I won't take part in the foolishness held
We die for freedom
Only the wise survive
We die for truth
Paying the price with lives
We abandon this logic, at expense to ourselves
We abandon this logic, at our expense
Let's watch the suns burn into darkness
They don't all have to be from Earth
Be all from Earth
In the white sky view of the future
When time has told if we are worthy or not
Let's watch the suns burn
In the end, when committed to darkness
We shall learn death from truth
