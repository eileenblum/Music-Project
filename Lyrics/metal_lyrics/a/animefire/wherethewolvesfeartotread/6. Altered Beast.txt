Legions of people come and go in my life
The only constant is change in this abyss
So many people live ignorant lives
Their pockets are lined in gold with green eyes
Your inspiration is to your direction
Weâll lay it up upon a bed of nails
Your mindâs direction, is to your salvation
Weâll lay it up upon a bed of nails
And then I open up my eyes
And then I open up my eyes
So many people lead to death, enthused
Legions of people come and go in my life
Choke the world to death in this game
And weâre lost
So many people live a criminal life
Their minds are made corrupt with no end
