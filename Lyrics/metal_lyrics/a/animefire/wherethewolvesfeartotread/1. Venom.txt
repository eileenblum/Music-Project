Turn away while Iâm being held down
The color blue I see while I drown
The serpent coils itself around my neck to end what he began
Tainted are the times that we made
A jealous mind with thoughts embracing rage
My back, it warms itself upon the sun
The closest to hell Iâll ever be
Take out the venom inside of me
Donât pray for me
Donât talk to me with fake sincerity
Take out the venom inside of me
Donât pray for me 
Donât talk to me
Just fucking scream
Iâll walk you in the water in my arms
Our troubleâs over the horizon
Lay me down to sleep in a sailorâs grave
As the venom takes and fills my lungs
A bite mark leads a path to salvation
Iâve walked too far to leave this blinding light
To face what walks the night
The serpent coils around my neck to end what he began
The serpent coils around my neck to end what this became
