Die well
Donât you pity me
Iâve been facing my demons for the longest time
Theyâre given away
Theyâre given away
Well, donât you pity me
Iâve been facing my demons for the longest time
Taking me alive
Itâs meant to be
Let it slip away
Theyâll cover you in fire
Your time has come and gone again
I wonât turn away
Well, donât you pity me
Iâve been facing my demons for the longest time
Theyâre given away
Theyâre given away
Well, donât you pity me
Iâve been chasing my demons for the longest time
Taking my life; inside
