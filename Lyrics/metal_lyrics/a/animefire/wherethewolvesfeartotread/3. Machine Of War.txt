Hold a gun to my head
Am I better off dead?
You know
You know itâs not the same
Hold a gun to my head
Am I better off dead?
My family is leaving me with angel wings
Wake up
My mind induced escapes me
Donât you try to make me
I donât want to walk the thin red line of right and wrong
Your bombs they come to break us
Destroy the voice that made us
But I just want to live
My family is leaving me with angel wings
