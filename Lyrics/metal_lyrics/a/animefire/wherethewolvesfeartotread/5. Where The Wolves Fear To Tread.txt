I walk along the edge of a flat world
Risking the fall into depression
The unwalked, the unknown
My mind is drowned with negative thoughts of paranoia
My only relief is a paradise that exists inside my mind
Stare into the void
Iâm alive
Our carelessness has sent us into the void and Iâm alive but I cannot see the sky through the canopy
Iâm the judge of this game we play
The winner, the loser
Iâll face it alone
Iâm where the wolves fear to tread
The fear of failure haunts me
