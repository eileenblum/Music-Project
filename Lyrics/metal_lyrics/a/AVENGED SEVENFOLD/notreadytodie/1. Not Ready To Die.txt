[Made for "Call of Duty: Black Ops" game (map "Call Of The Dead")]Gone, cast away in time
Evil yours, now evil mine
So I robbed you blind
The voices in my head could jest a less than peaceful side

The endless possibilities
Controlling every fight

You can't break me,
Crushed the fears of yesterday
You can't change me,
Barriers our trust will fade

I've stood in the dark,
Been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive,
I'm not ready to die!

Damned, watch the masses fall
Burn it down, control 'em all
Make me crawl
To daddy's little girl to read the writings on the wall

While cast into the nothingness
The final curtain call

You can't break me,
Crushed the fears of yesterday
You can't change me,
Barriers, our trust will fade

I've stood in the dark, been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive,
I'm not ready to die!

Through the madness we find,
Loyalty is no match for power
Say goodbye to your life,
Left to rot in your darkest hour
Prayers won't help you now,
As long as you're mine

You can't break me,
Crushed the fears of yesterday
You can't change me,
Barriers our trust will fade.

I've stood in the dark,
Been waiting all this time
While we damn the dead I'm trying to survive

And I'll control the world,
one person at a time,
As I damn the dead I'm trying to survive,
I'm not ready to die!

Oh!

I'm not ready to die!
I'm not ready to die!
I'm not ready to die!
I'm not ready to die!
