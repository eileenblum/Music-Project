The problem with society's been how do we teach
And if they'll believe.
We'll fight this battle for years to come
'Til we only accept that we can stand on our own.

Grandfather used his hands, he worked them to the bone.
Provide his family with a happy home, alone.

Don't take your aggression out on me.
My old man is all I'm meant to be.
This goddamn place is so lazy, old and tired
All your ideas are so fucking uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

Don't wanna be, they never say
But don't call us the liars.

We've walked these alleys a thousand times
And scattered around a thousand lies.
They are trying to hold you down
Your life may be hard
But keep your feet on the ground.
Why don't I have the finer things that others have?
The chance is there if you want it all that bad.
So bad.

Don't take your aggression out on me.
My old man is all I'm meant to be.
This Goddamn place is so lazy, old and tired
All your ideas are so fucking uninspired.
Takes more than one idea
More than one person to fight the fight
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

Don't try and get me confused.
Cause I do understand.
And sometimes people need help.
That they may need a hand
When this problems going on.
A thing you have to get straight
Is that you don't hold my hand.
And I don't owe you a thing.
So don't think about how sorry
You feel when now you're treated so bad.

This Goddamn place is so lazy, old and tired
All your ideas are so fucking uninspired.
Takes more than one idea,
More than one person to fight the fight.
How many times have you taught and not conspired?

And as a race we look back and we've come so far.
While some may conquer,
The others had it so hard.
But instead we just complain
While there's no one for us to fight.
I guess we're bored and that's how we keep us occupied.
