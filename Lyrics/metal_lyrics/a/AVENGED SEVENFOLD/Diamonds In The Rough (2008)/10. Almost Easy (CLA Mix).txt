I feel insane every single time I'm asked to compromise
'cause I'm afraid, and stuck in my ways and that's the way it stays
So how long did I expect love to out weigh ignorance?
By that look on your face I may have forced the scale to tip

[Pre-Chorus:]
I'm not insane, I'm not insane
I'm not insane, I'm not - not insane

(Mother)
Come back to me, it's almost easy.
(Said it all)
Come back again, it's almost easy.

Shame pulses through my heart
From the things I've done to you.
It's hard to face but the fact remains that
This is nothing new.

I let you down inside with suicidal memories,
Selfish beneath the skin
But deep inside I'm not insane.

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus:]
(Mother)
Come back to me, it's almost easy.
(Said it all)
Come back to again, it's almost easy.
(You learn your lesson)
Come back me, it's almost easy.
(But still you'll fall)
Come back again, it's almost easy.

Now that I've lost you it kills me to say
(Hurts to say)
I try to hold on as you slowly slip away.
I'm losing the fight.
Treated you so wrong, now let me make it right.
(Make it all right)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
