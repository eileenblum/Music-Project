Dead men,
They celebrate
As the final chapter
Fades away
Cause they can't hide;
We can see their flesh is rotten!

The band plays a hopeful tune
The champagne is poured
As they socialize
The look in their eyes
Hide in the light!

[Chorus:]
Everything is paid for tonight
While at the party of the
Dead dancin' in their graves
The drinks here are free, so relax
Enjoy the sight of all the
Dead dancin' in their graves
And while the world that they built
Told 'em to change
Told 'em to listen
They just kept it the same
And now that midnight has come
I'll get a room watchin' the
Dead dancin' in their graves

Bones covered up by suit
As the visible scars,
They multiply
Kiss it good-bye
Too stubborn and I'll destroy!

Tick, tock
The time bomb has been
Recognized and pressurized
Nowhere to hide
Swallowing light!

[Chorus]

Feel a coming strength
And now it's too late
To change

[background chatter:]
Why'd you want to go?
You drown me with all that you are
Oh, how the mighty fall
Yeah

[Chorus]

Feel a coming strength
And now it's too late
To change
[Repeated until the end]
