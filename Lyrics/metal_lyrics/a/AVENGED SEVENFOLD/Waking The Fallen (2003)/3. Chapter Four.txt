[M. Shadows:]
Give me your hand,
Blood is spilt and man will follow
Infernal man, punishment too great to bear
[The Rev:]
Conceived and born was one of light
Rain and dark, the other born black knight

Raise your head and taste the courage (the one of light)
Fall from grace, unholy knight
I've come here to kill you,
Won't leave until you've died
Murder born of vengeance,
I closed my brother's eyes tonight...

[The Rev:]
It's cold tonight as the clouds turn grey
And from my hands to my brother's grave
You took his side, you took his gift,
Feel the power of a fallen man, crestfallen man...

[Matt Shadows:]
Far away in this land I must go,
Out of the sight of the One.
A punishment sent from his hand
A hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One,
Away in this land you must go.

[The Rev:]
Where has he gone? What have you done?
A voice commands from high above this earth.
From the soil his blood cries out to me
Murder, liar, vengeance, deceit.

[Matt Shadows:]
Far away in this land I must go
Out of the sight of the One
A punishment sent from his hands
A hardship that no one should know
Now go out of the sight of the One
Away in this land you must go
