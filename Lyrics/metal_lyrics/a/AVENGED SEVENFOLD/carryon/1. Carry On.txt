["Call of Duty: Black Ops II" Track]Some people live that selfish desire
Some choose to shout when they speak and theyâll be the start
Guarding the flame of those deep in fire
Seeking out those with a voice
One for tomorrow

They say weâve lost our minds, weâve just gained control
Search endlessly, fight till weâre free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery,
Somehow we still carry on

Silence your fear, weâve got to move higher,
Unlock the stars in the sky
Guarding us all
Battle the will of those who conspire,
Take back the passion to live, vanish the sorrow

Destroys their perfect crime, watch the power fold
Search endlessly, fight till weâre free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery,
Somehow we still carry on

Search endlessly, fight till weâre free
Fly past the edge of the sea
No bended knee, no mockery,
Somehow we still carry on
Carry on
