Hey kid, do I have your attention?
I know the way you've been living
(Life so reckless, tragedy endless)
Welcome to the family

Hey, there's something missing
Only time will alter your vision
Never in question, lethal injection
Welcome to the family

Not long ago you'd find the answers were so crystal clear
Within a day you found yourself living in constant fear
Can you look at yourself now?Can you look at yourself?
You can't win this fight!

And in a way it seems there's no-one to call
when our thoughts are so numb
And our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight!

Hey, I have to question
What's with the violent aggression?
Details blurry, lost him too early
Welcome to the family

Hey, why won't you listen?
Can't help the people you're missing
It's been done, a casualty rerun
Welcome to the family

I'll try and help you with the things that can't be justified
I need to warn you that there is no way to rationalize
So have you figured it out now?
So have you figured it out?
You can't win this fight!

And in a way it seems there's no-one to call
when our thoughts are so numb
And our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight!

Gunning for you
And all mankind
I've lost my mind
Psychotic
Rabid dementia
I won't be fine

I see
Youâre a king whoâs been dethroned
Cast out
In a world youâve never known
Stand down
Place your weapons by your side
Itâs our war
in the end weâll surely lose
But that's alright

So have you figured it out now?
So have you figured it out?

And, in a way it seems there's no-one to call
when our thoughts are so numb
And our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside
We all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight!

Deep inside
Where nothing's fine
I lost my mind
You're not invited
So step aside
I lost my
Deep inside
Where nothing's fine
I lost my mind
You're not invited
So step aside
I lost my
