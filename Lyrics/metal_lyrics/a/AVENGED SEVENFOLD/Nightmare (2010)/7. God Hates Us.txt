TOTAL NIGHTMARE!
TOTAL NIGHTMARE!

You wanna hear my side?
You need to drown to know.
With all the times it hurt me to fuck you
I built a wall with your blood to show!

GOD SAVE US!
GOD SAVE US ALL!
GOD HATES US!
GOD HATES US ALL!

TOTAL NIGHTMARE!
TOTAL NIGHTMARE!

Nothing to heal, no one to break
Pills had a role, now there's nothing to take
Nothing to trust, no one to fake!
You'll find out sooner that it's best if we just know our place
My infiltrated mind, my lacerated soul
It took me years, create me, control you
I left myself for an idea I stole

GOD SAVE US!
GOD SAVE US ALL!
GOD HATES US!
GOD HATES US ALL!

TOTAL NIGHTMARE!
TOTAL NIGHTMARE!

Liar, rape, kill
Love, hate, fear
You better take your time
(Liar, rape, kill)
You better take it slow
(Love, hate, fear)
'Cause when you seek the one
There's nothing left to show

TOTAL NIGHTMARE!
TOTAL NIGHTMARE!
TOTAL NIGHTMARE!
TOTAL NIGHTMARE!
