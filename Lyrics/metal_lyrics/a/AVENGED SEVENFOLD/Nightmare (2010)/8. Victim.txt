House full of roses, a letter on the stairs
A tape full of messages for anyone who cares

Collage of broken words
And stories full of tears
Remembering your life
'Cause we wish that you were here

Nothing is harder than to wake up all alone
Realize it's not okay, it's the end of all you've known

Time keeps passing by
But it seems I'm frozen still
Scars are left behind
But some too deep to feel

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel
Tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain
Inside
We're all just victims of a crime

Some days you'll find me in a place I like to go
Ask questions to myself 'bout the things I'll never know

What's left to find
'Cause I need a little more
I need a little time
Can we even up the score?

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel
Tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain
Inside
We're all just victims of a crime

And nothing lasts forever, for all good things it's true
I'd rather trade it all while somehow saving you
It must have been the season that threw us out of line
Once I stood so tall, now I'm searching for a sign

So don't need your salvation
With promises unkind
And all the speculation
Save it for another time
'Cause we all need a reason
A reason just to stay
And some just can't be bothered
To stick around another day

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel
Tonight
We've all been victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain
Inside (oh)
We've all been victims of a crime
Victims of a crime
Living with this crime

I'm missing you [4x]
