It seems I should have walked away
Reverse the wager I've no means to pay
Toto has pulled back the green tonight, in sight
And blue pills coat with such disdain
I've worn the shades for so long
That I've forgotten how to see
The curtain rises but who dares to pull the strings

I've questioned all the voices in my head
Are they mine of have I have misled?
Total understanding don't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see behind the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?

By the way of cosmic rays
A subtle breakdown jarred the code display
A simulation as I can tell, our cell
Playing out a hopeless scene
We stand to lose all our charm
And faith just seems to wane
A billion years can seem a stunningly short time

I've questioned all the voices in my head
Are they mine of have I been misled?
Total understanding don't seem to mean a thing
When you can't see beyond the silver screen, a figurine
Can't you hear me scream?

Posturing the way I feel
Is truth only what we believe is real?
Marvel the sketches that paint the night, starlight
And take a breath before it's all erased away
