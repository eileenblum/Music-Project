Hey â can't you see we're tripping on the wire
Waltzing through the candy land of our desires
Press the magic button and behold the world you crave
But where's the fun in freedom when it renders you a slave?

Pledge allegiance, no flag, god nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm

Hey â it goes beyond big brother in the sky
Beyond the threat of martial law, no Horus eye
No one came to cuff you they just handed you the chains
Blind follow the blind and now the one-eyed man is king

Pledge allegiance, no flag, god nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us warm
Tunnel vision, no man, damn nation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed

No form of payment, no of of gold, will satisfy the debt of what's he's owed.
Spilling from the houses in a trance the children lined up on the road
Cursing at the piper as he lured your kids away and let them to the river
for what was their final day
No need for conviction on this pipe he played a song to fool them all
Fooled them all

Pledge allegiance, no flag, god nation, goddamned
The devil dances with the scorned
And how the fire keeps us
Tunnel vision, no man, damn nation, god damn
Can't see the forest for the trees
Can't heal the wound before we bleed
