Standing in the shade of altruism, answering the call
Came a modern messiah to save us all
Something far beyond a work of fiction, Positronic brain
A world that's void of all the anguish and suffering, pain

Better tame your convictions before you go and open the cage
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find

Never held a high regard for Darwin, selection takes too long
A little kick in the pool shouldn't do us wrong
Devouring the very last invention man would ever need
But exponential growth is a frightening thing, indeed

Sweet bohemian jury rounded up and hung in the streets
Were creating god, master of our designs
Were creating god, unsure of what we'll find

Sometimes when I look to the sky I have to wonder are we 
"summoning the demon" you and I?

Have you noticed that I'm needin' it more now, more than it needs me
Got a couple of billion that seem to agree
Surfing in an artificial dimension, but we're not alone
Now the master has become just a steppingstone, oh

Like a blow to the ego the bitter pills are harder to take
We're creating god, master of our designs
We're creating god, unsure of what we'll find
We're creating god, in search of the divine
We're creating god, committing suicide
