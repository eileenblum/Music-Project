[Latin chants:]
Prodigia, comploratus, silens, oro, regent exitium.

Days of warning
Night brings mourning.
My prayers - wordless.
Heaven is burning down

I walk stricken
Pitch black vision
Oh One, save me
Caress my weary eyes

Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames, in flames, in flames, in flames

Nature quaking
Prophets aching
I kneel faithful
Damnation cracks the sky

My heart fiction
Superstition
Your grace deathless
Give life to my last breath

Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames, in flames, in flames, in flames

Grant them eternal rest oh lord
Embrace them into your army of undead.
Strike with vengeance those who oppose your will.
And lay waste to all opposition sent before you.
Walk with them and cure them from the blinding light of servitude.
And devastate your enemies as they die by your hand.
Amen.

[Latin chants:]
Prodigia, comploratus, silens, oro, regent exitium.

Rise from ashes
Violence clashes
My soul vacant
Cleanse me of all this sin

I stand guilty
I bleed filthy
Born of fire
Savor this final hour

Darkest Lord
Your mercy shall I gain
Strike the match
Engulf the earth in flames, in flames, in flames, in flames
