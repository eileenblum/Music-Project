Dark years brought endless rain,
out in the cold I lost my way.
but storms won't last, they clear the air
for something new
the sun came out and brought you through.

A lifetime full of words to say,
A hope that time will slow the passing day.

I've been wrong, time's over
and I've been shamed with no words to find.
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow,
walk with me.
Crimson day.

Don't speak, no use for words
lie in my arms, sleep secure.
I wonder what you're dreaming of,
lands rare and far
A timeless flight to reach the stars.

A lifetime full of words to say,
a hope that time will slow the passing day.

I've been wrong, time's over
and I've been shamed with no words to find.
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow,
walk with me.
Crimson day.

I've come so far to meet you here,
to share this life with one I hold so dear.
and I won't speak but what is true,
the world outside is created just for you.
It's for you, for you.

I've been wrong, time's over
and I've been shamed with no words to find.
But if the sun will rise, bring us tomorrow,
walk with me.
Crimson day.
