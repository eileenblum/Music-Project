I've been away
Searching for a reason
Another purpose to find
I've sailed the seas
Fought my many demons
I've looked to gods in the skies

I've stood in hell
Where many had to suffer
I stared the devil in the eyes.

Walked many roads
To witness ancient idols
And found the great Gates of fire

Had many storms
Question my conviction.
Gave armies reason to rise.

The hangman searching
For bones he can borrow.
While I escaped in the night.
Fight or flight.

Live again
All roads endÂ 
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
'Cause on this night
I'll be coming home

Escaped the hell
Of calculated mortars.
Then drank the blood of a king
The desert rain
Has washed away direction
Had angels looking after me
So it seems

Live again
All roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
'Cause on this night
I'll be coming home

[Guitar solo]

My story ends
Not far from where it started
My weary limbs have grown old
I've seen the world
Through the eyes of a nomad
Home is where the heart is
I've been told
So I go

Live again
All roads end
I'll be coming home
Tend your light
'Cause on this night
I'll be coming home

I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home
I'm coming home

[Guitar fades out]
