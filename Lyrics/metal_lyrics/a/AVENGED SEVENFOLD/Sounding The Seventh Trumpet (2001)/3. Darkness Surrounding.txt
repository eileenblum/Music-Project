Darkness coats us.
The smell of fall.
Changing season.

The graveyard is alive, black cat across my path,
The chill of cold wind, the breath of the dead.

Imprisoned souls.
Trapped for eternity.

Black crows break the silence.
The garden of the dead is alive tonight and you can't stop it.
Just enjoy it.

Open up your mind and you will feel it too.
The sound, the touch, the thoughts,
That you've been so blind to.

You can feel the thoughts of the dead.
Feel the thoughts of the dead.

True or false, it's still there, teaching me.
True or false, it's still there, teaching me.

You can feel it tonight.
The wood has rotted away.
Take the time absorb it.
Their time is slipping away.

Stone all carved by hand.
Statues that resemble their faces.
They still breathe.
Come join us.

[3x]
Smell the burning embers,
Time flickering away.
Timeless but soon gone.
Timeless but soon gone.

And I can find myself,
Alone with just my thoughts.
As time crumbles away.
Time crumbles away.

Smell the burning embers,
Time flickering away.
Timeless but soon gone.
Timeless but soon gone.

And I can find myself,
Alone with just my thoughts.
As time crumbles away.
Time crumbles away.
