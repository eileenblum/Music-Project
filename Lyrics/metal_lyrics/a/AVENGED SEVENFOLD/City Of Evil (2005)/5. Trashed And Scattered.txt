Keep on writing you're just raping yourself (nothing can take my mind away from them)
Don't you ask about me, ask 'bout somebody else (once I've fallen there's many stories to tell)
I can feel it, won't embrace it, it's overwhelming how far you take it (stuck in a state of questioning)
And don't you tell me you know we're destined, you won't convince me, I won't listen (resentment building, you've put our lives on hold)

Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination always unknown, I'll find my way there
But goddamn motherfuckers always wasting my time

I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control

Play your game and walk away 'cause your integrity don't mean shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out

Label me, that's fine, I'll be somebody else (nothing in front of me but holes ahead)
Lie about my life, have a story to tell (lights went down, was on the edge and I fell)
Oh you're so insightful, let me remind you to twist and break me, should make you worried (long way to go and you're right there)
Two-faced liar, don't try and know me, deceit brings fire, makes sure you can't breathe (pick at pieces of my body below)

I never bothered with all the rumors, too much garbage (all the same)
I'll stand right here (I know my destination), come on you falsehood deceitful liar (there's no shame)
Don't ever take my side, I know you're never right, I'll justify the means (nothing's what it seems)
I'll stand around and fight, but there's no point tonight, been chained to this machine

Trashed and scattered again, I'm feelin' so low
You waste your breath while fuckin' with me, my blood is so cold
My destination always is known, I'll find my way there
But goddamn imposter are you out of your mind?

I walk down these roads alone and now you're seen here
My feelings that I'm having towards you are perfectly clear (I control this ride)
My devil's appetite is tonight and now I'm alright
But you goddamn motherfuckers always wasting my time

Play your game and walk away 'cause your integrity don't mean shit
Crawl on me you fucking parasite, and I'm gonna take you out

I won't be the victim, but the first to cast a stone
Sedated nights to the bar room fights as metropolis takes its toll
And don't you try to stop me, it's a place you'll never know
Don't try to judge or take shots at me, I'll never let you seize control

Don' try and get the best of me (no one can help but your own self)
City makes my body ache (lonely, don't try and prey on me)
Don' try and get the best of me (no one can help but your own self)
City makes my body ache (lonely, don't try and prey on me)

And my body's trashed and low, but to you I'll never show myself or what's inside
And I've seen it all before and I'll settle the score, I'll never join your side
