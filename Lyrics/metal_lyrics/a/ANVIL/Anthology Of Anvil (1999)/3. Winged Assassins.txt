[Lips, Reiner, Allison, Dickson]

Machines made for killing at mach speed and more
Sleek in design and loaded for war
Sidewinding missiles, heat-seeks and sparrows
Strafing squadrons cause havoc and terror

Winged Assassins - Seek their prey

Camouflage colours impair observation
Insignia painted depicting its nation
Defying detection at low altitude
Penetrate, attack, evade and elude

Soaring death - Taking lives
No escape - Widows weep

Winged Assassins - Seek their prey

Radar is sweeping and scanning the skies
Searching out targets with infrared eyes
Enemy forces appear on the screen
Computers lock in, all systems are green

Formation - Orders, permission to arm
Closing in - To make the kill

Trigger in hand, blood lust in his heart
The pilot is ready to play out his part
Underwing stores await a demand
Releasing the arsenal upon his command

Soaring death - Taking lives
No escape - Widows weep

Permission is given to unleash the power
Rockets home in, strike and devour
Wreckage falls helpless rolling in flames
Another life wasted in some General's games

Task complete - Honours awaiting heroes
Painted scrap - Awarding murder

Winged Assassins - Seek their prey
