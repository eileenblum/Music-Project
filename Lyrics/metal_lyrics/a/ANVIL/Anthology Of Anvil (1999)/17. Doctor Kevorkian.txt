[Lips, Reiner]

Final anaesthetic
From an outlaw medic
Permanent anaesthesia
Case of euthanasia
Terminally ill
Making your will

[Chorus]

Meet your destiny
Die with dignity
Doctor Kevorkian, Doctor Death
Doctor Kevorkian, Doctor Death

Clinical observation
Untimely termination
Unlawful act
Everlasting fact
Breathing in the gas
Death comes fast

[Chorus]

Doctor Kevorkian, Doctor Death
