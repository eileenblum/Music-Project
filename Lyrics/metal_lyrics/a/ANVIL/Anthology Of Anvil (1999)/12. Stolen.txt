[Lips, Reiner]

Stole my wife, stole my money
Stole my car and that ain't funny
Stole my weed, stole my car
Stole my words, they won't get far

Stolen
Stole from me

Stole my thoughts, stole my time
Stole my music and that's a crime
Stole the spotlight, stole the fame
Steal your soul just to play the game

I always have what they need
What they need
Taken by envy and greed

Stolen, you stole from me
Stolen, I'll never let this be
Stolen, I don't need this shit
On the low life thief I spit

Stole my food, stole my bike
Stole my heart and things I like
Stole my joy, stole my pleasure
Steal my love and buried treasure
Stole my future, stole my past
Steal my present, they should all be gassed
Stole my look, stole my trip
Steal you blind, keep a stiff upper lip

I always have what they need
What they need
Taken by envy and greed

Stolen, you stole from me
Stolen, I'll never let this be
Stolen, I don't need this shit
Stolen, on the thief I spit
Stolen, you stole from me
Stolen, I'll never let this be
Stolen, I don't need this shit
Stolen, on the thief I spit
Stolen
