[Lips, Reiner, Gyorffy, Hurd]

Nowadays it's just not the same
Now they're playing a different game
I love to think about the things I miss
Sometimes I just like to reminisce

Looking back - With no regret
Stay on track - I won't forget, I won't forget

[Chorus]

Old school - Embracing the past
Old school - Only good things last

Innocence and sentiment
Are in permanent retirement

Stay on track - With no regret, I won't forget

[Chorus]

It's not that I like to live in the past
But some things just don't last
I remember how it used to be
I use the past to influence me

Looking back - With no regret
Stay on track - I won't forget, I won't forget

[Chorus]
