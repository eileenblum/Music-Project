You thought that metal was a trend
Got some news for you my friend
Anvil music is what I am
Really don't give a damn
So if you think that we suck
I really don't give a fuck
I defy all the rules
Make the skeptics look like fools

Listen close I'll tell you why
I'll play my music till I die
My life is what I dedicate
To what I love not what I hate

Real metal

Like addiction till death do part
Metal music straight from the heart
Not for money just for the cause
Love to hear the fan's applause
One hit wonders fly by night
The eternal oversight
It's true Anvil the real McCoy
It's my passion, pride and joy

Real metal

From Hard'N'Heavy to Pound for Pound
From Worth the Weight to Speed of Sound
Donnington, Wacken, Brugge, in between
Still so much left unseen
All the songs all the places
All the fun in people's faces
To the diehard I'm glad your there
If not for you I'd be nowhere

Real metal
