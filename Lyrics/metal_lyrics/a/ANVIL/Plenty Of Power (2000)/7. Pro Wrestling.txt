Ring bell, fighters in the ring
Start match, begin the clobbering
Drop kick, caught up in the rope
Pin fall, for the man with no hope

Head butt, arm drag

Pro wrestling fight to win
Pro wrestling be the champion

Choke slam, below the belt a knee
Face lock, in steps the referee
Bear hug, cross face chicken wing
Monkey flip, gorilla press and fling

Toe hold, kick out

Pro wrestling fight to win
Pro wrestling be the champion

Cage match, hell inside the cell
Hard core, blood the tale will tell
Choreographed, for the crowd appeal
Screen play, the pain is truly real

Back drop, eye gauge
Hip toss, kick out

Pro wrestling fight to win
Pro wrestling be the champion
