I know a guy you just can't trust
He's rotten to the core
I know a guy that will push you
Further than you've been before
Broken promises a pack of lies
A dishonest piece of shit
Broken jaw a blackened eye
Would more than do the trick

A burned out loser with nothing to lose
Always on the take
A burned out abuser with nothing to choose
Of that make no mistake

Brainless, heartless
Useless, clueless
Company you shouldn't keep
The creep, the creep, the creep
Will fuck you over
The creep, the creep, the creep

There's a moral for every story
This one has no end
There's a player who's never sorry
And you'll he'll soon befriend
Don't be surprised he'll be disguised
As someone that you know
Don't compromise just realize
What friends you must let go

Brainless, heartless
Useless, clueless
Company you shouldn't keep
The creep, the creep, the creep
Will fuck you over
The creep, the creep, the creep
