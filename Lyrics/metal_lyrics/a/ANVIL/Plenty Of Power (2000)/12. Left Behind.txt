[Bonus Track]

Frozen landscape, a winter sun
Darkened blanket cocoon is spun
Planted seeds are waiting to grow
Thriving forests and jungle rain
Scorched deserts across the plain
The power of nature makes it so
City sky lines, smog filled air
Busy freeways of despair
The destructive forces of mankind
Avalanche of techno power
Counting down the final hour
The quest for knowledge is left behind

Left behind

Steaming geyser lava flow
Built the world we all know
Divided the land from the sea
The fundamental ecology
Dying forests, no jungle rain
All's become a desert plain
The destructive forces of mankind
The results of techno power
Counting down the final hour
What will be the remnants left behind

Left behind
