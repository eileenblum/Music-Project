Formulas equations for song
Memories that last a life long
Mixing of rhythm and riff
Multiplied by the players I'm with
Personal complete alliance

Groove science

Looking for just the right sound
Inspirations where it's found
Doing it with self reliance
Finding all the parts
Writing from our hearts

Groove science

Absolute devotion for song
The science for writing is strong
Listening for just the right note
Learning from what we wrote
A breaking of all the silence
Finding all the parts
Writing from our hearts

Groove science
