One step ahead, they're on your tail
Live or dead you're skipping bail
Over your shoulder, no time to stop
You're getting bolder watch out for a cop

A born thief on the lamb
His mother's grief, he don't give a damn
Has a rap sheet as long as my arm
An escapee from a work farm

Beat the law

Criminal on the loose
Escape the hangman's noose

Beat the law

Steal a car grand larceny
Won't get far committing a felony
On the run no place to hide
Ain't no fun, a kick in the pride

A dream team lawyer is what you need
A filthy liar to get you freed
You walk away an exonerated man
But everyday you'll be damned

Beat the law
