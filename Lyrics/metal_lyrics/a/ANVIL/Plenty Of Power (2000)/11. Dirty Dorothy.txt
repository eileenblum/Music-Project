[Bonus Track]

Seduce my mind
Seduce my soul
Shit or go blind
No self control
All that I crave
All that I desire
I'll be diggin' my grave
Until the day I expire

Stay away from me dirty Dorothy
Won't you let me be
Stay away from me dirty Dorothy
I've got to be free

The deadly embrace
A lasting affair
Unforgettable face
That doesn't care
Just another quick fix
It won't be my last
More dirty tricks
It takes my money fast

Stay away from me dirty Dorothy
Won't you let me be
Stay away from me dirty Dorothy
I've got to be free

Crying out for help

I've tried to quit
I've pushed it away
Hooked on the shit
Just another day
Tar on the road
Tar in my lung
Like a heavy load
The final bell has rung

Stay away from me dirty Dorothy
Won't you let me be
Stay away from me dirty Dorothy
I've got to be free
