Harden steel and thunder sound
Motivated to move the ground
Digging deep the quarry heap
Caterpillar's on the creep
Moving rubble in its wake
Turning rocks that crack and break
It's the one to move a ton
Mass destruction has begun

Plenty of power

Pushing power and endless source
Mechanized driving force
Moving rubble no trouble
Feel the ground begin to rumble
Single shank a blade of steel
Turbo charged with mega zeal
High sprocket powered rocket
There is nothing that can stop it

Plenty of power

D11 dozer with massive power
Meal of concrete to devour
Dig a landfill bury a hill
If you don't know, you never will
Diesel engine that's after cooled
Crawling creature that's fire fueled
Fractured rock, after shock
All I wanna do is rock

Plenty of power
