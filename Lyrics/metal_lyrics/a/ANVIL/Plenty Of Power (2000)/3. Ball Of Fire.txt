Prophecies of Armageddon
The end of all we know
Like Atlantis lost and forgotten
When the winds of disaster blow

Pieces of shattered planets
Fragments of space debris
Atomic powered rocket
Won't keep us from our destiny

Ball of fire
Streak the sky
Ball of fire
Comets falling from the sky
Destructive force we can't defy
Ball of fire

The universe and all its wonders
Planets among the stars
Ripping and roaring thunder
When Earth becomes a wasteland like Mars

Ball of fire
Streak the sky
Ball of fire
Comets falling from the sky
A force we can't defy
Ball of fire
