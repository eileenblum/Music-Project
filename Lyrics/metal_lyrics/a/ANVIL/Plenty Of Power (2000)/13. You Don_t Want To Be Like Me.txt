[Bonus Track]

Not happy unless I'm miserable, sadness is my friend
A disaster waiting to happen that I can't comprehend
Born under a bad sign, the dark side of the moon
Sealed with my iron fist that pounds out my doom

You don't want to be like me

Sarcastic and cynical has become my way
Waking up each morning to another perfect day
Misery needs company doesn't want to be alone
Have a seat stay awhile I'll knock you off your throne

You don't want to be like me
Misery's bad company
You don't want to be like me

The lines on my face the maps of my soul
Trials and tribulations are more than my goals
I might live to win but I was born to lose
Paying the price for the life that I choose
Staying in the saddle is all that I know
Holding on tight and never letting go
Been there, done that I'll do it 'till the end
Frustrated, underrated it's hard to pretend

You don't want to be like me
Misery's bad company
You don't want to be like me
