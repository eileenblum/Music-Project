Ocean of fantasy many fathoms deep
Calling in the darkness attracting you to seek

Luring lonely seaman to a perilous end
Shark infested waters on their eyes they can't depend
Obscured by fog and distance a maiden in the mist
Hear her call of singing your fate will have a twist

Siren, siren, siren of the sea

On the sea of years gone past many a sailor died
Searching the darkness when the lonely maiden cried
Run aground upon the reefs a desperate agony
When finding a woman of your dreams becomes your destiny

Siren, siren, siren of the sea
