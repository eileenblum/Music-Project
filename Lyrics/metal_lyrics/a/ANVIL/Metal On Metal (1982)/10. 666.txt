Chains of death have been unleashed
Ripped and tattered stricken from hell
Sold my soul but the contract's been breached
Entering humanity from death's well

Your fate is sealed revelation is near
I hear your screams but I thrive off your fear
Received my warning but you didn't, didn't, didn't learn

Make my wars in the minds of man
Make the being itself fulfil my cause
Hitler and Manson were my right hand
To these men I entrusted my sacred laws

I'd rather be a king below than a servant above
I'd rather be free and hate than a prisoner of love
You heard my warning but you didn't, didn't, didn't learn
