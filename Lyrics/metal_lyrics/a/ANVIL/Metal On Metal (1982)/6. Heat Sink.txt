Tempered hot, ready or not, you know what I need
White hot steel, gotta be real, gotta forge to feed
Liquid lead my lust unfed, will soon be cold
My love will last within your cast, your body is my mold

Take the heat, burnin' treat, push &amp; shove, red hot love

Blueing ore you want more, you just can't stop
Like a crane on a chain, I'll take you to the top
Got my hand on the firebrand, gonna mark you mine
Molten flesh our bodies mesh, oblivious to time

Take the heat, burnin' treat, push &amp; shove, red hot love

Heat sink, I can't think of nobody but you
Heat sink, I'm on the brink, love's comin through

Crimson flames lovers' pains, sweat beads down my back
Clouds of smoke from the coal &amp; coke, feel my heat attack

Brittle glass, softening mass, reserves now are spent
Like tin weak and thin, frame work now is bent
the fire's down the burnin's stopped, leave me now to cool
Cold black waste you've had a taste of my heated tool
