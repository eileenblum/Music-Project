In a small town outside of destiny
The legend lives on yet it lives free
That night the mountains glowed with fiery rage
From the darkness of hell out she came

Comin' to get you!! You can't escape
You're gonna die, you wonder why??!!

Might wings beat out thunderous gusts of wind
Megatron eyes explode in the skies, it begins!
Talons like razors are shredding your bones to pieces
Is this a dream or is God's telling you it's over?

Mothra, Mothra, Mothra

Buildings are falling, black death is above you
You can't run there's nowhere to go
Rubble and stone block your path
You can't escape from it's wrath

Hot flashes burst, melting down civilization
Leaving destruction and desolation
You're still alive but your luck is running out
It's not a dream God's told you it's over
It's over!!!

What can we do?
A creature of the night
Are we through?
Will this be our plight
Please save us. please
What did we wrong to you?
This holocaust is killing all of us

I've sent this beast to purify your kind
And for your world leave no life behind

Conquest complete, Mothra is nesting
Population for future infesting
Purification yes it's been achieved
For eternity Mothra reigns supreme
