[Lips, Reiner, Allison, Dickson]

A shot in the dark
On a New York night
The dream of the hunter
And the doomed man's fright

[Chorus]

Rock
Roar
In the land of the predator
Concrete jungle

Survival of the fittest
And the jungle's alive
The plight of the nigger
And the honkey jive

[Chorus]

The Lady's liberty
Is getting old
Prey for justice
Will our freedom be sold

[Chorus]
