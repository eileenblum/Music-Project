[Lips, Reiner, Allison, Dickson]

You've tried them all from big to small
But no one's turned your crank
You're here tonight to get done right
I'm gonna fill your tank
Pull in the bay it's your lucky day
Get up on the hoist
From underneath we'll tool and grease
Gonna get you moist

What I see just can't be
Have to work you overtime
Gonna line you up and prime you up
Make you run so fine
Lift the hood if you know what's good
I wanna spark the gap
Fuel injection - No infection
Clean right to the cap

Ride the clutch motormount
Drive all night
Grind the gears motormount
Hold on tight

Motormount (Drive all night)

Dip my wrench into your stench
And twist the nuts up tight
Anticipate, accelerate
And torque with all my might

Manifold - Got to hold
Transmission - Hydraulic spin

High speed ride - Power glide
Can't survive overdrive

Pistons screaming, rings are seizing
Think your valves are gone
Start to tire, then backfire
No longer can go on

Overheating - You're peaking
Start steamin' - Watch you blow

High speed ride - Power glide
Can't survive overdrive

Motormount (Drive all night)
