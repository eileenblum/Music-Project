[Lips, Reiner, Allison, Dickson]

Well I don't care if I lose my hair
I don't care if you strip me bare
I don't care if you think I'm sick
I'm just a mad dog doin' my trick

[Chorus]

'Cause I'm a mad dog
A mad bad dog
I'm just a mad dog

Chasing cars or burying my bone
I'm a stray looking for a home
On the corner just hanging around
I'm a depraved, deranged flea-bitten hound

[Chorus]

Ain't hydrophobic
No need to run
I'm just a mad dog
Having fun

[Chorus]

Looking for a bitch in heat
Begging for a doggy treat
You know my bark is worse than my bite
You'll hear me howling in the heat of the night

[Chorus]

Feel my bite
