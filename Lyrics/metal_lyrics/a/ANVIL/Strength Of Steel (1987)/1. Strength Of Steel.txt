[Lips, Reiner, Allison, Dickson]

With the strength of steel
I'll show you how I feel
All the weak will kneel
For the strength of steel

Your mind begins to reel
With the strength of steel
Makes your blood congeal
I have nothing, nothing to conceal
For the strength of steel
For the strength of steel

Only power to reveal
With the strength of steel
And a love that's real
For the strength of steel
A metallic meal

With the strength of steel
And with my approved seal
With the strength of steel
To you I make, make my appeal
For the strength of steel
You've got to have a metallic meal
Just for the love and strength of steel
For the strength of steel
