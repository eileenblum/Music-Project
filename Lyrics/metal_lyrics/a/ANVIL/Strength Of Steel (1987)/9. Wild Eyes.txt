[Dodson]

Wild eyes I can't look away from your wild eyes
Wild eyes I'm blind to the day from your wild eyes
Wild eyes I'm hypnotized by your wild eyes
Wild eyes My soul cries for your wild eyes
Evil knows I fell
In your evil spell

Wild eyes as blue as the skies they was wild eyes
Wild eyes a wicked disguise they was wild eyes
Wild eyes burnin' with fire wild eyes
Wild eyes filled with desire your wild eyes
Let me rest awhile
Near your fiery smile

Wild eyes I'm comin' to get you now wild eyes
Wild eyes I'm willin' to let you now wild eyes
Wild eyes I'm takin' you home with me wild eyes
Wild eyes I've got to be alone with your wild eyes
Evil knows I fell
In your evil spell
I fell for your wild eyes
