[Lips, Reiner, Allison, Dickson]

Night has fallen
And the darkness hides an evil one
Feel his presence
Ever lurking in the shadows there
You can't see him but he's near

Prowling danger
Gazing unseen through his blackened cloak
Features masked
He's poised to take your life
Cutting deep your flesh
His steely knife
Coldly steals your life

The kiss of death

Daylight dawning
A fallen victim waiting to be found
Badly bleeding
Screaming sirens, people gather round
It's too late to run in fear

The kiss of death
Death is near
The kiss of death
Shed a tear
