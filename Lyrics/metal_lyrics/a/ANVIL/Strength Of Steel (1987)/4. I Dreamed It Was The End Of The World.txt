[Lips, Reiner, Allison, Dickson]

Am I living in a nightmare
Are these thoughts within my head
I don't know what the truth is
Am I alive or am I dead?

In sorrow
No tomorrow
Dead silence

People on the sidewalk
Become shadows on the wall
The world has turned to cinders
The answer to Satan's call

Oh I thank God it's only a dream
Fantasy
It's only a dream
Awake with a scream

[Chorus]

I dreamed it was the end of the world
The children of God had burned
I dreamed it was the end of the world
In the bowels of hell they churned

Onward christian soldiers
Ashes in the dust
Dignity and honour
Gave way to greed and lust

Oh I thank God it's only a dream
Fantasy
It's only a dream
Awake with a scream

No one heeds the warning
No one sees the light
Forever till the morning
Escape from the endless night

In sorrow
No tomorrow
Dead silence
Wasted violence

[Chorus]
