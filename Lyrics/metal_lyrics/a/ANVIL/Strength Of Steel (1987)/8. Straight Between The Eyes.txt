[Lips, Reiner, Allison, Dickson]

Make out, watch out
That's what this is all about
Never get enough of it
Go down, look around
Tell me baby what you've found
Better get a hold of it
Unzip kinda hip
Babe I think I got your trip
You're trying to impress me
Look now saying "Wow!"
But you're gonna try somehow
Baby don't depress me

It's your big chance
Don't - don't blow it
You only get one try
Hit you straight between the eyes

Lipstick does the trick
Won't you give my friend a lick?
Ring around the collar
Squeeze tight, all your might
Can you make me feel alright?
Make me hoot and holler

You only get one try
Hit you straight between the eyes
Straight between the eyes
Lookout!

Got a morning tent, space for rent
This is how your time is spent
Sitting on a flagpole
So sweet in the sheets
Baby can you dig the beat
Pounding out a drum roll
Bang bang let it hang
I can't wait to tell the gang
All about you passion
What fun now I'm done
And I really got to run
You know it's all the fashion

It's your big chance
Don't - don't blow it
You only get one try
Hit you straight between the eyes
Straight between the eyes
Straight between the eyes
I'm gonna hit ya, hit ya, hit ya, hit ya
Straight between the eyes
