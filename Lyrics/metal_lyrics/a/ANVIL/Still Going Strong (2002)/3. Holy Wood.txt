Jesus was crucified
Moses parted the sea
I saw it on a movie
On the TV
The bible is a book
That started with Adam and Eve
Filled with mambo jumbo
Do you believe?

Holy wood, holy shit

David and Goliath
Man and morality
Wars in the Middle East
A taste of reality
Ishmael and Isaac
Brothers in hate
Prewritten history
Does it tell us our fate?

Holy wood, holy shit

Our father who art in heaven (spit)

Written like a screen play
With morality implied
A priest diddles a choir boy
Truth can be denied
Politics, religion
Still go hand in hand
Draw you own conclusion
Draw your line in the sand
Jesus was crucified
Moses parted the sea
I saw it on a movie
On the TV

Holy wood, holy shit
