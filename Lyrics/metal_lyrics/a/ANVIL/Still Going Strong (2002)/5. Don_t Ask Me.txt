Never ending universe coming to an end
Oceans running dry, on what can we depend?
Alien abduction, sight a UFO
Decimated landscape, I don't want to know
Unanswered questions I ponder each day
Please don't you ask me, I have nothing to say?

Don't ask me for the answer
Don't ask me 'cause I don't know

Decomposing plastic, the sun going black
When will they push the button? When's the Messiah coming back?
Natural disaster, volcanoes erupt
Innocent convicted, justice is corrupt
Unanswered questions I ponder each day
Please don't you ask me, I have nothing to say

Don't ask me any questions
Don't ask me the status quo
Don't ask me for the answer
Don't ask me 'cause I don't know

Genetic engineering create a perfect clone
Find a cure for cancer, we're in the twilight zone
The end of all hostility, refugees set free
Peace and tranquillity, the final destiny
Unanswered questions day after day
Please don't you ask me, I really can't say

Don't ask me any questions
Don't ask me the status quo
Don't ask me for the answer
Don't ask me 'cause I don't know
Don't ask me any questions
Don't ask me which way to go
Don't ask me for the answer
Don't ask me 'cause I don't know
