Don't know where to begin
It comes from within
It's my story
Started as a boy
Music was my toy
It's my glory
Never passed a day
That I didn't play
My heart out
I'll never let it go
It's all I wanna know
That's what I'm about
That's what I'm about

I do it for the love
It's all I'm thinking of
It's in my heart
I feel it in my soul
It's my only goal
I do my part
Never will pass a day
That I won't play
My heart out
I'll never let it go
I'll just let you know
That's what I'm about
That's what I'm about
