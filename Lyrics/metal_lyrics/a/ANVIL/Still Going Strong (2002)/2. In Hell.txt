Fire and brimstone, sulphur smell
The home of evil in the depths of hell
Cauldrons a-boil with blood and bone
Your soul is taken for the devil to own

In hell

Toxic air and intense heat
Burning embers upon your feet
Drawn and quartered, disembowelled
When serving Satan is what you've vowed

Fire's burning in hell
In hell

Tortured souls must pay the price
Victims of their own device
Banished to this forsaken place
To stare upon the demon's face

Fire's burning in hell
In hell

Severed limbs and burned out eyes
No one cares and no one cries
On your knees you bend and cower
To bare your soul to be devoured

Fire's burning in hell
In hell
