There's a plant that we all know
As sweet sativa
Long sticky leaves and a frosty glow
Sweet little diva
Sweet sativa, never leave ya
Gets me through the stresses in my life

Sativa
Sweet sativa

Fragrant scent that you long to smoke
Sweet sativa
If you posses this to have a toke
I want to meet ya
Sweet sativa, never leave ya
Gets me through depression in my life

Sativa
Sweet sativa
Cannabis sativa

Grown by nature down in Mexico
Sweet sativa
Don't say it's bad, I don't wanna know
I won't believe ya
Sweet sativa, I'll never leave ya
Gets me through the boredom in my life
