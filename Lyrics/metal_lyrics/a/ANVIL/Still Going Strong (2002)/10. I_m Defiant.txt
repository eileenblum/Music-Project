I don't care what you say
I just live for today
I just do what I feel
A brazen heart made of steel
Nothing can stop me
I do it my way

I'm defiant

You can't tell me what to do
To myself I know I'm true
I defy and break the rules
The masses are asses, a bunch of fools
Nothing can stop me
I do it my way
No one can blame me
For being this way

[Chorus]

I'm defiant
Defiant

Against the grain is where I go
A rebel cause is all I know
A social misfit is on the loose
Making the life that I choose
Nothing can stop me
I do it my way
No one can blame me
For being this way

[Chorus]

I don't care what you say
I just live for today
I just do what I feel
Brazen heart made of steel
Nothing can stop me
I do it my way
No one can blame me
For being this way

[Chorus]
