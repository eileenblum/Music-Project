Dick Dale
Sure could wail
Haley rocked the clock
Chuck and Holly
Good golly Miss Molly
It was the birth of rock'n'roll
Beatles, Stones
Innovative tones
Hendrix burned his guitar
Acid rock
What a shock
Adolescence of rock'n'roll

[Chorus]

Parents said it's wrong
Don't listen to the devil's song
Critics said it won't last long
After 50 years still going strong
Still going strong
Still going strong, never will die
Still going strong
Still going strong, I tell no lie

Jimmy Page
All the rage
Cream was over the top
Rod and Beck
Deep Purple's living wreck
Black Sabbath sold their soul

[Chorus]

Still going strong
Still going strong, never will die
Still going strong
Still going strong, I tell no lie

Priest and Maiden came along
Anvil makes a metal song
Like a club that you belong
Here we are still going strong
