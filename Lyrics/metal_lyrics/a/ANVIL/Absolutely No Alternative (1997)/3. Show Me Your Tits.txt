I like 'em big, I like 'em small
I like 'em round, I love 'em all
I just want to look and see
What you got for me

I like 'em soft. I like 'em hard
Come on now, let down your guard
I just want to look and see
What you got for me
What you got for me

Show me, show me your tits
Show me what you got for me
Show me, show me your tits
Show me, I just want to see

I like 'em fake, I like 'em real
I like to look, I like to feel
I wish that I could have a squeeze
I just wanna tease

Now that it is legal
It's great without a doubt
Come on girls lose your shirts
And let them titties out

Improvements of women's rights
Let them do just what they might
I just want to look and stare
What you got to bear
What you got to bare

I just want to see
I just want to see
Your tits
