We love to spend our life in a tour bus on the road
In this song you get a glimpse, welcome to our abode
Been to many places, we've done alot of gigs
Trashed alot of women, we've lived like pigs

Never want to go home
Living bad to the bone

Red lights in Hamburg and whores on the street
Places like Amsterdam it seemed more discreet
I walked around the city squares till my feet were sore
Really don't care if I see another whore

Never want to go home
Action in the danger zone

Dance, dance, dance of the midnight tour
Dance, dance, dance of the red light whore
Dance, dance, dance of the midnight tour
Dance, dance, dance of the red light whore

Always a story waiting to unfold
Always a promoter leaving you out in the cold
I don't care about all that shit, I wanna have fun
I just wanna kick some ass until the day I'm done

Never want to go home
Living like a rolling stone

Another place I haven't been
Places that I haven't seen
Feeling tough and playing mean
