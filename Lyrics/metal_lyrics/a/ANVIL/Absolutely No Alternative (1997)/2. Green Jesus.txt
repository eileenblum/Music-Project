Anything for money is the philosophy today
It's become a religion, God is pay.
No matter what your colour, race or your cree
All for the love of money, living ain't for free

"Money makes the world go round" is what I've heard them say
Bowing to your paper God, screwing anyone in your way
The problem is that no one cares, it's become a diety
The root of all evil, melting down society

Green Jesus - let us pray
Green Jesus

Money can't buy happiness is what the rich believe
Poverty stricken homeless are sleeping in the street
The power and the money seem to go hand in hand
This popular religion is the king of the land

Dollars, Yen
Liras, Marks and Pesos, money to spend

Rubels, Francs and Kronen, moeny to lend

In fortune or poverty we all will survive
Social assistance seems to keep as alive
Criminal activity is rampant in the street
Who is God and what religion do you believe?

Dollars, Yen
Sheckels, Pounds and Guilders, money to spend
