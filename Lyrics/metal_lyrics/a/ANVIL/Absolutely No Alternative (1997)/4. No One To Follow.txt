What happened to all the great leaders
The ideals that they believed
They have all died and perished
With ideas that they conceived

What happened to the great war hero
The cause for what he fought
His medals were tarnished in Vietnam
His honour we forgot

No one to follow
No one to lead the way
No one to follow
Nothing is here to stay

What happened to trust and faith
For all the good they do
Corrupt church and child abuse
Have both obscured our view

Inconclusive
So illusive
In confusion
disolutioned

No one to follow
Nothing is here to stay

What happened to the laws of the land
Justice for all
Corner stones are broken
Civilization will fall

Inconclusive
So illusive
In confusion
disolutioned

No one to follow
No one to follow
No one to follow
No one to lead the way
No one to follow
Nothing is here to stay
