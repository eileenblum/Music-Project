When you think of all the great people that have died
The things they did, the way they lived their lives
Many have gone without knowing their fame
We are the ones that are left to blame

Examples of man's stupidity
Endless lessons in humility
Why do we wait till they're gone and dead?
We martyr their soul as the good book says

Hero by death
Hero by death
Hero by death

We shouldn't wait until tomorrow
Hail the greatness of today
We shouldn't wait for times of sorrow
Belated praise

Greatness of today
Greatness of today
Greatness of today

I never wait until tomorrow
I love the greatness of today
I never wait for times of sorrow
Listen what I say

When you think of all the great people that have died
The things they did, the way they lived their lives
Courage, honour and dignity
Leaving a mark in society
