Driving down the road, I see the brakelights ahead
Someone's crashed their car and they might be dead
Might be dead

I can't help myself, but I must look and see
All I can say is "I'm sure glad it's not me"

Rubberneck
Outta my way
Rubberneck

Tangled metal, glass fragments on the road
Jackknifed trailer has lost it's load
Lost it's load

I can't help myself, but I must look and see
All I can say is "I'm sure glad it's not me"

Caught in traffic, I hate the stress
Lining up to see the mess
I don't want to see
Another fatality

Flying truck tires smashing down from the sky
Greed of industry cause people to die
People die

Foot on the gas pedal, then on the brake
I think I've had all I can take
I can't help myself, but I must look and see
All I can say is "I'm sure glad it's not me"
