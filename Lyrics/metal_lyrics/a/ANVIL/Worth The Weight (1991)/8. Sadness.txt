The story's been told a million fold
Of an artist's search for fame
As the years go by
His soul cries out in vain

All in fun when all's been done
Can you bear the weight
The tears you cry
Will never change your fate

Lust for life
And hands that worked so clever
The sadness lasts forever

When the battles been lost a costly cost
Rotting in the grave
As the years go by
The world is left to blame
