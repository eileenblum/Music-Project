I gotta reservation
For the man who thinks he's brave
He's got a fascination
That'll take him to his grave
Mental masturbation
Euphoria in the state
When your heart's in trepidation
You'll know that it's too late

A witch doctor's prescription
A spoonful must go down
An addicted condition
Gonna put you in the ground

Goin' to a pow wow
Arrow through the heart
Goin' to a pow wow
Rip your soul apart

There's an evil possession
That burns your soul within
There will be no restitution
You know you'll never win

Spirit in the sky
Your living the big lie
Spirit in the sky
You know you're gonna die

Spirit in the sky
Your living the big lie
Spirit in the sky
You know you're gonna die
