Incest sodomy sadomasochism and rape
In the Christendom make no mistake
Bigamy buggery bestiality and pain
The whole damn world has gone insane

It's all a question of morality
Who's to go to hell
Reputed guilt repent thy sins
Tell me where this evil begins
Whose to judge these bloody deeds
It's society's heart that always bleeds

Sins, sins of the flesh
Sins, sins of the flesh

Fornication child molestation the consumption of your soul
It's hard to believe men can stoop so low
Torture murder necrophilia sickness of the mind
Outrageous blasphemy against mankind

It's all a question of morality
Who's to go to hell
And whose to judge these bloody deeds
Society's heart that always bleeds

Cold hard facts are sometimes hard to take
Look hard in the mirror and pray it's not too late

No more questioning morality
'Cause we all may go to hell
God will judge these bloody deeds
Damned to hell the devil's fire it feeds
