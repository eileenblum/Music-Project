Pennies on your eyes
Weeping widow cries
Flowers for the dead
A handful of dirt to spread
Formaldehyde veins
Presevation for your brains
Buried in your shroud
Looking oh so proud

Gonna do you up right
Put you on display tonight

Death is a truth
It could strike you in your youth
Destined to die
Just hope you've said good-bye
Prepare you for your final end
The mortician is your only friend
When you die!

Embalmer, send you to your grave
Embalmer, you know you must be brave
Embalmer, send you to your grave
Embalmer

Six feet underground
Is where we're all bound
The signing of your will
Before you're dead and still

Gonna do you up right
Put you on display tonight

Embalmer, send you to your grave
Embalmer, you know you must be brave
The mortician is your only friend
When you die!

No one's life to save
We're all going to our grave
We're not built to last
Life ends much too fast
Enjoy it if you can
Live a long life span
Bereavement for your death
Holding your last breath
Prepare you for your final end
The mortician is your only friend
When you die!

Embalmer, send you to your grave
Embalmer, you know you must be brave
Embalmer, send you to your grave
Embalmer, you know you must be brave
Embalmer
Embalmer
