Overdraft and NSF
When I sign my name
All in the line of duty
When playing in the game
A piece of the pie, cut of the take
Nothing left for me
Keep your eye on the money
Livin ain't for free

I wanna know
Where does all the money go?
I wanna know
Where does all the money go?

Bankrupt and out of cash
Never pay bills on time
Interest and mortgage rates
Are always on the climb
Income tax and revenue
Are something to evade
No need to worry
When you got it made

Administrative aggravation
Monetary deprivation
All in all the situation's hopeless
Contractual reciprocation
Financial evaluation
After all negotiations

I wanna know
Where does all the money go?

Repossess your furniture
Foreclosure on your loan
No way to call for help
When the disconnect your phone
Bouncing cheques and credit cards
Only time to borrow
Living on a shoe string
Where will I be tomorrow?

Where does it go?!
