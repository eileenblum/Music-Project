Gotta new lover
Better take cover
Got some advice
You'd better think twice
Arrow's in the quiver
When you're ready to deliver
Weenie wrap
To collect the sap
Stretch and Seal a meal
It just don't feel real
12 or 24 to the pack
Find them on the drugstore rack

Safe sex
If I abstain
I'll go insane
Safe sex
Give me sleaze
And not disease

Electro-tested for tears and leaks
Lubricated prophylactic sheiks
Get it up, get it on!

yank it, crank it
Piggies in a blanket
Clean your gun
When it's all done
Vacuum packed for your protection
Sanitized to fight infection
