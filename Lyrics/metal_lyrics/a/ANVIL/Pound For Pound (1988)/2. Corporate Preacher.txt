Your eyes are open but do you really see
Unhearing ears that won't listen to thee
You speak in riddles, it's a twisted truth
It makes me wonder who's corrupting the youth?

You read the scriptures but did you understand
You cast the first stone from your almighty hand
You say that all is black when there is white
No need to show me, show me the light

Corporate preacher
Disgracing the cross
Corporate preacher

TV church, it's big business time
Please won't you tell me what's your new prophet's line?

Cursed from above

An Ernest smile as you Swaggart on stage
A Bakker's dozen turn the page
Words of truth spoken in lies
You milk the faithful with your cryin eyes
Don't try to tell me how to run my life
When you can't be faithful even to your wife
