Pick your partner, nice and tight
'Cause we'll do more than dance tonight
Now promenade that's how it goes
You bucks beware of dosie dose
Dosie dose
Allemande in and allemande out
Hip your partner, make her shout
Make her shout
Back to the front or side to side
Tip your cap and come inside
Down with her fishnets up with her skirt
Dig a little deeper till ya hit paydirt

Toe Jam

Checkin' out her bedspan takin' it slow
Honey does your pussy scratch, don't you wanna know?
Up to the ceiling, down to the floor
If she rattles her heels ya know she wants more
Till she wants more
Right leg up, left leg down
Third leg out and shake it all around
Boys on bottom, girls on top
Dance all night never gonna stop

Toe Jam

Ladies choice, now choose your beau
Show 'em everything you know
Bow to the west, bow to the east
Bend for the guy that you love best
That you love best
Girls out front, boys behind
Don't be shy to bump and grind
Sweep the lady off her feet
Swing her around to the bouncing beat
Ladies in the centre, now gents take care
Hold her down, don't let her rear
Dip and dive, you're on your own
Bow to your partner and drive her home!
