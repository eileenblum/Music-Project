Getting off my ass
Getting on my feet
Gotta get going, I'm ready to compete
Keeping the pace
Gonna win the race
I'm running, I'm running, running for my life
I'm running, I'm running, running for my life

Off with a quickstart
Fast as I can go
Make it to the finish line is all I wanna know
Don't wanna be lame
Fonna win the game
I'm running, I'm running, running for my life
Living for the dream
Victory supreme
Winning is all that I like

I'm running, I'm running, running for my life
Running for my life

Living for the dream
Victory's supreme
Winning is all that I like
