[Bonus Track]Hey being me is what I want to do
I want to make my dreams all come true
DedicationÂ´s what IÂ´ve been taught
Hold on to what you got
RazorÂ´s edge and beinÂ´ me

What I want to be what I want to be

Music from the soul and imagination
Take away all my frustration
The worldÂ´s locked out and I got the key
IÂ´m the maker of my destiny

What I want to be
What I want to be what I want to be
What I want to be what I want to be

Hey being me is what I want to do
I make my dreams all come true
Dedication is all I know
Hold on and donÂ´t let go
Stop regrettinÂ´ and being me

What I want to be what I want to be
What I want to be what I want to be
What I want to be what I want to be hey

Thanks to thomaslanders for sending track #15 lyrics.
