[Limited Edition Bonus Track]

Woke up this morning ready for the night
Rolled out of bed just to see the light
Gotta get going, gotta get on my way
To get to the night, gotta make it through the day
I long to see the setting of the sun
I just can't wait until this day is done

[Chorus:]
Tonight is coming
Tonight is coming
All day long
All day long
Tonight is coming
All day long
Tonight is coming
All day long
All day long

By midafternoon the sun is high in the sky
I'm just waiting for the light, the light to die
Time so far away
Minutes seem like hours in a never ending day
Never ending day

Tonight is coming
All day long
Tonight is coming
All day long
All day long
