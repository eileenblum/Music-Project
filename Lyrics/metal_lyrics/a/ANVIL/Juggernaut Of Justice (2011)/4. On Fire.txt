The music flows so free
The songs inside of me
That never seem to fade
The many things I've seen
And everywhere I've been
And all the songs that I've played

The choices that I've made
That I would not betray
Then I would feel so lost
The voice that is within
That I could not begin
Without accepting the cost

[Chorus:]
On fire
On fire
I'm on fire
I'll never burn out
On fire
On fire
I'm on fire
Of this have no doubt

I know that I will never let go
I know that I will always grow

I love just what I do
Won't stop until I'm through
Never take me away
I give it all I got
You know I'll never stop
You know I'm here to stay

[Chorus]

On fire
On fire
I'll never burn out
On fire
On fire
