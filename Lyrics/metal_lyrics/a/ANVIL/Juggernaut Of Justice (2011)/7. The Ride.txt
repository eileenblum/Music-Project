Climb aboard, we're sailing to this wonderland
Hurry now, take this ride while you can
Come and see inside
You'll be satisfied

[Chorus:]
This ride
On this ride

Be aware, there'll be some swells along the way
Nightly storms seperate the days of grey

Follow rolling tide
Join us on this ride

[Chorus x2]

On and on, then end is always out of reach
That's OK, no hurry to get on the beach
Come and see inside
You'll be satisfied

[Chorus x2]

This ride
