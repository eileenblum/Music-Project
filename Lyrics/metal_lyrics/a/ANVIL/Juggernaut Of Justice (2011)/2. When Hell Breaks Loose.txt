Trapped aggression that needs explode
Fire all cannons ready for reload
Burning anger that's ready to ignite
Fists will fly and settle this tonight

Blistering vengeance, the hatred's alive
A grip on your throat, you'll never survive
Vicious emotion, begin to see red
Blood thirsty thoughts within your head

[Chorus:]
When Hell breaks loose
I'm ready to kill
When Hell breaks loose
You know I will
When Hell breaks loose
I'm ready to kill
When Hell breaks loose
You know I will

Anger burns the flame
Set to go insane
All are in a craze
Decimate and set it all ablaze

Tormented resentment, all you can find
Virtue and honour are in a decline
Brutal violence and boiling blood
Let it die drowning in the mud

[Chorus]

When Hell breaks loose
When Hell breaks loose
When Hell breaks loose
