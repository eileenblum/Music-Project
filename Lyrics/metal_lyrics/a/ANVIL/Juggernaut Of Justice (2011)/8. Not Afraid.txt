Not afraid of looking back
Not afraid of what I lack
I'm not afraid of just moving on
Not afraid of the dark
Not afraid to leave a mark
I'm not afraid of what's gone

[Chorus:]
Not afraid
Not afraid

Not afraid of getting caught
Not afraid to take a shot
I'm not afraid of just being me
Not afraid to take a chance
Not afraid of lost romance
I'm not afraid, can't you see?

[Chorus]

I believe in my way
'Til the end of the day
Straight from the heart
The way I will behave
I will be brave
Right from the start

Not afraid of what I know
Not afraid of letting go
I'm not afraid of just running free
Not afraid of being had
Not afraid when things go bad
I'm not afraid what will be

[Chorus]

I believe in my way
Til' the end of the day
Straight from the heart
The way I will behave
I will be brave
Right from the start

[Chorus]
