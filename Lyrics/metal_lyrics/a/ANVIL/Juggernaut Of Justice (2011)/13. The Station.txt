[Limited Edition Bonus Track]

Waiting at the station early in the day
Trying to catch a train to get me on my way
Walking around the station feeling alone
Just get me home

[Chorus:]
The station
The station

Empty faces all passing me by
The pain in my heart, my soul
My thoughts that linger remain until I die
I said goodbye

I won't forget
I won't regret
All of the time we had
Now I'm all alone
On my way home
On my own

[Chorus]

When the train comes and takes me away
Wishing and hoping won't make me stay
Another moment, just another day
I'm on my way

I won't forget
I won't regret
All of the time we had
Now I'm all alone
On my way home
On my own

[Chorus x2]
