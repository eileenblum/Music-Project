People talking, but they just don't know
Truth is hidden, lies begin to flow
Broken phone, the facts go wrong
Great deception don't take long

Take belief in what they say
Before you know it, it's all gone astray

Conpiracy
It's a conspiracy
You'll never know it's a conspiracy
Conpiracy

The suspicion grows
What they let us know

Illuminati's society
Agendas to ruin the economy
Financiers are going bankrupt
Those responsible are all corrupt

Conpiracy
It's a conspiracy
Conpiracy
It's a conspiracy

Conpiracy
