[Chorus:]
Turn it up
Turn it up

Make it loud so we all can hear
Yell it loud when you start to cheer
Don't tell me that I can't relate to you

[Chorus x2]

Show support and that you care
Clench your fist and punch the air
Don't tell me that I can't get through to you

[Chorus]

On eleven we're all in Heaven
When it's loud we're feeling proud
With the power the weak will cower
Hear the sound shake the ground
It's the drive that makes you feel alive

[Chorus]

Give it all without a fear
I want to hear you all loud an clear
Don't tell me that I can't relate to you

[Chorus]

On eleven we're all in Heaven
When it's loud we're feeling proud
With the power the weak will cower
Hear the sound shake the ground
It's the drive that makes you feel alive

[Chorus]

Give it volume so we can hear
Yell it hard when you cheer
Turn it up with your pride
Turn it up, the children' cried

[Chorus]

Stand on your feet and show you care
Clench your fist and punch the air

Turn it up, never to fall
Turn it up, said one, said all
On eleven we're all in Heaven
No hearing aid, don't be afraid
To turn it up loud
