When enough is enough and you still want more
Heading towards the exit door
Finding the power within your soul
Turn it around to make your goal

You got the time, you got the knack
You got the drive to make it back
Dedication is all you know
Hold on and don't let go

I don't stop for nothing
Never going to give it up
I just keep on going
Won't stop 'til I win the cup

[Chorus:]
I'm finding my way - Fucken Eh!
You know it's what I say - Fucken Eh!
I'm finding my way - Fucken Eh!
You know I'm here to stay

[Chorus]

Fucken Eh!
Fucken Eh!
Fucken Eh!
Fucken Eh!
Fucken Eh!
Fucken Eh!
Fucken Eh!
Fucken Eh!
Fucken Eh!
