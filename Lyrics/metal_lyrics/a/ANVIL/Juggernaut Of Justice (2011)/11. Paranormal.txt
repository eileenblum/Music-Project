Shadow on my shoulder
Someone's watching me
Shadow on my shoulder
A lost entity
Subtle and silent
A whisper on the wind
Benevolent and quiet
Uneasiness sets in

Covert and controlling
Random acts of fate
Conscious yet consolling
Opportunity's the bait
Coincidence, cohesion
Right time and place
Spirit of believing
In that mindspace

Evidence can only be found within
Feel the presence under your skin
Shouldn't fear what you can't see
What will be is supposed to be
Let the spirit free

Shadow on your shoulder
Someone's watching you
Shadow on your shoulder
You can't believe it's true
Subtle and silent
A whisper on the wind
Benevolent and quiet
Uneasiness within

Paranormal, paranormal
Paranormal
Paranormal, paranormal
Paranormal

Evidence can only be found within
Feel the presence under your skin
Shouldn't fear what you can't see
What will be is supposed to be
Let the spirit free
