My soul's a fire that you can't put out
An avalanche of power
Flowing like a river of endless smite
My hunger that will devour
Title wave of perpetual force
That will never die
Driving force with no remorse
The falling of the sky
Hurricane out of control
You know I'm coming your way
The aggression in my blood
Living for today

[Chorus:]
Juggernaut of justice
It's what we want to be
Juggernaut of justice
The truth will set you free

My desire is an endless void
Never to be filled
Eternal hunger that never dies
And never to be killed
Landslide of intensity
Never gonna stop
Loving power will devour
All the way to the top
Hurricane out of control
You know I'm coming your way
The aggression in my soul
Blow you all away

[Chorus]

Juggernaut of justice
Juggernaut of justice
Juggernaut of justice
