Magical gris-gris and mojo bag
Ason rattle, Tongue of Dan

In he Badji a sacred alter room
So begins the ritual of the dead man's tomb
Superstition where it's been said
Rituals to wake the dead, wake the dead

[Chorus:]
New Orleans Voo Doo
New Orleans Voo Doo

Giyon is said to mean bad luck
Sound of the ogan, the bell is struck
Rituals to wake the dead, wake the dead

On the cord drum. tanbou fey
The Voo Doo priest begins to play
The kwa-kwa rattle keeps in beat
The Nago dance in the summer heat
Superstition where it's been said
Rituals to wake the dead, wake the dead

[Chorus x3]
