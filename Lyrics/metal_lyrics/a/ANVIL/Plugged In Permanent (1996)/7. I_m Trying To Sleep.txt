I hate the sound of an alarm clock in my ear
When I've been up all night downing a case of beer
I pray the Lord my soul for him to keep
Don't you know that my rest just don't come cheap

Fuck off I'm trying to sleep
I'm trying to sleep

Too much coffee I need a sleeping pill
I need a rest but ya know I never will
I've been awake so long feels like the four day creep
It won't be long before they bury me six feet deep

When I get tired and longing for my bed
I plug my ears, hide my achin' head
I shut the world out, my seclusion is deep
All I really want is to get some sleep

A woman's touch is keeping me awake
When it's morning I'm gonna need a break
My mind's in shambles, my body's in a heap
If I don't get some shut eye I'm gonna start to weep
