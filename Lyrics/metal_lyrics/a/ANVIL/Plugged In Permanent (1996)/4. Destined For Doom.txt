You say we're living in the land of the free
The price is poison for the earth and the sea
Liberty and justice are the American way
But there's crime in the streets where the children play

All are equal in the eyes of God
Police brutality makes law a fraud
Martin Luther had a great dream
But his death was senseless, tragic, obscene

Destined destined
Are we destined for doom
Destined destined
Making our tomb

You know the answers lays within
Give good a chance to win
It is the land of the free
Ain't no place that I'd rather be

E pluribus unum in God we trust
Then why are we living in greed and lust
We have our freedom, freedom of speech
But then again who am I to preach

Destined for doom
Destined for doom
