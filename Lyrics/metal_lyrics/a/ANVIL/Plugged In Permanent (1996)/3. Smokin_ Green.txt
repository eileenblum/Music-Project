Smokin'!
Every waking moment of every single day
I roll a big fat joint to get me on my way
It changes my outlook, you know it sets me right
Oh how I love it for showing me the light

It's so cool It's my school I ain't no fool.
Smokin' green, smokin' green
Under the influence I've been

When I'm feeling shitty, I mean really feeling down
You never have to worry when there's tons of green in town
It's become a habit, a habit till the end
I can't but have it, have it as a friend

Every waking moment of every bloody day
I roll a big fat joint to get me on my way
Some people think it's evil, they just can't conceive
It's all a matter of taste and what you believe

Smokin' green, smokin' green
Under the influence I've been
