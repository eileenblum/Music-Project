Receive a summons from the court
Every day you must report
Sitting in a jury box
Listen to the lawyers talk
Evidence must be presented
While the jury's lives have been pre-empted
Defendant must make a plea
He just wants to be set free

A duty to the justice system
Trial is the way to covict them
After witness and defendant have voiced
Is when the jury makes it's choice

Barter plea
For all the world to see

Guilty, guilty
The jury finds you guilty
Guilty, guilty
The jury finds you guilty

The jury must deliberate
A guilty verdict cops appreciate
When evidence proves to incriminate
A sentence the judge will initiate
To find you guilty on all accounts
It must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt
When you break the law you must do your time
And pay the system for your crime

Barter plea
For all the world to see
To see

Guilty, guilty
The verdict says your guilty
Guilty, guilty
The jury finds you guilty
Guilty, guilty
The verdict says your guilty
Guilty, guilty
The jury finds you guilty
Barter plea
For all the world to see
