High gear rider
Take me to the top
Get me to the summit
I'm never gonna stop
Feel my body pumping
Carrying my load
Taking the incline
Getting ready to explode

Takin' the hill
Just for the thrill
Honin' my skill
Up and down on Killer Hill
Killer Hill
Take me where I wanna go
In for the thrill
Take me where I wanna go

Rock shock and cattle head
Take the terrain
Sopping in sweat
My breath to regain
Feel the breaking calipers
Squeezing on the rim
Super power riding
Keeps me hard and fit for trim

Killer Hill
Killer Hill

Take me where I wanna go
In for the thrill
Take me where I wanna go
Killer Hill
Take me where I wanna go
In for the thrill
Take me where I wanna go
Killer Hill
Take me where I wanna go
In for the thrill
Take me where I wanna go
Killer Hill
