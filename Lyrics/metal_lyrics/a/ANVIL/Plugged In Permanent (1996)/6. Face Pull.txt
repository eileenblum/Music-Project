In through the out door
Out through the in
No matter what you do
It'll make your head spin
Make your head spin
Round and round your head goes
When it stops you'll never know

It's hard to sleep at night
When there's things to do
You could almost die of fright
To yourself be true

Face pull
I always worry
Face pull
I'm in a hurry

I try to do it right
Do it my own way
Learn from mistakes
And you know you're here to stay
Here to stay
Back and forth and up and down
You won't turn me around

It's hard to sleep at night
You do what you must do
It will take all your might
To yourself be true

Face pull
I'm in a hurry
Face pull
I always worry

Face pull
I'm in a hurry
Face pull
