My favourite type of dancing is done upon a bed
Moving to the music that plays within my head
Learning all the dance steps, point flex plie tendu
Bending over backwards, on point I'll be for you
Tarantella
A midnight dance for me

[Chorus:]
Mattress, mattress mambo
Mattress, do the mattress mambo

Bouncing off the headboard, slip on satin sheets
Titillating tango in the bedroom can't be beat
Waltzing Matilda
A midnight dance with me

[Chorus]

Hiphop, Jazz and Breakdance, it all seems the same
Moshing, Disco and Raving are all just as lame
My favourite type of dancing is done upon a bed
Moving to the music that plays within my head
Tea for two
A midnight dance for you

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
