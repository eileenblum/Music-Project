You know I've heard it all before, I'll hear it all again
I know just where I'm going and I know just where I've been
I've seen so many come and go but somehow I survive
I know I will die someday, but I'm glad to be alive
Glad to be alive
The strong survive

I've got a life to lead, I care if I succeed
I got to find my way
I've got a life to lead, I take just what I need
That's where I will stay
That's where I'll stay

I can't tell the future, I can't give a prophecy
Doing what it take to make my destiny
I can't help but wonder, but much to my surprise
Doing what I want with no trace of compromise
No compromise!
I tell no lies!

I've got a life to lead, you know my soul is freed
I'm finding my way
I've got a life to lead, you know my soul is free
'Til the end of the day

I don't know who said it first, losers never last
Having no direction can make it end so fast
See so many come and go but somehow I survive
I know I will die someday, but I'm glad to be alive
Glad to be alive
The strong survive

I've got a life to lead, I am the hardened breed
I know the way
I've got a life to lead, I am the hardened breed
You know I'm here to stay
Here to stay!
