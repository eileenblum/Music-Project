A failed marriage left the mother to care
Love is gone but the kid's are still there
A broken home has become commonplace
The look of anguish on the child's face
Gone and lost

Being there just for conception
Made a promise that was all a deception
Gone and lost

[Chorus 1:]
Deadbeat dad, support he won't pay
Deadbeat dad always staying away
Deadbeat dad in disgrace and despair
Deadbeat dad, to the kids it's not fair

Biology can only go so far
When your gone it leaves a scar
Children learn to live without
Being there is what it's all about
Gone and lost
Pay the cost

[Chorus 2:]
Deadbeat dad lost in a haze
Deadbeat dad set in his ways
Deadbeat dad, a loser at heart
Deadbeat dad won't do his part

Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad

[Chorus 1]
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
Deadbeat dad
