Revenge's a dish best served when it's cold
I'm a predator, a wolf in the fold
Menace to society, a deranged psychopath
I'm the bastard who brings on the blood bath
Taking vengeance out in the street
I'm the criminal police can't defeat
Murder, mayhem my claim to fame
Brutal violence dominate my game
I want to destroy you and your kind
By now you know my vengeance is blind
I hate you all, you'll be the sacrifice
Be the victim of my explosive devise

Park it, park it, park it, park that truck
Park it, park it, park it, park that truck
Park that truck

Terrorism, anarchy is all that I crave
I want to see you all rot in your grave
I'm the one that you least suspect
A social outcast that gets no respect
By now you know my vengeance is blind
I want to destroy you and your kind
Don't try to cross me, you'll pay the price
Be a victim of my explosive device

[Verse 1]

Park it, park it, park that truck
Park it, park it, park it, park that truck
Park it, park it, park that truck
Park it, park it, park it, park that truck
Park that truck
Park that truck
