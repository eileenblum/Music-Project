There were two young boys with a murderous 
plan frustrated with their lives
Evil thoughts went through their heads like a thousand knives
No one thought they'd really do it but much to our surprise
Using guns their father bought was part of the demise

They took their guns and ammo and one sat on the hill
The other pulled the fire alarm and they waited for the kill

Bullets flying
People dying
Blood in the playground
Blood in the playground

Blood in the playground

On the bloody ground the people lay, 
some were already dead
A teacher shielding her students 
took the wound from which she bled
The perpetrators of this crime, 
they were apprehended
This story is sad but true, 
that is how it ended

It's saddening
It's maddening
Blood in the playground
Blood in the playground
