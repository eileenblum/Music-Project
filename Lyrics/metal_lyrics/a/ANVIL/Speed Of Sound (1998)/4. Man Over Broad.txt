There's a man over broad
Casting with his fishing rod
Looking for a bite
Catch a meal tonight

On the star broad bow
The seaman know just how
Trawling from the stern
On the hook your worm
Baiting, waiting, anticipating
Skinboat to tuna town
Skinboat to tuna town
Ship to shore
Back for more
Skinboat to tuna town
Skinboat to tuna town

There's a man over broad
He ain't just catching cod
Teach you how to whale
On his ship you will sail
Baiting, waiting, anticipating
Skinboat to tuna town
Ship to shore
Back for more
Skinboat to tuna town
Skinboat to tuna town
Skinboat to tuna town
Skinboat to tuna town
