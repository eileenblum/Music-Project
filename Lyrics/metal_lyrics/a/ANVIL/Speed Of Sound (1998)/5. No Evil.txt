Living in a daydream is the way some people live
Stubborn in their ways, no compromise to give
Locking out the real world, letting nothing in
Believing that the world is bad and evil is within

[Chorus 1:]
Hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil

Influence and environment can be detrimental
Hiding from reality, is sure to drive you mental
You have to know the fact remains, evil won't disappear
There is no sense spending your life living in fear

[Chorus 2:]
Hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
Speak no evil, see no evil, hear no evil

Taking on all obstacles and making a stand
Not being like an ostrich with your head in the sand
Good or bad accept it all, take it in stride
Evil is abound, there is no place to hide

[Chorus 2]
