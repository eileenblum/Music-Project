[Japanese Bonus Track]I hate the world and everything thatÂ´s in it
I want to kill them all donÂ´t care if they know I did it
I pack a gun IÂ´m on the run and IÂ´m not afraid to use it

I hate the law and the justice system
I think itÂ´s sad thereÂ´s no shred of wisdom
Turns my heart cold with hate years go by now itÂ´s late

Vengeance to kill vengeance to kill
Vengeance to kill vengeance to kill
Vengeance to kill vengeance to kill
Vengeance to kill vengeance to kill

I hate the world and donÂ´t think I can change it
I want to kill them all but IÂ´ll probably never do it
I pack a pen I hope I offend and IÂ´m not afraid to use it
Drive a point home to you is all that I want to do

Vengeance to kill vengeance to kill
Vengeance to kill vengeance to kill
Vengeance to kill vengeance to kill
Vengeance to kill vengeance to kill
