Turbine starts, engines whine
Rocket fire, you know it s blast off time
Burning fuel, deadly tool
Break the sky, shock wave blast, ripping fast

The speed of sound, speed of sound
The speed of sound, speed of sound

Sonic boom, machine of doom
The power to fly, bird's eye view, climbing to

[Chorus:]
The speed of sound, speed of sound
The speed of sound, speed of sound
The speed of sound, speed of sound
The speed of sound, speed of sound

High speed flight, vapour trail
Thunderous thrust, hear the engine s wail
After burn, no return
The angel's cry, searing speed, the power to exceed

[Chorus 2X]
