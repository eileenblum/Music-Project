Weapons of mass destruction may one day be employed
The human race is poisoned as chemical warfare's deployed
There's nowhere to run to and there is nowhere to hide
Dawning of the dead and the endless homicide

[Chorus:]
Zombie
Zombie
Zombie Apocalypse
Zombie
Zombie
Zombie
Zombie Apocalypse

Mindless mobs of mutants, the walking living dead
Migratory frenzy, the disease begins to spread

[Chorus]

Then civilization will fall
There'll be no justice for all
For all

Death and destruction becoming a routine
Only just a thought in reality obscene
Virus and bacteria, the biochemical host
Extinction of humanity, nothing but a ghost

[Chorus]
Zombie
Zombie
Zombie
Zombie
Zombie
Zombie
