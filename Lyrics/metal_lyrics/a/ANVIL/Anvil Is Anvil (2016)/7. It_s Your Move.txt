When you turn is up and you've made a choice
Waiting to hear your opponent's voice
It's the never ending game we play
How will you win or lose and pay?

[Chorus:]
It's your move
It's your move
It's your move
It's your move

Counting cards and loaded dice
The cheater's hand and the loser's vice
Ace of spades and the joker is wild
The odds against you are stacked and piled

[Chorus]

It's your move

Move a pawn and protect the king
To win the game, that's the thing
Game of cards, a game of chess
The need to win more than less

[Chorus 3x]

It's your move
