Moving in the fast lane, down the rails we go
Nothing to stop you, for miles on end you flow
Building speed and power, on the razor's edge we shift
Only on one rail, reaction must be swift
It must be swift

[Bridge:]
Coming to a mountain hill, there is no turning back
When we hit the bottom curve we'll jump right off the track

[Chorus:]
Train
Runaway train
Train
Runaway train

The sound of squealing steel as we try to brake
Sparks and heat from the hotbox, how much will it take?
Will it take?

[Bridge]

Moving down the rail
Brakes begin to fail
There's no time to bail

Santa Fe Express, moving down the rail
Cargo load, we're moving, must get there without fail
Without fail

[Bridge]

[Chorus 2x]
Train
Runaway train
