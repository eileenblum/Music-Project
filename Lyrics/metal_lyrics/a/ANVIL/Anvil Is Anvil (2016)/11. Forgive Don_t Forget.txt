[Chorus:]
Forgive
Don't forget
Forgive
Don't forget

Dignity is earned
A lesson to be learned

[Chorus]

History that's past
The memories must last
The rattling of a cage
The morbid outrage

[Chorus]

Capacity to forgive
With our conscience we live

Forgive
Don't forget

Not to have died in vain
It can never happen again
With love we should embrace
To save the human race

[Chorus]

Time is said to heal
It's time to make that deal

Forgive
Don't forget

Forgiveness with provision
An end to all division
To bring a final end
And to remain a perfect friend

[Chorus]

[Chorus]
