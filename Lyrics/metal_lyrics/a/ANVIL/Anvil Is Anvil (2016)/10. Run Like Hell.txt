Off to the race you run
As fast as a bullet from a gun
Beat the clock, you must try
As fast as you can, do or die

Bat outta hell you fly
To win the race, you must try
Competing to win against time
Be in condition and be in your prime

[Chorus:]
Run like hell
Got to get away
Run like hell
You just can't stay
Run like hell
You can't be late
Run like hell
Or seal your fate

On your feet
No retreat
With the flow
Away you go

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]
Run like hell
Run like hell
Run like hell
Run like hell
