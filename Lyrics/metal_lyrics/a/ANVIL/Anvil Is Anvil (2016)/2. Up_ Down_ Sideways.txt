Backwards and forwards and upside down
I'm the one who could say I've been around
Yes, I've been around
Use and abuse, built to last
Core of iron burning fast

[Chorus:]
Up down sideways
Up down sideways

Chaotic frenzy, a constant delight
Moth to a flame, shooting stars at night
Shooting stars at night
Adapt or die with no change
Variety is nice, can't be strange

[Chorus]

I will find a way
I live it every way
What can I say?

[Chorus]

Hands in the air, Ow! I've blown my fuse
Hold the temper, bound to lose
Bound to lose
Over the edge and back again
This in now and now's not then
Alright!

[Chorus 2x]
