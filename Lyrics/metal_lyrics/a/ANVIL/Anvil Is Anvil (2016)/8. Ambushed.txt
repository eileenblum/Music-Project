First time it happend I was five years old
They threw stones at me
Didn't listen to what I'd be told
I was too blind to see

I learned quick and I lost my trust
Enemy and friend
I have to do everything I must
For myself in the end

[Bridge:]
Beware
Unfair

[Chorus 1:]
Ambushed
Shot right in the back
Ambushed
Surprise attack

Life lessons come at great expense
Keep your eyes open wide
On the edge, living the suspense
Never lose your stride
Threat arises, stand your ground
Fight for your cause
Self belief is what you've found
You make your own laws

[Bridge]

[Chorus 2:]
Ambushed
Shot right in the back
Ambushed
Shot right in the back
Ambushed
Surprise attack

A coat of armour is what I wear
Locked without a key
In my mind I know what's fair
My eyes are open and I see
Threat arises I stand my ground
Fight for my cause
Self belief is what I've found
I make my own laws

Ambushed
Shot right in the back

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
