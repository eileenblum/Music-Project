Driving down the road on an icy storming night (night, night)
Doing what we can to surive this horrid drive of fright (fright, fright)
Every curve and every hill, holding on in fear (fear, fear)
Doing what we can not to break or to oversteer (steer, steer)
Wheels spinning, nothing to grip
Endless swerving, an endless trip
Everywhere cars and trucks that slid off in a ditch (ditch, ditch)
Driving in the freezing rain and ice can surely be a bitch (bitch, bitch)

[Chorus:]
Gotta get right down to it
Get ourselves right on through it
Gotta get right down to it
Right down to it
Right down to it
Get ourselves back home
Fire!
Fire on the highway
Fire!
Flames burning bright

Driving down the road when we came upon a sight (sight, sight)
Glowing gold and flickering, a truck burning to the far right (far right, far right)
Wheels smoking, smoldering fire
Air that's chocking, down to the wire
Driving right past our stay and wait for hours into the night (night , night)
Speed on through, don't hesitate before the gas ignites (ignites, ignites)

[Chorus]
Fire!
Fire on the highway
Fills the dark with light

Driving down the road on an icy storming night (night, night)
Doing what we can to surive this horrid drive of fright (fright, fright)
Wheels spinning, nothing to grip
Endless swerving, an endless trip
Every curve and every hill, holding on in fear (fear, fear)
Doing what we can not to break or to oversteer (steer, steer)

[Chorus]
Fire!
Fire on the highway

[Fire Chant:]
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!
Fire!

Fire!
Fire on the highway
Fire!
Flames in the night
Fire!
Fire on the highway
Explodes like dynamite

[Fire chant 4x]
