Sacrifice in the name of God
Ultimate price and the cause of fraud
So many died for their belief
All the murderous lies and grief
Controlling people with the fear of God
Cower before his staff and rod

[Chorus 1:]
Die for a lie
Living by the book
Die for a lie
It's all been mistook

Archaic world from which it came
All the dead and all the shame
The truth will rise for us to see
Conflicting lies buried where they should be

[Chorus 2:]
[Chorus 1]
Die for a lie
Living by the book
Die for a lie
Have another look

Archeology will one day show
The more we learn, the more we know
Where we come from and where we've been
What is our purpose and what does it mean?
Bow down and fall to your knees
Damned to hell, if you please

[Chorus 2]
