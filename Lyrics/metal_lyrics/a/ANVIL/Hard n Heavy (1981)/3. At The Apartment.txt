You give me love everynight
I'm the one that does it right
At your place in the dark
You get down and leave your mark
In the morning you're still awake
You look at me there's time to wait
You say you love the things I do
You can't stop until I'm through
You need a rest from me
When you need it you know where I'll be

You know there's no time to waste
Come on over I'll give you a taste
When you're with me it feels so right
Come with me and stay the night
You're the girl of my dreams
I want to tell you how much it means
You're the one I want so bad
I've been around, you're the best I've had
I love you baby, stay a while
I made me happy, you made me smile

You gave me the hint
At the apartment
Oooh yeah, at the apartment baby
