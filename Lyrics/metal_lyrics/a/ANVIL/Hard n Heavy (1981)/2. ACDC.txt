There's more than one way to play the game
Getting a charge, taking the blame
Resistance is low, gonna blow a fuse
Turn it up babe we got nothing to lose

AC - She'll go either way
DC - She'll blow you away
Hot lover with a loose connection

Thunder &amp; lightning, electricity
She set me at peak intensity
She's got me cumin', got me going
Shorted wires, circuits blowing

She's AC/DC
She is AC/DC
She is AC/DC
Yeah she is, ya know she is
Let me show ya

?????????
Signals just a comin' through
You better look out baby
?????????
Every word I hear

She is AC/DC
Ya know she is AC/DC
She likes it both ways - AC/DC
Oh let me tell ya - AC/DC
Oh right now - AC/DC
Oh yeah - AC/DC
She is AC/DC
