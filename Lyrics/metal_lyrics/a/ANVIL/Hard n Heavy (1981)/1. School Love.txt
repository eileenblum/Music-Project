Out in the school yard little Peaches play
Rubbing their beaves, they got a lot to say
Never doing work, teachers are mad
Really don't care 'cause they're never sad
Little school Peaches take a word from me
Got to do your work and that's the way to be

School Love
School Love

Caught in the can having some fun
Teachers on the prowl now you gotta run
Underneath the stairs safety for awhile
Feeling each other 'cause that's your style
Now that you are caught, caught in the act
Gonna be strapped and that's a fact

Keeping you apart, watching all the time
Punishment is due for a lover's crime
All you little girls have a lot to fear
Knowing your principal is so near
Doing it again, breaking all the rules
Teachers are coming, they're no bunch of fools
