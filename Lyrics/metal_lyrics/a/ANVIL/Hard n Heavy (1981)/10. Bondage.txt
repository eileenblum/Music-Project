Tie me down you mean old bag
Wrench the ropes down leave no sag
Crack the whip across my back
I love your hot and nasty attack

Oh bondage I'm uptight
Dig the feeling it's alright
Oh bondage I'm uptight
Dig the feeling it's alright

Tourniquets that could stop a flood
Cease the circulation of my blood
The sensation it is very rare
Don't stop it's too much to bare

It's so tight that I have to moan
You leave me empty, dry as a bone
Body's marred by torturous rope
I just can't quit it's too much to cope
Yeah to cope


Thanks to nwdrk13 for correcting track #3 lyrics.
