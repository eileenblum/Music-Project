I Know I tease you
And I know you like that
I know I please you
'Cause that's where it's at
I know you want me
It shines in your eyes
I know you'll take me
'Cause I hate your cries

Ooh Baby - I'm saying this to you
Ooh Baby - So let me on through
Ooh Baby - Oooh Baby - Yeah

I know I'll get you hot
There's no time to wait
I know you love it hot
I'm never too late
I know you like the things
That I always say
I know you want the thing
That's coming your way

Lookout!

Ooh baby
Ooh baby
