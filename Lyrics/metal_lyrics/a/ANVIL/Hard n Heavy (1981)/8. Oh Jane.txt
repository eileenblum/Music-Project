Oh Jane can you wait
I'm coming home, bit I'm running late
Just playing one more town
You know I miss you and I want you around
Oh Jane I'm alone
On the road but I'm coming home
I feel your love in my heart
And I hope that we will never part

Wish I was home to hold you tight
My hotel room is empty tonight
I want you with me let's make it a date
Oh Jane can you wait

Oh Jane can you wait
You give me love you don't hesitate
You worry that I'll stray
Never trust me when I'm away
Oh Jane stay with me
You know I want you that's the way it will be
I've told you I love you
Home or away I will always be true
