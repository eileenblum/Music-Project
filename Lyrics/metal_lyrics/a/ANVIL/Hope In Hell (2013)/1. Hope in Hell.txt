When damnation has begun and thereâs nowhere to run
In yourself do believe, what you put out will be about what you receive
You think that you're the only one whose chances are slim to none
Living just to find the way right from the start true to your heart you must stay,
You must stay
Hope in Hell, finding love and losing hate
Hope in Hell, enjoy your life itâs not too late
Itâs not too late
Salvation is all you need
When damnation has begun and chances are slim to none
Live your life and find a way straight from the heart
Right from the start every day, every way,
What I convey, every day
Hope in Hell, finding love and losing hate
Hope in Hell, enjoy your life, it's not too late
Hope in Hell, finding love and losing hate
Hope in Hell, don't stand in line, hell can wait
