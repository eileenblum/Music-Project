[Bonus Track]When you want the things you just canÂ´t have
And they seem just out of reach
You try and try but you just canÂ´t have
ItÂ´s something to beseech
Every day is like the hunt to find and eat a meal
Survival of the fittest a trial by ordeal

Hunger deep inside never to subside
Live or die you must have tried

Fire at will take the blame and live the thrill

Like a dirty trick being played on you
Luck never comes your way
Roll the dice itÂ´s a crap shoot
YouÂ´ll be back the very next day
To win the prize you must realize
Being there what itÂ´s about
Shed your fears dry your tears
And leave yourself no doubt

Hunger deep inside never to subside
Live or die you must have tried

Fire at will just take aim and shoot to kill
Fire at will take the blame and live the thrill

Have a course of action makinÂ´ use of a plan
Contemplate the circumstance doing what you can 
The hunt of desire you must do it every day 
Hit and miss living bliss 
In the catching of your prey

Hunger deep inside never to subside
Live or die you must have tried

Fire at will just take aim and shoot to kill
Fire at will take the blame and live the thrill
Fire at will just take aim and shoot to kill
Fire at will take the blame 
And live the thrill live the thrill
