Robotic world electric device
Computer driven heart of ice
Pressing the button
Throwing the switch
For better or worse
And not knowing which
Mechanized man a deadly threat
March to the future with no regret
Technical advancement what we achieve
Give us a cause something to believe
Under control, consume your soul
Mankind Machine, Mankind Machine
Mother of invention, find what you need
Electronic age the way to proceed
Remote control done from afar
Send a drone out to explore a star
Camera eyes focus and see
Imagination must be free
Under control, consume your soul
Mankind Machine, Mankind Machine
Mankind Machine, Mankind Machine
Mankind Machine, Mankind Machine
Robotic world electric device
Computer slave caught in a vice
Mechanized man a deadly threat
March to the future with no regret
Electric planet with no end
What's left of humanity on machine they depend
Under control, consume your soul
Mankind Machine, Mankind Machine
Mankind Machine, Mankind Machine
