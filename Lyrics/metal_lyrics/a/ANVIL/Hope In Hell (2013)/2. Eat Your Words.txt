Opinions are like assholes everybodyâs got one...got one
Consuming crow donât speak before you know
Eat, eat your words
Shoot yourself in the foot when allâs been said and done...said and done
Burning fire go retire
Eat, eat your words. Eat, eat your words
Prove you wrong you must stay strong
Swallow the poison and put you to shame... put you to shame
Devour crow donât speak before you know
Eat, eat your words
When you fail you have yourself to blame...self to blame
Blind choice silent voice
Eat, eat your words. Eat, eat your words
