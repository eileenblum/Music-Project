Time passes on, get it done before it's gone
The bucket list, going after it hand and fist
Fountain of youth, canât stop age, you know it's the truth
Make it now, before it's too late fulfill the vow
Time shows no mercy, itâs not what it seems
Time shows no mercy, just live for your dreams
The hour glass, grains of sand and time will pass
Young at heart, with the spirit that's off the chart
Time shows no mercy, itâs not what it seems
Time shows no mercy, just live for your dreams
Hold onto your youth, you're young as you feel
And that's the truth
Fight the good fight, do it long and do it right
Time shows no mercy
Time shows no mercy, itâs not what it seems
Time shows no mercy, just live for your dreams
Time shows no mercy
Time shows no mercy
