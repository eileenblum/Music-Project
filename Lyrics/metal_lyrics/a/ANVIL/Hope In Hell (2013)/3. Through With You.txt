I trusted your intention, I believed in the things you say
I thought you were my friend and figured you would stay
I gave you what I could but I could never give enough
I felt your empty pain when the going got so tough
See you next Tuesday, what I say to you
See you next Tuesday, Iâm through with you
Iâm through, lâm through, through with you
Iâm through, Iâm through, through with you
Insatiable hunger tor the things that could never be
Living in a dream world and not reality
See you next Tuesday, what I say to you
See you next Tuesday, I'm through with you
I'm through, I'm through, through with you
Iâm through, I'm through, through with you
I gave you my friendship of that you can't deny
Only a faint memory until the day I die
The end is a new beginning, forward you must go
Only time will tell who is friend or who is foe
See you next Tuesday, what I say to you
See you next Tuesday, I'm through with you
I'm through, I'm through, through with you
Iâm through, Iâm through, through with you
