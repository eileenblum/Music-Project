Battles rage everyday, never going to stop
Soon will come the final day when the bomb will drop
Soon will come the judgement day when the bomb will drop
Quest for revenge the aged driving source
Justifying war the taking by force
Creating all out war and the killing course
Vulgar acts of violence more people die in vain
A cause of futility the concept is insane
The loss of humanity who can we blame
Send us all to kingdom come; leave us all nowhere to run,
When the fight is never won...The fight is never won...the fight is never won
On top of the food chain that is where we stay
Predatorily instinctive we live to kill our prey
Mandatorily destructive killing is our way
Send us all to kingdom come; leave us all nowhere to run,
When the fight is never won...The fight is never won...the fight is never won
Will peace become an option that people want to make?
Government involvement always on the take
Government corruption turns it all to fake
All for the gain of money taking whatâs not yours
The very truest evil is the waging of wars
The very truest evil is the waging of wars
Send us all to kingdom come; leave us all nowhere to run,
When the fight is never won...The fight is never won...the fight is never won
