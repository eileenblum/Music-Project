Kick it out, with no doubt, shout it out, that's what it's all about
Take a ride, one with pride, donât wanna hide, in you I confide
Living the moment energy around, feel the excitement, hear the thundering sound
BadAss Rock n Roll, a window to your soul
BadAss Rock n Roll, having fun is our goal
Bang your head, till you're dead, what Metal on Metal said
BadAss Rock n Roll, BadAss Rock n Roll
Living the moment energy around, feel the excitement, hear the thundering sound
BadAss Rock n Roll, a window to your soul
BadAss Rock n Roll, BadAss Rock n Roll
Kick it out, with no doubt, shout it out, that's what it's all about
BadAss Rock n Roll, BadAss Rock n Roll
Because it's true, through and through, dreams come true, itâs what we do
BadAss Rock n Roll, BadAss Rock n Roll
Living the moment energy around, feel the excitement, hear the thundering sound
BadAss Rock n Roll, a window to your soul
BadAss Rock n Roll, having fun is our goal
BadAss Rock n Roll, BadAss Rock n Roll
BadAss Rock n Roll, BadAss Rock n Roll
