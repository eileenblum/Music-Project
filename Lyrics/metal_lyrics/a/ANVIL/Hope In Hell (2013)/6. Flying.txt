Toronto to Chicago down to New Orleans
Cross the Atlantic wind up in Aberdeen
Spain to Australia a daze in the heat
Then hack to Alaska sled dogs race to compete
Taxi the tarmac let's go
Leaving the ground the engine's groan
Into the blue sky we go
Flying, flying around the world
Flying, flying around the world
Brussels to Warsaw then down to Italy
Cross the Mediterranean gone to Galilee
Taxi the tarmac lets go
Leaving the ground the engine's groan
Into the blue sky we go
Flying, flying around the world
Flying, flying around the world
London to Paris then to Taipei
Down through the Philippines all in one day
Tel Aviv to Turkey then down through Greece
Back home to Canada to see our famous geese
Taxi the tarmac let's go
Leaving the ground the engine's groan
Into the blue sky we go
Flying, flying around the world
Flying, flying around the world
