Use your ammunition to keep yourself alive
Onward to the battle the struggle to survive
Never ending fight and will to succeed
Never to surrender and refusal to concede
Call of Duty, theatre of war
Call of Duty, to live for more
Get set for confrontation take cover kill or die
Receive your retribution another chance to live and try
Call of Duty, theatre of war
Call of Duty, to live for more
All is fair in love and war, kill the enemy even the score
Anger and vengeance the fuel for the fire
Living through the battle never to retire
Nobility and honor to the final day
Patriotic endeavor for the cause you must stay
Call of Duty, theatre of war
Call of Duty, to live for more
Call of Duty, theatre of war
Call of Duty, to live for more
