Like walking into darkness not knowing what you'll find
Paying the piper and leave my debts behind
Backwards and forwards it will always be the same
Pay back foreclosure, learn to play the game
Pay the toll; Pay the toll...for Rock n Roll, Pay the toll, Pay the toll
In order to receive, give everything I've got
Grateful for the chance and taking my best shot
Pay the toll; Pay the toll...for Rock n Roll, Pay the toll, Pay the toll...for Rock n Roll
Bring light into the darkness, knowing what youâll find
Planning for the future leave your fear behind
Forwards and backwards it will always be the same
Payment for the glory is how to play the game....how to play the game
Pay the toll; Pay the toll...for Rock n Roll,
Pay the toll, Pay the toll....for Rock n Roll
