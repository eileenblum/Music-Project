[Bonus Track]Light my fuse ready to fire
Flip the switch my heartÂ´s desire
What I know ready to go hard wired

Kick some ass turn on the heat
Rock and roll with a crazy beat
What I know ready to go
Bring it to the top and feel the flow
Hard wired hard wired
A cross circuit load hard wired
 Hard wired set to explode

Doing what I love and what I crave
Do it til they put me in my grave
What I know ready to go hard wired

Light my fuse ready to fire
Flip the switch my heartÂ´s desire
What I know ready to go
Bring it to the top and feel the flow
Hard wired hard wired
A cross circuit load hard wired
Hard wired set to explode
Hard wired hard wired
A cross circuit load hard wired
Hard wired set to explode
