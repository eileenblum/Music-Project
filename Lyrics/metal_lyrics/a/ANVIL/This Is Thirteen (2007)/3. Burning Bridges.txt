When you bite the hand that feeds
Destructive forces out to get you
When you can't fulfill your needs
You can't achieve what you want to

[Chorus:]
Burning bridges, a fire attack
Burning bridges, you can't go back

Unnecessary choice
Victim of your own decisions
Listen to your inner voice
Product of your own condition

[Chorus]

Feeling the pressure bearing down on me
Garbage or treasure, what's it going to be?

Failure or success
Balanced on the dividing line
Sins to confess
Ain't no one's fault but mine

[Chorus x2]

Seeing the future through distorted eyes
Tainted by anger, stress and lies
Feeling the pressure bearing down on me
Garbage or treasure, what's it going to be?

[Chorus]

Controlling your actions
All for good or bad
Disposable transactions
For that, you should be glad

[Chorus x2]
