My blood's a boil and I'm in a rage
On with the onslaught, ripping rampage
Life's ambition, it will never fade
Stainless steel, tempered blade
Clenched fists, ready to go
One for the money, two for the show
When you're ready, you're good to go

When you're ready to fight
When you're ready to fight
When you're ready to fight

All comers, I will beat you all
I go all rounds, never going to fall
Strength to win can over take
Perseverance, make no mistake

When you're ready to fight
When you're ready to fight

Clenched fists, ready to go
One for the money, two for the show
When you're ready, you're good to go

Let's go!

My blood's a boil and I'm in a rage
On with the onslaught, ripping rampage
Strength to win and over take
Perseverance, make no mistake
Make no mistake
Clenched fists, ready to go
One for the money, two for the show
When you're ready, you're good to go

When you're ready to fight
When you're ready to fight
When you're ready
When you're ready to fight
When you're ready
When you're ready to fight
When you're ready to fight
When you're ready to fight
