Dreaming up a nightmare and another sleepless night
Restless sedation with no end in sight
Fists clenched in anger, shivering in fear
Your blood begins to boil, dementia is near

[Chorus:]
Room number nine
Number nine

You're a rat in a maze and you're trying to find your way
You're climbing the wall and trying to get away
Running a race and going nowhere
Electroshock therapy, take all you can bear

[Chorus x2]

Only a dream
It's only a dream
(It's not what it seems)
It's not what it seems
It's only a dream
(Only a dream)

Only a dream
It's only a dream
(It's not what it seems)
It's not what it seems
It's only a dream
(It's only a dream)

[Chorus]

Rubber room walls keep me from the pain
Need a shot of lithium to make it right again
Dream another nightmare, another sleepless night
Subconscious psychosis, wake up or die of fright

Room number nine

[Chorus x3]

Room number nine
