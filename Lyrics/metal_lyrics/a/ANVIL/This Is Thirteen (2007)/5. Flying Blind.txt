When you are lost and you can't find your way
Look for a landmark, as an eagle looks for prey
See the horizon, watch the sun going down
Into the darkness, light fades all around

[Chorus:]
Flying blind
Flying blind

Look at the ground as you fly overhead
Not the same as the flight plan said
Into the darkness, light fades all around
See the horizon, watch the sun going down

[Chorus x2]

When you're flying and you just can't see
Just can't see where you're going to be
When you're flying and you just can't see
The forest from the trees

Travel in circles and going nowhere
Better or worse, you do what you dare
Take a chance and fly into the night
Blind as a bat, searching for the light

[Chorus x2]

Flying blind
When you're flying and you just can't see
Flying blind
Just can't see where you're going to be
Flying blind
When you're flying and you just can't see
Flying blind
