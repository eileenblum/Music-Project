In the lottery of life you need a ticket to win
Gotta know where you come from, gotta know where you've been
Throw the dice, take a chance, got to let it roll
Crap game of life, trying to reach your goal

Should' a would' a could' a
Should' a would' a could' a

Never say you're sorry for things you should have done
The power and the glory, when you've finally won

Hey

[Chorus:]
Should' a would' a could' a
When you want to right a wrong
Should' a would' a could' a
Take a chance before it's gone
Should' a would' a could' a
Fight before you fall
Should' a would' a could' a
When your back's to the wall

You must be brave and fearless, strength to survive
Determined and relentless, a love that never dies
That never dies
That never dies

Life is like a card game, a good hand makes you win
Gotta know your enemies before the war begins
Stock and bond markets, ringing the bell
Is there money in your pocket? Have you something to sell?

[Chorus:]
Should' a would' a could' a
Decisions on the fly
Should' a would' a could' a
A case of do or die

Hey
Should' a would' a could' a
Should' a would' a could' a
Should' a would' a could' a
Should' a would' a could' a
