Count your pennies and don't spend a dime
Ripping yourself off is a crime
It's a crime
The lust for money, an obsession of life
Cheap son of a bitch, it cuts like a knife
Cuts like a knife
Steal a share
Do and dare
Don't steal from me

[Chorus:]
Feed, feed the greed
Feed, feed the greed

Another day, another dollar, another scam
Actions speak louder than the man
Than the man
Take you for a ride
Integrity's died
Don't lie to me

[Chorus]

When you're old you are sure to be alone
King among paupers, sitting on a throne
On a throne
Take your dough
You can go
Straight to hell

[Chorus x2]
