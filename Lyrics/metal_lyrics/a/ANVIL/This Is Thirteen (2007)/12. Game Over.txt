Life can be just like a Game Boy
Filled with frustration and joy
Pressing A or B, make a choice
Now responding to the computer's voice
You've started and there's no turning back
Over and over, you'll soon have the knack
The chances are you will lose
The challenge never seizes to amuse

[Chorus:]
Game over, game over
Game over, game over
Game over, game over
Back to start

One step forward and two steps back
Falling victim to the enemies attack
Evasive manoeuvres, try to score
When it all ends, you'll still want more

[Chorus:]
Game over, game over
Game over, game over
Game over, game over
Learning the art

Honing your skills in hours of play
Taking your time and wasting your day

Patients and practice, all it takes
Beating the game, records to break
Life can be just like a Game Boy
All filled with frustration and joy

[Chorus:]
Game over, game over
Game over, game over
Game over, game over
Learning the art
Game over, game over
Game over, game over
Game over, game over
Game over, game over
Game over, game over
Game over, game over
