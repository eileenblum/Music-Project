Resentment and anger gnaw at your mind
Just like disease that makes you go blind
Vengeance and hatred fill your soul
When getting even is your only goal

All the things that have been said and done
Never forgiven, the fight is won
Battle and conquest that will never end
In the land of business you have no friend

[Chorus:]
Axe to grind, axe to grind
Sparks will fly
Axe to grind, axe to grind

Vengeance that is blind
Plight on mankind
In blood, you have signed
After all you will find

[Chorus]

Burdened with truth, guilt will steal your soul
A fight to the death, the final toll
Red faced anger that will never be resolved
Only a friendship that's been dissolved

Axe to grind, axe to grind

Give me no heartache, bring me no pain
Eradicated like a nasty stain
Take away anger, you'll find hate
Take away hatred to change your fate

[Chorus]

Vengeance that is blind
Plight on mankind
In blood, you have signed
An axe you will grind
