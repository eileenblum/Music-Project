Searching for a place to hide
Running from those you've defied
Forsaking the land of the free
Leaving American policy

Trying to make a change
Hoping to rearrange
Planning a strategy
Going to be a refugee

Status of a free man
U.S. government banned
Anywhere is a place to be
You've just got to be free

[Chorus:]
American refugee
American refugee
American refugee
American refugee

[Verse 1]

Got to be free

[Chorus x2]
