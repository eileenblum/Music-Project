Tarot card and tealeaves
A crystal ball
The gypsy's kiss
The death cards call

Bad luck, misfortune
Superstitious belief
Good luck, a rebirth
And a sigh of relief

This is thirteen
This is thirteen

Cast a spell from the wave of a wand
The depths of hell, there's a voice from beyond

Palm reading, candlelight
Fortunes to tell
Fear the unknown
Under a spell

This is thirteen
This is thirteen

The fortuneteller's incantation
Rats in the cellar, abomination
Edge of your seat in anticipation

Reincarnation
Belief in a myth
Holding a sÃ©ance
Is it the dead you're talking with?

This is thirteen
This is thirteen
This is thirteen
This is thirteen
This is thirteen
This is thirteen
