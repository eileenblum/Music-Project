Big business, it's all around
Big business, let's bring it down
Big business, the FDA
Big business, the placebo way

Big business, Nike shoes
Big business, sweathouse blues
Big business, Tobacco Company
Big business for the mortuary

Nothing's free
Pay for it all
Can't you see?
Nations will fall

[Chorus:]
Big business
Big business
Big business
Big business

War for peace
The Middle East

Big business, the Church always wins
Big business, paying for sins
Big business, oil prices
Big business, war devices

Nothing's free
Pay for it all
Rising fee
Nations will fall

[Chorus x2]
