Three of you are all alone
On the road long way from home
No one here to
Tell you what to do tonight
You look at us and you think you might
Try us on for size

Dressed to kill you're looking hot
Give away everything you've got
Hoping that you
Score a guy whose in a band
To be with you and hold your hand
Love is on your mind

Comin' at you gonna do our best - All night, no rest
Gonna give you every inch of me - just you wait and see

Hard times - fast ladies
In heat, gonna drive us crazy
Hard times - fast ladies
In heat

In our room say that you're a gift
Your friends and you promise us a lift
Time to get it
On the case do us like you should
Do the things you said you would
Don't hold back let's go

Faster faster that's the way
Coming through now, don't delay
We're the kind of guys you've been dreaming of

Comin' at you gonna do our best - All night, no rest
Gonna give you every inch of me - just you wait and see

Now that all is said is done
The night is over and we've had our fun
Time for you to
Go your own way and we will to
One night's loving is enough for you
Memories remain

Comin' at you gonna do our best - All night, no rest
Gonna give you every inch of me - just you wait and see
