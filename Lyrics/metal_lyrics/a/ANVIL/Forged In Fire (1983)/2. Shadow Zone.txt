It happened fast, a final flash, that set the world on fire
And mankind paid a final debt to insatiable desire
Toxins linger, pollute the soil and prohibit germination
Tainted oceans choke out life inflicting termination

Barren land, desolate waste, destruction is complete
Surviving mutants walk the ruins in search of a retreat
Scarlet skies enclose this tomb where all existence lies
Morbid mutilations wail but no one hears their cries

Eternal hell and damnation The forsaken long to die
In the end humanity caused its own demise

Decaying flesh in open graves, disease ridden corpse
Death lurks in all that lives, the Earth becomes a morgue
Scarlet skies enclose this tomb where all existence lies
Morbid mutilations wail but no one hears their cries
In the end humanity caused its own demise

Beware the shadow zone
Death trap, the bomb has blow
Beware the shadow zone
Burn you down to the bone

Infected societies from power hungry nations
Insane world leaders and all their frustrations
If only those responsible could see what they have done
A war without survivors is a fight that's never won
Scarlet skies enclose this tomb where all existence lies
Morbid mutilations wail but no one hears their cries

Eternal hell and damnation The forsaken long to die
In the end humanity caused its own demise

Beware the shadow zone
