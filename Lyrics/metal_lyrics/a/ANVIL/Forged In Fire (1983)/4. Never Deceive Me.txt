Got a strange situation
I think that something's going down
I hear it being whispered
The rumour's out all over town
You see I got a little lady
Who I ain't been treatin' right
It's a crime the way I'm acting
I've been staying out all night

If it's not too late
Try and change my fate
All I need is you to stay with me

Now my drink is almost empty
And I'll soon be on my way
We have to talk about it
It can't wait another day
But I think that things are changing
By the way she looks at me
She keeps it all inside her
And she thinks that I can't see

I was walking in the rain
When I came upon the scene
She was kissing him goodnight
And I knew where she had been
It changed my life completely
And ever since that day
You won't keep me close enough
To hurt me in that way

'Cause when I saw you with that other guy
You know it hurt me so down deep inside
You'll never deceive me again
'Cause when I saw you with that other guy
You know you hurt me so down deep inside
You'll never deceive me again
