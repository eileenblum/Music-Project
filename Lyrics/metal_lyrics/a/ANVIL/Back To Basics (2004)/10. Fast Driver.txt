Just one shot of nitrous, I'll leave you in the dust
Peddles to the metal, feel the engine thrust
The power of a monster raging under the hood
The sheer lust of power makes me feel so good

Fast driver, pass you on the curve
Fast driver, the power and the nerve

Low riding tires grip the road like glue
Hair pin corners, a breeze to get through
Five speed tranny and overhead cam
When the cops see me comin' they learn just who I am

Fast driver, pass you on the curve
Fast driver, the power and the nerve
Fast driver, foot made of lead
Fast driver, wearing down the tread

Car race, on your mark get set go
Keeping the pace fast not slow
Car race, on your mark get set go
No time to waste, let's go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

Burning up the pavement, leave a trail of black
The smell of burnt rubber, I won't be comin' back
Fast as a bullet fired from a gun
Getting home alive is a race I've won

Fast driver, pass you on the curve
Fast driver, the power and the nerve
Fast driver, foot made of lead
Fast driver, wearing down the tread
Fast driver, pass you on the curve
Fast driver, the power and the nerve
