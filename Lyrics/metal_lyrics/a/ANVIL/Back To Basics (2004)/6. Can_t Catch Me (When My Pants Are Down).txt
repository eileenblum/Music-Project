When you are a cheat, you will be beat, self defeat
If you're unaware, you best take care, life's not fair
Take control of your very soul
I hope you know what I mean

Don't get caught in the act behind your lovers back then deny the fact
When your hands in the jar, wish upon a star, you won't get far
Every soul has self control
You should know what I mean

Can't catch me, can't catch me, can't catch me foolin' around
Can't catch me, can't catch me, can't catch me when my pants are down

When you think you're cool
And you've been found a fool
Don't blame me

Take my advice, don't think twice, you will suffice
Consequence, has no defense, you'll have to pay the price
Taking heed of your manly need
You know just what I mean

Can't catch me, can't catch me, can't catch me foolin' around
Can't catch me, can't catch me, can't catch me when my pants are down
