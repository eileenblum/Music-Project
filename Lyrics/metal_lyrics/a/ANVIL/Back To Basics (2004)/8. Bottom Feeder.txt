Well alright!
Living off the money of misery
It's a dog eat dog mentality
The corporate world is a pocket bleeder
Better watch out for the bottom feeder

Bottom feeder, bottom feeder
Bottom feeder, bottom feeder
Bottom feeder

Yeah!
Rob you blind just to make a buck
Kick you hard when you're down on your luck
The whole damn world is a money eater
Watch out for the bottom feeder

Bottom feeder, bottom feeder
Bottom feeder, bottom feeder
Bottom feeder

Hold on to your cash
A stock market crash
You better hide, hide your stash

Yeah!
Squeezing blood from the proverbial stone
Paying it off when your life's on loan
A card game with a cheater
Better watch out for the bottom feeder

Bottom feeder, bottom feeder
Bottom feeder, bottom feeder
Bottom feeder
