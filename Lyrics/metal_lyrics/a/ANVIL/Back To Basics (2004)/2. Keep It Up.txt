Stand at attention, be a masculine man
Keep on going for as long as you can
All it takes is just one little pill
Last all night and get your fill

Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up

Unending pleasure, a woman's delight
Unbending treasure that lasts all night
All it takes is just one little pill
Every night you can get a thrill

Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up

Enhancing performance in a drug induced way
The modern world where the adults play
All it takes is just one little pill
If you haven't got it, you soon will

Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
Keep it up, keep it up
