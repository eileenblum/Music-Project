I was searching for tomorrow
Waiting for the sun to shine
In a cloak of deepest sorrow
Now forever 'til the end of time
A glimmer of hope, a light to follow
I'm just waiting for my time
To break through, make it to
Just where I want to be

Winding roads and false pretences
On deafened ears I make my plea
Signed in blood, I've lost my senses

Won't someone rescue me
Rescue me from a cruel world
Rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me from a cruel world

Confuse you, defuse you
Don't take the pride from me
Abuse you, refuse you

Won't someone rescue me
Rescue me from a cruel world
Rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me from a cruel world

I'm still searching for tomorrow
Waiting for the sun to rise
Living off the time I borrowed
Even after the countless tries
Fulfilled hopes, a light to follow
Unrelented 'til the day I die
Stop the pain, live again
Spare me from this agony

Rescue me
Rescue me from a cruel world
Rescue me, rescue me
Rescue me from a cruel world
