Murdering wilderness teaming with life
Cold blooded killers armed with mechanized knife
Razor sharp blades slicing limb from limb
When the motor is revving, let the cutting begin

Tooth picks from logs or pulp and paper
Raping a harvest, stealing from nature
Ravaging hillsides until nothing remains
Depleting oxygen, an industries pains

The chainsaw

At the core an industry
That makes its money from society
Give the people what they need
Take a forest, plant a seed

Slice and dice, chemically treat
Over and over it will repeat
Oak, maple, birch, and pine
The receding of the forest line

The chain of blades do spin round
Taking trees to the ground
Deadly cost to environment
Watch just where your money's spent

Supply demand is on the rise
Self destruction in disguise
Blades of steel that never stop
The cutting of another crop

The chainsaw
