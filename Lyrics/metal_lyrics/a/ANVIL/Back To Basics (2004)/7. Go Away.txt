Everyone's a critic, opinions are for free
The only one that matters is the one that belongs to me
I used to be gullible, innocent, naive
All the things I've seen and heard I can't believe

Lies, I hear everyday
Lies, I don't know what to say
Go away

Narrow minded, jaded, get too loud a voice
Freedom of the press and the freedom of choice
I used to be a believer in what I'd seen and read
I wish I knew the real truth, not the bullshit been fed

Lies, I hear everyday
Lies, I don't know what to say
Go away

The innocent stay uninformed, go on what they've heard
Take belief in anything, no matter how absurd
Lambs to the slaughter, victims of crime
Lost in a paper jungle 'til the end of time

Lies, I hear everyday
Lies, I don't know what to say
Go away
