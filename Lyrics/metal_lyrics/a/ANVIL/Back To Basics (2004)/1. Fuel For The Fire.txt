Fight
Stand up and fight
Fight for your right
Kill
In for the kill
Do what you will

Attack
Stabbed in the back
The whip starts to crack
Revenge
Oh, sweet revenge
Time to avenge

Fuel for the fire
Fuel for the fire

Boiling blood and fire
Gasoline to a flame
I'm just a live wire
Don't you know it's not a game?
It's not a game

Go
Go for the throat
Stand back and gloat
Hate
Deep rooted hate
When the anger is great

Fuel for the fire
Feed the flame
