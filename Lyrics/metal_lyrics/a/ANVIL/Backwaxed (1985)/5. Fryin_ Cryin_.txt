My friends told me about girls like you
That there's only one thing you like to do
That's gettin laid by the boys up here
Screamin', screamin' babe you feel no fear
But I want you young and clean
You're always comin' from down beneath
You are

I recall that when times are the same
Bringing your heart, you're the one to blame
That's why you're in need for love
You can't get away from us we like your stuff
Ain't no use stopping ????
'Cause when it's over you got to ?????

You're fryin', you're fryin', you're fryin'
???????
You're cryin', you're cryin', you're cryin'
All the way

Cry baby
