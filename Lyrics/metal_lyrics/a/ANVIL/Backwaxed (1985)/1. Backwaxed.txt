Your mommy always said don't take those boys to bed
It might feel good today but in 9 months you'll pay
I know it's your first time I'm gonna make you feel just fine
You say you never did and you're really unprepared

Don't you worry, don't you fret
I've got a method that ain't thought of yet
Put it in and pull it out
Slap it on your back and watch it spout

I don't think you'll mind if I take ya from behind
Get you on your hands and knees, put your mind at ease
Feel the throbbing what a treat as the wax begins to heat
I think it's almost there, gonna pull it out with care

Backwaxed, backwaxed, you're being backwaxed
Backwaxed, backwaxed, you're being backwaxed

Ow, I think things are coming through
??? looks good on you
Now the shine is on your back
Feel the heat of the wax attack
