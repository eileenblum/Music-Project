When I first met you, thought we'd give it a try
I didn't think to see it in your eyes
You said you love me but that's a lie
And now I'm leaving so don't you cry
No tears baby

'Cause you're a liar
And it's true babe
???
You're a liar
I don't need you
Turn my back and you'll just
Hit the door

You said that things would be different with you, ha
I can't believe the things you said were true
I caught you cheating so now we're through
I don't want to be involved with you, No!
Not with you honey

So go away and I'll try it again
I'll find a lady that won't cause me no shame
??? your lyin' games
But with my luck, no doubt you'd be the same
That's 'cause you're all the same baby
A bunch of no good lying bitches
