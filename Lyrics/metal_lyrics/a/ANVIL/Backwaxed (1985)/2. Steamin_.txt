Steamin' for your love tonight
Won't you lay me down
Walkin' over looking hot and sweet
Babe you're hard to beat
It's time to get together with me babe
Won't ya lay me now
Know it's your first time for love
Let me show you how

Steamin' for your love tonight
Steamin' for your love
Steamin' for your love tonight
Steamin' for your love

Just relax and let your body go
Don't fight the feeling, oh no
Reaching heights you've never reached before
Won't you let me blow
Now it's done and you feel released
From your mad desire
Mine is blowin' out tonight
Won't you set the fire
