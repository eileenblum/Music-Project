Fill your mouth with words
And flavors of a life you stole
'Cause 'till now you've only drowned my soul
Destroyed my liver
Disintegrated all that we made
All that we were, all that we felt
All that we made!

Abuse me and try to feel my pain
Growing up the rage inside my brain
Exalt yourself but do it slower like a secret lover


I'd just spoken above like on an old chair
Performing as an absolute throne of nothingness
I am the king of nonsense and you treated me
Like the queen of the beauty, of the void

The other part of me
Feels the loneliness
I am a deluded bad child

Abuse me and try to feel my pain
Growing up the rage my brain
Exalt yourself but do it slower
Like a secret lover
Do it now, do it slowly
my secret lover

Do it slowly my secret lover
