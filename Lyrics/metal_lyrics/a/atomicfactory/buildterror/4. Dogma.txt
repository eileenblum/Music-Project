[feat. Mattia Sogari]Another dream will be broken by human madness
During my ruin of life I see only weaks
Ladies and gentleman dressed up by sadness
Depress me and make me sick!

Blasphemous clouds of a pagan Sky
Darken the dream of a world away,
We breath sick for survive
Not to suffocate under the Weakâs slaps!

Hypocrisy is the bread of this bad apple,
Shit explodes by their heads!
Hybrid creations are too expensive,
Real things too rare for them!

Blasphemous clouds of a pagan Sky
Darken the dream of a world away,
We breath sick for survive
Not to suffocate under the Weakâs slaps!

... IâLL RISE!
another dream will be broken!

Blasphemous clouds of a pagan Sky
Darken the dream of a world away,
We breath sick for survive
Not to suffocate under the Weakâs slaps!

Blasphemous Stupid World.
