[feat. Simone Mantovani]Oh my Bro donât follow this road
In this way my heart will explode
Ripping my skin,
Smashinâ my head
You're the only one not to shreds.

Look at your back
and go straight on
you donât come back to the front!

This is the best
And swallow the rest,
You must never return back
Youâre the guest!

You are my War-Brother!
You are my Fellow-Soldier!

Over there love doesnât exist...
Over there kisses are like fists...

You are my War-Brother!
My Fellow-Soldier!

Pray your God if you believe-in
And kiss your Cross
If you can reach it
You are my Fellow-Soldier!

You are my War-Brother!
You are my Fellow-Soldier!

Look at your back
and go straight on
you donât come back to the front!

This is the best
And swallow the rest,
You must never return back
Youâre the guest!

You are my War-Brother!
You are my Fellow-Soldier!

Look at your back
and go straight on
you donât come back to the front!
