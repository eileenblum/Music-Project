Hey weak
Am I a freak
You're going to feel my fist
I unleashed the beast at least
Cold as ice I wait the time
And my eyes rise their size

Yesterday when we're playing
And then we said: FUCK OFF
This is the same

I trusted in you
You betrayed me
I wanna see your face bleed
I wanna see your face bleed
The enemy is into me

FIGHT
This is my time
FIGHT
This is the killing time
FIGHT
This is my time

Usually I used to be a simple paci-fist
FIST! FIST!
Blinded by things
That maybe do not exist

The fury of the good is always the scariest
And the heart of the brave explodes in the silence
The heart of the brave explodes

The enemy
The enemy is into me
I am afraid
I am afraid of my own hate
The enemy is into me
The enemy is into me

FIGHT
This is my killing time
KILL! KILL!
This is the time
This is my killing time

HEY! HEY! HEY! KILL!
