[feat. Simone Mantovani]Remember that time
When you're shaking your fist?
It was more or less similar to this
When the mind doesn't think any more
How to realize that you love a whore
With a fist in the face
His pride will stop
And the teeth in his mouth are ready to drop

Covered with blood his head will appear
The dynamic of murder in the mind is clear

If you'll be lucky no one will see
And in this case
Justice will be everything done
In the name of rage!
You will find yourself
Locked in a cage
And the anger that comes in
And blinds the eyes!

But imagine the law
And the price to pay
From that bad beat, you will not arise
Don't leave your freedom
Run away!

Your neurons now are disconnected
Yeah, your soul is infected
From your disgusting thirst for revenge
Please, stop me in time now my friend
