Heavens led their fire upon once lifeless fields
Thence bred a kin whose delight was a frost on this earth

And almighty knows we wished
To see the subtle evil that profaned them to believe
That tore them to be and cursed thee

To serve from cradle to grave
Wandering
Where the sun won't reach
Still I know

Under the waterline all life burned cold
Under the waterline all life burned cold

And this venomous chant I leave as gift to thou:
"Dreadnought be the blade and bringer of defeat
Nobly one time dead you live again by me
For you I'd walk the paths down underneath
And every night I'd feel you taking part of me
Fraught with hate I grab the gauntlet that I deem
Just to see, time did not yet come for me to leave"

It was hell on earth for evermore and death brought no relief
Greater visions came true
And vultures were fed again by thoughts indecent
And promised salvations
Fertile lands became deserts by faith with grin converted
Children of bereavement, ye mocked by heavens
Banished with one thought in time

It's sacrifice that has to be made
With smile I seek believers

And trust me, I will bleed
This is war
