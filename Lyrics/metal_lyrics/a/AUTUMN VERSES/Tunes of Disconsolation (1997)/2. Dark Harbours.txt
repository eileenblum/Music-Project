One voice through the failure of night
The trombones of the emperor of lies
All hope is gone and one withers
In the last rays of the dying sun

And the will never leave you alone
There are deeds to be filled by evil hands
False light breeds deep in their time
While crimson roses are burning by side

And dark harbours of their gentle shores
Will always hold room for one more
By the time you too shall know
That the journey back is too long

The journey back is too long
