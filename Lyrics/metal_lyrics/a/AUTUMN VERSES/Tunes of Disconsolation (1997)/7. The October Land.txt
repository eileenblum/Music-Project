Frail deceased walked this path
Gazing meanness and lores of those with power
As dismal and intense they reigned
Tainted but by the ignorance of
Hallowed, to whom gods spoke once
Cursed as feeble and soon to be gone
With laughter they decried the words
And received their deliverance in death

Hark! Sodom were they seen
Before I grasped the celestial
Blade and followed the steps
Leading through heaths conquered by grief
I left all that odious
Rejected honours, and adored values
Blood, heaven's breath and pain
Infested world with wisdom I did find

Step through gates, covered emerald blades
Piercing epochs and ones forever damned
October land

Under scarlet of moon, see if they would dance
Waking trees of the tortured
October land

Led by another son, denying father
Baptized with serpent in hand
October land

Souls of seven, perform an anthem
To those of night, with urge for destruction
October land
