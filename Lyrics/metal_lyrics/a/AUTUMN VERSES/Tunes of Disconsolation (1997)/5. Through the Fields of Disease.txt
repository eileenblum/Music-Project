Old one bless this hammer before end
I don't want to leave my lair when
You grant me visions of pestilence and fear
Herewith I'll own the hearten grief
Approve blood of these veins cut by knife
You were here in time before time
Her embrace no longer brings peace to me
Dagger by heart I roam the innovate way

In a hush like a hush from a chamber of death
Wailing hovered upon the neap tide
Her eyes were distant and pale by
Still I remember us hunting all life
Now I did redeem and I'm tired
Tragedy followed the nocturnal hunt
I bled in altar forbidden and numb

Weary old one did you hear what I said?
Devil lurked in me during hours of death
I never left you like others did me
Still I can't stand that preacher's disgusting reek
