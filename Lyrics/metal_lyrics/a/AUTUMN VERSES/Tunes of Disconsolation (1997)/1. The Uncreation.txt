Call me dreary
Name me after the thresholds I cross
For I know of truth
And believe in arts that were

Once sublime, now unclean and but hours to be denied
Yet not unknown in the paths I named right
Free at last, am I not to look all as divine
From stronghold of insane knowledge and strife

And as fools leave pride while accepting grace
My disciples shall walk the ways of dismay
Through caves without end on final crusade
Spreading poems of uncreation before being laid in fervour

They'll poison your mind with tolerance

Don't follow the laws made for flesh
Keep your eyes shut to see the distress
On the ones who call themselves free of sin and earthly fate
Show no compassion, ignore their agonies

And question not my words of disbelief
You never felt such passion towards vicious desires
Alone I hate this sea of aspirers to the throne
And pray for uncreation, the fiery end of world
