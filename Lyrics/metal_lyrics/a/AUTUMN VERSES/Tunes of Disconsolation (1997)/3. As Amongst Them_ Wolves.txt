It's a triumph of the silent
When the ones of war fail by the sword
When earth takes earth of a mortal note
And all of death come for their own

Those who lurk in the shadows
Watching, obtain the greatest reward
And as amongst them wolves
Lay the serpents, of this world

Even beasts seek shelter
When tamers of waves lay helpless
When vanguards start their endless slaughter
And none sees the same dawn after

Those who lurk in the shadows
Watching, obtain the greatest reward
And as amongst them wolves
Lay the serpents, of this world

...Too dead to know its spring of loss

It's a triumph of sinner
When the seasons flee and myths fall
When inferiors long to rule
And towers once high are lowered down

Those who lurk in the shadows
Watching, obtain the greatest reward
And as amongst them wolves
Lay the serpents, of this world
