From the maelstrom of darkness...
Arise the avatar of satanic might
Cloaked in shadow of devil's fire,
veiled in blackened winds
Ascent from the bottomless pits,
marked by the Devil
Disciple of torment,
darkness and damnation,
wielder of demonic flame

Above the graves of impaled angels,
howling to rising black moon
Wraith of eternal anguish,
of immortal infernal wrath
Lifeless empyrean creations,
fallen from divine realms
Behold the celestial funeral,
in exaltation of satanic blood

Crucifixion of angels with burning blades,
rapture of heaven's distress
Worms of Jehova, swines of Allah,
all will fall in our fathers name
We are the heirs of this world,
the world of wolves, not sheep
The wailing winds silence the cries of angelic voices forever
