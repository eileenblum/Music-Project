I wander... through silent freezing night
Celestial burial ground of endless frozen angels
The gardens of crystal darkness hidden in snow-veiled heights
In lightless eternal dominion of azure plains so cold

I wander... among long dead divine souls
Within the astral realms
The silent gardens of the reaper
