From the unfathomable darkness spawn of black flame ascends
Faceless demon, unbound evil
The Devil's champion

Lucifer awakens
His gates are open
Come forth, the faithful
Drink from his veins

Their hearts torn open
Our prayers are spoken
Snow-white corpses hanging from stakes

Yours is the kingdom, the power, the glory
Your essence flows through us on this night of triumph
Satan spawn - Seraph impaler
The left hand of darkness
One with our lord

High rise the flames in their temples
Burnt feathers lay on this blackening earth
Claws of Asmodai tear into their flesh and we hail his name at this dawn of new age

Soul of Christ, your are unholy
Body of Christ, your are no salvation
Blood of Christ, I spit in your wine
Ave Sathanas - I embrace thy horns
