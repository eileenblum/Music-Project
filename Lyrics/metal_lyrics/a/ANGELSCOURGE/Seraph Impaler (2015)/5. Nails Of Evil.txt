Another luciferian triumph dawns on road to Golgotha
King of blind sheep carrying his sign,
the price for praying to wrong god
Your only son as an animal sacrifice,
to feed your own vanity
Payment for sins non-existant,
worthless death in your name

Nails of evil sink deep in heavenly flesh
As sanguine tears flow from beneath his crown
Nails of evil sink deep in heavenly flesh
As the betrayed shepherd rots away on his cross

Crucified false messiah finally breathes his last epitaph of worthless lies,
hammered on his corpse
With empty thrones on his side,
El Shaddai smiles
It's too late for his dying son to finally see the truth
