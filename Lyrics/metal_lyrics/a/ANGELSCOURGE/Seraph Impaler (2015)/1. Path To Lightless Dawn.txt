Black streams of angelblood I see in my dreams
I stand before the black gates,
earth trembles as they open
Drowned in darkness I am,
horned shadows before me
"Take my hand and ascend to divinity,
leave the world of flesh"

Beyond the sight of mortal eyes
Sea of endless mists
Visions beyond gods
Above the stars of god I see
Thy sigils I wear in your name forever

Accept my offering, enter in my soul
I relinquish my life in the name of the horned lord
In Baphomet's shadows I found the dark salvation
My path is now sealed,
forever I pray to thy eternal glory

We pray to horned, our lord
The immortal king of our world
Sworn to lightbearer, our true god
Embrace him and thy eternal life

Hail Satan - The serpent of old,
guide me through the cleansing fire
Hail Satan - Son of perdition, under the red moon your reign is eternal
