[Verse 1]
And I find myself climbing
From the window to the garden
When electric night falls
I hear calls

[Verse 2]
And I feel the connection
Way above the nomadic stars
Walking through the fields

[Chorus]
The connection to the earth
Feels electric this time
She's unbroken in my veins
The harbinger of the dawn

[Repeat verses 1 &amp; 2 and chorus]
