[Verse 1]
They visit me in purple sunlight
The strangest glow falls on the earth
They speak to me within the hedgerow
Their native tongue speaks of the birth
The night brings a beautiful calm
The plants and the trees all drunk on the sun
I worship at our mother's altar
Tomorrow's dawn will soon begin

[Chorus]
The longest day and the shortest night
The moon sings of it's own twilight
The ancient stones frame the golden sun
Midsummer winds blow for everyone

[Verse 2]
In my dreams they come to me
And thank me for my sacrifice
I gave my body, gave my soul
To hear them singing nature's song

[Chorus 2x]
The longest day and the shortest night
The moon sings of it's own twilight
The ancient stones frame the golden sun
Midsummer winds blow for everyone
