[Verse 1]
On the mountain growing free
The ancient leaf it waits for me
Acknowledging and shining light
I made my way into the night

[Chorus]
Oh I let my mind flow to the sea
Oh taste the White Hoarhound
As I die under the tree
Oh taste the White Hoarhound

[Verse 2]
Summer sun and bright new day
I worship from your cup in may
Don't need riches, don't need wealth
All I want is for your health

[Chorus]
Oh I let my mind flow to the sea
Oh taste the White Hoarhound
As I die under the tree
Oh taste the White Hoarhound

[Repeat verse 1 and choruses]
