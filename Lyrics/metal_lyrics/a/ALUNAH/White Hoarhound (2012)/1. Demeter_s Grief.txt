[Verse 1]
Lady of the harvest
Provider of the earth
Blood running through her veins
Like rivers through the land

[Verse 2]
She has a golden daughter
Who sails under the dirt
Taken from this world
By the son of Kronos yeah

[Chorus]
The Grief of Demeter yeah
The moon will swallow her
And when her daughter is free
The crop will let them be

[Verse 3]
The lady had a saviour
A man who shone white gold
Called upon his blood
To release his evil hold

[Verse 4]
A curse had bound her daughter
She ate his blackened seeds
And now she must return
To the place under parched earth

[Chorus]
The Grief of Demeter yeah
The moon will swallow her
And when her daughter is free
The crop will let them be

[Repeat chorus]
