[Verse 1]
Take me to the stream
Belial waits for me
Watch her cover me
Take me down, down, down

[Verse 2]
Sinking to the ground
The water tastes so good
Listen to the sound
Let me drown, drown, drown

Middle Section
Belial's Fjord
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Belial's Fjord

Take me to the stream
Where Belial she waits for me
And you watch her cover me
Please take me down

Sinking to the ground
Where the water tastes so good
And you listen to the sound
Please let me drown

Take me to the stream
Where Belial she waits for me
And you watch her cover me
Please take me down

Sinking to the ground
Where the water tastes so good
And you listen to the sound
Please let me drown

Oh Belial's Fjord [repeat]
