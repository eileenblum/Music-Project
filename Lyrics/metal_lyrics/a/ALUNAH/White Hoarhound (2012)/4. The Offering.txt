Oooh yeahh oooh
Oooh yeahh oooh

[Verse 1]
I wear my robes of golden black
I draw a star across her back
I dip my hand in her blood
And draw a line across the mud

[Verse 2]
I sing a song to Mother Earth
And thank her for Nature's birth
She takes my soul and buries it
And all her creatures feed from me

[Chorus 4x]
I offer myself to the Earth
My sacrifice will bring new birth
Their beauty makes my power strong
They feed from me
