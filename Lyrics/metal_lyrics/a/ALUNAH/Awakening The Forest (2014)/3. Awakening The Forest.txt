I call and I listen to the resonance of his soul
It clouds my clear vision of the waning moon of Gaia

Dawn fades and I follow
The winding of heathen horns
Should I fill with sorrow?
As the forest wakes from it's sleep

Awakening the forest before my time here comes to an end
For I want to see this beauty before my mind's eye does transcend

He stands in the clearing
His fur still sodden with dew
My time's dispappearing
Soon I'll meet with those I have loved
