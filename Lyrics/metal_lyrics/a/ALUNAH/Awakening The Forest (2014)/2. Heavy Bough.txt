They have come from the Earth where the dead do rest
Rising from the undergrowth, watching over your sweet eternal sleep

Thousands of years have passed by, reaching for the sky
The silence of a cycle, keeping secrets from a forgotten time

Sitting on a mossy stone
Carving hearts into the bone in the shadow of the elders
The heavy bough will see you though
The beauty of the old world Yew
It will protect you

They'll be your killer, and be your lifeline too
Destroyer and protector, the solemn giant will stand alone in time

Their twisted grandeur will open the divide, and guide your resurrection
Communicating with hallowed ancestors
