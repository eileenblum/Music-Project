There was a lady of Bricket Wood Coven
She held a secret, clandestine with devotion
There was a lady, the High Priestess they call her
The Book of Shadows rewritten with conviction

There was a lady of Bricket Wood Coven
Her beauty runs deep in the stories she has woven
There was a lady, the High Priestess they call her
She found her own way in the Land of Hope and Glory

Invoke the spirit of the Goddess
Speak through me, let's call the moon together
The web of stars that holds the night together
Illuminate the balance of the wheel

There was a lady of Bricket Wood Coven
Lived long and steadfast on the path that she had chosen
There was a lady, the High Priestess they call her
She's left the world now, but her legacy still lives on
