Floating sideways, through the hazy morning
Evoking shadows, volcanic earth sinks in the lake
Curses hanging, I can feel their presence
In the other world now, warlocks crawl the barren land

The water's deep I can feel it now
Yeah I smell the air around
And the bird's fall from the sky
The entrance starts to open now
Yeah it starts to pull me in
I hear the dim call of ancient Avernus
