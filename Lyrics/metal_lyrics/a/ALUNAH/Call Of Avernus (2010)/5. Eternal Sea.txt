The magical eye comes out of the water
It tells of the tales untold
From the past, present, future
The world is growing old

Float on by in the wind now, the water should be still
Float on by in the wind now, a journey on the eternal sea
Daylight comes to an end now, sunshine drowns in dreams
Daylight comes to an end now, a journey on the eternal sea

Floating on a dirt powered baby
We're going where the sun meets the earth
Destination unknown now
I'm right where I wanna be

Float on by in the wind now, the water should be still
Float on by in the wind now, a journey on the eternal sea
Daylight comes to an end now, sunshine drowns in dreams
Daylight comes to an end now, a journey on the eternal sea
