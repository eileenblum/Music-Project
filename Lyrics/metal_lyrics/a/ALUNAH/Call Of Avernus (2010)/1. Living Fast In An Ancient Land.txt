I begin to wonder, and I begin to feel when the light comes
But I can never be free. Cos I belong to angels of another world

Why can't you see it when l pray
The sun always shines for another day
The pavement's burning I'm on my knees
Sunshine driving through the earth
The time is now for our great birth
We're living fast in an ancient land

And I can't sit here waiting, and I will tell the world of our truths
But I won't wait forever, cos I just wanna be free of their souls

Why can't you see it when l pray
The sun always shines for another day
The pavement's burning I'm on my knees
Sunshine driving through the earth
The time is now for our great birth
We're living fast in an ancient land

I travel through planets, and I fly over mountains
And I descend to the ocean, cos I am finally free of their souls

Why can't you see it when l pray
The sun always shines for another day
The pavement's burning I'm on my knees
Sunshine driving through the earth
The time is now for our great birth
We're living fast in an ancient land
