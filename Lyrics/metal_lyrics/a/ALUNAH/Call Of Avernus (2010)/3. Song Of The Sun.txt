Maybe it's all too easy now, to use the past to show me how
The wheels are turning round and round
Clutching the shadow of the sun
The fog is drowning in the lake, under my loss under cool fire
The winter's driving on my heart
The sunlight falls on the path ahead

Sing the song of the sun, and let the dusk move everyone
Let the moonrays dance upon the slow river
Yeah it's the song of the sun, that's heard when the day is done
She lets the nighttime glow, over ancient earth

Now the desert's fading fast, far from nowhere will we last
Silence quickly pulls me in, dreaming about the cool sundown
Magical lands will soon be ours, drifting upon the peaceful sea
Maybe we'll see another day, so why do my blue skies turn to gray?

Sing the song of the sun, and let the dusk move everyone
Let the moonrays dance upon the slow river
Yeah it's the song of the sun, that's heard when the day is done
She lets the nighttime glow, over ancient earth

Sunshine tears at my foundations, with the purple rays of day
Or am I lost in tales of mountains, drifting far away from here
Will I reach my destination, Mother Nature holds the key
Singing songs of ancient planets, as the sunlight closes in

Sing the song of the sun, and let the dusk move everyone
Let the moonrays dance upon the slow river
Yeah it's the song of the sun, that's heard when the day is done
She lets the nighttime glow, over ancient earth
