She writhed back from him, and approached even more beautiful
Battling for her life, and no longer for his blood
The odour of man filled her, one step nearer and she sprang
With an obscene word, pressed her lips to his, yeah

He caught her at arms length, and filled her with her own evil
A blue light round her head, flaxen hair turned white
Her fair skin wrinkled yeah, her eyes dulled with pewter and wine
A mystic hag with a curse she fled the room, yeah

Hermetic order of the golden dawn
