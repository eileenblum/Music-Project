I never believed, and I never assumed
That the god of the vine now, made the god of the earth

Oh how you dance in the morning, oh Dionysus is here
Oh how you dance in the evening, sacrificial moments I fear

She carries the light, to the edge of the room
He covers the earth now, with Mother Nature's tune

Oh how you dance in the morning, oh Dionysus is here
Oh how you dance in the evening, sacrificial moments I fear
