You're not the only one, underneath the sun
Afraid of what you have
And you're never going to see, what's really there, yeah
Never getting old, our paths they twist and fold
Your lowest point is higher than you think

And you, keep tumbling forward
Keep tumbling forward, in this world we're in
And you, you take me higher, you take me higher than I've ever been
