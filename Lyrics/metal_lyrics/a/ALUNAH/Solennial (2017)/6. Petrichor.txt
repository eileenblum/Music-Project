My parched brown bed begins to soften,
under the driving summer rain.
The forest is being awakened, along with all my senses.
As I prepare, to take my final, breath.
Death waits patiently.
Wild berries will very soon, begin new life amongst my bones.
My bonesâ¦

Lay me down, on cracked dirt, nothing gold can stay.
Let them feast, upon my flesh, as the warm rain falls, as the warm rainâ¦ falls.

Returning to the earth, Iâm manifested in the lightâ¦
