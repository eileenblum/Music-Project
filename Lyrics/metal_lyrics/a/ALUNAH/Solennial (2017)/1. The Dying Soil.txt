I heard a whisper on the wind last night.
Crying through the gilded leaves and soil.
It brought the news of Autumn's death.
And Winter came with its last breath.

The Autumn fire died as the rain fell down.
Soon snow will lay across the land.
We honour them on spirit night.
And sing our songs until first light.
