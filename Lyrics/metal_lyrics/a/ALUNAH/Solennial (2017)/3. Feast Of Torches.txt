Beneath you feel the earth begin to fall.
The heartbeat of the stirring mother.
Our winters' debt, is paid.
To darkness, as she drove it down.

Breathe in the break of day, a time of new beginnings.
As the dew drapes silently, healing her once again.
As the dew drapes silently.
Today we celebrate, the changing of the Goddess.
Tomorrow we return to the reckoning of time.
Tomorrow we return to the reckoning of time.

Light a torch and see inside, as the light is lengthening.
See the beauty in life and death, light a torch, light a torch.
Light a torch and see inside, as the cold is strengthening.
Let there be joy in life and death, light a torch, light a torch.

Harness the energy, created by her presence.
As the sun renews the hills, bringing life once again.
As the sun renews the hills.
Today we celebrate, the great feast of torches.
Tomorrow we return to the reckoning of time.
Tomorrow we return to the reckoning of time.
