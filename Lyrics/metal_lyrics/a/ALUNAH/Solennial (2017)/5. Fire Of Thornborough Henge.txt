You're the change that has come over me.
And I want to honour our life, together.
The fires of Bel will burn strong tonight.
We will learn each otherâs secrets.

Raise the energy and send it crashing back down.
Burn away winter, with ash on our skin.
Do it all for the bright shining one.
Hot flesh as the flames grow higher.

Meet me under the first sun of May,
Tonight weâll awaken the forest, in heather.
Invisible eyes watch us gather our clothes.
And extinguish the dying fire.
