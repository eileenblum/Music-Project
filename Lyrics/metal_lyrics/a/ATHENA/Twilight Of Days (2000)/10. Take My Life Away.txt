Now I know why I am alone
Answers grow, in this room I will know my past.

Two different minds inside my brain
I fear my ashes once again
Watching in silence all alone
I sold lies, and I have burnt my life.

Live to kill, kill to live
Is it life or a crazy dream?
I feel the blade dismember bodies
I must take a decision for my life.

Now is the time to take my flight.
I'll close my eyes and leave my life.

You can't die!
Your life is my life!
I'm inside you
You must trust your own wicked side!

Two shadows fight inside my brain
I fear you ashes once again
I scream my silence all alone
I sold lies but I won't burn my life.

Now is the time to take my flight.
I'll close my eyes and leave my life.
There's no time
I've to find my way.
Live this life, tell me why?
Wanna die again!

Live to kill, kill to live
Is it life or a crazy dream?
I feel the blade dismembering my skin,
I feel the death coming inside my brain.

Now is the time to take my flight.
I'll close my eyes and leave my life.
Lord nail my hands and burn my soul!
Please blear my mind and take my life
AWAY!
