Run and fight to kill the enemy
Up your blades and trust your king!
Rage and anger, war and hate,
victims of evil.
Hidden there is lying our destiny so
Show no mercy and taste their blood!
Storming violence fills your brains
We are the last hope.

Lord of the evil I know you'll be mine.
I'll get your heart, I swear on my pride!
King of the evil I just want to say that
This lifeless place gonna be your deep grave.

I forbode some dreadful tragedy
I'm sure that we're fallen into a trap
I can't leave my warriors dying,
I flame with anger.
I must devastate the enemy
To let off the pain of my soul,
I can't trample on the lich,

DEATH TO THE EVIL!
Lord of the evil I know you'll be mine.
I'll get your heart, I swear on my pride!
King of the evil I just want to say that
This lifeless place gonna be your deep grave.
