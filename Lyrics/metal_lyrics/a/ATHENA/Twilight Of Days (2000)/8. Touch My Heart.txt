Life is a whisper we don't have the time to find
The meaning of wisdom,
the sense of try.
We don't remember the evil we have done
We'll fight forever against our hearts.

I can feel the dark side in my mind
I must accept my destiny.

So touch my heart and give me my death
'cos I don't want to live forever
and I've no past to look for a hide in.
Take my soul away!

I am a nightmare, a shadow in the night
I am the thunder, I am the light.
I feel the pain dismembering my mind.
I feel my glory, I feel my pride.

I can feel the dark side in my mind
I must accept my destiny.

So touch my heart and give me my death
'cos I don't want to live forever
and I've no past to look for a hide in.
Take my soul away!
