A new day in this land,
a new way to find an old to forget.
The sound of a silent cry
Tears that I've left behind.
They come to destroy,
they scream their anger, their pleasure of pain,
but now they must pay for it,
we've to destroy them all!

Their screams fill my head
And I feel I've lost my selfcontrol
'cos I'm living on the edge,
falling down into the end.

Ash leads sands of fear
(iudicabit in nationibus implebit ruinas)
Blood, pain in my heart
(conquassabit capita in terra multorum)

Your fear will be my life
And I promise I'll give you my pain,
your tears'll be the paradise
for all those who can't live a new day.

Winds blows on my face
I look for the hope I never forget,
we must find our way
to win at the cost of death!
They won't be my hell
I know who I am I know what I get,
Your death is my destiny
I've lost my selfcontrol!

Ash leads sands of fear
(iudicabit in nationibus implebit ruinas)
Blood, pain in my heart
(conquassabit capita in terra multorum)

Your fear will be my life
And I promise I'll give you my pain,
your tears'll be the paradise
for all those who can't live a new day.
