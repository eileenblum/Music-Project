Memories of ancient kings let us understand,
It's time to commemorate, time to claps our hands.
Remember the pride we had, glories of our past,
Don't forget we must defend the honour of this land!

We've no more time to complain, let's unite and fight
No mercy for enemies, we must kill and die!
'Cos one is the rule in war: to fight for your life
There are no more days to come, no more left behind.

Here's my life, you can take it I'll give you my heart.
I'm your lord, you must obey your king!

It's the twilight of days, it's the shadows of a shade
I've the thunder, the storm, I've the steel in my veins!
I've no more tears to cry, I don't care if I die
I can move your illusions to real life.

Once again a war to fight, still I feel my scare?
How can I forget the pain, is it still too far?
Will my life belong to God or I'll burn in fire?
Someone's wrote my destiny laughing at my cries,
if I sacrifice my life I can save yours.

Here's my life, you can take it I'll give you my heart.
I'm your lord, you must obey your king!

It's the twilight of days, it's the shadows of a shade
I've the thunder, the storm, I've the steel in my veins!
I've no more tears to cry, I don't care if I die
I can move your illusions to real life.
