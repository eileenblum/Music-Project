The meaning of destiny's lost far in time,
You can't retire leaving the past behind,
Your mind is clear for all those who can see:
What you've done inside is no longer a secret for me!

And if you try to look forward you'll see
That I will be there and you will belong to me,
So don't try to hide all your dreams far from me,
I will be always the last thing you'll see in your mind.

Live your life until you are free,
You can't build your destiny!
No matterhow, no matter why,
Too many stairs to climb!

I can see the light
'cos the world's an eye
I don't want to be blind
I can live my life.
In the name of love,
In the name of soul
I must be strong, I can feel free!!

No more illusions, no more penitences,
We're falling ghosts, we don't believe we were
Made to be killed in their violence and hate
Until we see someone else has decided our lives
Day aftert day we discover is too late
To understand what would be better for us,
For the kingdom, for what we've to make,
So I pray to God not to make it again and again!

I can see the light
'cos the world's an eye
I don't want to be blind
I can live my life.
In the name of love,
In the name of soul
I must be strong, I can feel free!!
