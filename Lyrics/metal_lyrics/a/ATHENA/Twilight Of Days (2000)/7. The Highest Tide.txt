Open your eyes so I can see you die!
Your last whisper, tell me your last desire!

Don't pray for your life
Look in my eyes my spite!
I am the night
I've discovered your hide
You can run far from me but I know you'll be mine
I'll drink your tears
And I'll eat all your fears
So look into my eyes
I just swear you will die!

Oooh! And the hunt's my desire.
Oooh! Through the sands of the time.
Oooh! For my land, for my pride
I've no more fear in my heart
I'll bring the highest tide.

Bleeding twilight I can see holy lights.
Moon lights black skies, from my grave I'll arise!

Don't pray for your life
Look in my eyes my spite!
I am the night
I've discovered your hide
You can run far from me but I know you'll be mine
I'll drink your tears
And I'll eat all your fears
So look into my eyes
I just swear you will die!

Oooh! And the hunt's my desire.
Oooh! Through the sands of the time.
Oooh! For my land, for my pride
I've no more fear in my heart
I'll bring the highest tide.

Lord of the night I will give you my heart.
Lands lost in time I will conquer for you.
Lord of the night let me see into your eyes.
Send me a sign and more power to fight.

I am the night
I've discovered your hide
You can run far from me but I know you'll be mine
I'll drink your tears
And I'll eat all your fears
So look into my eyes
I just swear you will die!

Oooh! And the hunt's my desire.
Oooh! Through the sands of the time.
Oooh! For my land, for my pride
I've no more fear in my heart
I'll bring the highest tide.
