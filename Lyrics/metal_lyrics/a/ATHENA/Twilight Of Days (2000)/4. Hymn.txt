Razor's edge deep is your sight
Woman in black tell me why?
People's life is a real slight,
Full of displeasure and fights.
Wich of the water with long braids
Protectress of human's existence
Give me the power in this empty place
With no fantasy or life.

Go, please take me away
And forget my real name!
Go, now! Give me your blood

Get on high above!
Go, please take me away
And forget my real name!
Go, now! Give me your blood
Get on high above!

Running in the moonlight,
Dancing into the rain
Riding my black horse between the flames of my hell...
The blade of justice is broken
Your destiny's in my hands
Open your eyes and remember my pride,
please your lord!
Living in a black dream,
singing into the pain,
falling into darkness between the lies of my hell...
The blade of justice is broken
Your destiny's in my hands
Open your eyes and remember my pride,
please your lord!

Walk on the edge, hold on tight
Woman in dark, ruling the night
Hold back all of your stones
You cut me like a knife.
Never again as long as I live
In this life no more to give,
fearless evil feels like a lie,
leave me alone or I'll die!

Go, please take me away
And forget my real name!
Go, now! Give me your blood
Get on high above!
Go, please take me away
And forget my real name!
Go, now! Give me your blood
Get on high above!

Running in the moonlight,
Dancing into the rain
Riding my black horse between the flames of my hell...
The blade of justice is broken
Your destiny's in my hands
Open your eyes and remember my pride,
please your lord!
Living in a black dream,
singing into the pain,
falling into darkness between the lies of my hell...
The blade of justice is broken
Your destiny's in my hands
Open your eyes and remember my pride,
please your lord!
