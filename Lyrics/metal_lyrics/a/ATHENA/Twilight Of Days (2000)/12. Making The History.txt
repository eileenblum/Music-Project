[Bonus Track]

I feel so empty I feel it inside,
I feel unclean 'cos my heart is broken.
I feel the power I'm ready to fight
You will burn in the flames of hell!

I've lost my life in that black dirty night,
angels of mine! They will cry forever
I was born to fight, to kill heaven's lord,
I'm the king of death!

War between the good and the evil
I have in my hands.
Will the good and evil be so different in my head?

Knights of this world unite
To defend the hope!
We fight against the time,
they must pay for all!
We'll make the history,
God will be with us!
Keep our souls unite!
Hallowed be thy name.

I can remember my land's burnt in fire
I'll see their faces in my dreams forever.
I've no time to spend 'cos I've no time to live,
no more fear to feel!

I am the nightmare you dream every night
I am the one you have to fight.
Forget the light 'cos the night has come,
don't you pray you God?

War between the good and the evil
I have in my hands.
Will the good and evil be so different in my head?

Knights of this world unite
To defend the hope!
We fight against the time,
they must pay for all!
We'll make the history,
God will be with us!
Keep our souls unite!
Hallowed be thy name.
