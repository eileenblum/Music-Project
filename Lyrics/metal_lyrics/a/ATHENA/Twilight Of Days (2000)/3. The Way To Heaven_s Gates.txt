I don't know the matter of my death.
In front of me the gates of hell.
It's not the end of a secret life.
It's not a dream inside my mind,
it's my destiny!

I don't remember the time
I forget I've a real name
I've lost my senses
I've fallen away.
This is not my promised land
I must be killed by someone's hands
I must find my body, I must find my grave.

I better move if my hope is to live again,
I'll sacrifice all my life to revenge.
Day after day I will kill for your glory!
Lord of the night give me my life again.

Give me your black horse to ride
To the land of the mortal time,
I'll be their lord for the eternity!
You'll be my heartblood, my king,
if it will be my destiny
I won't retire, they'll forever belong to me!

Over the seas, under the horizons
I must find the way to the heaven's gates

Oooooh! By your side I will live forever
Oooooh! By your power I'll take my revenge!
Oooooh! Through the Heaven's gates,
to the other side of death.

Will the black sun rise again?
Will the moon be the light for man
In this desert lands of existence denied?
Dark is the colour of my dreams
When you lie down in agony,
the final battle is too far from me!

I better move if my hope is to live again,
I'll sacrifice all my life to revenge.
Day after day I will kill for your glory!
Lord of the night give me my life again.

Over the seas, under the horizons
I must find the way to the heaven's gates.
How will my heart give me the power
To find the way to the heaven's gates?

Oooooh! By your side I will live forever
Oooooh! By your power I'll take my revenge!
Oooooh! Through the Heaven's gates,
to the other side of death.
