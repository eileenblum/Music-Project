Cold blades, end of life
Violent pleasure in his eyes.
Rising storm there's no hide for me.
Smell of fear, smell of death
I see the sorrow on their faces,
words of pain whisper in my head.

I will revenge (all burn in flames)
I must stop them (I can't stop this evil)
Time for a change (I will revenge)
I will kill them.
I will revenge (all burn in flames)
I must stop them (I can't stop this evil)
Time for a change (I will revenge)
I will kill them.

Again I am recalling my days
With the power of the wisdom.
Please God help me to find the way,
and I'll fight him 'till the end.

Let me take his sins tonight.
I feel the power growing inside me.

I will revenge (all burn in flames)
I must stop them (I can't stop this evil)
Time for a change (I will revenge)
I will kill them.

And if death is the same of life
All this would be only eternity.

Again I am recalling my days
With the power of the wisdom.
Please God help me to find the way,
and I'll fight him 'till the end.
