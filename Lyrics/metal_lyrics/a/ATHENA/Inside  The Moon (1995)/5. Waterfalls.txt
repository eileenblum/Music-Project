Gardens made of still water
rise their face on a frozen forest.
She drinks the sand of the lie
while islands lost, dissolve the time.

The ice is forming all around her deep eyes
now ancient gardens are flying on the water.

The long river flows through a forest
but now she sees he's dying,
for all the time has passed
the man she sees was crying.

Running to freedom waterfall cries,
open its gardens to leave the world of dreams.
The sun is shinning reflecting the sky
over the garden to leave the world of dreams.
