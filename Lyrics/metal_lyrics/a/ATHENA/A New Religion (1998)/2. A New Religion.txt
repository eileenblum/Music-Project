Some people trust in some religious creed
believing in what the other said
now close your eyes and make your own choice
so call my name and I will be here.

Be my voice and what I say
and be the words I can't pray.
Be my eyes and what you see
to be the light of my way.

Angels, angels, have a new religion
never knowing its side.
Angels, angels, a new god is rising
like blood that is burning.

Feel no sorrow if I have you by my side.

Evil lights sealed in time leave their bloody holes
and with ancient rites I begin to know.
I watch them burn changin' in my soul
their wear my skin (and) become a new god.

Angels, angels, have a new religion
never knowing its side.
Angels, angels, a new god is rising
like blood that is burning.

Be my eyes and what you see, to be the light of my way,
please be my voice and what I say.

I scream inside your sorrow
I taste their skin
my future has no face is their fear.
You lose screams in my veins
but I switch you with life.
I'm a crow in the night
I'm the storm you've inside
You've the world at your feet but you still want to die.

Feel no sorrow if I have you by my side.
