I walk the light that burns the sand
and join all horizon's lands,
a new disorder comes to my eyes
with all your rhymes you're always telling me.

Every word I still and whisper
makes me walk away.

I sail the time through my mind, through the days, through my life.

(In my) Subconscious I've been crying
sitting on your hopes.

Every word I still and whisper
makes me walk away.

I sail the time through my mind, through the days, through my life.
