Here we are
empty spaces,
You could be the only one.
Here we are,
rain is falling
all around this silent sea.

'Cause never, you'll never be yourself
and never, never see your end.
Silence divides streams of nowhere
dark lights shine in me.

Here we are, why are you screamin'
all around the sirens call.

'Cause never, you'll never be yourself
and never, never see your end.
Silence divides streams of nowhere
dark lights shine in me.

Take my secret vision,
You know the reason of your life ain't nothing easy.
Change my secret vision,
You know the reason of your life ain't nothing easy.

Now I know thousand of ways to
feel your soul for a while.

'Cause never, you'll never be yourself
and never, never see your end.
Silence divides streams of nowhere
dark lights shine in me.

Take my secret vision,
You know the reason of your life ain't nothing easy.
Change my secret vision,
You know the reason of your life ain't nothing easy.
