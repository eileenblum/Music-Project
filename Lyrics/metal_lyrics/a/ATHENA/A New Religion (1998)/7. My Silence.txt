There's a voice
a word that sleeps away,
she screams and shows the land
for a moment.

There's a place
where you are not the same
and tears leave your mind
so the world will cry no more.

I need another place to contemplate my silence,
to show you the sea of my dreams,
imaginary words fill my darkness
to control the streams of time and pain.

Here's my soul
reach for it.
Lose control
forget me.

'Cause I am leaving, I am leaving the real world
'Cause I am leaving, I forget my real world.

In my words I know silent screams,
I can see the tears around me.

Be there take down my mind
don't turn away from my hopes.
See there shining light now is fadin'.
I'm here to waste your mind
there's no time for tears,
you'll lose your mind in my world.
He pointed to the rain...

I've seen another man
he was alone and silent
he controlled the sea of my dreams.
I've seen the light in the darkness
I've made some sense of this.

'Cause I am leaving, I am leaving the real world
'Cause I am leaving, I forget my real world.
