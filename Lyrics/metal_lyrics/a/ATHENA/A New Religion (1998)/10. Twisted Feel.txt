I can't sleep and I can't stand and I feel so cold
forget me don't tell me there's more time for me.
Don't look back leave my way and I can reach my way
I don't care about what you tell me, there's no time for me.

Let me find the promised land for my soul,
listen to your voice that whispers.

Why can't you hear me
tell me the world that you want,
why can't you feel me
tell me the life that you want.

I see your face, what's going on
and the past becomes a whisper
now it's all so clear.
I see your face what's going on
listen to your silent sorrow
have more reasons to try.

I can't sleep and I can't stand and I feel so cold
forget me don't tell me there's more time for me.
Don't look back leave my way and I can reach my way
I don't care about what you tell me, there's no time for me.

Why can't you hear me
tell me the world that you want,
why can't you feel me
tell me the life that you want.

Let me find the promised land for my soul,
listen to your voice that whispers.

Why can't you hear me
tell me the world that you want,
why can't you feel me
tell me the life that you want.
