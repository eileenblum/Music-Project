Madness please take me away
I'm the dead man walkin'
they'll kill my soul.

I'm really tired of the same sad sight
I'm not innocent, here I've lost my pride.

Oh, they'll come here again
with angel eyes without a sin
and you turn your face
I am so far from you.

Call all your pain, call all your crimes,
call and pray.

Crowd wants to bleed my hopes
and feeds on my fear again until I go
and screams to me "YOUR TIME HAS COME"
no chains, no lies, electric glow.

Now they are here again
within their power to burn my sins
and you turn your face
I am so far from you.

Call all your pain, call all your crimes,
call and pray.
