And so you want to leave

an empty glass now to fill,
I'm dying just for you.

How can I forget
all those crazy little things
said and done, for me.

Left silent here.
It's time to know
a sharp pain I feel
and you're gone.

Flying high
(but) I'm not too far
still I feel my scar
(yet) I'm not too far.
Hidden words you won't reveal
you are in for the kill
(something) I knew
lost for you.

And so you want to leave

an empty glass now to fill,
I'm dying just for you.

Left silent here.
It's time to know
a sharp pain I feel
and you're gone.

Flying high
(but) I'm not too far
still I feel my scar.
