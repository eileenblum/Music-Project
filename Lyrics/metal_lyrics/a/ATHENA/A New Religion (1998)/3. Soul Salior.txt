Still I go, I bring a new beginning
I control thefinal destination of your soul
untill the end of the world.

I ride on, to show you what's the meaning
of nature, don't pray for your salvation
lasting waves cherish illusions of life.

Forever I'll hear the cry of the light
from its tears life will be.

My Lord make them see pictures of their life, salvation comes.

Still I go to a new destination
you're too far, from buying your redemption
there's no price for all the sins you have made.

Forever I'll hear the screams of the night
in its flames your lifes will end.

My Lord make them see pictures of their life, salvation comes.
