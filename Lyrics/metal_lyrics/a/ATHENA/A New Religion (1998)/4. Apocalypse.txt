When I see the hands of thunder
crawling in the night,
evil's dream around the creatures
(is) waiting for its time.

Now the beast trusts your sorrow
now it's time to die.
Silence comes, the final storm
rages against the world.

Listen to my lasting dream
every time I need it,
angels cry for your crimes
evil's calm deceives.

Rain is falling all around
to forgive my sins
there's no time to explain,
while my soul is burning inside.

Tears from my eyes when I remember
ash on my hands when I forget.

Now I feel the flames around me
entering my eyes
now the beast trusts your sorrow
now it's time to die.

Listen to my lasting dream
every time I need it,
angels cry for your crimes
evil's calm deceives.

Rain is falling all around
to forgive my sins
there's no time to explain,
while my soul is burning inside.

Tears from my eyes when I remember
ash on my hands when I forget.

Tears from my eyes when I remember
ash on my hands when I forget.
