There's no time to explain
why the flower's fadin'.
It just loses its days
walking in a drop of water.

Forever shines a tear that's falling
taking you down to empty words,
I wonder why my mind is stolen.

Oooh, never on my way
Oooh, never on my way.

I feel your soul your pain,
I feel the winding violence of the storm.

Forever shines a tear that's falling
taking you down to empty words,
I wonder why my mind is stolen.

Oooh, never on my way
Oooh, never on my way.

Follow your heart now and fly high
with golden wings,
never the keeper of silence
will believe in my dreams.
Dust has its fair share of my life
drowning beats of time.

Always beside me she lives again.

Oooh, never on my way
Oooh, never on my way.
