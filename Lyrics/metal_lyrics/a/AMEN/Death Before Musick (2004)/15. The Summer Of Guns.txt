This aint the summer of...
It doesn't matter, it never did
It never meant that much to me
This is the summer of...
It doesn't matter it never did
You / IT never meant that much to me
It doesn't matter, it never did
You never meant anything

With killer flu's, H-Bomb TV
I'm here just to deplore you
I take your Pepsi ad and set fire to Michael Jackson

Too free before you
Too free deformed
Too free before you
Too freak deformed

This is the summer of guns
In the summer of rot
This is the summer of guns
In this summer of Cost

I cannot feed this broken lie
I cannot pay with this inside
Too closed my mind to understand
I left here just before you

Too free before you
Too free deformed
Too free before you
Too freak deform

This is the summer of guns
In the summer of rot
This is the summer of guns
In the summer of costs

This is the summer of...
This is the summer of...
It doesn't matter it never did
You never meant anything to me
With all the kills and all the flu's
You never meant anything

I cannot feed this broken lie
I cannot pay with this inside
I disengaged before you
I never had the upper hand
To close my eyes, to understand
I left here just before you!

Too free before you
Too free deformed
Too free before you
Too freak deform

This is the summer of guns
In the summer of gone
This is the summer of guns
In the summer of law
We got the summer of guns
In the summer of costs
This is the summer of guns
This aint the summer of...
