Sit back and open fire
Sit back and just retire
Sit back and open fire
Sit back and...

Live in submission
Live in a choice
It never meant that much to me
Without permission
Without a voice
I only live when I can't breathe

We couldn't kiss we couldn't fight
We couldn't wait for tomorrow
Without a fist without a fight
We waited for no tomorrow

Sorry
I'm not sorry
Sorry to live my life this way
Sorry to let myself decay
Sorry, I'm not sorry
Sorry to live my life this way
Sorry to let myself decay

Sit back and open fire
Sit back and...

It didn't kill us
The pleasure did
Infected from the things I did
Rip off the willing
Rip off the tried
Slip in beds and open fire

RIOT NOW! Let it be known
And right now just leave me alone
That it's too close for you
'Cause it's too close for me
It meant nothing to you
It was nothing to me

Sorry
I'm not sorry
Sorry to live my life this way
Sorry to let myself decay
Sorry, I'm not sorry
Sorry to live my life this way
Sorry to let myself decay

Sit back and open fire
Sit back and...

Right now!
Just let them open fire
Right now!
Just let them open fire
Right now!
Just let them open fire
Right now!
Just let them open wide
RIOT NOW!
Sorry, I'm not sorry
RIOT NOW!
Sit back and open fire
