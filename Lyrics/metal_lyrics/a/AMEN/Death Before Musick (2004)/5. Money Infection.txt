Rip off the willing
Rip off the dead
Rip off this empty child
Then wishful overheads
We live here in believe?
We're here to be obscene
Through broken windows
Reckless to (the) homeless said

Do you believe in me?
'Cause I bleed in you
I don't care what they say
Money's infected!

Do you bleed in me?
'Cause I bleed in you
I don't care what they say
Money's infected!

Well I got your witness
We've got your empty noose
We wait with broken claws
And sit on your avenue

We live here to believe
We're here to be obscene
With broken windows
And the SARS of avenue

Do you bleed in me?
'Cause I bleed in you
I don't care what they say
Money's infected
Do you believe in me?
'Cause I bleed in you
I don't care what they say
Money's infected

We're all infected!
Money infection!

Join the Navy, slave
We keep cummin for you
Calling for you

Do you believe in me?
'Cause I bleed in you
I don't care what they say
Money's infected
Do you believe in me?
'Cause I bleed in you
I don't care what they say
Money's infected
WE'RE ALL INFECTED!
MONEY INFECTION!
Slave, save
Slave, unsaved
Join the army, slave
