Nation s kept in marbled, a face of yet to be decayed
We kept sick and sorrow, we don't live! ... We betray

Well I don't wanna see your animals
And I don't want to sleep with your animals

IT'S THE POLICY OF ABNDOMENT
IT'S THE HIPOCRISY IN YOUR STABLISHMENT
IT'S THE POLICY OF ABNDOMENT
It's hypocrisy of your heart!

My faces cut and swallowed, caged and you all who befame
Kids are falling out, hollowed, calling out all to tame

Well I don't wanna see your animals
And I don't want to sleep, with you all

IT'S THE POLICY OF ABANDOMENT
IT'S THE HYPOCRISY OF THE ESTABLISHMENT
IT'S THE POLICY OF ABANDOMENT
It's the hypocrisy of your hole!
Of your heart...
