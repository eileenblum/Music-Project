Bring me the heads of Roman Polanski!
Bring me the legs of Fred Astaire!

We come from a place called heaven
That you made hell
That you can sell
We set fires to this lesson
That heavens sell
That lesson failed

War!
We need this WAR
War!
We need this WAR? Right on

Bring me the heads of Roman Polanski!
Bring me the legs of Fred Astaire!

We come from this hell called heaven
That vision held
That vision killed
We set fires to your lessons
Your babies kill
Your babies' guilt

War!
We need this WAR
War!
We need this WAR? Right on

Sell it now, selling out
Everyone you know is selling out
Sell it now, selling out
Everyone you know is selling out

'Cause there's a war and you believe it
'Cause there's a war and you don't care
Sell it all, sell it now, sell it now
'Cause there's a war and you don't see it
'Cause there's a war and you don't care

Sell it now, selling out
Everyone you know is selling out
Sell it now, selling out
Everyone you know is selling out
Bring me the head of Roman Polanski!
Bring me the legs of Fred Astaire!
