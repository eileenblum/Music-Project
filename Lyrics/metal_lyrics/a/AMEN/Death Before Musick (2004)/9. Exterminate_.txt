They shake, what's your fear?
Bet your life you like to fear
They take what you've got
And I make sure they've gone

Too bad you'll never get to know
Too bad they'll never let you go
It's too hard to believe in what you ever read
Too bad you'll never get to know
They'll eliminate you

They got fear in your head
Never get your money here
Fear in your head
Take your money here
Stand in line
Do a line
Stand in line

Too bad you'll never get to know
Too bad they'll never let you go
It's too hard to be believe in what you ever read
Too bad they'll never let you know
Eliminate you

They bleed into your heads with your beds
They take their money from all your little hags
They spread the legs of all your little lambs
They ate and human sacrifice demands

Can I feel? What you feel?
Can I feel? What you feel?
Can I feel? What you feel?
Can I feel what you feel, what you steal?
Where I cant ever want to stand
Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate! Eliminate!
We'll eliminate!
Too bad you'll never get to know
Too bad they'll never let you go
It's too hard to believe in what you ever read
Too bad they'll never get to know
They'll eliminate you
Eliminate you
