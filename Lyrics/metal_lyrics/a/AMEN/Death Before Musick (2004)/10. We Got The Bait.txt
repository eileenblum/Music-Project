Nowhere to burn
Nowhere for no one
It's the same ole sore
And the same ole bleeding
[2x]
Somebody stand up and die
Shoot you
Somebody wake up alive
We got it!

There's nothing to do
And nothing to believe in
With objections of views
Protections by design
We got the bait
We got something for freedom
We got some fool
We got freedom be desire

[Chorus]
We got the bait

We got nowhere to run
Nowhere for no one
There's that same ole sore
In that same ole whore

We got the bait
We got it
