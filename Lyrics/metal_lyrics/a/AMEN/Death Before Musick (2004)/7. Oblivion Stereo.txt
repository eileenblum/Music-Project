I cut myself
I cannot stand this body in this promise land
Calling out for remedies in family seminars

So wouldn't you, wouldn't you
Let your country die here?
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you
Settle down?

We're living in stereo
We're shooting in the discos
Oblivion stereo
We're shooting in the discos
Seminars in stereo
Seminars at the disco
Seminars in stereo
Seminars at the disco

We spend our lives give a fee meal
We wash but still we cannot feel
We carry all the homeless deals
We sit here catatonic!
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you
Let your country die here
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you
Settle down?

We're living in stereo
We're shooting in the discos
Oblivion stereo
We're shooting in the discos
Seminars in stereo
Seminars at the disco
Seminars in stereo
Seminars at the disco, selling ours!
We're just livin'
Oblivion stereo
We're just livin'
Oblivion stereo
Oblivion stereo
Oblivion stereo
Oblivion stereo
Oblivion stereo
We're disco now
