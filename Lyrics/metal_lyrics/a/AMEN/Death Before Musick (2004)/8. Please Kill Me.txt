This house of shit
And I live in it
In this house of shit
And I breathe in it

Said don't you want to feed the blind?
In this festival of demise
Kissed you lead the blind
Lay back and open wide

There is not time to talk about it
No time to sit and smile
We talk but say nothing
There's no time to reconcile

It's been too long in this alone time
Said it's been too long in this lonely time

Please kill me
Don't wanna be alive
Just kill me
Don't stay alive
Just kill this life of guns and kill your sons
Please kill me
Don't wanna be alive
Just kill me
Don't stay alive
Just kill this life of guns and kill yourself

In this house of shit
And I live in it
In this house of shit
And I breed in it

There is no time to talk about it
No time for your corporate smiles
Fill up on your fast food diets
Fill up on your denial

It's been too long in this alone time
Said it's been too long in this whoreless time

Please kill me
Don't wanna be alive
Just kill me
Don't stay alive
Just kill this life of guns and kill your sons
Please kill me
Don't wanna be alive
Just kill me
Don't stay alive
Just kill this life of guns and kill yourself

In this house of shit
This house of shit
Built on regret
In this house of...

Please kill me
Don't wanna be alive
Just kill me
Don't stay alive
Just kill this life of guns and kill your sons
Please kill me
Don't wanna be alive
Just kill me
Don't stay alive
Just kill this life of guns and kill yourself

Please kill me
Why don't you kill me?
Why don't you kill me?
Why don't you live a while in this house of shit
THIS HOUSE OF SHIT
THIS HOUSE OF SHIT
THIS HOUSE OF SIHT
LIVE IT!
