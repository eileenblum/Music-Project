California's Bleeding
California's dunes

I've never seen anything like it before
'Cause you don't "use it"
It's alright
On the sunset strip we can take your lip
And we can use it
So hold tight

We're beating 'em down
For a long time
You never know when you can feel it inside

California's bleeding
In your California's dunes
California's dreamin'
California's, California is used

I can take it now and I can take your "use"
And you can "use it"
It's alright
We come from back alleys
And the back doors of all your abusement
Tonight:

We're feeding 'em now
For a long time
You never know when you can feel it inside

California's bleeding
In your California's dunes
California's dreamin'
Californian, California's

Destination anywhere
Destination anywhere?
Destination anywhere?
Situation nowhere

There's fear in your valley
Get on your skateboard and split
There's fear with your:

California's bleeding
In your California dunes
California's dreamin'
Wish your lovers with your faded

Destination anywhere
Situation nowhere?

I've been beating 'em down
For a long time
California's bleeding!
