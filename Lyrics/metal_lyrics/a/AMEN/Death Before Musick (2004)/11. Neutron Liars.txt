Destroy your newborn future
We are your neutron liars

I am machines
And I work
Left to decay
Then I cut like you
I am not worth
And I burned
When I'm away
Won't ever learn

(We are the liars) I shoot at you - you shoot at me
(We are liars)
(We are the liars) I see the things you can't believe
(We are liars)

Destroy your NEWBORN FUTURE!
We are your NEUTRON LIARS!

I am deceive
And I don't cut
For this debris
And I am but
A bit deceive
'Cause I hurt
A bit diseased
'Cause I work

(We are the liars) I shoot at you - you shoot at me
(We are liars)
(We are the liars) I laugh at the things you can't believe
(We are liars)

Destroy your NEWBORN FUTURE!
We are your NEUTRON LIARS!

Watch THIS (machine)
When I work (and work)
Well I am diseased (turn)
When I cut like you (a bite to save)
(We are the liars) I shoot at you - you shoot at me
(We are liars)
(We are the liars) I laugh at the things you can't believe
(We are gone:)

Destroy your NEWBORN FUTURE
We are your NEUTRON LIARS!

We are your neutron liars
