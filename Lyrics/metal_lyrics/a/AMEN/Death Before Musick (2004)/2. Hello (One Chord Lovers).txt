Rise up and be discarded
Rise up to be misunderstood
Rise up and be discarded
Rise up to be misunderstood
Misunderstood

We've got dogs with pets, man who begs
It's so nice to feed you
We've brought dogs without legs and man in shed,
Though it's nice to greet you

Rise up and be discarded
Rise up to be... misunderstood.

Hello
'Cause we are the harmless
Said hello
It's time to be Mr. Good
Hello, goodbye, hello
We say goodbye! 'Cause you say hello

Rise up!
Rise up!

We've got hogs in debt, man who begs
And they're glad to beat you
We are whores in beds with ladies inbred
It's so nice to feed up

Rise up and discarded
Rise up to be:misunderstood

Hello
'Cause we are the harness
Said hello
It's time to be Mr. Good
Hello, goodbye, hello
We say goodbye! 'Cause you say Hello

We are alone
We are at home
When we're at home

Hello
It's time to be in this harness
Said hello
It's time to be Mr. Good
Hello, goodbye, hello
We say goodbye 'cause you say hello
