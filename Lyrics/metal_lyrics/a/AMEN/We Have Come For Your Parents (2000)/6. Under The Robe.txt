If I could take this skin off
I'd trade it for your riches
Just watch the sick turn
Into the witches

Well I just sit + wait
A call of arms to the bodies deceived
Well I just sit + wait
Till your lies believe in little school
S.O.S.

Paranoia pays for your freedom
Well I just sit + wait till everybody *** them
Just how does it feel?
Cause I just sit + wait everybody frees them
Till your bodies filled
We don't need no more of your observations
Cause we sit + hide
Under the robe
We don't need no more of your observations
We just feel alive
Under the robe

The liberation posted up the signs + everygirl in this house is on the pill
I had to turn mu fucking skin
Inside out just for you
Said, sit + wait thought you're gonna make some
Fuck pig like you
Said I'm the sick one lady?
With the right abuse in little school
S.O.S.

Paranoia pays for your freedom
Don't read the signs - everybody frees them
The signs - everybody feeds them
No sign - everybody leaves them
No sign

We don't need no more of your observations
Cause we sit + hide
Under the robe
We don't need no more of your observations
We just feel alive under the robe + paid for
S.O.S.
We are under robed
And with your freedom.
