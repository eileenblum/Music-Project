Take my head, rip it open
Take the sickness, buried it too
Take my head, rip it open
Take the scissors, sliced to fill

Did you wanna know how the humans-being
Tied the lies that you believed
Did you know the human need
Is bigger than the received
Give-for-get
You can take mine
You can take my fucking head
And bury it in the backyard
Take my head, take my head
Take my head, rip it open
Take the stiches, licensed to you
Take my head, rip it open
Take the harness, built for you

Dig your therapist a grave
Big enough for both of you

Get-for-give? Now.
You can take mine

Someone tell me how to live
Someone tell me how you live
Someone tell me how to live
Someone tell me how you live in here

You can take mine
You can take my fucking head
