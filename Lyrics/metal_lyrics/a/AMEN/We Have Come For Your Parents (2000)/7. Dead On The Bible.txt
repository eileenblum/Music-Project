Don't want to be in this war
Like when your sister fucked your best friend
Don't wanna sit you here no more
The dinner table has whores now
Buy your rent, rent to fill
Fill the dead into the Hollywood hills

Get out, get out, get out, get out

Don't wanna be here anymore
Like when your sister sucked my own cock
Can't stand to sit here anymore
We just wait on the faultline

The fear is here, the fear, the fear

Don't wanna be here anymore
We sit mouths open on the faultline
No crucifixition here no more
The stakes we made win the prize here

I'm out to forget that you ever
Dead on the bible, dead on the bible
Dead on the bible, dead on the bible

Get out you'll get addicted
We're the rifles of addiction
We take the pictures on the boredom line
We are the rifles of your addiction
We lay on bombs on your borderlines

Dead on the bible, dead on the bible
Dead on the bible, dead on the bible
Get out you'll get addicted, get out you'll get addicted
You get

Prayers are porno
My prayers are porno
In a dead star nation
