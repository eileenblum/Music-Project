I live off poison
And that's ok
Cause I can do what I can do here
I lick the poison
But I don't care

Cause I'm bored and fuckin' scared

We can make the bombs we can make them right
We can live your lives sinking dynamite
We can get the knives at the liquor store
We can make the knives go nationwide

My medication never lies
I live off drugs
And that's a joke
I never know everything I took
Why can't I make
Your new year
Without a facial + a tear
We can make the bombs we can make them right
We can live your lives sink in dynamite
Cause of 18-18-18
No life did you know what I mean
Cause of 18-18-18

I got the mans disease
In here
Can't look...
Every eyelash...

We can make the bombs we can make them right
We can live your lives
Sink in dynomite
Cause of 18-18-18
No life if you know what I mean

Just get me out of here
The waiting 18
18
The waiting 18
Get out of here
