I was born an amputee inside here
Who can't turn and pledge allegiance
We just fall inline + we just fall behind
We default your procreation
We default your assassination

Paralysed
We're paralysed

We are born from you-we've come to
Calvin Klein's the killer
They want to - look like you
Calvin Klein's the killer

This fashion is a warning sign
You were shot for your division
We just fall behind + we just fall inline

Paralysed
We're paralysed

Cause Calvin Klein's the killer
Versace now is the killer
Calvin Klein's the killer
Versace now is the killer

Paralysed
