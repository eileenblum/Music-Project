I remain unused to bleed the menace
That remains to fall
Don't take no summer vacation
That remains to fall
We refuse to work in your death camp station
We refuse to buy
We consume the life of the molested neighbour
We're unused
I am right
Refuse Amen
Let the pigs die by regulations
Cause their bound to fall
Don't pay no humiliation
Cause you can die in this truth
I refuse to work in your death camp station
I refuse to buy
I'll be standing here with the molested neighbours
You can see it,
You can feel it, right?
When I am right
Right?

Cause your rights have gone
Until your death confession
Until your death confession
Until your death confession
Into your death concession

Refuse Amen
