These legs are spread
Guiding tomb
Gun in the mouth
Open wound
(They fly around me)
(Do they see what I see?)
We can't kill the witness
(With all the children dying)
(From all that crying)

Inside my television
Inside my television
Inside my television
Without this resurrection

These legs are spread
Guiding tomb
Gun in my mouth
Open wound
(They fly around me)
(And I see what they see)

We can't kill the witness
(And all the parents dying)
(From all that lying)
Inside my television
Inside my television
Inside my television
Without this resurrection
