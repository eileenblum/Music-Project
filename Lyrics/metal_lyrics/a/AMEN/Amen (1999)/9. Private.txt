murder goes on too long

i told the truth when i fucked the knives
drug down the city and burn house for highs
i suck it up, suck it in
suck the needle and lets begin
singles out the recorder
and you used to

you cannot wait another day
so every needle in the trade

in your private corner
in your private fear
in your private corner

murder goes on too long

ive been around for forty days and nights
cities blazed we're wasting radiates the nights
suck it up, you dont hear
refill the needle and lets begin
the drugs dont kill, but they used to

you cannot wait another day
so every needle in the trade

in your private corner
it's your private fear
in your private corner
someones gonna pave that fear

fear (grumbled)

in your private corner
in your private fear
it never comes down to long
someones gonna pave that fear
in your private corner
it's your private fear
cause sometimes it gets too long
for all to stay here
