'Cause all the teeth they save
And all the lies they made
With all the garbage here
We're still starving
Another kind of sheep
Another kind of sheep
They bow your heads to sheep
Another kind of sheep is falling
Everything is untrue
Everything that you do
Everything is untrue
Just everything I know
'Cause I fuck myself
Can't feel no one else
And I just feed my God
To the starving
Another kind of sheep
They fuck and suck you to sleep
They fuck inside the sheep
Another another another another

Everything is untrue
Everything that you do
Everything is untrue
Just everything I know
Why do I lie and wake
Blind, dead, and leading
I know you want a god
'Cause I've got nothing
Nothing to bleed in
And you bought a god
Everything is untrue
There is nothing I can subdue
Everything is untrue
There's nothing I can undue
You bought it
Don't fuckin' move
Don't fuckin' move
I just want to end your life
For a little while
'Cause everything is untrue
Don't fuckin' move 'cause I loved you
Don't fuckin' move or I'll cut you
Don't fuckin' move or I'll love you
Don't fuckin' move cause I cut you

How could you love you
