Resignation, circumsize
I can't stand this face and everything you say
Force fed me to the enemy
And I take the things I know I should not
Turned me into the enemy

Station, station - remote control
Frustration station - that sold his soul
Cause I sold myself to die
It's a solitary
New war station
Watch it burn the nation

I destroy myself cause I can't free
Free the world of the enemy
The pigs they have and the gods they feed
Feed the lives of the enemy
Station, station - frustration station
"It is the violence in the silence"
It's a solitary
New war station
Watch it burn the nation


Thanks to fade_to_black_ for sending track #9 lyrics.
