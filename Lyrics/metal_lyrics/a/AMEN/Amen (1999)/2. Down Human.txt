Destroy what I embrace
Caught. I am stuck at the walls
And I piss for another taste
Pill, just to cure
From the imprisonment
And your incisionment to the
Stranded. Violated
Shit. Violated
Down in a home
Inhuman hole
Bring down the human

Because I sleep
With these handcuffs on
And I piss
With these handcuffs on
And I belong and I belong
And I belong to no one
Stranded. Violated
Hit. Violated
Down in a home
Inhuman hole
Bring down the human

Because I sleep with these handcuffs on
And I piss with these handcuffs on
And I am locked and I belong
And I belong. And I
I can't wash this dress
With blood + piss
Bring down the invalid human
Piss. Drinking piss. Sink in piss
Destroy. Destroy
Stranded. Shit
Cause I'm down in a home
Brought down
Destroyed
