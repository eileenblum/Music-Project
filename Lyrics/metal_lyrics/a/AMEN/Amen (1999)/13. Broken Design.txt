It's the money disguised
In the blink of their eyes
Blurring the minds of the fallen
Teach in the crime teachin' the blind
These are the cunts on a street named desire

Locked design and no way out
Locked design and no way out
Why do I feel this way?
I feel this way every day

Forcing and taunting this lifer is haulting
Constant demise of the fallen
Broken inside Broken inside
These are the cunts on a street named desire

Locked design and no way out
Locked design and no way out
Why do I feel this way?
I feel this way every day

I wanna live I wanna live to get some
Don't wanna live, I don't wanna live now
You said your life is gonna get bad some
You never know what life to live
Broken Design
Broken Now
Who's broken now?
