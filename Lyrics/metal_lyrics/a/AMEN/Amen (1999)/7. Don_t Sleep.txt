And I have seen what your children see
All these nuns are pregnant, dance in kerosene
Stand defiled and dewombed
Unreconciled flooded girls at the back of my window!

And I don't sleep

Father sees what baby breeds
Through the windshot windows
That torture freely
I can't see what the day light breeds
All the fattening mothers
And their tortured sexing!

I don't sleep
Tied up
Tied up
Tired
I'm tied up
Don't eat Don't sleep Don't dream in America
Don't work Don't walk Don't wake in America
Surrender?
