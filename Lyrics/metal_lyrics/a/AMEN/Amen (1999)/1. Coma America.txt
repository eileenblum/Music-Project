This is for the suffer
This is for the proof
This is for the lover soaking in the truth
This is for the liar
This is for the dream
This is for America burning at the seas

Cut off

This is for the treason
This is for the speed
This is for the money cumming in the mouths of the me
This is for the president
This is for the bomb
This is for the believers and all who belong

Coma America

This is for the believers of the truth
This is for the dreamers of the truth
These are for the seeds for all who pollute
Polluters of the blind and all who use

Coma America

I am out!
