I stand here cause I can feel the pain
I don't know who's to blame
This culture feed and breeds dissension
Ascension everyone is born rejected
Like to live?
The same, you're all the same
Inside home hits decay you
Depression Oppression every rape for obsession
Nothing I stand here with
Nothing I fill myself
Nothing I burn myself with
Faith cause I can't stand you
Every time you look away
All the dogs will fly away
These victims climb all over me
And I can never descend

This is the last time This is the last time
Cause I'm going down where I can never stand
The last time on the burning sands
I stand here cause I can't feel the pain
You know the Fuckin' names
This culture ties you it lies you
Everything I can't deny you
I'm blind come in here
Alive feeling I can't
Alive feeling all the lies
I see al your love in here
That you spill...
This is the last time. This is the last time
Cause I'm going down where I can never stand
The last time on the burning sands
The last time.
