Drive Drive it home right now
Drive it home know how
Take it from my heart
Gotta tear yourself apart
From hell...sinking hell
Like disease where I dwell
Burning kidneys where I roam
Never taking you back home
Let it out ride tonight
Drive Drive it home right now
Drive it home know how
Take me from my heart
You gotta tear yourself apart
Drive it home right now
Drive it home know how
Told you from the start
Tear your fucking head apart
Drive me home right now
Drive it home know how
Take it from my heart
Take me from my heart
Ground, turning ground burn it down burn it down
Crucify my nation Crucify the population
Time dollar line try to find where you gonna run to hide
From my eyes from my mind
Into my children's face... their faces
Stay away! Goddamn it Stay away! Never come back!
Disintegrate, Decision and the popular creation
Let it out, ride tonight
So he loed and you lied and that bitch she knows she's gonna die
Keep it hiding, deep inside, she lied to swallow her pride
That bitch knows where it goes, Down Incineration
Incinerate My Mind
Incinerate My Nation

Punishment? Exiled. Punishment? Exiled.
Watch it fall... Watch it fall... Watch it fall
