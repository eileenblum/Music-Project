Well I freak down every time I'm near you
I just sit and watch your demise
Well I just kick now every time I see you
Empty jars of blood and flies
Cause I just tear myself in two
Everytime I look at you
All I see are the lies
Cause I'm a freak now Everytime I see you
Everyday of the week
Well I'm the freak, yeah; I'm the freak
I'm the freak now; Freak

If you could understand
When a man dies a woman
If you could hold the head
When a man dies a woman

Bring me the heads of your disgrace
And the smack of your embrace
I just clip the wings of birth and rape
Cause I bleed like you and your thighs
Blind like you
Cause I'm a freak now everytime I see you
Everyday of the week
I'm the freak, yeah; I'm the freak
I'm the freak now; Freak

If you could understand
When a man dies a woman
If you could hold the head
When a man dies a woman

Why can't you understand
That you got to bleed like you're a woman
Cause I just cut you by the slain
When a man dies a woman
Who's freakin' now?
Freak it now!
Why can't you understand?
