A nation of fools a nation of lies
1000 fools for 100 lies
Believe nothing that I tell you
Believe nothing that I say

Fever. Got you fevered

Going down on everything I wanted
I'm sucking off anything diseased
This that this and that this and that
Bombing every fear I need
Fever. Got you Fevered
Can't you feel the bombs around you?
Coming home and falling on you
Get it? Get it? Get it? Get it?
No
Got you fevered
