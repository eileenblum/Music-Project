Drawn down from the face of the earth to reconcile all the sins of mankind
He who stands on the great white throne shall smite the enemy blind

ENEMY!

"For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad."
[2 Corinthians 5:10]

Behold the fall of the idols who created this generation of failure
He who stands on the great white throne refuses to find any kind of cure

FOR THIS IS REAL:
WE CONCEAL YOUR APPEAL
END OF DEAL

"And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them."
[Revelation 20:11 (King James)]

"Let no man deceive you by any means:
for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first,
and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;

Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.
[2 Thessalonians 2:3-6]
