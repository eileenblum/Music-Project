Close up the streams of morbid affection
Bring the world to its knees by this stale neglection
We stand alone in lines - against the defeat
Plagued by defenseless fear, positioned to retreat

He who stands on the great white throne
We will come to know his name

We have been waiting
We have been waiting for him to come
We have been waiting
We have been waiting for this new son

Defiled in greed and loath, divided by doubt
Laced with venom, this pride's an incessant bout
Piled upon the flood of emptiness, failure and void
The sons of perdition - human consumed demonoid

He who stands on the great white throne
He will see and he will bleed
We will come to know this new son
Son of Perdition, the only Katechon

We have been waiting
We have been waiting for him to come
We have been waiting
We have been waiting for this new son

He who stands on the great white throne
He will see and he will bleed

We had been waiting
We had been waiting for this to come
We had been saving
We had been saving the world to none

... is this your hell?
