Applaud the invaders
Who feed their opinions to weakling minds
Violating their rights to obtain their own convictions without any fear
Hereditary / stupidity - conclusion endless / misanthropy

Violation - they show no sense nor pity
Annihilation - under their hand you seek for validity
Violation - uphold their animosity
Annihilation - Breach of integrity

Compulsion to adhere
Decrees that rule out your convictions
There are no limitations to truth when the thrones are conquered by those who force feed
Eradication / deprivation - beaten into complete submission

Violation - they show no sense nor pity
Annihilation - under their hand you seek for validity
Violation - crush their animosity
Annihilation - Breach of integrity

Behold their powers
Our flesh is weak, but their minds are weaker
The oppressed and deprived are the puppets who bind their own strings above their masters
Violation / annihilation - indignant, but ephemeral idolization

Violation - they show no sense nor pity
Annihilation - under their hand you seek for validity
Violation - uphold their animosity
Breach of integrity
