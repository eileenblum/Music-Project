We're left all alone, with our own deficient image
Compressed with all the boundaries that should improve the stability of civilization
INIQUITY - you forget about the truth we're all human
You beat the beaten til we all wonder why there was no one to take action

It's the absolute truth, we're all consuming beasts
Pushed over the edge where uncontrollable hate redefines our adopted confinements
INIQUITY - lines stretched to seek entitlement to bestial deeds
UBIQUITY - can't avert your eyes 'cause everyone around you bleeds

Come what may, we're not here to stay
From the emptiness we are bound to another plain
Be that as it may, no games left to play
Before the round of bullets starts swirling, remember there's no turning back

You stare at their skin tone like it's a venomous disease
Create yet another way to discriminate the tremulous and prod them on their knees
INIQUITY - tortured cells of misfit ideologies will dictate
UBIQUITY - can't deny the possibility of the atonement ... of love and hate

Come what may, we're not here to stay
From the emptiness we are bound to another plain
Be that as it may, no games left to play
Before the round of bullets starts swirling, remember there's no turning back
