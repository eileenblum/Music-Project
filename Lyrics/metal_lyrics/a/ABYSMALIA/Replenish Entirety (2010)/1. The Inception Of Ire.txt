[Music by Jouni Koskela, April 2009, Lyrics by Jouni Koskela, June 2009]

Lay down the memories youâve achieved this far
Puzzle together the pieces you've built from your scars
Read between these lies and seek for absolution
Eternities facing this obsolete tribulation

Now, as this hypnosis recedes, and you finally awake
You are aware of all the variables in your debate
Read between these lies and seek for your own perception
You are held responsible for my vast tribulations

I have seen when realities recede, when appearances are (only) illusions
I have been where the oceans concur, shipwrecked on the sea of delusions

Read between these lies and seek for absolution
Eternities facing this, the inception of ire
