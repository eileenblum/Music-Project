[Music by Jouni Koskela, December 2004, Lyrics by Jouni Koskela, January 2009]

Shipwrecked on the sea of delusions - still trapped in this coil of illusions
Defile the overflow of agony and rage
Obscured, uncured, imbued with profound anxiety
Rest assured, there's time for me to repay what you've done

Rearrange, disengage this failure from my heart
Redefine my identity by forging new scars
After all, I admire your behavior - leaving chaos on its wake
Transforms all the mirrors to portals to psychotic inertia

(I) found myself trapped in (you) a coil of illusions
(Now) I've got to get away (Got to get away from)
(Truth) The only solution (proof) for this conclusion
(Lies) in the arms of fate

Trapped inside a coil of illusions

(I) found myself trapped in (you) a coil of illusions
(Now) I've got to get away (Got to get away from)
(Truth) The only solution (proof) for this conclusion
(Lies) in the arms of fate - trapped inside a coil of illusions

Through all the tribulations in overcoming the iniquities
These restraints entwined us reluctantly to sail the seas

Even though, the downward slope curves too steep - we still recede
Undenied, the time is ripe to intervene - we will deplete
