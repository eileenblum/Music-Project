[Music by Jouni Koskela, September 2008, Lyrics by Jouni Koskela, April 2009]

At night I listen to the sound of no one sleeping
Fainting sunlight treating mind with pressured yearning
How long until collapses arrive?

Pass the time please, 'cause here is all that I'll be needing
Rather watch the naiads and sinners bleeding, weeping
How long until collapses arrive?

This is it; the end of all
Cathartic verge for the redemption of our woes
I am now at peace, at ease
Free from the plaguing disease
