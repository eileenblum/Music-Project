[Music by Jouni Koskela, March 2009, Lyrics by Jouni Koskela, March 2009]

To the one who sailed insidious seas,
Sought endeavours corroding our plea
I hereby declare your claims inane
And cast a virtue to render me sane (again)

Conclude insanity to the one who still can't see
What's the ideology beyond this treachery
Conspire anomalies to intervene mendacity,
Forfeit the right to withdraw your words out of hypocrisy

How can you be what you are and live this relentless tragedy?
A fallen angel, a mouth full of empty praise and outright lies

Breaking the cycle, the openings cease
Still in denial, the tainted please
But you will - find yourself wondering

Dies irae upon your each and Every dawn,
Your accomplice - the scarab and the pawn
In this Game you will reside next to the board
Awaiting the final judgement from your lord

How can you be what you are and live this relentless tragedy?
A fallen angel, a mouth full of empty praise and outright lies

Breaking the cycle, the openings cease
Still in denial, the tainted please
But you will - find yourself wondering

How can you be what you are
A fallen angel, a mouth full of empty praise
