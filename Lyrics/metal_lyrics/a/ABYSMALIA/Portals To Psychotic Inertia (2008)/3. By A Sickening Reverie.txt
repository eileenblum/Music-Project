Deep in mind - where dreams are born - there's nothing to be found
In a place of emotional chaos, there's nothing truly profound
By a sickening reverie, I can no longer find peace
Only fear and desperation - all good has already ceased

Stripped feelings of safety wrapped in caresses by illusions
There will be a time for me to wake up from this delusion

Deep in mind - where dreams are born - there's something I can't explain
Shreds of dead eloquence drown in the void, clad in disdain
By a sickening reverie, black seconds taking over me
Nothing left for me to do, but wait until I cannot breathe

Stripped feelings of loathe wrapped up to consider myself as illusion
Not that I would care anymore, it was a natural dissolution

This is all what's left of me, a vague number of dissolving stories
Bipolar tendencies have really taken over me
With the sickening memory, I can no longer find peace
Only fear and desperation - all good has already ceased

Blindfold in desolation, you compromise the safety of mind
Aggression is your only key, the door is there for you to find
