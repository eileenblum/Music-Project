You are the one inside my eyes
Within the sketches from my childhood
You are the one within my veins
Beneath the veil of my open heart

You are the one around my age
Asleep against my dreams awake
You are the one beyond each soul
Ascendancy from all the above

You are the one who heals all pain
My wounds are bleeding for you alone
You are the one of angel dust
The naiad of my every dawn

Eternally?
