Boundless human stupidity
Lose the grasp over control to acknowledge the facts
Poison apple toxicity
Deny all your deeds to conform, state the obvious

Wreckless disobedience
Hatred is the only way to survive through all this
Open moral boundary
To not regret is to neglect - and make me suffer

Shipwrecked on the sea of delusions
Conflict in the understatement

Nauseous insufficiency
Tear me apart with all these lies - make me blind
Can't you really see?
Caring only to compromise the safety of mind

Shipwrecked on the sea of delusions
Conflict in the understatement

No moral to comply, the actions steal the words from the eye
I'm blind to the halo and immune to the foreign angel left to die

I'm blind to the halo
I'm blind to all you've left behind
Blind to the presence that no longer waves this ocean of mine
