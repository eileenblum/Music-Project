I decide to write 
letters 
to my masters on the wall 
My life is so empty 
And now I will learn how to manipulate human souls 

Increase my isolation 
To feed my self-creation 
Down in the pit, get the beast on a hook 
Can I save myself? 

Famous for their kills 
Stories for my kids 
Reply - I win 
Good, the path is clean 

Now it's time to prove my beliefs 
Face to face with killers 
Seduction, thats the test 
A taste of one's last breath [x2]

Poisoning and suffocation 
Mutilation, no control 
Violation of existence 
But I'm the smartest of them all 

Light, what I seek, look at me 
Hear my questions, tell me 
The smell of death, the feel - 
Im longing for the feel [x4]

Take me 

Near the time of uncreation 
Saved by a prison guard 
A little taste of non-existence 
But this was not a game for him 

Blood in his eyes 
The beast inside 

This is not over, my search for a window 
To another world 
Die to find 
What's beyond life 
Then come back for more
