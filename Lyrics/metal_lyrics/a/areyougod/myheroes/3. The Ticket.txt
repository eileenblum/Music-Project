Telephone ringing at your home again 
Give them 
your donation 
You do 
the best you can 

These motherfuckers 
Get you in their game, playing with your prayers 
Religion is a gun 
Kill'em all 

Behind sweet talks one sacred farce 
Peace for the world for your money to bring 
My friend you're a loser 

Many ways to be a good man 
Helping the poor to find a good life 
Rich life 
for the fake 
Fake 

This, the path to your salvation 
When will you finally understand? 
What a reason for donations! 

Guilt you feel for exploitation 
Damage your checkbook has to repair 

Maybe you should take the pain 
Pay the price 
Or ask yourself the worth of your bought prayers 

Heaven for a price 

Mansions and limousines 
Jets and filthy yatchs 
Your guilt - 
maintained to keep them fat 

Dig deep 
Your pocket has no end 
They drop their pants and you will bend 

Your home 
Your car 
Sell your kids and you'll go far 

Your life 
A hole 
What's gone now returns above 

Abandon all reason 
Freeze your flesh and blood 
And then when you're in heaven 
you will sadly realize 

Abandon all reason 
Freeze your flesh and blood 
You will sadly realize 
There's no return
