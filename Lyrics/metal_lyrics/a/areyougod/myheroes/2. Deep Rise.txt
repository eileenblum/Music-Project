You've got to boost your mind 
Just don't leave behind 
Your right to freedom 
- seek all the answers 

Don't throw away 
Your biggest chance 
To find a life to live 

Studying ways to comprehend 
Try to understand the human matter 
Try to understand - 
Try to understand the understood 

Dedication made your head a cold thinking machine 
Medications are the law 
You're born just to win 
To win the race to be the model doctor 
The modern doctor 
The fancy doctor 

Your illusions fade away 
When you make an error [x4]
Goodbye 

Throwing away your only chance 
You thought that you knew 
Crippled man, sad remains 
God will not help you 
No friend but yourself 
You'll pay for that 
Prepare for the real test 

Throwing away your only chance 
You thought that you knew 
Crippled man, sad remains 
You'll pay for that 
Prepare for the real test 
God will not help you 
No friend but yourself 

Compassion dies 
Lords of opression 
In jail you'll die 
Your knowledge won't help you now 

Loser 
This is what you are 
Bad dreams 
Nightmares, mental scars 
The weight of justice will crush you 
And smash your middling good intentions
