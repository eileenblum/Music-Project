Here's nothing here but dying
There ain't no use to pray
Your mothers keep on crying
Till the light of day

I drink this life you've given me
My chalice, mortal man
I'll curse your soul eternally
Humanity be damned

Ain't no heaven here boy
God has left this place
All those here are hellbound
In my dark embrace

I drink this life you've given me
My chalice, mortal man
I'll curse your soul eternally
Humanity be damned

I will taste your lifeâ¦
I will curse your soul
I will taste your lifeâ¦
I will curse your soul

When shadows fall upon you
The cursed souls take flight
We prey upon the living
The undead of night

I drink this life you've given me
My chalice, mortal man
I'll curse your soul eternally
Humanity be damned

I'll drink this life you've given me
My chalice, mortal man
I'll curse your soul eternally
Humanity be damned
