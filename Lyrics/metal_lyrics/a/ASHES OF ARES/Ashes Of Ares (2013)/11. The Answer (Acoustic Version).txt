[Bonus Track]Time can be a friend
But her grains of sand are slipping through your hands
Let every time I can see it in your face
You're holding on for the ones your heart embraced
Fly away
Fly away
And find the answer

Life will never be the same
What you've given us forever will remain
In your heart are many splendid things
Just ask the question
You'll hear it answering
Fly away
Fly away
And find the answer

[SOLO]

Life begins again
Though your time with us is coming to an end
Journey on I will see you soon my friend
Amidst pain your spirit shall ascend
Fly away
Fly away
Fly away
Yeah, yeah!
Fly away
And find the answer
