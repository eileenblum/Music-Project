The veiled enslavers of this world have got you in their grasp
They'll think you're easy prey, until they're called to task
Treachery to God and man, deceivers never cease
To bend your will for their ends,
Their powerâ¦ your disease
(Your disease)

Entrenched in battle since it all began, insanity
To what end.. What's it forâ¦ is it hateâ¦ or is it greed?
Time will come to break these chains and move into the light
Before that time, we must awake and stand for what is right

All rise, children of earth, freedom calls your name
If we're to survive, and turn the bloody tide
We've got to move the chains

Time will tell if we can win this war on true deceit
If ever was a time to fear, you must believe
Time will come to break these chains and move into the light
Before that time, we must awake and stand for what is right
We've got to move the chains

Time will come to break these chains and move into the light
Before that time, we must awake and stand for what is right
All rise, children of earth, freedom calls your name
If we're to survive, and turn the bloody tide
We've got to move the chains

All rise, children of earth, freedom calls your name
If we're to survive, and turn the bloody tide
We've got to move the chains
