All who stand before me now
Believe in what I say
I'm the one to which you owe
Each and every day

I'm a modern demi-god
Cult of personality
If you're not dead, I'm in your head
I am the one-eyed king

I am the one-eyed king
I'm creating everything
All you know, all you believe
Won't exist without me
The one-eyed king
(The one-eyed king)

Blind, blind you're all blind
Swimming in my pool of lies
I control all that you know
And never dared deny
Black is whiteâ¦ right is wrong
The devil sings an angel's song
Whispered sweet into your ear
Mine to love, yours to fear

I am the one-eyed king
I'm creating everything
All you know, all you believe
Won't exist without me
I am the one-eyed king
I'm creating everything
All you know
All you believe
Won't exist without me
The one-eyed king
(The one-eyed king)
