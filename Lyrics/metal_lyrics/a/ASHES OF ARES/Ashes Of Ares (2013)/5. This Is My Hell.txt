As I travel down this lonely road
So many signs I should have seen
Paths I've chosen never rise to meet
The man I should have been

As I sit here huddled in the dark
A sullen face tattered clothes
Thoughts of you struggle to keep me warm
In this night so bitter cold

Devastated, all alone
Of my sins I can't atone
Self-imposed
This is my hell
(I want you to release me)
Forgotten soul some twenty years
A vivid memory of your tears
Let me go
This is my hell
(I want you to release me)

Can't control my inner rage
Now I'm damned to live that day
For all time
This is my hell
(I want you to release me)
I'd trade my soul for what I've done
I swear to Father and to Son
You were my world
This is my hell
(I want you to release me)

I can see the tears
Falling from your eyes
I can see the light
Growing dimmer as I die

Over and over in my mind
I've come to you so many times
And asked forgiveness
For your hell
(I want you to release me)
Please forgive this awful thing
So I can hear death's angels sing
You were my world
This is my hell
(I want you to release me)

I can see the tears
Falling from your eyes
I can see the light
Growing dimmer as I die

I can see the tears
(I can see your pain)
Falling from your eyes
I can see the light
Growing dimmer as I die
