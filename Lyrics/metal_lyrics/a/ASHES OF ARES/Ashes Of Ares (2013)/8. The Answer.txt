Time can be a friend
But her grains of sand are slipping through your hands
Every time I can see it in your face
You're holding on for the ones your heart embraced
Fly away
Fly away
And find the answer

Life will never be the same
What you've given us forever will remain
In your heart a many splendored thing
Just ask the questionâ¦ you'll hear it answering

Fly away
Fly away
And find the answer

Life begins again
Though your time with us is coming to an end
Journey on, I will see you soon my friend
Beyond this plane your spirit shall ascend

Fly away
(Oh fly away)
Fly away
(And find the answer)
Fly away
(Fly away yeah yeah)
Fly away
And find the answer
