My brother died today
It's going on three years
I think of him every day
Fought back a lot of tears
Well you could say he's a good man
But you would understate
The impact of one man's life
And his eternal fate

I know my brother isn't gone
(I know he isn't gone)

The devil came and took his life
But his soul remained
Waiting on St. Michael's hand
So he could lead the way
The archangel said
"Come with me my brother"
And with God's touch
He granted him
Wings of a warrior

I know my brother isn't gone
(I know he isn't gone)
And still his spirit carries on
(It carries on)
And by his light he found a way
(He found a way)
He battles evil still today
On the wings
On the wings
On the wings of a warrior
On the wings of a warrior

Now he charges into battle
With the sword of kings
Trampling the fallen
As the herald angels sing
Vengeance flies from heaven
On warrior's wings

I know my brother isn't gone
(I know he isn't gone)
And still his spirit carries on
(It carries on)
On the wings
On the wings
On the wings of a warrior
On the wings of a warrior
On the wings of a warrior
A warrior

My brother died today
It's going on three years
