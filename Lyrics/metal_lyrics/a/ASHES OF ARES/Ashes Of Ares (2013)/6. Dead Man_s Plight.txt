Come closer
To me now
And put your faith in me
You will not
Deny me
You know
I'm your creator

Can you feel me now?
(Can you feel me now?)
I will ease your pain
Can you see me now?
(Can you see me now?)
In darkness
I'm the flame

Forsaken
Unforgiven
God won't have you
Look to the morning light
Damnation
Devastation
I am
The dead man's plight

Can you hear me now?
(Can you hear me now?)
Your life was profane
Can you feel me now?
(Can you feel me now?)
You're burning in my flame

Your future's written by your own hand
The well is filled with uncertainty
The choice is your now
To tip the balance
of light or darkness
Eternaly

As my life
Fades away
For one moment I
Start to pray
Please forgive me
I've gone astray
Shine your light as I
Fade away

[Solo]

Can you feel me now?
(Can you feel me now?)
I Will ease your pain
Can you see me now?
(Can you see me now?)
In darkness
I'm the flame

our future's written by your own pen
The well is filled with uncertainty
The choice is your now
To tip the balance
of light or darkness
Eternaly
