They took away all that I am
From this dark place there can be no return
As I become master of my own destiny
I will make right injustice
Protect the innocent
...And punish the wicked

I want you to know right now
You're one step from the edge
Something inside keeps telling me
You're not long for this world
Take some time to think about everyone
That you have harmed in your life
I will take their pain away
When I bring your punishment

Ask not why your time's in jeopardy
Of coming to an end
Your life has been blasphemy
Destruction's all you know
For this I will bring the hammer down
Judgment has been made
I will wash your sins away
When I bring your punishment

For the innocent
I have risen
Time won't heal all wound
So punishment will be given

This is the path I've chosen
It blocks the pain of failure I feel
Losing you is killing me
But I will not go without a fight

For the innocent
I have risen
Time won't heal all wound
So punishment will be given

For the innocent
(For the innocent)
I have risen
(I have risen)
Time won't heal all wound
(Time won't heal all wound)
So punishment will be given
(So punishment will be given)
