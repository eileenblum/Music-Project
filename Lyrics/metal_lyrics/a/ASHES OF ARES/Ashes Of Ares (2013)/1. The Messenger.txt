Traveling by word of the wise
This ancient story arrived
A messenger sent from far and wide
Upon the raging beast he rides
He rides
Ride

Upon the death of mortal man
The messenger journeys across the land
Clutching the unknown in his hand
Bestowing the mystery of God's plan
Upon his death an old man finds
That life and death
Are intertwined
The question that once was denied
Is answered now, in this afterlife

Every man controls his state
The extent to which he seals his fate
The messenger brings to his prey
The creator's will that final day
Of good or evil, there are none denied
The right to pass to the other side
But in this life, if evil aligned
To hell the messenger will ride
Riding from the other side
Upon your death he will decide
Heaven or hellâ¦ which is deserved?
Hear the word from the messenger

Riding from the other side
Upon your death he will decide
Heaven or hellâ¦ which is deserved?
Hear the word from the messenger
Riding from the other side
Upon your death he will decide
Heaven or hellâ¦ which is deserved?
Hear the word from the messenger
