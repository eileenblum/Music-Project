[Music: Antalgia / lyrics: Igna Jover]

He was hoping for a better world.
He never felt so alone.
Where did I make my mistake? He said.
Through the years he walked looking for a dream that passed him by
And he left the valley of broken dreams.

Always thought that he was just a strange.
Grow a little stronger, trying to prevent the wounds of soul.
Always brought along the hope and joy.
Every night he looked up for her eyes.

Feel I'm bound to your memory and cry.
I try to scream for your God to get and answer and write my own story.

Waiting for the night I'll meet you again.
The only way to escape from reality lives in our best dreams.
Searching for the shadows of a sweet melody I've found my wings to fly away from pain.

Feel I'm bound to your memory and cry.
I try to scream for your God to get and answer and see my story from a different side.

I swear I'll never let you go again.
Riding in the night.
Maybe I'm going mad.
Fragile like a rose and stronger than a storm.
No words to explain what love can realize.

Feel I'm bound to your memory and cry.
I try to scream for your God to get and answer and write my own story.
