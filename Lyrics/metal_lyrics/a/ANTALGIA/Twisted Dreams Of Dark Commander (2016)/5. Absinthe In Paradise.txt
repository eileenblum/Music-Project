[Music: Antalgia / lyrics: Igna Jover, Bella Dianez]

Breathing the air.
Breaking my mind.
Tryin' my best.
Rising the past through your eyes.
Connecting the future to believe.
I see your sober face appearing through my dreams.
Among the memories, I repair an old story that I left behind.

Give me a sign to start making sense to my reasons before I leave and see the consequences.
Let me sing that last song for you.
Will erase my fears and will show me the way to relieve my unbearable pain.
Absinthe in paradise.

Save a place for me in heaven before I forget what I once was.
Sulphur in the thick air.
The rain dissolves my thoughts.
Paint a place for me.
I need to feel my enemies disappear.
Sulphur in the arid land.
Failed bullets bleed my wish and will.

Forgive the day I erased your name.
Don't make the same mistake again.
My soul remains tied to your life blinded by the light of dawn.

On the edge of sacrifice.
Looking where my demons hide.
From the ashes comes the sign.
The murmur of a distant song.

Now I see your face appearing through my dreams.
Among the memories, I repair an old story I left behind.

Save a place for me in heaven before I forget what I once was.
Sulphur in the thick air.
The rain dissolves my thoughts.
Paint a place for me.
I need to feel my enemies disappear.
Sulphur in the arid land.
Failed bullets bleed my wish and will.
Save a place for me in heaven before I forget what I once was.
Sulphur in the thick air.
The rain dissolves my thoughts.
Make way for the darkness.
Remove my blinds.
Make me understand we're not alone.
Absinthe in Paradise
I'll try to touch my face through the mirror and break the lies reflected about me.
