[Music: Antalgia / lyrics: Igna Jover]

Call your dark angels when rage begins to hide your tears.
Clear the shadows and smoke from your eyes.
Try to escape the nightmare that moves you in twisted circles.
Bring to life the seed that burns me inside.
Go!

I cried before gods condemned the world that reigns over me.
I walked believing the dreams they promised me.
I've tried to stay away from the words that line the shadows.
I walked with you through ashes of forgotten empire.

Feel I am fighting a losing battle.
Running through the fields of the fallen and wounded souls.
Bring back what is yours, what you have seen.
I'll show you more. Beyond that you perceive.
Believe in me now and let your soul unleash.
Embrace the storm.

This feeling has swallowed me whole.
Freeing the blind from dependency.
I feel pain crashing over my head like the waves of an angry sea by storm's surge.
Enslaved by weekdays of grief, now my eyes can see a new dawn.
Finding out what all of this means, I'll never be scared again.

Feel I am fighting a losing battle.
Running through the fields of the fallen and wounded souls.
Bring back what is yours, what you have seen.
I'll show you more. Beyond that you perceive.
Believe in me now and let your soul unleash.
Embrace the storm.

I wish I could understand this masterplan of bitterness that consumes us.
Did the storm has taken its toll of our bodies and twisted minds?
The howl of the wind is telling me beware of traps that I will have to face.
I'll try not to let this story gulps my faith in the ones I trust to stick it out.

Feel I am fighting a losing battle.
Running through the fields of the fallen and wounded souls.
Bring back what is yours, what you have seen.
I'll show you more. Beyond that you perceive.
Believe in me now and let your soul unleash.
Embrace the storm.
