[Music: Antalgia / lyrics: Igna Jover]

I saw in my dreams the archangels calling the escape from false wonderland.
When the time comes I will be prepared to face the hate of those who hide their sins.
Trying to understand behind these bars...

Twisted dreams of dark commander hide the truth from staves of time.
Stumbling through the complex labyrinth created by fear.

Now, the lights fade slowly away and dreams start dancing.
Thoughts will fall back in to the ground.
Conscience meets my soul.

Sleeping close to the edge don't wanna fall again into a sea of beautiful nightmares.
Closing my eyes to the cursed visions that have shaped this orphaned land of love and peace.

Archangels call the escape from false wonderland.
When the time comes I'll be prepared to face the hate.
Secrets are revealed.
United hopes to connect our fates.
I finally understood what is meant by the ancient staves of time.

Tonight's final serenade to awaken the dormant minds that has been slaved for years.
Hopeful eyes are dreaming in the void of mirrors that reflect the light of soul.
Forget how it came to be.
The world could not be housed in the pictures created by the shadows.
Think before you speak and plead because tears will not erase your scars.

Archangels call the escape from false wonderland.
When the time comes I'll be prepared to face the hate.
Secrets are revealed.
United hopes to connect our fates.
I finally understood what is meant by the ancient staves of time.

Scan your mind.
Draw the line.
Walk with me.
I'm not afraid.
Gasping for breath.
Scared you'll see life has new meaning.

Archangels call the escape from false wonderland.
When the time comes I'll be prepared to face the hate.
Secrets are revealed.
United hopes to connect our fates.
I finally understood what is meant by the ancient staves of time.
