[Music: Antalgia / lyrics: Igna Jover:]

[Lord of Shadows:]
Welcome to the dark side.
Inner demons have come out to play.
The nightmares have begun.
Appoint you Commander of Souls.
You must feed upon them.
Life will be the game of the great lie.
Call your minions to share the wine.

[Dark Commander:]
I'm ready to rule this world on fire.
Chaos will be my claw.

[Warrior of Light:]
Cast down to hell, one day I'll face your fury.
I saw your blame game and don't want to live your reality.
Be sure, I'll call my troops and we'll fight for our freedom.
I know it's in my hands.
I will let the light persuade your hate.

[Dark Commander:]
Invasion of your minds.
Inventing past for your present.
Corruption is the norm.
I made the kingdom of my will.

[Warrior of Light:]
Chained to the world of shadows laws carved in the stone.
United reign of the kings.

[Dark Commander:]
I'm ready to rule this world on fire.
Chaos will be my claw.

[Warrior of Light:]
Cast down to hell, one day I'll face your fury.
I saw your blame game and don't want to live your reality.
Be sure, I'll call my troops and we'll fight for our freedom.
I know it's in my hands. I will let the light persuade you.

Climbing the wall.
Searching for the answer.
I must rise and find out the Temple of Light.
Drawing the weapons.
I'll come with my warriors to fight for a better world and for lasting peace in souls.

[Dark Commander:]
Dark ambition within my heart.
I'll never set you free.
Just leave a black and deep stain and your lives will be mine.
If you try to ride to meet your fate, don't forget who I am.
I am guarding Ministry of Evil.
The Dark Commander.

[Warrior of Light:]
Cast down to hell, one day I'll face your fury.
I saw your blame game and don't want to live your reality.
Be sure, I'll call my troops and we'll fight for our freedom.
I know it's in my hands.
I will let the light persuade your hate.

No matter what they send to us.
My weapons tear through shields of greed.
It's time to set the world on fire.
I'm prepared to face your lies.
