[Music: Antalgia / lyrics: Igna Jover]

The world burns the air you breathe.
Time is coming to an end.
How can you just stand there and not be moved?
Are you feeling it now?

Millions of souls rise facing the twilight.
Now we understand to become more awakened and mindful.
Endless game.
Tryin' to fill in the blanks you are missing.
The light of desires reflecting the true.

Darkness has grown from the basement of fear,
But there's no reason for you to think all is been said and done.
Master of lies no longer hides his true face behind that empty shell.

Time stops inside my head.
Games of sorrow without hidden tears.
All that you believe was made to deceive.
I cross my heart in hope to sweep the ashes as my soul lies burned playing your endless game.
How can you just stand there and not be moved?

Millions of souls rise facing the twilight.
Now we understand to become more awakened and mindful.
Endless game.
Tryin' to fill in the blanks you are missing.
The light of desires shines your way.

In my dreams, black clouds gathering the darkness.
I try to reach to the light of a new day behind lies.
Weakened by nurturing the lost souls.
I call your name seeking your eyes in the crowd.
Endless game.
