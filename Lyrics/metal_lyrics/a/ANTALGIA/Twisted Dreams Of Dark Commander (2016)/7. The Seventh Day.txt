[Music: Antalgia / lyrics: Igna Jover]

Rain
Is falling from a raging heaven of
Gods in council.
The clouds
Are gathering darkness on the edge of war.
It's time to fight back.

On the morning of the seventh day
I will ride down to the hell.

One thousand fires
Are burning the sky.
Don't' close your eyes.
The arrows of truth
Are dripping with blood
Of their greedy minds.
As you look to the stars,
Drown the fears
That are killing you.
Cross the line and don't feel blind
By their game of temptation.

Now
It's so hard to see
But they are all
Optical illusions that were done
To confuse your heart and soul.
You must open your eyes.

See,
I take part of you
And you take part of me.
Feel,
The world becoming one
We will never fight alone.

One thousand fires
Are burning the sky.
Don't' close your eyes.
The arrows of truth
Are dripping with blood
Of their greedy minds.
As you look to the stars,
Drown the fears
That are killing you.
Cross the line and don't feel blind
By their game of temptation.

The serpent rises
From depths of their souls
To poison the world with evil thoughts.
The enemy has come for you
And there's no time to run or hide.

A blind desire
To step back to the time
When I was a child.
I want break out
In tears when I
See the hate in our lives.
Finding my place.
Looking for memories
To relive in yesterdays.
I'll brake down these walls
And I will climb this cave of lights.

One thousand fires
Are burning the sky.
Don't' close your eyes.
The arrows of truth
Are dripping with blood
Of their greedy minds.
As you look to the stars,
Drown the fears
That are killing you.
Cross the line and don't feel blind
By their game of temptation.
