[Music: Antalgia / lyrics: Igna Jover]

Shadows are casting regrets on the wall.
Evil signs of the times.
Whispers tell me, what do they mean?
Lies on a place where we grown up believing the words that display the temples of sand.
Fractures of world freeing the light that captures our darkest consciousness.

One day my tears will turn into the flames and the World will burn in its wake.
Concealed by the rules, I'll reborn from the inner ashes to raze the temples of sand.

There's a place where the tales are untold.
Lies on a tense line.
Words of wisdom surround my numb mind.

Undressing my guilt.
Waiting for you to understand, I'm sorry for the words I didn't say.
My shattered soul screams for you to come.
Remember me 'cause I'm drowning alone in the dark.

One day my tears will turn into the flames and the World will burn in its wake.
Concealed by the rules, I'll reborn from the inner ashes to raze the temples of sand.
Don't have to be afraid.
You will shine 'cause I see the light in your eyes.
Think for yourself.
You know what you want.
Everything will be alright.
Rise and find your way to be free.
Raze the temples of sand.
