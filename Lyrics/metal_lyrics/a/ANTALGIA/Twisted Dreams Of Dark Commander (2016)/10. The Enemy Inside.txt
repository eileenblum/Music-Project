[Music: Antalgia / lyrics: Igna Jover]

A clear sound rings in the air.
The ground trembles under my feet.
Ravens fly over the land.
They are waiting for death to set in.
Dark skies above us.
Darkness surrounds the soul's light again.
Day is here. Live with no fear.
The swords shine with white flames of wrath.

Clouds ablaze the horizon.
It's time to spread your wings and fly.

Damned domains where the greed and corruption collide.
Dark will come to everyone.
Soon the dusk will embrace our souls.
Is there a way to escape? I just tell you...

Stop crying all night long.
The day rises again.
So take a breath of change and run your rage without regrets that weaken your weapons.
Be brave and fight for your dreams.
Show the teeth to your fears.

Time to seal all the preachers' fate.
How I smile when I heard the tale.
I've unleashed the warrior within to make way from your lies.
It is time to make me stand.
Now I face this fight alone.
I'll relive the fallen soldiers of lost battles.
After thousand nights no longer tears in my eyes.
I'll ride to meet my destiny.
No one can beat me now.

Stop crying all night long.
The day rises again.
So take a breath of change.
And run your rage without regrets that weaken your weapons.
Be brave and fight for your dreams.
Show the teeth to your fears.

Standing firm against The Enemy Inside, the Endless Game is now coming to an end.
Absinthe In Paradise.
Will erase my fears will show me the way to relieve my unbearable pain.
On the morning of The Seventh Day I will ride down to hell to Embrace the Storm.
I get the Staves Of Time to raise the Temples Of Sand.
I was hoping for a better world and I left The Valley Of Broken Dreams.
Now When The Lights Go Down I'm not afraid anymore.
I'm The Dark Commander.
