[Music - Antalgia / Lyrics - Bella Dianez]

Before you jump
Look inside yourself
See the lines of life 
Youâre about to abandon
Donât look back
It will hurt
Eliminate your past
Life is waiting, let me in before youâ¦

Run away
Look deep down
Analyze yourself
And there youâll find me

Destiny embraces you as if it were me
And me in silence always close to you
âCause Iâm not able to tell you the truth
I love you in silence, I love you in silence

You must wish 
And it will be
One more minute 
And the rain will cleanse
All corners of heart 
Where we used to
Hide from the world 
You and I alone

Donât close the door
Iâll be left out
Enable to save you
And all become to end

Destiny embraces you as if it were me
And me in silence always close to you
âCause Iâm not able to tell you the truth
I love you in silence, I love you in silence

You will the find the key
Donât doubt your strength
I will be watching
In case you stumble
To lift you, to care for you,
To make your dreams come true
You know how to succee
