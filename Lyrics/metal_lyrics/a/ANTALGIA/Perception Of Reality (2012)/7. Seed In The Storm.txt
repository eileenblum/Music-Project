[Music - Antalgia / Lyrics - Bella Dianez]

Hey! Open your eyes
Don't let time fly
Now! Live your life as its your reality
Wake up! Let no-one tell you your dreams
You are the seed in the storm

Why are you so frail?
Being like crystal is no help
Bring out the strength inside you
And be free

If you only see the superficial,
youÂ´ll see the horizon
If you dare to look further,
you'll find the universe
You have the spark to make magic
Clear your doubts and 
You will hear my voice
A melody for brave hearts

Throw your fears into the fire
Clear your hope in this new way
Let the energy flow and you will see
You are the seed in the storm

Come on! Take my hand
Nobody will be happy for you
Shout! To eliminate your fears
Open your eyes to this new reality

If you only see the superficial,
youÂ´ll see the horizon
If you dare to look further,
you'll find the universe
You have the spark to make magic
Clear your doubts and 
You will hear my voice
A melody for brave hearts

Time flies and doesn't return
The world won't stop for you
So follow the sunlight
And it'll take you away
The flame will light if you wish
But no one will do it for you
â¦do it for you
