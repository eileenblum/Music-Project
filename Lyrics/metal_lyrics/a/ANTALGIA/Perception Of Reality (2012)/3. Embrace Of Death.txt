[Music - Antalgia / Lyrics - Albert Gasen]

Day by day, I'm betraying my soul
Everything is on the brightness of your eyes
â¨When she disappears, I can only lie

Now that you're in my world,
I feel I'm loosing this fight
I canât get back my breath, 
I just wanna die

In the darkness feel the dance of eternity 
Falling into the cruel and merciless 
Embrace of Death

An ethereal figure is standing before meâ¨
She said me quietly: Don't be afraid
A sense of horror busted me
â¨She took my hand and I saw her face

Running away from you 
'cause I know who you are 
Singing a sweet lullaby
I don't wanna die

In the darkness feel the dance of eternity 
Falling into the cruel and merciless 
Embrace of Death

I'm drowned in this dream 
Within the shadows of my soul
Please take me over through darkness in paradise
I'm drowned in this world 
Within the voids of my thoughts
Donât call my name âcause Iâm not ready for this trip

Taking me to the end âcause I stopped carrying
And the darkness turned to pain

In the darkness feel the dance of eternity 
Falling into the cruel and merciless 
Embrace of Death
Dancing with the death 
I felt I was in a trance 
There Ìs not a prayer to avoid the embrace of Death.
