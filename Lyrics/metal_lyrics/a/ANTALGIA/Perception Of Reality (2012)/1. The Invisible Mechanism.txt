[Music - Antalgia / Lyrics - Bella Dianez]

Distil and uncork
The essence of each sensation
Is the action of turning to the past
Chain the movement
Just one touch
Causes the wheel to stop

Pausing time
With my hands
But if I decide
To open my eyes

The light enhances your figure
And I will see you surrounded
By the starlight
In the middle of the scenery
Hidden from my eyes
This place sets in motion

The invisible mechanism
Which spins everything
The power of your voice

Comes at daybreak
And I see your warm hand
Reaching my face
Untying the knot
From this darkness
Wich keeps me blind
Your figure
In the brightness shows
The color of my dreams
Two peaces
Of the same gearing
Which finally turn in time

"You vibrate my consciousness  
Inviting my awake
Preparing me to see the light
Which envelops all"

The invisible mechanism
Which spins everything
The power of your voice

Comes at daybreak
And I see your warm hand
Reaching my face
Untying the knot
From this darkness
Wich keeps me blind
Your figure
In the brightness shows
The color of my dreams
Two peaces
Of the same gearing
Which finally turn in tim
