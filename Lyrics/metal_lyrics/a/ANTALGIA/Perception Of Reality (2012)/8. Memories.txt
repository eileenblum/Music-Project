[Music - Antalgia / Lyrics - Igna Jover]

Every time everything seems to go well
The cold rain reminds you
That all is frail like a dry leaf
So many hopes deposited
So many moments encaged
She who saw my birth
Must now be me goodbye

Like water that runs free
Must free my soul
Within this lake of pain
There are so manyâ¦

Memories inside my heart
So hard to leave you
Memories engraved in my mind
I need to findâ¦

Time to chance has arrived to
Overcome this new situation
It's hopeless to regret
Don't waist time and return to your past

When I feel the daylight fall
Nothing can't scape my return
To the moment 
When everything disappear
I'm in need of energy
But I must go on
And I like to smile again
But there are so manyâ¦

Memories inside my heart
So hard to leave you
Memories engraved in my mind
I must carry on
Cause I'd like to smile again

Time to chance has arrived to
Overcome this new situation
It's hopeless to regret
Don't waist time and return to your past

Shout! Until you know
How to difficult it is to forget
What I fought for
Break! The chains that keep me
Tied to the past
Freeing my sad soul

Time to chance has arrived to
Overcome this new situation
It's hopeless to regret
Don't waist time and return to your past

Today I felt your kiss upon my soul
Your memory tinges my new life
With colors of joy
Tears of fire
I will be happy again
You'll always been
In my memor
