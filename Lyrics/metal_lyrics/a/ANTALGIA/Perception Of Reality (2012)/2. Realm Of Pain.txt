[Music - Antalgia / Lyrics - Bella Dianez]

Let me see,â¨that dark hidden place under your soft skin
Answer me,â¨your silence is like crystals cutting my feet
Forgive me,â¨for trying to get another chance to born again
Understand me,â¨when my heartbeat hist my mind I break down

Build a wall which hides the truth from the world
I am a victim of your ambiguity

You were cruelâ¨'cause you play with fire with no fear of burning me
Leave the embersâ¨In the middle of the ice to disappear
Forgive me,
For trying to get another chance to born again

Build a wall which hides the truth from the world
I am a victim of your ambiguity

In the realm of pain
Where lives your voice
The memory blurs,â¨I lose my mindâ¨I cannot escape from you,
Trapped without reason
Your image tears through the seasons

See further than theatre of dreams
I am a slave in timeâ¨It was your fear against reality
Which led you away from me

In the gulf of loneliness
Shadows will fade
A reality I don't wish to feel
And at the end of the tunnelâ¨I see a blinding light
Which approaches and surrounds me

Crossing the thresholdâ¨I need to scape from your ethereal and deep trail
Leaving the spiral
That shatter my fortress of illusions

In the realm of pain
Where lives your voice
The memory blurs,â¨I lose my mindâ¨I cannot escape from you,
Trapped without reason
Your image tears through the seasons
I can still raise and see
How the door of hope opens
Showing me a new light of day
