[Music - Antalgia / Lyrics - Bella Dianez]

Under my disguise
Hidden to world
Years of loneliness
The trail of the comet
Is still alive although
It extinguished years ago
My broken wings
With no more strength
Won't let me fly
Now under the rain
I fall on my knees
I'll die if you leave

Don't let the eco of our laughs die
The feeling weakens
And all my memories are fading out like
Dust in the...

An uncontrollable line of
Silence and disagreement
I would like to eliminate
Without thinking I beg
You cure my pain
Which still can be erased
Ignore this dream
Which you are taking has a game
Let me resurrect
Let our destiny be
Witness and judge of words
I should never have said

Don't let the eco of our laughs die
The feeling weakens
And all my memories are fading out like
Dust in the wind

Being converted in
Statue of salt
Can be avoided
As I turn around
Wishing on your arrival

Don't let the eco
Of our laughs die
The feeling weakens

Don't let the eco of our laughs die
The feeling weakens
And all my memories are fading out like
Dust in the wind
I want to believe
Show me I have motives to wait for you
