[Music - Antalgia / Lyrics - Igna Jover]

The dawn of a new age
Is approaching to establish a global
Vision of all things
Leaders meet
Behind armed guards, feel they must
Rule the world

They are the owners of all
The horses in the race
So the events that happen by accident,
Actually theyâve been planned

In The Council of Darkness
Raised by the cream of society
Oaths are signed in blood
The black hand acquires more strength
And the empire becomes more aggressive
Feel they must save us

They are creating the utopia
Directing the world matters
Countries will be something of the past
A planet like a prison

Donât let the brightness of
Your future depends on their decisions
Open your eyes and fight
You need to change your mind
To see the control tower where the masters are
Donât look for heroes there
The only truth is the one you create
Must fight for it
You need to wake up now
so you can scape from this nightmare

I'm calling to you
The things we believed are no longer true
Donât be afraid
Of wanting changes in your life
Shadows will fade some day
Don't blindfold your eyes
Itâs all in yourself
You are the master of your destiny

Donât let the brightness of
Your future depends on their decisions
Open your eyes and fight
You need to change your mind
To see the control tower where the masters are
Donât look for heroes there
The only truth is the one you create
Must fight for it
You need to wake up now
so you can scape from this nightmar
