No need
To talk
You cut me off and pull away
The heat is freezing again
It tears out my heart

Disguise
Pretend
Break down the whole fantasy
The distance remains, everlasting
It leaves me wondering

Why do you change this fast
It's not fair

Feel again
That's what we've missed
The whole time
Misplaced love remains, everlasting
It leaves me wondering

Why do you change this fast

It's not fair
