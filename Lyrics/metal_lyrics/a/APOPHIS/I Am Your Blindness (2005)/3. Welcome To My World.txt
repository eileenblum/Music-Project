Close your eyes, your gates
Between the real world and my realm
Between day and night and endless darkness
An intermediate world of life and death
Close your eyes, your gates
Between the real world and my realm

No sun illuminating the day
And lighting up the moon at night
Darkness until death rips your soul from your body
In a world of life and death
Welcome to my world
Welcome to my world, step in

I am the guardian of eternal darkness
The dark light leading you
I am your eye and you will see
Things of no importance in the real world
I am the guardian of endless gloom
The dark light leading you

Your life won't be the same anymore
Your senses will sharpen to a point for you
In a world of life and death
To hear blood flowing
And scent fear and pain

I am the guardian of eternal darkness
I am your coma and your blindness
I rule your life, I rule your life unto death
I'll keep your eyes closed, your eyes closed forever

I am the guardian of eternal darkness
The dark light leading you
I am your eye and you will see
Things of no importance in the real world
Welcome to my world
Welcome to your new life
