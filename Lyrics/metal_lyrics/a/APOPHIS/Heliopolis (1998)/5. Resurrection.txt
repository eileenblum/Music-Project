Walking slowly through the valley of rest
Seemingly unnoticed by the powers of life
To identify the meaning of my dreams.
The rocks in the shades are witnesses
Of my remaining depressingly
As I kept on going just to stop at a well.

Entering the well I felt like Christ
At his descent down to hell.

Observed by creatures while intruding their realm
With my soul burning and my mind confused
I went on in this maze of darkness
Driven onward by powers unseen

The impending nearness of the Prince of Death
I passed the broken well of my dreams.
Reimparting strength into my inmost self,
And Accepting dreams as a means of resistance.

Entering the well I felt like Christ
At his descent down to hell.
