In valleys of inconcrete spirituality,
In places consecrated to the Snake,
In the region of the sun and beasts of prey
There arises a new god.
Like Phoenix from the ashes he raises out of ruins,
Strengthened by endless sorrows inflicted upon him.
In new, re-established power transferred to him by his new figure,
He lives, our rejuvenated Serpent God.

The ages of the sun and fire, of light and joy are gone.
APOPHIS founds his realm of Darkness
In the middle of the world of light.

In his hands the signs of power and of immortality,
His body is strongly erected upon his feet.
Covered with a coat of evil craft
The cause of former weakness is shaken off.

Join this sombre world
It is right beyond your reason.
Ordinary man, behold,
See APOPHIS arise.

He fights the Gods of the Sun in their own realm
To found the force of blood, death and darkness.

Aspis, Basilisk, Illuyanka, Midgards-Ormr,
Kaikai-filu, Ruye, Kaliya, arise!
Leave your reason, go beyond,
Enlighten yourself in Darkness.
