In the origin of time
The soul of darkness was banned into
The depths of the dark
Its evil was separated from the light of humanity
To raise up into times of weakness and despair,
And cover earth with fire and blood.

Choirs of bitterness attend the hordes of darkness.
By their storm through the crimson heaven.

Screams tear the silence of the night.
Blood is burning in flames of destruction.
Dead flowers become black candles,
Burning in eternal beauty.

Buried in spheres beyond all imagination,
The children of the sun will never see the sun again.
Like nightshadows they march their way.
Buried in the eternal depths of darkness,
In the naked winds of seas they cry -
Never heard... In sorrow united.
