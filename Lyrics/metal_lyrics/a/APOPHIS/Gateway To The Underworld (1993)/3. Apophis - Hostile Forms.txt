At sunset shortly before the entry
into the dark gates of the underworld,
and shortly after the exit after sunrise
a demon of darkness raises out of his gloom.

He resists the barque of sunlight
to prevent the sun god from his daily ramble.
A warrior combats him;
the blood of the snake dyes the heaven blood red.

We are told he was dismembered -
in temples they celebrated ritually [2x]

The story's about the struggle of the lightstars.
The enemy is the power of darkness:
a materialization of hostile forms
results in the snake Apophis.
A dark tool of evil in his whole aggression
and his malice to be unleashed.

The struggle among these two powers
results in the equilibrium of the universe [2x]

Dry up the river,
struggle with God!
(You) can't prevent the rise and fall of the sun.
Light leaves, light comes, but without your help!
Light leaves your eyes, silence surrounds you -
mind has ceased, life disappears.
