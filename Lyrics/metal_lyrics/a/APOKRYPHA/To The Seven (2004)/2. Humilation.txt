Disappointing anti-climax
Everybody sees somebody fall
Manipulated feelings
Egoism denies the

Soul - The divine allways proves you
Soul - And you are allways behind the seat
At once full tragedy

Soul - The divine allways proves you
Soul - And you are allways behind the seat
At once full tragedy
Humiliation was complete

Build for their last day
No more hunting
No more stunning
Humiliation now is comming

One looks, others fall

Soul - The divine allways proves you
Soul - And you are allways behind the seat
At once full tragedy
Humiliation was complete

Counciousness wins

Even think about
Unfolded, lost direction,
No more north, nor even south

I had no weapons worn
I had no power left, tied and down
Denied - and there was
No essence on the other side

The second chance
Was the most important rope
The creatures use it
To hang the half of their hope
