Dread and darkness of mind
Mortals gripped by fear
This is the new denunciation

This could be a revelation
Is a capital crime to mourn for
A victim of mind into a rough form

Your preperation has been completed
Noble hearts sympathize with it
Nothing will influence to be pledged
Dwell upon it

The course on that we stand
Speak to one another
Change the course or delay in it
Stand or be killed don't bother

Noctifer

No life can possibly be saved
And many lives must inevitably be sacrified
Noctifer created - haunted by fear

No accident results out of this
Creation resist
