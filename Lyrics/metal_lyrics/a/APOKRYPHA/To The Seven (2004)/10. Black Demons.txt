Lucky days seem to be gone
Haven't had such hard times before
Everything is just like pain
Pure existence - tormentor rules

Can't believe - I will be back again
Life reduced to react
Empty body without a soul

The realm of
Black Demons - Of sadness reign my world
Black Demons - Fear is all around
Black Demons - Can't fight against
Black Demons - Darkened my mind

Hope or just illusion
Unable to bear
Search for enemy has succeeded
At war with the past

No use to refuse
Try to fix to the point
Moments of light - quiet few

The realm of
Black demons - Of sadness reign my world
Black demons - Fear is all around
Black demons - Can't fight against them
Black demons - Supression of evidence

Every day - pure insane
Mercyless attacks
Hit by my own thoughts
Beaten by memory

Daylight shines so bright
But my night hasn't stopped
Pain even grows

Enter the realm of
Black Demons - Of sadness reign my world
Black Demons - Fear is all around
Black Demons - Can't fight against
Black Demons - Darkened my mind
