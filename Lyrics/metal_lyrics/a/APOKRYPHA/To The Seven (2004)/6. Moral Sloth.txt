History repeats itself
Nothing's truely new
What's the point of all of us
Who got this view

The earthly theories fall
Slowly one by one
It has all been said before
All has been done

No matter how much we see
Wee lose the sight
No matter how much we hear
We are never satisfied

We don't remember
All the facts of former times
Who is the member
In the future generation

They are the next - the next generation
The old ones not yet gone
No difference between
So weary and tiresome
It has all been said before
All has been done

No matter how much we see
Wee lose the sight
No matter how much we hear
We are never satisfied

We don't remember
All the facts in former times
Who is the member
In the future generation
Of those awfull crimes
