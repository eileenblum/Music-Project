Over the heads of the crowd
No eyes in the throng could have told
Every weapon that distracted ingenuity
Could discover a device of integrity

Down in depths below
These weapons there I shall throw
No matter how for how far off
The eyes in the throng couldn't move

Who let them out
Whence they have come
Where they bagun to shout
Scored at the end of the game

Against the truth I've told
Is to force a heavy stone
Out of the wrintings in the wall
These are the news from another world

Headlong, mad and dangerous
Footsteps to force their ride
To put stones aside
Pulse and heart held life to sacrifice us

Footsteps not easily blured
Again I'm stained red
Forests of naked arms
Struggled in the air

Who let them out
Whence they have come
Where they bagun to shout
Scored at the end of the game

Against the truth I've told
Is to force a heavy stone
Out of the wrintings in the wall
These are the news from another world
