A shift from ear to eye
Stronger than silence
In a world of damned alliance
A new earth under the same sky

Neurotic aftermath of this Age
Earth beneath
Highest order of abstract thinking
Speech is the medium king
Providing a new orientation for thought

Concrete statement about the world
Made up of seconds and minutes
The authority of nature isn't polluted
Eternity ceased to serve
As the measure and focus of human events

There is a wintry sky
Below us and we dwell
Everythhing is ordered
Called like a spell

Earth Beneath

A shift from ear to eye
Stronger than silence
In a world of damned alliance
A new earth under the same sky

Possession is nine-tenth of the law
Haste makes waste
First comes first served
Serious matters are to be ended

Earth Beneath
