Maltreated Land
Kings come and go
They took their sons
Made them to slaves
Bloody history!

Live-stram of a bloody torture
And the whole world watches
Cannibals and self destruction
Brainwashed to serve

Never again a civil war
We must be united
No more hunger, no more pain
Rain will wash it away

If you really want to kill yourself
Why you share it with your best friends
Your reality is so blurred
You're stepping right into hell

Beware the devil in disguise

All your senses are slaves
Can't see the tears and traps
And the wrong way will lead you to nowhere

We gonna start a mediafada
Burning the lies
Don't hurt one another
Some will die
Some satisfied
But please use it the other way!

Fuck the system and fuck you too
Leave this world behind
Nameless I'm nobody's fool

Forget what you've been taught
Go back to the start
Rethink the world order
Together not apart

Live-stram of a bloody torture
And the whole world watches
Cannibals and self destruction
Brainwashed to serve

Never again a civil war
We must be united
No more hunger, no more pain
Rain will wash it away

We all are brothers and we all are one!

If you really want to kill yourself
Why you share it with your best friends
Your reality is so black
You're stepping right into hell!

You can't trust nobody
That's the reason why we fight
In life don't trust somebody
The devil in disguise


All your senses are slaves
Can't see the tears and traps
And the wrong way will lead you to nowhere

We gonna start a mediafada
Burning the lies
Don't hurt one another
Some will die
Some satisfied
But please use it the other way!
