No more tears for those that are dying
for those that are crying
We are soldiers born to fight
for a peaceful world

So if you feel that you're in a fire
than raise your voice
keep on laughtin', keep on lovin'
We are safe in the eye of the storm

We're safe... inside.. in hell

So keep that faith that fills your heart
We're not worlds apart
one world, one hope, one chance
No one can stop the time

So the world turns right around
Salvation will be found
Brother and sisters you know
we must keep the faith
