Culture! - Forever Lost
Smells like we've been betrayed

Guilty spot in this world

Light our spirit make us strong
So we can shout out loud!

Dark shadows in the night
Teaching us we are not the same
Take our written words away
Achievements of thousands of years

You better beware
Of the day when the books will burn again
Lay down your weapons
Be part of it!

We will rewrite the books with blood
You can't control our mind, no!

Variety will never day!

Spread the message
On the walls
Enforce the opposition
We are one!

Culture! - Forever Lost
Smells like we've been betrayed
Guilty spot in this word

Words of wisdom are blazing in the flames
Our freedom gets lost today
We gotta bear the consequence
Of our ignorance

Light our spirit make us strong
So we can shout out loud

The system was born to fail
It's made of lies
Lay down your weapons
Be part of it!

We will rewrite the books with blood
You can't control our mind, no!

Variety will never day!

Spread the message
On the walls
Enforce the opposition
We are one

Of a kind!

Burn the books!
Bring back unwritten law!

Burn the books!
Bring back unwritten law!

It's just the lie living in ourselves

Now burn the books again!

Lay down your weapons
Unarmed we bring in to an end!

We will rewrite the books with blood
You can't control our mind, no!

The variety will never day!

Spread the message
On the walls
Enforce the opposition
We are one culture!
