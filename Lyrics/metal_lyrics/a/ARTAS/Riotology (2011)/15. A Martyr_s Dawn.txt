I'm lying in the snow
Cold but not dead
The last sunbeams of the day
are touching my face
The dawn has begun
The night comes for me
with her silent save wings

There's a pain not anymore for me
No barriers holding me down
I was born to fall for the greater good of man
Born with inner peace

No more of this!
Dangerous thoughts!

We the pack, mankind our name
We are the devil and you take the blame

He lies in the snow, cold and dead
We knew him, fought him but could not learn
Now we will take his legacy away
Rewriting and praying it

No more of this!
Dangerous thoughts!

We the pack, mankind our name
We are the devil and you take the blame

We the pack, mankind our name
We are the devil and you take the blame

I found peace
Here right now in the flames
with my legacy written
My quest fulfilled
I ride to the dawn of time!

We're the pack, mankind our name
We are the devil and you take the blame
