Through the ashes of fallen empires
we can see the shadows of failure
Now I'm standing here, force of destiny!
I was born to lead you out of crudity

Sometimes you lose your temper
and sometimes you lose a friend
But in the hour of darkness
your reign will be lost again

No, I'm reclaiming what is mine
Gods gave me a sign
They blessed with their mind
But i don't give a fuck
I am my own god! The golden emperor!

No sun will shine forever
Black holes in time
and no son will be born
Just another mad reign

All my forefathers made one big mistake
They demand allegiance with the iron stake
You could say my people are not free
but all they need is me
They follow me into death
Just out of true belief

Sometimes you lose your temper
and sometimes you lose a friend
But in the hour of darkness
your reign will be lost again

I'm reclaiming what is mine
Gods gave me a sign
They blessed with their mind
But i don't give a fuck
I am my own god! Forever! The golden emperor!
Forever! The golden emperor!

Rome wasn't built in a day
No King born to stay
Power is a virus, there is no hope

I watched so many kings go by
and no one was free from sin
Their kingdom's destroyed
Their kingdom's destroyed
by only one lie

I'm reclaiming what is mine
Gods gave me a sign
They blessed with their mind
But i don't give a fuck
I am my own god! Forever! The golden emperor!

No sun will shine forever
Black holes in time
and no son will be born
Just another mad reign
