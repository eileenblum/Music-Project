[Prologue]
I am watching the scene
My blood starts to sing
It's just like a dream
As walls are closing in

[Chapter 1]
I saw a mountain surrounded by light
With every step the darkness rising
Relaiming what is hers

Gently licking flames
Give birth to their lives
The path of hope
Now drowned in our cries

I won't let this happen
I won't stand and watch
So every guilty stone will crack
From this rock!

And even if every soul
Fights to the last
The grin behind the mirror hides
A mouth full of ash

I saw a mountain surrounded by light
So bright
Melting friend and foe
Good and bad all alike

As I reached the top
All innocence was lost
Wiped away by brainwashed walls
Let's break those walls

I won't let this happen
I won't stand and watch
So every guilty stone will crack
From this rock!

And even if every soul
Fights to the last
The grin behind the mirror hides
A mouth full of ash

A letter from the top of the mountain
To the rest of the world
The gates are open wide
Don't feel save no!

Floods are rushing in rushing in
We have to stick together
For the first time we build a union
Where sons are born
Equal!
Equal and free!
But what's paradise
When nobody's able to see?
