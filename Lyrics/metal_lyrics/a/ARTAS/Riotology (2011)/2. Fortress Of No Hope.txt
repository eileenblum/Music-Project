10,000 fists are rising
To break the chains of woe
Spartacus himself is watchin'
The revolution of slaves

Resistance for respect
Cause humanity is just a fake

Deep fear is their only goddamn pressure
Illusionists glorify a hidden treasure
Pretence smell the bad scent the bad scent
Pestilence, black death

Sophisticated guardians slaughtered them like pigs
Preparing them for dinner
You won't eat

The architects for evil are not always what they seem to be
Play a bloody game in the fortress of no hope

Beat the demons of time passing your way
And find the key to land of the free

The dice is cast!
I've got no more master who enslaves me!

Beat the demons of time passing your way
And find the key to land of the free

The die is cast!
I've got no master who enslaves me!

Tangles chaotic and senseless
Now who's the perpetrator?
Uniformed ordered and reversed

Everything is upside down
When the power lies in your scope
Everything is upside down in the fortress of no hope

Not the colour of your skin
Not your religious believes

Not the clan you are livin' in
Trust your values - crucify your sin!

Beat the demons of time passing your way
And find the key to land of the free

The die is cast!
I've got no more master who enslaves me!
