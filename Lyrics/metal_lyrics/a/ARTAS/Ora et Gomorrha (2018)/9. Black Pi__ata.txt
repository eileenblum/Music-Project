Ooooh yeah
You know I'd like to die so go on
Shoot me in the back and make a mother say goodbye
Uuuuh yeah
And if I like it slow
Push me to the ground, step on my neck and make me choke

Blind supremacy and evil deeds
Send their worst to hide
Send their worst to breed

They know it's hard to breathe
We all can see a Black PiÃ±ata
Ratatatata
And they think it's ok, k, k

How do you like it here
How do you like it here
How do you like it here
How do you like it here

I fucking hate it

Frighten everybody with an evil smile
Work, eat, pray, pretending to be colorblind
This land is your land and this land is mine
Criminals in action, it's getting close to closing time

Oh yeah, in the name of freedom you kill, yeah
You pray for money bless your dollar bill, yeah
To be number one get's even harder
And it's getting even harder to ignore it

So wiretap our prank calls and try to store it
You set things up and then you blow it
Sell a tank to your friend or your friend for a tank
A right to kill but no right to die
Pray for total safety but it's just a lie
Eye for an eye
A lie for a lie
Try after try
With all hope out of sight

You got stars and stripes on your shorts
Malcom X on your skateboard
NYC is on your cap
But your snap decisions are crap
A dream of peace
A face of war
Your belly is full but you still want more

They know it's hard to breathe
We all can see a Black PiÃ±ata
Ratatatata
And they think it's ok, k, k

How do you like it here
How do you like it here
How do you like it here
How do you like it here

I fucking hate it
