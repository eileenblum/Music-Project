Cuddled in our safety net
Hiding in plain sight
Still feeding of your mother's breasts
While people burn for our incompetence

Cradled educated fools
Darwin's joke
A herd of tools

You never had to fight
Never starved in agony
Afraid of death and calamity

The sweet lies you keep calling out
Finally settled in your consciousness
Skins and Gs and parasites
Paralyzed by the Feindbild

All you enemies of our prosperity
Raiding our shores of society
Approved insanity
Fear of captivity
Haunting depravity
Inhumanity is us

We are the Do-Gooders
The intellectual bigots
Grown to seek yet unable to see

We are the difference
Generation Good
Our network's wide
Our deeds are thoughts
And leave behind the bitter taste of Wormwood

The sweet lies you keep calling out
Finally settled in your consciousness

I am calling us out
Just one last rhyme
The cryptic terms you didn't get the first time
The pack is you
The devil is us

All you enemies of our prosperity
Raiding our shores of society
Approved insanity
Fear of captivity
Haunting depravity
Inhumanity is us

Your flawed spirituality haunts you in your darkest dreams
Unable to understand motives rooted in living hell

In fear you turn to old enemies
Again you are blinded by their lies

Lying to yourself that
The cloth will protect your cage
Well you're wrong like all the time

The blackness we came to see
Just shades of a darker grey
This glass dome shattered to pieces

Warriors of light
Never learned to fight
Fight
Fight
Find the Feindbild
