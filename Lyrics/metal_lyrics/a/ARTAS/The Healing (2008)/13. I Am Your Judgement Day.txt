Heaven is getting dark
The sun is going down
Fogs of anarchy
Exhaled by iron lung

Grab your word and fight for the horde
No mercy for hypocrites

Stars raining from the sky
Leaving a blanket of ash on the ground
Angels with bloody wings
Regaining power they will kill the time
Stars raining from the sky
Leaving a blanket of ash on the ground
Angels with bloody wings
Regaining power
Haunted by thoughts of war

Iâll take revenge â for the lost souls
Iâll get you all â donât hide in the shades
I hate you, break you, make your bleed
I am your judgement day

Defend the truth â all that remains
Destroy the lies â bring it to the test
Rise up before the fall
I am your judgement day

Leave behind the aeon of slavery
Retarded society I dissect your roots
Burn! Their cities down
Burn! Leaving ash on the ground
Rape their pride
Natureâs force ready to attack

For all you hypocrites
Now die

You will die! Why!
Because I am your judgement
I am your judgement day
You will die and thereâs no other way
No way, no way, no way, no way
I am your judgement
I am your judgement day

I am the storm
I am the fire that burns your cities down
This is my day
This is your death and justice is with me
I want you dead
I want you to fucking bleed for all your sins
I am the storm
I am the fire that burns your cities down

Stars raining from the sky
Leaving a blanket of ash on the ground
Angels with bloody wings
Regaining power they will kill the time
Stars raining from the sky
Leaving a blanket of ash on the ground
Angels with bloody wings
Regaining power
Haunted by thoughts of war

Iâll take revenge â for the lost souls
Iâll get you all â donât hide in the shades
I hate you, break you, make your bleed
I am your judgement day

Defend the truth â all that remains
Destroy the lies â bring it to the test
Rise up before the fall
I am your judgement day
