Who needs a reason when obeying rules?
Who needs a reason when acting like a fool?

Heâs just the right hand of the devil
So fucking blind
He can account for his actions
He executes commands

Think about your acts
Hold tight your true belief
Think and you will see
Think twice the choice is yours
Think about your acts
The choice is yours
Itâs not only the butcherâs guilt

Who needs a reason? You kill for victory
Who needs a reason for death by command
You are the devil, donât be so blind
You got no gun in your hand
Although you bring the death

Think about your acts
Hold tight your true belief
Think and you will see
Think twice the choice is yours
Think about your acts
The choice is yours
Itâs not only the butcherâs guilt

The butcherâs guilt!

Think about your acts
Hold tight your true belief
Think and you will see
Think twice the choice is yours
Think about your acts
The choice is yours
Itâs not only the butcherâs guilt
