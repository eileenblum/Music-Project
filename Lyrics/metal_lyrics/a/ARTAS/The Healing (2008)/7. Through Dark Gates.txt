Do you know a place
A grey and lonesome place
Where aspirationâs waiting
To conquer your heart

Such a place is my shelter
It aggravates me
Learn to appreciate
What evocates pain

Lessons Iâll learn them well
Lessons Iâll wipe away the tears
Lessons Iâll learn them well
Lessons I walk through hell

Send my soul on a journey
Through dark gates of sweet desperation
I call my own
Iâm willing to suffer to straighten out
Searching for the sense
In the tragedy of life

My mind is falling
Down into the abyss of fate
I am at my wits end
But I wonât drop myself

Such a place was my shelter
Now Iâm reborn
Life is full of lessons
I learned them well
Iâm breaking free

Lessons I learned them well
Lessons I wiped away the tears
Lessons I learned them well
Lessons Iâm breaking free

My mind is travelling
Through dark gates of pure solitude
I call my own
Iâm willing to suffer to realize
Searching for the sense
In the tragedy of life

I will break free!

Send my soul on a journey
Through the gates of white dignity
I call my own
Iâm willing to suffer to appreciate
Searching for the sense
In the tragedy of life
