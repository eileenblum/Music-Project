Dogs of war are haunting the human flesh
Thatâs not hell, thatâs the paradise
Adrenaline and instincts take the lead
The beast awakes

Sucking all my hate
Terminate wrath
Sucking all my hate
Terminate wrath

The bullets rip through the enemies
Terminate wrath
Dead bodies cover shattered ground
Terminate wrath

Now die you fucking coward
Iâll send you to your gods
Your bones are crushed into pieces
And now you get what you deserve

Can you hear the screams for mercy?
Sweet music in your ears
Can you smell the stench of napalm?
This is your chance to kill

In times of war death is the healing
Now feel the rage and make your stand

Bloodthirst and the lust to kill
Now surrender the beast in you
You sow the death and harvest flesh
Unchain your rage

They call me insane and murderer
I call them prey and hunt them down
Like the wolf among the sheeps
A god among men

Sucking all my hate
Terminate wrath
Sucking all my hate
Terminate wrath

The bullets rip through the enemies
Terminate wrath
Dead bodies cover shattered ground
Terminate wrath

Now die you fucking coward
Iâll send you to your gods
Your bones are crushed into pieces
And now you get what you deserve

Can you hear the screams for mercy?
Sweet music in your ears
Can you smell the stench of napalm?
This is your chance to kill

In times of war death is the healing
Now feel the rage and make your stand

Riot...

Can you hear the screams for mercy?
Sweet music in your ears
Can you smell the stench of napalm?
This is your chance to kill

In times of war death is the healing
Now feel the rage and make your stand
