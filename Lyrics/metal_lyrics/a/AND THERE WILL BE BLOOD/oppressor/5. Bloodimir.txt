Grey clouds choke the sun,
a burning rain darkens the day,
the morbid ceiling caves in forever,
a heavy storm heralds the end.
He mounts his immortal shell!
The eternal lord rises again,
Look ahead and see his countenance,
he graces our world.
Bloodimir, Lord of the weak,
oppressor of the strong!
A powerful ghost, walking through our woods.
You can sense the coming of the sovereign!
A powerful ghost, walking through our woods.
You can sense the coming of the sovereign!
ON YOUR KNEES!
He graces our world to claim your soul.
Poor peasants, gutless servants,
they will follow him without any hesitation.
His slaves plunder in his name.
Bloodimir, Lord of the weak,
his speech poisons the world!
Oppressor of the strong!
A powerful ghost, marching through our woods.
You can sense the coming of the sovereign!
A powerful ghost, marching through our woods.
You can sense the coming of the sovereign!
[Speech]
Blood and thunder, lynch your fellow men!
Do it all for bloodimir.
Would you follow him?
Would you follow the first, who conquers your hamlet?
His speech poisons the world!
