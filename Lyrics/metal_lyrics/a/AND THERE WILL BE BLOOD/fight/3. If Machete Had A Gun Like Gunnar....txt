Barney, Christmas, Yin Yang, Gunnar, Hale and Road
This is the special-force, a special team!
The heroes of every action-movie, but they are not perfect, they need a cherry on top!
I know one guy,
who could beat up 'em all!
I know one guy,
who is quick on the draw!

Machete!
Is a friend of mine!
So pay attention.
Fuck!

If Machete had a gun like Gunnar the world would not be safe.
And you would not be warned, 'cause Machete don't text. Be sure, he get's everyone!
His warning shot would of course be a little low. Your face hits the ground - his comment:"Kiss the gutter!"
Here's an advice: If Machete had a gun like Gunnar...RUN!
