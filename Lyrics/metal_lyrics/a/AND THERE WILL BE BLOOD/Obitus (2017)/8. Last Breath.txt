A massive power beneath the surface,
millions of particles waiting to erupt.
Rifts divide the land.
Disorder conquers our fertile soil,
millions of particles waiting to erupt.
Take your last breath.
Chasms cover the lands, ice age meets a meteorite shower,
Pest meets cholera,
take your last breath.

The end.
Life is visited by pest and cholera.
Extraterrestrial bacteria infest the oxygen.
No escape for mother earth's child.
Slowly we die inside.

Realisation brings paralysis.
The pathogen brings seizure.
Realisation brings paralysis.
Chasms cover the lands, ice age meets a meteorite shower,
pest meets cholera,
take your last breath.

Life is visited by pest and cholera.
Extraterrestrial bacteria infest the oxygen.
No escape for mother earth's child.

Slowly we die inside.
