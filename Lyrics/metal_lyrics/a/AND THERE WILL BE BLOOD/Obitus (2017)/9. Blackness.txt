How would you see the world through the eyes of a god?
The decay of your own breed.
A kingdom of fear.
Seed of abomination.
Vile and foolish. Disintegration.

Creation's glance lays in ashes.
Not a single ray of the divine spark slips through the pitch-black dust.
Eden wrapped in flames
and man carries the torch.
Heaven and earth will burn
and man carries the torch.

Seas of blood, shadows pervade the land.
They burst through every wall.
Hate ascends the throne.
The good eradicated centuries ago.
Hope got wrecked by man's ignorance.
Are there enough plagues
to rectify this mess? Total effacement!
Total effacement as a solution
that they've chosen on their own.
The cold of blackness swallows all of them.
The progress of disintegration
comes to an end.

They seem to long for extinction.
The world's greatest disease.
A redeeming moment comes
and man won't be remembered.
Rise and fall of a disgusting creation.
They will fall.

In the end only silence is left.
Great waves clean the shores.
No remains of a forgotten existence,
Nature is reborn.
Are there enough plagues to rectify this mess?
Total effacement!
Total effacement as a solution
That they've chosen on their own.
The cold of blackness swallows all of them.
Blackness.

Creation's glance lays in ashes.
Not a single ray of the divine spark slips through the pitch-black dust.
Eden wrapped in flames
and man carries the torch.
Heaven and earth will burn
â¦and man carries the torch.
