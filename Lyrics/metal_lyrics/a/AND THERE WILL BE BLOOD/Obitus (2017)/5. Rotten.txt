Times are changing,
actions and consequences,
white becomes black.
And home becomes a grave,
Will it feel like home tomorrow?
Times are changing, home becomes a grave.
It is our home, it is a planet,
it will be our common grave.
We call this our home,
We call this our planet,
For every fault there is a price,
you have to pay.
You have to pay the price.
High or low, the sum is what counts. High or low.
It is our home, it is a planet,
it will be our common grave.
For every fault there is a price to pay,
a price to pay.
No way out, no hideaway, no light,
âcause light turns into darkness.
Will it feel like home tomorrow?
Will we lose our home?
The planet becomes a wasteland,
a species lost in the universe.
Life turns to death.
Mankind is nothing,
mankind is rotten.
