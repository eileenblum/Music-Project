Not a single one will be spared,
three beggars come to judge,
messengers of the blackness,
coming for you.
Suicidal self-cannibalism, chaos reigns,
mankind has to die.
The human child is powerless,
hear those deafening cries.
The crow, the deer, the fox.
The three beggars known as pain,
grief and despair.
Nature is Satan's church
and health is Satan's charge.
A dark conspiracy.
You can fear, you can hear those deafening cries.
Hounding, impelling voices
raised among the forest.
A dark conspiracy,
three beggars light up the sky.
We deserve their punishment,
the devil is inside us.
Nature is Satan's church
and health is Satan's charge.
Crow, deer and fox.
Pain, grief, despair.
The crow, the deer, the fox.
Pain, grief, despair.
