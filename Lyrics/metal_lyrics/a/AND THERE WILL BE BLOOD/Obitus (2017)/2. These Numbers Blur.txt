My system fails, this organism dies.
Pillars collapse, ruins surround me.

Where is the light?
I can't see the hand before my eyes.
Dense dust swallows the colors.
A deep breath stresses my body,
No gleam of hope flashes.

Hello? Can you hear me?
Help, you've got to show me the way out.
I am lying beneath a ton of scattered
Dreams and discarded beliefs.
My system fails, this organism dies.
Pillars collapse, ruins surround me.

These numbers blur, this equation is spinning.
Blurred terms, switching coordinates.
I am falling in a black hole of numbers.
What is this? Where did it come from?
How do I solve this problem?
No solution, no approximation, I am lost.
