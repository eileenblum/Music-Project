It is time to make history,
these are the pages of misery.
It is the last chapter of a hopeless plight,
eternal we lay in an immortal night.

Let me tell you the story
of a foolish mind and its bitter end.
I'll paint the story of him and his antagonist.
They are the same, two men of the same kind.
Both men are strong and massively shaped,
Even smart and clever, you may say.
But a big flaw, an obsession with power,
set their decay. Their final decay.

It is time to make history,
these are the pages of misery.
It is the last chapter of a hopeless plight,
eternal we lay in an immortal night.

There arose a war, two befogged heads and wisdom was veiled by will.
A wise man changes his mind, a fool never will.
He will never change his mind.
But this sad story revolves around two foolish men.
They both embody the waste of a kind, so gloomy like it has never been.
