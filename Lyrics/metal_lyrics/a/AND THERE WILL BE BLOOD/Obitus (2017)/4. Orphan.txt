I believe in Alpha, but I don't know where it comes from.
Human mind is finite, we all are mortal.

I am a masterless sheep,
choosing my own grass to eat.
I am an orphan,
learned to live without a father's guiding hand.
I know there will be Omega
and I know we will be at fault.
Natural judgement, natural selection,
extinction of a mind, that has gone too far.
No shepherd. No father.

I am a masterless sheep,
choosing my own grass to eat.
I am an orphan,
learned to live without a father's guiding hand.
No Satan, no book, no shepherd.
No father, no Satan, no book.
I believe in Alpha,
but I don't know where it comes from.
Human mind is finite, we all are mortal.
