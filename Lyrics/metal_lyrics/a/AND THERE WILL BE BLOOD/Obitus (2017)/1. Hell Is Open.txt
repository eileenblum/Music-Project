A child was born in blood, Bloodislav.
Bloodislav, is he innocent?
This man is thirsting for blood.
His greed causes victims,
his appetite is insatiable.
Panic, fear, desperation,
forever governed by an outlaw.
Obedience to his words, death to his foeman.

Hell is open, a devil is near,
Innocent blood was shed,
the tyrant is here.

The land is laced with flames,
dust and ruins, oppressive silence.
The ways are covered in blood
from town to town.
Perdition sprawls, injustice reigns.
Your words he misconstrued,
Bloodislav has slaughtered you.

Hell is open, a devil is near,
Innocent blood was shed,
the tyrant is here.
