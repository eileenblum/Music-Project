Poor race, in gods believing till now
They're deepest scars, are answers adored in vain
Blank minds, proclaimed worlds illusions
Unwell philosophy
Can you realize? They rape your mind

I'm rapt, I feel your mighty presence
The winter's gates are slowly closing now
I cry, swim through relentless darkness
I have to face the fears
Lost inside your fatal choice

It's time to leave our shelters
Our puppet beliefs in a wrong purpose
Are trembling now in our cruelness

So vivid reality that he drew
A painting in blood we've been put into
The perfection we're unable to reach
Fully buried, through this vertical breach

Forever trapped in this existence
We've deserved this punishment

DEFEATED BY A VILE DAMNATION
AND REDUCED TO NOTHINGNESS

Let me heal your blindness and illusions
Be prepared to born again
Let me show'em your new path
I'll give you something to believe in
Something to fight for
