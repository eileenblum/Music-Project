One notes of rusted strings
I see myself in tears
Now the sky has been brushed
With strokes of light

I've never seen these bask winds
Past days in oriens are dying
Where icy nights have marked my taste, and memories
On endless and unknown paths
I feel the wind messing me
This cold caress under the rust, of pressing time

BENEATH THE SHADOW OF MY PAST
I SAW
PROPHETIC VISIONS
OF FUTURE

Words of regret, screams through the silence
I have no reasons to remember days gone
We're leading to, the mystic oriens
While sorrows fly away

Behind our masks
A global sick is rising
And I was drowning in it
This world is being destroyed
But I dig it from within
To find a light beyond
