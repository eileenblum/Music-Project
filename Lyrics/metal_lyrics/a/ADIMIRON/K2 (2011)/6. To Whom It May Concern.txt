Are you joking me? Fill the texture, help me to remember
They try to destroy me from within
Next in line to burn, all around is putrid and corrupted
My scream flies to whom it may concern

New sight to world, deprives its treasures, I reached the dusk inside your mind
With his tear I'm trapped in circles, they found a brand-new way to kill 'em
I've seen giants hiding timeless deeds, curtain falls on them

ANCIENT RUINS AND DUST
IS WHAT REMAINS
OF A ROTTED WORLD

Trees are now burned, planets are bleeding, sea breeze transforms into fire
Never loved child, is disappearing, growing hate for his revenge
Making devastating every dream, curtain falls on them
Ancient ruins and dust is what remains, of a fall world

We'll not respect anymore, you were addicted to war
It's too late for remorse..

It grows, along with human being, shame, common way to think
They're selling and setting a price for all, no toleration anymore

I've seen how the futile, becomes obsession
How feelings are subdued and carried inside
It's so sad to see I am the only one
Not confused, not overcome

I see how tomorrow, becomes so vivid
How men can repeat their past mistakes
We conquer worlds one by one, but we are
Still confused, still overcome

To whom - It may - Concern
