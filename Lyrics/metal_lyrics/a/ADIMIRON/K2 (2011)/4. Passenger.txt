Lapse, into this night
A flickering vision
Caresses my dreams
Silently, she grabs my hand
A fleeting enigma
Is confusing me

Once more your figure appears
Like a wounded moth
Guides me into trees
Suddenly you fall to ground
Swept away in your beyond

I can't grasp the meaning
Restless by your presence

A PALE GHOST
AROUND MY NECK
SOMEONE LOVED
RETURNED FROM BACK

Close to your blank face
I can't find your name
Passengers through life
Wait for me
i will stay with you

Ethereal stream heading toward the sky
Memories, swelling in our tired eyes
They roam eternally like being in hell
Each one, empty as a forgotten doll
