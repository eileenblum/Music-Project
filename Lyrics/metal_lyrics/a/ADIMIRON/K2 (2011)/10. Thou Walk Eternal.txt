Come in, don't be afraid, you are now
Last survivor of your race
Since the universe has been created
You're the only one I've ever met

From the farest stars, to each particle
All is ruled, all is mine
Its complexity stands above humans

I AM CHAOS AND ORDER
DARKNESS AND LIGHT

Mankind, is a consequence, of the failed
Random-generator (of) race
See beyond the shades of your path
They're the reference, the only one

Catch the weight of my words now
Devastating days in a yet detested life
Taste 'em, experience, understand 'em
Dawn for a new beginning
Before the lightning strikes

Don't be scared, your mortal frame
(Will) never be the same again
(Let) there be light
You're a part of his creation
Don't get lost
Through your endless paths
Eternal walk
