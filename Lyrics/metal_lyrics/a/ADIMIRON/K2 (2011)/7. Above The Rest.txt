Where coldest breaths caress my ears
A deadly veil of sorrow gently dances
His raging destructing white

AM I BEYOND THE THRESHOLD?
AM I LOST?

An eagle kindly shakes its wings
A mesmerizing sadness in my eyes
Wistful painting of dead trees
The feeling of a past fading away

I WALK
ABOVE THE REST
