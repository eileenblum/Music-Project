Waiting for salvation, I just speak by wind
The voice your hear, prologue of demise
Searching what's around you, I'll give you my breath

AND YOU'RE COUGHT
YOU'RE SUBDUED TO ME

Waiting for redemption, you're walking thy way
The ground you tread on, no chance for reborn
Searching what's around you, I'll give my breath
And you're cought, you're trapped inside

Holy altar of blasphemy, come and show me the way
Unknown sights, unknown expectations, a presence within
Make the choice for dark powers of life, unfolding knowledge
Seems to harmonize the paradox's spiral
To resurrect the chaos

Immersed in desolation, hidden abomination
Inflicted by a ghost disease
Between these deadly peaks, within these deadly winds
I'm caught by the whisperer

My will slowly lost its strength
By shattered voices I'm rapt
They crawl, inside my purest dreams
I cannot fight what has no shape
And their vile words corrode my mind

What is real? What is fake?
I feel his breath behind me
I hear his words
Words of war, words of darkness
I feel his breath behind me
I hear his words, they wake, they call
I've never been so close to my demise
