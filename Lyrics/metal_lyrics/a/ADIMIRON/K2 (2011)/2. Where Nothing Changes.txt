Where nothing changes I walk
Where
Everything comes true
Trip to understand my faults

Why nothing happens I guess
Why
Still life is all around
No way to keep the faith inside

Self enlightened while
My soul flies
Self deleted cry

YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
I'M WAITING FOR

Please save me
Please wake me up
Overwhelmed by doubts, by war, through lies I'm dying
I can't see, I can't feel, I can't breath my pain
Deep inside the haze of dreams your eyes are lying
I can't see, I can't feel, I can't breath your pain

No escaping
You're confined
Overwhelmed by your doubts
You'll might be able
To draw new worlds
You will drown in them
Endless ocean, filled by sand
