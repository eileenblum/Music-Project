The paradox of choose, leads everyone to lose
The main objective ahead
We are, hazed, confused, abused, disappointed
Hidden by the masks
By the fakest beliefs, we found tangled reliefs
To enslave the masses
A self-blinding veil, shrouded by cold nails of denied mountain

Sublime holder of truth, void of any ruth
An ancient sacred idiom
My hand, withstand, a brand that no one understands
Engraved on this stone
It's time to collect, what a man can expect?
From what it seems perfect
I broke these vile chains, I am no longer slave to a denied mountain

Walk through realm of tragedy conception
So there's reason to engage the revelation
Let it be and follow me
Swim through lies keep the servant's poem

Anxiety is now subdued, every visions overturned
Wraith of success starts to reveal, please grant me the evil deal
Embraced by past convictions, I'm delighted by right predictions
Long awaited evidence, the proof, the efforts essence

BUT THIS TRIP
GOES ON

In silence, I threw myself in the deadliest catch
In silence, I kept when destiny appears, unfair...
After, thousand questions you made, to a mute fate
After, the fucking laughters of who
Never trusted
Never trusted me
