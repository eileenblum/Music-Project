Feeling mesmerized and alone
I am forced to watch this
Weary eyes replace the rocks
Reality becomes a lie
Paralyzed by the view
Living a morbid nightmare

ALL MY FEARS ARE UNLEASHED
SOUL COLLAPSING INTO FLESH

One step close to overhang
Chocked by dizzy heights
Crawling pain, afraid to keep
Meaning of my thought
Everything transforms into dust
Watch sky now seems to be rust
I'm taken into another world dragged by insanity

Falling into the red condition, I die stay alive
Falling into the red condition, forsaken, undead

I'm drowning into, bleeding fears, agonizing years
Sliding into the boundless spins of deleted words
I am scared and so despaired of what's inside me
I'm shattering, weakening, my injured dreams

I forget my deadly wounds
Lying on surreal grounds
I gaze upon the empty air
Tearing out my old white hair
