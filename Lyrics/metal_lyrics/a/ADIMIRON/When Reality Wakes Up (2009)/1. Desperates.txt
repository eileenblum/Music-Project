The desperate calls near the end
The reign
Without help

Welcome to all leaded by your faults
Just crossing this bridge but no way  to turnin' back

Now listen to me 'causde soon you'll lost what we see
Endless pain and nothing of things that we need
The mistery of life is now revealed
The continous of death

Trapped inside the web of choice
Never respect
I'm feelinf stoned
There's no hope, no better day
I'm feeling wrong

Try to escape from an horde of bugs
My guilty skin surrounded by hell of flames
That world has a sense that no one can understand
It's only a continous roulette of random fatal decisions

For who are deserved to stay
In twisted prison insane
Drowing in desperate pain
Submerged in boiling mire

The souls here forever
Are judged by a method
Whih hasn't no logic
An absence of mercy
