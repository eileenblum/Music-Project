Cold and dirty is now my home
The loneliness is the only mate
Deserve to pray for a day to be
Still live it's my hope

By now I've got to stay, until a declaration
All lights I can see in the past, the only plac for me

In my head are stored those days
I've lived and killed only for me
A rejection for a style of life
In this cage there's only me
But soon I'll leave this place
People's eyees are filled up of joy
To watch poison flowing

You know the reason of the cage
New without a shame
You live or die, no matter why

Now you are blind and bleeding, agony to show
No pity here in this fuckin hell

Feeling the pain
Increasing in my body
'Till my silence and blindness
Try to recall a spot of light
That I can feel
All the things that I can see, is the dark
All the food that I can eat, are the bugs
Blame exists in this damned place

Cruelty inside the cages
Other people can lie
Still demanding their rights
My prison's end of the line
What does remain of me?
