Wake up!

Self employed suckers all around us
Never hided thanks their victims
Voluntary hunted hoping to become hunter themselves

Leech...

Don't promise: do you remind the war againstthe false
Don't promise: overflowing lies of an utopic realm
Don't promise: you know you're the cancer of the people

Leech...

Parasites grown up brainwashed by idols
False ideals to justify what them want you to do

Wake up - Raise yourself - Run before they touch you
Run before they change you (and by the way)
Stop your ears before they dominated us all

Don't promise: but you remind the war againstthe false
Don't promise: overflowing lies of an utopic realm
Don't promise: you know you're the cancer of the people
Stop promise: fuck up the blasphemic propaganda of disgusting lies

The war against the troops of avarice is a certain death
But even the body dies, the flag of sinners remains...
