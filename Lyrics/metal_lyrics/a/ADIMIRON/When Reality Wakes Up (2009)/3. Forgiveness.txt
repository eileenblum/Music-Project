Exhilhation
Remember when I lost my walls
Covered up your face and
Best of me flight away, with you

Now I'm beggin' your forgiveness
But still not see a smile
So it's true about the end
You'll never knock on my door again

All I've got is our chains
A steel that smells cold
Is the ice I keep untold
So far away I've run, so far

Tryin' to forget, this dream's maybe not
I cannot be a man with, no answers to my needs, to my needs

I dreamed of you tonight
You heading for the blue
And for each drop on my blue
A tear on your face

And just dreaming you this time
I'll take care of life
And for each drop on my blue
A tear on your face
