Nothing Changed, between the seasons of spring
'Cause every time I try and find
My way
I'm taking the way to an insanity faith
Maybe you want to be reality, this lone abomination

Forget this life and deprived, of what that I loved
The weather I see will never change, the inner pain
The inner pain

New season new skin to life
Spring has come
Still wintrt within
And another place is changing to new line
And another place to erase the older ones

Seekin' the future cause now I think, that nothing can change
Fighting the fate to extinct, my dear
Motivations, useless emotions, all the lies that mind procreates

Must trash all, thoughts in my head, that invite to lose control

When the spring has come hate has no control
All around reborn, I don't know what to do

Travelling, roaming
Without thinking destination
I only found desolation
My addicted mind destructurated me
