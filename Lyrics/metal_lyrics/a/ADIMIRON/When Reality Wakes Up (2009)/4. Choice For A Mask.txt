Like thorns around the heart
Primal istincts, that nothing can erase
A sort of glass divides us
By seein' goodness, it seems to be tortured
It's only a lie, that owns you
And nothing has been changed

This is my last fail. my last exhibition

Those moments lead
Our choice is to be
Eternal show
So many changes of role

I have replaced the lack of joy
With hate and excess
But my pride will never come down
There is pleasure for me
There is something can repay
My blood swallowed for you
That lead me to death

So wear the mask that you prefer
If you are not the prettiest, you're out!
Show the rage and strike the others
Steal all the things that are not yours
