Horrid knives and all the reeds aren0t enough to terrify my mind

There's a place where all the insanities can be found
Our lives is precious for them, whising to learn 'bout it.
All around walks on a nightmare but it still true
So similar to human shape, but it seems so unreal.

Challenge now starts up for the unknown
Forging body to create new skylines - of life.

A gown dressed man seems to play with your brain,
Like a child enjoys himself taesing with a doll.

Mind , mindoll. Terror --- and panic

Challenge now starts up for the unknown
And take ready for those
Cause everyone can live this dream
&amp; doesn't matter where do you live
They can catch you everywhere

This is called - terror
In your mind
No place is safe
Maybe you'll be the next.
