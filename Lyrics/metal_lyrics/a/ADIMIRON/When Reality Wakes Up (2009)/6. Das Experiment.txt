There is no escape to find here
I want to bring my pride
Removing remorses inside

From nullity that I was, bunkered I found myself
Private my rights
Planning to become an hero
I was playing in an experiment

Prisoners are now in row, brute controlled
Soon I'll be able to enforce, our rules
Behind bars, the only place where I live
Covered by a number, naked dignity

I can not bear, the weight of ther eyes
Alienated reality, I think only you
While I pretend thier respect
Get fists from that parody

New characters to rule, I fill right
Feeling zest of control and command

Makes me understand that I would like to extend
This desire outside these walls
Time by time mankind is controlled
Testing the status of his rage

There is no escape to find here
I want to bring my pride
Removng remorses inside
And no way to survive
I want to bring my pride
Destroying my penance aside
