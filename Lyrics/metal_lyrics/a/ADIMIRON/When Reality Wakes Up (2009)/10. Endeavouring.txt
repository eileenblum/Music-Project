In this sort of home, I lonely built a new life
Try forgetting my mistakes, now I'm living here
I don't care about my look, it doesn't matter now
Everything still remains are my damned faults

Is a choice of every night
To trash the future
When midnight

When I walk this way
I'll be sure to say
Am I forgetting will to live
For proceeding this eve
Searching for an hidden ground
For seeding my sorrows
Visualizing my desires
To finally getting free

Body in disease - Nothing to leave
The blackened I see - Mind infection
New order to obey
The things that I need - Are out of me
Married to road - Sleep everywhere
The endless travel of a man who can never die

Is a choice of every night
To trash the future
When midnight is a lie
To forget the hope
For a freedom without fault
But it's too late
Hate still devouring

I have never had a choice
Persecution their fun
Now I see that I am a slave
Used 'till death
