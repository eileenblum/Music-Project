I see your fingers as a sign of indictment
Always shifting the blame to the weak
Sanctifying your compassion for nothing
Your perseverance is disgusting me

Pull the trigger...

We generate
Caught into the state of persistence, our conscience is cabled
Through the cold, through the fog, through the time, I'm lost in despair

There is an inner voice that is draining and calling, humiliations are feeding it
You're blinded by the veil of your ambitions, your existence is worthless

Pulling the trigger beneath my jaw, outstretched
Burning a bible above your god, unpleasant

So my external behaviors may be limited
Despite this my own cruelty is not suppressed
The sphere of my dreams, illusions, it's so demonic
I'm a pawn in this game, separated from myself

Endless cycle of same mistakes
I glimpse our failure

Hey you! realize!, I'm sanctified in time
Kill me, I'm alive, stratified in time

We're nothing
