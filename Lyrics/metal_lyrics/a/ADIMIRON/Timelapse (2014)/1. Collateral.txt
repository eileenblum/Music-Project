Waiting for a new dawn of mankind
I'm proudly flaunting my mistakes
Guide me where the peace of mind is dying
Just below the dome of my doubts

Walking on a way where nothing happens
Destination through our movement in time
Swept away in endless instrospections
In this sea of contradictions I'll drown

Save me from the rigid laws of god
Fill these voids that grow between us

There is an inner voice catching my attention
Lead me now, to my collateral tomorrow
Consequences bound, despite these severe rules I'm blind
Hand in hand we fall, so let my mind burning on and on

Our lives are outlined, under the finger of god
In a sort of Eden, we're born to see our world to burn
