What if you could hold all the answers in your hands? Try to wonder if they're wrong
So now try to beg to your firm awareness
And declare your ignorance

You'll get enslaved into reality, your firm beliefs starts to tremble

Let's begin this masquerade, where no one is sure of anything

Liar paradox
Concealed meanings

Did you realized how the truth is unshaped? It's stuck in your internal contradictions
Convoluted sentences impossible to explain
True and false, I cannot define

What if you could hold, in your hands, lies
In my vague dreams, we are still, blind

Just wonder why believe, just waiting for salvation
We'll swim through reality
A pleasant harmony, grew up my lack of planning
Dug deep into my peace of mind
Declare your ignorance, realize the truth is edgeless
We'll fly trough the eternity

The cynic air I breathe
Pull strings of my tomorrow
