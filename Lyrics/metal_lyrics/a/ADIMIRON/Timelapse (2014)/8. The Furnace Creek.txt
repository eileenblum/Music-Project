Suspended above rules of any fate, dwells the most secret of the universe
When the rocks of our world started to move, even god watched amused what he created
An energy, that seized our stable cells, filtering our shells

The ancestor miracle, that lived in our fears
Clashing frequency condemned to expand
Waves of shocking blast within a blinding light
And all became undeciphered

Aligned to the spiral of unknown effects, for a fortuity we've been all generated
Out of control and spreading in all the world, a draining power that sneak in my veins
Our morality belong to the chaos
We are an aberration

Mutated throughout our history
Created without any reason
We're the sons, the only imperfection
Descending directly from the chaos

Our hopes projected in the sky, we are living suspended
Like the spore of the same infection, we're tainting the creation

Coiled around, destined to the void
Watch our race about to fall

In a swamp,generated to the void
Here are our conscience shouting
