Claiming the vile sentence of a tainted church, thousands torches are now approaching
Act like a puppet in obedience to your tyrant
Pierce your rival with a blade
Materialism became our doctrine our chains, beyond the vortex of the monarch laughing

Under the prophecy, the way of sadness
I would not scream cause my pain is not your concern
Justify empty life, trough your awareness
Under a cryptic dream still not unveiled

You tried to burn me, lost in despair, crawl beneath the shadow of what you were
Ashes silently swept away, divine salvation please forgive our cowardice
An agreement for enslavement, be the next victim in corruption and perversion
Crown your rotten heritage
Hidden damnation, an empty life with empty dreams, outline a vision of a domination

I'll be blinded

Under the vortex of infected wishes, leading reins of demise
Claiming my ancient rhymes

Justify your empty life carving deep into your soul
Breaking chains of demise
Please claim my ancient rhymes

I'll be blinded
Silent laughter
