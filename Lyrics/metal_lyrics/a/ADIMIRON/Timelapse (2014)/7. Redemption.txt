Never wished my own salvation
Now I believe to see a peripheral vision, I blindly stand
I feel naked without protection
Walking across this sea, I will not drown in my forgotten sins

I can't be overwhelmed, I'm a dormant, dying
Deep into the grudge of god
I can't be overwhelmed, I'm a dormant, dying
You'll not redeem my own end

Venerated misconceptions
Spreading around the fear, your temptations will guide you into the flames

Slave, and they still try to save me
Slave, but perhaps am I really lost?
Slave, there's no comfort in your prayers
Slave, cause in your faith dwells a lot of pain
Serve, my hesitation, my lunacy
Serve, recognizing conspiracies
Serve, and where the reason survive there is
Serve, I'm finally repenting

I bravely share a parallel reality, where everything is chaos, without a reason

Instead to stoke our global submission, awake your old doubts
The place where every truth will be revealed, is not in your grave
Now break your chains

And time, will tell
Who's right
