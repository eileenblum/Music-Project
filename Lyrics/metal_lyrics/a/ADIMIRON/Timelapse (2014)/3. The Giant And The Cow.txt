When time wasn't yet defined, the tongue of god started to align
And the abstract fell from the heaven
To incarnate the matter, the flow of time

Raise, spread your crushing power
Spawn, bleed into our sacrifice

And the space came to life, from his core the heat increased
'till the giant unleashed its power
An endless cycle reverting the past

Hail giant
Show me thy way

And now his word still reverberates, to give to matter a thousand shades
Sum identity of your religions, the giant rules from his throne of time

I will never bind to you
Behind your promises, father, your lies
There's no words to set me free
Silent being

Now there is nothing to heal
Now you worship this ill
I
I'll slay you all until
Show me how you reached the sky
