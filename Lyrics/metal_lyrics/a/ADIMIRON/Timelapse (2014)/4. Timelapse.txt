Sometimes I've got a wish to escape
Maybe where my dreams are silent
So now you understand, why I need salvation
I'm still there, still hibernated

Memories pressing each other, collapsing thoughts
You could feel pleasant to remember, in a blink of an eye
Sad life on the edge of isolation, by your thousand lies

But now I'm sitting here in sadness
I live out from any certainties
Our lucid visions get drastically changed
Still am I? just hibernated

Drawing pictures of existence
At the speed of light
There is no time now for the afflictions
I'm already judged

They wait across the line
Drag your soul, despise the sun
Pull me down from my desires
Keep me far from all this light

Still waiting
