Stuck in timeless streams in despair
Intersecting waves, bring me light

Start to count all universe laws in order to survive
Burning flames reduced to ghosts crawling next to me
Mirror that reflect my sight, a vision petrified
Trying to save myself from a parasitic blood that is flowing in me

Let me bleed
Caught in Ayahuasca dream
Ticking sound of my demise its vanishing in time

Wondering what is dwelling my eyes, illusions or desires?
Expectations now raised to borders of my fate
Underneath my skin I see, a weakness growing up
Visions passing through me, they're blowing on my neck, I am one of them

Seems like I've always been here
Seems like there's no sorrow
While my coming days keep on tear apart
Hand in hand we stand to fall
