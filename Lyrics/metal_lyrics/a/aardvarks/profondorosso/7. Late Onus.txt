Talk
scream to my dreaming but trembling mind
Break
slumbering thoughts that I suddenly find
Waken
invisible memories breaking the seal
Caught
inbetween feelings that noone can heal

Drive in me
dive in me
deep in my brain all these malevolent forces
arise in me

I'm thinking back to find the truth
the cause is burried in my mind
I'm digging for it in my youth
I'm hoping that I'll never find

Pain
faning the flames of the selfhate in me
Help
searching for details that I cannot see
Yearning
knawing and languishing greed for release
Kept
constantly held by this glowing disease

I'm thinking back to find the truth...
