Took me some time to understand the man
He is a fist in the back of my brain
Don't you know we're doing all that we can
The look in his eyes is no look of the sane

[Chorus:]
He is............. a timebomb

Transmit! The signal screams
Tearing the soul apart
Putting an end to dreams
Sewage drips from the foetid heart
When will he understand?
That he has blown my head
That I am crushed
That he is dead
