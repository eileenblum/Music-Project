Out in the marshland and deep in the woods
Something stirs from the past to live once again
Do you believe that there is life
In all that they told us was dead?

[Chorus:]
Our land, sea and sky
Our land, our claim
Our land, sea and sky
The power remains

This faith that moved mountains, blue stone and earth
Has its roots in the past, it's rising again
The path of the serpent now trodden to dust
Is raised from its slumber to beckon us on

Nathrac! They ripped your innards out
Defiled the sacred land
But I believe the power remains
Reach out your hand
