Sing to your sisters, your brothers are dead
The army retreated, the soldiers have fled
The carcass of nations lies out on the plain
For many to question but none to explain

Such carnage, destruction

They came in their thousands, to die for belief
In a guardian of freedom, once branded a thief
Led to their slaughter, to fight for their wife
Trapped by a system that demands only life

Such carnage, destruction

The corpses are buried the day may yet come
When man reaps the land with a plough not a gun
The sorrow of millions will be buried with them
That demanded the death not the life of those men

Such carnage, destruction
