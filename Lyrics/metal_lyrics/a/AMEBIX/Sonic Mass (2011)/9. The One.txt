Before the Earth was born we travelled from the stars
We fell like comets from the universal mind
We fused the elements within the rising sun

We are the north, the south, the east, the west, the one!

All sense of separation, this is your illusion
All sense of segregation, just leading to confusion

We watched the mighty fall and Empires turned to dust
The cities crumbling into the raging Sea
We entered into life that took the human form

We are the air, the water, the earth, the fire!

All sense of separation, this is your illusion
All sense of segregation, just leading to confusion
All sense of separation, this is your illusion

All sense of separation, this is your illusion
All sense of segregation, just leading to confusion
All sense of separation, this is your illusion

We are the one

Spoken: Oh man look upon your Works and despair
The fundamental essence ever was the same
Born of our mother moon, our father sun above us all days
These principles ever were the same, we are in everything and all is part of you 
As it is above, so it is below
Open up your eyes, stand at the center of the earth and look around you
The north, the east, the south, the west
The water, the air, the earth, the fire!
