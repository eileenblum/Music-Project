The Legion left, and with them took the dying light
Once more the land became a wilderness of supertitious night
And from the forest deep came tales of children reared by wolves
The mother raped and left in shame whilst in the womb
They dreamed revenge

They are murderous, and they come for us
Between the beast and man we die

Here come the wolf

They are murderous, and they come for us
Between the beast and man we die

Here come the wolf

A message came, a plea for help against the beast
But no-one came and night on night the forest rang
With chilling cries, as decimation took its course
Oh Gods have mercy of our souls, with every night the terror comes
See how they run

They are murderous, and they come for us
Between the beast and man we die

Here come the wolf

They are murderous, and they come for us
At night we hear the children cry

Here come the wolf
