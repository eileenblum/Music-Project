I see a burning cross upon a desert hill
Beneath a crescent moon a silhouette is rising

I see the ghost of men who passed this way before
One thousand years ago so full of their convictions

I see the congregation mass!
I hear the call to prayer mass!

We all were brothers once and shared the secrets of the stars
One thousand years ago and now we die for this black blood

I see the congregation mass!
I hear the call to prayer mass!

I see the congregation mass!
I hear the call to prayer mass!
