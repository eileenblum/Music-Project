Through dark Egyptian soil I rise
And raise my arms up to the sky
I am the life that never ends
I am the Logos called again

My story ever was the same
I was killed by broken men
And on the third day rose again
I am the God within the grain

I am the God of the grain, Iâm the God of the grain
I am the God of the grain, I live, I die, and Iâ¦

And so this Cross shall be my sign
For I was here before all time
I am the center of the flame
Every age shall know my name

I am the God of the grain, Iâm the God of the grain
I am the God of the grain, I live, I die, and Iâ¦

Mithras, Dionysius, Osiris, Adonis
Mithras, Dionysius, Osiris, Jesus

And I am born again
And I am born again!
