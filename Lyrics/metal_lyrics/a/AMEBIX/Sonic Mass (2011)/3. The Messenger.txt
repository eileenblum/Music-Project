This is the work, the Wise man will see
Thrice great Hermes, we call to thee
Distillation, revelation, look within, fire!

We saw the light, we saw the light, Matter!
Between the moon and the sun, the moon and the sun

Oh Ouroborous, surround us
The Lion consuming the sun
This is the work, the great work
Conjiunctionis Mysterium

We saw the light, we saw the light, Matter!
Between the moon and the sun, the moon and the sun

We saw the light, we saw the light, Matter!
Between the moon and the sun, the moon and the sun
