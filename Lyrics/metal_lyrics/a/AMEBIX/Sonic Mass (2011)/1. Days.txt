We came out of the night
Bloodied but unbowed from days
We always will remember
And by the morning light
We look upon the risen dawn
The day of our creation

I see my enemies
And I know the way, the way I will defeat them
And in such days as these
I see the circle turning to completion

These days will never come again
These days will never come again
These days will never come again
These days will never come again
