It's a race against time
And there's nowhere to hide
So they look for the sign
In the sky

[Chorus:]
No sanctuary

But its all a mistake
It's already too late
The key to our fate
Is inside

Yes it's hidden away
From the light of the day
In the minds of the
Masters of men

The damage is done
So the suffering goes on
With the aid of the
Peoples consent
