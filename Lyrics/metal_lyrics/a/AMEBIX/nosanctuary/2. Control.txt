And in our ignorance we let them take control
And in their wisdom they decreed that we should bow

Their grips extending to encompass all the world
The cages open to accomodate the crowd

[Chorus:]
When we put our lives into their hands
We put our hands into their chains

Refuse to aid them, refuse to hold their gun
You must refuse to light the fuse, to activate their bomb
