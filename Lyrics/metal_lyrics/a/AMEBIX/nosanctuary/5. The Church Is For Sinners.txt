The pulpits standing empty, the congregations left
Because to qualify for piety they had to pass a test
[Q:] How much "roughly" is your god worth to you?
[Q:] And if he said "lay down your life for me" could you give that too?

[Chorus:]
And will they never understand
That the future is in man

The priests, when told of starving kids, look on in mock dismay
While thinking of new ways by which to make religion pay
Money from mass misery? There's nothing wrong with that
The church holds out a bloodstained hand to pass around the hat

"By the pricking in my thumbs
Something wicked this way comes" [Shakespeare]
