My friend the time has come for us to say goodbye
So with these parting words I bid you farewell
It seems the life we led was just a shameful lie
What does the future hold? Well only time will tell

I'm not scared of dying and I don't really care
If it's peace you find in dying well then let my time be near
If it's peace you find in dying when dying time is here
Bundle up my coffin, 'cos it's cold down there

And when I'm dead
And when I'm gone
There will be one child born
And a world will carry on

Some say our fate is sealed and help to tie the knot
Some say that this may be the lull before the storm
But there's one piece of nature everyone's forgot
And that's, "The darkest hour is always before the dawn!"

When the candle burns low
When there's no more to say
Dig me a hole
Where my body might lay
