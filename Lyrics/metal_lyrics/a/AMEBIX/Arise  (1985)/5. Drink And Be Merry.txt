Drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die
It's better to laugh than it is to cry
My cup runneth over with blood and not wine
The last was the flood, it's fire this time

I took a walk on the beach, no sand dunes just oil
Dead gulls and dead fish were trod underfoot
The sky was tinted with yellow and black
And the air smelt like Dachou today

The fields were littered with the dying and dead
Nothing grows here but decay!
The village bell tolls, a priest vomits blood
Another life's wasted away

Down in the square, the party goes on
The doomed sit down to their last feast
They gorge themselves on the recently deceased
The heat of the day, the foul smell of decay
As they wait:. For the inferno to be
UNLEASHED!

So drink and be merry for tomorrow we may die
It's better to laugh than it is to cry
Live for life's sake, don't let life pass you by
There's more worth living for than meets the eye

So drink and be merry for tomorrow we may die!
