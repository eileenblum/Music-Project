Well we've all heard the sermon seen
The preachers or worshipped the stage
Heard the new manifesto? It's all questions no solutions at all
Well, you're out on your own now, always have been
Just look at your friends
Break the surface to daylight
Strength will flow through our unity.

There is a traitor in our midst
And when we rise we will be betrayed
They are the wolves in sheep's clothing
Take the place at the back of the fold
All this talk about freedom
Will be tainted with blood (it's your life)
Put this cross on your back child
Tread the long weary trail to the top of the hill

ARISE! GET OFF YOUR KNEES!

There's some hard times coming down
There's the smell of revolution on the wind
Well, we're grinding down our axes
Telling tales round the bonfire at night
We will set out with a fire in our hearts
When this darkness gives way to the dawn
In the light we're united as one
For the kingdom of heaven must be taken by storm!

ARISE! GET OFF YOUR KNEES!
STAND UP!
