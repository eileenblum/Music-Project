[2000 re-issue bonus track]

I have seen the winter sun
rise above the veils of Babylon
I've ridden out across the terra plain
seen the standing stones
where we will never meet again

I've seen our freedoms change
you gotta fight for the rights now
before all that remains
is a vague memory inside

we want the right to ride
let the rider decide

I have seen the loss
The eagles over the sky
walked into the valley
and the milky high
I have walked across the
lonely haunt moor
seen so many things
that we have never seen before

we listen lone and low
the glitter and glow
existing on the lonely names
to read to choose to winner to lose
about your freedom to scared
