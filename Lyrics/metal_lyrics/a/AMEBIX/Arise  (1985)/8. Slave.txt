Earth to ashes, buildings to dust
A radioactive burning crust
The meek shall inherit all that is left
Inherit the Earth, a living death

From the cradle to the grave
You made yourself the system's slave

Acid rain, rocks on fire!
Poison clouds, gods a liar
There's nothing left, for the meek
The past is gone the future is bleak

From the cradle to the grave
You made yourself the system's slave

Evil systems, government control
Are to blame for our downfall
There's no umbrella against the rain
Destroy the power, break your chain!
