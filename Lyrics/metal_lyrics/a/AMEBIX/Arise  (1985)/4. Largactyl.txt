You're standing on a hill, looking down at the city
Thinking 'bout your life and your bottle of pills
They released you from the hospital, you're cured!
So this is how freedom feels?

Largactyl Relax (it's only paranoia)

Feel a little numb? Feel a little tired?
Your brain's asleep and your body's retired
You've learned to fit in. OBEY!
You're just a shadow of what you used to be

Largactyl Relax (it's only paranoia)

A comfortable life? A car and a wife?
It's only a dream but it's fuckin' obscene
You've learned to fit in, a vegetable!
Senility! At 21 they'll be coming for you
