We are not fascists.
We are not nihilists.
We are anarchists.

Hello, your black, your alright you are. I go to college, this is my friend John, say hello John, he's got an R.A.R. badge, we got them from that shop over there, we got digs so if you ever stuck for somewhere to sleep, you know if your being oppressed by the Police or the N.F. just come along, but you'd better leave early so the landlady doesn't see you.
FUCK OFF!
