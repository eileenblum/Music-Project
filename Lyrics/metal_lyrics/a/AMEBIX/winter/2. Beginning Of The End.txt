What will you do when your properties gone?
When the finger on the triggers your one and only son?
When the money in your pocket cannot buy even bread?
The city has crumbled, the people have been bled

[CHORUS:] Looks like the beginning of the end

The machine has grown to crush the world, the walls are getting higher.
The youth will be the first to throw themselves upon the pyre.
The reason for living seems so fruitless in the aftermath
when we've finally walked to the end of the path.

The time is near at hand, a fact you must accept.
Time stands still for no man not even for the rich.
So sorry we're so humourless, it's just the way we are.
You laugh but I don't get the joke, we walk but don't get far.

Maybe there is hope in the dawning of the day.
When no rules define survival, when the earth starts to decay.
It's you who face the holocaust. It's you who cast the vote.
The sad part of your future is it lacks an antidote.
