A Requiem to the most ardent witnessed Beauty
Bloody Baroness, Thine is my Heart eternally!
Destiny led us together
Destiny took Thee away, oh Phantom of my Dreams
Thy spooky Fancy now seems lost to me
Awaked by feverish Screams
my Nights bath me in Lust and Desire
Suck - ubus Copulation, exploding dying Stars

"Bring to my Grave a black Rose
whenever mighty Death chose
to take me at His Hand!"

My lovely Mistress, may I fullfil those sensual Words
Thou whispered to me fairy-like as perpetual Testimony:
"Per Disciplinam meam Tenebrae videbis"

"Desdemona in this Grave doth sleep
Darkside Secrets She doth keep
bring to Her Roses, black as Night
to make Her Thy demonic Bride!"

Gravestone unveils this mystic Script
ghostlike it is carved in
Temptating me for Orgasms with the Dead

"Desdemona in this Grave doth sleep
Darkside Secrets She doth keep
bring to Her Roses, black as Night
to make Her Thy demonic Bride!"
