The Devil sings a Song
for superior Children, Darkness'own
seduces them as Worshippers
for His Paradise beyond
A fierce Hadit Kiss

I am the Flame in the Heart of Man
The Knowledge of Death
Beauty and Strength as Weaponry,
thus my Force and Fire
Pleasure of the secret Serpent
to let the Weak die in Misery
Divine Embrace and eternal Ecstasy
in this golden bridal Eyes
The Magic (k) of glorious Stars rains down
an Expiration sweeter than Death

"Love one another with burning Hearts
on the Weak trample in the fierce Lust of Thy Pride
on the Day of Wrath"

Be Thou proud and mighty
and strive ever to more!
The Slaves shall serve
and perish in their Veil of Sorrow

(There is no Truth except for
"Do what Thou wilt...")

This is the Law of the Strong
and the Joy of our World

"Liebet einander mit brennenden Herzen
und trampelt auf den niederen Menschen
in der wilden Lust Eures Stolzes
am Tage Eures Zorns!"

I usurp my innermost Throne
crown myself as King
in the Devil's Paradise
