Satanic Bible
In this arid Wilderness of Steel and Stone I raise up my
Voice that you may hear. To the East and to the West I beckon.
To the North and to the South I show a Sign proclaiming:
Death to the Weakling, Wealth to the Strong!

Liber Al vel Legis
Tear down that lying Spectre of the Centuries:
Veil not your Vices in virtuous Words:

Necronomicon (Ischtar-Tor)
RABBMI LO-YAK ZI ISCHTARI KANPA!
INNANA ZI AMMA KANPA!
BI ZAMMA KANPA!
(IA IA IA BE-YI RAZULUKI!)
