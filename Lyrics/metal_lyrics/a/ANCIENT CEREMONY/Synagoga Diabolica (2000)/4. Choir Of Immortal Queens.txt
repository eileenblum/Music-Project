Trapped in this Wood full of Fog
Raven leads me away
arriving at the abandoned Place,
an Altar, wonderful Ornaments
Flowers of all Colours and Beauties
in Centre the Statue of a Black Goat
A Number of Women
counting three times four, twelve
Holding all at their Hands, nude, one with Nature
Dancing round the Altar, whilst they sing:

"Eko Eko Asarak
Eko Eko Somelak
Eko Eko Gananas
Eko Eko Arada"

I feel as the Power
floats through their Bodies
Raven tells me:
Witchcraft - black, white - to be Immortal!
