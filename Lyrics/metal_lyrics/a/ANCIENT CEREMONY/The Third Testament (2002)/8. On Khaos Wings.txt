No mortal Soul ever shall feel
Wisdom-drenched Secrets hidden under my Veil
Through the darkest Portal ever built
I will guard Thee to the fifteen Stars under Ishtar's Gate

For I am all that was, is and shall be

Weeping, creeping, Death is sleeping
Mysteries of a World beyond
Shall bring Thee back to Life
As on Khaos Wings we ride
In this Black Magick Night

Created before all Mankind
Fire and Spirit in me unite
With the Wilt to Infinity

By the Powers from the East
And Mysteries of the Deep
I command in Anubis' Names:
"Thou shalt arise!"

Der Tod kommt auf leisen Schwingen

In these ancient Funeral Chambers
I cast my Spells upon those
Seekers of Immortality

Now let us dwell in the Land of Shadows
As on Khaos Wings we ride
In this Black Magick Night
Death rides on silent Wings

By the Powers from the East
And Mysteries of the Deep
I command in Anubis' Names:
"Thou shalt arise!"

Der Tod kommt auf leisen Schwingen

Die to arise!
Welcome to Spheres
Beyond Mirrors of Blackness
