Oh fiercest Goddess Darkness dares to invoke
Pure Demonic Attraction
When Thou were raptured by Elohim's Hand
Tears bedimmed Thy ebony Eyes
Former Things now passed away
No Sorrow, no more Woe

In Blackened Moon, in Twilight's Dim
Listen to this Bridal Hymn
Await my Diabolique Spell
Mine art Dark Powers to read the Visions old
My Orchestra of Agony performs for Thee
The Symphony of Pride

Now become One with me
Hades and Eden unite
Now Thou art One with me
In unholy Desire allied

Congressus cum Daemonae - See Shadows dance in morbid Rhythm
Congressus cum Daemonae - My Black Paradise it thirsts for Thee
Revolting Angels gather for Attack
Congressus cum Daemonae - Install Thyself next to my Throne
Congressus cum Daemonae - Our rival Kingdom never will bow down

Pass the Rivers of the Dead
A Vision of Elysium tonight flows
All Flesh desires Divinity
Imprisoned Stars now set free again
Ready for Vengeance

As I strike the flaming Sword
Thee all shalt hear the Master Chord
Performed in this Black Requiem of mine

Ego vos benedictio in nomine magni Dei nostri Satanas
Exaudi meam Dominus Inferus vobiscum!

Creatures of the Abyss
and in Heavens as well
Join our Path under the Sun
and join us in crimson Moonlight
