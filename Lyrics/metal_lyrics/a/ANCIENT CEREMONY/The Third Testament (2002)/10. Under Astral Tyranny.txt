Cosmic Chaos designs another Birth
of the Luciferian Principle
Spawn of Venus in Attack
Thou art to the World a raging Storm
Aeons end, Aeons begin
He is the One to call

Mountains drown and Churches fall
in Earthquake and Deluge
Chained in a Thousand dustfilled Clouds
Sun no longer dares to rise
A World in Darkness drenched
and Silence haunts all Lands...

When the Stars are in their Constellation right
it's Time to pay Tribute to his Might
The Astral Tyranny

Earth now is a Widow veiled in Black
weeping at Her own Grave
Side by Side with Death

Widely opened are Gehenna's Gates
like a Virus from Ereschkigal
Myriads of Dead do march
as Army bringing Pain

Jehova see Thy Children fall!

When Stars in Fear do stop their Dance
Not far ahead is that bloody Romance
The Oracle-Goddess preached
as Astral Tyranny

On this bleeding Planet I raise Centuries of Wrath!

My Time - now it is near
This Widow it may take my Hand
When as Messenger of the golden Dawn I ascend
This Principle - it's me!
