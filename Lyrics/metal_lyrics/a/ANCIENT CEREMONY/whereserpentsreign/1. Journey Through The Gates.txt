I will rise my Spirit to reach for the Stars
get my Soul freed through Ancient Spells
Journey through the Gates
Stalking here on this dark Path
Forests reflects a gloomy Mood
Starfilled Sky is watching me
dominated by bright Fullmoon
I will climb dark-grey Mountain
to get one with the Gods
Seven Gods of Stars
Seven Seals there are
Seven Gates to be passed
For all those who will pass these Gates
there awaits endless Wisdom
I rose my Spirit got one with the Stars
now my Soul is free
I myself am God, I
