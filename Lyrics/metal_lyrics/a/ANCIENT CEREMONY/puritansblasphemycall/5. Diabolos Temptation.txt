Trust me for I'm the devil
So let me take your hand
I lead you to the treasures
Of a forbidden secret land

Be mother to my seed
Nothing can tear us apart
To strong burning for the weak
Are the dark flames in our heart

Let us kill our enemies
Vengeance is yours and mine
Drunken from this triumph
Their blood it tastes like wine

Diabolos
Diabolos temptation

Diabolos temptation
The key to my new generation

Diabolos de-generation
The source of our supreme nation

Be goddess to our race
Symbol of sinister art
Too strong burning for the weak
Are the dark flames in our heart

Diabolos
Diabolos temptation

Diabolos temptation
The key to my new generation

Diabolos de-generation
The source of our supreme nation
