Time before the Earthquake
Sun has Darkened
No Star is shining
all Light compensed by Him
Suffering on your Cross
naked and alone
left by all your Friends
Despair consumes you
"Eloy, Eloy, lemah zamahtani?"
But there is no Answer
in Darkness creates Anti-God
His Throne is of black Clouds
carrying Him to the Cross
Shiva has risen
it's Him, the Destructor
"Whom do you call for?
It's only you and me
Your eternal Opposite
You tried to terminate Hate
but it became your Spawn
your Creature crucified you
this Creature it is me
outborn of your Hate!
You taught to love Enemies
Love me, your worst one!
Love me, I am your God!
See I am your Father!"
Declaring Love to Him:
"Father into thy Hands
I command my Spirit!"
Earth is now enlightened
"It is fullfilled!"
