The flaming Passion in Thy Eyes
fills my Heart with Melancholy

"Beloved One, embrace me, I thirst for Thy pale Skin"

In Remembrance to our final Kiss
under the Shadows of the eternal Trees,
planted when Raven lost their Seed out of his Claws

"Oh come, Beloved One, embrace me,
I thirst for Thy marble - pale Skin"
