As Darkness drowns the Landscape my Time it is to rise
Mighty Ruler of the stormy Night
Sanguinaire Lust of me, the Pale Nocturnal Majesty
Evocative Chants from the Shadow - Kingdom
As I fly into the Night my Realm of grotesque
Beauty touches Eternity
A Choir through this dark Forest
where Light never was to be seen
only the shining Jewels of my Sceptre,
protected by the Raven with the golden Wings
The Wolves guard the Path to my Castle
Pale Nocturnal Majesty, come await my Breath in Thy Neck...
Black Kiss
