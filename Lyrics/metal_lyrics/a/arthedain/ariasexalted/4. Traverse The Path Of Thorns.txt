Footsteps fall on this radiant path in the nightfall 
And the hours turn to days hastily. 
The whispering wind evokes the name of an intimate 
But the next moment fades into the distance. 

The horizon beckons with its elegant splendor 
So I travel to the water as if Iâm in a dream. 
The sun turns black in an eclipse as I arrive 
And beauty turns to darkness beneath an empty sky. 

As I walk this path of thorns I do so with open arms: 
I embrace the end, for aeons must rescind. 
Wondrous departure from this existence 
Soon my eyes will open, consuming light from the other side.
