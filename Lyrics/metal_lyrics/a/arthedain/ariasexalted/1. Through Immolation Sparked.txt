O Great Pan, I summon thee to guide me through the dark 
Light my path with the raven flame through immolation sparked 
Wanderer of the woods and mountains, make your presence known 
Lead me to isolation, where the deepest rivers flow. 

Lightning flashes across the sky, a blaze of dissolution 
The Death-Bringer rides his steed tonight, in search of retribution. 

The end will follow; 
To Chaos we shall return 
By your radiance blinded, 
And by your visage burned. 

O Great Pan, I summon thee to guide me through the dark 
Light my path with the raven flame through immolation sparked 
Wanderer of the woods and mountains, make your presence known 
Lead me to the hidden path whose name is carved in stone.
