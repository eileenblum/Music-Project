O Anti-Cosmics; reign in your majesty, 
Sworn to the blackest flame for eternity. 
In winterâs grasp beneath the freezing skies 
All shall come to pass before my very eyes. 

Vile spirits 
Blackened souls 
In the depths of the abyss 
On the infernal throne 

Visions of fire 
Grasping for clarity 
Shining through darkness 
Reveal yourself to me. 

A great storm builds on the horizon as the sky dissolves to red 
The waters soon will mirror this as they swell with the dead. 
A black moon shines itâs barren light on the few that remain 
The crows take hold and consume the souls of those who twist in pain.
