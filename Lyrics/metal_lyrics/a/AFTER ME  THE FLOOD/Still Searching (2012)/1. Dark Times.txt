[feat. Brendan Of Counterparts And Tony Of Saints Never Surrender]This is what I was born into. A cold dark world, filled with emptiness. I was given every opportunity to succeed and lead a path with no dead ends but my spirit started to wear down, my hands became callus, everything came clear to me. Most of us are subject to wrong and
this is what we're born into we'll learn from, we'll fade from, we'll die from. Most of us won't experience love. Thatâs what causes these are dark times we live in. I'm looking forward to a future that Iâm not sure isn't even there. The world is weighing down on me,
and my misfortune had me broken. I go through this everyday and succumb to all its negative ways. I rehearse what the blind eye sees, I've succumbed to being empty. A hopeless feeling constricts what I have left. Letting go should have never been so easy. Will I climb
out of this hole I fell into? Can anyone save me? From myself? Save me From myself.
