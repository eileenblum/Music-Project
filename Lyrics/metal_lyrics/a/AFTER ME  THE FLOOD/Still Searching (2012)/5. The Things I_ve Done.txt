I grow tired of the change thatâs taken place within my heart. My morals have gone to shit. And even though I tried to make sense of it this transition didn't stop even though I tried. My growth as a human came to a stop, poison grab on and didn't let go. I was cut off
from the world. My selfish ways are bringing me down. Whatever happened to the me I use to know. My selfish ways of thinking are bringing me down. I just want things to go back to the way they were. What the fuck will it take to correct all of this? I wasn't prepared for
this kind of life style. I was raised better than this. I miss the feeling of being happy. No longer pure, no longer clean. The person I use to be died inside of me. I've changed for the worst.
