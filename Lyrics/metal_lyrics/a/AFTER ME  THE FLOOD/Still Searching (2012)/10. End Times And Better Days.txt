[feat. Daniel Of Ugly Colors]There are things I could never tell
for I may dig my own grave
Iâll keep 'em bottled inside until
Iâm no longer your slave
End times and better days
Without the weight on my shoulders
A drought to a tidal wave
Float free no friends or family
So they'll never get to see
What really came of me
And i would be alone
Without a thing but my soul
In ocean of my secrets
That nobody will know
Forever I will keep them
And I will keep them close
I'll die with my secrets.
