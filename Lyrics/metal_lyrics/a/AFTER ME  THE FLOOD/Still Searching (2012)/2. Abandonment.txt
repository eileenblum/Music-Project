When I failed myself I failed everyone else. No one is here for me and no one is coming back. I turned my back on the ones I loved and fell into the nothingness I've become. The world's behind me and I hope it disappears. Such a miserable existence. I never wanted to be
forgotten I was just to proud to admit it and now Iâve been abandon but, Iâm still searching. Still searching for who I'm suppose to be. When I failed myself I fail everyone else, damn this misery for always loving my company. Damn this misery for always loving my
company.
