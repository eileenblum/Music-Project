My Mother,do you believe in me? Did I turn out to be the person you wanted me to be? My Father, do you see yourself in me? Did I turn out to be the person you wanted me to be? My gasping for air, running from this fear of losing you some day. The coast line it gets
higher. I just stand there and watched it sink. Ill miss you when your gone but I thank god you taught me how to carry on. And I am gasping for air. What am I suppose to do, when I have no one to look up? This is what I feel like, I am nothing, I am no one. The coast
line it gets higher. I just stand there and watched it sink. Ill miss you when your gone but I thank god you taught me how to carry on. I'll miss you when your gone. You were ripped from the coast.
