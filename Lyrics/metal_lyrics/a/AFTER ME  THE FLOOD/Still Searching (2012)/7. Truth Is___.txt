[feat. Jay Of Defeater]Did I even deserve you from the start? Confined to my lustful ways I always push you away. I wanted to be a demonstration for being pure, but behind these closed doors no one will see the real me. My lustful ways are crippling, but I'll stand straight up so you
don't notice me, falling. I wanted to hold a smile on your face, for as long as you'll let this continue, but for some reason I feel like things will not change. I do not know what you see in me, I am no king I wear no crown and if I ever told you the truth would you
still keep me around? My head weighs heavy with no crown to weigh it down and no queen here for my sympathy. Truth is I never wanted this, for you and me.
