All the times I've said that tomorrow was the day that memories were made of was because of you. It's the special bond I shared with the people that came with it. Child like ambitions held us together we didn't have a care in the world, but your never around anymore and
that just proves one thing to me. Even the strongest foundations crumble. This is us falling apart. And I watched drift away from the promises you said you would keep for me. The worst part was that I didn't try to stop you from slipping away. Memories are all I have
left of what we use to be and when tomorrow came you weren't apart of it. Your to busy living a life you don't have. I'm to busy living a life I don't. This is us letting life get in the way of living. We were ripped apart from years of building each other up. We turned
our backs and walked away from a lifetime of memories we made. Foundations crumbles, things fall apart, but fragments still can remain but we have become the walking testament of letting our lives get in the way of living.
