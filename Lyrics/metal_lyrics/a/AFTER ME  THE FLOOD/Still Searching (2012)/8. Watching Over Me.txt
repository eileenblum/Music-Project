Are you still watching over me? A overcasting shadow of doubt has grown into a cloud of sin, sickness and death. This generation has lost sight in the truth but how can we believe in something we can't see? We witness sin from the ones that are suppose to protect us. We
witness sickness grip the hearts of our loved ones. Death is impossible to stop but we hate you for taking what we don't want to let go. Did you ever lose sight in us? Did you feel like giving up? I use to look at you as a symbol, a sign of hope, a sign of direction. But
damn this generation, for destroying you in my eyes. Will you still listen when I ask for help? Will you forgive me for my doubts?
