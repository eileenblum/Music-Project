[feat. Ian Of It Prevails]A life with no direction, no purpose or no reason has its up's and down's for me. But I have my comrade at my side and we have walked with each other for as long as I can remember and we will walk for as long as this life will let us, but society has gotten in the way of
us and I don't know where to go from here. Here's to all the good times we have shared and all the memories made. Decisions have gotten in-between us and now we stray from the path. Filling the need to hurry up to where we are belong but having no idea where it that is.
Now that our lives are in complete disarray, we try to make the most of what we have left. But time won't get the best of us, it never has. Here's to all great times we have shared and all the memories we have made. We are nothing more than stray dogs. No direction, no
purpose, just each other.
