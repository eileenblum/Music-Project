God, can you hear me? Are you even listening anymore. Thereâs something that must be said. Iâm down on my knees. The Christ that died on the cross didnât do it for my sins. I tried to get you to save my soul but the devil has my skin. He wears it so well. The universal truth is we were born to bleed, suffer and sleep. Justifying this life that follows eternal peace. I guess that you just forgot about me. The older we get the further down the rabbit hole we go. The older we get the smaller our crosses shrink. The older I get the more the devil wants a taste. Forgive me for all the things that you didn't stop me from doing. God can you hear me, are you listening.
