Lying still the earth has reclaimed. Puzzle Piece put into place. Is death the ending or just the beginning. The casketâs closed, only taking never giving. The cruelty that is shows, the world stopped spinning. Still life, earths reclaimed its piece. Though it ceased your heart still beats with me. We taste the soil. The balance was disconnected and never will be reestablished. âIâm sorry son but your father didnât make it.â The look in your eyes reminded me of a better place in my mind. The casket is closed and I didnât get to say goodbye. And you worked your hands to the bone providing for a family whoâs lives are running on borrowed time. And I hope that some day I'll be half the man you always wanted me to be. Lying still. Lying still, the earth has reclaimed. Puzzle piece put into place. And the day that I buried you six feet underneath, I hope this isnât the last time I see your face.
