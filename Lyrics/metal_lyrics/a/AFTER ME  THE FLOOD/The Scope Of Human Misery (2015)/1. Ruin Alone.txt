When there was no more room in hell the dead began to walk the earth. Billions of people lived out their lives, oblivious to what they had become. We have defined our reality. Only through pain and suffering have we allowed ourselves to truly exist. Love is what will destroy and take away. We have defined our reality and I ruin alone.
