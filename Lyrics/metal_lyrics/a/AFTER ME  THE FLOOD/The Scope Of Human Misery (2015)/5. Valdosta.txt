And I just want to taste you one more time. And I lust after the flesh you have. Please, please, please give me a fucking chance. Let me wear your fucking skin. The virgin blood that courses through your veins is what has me so unhinged. Youâre sick and tired of the way
I look at you. Iâm sick and tired of the way you look at me. And I hate loving you, but I love hating you. No matter where you go or what you do Iâll always have my eyes on you. Iâll always be watching. The lust that fills my soul keeps me from having control. Let me taste your flesh.
