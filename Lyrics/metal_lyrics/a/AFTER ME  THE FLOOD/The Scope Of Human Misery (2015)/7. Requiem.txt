If time heals all then why do these wounds grow deeper. It just bothers me that you won't see me grow into something. Like lock and key, life chasing after death is our lives night and day. Lost without a key, no doors to step through. Locks rust, and the clock keeps ticking. Someone point me away from where Iâm heading. I can see the birds the gathering. This depression is real. Like the gun you gave to me and I just can not stop staring. Pick me apart limb from limb. Damn these not so secret thoughts for telling me to pull it.
Their wings opened up and picked me limb from limb. Take me away from this place because I am nothing compared to what I should be. Making you proud was all I ever wanted. To afraid to fail, I will never be seen. Pick me apart limb from limb.
