I find comfort knowing that soon I'll be dead and gone. From the day you were born till the day you will die youâve been blinded by these dead lights. Itâs this god damn place that showing me that my fears and anxiety is slowly killing me. Everyday is a constant reminder that the voices I hear are the things that I fear. That the fire that burns inside is whatâs keeping me alive. And I just want it to burn out, cease to exist. And I just want it to fucking burn out. Iâve lost touch with myself, Iâve lost touch with hope, Iâve lost touch with faith, I just canât feel a thing. And nothing turned out the way that I wanted it to be and nothing is what it seems. I look to the past instead of the future. The further I go the more disconnected I am. Iâll show you how to float, we all float down here. Itâs these dead lights that are killing me. And nothing is what it seems, and nothing turned out the way that I wanted to be. I would rather look into these dead lights then watch myself keep sinking. I would rather look into these dead lights then watch the world keep sinking. Blind me.
