I watched you fade away, into the nothing we must face. Blank stare, cold skin we will never speak again. The hospital floor is freezing and I canât stop shaking. What happened to you? The eyes in the waiting room wonât stop staring. What was the last thought that you had before resting with peace. I guess the flowers everyone sent is suppose to mean they will miss you as much as we do. Time keeps fleeting, lives keep fading. I watched you fade away into the nothing we must face.
