A simple means of living our lives, is by far not easy. Perfect pressure from the ones that have ruined their own potential lives. Completely lost in their own thoughts. We have begun to dig our own graves and it all started with the aging of our skin. Given the chance to breathe, we fill our lungs with disease. Given the chance to live, we stunt our growth. My life has value.
After all is said and done, will you press  down this same path or will you walk the path of remembrance? I want to help the best I can, but you can't help the ones that cant help themselves. 
I can't believe the tragedy that takes place everyday. Another empty shell, i came here with passion, don't leave here without taking action.
Where will we end up after all of this?
How will I be remembered at the end of this.
How will you remember me?
How will you remember me?
