Before we forget who we are, you will listen to what I have to say. The soft phrases that have left our lips and the high tensions that have come between us will make or break you and I. We are all just trying to find our right place. This is the frustration of not knowing where I stand. Of where I stand. Explain yourself. Anger has got the best of me. You will listen to what I have to say. You gave up on me. I won't give up.
