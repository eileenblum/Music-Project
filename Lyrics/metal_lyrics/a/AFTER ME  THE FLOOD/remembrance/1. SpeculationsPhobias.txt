A crack in the surface of humanity is crumbling the ground below me. What I'm seeing can't be real. A unbelievable hoard of corruption in a place we call secure. What the fuck have we come to? Ripping at each others' throats. The biting of tongues are making our mouths' bleed. No one is coming to save us from ourselves.This is a never-ending cycle, we will continue to run in circles. Careless ignorance. Where has the conscience mind gone? Slowly we sink, civilization drowns. This world is not our home. Disappointed, people won't go empty handed. Here lies humanity. It ended on selfishness.
