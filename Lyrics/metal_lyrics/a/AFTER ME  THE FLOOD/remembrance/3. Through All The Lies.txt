Friends and family gather around the time has come. The past has finally caught up to your pace and you can't outrun it any more. Through all the lies, through all the mistakes, through every thing you have put me through. You finally understand what pressure is. You
have become one of the worst. Bury your head in the ground; there is no way of you pathologically lying your way out of this one. Best friends forever, things will never be the same again, you will walk alone till your feet bleed.
