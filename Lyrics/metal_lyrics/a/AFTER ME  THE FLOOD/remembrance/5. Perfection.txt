This is madness through your eyes. 
We know that this is the end. 
This hate has consumed us all. 
We won't confuse right from wrong. 
We know that this is the end. 
We know that this is the end. 
We are not afraid. Afraid. 
This is hatred through your eyes. 
Pushing forward now, looking forward now. 
Pushing forward now, looking forward now. 
Perfection is in reach. 
We will continue on. 
We won't forget.
