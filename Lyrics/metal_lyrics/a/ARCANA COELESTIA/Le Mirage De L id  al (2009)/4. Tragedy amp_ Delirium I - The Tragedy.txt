[Le Poete Voyageur:]
Fear overwhelms my dreams
As the flood rises its fury
Now the tide is turning over meâ¦

[[La Fee Vert:]]
Your eyes will see the higher miracle
Throughout me
A place that no mortals nor gods
Could ever reach

[Le Poete Voyageur:] Is it real or just an echoing presence?
[La Fee Vert:] I will guide you through this haze
[Le Poete Voyageur:] Bedazzling me from nowhere
[La Fee Vert:] I'll be one with the light
[Le Poete Voyageur:] Staring at this empty glass
[La Fee Vert:] My dearâ¦
[Le Poete Voyageur:] I'll be one with the dawnâ¦

[Le Poete Voyageur:]
Oh Queen of the damned
Stand by my side, enlight the dying candle
With your peaceful glance so bright
Take my hand
And in the warmth of your embrace
I'll be no longer tragedy's slave

Oh Queen of the blessed
Be forever mine, enshrine your smiling malice
As a jewel lost in time
Take my life again and again
Mould me from your pale skin
Mould me from ruins

Abandoned, a silent decay
Triumph of delirium just an instant, so sublimeâ¦
