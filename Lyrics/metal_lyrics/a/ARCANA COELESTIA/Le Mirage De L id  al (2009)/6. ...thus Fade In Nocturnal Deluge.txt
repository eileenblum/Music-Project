Am I here to learn about the suffering
Or I suffer to keep on breathing?
Should I really have to put my trust in fate
In order to see my freedom caged?
Are you here to see this poor child growing
Or youâll be the flower on his grave?
Should I really have to let your hands free to heal me
The same hands that made me bleed?
Maybe youâll never know or maybe Iâll never hear you say:
âI forgive you my sonâ

As a tear for my last words
Soon Iâll be memory for you to shed
My deliverance leaves no shadows
Behind, only dirty sandâ¦
While this needle pierces me gently
Soon Iâll betray you escaping from the flesh
My salvation floats within your eyesâ¦

âSo I leave this earth, mother, no regrets will torment my journey
Just a pale light at my feetâ¦
So I leave this earth another time, a travelling show for all to see
Just a trace of me in your criesâ¦
And the last breath, silently it comes
Just to take away this pain of mineâ¦â
