A trace of humanâs life
Embraced by natureâs lust
Redeems its failure

As a picture of mankind hiding shades from the past
Reveals its splendor

When the blind leads the blinds every word is a fence
Like serpent tongueâs forgotten eloquence

Step after step it grows the fever
Alongside the path paved with gold
Where once our wandering was led by blood

Unconsciousness, be my witness a treason, our guilty perseverance
A sinful moan, our inheritance an elegy for us to rest
On fragile wings now torn asunder
Torment, renew my illness a dagger, our forthcoming penitence
A vivid scar, our last dance a remedy for us to mend
These wings weâve betrayed

âOn shadowed side of existence we crawl sculpting our shame as an image of god,
But in faith lurks the ageless sin
Câest lâEnnui!
Mother of all illusions, mother of our grief
Câest lâEnnui!
Unending fallâ¦â

On bended knees and harmless the struggle ends
The fathomless void of redemption disappears
Withered on the slopes of indifferenceâ¦

An unclouded scenario of lies â like the most precious jewel it shines
As far as I can see only painted smiles â like comedians under the spotlight
How come closer, oh brothers of mine â join the theater of fools, our own kindâ¦
