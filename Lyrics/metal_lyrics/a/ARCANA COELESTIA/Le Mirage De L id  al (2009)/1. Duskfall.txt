Lights gone, sun bleeds the night where quiet shores soothe the raging tide
Ethereal awaits the everlasting dome where darkened skies once slept forlorn
Sunset, autumn wilted scent thy nectarâs hidden, a venomous spell of dead rhymesâ¦
Neglected scripture sense concealed beneath the lightless side of Dryadâs eyesâ¦
From silvery falls to gilded soil every pathways ends, every whispers ignite desires lost
As a wind never blownâ¦ Mormouring hills at moonrise spread fields of white shadows
Carved in black stonesâ¦

âStarless landscapes in fugue toward old seas of inner cosmos unnamed
Behind the curtains of morning fog lies the sun, painter of blindness
An exiled soul in perpetual wanderingâ¦â

Horizon silken veil starving perceptions (it) enshrouds
As I lay down defenses. Dominion of tainted hopes
An elusive mourn arose from the depths of seclusionâ¦

So I run away from a Reason of mystified appearances
Of glorified thrones, in misguided dreams adorned

How long silence will lead us to the red blood dawning?
How many seasons yet to breathe
Before I may leave this burden of mine?

â¦ I will follow tears to riversideâ¦

Egoâs eruption streams forth as wept in pain
Through daylight my hands finally reach the fire
That burns with strength in eclipseâ¦
Oblivion of emotions reborn at least in deathâ¦
