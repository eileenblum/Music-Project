Victorious men of earth, come one again
to proclaim how wide your empires are
though you bind in every shore, 
and your triumphs reach as far...
...from where it's day to where it's dark.

Devouring famine plaguesn and wars
each able to undo mankind
death servile emmissaries are
nor to these alone confined...
then he had them at his will.

Victorious men of earth
yet you proud monarchs must obey,
and mingle with forgotten ashes when ,
death calls them to the crowd of common men, 
we shall become...
Victorious men of earth

More quaint and subtile ways to kill
a smile or kiss, as he will use the art,
the one that craving the foreseen 
shall have the skill to break a heart.
