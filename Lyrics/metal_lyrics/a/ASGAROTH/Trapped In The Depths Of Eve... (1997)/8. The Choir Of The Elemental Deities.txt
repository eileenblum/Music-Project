Marching over the mountain sides of Kiljaarn,
searching for the elemental gods orb,
the mystic object of the mighty power
that will give its invencivility

Silis-Godess of wind
Asron-Master of earth
Asthir-Godess of water
Recom-Master of fire

The mountain of elements stands before me.
Earth, wind and water protect it 
from every man who dares climb its peak
as for fate is at its top

powers that the fou gods unite
under the spell of the orb, ar the last hope;
combining the powers of the four elements
with the boldness of the orbposessor
will be the weapon against the dark force
