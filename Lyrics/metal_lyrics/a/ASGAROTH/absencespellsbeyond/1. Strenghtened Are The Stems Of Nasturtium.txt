Forging your spears with blood from our hearts,
scorning not lust but derision
Which mission in life shall die in my hands ?
Strong are the stems of Nasturtium

Calling the winds for a knowledge untaught,
which passion shall never disturb thee ?
Which mission in life shall die in my hands ?
Strong are the stems of Nasturtium
