[Music &amp; Lyrics: Christopher B.W.]

These lights protraying horizon beams
these forms, signs altered by a kind.

Striking errors from the past
individual lure on extinguishing light
decayed core, only dust and despair.

Mindscapes modulated in malfuncition,
the core in natural movementes
senseless sense intangible motions
an unmeasured declaration
for a knowledge untaught
