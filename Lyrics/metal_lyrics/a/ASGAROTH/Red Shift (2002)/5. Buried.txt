[Music &amp; Lyrics: Christopher B.W.]

There i stood buried in the sand
As it rose in front of my eyes...
as it rose in froont of my mind...
those 20 eyes staring into the onsome

I'm buried...
I'm choking...

And upon his loins, thirsty beasts
bearing the burden of pain...
...in those faces...
through his hands enchanted fo my please,
As I creep beneath the graven soil...

will I evenr understand?
what it ever meant?
