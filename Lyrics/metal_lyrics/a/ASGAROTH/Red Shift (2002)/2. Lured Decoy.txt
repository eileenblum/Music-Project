[Music &amp; Lyrics: Christopher B.W.]

The cause for distress
was never caused by what you knew...

That time you lurked in your world's shadows
a man powered mask among the mundane merchants
it was a game of taunting...
...and you definitely won the chance.

Those echoes, inversed, thumping on and on...
as i held your hands, again and again...

And i wonder why...
was that the price to pay?
the seed in your inside I found.
Gave birth in the devil in me

It never would be late,
to take the las resort
a decision greater of growing closer to the sun
but take no frail movements,
or else you will be lost.
The chances, the dreams, the pains, 
the dancind with the sun...
lured decoy
