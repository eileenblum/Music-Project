[Music &amp; Lyrics: Christopher B.W.]

Take a look in your own self
and see what's behind the voice
The self-riddance you named after conscience
now stands before you as a man. 
A sinful ensemble beneath a dried out skin
maybe time will tell what I knew
(from the very start)

I strangled your inside,
but now you're on your own.
