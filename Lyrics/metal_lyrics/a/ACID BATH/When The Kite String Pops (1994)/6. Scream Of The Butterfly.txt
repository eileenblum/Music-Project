A creature made of sunshine
Her eyes were like the sky
Rabbit howls like something old
As we twitch to a lullaby
The scalpel shines in god's sunshine
The Streetlights whisper pain
Down here near the poison stream
Our god has gone insane

She smiles like a child with flowers in her hair
With blood on her hands
Into the sun she stares
She feels it die
I heard her cry

She smiles like a child with flowers in her hair
With blood on her hands
Into the sun she stares
She feels it die
I heard her cry...
Like the scream of the butterfly

Sunshine in the house of flames
She loves it where she gets it
But it's never felt the same
Surgery, in the house of dissection
When your candle burns out I'll resurrect you
She runs
Through fields of daisies
Yeah, it's just a shame that they eat their own babies
Who cares
Cos the air is free
When you get there will you kiss the dead for me?

There's blood on the moon and the summer is cold
There's love in the room
But baby that's getting old
There's blood on my face sittin' on a dead shore
A highway of emptiness and I'm getting bored

There's blood on the moon as we plan our escape
The goddess in bloom
Handcuffed and raped
There's blood in the bathtub baby
Murder the king
There's blood on the moon
There's blood on just about everything

Sunshine in the house of flames
She loves it where she gets it
But it's never felt the same
Surgery, in the house of dissection
When your candle burns out I'll resurrect you
She runs
Through fields of daisies
Yeah, it's just a shame that they eat their own babies
Who cares
Cos the air is free
When you get there will you kiss the dead for me?

Something cold is forced inside her
A tears spill down her cheek
Stillborn songs of a dead dreamer
Hymn's of a needle freak

With sunlight in her hair she smiles like she don't care
Her dreams of liquid blue
I cut my self again and again to remind myself of you

She smiles like a child with flowers in her hair
With blood on her hands
Into the sun she stares
She feels it die
I heard her cry...
She smiles like a child with flowers in her hair
With blood on her hands
Into the sun she stares
She feels it die
I heard her cry...
Like the scream of the butterfly
I like the scream of the butterfly

I met an angel with a sawed-off shotgun
Wanted by the FBI
We dropped some acid
Killed our parents
Then we hit the road

Like the scream of the butterfly
Like the scream of the butterfly
Like the scream of the butterfly
Like the scream of the butterfly
