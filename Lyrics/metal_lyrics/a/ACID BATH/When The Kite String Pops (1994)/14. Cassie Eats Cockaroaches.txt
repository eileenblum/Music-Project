I feel the wetness of her tongue
That slides across my skin
The viruses crawl over me and feel for some way in
Cassie loves to swallow
This bleeding will not stop
I left cassie hollow
Cut you with my cock
Cassie likes it in her hand
Cassie's dead inside
I came to fuck the open wound
So hold it open wide
Cassie loves to swallow
This bleeding will not stop
I left cassie hollow
Cut you with my cock

Take me into the ocean
Lay me out on her shore
Wake me when the sun burns out
And we'll run forever more
We're all gonna die tomorrow
The freaks are screaming burn it down
She can't feel the weather
I can't touch the ground
Pale and twitching,
Twisting to the cold dance
Watching the room grow old
A funeral romance
Somewhere, someone's screaming that the world's gone
Smear me with your blood
And let these dead boys play their grave songs
Suck
Slide across the warm red floor
To meet me
Lock the bathroom door before they crawl
To eat me
Cut our throat
And whisper that we're going home
Twitching to the cold dance
They suck the meat from her bones
Suck
Suck
Suck
