If I took this cigarette and put it out on you...
Would you love me?

Her throat is soft
Her lips are red
Her thighs are white
Her heart is dead

Jezebel

Red rope
Burns around her wrists
Her blood is cold..like a serpents kiss
Do you love your whore?
I like to hear you beg
She crouched down in the corner with her head between her legs

Jezebel

Broken glass and dirty needles
Soul erosion truth
Electric god
Our superman found dead in a telephone booth

Shards of teeth
Ice pick abortions
Orgasmic death so warm
Lets die screamin'
Black goat semen
I can't hear you whisper "conform"

Hearts will stop and brain cells pop
Apocalyptic high

She screams bloody murder as they chop off her fingers
So this is how it feels to die

But it's ok
Yeah everything's ok

She was screaming about conspiracy
Talkim' about taking sides
I was masturbating, just contimplating
The cold love of suicide

Hearts will stop and brain cells pop
Apocalyptic high
She was screaming bloody murder as they chop off her fingers...
So this is how it feels to die
