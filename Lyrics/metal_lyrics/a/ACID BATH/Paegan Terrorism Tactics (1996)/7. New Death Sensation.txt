I wonder have you ever seen the sky
And felt this weight upon open eyes
New death sensation
Flesh flowers dream to bloom
Illumination
New death sensation
We dance the stone death naked by the shore
I hear her highway song forevermore
Illumination
New death sensation
Empty is this tomb
Lay this flesh to waste
Let the pieces fall where they may
Insects play their sunshine games
Splashing blood upon my soul
Crisp black kiss upon my skull
Lay this flesh to waste
Let the pieces fall where they may
Let the worms play their sunshine games
Splashing blood upon my soul
Crisp black kiss upon my skull
Empty is this tomb
