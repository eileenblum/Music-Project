Locusts are coming
Spine will twist, heads will cave
I am the funeral dancer on the outer wave...
the outer wave
Spine will twist, heads will cave
I am the funeral dancer on the outer wave...
the outer wave
Plastic heads with painted sockets
and death rode through the sky like a rocket
Everything dies so fast
So this is it
You're a dead motherfucker
Wading through a world of shit
With dust on your lips
Tell me do you exist?
You were born to die like this
Chins smeared red with conspiracy
The fiends nod off after bloodsex and blasphemy
You were born to die like this for me
Chin smeared red with conspiracy
With dust on your lips
Tell me do you exist?
Pale spirits laughing into the abyss
You were born to die like this
You were born to die like this
-?-
With dust on your lips
Tell me do you exist?
Pale spirits laughing into the abyss
You were born to die like this, baby
You were born to die like this
Naked and tripping, killing flowers
Empty is the urge to devour
I'm dead bored with your deathless blues
Scream for me, and I'll die for you
I'm dead bored with your deathless blues
Scream for me, I'll die for you
Devour...
Devour...
Devour...
Devour...
Devour...
Devour...
Devour...
Devour...
Devour...
Devour...
Devour...
Devour...
