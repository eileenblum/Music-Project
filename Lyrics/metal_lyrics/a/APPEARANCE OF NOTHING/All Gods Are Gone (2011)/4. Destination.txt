We believe in things we hear and see
We take care of things that we can call our own
Yes we believe
We choose our steps so carefully
Yes we take care
Of all the moments we share

We hold our head above the water
We're fighting on
Burning flames and raging waters
Step by step we will not fail

We hold our head above the water
We're fighting on
Burning flames and raging waters
Step by step we will not fail

And it's the vision of the nightmare I'm in

I am lost without a trace
I am lost without embrace
When I cry I fall asleep
A simple plan when I feel weak
Like a ship in the storm
It's like a pinball in my head
But I will never, I will never
Never leave my track

I hold my head up high
I follow my destiny
Go your way and I go mine
On this boulevard

I don't spend a dime
On TV Preachers and books
I follow my way and there is no turning back

Many oceans I have crossed
I survived them all
I've built a bridge
So many nights I stood alone in fears
I survived them all

I survive the nightmare I'm in

Driver by my force inside I can't give up the fight
Focused on the target and there is no time to stay

And I tell you there's a nightmare
But the dreams remain the same

Your destination

I am lost without a trace
I am lost without embrace
When I cry I fall asleep
A simple plan when I feel weak
Like a ship in the storm
It's like a pinball in my head
But I will never, I will never
Never leave my track

And there is silence you're crawling to me
And you know you should be here with me
You should better leave
Do you know the truth of the silence?
It's the moment to come to terms with yourself
It's the moment you beg and you're bleeding for love
So sad you can trust yourself if you're honest to you
But you must walk alone

Go step by step
Walk on
Survive your nightmare
Walk on through the ashes
Finish what you have begun
Don't look back and go on my son

Never failing and fly your flag
Just strike back, never leave your tag

Go out; walk on the razor's edge
Come in into a saver place
Go out; walk on the razor's edge
Even if it's the back of beyond
