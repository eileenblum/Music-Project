I knew this day would come sometime
It's the moment to clip the cord
The ship leaves the homeport!
The first time we stand on our own feet
We have to prove that we are right
The right is might and the rules are tight

No said it would be easy
No one said it would be that hard
We are eager to please and do it right
It's our fight

No said it would be easy
No one said it would be that hard
We are eager to please and do it right
It's our fight

All ideas are trapped to ice
Follow the government's good advice
Every decision is like
We rub salt in the wound

Shall we trust in good like they tell us?
We have to play the scene
We're in a circus
We should guard our attitude like gold

The rules are given
The bets are made
The rules are given
Yes the bets are made

I cross my heart and I hope to die
I act with no intent, I never lie
How could it happen?
I'm chained in a system.

I cross my heart and I hope to die
I act with no intent, I never lie
I'm chained in a system.

Sometimes I don't know what's going on
It's like running out of time
And I don't know what's going on
That's not what I want
That's not what I want

Maybe I expect too much from me?
Maybe I misunderstood my destiny?
Maybe I am weak
And should stop for a while
Slow down and consider
Maybe close that file?
Maybe I expect too much from me?
Maybe I misunderstood my destiny?

Is it the line of the least resistance?
Is it the line required by law?
Is it my free will and is it my wish?
Or is it the society's rules I saw?

TV publicity describes my dream
Arouses my longing daily on screen
Of course I'm happy when I get that toy
Or have I been navigated like a boy?
