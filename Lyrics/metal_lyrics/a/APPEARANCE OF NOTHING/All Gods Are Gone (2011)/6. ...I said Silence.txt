Silence, I said silence
Can't you shut your mouth?
It's every day
And still the same
I know it's time I waste!

Make me feel like a stranger
In my own house
But now you went too far
If you don't stop making noise
I'm sure we'll have a war!

Fine!

You think
You're good enough, I am!
Disturb me all the time
What's wrong with you?
I know you love to make trouble
Maybe you fuck my wife

Cool, I think you know!
But tell me do you have some kind of strategy against your enemies?
What's your strategy against your enemies?

Hey you! Let me say
You'll see one day
I am sure I'll kick your ass
Hey you! Let me say
You'll see one day
I will meet you again

Sometimes we sing
Nightmares they bring
We must live together
Sometimes we sing
But nobody is here
Neighbours and teachers

Sergeants and preachers
We must live together
Sometimes
They sing but nobody is here
Wait until the moment comes

We are here, you are near
Now it's payback!
Welcome back we meet again,
Like I said you're a loser
Your nightmare is here!

Silence I said silence

What do you want from me?
Don't bother me
You're bugging me
You're the troublemaker here

I am sure you're not evil minded
But I don't give a damn
If you're going on like this
You will end as spam

All the things you did
It burns like a fire inside
My revenge is sweet

But is this really me?
I've sent you to hell so many times, this is the time
This is the time to forgive

No!

Hey you! Let me say
You'll see one day
I am sure I'll kick your ass
Hey you! Let me say
You'll see one day
I will meet you again

Sometimes we sing
Nightmares they bring
We must live together
Sometimes we sing
But nobody is here

Neighbours and teachers
Sergeants and preachers
We must live together
Sometimes they sing
But nobody is here
Wait until the moment comes

We are here, you are near
Now it's payback!
Welcome back
We meet again, like I said
You're a loser
Your nightmare is here!
