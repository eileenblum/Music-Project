Lying in this room
With my sweet enemy
All my colors fade to grey
And now I knowâ¦

I won't survive
The beast that lives inside
I will never survive
Slowly loosing this awful fight

I've walked along this road so many years
Dark power will reveal
And I know there will be many tears
Red blood changing in to white liquid fluid
Everything seems so unreal
Let this ride begin

I won't survive
The beast that lives inside
I will never survive
Slowly loosing this awful fight

So fight!

So mean, 
Trapped and chained
Cannot describe
This is hell inside
Spill blood, eternal war
I'm much stronger
You can't close that door

Now you realize
You can't catch up to me
Whining, struggling,
Nothing can take you away

Fight!

The control is mine
Fight!
My appearance will shine
Nothing!
Will remain the same
Wasted time it's such a shame

I divided myself into two
Poisoned myself with despair
Now that I see, is it too late
Can I catch up with him or is it too late?

Is someone there who'll help me to crawl?
From my regret, where I fall?
I feel like I'm left alone
Sometimes I feel like I'm not in control
High on this does, can't fill my hole
And I'm wondering

Hatred and pain now flow through my veins
You will not survive
You'll never survive!

I won't survive
The beast that lives inside
I will never survive
Slowly loosing this awful fight

Once we shared
The same dark life
Now it seems
We're parted by knife

Can't you see?
I'm suffering
