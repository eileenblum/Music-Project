I am her son
A planted seed on stormy fields
I hope she smoothes my way
Puts away all the stones

Mother father brother, sister, anyone
Brother sister
Help me out if you can
Help me out here
Take away the pain
Trying not to lose my gain

And here comes the night again
When we all start to dream
Everything's all right and then
It is not as it seems
And we hope she won't die
When we look in her open eyes
And we hope she won't die
At least you have to take away her pain

Too many times I act desperately
But they've been there for me
So many times when I was right
Or even if I was wrong

Mother father brother,
Sister, anyone
Brother sister
Help me up if you can
Help me out here
Take away the pain
Trying not to lose my gain

And here comes the night again
When we all start to dream
Everything's all right and then
It is not as it seems
And we hope she won't die
When we look in her open eyes
And we hope she won't die
At least you have to take away her pain

And here comes the night again
When we all start to dream
Everything's all right and then
It is not as it seems
And we hope she won't die
When we look in her open eyes
And we hope she won't die
At least you have to take away her pain
