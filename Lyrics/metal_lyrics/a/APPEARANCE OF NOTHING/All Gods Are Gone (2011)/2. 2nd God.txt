I guess you know that feeling when you're under pressure
I guess you know how it feels if you're forced to do something
But in our minds we share the same horizon
Now we shall turn 
The page of the book 
Called life

Oh all works so well
Luck is on my side
Why should I change?
And I know it's hard to understand
How I live my life
But I'm quite alright
I guessâ¦ I think

Wake up we're breaking the silence
There is no turning back
Wake up we're breaking the silence
Can you hear the Raven's calling?
It's one step to go

In our ears it sounds 
Like military orders
We see no use at all
It sounds like madness
For our lives, for gold
For a friendly second god
We run, we bleed
We burn our hands for you

Oh all works so well
Luck is on my side
Why should I change?

It tears me in two
And I won't wake up
From that dream
Shut the fuck up!
I am not like you want me to be!

No!

Leave me alone
No
I am someone
Don't care about me,
I am fine and that's OK
No look for another
No I'm not your brother
Don't care about me
I am fine and that's OK
