I feel abandoned and cheated
The times are gone I felt so badly treated
Here I am, another man
A diabolical beast, a warrior
In fact a constant mutation
Driven by fear, a revelation
I keep my pictures in the flesh
For a lifetime no hesitation

Holding your hands now
Trying to be there
Holding your hands now
Trying to be there

Stealing our dreams, our hopes and our fears
Deleted from our memories
Redeem to ourselves to our land of no dreams
Cursed by our reality

I can feel my body dying
Disgusting the world around me
I can feel my body dying
Disgusting the world around me

Living without a reason
Is like dying without believe
If you cannot understand,
Then say goodbye to your soul
You'll be there alone, won't you understand
And I wait there alone, don't walk away

All you do is a picture of you,
Day after day
And all that you've been through
This is your life, just accept it as it is
We're all here to pay you respect
With open arms we don't regret
The gates to hell are open wide
No chance to hide

Living without a reason
Is like dying without believe
If you cannot understand,
Then say goodbye to your soul
You'll be there alone, won't you understand
And I wait there alone, don't walk away

I'm trying hard to be the one
Who brings home the things well done?
I don't know why it feels as if you're here
We have been designed to stick together
For a lifetime, through thick and thin
And this combination will help us to survive the pain

I am burning for you, I am dying for you
I am crying and Iâm holding all the tears for you
I'm stuck deep in this sorrow
And I can't explain but I know for sure
I know I can't stand this pain alone anymore

I wanna hear your voice, your breath
I wanna smell your scent
I wanna keep your smile
Because I like your style
I'm gonna keep these memories
And never let them fade... it's true love

Living without a reason
Is like dying without believe
If you cannot understand,
Then say goodbye to your soul
You'll be there alone, won't you understand
And I wait there alone, don't walk away
