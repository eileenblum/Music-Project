Fearless cold and detached
Masters of disguise
He's never sleeping
Deep beneath the surface
Lives a big disease
An enigmatic life without sunlight

Bow down, obey your king
Fearful you'll serve his will
Masters of infinity
No remorse or dignity

Is it our right or is it our fight?
Who we are to draw the line?
Soon enough they'll bring our final days
Simply living in this holding
Rising up to undo men
Armageddonâs knocking at your door

The chains of history
That can't be broken
All the great misery
Remains unspoken
Justification by faith
Growing up a youth of hate
Building cathedrals to forget our pain

Where do we belong?
The prophecies are wrong!
Where do we belong?
Could the prophecies be wrong?

A conflict of our fathers
Continuing all the hate
For my sons and daughters
Several generations
Suppressed by mankind
The ultimate insanity
What is wrong or right?

Bow down, obey your king
Fearful you'll serve his will
Masters of infinity
No remorse or dignity

The chains of history
That can't be broken
All the great misery
Remains unspoken
Justification by faith
Growing up a youth of hate
Building cathedrals to forget our pain
