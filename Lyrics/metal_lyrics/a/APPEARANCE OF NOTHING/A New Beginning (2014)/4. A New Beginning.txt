A calm and sleepy giant
Floating in the dark
All alone by his stellar path
A witness of past time
Can you see?
Dwelling long before mankind

Believe your eyes
Like arrows in the sky
Slowly moving in the air
Molecular clouds
I fall asleep
Low humming in the cold black fog

You will never catch their eyes
Never see them staring back
Even if you leave this place
They will never cease to exist

Nine heavenly bodies around the one
The one that's shining wide and bright
Every time just like a fool
You wonder what's beyond the moon

Every night you count them all
Until there's nothing but the holes they left
You'd like to run away from fate that's to come
From the life they have chosen for you

You see them coming down every once in awhile
A fire burning blue
You will hear a thunder roar screaming above
You know they must seek for more
Feeling their power loosen its strength
This is not the way to take
Time to go away, no looking back
Never return again

Longing for a distant living
Beyond the moon, a new beginning
Reaching for the stars
High above the rising sky
Soon enough you'll be a child of the sun

The first, the third, the fifth seventh
Never leave their path and never rest
Always moving around the biggest one
The one that burns so slowly out

Morning's coming through they're still on their way
Always facing the sun
Who has split these stars across the sky?
Clouds of light, a thousand fireflies
Lime and limpid green, a second scene
Moving through the darkness alone
Never to be seen throughout the day,
Guarding us all

Longing for a distant living
Beyond the moon, a new beginning
Reaching for the stars
High above the rising sky
Soon enough you'll be a child of the sun

Planets burning, stars colliding
Life under ice ending theme
Navigate with them, leave our fate to them
Believe in powers high above
Long before today in an ancient time
We have understood what they said
Knowledge lost in space no more praying
They've abandoned us, cut their ropes

Longing for a distant living
Beyond the moon, a new beginning
Reaching for the stars
High above the rising sky
Soon enough you'll be a child of the sun

Is it too late? Wandering blinded
Isolated, overcome
Isolated, overcome
Is it too late? Wandering blinded
(You said you'd be there)
Isolated, overcome
Isolated, overcome
(Blind no longer)

You said you'd be there
(You said you'd be there)
But no longer you care
(Blind no longer)
And we're waiting for you
(Isolated, overcome
Isolated, overcome)

Tonight crushing down
Every single one
My dream of liberty
Lost along the way

Time is rearranging now
Mountains falling in the sea, in the sea
No more lights across the sky
Darkness spreading in my head, everywhere

Longing for a distant living
Beyond the moon, a new beginning
Reaching for the stars
High above the rising sky
Soon enough you'll be,
Soon enough you'll be a child of the sun
