Sometimes I am afraid I might run out of time
Struggling against the ticking clock,
Sending shivers down my spine

Stream of imagination
Slowly streaming down the way
As the last lights have begun to fade away

I step into the darkness
Unwritten stories remain untold
My final hours are beginning to unfold

There's no hope for me
I am lost in melody
It will be my haunted
Forgotten symphony

Shattering my work above
Yet I try to make undone
All the lines and notes in black and white
Who take care when I'm gone?

An echo down the hall
Help me when I fall
An echo down the hall
Then silence over all

There's no hope for me
I am lost in melody
It will be my haunted
Forgotten symphony

But now the pain is gone
And the dark turns out of sight
All your worries washed away

You step into the light
Once the weight falls off your shoulders
The sky gets clear and bright

Your stream of inspiration
Notes are falling from the sky
As the music magically begins to play

There's no hope for me
I am lost in melody
It will be my haunted
Forgotten symphony

Shattering my work above
Yet I try to make undone
All the lines and notes in black and white
Who take care when I'm gone?

An echo down the hall
Help me when I fall
An echo down the hall
Then silence over all

There's no hope for me
I am lost in melody
It will be my haunted
Forgotten symphony

I've lived in fear, I've been afraid
Someday my life could come to an end
I've had it all, this harmony
Here's for you, here's my final symphony

I've lived in fear, I've been afraid
Someday my life could come to an end
I've had it all, this harmony
Here's to you my final symphony
Here's for you my final symphony

An echo down the hall
Help me when I fall
Silence over all
