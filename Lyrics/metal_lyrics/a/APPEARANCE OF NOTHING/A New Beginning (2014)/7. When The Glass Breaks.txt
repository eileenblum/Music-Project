Shades upon the sun
Darkness spreads, the vanishing
Never gave a reason
When the concrete breaks
It's hard to believe
Never understood the way you're talking
Never understood the way you're talking
I never understood the way you're talking

Restless sleeping, no direction
Asking the darkness for a favour
A dim white light beneath the doorway
Hearing voices

I can hear the tension,
I can sense the evil
Slowly tearing us apart

I saw the glass fall a thousand times
Never understood the reason why to die
And when the glass breaks it's hard to go
I'll never understand the reason why to die

Keep your lies
Shadows growing in my chest
Lights are burning out
Some scars won't heal
Some things cannot be made undone
Take them underground

What will replace us?
What will be there?
As water finds its way
You prayed and went away
You stared into my eyes
Where will you go?
As water finds its way
You said and went away

I saw the glass fall a thousand times
Never understood the reason why to die
And when the glass breaks it's hard to go
I'll never understand the reason why to die

The glass fall
To die to die to die
The glass fall
To die to die to die
