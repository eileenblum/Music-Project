You're at a turning point
Where do you belong?
Whatever you decide
I'll be holding your hand

Every single day
You smile and walk away
Carrying demons deep inside
No one ever meets them
On and on it goes
You hide behind your smile
Sometimes a tear breaks through
The mask of sorrow

Is it worth all the fighting?
A million times you've drowned

Forsaken, left behind
I hold you close, I hold you tight
A shining star goes astray
So far away

Can't free you from this
Pain and misery
A veil of shame and grief
And disappointment
You have been hurt before
But nothing was like this
One last look behind
Before you leave the stage

Is it worth all the fighting?
A million times you've drowned

Forsaken, left behind
I hold you close, I hold you tight
A shining star goes astray
So far away

Small fragments of another life
Stalking shadows lay behind
Looking up to a cloudless sky
I walked with you, but now I wonder why

A look behind but now I see "Why am I here?"
Do I wonder why you let me down in a wrath?
This is a time of failing, this is a time of loss
This is the time deciding over my own life

Forsaken, left behind
I hold you close, I hold you tight
A shining star goes astray
So far away

No way! I canât stay
God knows Iâve tried to hold
Itâs pain to stay on your own
I have to leave! Goodbye, my friend,
I hope youâll understand
I have to follow my own way now
