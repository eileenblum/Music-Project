Is it time to say goodbye?
Can I face the evil eye?
We were born to live
There's no reason why
I feel that I am weak
I feel a little meek
I feel like I'm unable to speak

Where do we belong?
The prophecies are wrong
The blue sky survives,
We're marching on
Where do we belong?
The prophecies are wrong
The blue sky survives,
We're fighting on

You're wrong, 'cause we are strong
Don't stop till the Judgement Day comes
You're wrong, yes we are strong
We want to live forever

We sell technologies and dreams
Constantly, faithfully, we're here in reality
No time for mysteries, no time for prophecies
Yes we're not wise, we pray for a good advice

Where do we belong?
The prophecies are wrong
The blue sky survives,
We're marching on

The end is near, complete destruction
Follow us we lead you to salvation
The end is near now, no hesitation
Follow us â we lead you, we guide you, we take...
Take away your fears

Where do we belong?
(Win our right to live)
The prophecies are wrong
(The seer and the prophets)
The blue sky survives,
(Nostradamus)
We're marching on
(And the rage of mad men)

Where do we belong?
(Win our right to live)
The prophecies are wrong
(The seer and the prophets)
The blue sky survives,
(Nostradamus)
We're fighting on
(And the rage of mad men)

You're wrong, yet we are strong
Don't stop till the Judgement Day comes
You're wrong, yes we hold on
We want to live forever
