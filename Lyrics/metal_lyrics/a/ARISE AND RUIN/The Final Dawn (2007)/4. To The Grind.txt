Regroup, clouds cover this foggy road.
I have smelt this early stench all too often.
Quickly the light approaches, the time is near.
Take hold these reins, be sane, be strong, believe me.
I fucking break my back, I fucking slave, I work these hands all day till my fucking knuckles bleed.
Mid-day the clouds dissipate, this sweat now pours.
Pressing on and on, this day will end.
For weeks and weeks we work, we eat, we sleep, we bleed.
For months and months we bruise, we break, we fucking bleed.
I fucking break my back, I fucking slave, I work these hands all day till my fucking knuckles bleed.
Now, as this day comes to an end my time here seems unescapable.
Just gain control, you will bleed now.
