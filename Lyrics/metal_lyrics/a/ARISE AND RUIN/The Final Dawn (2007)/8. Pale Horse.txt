Through a blazing fire this horse will ride.
On and on the beast survives.
Till the end of days you're free to ride.
Ripping apart your battered flesh down to the bone.
Death will rise as the earth draws calm.
All this pain will fade with time.
Unleash the darkness within.
Lay down your arms, your tears will shed.
Through your struggle to accept, our bond grows stronger.
On and on the best survives.
Death shall no longer reign.
This love will be true.
