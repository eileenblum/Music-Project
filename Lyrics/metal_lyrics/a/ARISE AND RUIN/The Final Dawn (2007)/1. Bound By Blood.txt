No more excuses now, can't let your brothers down.
Be grateful be honest, there's no fucking way in hell I could fail.
Bound by blood we'll fight to the death.
My betrayal has forsaken my closest allies.
I'll take this to the grave, dishonest, unforgiving, I cannot erase this.
Bound by blood, we'll fight to the death.
Together we ride.
Never again will I turn a blind eye.
Together we stand, we will be sent back to hell forever.
