Hold the lines and battle on, we fight to live.
Look inside to the pain, we'll take the hill.
Wage forward assault on the final dawn.
Steady hands and anxious nerves, war instills fear, guilt and anger.
Where's the courage? Wage forward assault on the final day.
We'll raise our arms, break free.
'Till dawn this war is at a standstill.
We live today, till dawn.
We will live, at dawn we'll fight raise our arms and break free... today we live.
