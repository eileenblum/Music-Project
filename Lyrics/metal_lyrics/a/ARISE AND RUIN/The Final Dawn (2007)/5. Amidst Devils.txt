All this time to contemplate, only you and me, the bottle's gone empty, you can't put the past behind you.
Take the first shot we'll see who stands strong.
You cease all this built up hatred you feel inside, will spread and conquer your life.
Spineless, gutless, all attempts have failed.
Resurrect the past.
Nothing changes, maturity is a lost cause.
On this day of reckoning surrender is the only option.
The consequence is yours.
Nothing life.
Resurrect the past.
Nothing left, nothing changes.
On this day of reckoning surrender is the only option.
The consequence is yours.
You're fucking wrong.
Surrender is the only option.
Nothing left, nothing changes.
