Raise your fist at this chance to feel alive.
No holding back, no fucking way I'd miss this chance to feel alive.
I have seen the past, and looked ahead to the years to come.
If there's a will theres a way.
Oh hell yeah.
Break these chain that bind, grab a hold of this new found life.
Take the helm.
Take the helm and steer us right.
Uneven ground, no telling what comes next.
To persevere is to purify of fuck ya', these raging waters are no match for us, for our new found life.
Take the helm, take the helm and claim your throne.
Scour the depths of hell, uncover the truth.
I'll break the mold.
No holding back, no telling what lies ahead.
Scour the depths of hell, I've revived.
For the millions before me I have to say, don't pass on the chance to feel alive.
Take the helm and claim your throne, take this chance, feel alive.
