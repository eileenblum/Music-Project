Walking on the path of others.
You came, you saw.
Once were trusted nearly brothers, you turned your back.
Every time I turn the corner, another life has changed, another bond will break.
And home is out of reach.
Return to the place of innocence.
Tired, hungry, battered and scarred.
You hope you beg.
Forgiveness was never an option, you turned your back.
Every time I turn the corner, another life has changed, another bond will break.
Home is now out of reach.
This world had been a never ending battle of good and evil.
I've searched far and wide for the answers to your treason.
Solidarity amongst man is crucial for survival.
Across this everlasting plain this road comes to an end.
