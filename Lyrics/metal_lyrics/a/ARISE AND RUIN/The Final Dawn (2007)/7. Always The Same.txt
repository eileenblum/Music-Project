Accomplish a gaol, fucking feels good doesn't it,
Now you should get a grip on what to do.
It's OK, just hold your head high, bury your doubts and rise again.
Now that you've gone to the edge and back behold the truth.
Life is always the same.
Live for yourself, think positive never let up.
One life to live for yourself, now take control.
You've realized life has just begun.
Always push ahead.
