In the days of the new the wicked prey on the weak.
Vengeance fills your rage, the anger is here to stay.
Tour fear of defeat is hidden by your hate.
I shall remain calm holding on to trust.
Engage all weaponry.
Before the day is done, we'll kill all the vengeance, your fear consumes your soul.
Engage all trust.
Your fear will annihilate your vengeance.
Defeat the hatred inside us all.
Fear consumes your soul.
Strips your anger.
Inside us all there is a common understanding and respect.
The prey rise above.
