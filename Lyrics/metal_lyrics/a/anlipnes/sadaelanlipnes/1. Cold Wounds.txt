[performed by Anlipnes]Try to see,
if there is fear...
Try to believe,
if there is God...
You are mine, forever

In the cold winds of nowhere
Our hopes are running away one more time...

Alive with me in my dreams
With a voice of one who weeps
They cry inside the silence
and silence...

Its more then a distance between us...

Can you feel now?
Can you believe now?
Hear me,
How can you still be unconscious..
Cant you see the pain(the pain) on you..?
Try to remember (remember),
the cold wounds that deserted on me...
Its again that freezing lies surrounds me here
and they fall from the cloudless skies,
bleeding on faces
all these eyes are witness of this sin
no,
no...

and they swallow my last strength,
and desire to live, it turns into disappearing,
Every passed season makes them colder,
but too so deep and more hurtful than were...
