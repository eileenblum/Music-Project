[Lyrics: V.P, St.Sea, Music: V.P, B.Y]

Now hopes are lost; which we dreamed about.
They are sacrificed for us, waiting in the coffin.
Night crowns my fears While waiting for the sunshine...

(My) lying body is crawling in pain,
breathing the last moment and decay.
Day after day fall on my skin,
Stay on my side, deep inside...

Ouu my nymph, close my eyes,
Touch on wings under sweet lies.
Can you hear the begging of sorrows?
They come for the spirits of loss.
Trying to be one of billion,
Stay altought (regardless) of these destroying storms,
To listen to the raven like the swansong.

at days I am lost in the sunshine,
at nights I find myself in the endless cries...

How can I hover with you like winds ?
How can I leave behind us, all sins ?
where can I revive my withered hopes?

Trying to be one of billion,
Stay alive in destroying storms,
To listen to the raven like the swansong,
To look at the dark like it has been sun,
and to feel like you were with me...
Every little hope inside,
surrounded by dust, no one can see...

A secret garden in the funeral,
and the soil calls (for our) dead love
roots of the crying flowers
Dried leaves of the trees,
poured over the grief,
souls of the hidden truth
uprise and scream,
In silence no one can hear...
A sapling appears on the ground
Shining dark and lonely
Embraces my rotten hopes
they are still black, forgotten, lost and hopeless...
