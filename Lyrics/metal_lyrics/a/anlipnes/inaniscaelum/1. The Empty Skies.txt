[Lyrics: V.P, St.Sea, Music: V.P]

This time IÂ´m falling down...
Senseless shadows,
I canÂ´t find you alive...
This time, your soul
Couldn't touch my sin
And everything inside my mind, flowing behind...

I have that sense, every time (of loneliness)â¦
Reflection of the pain in my eyes like little child.

The empty souls, of empty skies.
Hell in heaven, the bloody inside...
Everything belongs to something or to each other;
I`m sick of empty hopes
and drifting from one to another side,

Shaking tears of shaking souls,
how far the rain can fall, when I'm bleeding
(how much the wind can take from me)
getting closer to the edge but going faraway from you
Ash to ashes and dust to dusts,
White to black and days to night...
Am I just the lonely one, on this side?
