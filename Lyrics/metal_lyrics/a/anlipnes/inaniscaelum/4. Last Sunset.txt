[Lyrics: St.Sea, Music: V.P, B.Y]

Blowing mountains
took my serenity
and whispered me above...

The mist of desperation
Dripping down my skin...

The final word is said and done,
The story ends where it began.
You have to face the emptiness,
There is no way to talk it out.

Senseless bodies
lying under barren soils
the roaming is aimless.

The doors are closed and locked,
The air is full with blood,
You have to face the loneliness,
There is no way to hide out.

Empty souls
lying under vapid graves
screams are meaningless.

IÂ´m not saying goodbye
Even if they burn me.
IÂ´m not saying goodbye
Even if they whelm me.
IÂ´m not from them
You can not help me...
They will never make me fall.
