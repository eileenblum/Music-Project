Every four years we're promised a new resolution. A new sign of hope,
serial killers do on a small scale what the government does on a large one.
They are a product of time, these are the blood thirsty times. The truth is
the issue at hand refusing to feed the truth. Take a real good look at your
leader and tell me if you still see the fucking hope? When will all of you
realize that the future of the universwe will continue no matter what happens,
but the future of the human race and life on earth is much less certain. What
you all have fought,teared,and killed for is the very cause to your cancer.
You're being watched every single moment, where has your freedom gone? show me
the brave! I leave u with these words,"violent delights tends to have violent ends."
The mortal mind is a mystery itself. In a world with so many questions only
brings higher concerns. A clouded sky cant keep sings away. Soon enough the
truth will reveal itself. You can only do so much to keep civilization sane,
the sight will welcome the new reign as this opens a new chapter, for the tyrants.
And the final of man, consuumed one at a time to feed the wrath. To feed the wrath!
This isn't a message nor is it an annoucment its my fucking statement.
