Today I laid down to only come across memories that contained significance; moments of self-love, arguments, fulfill my heart,
I refuse to lose you
I can't be selfish and I will not hate, but bearing the thought of seeing you for the very last time
Isn't as easy as they make it or want it to be
I can't help but feel like everybody else, thinking
I could've said anything to prevent it all but thinking like that still doesn't bring you back
It doesn't matter how hard I stare at my own reflection but
I still come to the same conclusion that I never knew a thing about you
But if I could take anything out of this is that life will hand you unexpected circumstances that you can't control
I know the feeling of the world collapsing on you
Understand there's much more to life than to feel pain
Something isn't worth the value without fighting for or dying for it
Some say being happy in the moment is the best way we can be
Because forever is composed of now(s), forever is composed of now(s)
