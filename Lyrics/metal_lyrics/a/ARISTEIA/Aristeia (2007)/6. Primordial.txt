Secrecy can only lead to your deception but who am I to blame your actions for
I am the one who triggered your hate
I can't begin to regret and I'll hold tight to the faith
I got because I'll never falter or drown in failure
The worst mistake in life you can make is to not regret
You must not relent in pain or defeat
It can only sculpt you to be the person you're meant to be
I wonder if there could ever be a moment in such an existence that we have once described as vividly as your lips spoke it to be
The sensation of calmness overwhelming the broken shell
I call hate
Manifested hate
A society stuck on hate
Subtle differences separate our people
Bright futures turn into a gamble of life and death
We place them on the hands of the young and let religion do the rest
We allow a broken system and death walks free
What will it take for us to do something?
I feed of your fear and desolation
I'am your monarch
