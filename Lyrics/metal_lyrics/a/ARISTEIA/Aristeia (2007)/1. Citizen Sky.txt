Vengeance; a vengeance that can only reinstall honor
To a clan at the spill of your blood
I question how it was possible to install all of my trust
A pact of commitment tainted at the cost of ignorance and lust
Retire your arsenal and bow down to me
Take a close look at your environment
Revenge; revenge is never about the greater good
Revenge; revenge is never about the greater good
It's a visceral need that has to be satisfied
It's a visceral need that has to be satisfied
I can see that the broken are the evolved because out of sheer pain can one only accomplish what once was thought to be impossible (To be impossible)
If I could've had it my way
I'd blame myself solely accountable for all the misfortunes I brought upon you all
They say to begin one's self healing is to forgive yourself
Answer me how can one begin to (Justify)
My pathetic sense of trust
(Justify)
Every time I wanted your love (Justify)
Every inch of blood that I dropped (Justify)
The meaning to my heart
