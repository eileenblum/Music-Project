I ask myself everyday why?
Aggression
Aggression is the result of psychological defense against threats of fragmentation
As a result some people will dive into hate
I have had enough with seeking solace for others to approve
This identity is just another psychological illusion
Have you ever been torn apart by the people that you want rather than than the people you need?
It's gotten to a point where
I can only do wrong
I have torn a piece of my own soul
I'd rather be an honest sinner than to be known as a false saint
I wish you could all see how vulnerable we are
Sensitive minds and egos determine our lives
I've let all my hate speak and
I've let all my love be my ultimate demise
Understand that I see what you have when you close your eyes
I feel the spams in your heart each time you've felt alone
I too have yet to receive the warmth you're seeking
Do you represent your morals or do you represent egos?
Next time you feel the disbelief in your heart just take a breath, analyze your worth
Sink your feet into the sand and understand that there isn't any looking back
And as I say my final peace
I'd let you know that I didn't need you
I've come so far alone
So I say goodbye
