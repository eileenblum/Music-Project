Hatred, anxiety, every waking moment is a sudden urge of regret
I can't take any of it back
I keep telling myself that
I'll change and
I'll change
Time and time again
I've seen that
I'm full of shit
Consumed by hate, incapable to regret
Within seasons that empty dark feeling still remains the same
How is it that not a single fucking soul can remain sane?
How far and long ago have
I lost myself?
Take a moment and reflect
Answer truthfully if you believe your actions reflect any of that gracious loving character you think yourself to be?
Can you look at your child and confidently say that you set a golden standard to follow throughout your days of life?
When your world comes down crumbling everything you know and love is taken away from you without mercy
A familiar instinct of rage and hate
Vengeance comforts your soul
They'll call you leader
They'll call you savior
They will keep you in cages
They'll call you illegal
Have you felt enough of the hate to thrive off of it?
You have a choice for once
