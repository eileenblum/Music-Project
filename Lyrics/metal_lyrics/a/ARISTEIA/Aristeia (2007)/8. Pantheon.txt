Have you ever questioned your existence?
Because of lately doubt and hate are the only things I look forward to
I've done all that I could to keep this type of rage contained but
I've realized my mistakes were far too late
Death spares none and conquers all
Time waits for no one; realizing that
I took you in vain and now the pain remains but it's far too late
Nothing I do will bring you back
Even as the truth is in front of my eyes
I can't help but realize it is all a dream I have yet to be awoken from
I tell myself everything will change and everything has a purpose but
I come back to the conclusion that
I am no coward
Dwelling on these never-ending thoughts of a past that no longer exist but still the old wounds do not seem to resist
My visions were correct the whole time and now I know this to be true so
I'll wait for you
Even as the truth is in front of my eyes
I can't help but realize it is all a dream I have yet to be awoken from
