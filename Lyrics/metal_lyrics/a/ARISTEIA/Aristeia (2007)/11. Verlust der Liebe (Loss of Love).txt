Compromising for a resolution
Heavy eyes cloud the future ahead
Reminiscing on the good and bad
As I suffocate to time's sand
As I bring myself to that dark mental state
I slowly affiliate my hate and I begin to understand
The fucking pain that my actions may have caused
But for every minute and every step I take
I can never hesitate (Never hesitate)
To admit the thought or the fact that I loved you
Compromising for a resolution
Heavy eyes cloud the future ahead
Reminiscing on the good and bad
As I suffocate to time's sand
Looking back at it all
It's kind of hard to muster up the words to explain my actions but words with no conviction aren't worth your time
Emotion, perspective, and where I fit into this world
Each day gets harder and harder to sit alone with my thoughts
For once everything made sense
Every moment felt right
A desperate attempt to forget
Where do I belong in this world?
