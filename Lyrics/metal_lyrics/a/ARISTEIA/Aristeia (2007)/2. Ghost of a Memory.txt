Holy mother
I beg for your forgiveness
I am living proof that we are all the fucking same
Judgment passes through will and grace
Hate, a universal language
Never bow, never resent
Never idolize a false pretense
In this lifetime we all have one vision to claim
Raw intentions are claimed and are imprinted into the roots of our evil
Apathy
Satan's grasp will doubt.
Don't lose faith, never falter
Don't lose faith, never falter
It was a soul made for loving
She came to me, she meant much more to me
She held the pain I did not want to keep
Destroyed by hate and greed
She was my soul, my place of worship
She was my home and it's tearing my heart
Roaming endlessly, while safe way wonders is where you are
Not of pure blood
Not of pure blood
There's no meaning to justify your profit or gain off of war
Philosophy, resources, religion, hate, revenge or love
No matter how pitiful or trivial your motives are, they're all worthy causes for war
War will be endless cycle and reasons for it can be found later
Human nature seeks conflict
Human nature seeks conflict
War is a needed evil to maintain steady balance
