I see a light and feel no regret on the infinite path to the other side
I'm left with these nightmares to pretend
I feel something besides pain, hate, and sorrow
Is this something
I'am destined to be?
These visions don't seem to go away
I must find an answer
I must find a reason to leave something behind to make sense of all this madness
My imprint on Earth will be all that's left of my struggles
I'am more than just living flesh
I have realized myself that
I will not let go of what once was
With a sense of isolation
I used to think I had it all
But now my back is against the wall
You don't feel for the things you've done
It's only a matter of time that you justify your actions
Projecting your insecurities to other people have only let me open my eyes
Clear as daylight
I see that your actions are beyond control
Respect is something you never gave yourself and something you desperately seek in others
I'am the roots grow in the dark
To exist with no reason is the same as laying dead
Angels banished from the heavens have no choice but to become demons
Fuck your kingdom and it's followers
I'd rather burn in hell
