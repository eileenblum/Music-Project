Civilization spoke of a time where the world was brought down to it's knees. Catastrophic events that dismantled an empire. And reconstructed the face the face of the planet. These are not premonitions but a warning we choose to ignore. This world is shit and condemned
to extinction. Mortals are nothing more than puppets being fed the idea we call realty, when the truth is in front of you. Open your eyes and see the actuality. We are all imprisoned in our own dreams. Violence to fuel the hatred in society. Corruption of the leaders of
a new era clouded by the extinct to survive. Modern man will collapse and the new species that have overruled will take rightful throne.
