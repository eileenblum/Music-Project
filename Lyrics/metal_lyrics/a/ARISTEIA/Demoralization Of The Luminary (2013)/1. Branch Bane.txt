They articulate minds
pray for your life
It's a psychic weapon to blind evil from all the majesty
and beauty that is creation
masses are easily manipulated into participating in rituals
for entertainment and collection
corrupt men collect wealth from world affairs
They're all under mind control
Patterns are everywhere, they're around us all
You can see it when you turn on your television
Why can't you grasp the vision outside your window?
outside your window
Brothers and sisters tonight marks a war to claim
of what was once ours
It's about time for all of you to realize what this brotherhood has done to our nation
