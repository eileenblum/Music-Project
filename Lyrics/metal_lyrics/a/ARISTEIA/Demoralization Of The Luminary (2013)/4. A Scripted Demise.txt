Immortalize the name for it will mean traitor in different tongues
Those who oppose, brun in my gates
"My god; another mistake and the rules have changed"
Did you really believe it was a misfortune?
Everything fell accordingly under my word
Sacrifices will be at at all cost
Sacrifices will be...met!
Desired memories collapse; are shattering within your inner, losing effort
Raise sanity, slowly but surely, you'll fall into the lies I claim
You've reached a cycle that I can't ash now
Break or bash the cycle that I can't ash now
Stipulations have prevented any investments
They have our throats; claimed all your throats
