DELUSIONAL IMAGES HAVE BOUGHT THE MASSES
AND MATERIALISM IS SPOKEN IN ACTION
EVERYTHING WON'T JUST FALL IN PLACE
A DILEMMA WHERE WE ALL FACE THE SAME FATE
MOMENTARILY EVERY MAN'S DISGUSTING DESIRE
IS NOT TO BE REMEMBERED AS A HISTORICAL FIGURE,
BUT A GOD
THESE NARCISSISTIC WASTES OF VITALITY ARE THE
CAUSE TO HUNGER, THEY ARE THE PRODUCT OF DOOM
STEP IN LINE TO THE PATH THAT HAS BEEN DRAWN OUT FOR YOU
SUCCEED THEM IN THEIR PLEASURES AND FUEL THE BLOOD DIAMOND
THE CHOICE IS YOURS
TIMES WILL NOT CHANGE WITHOUT ANY DESIRE
DELUSIONAL IMAGES HAVE BOUGHT THE MASSES AND
MATERIALISM IS SPOKEN IN ACTION

[SPEECH:]
ACCEPT THE OFFER THAT STANDS
A NEVER ENDING TALE OF RICHES AND GLORY AWAIT YOU
DO WHAT'S NECESSARY AND IGNORE YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS
WILL YOU DIE FORGOTTEN BY THE ONES YOU LOVE?
OR WILL YOU LEAVE A LEGACY BEHIND? TIMES WILL NOT CHANGE WITHOUT ANY DESIRE
SOMETHING THEY'VE LEFT YOU ALL WITHOUT.
