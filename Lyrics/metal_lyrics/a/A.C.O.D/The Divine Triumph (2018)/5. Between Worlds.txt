Black sand under my feet
Living nonsense reality
Feeling eyes in dark
Smiling monsters spy on me
Hundreds whispers haunting this place,
Horrors and monsters with no face
No way back, nowhere to hide.
How can I die?

Far away I see the shores
Behind the mist, between worlds

Show me the way
Show me the way
To die

Stronger and stronger
Strange voice come,
Strange laughs are now in my head
Disturbed reality
Sweet cold last bed
Hundreds whispers are haunting this place,
Horrors and monsters with no face
No way back, nowhere to hide.
How can I die?

Far away I see the shores
Behind the mist, between worlds

Show me the way
Show me the way
Inside

Now I see
A shadow behind the mist
Vision of light in a world of obscurity
Oh don't go,
Show me the way,
Oh please don't go,
We shall go away
In the dark
I'll find you

Trapped here for eternity
Trapped in a world of obscurity

It's time to leave the stream
To change nightmare to a dream
The time to leave
Changing nightmare to a dream
