There is nothing more for me here, nothing to live
The colors of the world have disappeared

Into a pit
Far away from the sun
Empty and cold
As I am
Hope is dead
Waiting for the kiss of death

There is nothing new for me here, nothing to see
No color, no color in this world.

All is darkness
Everywhere

Lost far away from my soul
Lost far away from my home
Far away, far away from, far away from hope
Lost far away from my soul
Lost far away from my home

The knife, the throat, the lamb

Angels sing
The knife on the neck
Angels laugh
The lamb bleeds to death
The last cold kiss

One more pill
The pain away
One more pill
To go away, away...
