Eyes to see
Surrounded by walls
Nothing to scream
Nothing gets out
No one to call

Don't want to pray
Nothing to say
With blind eyes of our broken life we see, we see

Too late to say goodbye

Live the moment
Never be broken
And never forget your dreams
Live the moment
Never be broken
Nothing can break you down

A long night close to you
Surrounded by pain
Nothing to scream
Nothing gets out
No god to call

Don't want to pray
Nothing to say
Close your blind eyes of your broken life and sleep, and sleep

Too late to say goodbye

Live the moment
Never be broken
And never forget your dreams
Live the moment
Never be broken
And nothing can break you down
Live the moment
Never be broken
Nothing, nothing, nothingâ¦
Your dreams

What can I do?
What can I do?
How long to live?
What do I have to do?
All I can do is holding you,
Talking into your ears, not caring about tears
Making wishes that will never come true
One last time a moment with you
To promise we'll meet again and forever
Be with you

A long journey in hell,
A long journey into the nightâ¦
The sad dawn
The morning you left

Live the moment
Never be broken
And never forget your dreams
Live the moment
Never be broken
Nothing can break you down
Live the moment
Never be broken
Nothing, nothing, nothingâ¦
Nothing can break you down

So down
