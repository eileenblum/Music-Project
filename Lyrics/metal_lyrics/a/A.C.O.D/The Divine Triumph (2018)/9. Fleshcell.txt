There's no light here
Trapped, chained in a cell
I can't say if my eyes are closed or open
I can't say if I exist

The light comes
The light dies
It will never reach my soul

Inside
Under my flesh
My thoughts are dead

Inside
The cell of my flesh
My body is dead

The light comes
The light dies
It will never reach my soul

My soul, my soul, my soul, my soul, my soulâ¦.

Somewhere far away
Far away from light
