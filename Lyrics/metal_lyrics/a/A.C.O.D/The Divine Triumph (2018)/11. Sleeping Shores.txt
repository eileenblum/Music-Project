On dark waters we sail
Who cannot fail?
Sins and death everywhere
Who accept to burn in hell?

For the light
For life
For the dawn
To the light
To the dawn
To the shores.
For the light
For life
For the dawn
To the light
To the dawn
To the shores.

Furious waves
Ghosts of the past smile to me
Storm blaze the sky
Gods of the sea reject me

On dark waters we drift away
All nights, day after day

Nothing, nothing around
Who cannot fall down?

A deadly silence
Floating between life and death
Falling asleep
Between life and death

For the light
For life
For the dawn
To the light
To the dawn
To the shores.
For the light
For life
For the dawn
To the light
To the dawn
To the shores.
