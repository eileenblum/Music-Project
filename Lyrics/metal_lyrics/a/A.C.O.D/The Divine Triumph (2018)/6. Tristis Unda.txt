Warm winds carry the dust of time,
Burning the face of this world
The path disappears,
Nothing remains,
There is only unknown

The cold emptiness,
The cold terror,
The cold darkness,
The call of doom

On dark water we sail
On dark water we sail

Heartbeats are loud,
So loud in my head,
So strong in my chest

In dark water we swim
In dark water we swim
We drown

Will you confess your sins?
Sins?
My sins are who I am.

I woke up, naked and free
Black is the place
I woke up, so angry
Dark is the place

See the long march of the souls
Through the valley of darkness
All of them want to wake up in heaven
But sometimes the dawn will be darker than the night.

I woke up, naked and free
Black is the place
I woke up, so angry
Dark is the place
