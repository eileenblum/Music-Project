My place in hell
Where all is pain
With no light
With no sky
It's my place in hell,
Where fire and evil burn my flesh
Devour my soul

Upside down world
Just one escape
Diving in the sky

I see when
The sun has died
Red highlights
My sun has died

My place in hell
Where all is pain
With no light
With no sky
It's my place in hell,
Where fire and evil burn my flesh
Devour my soul

Sanity falls when life and death are one
Sanity falls where up become down,
To live and die both

Go

The way
Crush myself
That way
Break my mind

They are here
They are hunting me
Horrors behind my back

Tomorrow is yesterday
Always the same day
Condemn to pay

They are here
They are hunting me
Horrors behind my back

My place in hell
Where all is pain
With no light
With no sky
It's my place in hell,
Where fire and evil burn my flesh
Devour my soul

Sanity falls when life and death are one
Sanity falls to live and die both
