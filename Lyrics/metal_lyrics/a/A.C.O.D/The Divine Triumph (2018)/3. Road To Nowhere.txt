We live a dream in black and white
Can't you see? Can't you see?
Lonely silence, long nightmare
Life has disappeared

There's no cross on the hill
Nothing but silence
More questions than answers
More blood than water

Fear and pain and despair
On the road to nowhere

On the road to nowhere

We walk
With closed eyes
With dead eyes
A cold light in our hands

Fear and pain and despair
On the road to nowhere
Fear, pain, despair
On the road to nowhere

I've seen things you people wouldn't believe
The after life
The procession of dead souls
I saw an endless hell
I understood why we are afraid of darkness
Now my soul is sick

I see
Deadlights in the black
I feel
Shadows in my back
I see
Deadlights in the black
I feel
Shadows in my back
I see
Deadlights in the black
