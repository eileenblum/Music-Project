Hundreds of steps to a great door
To find what I'm looking for
Half alive, half dead
Hundreds of strange stars are shining upon my head

Tales of rise and fall
The divine triumph
Songs of rise and fall
The divine triumph

Where are the gods of men?
Blind and powerless
Say amen
To be blessed
Half alive, half dead
The stars become eyes upon my head

Thunder on the place
Ready for face to face
To watch this god in the eyes
Be alive, not dead
Gloomy tears are falling on my head

Tales of rise and fall
The divine triumph
Songs of rise and fall
The divine triumph

It's here
It came from the depths

From the depths

You are a heresy
You are nothing here
Life is your sin

In your eyes I will stick my claws
You will bleed until your skull will be crushed
From your mouth will tear your tongue out
You'll can't ask to die
I ll burn your flesh
I ll drown your soul
You will know that I write eternity
My eternity

Worst than hell
Pain without end
Their faces in my head
Worst than hell
Pain without end
Forever their faces in my head
