Go away
Go away from me
From the dark I can rise
The chains my mind can break

The dark days, the long days
For a long way

A white ray, the light day
Voices come to me
Showing the path
Take me far away
To the surface
The surface

Beyond depths

The dark days, the long days
For a long way

I follow the voices, the sing of mermaids
This world burn my eyes, this world where nothing lives
Worst than life or hell

Beyond depths

Everyday on my way

To run away from pain
To run away from silence

Do not stop

The dark days, the long days
For a long way

A white ray, the light day
Voices come to me
Showing the path
Take me far away
To the surface
The surface

Beyond depths

Everyday, on my way, every, every fucking day

Your voice is the key
A shiny star in the dark
It's breaking the silence, no more cold silence
I forgot the light, I forgot the dawn

Dead hands
Dead heart

Dead hands
Dead heart

Waves crashing on the rocks
