We had the world
All for us
And the doors
Had just been opened
Just one step still to make
But you have shut all your doors
We will never know the reason
All too much to bear

At a whiff from goal
You disappear
We were a little family
And I'm still waiting for a call

But all the memories still hurt
I am burning fast
But I think I'm dying
Because of you

My heart is still under your knives
I'm crashing down
You'll see that I'm disarmed
My heart is still under your knives
I'm crashing down
You'll see that I'm disarmed

Though I want to know why
Though I want to know why

After all I've done
After all I've done

All I've done
All I've done

I've always given you everything
Now this end is what you deserve
Now the time
Will be your enemy
And every beat of your heart
Will remind you the shame
You finally arrived
And this hour is for you

My heart is still under your knives
I'm crashing down
You'll see that I'm disarmed
My heart is still under your knives
I'm crashing down
You'll see that I'm disarmed

Though I want to know why
Though I want to know why

After all I've done
After all I've done

All I've done
All I've done
