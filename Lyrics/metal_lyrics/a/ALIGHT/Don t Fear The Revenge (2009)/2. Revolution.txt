Now I belong to the wrong
Of this world
Cause my innocence died
Mother earth
Just preserve me
Into your soul
Save me
Into your heart

This can go on more and more
I need to save it revolution
It's the only way I have

Sometimes I need to come out
I believe in
Revolution
It's the only way I have

Give, give me a dream I want live
Give me the strength to fight
Please help me to fight

Give, give me a dream I want live
Give me the strength to fight
Please help me to fight

Only through you
I will live forever
You will remember me
As long as someone
Get your vibes
And feelings
So alive
Cause everything
Fades away

Sometimes I need to come out
I believe in
Revolution
It's the only way I have

Give, give me a dream I want live
Give me the strength to fight
Please help me to fight

Give, give me a dream I want live
Give me the strength to fight
Please help me to fight
