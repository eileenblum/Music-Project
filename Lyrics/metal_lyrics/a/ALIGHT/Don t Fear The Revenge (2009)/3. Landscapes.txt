The sun comes down
And I sit here
Before I go
My eyes will have the sorrow

Everything is crashing down
I can't save more than a reason to die
I wish I could open my eyes
And let you know disasters
How to run after life
If all is crashing down
Have I been alive

God will not save any dream
How much it grows
Before my eyes?
Destruction kills all this time
I can't live it no more

Everything is crashing down
I can't save more than a reason to die
I wish I could open my eyes
And let you know disasters
How to run after life
If all is crashing down
Have I been alive

Rhythm of spring
I can't dance
It is still a cold winter

I can't live it no more
