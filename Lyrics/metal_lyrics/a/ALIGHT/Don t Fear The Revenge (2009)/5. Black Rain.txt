I live your most secret dream
All is true what I see
Hard enough to believe
When your heart stands before my eyes
It can't stop raining from the sky
You're the cold black rain

Now I'm falling down
Cover me now
One time again
Come cover the ground
Cover me now and never end

You come to fill up my worries
Like a drug in my own thoughts
You're a hope in the madness
I get down but I won't stop

You don't know how I need you
How much love I got for you
I'm fool and thirsty
You control me by desire
Now this strength is killing me again
Embrace my soul

The power is possessing me
The power is possessing me

Transform my heart into a stone
My breath is dying away
You will win again
Black rain until the end

And I'm the taste of your disease
Though I want to believe in you
You're killing me
But I can't stand the temptation to call
The black rain again
Still comes strong
To fill my veins

Now I'm falling down
Cover me now
One time again
Come cover the ground
Cover me now and never end

Wash away the time
I'm a prisoner inside
Take me to the light
Then I'll rise
