Please don't forget
The past
Don't forget I'm lonely
Forget I'm falling
Tonight
Lost in these memories

Help me
I give you all my feelings
Come on and take me
Away from here

And when my hope becomes Alight
I'm alive
Cause I found my soul
And now I feel so good inside
I'll try
To have it forever more

Forever lost
Never more
Forever lost
Never more

Here I stand
I compare
All I see with all I am
I am lost
So alone
Forever

And when my hope becomes Alight
I'm alive
Cause I found my soul
And now I feel so good inside
I'll try
To have it forever more

Lost between many faces
Between the nothing
All my tears are falling
Forever fall
Forever help me
I give you all
My feelings
Come on and take me
Away from here

And when my hope becomes Alight
I'm alive
Cause I found my soul
And now I feel so good inside
I'll try
To have it forever more
