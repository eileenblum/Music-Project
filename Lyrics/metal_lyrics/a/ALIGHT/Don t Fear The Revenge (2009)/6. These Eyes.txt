They are still very innocent
Not afraid of anything
But they want to know
How to come
Inside of you

When I saw you the first time
It was the first time I knew
How to be someone special
How to believe in the truth
As the promise became you
I've never thought it could be
So easy to fall in
Into another me

You can drive my eyes
Across the silence
Of my soul
Can hold the sky
And keep the answer
Forever over
These eyes

You are coming out of shades
Like the sun dries the rain
I am crying and still afraid
There's something
Next to change

The first time I saw you
I was lost in a dream
More real than illusions
Soul was telling to me
As the promise became you
I realized it could be
So easy to fall in
Into another me

You can drive my eyes
Across the silence
Of my soul
Can hold the sky
And keep the answer
Forever over
These eyes

Love or hate
No idea
It's far away
But near to me
Love or hate
No idea
It's far away
Near to me

The first time I saw you
I was lost in a dream
More real than illusions
Soul was telling to me
As the promise became you
I realized it could be
So easy to fall in
Into another me

You can drive my eyes
Across the silence
Of my soul
Can hold the sky
And keep the answer
Forever over
These eyes
