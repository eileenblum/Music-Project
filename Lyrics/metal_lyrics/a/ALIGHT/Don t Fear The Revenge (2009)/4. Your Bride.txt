Today I can buy
Two flowers and cry
Two tears to preserve
This time
Has arrived
And I can't deny
Your self once again
You promised me life
This will never end
I confess I am scared
This seal lasts forever
My heart will never belong to you

In this moment I come into
A promise of words
I have never meant for you
Night after night
I'll lose my wisdom
I am still so far from freedom

It can be my ending
My heart will surrender

When I'll see your face
Affected by time
Instead you ask me why
You must keep me blind
For hours and days
My memories untold
I don't give you more
Then my fears and lies
This day has arrived
And I just won't care
You can't take my hands
My beloved has left

It can be my ending
My heart will surrender

In this moment I come into
A promise of words
I have never meant for you
Night after night
I'll lose my wisdom
I am still so far from freedom

And I can't deny
Your self once again
You promised me life
This will never end
I confess I am scared
This seal lasts forever
My heart will never belong to you
This day has arrived
And I just won't care
You can't take my hands
My beloved has left

It can be my ending
My heart will surrender
It can be my ending
My heart will surrender
