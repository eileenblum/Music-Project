[Lyrics: Roy Zumbado]

Have you ever been condemned to decadence,
And annihilation in a sick world of hate
Constantly threatened by lightâ¦

â¦ And  destruction forces of omnipotence 
A thousand words ring in your ears
For youâll get used to this uncalled-for suffering
And endless punishment

No reason, no grace
For false redemption
Mortification of the flesh to purify spirits
Sadistic rites consummating your godâs desires

Prepare to burn in the âcleansingâ fire
A paradox of deliverance, casted by the ignorant eye
Wretched generations of worshippers of the kings of lie
But beware whatâs inside for they are not your owners,
Fanatic pigs and liars.
