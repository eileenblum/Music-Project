[Lyrics: Max Gutierrez, Roy Zumbado]

Here I stand against your tide of filth and corruption
With hate and confidence,
Your dogmas I here to deny
Time consumes my life all that remains just strengthen my soul
Iâm the king of my realm, I am faith, I am evil, Iâm God.

Beyond all forms forever still,
So I am
So let us break into revenge,
Striking fear into tour hearts

Beyond all forms forever still,
So I am
No forgiveness, no compassion

Retribution, the drive of justice
The strive for vengeance

Tearing through disdain and glory
Pictures of drowning blood run in my eyes
And burns eternal hatred inside the blazing of my flesh, untied!
It canât be stopped, it battles your deception
The blackest moment for you approaches with words of venom unleashed

Here I stand against your tide of filth and corruption
With hate and confidence,
Your dogmas I here to deny
What pains your souls does nothing but strengthen mine,
Fall on your knees sick and feeble!
Iâve seen enough of your pitiful essence
Your lies wonât save you now,
Eye for an eye!

Striking fear into your heart.
Beyond all forms, forever still,
So I am
It is time for vengeance.
