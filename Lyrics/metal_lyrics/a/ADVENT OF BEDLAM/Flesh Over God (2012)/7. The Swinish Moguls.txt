[Lyrics: Roy Zumbado, Isak Arroyo]

Depictions of vain revelations
Obsessions to divert the patterns of the wicked,
Sick and depraved.

Offering the path of virtue, at a cost.
For a place in heaven, in exchange of your goods,
Salvation sells greatly!

Led by greed and power,
These swines, play with your lives and put them a price.
Downtroddenâs dementia
They steal in front of your eyes
The swinish Moguls have nothing to fear.

Whatâs  been done to suppress your mind, youâre to blind to see.
Sanctified by the poison of distortion to become their martyr
Your soul disappears,

Led by greed and power.

A beast of thousand tongues, here lies in the disguise
The house of god is yours, for a price
In the business of faith, the fearful equals income.

Depictions of vain revelations
A witchâs hunt, pay or then youâll be pray
Forever damnation.
