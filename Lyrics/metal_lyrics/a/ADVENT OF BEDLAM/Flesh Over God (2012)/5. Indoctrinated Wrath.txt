[Lyrics:  Roy Zumbado]

Fanatic obsessions, menâs demise
Tied to your lies and your sins
Consuming your flesh
Excruciated parasite!

Blindly, pursuing the truth
As the ashes of that what was taught from the cradle.
You mindless shell!

Do you think you are the only one?
All of you are under control
(You) obey their orders
You fanatic cunt! Waste of life
Look at the world there is no god!

Blindly, pursuing the truth
As the ashes of that what was taught from the cradle.
You hypocrite!

Oh archaic writings, taken from pagan times
Designed to explain what cannot be explained.
We are in kingdom of the blind, he who seeks salvation
Will find himself lost in lies.
And then I see you praying to the unknown,
Only to return to deviance
Indoctrinated wrath,
Wrath!!!!
