[Lyrics: Roy Zumbado, Isak Arroyo]

Faith goes away, without knowing whether itâs day or night
It disappears in the waters of mystery
I canât see anything but stains of light

I disguise my ideas so I wonât contradict them
I act cautiously so I wonât be alone
Heading to the disintegration of myself
A cursed echo is embedded in my soul
Slowly rotting, gazing upon a curious face
Until I find myself in oblivionâ¦

A false sense of oneâ self, a hallow excuse for a life
Becoming unconscious , an object for them to sell.
