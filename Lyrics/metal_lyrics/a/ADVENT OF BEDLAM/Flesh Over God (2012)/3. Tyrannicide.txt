[Lyrics: Roy Zumbado]

Feel the void of them gambling your life just like their own possession
And youâre part of a game of disdain, a business of war
Who made you believe that you run your own life?
Youâre pawn, nothing more.

Make a stand, youâll see the outcome
Cannot live our lives drowned in ignorance
Kill the man behind the curtain
Take his pride away
Arise forevermore and on and on.

Morbid plans to conquer all, to curse, erase and crush us
Resist! In dispraise, this ordeal will meet its end
Come forth, it is time, liberate, tyrannicide!

Bound to nothingness, but who decides?
Rebellious times have come, this is it.

Twisted plans made to control your life just to increase their oppression
And youâre part of a game of contempt, a business of faith
Who made you believe that you run your own life?
Youâre pawn, nothing more.

Make a stand, youâll see the outcome
Cannot live our lives drowned in ignorance
Kill the man behind the curtain
Take his pride away
Arise forevermore and on and onâ¦
