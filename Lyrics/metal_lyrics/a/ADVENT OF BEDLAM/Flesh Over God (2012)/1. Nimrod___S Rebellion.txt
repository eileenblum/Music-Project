[Lyrics: Roy Zumbado, Max Guitierrez]

The aberration of ignorance
Plays judge to the human race.
False paradise! I cannot stand this falseness.

To walk the path of the ever-dark
âUnworldlyâ deception
Follow your god or die?

I will serve no god!
Letâs burn the book of lies!

Disbelieve their doctrines!
Dogmas must enlighten instead of blinding.
Use your own instinct
Choose flesh over god!

Itâs time to rise,
Believe in nothing but yourself.
(The) gates are open now,
Let the worms go down under the wrath.

I am the master of my own fate,
I am the one who decides,
The Bearer of wisdom,
Rebellion in the air.

The aberration of ignorance
Plays judge of the human race.
False paradise!
I cannot stand this madness.

I will serve no god!
Letâs burn the book of lies!

Disbelieve their doctrines!
Dogmas must enlighten instead of blinding.
Use your own instinct
Choose flesh over god!

Divine deceivers end,
Theyâve drowned in their own humiliation,
Condemned to see themselves tearing apart
From their own vicious ways.
