Deep down in the driest lands
Tales of wars, tales of ourselves.

Seeds of civilization,
An untold past,
Tyrants, heroes, kings and men.

Shamanism, eyeless visions
Once green, now dead.
Altered mind, hallucinations of old shamans,
Old shamans!

Creatures of yore,
Ageless tales of life and death
Prototypes of gods

ItÂ´s in our nature to transcend ourselves.
Hallucination, Imagination, But Could it be?
a tricked mind or a portrait in time
Ignorant of our own roots

Tassili NÂ´ajjer!

Different names, different times
Rounded masks, rituals? Could it be?

Creatures of yore
Ageless tales of life and death
Prototypes of gods

Riding on chariots of light,
ships from the sky
