[Music: Advent of Bedlam, lyrics: Roy Zumbado C.]

At the abyss of what's ignored,
Connected with cosmos,
In denying everything,
I've found myself,

Human sickness,
Reflected in hopelessness,
A maze, so hard to complete,
Transmuting oscillation in virtue,
Confusing evidence, illogical coincidence.

Embraced by shadows of fear,
Feeling paralyzed, awake, but hopeless,
Helpless,
Only then have I seen,
True horror to its eyes.

A liar's spit,
Connected with cosmos,
In denying everything,
I've found myself.
Human sickness,
Reflected in hopelessness.

Hopelessness.
In fear, we live,
It's pain, we feel,
Deceived from start,
By humankind
