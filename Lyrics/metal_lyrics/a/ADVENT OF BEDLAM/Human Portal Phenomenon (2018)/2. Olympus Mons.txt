[Music: Advent of Bedlam, lyrics: Roy Zumbado C.]

And so they say, "Only the dead have seen the end of war."
A spell, a curse.

Nations and kingdoms and villages alike.
Over the centuries,
As old as we are,
A pest.

Disruption,
Destruction,
Disease.
Everywhere.
Over the centuries.

The spear hits us with the nature of mankind.
Consume, expand, to fight and condemn.
Homo Homini Lupus.

The present, the future, the past.
Are portraits that will never last,
A flame, change occurs through war forever.
A cycle, a game.

Breathing vicious greed,
Violence, hatred, and enmity.
It's a plot.

We live in mount Olympus.
The highest peak of war.

Disruption,
Destruction,
Disease.
Everywhere.
Over the centuries.

The present, the future, the past.
Are portraits that will never last,
A flame, change occurs through war forever.
A cycle, a game.
