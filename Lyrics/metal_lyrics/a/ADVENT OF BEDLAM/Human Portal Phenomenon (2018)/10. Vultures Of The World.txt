[Music: Advent of Bedlam, lyrics: Roy Zumbado C.]

Quick to silence,
Quick to indoctrinate,
Incisive, rapacious,
Debt is the chain.

Ever growing madness,
Voracity.

A turn, in the wrong direction,
Vultures of the world.

Energy is for sale.
And so it will remain.

Melted our wings, close to the sun.
And so it will remain.

Energy is for sale.
And so it will remain.

Quick to silence,
Quick to eliminate,
Incisive, rapacious,
Debt is the way.

Controlling cycle,
Debt is their way
