[Music: Advent of Bedlam, lyrics: Roy Zumbado C.]

Essence over forms,
Traveling through the valley of cognition,
Remnants, imagination,
Of which I am king.

Are you even there?
"There is no self, there is the world"
[Jean Piaget]

Am I even present here?
Born of synapses.

Alternate consciousness,
Substance over mind,
Higher and higher I wonder,
Are you even there?
Am I even here?
Solus Ipse.

Traveling through the mist of perception,
Letting insights grow inside,
Remnants, imagination,
Of which I am king.

Alternate consciousness,
Substance over mind,
Higher and higher I wonder,
Are you even there?
Am I even here?
Solus Ipse.

An audience of one,
A theater of self,
The universe and I
