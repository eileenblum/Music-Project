[Music: Advent of Bedlam, lyrics: Roy Zumbado C.]

Famine is ruling our land,
Murder or starvation,
Choose well then, there is no escape,
Heading to human self-destruction,
No hideaway, no shelter,
A human farm.

The rich feeds on the poor's angst,
Distress and desperation,
Don't expect the law to help,
You know they've all been bought,

No hideaway, no shelter,
Who runs this show?

Sold for your spare parts,
A dad sells his daughter to be raped, abused and killed.
There's money in prison, fresh organs, no questions asked.
Why is greed such a massive pest,
Will it go away?
We are predators,
We are the prey.

Pain and terror,
Daily grief and atrocities,
Planned executions,
No trial, your fate's been sealed.

How could you put a price on life?
A cornea, a liver, intact, as fresh as it gets,
We're discreet, sadistic proposition,
As long as you pay beforehand.
As long as you pay beforehand

Famine is ruling our land,
Murder or starvation,
Choose well then, there is no escape,
Heading to human self-destruction,
No hideaway, no shelter,
A human farm.

The rich feeds on the poor's angst,
Distress and desperation,
Don't expect the law to help,
You know they've all been bought,
No hideaway, no shelter,
Who runs this show?

Black blood is running through your veins,
Your fate is sealed unless you're wealthy,
Black market's never closed.

Corrupted bastards,
Another heart you say?
There is no waiting list,
We have the finest and cheapest organs you will see,
You'll see.

Sold for your spare parts,
A dad sells his daughter to be raped, abused and killed.
There's money in prison, fresh organs, no questions asked.
Why is greed such a massive pest,
Will it go away?
We are predators,
We are the prey
