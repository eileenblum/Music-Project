[Music: Advent of Bedlam, lyrics: Roy Zumbado C.]

Oh, humans they were called,
Quite an interesting race to know,
Territorial, afraid,
On wheels of pride,
Which spin no more,
No more.

Let there be chaos,
Let there be blood,
Across the nations,
Let the wound seal,
Leave a scar instead,
Death to all.

Blazing horizon,
On chariots of fire,
Which burn no more,
No more.

Crude, fierce, afraid.
Unconscious and devious,
Insane.

Falling to pieces,
Full of flaws,

Let there be chaos,
Let there be blood,
Across the nations,
Let the wound seal,
Leave a scar instead,
Death to all
