[Music: Advent of Bedlam, lyrics: Roy Zumbado C.]

Out to seek and control,
What's said and done is embedded in the eye,
The ever-watchful eye.

It owns your words, it owns your thoughts,
Hateful manufacturer of truth,
To manipulate the masses,
Welcome to the era when the sheep became herd.

Rehabilitated thought criminals,
The will of power is gone, a new age,
A new age has begun.

To be, to feel,
To think as we're programmed.
Across the echoes of pain,
I suffocate.

It's in your mind, since you were born,
Watching everything that you do,
Pain, for which there's no anesthesia,
Suppression, extreme constraint.

Why would you believe so blindly everything and every word you're told?
There is no shelter,
This is a prison,
Under the sun.

Is the world theirs, or ours to keep?
Have we been tamed or could we fight?

Enslaved without knowing it,
Do really think this is your life?
Feel the stare of the ever-watchful eye.

Deprived, deserted,
Abandoned by your inner self,
Broken, torn out.

Is the world theirs, or ours to keep?
Have we been tamed or could we fight?

To be, to feel,
To think as we're programmed,
Across the echoes of pain,
I suffocate
