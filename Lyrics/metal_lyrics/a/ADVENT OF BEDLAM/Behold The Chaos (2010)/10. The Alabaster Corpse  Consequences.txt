[Concept &amp; Lyrics: Alberto Montero Coverston / Consequences composed by: Isak.]

âI awoke damning the light and knowing that I'm all alone
the darkened room's silver light,
('tis) a darkness so subtle
I (can) still see
The ghosts of all that has passed and come from our one tryst
The burrow's humid and warm
but the cold is so deep in my bones

My naked skin is peeling
attempting to shed what was once the mark of your scent on my flesh
Revolting is this feeling
A haunting I cannot embrace
nor escape from at all...
Such emptiness!
Alone I stand and heaving
adrift on a sea of inadequate foam
covering all (and) corroding me

I can't stand my sight
I must seek the night
bury my damned feelings I must kill my illusions,
I... I hope for burning skies rather than this pain!

Sanity's such a joke when one is broken!
Feelings are such a drag,
a bastard-god's little token!
I am no one at all!
Don't bother to know me!
A soiled mangle of lies...
I scream but nobody listens!
Embracing my deepest fearsâ¦
And I' m left with nothing!
My words are spent in a dream
for one that doesn't believe them...
(I'm) raping the love of my once giving soul!

If only light would not make you blind
then maybe I could know you!
If only I could bring down the sky
and make the seas tempestuous! (...)â
