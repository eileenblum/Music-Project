[Concept: Esteban. Lyrics: Esteban, Roy, Max.]

âYou are afraid to speak up
Their words are your only command
Confine your thoughts, restrict your words
fixed to my vision of life

Theyâll tear you down
Right to your knees, thatâs how you will live your lifeÂ 
Opposition, contradiction, inside

You are afraid to lose your soul
So you pay tribute to your god
Become a slave of their own creed
â¦Of their greedy lord

Welcome to the reign of oppression
Doctrines of fear translate into world domination

(You) Doubt your fate; (you) think youâre lost,Â 
Taught to yield and paralyzeÂ 
You know itâs time to surrender your mind

Theyâll tear you down
Right to your knees, thatâs how you will live your lifeÂ 
Opposition, contradiction inside you

Destroying your illusions and your thoughts
Drifting away from your soulÂ 

Submission, damnation, the pest you breathe!

Welcome to the reign of oppression
Doctrines of fear translate into world domination

Into their game you will fall forever and ever again
âtill the blindfolded justice arrives
Youâve lost your voice; youâve lost your vote
(Youâre) living by the plans of a few.
Free will is lost, freedom is gone.â
