[Concept: Max, Lyrics: Roy.]

"Smell the blood, from deep inside,
(And) the rotten sounds of uncounted lies,
Innocence fades away
Iniquities, masters of your life
A lying tongue and haughty eyes, violent and filthy whores
Collecting sins from within the womb, All the way into the tomb.

Under my skin, the hatred dwells
Scornful, tainted with unrighteous lore
Misfortune in my eyes, (I) can't feel no more
Scorched in pain, forever aghast!
Nowhere to run, can't escape our fate
For this we are, Vessels of Sin!

Our own transgressions will haunt us, the scum of the earth
for weâve been indulged in sin for the eternity

"The smell of blood, from deep inside,
(And) the rotten sounds of uncounted lies,
Innocence fades away
Iniquities, until the end of time.

Vices of greed have led us to an end
we will fall and then crawl, there's no running away
for every action there is a reaction, we are just a plague
too late to repent!

Nothing but dread we are leaving awayÂ 
as we burn in despair, our soul disappears
we reap what we sow, now we're paying the price
for this we all sought, (we are) vessels of sin!

Our own transgressions will haunt us, the scum of the earth
for weâve been indulged in sin for the eternity, all the eternity"
