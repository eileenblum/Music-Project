[Concept: Max. Lyrics: Roy, Max.]

"Subconsciously we're all taintedÂ 
(our) will is slowly erased, reduced, suppressed
fanatism, the worst of all plagues
Can't stand all this irrationality
Sinners and Martyrs, they look the same to me.
Dehumanized in terror, so truth remains concealed.

Scavengers fed by grief and despair
from a past of ambiguous devotions
have made you believe the existence of false gods
now pray to the wind, lie to yourself.

For when we approach the end we will find that
we will die and rot, there is no kingdom of light
look how the world slay their lambs
Sinners and Martyrs, they look the same to me.
Dehumanized in terror, so truth remains under control.

Can't you see the lie?

Why to believe the word? Dogmas of human divinity
Enlightened to preach their word... Hell grows with Faith
Selective Salvation, under the skin of the prayer
Why do you pray when you fear?

as the lambÂ invokesÂ its shepherd
becomes easy to comprehend
that power is in our will
not in the cross, not in rotten remains
seek the light, there was no sacrifice,Â 
no savior nor messiah
not very far from a dream
why don't open your eyes, awake
run from the fetid stench of your faith"
