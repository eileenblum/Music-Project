[Concept &amp; Lyrics: Roy.]

"Listen to the sounds of doom, the songs of death,
Arranged for Submission, extinction
A nightmare resembling that which you fear the most

Stare at the sky, the horizon is burning in colors of burial
announcing the trembling of earth, death from above, a deluge of blood.

The scourge of those who Gaze towards the Heavens, in shadows
verging on the abyss of obscure wrathÂ 

Symphonies of ruin overcome, the land bathes in the blood of mankind

He who plays the melodies, plucking chords from his harp
to control us with power, he's depraved in arroganceÂ 
In his search for mightiness, he'll slay the world

Listen to the putrid song and haunting chants,Â 
Arranged for commotion, destruction
Vultures are feasting on carcasses of those who rot

The sky becomes dark on the curtains of dusk, leaving nothing but stillness
Proclaiming the dimness will come, the deed is done, a deluge of blood

The end of life, soon will come.
Thus void of earth, time has come to die"
