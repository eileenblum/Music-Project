[Concept: Max, Lyrics: Roy.]

âTied by the tyrantâs mockeries, (to) fight for a right to be
Inside I feel the urge; itâs not the end, but the awakening!
Deceived! Ignis Fatuus, a delusion of life
Silent! Contorted thoughts are never expressed

Filled by the angst of ignorance, their secrets I will seek
I will unveil the truth of roguery and conspiracies!
As burning embers, my thirst for knowledge will torch,
Away from the lamb I shall break loose

Superstition bred from ignorance,
Self-imposed absence from your mind,
Deities made to keep you down, oh no,
But I will not become one of you.

Open your eyes and see, break the wall of intolerance

Chased by the ones who manipulate (us), the oblivion calls for me
Inside I feel the urge; the hunt is on for the anomaly!
Exiled! All alone (I) seek for ones like me
Outlawed! Contorted thoughts must be never expressed

Filled by the angst of ignorance, their secrets I will seek
I will unveil the truth of roguery and conspiracies!
As burning embers, my thirst for knowledge will torch,
Away from the lamb I shall break loose

Beyond the slavery of a world built upon the lies of men,
Beyond the orphans of the verity, thereâs a new dawn.

Suppressio Veri!
Veritas vos liberabit!

Lies will not stand, they have led us astray!

Superstition has bred from ignorance,
Leading us all to believe these lies,
But I will not become anything of you
Away from the lamb I shall break looseâ
