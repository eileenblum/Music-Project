[Concept &amp; Lyrics: Roy.]

"On my lonesome darkened cell
Wherein silence never dwells
Cold as the steelâ¦

On the floor I lie, forlorn
Starving for days, chained to the wall

No sight, dead inside
I'm trapped in a maelstrom
Afflicted my core
(They) whipped me, (They) hit me
(it) woke me up
(I) just want to scream
Breathless I am.

For a penny they will pass
To see the "God's Minstrels"
Freaks of the wardâ¦

And I see their vile faces
Laughing at me, with their odious stare

Pain is all I feel
Trapped inside these walls
I became an empty shell
Can I see the world through my own eyes?

Pain is all that's real
It is my curse, it's my world

No sight, dead inside
I'm trapped in a maelstrom
Afflicted my core
(They) whipped me, (They) hit me
(it) woke me up
(I) just want to scream
Breathless I am"
