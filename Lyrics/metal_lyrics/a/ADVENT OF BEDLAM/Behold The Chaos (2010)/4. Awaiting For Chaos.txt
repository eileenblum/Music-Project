[Concept: Isak. Lyrics: Isak, Roy.]

âLed by our sins as theyâre taking us over
Desperation and fear, no, we cannot take cover
Now weâre facing the chaos of men
The end of our lives

Despite the tales of our past
Ambitions of men
Have taking us out of our minds
Dragging us out into losing control
Thereâs nothing left to do now, (itâs) too late.

A disrupted race, out of order, out of place
Damnation has arrived to possess this earthÂ 

Forming part of the insane mass
Ensnared beyond escape
To a realm of disorder
To a realm of lies.

Trapped in a system that stimulates and forces you to kill your thoughts, Hate and disgust will rule upon us all, a growing disease inherited by our fathers from which we cannot escape, chaos is manifested everywhere I see, salvation fades away, torn apart right in front our eyes, All is shrouded by shades

Future is gone,
Gone beyond any hopes
The end of our lives

Future is gone,
Nothing but chaos,Â 
I see just miseryâ
