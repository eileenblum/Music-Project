A sleepless night
Near my river that flows
I'm longing to see your face

The winds are so high
As I start to shiver
And the clouds fade away

[chorus:]
Embrace me please
And let my dream come true
You are the vision in my painting in the sky
Over my land

And your beauty shines
When the moon surrounds me
Makes me feel so insecure

Can't you feel my pain
As I'm reaching out for you
And it's driving me insane

[chorus]
