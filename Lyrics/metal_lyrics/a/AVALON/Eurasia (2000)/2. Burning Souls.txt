Into the darkness where your journey ends in fear
Annihilation of humanity can't save you here

All the creations of former generations
Prowess of destruction is a deadly trade
Your bloodstained hands, your ruthless friends
Never resting until resistance fades

[chorus:]
The time has come to pay for your sins
Or you'll walk through the fire
Just yield control and leave us alone
Our burning souls

Why can't you realise? Why must we live in pain?
Why threaten children and spill blood in vain?
Your attitude of hatred can never claim success
We'll carry on to spoil your vicious game

[chorus]
