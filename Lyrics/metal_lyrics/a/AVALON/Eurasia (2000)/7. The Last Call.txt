What I had to trace
Dazzled from my own

Those rare and precious stones will stay
No generation can keep possessions
After they pass away
They'll be my gift that I'll leave so far behind

The end is near, feel the fear
I'm crossing the river
Who can say, what will stay?
There's no conclusion
Man made glory, an ancient story
Lasting forever
Always decieving and not believing
Living an illusion

[chorus:]
I muse upon all
Close to the last call to leave
Those tinder tears
And million of fears
Forgive!
I muse upon all
Close to the last call to leave
Those tinder tears
And million of fears
Forgive!

My fading soul, losing control
No restitution
Surrounded by pain, I try in vain
Can't hold on
My dying shell feeds the earth
Can I give in return
Bless creation, building on hope
Will I live forever?

[chorus]
