I walk across the land
Where the mountains rise
A strong and cold wind blowing hard
And the flawless stone hides

The reason for my journey burns
Can't you see the glow
A world beyond the promised land
On the road until the end

[chorus:]
Eternal flame
That shines the night
I'm away till the morning light
Eternal flame
That shines the night
I'm away till the morning light
Eternal flame
I'm awake
Joining one with all
Into the sky I'll fly

I walk across the land
Where the holy river flows
The people gather to its banks
Where the lotus flower grows

Revealing all the secret shades
So can you feel the might?
My journey back to my motherland
Unfolding a serving hand

[chorus]
... I see the white up in the dawning sky

It carries me to mystic shores
Gonna leave you 'cause I'm begging for more
We've known each other so long,
I know, way before

The winds will take me so far away
I'll leave you behind, but I'm longing to stay
We'll be together again,
I know, another day

Everything is suffering
Striving for live
Give up the craving
And what remains...
The eightfold path
The end
