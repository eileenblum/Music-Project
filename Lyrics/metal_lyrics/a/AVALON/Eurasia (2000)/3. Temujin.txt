I turn around in the night
To stare at the moon
Tears from the earth and the skies
Will power my soul

An ocean like the silver light
Reflection in my eyes
I'll turn your day to night
The demon comes
When the candles all burned
Down below the earth we see
That evil won't pass by
The kiss of dark, you'll feel... you know
This means war!

[bridge:]
They say I'm blind
I don't care who's right
I don't care who's wrong
I won't deny
Bow to the will of the strong

[chorus:]
I come now
Run for your shelters and caves
Because I'm coming down
You are the one
Precious one, 'cause I'm coming
I'm out for you kings and your knaves
The battle is on
You are the one
Precious one, Temujin

Our host out on the open plain
We'll fill your hearts with fright
Your souls, a sea of pain
The end of your days draw near
And I'll seize your crown
Forever soiled with shame
Our swords will spill the plight
And hallowed be my name.. you know
It means war!

[bridge]

[chorus]
