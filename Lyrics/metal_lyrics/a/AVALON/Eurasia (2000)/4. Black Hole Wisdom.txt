I ask for attention
I feel the apprehension
And I get no answer

Felt like I was decaying
Devoutly started praying
Let my evil die

I obtain no reunion
It seems you can't forgive me
Please send me an angel

[chorus:]
Black hole wisdom
Who did I pray to?
You never listened
Why can't you say
Where were you all my wordly life?
Why can't you say
Show me the way
To salvation day

This might be the last chance
For me to make my humble stance
And offer my sacrifice

I've come to join you
Got to find a way through to you
Gimme a little piece of advice

Don't lead me into temptation
It's time for the revelation
Now I realise

[bridge]

Till salvation day
Till salvation day
Till salvation day
