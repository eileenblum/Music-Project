I felt guilty without a reason
An outsider with wide eyed gazed
The fear in my heart
As my palms sweat
I'm helpless! Got to run out of here
He pulls a gun without a reason
And I'm a victim of innocent age
I see his madness kin to creature
And don't blame this on me

[chorus:]
I see the signs of danger
In the eyes of the stranger
It paralyzes me, confuses me
Until a new day begins
I see reactions of anger
In the eyes of the stranger
It paralyzes me, confuses me
Until the dawn returns

Is it a nightmare what I have been through?
Is it a dream or reality?
He's grining my way without knowing me
I don't know what the hell's going on
It seems like he is mentally retarded
And what for mankind existing today
I see the mirror and neon lightning
Will I go blind?

[chorus]
