I see shadows
Passin' me
And those I left behind
I'm livin in memories
I'm a prisoner of my mind

[Bridge:]
Deep inside
Is my hiding place, deep inside
Deep inside
Flows the melted ice

I think I was movin'
Movin too fast
To look into my mirror
The mirror of my soul

[Chorus:]
There are white clouds in my head
No more tears
I'm a prisoner of my mind
There are white clouds in my head
No more tears
I'm a prisoner of my mind

Then the truth takes
Wind and storms
To blow the clouds away

And in my head
I found the promised land
A land of better days

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
