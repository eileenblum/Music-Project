I see the trees, the leaves dark green
I show you pink, just follow me
The dust of angels is a fake

The lines and nose are everywhere
They suck their mind and know it's ok
They keep on dreaming, just they can see all
the heroes living next door

Wake up, why don't you see
your neighbour is a god, but nt you
He's always taking
The only one who gives is you

[Chorus:]
Wasted time
Is a wonderful thing and it's my business
Make my day
Be my guest and waste your time
Wasted time
I can't get enough when you are screaming

Make my day
Be so kind and buy my hope

A daze is better when you stare
With your friend but they have to pay
Take all their money, don't be ashamed!
The innocents don't know the right way.

Why don't you believe in me?
I am your inner voice - that's for free
My name is TV, I'm king of fantasy
And I'm a taker, I'll never give I know it's wasted time.

[Chorus:]
Wasted time
Is a wonderful thing and it's my business
Make my day
Be my guest and wast your time
Wasted time
I can't get enough when you are screaming
Make my day
Be so kind and buy my hope, the snake will see you take!
