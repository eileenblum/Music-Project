In the air the lights shine bright
Gods are invading

I wish it is not so bad for me
To navigate the galaxies

If I'd know something more
About how to fly
To far dimensions

The great day will come
For the prominence
To get some feedback
Who allows the whole world
Journeys into space
For a good vacation?

Where can I pay the bill
For a ticket to mars
To fulfill my dream
For settling space?

Build the street
Paint the map
Of the concrete ways
Cause it is time
It is time for the universe

[Chorus:]
It's time, its time
It's time for the universe, it's time for the universe

Human race won't you fly
To the unknown space
To far dimensions?

Realize the big chance
For our kids and our culture
Traveling through safer streets
Of the concrete ways
Cause it is time
It is time for the universe

[Chorus]

It's time for the universe
Lets walk through the gate of time
