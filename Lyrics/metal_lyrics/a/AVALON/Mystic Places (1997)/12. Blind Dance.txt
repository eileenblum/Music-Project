When I feel you
The blood in my veins'
Is bursting into flames
I don't hesitate
When I'm longing for you
For you

I feel only one thing
And I'm turning blind
When you look into my eyes
Your nails hurt my pride
Like some new razorblades my flesh

[Bridge:]
When I long for you
I long for you

[Chorus:]
Blind Dance
Don't wait to see
And let them hunt you down with their passion
Blind Dance
Don't wait for me
I'm gonna hunt them down if they want to die

You're my engine
Love always renews
Adventures in my life
I am your bad side
The second face for your soul
For you

And so we can move the heavens and earth
I don't wait, I don't see
Cause I'm hunting down the one who wants to
deny my love

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
