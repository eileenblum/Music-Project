In agreement
With your paper warfare
Anti tank guns
Roll over coats of mail
The missiles are taking off
And the world begins to the end

[Chorus:]
Through the eye of the end
Children can't see rainbows
Through the eye of the end
A child is splashing in bad acid rain
Through the eye of the end
And when the animals die the dead will come sooner

Will you be
The last seeing man
Before you go blind
Under the burning sun

Will you be the one
Who takes the last breath
Will you be the man
Who will go through the last sunrise
And never will return
From where the world begins to end

[Chorus:]
Through the eye of the end
Children can't see rainbows
Through the eye of the end
A child is splashing in bad acid rain
Through the eye of the end
Children can't see rainbows
Through the eye of the end
Children cannot play with animals

Put into motion
Not a drop in the ocean
Earth seems like a dry battery a dry battery
It's a dry ocean

[Chorus]
