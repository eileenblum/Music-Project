Merciless wars
Allow no excuse
Megalomania
Foreign rules
Arising from avarice
There's no restitution

Can you feel 
The death and silence
Over empty battlefields?

We fight with speed
And the strongest power
To reach the half of fame in war

[Bridge:]
We fight, framed with more than order
We fight, for the criminal wars

[Chorus:]
The passion for glory

For years the story goes
The wrong illusion
The earth will tell - you see
The passion for glory
For years the story goes
The wrong illusion
The earth will tell - you see

The reference
To other states
Will surely be responsible for war

For what I see
Mankind will fall
They are longing for paradise, there's no ressurection

Can you feel
The death and silence
Over empty battlefields?

We fight with speed
And the strongest power
To reach the hall of fame in war

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
