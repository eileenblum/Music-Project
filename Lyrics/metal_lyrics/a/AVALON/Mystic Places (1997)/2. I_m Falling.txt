I'm a king
And hallowed be my name
But the price I have to pay is much too high
Everything I touch
Turns into golden goods
But my problem is
I have to be alone

[Bridge:]
What's going on
Why can't you see
That you challenge my passion, challange my passion?
I felt so good
But now I'm bad
'Cause you've made me mad
And now my happy day is sad

[Chorus:]
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm going mad, feeling bad, when you hurt my pride
I'm falling, I'm falling
It's a waste, don't compare me to other ones
I'm falling, I'm falling
I'm not a fool, no saint, no hero

Your sad life
is talking hooks to me
When you call me a star, you are wrong
It is not true
Everything I do
Means painful work to me
It's not as easy as it seems, it's a hard job

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
