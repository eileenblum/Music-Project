He's a man
And there are the cold winter days
Bad omen of an icy breath
Demons might forces him
To be somewhere, to burn a light
On the cold winter days

[Bridge:]
When the fire is ready to burn
Down it's destiny of blood and tears
Will you see the madmans light
The fixed idea is burning down the house

[Chorus:]
Caught in the red hot burning heat of fire
Buring down the house
Look at their faces, the flames are so much higher
Burning down the house
Caught in the red hot burning heat of fire
Burning down the house
Look at their faces, I don't care
Burning down the house

He's quiet now
Based on shame
Calmed down by the flames
Maybe he'll just remain inside
Of the house, burning stones
Of his inner soul
The isolation kills what friendship means

[Bridge]
[Chorus]
