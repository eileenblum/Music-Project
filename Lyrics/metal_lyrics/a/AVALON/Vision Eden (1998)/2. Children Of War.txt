The enemy aliens
From outer space
They had been too hard
And too strong
We are heading to stay
Till the end

We never thought about
Leaving for somewhere beyond
Never ever thought about
To betray this world
The place where we were born

Why don't you answer us
Follow the sign of the cross
In the power of hope we trust
Until tomorrow
When the night will be over

Sight for sight
There was only one reason
To start escalation
Night by night
We were trying to call
For a powerful nation
Fight to fight
Night is the name
For the right

Just waiting for a hand
We are the children of war
Our rescue seems too far
To defend this world
The place where we were born

Tears running down the face
They're falling into the dust
Getting closer to the fin
Into darkness
When the fight will be over

Sight for sight
There was only one reason
To start escalation
Night by night
We were trying to call
For a powerful nation
Fight to fight
Night is the name
For the right

The enemy aliens
From outer space
They had been too hard
And too strong
We are heading 
To have the

Sight for sight
There was only one reason
To start escalation
Night by night
We were trying to call
For a powerful nation
Fight to fight
Night is the name
For the right
