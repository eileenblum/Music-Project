I don't know
What I'm feeling
Can't you see
What's going on
I am Gene
I'm a genius

But something happened
The human touch
Tries to corrupt
My way too much

I am a bit confused
United units start
A rivalry of bites
My human system fights
My mission clear defined
I'm at the end of the line

I'm a Gene - genius
Built to protect the world
From death and pain
But my mission was erased
I'm Gene Genius
I lost my sense of duty
For us all
What a vision, I'm amazed

I still try
Can you hear me
Mankind just
Doesn't realize
I am Gene
I'm a genius

But something happened
The human touch
Tries to corrupt
My way too much

I'm here to fight the fight
Control the human might
The universal quest
There is no time to rest
The mission would be fine
I'm at the end of the line

I'm a Gene - genius
Built to protect the world
From death and pain
But my mission was erased
I'm Gene Genius
I lost my sense of duty
For us all
What a vision, I'm amazed
I'm a Gene Genius
I didn't reach the height
Of my intent
It's my passion to replace
The feelings in my veins
