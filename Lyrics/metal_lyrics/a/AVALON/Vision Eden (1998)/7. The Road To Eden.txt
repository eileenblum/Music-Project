We did walk
So many years now
We don't know
How far we have to go
To reach another place
Now we feel
The body's weariness
Just see this tired face

But the journey must go on
On the road to Eden

We had been
Through endless valleys
We could stay
As long as we did need
To keep on living with joy
For a while
There rules to leisure on
To stay forever here

But the journey must go on
On the road to Eden

We did walk
So many years now
We don't know
How far we have to go
To reach another place
Now we feel
The body's weariness
Just see this tired face

But the journey must go on
On the road to Eden
