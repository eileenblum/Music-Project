Hundred centuries
Fell back the sea
When rainfall
Appears on one day
I'll never be the same
I'll never be
I'll never be the same

All the trials
To grow the rice
No raindrops
Are dancing for me
I'll never see the rain
I'll never see
I'll never see the rain

Drop in the ocean of sand
I've never seen the rain
Searching the sea
I'll never be the same
Feeling of liquidity
I've never seen the rain
And I grow blind

Even one event
From heaven sent
Grants flourishing
Season's return
I'll never dry again
I'll never
I'll never dry again

Fate seems to be
Aridity
To clean the eyes
From golden dust
I'll never see the rain
I'll never see
I'll never see the rain

Drop in the ocean of sand
I've never seen the rain
Searching the sea
I'll never be the same
Feeling of liquidity
I've never seen the rain
And I grow blind
