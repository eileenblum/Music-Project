There's a man
You don't know his full name
But the real face
Wait for the light
They are in between us

Boldfaced and overbearing
We try to beat the gods
Creating better lifeforms
Tainting the human air

New notions for the fortune
Except for one of you
We sing the same tune
There is no place for war

They are in between us
Under cover you will see
They are in between us
Corrupt and unfair into darkness
They are in between us
And maybe inside
Inside of our minds

Do you ever think about it
We could be made by them
Drilled to be dulled and silent
The puppets from the past

Locked in the secret door
Behind the deepest abyss
Do you mind the password
Can you access your brain

They are in between us
Under cover you will see
They are in between us
Corrupt and unfair into darkness
They are in between us
And maybe inside
Inside of our minds

There's a man
You don't know his full name
But the real face
Wait for the light
They are in between us
