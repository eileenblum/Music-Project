For a while I walk
To the dark out there
Try to go back
To look where it came from

When I see today
Desert world around
Needs a cover
From oceans of water

Wanna be back there
In the outer range
In the old days
Called paradise garden

Want to reach the light
Tell me why it's so dark
Could you show me
Where sunlight is shining

No return
From the land of pain
Wherever you go

Don't you remember
It was the age of salvation
We came a strange day
Till the age of starvation

Talk in terms of crime
Tell me whose offence
Gave away
All the wonderful places

Look at you today
Take a chance to learn
How to turn back
The proceeding world's wheel

Take a break and think
If you try to hide
Who is bringing us back
Our blue sky

Put a sign up here
Till the day of dawn
Anytime a reminder
For mankind

No return
From the land of pain
Wherever you go

Don't you remember
It was the age of salvation
We came a strange day
Till the age of starvation
