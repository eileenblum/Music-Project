He is on his way
Longing for comfort
To lead him through the day
But the only thing in life
Is the freedom to survive
Believe in the power
Of the will

A matter of survival
For the lord of dignity
The warlord over darkness
He is superior
The lord of the dignity
He is ready for the fight
He is superior
The lord of the dignity
So come along
And join the crowd
To praise the lord
Of the dignity

And then it starts to rain
It can't erase the pain
Of feeling so alone
In this world without hope
On a long and winding road
Becomes their glorious
Walk of fame

A matter of survival
For the lord of dignity
The warlord over darkness
He is superior
The lord of the dignity
He is ready for the fight
He is superior
The lord of the dignity
So come along
And join the crowd
To praise the lord
Of the dignity
