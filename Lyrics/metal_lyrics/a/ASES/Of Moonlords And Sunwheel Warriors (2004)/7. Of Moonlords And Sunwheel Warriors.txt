I saw you my son
Contemplating our realm
I saw you my son
And I saw your eyes...
Oh father
Oh my king
I know you see what I see
Oh father
Oh my king
I know you feel what I feel...
As this realm you are a son of the complete circle of moon and sun
Of all seasons I'm proud of what I am
I'm proud of who I am
As you my king
And as my ancestors
I'm proud to be this people
And as my people and as my army I am of moonlord and sunwheel warrior
