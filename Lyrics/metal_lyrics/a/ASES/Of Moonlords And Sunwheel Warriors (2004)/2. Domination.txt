I am the Black Death
I am the night prowler
The curse that creep amongst you men
Prophetor from darkness
Messenger of evil
The poisoned thorn that will cause the decay of human race
I hate you rapers
I abase you when I terrorize your nuns
And when your prudish daughters
And sisters sell their souls to pagan cause
Under the assaults of my tongue and my rod
And league with me soul and body
I am the infection
I am the gangrene
I spit my venom of soul and body
