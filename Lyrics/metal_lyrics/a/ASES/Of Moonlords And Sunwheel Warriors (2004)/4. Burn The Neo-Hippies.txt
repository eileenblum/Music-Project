No forgiveness, no mercy
We are the barbarians
I dream of million bodies strewing the battlefield
Ripped up by the blades of vengeance
Spilling their decaying guts in the grass
Fertilizing my lands and forests
The harvesting will be better next year
We are the pagan legions in the employ of ourself
I see thousands cadavers of those hippie vermines
Gutted up to throat of their sacred ecstasy
No tolerance toward this polluting waste
No rave parties on my land
They are the parasites they are the weakness
Subculture for drugs addicteds
