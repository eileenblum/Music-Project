Contemplating the fields of snow
I perceive my own eternity
At night I see all in black and white
Concrete and filth disappear under a shroud of white purity
But sometimes some pest shadows and jangles of humanity
Appear in the middle of my fatherland
And bring me back to this putrid present
Sons of Wotan
Sons of Teutates
We are our own pride
We are our own future
We must protect our sacred children
And transmit them our great culture
Sons of Wotan
Sons of Tuetates
Remember our believes
Remember our roots
We are the heirs of Europa
We are the heirs of pagan blood
