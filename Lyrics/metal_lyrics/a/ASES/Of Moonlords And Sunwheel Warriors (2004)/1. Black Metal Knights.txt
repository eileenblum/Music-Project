Hear the anger of Black Metal rising as a sunwheel
Praise the breed of heathen blood
Praise the breed of warriors
Howl your been
Bestiality
Your true ancestral pride
You must believe in yourself and be your first god
You are the Black metal knights
Results of ancestral cults
Waiting for the final fight
For your blood and your land
You are the Black Metal knights
Sons of the dragons of the north
Deny all the books of lies and their feeble weak sons
This putrid humanity and this bastard society
Spit on this world of weakness build on debasing rules
You mighty Black Metal knights lords of the only holy fight
