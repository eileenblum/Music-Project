Sons and daughters of weakness
They don't believe in pagan freedom
They don't believe in bestial force
Grand fathers from the lands of shadows
Narrate us your old legends from our fatherland as it was
Let us know how it should be
Concede us the lost knowledge
Lead us to the heathen stronghold
The great forest from your myth
Mixing our blood and our land
By and for the laws of nature
Forever in our hearts and souls
