There is a truth, that will be told
'cause many secrets are kept in the dark
But in night they will unfold
Open your eyes and you will see
Nothing is like it seems to be

Watch the signs of the night
Leave without a trace
Watch the signs of the night
Danger from outer space

Stars reach out with dark intent
Grim voices in the wind are howling my name
Desperate to make a stand
The deception has begun
Oh why am I a chosen one?

Watch the signs of the night
Leave without a trace
Watch the signs of the night
Danger from outer space

As the moonlight shines inside
Thin shapes around my bed are reaching for me
Blinded by a glaring light
The sleeping giant now awake
And he came from outer space

Watch the signs of the night
Leave without a trace
Watch the signs of the night
Danger from outer space
