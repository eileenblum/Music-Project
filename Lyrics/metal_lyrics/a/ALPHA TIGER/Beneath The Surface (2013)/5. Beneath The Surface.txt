Born and grown up in the streets
I've learned what life can be
Cruel, cold and mercyless

In a land ruled by the strong
Who solve a problem with a bomb
I can't hide my scorn anymore

Do you think is what progress means?
I'll write the script of my own dreams

And the streets will drown in blood tonight
Beneath the surface we arm for a fight
Liberty will ascend the horizon
And we become heirs to your throne

I know they taught you not to feel
Beat the human out of you
Just a shaded face among the crowd

Television sells the rule
Media controls and leads the fools
Who search for God inside the screen

You think that on small voice can't change the world?
But myriad voices will be a scream

And the streets will drown in blood tonight
Beneath the surface we arm for a fight
Liberty will ascend the horizon
And we become heirs to your throne

Do you feel safe behind your walls?
Die free or live in chains
Kindle the fire inside
So stop running and make a change

Take a look at the morning dawn
It has already begun
We will see the future through the eyes
Of our daughters and sons

Where has all the braveness gone,
On which once this land was built?
Blood and courage, is what I claim

Take my hand, I will lead you out
Hear my words, I will scream 'em loud
Revolution in our veins

Did you choose a life in slavery?
If you want to be free, you have to follow me

And the streets will drown in blood tonight
Beneath the surface we arm for a fight
Liberty will ascend the horizon
And we become heirs to your throne
To your throne
