I wish
I wish that I could be the falling rain
So I'm able to wash every tear away
And I will
And I will conflate into the river
'til I finally reach the golden sea

What will be afterwards?
When I will open my eyes again
What will be afterwards?
Maybe I will return as the rain

Tall as a mountain
I'll sit enthroned the clouds
And watch the range beneath my feet

Strong as the wild wind
I sweep across the land
And wipe the ships over the sea

What will be afterwards?
When I will open my eyes again
What will be afterwards?
Maybe I will return as the rain

Fast as a comet
Engulfed in raging flames
So I will ride through the space

Clear as the ocean
The mirror of this world
A single drop touches your face

What will be afterwards?
When I will open my eyes again
What will be afterwards?
Maybe I will return as the rain
