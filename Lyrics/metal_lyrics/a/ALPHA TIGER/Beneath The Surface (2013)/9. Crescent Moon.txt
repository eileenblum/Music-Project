There's a crescent moon tonight
Embraced by a cloudless sky
Have you ever tried to count
All the diamonds on the cope?

Now I hear the mourning bell
As I leave this mortal shell
While the last tear hits the ground
Oh its time for me to go

Blackness
Is pulling me in its his realm
But there is someone who lends me a hand
The whispering of a long forgotten voice
Which gently calls my name
Leads me softly through this maze

All this time did you wait for me?
What do years mean in eternity?

Shining giant from the sea
Crescent moon on the rise
Cast your tempting spell on me
Solemn queen of the night
Guide me on my ride

Enslaved by this endless strife
From those heavy chains of life
Another fragile soul reaches for the stars

I ventured out into a dream
Onward through this magic scene
Through the valley of secrets and of fears

Fly with me into a pleasant dream
Within a night sky reverie

Shining giant from the sea
Crescent moon on the rise
Cast your tempting spell on me
Lovely queen of starlight

Take me home tonight
Lovely queen of starlight
Take me home tonight
Solemn queen of the night
Solemn queen of the night

Take me home tonight
Lovely queen of starlight
Take me home tonight
Solemn queen of the night
Crescent moon on the rise

Let us sail into the blue
You're the earth and I'm your moon
In this emerald field of dreams
Over and over again

As I transcend through the sphere
And become a ruby star
So what belongs together
Is finally unified
