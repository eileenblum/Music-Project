Shall I tell you some secrets, my sweet little son?
Don't trust those who talk with cloven tongue
Oh beware when you step out into the blue
'cause vultures in the sky are lurking for you

Now you're prepared to go out and break through the fence
Just a small child, but you got the right in your hands

We came from the gutter
And still we are here
Call for revolution
Salvation is near

The Rich men sells heart and soul and take money instead
While a beggar in the street shares his last bread
Don't be jealous you have all what you need inside
Salvation waits in the plain, the plain shades of life

We're not wealthy, but envy can't keep us down
It's not more important what we could have bad, but what we have now

We came from the gutter
And still we are here
Call for revolution
Salvation is near

Sometimes you will find darkness outside of the night
Sometimes you will find wisdom in the heart of a child

Take all your chances, remember to share your heartbeat
If it's your will, you could have the world at your feet

Now you're prepared to go out and break through the fence
Just a small child, but you got the right in your hands

We came from the gutter
And still we are here
Call for revolution
Salvation is near
