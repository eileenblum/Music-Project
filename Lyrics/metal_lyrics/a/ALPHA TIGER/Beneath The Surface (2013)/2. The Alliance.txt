From heaven on our chariots we come
When evil has conquered the earth
A legion of braveness and pride

Darkness spreads like a disease
A curtain of putridity
Our hearts shall lead us through this night

In times of blackness oh it needs a heart that shines
A heart that shines so bright

Ride to the line
Join the alliance
With the sword of justice in your hand
Ride to the line
Lead the alliance
Fight and bring us deliverance
Break through the line
And lead the alliance

The righteous live and die for their right
Crusade their ambitious dream
With the battle hymns they've sung

Commence the war between heaven and hell
For now and for evermore
Within the hearts of everyone

In times of blackness oh it needs a heart that shines
A heart that shines so bright

Ride to the line
Join the alliance
With the sword of justice in your hand
Ride to the line
Lead the alliance
Fight and bring us deliverance
Break through the line
And lead the alliance

Seraphs are falling, awaiting the end
No one can save us now!
Thy mighty wings eclipse the sky

You are our Savior in shining light
Now lead us to victory
And confront evil eye to eye

In times of blackness oh it needs a heart that shines
A heart that shines so bright

Ride to the line
Join the alliance
With the sword of justice in your hand
Ride to the line
Lead the alliance
Fight and bring us deliverance
Break through the line
And lead the alliance
