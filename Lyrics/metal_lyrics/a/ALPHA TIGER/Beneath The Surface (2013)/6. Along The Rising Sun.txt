Living in this guileful badlands
Shall be the dagger in my chest
Oh please tell me that I'm dreaming
Or better, that I'm dead

Fly with me along the rising sun
There's a place where we belong
Take my hand, now, 'cause we are young
Along, along the rising sun

Here I'll never find a salvation
Here I'll never can be free
I need to find a way out of here
Out of this cruel society

Fly with me along the rising sun
There's a place where we belong
Take my hand, now, 'cause we are young
Along, along the rising sun

Fly with me along the rising sun
There's a place where we belong
Take my hand, now, 'cause we are young
Along...

Fly with me along the rising sun
There's a place where we belong
Take my hand, now, 'cause we are young
Along, along the rising sun, the rising sun
