No guarding lights, no warning signs
A daughter wrested from her life
Too young to know the secrets of this earth

Left her parents in a lonely world
Without the girl
Their everything
It's a cold, oh it's a cold moment of sadness

God has a plan for everyone
But why he did take her so young
R.I.P. my little one

Awoke in darkness
Did I sleep for a few years,
Or was it yesterday, she went away?
Veiled in silence
Now I'm captured in my dreams
While a stranger grows in me

Sometimes all the colors fade
And leave just different shades of grey
Shades of grey

Desperation
For those who pray and those who wait
To witness miracles someday

Now the snow is falling down
And the tears freeze on my cheek
As emptiness replaces the pain

Pray to god, I heard them say
But where was he on that one day?

We are waiting for a
Waiting for a sign
The only thing we get
Is thunder from the sky

I'm standing outside
A muted call that  can't be heard
As my hands crave for the sky

Oh I want to believe
Yes so badly in a truth
Which lies far beyond our eyes

But I'm sure that in the end
I will hold her hand again
Her hand again

We are waiting for a
Waiting for a sign
The only thing we get
Is thunder from the sky

We are waiting for a
Waiting for a sign
The clouds are crying out
But where's the man behind?
