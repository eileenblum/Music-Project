Hear my prophecy!

It's time to reap what we have sown
But withered is the ground
And dried out are the seas
A long time ago we didn't see the signs
Now the time to dream is gone

If I could write a letter to the past
A prophecy of what future will bring
Do you think anything would change?

Now Eden lies in ruins
And silently we've watched
As vengeance came over us
What will be left?
A rotten ruin, once called home

Things will be better, when we're dead and gone
'cause who will miss a parasite?
I will not!
And now we must pay for what we have done
So take a rest and get well soon
'cause maybe tomorrow the next plague will come

We can't deny the echoes
Of our reckless deeds
Oh in the hills they still resound

The route to exile has vanished now
We're standing at the dark
At the dark side progress

All tanks and guns fell quiet now
The last survivors wait
Patiently for their wait
With begging hands
No one can break this silence

Things will be better, when we're dead and gone
'cause who will miss a parasite?
I will not!
And now we must pay for what we have done
So take a rest and get well soon
Oh mother!

Greed and ignorance
Were poison on her skin
Tears of repentance
A cleansing from within
from within

Kingdom of liars deceived the fools
And took the lamb from the shrine
Disregard all warnings
And now we've run out of time
Fortify under the surface
While the jester is dancing in the acid rain
Power games took the highest toll
Victims were part of the game

Things will be better when we're dead and gone
'cause who will miss a parasite?
I will not!
And now we must pay for what we have done
So take a rest and get well soon
'cause maybe tomorrow the next plague will come
