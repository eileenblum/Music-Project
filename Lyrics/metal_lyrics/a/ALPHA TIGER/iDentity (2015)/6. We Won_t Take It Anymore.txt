We don't give a shit
About pacts and relationships
And about your power games and scores

And we don't care who gave the first shot
We don't care about who you are
We don't care who spilled the first blood
We don't care about your war!

You call us hopeless Generation
'Cause we won't play by your rules?
Or it's because you can't control us
Like your money hungry fools

We won't take it, take it anymore
'Cause we are sick of it all
We won't take it, take it anymore
We've had it up to here

Conform and fight in war, no!
We fight your rules and fuck your war
This is not what you want to hear, huh?

You say what we need
Is a common enemy
Fuck you for fooling me
Fuck you for fooling me

And we are waiting patiently as a sign of esteem
And you still act like you don't hear me
How much louder shall I scream?

We won't take it, take it anymore
'Cause we are sick of it all
We won't take it, take it anymore
We've had it up to here

We won't take it, take it anymore
'Cause we are sick of it all
We won't take it, take it anymore
We've had it up to here

No more, no more, no more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more

We won't take it, take it anymore
'Cause we are sick of it all
We won't take it, take it anymore
We've had it up to here

We won't take it, take it anymore
'Cause we are sick of it all
We won't take it, take it anymore
We've had it up to here

WE WON'T TAKE IT
