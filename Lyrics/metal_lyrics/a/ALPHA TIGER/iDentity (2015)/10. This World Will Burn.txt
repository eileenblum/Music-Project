Is there anything worth fighting for at all?
If there's no heartbeat don't call it life!
But you spend a lifetime to dig your own grave
And I guess you can't wait to jump inside

You wanna get cheated, you want to get fooled
You wanna get mistreated, you want to get ruled
You wannt live down, down on your knees
This world will burn and you hold the match

There's someone dying to be alive
While you are living just to die
There's someone fighting to be free
Can't you see... it is he you should be!

Freedom, oh Freedom, it doesn't mean that's for free
There's no place called nowhere where you can hide
Don't expect some kind of help
When you refuse to help yourself
Live means fighting for your right
So you must decide

You wanna get cheated, you want to get fooled
You wanna get mistreated, you want to get ruled
You wannt live down, down on your knees
This world will burn and you hold the match

There's someone dying to be alive
While you are living just to die
There's someone fighting to be free
Can't you see... it is he you should be!

You wanna get cheated, you want to get fooled
You wanna get mistreated, you want to get ruled
You wannt live down, down on your knees
This world is yours, you can have it all!
This world is yours, you can have it all!
This world is yours, you can have it all!
This world is yours, you can have it all!

You wanna get cheated, you want to get fooled
You wanna get mistreated, you want to get ruled
You wannt live down, down on your knees
This world will burn and you hold the match

There's someone dying to be alive
While you are living just to die
There's someone fighting to be free
Can't you see... it is he you should be!
