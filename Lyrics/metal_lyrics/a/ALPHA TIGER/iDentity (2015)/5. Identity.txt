Did you notice some changes at me?
It's still me, or am I what they want me to be?

Shocked when I look down on me
Just wire and circuitries
There's not much what's left
Except a number on my neck

I lost my I, Identity
I never thought it could be taken from me
I lost my I, Identity
And I became what I, what I fear the most
Another one of those...

Everything I once cherished was suddenly gone
I wish I could say that I didn'r see that coming

You can't stop progress thay say
So you should better obey
"There's no intent to deceive"
I just wanted to believe...

I lost my I, Identity
I never thought it could be taken from me
I lost my I, Identity
And I became what I, what I fear the most
Another one of those...

I throw my head 'gainst the wall
But there is no pain at all
I wish I could feel anything
No, no, but I'm just a machine

I lost my I, Identity
I never thought it could be taken from me
I lost my I, Identity
And I became what I, what I fear the most
Another one of those...
