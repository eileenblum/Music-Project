Chaos and anarchy
I am the public enemy
I am yoor biggest fear
Don't try to build a prison around me

An outcast of society
Cause I disagree
We disagree

I'm the unspoken truth
This is my one finger salute
Yest I am still alive
You tried to kill me, you didn't get it right

I am the heartbeat of protest
A revolution in progress
The meaning of identity
Is to disagree
To disagree
We disagree

Beware the thinking men
It hits you like a hurricane
I never serve the west
I rather rip my heart out of my chest

Can't you see it has begun?
Cause I am not the only one
Everyone just follow me
Let's disagree
Oh can't you see I'm disagree

We disagree
We disagree
We disagree
We disagree
We disagree

Oh can't you see
We disagree
Oh can't you see
We disagree
