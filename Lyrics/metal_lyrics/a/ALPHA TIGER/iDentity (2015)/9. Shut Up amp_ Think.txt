Fight for your nation
'Cause it's your duty they say
Don't ask any questions
It's much better this way
Ohhho... Remember it's what you do and not what you say
Ohhho... Start your engine now, make those bastards pay!

Thought is the first step to rebellion; it starts in your head
Don't be afraid 'cause it's the only weapon left!

It's up to you if you want your mind to be free
Just Shut Up &amp; Think
It's up to you if you want your mind to be free
Just Shut Up &amp; Think

You're small and weak they say
The world will beat you down
Too frail to stand up tall
Your face is gonna hit the ground
Ohhho... They think you're young and your mind is made to be bend
Ohhho... Show them they're wrong just shut the fuck up and think!

Thought is the first step to rebellion; it starts in your head
Don't be afraid 'cause it's the only weapon left!

It's up to you if you want your mind to be free
Just Shut Up &amp; Think
It's up to you if you want your mind to be free
Just Shut... Shut Up &amp; Think

It's up to you if you want your mind to be free
It's up to you if you want your mind to be free
Just Shut Up &amp; Think

It's up to you if you want your mind to be free
It's up to you if you want your mind to be free
Just Shut... Shut Up &amp; Think
