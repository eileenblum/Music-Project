Another night, another dream
It all comes down to smoke and steam
When we're walking through the factory gates again

From day to day it's getting harder to fight
And even harder to keep dreams alive
To say "never surrender" seems easy when you are young

And I will step into the great unknown
Where dreams are made to become real
Yest I know it's still a long way to go
But I'm closer than yesterday
Closer than yesterday
Closer than yesterday

Don't blame yourself for what you did
But you will regret the things you've missed
Live ain't nothing but a funny, a funny ride

So don't say you try
Just say you will
There is enough you left behind, it's time to live!

And I will step into the great unknown
Where dreams are made to become real
Yest I know it's still a long way to go
But I'm closer than yesterday
Closer than yesterday
Closer than yesterday

And I will step into the great unknown
Where dreams are made to become real
Yest I know it's still a long way to go
But I'm closer than yesterday
Closer than yesterday
Closer than yesterday
