Come on over hear the news
The day has come, now we are free to choose!
I choose the path, that's best for me
Thank god to live the American dream

We're the pride, we're the brave
Only fools deserve to slave
So bow your head, down on your knees
Praise Lady Liberty
Lady Liberty

I'm free to give and free to share
I am not a saint and I don't care!
Free to have more than I need
Hard as seems but it sounds better to me

We're the pride, we're the brave
Only fools deserve to slave
So bow your head, down on your knees
Praise Lady Liberty
Lady Liberty

I'm free to shoot a stranger down
I claim my right, he trod my ground
I'll raise the flag of Liberty
The Lady on her hill will shine down on me

We're the pride, we're the brave
Only fools deserve to slave
So bow your head, down on your knees
We're the pride, we're the brave
Only fools deserve to slave
So bow your head, down on your knees
Praise Lady Liberty
Lady Liberty
