What's worth a soul when you can have so much more?
That's why I sold this worthless bitch!
I'll make it to the top of society
Mon and Dad will be proud of me
Will be proud of me
Cause I will make it on TV
Sex, drugs and money for free, for free, for free, for free
And I can't get enough!

Give them trash, filth and tripe as long as it sells
Don't turn off your TV
Tell them fiction and lies they gonna believe
Scripted Reality

Live could be easy just play by their rules
But there's no place for dignity
Don't mess with them, 'cause it's their game that we play
Just do whatever they say
Cause that's the price of the game
If you want fortune and fame
You first have to pay, to pay, to pay, to pay till you're broke

Give them trash, filth and tripe as long as it sells
Don't turn off your TV
Tell them fiction and lies they gonna believe
Scripted Reality

Give them trash, filth and tripe as long as it sells
Don't turn off your TV
Tell them fiction and lies they gonna believe
Scripted Reality
