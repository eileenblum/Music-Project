Maybe I'm a fool, caught up in a big dream
A gambler on the run attracted by the gleam
Careless and young, I reach for adventure
The distance in my eyes, I never surrender

So I prefer to live in vagueness
As the way you choose for me

Don't cry for me
I'm stubborn and free
'Till the devil whispers in my ear
Don't cry for me
I'm stubborn and free
It's a long way for redemption
But I have to keep the flame alive in me

We should keep our life as simple as it can be
Making mistakes was always a part of me
And if I hurt you, sorry, that's not what I meant
No I'm not that kind but I'm proud to be different

Who decide what's wrong or right?
It's just me who draw the line!

Don't cry for me
I'm stubborn and free
'Till the devil whispers in my ear
It's time to pay for free
Don't cry for me
Don't cry for me
And all I want to be
And all I want to be is to be free

Don't cry for me
I'm stubborn and free
'Till the devil whispers in my ear
It's time to pay for free
Don't cry for me
I'm stubborn and free
It's a long way for redemption
But I have to keep the flame alive in me

I'm stubborn and free
Stubborn and free
Stubborn and free
