Way home, close to midnight
Along the road, pursued by a strange light
Something forces me from the line

I come around, where have I been?
Iâve cosmic knowledge and strange signs on my skin
I donât dare to remember
What has happened in this night

No one believes me,
But I know what I have seen
A light in the sky
Starrider takes me high

Takes me high
Takes me high
Takes me high
Starrider takes me high

Every time when I look up in the sky
Cold shivers run down my spine
Dazing pictures in my dreams since then

Believer 
Deceiver
They jeer, while they canât explain it
But what am I do when they will come again?

No one believes me,
But I know what I have seen
A light in the sky
Starrider takes me high
