Light
The sphere alit in garish light
Unknown sapience fills my mind
All mundane forsakes my fate
My weightless soul does levitate

Elder spirits call at me
Equal nightmares frequently
The deity on lions throne
Straight from the abyss of my soul

Afterworld
Afterworld
On my way I led astray

Afterworld
Afterworld
From my inner sanctuary

Now 
I wander through the plains of dread
Somewhere between life and death
And I try to find escape
From phantoms in angelic shapes

The realm descends into bedlam
With blood drinking guardians
This images breaks my sanity
God, consciousness dwindles from me

Afterworld
Afterworld
From my inner sanctuary

I felt the harm of my own vile deeds
And failed to pass this final trial
So I seek refuge in motherâs womb
And so it will start again
Start again 
Start again
