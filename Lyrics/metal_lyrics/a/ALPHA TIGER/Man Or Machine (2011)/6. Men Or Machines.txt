Mountains of rust and steel
A world in disarray
Media prepares the truth
And drugs shall keep them calm

People in rank and file
The engine never sleeps
All gears serve the purpose
Weakness is not needed here

Eyes stare in emptiness
Without identity
The will was withered
And all voices are gone

Kids without a smile
Are born immune to feel
Raise to follow
To the iron hand

Thoughts control
Shall expose our souls
Vitreous
âcause, our hearts are not made to believe

Mind programmed
We are captured and damned
To be numb
âtill canât remember what we be
Men or machines
Men or machines

Synchronised
In collective we arise
In collective we will die
Sacrificed the inner self

Passionless mediocrity
We depend on the machine
Just a part of this cold void

The past is erased
The erased is forgotten
The lie becomes the truth
And becomes a lie again

Freedom is the Freedom to say
Two and two equals four
If that is granted,
All else follows

Human life is worth nothing
Power and avarice
Creates the loose cannon
Still strive for more and more
âtill nothing left to prey

This shattered race
Shall be the pride of creation?
God canât believe
What has happened to his former earth

Forgive us

Thoughts control
Shall expose our souls
Vitreous 
âcause, our hearts are not made to believe

Mind programmed
We are captured and damned
To be numb
âtill I canât remember what we be

Men or machines
Men or machines
Men or machines
