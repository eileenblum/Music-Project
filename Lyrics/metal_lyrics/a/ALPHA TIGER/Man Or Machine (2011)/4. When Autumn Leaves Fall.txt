Rain of dripping past
A puddle reflects my heart
Wind carries the autumn leaves away

I feel anxiety awake
Itâs too late
To make a change
Now Iâm old, too tired to live
Just hours save me from the end

As long as we have to die
We need to find our place in time
To justify our life
As long as we have to die

Memories full of guilt
Wishes unfulfilled
What have I reached in my life?

So it whispered in my head
Urgently, so I canât forget
Time is frozen, but the bell chimes
Tears my hearing and I know

As long as we have to die
We need to find our place in time
To justify our life
As long as we have to die

Pretty leaves are falling down,
From green to red at last to brown
So insignificant but yet nice
So, I found the answer to my life

Oh the autumn leaves fall
Oh the autumn leaves fall
Oh the autumn leaves fall
Oh the autumn leaves fall

As long as we have to die
We need to find our place in time
To justify our life
As long as we have to die
As long as we have to die
