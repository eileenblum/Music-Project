We are here
Stationed million Miles from home
To defend, to protect
To save freedom
USA always at your command

You know
How cruel the world can be
So we raise a sign
For liberty
And now we have to raise our flag
And start the aerial attack

Rudely awakened
Thereâs blood upon the streets
Our freedom was taken tonight
Search for a stash
Inferno from above
But there is no real chance to hide

A prouder salute with your boots on our heads
Who made you to the god of mine?
The truth is getting shrouded with stars and with stripes
Justice never treats so unkindly

Move forward
Though Baghdadâs gazing heat
Western Corps
Donât know the term: Defeat
Still remember how our towers fell?

Fire has failed
To bring regret
Call to arms
Sounds from the minaret
So our weapons canât be laid to rest
âTill thereâs democracy in your chest

Ohohoooh
Hail to our flag
Ohoooh
Baghdad under attack

Ohoooh
Hail to our flag
Ohoooh
Baghdad under attack
