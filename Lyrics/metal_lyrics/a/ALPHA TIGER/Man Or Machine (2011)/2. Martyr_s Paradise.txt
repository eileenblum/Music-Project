A chess piece of terrorism
Forced by hatred and heroism
Anguish in his breast

Awaiting in silent patience
His eyes filled with termination
A lot of souls shall leave their shell tonight
For the Martyrium

Where disgraceful angels play
The maidens shall wash their blood away
Where God rewards the genocide
Outlawed Martyrâs Paradise

Decided and no doubts in his face
Fanatic visions of Allahâs embrace
Concluded with himself

Self perished, the apostate Jesus
Tears their souls into thousand pieces
The innocents will face the final court
And justice failed again

Where disgraceful angels play
The maidens shall wash their blood away
Where God rewards the genocide
Outlawed Martyrâs Paradise

Scorn will pale my name,
And hate will curse my tomb
God takes the guilt from me
And blood will be my legacy

Where disgraceful angels play
Maidens wash their blood away
God rewards the genocide
Outlawed Martyrâs Paradise
