Corruption and profit are reigning in this godless land
pollies and lawyers sold their soul to the devil's land
embitered advocates, who played with others lives
sowed the beginning of the end

Our leader, he preaches idiotic ideologies
he abuse his power while people starve in the streets
but tell me if you stand before the heaven's court
how will you justify your deeds

Black Star Pariah
Black Star Pariah
Black Star Pariah
Black Star Pariah
what have you become

War after without insights by the aftermath
a peaceful time we just know from the scripts of the past
and as a storm of rage ravaged above this earth
I closed my eyes and flew away

Black Star Pariah
Black Star Pariah
Black Star Pariah
Black Star Pariah
what have you become

I saw the kids smiling again
brothers who take them by the hand
I got a little glimpse of freedom for a trice
if only it was in my dream

Oh, we live on borrowed time
oh, our clock has run down

But 'till the first sunray pierce through the crimson clouds
I still believe in times of change

Black Star Pariah
Black Star Pariah
Black Star Pariah
Black Star Pariah
what have you become
