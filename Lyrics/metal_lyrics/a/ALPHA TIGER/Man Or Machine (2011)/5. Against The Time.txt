Once we were young
Once we were wild and free
With grateful dreams in our hearts

We captured the pleasures
Left no stone unturned 
The world could be ours if we want

Reach the sun
Before the storm will come
Thatâll take away my last remains

All by myself
âtil the clock strikes twelve

We have to pay 
We have to bleed
We have to fight
Against the time

The days passing by
And we run out of time
So there is no more time to waste

So donât miss the chance
To make your dreams come true
Remember that time is riding fast

Reach the sun
Before the storm will come
Thatâll take away my last remains

All by myself
âtil the clock strikes twelve

We have to pay
We have to bleed
We have to fight

Against the time
Against the time

Letâs go

At least we can say
Weâve tried all what we can
To bequeathe a mark on this world

Now show me that fire,
I know from back then
And raise a memorial for you

Reach the sun
Before the storm will come
Thatâll take away my last remains

All by myself
âtil the clock strikes twelve 

We have to pay
We have to bleed
We have to fight

Against the time
Against the time
Against the time
Against the time
