The men stride to the night
Try to run from their plight
Leave all sorrows behind tonight

Escape the daily monotony
Dream a life, how it should be 
Link our little worlds to a universe

Weâre gonna scream and pound the rage off our souls
And common we will stay âtil morninâ dawn 
Hunger for all that takes the dull from me
And the song gives me the strength to carry on 
To carry on

Leather, chains and cartridge belts
Outlaws among themselves
Rushing to the show tonight

And the noise fulfilled the calm
Live streams through the lines of our palms
When the band begins to play our song

Weâre gonna scream and pound the rage off our souls
And common we will stay âtill morninâ dawn
Hunger for all that takes the dull from me
And the song gives me the strength to carry on
To carry on

Weâre gonna scream and pound the rage off our souls
And common we will stay âtill morninâ dawn
Hunger for all that takes the dull from me
And the song gives me the strength to carry on 
Come on

Weâre gonna scream and pound the rage off our souls
And common we will stay âtill morninâ dawn
Hunger for all that takes the dull from me
And the song gives me the strength to carry on
To carry on
