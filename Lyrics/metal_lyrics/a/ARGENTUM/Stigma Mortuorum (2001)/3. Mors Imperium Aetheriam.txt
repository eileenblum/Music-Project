When frontiers being dissolved like a soft path
your ether exhales pure immensity in a mourn phase
feel a coldness presence, expands your hand on the moon
when the deep tide reaches the supreme knowledge you'll be into Infera

Shadowy temples of eternal cold
MORS IMPERIUM AETHERIAM
there is no more life, ease and hope

When the inner light cease like a dark sphere
go through the immaterialism that flowing enclose you
the fear by the urubus and the sinister suffering
won't be your liberty from the creepy limb of memory

EXURGENT MORTOUI ET ADME VENIUM
EXDABUS MORTIS VEL SPIRITIBUS
HOMO GLORIFICATUS, MORTEM TRINITATIS...
... TRINITATIS NOSTRA

When the cruelty of depriving condense thy world
a view from decaying sun as your direful destiny
it is time to join us to our mightiest empire
always built in a blasted ruins with mournful gratefulness
