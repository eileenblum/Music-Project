Floating on afflictedway, a sorrow grift inborn
the gelid air provides a void and obliterate my thoughts
a silence whispering involve my ens
transmuting the stone of life

Deathscent, transmuting the winds of haze
reborn, revive the matter of sun itself
soulhaze of...
... interdeterioration, thy nature of the everything
I will transport the worse, into abysmal roads
my last breath I felt... now the moon is gone

I run through the blesmished scene
degrading all inner disease
waiting for the ether's downfall
evanesae all earthly sin

ET ANIMA EIUS IN IGNE MORATUR...
... aggrieved sublimity, the nectar of tragedy
distressing fatality, astral nebulosity
withering mortality, exhilarant emptiness!!!

I pleasant my virtue to observe the reign of this
beautiful infraprosperity

EST HOMINIS AD MONADIS, SIMPLICITATEM REDUCTI
AD LAPIDIS NOSTRI... CUM MACROCOSMO...FERMENTATIO
