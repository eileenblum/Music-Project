Through the landscape, broad and green
Runs the river wild
Through the land untouched, unseen
Runs an innocent child

Carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders
Carrying the faith of men in his hands
Carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders
Carrying the faith of us all in his little hands

What the future holds for him
He does not yet know
'Till he awakes from a dream
filled with grief and sorrow

In the darkest hour of night
Someone takes him away
To prepare him for the task
That he'll fulfill one day

Carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders
Carrying the faith of men in his hands
Carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders
Carrying the faith of us all in his little hands

When darkness falls upon the land
His choice has to be made
Will he let evil forces dwell
We feed on blood and hate

He doesn't even have to fight
Nor will he lead a war
To save our soul he'll give his life
Become a shooting star

When he calls the sun will shine
Night will fall when closed be his eyes
When he laughs, rainbows will rise
His tears will fall like rain from the skies

Bringing life to field and land
Carrying the faith of the world in his hands
