Love is true
But it can die
When this true love
Comes from one side

All the love I give
You're raping
All the time we shared
You're wasting
All the hate I eat
It drains me
All of it frustrates me
For I love

[Chorus:]
Feel no hate, no pain
Why am I running
Regrets are in vain
It's no use crying
Hide my tears in the rain
Time has closed the door
My soul lies in chains
See the blood on the floor

Your hysterical cries
I help and try
But you don't care
You just suck me dry

All the love I feel
It hurts me
All these feelings
They confuse me
I love you
Don't I?
Then why oh why
You hurt me

[Chorus]

My feelings cease
I feel the snap
No way back
Time to attack

All the pain you gave
I gave back
With one clear stroke
Your skull cracks
Your life slips away
It was already taken
And yours had to come

[Chorus]
