Wandering through this forest
Away from them...
... who raped my mind

In my loneliness
Only the pain grows...
... stronger

Lifeless eyes shimmer
And the sound of drops...
... fills my heart

I howl
For the moon is full tonight
I crawl
For the heartache burns inside
Angels
They bow as I pass by
Angels
Cry tears that cannot dry

My well flows over
Into the empty...
... night

My soul bleeds severely
Still it cannot...
...be healed

I crawl in stone arms
Helpless...
... till sleep

I howl
For the moon is full tonight
I crawl
For the heartache burns inside
Angels
They bow as I pass by
Angels
Cry tears that cannot dry

Punished
For the things I haven't done
Banished
For the being I've become
Angels
Comfort me as I cry
Angels
A reason not to die
