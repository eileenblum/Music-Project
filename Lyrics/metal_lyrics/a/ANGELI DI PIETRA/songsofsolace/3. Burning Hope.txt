And as the world keeps turning day and night
The power of hope's burning deep inside
Burning in our hearts
Burning in our souls
Giving us the strength to carry on

Fighting for our future
Fighting for our dreams
Battling for freedom
With all means
Waiting for our future
Dreaming all our dreams
Battling for freedom
With all means

And everything will be allright
If the world keeps turning
Everything will be allright
If our hope keeps burning
And everything will be allright
If the sun keeps shining
Everything will be allright
If we keep on fighting

And as the world keeps turning day and night
The power of hope's dying deep inside
Dying in our hearts
Dying in our souls
Taking all our strength, we can't carry on

Fighting for our future
Fighting for our dreams
Battling for freedom
With all means
Waiting for our future
Dreaming all our dreams
Battling for freedom
With all means

And nothing is gonna be allright
'Cause our hope is dying
Nothing is gonna be allright
We can't keep on fighting
