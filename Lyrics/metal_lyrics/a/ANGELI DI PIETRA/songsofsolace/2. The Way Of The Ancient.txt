The path they have shown us
Is long forgotten
The way they lead us
Lies far behind
And what they taught us
We have forgotten
Their knowledge lost now
For human kind

They ripped out my heart and soul
Their words they sound so foul
I trusted them and now I am alone
I'm lost eternally
The truth it cuts so deep
Forgotten now the ancient history

MEN!
POWER!
LEADS TO...
CORRUPTION

Knowledge passed by the divine
Offered to mankind
Turned to their hand
We have gone astray
Men of power entwine
The fall of mankind
Let us find
Where we've gone astray

The path we've chosen
Is long and troubled
The way it leads us
Rough for mankind
Without their presence
All is forgotten
Everything's lost now
In space and time

Knowledge gone with their short lives
The ancient they have died
The world can't hear their never ending cries
Their eyes are filled with tears
Their children they can't see
What's hidden deep inside their memory

MEN!
POWER!
LEADS TO...
CORRUPTION
