Across the heavens, a burning star
Calling all souls, from near and afar
Riding the wind on wings of steel
All non believers wither and kneel

Split the sky, shake the Earth
Warmachines that plought trough dirt
Forests ablaze with seas poisoned
The human race torn assunder

Steal the light
Kiss the sky
Let the red-winged angel fly

Hear the voices of the lost souls
Crawling up from between burning coal
Beckoning to be set free
Freedom beneath those burning trees
