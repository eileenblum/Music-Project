When the woods are dark and cold
And the warmth has fled these valleys
he goblins arrive to start their wretched feast

No human can ever comprehend these rituals they are but reserved for the children of the earth
The goblins came together to perform their ancient rites
Deep in the magic forest and in the darkest night

Legendary forest!
Goblins round the bonfire!

No human may ever witness these strange events
For if they do, the consequences are severe:
They are bound to the witch-king's hands

The tale of woebetidings draws to a close
Remember these words if you happen to stray too far

They bowed for their king, he commanded them to rise
'Stand up,' is what he told them, 'and bring forth the sacrifice.'

Legendary forest!
Goblins round the bonfire!
