We are calling out to you
Never failing to bleed through
As we wait 'til the end
Poisoned needle, heaven sent

Man or myth, love is murder
Diabolical, it goes further
Words can not express our pain
Torture is all that remains

So the end is near
Chaos reigns our fear

We kneel on the frozen soil.
Craving for deliverance
Desperate thoughts fill our minds
As our wailing voices cry of bliss divine

Now disease consumes all hope
Phantoms devour our remains
Death reigns here, taking all life
Frantic laughter fills the sky

Mercy, we beg for mercy
For us, the Fallen Ones
But we will die here in this wasteland
All hope is lost
Mercy, we beg for mercy
For us, the Fallen Ones
But we will die here in this wasteland
All hope is lost and we will fade

War and famine plagues the land
The midnight hour's close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
At your hands we slowly rot

Never to see the light of day
The fallen ones gone astray
Needing, feeding, dying
Never to stop trying

Damned are the fallen ones
Craving for deliverance
Desperate thoughts fill their minds
As their wailing voices cry of bliss divine

Mercy, we beg for mercy
For us, the Fallen Ones
But we will die here in this wasteland
All hope is lost
Mercy, we beg for mercy
For us, the Fallen Ones
But we will die here in this wasteland
All hope is lost and we will fade
