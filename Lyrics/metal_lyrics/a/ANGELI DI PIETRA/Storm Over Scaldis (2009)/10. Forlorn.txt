Look beyond the stars and see
The child of ages came to me
It laughed and touched my hand
As I crawled the barren land

Forlorn
Is my middle name
Lost and weary
Nothing but a number

Life slips through my fingers
For no one knows the truth
That we are lost and gone forever
Trapped in endless endeavour

Forlorn
Is my middle name
Lost and weary
Nothing but a name

No circling dragons above
No false ideas about love
No chains to break
No freedom to take
No false ideas about love

Look beyond the stars and see
The child of ages came to me
It laughed and touched my hand
As I crawled the barren land

Forlorn
Is my middle name
Lost and weary
Nothing but a name

No circling dragons above
No false ideas about love
No chains to break
No freedom to take
No false ideas about love
