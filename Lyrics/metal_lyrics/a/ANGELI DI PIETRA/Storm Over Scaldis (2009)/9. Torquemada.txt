For ancient glory
and be blessed by the lord
You fail to justify
This heresy abhorred
So you torture
And judge all at will
Beyond compassion
Beyond grace

Torquemada
he comes for your soul
The inquisition will soon take its toll

The Grand inquisitor
The duke of hell
Claiming to do gods work
Retaliation of death's knell
You have no conscience
You have no pride
only evil reigns
in those bloodshot eyes

Torquemada
he comes for your soul
the inquisition will soon take its toll

Torquemada
Your time will come [2x]

Here he comes
The great inquisitor
The Hammer of Heretics
The light of Spain
The saviour of this country

Death by fire
is what you get
The sinners shall burn
Cruelty he does not fear
All shall convert or die
