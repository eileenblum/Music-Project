See me!
Under the blazing sun of a desert reign
I rule over these lands
My temple of debauchery, a place of wickedness
It calls weary travellers from far and wide
For my pleasure

Fear me!
My snakeskin appearance will drive you to stone
No one is safe from my piercing gaze
You are mine when you see me
Now and forever
None shall stand alive

Once I was beautiful, but now I am cursed
No-one can withstand me
To look upon me is to die.

You have gone too far, you can not return
Now you are in my power
You are trapped for all eternity.

Weak fool, do you think that you can defy me?
You mean nothing to me!
Your soul will forever be mine.
