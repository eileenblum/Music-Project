Sailors! Heed my words
The dark sea is unforgiving tonight
Rising waves
Will crash into the shore
The second coming
The howling wind caresses sails
In the murky depths
His throne stands strong

Wielding Fragarach he leads the way,
God of the oceans and lord of the storms.
Hear the wind roar for him, son of the sea.
Son of the sea.

Fly!
Like the wind
ManannÃ¡n mac Lir
He rides the waves on high! [4x]

The one, the daring god
Guides our longships back to shore
Under his banner
We will find our native land
Feast in his name
Blazing bonfires upon the shore
Praised be his name
Manannan of the sea!

Protector of the Isle of Man
He calls out to the water to obey his will.
Concealed by his cloak of mist he rides
He rides the waves

Fly!
Like the wind
ManannÃ¡n mac Lir
He rides the waves on high! [3x]
