As you turn the page with your crimson finger tips, leaving traces of red.
A message typed across my redened flesh that reads forget me not.
Words carved with razor blades to expose this a ransom note to myself.
With my head hung low avoiding the sun.
I bleed. I try. I bleed again.
Words.. carved...with...razor...blades...to...expose...this...I bleed.
I try.
With my head hung low, avoiding the sun.
