On that day the angels fell.
Broken wings and broken hearts.
Leave me here to soak this earth with tears.
Scream at the sky.
Raise my hands to my face and scream out songs of misery.
Fallin' stars and broken dreams.
I lost all on that day the angels fell.
Fallin' wings and broken hearts.
Leave me here to soak this earth with tears.
Scream at the sky.
I blame myself, but its not my fault.
I lost all.
