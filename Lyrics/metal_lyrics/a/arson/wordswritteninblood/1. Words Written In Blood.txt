Here it is a beating heart inside the same blood covered box.
Here is every word, every bleeding knife,
from your decieving hands.
Here is every word.
Written in blood.
Here it is a beating heart.
Forgive me for thinking you were real.
Forgive me for thinking this was real.
You fuckin' liar.
I hope your life is a living hell.
I hope that everytime you breath you suffer.
Kill yourself.
Here is every word.
Written in blood.
I hope your life is a living hell.
