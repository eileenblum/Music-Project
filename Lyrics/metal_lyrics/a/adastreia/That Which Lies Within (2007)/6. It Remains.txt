And so you creep in, alluring and cold
Dominating my mind you entangle my world
Violent within me you thrust at my heart
An army you grow inside of me
Consumed with revulsion for what you create
Surrounded by whispers my thoughts you invade
You linger you stir
You writhe within
Twisting around and around

Corrupting my thoughts you lay hell at my door
In your arms forever, in your arms I fall
Once lust, now poison ascending inside
Grievously you take me
You linger you stir
You writhe within
Twisting around and around

Here lies a fate, lies a truth
It will never fade away
It grows inside of me
Caressing me so viciously
It rapes my soul
Until I bleed it takes its hold
Condemning me to never love, never dream
It remains, it remains in me

Violent you grow inside of me
In your arms Iâm paralysed desperate to breathe

I am defiled, I fail to breathe
Buried inside me so silent you scream
Your presence devours me
My future is doomed
The depths of my being transcended by you
Darkness takes me
Tainted, will I ever see the light again

Here lies a fate, lies a truth
It will never fade away
It grows inside of me
Caressing me so viciously
It rapes my soul
Until I bleed it takes its hold
Condemning me to never love, never dream
It remains, it remains in me

Violent you grow inside of me
In your arms Iâm paralysed desperate to breathe

Grievously you take me
Until I bleed you take youâre hold
Take youâre hold on me

Lusting, I let you crawl into me
Inviting me with your mystery
Now poison seeps right through me
The depths of you

Broken, youâve damned me to a life of this
All that you are festers in me
Youâve slowly taken all of me
All that I am

Here lies a fate, lies a truth
It will never fade away
It grows inside of me
Caressing me so viciously
It rapes my soul
Until I bleed it takes its hold
Condemning me to never love, never dream
It remains, it remains in me
