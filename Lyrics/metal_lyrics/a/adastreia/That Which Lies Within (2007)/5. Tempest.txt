Silence and left for dead
I possess in you a fate beyond compare
Did you think I'd forget the pain?
I'll bury your hope to redeem my soul again
Now the lights fades out from the sky
In this spell I feel my darkened senses rise
In the night my insanity
I give to you, all that you gave to me

Confined here and left for dead
You possess in me a world I cannot bear
Did you think I would set you free
Holding me here in pursuit of you revenge?
Now the skies take their turn on me
Caged here in the tempest of your mind
I'll sail in the blackest sea
Alone with grave thoughts as my company

May the light reveal itself
May it fall unto me
I have lost all hope to chase the sun
My given time has now begun
Heed my prayers
Heed my regret for my sins
In vengeful winds my path is changing
Haunted by the tempest that you bring

I give to you, all that you gave to me
I give to you all that I feel in me

In this insanity I hold your fate
There is no tomorrow, your time won't wait
I'll keep you here for evermore
I'll watch you perish to my world

Trembling fate lies in your hands
Please tell me now, do I truly deserve hell?
In your world so vengefulness
You've stripped me off of my dreams
And so you walk under raging skies
Silently praying
Cursed with the pain I gave to you, exiled to this hell

May the light reveal itself
May it fall unto me
I have lost all hope to chase the sun
My given time has now begun
Heed my prayers
Heed my regret for my sins
In vengeful winds my path is changing
Haunted by the tempest that you bring
