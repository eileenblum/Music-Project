I will not play with fire
I cannot yield to my own lunacy
I will not bring to life the turmoil buried deep inside

I will not play with fire
I cannot yield to my own lunacy
I will not bring to life the turmoil buried deep inside

Beneath the shadows I stand strong
I will go on
My time is now
I am reborn

I do not feel desire
My blood runs cold
Oblivion takes me in
Distorted visions become my world, my nightmare

Anguish exhausts me
Leaves me restless and bemused with myself
Who am I?
Is this reality?
I invade such fateful waters
They destroy me, destroy the very heart of me

Obsessed with wanting more
Desire wildly takes me by the hand
I want to have it all
Alive, within me
I am at war with myself
I destroy me, destroy me right to the heart

I will not play with fire
I cannot yield to my own lunacy
I will not bring to life the turmoil buried deep inside
Beneath the shadows I stand strong
I will go on
My time is now
I am reborn

Lost in my own disharmony
I am torn, I am bleeding into an obscure fate

Don't lose yourself, don't cry
Rest your head and dream, dreamer
You are chasing beyond your reach
Beyond the hands of time
Desperately you seek to have it all
The fire in you has consumed your mind

Restless, bewildered, longing to find a way
The torture you force on yourself now must stop
It has to end
Oh no, it has to end

Beneath the shadows I stand strong
I will go on
My time is now
I am reborn
