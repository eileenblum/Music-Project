Lay me to rest
Let despair now desert me
Lay me to rest
From this life that enslaves me

Come deliver me
And grace me with open arms
And shroud me
Reaching for the fall
I hear your voice it calls
It tangles in me

Cease the pain the ghostly cries
Our ill-fated demise
I reach to the end
Let me descend
Free my torment
Put out the light on misery
Our broken destiny
Iâll follow you
Without you I am dead

Lay me to rest
Sorrow grows all around me
Lay me to rest
Now the fates have betrayed me

I begged for you to breathe again
To breathe again
To hold me near
And dead I stand without you here
Without you near
My world is lost

Cease the pain the ghostly cries
Our ill-fated demise
I reach to the end
Let me descend
Free my torment
Put out the light on misery
Our broken destiny
Iâll follow you
Without you I am dead

Stories old
Ageâs cold
I held you so precious, the light in my dark muted world
Breathe with me
I begged please let us be
I pleaded to save you
My love my soul dies now youâre gone

Lay me to rest
Bleed me dry of my torment
Lay me to rest
End the grief of my forlorn heart
