Captured from my tragedy
Lost in your wicked treachery
Blind to see your hold on me
Illusive hope deceptive dreams

Steal me, take me away from my tragedy
Take me there to the dawn of my dreams
To my fantasy that you hold over me
Save me from the fate of my growing insanity

In the distance of a far off dream
My undying fantasies they wait for me
I wait for you to come for me
In the distance my tomorrow brings an everlasting remedy
To wash away the tears

Steal me, take me away from my misery
Pull me through from the depths of my storm
And take me there, I rise to you call
Save me from the stings of a merciless reality

In the distance of a far off dream
My undying fantasies they wait for me
I wait for you to come for me
In the distance my tomorrow brings an everlasting remedy
To wash away the tears forever falling near

You grasp my desire and inmost love
Slowly gently crushing them one by one
Captured from the fate of my misery
Blindly lead into your wicked treachery

Blind to see you hold on me
Illusive hope, deceptive dreams
Turn away this mask of lies
Your cruel intent, unjust disguise

Captured from my tragedy
Lost in your wicked treachery
Blind to see your hold on me
Illusive hope deceptive dreams

Captured from the fate of misery
Lost in your wicked treachery
A dream you falsely hold on me
