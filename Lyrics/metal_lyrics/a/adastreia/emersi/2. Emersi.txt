Trapped in chains that hold me in the shadows of day
Iâve tried so hard to find a way
To hold on in hope in faith and secrecy
You tried to captivate my soul with memories

Release me from your burning eyes and tired thoughts
Release me from the cruelties of your heart

Dragged down into the pits of your despair
The delusions force upon me loneliness
The poison of desire sears my heart
Weakening my mind my trust my hope departs

Release me from the shadows that consume my soul
Release me from the cruelties of your heart

The cold longing stare of your eyes drags me under
Rising above the tide
To not surrender
Holding onto secrecy
Held down, by your obsession
Fear reflecting in the sea of eternity
Release me, free me, let me be

Tangled in storms of your decent
You long to sacrifice my life for your intent
Maliciousness of callous promises
You hold on to destinies that will not be

Release me from your burning eyes and tired thoughts
Release me from the cruelties of your heart

The cold longing stare of your eyes drags me under
Fear reflecting in the sea of eternity
Release me, free me, let me be

Tying me to the pits of your world
Chasing away the hope youâll let go

The cold longing stare of your eyes drags me under
Rising above the tide
To not surrender
Holding onto secrecy
Held down, by your obsession
Fear reflecting in the sea of eternity
Release me, free me, let me be
