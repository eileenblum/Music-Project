Iâve lost control
Had the heaviest heart on hold with the weight of gold
Iâve slowed my feet on these tired grounds
Where deep dread still grows

I canât be near
With these flowers Iâve picked, I fear
They all lost their colors
Time spread their arms toward the heavens
And bowed down to hell

Have I been giving you up for more?
Have I been giving you up for more?
Have I been giving you up for more?
Weâve all lost love
Words would be withered without you
Wait for me
Have I been giving you up for more?
You know Iâm keeping you all inside this light of mine

I canât see clear
The rage of rivers roam every tear
They all fall through vague and vast tunnels
With hurts of hatred came blinding years
Will they disappear?

Iâm far away
Treading a path Iâve made
And itâs laid with stones of fallen love
I need to feel and to make atonement
Before coming home

Have I been giving you up for more?
Have I been giving you up for more?
Weâve all lost love
Words would be withered without you
Wait for me
Have I been giving you up for more?
You know Iâm keeping you all inside

Will you wait for me?
Will you wait for me?

Have I been giving you up for more?
Have I been giving you up for more?
Have I been giving you up for more?
Weâve all lost love
Words would be withered without you
Wait for me
Have I been giving you up for more?
You know Iâm keeping you all inside this light of mine

Have I been giving you up for more?
