[Bonus Track]We have slept with waking eyes that calmly quiver
Dear are desolated nights
We're all there is

We let the sorrow sing
Through the stillness
Conquering
The sunken sun inside us will follow the hollow
For sorrow singsâ¦

We have celebrated death, our fallen feathers
Reminding us each day is best
We're all that's left

We let the sorrow sing
Through the stillness
Conquering
The sunken sun inside us will follow the hollow
For sorrow sings

We're greeting the grief tonight
We're bleeding by bitter bites
We're screaming with heights tonight
With open strings

The sunken sun inside us will follow the hollow
For sorrow sings
