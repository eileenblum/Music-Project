Seats are rusty wails
There is no light
There is no north
There is no guide
He's no more
Never did his tongue pave roads for us
To mend his broken heart
When golden tears crescendo
Let fall

The curtain calls your name
They waited then
They'll wait for now
Your time on stage enslaved forever
Let fall
