I woke up with charcoal hands
Clouds of grime crimes crown their hatred
Fingers bound by iron bands
In palms they stay clenched through the night

Wounds are green, neglected while I
Visit never-ending scenes, where the frenzy speaks
Words of just repeated till blood lust floods us

We open up to see hell
Keep my teeth so deep into the lips where fury cries;
âI want to see hellâ

Pour your oil into their lungs
Let it boil black, blistered tongues
We both know nobody returns home from war

We open up to see hell
Keep my teeth so deep into the lips where fury cries;
âI want to see hellâ

I know my hands still reach for hell
Should I feed them the fire?
I know my hands still reach for hell
To condemn or to crown?
To condemn or to crown?
To condemn or to crown?
To condemn or to crown?

Drops of bleach, discolor their eyes
Leave them never-ending seas of uncertainty
Still we know nobody returns, home, from, war.

To condemn or to crown?
When will metronome count alone?

We open up to see hell
Keep my teeth so deep into the lips where fury cries;
âI want to see hellâ

I know my hands still reach for hell
Should I feed them the fire?
I know my hands still reach for hell
Should I feed them the fire?
I know my hands still reach for hell
Should I feed them the fire?
I know my hands still reach for hell
See Hell
I know my hands still reach for hell
Should I feed them the fire?
I know my hands still reach for hell
We'll leave you for now
We'll leave you for now
We'll leave you for now
We'll leave you for now
