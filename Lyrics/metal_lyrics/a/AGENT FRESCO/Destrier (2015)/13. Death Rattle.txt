You are mine and I am yours
Stars have darkened
We eclipse

Let your eyes rest forevermore
Leave the battle at your lips
No longer you carry me through the fiery flames
We roar, no more

Mountains once so undeterred
Now, but broken, blackened ribs
So realâ¦
Can your rattle be heard?

Oil arises deathly kiss
Lungs of night breaths beds of mist
Love fades before my eyes
Sorrow celebrates your sounding ail
So now, exhale

You were mine and I was yours
Nothing ever stays the same
What was mine is nevermore
As the bell tolls out your name

No longer we cover loss with feathery shame
They soar, no more

Can I conquer all with words?
Am I crowned with wreath of wings?
So realâ¦
Can your rattle be heard?

Wept in mane a thousand tears
I can't reclaim those blinding years
Hate has bereaved me
Sorrow celebrates your sounding ail
