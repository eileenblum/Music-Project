You know, it's not your inner value,
important is how you look!
Do you speak true?
It pays less then false!
Is it really education?
Your philosophy, your creation?
Is it what they pay for?
Don't lie yourself!
Want to be fake?
Anonymous hollow voices
faceless, shapeless...
DON'T LIE YOURSELF
puppets looking through their
blind eyes unconsious...
The point is not your spirit,
your personality is not what they,
not what they need!
The point are not your feelings,
your heart means shit for them,
as long as you obey the rules,
but I spat on, I shit on them.
If you are human, have a name!
Listen to your heart, make your way clear.
If you are human, have a shape!
Look in the mirror and see,
see your own face!
Your own face! Your own face
Count and buy, buy to sell, live to stock,
die, but earn, count and buy to sell,
live to stock...
