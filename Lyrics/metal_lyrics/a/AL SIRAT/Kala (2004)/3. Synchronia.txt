Time to feel, time to fight,
time to stand and time to run,
to be sad and to have fun
time to love, time to hate,
time to create and time to waste
The passions make our ways and
all before you, behind you!
Life joined with milion lives...
All before you, behind you!
Life joined with milion lives...
Time to laugh, time to cry...
Time to meet and say goodbye,
time to finish and to start,
time to learn, time to teach,
time for sickness, time to heal,
the passions make our ways and
all before you, behind you...

Take a look outside.
You don't live your life as only one.
Everything you had
might be part of all humanity.

Time to play, time to work,
time to wait and time to go
time to rise and time to fall
time for weakness, time for might,
time to give and take a life
The passions make our ways and
all before you, behind you...
