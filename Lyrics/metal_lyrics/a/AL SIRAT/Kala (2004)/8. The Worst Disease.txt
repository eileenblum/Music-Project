At last I had my dream right here,
almost in my hands,
but when I tried to reach it,
there was nothing, but a shade...
So what should I do now?
Sit down and cry in despair?
Or maybe go back down and push the stone,
without an insurence, just with hope, with faith?

Walls...
Suddenly appear when our target is too close...
We lose the ground when things go too straight on...

How to find the strenght to save your life from lies?
How to keep your face clean in dirt around?

My heart is screamin' in me, sceramin' in me!
Whatever happens, I must follow my dream!
Regret is the worst disease, worst disease!
Don't catch this shit now!

Maze...
takes me in and holds until my heart gets cold.
Can't you see it's not for me?
I must fly high over it...

Can you find the strength to save your life from lies?
Can you keep your face clean in dirt around?

My heart [...]
