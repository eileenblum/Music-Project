Go on - attack me!
Let your anger be your only argument!
You cannot hide your fear of me as someone better,
then you are, sinking in normality
you pull my legs down to your,
MY LEGS DOWN TO YOUR LEVEL!!!

Wish me the worst!
Kill your feeling of your wasted chance!

Hurts?!
Yes it does!
I enjoy your pain!
False,
empty pride,
but nothing to say!
NO YOU CAN'T TOUCH ME!!!

I've worked for all
and had nothing for free,
I had to pay a lot,
love remains a dream!
But damm, who I was
and the future belongs to me
accept or fuck yourself -
or be my enemy!

Now I keep fighting,
'cause I belive that I can win
You hate my life so real,
'cause it's so different then your slavery,
'cause I don't belong to this,
so please show me your disrespect -
the only way to forget!
drown in your greed,
your jealousy just makes me sick!

Hurts?!
