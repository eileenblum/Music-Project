Walls
suddenly appear, when our target is too close.....
we lose the ground,
when things go too straight on.....

How to find the strengh
to save your life from lies?
how to keep your face
clean in dirt around?

My heart is screamin' for me,
screamin' for me!
Whathever happens, I must follow my dream!
Regret is the worst disease, worst disease!
Don't catch this shit now!

Maze takes me in
and holds until my heart gets cold......
Can't you see it's not for me?
I must fly high away....

Can you find the strength
to save your life from lies?
Can you keep your face
clean in dirt around?

My heart (...)
