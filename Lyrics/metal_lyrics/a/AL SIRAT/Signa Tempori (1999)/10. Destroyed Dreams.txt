You are waking up by hollow scream of you concience,
Drown in fight, which you cannot win,
Which only purpose is the negation of the sense of existence
To prove your madness!
When your whole life is based on the lie
And listening to the lies!
They made you stopped believe and feel
By forcing upon you their belief and feelings

[Chorus:]
And what is white, now will be black,
What is dead, will be turned alive,
What is good will be written as evil,
What is proud, will be mixed up with the mud

[Solo: Cola]
Don't let anybody destroys your dreams!
Don't ever forget your life belongs to you!
Don't let your existence be restricted by fear
Don't let anybody destroys your dreams

[Solo: SINgiel]

[Repeat until Chorus]
