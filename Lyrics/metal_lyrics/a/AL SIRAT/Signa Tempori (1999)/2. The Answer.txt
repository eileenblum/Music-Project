Sitting alone, waiting for nothing,
I'm asking to myself what are my fears?
Maybe the one, that I'll find nothing to explain
my flight into the flames...

[pre-Chorus:]
Isn't it the senseless fight?
What am I looking for, what can I find?
Do I really wanna know?
Am I strong enough to hold my life at run?
Who tells, how stable is the true?

[Chorus:]
I can't resist the poison of my mind
it hollows out my soul,
the answers will never be found...

[Solo: SINgiel]

Fight the stone and break on through the thoughts,
find the way to escape!
Digging in the past, reminding the moments,
when I missed mistakes,
far beyond the reality I'm chasing my dream...

[Repeat pre-Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus]
