The morbid laughing is taking me over,
I'm madly loosing foam from my mouth
My past thirst today my killer is,
Today my "Lord" is laughin' at my pain!

[Pre-Chorus]
And the vision of the power disappeared,
Has falled as the house of cards...
My synthetic system of values!
My great self!
But I still remember my dream -
Power and Might!
I dropped the chain of the sin,
I choose the Night!
Today in the hour of the death I'm all alone!
Where is the one, who took over my mind,
Where is my "Lord"?!

[Chorus:]
The deadly cold is penetrating me,
My hope has gone, I'm falling asleep,
But I will never, ever dream...

[Solo: Cola]

[Solo: SINgiel]
I thought I found the answers for all the questions,
I thought: "I am the chosen one, the chosen one!"
When you denied my faith, I splat it in your face,
I knew all!
My pride gave me the key, to all I really needed,
My heart was cold, just as I am now!

[Repeat pre-Chorus]

[Repeat Chorus]
[Fading solo: SINgiel /Andy LaBomb]
