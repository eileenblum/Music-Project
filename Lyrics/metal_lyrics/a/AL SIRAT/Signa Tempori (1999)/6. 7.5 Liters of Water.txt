Fight!
You have to prove who is right!
No matter how,
The true must be on your side!
Grab the law in your hands,
Make your heart satisfied,
Show who's the lord!
Be proud and dump!
Walk your way, make your rules,
Don't look on others will!
Pull the strings, be the king
Of your own imagined world

[Pre-Chorus]
Your eyes are blind, they cannot see
Things they don't understand...

[Chorus]
The sign of hate borns in your head,
The anger grows in your mind,
You have to yell, 'cause you can tell
Nothing...

[Solo: SINgiel]
So just be loud don't care, what others say,
The anger grows in your mind,
So just be loud,
Make your scream pull'em on their knees!

[Repeat until Chorus]
