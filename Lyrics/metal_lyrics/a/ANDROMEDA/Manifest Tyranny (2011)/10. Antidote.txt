The needle points at you and me
Shining in the light
But I can see a trace of blood
On the good doctor's hand
Epileptic seizure
For no apparent reason
Anaphylactic shock
You think they're gonna cover this one up

Stuffed up on the media altar
The beast still lokks alive
All hail the New World Order
All bow in fear and awe

And their eyes cannot see
And their ears do not hear
And they say it cannot be
Is there something wrong with me

The Galileos of today
Freak accidents and suicides
The scientific community
Is now hijacked and used for greed
Astra Zeneca, Glaxo Smith Kline
A simplified spelling needed
And it would read Frankenstein
Isn't that Witty

Take up the Rich Man's burden
The savage wars of peace
Now fill the mouth with venom
And bid the sickness cease

And their eyes cannot see
And their ears do not hear
And they say it cannot be
Is there something wrong

And even if those pulling the trigger
All but openly admit
Their anonymous committee advisors
All stand to profit

And even if you could turn some heads 'round
To see the smoking gun
Cannot do anything about it
It cannot be undone

Cannot drain the veins of our children
In hope the poison spout
Cannot slap the cheek of autism
And ask it to snap out

And their eyes cannot see
And their ears do not hear
And they say it cannot be
Is there something wrong with me
