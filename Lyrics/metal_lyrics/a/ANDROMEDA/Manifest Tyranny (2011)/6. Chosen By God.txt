[Theodore Roosevelt 1912:]
Behind the ostenible goverment
sits enthroned an invisible government,
owing no allegiance and acknowledging
no responsibility to the people

[Leslie Stahl:]
We have heard that half a million
children have died
I mean that's more children
than died in Hiroshima
You know, is the price worth it?

[Madelaine Albright:]
I think this is a very hard choice,
but the price, we think the price is worth it

Chosen by God
And the world has to answer to us
We'll show who we are
If you can not believe it
We are chosen by God
You are with or against us
There is no in between

[George W. Bush:]
Our enemies are innovative
and resourceful - and so are we
They never stop thinking about new ways
to harm our country and our people
- and neither do we

[Frank Zappa:]
The biggest threat to America today is not
communism, it's moving America
toward a fascist theocracy.
And everything that's happened during the
Reagan administration is stearing
us right down that pipe.

[Nigel Farage:]
...you said: 'the people that were elected
last week'. They have not been elected.
That is the point that I'm making, and in the
case of Baroness Ashton: she has never been
elected to public office in her entire life.
She takes an enormously powerful job,
and the peoples of Europe, of Britain,
of everywhere else - do not have the power
to hold her to account and to remove her.
And that fundamentally is what is wrong with
this whole European Union, It's all about
bureaucracy versus democracy. Things have
gone horribly, horribly wrong.

Chosen by God
And the world has to answer to us
We'll show who we are
When you least will expect it
We are chosen by God
You are with or against us
There is no no

[The Georgia Guidestones:]
Recited and translated

Chosen by God
And the world has to answer to us
We'll show who we are
And you better believe it
We are chosen by God
You are with or against us
There is no alternative
