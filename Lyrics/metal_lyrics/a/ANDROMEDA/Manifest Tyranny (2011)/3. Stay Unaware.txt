Suits - shirts with matching ties
Dull by choice but watch the eyes
Sharp - and just like our shoes they shine
Despite the darkness there behind

We walk the finance district
Concrete, glass and steel
Corridors and airplanes, an all effective shield
From ordinary people left out of the deal
But most important keeps us
From how we really feel

Keep underestimating us, we don't care
The last laugh's ours
The joke's on you down there
Keep underestimating us, hide in your hair
Just stay unaware

Deal - in our world means steal
Trust - fund is the first thing that comes to mind
Right - politically correct
Loyal - the puppets we elect

"Structurally reforming","modernising states"
A "democratic process", with no open debate
We come up with phrases and names for everything
Just to keep you guessing, we don't call it what it is

Keep underestimating us, we don't care
The last laugh's ours
The joke's on you down there
Keep underestimating us, hide in your hair
Just stay

Robin Hood has since long gone away
No one that good in this egocentric day
Day and night, we're speeding past the signs
Yes traffic lights are just recommendations for our kind

Some have learned to put together two and two
And then they turn against us, nothing new
Naomi Klein, who shocked you into buying
"The confessions of an economic hitman" lies

Real - estate, we own the lot
Love - you bet it can be bought
Growth - in the third world we just put a straw
And yeah that's right - we suck

Imaginary freedom keeps the cattle calm
Space enough to turn 'round
And a fair amount of halm
Well soon it's time for slaughter
We're lining up the PIGS
The smallest are for starters, salut, bon appÃ©tit!

Keep...
