Thought I was supposed to ask
When I could not understand
I didn't know some questions
Were frowned upon or banned
So when I first saw the shadow
I trembled and I shook
I grabbed your hand and pointed
But you didn't even look

My son you see shadows
Embarrasement and shame
But the sun makes the shadows
The trees are not to blame

I recall the sunshine
And the look in your eyes
As we reached for the sky
In another time

But at night in the dark
I just couldn't see
Couldn't see
And the pain and the fear
Came haunting me
Haunting me

There's something under my bed, oh
Don't tell me it's all in my head, no
I can't make it out in the darkness
But the contours look like a monster
Daddy why can't you stand upright
Mommy why do you just cry

Go back to sleep
Go back to sleep

So I never asked again
But I didn't understand
What was the point to have me
If they couldn't find the time
So I swallowed the shadow
And made it part of me
I thought that'd make them happy
But that was not to be

My son you're a shadow
Embarrasment and shame
Our son is in shadow
You're standing in the way

I recall the sunshine
And the look in your eyes
As we reached for the sky
In another time

But at night in the dark
I couldn't see
Just couldn't see
And the pain and the fear
Came haunting me
Haunting me

There's something under my bed, oh
Don't tell me it's all in my head, no
I can't make it out in the darkness
But the contours look like a monster
Daddy why do you stare through me
Mommy why do you just cry

Go back to sleep
Go back to sleep
