I wanna ride on a shooting star
Ride through cosmos so very far
See the ground down there below
The speed of light's our only foe
A mighty milkyway crusade
Nothing can make the feeling fade
Floating skywards at the speed of light
Oh, yeah what a beautiful flight!

Turn your head to the skies
Embrace that which never dies
Behold, for it's not a dream
It's me star shooter supreme!

Hello Terra Firma! Here we come!
Yeah! We're having some astral fun
Circle of friends, planets in motion
And the sun has a smile like an ocean

Mighty milkyway crusade
Nothing can make the feeling fade
Floating skywards at the speed of light
Oh, yeah what a beautiful flight!

Turn your head against the skies
Embrace that which never dies
Behold, for it's not a dream
It's me start shooter supreme!

Ride on my brothers, fly on
Descending fast, but still we have won
A mighty milkyway crusade
Nothing can make the feeling fade
Ride on my brothers, fly on
Descending fast, but still we have won
Floating skywards at the speed of light
Hell yeah, what a beautiful flight!
Come on!

Turn your head to the skies
Embrace that which never dies
Behold, for it's not a dream
It's me star shooter supreme
Turn your head against skies
Embrace that which never dies
Behold, for it's not a dream
It's me star shooter supreme
Oh yeah!
