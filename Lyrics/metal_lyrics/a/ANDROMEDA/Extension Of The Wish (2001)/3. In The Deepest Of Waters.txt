In the depths I saw something beckoning me
An ugly shape deep down in the sea
In the corner of my eye, an inner world so blind
But I know, yes I know; it's only in my mind

In the depths I mirror myself, twisted reflections
It is not me, must be a wicked imagination
In the language of sorrow at the bottom of the sea
The shape turns it's head and speaks to me

I am too many for my shadow on the wall
Into the deepest of water we hand in hand fall
Voices do surround, sadness is unbound
We dive, tranquillity in death is found

A shadow walks beside me, my liquid gemini
As I weep, It laughs, above the silent sky
And as I laugh, It kills me with every passing second,
with every passing second...In the deepest of waters...

I am too many for my shadow on the wall
Into the deepest of waters we hand in hand fall
Voices do surround, sadness is unbound
We dive, tranquillity in death is found...

In the depths I saw something beckoning me
An ugly shape deep down in the sea
In the corner of my eye, an inner world so blind
But I know, yes I know; it's only in my mind

In the language of sorrow at the bottom of the sea
The shape turns its head and speaks to me
