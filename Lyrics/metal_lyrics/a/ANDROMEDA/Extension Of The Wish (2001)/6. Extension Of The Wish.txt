This is where I stand
This is who I am
This is the way it had to be
Arrows point in every direction
Where to turn, seek to learn;
Lies in the sand of time

Closing my mind to remember
But there is nothing to forget
All I ever had is here, before me
Open up the opened and collect

This is the written word
This is who I am
This is the extension of the wish;
Conviction will blossom,
As failure laughs in my face
I'll still be waiting for my turn

Closing my mind to remember
But there is nothing to forget
All I ever had is here, before me
Open up the opened and collect

Closing my mind to remember
But there is nothing to forget
All I ever had is here, before me
Open up the opened and collect
