Again and again I fall into your arms
Your embrace; my only true home
My sanctuary from the cold outside
Your embrace; my only destiny

Archangel, come spread your wings around me
Give me air to breathe and tears to shed
Archangel, come spread your wings around me
Give me air to breathe and tears to shed
Feed me lies of hope; words so bittersweet
Save me from myself and the agony within

Archangel, come spread your wings around me
Cure my fever, heal my longing, everlasting

For this world, was not created for you and me
Naked, unprotected we have fallen, down
