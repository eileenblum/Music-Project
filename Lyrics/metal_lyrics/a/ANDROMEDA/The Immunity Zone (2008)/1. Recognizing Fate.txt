Deep in the soil
Trembling silence
Stones in the making
Tension release
Digging a hole
Blood sweat and tears
No rest and no sleep
Then - I found a key

Teeth shimmering silvery grin
Mocking yet serene
Gethsename staring indifferent
Stunning beauty in green
At once obsessed
Obedient without parole
Substract, withdraw
A piece of the soul

Deeper and deeper
Searching for years for
Something to open
I could not see
My science for god
My modus operandi
Of understanding
Stood in the way

This is the turning point
The moment of truth
Consider every piece of knowledge
Gathered during this pursuit
Confined, locked in
Convinced there has to be more
Browsing through all the schematics
Looking for a door

"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes.
We should take nothing for granted."
"The prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.
Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific technological elite."
[Dwight D. Eisenhower, Military-Industrial Complex Speech, 1961]

What are the odds
What's the statistic
Is there a reason
Or is it pure chance
No treasure box
Or safety deposit
No secret doorway
The lock was in me

Teeth shimmer, reflecting the grin
A familiar looking chin
Six digit figures could never
Buy the state I'm in
At once I'm blessed
Once splintered now become whole
Increase, expand
The reach of the soul

I realize now that what we seek is not of an external nature
But rather to fully grasp the full potential of ourselves
We were born with the most sophisticated equipment known to us
Yet we spend most of our lives searching for something else
Something to come along and rid us of our boredom
As if we were afraid to look into ourselves
Afraid of what we might find
Nothing scares me more than this fear
