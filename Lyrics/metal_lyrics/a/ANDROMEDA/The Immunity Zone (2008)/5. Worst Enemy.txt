I could have gladly asked for more
But your look was saying: "I saw you"
And as you turned away
I mumbled out that I adore you
But I knew within
That forced upon a choice I'd run
And once again chagrined
Defeated by my very own hand

I am my own worst enemy
I am the last man who can set me free

Ain't it time you made up your mind
Guiding voices pointing at the road ahead
Leading straight to nowhere
Temptations; never hard to find
But to resist will always be the battle
That will come back and haunt you

I am my own worst enemy
I am the last man who can set me free

Go without, go within
Go where no one's ever been till you know
Rid your doubts, shed your skin
Feel the loss so you can win over your foe
Only then will you know

Catching up with the train that ran off
Early warnings told that no seat'd be free
If I waited too long
This time I do intend to stay on
Delusions passing by as I stare out
Into the void surrounding

I am my own worst enemy
I am the last man who can set me free

And as the silence wail
I tell myself all over
That if this just begun
I know this will always go on
