Every generation lives
In the shadows of the last
This one's no exception
Before traditions set the rules
But this is something new
There are no directions

All or nothing
We are stuffing
Our waistlines increasing
And with it IQs are dropping
Keep on pushing
Blame it on Cushing
Sit down, take it easy you know
There's no point in rushing

Hey, we're slaves of the plethora season
No work to be done
So chill now everyone
Hey, we're suffering from indulgence syndrome
Nothing but joy
We have no choice

There's a theme park called the west
With high fences all around
So there'll be no distractions
Here we do what we do best
Exploiting everyone
In search of perfection

All or nothing
We are suffering
Taking their oil and their lives
And there's still no cuffing
No dominion
No opinion
There's not a new law or decision
That we're not in on

Hey, we're slaves of the plethora season
We need all the gas
To move that thriving ass
Hey, we live in the immunity zone
Time to rejoice
Boys and toys

In our corner of the world
Got nothing much to fear
So we turn on each other
Some girls have formed a plan
Goes straight past equality
This without deception
Injustice for ten thousand years
Now blaming anyone
Who can get an erection [?]

All or nothing
They're not bluffing

Hey, we're slaves of the plethora season
Those who have none in crotch
They've finally grown nuts
Hey, we're standing in the enemy zone
Let's head on home
Y chromosome
