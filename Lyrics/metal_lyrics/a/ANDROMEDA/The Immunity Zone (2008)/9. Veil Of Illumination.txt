Inverting the inverted in disguise
The past becomes alive within their minds
Rotten to the core, so old and foul -
Pages that rule their way of life
Eyes and ears forever sealed shut
Kneeling spiritually autistic sheep
Wide open now to take it all in
- Orders from high above

Can you see what they do
Erasing, re-writing the truth
Can you hear what they say -
One God, one path - Amen

Seven days
To replace an ocean of time
Discard all reason and pave the way
The science of God has arrived

Right through your eyes
The light now does shine
Blinding you - this veil of illumination
Across the world
The light now goes dim
Darkened by this veil - called salvation

From Genesis and onwards
Everything's been set
Crown of the creation
Everything is ours
Mother Nature weeps
Subjected to abuse
Naked apes with hubris
Shameless pseudo prophets

Can you see what they do
Erasing, re-writing the truth
Can you hear what they say -
One God, one creed - Amen

Spreading out - infiltrating high and low
Discard your questions and shut your mouth
The silence of God has arrived

Right through your soul
The light now does shine
Blinding you - this veil of illumination
Across the world
The light now goes dim
Darkened by this veil - called redemption

Inverting and dismembering their souls
Dogmatic scum - deceptive angel-ghouls
Histrionics, tongues that speak entwined
Preaching sickness right into the spine
Eyes and ears forever sealed shut
Kneeling spiritually autistic sheep
Wide open now, dead inside
Laughter from high above

Can you see what they do
Erasing, re-writing the truth
Can you hear what they say -
One God, one creed - Amen

Pave the way - enemies shall not be spared
What once was written must be true
The science of God has arrived

Right through your eyes
The light now does shine
Blinding you - this veil of illumination
Across the world
The light now goes dim
Darkened by this veil - called salvation
