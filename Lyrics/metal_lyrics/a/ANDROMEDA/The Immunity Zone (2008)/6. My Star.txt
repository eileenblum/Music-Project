There is something in the way that she talks to me
That makes me wonder if I'm really free or not

You are my star

You're a special kind of girl
The things that you say to me
They wander through my head
I am falling out of these boundaries that were made to break

You are my star

As galaxies appear those white sparks are creeping near
I'm no longer touching ground
This celestial incarcerator, my soft spoken vindicator
Circling around

Euphoria, I've arrived through my novas gentle care
Travelled through time and space to this lair of her

You are my star

Flickering candles far from reach
I know they are there, I just can't see
Blinded by her willingly
She knows what's best for me
