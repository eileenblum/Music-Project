Take your time but hurry up
Don't get tied but settle
Find some time to socialize
Solve the hidden riddle

Well I've been told
That no other one will understand
Nor solve the hidden riddle
Yes I've been told
That no other one than the chosen son
Will solve the hidden riddle

I arrived in darkened light
Of endless deprivation
Lost in sense of wrong and right
I'm here for the salvation
Clouded minds you're cold inside
Climbing your own ladder
When in fright you run and hide
I'll show you just what matters

We'll I'm the one that you called upon
That was begged to come
To solve the hidden riddle
Now I am here
In your presence near
And your greatest fear
Is to solve your hidden riddle

Relax my son, you are my chosen one
But not this way, I for your pray
Your infected mind has made you blind
All your shame I do not need to see
The riddle that is in your mind
And you find in yourself left behind
Come out of your castle of sand
Lend me your hand
I am not the one you need to free

Forever and ever
Beside of me you have none
The pain will go on
You won't believe it's true
Forever and ever
Without me you'll all be gone
The pain will go on
Whatever doubts I'll prove

Well I've been told
That no other one will understand
Nor solve the hidden riddle
Yes I've been told
That no other one than the chosen son
Will solve the hidden riddle

Forever and ever
Beside of me you have none
The pain will go on
You won't believe it's true
Forever and ever
Without me you'll all be gone
The pain will go on
Whatever doubts I'll prove
