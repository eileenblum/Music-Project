Sacrifice paradise
Ignorance, malice, ambition combined
Second prize don't entice
Indoctrinated we stand alongside
Enterprise in disguise
And our eyes, and our eyes begin to wander the sky
Telling lies, alibis
And we cry, and we cry as they start to multiply

This sleep here in front of me
Six miles from side to side
A caprice of geology
Standing mountain high
The wall whispers no apology
Doesn't answer why
The landscape changes radically
As it's reaching for the sky

And no one can pass by
No matter how you try
And if they let you in
You can't come out again

The flood will descend from here
And everything will fall
An arrogant decision
Our destiny for all
No serum intended here
No antidote in mind
All the species all the plants
From the beginning of all time
All gone away in the blink of an eye

Sacrifice paradise
Ignorance, malice, ambition combined
Second prize don't entice
Indoctrinated we stand alongside
Enterprise in disguise
And our eyes, and our eyes begin to wander the sky
Telling lies, alibis
And we cry, and we cry as they start to multiply

From the comfort of leather chairs
Turn jungles into fields
A segregated conference
Outsiders forced to yield
And those who cannot wield a pen
Or haven't got a voice
Are all labeled incompetent
And they're all bereft of choice

And no one will be spared
There's vermin in the air
And they don't even care
This will reach everywhere

The fire ignited here
Will spread from coast to coast
The center of attention
Yet overlooked by most
No island, no refuge made
These ultraviolet waves
Infiltrating everything
And everyone inside
All gone away in the blink of an eye
