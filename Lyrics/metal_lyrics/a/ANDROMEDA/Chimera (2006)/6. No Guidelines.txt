My ambition from the start
Was to rely upon my heart
I would not follow
Through every door you opened wide
For me to sneak a peak inside
I solely turned
To the path of my demise
Where you turned right
I turned wrong

If you got it made
If you got all that you craved
If you got away
I'll tell you now you're all the same
I'm falling without ties
I am the one that truly failed

I see you walking by each day
With a frown that tells of your dismay
I reek and stretch out
My empty, lifeless, withered hand
This did not turn out as I planned
I too had dreams
'bout a time and 'bout a place
Instead I live by your grace

You all got it made
You got all that you craved
I guess you must have prayed
All of you who not derailed
For you I hide my eyes
And yeah I realize
I am the one that truly failed

There's always time to tantalize
Always room for analyze
Of the misguided man
Judge not the unfortune one
It could have been your only son
You rose high I tell low
Reaching for the pennies you throw
Humiliated I fawn
For every time you make it
Every time I'm mistaken
And I know when I am gone
No one will ever know

My ambition from the start
Was to rely upon my heart
Now the beats are weakening
My omission of the verity
Made the search of false prosperity
A lure of grandeur

If you embark in my trail
Preconvinced you'll prevail
I'll bequeath no guidelines
You're alone when you fail

If you got it made
If you got all that you craved
If you got away
I'll tell you now you're all the same
I am the one who cries
I'm falling without ties
I am the one that truly failed
You got all that you craved
I guess you must have prayed
All of you who not derailed
For you I hide my eyes
Yes I realize
I am the one that truly failed
