A stranger to the night
I dwell in light, can not live without
Those healing beams make me go on
Peace is found inside
In flood or tide, winter spring summer fall
But when the sun is gone

And I fail to be
And this difference is a pain to bear
Although a mystery
I pray for it to end
But there's no response
And I fall again
My moral breaks
My limits I bend

Till I hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Then I wake up from this wicked dream
Till I hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Then I wake up from this wicked dream

Eyes are opened wide
I cannot hide, the fear I keep inside
To all who rest assured enjoy
My envy will unleash
As my weary eyes shuts with fatigue
The lights are out and here's my show

I release myself
From the cage that I now despise
With the night I come
In wrath I rise
Cause I've been constrained
But this shell that is left behind
There's no sympathy
My hate is blind, I hope you don't mind

Till I hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Then I wake up from this wicked dream
Till I hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Then I wake up from this wicked dream

Bruised and battered I wander among you
And I laugh and I smile as you're accustomed to
But behind my wall that you don't seem to see
I pray that someday I'll be all of me
Should I defect from life itself
Since it turned it's back on me

Hey, if you gotta go then you wanna know
I'm buried deep inside and I won't let go
In your darkness I will glow
Hey, if you gotta go then you wanna know
I'm on the other side beckoning you to come
Then I can run my show

And I'll hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Don't you agree that we're one hell of a team
Well I hurt you, I curse you
I strike your head until I burst through
I live it out, live it out, live it out, scream
Then you wish it was just a dream
