Pointing fingers mark the way the riches and success
Those who couldn't make it won't be satisfied for less
Fulfilling visions dreams where others failed that is our quest
Trademark of a caring soul is to always know what's best

Experience and innocence are currencies in trade
Separate the stupid from the clever with a grade
Ability and character determined at a glance
Do you choose your fate or do you give in to circumstance

Working hard for a cause we've never known
That's not our own, but

In the end
We don't need directions
To understand
What we should embrace
And what we should transcend
When we pass it on ourselves
Remember then
It makes all the difference in the end

Social climbers step on souls and hearts to reach the top
They've been told to not look back or down 'cause then you'll drop
Inflicting pain on anyone who's standing in their way
Placing blame is easier than watching what you say

Waking up to a world we've never known
The curtain's down, the cover's blown
Waking up to a world we've never known
All sense's gone, but

In the end
We don't need injections
To understand
What we should embrace
And what we should transcend
When we pass it on ourselves
Remember then
It makes all the difference in the end

And if you think you've had enough
If you're thinking that has to stop
If you're giving up
Stop

Looking up for a god we've never known
They say he's there just say your prayer
Looking up for a god we've never known
We're all alone but

In the end
We don't need religion
To understand
What we should embrace
And what we should transcend
When we pass it on ourselves
Remember then
It makes all the difference in the end
