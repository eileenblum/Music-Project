So now the end is here I have no fear
I lean my head on the ground
I can not feel my legs and my arms are going numb
But I still see the shapes gathered round

Staring figures, features frozen
Skins are pale and mouth are open
Someone's leaning forward saying
Try to breathe, soon help is coming
Hold on

Leave me here no need to bother
Just look at me, I won't recover
Don't forget to tell her that I love her
Now let me down, I'm going under

All the bitterness and hate is left behind
It's a relief, it's a high
I see my life pass by before my eyes
And there's no reason to ask why
High, high, high...
I leave it all behind
Hold on

Leave me here no need to bother
Just look at me, I won't recover
Don't forget to tell her that I love her
Now let me down, I'm going under

Hallucination or for real, I start to feel
Like I am floating in the air, I'm everywhere

Colours shifting patterns intertwining
Transparent angels singing
Come with us come with us come with us come with us
A tunnel rising ascending slowly
White clouds form a path in limelight
Come with us come with us come with us

So here I stand at the stairs looking down
I see myself on the ground
I look into my eyes, they're telling me
An inner peace has been found

Electric shock, I'm back from yonder
The pain is too, now even stronger
Someone's leaning forward saying
Welcome back son, how're you doing
Hold on

Leave me here no need to bother
Just look at me, I won't recover
Don't forget to tell her that I love her
Now let me down, I'm going under

Leave me now
Let me down
Now
