Oh I wanna be there
Where the stones lie still around you
Oh I wanna be there
Where the fire will not harm you
There's a place I always go when I'm feeling lost
When I'm cold
And when there's no shelter from the storm
Iskenderun

So I fall back into myself
Stare at the pearl inside this shell

And I have to go
A world in the sun
The darkness is gone
Iskenderun
And I'm all alone
Under the sun
Iskenderun
Iskenderun

Another Celtic Telamon
Another Persian Salamis
There is no guilt not innocence
There is no us and them
Jerusalem

Oh I wanna be there
Where the stones lie still around you
Oh I wanna be there
Where the fire will not harm you

Look what they've done, look what they've done
Everything's gone, everything's wrong

So I have to go
Nowhere to run
Look what they've done
Iskenderun
And I'm all alone
Under the sun
Iskenderun
Iskenderun

Terrorists are walking around me
And I walk among them
War lords, Nazis, kamikazes
When will they
When will they stop

Oh I wanna be there
Where the stones lie still around you
Oh I wanna be there
Where the fire will not harm you

Oh but the truth is
This is a place
Where I've never been
And I've never seen
