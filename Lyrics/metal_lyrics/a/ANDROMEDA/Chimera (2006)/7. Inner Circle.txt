Stone on stone
Forming defenses from the crowd
Brick by brick climbing the sky
No asking where when or now
Nor solving the mystery of why

Supposed to lead us all as one
The only thing they do is lead us on
So just be careful where you tread
Obstacles and traps ahead

Mudfilled trenches, barbwired fences
Spotlights on the wall
Guards assemble, fingers tremble
As the sirens call
But nothing's gonna stop us
Till the inner circle falls

Step by step advancing
Closer to the core
Megaphones that never cease
Old slogans all heard before
Shout freedom as a metaphor for peace
Oh please

The rising drawbridge's not so far
We're run as catapults recharge
It is no longer safe to hide
See you on the other side

Mudfilled trenches, barbwired fences
Spotlights on the wall
Guards assemble, fingers tremble
As the sirens call
But nothing's gonna stop us
Till the inner circle falls
