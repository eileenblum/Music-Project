Living alone
Is not the way for me
Words on the phone
They fade and die as I put it down
Feel like a stone
Emotionless, hard and cold
All on my own
I just can't find the way

[Chorus:]
So tell me I'm dreaming
Please wake me up
Pinch my arm as hard as you want
'Cause all of this madness
Makes sense when you're here
One &amp; one is two, but not when two is one

Tired and slow
Time crawls by us now
Distance's a foe
Far, far too strong for my weary mind
Opening the door
The world lies endless, there below
Don't know where to go
I just can't find the way

[Chorus]

What good are numbers anyway
They put perspective on the game
But we're playing off the board
Oh the rules do not apply

I feel it, the energy
Keeping contact intravenously
Floating chemistry
Protones, electrones, forming atoms, molecules
Into complex lifeforms

So in perspective of the game
What good are numbers anyway
When we're playing off the board
Oh the rules do not apply

Tears from the ceiling
That's how I'm feeling
Falling - forgiving
Call of the living

Tell me I'm dreaming
Please wake me up
Pinch my arm as hard as you want

Tears from the ceiling
Tell me I'm dreaming
Water fulfilling
Life - a new meaning

So tell me I'm dreaming
Please wake me up
Pinch my arm as hard as you want
'Cause all of this madness
Makes sense when you're here
One &amp; one is two, but not when two is one
But if you count you lose the point

So in perspective of the game
What good are numbers anyway
When we're playing off the board
Oh the rules do not apply
