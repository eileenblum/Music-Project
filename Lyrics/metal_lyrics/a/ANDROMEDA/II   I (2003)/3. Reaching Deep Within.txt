I can turn away and hold my breath a day
But I can't escape the stench of the lie
That's haunting my mind
I won't be free even if I'm deaf, dumb and blind

All those weary eyes with their wicked smiles
They come to my dreams, they're watching us now
They're after my head, they're after my life
Why can't they stay dead?

[Chorus:]
I confess to my sin, reaching deep within
It comes straight from my heart, where should I start
In revealing my thoughts, reaching deep within
I'm just letting it out and letting you in
Reaching within

It was so long ago, or was it yesterday
I can't seem to find a thread in my mind
A needle that's sharp that will make me whole
That's mending my soul

It's hard for me to plead, for your empathy
When hatred persists, whom can I persuade?
To forgive and forget
I threw the stone but I stand alone

[Chorus]

Dig in my head and you'll find what is on my mind
Take it all out, I insist that it won't be missed
Wake up the slumbering man,
Give him time to adapt to your world, I just know he can

[Chorus]
