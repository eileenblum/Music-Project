The time has come to contemplate
My dearest parasite
You take me to a state of hate
Where reason just don't apply
This secret curse can't be my fate
Or something I've deserved
My mind is set to liberate
Itself from you

I look into your eye, I let go of my pride
I confess to the lie, I look straight into your ...
I am the one, one in my head
I have no fears, I have no tears
I am the one, one in my head
I have no fears, I have no tears

I banged my head against the wall
Ran around in circles
Scratched my itchy skin until I bled
Crossed my bloody fingers
Kneeled down and prayed
Oh father are you in heaven
What is in my defense
I've committed sins, all seven
Is there time to make amends
Eight nine ten eleven
Escalating fast
Could I have changed the past or present
And for how long will it last

It's like I'm being cursed
I just can't quench this thirst
But now I'm ready to burst
You know, I was in here first

I am the one, one in my head
I have no fears, I have no tears
I am the one, one that you dread
I have no fears, I have no tears
