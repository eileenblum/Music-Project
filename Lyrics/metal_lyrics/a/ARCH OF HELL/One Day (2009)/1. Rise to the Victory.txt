Thats we are (vanity)
Thats we are (insecurity)
Thats we are (vanity)
and (this is) tis is the time
four our decision

infinity ends for us
who want to be fancy free
weÂ´ll newer see (newer see)
our path to reality
weÂ´re glad to be here
on the side of man
who has no fear
wait for a while, wait for a while
and rise to the victory
is there anyone, is there anyone,
who can let out restless souls
wait for a while, wait for a while,
wait for a while, wait for me

this is the waiting for a while
which can change the world
finaly, sincerely

infinity ends for us
who want to be fancy free
weÂ´ll newer see (newer see)
our path to reality
weÂ´re glad to be here
on the side of man
who has no fear
wait for a while, wait for a while,
wait for a while, wait for me
