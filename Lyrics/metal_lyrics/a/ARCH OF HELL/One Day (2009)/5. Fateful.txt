Like a human engine
I feel like a fool
She is like an angel
But this is not you

What you are?
What you want?

Never fall out
Never fall out, fall out!!
Never fall out
And open yourself,
Never fall out
Never fall out, fall out!!
Never fall out
And choose by yourself,
Never fall out
Never fall out, fall out!!
Never fall out
And open yourself,
Never fall out
Never fall out, fall out!!
Never fall out
But a little bit is over

Stop hiding behind
Walls of lethargy
Come, come changes
Are coming
LetÂ´s be free

I know what a I have to do
Before I kill myself
This is my fate
I do it on my own
Take my hand
IÂ´ve a last moment for you
This full moon
I want you to disapper

Desire burned you down
Fight for better future
Passion holds you up - try hard, try harder

Never fall out
Never fall out, fall out!!
Never fall out
And open yourself,
Never fall out
Never fall out, fall out!!
Never fall out
And choose by yourself,
Never fall out
Never fall out, fall out!!
Never fall out
And open yourself,
Never fall out
Never fall out, fall out!!
Never fall out
But a little bit is over

Stop hiding behind walls of lethargy
Come, come changes are coming letÂ´s be free
