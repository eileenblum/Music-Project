LetÂ´s go!!

Peace is always a lie
There is only desire
With desire IÂ´ll have power
With power I win

One monÂ´ment isnÂ´t same as moment ever
Wait for a while IÂ´ll change this place forever

Save this kind of heroism
Seed a waiting revolution
Turn a sense of felicity
Into final disillusion

Thanks of wictory
My chains will be
Broken, damned life
I wanna feel the pain
No vicitims, no victory!

Ha, you are madam, heh, do you think that will be ower??
I think youÂ´re only sandman
Hey you, let it be!!

Make a feeling, never see, never know
Raise the blowing, never hear, never know
Sense of misery, never feel, never know
Rise to the victory, I know I know

Eager for death? drink elixir of pain
Listen to elegy of blood
And than wish to deathdealer hunt

Today is time for revolution
To make our sense of life
Disillusion will be over me...

One moment isnÂ´t same as moment ever
Wait for a while IÂ´ll change this place forever
