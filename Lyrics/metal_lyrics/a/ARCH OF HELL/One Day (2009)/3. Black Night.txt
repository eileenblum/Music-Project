Walk around in the midnight
And heard the voices
Beyond the downstreet
Lamps are shining like a candle
In my hearth

Started war in my mind
Enemy
Am I letÂ´s stop this fight
CÂ´mon cÂ´mon die

Bad ages are coming
My faith is falling
Down!

Malice...in my blind eyes
You can not see in his night
Cuzi!!

One night,
I wanna know
How it became the black night
Never mind, never know
But must be left behind

One night,
One day
My life is in the other side
Never mind, never know
I have to stay, stay surive

Why canÂ´t you see?
My world in agony

One night, I wanna know
How it became the black night
Never mind, never know
But must be leave behind...

And rise confused aims
That should have never been born

My mind has been crucified
CanÂ´t you see
CanÂ´t you see
My world in agony
My world in agony
My world in agony

NightÂ´s shadows are screaming
And I despite me!

One night, I wanna know
How it became the black night
Never mind, never know
But must be left behind
