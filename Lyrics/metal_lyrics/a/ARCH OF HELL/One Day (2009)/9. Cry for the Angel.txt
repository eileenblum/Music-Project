I see the lights in the skyes
And anothre ones
You borrow my eyes
But you areÂ´n me

Please hear my voice
My fateful thoughts

[Ref:]
Cry for you, and
Cry for the angel to alight
Cuz my suffering cannot end
And I hope it never comes again

[Ref]

Enslaved by myself
I wanna fly, follow the light
And my eyes to stay open
But you areÂ´n me

I am staying alone
Please save my soul

[Ref:]
Cry for you, and
Cry for the angel to alight
Cuz my suffering cannot end
And I hope it never comes again

[Ref]

Begging for your attention
Listen to my voice
Need your help
I am hide
Behind bars
Of my powerless
Of my hopeless
Of my wilderness
Of my powerless
Of my hopeless
Of my wilderness
Please save my final breath

What have I done?! what have I done to
Stay alive?!
I tell you... nothing, nothing!!

If you ask me how I feel this moment, I will
Never lie
I feel only disillusion,I feel only sense to
Cry...

Do you hear that voice? Â´couse IÂ´m calling
You

Cry for the angel...
Close my eyes my beuty
Cry for the angel
I take your sense of life
Cry for the angel...
Close my eyes my beuty
Cry for the angel
I want to, want to fly...
