Look trough my eyes
And youÂ´ll see more
I donÂ´t wanna keep away
But stay before

Look trough my eyes
IÂ´m so alone
There is no one else
But you...

I saw the utopia treasure
Better for me
And better for you
I saw the utopia treasure
Better for me
And better for you too

Try touch the vision
Of perfect world
For lost society,
You need the save world

IÂ´ll follow my aim
While my heartvis beating (for ever)
And when thereÂ´s no way out
I would die for a fight
And you should close your eyes
Until my arm is out
Cuzi..I..I wanna live for the end
IÂ´ll follow my aim
While my heart is beating out (for ever)
And when thereÂ´s no way out
I would die for a fight

Are you satisfied??
Are you satisfied??
IÂ´m not.. I saw more
Are you satisfied??
Are you satisfied??
IÂ´m not.. I want more

LetÂ´s break down this illusion
Of our nasty world
LetÂ´s break down this illusion
Of our nasty world

We are slaves, together
We can leave this
Mosaic of blood earth

Look trough my eyes
And youÂ´ll see more
I donÂ´t wanna keep away
But stay before
Look trough my eyes IÂ´m so alone
There is no one else
But you

I saw the utopia treasure
Better for me and better for you
I saw the utopia treasure
Better for me and better for you too
