Look on torn in my eyes
And die for my pleasure
DonÂ´t try deal with the god
You felt in to the devil
Lucifer gaves me the key of the hellÂ´s gate
Welcome in your freaky wonderland

Our calm is away
Something has changed here
They want for tweny four seven
You must obey!!

I donÂ´t hear you voice
Like this fully dried up creek
ThatÂ´s my despair
ThatÂ´s just one of my deal

To die, to sleep thatÂ´s not enough
Point of your life is desire
And thatÂ´s my vengeance

Vengeance is only result of treachery
The another hand of forgiveness
Endless world of sins is calling for cure
And thatÂ´s your choice how to behave
Defeat is only result of weekness
The another hand of victory
Depends on you, what will be the right one
In your mind...

Obey!!obey!!obey!!obey!!

I donÂ´t asllow your selfish plea
For mercy devour by worms
You will be in your own grave
Forgot in devotions will be my vengeance
For your vicious life wine
And blood sin and lust

Like a selfish
Like a blind man
I had no sense
I didnÂ´t see your feelings

Look on torn in my eyes
And die for my pleasure
DontÂ´t try to deal with god
You felt in to the devil

You donÂ´t allow my my selfish plea
For mercy to be devoured by worms
I will be, in my own grave

Clouds with hail of my vengeance
So low upon your mind,
Your vicious mind IÂ´ll not let
You rest in peace
