Overall death
that what I am
join me
on my way ...
...to hell

Pain is my pleasure
Sufferingâs What i like
Come on my dear treasure
To the storehouse of death

Overall death
that what I am
join me
on my way ...
...to hell

Pain is my pleasure
Sufferingâs What i like
Come on my dear treasure
To the storehouse of death

Come on looser
Stand up closer
I smash your head
Without a sorry
Lifelles bodyes all around
Without breaf they lie on ground
These that bodyes

air's full of blood,
stink of death around
faces without the bright
they all stare at sky

and one of these body numbs
is your corpse you fucking lamb
your eyes gaze out
you dont breafing

and nowâ¦.six feet of soil on him...
