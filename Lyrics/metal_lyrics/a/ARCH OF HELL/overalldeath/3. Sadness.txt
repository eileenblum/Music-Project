[Swarm]
Skyes are cover by bloody tears
You were my and no more now
Who took you away?Who should die???
Who should fall???

say the words, which nobody hear
scream to a wall, which nobody see
tears are drops are falling down
every day round and round

[Dark Mistress]
Dakness around me
i stay alone (i can felt...)
life is left, strength is left
but you can't see

DonÂ´t you see?
I am yours
ItÂ´s better for me?
If I were not yours??

[Swarm]
youÂ´re crying every day
and dont feel any way
dont see the end, your fate
is Sadness and hate...

[Swarm]
I loved you
[Dark Mistress]
me too...
[Swarm]
but you dont see i was telling the true
[Dark Mistress]
i hurted you
[Swarm]
Give me reason for this way
[Dark Mistress]
Give me reason for my pain

[Swarm]
Darkness

[Dark Mistress]
Dakness around me

[Swarm]
Loneliness

[Dark Mistress]
i stay alone (i can felt...)
life is left, strength is left

[Swarm]
Cuz youâre lost

[Dark Mistress]
but you can't see

[Swarm]
Cuz youâre dead

[Dark Mistress]
DonÂ´t you see?

[Swarm]
Iâm blind

[Dark Mistress]
I am yours
ItÂ´s better for me?

[Swarm]
IÂ´m crying on you grave

[Dark Mistress]
If I were not yours??

[Swarm]
your way is lost
you are a strey ghost
if you can see, if you can feel,
if you can breath

[Swarm]
youÂ´re crying every day
and dont feel any way
dont see the end, your fate
is Sadness and hate...

[Swarm]
iâm dying and you wont help me
nobody helps me...
i am alone and stay free
one fate is Sandess (i canât breath)

so as you see,
you must see trought the tears
trought bloody, cruely tears,
life is lost in fears...

So, this is the end
We are Lost in our Fate
And destiny is for all
The same...
