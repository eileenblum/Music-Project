Wild in the night, Out in the cold
A pack of dogs dreadful to behold
Rogue hounds straight from the pit
Looking for crimes ready to commit
Infected with rabies, throats full of foam
Watch out, beware - Don't leave home
Bloodhounds ready for action
Stench of blood - A chain reaction

They're out for blood tonight and
they're coming after you

Dangerous dark, A terrible mark
In the eyes of a hunter a spark
Hell hounds driven by lust
Keep on running their trail unjust
Ridden with hunger, parched with thirst
Look out, take heed - You'll be first
Bad hounds wired to strike
All with their streaks - Yet alike

They're out for blood tonight and
they're coming after you
