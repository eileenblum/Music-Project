We're invading the city to start to riot away
You'll be a victim no matter what you say
There ain't no law but the voice in our heros
Nothing remains we'll leave this place in shreds

Thrash // The false
Bang // Off your hero
Crush // The weak
Hang // By the neck

Death Threat

Warheads explode to blaze out the way
It's bang or be banged on this final day
There ain't no religion but the will for mayhem
Out of control for this world to condemn

Thrash // The false
Bang // Off your hero
Crush // The weak
Hang // By the neck

Death Threat
