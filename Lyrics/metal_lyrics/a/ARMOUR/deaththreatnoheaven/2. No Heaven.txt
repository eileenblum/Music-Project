Welcome //  To hell's fire
Heaven can wait
Skulls and chains on a gate
Step inside to see

There is no return from atomic winter
There is no future for us to see
There is no mercy in the eyes of a hunter
There is no heaven for you and me

Nuclear sound // A metal explosion
Made you deaf
Exterminator // Feel his breath
Can't you see

There is no return from atomic winter
There is no future for us to see
There is no mercy in the eyes of a hunter
There is no heaven for you and me

Tonight it's fight or die and we're still alive
And if there is no heaven // Fight to survive

There is no return from atomic winter
There is no future for us to see
There is no mercy in the eyes of a hunter
There is no heaven for you and me
