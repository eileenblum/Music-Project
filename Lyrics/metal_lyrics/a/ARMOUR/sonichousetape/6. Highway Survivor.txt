Riding on the highway, out in the night
Eye of the tiger, my flashing headlight
Metal horses galloping on the pitchblack road
Rider clad in chains, under heavy load

Shouting fuck off to the rules
Shouting heavy metal law
Killing with evil's nasty tools
Bound to break your jaw

'Coz I'm the heavy metal highway star
Rock'n'Roll Rider
I'm the heavy metal super star
Highway survivor

Fighting at the road house, hate in my mind
Bad attitude, bad women, made only for our kind
Demon clad in leather, causing trouble all the way
So you better hear his words, now hear me say:

Shouting fuck off to the rules
Shouting heavy metal law
Killing with evil's nasty tools
Bound to break your jaw

'Coz I'm the heavy metal highway star
Rock'n'Roll Rider
I'm the heavy metal super star
Highway survivor
