Burning highway, flashing lights 
Speed demons riding the witches' night 
Satan told us: Play that heavy rock music 
Sounds that burn up your souls and give you the kick 

Speeding into the night 
I'm Speeding into the night 
To you 

Engines burning, your blood boils hot 
Screaming for your blood, begging for a shot 
Highway roadhouse, castle of our sins 
Woman come and suck me dry, the game is loose or win 

Speeding into the night 
I'm Speeding into the night 
To you
