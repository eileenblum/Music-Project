Love's crime, the desire I held inside 
Thinking that all else had died 
The Crushing thought of your holding you 
When you were not mine 

I need you - To give all you've got 
One first kiss - Lovecrime 

When all I want is you no matter the price 
I want to be accused 
If loving you makes things fall crashing down 
Let me light up the fuse 

I need you - To give all you've got 
One first kiss - Lovecrime 

Guilty, guilty as charged 
Still I'm never looking back 
The final verdict has been reached 
There's no chance of parole on love crime 

I need you - To give all you've got 
One first kiss - Lovecrime
