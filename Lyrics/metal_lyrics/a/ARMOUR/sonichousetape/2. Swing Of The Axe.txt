Rising up in stormclouds 
The battle rages on 
You say a hard rockin' man 
and his days are gone 
We will not cease 
until the walls come down crumbling 
Rock'n'roll rebels riding 
to steal the crown of the king 

Strike me half in two - and make me scream 
Or else I'll do it for you 

Swing of the axe 

I am standing here 
come and tell me I'm wrong 
Under this heavy load 
we have made ourselves grow strong 
Let the lightning strike and the whirlwinds blow 
Now let your feelings show 
Shout it out, no no no 

Strike me half in two - and make me scream 
Or else I'll do it for you 

Swing of the axe
