Time of the witches' sabbath
evil graveyard rite
heed the call - come tonight
Call the dark one
from beyond the gate
Show no fear - It's too late

Sacrifice with no tears
And our Lord appears - Lucifer

Recite the words to cast
the Black Magick Spell
No dream of heaven - Only Hell
The gates are opening
our Lord will arrive
Only the strong will survive

So forsake all your fears
And our Lord appears - Lucifer

Taste wine of sin
drawn from her heart
Wicked curses - Black art
Like an angel
in the dawn of times
We will pay for our crimes

Shut up with your prayers
And our Lord appears - Lucifer

There's always he who cares
Our Lord who appears - Lucifer
