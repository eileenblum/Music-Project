Climb up to the highest mountain
And close your eyes
Ride far on the arc of the rainbow
Reach for the skies
Find the temple in your heart
Open the doors
Feel the touch of the beast inside you
The power within is Yours

Like a creature of the night
White Tiger
The power makes you right
White Tiger

Like a song from afar from Tibet
From across the times
Like a wind it passes my ears
When bell of glory chimes
Step through the gates of your mind
Enter your own hell
Now heaven shall be bought with silver
Without a wishing well

Like a creature of the night
White Tiger
The power makes you right
White Tiger

[Solo]

Like a creature of the night
White Tiger
The power makes you right
White Tiger

You've got the key to your heart
You are the one
You can make your dream come true
White Tiger â Soon you're gone!
