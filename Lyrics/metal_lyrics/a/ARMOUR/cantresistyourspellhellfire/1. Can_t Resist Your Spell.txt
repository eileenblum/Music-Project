Dancing in darkness you came to me
A fallen angel who brings the pain
All I want is to fall
I'll never be the same

Give me all night - kiss me, higher price

You're a sorceress
Straight from hell
Can't resist your spell
You're a witch and I know it well
Can't resist your spell

This spell that you cast on me
(Black widow) let's take it slow
You killer and seducer
I'm never letting go

Give me all night - kiss me, higher price

You're a sorceress
Straight from hell
Can't resist your spell
You're a witch and I know it well
Can't resist your spell

Shining boots like cloven hooves
In your eyes a fire
With the way she moves
She takes me higher

You're a sorceress
Straight from hell
Can't resist your spell
You're a witch and I know it well
Can't resist your spell
