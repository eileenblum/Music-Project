All my life I've been fighting
To make a stand and shout out loud
The cry for battle against this time
To set you free
To make you see
The world is waiting for me
To take the throne

We who scorn the light
And stay out of sight
Run free - break out - into the night
We're born to stand and fight
Feed the flames we ignite
When we ride
The time is right

We are gathered tonight
To celebrate the coming
Of the one who brings salvation
To set you free
To die or agree
To raise your hand for me
To rock'n'roll

We who scorn the light
And stay out of sight
Run free - break out - into the night
We're born to stand and fight
Feed the flames we ignite
When we ride
The time is right

We who scorn the light
And stay out of sight
Run free - break out - into the night
We're born to stand and fight
Feed the flames we ignite
When we ride
The time is right

We who scorn the light
And stay out of sight
Run free - break out - into the night
We're born to stand and fight
For the power and the might
Warriors unite
The time is right
