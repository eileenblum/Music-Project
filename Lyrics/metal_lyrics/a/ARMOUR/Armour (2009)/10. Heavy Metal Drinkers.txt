Running in the night 
Under the streetlights 
Looking for a fucking fight 

Drunk as crazy fuck 
Out of money and luck 
Feeling being like hit by a truck 

Street metal strike 
City burning like a kike 
Puts your head on a spike 

Banging 'till we drop 
The cream of the crop 
Armour looking for action 

White russian 
Long drink 
Beer cases 
I'll sink 
White russian 
Long drink 
Heavy Metal Drinkers 

Vomit on the floor 
Growling like thor 
Scream out your guts 'till you're sore 

Night is burning hot 
One more pint or shot 
Your entrails will rot 

Crucified in sin 
The air is getting thin 
Fall to the ground like a pin 

All that you give 
One more ace up your sleeve 
The winner takes it all

White russian 
Long drink 
Beer cases 
I'll sink 
White russian 
Long drink 
Heavy Metal Drinkers
