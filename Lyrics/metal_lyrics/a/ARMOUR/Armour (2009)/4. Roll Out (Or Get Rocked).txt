Victim for the fist of steel
Power that makes you kneel
Strong arm of the highest law
When the hammer breaks your jaw
Chokes you down, out cold
Iron militia's stranglehold
Roll out before you're rocked
Left behind shocked

Roll out before you're rocked

Roll out - roll out - roll out
Before you're rocked
Roll out - roll out - roll out
Or get fucked
Roll out - roll out - roll out
Before you're rocked
Roll out - roll out - roll out

Metal magick oath I swear
As I step into your nightmare
A king of pain, your enemy
Your panic I can guarantee
So watch your loud mouth
Next stop - from heaven to south
Roll out before you're rocked
Laying there mocked

Roll out before you're rocked

Roll out - roll out - roll out
Before you're rocked
Roll out - roll out - roll out
Or get fucked
Roll out - roll out - roll out
Before you're rocked
Roll out - roll out - roll out

Roll out before you're rocked

Roll out - roll out - roll out
Before you're rocked
Roll out - roll out - roll out
Or get fucked
Roll out - roll out - roll out
Before you're rocked
Roll out - roll out - roll out
