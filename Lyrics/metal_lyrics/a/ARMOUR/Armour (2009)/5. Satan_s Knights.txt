Circle of the pentagram
Burning high in fire
Chanting for the devil
In uttermost desire
Hell of metal
Reveals the source
Of Satan's evil force

Come on baby
And sacrifice your soul
Now listen honey
The devil's rock'n'roll

Satan's knights - we're so loud tonight
Satan's knights
Satan's knights - we're so loud tonight
Satan's knights

Feel the sound so hard and heavy
Break your mind in two
Sons of Satan
We're calling out to you
Summon on this midnight
And call forth Azazel
To turn this night to hell

Come on baby
And sacrifice your soul
Now listen honey
The devil's rock'n'roll

Satan's knights - we're so loud tonight
Satan's knights
Satan's knights - we're so loud tonight
Satan's knights
