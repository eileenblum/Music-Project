You come to see the show
Solid wall of noise
When you hear the roar
You gotta make a choice
Leave your sorry little world behind
And give us your soul
I say yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah
That's rock'n'roll

Rockin' and rollin' 
Rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin'
Tonite

Well, my mind is made on metal
The only thing I feel
When losers watch me pass them by
The know it's for real
My scream will set you free tonight
Or crush you to the ground
I say yeah - yeah - yeah - yeah
Heavy metal sound

Rockin' and rollin' 
Rockin' and rollin'
Rockin' and rollin'
Tonite
