Behold and beware, we're ready to attack
For the power that is real
Stay out of sight, the warriors are back
To state law engraved in steel

Never turn your back
Watch out - we're ready to attack
Never turn your back
Watch out - we're ready to attack

You live your life in a dream
Where you think nothing can hurt you
Soon you will awake in scream
To our reign, forthright and true

Never turn your back
Watch out - we're ready to attack
Never turn your back
Watch out - we're ready to attack

Born a tyrant
Born to fight
Born to raise a hell
To slave this world under my spell
Born to rule
Born a king
Born to crush the lies
Finally to open up your eyes

Never turn your back
Watch out - we're ready to attack
Never turn your back
Watch out - we're ready to attack
