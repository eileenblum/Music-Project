Lock'n'load and ready to rumble
Cmon baby, kneel, you gotta stay humble
I've got a gun, loaded with a shot
Girl you're gonna scream tonight
When my bullet hits the spot

You better get ready
You better look out
I'm coming for you
I'll give you something
You can't live without

I'm sex demon - I shoot from the hip
Sex demon - Command of the whip
Love stallion - That's my name too
Sex demon - All I want is you

Bound in chains and dressed to kill
Ready to fulfill your master's will
Strutting in those high heels of yours
Girl I want you're giving
So close the doors

Hot, wet and nasty
I'll take all you can to me
