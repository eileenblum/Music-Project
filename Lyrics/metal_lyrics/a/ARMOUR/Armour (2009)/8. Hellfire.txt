Heavy metal, Burning fire of rock'n'roll
Eyes of the demon pitch black as coal
Storming inferno where infidels must fry
Hear my laughter where fallen souls now cry

Metal fire - Burning fire - Hellfire

Shining leather, Armour of the gons of hell
Wall of guitar thunder, The sound of the bell
Heavy as hades where hellhounds bark
Tail spin into the abyss, never ending dark

Metal fire - Burning fire - Hellfire
