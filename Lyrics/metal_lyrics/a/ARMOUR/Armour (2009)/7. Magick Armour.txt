The four winds and the shining moon
Sing their nighttime's magick tune
Protect us from all the harm tonight
See our enemies run at sight

Iron and leather
Skin of the beast

The life of a warrior, full of danger
Ready to fight, to strike and conquer
Grant me this wish to see the dawn
To face my future before I am gone

Iron and leather
Skin of the beast

Magick armour
