In the sword I find solace
With its somber embrace
Lets me cut through the screaming
I hear calmness instead
They are flanked by the angels
Hear the roar of the march
Chastise then baptize
We are cleansed by their deaths

Bring up the courage
To evict with such might
One mistake all it takes
Fallen houses of cards
Words have no meaning
To the deaf and the blind
Must not surrender!
"Kill the sin" battle cry

Doubts and true meaning
Always laced in my wine
They sink and they taint
As it burns in my mind
All this fright!
Why the fight?
If I see the creator
In my enemy's eyes

Ready for battle
Can I fight for the truth?
Beware of the shadows
Snakes lurking behind
Polluting my thoughts
Feel them crawling inside
Must return to the source
I am only a man!

See my comrades around me
Not a doubt in their soul
Chanting requiems to sin
Life begins at the end
I was promised the heavens
By creating this hell
What is true victory?
See myself in their sins

Doubts and true meaning
Always laced in my wine
They sink and they taint
As it burns in my mind
All this fright!
Why the fight?
If I see the creator
In my enemy's eyes

â¦if no one can tell me
What this life means
How am I supposed
To see beyond my own sinsâ¦
