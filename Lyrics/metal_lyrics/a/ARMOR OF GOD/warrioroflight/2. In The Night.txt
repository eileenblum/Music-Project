Deceit and lies
Is what I'm known for
I gather the masses
For my consumption

Polluting destructing
Not caring about Mother Earth
Just for fame and money
They gamble their souls

But when you're in the night
The moon is shining bright
Reflecting from the sunlight
On the other side

We can make it bright
The lamp I will not hide
No fear of walking in the shadows
No fear of walking in the night

Through manipulation
I corrupt their minds
My big entertainment
Will carry them blind

Beware from the deceiver
Don't fall for his schemes and false promises
Be quick on the battleground
A better tomorrow lies ahead

But when you're in the nightâ¦
