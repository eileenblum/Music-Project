I will not give in
Will not give on to darkness
I will not let myself
Fall down into fear

See with your eyes clear
With your soul madness
Around, a world of deceit
A world of despairâ¦

Will not control me
Will not dissolve me

I will stand tall with the power of truth
A warrior of light with sword in my hand

They, they rule with fear
They rule with hate
Weak minds follow them blind
To their demise

Do not believe the lies
Of the deceivers
The truth remains in the light
For those who seekâ¦

I will have faith
Will not be afraid

Jesus said I am the light and the truth,
Will lead your way 'til the end of days
