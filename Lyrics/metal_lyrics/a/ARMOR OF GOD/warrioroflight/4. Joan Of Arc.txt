Leave me to glorify... And pray
Close my eyes to hear and see you well
Surrender my will
To this knowledge inside, death is my destiny

These visions of mercy
The fight and the pain
Unstoppable legions
Must lead all the men
I will sacrifice all for your glory
In a cloud of my ashes ascend
I surrender to prophetic knowing
That the day it will come when I'll burn

Joan of Arc, warrior saint
Lift the crown to full splendors seen early
You will sacrifice flesh in a blaze
Pride and glory returned to the Francs
Until the day it will come when you burn

Like malleable metal
I am forged by your will, your light is so blinding
My mind cannot explain
Abide by Your perfect plan I must lead all the men

These visions of mercyâ¦

Joan of Arc

[Solo]

War banners in sight
Strike fear in the hearts, swarms of dust and prayers in the wind
Drown in seas of gleaming armors
With prophetic truth rewrite the maps
There's no way we will lose in this fight

These visions of mercyâ¦

Joan of Arc
