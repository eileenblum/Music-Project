Into the light follow the way
That will keep you save
Come take my hand live in my house
I can never betray you

Living alone never despair
Always seeking the truth
Hearing my voice singing my song
Of faith hope and love

Faith hope and loveâ¦

Feeling the pain deep in your veins
Trying to get through
Reach in your heart youâll find a star
Shining its way through

Temple of shadows never can stand
In the way of love
Listen to me and learn to be free
In faith hope and love

Faith hope and loveâ¦
