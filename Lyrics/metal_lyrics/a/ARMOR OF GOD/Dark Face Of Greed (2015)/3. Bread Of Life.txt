All the time Iâve seen the glory of the World
All in just the grasp of my own hands
All the time I hear the footsteps of you there
Without me even asking for it


Bread of life flow through my veins
Put the drumbeat in my heart
Miracles I can see every day
With the drumbeat in my heart


Everyday I have the air to breathe
Every day you give me shelter
Every day you give me food to eat
For my soul and for my heart


Bread of life flow through my veinsâ¦
