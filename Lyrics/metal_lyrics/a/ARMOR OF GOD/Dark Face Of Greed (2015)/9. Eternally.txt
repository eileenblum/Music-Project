Well I donât know where youâll be going now
But I just want to say
Let me be with you one moment âcause
Youâll walk a long long way

In your path youâll find some trouble but
Donât ever give it up
Just believe that you can cross the line
Of fire with your soul

And when you fall
Just put your faith in someone
Someone who gives you light

And when you hurt
Just put your trust in the one
The One who gives you live eternally

Well I can see youâve walked through shadows and
The coldest darkest nights
But you managed well to walk it through
Your spiritâs stronger now

You remembered what Iâve told you that
Would keep you on your way
Always find your strength in spirit from
The heartâs eternal flame
