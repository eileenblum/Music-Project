You told me to stay
I believed that nothing mattered in this
Ordinary world

Follow me you said
You donât have to carry that burden
All by yourself


And I go on my way to paradise lost
And I know that I have to face my fears
I believe in the power of the winter sun
Where Iâll be far away from the shadows

Beyond the gold wide open door
Beneath the gates of splendor
Reveal the majesty
It is your destiny

Rain fallen hear the thunderstorm
The sea waves beating down the shore
Itâs just another rainy night
Donât be afraid of what youâll find

They pushed me away
I showed them that nothing mattered
When thereâs fire in the way

Clouds again someday
Remember the moonlight shining
When it clears the air

I forgot all the things that I shouldâve known
To reveal the secrets of the sea
And I go into journeys of sad sorrow
But I know soon Iâll be in harmony

Beyond the gold wide open doorâ¦
