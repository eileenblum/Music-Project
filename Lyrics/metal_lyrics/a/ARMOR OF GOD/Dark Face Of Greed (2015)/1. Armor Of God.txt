Be strong in the Lord
And in His mighty power
Put on the whole Armor of God
So you stand firm against evil

Our Battleâs not against flesh and blood
But against the rulers of darkness in this World
Put on the whole Armor of God
So you can stand your ground in the evil day

Stay firm with the belt of truth buckled around your waist
With the breastplate of righteousness in place
And with your feet fitted with the readiness
That comes from the gospel of peaceâ¦

Put on the Armor of God [2x]
The Armor Of Godâ¦

In addition to all this
Take on the shield of faith
With which you can extinguish
All the flaming arrows of the evil one

Take the helmet of salvation
And the sword of the Spirit
Which is the word of God

Put on the Armor of God [2x]
The Armor Of Godâ¦
