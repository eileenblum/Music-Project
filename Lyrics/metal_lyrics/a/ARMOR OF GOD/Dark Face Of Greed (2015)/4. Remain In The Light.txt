Iâve been searching all my life
For the truth Iâm meant to find

And I will keep on going on
In the light of the stars

Cause I will remain in the light
Even though itâs hard to survive
In my dreams I have seen whatâs in me
And my soulâs leaving away from the pain

East and west and north to south
Light and dark are all around

But I know what to see
Truth will find its destiny

Cause I will remain in the lightâ¦
