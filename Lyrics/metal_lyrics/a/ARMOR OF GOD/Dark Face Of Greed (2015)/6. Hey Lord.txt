Hey Lord â¦Here I am
Hey Lordâ¦Listen to me

You showed me the way
That would lead me through the day
You give me the peace
That gave me the air to breath

I need to be beside you
Cause inside my mind now I know
Only for Love
You gave me my liberty

Hey Lordâ¦Fight beside me
Hey Lordâ¦ Live inside me
