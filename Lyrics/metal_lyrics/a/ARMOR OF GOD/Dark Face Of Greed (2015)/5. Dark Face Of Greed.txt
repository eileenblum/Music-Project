The Ritz and the glamour call you to succeed
Your wants and desires the dark one fulfills

Intoxicating and blinding chains no one can see
Hearts that grows heavy as the spirit is drained

Your essence corrupted
Youâre feeding the beast
Resisting is futile
Fulfilling their deeds

Shadows theyâre growing
Surrounding your lives
The evil and hatred
Controlling your minds

As you get near the prize feel the pull to compromise
They demand allegiance through forsaken vows

As you take the plunge into the dark black sea
Monsters of deep swallow your will

Your essence corrupted
Youâre feeding the beast
Resisting is futile
Fulfilling their deeds

Shadows theyâre growing
Surrounding your lives
The evil and hatred
Controlling your minds
Break free from the tyranny
Disguised as liberty
Stop filling the void
With the dark face of greed
