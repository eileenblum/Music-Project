How many beautiful things I have learned
Through the gift of time
Every action every deed every word
Counts for something

To take the time to find the Wisdom
To learn to know the way
To go through time with all its seasons
Will make us fly away

To the Heavens with Godâ¦
Will help you find the truth
To the Heavens with Godâ¦
Will make you know the truth

Remember all eternity
Remember what itâs worth it
The price is paid for you to live
In ever awe and wonder

The most important thing in life
To live with joy in your soul
To live forever in His presence
Will make us fly away
