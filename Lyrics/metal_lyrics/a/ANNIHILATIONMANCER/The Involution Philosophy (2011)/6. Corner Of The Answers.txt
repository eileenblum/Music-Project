Voice inside, that declares..
Voice of mind is screaming through your deceives
Donât relieve the pain with tears of despair
You can see but you close your eyes
You cannot see so you want open your eyes
Not remain, in your dialogues of solitude
Human envy twists the mind
Human mind is twisted, concrete delight
Sublimizing any apparent identity
Refuting to appear yourself
You search an answer and bite your hands
disappear behind your individual failures
Accusing you to be the cause, donât inflict faults to your exteriority
Youâll find residues of existence, undervaluing your personality
Escaping from your shade, youâll donât meet changing reality
Abusing of your silence, you cannot see the deformities
Around your fears
Feel the pain, in the (the) corner of the answers!
As fear that silent waits
As anguish in you takes you by hands
Show you unable in front your possibility to react
Human hate twists the thoughts
Human thoughts are twisting, convulsed morse
Donât search the way with farce of the rancour
You can be deviating your life
You cannot be yourself, simulating all the time
Excluding,
from your potential spiritual rivalry
So you scream against you
All around of you turn with no change
Look in your hands and feel your vitality
