Poem of falsity
Tells as the truth is denied by the mind
Between ash of hatred
Children of reality play with the lies
Falls the flag of delusion
Sign of a symbol of mankind unrise
While the dignity dies
Politics dance behind the table of disguise
Guiding the soul through the journey of misery
Vain are the voices, ethereal promises
Silent belief, eyes of the destiny,
tell me your pain, man with no land
Fading away the meaning of life
Abandoned paths uncultivated fields of the verity
The existence is defiled with the hypocrisy
Need to exist, a solitary dawn consumes so far away
Staring eyes within the horizon
Every time I feel to search my way
Illusion is dark way can be so long
Painting hopes with a whisper forever more
Every time I feel the cold through my fate
In my eyes a spirit mirror to reflect my await
Illusion a dark way can be so long
Covered hopes with the whispers forever more
Poetry of decay
Tells as humanity cries for the dying
Children of despair
Take the remains of reality, in lie
Miserable is the value of identity
Strong is the sense of authentic/exist
respect of a man in peace
respect of a man belongs his land
forging the soul through the journey of misery
vain are the hopes, eternal vengeance
silent belief, eyes of the destiny, tell me your pain man with no land
