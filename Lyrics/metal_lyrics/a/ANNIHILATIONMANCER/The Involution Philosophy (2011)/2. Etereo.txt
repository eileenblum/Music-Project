Fervour, invisible touch of soul,
mind controls the strength
Emerged! Human! You are not a servant!
Caress of existence, quiets
The sort of Change!
The spirit journey
Etereo, emptiness, unformed reality
Nobody knows the absolute truth
of all that it lives and evolves
hope to entrap you in a dream sphere, into the plain visions
Heaven and hell, inventions! Human irrational shelter
Individual pain, no control for it, oneâs way in life
Useless art, to deny itself with the invisible human deceit
External side, remains, and the terrene, the essence in life transpires
Sorrow and lunacy into human mindâs edge
Crossing your mind, concerning, waits for a life of dignity
Follow a way, to find the equilibrium and existence
Guiding your mind, donât confuse the lie with pain and despair
Etereo!
Ardour, internal enchanted mind, timorous of that is not
Suffered life, hate against, misanthropic screen
To be or not! The unbe! Now the answer is completed
Searched before and found then, authentic mean to be
Nobody knows the absolute truth of that it lives and dies
Hope to reach an unlimited strength, scenes of a lived life
Heaven an hell, inventions! Human irrational shelter
Individual fear of inhuman acts
futile struggle through chaos and well
