Beyond the uneven mindâs signs part of you
Spirit assumes the features of the human strain
Pain is nectar flows between the hurt of soul
Fear pervades the corner of despair, filling empty thoughts
Confused research of imaginary traps, unconscious known
Mind fails! Mind switches! Dying in itself
It escapes from you, it escapes from fate, unaware pain
Feed your soul feed your self, looking you around
Can to see where the limits die,
can to see the human ways invented by the soul
With the eyes of mind you can look far,
close your eyes to feel the spirit inside, itâs the call of soul
Past wedges between the hands, far beyond the reality,
misleading human scopes
Dim lights of dispersion, collapse forming the end of to be
You cannot see with your mind the obscure path of the lie
Untruth is sweet and your brain receive it itâs the impulse of unknown
Philosophy of involution
Mind violation contains all forms of uncertainty and trust,
you donât believe to your pain
Virtual/ confliction, harm of life, the ways of disgust
Donât known the meaning of all that you know
The involution philosophy
Ethic, refuges Iâll never conceive
Abstract forms of complexity
Combined greed to domain the obverse complete
Illicit fears for human sacrileges

Fragments of the human decay take their superiority
Eluding the equity of any balance, base of the existence
Life assumes the meaning of inhuman tragedy
Imperfect ways of the pain, of human futility
Whereâs your scope? Whereâs your soul?
Mind fails! Mind switches! Dying in itself
Escape from you, escape from the fate, unaware pain
Donât cease to exist, form your reflex, looking you inside
Can to see where the limits die,
can to hear the last atrocious silence of a dying call
With the eyes of the conscience,
fading far,
close your eyes to feel the spirit inside, youâre breathing free
Past wedges between the hands
A human voice is dying, a useless body with no soul
