Failing God of the subtle existence
Failing God on the falling throne
Obverse decay to a forged reality
Human eyes watch the dawn of regression
Human eyes
human breath of pain
Engraved the dreams screened by hypocrisy

Walkin' on a thousand of forms,
Human trap in a circle of life
The last salvation to born again
In truth the dethroned God raises the chalice of mistakes

Betrayal in the undefined symbol of misanthropic existence
Delusory intentions to perforate nucleus of conflicts
Annihilating all that could be a sign of dignity
Poems of the dying presence deny the laws of morality

Failing God Existence
Failing God Existence

Innocence, eyes of the resignation
Upon the throne of the ethereal pride
Ignorance of the inhuman sub existence
Suffering, bleeds the altar of the rights
Nothing more into graves of seclusion
You can not see the burial of the lies
Impoverishment of the god existence
Ethnic trial, extermination sign
