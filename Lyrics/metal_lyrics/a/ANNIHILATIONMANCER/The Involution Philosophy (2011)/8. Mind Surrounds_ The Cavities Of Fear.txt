Turn the keys of mind, closing in the voice too
With the eyes of fears, you scan through the edge of identity
Wrapped of lying words cannot perceives the evil
That you see so far is trapped in your mind of inferiority
Spiritual posture to ignore the spirit
Sculptor of the thoughts imposes its relief of malevolence
Unable mind of hesitations, impede to look beyond any limitation
Inside the soul, mind hears it self and then, compressing to reality
defeats the fears
Voice of the insane who silent breaks the inconsistent wall of normality, become voracious
Uncertain to see the end, you shut your mind
Overturning the summit of choices, donât compromise your reasons
Asymmetry of angular thoughts, fear and pride
Understanding the meaning of life, you know your destiny
Donât close your eyes
donât be afraid of that you feel
and your fears cannot injures you
Mind surrounds, the cavities of fear
Turn the keys of mind, closing in the silence too
Fears are in you contained, but you know all you certainties
Mirror of the soul, reflects that cannot see
That you feel so far is now here but your mind is shut again
Sculptor of the thoughts impose its relief
Breathe your spirit, lead your mind of sanity
Unable mind to support the unconscious, finds refuge into commiseration
Inside the soul, fear rejects it self, it breaks the harm of reality
cannot assails your thoughts
Mind with no defence, who silent breaks the inconsistent wall of normality become voracious
