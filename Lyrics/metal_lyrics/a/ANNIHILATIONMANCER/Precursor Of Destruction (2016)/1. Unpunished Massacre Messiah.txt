I remember that cursed day
When our bodies were sunk into hell
extreme sentence to die
Conceived behind religious lies

It was the hand of hatred to destroy me
Watching the light of the end
Organized gestures of death messiah â¦for this way!
Suffocate them with their own arid blood
Vindication of their godâs side
Their violence ceases beyond the holy ways
A sacred earth they will never have
Orgies of blood, behind the vain God
increasing mass deceases
human remains on the land of despair cover the spits of humanity
existing state of spirit decay dissolves with next abuse
their empty souls consume
carnal rites upon the cross
amassing corpses for war
Souls inhales stench of hate
Carbonized flesh, adornment of the cries

Losers in their spirit as sign of false creed
Under an endemic flux of lunacy
Condemned minds compel for suicide re-act
Hypocrite alliance to obtain the last unholy salvation

Spreading the death in the name of god, the endless pain
Perishing in the pit of existence
Another genocide, new executions, graves of blood (blood and graves)
I feel inside my mind those atrocious screams
Consecration of peace and the unholy wars
A tomorrow is denied to the principles of hostility
Flag of dismay is bleeding again and their voice disappear
Behind the podium of dissection
