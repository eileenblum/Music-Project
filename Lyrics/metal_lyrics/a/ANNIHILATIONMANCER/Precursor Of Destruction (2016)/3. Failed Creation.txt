Sacred shine, apostles of creed, human seals across the godless reign
Betrayal crown, burns in the blood, context of peace, theme of useless sense
Archaic laws for a nuclear god, religious faiths, hatred is the sign
The masterâs war, eyes of scorn, corrupted soul rots into the senselessness

Man! Inert, you see the truth through the webs of ideology
Verses of pain, obscurity of light, we wait for the last opportunity

Voices of the time, the beginning of a new way, touch of the sacral mentality
what mind cannot see, tangled in the blood, strained in the failed creation
searching the way of persuasion and belief, under the rite, the edge of disgrace
the breeding lust, emptiness mind, ancient creeds disclose the regression

Mourning light, mourning sites, failing runes of the godless reigns
betrayal crown, the treason walls, context of peace, theme of useless sense
nuclear war with rocks and swords, paradox of sub-reality
the masterâs war, creation of chaos, institutional souls live in the ignorance

Make your last choice/ crying of despair
See through the hate/ terms of existence
Sacrament of blood/ violence in my eyes
You are the only god/ failed creation
