Son, Son of sun
Sum, sum of light
Something across skies at night
(Zombie god with no will but to create.)
Preserved, burning bright â to save us at the end of time?
Or to guide us and enslave our mind?
Insignificant savior to the blind
Enliched organic altar
âArise to save your swine.
A man is possessed by god how a dam is possessed by logs.â
Surging swell of light like an explosion
The essence of night controls the erosion of undigested diatribes
(Zombie god with no will but to create.)
