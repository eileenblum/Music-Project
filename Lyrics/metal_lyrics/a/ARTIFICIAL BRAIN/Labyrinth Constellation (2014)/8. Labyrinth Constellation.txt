Solitude â truth in absence
A million light-years awayâ¦

[Chorus:]
A barren abyss â broken
In pieces, flaking frozen)

Stewing, swirling, slow motion labyrinth constellation
I alone speak with the wobbling sun
It cries to me as it licks stars clean

[Chorus]

âBut even though my fire has grown cold, its embers burnâ¦
â¦My embers have the patience of piranhas.
In my renaissance, my tongues will be trees.
I will vomit thunder through teeth made of mountains.
So many tides have flushed my age away
And with it worn darkness to grey.â
