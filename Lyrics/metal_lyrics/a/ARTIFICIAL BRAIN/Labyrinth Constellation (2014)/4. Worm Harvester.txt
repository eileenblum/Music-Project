Punctured - by a thousand probing pinheads
Blanketed - by fleshbeds of syringes
Paralyzed - in muffled writhing
Suffocating - frozen in shock
Catatonic coma â a warm, worm harvester
Lucid larvae share in the emptiness of your dreamsâ¦
(Infected with billions of eggsâ¦)
Feel them grow and twitch â incubated cyst
Bubbling blisters leak â âI thought I heard one speakâ¦â
Swarmed from head to toe â milky overflow
Pockmarked human husk â a bitter, bleachy musk
Just before you finally fade away into the relief of death
Feel them hatch and squirm
Healthy, strong - you've kept them warm...
(Digging from underneath the skin
Translucent teeth resemble tiny fins
Shredding all thatâs left from within
âIncubation of a million pins.â)
