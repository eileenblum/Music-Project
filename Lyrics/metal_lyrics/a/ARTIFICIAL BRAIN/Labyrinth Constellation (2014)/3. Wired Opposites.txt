[Chorus:]
Antique satellite solitude
Cyborg sentient molecules
After it purges its bowels into the night sky
Itâs free of light, free of programmed cognizance
Free from wired opposites, free to implode on itself into afterlife
Unchained from spiteâ¦

The flea that sucks at the udder, chittering through centuriesâ¦
The gravity that drains all gutters, the chattering laughter of silent spaceâ¦

[Chorus]

The swirling gaseous halo, leaving embers of entire systemsâ¦
The rat that ate its own tail until it became Godâ¦

[2x]
As Iâm blinking, witness visions, witness suns
Witness the words of planets with tongues

Into blackness, into nothing
Limitless potentialâ¦
Abysmal night sky!
Gorged on the ghosts of dead stars!
Scarred by rotting light â one day, when days are no more, youâll be pureâ¦
