Echoes of rage skid across linear timeâ¦
Legacy of hearts wound chills spine
Shrieking, shadowed sound silhouette
Body long gone but not silenced yet
Intense sensation of soulâs memory projected through centuries
âDoomed in repetition â a listless photograph of a dead manâs ambition
Blurry essence of eternal imprint 
Not in space, but in time, distant
Reflections of every worst moment
Play out never reaching atonementâ
Lives played out now cast into forgotten silence 
Leaving only lingering sorrows born of violence
(Legacy of hearts wound chills spine
Shrieking, shadowed sound silhouette
Body long gone but not silenced yet
Intense sensation of soulâs memory projected through centuriesâ¦)
