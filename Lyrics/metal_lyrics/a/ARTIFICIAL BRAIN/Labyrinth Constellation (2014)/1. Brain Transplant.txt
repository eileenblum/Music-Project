Cells scattered in electronic ghosts of pulse
Dreams of futile fleshâ¦

[Chorus:]
Hindsightâs remembrance of members and bowels
Heroes of hopes broken, throw in the towelâ¦

Wisdom and crafts of the pioneers â never lose them in these cold years

[Chorus]

Broken, dreamless in frozen worship
Into the necrosphere, beyond the world of waking men
Where horror and moral terror are your friends
