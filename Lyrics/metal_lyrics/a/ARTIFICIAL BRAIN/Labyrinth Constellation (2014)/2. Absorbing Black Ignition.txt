Gemini â twin of two extremes
Symmetry â polarized at the seam
The side of dirt â an animal ignited
The side of the vacuum â existing in psychic
âFlesh is just mud, until tempered with fire
Heaving balance, a dimension of fibersâ
Summoning energy, twins of darkness and light
Grey equation, charged with blackness beyond nights
âSoil, water, light â temples of the flesh which channel  seas of urge.â
Gemini â twin of two extremes
Symmetry â polarized at the seam
âFlesh is just mud, until tempered with fire
Heaving balance, a dimension of fibersâ
