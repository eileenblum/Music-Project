A vastly rooted world tree which absorbs knowledge from air and disperses it to the bowels
Through the clay, to the core of its anchor
âA planet which walks in a swarm of suspended moons
It burns itself upon the sun to build immunity to radiation.
It gorges itself on poisonous light and colon spasms its roots unto the sediment.â
Poisonedâ¦ to the water and soil and organs
Machinery of constellations
âMud is the cradle of light into matter, scum and waste filtered in bladder.
Oh, Wooden Terra Satelliteâ
A vane planet, killing itself
Toxic anguish, globally felt
âA planet which walks in a swarm of suspended moons, it burns itself upon the sun to
Build immunity to radiation, it gorges itself on poisonous light.â
