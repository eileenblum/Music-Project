Sober again, the world takes a step back.
Trapped in her shell feeling used and abused, cast out and aside.
She cried and cried all night, hiding inside her mind.
As she felt that she could drown, the sky came crashing down.

Redemption's shadow
Redemption's shadow

The white coats came, with straight jacket pleasure.
Measure by measure they fed her the way of the sane.
Like a bird caught in the light, flying to the end of the earth.
Take her hand, she'll finally have a place to stand.

This storm is tearing limb from limb, chance of survival growing
Slim.
They hope the gods are on her side, but inside her soul has died.

Firing into the flames, as i coast towards the sea, there's nothing
You can do to me.

They let her go, they cannot try to stop her. don't meet her stare,
It's like a twisted dark nightmare.

Take a step back.
Take a step back from the world. 

(i can find) answers to my dreams.
(i can find) an end to my screams.
(i can find) that there's nowhere left
To run but to the water.

This lurid night i found out what it
Means to be alive inside her.

This storm is tearing limb from limb, chance of survival growing
Slim.
They hope the gods are on her side, but inside her soul has died.

Redemption's shadow.

This storm is tearing limb from limb, chance of survival growing
Slim.
They hope the gods are on her side, but inside her soul has died.
