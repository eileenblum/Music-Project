Life isn't all there is.
There must be more than this.
We have to know, what is the meaning of our time on earth?
We have to know, what it is that drives us, what are we
Worth?
Looking back our lives have slowed to a crawl,
We've gotta live life outside of these walls.
With every action, every comment you make,
You must choose to be loyal or choose to be paid.

This time you have gone too far,
Watch the embers start to scar.
Nothing's real, i can't feel you there,
And you know you're going nowhere.

Feel salvation rising in, in your soul.
Feel elation wash away it all.

We'll never know what is inside us,
It still remains to be solved.
And so we strive not to feel confined.

Feel salvation rising in, in your soul.
Feel elation wash away your past.
Wash away

Feel salvation rising in, in your soul.
Feel elation wash away it all.

Rising tides bring forth new life.
Finding darkness in the light.

Lifted up into the sun.
After all this time we've won.

Still cannot find your home.

Start anew and you can,
Find your way to the open door.

Falling seas reveal your home,
And you know your time has come,
The deal is done.

Look to me, you will see,
What you must be to,

Feel salvation rising in, in your soul.
Feel elation wash away your past.
Feel salvation make you feel, make you feel so whole.
Feel elation cleanse your mind at last.
