The sun sinks low within the sapphire sky.
The shroud is torn away, i know the reason why.
Sitting alone bathed in the sunset's glow,
I know exactly why i'm here and why i must go.

The marbled ash begins to flake and soar,
Far away to a distant shore.
The fire's light reflected in these eyes.
Brings the hope of a new horizon, distant skies.

I will find you soon, we'll soar together, you and i.
You're setting my horizons ablaze.

I will find you soon, we'll soar together, you and i.
You're setting my horizons ablaze.

A search that has thrown him far from home.
Lie strides forward to face another day.

The velvet night is scattered thick with stars.
No chance of turning back too late too far.
The embers of the life he lead turn grey,
As he ventures east to find another day.

One day my wandering will cease.
Together we'll fly the crystal skies.

Let these feelings guide you now.
And i know you can still win.
My heart has shown you how,
As our new life now begins.
