I sit and wonder, is there anybody out there?
Out in the light? i am watching from the darkness.
Far from the forest, from the centre of the world.
I can feel their light, burning bright.
Every night.

Who makes a difference in your life? what separates
You from peace or strife?
What do you do when it all falls down? do you run
Like the wind, or do you sink fast and drown?

There's no one here, there is no one to blame.
Nothing to do but play the waiting game.
Say what you want, just don't ask why.
Have you given up hope, or do you think that you still
Might fly?

You're not alone in the black of the night, far from the
Others who feel safe in the light.
Nothing left but to fall asleep.
