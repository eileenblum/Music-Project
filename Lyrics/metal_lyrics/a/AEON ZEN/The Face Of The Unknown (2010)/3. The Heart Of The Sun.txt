Is this the end? there's a light that's shining,
It's showing me the way.
Reality, i can feel it's fire, it's burning in my veins.

Feel the heart of the sun beating inside your chest.
Like a river of healing, helping you know what's best.
The heart of the sun, showing you what is left.
It's just like yesterday, so what next?

Songs of hope heard in your head.
All your thoughts turning to red.

Thoughts of all you've lost carry on through to every-
Thing it's cost you.
What you are, what you wanted to be, is now colliding
Into me.
It's like you never saw or never cared for the passion in
My eyes.
Turn away, fade to grey, and now the hunter has become
The prey.

Feel the heart of the sun beating inside your chest.
Like a river of healing, helping you know what's best.
The heart of the sun, showing you what is left.
It's just like yesterday, so what next?

Feel the heart of the sun beating inside your chest.
Like a river of healing, helping you know what's best.
The heart of the sun, showing you what is left.
It's just like yesterday, so what next?

Try to reach your endless light.

Feel the heart of the sun beating inside your chest.
Inside your chest.

Feel salvation rising in, in your soul.
Feel elation wash away it all.
