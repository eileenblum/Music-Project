She tries and tries to reach the land of no tomorrow,
But journeys on to see nothing in this darkness.
She must try and find the light.

Time will go on, as the world keeps turning.
You're standing still but your eves see visions.

She cannot help but think there's nothing left inside her.
And though she wants to sing, the song in her is gone.
She's seeing nothing inside her head.
There's nothing here now, nothing anymore.

Time will go on, as the world keeps turning.
You're standing still but your eves see visions.

In your mind

Look to the skies, you will find peace of mind in her eyes.
She's blind, unseeing visions intertwined.

Time will go on, as the world keeps turning.
You're standing still but your eves see visions

Time will go on, as the world keeps turning.
You're standing still but your eves see visions
