Found dead, lying face down in the snow. mankind's
Been dealt another fatal blow.
All the traffic stops to a standstill but no one will make
A move, they've got a point to prove.
To make their way, they show their poison off and
Have a laugh, they're so far astray.

Lost in your imaginary world, no one or nothing else
Can be heard.
Feel the real world outside under your feet, beside your
Mind, what else is there left to find?
To break us free, out of this tragedy and mystery, from
These ties that bind.

Show me innocent feelings, how can you be sure if
They're real? 
This is our story, we hold the key to unlock this
Mystery.

This velvet night the stars align,

Try to draw their hidden meaning.

Show me innocent feelings, how can you be sure if
They're real? 
This is our story, we hold the key to unlock this
Mystery.

And now they're open, will you look through my eyes
Finally broken, drowning out the lies.
Reaching our last frontiers and i can see for ears.
What we could never be has been left far behind me.
I now own the key, and finally i can see
I need the sunlight, come to set me free.

Spinning through elastic dreams empty bodies left
Lying on the ground
Left in this
Drowning, left out on my own
