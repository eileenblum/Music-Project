A boy stood before us years ago and saw faces in the
Ocean.
Picture yourself within the picture, when the sea rose
Up to meet him.
The trees are calling him, you can almost hear their
Bark, as the face in the water smiles and towers above.
You feel the strength built up through the ages, and
You can tell by its weight, it's been waiting too long.

I can't find, all the pieces that lay here broken from
My mind.
I'm facing the face of the unknown. i can't know.

You search for truth in the flood, drops falling from the
Sky bringing peace through tears.
What you see in his eyes, it makes you forever know
That he is not alone.

I can't find, all the pieces that lay here broken from
My mind.
I'm facing the face of the unknown. i can't know.

I can't find, all the pieces that lay here broken from
My mind.
I'm facing the face of the unknown. i can't know.
