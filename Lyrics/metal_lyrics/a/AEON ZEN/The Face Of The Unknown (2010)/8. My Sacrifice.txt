Lost in the void of sense, we fall.
Try as you might, no one will hear our call.
You push, and you pushed me too far.
But now, falling down from our star.

Wait to reach the end and there's nothing we can do.
You make your chances few.

Become undone, on the edge of the world, with the
Sunlight as my guide.
Here and now, you must have something to give.
Into the end, we are rapidly hurled, at least i can say
I tried.
Trust yourself and you will know how to live.

Your eyes make me sacrifice all that i've earned.
What have i learned?

Become undone, on the edge of the world, with the
Sunlight as my guide.
Here and now, you must have something to give.
Into the end, we are rapidly hurled, at least i can say
I tried.
Trust yourself and you will know how to live.

As we stand on the edge of the world.
On the edge of the world.
