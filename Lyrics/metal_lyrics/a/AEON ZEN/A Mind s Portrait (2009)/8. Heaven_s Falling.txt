Look and see the sky's dark horizon,
time to run from this past foregone.
Shadows crawl over the ground,
light fading from the sky's last moments of life.

Try and find the peace within this tempest
as all time now fades away.
Now let the full force consume the beauty
without knowing the full effect.
Silence screams at the sky, yet there's no reply.
Growing sense of dismay from the light of day.

Cynics run over the sky,
try and hide from the heavens falling.
Shadows crawl over the ground,
light fading from the sky's last moments.

In the centre of this mind
we will see the world defined.
Draw the cold white silent earth in your eyes.

Hope may try, under lies.
Burn the sky in your eyes.

Cynics run over the sky,
try and hide from the heavens falling.
Shadows crawl over the ground,
light fading from the sky's last moments.

Look and see the sky's calm horizon,
time is now on your side.
