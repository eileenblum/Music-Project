Return to me.

Life goes on and the light will break the night.
This burden grows, but your mind is clear
to rise above the fear.

It isn't simple, as you cannot see the pain inside of me.
What I've done to deserve this?
Follow me to my darkest dreams.
Misery loves my company.

This is the aftermath, the echo of all hope that's lost.
The dream is caught, but the soul remains still lost inside myâ¦

Thoughts of you enter the back of my mind.
They force me to think of when
you broke your vows, unsaid until now,
forcing me into jealousy.
You're mine; always you're mine, for all of time.

This is the aftermath, the echo of all hope that's lost.
The dream is caught, but the soul remains
still lost inside my mind.

I will never forget you,
but you'll never know as death cheats love.

Time marches on, hope's echo's lost forever more.
I thought that I would find my peace inside of you,
but now I walk on my own.

This is the aftermath, the echo of all hope that's lost.
The dream is caught, but the soul remains still lost.
This is the aftermath, the echo of all hope that's lost.
Now hear my final call, for now and evermore.
