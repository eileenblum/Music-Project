Tomorrow brings the promise of existence
as the choices we need never end.
There's no reason, there's no end in sight,
there's no peaceful destruction within.
All through life you're falling off the edge of dreams,
into the centre of your soul.

All you've learned and all you hide,
it is what you are inside.
All your lies and all you try
cannot save yourself from time.

Deep inside, forever lost,
the chains hold it in place.
As the rivers flow, into the seas,
they wash away my soul.
Hold it in place, seasons change;
they pass away, as they can never stay.

Hear now, the silent call to end it all,
the rage burns my mind games,
consumed by flames, left behind, you find:

All you've learned and all you hide,
it is what you are inside.
All your lies and all you try
cannot save yourself from time.

All you've learned and all you hide,
it is what you are inside.
All your lies and all you try
cannot save yourself from time.

All you have and all you hide,
it is what you are inside.
All the truth will help you find
is that you've been left behind.
