Streets lined with stories, entwined words flow,
flash, grow and fade away.
Lives run on rails, crawling lights show,
flash, grow and fade away.

Streets in amber glow
Streets in amber glow
Streets in amber glow.

They stare in wonder, blinded rain slows,
slips, pools and flows away.
Rust clings born broken, twisted cracks grow,
split, fray and wear away, wear away.

Dark shadows whisper, sights seen fall,
rise, combine then sink below.
Time fades inwards, coiled leaves still flow,
flash, fade and grow away.

Streets in amber glow
Streets in amber glow.

Streets in amber glow
Streets in amber glow.

Days last glow slipping away
and leaving the world in shade.
Shade.
