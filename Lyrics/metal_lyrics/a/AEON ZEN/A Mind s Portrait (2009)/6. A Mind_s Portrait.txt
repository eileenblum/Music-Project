Moments, seconds, hours waste away.
Washed out, world so bright,
burning in your hands tonight.

Piece by piece, fight to cease,
shining brightly though the haze.
Softly tread through your head,
all the things your mind portrays.
This time, this time.

When time came, to wash all away who tried?
All our lives have brought this fight to survive.

Skies grow bleak, in too deep,
chilling echoes never ending.
Time's intent, bring this lament,
meet you at the circle's end.
To find, to find.

When time came, to wash all away who tried?
All our lives have brought this fight to survive.

Now there's no one, nothing,
bring the circle's end.
