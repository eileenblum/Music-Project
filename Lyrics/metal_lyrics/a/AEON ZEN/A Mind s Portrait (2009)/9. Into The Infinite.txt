Here lies the truth.

You hereby agree to review the cost
for your possible future that's lost.
Continue through the void.
(Justify) your judgement, your actions,
the choices you've made.
(Testify) to what you've become.
(Confess) all of your sins to me.

Here lies the truth, shown through you, torn in two.
Join me, you'll see how we agree, so now tell me:
do you try to break through to nothing?

After the storm dies down,
it's clear to see the answers.
No longer disguised from view,
take back what's said to you.

Here lies the truth shown through you.
You'll be set free, let go from me.
You will submit into the infinite.
