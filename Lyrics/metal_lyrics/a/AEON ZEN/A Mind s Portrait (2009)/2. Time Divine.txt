Left behind in another life,
light has brought the truth back from the shadows.
No time to waste while the whispers swell,
as the past and the present realign.
Moments fade into one last breath.
Shown the truth of:

Time divine, from gilded eyes,
see the power of the hands of time.
Does hope and faith give meaning
to the actions of one man?

From the edge of thought a call came forth,
as the shadows of the past come back to haunt.
Yet the paradox conforms all life,
as the past and the future fade away.
Shown the light of:

Time divine, from gilded eyes,
see the power of the hands of time.
Does hope and faith give meaning
to the actions of one man?

There are others like you, you are not alone.
In your darkest hour, even gods can die.

Watch as the generations rip apart.
(See) the masters' hand at work, the paradox is now complete now.
(Fight) if you want to live, realise the truth within theâ¦
(Light), out of sight, out of mind, out of time.

Time divine, from gilded eyes,
see the power of the hands of time.
Does hope and faith give meaning
to the actions of one man?

With the balance restored, now I am alone.
In my darkest hour, even gods will fail.
