Sleep, fading away, leaving only her.
Thoughts running away so fast, she's alone.
And nobody hears as she walks down the stairs,
leaving everything behind her.
Take care when your heart lets go of you.

Moments fade, her eyes return to grey
as she sees his face in front of her thoughts.

Time fading away, leaving only guilt.
If time was turned back, would he be the same?

Moments fade, her heart has turned to stone.
The truth, he'll never knowâ¦
