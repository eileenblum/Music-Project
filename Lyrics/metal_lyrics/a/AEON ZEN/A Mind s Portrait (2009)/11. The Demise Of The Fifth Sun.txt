Fire blooms in the mighty churning sky,
illuminates a thousand vacant eyes.
High above, a cry begins to sound.
Ashes fall from the black sky above.

Far away from here, under light of a crimson moon,
gods and men wage a war.
From the burning fields to the rivers flowing darkest red,
holy fire raining down.

Time runs in circles from the past,
seven death has reached us now at last.
Try to run, but the darkness will still come.
Owls sing death, calling out their song as one.

Running from the cities, from the ruins, to the killing ground. 
Holy fire, raining down.
Day is night, night is day, cinders fill the air.
Gods and men wage a war.

As their wings rise up to the heavens,
and their eyes burning in the night. 
As we run, running from the ending of all time,
and they ride into the light.

My heart will always be with you:
I love you, but fear I must go.
Heed the warning signs
as the tale starts to unfold,
part of the greatest story ever told.

Hear their broken screams as my wrath begins to fall. 
Will no one ever hear our cries as the deity stands tall?
Another victim diesâ¦

A storm begins to gather in the cavern,
awakening, the altar consumed with fire.
Strange chanting fills the air with cold,
the ancient rites invoked,
summon the beast of old.

Rising up from the darkness, feeling power start to grow.
Breaking chains that confined me as the blood begins to flow.
Soldiers pause in their bitter struggle, all eyes turn towards the sky.
As it burns above, the fire starts to die.

Raining fire, blood and thunder, leaving ashes in its wake:
all that's left now is darkness, as the earth begins to shake.
Come to set all the world on fire, ending this destructive trend.
The gods of war, fate and fire bringing flames of the end.

Life is a constant quest for reason.
(Feeling power start to grow) 
Death is the final chance of redemption. 
(As the blood begins to flow)

Worlds collide, realise the prophecy, 
only time to feel the pain as the whole world dies.
(The demise of the fifth sun)
There's no hope of redemption.

As their wings rise up to the heavens,
and their eyes, burning in the night.
As we run, running from the ending of all time,
and they ride into the light.

Into the light.

Far away from here under light of a crimson moon,
gods and men wage a war.
From the burning fields to the rivers flowing darkest red.
Holy fire, raining down.

Running from the cities, from the ruins, to the killing ground.
Holy fire, raining down.
Day is night, night is day, cinders fill the air.
Gods and men wage a war.

As their wings rise up to the heavens,
and their eyes, burning in the night.
As we run, running from the ending of all time,
and they ride into the light.

As their wings rise up to the heavens,
and their eyes, burning in the night.
As we run, running from the ending of all time,
and they ride into the light.

My heart will always be with you:
I love you, I shouldn't have gone.
Heed the warning signs,
now my tale can never be told,
This is the end - the world has now gone coldâ¦
