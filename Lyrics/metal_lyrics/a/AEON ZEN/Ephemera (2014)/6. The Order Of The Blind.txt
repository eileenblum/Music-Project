I am one soul
Lost in their world

Come on through
We'll fix you

Hold him down
His time is up
No more lies
Fall into the order of the blind

Blackened and bored
Ooh, see what's in store
Those pearly gates ain't gonna wait
No, they ain't gonna wait for you

I have transcended and know what was missing
I have a way to show you who to follow
Join me and learn about yourself without fear of what consequences might lie ahead
