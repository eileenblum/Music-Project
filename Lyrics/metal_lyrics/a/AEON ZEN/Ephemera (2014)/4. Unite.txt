Rise up,
Against the machines.
Rise up,
We can't let them win.
Rise up,
Stand, unite, fight.
Rise up,
And don't lose sight.

Are you with me,
And humanity?
Will you join us in what is right?
Or against me,
My enemy?
Then you'll see my might.

You cannot win.
Join us.
Your soul is ours.

We tried not to blindly follow,
But just don't know what we're supposed to know.
We don't know.

We must unite.
Together we are stronger than anything.
So raise your hands.

Alone, but how long will it last?
Trust me, you must remember the past.
Your families;
Your feelings;
Your journeys,
All for nothing?

Are you with me,
And humanity?
Will you join us in what is right?
Or against me,
My enemy?
Then you'll see my might.

We must unite.
Together we are stronger than anything.
So raise your hands.

We must stay and unite.
