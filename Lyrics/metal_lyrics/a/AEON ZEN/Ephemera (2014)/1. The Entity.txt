Alone, but how long will it last,
With no memory of their past?

A soul trapped in a new world,
Rebuilt from where it went wrong.
Mechanised, dehumanised,
Thatâs the way our world will become strong.

We can find answers in our subconscious minds,
No one knows what there was or when.
How canât this be intelligent design?
Can we still call ourselves human?

Alive or dreaming?
A new awakening.
Machines surround me.
Drifting through air that is no more,
Can I win this war?

I knew what it had meant to be alive,
Before this mechanical world appeared before our eyes.

A soul trapped in a new world,
Living through wires and metal.
Mechanised, dehumanised,
Thatâs the way our race will reach a new level.

We can find answers in our subconscious minds,
No one knows what there or when.
How canât this be intelligent design?
Can we still call ourselves human?

We can find answers in our subconscious minds.
How can we really be so blind? Open your eyes.
