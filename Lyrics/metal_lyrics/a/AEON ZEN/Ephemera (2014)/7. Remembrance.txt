Sold my soul for remembrance
Take the life
Burn a hole in this lifetime and twist the knife
You are what you're labeled
Take the life
So break from your memory
Remembrance

If you look inside your heart, would you go back to the start?
When you think of how this all fell apart
Take a trip inside my mind
Let us show all mankind
This is clarity defined
We are not their kind

Show them how we hold our own
Show them that you're not a clone
Show them what you've always known
You are not alone
All those times you tried to change
All those times had come too late
Now the time has come to let this reality unfold

And now, you're the essence of my past
Return
And now, we will see who ends up last
Return

We're all praying for life
I'm the life inside you
