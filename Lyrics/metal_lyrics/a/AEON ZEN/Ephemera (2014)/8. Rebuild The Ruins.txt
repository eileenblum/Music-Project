Now we know what you've become
Don't try, the end is near
We're left to rebuild from the ruins
Don't try, the end is near
Now we know what you've become
Don't try, the end is near
It's time to break free
Don't try, the end is near

If you look, you'll find a way to see what you should say before it's gone
If you look, you'll find a way to see what you should say
It's nothing

But all you say that's in the way of moving forward with the life that you had built for those behind
And now I hope you find a way to carry on without the struggle that is raging in your mind

Hold my hand
I'll take you places you could never go
I want you to hold my hand
You'll wish you never trusted me before

Rise up and strike at the world
and it all will be clear
