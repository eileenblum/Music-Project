Lighting up the cigarette and getting out of bed
We all thought it would always be this way
No longer living for today
All that we have has been taken away

You know he tried to absolve?
Why should he live and die alone?

It isn't where you come from
It's where you go to live your life
It isn't where you come from
It's where you go to die

We used to have it all
What is a life anymore?
What does it mean and have?
Eyes won't turn alive again

It is too late
You cannot start again

I am one
We are one

It's not too late
We have to start again
We must escape
