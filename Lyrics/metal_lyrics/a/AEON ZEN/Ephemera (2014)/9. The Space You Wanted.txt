Rising higher to a different plane
With words unspoken through the pain
Face your dreams and all your hopes and build the place you wanted

We have found the waterfall
Flowing through our conscious minds and we are brought to life

It's not what's real, it's how you play the game
This time we'll learn from all of our shame
We have another chance at life, so make the space you wanted

I gave you freedom to decide
Another reason to look inside

We are brought to life
