I see my reflection locked in this cage of truth.
Iâm changing my years to find a way to yesterday.
I canât fall away.

Iâm staring into the abyss.
Donât know what Iâve missed, but now I found you.
And I was searching endlessly for a chance to be,
To be there beside you.

Watch him fade away, along with dreams of you.
Watch them fade away, inside my dreams of yesterday.
I canât fall away.

[Chorus (Atle)]

I must try to find out whatâs on your mind.
Are you looking to realign?
Thereâs no way you can make it last.
What can you do? The time has passed.

Looking up to the pale faced moon,
Pale faced moon,
Now I know what I must do.
Thereâs a way I can get it done.
Experiments that I will fund.

These are the times youâve lied,
To be the beast inside,
Your consciousness allows no other to be found.
This is ending of your worthless days,
And nights have gone astray,
To end your suffering.

[Guitar solo (Rich)]

Bend your thoughts, release your mind,
To find, how did we rise,
From nothing in our eyes,
To witness our demise?
So here we go, into eternal snow,
Youâll set the world aglow,
And strike the final blow.

Eternal snow.
