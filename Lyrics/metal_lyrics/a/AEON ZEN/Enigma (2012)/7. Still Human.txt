What you wanted, what you needed, taken all away.
Now we know why heâs alone, canât come out to play.
Getting closer, take it in, fight your chemistry.
Primal urge that he must purge, face his enemies.

Enigma, lost inside his mind.
Try to accept what he knows heâll find.
Enigma, lost inside his mind.
Learning to trust what heâll find.

Youâre a creature, lost in this world,
Looking down to find your home.
Drown in sorrow, filled with regret,
Drops like diamonds on your chest.

Left to die out in the cold,
Your demons will not warm your soul.

Return to me.

Left to die out in the cold,
All that you own, your soul is sold.
Drown in sorrow, lake of tears,
You cannot turn back the years.

All rising and falling from the ashes,
This world is nothing but a canvas for all our aspirations.
Rising and falling from the ashes,
This world is nothing but a canvas for us all.

Rising, falling, lying, bleeding, cheating, stealing, I am,
Rising, falling, lying, bleeding, cheating, stealing, I am human.
