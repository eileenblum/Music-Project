Leading the blind into battle,
Losing their heads like cattle.
Throw all your cash in the pile,
âCause we could be here for a while.

This test shows another way to makes us stronger,
A better answer than what nature can offer.
The raw energy that we have now acquired,
Will now allow us to power the collider.

This is going to be the end of us.
Run for cover, all of your prayers are now worthless.

The rain running down, his face is mixed with anger
The fabric of time and space is left to shatter.
Merging the blood and sweat, he's left in tears,
It's blinding his eyes, exposing his fears.

When eyes turn blind and the summers jade and the winters fade away,
From this mistake.
Our ice age calls, what will we do?
Relive your memories of what should be.

And you will find that there's no hope left any more,
Falling from the sky,
So say goodbye.

This black hole's growing, surrounding.
The universe is igniting.
Our future's finally certain,
As we draw the final curtain.

This is going to be the end of us.
Run for cover, all of your prayers are now worthless.

What have you done? Our whole world is now expiring.
Our universe is no more, when there is nothing.
We released our demons on this mortal stone.
And now we share this eternal home.
