Summer eyes thrill me,
Iâm in denial, still.
I have never seen the hills beyond the wall.

Patience plays the mistress and I like it.
Habits linger but I long to be there.

Do you remember when I said I tried?
Reaching out, why should i?
When thereâs no more need to.

Patience plays the mistress and I like it.
Habits linger but I long to be there.

Hold on, please wait, am I too late?
Seven hills, I have longed to see.
Will you ever concede?

[Sax solo (Rich)]

Hold on, please wait, am I too late?
Seven hills, now youâre here with me,
We can finally be.
