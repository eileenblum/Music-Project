Moments turn, and I have know your kind. Youâre not kind.
But I have warned you and I have told you why.
Into the earth, youâre falling to the fire, you liar.
But I have warned you and I have told you why. I told you.

Now he found all he was looking for.

A man with everything he ever wanted (everything he wants)
He has nothing now, heâs nothing when youâre gone.
He thinks heâs happy and content with his life (happy with his life)
But cannot really understand what he has done.

Money talks but people walk away, betrayed.
But I warned you and I have told you why.
Thereâs time to change, or god knows whatâs in store? No more.
But I have warned you and I have told you why. I told you.
Now he found all he was looking for.

[Chorus (Andi)]
