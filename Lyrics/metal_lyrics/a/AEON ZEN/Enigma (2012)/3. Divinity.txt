Shatter the lies,
Thereâs no reflection in your blood red eyes.
Within his mind you try to find darkness growing inside.

Moments turning, slowly learning,
On this journey of self-discovery.

Twisting, heâs turning, and pounding through your skull.
Sucking all the life right out of you.

You wonât find any peace inside.
Thereâs no chance of divinity.
Divinity.
Stare inside his soul. You will find thereâs nothing there.
Thereâs no chance of divinity.
Divinity.

Moments turning, slowly learning.
On this journey of self discovery.

[Chorus (Jonny &amp; Andi)]

You wonât find any peace inside.
Who will be lifted to the sky&amp;
Divinity.
Stare inside his soul, you will find thereâs nothing there.
When they canât find the will to try.
Divinity.

Will this be his blessed day?
