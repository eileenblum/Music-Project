Return to me.
Return to me.

You will find hope,
Falling from the chandelier,
So insincere.

Echoes sounding in the hall,
Reflecting off the glass.
He wills his house a home,
But everything he touches turns to ash.

Heâs got no life, heâs got no skills,
Just a ton of cash and a handful of pills,
His thoughts gone in a flash,
And everything he touches turns to ash.

[Guitar solo (Rich)]

[Chorus (Atle)]

[Chorus (Nate)]

You will find hope,
Falling from the sky, falling from the sky,
So you say goodbye.
