Alone, blankly staring into space,
An empty look upon his face,
With nothing on his mind.
Today, nothing left for him to see,
A burnt out shell of what of should be,
He might as well have died.

Born of silence,
Where thereâs no love
Where thereâs beauty inside but will wither away.
Tears created,
By all heâs known,
And he questions how he ended up this way.

As a child I was raised not to care âbout anyone else,
And it left me on my own.
Kicking and screaming I run from nothing.
I am learning to be, from what youâve taught me.

Drawn expressions,
Show how to not care,
Glaring down at the blank page in front of his eyes.
His own words,
Are symbols in stone,
Showing nothing, he cannot look up to the sky.

I lost all my dreams, they left be behind.
The seed has been planted and will die inside of us.
In losing the fight Iâm giving you nothing.
I am learning to be, from what youâve taught me.

Enigma, lost inside his mind,
With nowhere to hide until heâs back on track.
Enigma, rendered blind,
He is all alone until he learns to win them back.

[Guitar solo: Rich]

Here forever,
Time running away,
Life dissolving and fading to nothingness.
Dusk âtil morning,
Not moving at all,
Barely breathing, he could hardly be any less.
All heâs wanted,
To be something more,
He canât break from the nightmare that is his head.
Trapped, unwilling,
Unwilling,
Artificial soul, lost in the life heâs led.

Looking for something inside to show me,
As daylight wakens I will finally be free.
Wisdom and truth are left to discover.
I can conquer my fear by rising higher.

[Chorus (Jonny)]

I can hope for a better way,
Leaving myself in the dust.
I canât be the one who toys with fate,
âcause how can I move forward when I donât
Know who to trust?

Rising and falling from the ashes,
This world is nothing but a canvas for all
Our aspirations.
Rising and falling from the ashes,
This world is nothing but a canvas
For us all.
