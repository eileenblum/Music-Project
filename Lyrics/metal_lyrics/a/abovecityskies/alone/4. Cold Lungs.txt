Finding light at the end of the tunnel.
Finding hope in pits of despair.
But I am blinded.
But I am not one to be found.

I am not one to be found.

There is nothing to find.
Just another broken home.
Just another lost child.
Just another lie told.

I walk these streets.
Broken, beaten all alone.
I walk these streets.
Broken, beaten all alone.
I am lost.
But I don't want to be found.

I'm lost and I don't want to be found.

Broken beaten.
All alone.
