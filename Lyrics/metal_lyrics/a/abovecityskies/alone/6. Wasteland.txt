[feat. Mark Merriman from Endworld]All I see is the worm of this world.
All I smell is the stench of your lies.
All I feel is the pull of your regret.
And the grip of all your hate.

Your greed knows no bounds, I will rise above it.

I feel the pull of regret.
I can see all you fear.
I can rise above this pain.
I am my own revenge.

You are the worm of this world.
You are the scum of the Earth.

Scum pull me down when I can succeed.
All will fall when I turn the sky red.

THIS IS MY WASTELAND
YOU WILL FALL TO MY KNEES
MY FOOT YOUR FACE
I'LL BREAK YOUR FUCKING TEETH

All I see is the worm of this world.
All I smell is the stench of your lies.
All I feel is the pull of your regret.
And the grip of all your hate.

This is a fucking wasteland.
EUGH.
