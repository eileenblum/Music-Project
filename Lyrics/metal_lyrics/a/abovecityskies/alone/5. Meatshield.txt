Nothing's left it's all a fucking lie.
To think gold would fucking rain from the sky.
I hope heaven is a better place, because I've ended this shit with haste.
Earth is never to be repeated again.
I'm a godless savage and you're not my friend.
Do you think you'd get away with this?
You're a piece of fucking shit.
And you won't be missed.

Your being is insignificant.
I will annihilate all you stand for.
With no remorse, with no regret.
With utter disregard for your life.
