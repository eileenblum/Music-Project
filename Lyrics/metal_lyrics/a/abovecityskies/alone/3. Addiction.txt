Inject the black into your veins.
Addiction, ignorance, all the same.
I have seen the monster you have become.
I have seen the path left behind.

Lying in the gutter with nothing left.
The gun's down your throat but you won't give in.
You'll hold onto it with all you've got.
You'll stand there alone.

Your face is against the curb.
Protecting all that's left.
Watch you inject the black into your veins.
Watch your life wash away.

The seed of greed flows through your veins.
