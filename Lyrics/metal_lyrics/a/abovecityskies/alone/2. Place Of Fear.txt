I was nothing.
I could not live another day, in this world, full of lies and greed.
Greed.

This world is doomed.

I canât believe youâre here again.
With nothing more then a shred of hope.
I will douse your hopes and dreams.
I will burn your life away.

This world I live in.
Is a stain in the universe.
This life that I led.
Is a hollow shell.

Place of fear.
