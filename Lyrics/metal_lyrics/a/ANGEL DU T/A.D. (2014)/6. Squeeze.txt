Squeeze and bleed
You pull the rug from under me
I can't eat, I can't sleep
Draining the tears from out of me

I have so much to live for baby
Please don't hex me with your love

I said "hello"
She says "hi"
Then she penetrates my body
When she reaches deep inside

I've got to go
She gets high
When I penetrate her body
I reach so deep inside
