You've got it inside you
You've got that poison

Feels like I'm going to lose my mind
It makes me scream, it makes me cry

I feel the sickness grow
From my head to toe
And in my lonely bones

I've got to find a way to get it out
It makes me scream, it makes me shout

Suck it out
I need you to suck it out of me
Time is running out
Poison is inside of me
