The penitent man, will not pass 
Anymore than the sinner will 
All shall perish 

All ye hear these words and weep 
There is no escape from the wrath of that final judgement 
All shall perish, in a self created Hell 
And no penance, can buy you a place in the Kingdom of Heaven 

The penitent man, will not pass 
Anymore than the sinner will 
There is no escape from the wrath of the final judgement 
All shall perish 
All shall perish
