No such thing as tomorrow 
When youâre doomed 

Kill the thought we all have some predetermined purpose 
Just a myth 
Tomorrow will bring change 
Stop justifying your existence 
It will lead you to despair 

Itâs difficult to comprehend 
This endless cycle 
Monotony 
Sleep and wake all in the same day, itâs all the same 
Free will has released us 
Yet left us lost 

As I look, upon the evening sky 
And bathe in the stillness of its orange light 
I realize the insignificance of us 
There is only now 

The sun still will rise 
In despite, of those who fail to rise 

We all who exist, 
Yearn for the lives of which we imagine 
Always seeking, makes a mockery of life 

The arrogance of hope 
Only retains our dignity 
As it has been for a thousand years 
So it will remain 

As I look upon the evening sky 
And bathe in the stillness of the orange light 
I realize the insignificance of us 
There is only now 

The sun still will rise 
In despite of those who fail to rise with it 

Let it go 
Cause once itâs laid to waste 
Itâs gone forever because, thereâs 
No such thing as tomorrow 
When youâre doomed, when youâre doomed 
Thereâs no such thing as tomorrow 
When youâre doomed 
No such thing as tomorrow 
When youâre doomed 
No such thing
