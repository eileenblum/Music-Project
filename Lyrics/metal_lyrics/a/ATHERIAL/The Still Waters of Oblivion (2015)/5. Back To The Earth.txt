Today I sensed the demise of a man 
I smelt death in an unexpected way 
The sweet warm earth 
Like a grave 
In a polite exchange 
We went our separate ways 

Back to the earth 
From which we are all made 
We will go again 
And all we ever hoped to be 
Will blow away, with our bones forgotten 

I will carry this burden of impending death 
Alone in silence 

I smelt the death of a man again 
It was not the same 
The pungent stench of an institution overcame my senses 
He knew I could tell 
He was going 

Back to the earth 
From which we are all made 
We will go again 
And all we ever hoped to be 
Will blow away, with our bones forgotten 

I will carry this burden of impending death 
Alone in silence 

Were these meetings by chance? 
I think not 
I was not mistaken 
I struggle at the thought of what next awaits 

I know the secret 
The mind hides but the body betrays 
I know the secret 
I smelt the death of a man 

Back to the earth 
From which we are all made 
We will go again 
And all we ever hoped to be 
Will blow away 
With our bones forgotten 

I will carry this burden of impending death 
Alone in silence 

I smelt the death of a man
