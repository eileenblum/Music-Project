It looks out from the inside 
Takes my life for its own life 
Plays on my insecurities 
Makes me rage 
Leaves my mind in a dark place 
Makes me hate my existence 
Death is alive 
Death is alive 

It wants me to fail, 
It wants me to fucking die 
It laughs in the face 

Scars my flesh with its own mark 
Hear the words through the television 
Thereâs no relief 
Thereâs no rest 
Lost my hold on reality 
Thereâs no hope 
Fear and despair surround me 

It wants me to fail 
It wants me to fucking die 
It laughs in the face of god 
It wants me to be the same 

The body of Christ compels you out 
So kill me or leave me now 
I canât stay in the shadow anymore 
Get the fuck out 

Thereâs no face on the scarecrow 
How the fuck does it watch me 
You cant fix this with medication 
It is poisoning me 
Poisoning me 
I am alone 
Yet not alone 

Kill the master 
Yet the master has become the slave 
It is death 
Death
