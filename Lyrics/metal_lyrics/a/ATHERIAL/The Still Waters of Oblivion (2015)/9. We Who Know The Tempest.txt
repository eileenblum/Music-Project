I awaken, disorientated, racing pulse 
What was it, I was supposed to remember? 
I canât recall the words 
Only the pale horse and its pale rider, with its outstretched hands, reaching for me 

The storm approaches 
The air hangs heavier, than a dead man at the end of his rope. 
The incessant dread that is felt by all and seen by none 
Abandoned prayers, swallowed by a rising tide, the unfaithful flee to safety 
But there is no longer a safe place left, to go. 

We who know the tempest grow tired of the calm 
Follow me and descend into chaos 
Follow me to witness the downfall of man 
The wicked heart is repaid in death and the blood that courses though those veins will be let 
To stain the ground. 

The storm approaches 
The air hangs heavier, than a dead man at the end of his rope. 
The incessant dread that is felt by all and seen by none 
Abandoned prayers, swallowed by a rising tide, the unfaithful flee to safety 
But there is no longer a safe place left, to go 

We who know the tempest grow tired of the calm 
Follow me and descend into chaos 
Follow me to witness the downfall of man 
The depraved will taste the malice theyâve inflicted 
And their blood will stain the ground 

The storm approaches 
The air hangs heavier, than a dead man at the end of his rope 
The incessant dread that is felt by all but seen by none 
Abandoned prayers, swallowed by a rising tide, the unfaithful flee to safety 
The unfaithful flee to safety 
But there is no safe place left toâ¦.
