One narrow beam of light is choked with dust 
I watch as they fall away to nothing 
Like the hours in my days 
Just like the hours in my days 

The echo of our voices has diminished 
The clock has stilled 
Sorrow 
For all I can see is the ugliness and cruelty in the world. 

Heart of my heart 
Soul of my soul 
You canât be 
One of the departed 
Forgive me 
I failed to keep you 

Where do you dwell? 
Where no living breath has been spent? 
Deliver me to this silent kingdom 

I wiped the dirt from your hands 
But they are still too pale 
They are still so cold 
The sadness of this lonely watcher 
Forever gazing 
At an endless night 
No star can pierce 

This one divide 
Just cant be bridged 

Heart of my heart 
Soul of my soul 
You canât be 
One of the departed 
Forgive me 
I failed to keep you 

Where do you dwell? 
Where no living breath has been spent? 
Deliver me to this silent kingdom 

Deliver me 
Deliver me 
Deliver me to this silent kingdom 

One narrow beam of light 
Is choked with dust 
I watch as they fall away to nothing 
To nothing 
Just like the hours in my days 
Just like the hours in my days 
In my days
