I will be at the shore 
Watching your ship embark to that distant land 
Until it disappears over the horizon 
You wont see me standing in the shadows 
But Iâll raise my hand and wave goodbye 

The time for regrets and worldly preoccupations has passed 
These burdens are of no consequence any more 
So throw them to the breeze forever 
Be free and Iâll think of you from time to time and smile 

Donât look at the faces of people left behind 
Theyâll only draw you back 
No words can help them 

When all of the hate in your heart subsides 
When the words of the few become the truth of the many 
And the taste of blood is only a memory 

Hold fast and keep going 
Struggle out of spite 
And grief will feast here no more. 

If only the brave or the foolish persist 
What is the choice? 
Do you pause, but for a moment, whilst passing through hell? 
No! 

I will be at the shore 
Watching your ship embark to that distant land 
Until it disappears over the horizon 
You wont see me standing in the shadows 
But Iâll raise my hand and wave goodbye 

The time for regrets and worldly preoccupations has passed 
These burdens are of no consequence any more 
So throw them to the breeze, forever 
Be free and ill think of you from time to time and smile 

The time for regrets and worldly preoccupation has past 
These burdens are of no consequence 
So throw them to the breeze 

When all of the hate in your heart subsides, 
When the words of the few become the truth of the many 
And the taste of blood is only a memory 

Hold fast and keep going 
Struggle out of spite 
And grief will feast here no more 

Keep going 
Those who have fallen before you will mark the way 
Though your heart is heavy 
The weight of failure is greater 
You will not find solace here 
Keep going 

And donât you pause 
If even just for a moment in Hell 
For you will surely remain
