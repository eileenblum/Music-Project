We are mortal like the Son on the cross 
No attainment of divine 
I am conscious of a fear I canât name 
Spreads like mist and grips my heart like iron 

I faced the sun, 
So Iâd miss the shadow behind me, 
Silence 
Still I forced myself to look in me 
Deny it all 
I wasnât ready to face 
Whatever the fuck I found 

Were not as pure as we hope we are 
Weâre all stained and struggling to contain 

We are mortal 
Like the son on the cross 
No attainment of divine 
I am conscious of a fear I canât name 
Spreads like mist and grips my heart like iron 

Betrayal of the soul 
Now thereâs nothing left to protect me 
Suffer, behind a face where evil and good look the same 
Iâm weak 
Is this my moment of fate, a war thatâs raging 

The horror 
The devastation that lies behind my skin 
God created this as well 

I own the power 
Born from truth and ill show you 
I own the power 
Born from truth and ill show you 

Were not as pure as we hope we are 
Were all stained and struggling to contain 

We are mortal like the son on the cross 
No attainment of divine 
I am conscious of a fear I canât name 
Spreads like mist and grips my heart like iron 

I have been given the mind of Christ as have we all 
Cling to the light 
Hold it precious 
For the three poisons will ruin and destroy you 
If you allow
