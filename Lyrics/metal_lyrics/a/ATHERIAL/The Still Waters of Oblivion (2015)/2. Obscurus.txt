The broken man is the most dangerous 
Keep your world of continual disappointments to yourself 
Donât scatter you shards here 
Donât scatter your shards 
Your failure is contagious 

Iâm not your beacon 
Donât flock to me 
Where will you go 
When this fire dies 

What time doesnât change death will 
The inevitable canât be avoided 
The comfortable existence that kills us smiling 

Like a moth to the flame 
They swarm and make me flicker 
It drains me 
Away on your ragged wings 

I find that I canât laugh with out screaming 
When I think about the mediocre vessels weâve become 
Because happiness is a thin veil 
That covers a decaying face below 
It will leave you ruined but wanting more 
In this Godforsaken life you lead 

Iâm not your beacon 
Donât flock to me 
Where will you go 
When this fire dies 

Like a moth to the flame 
They swarm and make me flicker 
It drains me 
Away on your ragged wings 

The broken man is the most dangerous 
Keep your world of continual disappointments to yourself 
Donât scatter you shards here 
Donât scatter your shards 
Your failure is contagious 

Where will you go 
When this fire dies
