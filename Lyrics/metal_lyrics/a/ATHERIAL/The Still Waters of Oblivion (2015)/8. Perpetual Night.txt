I too shall pass 

The only thing Iâm free from is freedom 
Bound to the flesh and its limitations 
A grand failure 
Filthy and useless 

Fine from the outside 
I win at every game except mine 
An ungratifying pursuit that kills me 

The road once held a million promises 
But not one of them meant for me 
Life has worn off and suicide provides no comfort 
I will feel the cold 

There will be no end to this perpetual night 
No candle can replace the sun 

I canât outrun the shadow of the setting sun 
With the weight of these sins on my shoulders 
Keep going 
Something worse is waiting for me in the dark 

I killed my own god 
I killed my own god 
I killed my own god and now I have nothing. 
No one now to take pity on my soul 

The road once held a million promises 
But not one of them meant for me 
Life has worn off and suicide provides no comfort 
I will feel the cold 

There will be no end to this perpetual night 
No candle can replace the sun 

And I suffer 
And I die more everyday 
In this body of fleeting light 
All too soon extinguished 

I canât outrun the shadow of the setting sun 
With the weight of these sins on my shoulders 
Keep going 
Something worse is waiting for me in the dark. 

Donât scream itâs right behind you 
Donât scream itâs right behind you 
Donât scream itâs right behind you 
Donât scream itâs here
