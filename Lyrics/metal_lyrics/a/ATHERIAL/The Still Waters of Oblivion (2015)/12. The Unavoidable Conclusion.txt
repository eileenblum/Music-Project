Goodbye 
Breathe my last breath 
Give it life 
So I can be with you for one last moment 
Sorry, that we will never meet again, my friend 

For our time was just a fragment 
In the wake of eternity 
Not to be repeated or remembered 
By anyone but us 
Donât try to follow because I wont be there 

Into the dark, I will journey, though I cannot ask the way 
The wretched dead sing no praises 
Nor do any that go into silence 

May my soul, be delivered from death 
My eyes from tears and my feet from falling 
My friend 
Pray for me, Iâm sorry to leave you in this world 

My grip is slipping 
My grip is slipping 
Who has come to collect my soul? 

Into the dark I will journey, though I cannot ask the way 
The wretched dead sing no praises, 
Nor do any that go into silence 

Through your suffering, 
You will grow 
And I will be your teacher 

Goodbye 
Breathe my last breath 
Give it life 
So I can be with you for one last moment 
Sorry, that we will never meet again, my friend 

For our time was just a speck, 
In the wake of eternity 
Now turn your face away 
I donât want you to see me slide 
Into the still waters of oblivion
