[D. Cardoen - Y. Cluckers]

Innocent victim of your fate
When blind devotion came you didn't choose to betray
Slow death begins to freeze your soul
Dying for your opinions, fuck no !
(You) didn't choose to die for one's foolish act
Scream your fear and pain 'till there's nobody left
Losing ground, just close your eyes
And pray not to live this again

Nothing can help you, you're not the first
And certainly not the last, it's violence first
You can't understand the hate
that drives those fools to commit a crime
You're certainly not the last ('cause) it's violence first

Sadistic perversion of the mind
Try to run, try to scream before it's too late
Fire and pain are the rules of the game
But where is the fame ?
Pools of blood, corpses strewn
Do you feel the knife that is piercing your back ?
Bury life without emotion
For you it's the end of the game

Nothing can help you, you're not the first
And certainly not the last, it's violence first
You can't understand the hate
that drives those fools to commit a crime
You're certainly not the last ('cause) it's violence first
