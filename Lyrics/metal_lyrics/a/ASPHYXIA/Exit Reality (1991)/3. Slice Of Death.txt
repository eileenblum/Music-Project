[D. Cardoen - Y. Cluckers]

I never thought that things of life would come this far you know
You cannot think about the future, gotta face it so
Chemical dependency becomes like slavery
Grim technology grows and it will bring you to your knees
We now live in a world made of corruption and greed
Where things are easy to obtain for those who do not need
Mankind is the only real menace in this world
I dare not look, I dare not hear this shriek of agony

Watch out for this slice of death
Oceans die and forests burn
Environment destroyed by neglect
Greenhouse gasses fill the air
Watch out for this slice of death
Toxic wastes destroyed by need
Environment destroyed by neglect
Slice of death

The flood of acid rain burns the forests that remain
'Till we can breathe no more, life is not only a game
Pollution rates from nowadays are shooting up so fast
So it will continue until nothing more can last
We share responsibility for all that we have done
But isn't it too late now to save mankind from mankind ?
Deadly mess of human corpses laying all around
(I) dare not look, I dare not hear this shriek of agony

Watch out for this slice of death
Oceans die and forests burn
Environment destroyed by neglect
Greenhouse gasses fill the air
Watch out for this slice of death
Toxic wastes destroyed by need
Environment destroyed by neglect
Slice of death

Fear, thus we will disrupt the world
Creating shortage all around us
So real, beginning of the end
Accounting for what happens all around us

I never thought that things of life would come this far you know
You cannot think about the future, gotta face it so
Chemical dependency becomes like slavery
Grim technology grows and it will bring you to your knees
We now live in a world made of corruption and greed
Where things are easy to obtain for those who do not need
Mankind is the only real menace in this world
I dare not look, I dare not hear this shriek of agony

Watch out for this slice of death
Oceans die and forests burn
Environment destroyed by neglect
Greenhouse gasses fill the air
Watch out for this slice of death
Toxic wastes destroyed by need
Environment destroyed by neglect
Slice of death
