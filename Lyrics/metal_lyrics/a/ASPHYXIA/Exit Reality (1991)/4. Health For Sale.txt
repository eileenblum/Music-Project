[D. Cardoen - Y. Cluckers]

Total isolation, how will they ever know ?
No other place to live, they can only face the show
Another victim dies as they watch their children grow
As long as life can last
(As) they can feel the wind burning them so fast
They know they will learn how to face reality

Some people fear the night and the mutants they created
Others are taken to where death becomes a toll
Children without arms, without eyes, without legs, but children
One day they're gonna pay
For they left scars that'll never fade away
The legacy of the bomb doesn't last forever

Who, who's to blame ?  There is no way
To know the truth, the words to say
I think there will be hell to pay
Somehow the day will come for them to pay
The only thing to do: pray
'Cause they'll put up your health for sale

Incurable sick they'll be
The illness will bring them on their knees
If you knew you're gonna die could you face reality ?
Sufficient to blow the earth
It's no use to mankind, it burns
Irradiation organization has a game to play

Who, who's to blame ?  There is no way
To know the truth, the words to say
I think there will be hell to pay
Somehow the day will come for them to pay
The only thing to do: pray
'Cause they'll put up your health for sale

Hell, this place is hell but it's never to be told
Place, this is your place 'cause it's all that you hold
Fear, you smell the fear as you're feeling the pain
Pain, you feel the pain but no way to explain

Total isolation, how will they ever know ?
No other place to live, they can only face the show
Another victim dies as they watch their children grow
Sufficient to blow the earth
It's no use to mankind, it burns
Irradiation organization has a game to play

Who, who's to blame ?  There is no way
To know the truth, the words to say
I think there will be hell to pay
Somehow the day will come for them to pay
The only thing to do: pray
'Cause they'll put up your health for sale
