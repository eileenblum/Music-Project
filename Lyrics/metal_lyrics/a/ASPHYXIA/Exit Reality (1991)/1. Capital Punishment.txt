[D. Cardoen - Y. Cluckers]

Evil and torture
Are things you can't ignore in these ages of distrust
The challenges to authority
Are things they can't admit and they'll drown them in the dust
Choose your fate
You didn't wanna die 'cause it's they who are to blame
Woe betide
Them whose anger caused the end of liberty for you

Dare to say you didn't wanna die
No way you'll never get away
So stay another day
Take a look to all that they have done
You see the lives they have destroyed
And then you lose control

Wreck the edge
But cross the line of death and there will be nothing left
Take the oath
That one day they'll perish for the crime they perpetrate
Violence and terror
Show them what you feel when you're sitting in the chair
Dart but glare
You must prepare yourself for the capital punishment

Dare to say you didn't wanna die
No way you'll never get away
So stay another day
Take a look to all that they have done
You see the lives they have destroyed
And then you lose control

Evil and torture 
Are things you can't ignore in these ages of distrust
The challenges to authority
Are things they can't admit and they'll drown them in the dust
Choose your fate
You didn't wanna die 'cause it's they who are to blame
Woe betide
Them whose anger caused the end of liberty for you

Dare to say you didn't wanna die
No way you'll never get away
So stay another day
Take a look to all that they have done
You see the lives they have destroyed
And then you lose control
