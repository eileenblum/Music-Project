[D. Cardoen - Y. Cluckers]

No thanks, you gotta break the rules
No longer servant to the Cause, think of what you're gonna do
Trust no more and you'll be free
They even don't believe a word of what they say
Raise your hands, not in despair
You can now take a look at that vicious game they play
Blind faith is what they want
Result is chronic ignorance but that is nothing new

No thanks is what we say
Think twice about the way
No fear, they're gonna pay
No thanks is what we say

Taste me once, belong to me
The eyes that watch you from the sky have time enough to wait
For you to fall, for you to die
All you become is a manipulated slave
No respect, your life's from you
More is what you need and that's what you shall not have
Dig your grave with what you need
You burn your life full speed ahead but could you only know ?

No thanks is what we say
Think twice about the way
No fear, they're gonna pay
No thanks is what we say

Say now what you want before they make it illegal
What the hell is the world coming to ?
Give me freedom, or give me death
Don't think about what will be left

No thanks, you gotta break the rules
No longer servant to the Cause, think of what you're gonna do
Trust no more and you'll be free
They even don't believe a word of what they say
Raise your hands, not in despair
You can now take a look at that vicious game they play
Blind faith is what they want
Result is chronic ignorance but that is nothing new

No thanks is what we say
Think twice about the way
No fear, they're gonna pay
No thanks is what we say
