[D. Cardoen - Y. Cluckers]

The danger is the fear of change
We all wanna communicate
Maximum sincerity
Fear for lack of liberty
Who are you, are you blind ?
Censorship rules your mind
Deep inside you're selfish
Live and let live

The growing gap between people
Is caused by their intolerance
They're trapped in their mentality
The only thing that they can see

One big family
You have no place to be
So get real
One discrepancy
Is poisoning the free
Can't you see ?
One big family

So get real
One discrepancy

Whose art is it anyway ?
Face the music of today
We just wanna be ourselves
Just like anybody else
Don't put down what you don't like
It's a way, way of life
You'll have to break the rules
It's a way of life

So get real
