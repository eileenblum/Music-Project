[D. Cardoen - Y. Cluckers]

Brother, I feel so lonely, I never dared to see this far
Don't tell us what to think, don't even tell us what to do
Lies are the only thing that really matters to you

Corruption of the innocent and enslaving of the free
You're in, you're here to stay and it's a horrible place to be
A world of endless wars where cupidity makes the rules
It's paranoia time and it's time to break the rules

Killing and dying, believing and crying
We're living in a world of fear
Living and lying, forgetting or trying
Paranoia time

It's easier to lie, we're not prepared to face the truth
Humanity's afraid to see what lies behind the lies
Self-destruction, break it up, refuse to play the role
Save your breath, make it end before you pay the toll

Killing and dying, believing and crying
We're living in a world of fear
Living and lying, forgetting or trying
Paranoia time

This is my place, this is my world
And I'm not gonna let them put it down
I just maintain my sanity
But they're trapped in their mentality
We're chained to the wall, there's no way to change
I'm searching how to turn the page
It's sickening not to see the light
And to live an eternal night

Killing and dying, believing and crying
We're living in a world of fear
Living and lying, forgetting or trying
