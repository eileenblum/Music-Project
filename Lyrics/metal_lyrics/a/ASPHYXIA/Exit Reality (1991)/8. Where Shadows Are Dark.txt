[D. Cardoen - Y. Cluckers]

I felt I was being betrayed
Break the feeling of faith
For now no changes were brought
How many battles were fought ?
You were proceeding like if I was a fool
For you I only was a mindless tool
Unreal illusion of a perfect world
Why should I worry it's an endless search

All I see is greed
Lies !  Why ?
Do as you were told, you have no need to be
Hate dictates the law
Lies !  Die !
When the barricades are coming down

You turn the area into a war zone
You're splitting me to the bone
Get real, close the trial, get a lethal dose
Of endless wars, lost causes
Humanity crying, an endless call
But it's regression, progressive downfall
Unreal illusion of a perfect world
Why should I worry it's an endless search

All I see is greed
Lies !  Why ?
Do as you were told, you have no need to be
Hate dictates the law
Lies !  Die !
When the barricades are coming down

I felt I was being betrayed
Break the feeling of faith
For now no changes were brought
How many battles were fought ?
You were proceeding like if I was a fool
For you I only was a mindless tool
Unreal illusion of a perfect world
Why should I worry it's an endless search

All I see is greed
Lies !  Why ?
Do as you were told, you have no need to be
Hate dictates the law
Lies !  Die !
When the barricades are coming down
