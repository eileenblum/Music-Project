An infant stares at the sky
Covered by the Starlights
Amazement fills his sparkly eyes

An infant learns to smile again
Covered by the gentle Moonlight
All of his sorrows were not in vain
...feeling so safely naked

Finally the clouds are exploding
Down down the rain is pouring
Hearing new colored birds sing
And fantasies breathing

Landed in a dream of deep enchantments
Overwhelmed by new warmth into my chest
Feelings of pleasure running into my body
I open my eyes and forever let go

An infant bathes in the light
Covered by Moon's serenity
Feeling that with his wings, to fly, he might
...a universe where...

Wilderness is full of wisdom
And where the wisdom is wild
Where Angels are better seductress
Then Gaia's darker child's

...now that my garden richly grows
Why would I need to harvest autumn's flowers...
