Alright, tonight we will climb to the sky
We will ride the stars tonight

I flee
And you fly
We fly
Tonight
In the sky

Tonight
We'll ride the stars
So far
Waiting
Midnight to ring

A lullaby for this wonderful night, climbing the stars
A melody that makes the big monsters sleepy

Flying
In new born spring
We sing
The hymn
Of new born stars

A melody playing with the feeling
Of when Midnight Rings

A magic kingdom
Unveils to my wide eyes
Revealing to me
How to ride the stars

Just hold on tight and
Don't close your eyes
You will soon see the Moonlight
Night's only ray of light
