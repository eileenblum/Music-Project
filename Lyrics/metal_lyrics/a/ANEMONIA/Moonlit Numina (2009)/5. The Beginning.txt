I still forever remember
the first time I heard
delightful sounds of hope
and the fire burning the rope

I could not hide my tears away
from this divine beauty
it feels like I had never
lost my heart at all

[Chorus]
Waves of passionate tenderness
Angel of all angels lending me her shoulder
Mystical garden growing in the Dark

I still forever remember
the feeling I had
of a new world revealing
and its dawning dream

I discovered
a very long lost child
who opened his eyes
and was inspired by the Moonlight

[Chorus]
Waves of passionate tenderness
Angel of all angels lending me her shoulder
Mystical garden growing in the Dark
