[written by: Philippe Beauvais]

I am not from a gutter
Even though it feels like it
I do not wish to murder
So why should I sing about it?

Dragons no more ride their wings
And I'm not the one lie
Satellite-illusions of stars shining
Makes me want to cry

What's the true meaning of Pleasures and Satisfaction?
What's the true feeling of total liberation?
Is a body deserted when it feels no more pain?
Is the heart useless when it no more longs to cry?

Oh can the garden of purple gloom totally be conquered?
Or will there forever be a flower somewhere living even if in ice?
