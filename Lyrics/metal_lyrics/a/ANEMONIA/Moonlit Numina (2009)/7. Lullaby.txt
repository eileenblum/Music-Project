Oh what a night
Dancing with the romantic breeze of spring
Feels like I could fly with my wings
My new purple wings

Oh what a site
Dandelions play with me in the park
Feels like my eyes now hold a spark
A new mystic spark

Sing once again with me the melancholy
And all the things we cannot see
Sing once again with me just a piece of truth and then well see
Just how seldom is our wisdom

Oh what a smile
A child has when his daddy comes back from work
The child doesn't see hes gone berserk
There's too much work

Oh what a scream
A child makes when some monsters shakes its bed
Their teeth are brown, their eyes are red
And I think it sounds fun

Sing once again with me the melancholy
And all the things we cannot see
Sing once again with me just a piece of truth and then well see
Just how seldom is our wisdom

The romantic breeze inspires rainbow twirling petals
To dance with me where the Moonlight shines

Oh what a spell
Changes city parks into magic realms?
Lets not say who is the lovely witch
Behind all of this

Sing once again with me the melancholy
And all the things we cannot see
Sing once again with me just a piece of truth and then well see
Just how seldom is our wisdom
