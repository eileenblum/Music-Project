Suddenly,
The Moonlight shines to me
It reaches me, into my humble bedroom
Suddenly,
I feel that I could flee

Magically,
It seems that I can see
All the eyes, from forests that never dies
Suddenly,
The tears fall into me

Through the trees, on the ground
Lies the light sought for so long
Through the branches and the caves
Sings a voice with unknown words

Suddenly,
Seems a voice into me
Sings to me, in unspoken tongues
Magically,
Her words I can now see

Telling me,
Soon you will see the sea
Fly the sky, and ride the stars
Telling me,
She is Eternity

Suddenly,
She opened all my ears
And I heard such wonders

I have heard,
Enchanting melodies
From the roses and from the thunder
This is all,
That I can make of it
This is all that I can make of it
