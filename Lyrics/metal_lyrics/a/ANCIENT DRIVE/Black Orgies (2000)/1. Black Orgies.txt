Deep was sin in unconsiousness
Betrothed with passion and love
Shall I indulge my desires?
Taste of fear, lust for blood

Devour her to me arms tight
Caress with mouth and tongue
Sweet wounds
Macabre, Sodoma, Erotica
Dark arts of our nature
Temptations of savage ways

Wicked witch
Never fade her beauty
Watch her bleed
We are not equal
Condemned drama
Our path of despair
Scream as you wish
Poetry of cruelty
