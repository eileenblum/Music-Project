[The seducement:]

Thought I was so near that beauty
That I sensed her perfume and fear
She dresseth in a scarlet dress, flaming as the
Wind blows
Her silhouette against the sunset
So dark,so cold

I felt the rush in my veins
-when my hands touched her neck
I tried to make her please me
-and to say my name
But oh, what a pity
-she took her last breath
Her eyes wide open
-I released her soul in death

[The victory:]

Should I excuse my vulgar manners
As I dare to please your naked breasts
With filthy fingers, I leave my marks all over you
Near madness I'm reaching for my ecstasy
When I cut her nails and hair
Shall they be my profit

[The repentant:]

Thought I was so bitter of my regrets
So sweet was her scent, a flower in bloom
It was one of my own secrets
So why are they judging me into doom

Lord of darkness, I hunt you down

I cry for those who have suffered for my needs
My wounds are so deep
As I bleed for my sins
My sins will be atone for
Misery in blasphemy
Suffering souls in grief
Join with me in death
