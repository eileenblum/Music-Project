Flickering of black candles
On our mourning path
Dark caresses on your skin
As you die in my arms
Die in my arms

Drink my grieving lust
Desire my blood-red wine
On your scarlet lips
And cry for our vestal kiss
As you die in my arms

Die in my arms
Do not fear
On your pale white cheek
A bloody tear
