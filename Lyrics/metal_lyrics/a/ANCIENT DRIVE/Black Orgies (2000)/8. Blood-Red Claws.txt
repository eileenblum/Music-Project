Take me into your bosom
And swallow me in a mouth with tongue of thorns
Seduceme into the strange philosophy
The ancientwisdom of the dark

Dress me with my body
Rape me with my innocence
Please me with my cruelty 
Bless me with my blood

And lay me asleep with gentle caresses
Of blood-red claws

Withered roses embrace
And fallen leaves of autumn for her face
Scenes of my dark dreams
Awake me, our souls in grief
