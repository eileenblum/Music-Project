Romance deep within
Whispering sweet miseries
The blood and sweat on the sheets
As I taste it on my lips

Whores, shaped like angels
Nymphs, with shiny black claws
Cast on me the spell of dark desires
Lust and orgasmic adores

Last bloody kiss
Will make an end of this
The bites on a pale whiteneck
She will get what she begs

Drunken I taste your wine
When my dark ecstasy comes
As I hunger for thy blood
You will bleed as I desire

Would you bleed for me?
