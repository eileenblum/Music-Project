Where the moonlight disturbs
I could see in dusk
My footsteps marked on the floor
Covered by dust
It glows in shades of blue
In the beams of full moon
It glows in shades of blue
In the beams of full moon

I saw her in the dark
Her teeth throwing sparks
Her body threw no shadow on the wall

She kneeled above me, savage beast
UntilI felt a movement of her body upon me
She arched her neck and licked her lips
Red tongue, as it licked her white shiny teeth
Make love with me until the end of life
