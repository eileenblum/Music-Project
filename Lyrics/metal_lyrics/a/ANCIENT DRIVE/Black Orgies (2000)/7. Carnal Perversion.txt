Blood, pleasures of flesh

She dressed herself in black
A hatred in her heart
Her cold brown eyes won?t hide
Her darkest sins
Burning lust between
Her black leather thighs

Dominion, her supreme
The pain of grieving life
Darkness, on her bridal bed
Letting our lust to hide

She makes love, for blood
Orgasms - of flesh

She falls, she falls from grace
-nocturnal is her life
Her carnal perverses, desires
-eternal is her life

Blood, pleasures of flesh
