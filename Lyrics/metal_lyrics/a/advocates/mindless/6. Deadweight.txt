Hold out on what is real, I believed in an open- ended fate
And everything I took for granted, will all but redefine me.

Blank stares calling out the coward in me,
Their eyes pierce like bitter cold.
I built this hell with my own two hands, blood mixed with the mortar and bricks made of fucking gold.

Keep me awake, and embrace the nothing
Being buried alive under the weight of passing time,
I can't breathe, I can't see, through these bloodshot eyes

Keep me alive, these chains that bind and break me
Attached to the anchors of my demise
And I will rest on the ocean floor.

I am Deadweight

Regret is all I have, I hold against myself the weight of the world, as the weight of my world, comes crashing down. I canât win.
Regret is all I know, hold against myself the weight of the world, as the weight of my world, comes crashing down. I canât win.

All I know, is this hell I've built
And all I hear are the wolves at my doorstep.
They're taking all I have; they're waiting patiently to watch me fall.

Regret is all I have, I hold against myself the weight of the world, as the weight of my world, comes crashing down. I canât win. Regret is all I know, I hold against myself the weight of the world, as the weight of my world, comes crashing down. I canât win.
