So Iâm back to where I started, living my life as a dream,
Contemplating if I move on or just give in.
Blame it all on me, I am the enemy
The alter-ego of my friends and my family
This will be the end, a new beginning; donât underestimate what is yet to come and what the truth has sung.

Day by day we are haunted, thoughts dragging us under, give me something to keep my head above water
All I can do is think of how to get myself out alive

Iâll let you know that you might have outsmarted us
But times have changed and weâll be taking it back for once
We are the soldiers, we are the keepers
And we will rise up to beat this

In the distance, I see the march of man and not the diamonds he feasts upon
Are you with me?
Weâll take the king and put him in his fucking place
Weâll take the king and put him in his place

What will you do when the hunter becomes the hunted?

Standing alone while you speak out of turn, I listen wondering when this will become my concern, when will I learn, when will I free myself of these problems
This is my lesson; teach me piece by piece, I realized thereâs nothing left for me
I look down and see nothing, I cant believe these are my memories, faded, washing their way out to sea, Iâm back to living my life as a dream

I built up walls of regret, I was the architect, lifeâs no longer something that I try so fucking hard to forget
Iâve been searching for days
