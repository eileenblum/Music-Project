A familiar sight of betrayal, that we all saw coming
How a captain can abandon his ship, but still the ship grows stronger
They say to keep your friends close, and your enemiesâ closer
Well I would rather see my enemies fade out of sight, out of mind into a sea of nothing.

We are the giants!

So tell me how it's all a lie how it's only rumours.
Don't believe a fucking word you said to me
Hold your tounge your wasting your time
You are only fanning the flames making them grow
The harder you try to defeat us the stronger it makes us
Watch as this monster you have created destroy everything you know.
