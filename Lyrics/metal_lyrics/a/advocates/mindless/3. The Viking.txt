Following this cold path, never gave me the crown
Itâs never been so hard to trust myself
When all I had is gone, and replaced with uncertainty
I seek a lonely horizon

For all the hearts that I stole
Iâm giving back on greater than my own
For all the lives that I've twisted and broken
Iâll take a knife to the king of misfortune

And Iâm still counting down the days
Till someone opens the cage, and throws me away
When everything I loved has turned on me

I am the bane of my existence

And with all that I could have been
With every aspect of who and what i am
i made all the wrong fucking decisions

With all that I could have been 
With every aspect of who I am
I made all the wrong decisions
