We arenât the daggers pressed against your back
All so familiar this hate must feel, the time of day wasnât yours to give,
but to these vultures youâd sell almost any fucking thing

Where do we draw the line? And do we draw it in your blood?
Weâre giving it as good as we get it, you opened our eyes.

We were so close to abandoning a pointless crusade, led by the weak, the blind and the suffering. I thought I knew your motives most of all, but in this act, you played us all.

And our scars mark the lessons weâve learned, and our pasts will stay the same. I wont regret all the words that I said, because our past will stay the same.

Mark my words, youâll never see another sunset
Mark my words, youâll never see another fucking day end

Keep holding back, and hold fast to the ropes of your demise.
Itâs never been so hard to live, it never was and it never ends. And ill take the sight of your cursed face with open arms
Our scars mark the lessons weâve learned, and our past will always be the same
Our scars mark the lessons weâve learned, and our pasts will never fucking change 
Would you give it all for another shot at us?
