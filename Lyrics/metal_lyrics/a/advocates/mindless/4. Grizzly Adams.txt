I swear to you this happens every fucking night
Go on and test me, judge me just to pass the time
Thereâs no excuse, so just cut me loose 
And Iâll keep living it up

I'll keep you close at hand
Oh, deceiver you've got nothing on me
You'll not replace what you never had

You canât stand here; the ground will swallow you whole 
Donât say that we still have time
My feet are firmly planted, and youâre six feet under ground

Set free, alone in your desperate attempts
To bring back ones who left you
You fake, you fucking fake

Shallow words will fall upon these fragile ears
Weighing me down, faded, I stare without reflection
You never gave me what i needed, never loved without reprise
And now you'll burn for it

Hold me back
I can't control myself

Keep me back, your worst nightmare, your ender

Wear your captives
Like armour around you

I swear to you this happens every fucking night
Go on and test me, judge me just to pass the time
Thereâs no excuse, so just cut me loose 
And Iâll keep living it up, living it up

I wont let go, of everything I held so close, you were never there
I never felt you there, just an illusion of sympathy.
