Wrath, hate, pain and death
The code we live by
It's in our souls
Metal is the way

We fight the world
With glowing metal
Now the falses will pay

Our fight has just begun
We're sent from hall of gold
Messengers of death

We're coming after you
You can't escape us
We'll take away your breath

See us ride for vengeance
Friends of the sun cross
We are born of steel

See us ride down
The Amon Amarth
The last sight you'll ever see

So as you stand there
Under gray-clouded skies
Abandoned by your god
You know you're gonna die

You feel a sorrow
Surrounding you
As of the nine worlds
Screaming pain you feel
Your soul vaporizes
As your hearts burst

We charge without fear
Your time has come
Your Fimbul winter's arrived

A chilling wind of ice
Whirls through your heart
Pierces your bones and spine

We are all
Gazing to the skies
We'll make the false hammer fall
And we'll make Thor arise

Our quest is done
Your creation burns
Now we return to Odin's hall

Our dragon's fly
Across the waves
As twilight begins to fall

In victory we ride
We enter the mighty doors
Of the spear-god's hall

As Ygg salutes us
We raise our beers
And drink in honor of our cause

We are all
Greeted by the Gods
We made the false hammer fall
And Thor arose in blood
