[2010 Re-issue Bonus Track]Thor, God of lightning
Crash all from the skies
Powerful in his sign of the hammer
Vikings follow him anywhere
Travelling far across the waves

They went where no oneâs ever been
Fighting from their roaring hordes.

Sailing, their banners off to distant shores
Crushing resistance wherever they were

Warlord of Vikings with glowing sword in their hands
Searching glory in battle, on shores of distant lands
Crushing their swords with Asathor
And when they die
They will reach Valhalla!

Almighty Thor!
Show us the way
Show us the way
In holy war

Lord of thunder
Lightning shudders across the clouds
Swing your hammer
Son of Odin will arise!
Thor arise!

Sacrifice in human blood
Sacrifice to please our true Gods!

Thor arise!

We are Vikings
Vikings we remain
Itâs in our blood
Thumping in our veins

Holly hammer
Crack the skies
Mighty powers
Thor arise!

Rise!
