So he found the heart in barren land
It was beating, still alive
He held it gently in his hand
And looked up to the sky

With evil thoughts of vicious kind
And sinister disdain
His thoughts of bringing back to life
The witch that died in flames

[Chorus 2x:]
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!

He then devoured Gullveig's heart
And she was born again
They brought to life an evil force
A beast that can't be tamed

With dark deception in his soul
Betrayal of the gods
The bane of Oden now is born
Born of evil blood

[Chorus 2x:]
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf!

They brought to life a malicious force
A vile beast that cannot be tamed
FimbultÃ½r's nemesis now is born
A vile beast that can't be restrained

Dark!
Deception in his
Soul!
Betrayal of the
Gods!
Oden's bane is
Born!
Born of evil blood!

[Chorus 2x:]
Serpent's kin
Born of sin
Dark within
Father of the wolf

Born of sin
