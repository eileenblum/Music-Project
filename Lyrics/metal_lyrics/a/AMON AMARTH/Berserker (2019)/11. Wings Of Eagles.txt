Driven out of Norway
To Iceland we set sail
My father then went further
To a place where we'd be safe
The barren soil of Greenland
Could not sustain our clan
We needed to go westward
To find a better land

We soar upon the wings of eagles
We fly across the open sea
We leave the rugged shores of Greenland
For a realm, a land, where we can be free

Then on an expedition
After days at sea
We saw on the horizon
A land of woods and fields
I would be the first man
To tread these newfound lands
Here we'd build our new life
Our future was in our own hands

Forty years of hard work
Struggling to survive
Fighting hard to tame the land
To make our people thrive
At first, we made some progress
In the end, we were too few
Our settlement decreased
And disillusion grew
After all these years of struggle
Of blood, tears, sweat and pain
We had to leave our new-found land
Our efforts were in vain

We soared upon the wings of eagles
We flew across the open waves
Our hearts yearned for the taste of freedom
To Vinland's shores we did set sail
Sailing west we found our new land
We tried to build a better life
But we had to go back to old Greenland
After years of hard work and futile strife
