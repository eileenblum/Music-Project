In the realm of Svartalvheim
Where master forgers reign
Loke met with Eitri and Brokk
With malice and deceit, he got them to agree
To create nine magic gifts for the Asa Gods

Brokkr had a sense of foul play in the air
So he made a wager for Loke's head

Treasures will be forged, for the Asagods
A spear and ring for the AsgÃ¥rd king
But finest of them all, The Crusher it is called
MjÃ¶lner! Hammer of Thor

Loke's treachery, knows no boundaries
He hid himself in the blacksmith's cave
But as work progressed, he feared he'd lose his bet
He knew his situation now was grave

Working the bellows
Heating the forge
Striking the anvil
Striking with force
Then as they worked on the last gift
A mighty hammer of war
Loke disrupted the work of the blacksmiths
The handle came out short

The nine gifts were brought to Odin's mighty hall
As Loke feared the Gods praised them all

Treasures have been forged, for the Asagods
For the Vana prince, a ship and boar
But finest of them all, The Crusher it is called
MjÃ¶lner! Hammer of Thor

Brokk came to claim his price
Loke fooled him twice
He saved his lying head
But got his mouth sewn shut instead

Treasures have been forged, for the Asagods
For Sif they made new hair of gold
But finest of them all, The Crusher it is called
MjÃ¶lner! Hammer of Thor
