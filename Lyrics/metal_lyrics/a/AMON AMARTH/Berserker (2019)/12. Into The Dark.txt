There is a darkness
In my soul
A darkness
That can't be tamed
A deep void of emptiness
A gaping wound
A vile, corrupted entity
That has no name

From the dark
Into the light
I make this journey
On my own
From the dark
Into the light
I must fight this darkness
All alone

I try to do
What is right
And still my twisted mind
Is full of spite
Each day a struggle
With this side of me
A losing battle
I can't break free

No!
I can't break free...

Out of the dark
My demons arise
Dragging me back
Into despair
Into the dark, into the dark
Every time
I think I am free
They drag me back down
Down through the void
Into the dark, into the dark
Dagas my guide
But Thurisas bides
Drags me back down
Into despair
Into the dark, into the dark

From the dark
Into the light
I make this journey
On my own
From the dark
Into the light
I fight these demons alone

No!
I can't break free...
Oh no!
This darkness is me...

I fight these demons
These agents of fear
I'm battered and beaten
My scars invisibly clear
So here I stand
Naked and true
I am who I am
I am Loke to you

From the dark depths
Of my mind
They crawl towards the light
My demons are a part
Of who I am
I embrace the dark depths
Of my mind
That invades my heart
'Cause without darkness
Who am I?
