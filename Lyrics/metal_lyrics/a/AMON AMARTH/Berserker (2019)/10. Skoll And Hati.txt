From the iron moors of Jotunheim
Arose two beasts of wrath innate
Skoll and Hati were their names
Born of Fenris, born of hate

See the massive grey-backs run
See them chase across the sky
In pursuit of moon and sun
Until the nine worlds all shall die

The gnarling jaws are closing in
Their vicious teeth drip of froth
A race the wolves are sure to win
And the world will end in wroth

The secret of the riddle is
That their fates are intertwined
Without each other they can't live
And together they will die

See the massive grey-backs run
See them chase across the sky
In pursuit of moon and sun
Until the nine worlds all shall die
See how Skoll and Hati runs
How they chase across the sky
They will swallow moon and sun
And then the nine worlds all shall die

At the end of time they devour sun and moon
Then darkness will fall upon the world
And the end of time will be coming very soon
When all living things shall burn
