The ocean waves are held in a firm, freezing grip
And the summer winds seem but a dream
Glistening veils of silver snow on our sleeping ships
Dark skies fill our souls with silent screams

But soon our longing hearts will soar once again
On winds across the open waves
Oh, how we're yearning for those warm summer days
When once again we can set our sails

A Viking's home is on the restless waves
Where salty winds carry far and wide
To foreign shores and glory wars we will set sail
With axe and sword by our side

But here we sit by glowing hearth
With warm ale in our hands
We reminisce of glory past
And make our future plans

Soon our longing hearts will soar once again
On winds across the open waves
Oh, how we're yearning for those warm summer days
When once again we can set our sails

Yes soon our longing hearts will spread their wings once again
On salty winds across the open waves
Oh, how we're yearning for that summer day, my friend
When once again we will set our longship sails
