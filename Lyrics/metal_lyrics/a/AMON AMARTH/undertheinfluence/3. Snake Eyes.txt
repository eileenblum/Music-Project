Life is just a lottery
No matter how you choose
But that has never bothered me
'cause I was born to lose

It doesn't matter what the cost
You know I won't give in
And I don't care about the odds
Because I play to win

[Chorus:]
You know I am a gambling man
And I have paid the price
Luck has never graced my hand
When I roll the dice
Snake eyes!

I trust the way I live my life
The choices that I make
To the rolling of the dice
No matter what's at stake

Some will call me fatalist
And some will call me freak
But hidden in my throwing fist
The fortune that I seek

[Chorus:]
You know I am a gambling man
And I have paid the price
Luck has never graced my hand
When I roll the dice
Snake eyes!
