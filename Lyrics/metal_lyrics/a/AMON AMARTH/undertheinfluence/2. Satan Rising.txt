In the deep and darkest forest
Night has reached its final hour
Pagans dance 'round brimstone fires
Lucifer comes to call

Evil rites are getting higher
Spinning fast hands to the sky
Unholy chants around the pyre
Heathens call, "Satan" they cry

Sacrificial rites
From the trees a blood-rain's falling
The end of all mankind
Satan stirs; he's heard their calling

From the underworld
Comes the beast arising
Demons gather to behold
From the shadows Satan's rising
