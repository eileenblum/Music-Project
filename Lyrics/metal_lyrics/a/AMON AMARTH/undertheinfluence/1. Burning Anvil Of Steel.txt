Rising up to reek havoc on this land
A beast straight from hell with burning steel in hand
White heat, blinding lights as the molten lava flows
Total devastation as the power hammer blows

Burning anvil of steel
Cast by demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell

Hammered down, a crushing force of weight
Razor sharp feel the metal penetrate
Grinding pain, the sparks that rip and blind
As Armageddon is brought upon mankind

Burning anvil of steel
Cast by demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell

Burning!
Burning!
Burning anvil of steel!
Burning!
Burning!
Burning anvil of steel!

Burning anvil of steel
Cast by the demons that dwell
Burning anvil of steel
Forged in the furnace of hell
