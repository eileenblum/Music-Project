[featuring Roope Latvalan]

There comes Fenris' twin
His jaws are open wide
The serpent rises from the waves

Jormungandr twists and turns
Mighty in his wrath
The eyes are full of primal hate

Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! HlÃ¶dyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
RagnarÃ¶k awaits

Vingtor rise to face
The snake with hammer high
At the edge of the world

Bolts of lightning fills the air
as MjÃ¶lnir does it's work
the dreadfull serpent roars in pain

Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! HlÃ¶dyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
RagnarÃ¶k awaits

Mighty Thor grips the snake
Firmly by its tongue
Lifts his hammer high to strike
Soon his work is done
Vingtor sends the giant snake
Bleeding to the depth
Twilight of the thundergod
RagnarÃ¶k awaits
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god
Twilight of the thunder god

Thor! Odin's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
Your destiny awaits
Thor! HlÃ¶dyn's son
Protector of mankind
Ride to meet your fate
RagnarÃ¶k awaits
