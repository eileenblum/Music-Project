Standing firm against all odds
guarding the most sacred home
we protect the realm of gods
our destiny is carved in stone

three evil giants
of the south
are constantly on the attack

with lies and fire
from their mouths
but we always send them back

we are brothers
of the north
who are sharing the all father's blood

marching down the left hand path
we are spawned by Asagods
'cause we are!

we're the guardians
guardians of Asgaard
guardians
guardians of Asgaard
guardians
of Asgaard

we have faced our enemies
a thousand times or even more

still they cannot
make us kneel
one thousand years of constant war
the giants look for
any chance
to bring down Asgaard's mighty walls
no matter what they send at us
we will never let it fall
'cause we are!

We're the guardians
guardians of Asgaard
guardians
guardians of Asgaard
guardians
of Asgaard

Standing firm
against all odds
we are guarding
AsgÃ¥rd's mighty walls
we protect
the realm of Asagods
no matter
what they send at us
we will never
let them fall

We're the guardians
guardians of AsgÃ¥rd
guardians
guardians of AsgÃ¥rd
guardians
guardians of AsgÃ¥rd
guardians
of AsgÃ¥rd
