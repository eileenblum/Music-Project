I'm out of breath
And all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes
With every step I take

My heart beats
It's about to burst
This day my luck
Turned to the worse

There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings
Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand

I fought so hard
For taste of victory
The war is lost
But I refuse to kneel

I can't go back now
There is no retreat
I will fight hard for
All that I believe

I'm out of breath
And all my muscles ache
It feels like spikes
With every step I take

I can't go back now
There is no retreat
I will fight 'til death
I make my final charge

I, make my final charge
I; have no fear in heart
I will no longer run
I, do not fear the dark

There's nowhere to run
Darkness is closing in
I don't fear the setting sun
Or the twilight that it brings
Dark clouds fill the sky
My fate is close at hand
Today is the day that I die
Today I make my final stand
