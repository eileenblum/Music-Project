Thunder rolls across the plains,
Thor rides in pouring rain.
He rides to Jotumheim to fight
Lightning strikes when MjÃ¶lner bites.

Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike

Lightning cracks the blackened sky,
Hear the thunder chariot ride
All brave men with hearts of war
Ride the path of mighty Thor

Son of thunder!
Lighting strikes
Son of thunder!
Son of thunder!
Thor Arise!
Son of thunder!

Son Of Oden
Thundergod
Master of War
Asator!

[Solo SÃ¶derberg]

Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
Fire! Burning in his eyes
Fire! His hate is pure, see the lightning strike
