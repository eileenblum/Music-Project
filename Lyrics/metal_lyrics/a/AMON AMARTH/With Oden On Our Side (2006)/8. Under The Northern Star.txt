The icy winter is creeping near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost in the air
Darkness surrounds us

The cold piercing autumn breeze
Fills the longships sail
Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil

Many years we've been away
Many oceans we have roamed
Now the North star guides us on our way
As we are heading home

The many hardships we've endured
Have brought us rich reward
Now the North star guides us home
With cargo full of gold

Many friends died on the way
Only few of us survived
But I would gladly take their place
In OdenÂs hall up high

[Solo: SÃ¶derberg]

The icy winter is creeping near
Dark skies above us
Biting frost in the air
Darkness surrounds us

Soon the lakes and seas will freeze
And snow will lay its veil
And we will long for the summer breeze
Where we can set our sails
