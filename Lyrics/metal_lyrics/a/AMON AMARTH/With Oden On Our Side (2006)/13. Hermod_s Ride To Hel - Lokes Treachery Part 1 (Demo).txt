[bonus disk track]

thunder ride
make your time
ride for all you have
the enemy of mortal men
No time to loose
Eternal time above me
evil in the dark
as they ride to neiflheim
to bring their brother back
wailing voices haggle the wind
begging me to turn
distant tortured voices scream
cold blue fires burn
I hear the sound of river Gjoll
running cold and deep
its golden bridge burns in the dark
the bridge that Modgud keeps

over the bridge
on through the night
Hel is getting near
there are the gates towering high
I'm broken without fear
in her hall at the honor seat
my brother sits in gloom
pale and tortured baulder greets
bearing a face of doom
Oh!!!!!!

I have come to bring him back with me
the whole mourns his death
we beg of you
set baulder free
give him
back his breath

if its true
what you say to me
that the whole world mourns his death
then ill take in the whole worlds whim
I will give him back his breath
