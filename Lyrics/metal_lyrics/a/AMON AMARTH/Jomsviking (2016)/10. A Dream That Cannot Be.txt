[Him:]
Years of wait are over now
She's almost in my grasp
Now I will fulfill my vow
She will be mine at last

[Her:]
I feel him near
The boy estranged has now returned a full grown man,
But still I fear that nothing's changed
He simply does not understand

[Him:]
Come with me
I'll set you free
And I'll show you
What your life could be

[Her:]
You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be

[Him:]
Through forests deep, over mountains high
I've crossed the waves for her
In shadows dark, this cursed night
My thoughts and memories stir

[Her:]
I've left the memories
Of our youth behind
I don't know what he hopes to find
In the shadows he waits for me
For a dream that cannot be

[Him:]
Come with me
I'll set you free
And I'll show you
What your life could be

[Her:]
You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be

[Him:]
She refuses to leave
So I grab her by force

[Her:]
I pull the knife I've concealed
I put the edge to his throat

[Him:]
Shocked by the attack
I can feel her final words sear

[Her:]
Leave and never come back
Or I'll cut you ear to ear

[Her:]
You can't see
That I am free
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be

[Both:]
I'll set you free
He said to me
And I'll show you what your life could be
I am free
She said to me
My life is mine, not yours.
So leave me be
