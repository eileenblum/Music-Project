The odds are stacked against me
Outnumbered three to one
These men are seasoned warriors
But I stand my ground

Waiting
Let them come
Ready
Cut them down

No chainmail for protection
I don't have a shield
Surprise my one advantage
Keeping my sword concealed

Hidden
Out of sight
Ready
Prepared to bite

The first man's coming at me
I am not afraid
The time has finally come now
To introduce my blade

Flashing
Fear its name
Slashing
Feel the pain

This is my sword
We are one and the same
My enemies' woe
Vengeance the name

The blade is swift and ruthless
It deals in death and harm
And as he tries to grab me
It cuts through his arm

First cut
Blood is shed
Dripping
Snow turns red

I've struck fear in their hearts
Now let the slaughter start

This is my sword
We are one in the same
My enemies' woe
Vengeance the name
This is my sword
The dealer of pain
Death of my foe
Vengeance the Game

The next man over reaches
And so he winds up dead
One cut is all that's needed
I removed his head

There's only one left standing
He's lost the will to fight
I point my sword towards him
He quickly takes flight

Running
From my sword
Victory
My reward

This is my sword
We are one and the same
My enemies' woe
Vengeance the name
This is my sword
The dealer of pain
Death of my foe
Vengeance my aim
