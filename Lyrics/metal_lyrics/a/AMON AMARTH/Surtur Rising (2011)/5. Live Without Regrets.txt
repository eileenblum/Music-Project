From birth we're taught how to survive
We're taught how war is waged
And there are no men now alive
Who stops our wild rampage

Light at heart we bide our bane
whatever death awaits!
Norsemen live without regrets
We accept our woven fates

So fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate

Don't despair, show no fear
Live your life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death

A coward thinks he'll always live
If it keeps himself from strife
Old age leaves no rest and peace
though spears may spare his life

We don't mourn a friend that fell
or dread the day we'll fall ourselves
Warriors don't go to Hel
'cause we know Ygg will greet us well!

Fearlessly we charge ahead
There is no time to hesitate

Don't despair, show no fear
Live your life without regrets
Don't despair and show no fear
In the face of a certain death

So raise your horns to those who died
Let's drink to fallen friends tonight
Let's celebrate their glory life
We'll meet again in Valhall when we die
When we die!
When we die!
