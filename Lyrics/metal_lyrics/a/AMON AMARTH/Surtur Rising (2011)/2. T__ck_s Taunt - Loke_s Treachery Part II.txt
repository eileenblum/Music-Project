You come to me, eyes full of grief
you ask of me to shed all my tears
to let him return from kingdom of fears
Why should I weep? or lose any sleep?
He never brought me pleasure or glee
so why would I help to set Balder free

You come to me,eyes full of grief
all of your tears mean nothing to me
so why will you not just leave me to be
am I to blame? Well, I'm not ashamed!
Oh how I smiled when I heard the tale
Of Loke the sly, so clever and brave

HÃ¶der the fool,Lopt's willing tool
he held the twig that cut Balder's skin
Lopt aimed the shot
that killed HÃ¶der's twin
leave me alone
don't come here and moan
I've never wished to see Balder's well
so let his soul remain down in hel

My name is TÃ¶ck and I won't cry
I won't let Balder return
Let hel keep her treasured prize
let his soul forever burn

You come to me and cannot believe
that this old crow now talking to you
is Loke not TÃ¶ck you bloody dawn fools
you come to me and you do not see
all of your tears mean nothing to me
why will you not just leave me to be

[solo: Mikkonen]

My name is TÃ¶ck,and I won't cry
I won't let Balder return
Let hel keep her treasured prize
let his soul forever burn
