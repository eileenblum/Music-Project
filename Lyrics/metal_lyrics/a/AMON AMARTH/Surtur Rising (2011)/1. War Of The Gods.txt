War, the very first war of our world,
When the treacherous witch was killed
Three times burned and three times born,
By searing flames was Gullveig torn.

Death, Odin hurled his spear off with great force
Deep into the great vana-fyrd
battle horns gave up their sound
And Asgard walls razed to the ground.

The Vanir felt deceived
HÅnir was a fool
without MÃ­mir at his side
HÅnir could not rule
In a fit of violent rage
MÃ­mir's blood was shed
and to Odin's court they sent MÃ­mir's severed head

Truce, so a brittle and frail peace was forged
And to ensure that the peace remained.
Njordr and Freyr to Asgard came
and HÃ¶n' and Mim to Vanaheim

Death, see the furious gods wanting blood,
Odin knew that a raging war
would not bring them any gain
Just leave a black and bitter stain.

Odin tog huvudet och
smorde det med Ã¶rter
som hindrar det
frÃ¥n att ruttna
han kvad sedan
trollsÃ¥nger Ã¶ver det
sÃ¥ att Mimer Ã¥ter
kunde tala till honom

[English translation:]
Odin took the head, and anointed it with herbs
which prevents it from rotting
he sang his magic songs over it
so that Mimer be able to speak to him

The Vanir felt deceived
HÅnir was a fool
without MÃ­mir at his side
HÅnir could not rule
In a fit of violent rage
MÃ­mir's blood was shed
and to Odin's court they sent MÃ­mir's severed head
