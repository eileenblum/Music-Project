See him rise, from land of flames
our destruction is at hand.
It is time to make stand
now I face, and awesome foe
I will always stand my ground
To this end my fate is bound!

This fight is mine and mine alone
and there's no help from anyone!

His wrath burns!
With insane heat
all his fury is unleashed
there is no way to defeat!
The forces and the power that he wields

My hand holds the horn so firm
I am calm and ready to die
Everything around me burns
And I know that I will not survive

See him rise from land of flames
in this wild and barren land
I will make my final stand
My death awaits, I have no fear
To this end my fate is bound
though I'm doomed
I'll stand my ground!

This fight is mine and mine alone
and there's no help from anyone!

[Solo: Simon Solomon]

I go forth to meet my doom
but I will die in vain
perdition waits for everyone
The world will die in flames

With all my strength I run the horn
deep into his eye
And as he swings his burning sword
I die with a tired smile!

[Solo: Simon Solomon]
