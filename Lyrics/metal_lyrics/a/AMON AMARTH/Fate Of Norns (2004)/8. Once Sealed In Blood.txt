It's five years since I left this land
Since I left my friends to burn
Five years making bitter plans
Preparing my return

All this time my hatred's grown
The one thing on my mind
The hate in me is all I've known
The one thing keeping me alive

Bold words spreads across the land
Bragging tongues speak carelessly
Know they not what is to come
I'll hunt them down restlessly

The oath I swore, once sealed in blood
A seal between loyal friends
I swore before ancient Gods
I will have revenge

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood

Now here I stand in pouring rain
As he comes riding down the path
He will learn the meaning of pain
As subject to my endless wrath

He will be the first to pay
For the bragging words he spoke
He'll regret that fateful day
My friends perished in smoke

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood

I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!
Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!
An oath! Before my Gods!
Once sealed in blood
I swore! Before my Gods!

So here I stand on the road
With cold steel in my hand
As he looks into my unforgiving soul
His tears begins to run

One man down 29 to go
Consider yourselves warned
I'm coming for the rest of you
And will have no remorse
