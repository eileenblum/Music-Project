The perpetual cycle rotates on the axis of despair. The unbroken link stands untouched by question. So uninterested we merely turn our heads. Uneducated, unrealistic, unsensible, so unrealistic, unsensible, so unrealistic, we sit and watch the cycle feed. If people had the power to snap their fingers to change the face value of life, many would withhold the energy, much rather watch in false pity. Around, the cycle rotates on the axis of despair. Untouched by question, we merely sit and stare. Such a blatant disregard for the fundamentals of existence, dwelling in a state of apathy, so obedient we follow. So uninterested we merely turn our heads, rather watch in false pity. No profit, no personal gain. Concentration, evolution, extinction. Whispering, speaking, screaming lies.
