The process of revolution has already littered the streets of Leningrad. The indivisible masses have been victimized by the pages of their own history. What they held in their hands slipped through their fingers and into the grip of the common threat. The wall they allow to be built around them, segregates by hope and nullifies their dream. Inseverable by principal, consolidated under common banner, the failure of emancipation, torn apart by their creation. A people who's self determination was the kingpin to their so called liberation, stand blindsided by misconception. Nullified revolution. Emancipation, deception.
