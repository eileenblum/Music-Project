This shattered mirror holds the only truth, the sole reflection of our existence which is broken into fragments. Each frail piece holds a distorted view of double standards and hidden agendas. Each sliver captures a cracked glimpse on scenarios of our exploitation. Each culture scrapes its identity attempting to squeeze through the cracks. But perhaps the most frightening image of all is the blank expression on the face of our society. How can we look at this anymore?
