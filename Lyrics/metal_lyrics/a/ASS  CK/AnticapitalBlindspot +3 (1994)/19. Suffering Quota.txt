No solid foundation for the suffering, we inflict useless pain. A sacrifice for profit, fulfilling the quota, nothing is gained. Denounce the role that animals play. Why do they die? Selfish lust imprisoned by your vanity, cleansed with guilt. In these tests the subjects always fail, needlessly they die. Images of pain squeeze through your narrow mind. What does the human race gain? (Are we so obsessed with death that we can not break free from its grips?)
