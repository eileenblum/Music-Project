The clowns are now the ringmasters backed with the arsenal of the economy. Our ears are plugged when we speak the tongue of reality. Failure to accept the truths, we speak of peace but push civilization to the edge. We can't build harmony on apathy and can't live on dreams alone. I pledge allegiance to the symbol of power and greed. It stands for a false republic under the guidance of a question mark god. Raping some, stealing from others. Fighting to scale the class ladder that splinters so many hands. Uncivilized. I'd rather close my eyes.
