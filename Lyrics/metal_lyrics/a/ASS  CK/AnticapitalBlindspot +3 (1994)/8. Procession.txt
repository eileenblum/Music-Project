Military livestock bred to expand state control. The underclass, suppressed, underprivileged and lured by incentive. Church and state, hand in hand, lead them through the trenches of war. A nation born blind should have been terminated in its infancy. There is no purity in the glory of commercialized patriotism, it's drenched in the filth of their deceit.
