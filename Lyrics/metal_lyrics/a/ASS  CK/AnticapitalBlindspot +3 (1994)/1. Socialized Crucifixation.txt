Your lifesblood has been sysematically drained by those who rule over you. Shouts and screams of freedom fall on deaf ears as our intellect is discredited and displayed on the gallows of our lives. Lifeless we swing as dictators continue to propagate, to legitimate lies which pave roads for the children. The loopholes of the system have been filled with your decorum.
