Policy is only a reflection of misery. Freedom reinforce conditioning and thoughts are but delusions of enslavement. Trailing in the shadows of the sightless. The treadmill of your pathetic life rolls on. The world is a series of cages and the people a nation of jailers. The blindspot encircles us all.
