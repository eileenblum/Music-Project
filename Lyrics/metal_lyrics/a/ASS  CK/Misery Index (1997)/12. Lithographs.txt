Enumerate the nameless and the unarticulated. Falsify their saintliness and chisel them into stone. From the distance I can hear your silence and I beg you not to fall into this snare. Of the many things worthy of dying there are none worthy of killing. Read what is hidden behind the paper, color and tears. They are double edged. Here every life given is adorned with the guilt of a life stolen from another child that cries for a loved one they never knew.
