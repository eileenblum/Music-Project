The longest battle I''ll never win. A scripture versed in the waning words of an already dead language. A vanity bearing unbearable exhaustion that prunes the heart and discolors the soul. My own worst enemy in which there is nowhere to run. The unabated decimation of self. Mine is sole witness to this never again
