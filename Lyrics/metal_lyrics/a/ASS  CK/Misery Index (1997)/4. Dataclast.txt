I've never wanted to admit the absolute and to its no absolution. that with much knowledge comes much anguish. that privity becomes Pandora''s plague. it is the iodine that indelibly stains. It is a lupus that disseminates and infects our being from the day we are born. Never will I sleep again until I''ve plundered every chapter and ripped out every page. I will slash and burn and salt the earth so that nothing will grow.
