Constellation
Lit up by the ardent madness of guileless wonders
For decades will shine
Yet for ages drained by death

Guilty shameful doctrine

Subject of the craze for anaemic utopias
Hidden confessions
Rotten genes as substance for all

The procession of martyrs
Shall choke with dishonour
Dead future as a new divinity
Prayers dissolve into lamentations

ZOG is dead

The procession of martyrs
Shall choke with dishonour
Dead future as a new divinity
Prayers dissolve into lamentations

I'm granted with vivid visions
Of death throes of their creed
Desolation leading the new order
My will crowned, their dogma has fallen

Dead seeds of deformity
The mongrel species shall not be
Fainted wounds of misery

ZOG is dead
