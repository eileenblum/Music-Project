One man is unlike any other
He is destined to rule them all

Conquering their hearts and minds
To seize the absolute power

Forging a reality of his own
By the triumph of will
And turning the world upside down
Not a stone left standing

A phoenix ablazes with contempt
He's soaring above mediocrity
With claws of steel shall be torn
Those who dare to resist
Judge and executioner in one
Reigning with scythe and rod
The arbitrary annihilation of life
Makes death the only certainty

The ressemblance of humanity
Erased by torment he inflicts
Emotions extinguished one by one
Until Godhood achieved

He was crossed a rubicon of blood
Marching past his killing fields
Never to be afflicted again
By the fallacy of empathy

No moral code does apply to him
He transcends beyond good and evil
Detached from mankind for good
Redeemed by solitary supremacy
