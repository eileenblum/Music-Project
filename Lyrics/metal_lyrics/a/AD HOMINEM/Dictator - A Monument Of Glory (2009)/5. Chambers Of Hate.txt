The primordial fear of a man feeds the upmost rapture of his enemy

They exhale that nauseous smell of the late corrupted mankind
They exhale the fear and grief of those who perished therein
They exhale the will of a mind endowed with acuteness the quintessence of death

Chambers of Hate

Foul endless corridors scattering terror transcended wonders of the past bleeding mirror scattering terror

Enslaved species: outcast

Fragments of non-life crowded and erased in shame
Crumbling monuments of cosmos
Fragments of non-life forever doomed to desolation

Dregs of misery drowned in misery
