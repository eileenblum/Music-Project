My contemplation achieved

Decay
Solution
Self

Through stories and beliefs crystallized
Until strength and spirit are melted
You shall hate me for what I am
I shall love you for what you do

Reflections of death shape the framework of might
Enlightened by anger, one unique end
The collapse divine

Kneel in front of your dictator
Give your soul, spill their blood
Be embraced by honour
Don't step back, nor repent

Follow. Serve. Obey. Worship
Devoted flesh - canonized soul

Follow. Serve. Obey. Worship
Fulfilled duty - sacred empire

Kneel in front of your dictator
Give your soul, spill their blood
Be embraced by honour
Don't step back, nor repent
Raise the name of your dictator
Die for him, blind and bold
Beyond either flesh or time
Live again and again

Dominate. Consecrate
Temples falling - genocide proceeding
Abolish. Soul and flesh
Foundations of God disfigured by blood

The creeds of the poor shan't soil books anymore
