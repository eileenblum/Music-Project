Little pious sister
Thirty and still virgin
Tight immaculate vagina
Still to be soiled
By one same kind soul

Kneeled in the shriving pew
To redeem the shame
Of an unexpected sin
It was just the beginning
As she noticed a gap
In the wooden fence
The divine light
Appeared in a glance

She saw Jesus 
Through that hole
His sacred stick
Blessed her soul
She sucked off
What came out of the wall
And Jesus cursed
The throat of the whore

Swallowing his holiness
Sanctified
For her complete devotion
The grace of God
The taste of hell
Even Mary would
Idolize her
