Verses of tolerance written by filthy hands
Canons of holy lies - Burn'em all
Illuminated goat skin to illustrate the true evil
Canons of holy lies - Burn'em all

See the sacrament of non-life

The swallowing of oneself
For the cult of absurdity
Canons of holy lies - Burn'em all
Blessed sacred slaughters
In the name of regression
Canons of holy lies - Burn'em all
Atrophied God-made cosmos and creation ex nihilo
Canons of holy lies - Burn'em all

Mankind equal to sheep, give mediocrity the lead
Canons of holy lies- Burn'em all

Baptized in soiled blood

Exhibitions of abundant gold, yet praising the
Giving of alms
Canons of holy lies - Burn'em all
Let's be the religion of love and a nest for pedophiles
Canons of holy lies - Burn'em all

Behold the lamb of God
Who takes away the sin of the world
Behold the lamb of God
Who takes away the goodness of the world

Burn them all
