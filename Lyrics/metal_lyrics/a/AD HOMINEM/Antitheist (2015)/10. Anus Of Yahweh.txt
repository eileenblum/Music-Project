A covenant of circumcised pricks
Self-proclaimed holy people
Wandering like persecuted zombies
Kissing a bunch of useless stones

Anus of Yahweh

Holy of holies
Ugly as the foundations of your creed
Rome spared a piece of your poverty
I shall spread your guts over it

Anus of Yahweh

Suffer - Pray
Your lamentations
Are the chant of absurdity
Suffer - Pray
You'll be rewarded with agony

Chosen people
I spit on your wall
