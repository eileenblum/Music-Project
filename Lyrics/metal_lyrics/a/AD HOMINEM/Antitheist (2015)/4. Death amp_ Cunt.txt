It is the termination
Of our carnal life
Cold and wet
No one ever came back

It is the departure
Of our carnal sin
Warm and wet
All have explored it

Inescapable vortex
Font of relief
A poison for flesh
A fountain of youth
A new race for a new world
The fourth dimension
Humanity isdoomed
From cunt 'til death

Death and cunt
Rule the world

Praise our lords
Hail our masters
Death and cunt

When the earth
Starts to collapse
When believers
Are filled with sorrow
When your pathetic Gods
Cry blood
I shall be crowned
In lust and rot
