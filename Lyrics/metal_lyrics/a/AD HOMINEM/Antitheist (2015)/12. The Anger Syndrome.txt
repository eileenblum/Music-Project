I shall execute
Those who betrayed
The non-believer
A monumentum of sin
And lucid heresy

Desecrate all icons
Conflicting faces to freedom
One unique ending: Death
Thousands of years
Of miserable existence

Faith is the guide of mediocrity
Symbol of the foolish human mind
Hope as a leader for the weak
Eternity awaits in earth and rot

I am death's prophet
Pure and unattainable
Standing against you worms
Alone and strong

When the skies turn black
And your temples collapse
When dogmas fall aprt
The antitheist
Shall be crowned 

Impious sacrament
