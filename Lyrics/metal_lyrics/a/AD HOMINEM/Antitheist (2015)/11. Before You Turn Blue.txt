I can't stop craving for this sublime body
Intact like I saw it the first time
Those sweet delightful curves
The embodied sin of flesh
Provocative and shy
A place of wandering and contemplation

Turn me on before you turn blue

My darling, you look more aroused than ever
That crooked grin has yet to go away
Your hard delicate nipples
Keep on begging for my tongue
Dead or alive you're still the same
But you don't scream anymore
When my warm semen fills your cold tight cave

I love you dead
