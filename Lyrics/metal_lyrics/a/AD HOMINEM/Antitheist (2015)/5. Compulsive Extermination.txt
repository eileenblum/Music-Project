I am the cure to humanity
A flawless will to destroy
Built on lucid hate
Born to achieve my fate

Infect and terminate
One goal: annihilate
Compulsive extermination

I have mercy for none
Blessed by death itself
Magnificient and out of reach
I am your hell

The transcendance
Through deshumanization
Is the one sought
After condition
This momentum
Beyond any control
A brilliant experience
For oneself
I have reached the essence
Of my existence
