A new race for a new world
Is the reason I fight for
A spectral existence for despotic souls
A life free from carnal corruption
- No more futile beings -
They'll suffer my determination
The essence of extermination

This is my will to power

They may believe in compassion
I don't even know this feeling
I'll reward their weakness with pain
Ignorance and cowardice
Will be the victims of my anger
I'll never forget those who betrayed me
My blood, my race

This is my will to power

Will to power - Possess me
Will to power - Transcend me
