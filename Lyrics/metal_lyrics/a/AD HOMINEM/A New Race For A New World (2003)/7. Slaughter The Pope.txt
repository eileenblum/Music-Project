Your senility reflects your dying religion
Decades of reign among the perverted lambs
Praising tolerance and forgiveness
But concealing Holy Inquisition's deeds

Shaking but never wanking
Anus of humanity

In the name of heathen ancestors I shoot the pope

Impotent pedophile pig
I'll cut your flaccid dick
And I'll nail it on your forehead
Does it remind you something?

I know you won't live for a long time now
But you don't even deserve one more day
Will your weak soul forgive me?
Of course not you master of hypocrisy

I'll pray for your pain
Tortured by the burnt heretics

Shoot the pope
