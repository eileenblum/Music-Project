[Unleashed Cover]

As my final call
Sounds the charge
...to war

I hate the universe and everything inside
I detest all I see, nothing pleases my mind

Execute them all
It''s my final war

I hate the sight of you, fashion fake
Joke
I detest every man who cannot stand
Alone

Execute them all
It''s my final war

As my final call
Sounds the charge
...to war

I hate the tales you tell, I don''t
Believe a word
I detest the stuf you sell, I''ll hunt
You around the world

Execute them all
It''s my final war

When my days are numbered you''ll hear
My final call
I''ll take their lives away, I''ll execute
Them all

Execute them all
It''s my final war

Execute them all
It''s my final war
