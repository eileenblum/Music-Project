Spectres fathering listless wimpsHolding the rusty keys of futureWithdrawn into their faithSullied is their honour Undividuals feeding the smug mongrel kindI shall not share this prideContemptible declineExuding death from every pore Theory 0 is now effective, banner of non-future, organ of the implacable truth...May they remain blind Compassion : undoneTolerance : undoneLove : undoneHope : dead Where their end starts, my will risesDespising the proud bastard raceComatose patient of an impalpable decay
