Execution is the matrix of epuration
Kneeled and blindfolded
Your life of primate is drawing to an end
Think of everything you've seen during one second
The last thing that'll come into your head is a bullet

This psalmody is yours

Allah's forsaking you
Your ignorance is all that you own now
Do you realize?
You'll never soil my land again
I killed you with my proper hands

This psalmody is yours
