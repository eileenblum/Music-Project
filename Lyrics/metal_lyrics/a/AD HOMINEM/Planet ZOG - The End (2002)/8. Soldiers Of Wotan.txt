Born under the banner of valour
Defending their land sword in hand
They will die as proud warriors
And will be welcome as kings in Valhalla

Savagery and genius of war
The victory's already written
Corpses lying on the battlefield
Odin's children meet Death in honour

Odhal forever standing on their property
The runes' power will protect them endlessly
We are them

We, the soldiers of Wotan
We spread terror and spill blood
By Mjollnir we will crush weakness
Thus will begin our reign

Soldiers of Wotan
Give us your power and knowledge
Come from Asgard and live once again
In our spirits you'll dwell
And you will ever reign
