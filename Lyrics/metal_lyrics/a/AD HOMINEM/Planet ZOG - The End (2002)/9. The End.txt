The end

Can you hear the macabre silence?
Can you smell the putrefied flesh?
Can you taste the vomit in your mouth?
Can you see the inexorable tragedy?

I can touch Death

Can you hear the glorious silence?
Can you smell the delicious flesh?
Can you taste the pure blood in your mouth?
Can you see the inexorable beauty?

The end
