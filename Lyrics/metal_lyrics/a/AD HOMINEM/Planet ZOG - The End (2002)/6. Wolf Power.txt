Gathered around our prey
We're observing our victory
This weak human and all his beliefs
Is nothing but putrid shreds of flesh

We are the wolves
The wrath of our ancestors
Spilling the blood
Of the bastards sons of god
We are the wolves
The future life on earth
Hunting like predators
All kind of impurity

The Jewish corporation
Will be savagely devoured
Eternally

Wandering in the woods
Running towards the unknown
We are our own masters
Only worshipping ourselves
