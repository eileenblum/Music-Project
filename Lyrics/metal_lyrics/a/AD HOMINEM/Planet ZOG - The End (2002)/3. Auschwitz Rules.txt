Crowded like animals
You're the waste of existence
Doomed to ignorance
You'll disappear in shame and pain

The spectre of Auschwitz is hauting your minds
It didn't forgot you were born to suffer
And we, ruling over your insipid lives
We'll raise our weapons and you will return to the past

The proof of your decay, Auschwitz didn't go away
You will know the agony of your carnal hypocrisy
Burn in the flames of hatred, be forgotten in the sphere of silence
Forever now you will be nothing but an empty page of history

Auschwitz rules over the Torah
Auschwitz rules over the Coran
Auschwitz rules over the Bible
Auschwitz rules over you bastards
