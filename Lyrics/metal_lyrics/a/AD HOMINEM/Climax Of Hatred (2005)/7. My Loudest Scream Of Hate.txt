Proud falling world of god
Made of crawling cockroaches
Like the phoenix, burn from the inside
Yet not rising again afterwards

Surrounding poorness of mind
Worshipped by the highest scum
Shouting down the noble will
To rise above the wretched life

Proud falling world of lies
Escaping the caustic truth
Praising happiness worldwide
Although essence of all wounds

Surrounding richness of ignorance
Concealed by a fake beauty
Spitting on the upper man
Reducing him to a manure heap

From ashes to perfection
From nothingness to everything
From paradise to extinction
Lost dreams of glory for the living

Sick, tormented, disgusted
I'll forever curse you all
Despicably dedicating
My loudest scream of hate

Sick, tormented, disgusted
I'll forever curse you all
Despicably dedicating
My loudest scream of hate

Sick, tormented, disgusted
I'll forever curse you all
Despicably dedicating
My loudest scream of hate
