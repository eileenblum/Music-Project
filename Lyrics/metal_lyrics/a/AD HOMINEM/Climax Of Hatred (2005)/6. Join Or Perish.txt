Ignore their morals
Despise their faith
Abhor their lives
Forget all that they've taught you

When anger rises
When mankind doubts
When the earth is doomed
Your fate: join or perish

Apathy and scorn shall prevail
For ages to come
Centuries of suffering
Embryonic despotism

Blackened theories of human existence

When anger rises
When mankind doubts
When the earth is doomed
Your fate: join or perish

When anger rises
When mankind doubts
When the earth is doomed
Your fate: join or perish

When anger rises
When mankind doubts
When the earth is doomed
Your fate: join or perish
