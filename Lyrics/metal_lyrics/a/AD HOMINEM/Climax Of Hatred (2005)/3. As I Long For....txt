This is the day losers!!!
All of you are condemned
You will smell the flesh
Of hundreds of burning corpses

Victims of terrorism
Oh poor innocents
Victims of terrorism
Forget your descendants

Your nation may pray for you
But I'll forever scorn your lost ceremony for life

Enhanced faces of evil
Crushing the weakest faith
Mourn for your nearest and dearest
As I long for terrorism

The only motive: hatred
When your pain is my pleasure
No pity for such human scum

Enhanced faces of evil
Crushing the weakest faith
Mourn for your nearest and dearest
As I long for terrorism

The only motive: hatred
When your pain is my pleasure
No pity for such human scum
