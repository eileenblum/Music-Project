I am filled with admiration for the visionary canvas
Painted with the will of giving life to the forthcoming final war
And of spreading the wildest terror

May it show them all
Life is drawing to an end
May it show them all
Death is coming back again

Armies fed with hate taking back what is theirs
Crushing without pity subcultures of modern worms
In the most complete intolerance

Vivid colors for black events
Writing the last pages of history
Canceling all former lies
Concluding the plot of human life

Looking forward to another existence
From ashes will rise a new essence
No religion, nor lowest lambs
Only cold plain and devastated landscapes

I am filled with admiration
