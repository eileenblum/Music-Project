[Originally by Mysticum]

Flames are crawling up on my face
I'm running after my shade
Out of sunlight and into darkness
Into my crypt of fear

Into my crypt of fear
Out of sunlight
Into darkness
I'm chased by my own fear

The unholy master is watching me
Is it him the Devil, that are torturing me
Close my coffin and let me be

Into my crypt of fear
Out of darkness
Into the twilight
I feel like a demon in the night

Flames are crawling like pets on me
The shades aren't here to see
With my master the Devil my friend
My soul will slave for eternity
