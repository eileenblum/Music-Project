Falling conspiracy of the impotent morals
Guilty of deeds
So proudly blamed

Revolution of mind
Carnal cataclysms
Human Disaster

You will pay for the lies you preach every day
H.A.T.R.E.D
Dethroned from your so futile perfection
H.A.T.R.E.D
Mass murders until the extinction of your faith
H.A.T.R.E.D
Forgotten as the inconsistency of your worms
H.A.T.R.E.D

Reaching the climax of hatred
Reaching the climax of hatred
Reaching the climax of hatred
Reaching the climax of hatred

Falling conspiracy of the impotent morals
Guilty of years of repressive freedom

You will pay for the lies you preach every day
H.A.T.R.E.D
Dethroned from your so futile perfection
H.A.T.R.E.D
Mass murders until the extinction of your faith
H.A.T.R.E.D
Forgotten as the inconsistency of your worms
H.A.T.R.E.D

You will pay for the lies you preach every day
H.A.T.R.E.D
Dethroned from your so futile perfection
H.A.T.R.E.D
Mass murders until the extinction of your faith
H.A.T.R.E.D
Forgotten as the inconsistency of your worms
H.A.T.R.E.D

P. For the Pleasure to watch your end
A. For your Agony, so sublimely lingering
I. For the Ignorance that sank into your veins
N. None of you shall survive
