My fate was pre-ordained 
I felt the presence of it
It left me here in vain
In nothingness

Within this hollow shell
I saw what I've become
A conscience black of shame
Is all that I have left

The things that I've done
Becomes me and it's
Clouding my night and day

I'm dying to find out
What made me this way
I live in my sleepless night

Worlds apart
Different lives
The lonely search

Worlds apart
Natures call
The dawn I ride
