In my head a whisper I hear
Waking my senses so clear

A softer thought rests in my mind
Bringing me home to the light

My desire of harmony in life

Just to see and hold the world
In a grain of sand
Sets the spirit free

To feel eternity
In a grain of sand
So it did to me

It suddenly occurred to me
Hot to just beauty see

My desire of harmony in life

Just to see and hold the world 
In a grain of sand
Sets the spirit free

To feel eternity
In a grain of sand
So it did to me
