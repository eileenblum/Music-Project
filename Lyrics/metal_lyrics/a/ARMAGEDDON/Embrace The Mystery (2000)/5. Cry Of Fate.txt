Words unspoken
Round the next corner
Walking around in the unknown

The silence unbroken
Echoes in my head
Waking the child of tomorrow

It's hiding, waiting
Closing, changing

Strong emotion
Leads the chosen way
Finding traces of a new land

Long devotion
A piece of the past
Learning, observing the day

It's hiding, waiting
Closing, changing

Cry of fate
In the broken sign of time
Hear the silent cry of fate
Where the dream has left the night
Hear the cry of fate

A reflection in the rear view mirror
When driving on future road
Beyond the horizon, the destination
To be free from the chains of boredom
