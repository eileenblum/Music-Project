Standing on the edge of madness
Waiting for the call
Locked away and isolated
In a neurotic fantasy

I fight against the evil spell
The force of silence

Sliding down the slope of sadness
Burning from the speed
Chained into the switch of darkness
Watch me fade away

I fight against the evil spell
The force of silence

I'm a victim of blind fury
Wanted by the dark and the beast
I'm a victim of blind fury
