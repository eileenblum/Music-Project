If the light is gone
If your moon has fallen
And you're digging in your inner city

Just wait and see
Your sun will rise
When the morning breaks you'll see

So my son
Embrace the mystery
In time the truth is to be seen

When your hope has flown
When the bridge has broken
And you're tumbling down the stairway

Just wait and see
Your sun will arise
When the morning breaks you'll see

So my son 
Embrace the mystery
In time the truth is to be seen
