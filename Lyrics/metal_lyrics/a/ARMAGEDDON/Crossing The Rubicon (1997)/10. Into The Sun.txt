i am the sole survivor of this illfated mission
all the others are since long dead and gone
we had dreams, we had visions
nothing left now but one crude decision
inhuman temperature slowly rising
gasping for air, all supplies are wasted
we turned the last pages of history
our fate shall be shrouded in mustery

shall we truly be no more?
it is hard to comprehend
yet i fear it to be true
beyond all hope, it is over
there is no point in going on
(where did we go wrong?)
an optic illusion
children of another dimension
the stars shine so painfully bright
on this, our last fatal night

crossing the rubicon
into the sun...
am i the chosen one?
into the sun...

we were the blessed, the chosen few
survivors of the holocaust
we had the confidence of youth to pull through
now i'm so much older and feeling lost
i steer this ship into the sun
the flesh of our bodies melt into one
what once was our vessel
now a burning rock, our epitaph... our final requiem
