i put my trust in technology
now i'm doubting we will ever reach our goal
all ambition is now finally lost
i'm no longer prepared to pay the cost
every dream, hope anticipation
that we used to share
was it all for nothing
were we fools to believe?

faceless - enter the dead zone
faithless - in the red zone
