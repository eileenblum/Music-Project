we are all in a state of mourning
grieving the ones who did not survive
we perform a ceremony for dead
as their caskets float away into space
but we know we've got to keep going
pushing forward into dark universe
on a mission to rescue our race
secure the future of our kind

asteroid dominion
the star or our fantasies and dreams
asteroid dominion
shining so bright
asteroid dominion

evrything is a circle constantly moving ahead
somewhere out there we will find our own utopia
a new for future generations
legends in our own lifetime
a fresh start without degeneration
a brave new world

unto a land flowing with milk and honey
beyond the known universe
in a hidden galaxy, a sacred sanctum for you and me
i'm praying for a peaceful existence
as unlikely as that may seem
tell me what good is man... without his dreams?
