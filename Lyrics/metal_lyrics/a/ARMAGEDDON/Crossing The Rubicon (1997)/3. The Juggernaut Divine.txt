a final sign the sky is falling down
this world has come undone
armageddon has arrived
in the shape of a killing machine

destroying you
pulling you under its wheels
crushing you

a sadistic instrument of pain
to hunt down our race like animals

invincible - eraser of life - truly evil
the juggernaut divine

a warcry killing the unborn
suffocating heat and the stench of
burning human meat
our culture now destroyed forever

as the war machine keeps turning
the flames of hate - still burning
