climb into the shuttle, there is no time to waste!
this is the last you will see of your family and home
the demigods have taken their lives, taken control
from now on we are renegades, destined to roam

we are blessed th chosen few
survivors of the holocaust
men, women and children work as crew
unite together we must

what lies ahead of us is a mystery
we all hail the new horizon
a future paradise in another galaxy
try to fill this myopic void

as we travel through the infinity of space
i lie down to rest and my mind wanders
will we ever find another friendly race?
i stare into the blackness outside... i wonder...

we will make our own destiny
create our own future
there are no boundaries
we are truly free
