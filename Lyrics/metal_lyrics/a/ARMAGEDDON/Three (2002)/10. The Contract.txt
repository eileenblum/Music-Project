Your god failed you
In this moment
Spreading black wings now
Losing yourself
To the thrill of the game
Your dying emotions are feeding the flame

Can't turn back, it's too late to run now
Stand and face your fate
Time to pay with your soul
(You're) caught inside the spell

Spirits lasts
Forever screaming
Into new dimensions
Lurking, crawling
Choking you
Ghost inside your head
