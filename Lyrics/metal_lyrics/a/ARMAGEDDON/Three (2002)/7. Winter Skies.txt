See the ocean turn to sand
And the sand become a crust
(Let's) ride a moonbeam, you and I
Lit a million years ago
Living in a world they've made
Got you on your knees
To conform and to obey
Time has come to fight!

Under winter skies
I realise
This life is just a dream
A fantasy...

Break the shackles, break the chains
Seize the day my friend
Streets are calling out your name
Beckoning with pleasure
Fly into the sun
Burn your wings and live so free
Chose the dream until you die
To the edge of space and time
