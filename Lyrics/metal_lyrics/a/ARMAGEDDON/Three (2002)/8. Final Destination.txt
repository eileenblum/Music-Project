Day is eating the night away
It's time to leave again
Born a rambler with a restless soul
I'll be gone in the morning

Always searching for the final destination
Always dreaming away his desolation

Guess I'm a loser but it ain't my choice
You never know how the chips may fall
If you take the smooth you're gotta take the rough

Waiting for the dawn
Is there a light at the end of the tunnel
