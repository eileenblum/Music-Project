A thousand years ago
In a far and distant land
The people pledged the earth
And the children lend a hand
Then came the drought
And all the crop would die
They called upon the serpent
To bring mercy from the sky

Rainbow Serpent

Scales of a million colours
Eyes of crimson fire
Sliding cross the universe
And cracking the sky
The shaman wields his cane
The spirits will arise
Ancient world, ancient rules
Passed down through centuries

Do the rain dance
The ritual's begun
Help this peaceful tribe
And bless us with rain
