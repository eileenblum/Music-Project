Floating down the Milky Way
I'm leaving it all behind
Gentle cries are echoing
A star is born, another dies

Give me closure, give me an end to this sadness
Standing on the brink of madness

Fading into oblivion
Walking back from where I came
The road is hard and nights are cold
I tremble and loose my hold
So alone I fool myself
That I'm not just tumbling in the darkness

Tell me tales of yesterday
When our hearts were strong
I heard you say... "nothing lasts forever"
Visions of the future
And memories of the past
Are cast into the well of sadness
