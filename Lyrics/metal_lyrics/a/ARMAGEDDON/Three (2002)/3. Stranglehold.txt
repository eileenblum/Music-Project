You drain my strenght... you suck my blood
You're getting to me... like a disease
Can't take a ride... at my expense
Tables have turned - now I call the shots

No stranger to this pain
Feel the stranglehold again
Life's a loosing game
We all take what we can

Tell myself it's gonna to be alright
Made up my mind for sure this time
I'm leaving now there's nothing you can do
I'll be ok, once I get out of here

Free...
I've got to be free
You'll see...
Freedom is the key

Now that it's all over and done
Alone again... it's my destiny calling
In control, I'm back on the track
Standing strong... the power of one
