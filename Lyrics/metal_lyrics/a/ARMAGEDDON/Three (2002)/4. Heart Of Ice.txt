Steel blue eyes, so damn cold
Iron hard conviction, tar black soul
She gets around, yes she does...
Ain't no angel in white
Child of sin, raised under neon lights

Claws down my back... hot breath on my neck
Mmmm... She's tightening her grip, around my heart
Got ways to make me stay, brings me to my knees
To crawl into the shadows, and beg for more

Iron hard conviction... Heart of Ice
Tar black soul... Heart of Ice

Steel blue eyes, so damn cold
Iron hard conviction, tar black soul
Got ways to make me stay
Brings me to my knees
To crawl into the shadows, and beg for more

Steel blue eyes... Heart of Ice
So damn cold... Heart of Ice
