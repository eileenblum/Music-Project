Sleppless nights, you're counting the days
We're heading your way
Waiting for the time to let it all out
All that you're holding inside

People who say, you're wasting your time
They'll never understand

Here we come
We'll burn the sun
Together again

Feel the tension, it's building up
Ready to explode
Adrenaline rush as we hit the stage
Let the music take control

We're flying high
The spirit is strong
Together again
You can't hide the feeling inside
