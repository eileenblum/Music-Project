Open wide
The mouth of your civilization
Enter from the south
The kiss of swift sweeping death

Miasma clouds the air
Drink deep of your mortal libation
As blackened boils swell
You question your pontification

The great equalizer
In a shroud of pestilence
The great silencer of man

Is this real?

Masked men walk the streets
Poking at the heaps
Of yesterday's vital sons

The great equalizer
In a shroud of pestilence
The great silencer of man

What I've lost
What I've become
A seeker in the dark
Alone

Across the continents
A plague rides
On the backs of rats
Seeking a host
Warm, sweet
Social animals
So unaware
So unaware

The great equalizer
In a shroud of pestilence
The great silencer of man
