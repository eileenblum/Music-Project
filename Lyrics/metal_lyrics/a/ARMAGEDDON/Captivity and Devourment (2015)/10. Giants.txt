Beyond the clouds
And all we know
Far past our comprehension
And earthly code

Conditions exist
Supporting life
At different points upon
The evolution unit

Chemical composition
Origins of life
Cosmogenesis

Dispersed among
The burning stars
Various levels
Simple and complex

Cellular birth
In primordial soup
Abiogenesis
Progress to the unknown

Chemical composition
Origins of life
Cosmogenesis

Chemical composition
Origins of life
Paints the face of its beast
