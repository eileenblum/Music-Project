Visions of a city maze suspend my vivid mind for days
Faces mirror not my own transmission complete, they are gone

Vacant
Abandoned
Deserted
Metropolis, leave me in vain

When the night falls upon this cratered crust
I see strange constellations
Consider them fugitive dust

Red star sets in a foreign sky
Corridor memory starve my eyes
Display the message I should see
Desertion fixation, my mystery

Vacant
Abandoned
Deserted
Metropolis, leave me in vain

When the night falls upon this cratered crust
I see strange constellations
Consider them fugitive dust

I find a purpose here
Among the shattered spheres
Empty world, left behind
In obscurity

When the night falls upon this cratered crust
I see strange constellations
Consider them fugitive dust
