Through this window
I can see
The emptiness
Staring back at me

Capsular
Insulation
Coiled in
My machination

Oh it's enough to drive me insane
The solitary toil
Throwing my living remains through space
I'm mentally devoid

Go

Looking out
I can see
The years go by
Eternally

Oh its enough to drive me insane
The solitary toil
Throwing my living remains through space
I'm mentally devoid

Nothing left
To see inside
All was there
Has shriveled dry
Eaten by
My memories
Erased in a fevered mind

In a vacuum
In a vacuum
In a vacuum

Oh its enough to drive me insane
The solitary toil
Throwing my living remains through space
I'm mentally devoid
