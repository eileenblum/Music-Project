Watch the moon
Crater face turning back
Against the light
Return with the message

Retreating shadows
Hide in the frozen sphere
Civilisation
Unseen, unheard

Watch the moon

They descend
Vapour trails gleaming vessels
Eternal night
Lunar light the only guide

They'll never find us
Trapped in the frozen sphere
To help or harm?
Their intent remains unknown

Seven ships
Navigate the sky
Hibernation
In isolation

Watch the moon
Crater face turning back
Against the light
Return with the message

They'll never find us
Trapped in the frozen sphere
To help or harm?
Their intent remains unknown
