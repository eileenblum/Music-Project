I've been watching you
Waiting for your time to come
Telescopic view
The end is near

Magnificent tantrum
Generate your fading light
Give in to yourself
The end is near

Crushing mass
Eat the light
Collapse into
Empty night
Release yourself
Just to be
Part of my
Great observation

Cryogenic
Infrared
Observatory is my home
I can see
Your helium
Deficiency
About to explode

Megalomania
Thanatron
I behold
Your demise
Years beyond
Your megalomania
In dying throes
Secrets of
Sudden life
Are mine to know

I've been watching you
Waiting for your time to come
Telescopic view
The end is near
