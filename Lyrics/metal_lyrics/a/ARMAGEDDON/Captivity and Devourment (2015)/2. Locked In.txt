Become my eyes to see your world in foreign view
Become my skin a touch that's cold
And deep within reach further towards a beating heart incarceration
The chase has just begun

Predator of sanity
Assailant of vitality
Collect the burning soul
Collect the primal urge

Locked in
My consciousness
Confinement
Asylum

Locked in as gateways close
I'm shutting down to keep you out

Become my hands and touch your world of sub terrain
Become my veins push the liquid coursing through
Be slow my heart
Stave gluttonous savagery
Be slow my heart
Obstruct the lustful wrath

Predator of sanity
Assailant of vitality
Collect the burning soul
Collect the primal urge

Locked in
My consciousness
Confinement
Asylum

Locked in as gateways close
I'm shutting down to keep you out

World drained of living beauty eaten from the inside
Taken by a
Conscious force
Consumed
