Hey you! Where're ya going?
Keep your head up-high
and watch your steps.
You're in a "jungle", it's an eye
for an eye, where the strongest one's survive.
It's do, - or die. You just;
Walk straight ahead and you don't look back.
Don't look back.

Hey, Mr. Soft, cut the crap.
Take your stand, let no-one
walk over you.

A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do...
and that's a lesson to learn.
Don't make the wrong turn.
Stand tall and don't give in.
Don't give in.

You! Watcha wanna be?
What's your ambition - tell me.
Do you feel you're left behind?
Or, is it only in your mind?
Your eyes are open, and yet;
You cannot see.
Your feet were made for walkin'
get up from your knees.
Remember this friend, for it's
a golden rule;
"Time waits for no-one...
and nothing comes for free...

Hey, whatcha wanna be?
Tell me.
To be, or not to be! raddad!
well that's the question.
