Stop at nothing, and always play for keeps.
Never settle for the second-best.
Never play it cheap.

Paradox; If you hide your feelings
Just to be; Nobody's fool
You'll learn; that the master kicks the mule
Stargazer, your castle's gonna fall.
You'll be left with nothing at all.

Daydreamer! What do ya' do ?
When your dreams turn on you.

Stick to basics, don't
fiddle about
Make your move the minute you're able,
let nothing knock you out.

Paradox; If you wait and wonder
Just to be; Sure you ain't misled
You'll learn; the others are way-ahead
Tail-chaser, always the last in line,
dragging way-behind.

Hey, stranger! What ya' say ?
Ain't it time for you to realize
that there ain't no easy-way.

No easy-way
Take my advice, you must try to hold-on.
Don't close your eyes, keep your feet on the ground

Don't stop at anything always
play for keeps.
Don't settle down for the second best
That's just playin'-it cheap.

Paradox; If you hide your feelings
Just to be; Nobody's fool
You'll learn; that the master kicks the mule
Tail chaser, you're the last in line,
draggling way-behind

Hey, stranger! What ya' say ?
Ain't it time for you to realize
that there ain't no easy-way.
