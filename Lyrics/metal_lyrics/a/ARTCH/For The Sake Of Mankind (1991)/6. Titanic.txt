Skies were clear that April-night.
The mighty ship on her "virgin-voyage".
Shining like a "silver-sun".
Queen of the seas, sailing-on

Hold the course, the captain
gave his command.
"Full-speed ahead", this is...

The great "Titanic" - yeah
Flags raised-high...
if only they had known.
The great "Titanic" - yeah,
'Cross the Atlantic,
cruising on and on - yeah.

She sailed with speed
in glory and with grace.
Titanic
Queen of the seas...
(Titanic-down, down)

A "fort of steel" - unsinkable
Built to survive, she sailed to glory.
At the iceberg, like a knife..
cut her open to end her story

"Abandon-ship", I hear the captain cry.
"We're going down, let's man the life-boats".
"Save the woman and children first".
"Send out the message"...S.O.S.
(Titanic-down, down)
