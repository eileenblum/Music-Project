Should I care if tomorrow comes,
care about my brother ?
Give a nickel to some charity,
should I even bother ?

The earth rotates continually, so cold and systematic,
somewhere inside a Universe grown huge beyond belief
But down here we're narrow-minded, there's trouble 'n pain.
Cause one man's loss, is another man's gain.

Do you identify a friend,
when he needs a helpin' hand ?

Take a good look around you, tell me what you see.
Are things the way they really ought to be ?
See the "bourgeois" staring daggers at the beggar in the street,
while praising the "good-lord" for all his gifts

For the sake of Mankind
we must show we're able...
To turn the tables.

For the sake of Mankind
we must show we're able...
To turn the tables.
There's a price to be paid
Expect...
Through the ages ever since the dawn of Man,
we've learned how to survive - the hard way.
Time, the great-healer, has taught us well;
We've turned 'gainst mother-nature..turned
Heaven into hell. Will we live to tell...?

No - mercy! Expect, no - mercy!
No - mercy!
