Let my statement be clear.
Dear Mr. Editor, don't hang-up,
lend me your ear.
I'm just a common working-man,
doin' the best that I can.
But to whom it may concern;
I've just about had enough

My neighbor looks set in his fancy "Corvette",
with the "stereo"-loud screams
While I ride the subway from Monday to Friday,
mingling with the crowd.
They say that crime does not pay.
But-"hell", I'm changing my way.
To whom it may concern;
I'm tired of trying to make an honest-living.

"To whom it may concern"
I only say; "Let justice be done"

Dear Mr. Editor, this may sound familiar,
but I've paid my dues,
to the society, with pride and in piety.
But, what's the use ?
Tell me, what have I earned ?
I get nothing in return.

To whom it may concern;
I'm tired of trying'...I've had enough.
