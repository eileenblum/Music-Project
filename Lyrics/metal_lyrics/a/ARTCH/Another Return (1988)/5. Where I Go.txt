In the dark I hear the storm
The fire keeps us warm
I reach out to touch your face
To feel the warmth of your embrace

Tomorrow I'll be back on the road
I'll miss you - no matter where I go

I've traveled far, high 'n low
Like a river that falls to the sea
In search for something - to feel free
But in the end I always take
The road that will lead me to you
I hope you'll be there - waiting too

Don't know when I'll miss you - where I go
Baby, I can't get enough, ohh I've got to
Let you know - You'll always be where I go

When I'm alone far from home
I feel like I'm a prisoner - damned for all times
I sing my song for you alone
there's nobody else that'll do ...
Well, I guess I'm a slave for ...
Loving you

Tomorrow I'll be back on the road
I hope you will follow - where I go -
