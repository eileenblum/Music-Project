I feel a tremendous power affecting my body and soul
It is the power rock'n roll
It's in my veins, my blood's on fire
It's able to satisfy all my desires

[CHORUS]

Come take my hand, come to the promised land
Don't hesitate tomorrow it might be too late
Just too late

Angels in leather, all come together
Somebody's calling my name
I'll be your savior in the rain
You can be proud 'cause our music's loud
Amps are on fire, all my desires fulfilled

[CHORUS]

Now I know how it feels
When steal, meets steal!
Take me higher, higher, higher ...
Make me fly!

Maybe, this mission, will never come to an end
And maybe, my liberation is a gift from the.....
...promised land
