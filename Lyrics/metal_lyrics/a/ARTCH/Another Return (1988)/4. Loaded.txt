Sunset in the cemetery
The dimming of the day
Headstones licked the falling rain
That was when the magician say
Coming is the hour of the magical power

When the beast will rise again
It's in my hands to rule and command
In my hands - yeah ...

I see your hands, they shiver
I sense your trembling skin
Each one of you, when the dark surrounds you
Your eyes reveal all your sins, your secret sins

Coming is the hour of the magical power
When the beast will eat your heart
That's just the start, the beginning of the end
'Cause I'm loaded - power-loaded
Yes, I'm loaded - power-loaded
