Do you believe in life after death
Is there heaven, is there hell
Or do we die as we take our last breath
Buried by the sound of the bell
I do believe in immortality, reincarnations of our souls
We travel through eternity, there is no beginning - no end

Reincarnation - there is no end - Reincarnation

We have a treasure, a written history
Wisdom and knowledge from the past
We've been enslaved, been set free
Stormed through the ages with a blast
In times of good, in times for bad
We've sought for comfort in belief
We must believe that what we've had
Is the key to the goals we achieve

Reincarnation - there is no end - Reincarnation

For you young , ... for you old
This I must make known
All the prophets have foretold
Reincarnation of our souls.
