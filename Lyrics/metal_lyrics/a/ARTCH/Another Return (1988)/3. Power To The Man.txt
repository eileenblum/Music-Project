Living with women is a bad deal.
When you want to
Make love they turn the other way, -. (sayin')
"Sorry babe, that's just the way I feel".
Women's liberation is the hit today
No more "dirty-writing" - so they say ...
They tell you when to hit the sack, turn off
The damned TV. - But not me ... NO!

Hey, what's that you're sayin' babe
Ooh, you better watch your mouth
No, I'm not gonna take it. No more!
I say: POWER TO THE MAN!

They're closing down the sex-shops,
they're closing down the bars.
Moonlight-romance under shining stars
No more "backseat-heaven" in my car.
You women want to see us men down on our knees
Beggin' you ... baby please!!!
Before too long you'll have us all floating with
The breeze, - but not me ... NO!

Oh, stop your fuzzin' ladies, ' cause I want love
I'm hot gonna take it - no more - I say:
POWER TO THE MAN!
POWER!! POWER - TO THE MAN!

They're closing down the sex-shops,
they're closing down the bars.
Moonlight-romance under shining stars
No more "backseat-heaven" in my car.
Sex and booze and rock'n roll is buried in the past
Will this tyranny forever last?
Ohh, we're rollin' much too fast -
but not me ... NO!

Oh, stop your sobbing ladies
'Cause we want love ...
We're not gonna take it. No more!
We say: POWER TO THE MAN!
