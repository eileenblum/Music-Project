Tasting the "black-life" deep in the night
Remembering the sun with no delight
Forcing your brain, killing your soul
23-hours with rock 'n roll

[CHORUS]

Nowhere to hide or get away
Loving the life, it makes you stay
You must be ready for the fight
We'll bring you Metal-life tonight ...

So let me be ME, I'll fill up your dreams
Age is no limit, time isn't real
I'm spending my money, spending my time
The metal will rage, so let's do the crime

[CHORUS]

When we are gone haunting with the hordes
The spirit of hunger will bring you the force
We must keep on living even in death
Now you are warriors you can't have no rest

[CHORUS]
