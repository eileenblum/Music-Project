Through the smoke, through the fire
Is the heat and the rain
The soldiers ran for cover. Down the drain.
Ambush on the left, Battle-roars on their right

The moon was bright in the dead of the night
Looking' down at their final fight ...
"Open fire! - Shoot to kill!"
At sunrise the fires died the bloodshed was over
Young Jim lay dead - shot in the head
His eyes looking nowhere
A small-town-hero, at 18 a zero ...
no turnin' back
Never had the will to shoot to kill
Dead on the first attack
"Open fire! - Shoot to kill!"

RULE 1: "Shoot first, then ask questions!
RULE 2: "The winner hails!
RULE 3: Remember, Total destruction!
RULE 4: "Dead men tell no tales!

You man of war! Well you live to see tomorrow!
Be wiser than your father was
Don't fall as a hero
DIE! If you want to but man you can count me out
'Cause I've been there before ...
It's a cold - bloody war
And I know what's it all about ...
"Open fire! - Shoot to kill!"
- Dead men tales no tales -

"Shoot to kill" ... - You're all gonna die!
