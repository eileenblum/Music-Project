I plan to wait through, I anticipate your touch, and your love.
What should I do with the time I have away from your touch and on the road when all I want to do is stare in your beautiful eyes?
Now listen, this is my one month promise.
Being tired never felt this good, and falling in love never felt so real.
Rise and shine, I give thanks for what we have.
I hold all pride, in my commitment to you.
Time ends when I'm with you, a moment without you feels like years.
Everyday I wake up, and every night in bed, all I do is think about how you mean the world to me.
I promise I'll do what you ask me to.
I count down the days until you leave, come home soon and safely.
And as for now here is a kiss and my word to be true to you.
This is my one month promise to you.
What should I do with the time I have away from your touch and on the road when all I want to do is stare in your beautiful eyes?
