Consider that...
Everything is biased in our eyes.
Our creations and logic are a veiled disguise.
I want you to see everything I have seen, but perspective dies as it exits our being.
Our deepest thoughts and our visions they all die, as we force them out and into a language of lies.
The song you now hear is nothing more than one I sing, a dream is just a dream, we can't see past what we've seen.
