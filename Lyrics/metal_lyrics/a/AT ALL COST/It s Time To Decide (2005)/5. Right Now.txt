Well it's been a long time coming, and I will not let this keep us down.
We will not stand by and have you make moves for us.
The time has come to hear us out, and I'll scream until your ears bleed.
Now, right now, this is our time, our time to rise, come on let's go.
Now, right now, don't let it slide, the time to decide is now.
"play" that's what I hear them saying, but it's more than fun and games, my will, I won.
It's time to take action let's unite this faction now and "race to what dreams are made of" but lap one has just begun,
And I swear I'm not the only one.
Now, right now, don't let it slide, the time to decide is now.
Can you hear me?
Right now I'm talking to you, we get a big kick back for the blood of our youth.
Can you hear me?
Right now I'm talking to you, we get new policies in place of the truth.
If I cannot break free, how will they remember me? (can you leave or can you love?) you cannot say we owe you or this industry.
Leave the starving wage slaves scraps that you don't eat.
This is what I live, this is what I love, this is what I breathe.
Revolutions come to claim the industry.
You can't bank g's, you can't break dreams, you can't break me.
Three years of playing shows, the record died.
Learn and grow from mistakes, all DIY, promise the world to us and then, take your contract, take it all back, this is our time.
Suffocate bureaucracy, and let them rot.
