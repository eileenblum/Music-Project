My words are divine as yours.
I will break your fucking neck and blow your fucking mind now, please remain calm this bomb will soon detonate.
It leaves you with room to think and some sense of know how, for you to see your wrongs cast in a new light.
Fuck your perspective I say we claim that fact depends, if it's in my eye or if it's in your mind.
Have you found answers?
Are you god?
Look at me, gods are nothing, unfound perspectives, they are nothing.
My words are divine as yours.
Look in look in into their eyes, do they have masks on?
And do they have what you and I would agree?
Can you see outside your mind or can you see at all?
Can't you see that bias blinds all of the time?
Fuck your perspective I say we claim, that fact depends if it's in my eye or if it's in your mind.
Have you found answers?
Are you god?
Look at me, gods are nothing, unfound perspectives, they are nothing.
Demise mind, despise mind.
The time to move is now because it's our time to move you.
(Do they have masks on?).
Now, it's our time, to move you, it's our time, to move you.
Nothing.
Words become nothing, hot wisdom tears into your skull and tears out rationale.
The key to life is to just let things by, what's in for us if we can't reconcile?
You are a human now, you require order no more, you require truth no more.
The key to life is to just let things by, what's in for us if we can't reconcile?
Who what when where why?
We are the ones who die.
