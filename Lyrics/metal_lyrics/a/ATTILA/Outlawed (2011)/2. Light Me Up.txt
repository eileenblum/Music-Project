Don't take offense to this, just another song for me to spill on your conscience.
So take it in, it is what it is, SO ACCEPT IT!

I've been away for 30 hours,
I need a blowjob and a shower.
This is irrelevant, I know, DON'T TEST ME!
Things come at you when you need them,
I never ask any questions.
If you want less, you'll end up with MORE, WHORES ON THEIR KNEES!

We're goin' out tonight,
Everything'll be alright,
You're fine with me,
I'm the craziest fish in the sea!
We're going out tonight,
everything'll be alright,
You're fine with me,
I'm crazy!

There are many things I used to wish I could become,
And now I'm the life of the party!

Sometimes I wish I could rewrite all the laws,
But on a second thought that wouldn't be good at all.
THIS WORLD WOULD END!
SO LIGHT ME UP FOR THE WIN!

Every motha-licka make it sicka take a picture, gonna elevate the party like you know I was meant to do ALL ALONG!

YEAH!
You're fine with me,
I'm the craziest fish in the sea!
We're going out tonight,
Everything will be alright,
You're fine with me,
I'm crazy!

I hope we get a parental advisory sticker on this album, I don't care! It's all good, I'm crazy!

I've been away for 30 hours,
I need a blowjob and a shower,
This is irrelevant, I know, DON'T TEST ME!
Things come at you when you need them,
I never ask any questions,
If you want less, you'll end up with MORE, WHORES ON THEIR KNEES!

Don't take offense to this, isn't worth it, it's just another song so SING ALONG WITH ME!
No offense, it's just another song, lighten your attitude, yeah I'm probably mad at you, when you're struttin' around, I'm gonna be hopin' you fall, until then you will realize you have no friends at all!
