So much ass in the building, such little time to decide what's right.
Someone help me out!
I want a fat ass to sit in my lap right now!
DAMN!

I like my girls like my coffee, yeah!
Cream and sugar and a big round ass!
Hell yeah!
Let's hit the dance floor, gotta check out these circumstances.
And it's looking good for me, I can't complain.
Oh yeah!
Everyone is gettin' laid tonight.
Take it easy, play it smooth and just don't fight.
Always searching for that missing void!

So for all of my life, I've been a simple kind of guy,
Just try'na make it through life and not overlook another dime,
I will swallow my pride and promise to only tell the truth,
But every man can get down on a fat ass!
YEAH! The people have spoken and the word got out,
We're partying downtown!
Call up a cab, and get your ass here stat, the liquor is flowin' hard!
Always searching for that missing void!
All the ladies in the building, I wanna hear you scream before the end of the night!

All my ladies!
Put your hands in the air and then you,
DROP THAT ASS TO THE FLOOR, you know it's good!
Gotta shake them hips, and then you,
DROP THAT ASS TO THE FLOOR, you know it's good!
LADIES! You do it just right!
DROP THAT ASS TO THE FLOOR, you know it's good!
We do it all night!
DROP THAT ASS TO THE FLOOR, you know it's good!

So much ass in the building, such little time to decide what's right.
Someone help me out!
I want a fat ass to sit in my lap right now!

OH! LET'S GO!
Step your game up, everybody here knows we always come to party!
If you don't get down, get the fuck away, we don't feel sorry!

BREATHE!
You have to let it loose,
GET DOWN!
I love the way you move!
GO!

Don't play games, I'm never gonna give in!
Party 'til the sunrise, yeah you know we win big!
DAMN!
