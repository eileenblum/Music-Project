Save your breath for the better things. tell it to someone who cares. I
Didn't pay money to hear you complain. I just came to get my buzz on. I
Just wanna party all night. so who will join me at the nearest bar? I
Don't believe any lyrics people seem to write these days. they're singing
Just to make that paycheck. their cause is fake. their cause is fake.
Their cause is fake I don't believe it. so grab a blunt and come on. yeah
Yeah yeah I didn't say I wanna party for nothing. so where the party at?
Holer at ya boy! its just another day in the life. I never question
Where I've been or where I came from. I just came to get down . sipping a
Cup of crown with two blunts in my back pocket. yeah. so come with me.
Did you know good times is my middle name? so lets spark a blunt and
Get a round of shots. now you can see that we get down. that's whats up.
Were are caught up in a world of sin. so will you sink. or will you
Swim. that is the question my friend. this world is tough and its a
Fight to the top I think were already there get up. or get out. you
Will never make it here. holler at ya boy. let me see you move.
