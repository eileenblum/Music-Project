Number and if we all stick together we can take over the world we are
The missing pieces and were the only ones who can determine our fate.

Dollar I never relied on luck. and when the day is finally here and
Everything is said and done. ill put my middle fingers up cause I proved
Everybody wrong. we bring the motherfucking heat. yeah! we bring the
