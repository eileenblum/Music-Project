Turn this shit up loud and bang your head donât be a fucking bitch

Yeah.. it's 2014 and everyone around you is a critic and a life judge
You want to be accepted and have tons of fake friends and win a gold medal because you are fucking awesome
You talk shit on the internet because youâre a bad-ass and nobody can touch you
You wanna break the rules and eat pizza skip school, fuck yeah thatâs the goddamn truth

Hereâs a fucking solo for all you dumb elitist cunts this shit is bad-ass as fuck and youâll probably try to play it and fail
But thatâs okay because youâre fucking awesome
You live in a basement and talk shit on our YouTube
Yeah life is motherfucking awesome, thank you for buying this CD I want to kiss your fucking lips, put money in your tits and watch you dance with pure joy because this is the best song youâve ever heard

Holy shit, you guys should go back to your old sound
Your new shit fucking sucks I liked you guys before you got big
Your band ruined fucking metal core and your lyrics are gay
I hate you so much but I still pay attention to every word you say

10 years later and weâre still a fucking band, if youâve ever been a hater Iâm your number one fan

Think about the shit thatâs always coming out your dirty mouth 
Five wild motherfuckers straight up out the dirty south
Talk is cheap as fuck and everybody knows your words are shit
We will never give a fuck so what
Take it to the basics and erase the fact we made it
Weâre just partying and traveling and youâre a fucking hater
Welcome to the party fuck bitches see you later
