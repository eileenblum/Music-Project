I donât give a fuck about my bad reputation

Never catch me slipping, red cup solo sipping out the whip with yo bitches
Donât give a FUCK about opinions, that donât pay the bills
Iâm just keepinâ it real
When youâre out on the town I hope youâre thinking of me
Sipping liquor out the bottle and smoking up on that tree
The moral of the story is- I just want you to see
That the opinions of others should never bother you or me

Get fucked, you wonder why nobody likes you but you hate on everything and have a negative outlook
Fuck that, Iâm the product of your creation all your hate and negativity made me stronger
Hell yeah, nobody does it like we do it, having this much fun should be illegal
Whoa, weâre taking over this bitch, join or die up in this bitch, straight villain till the death of me

HATE ME
Keep my name in your mouth Iâll keep my dick in your mother while youâre staring at each other
HATE ME
You keep on paying my bills, Iâm living just for the thrills, you keep on poppinâ your pills

OH
Livin' it up is just an understatement yeah were living large what what motherfuck a slut
So fuck whatever you heard

Never catch me slipping, red cup solo sipping out the whip with yo bitches
Donât give a FUCK about opinions, that donât pay the bills
Iâm just keepinâ it real
When youâre out on the town I hope youâre thinking of me
Sipping liquor out the bottle and smoking up on that tree
The moral of the story is- I just want you to see
That the opinions of others should never bother you or me

Hate me
Keep my name in your mouth Iâll keep my dick in your mother while youâre staring at each other
HATE ME
You keep on paying my bills, Iâm living just for the thrills, you keep on poppinâ your pills

Youâll never understand
That all your negativity wonât get you shit
Youâre so blind and stupid
Just keep on doing you and I wonât give a fuck

I donât give a fuck about my bad reputation

Hate me
Keep my name in your mouth Iâll keep my dick in your mother while youâre staring at each other
HATE ME
You keep on paying my bills, Iâm living just for the thrills, you keep on poppinâ your pills
