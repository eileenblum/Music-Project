Letâs take it back and reminisce on the days you doubted on me 
I looked straight back into your eyes and I said
FUCK YOU
You wanted control over my life and all the decisions I made
I did whatever the fuck I wanted do you see where I am at

No one controls your life
You do shit on your own
If youâve got ambitions then youâre better off alone
Acquaintances donât matter, teachers donât fucking matter, no oneâs opinions matter, FUCK YOU
Youâre gonna change your mind
But you canât change my life

I wasnât born and raised a bitch
But you were born to suck my dick
Oh this is the time where wrongs become right
Youâve got to stand up for yourself and fight
Youâll never know if it works so just try
Youâre gonna change your mind
But you canât change my life

I wasnât born and raised a bitch
But you were born to suck my dick
Hey
Disobey
Violate
Disregard the rules
Hey
Letâs escape
Run away
Fuck your church and school
