Nobody can bring me down

Iâve been waiting for this moment my ambitions turned into an opportunity to prove you wrong
So when you're contemplating in your mind another way to hold me back you know that wonât get you far
Iâve worked too damn hard Iâve come too damn far way past the point of no return
Iâll never take your shit, you can talk more shit stick it right up in your ass and JUMP

We are the kids with unstoppable minds
You canât fuck with the best of best

If you hear me right now do whatever the fuck you want
Living in the moment, never question yourself
And if youâre subject to conformity you're living in hell
Make your own fucking choices even if they say no
And if a bitch tying you down then you should let that shit go
Yeah, even if you hate me you should let it be known
That I'm a free motherfucker you can never impose
I do whatever I want, I get whatever I need
And if you got a fuckin' problem you can swallow my seed
UH

Ambition Abolition

You will not stop me. Or break me. Not even in your wildest dreams.

Everybody put your hands up open up your ears and listen

When does it matter when everything is just chatter
I hear them talking with their mouth shut as if it really matters but when you think about it jealousy and overreacting I'm just livin' inside a moment you just shit talk and scatter (so just get on your feet and fuckin' jump)

The only one who can bring you down is yourself.
Youâre your own worst enemy.

The secrets out so let it be known, rely on no one but yourself and do this shit on your own

THE WORLD CAN SUCK MY DICK

But youâre still trapped inside your mind, time to escape time to escape

No one holds you back you've only got yourself to blame and when you take over the world you better remember my name
This is your ticket to a greater worth and nothing is the same if you just believe in yourself you put your enemies to shame

You've got to make them regret every fucking thing they said every fucking thing they said
