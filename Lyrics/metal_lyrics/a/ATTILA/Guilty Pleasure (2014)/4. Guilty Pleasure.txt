All these motherfuckers wanna be like me
Iâm having a grand ole fucking time so come and get you a piece
You wanna try me motherfucker yeah-well nothings for free
You gotta pay the fucking price determinations the fee
Yeah all these newcomers try to copy my shit
Iâm telling âem fuck it fuck it suck it youâre just not that legit
You cannot hang motherfucker so just stick to your niche
Youâll never do it like I do cause youâre a boohoo ass bitch

Iâm going crazy, and circumstance is to blame, between these sleepless nights, working all goddamn day AW SHIT
Success has come with a price so when youâre contemplating fame you should take my advice
LISTEN- Youâve gotta be yourself, youâve got to break the mold, personalities are valuable
Every single day and every single night, jealous people will try to bring you down

Balls to the wall if youâre a real OG
Hold it down go hard always stay bitch-free
Never let a motherfucker try to get in the way
And if they ever try to stop you slap âem in the face

All these motherfuckers wanna be like me
Iâm having a grand ole fucking time so come and get you a piece
You wanna try me motherfucker yeah-well nothings for free
You gotta pay the fucking price determinations the fee
Yeah all these newcomers try to copy my shit
Iâm telling âem fuck it fuck it suck it youâre just not that legit
You cannot hang motherfucker so just stick to your niche
Youâll never do it like I do cause youâre a boohoo ass bitch

So mentally violent, this is a game you cannot win you couldnât handle all the shit I see and hear
So fucking go
Fucking assholes and undeserving cunts
Riding on a cloud of luck until that luck runs out 
FUCK
[Rap part]
LET ME SEE YOU PUT IT DOWN
Hard work and dedication thatâs what makes an OG
Get the fuck outta the game if you thought this shit was free
I got your bitch in front of me and she be sucking this D 
I give her an extra point she calls me lord referee
Banging down south but I canât guarantee
That Iâll meet you in my city, but Iâll hit you with the weed
Racks in the back seat, hoes on their knees
Saying Iâm their guilty pleasure but their boyfriend hates me

All these motherfuckers wanna be like me
Iâm having a grand ole fucking time so come and get you a piece
You wanna try me motherfucker yeah-well nothings for free
You gotta pay the fucking price determinations the fee
Yeah all these newcomers try to copy my shit
Iâm telling âem fuck it fuck it suck it youâre just not that legit
You cannot hang motherfucker so just stick to your niche
Youâll never do it like I do cause youâre a boohoo ass bitch
