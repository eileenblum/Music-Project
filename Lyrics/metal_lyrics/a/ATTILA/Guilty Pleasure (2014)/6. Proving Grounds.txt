Take your opinion and stick it right up in your motherfucking ass

Set the stage weâre in a world where opinions mean nothing,
youâve got to prove your worth

Let me hear you say HEY
Fuck everything they SAY
Iâll live another DAY
And if they doubt you, tell âem to suck it
and hold it down on the proving grounds
HEY
Fuck everything they SAY
Iâll live another DAY
And if they doubt you, tell âem to suck it
and hold it down on the proving grounds

Iâve always done what I wanted,
I never had a reason
I just set out with middle fingers up
fuck everything and anyone who tried to stop me
Thereâs one thing you should know- To never give a fuck.
When people try to stop you, you should prove them wrong.

Let me see what youâre made of,
you little piece of shit

THIS IS THE PROVING GROUNDS
Bring it on let me see it
SO WHOâS THE FAGGOT NOW
We have to prove them wrong

THIS IS THE PROVING GROUNDS
SO WHO'S THE FAGGOT NOW

Let me hear you say HEY
Fuck everything they SAY
Iâll live another DAY
And if they doubt you, tell âem to suck it
and hold it down on the proving grounds
HEY
Fuck everything they SAY
Iâll live another DAY
And if they doubt you, tell âem to suck it
and hold it down on the proving grounds

HEY
HEY
HEY
And if they doubt you, tell âem to suck it
and hold it down on the proving grounds

HEY
HEY
HEY
And if they doubt you, tell âem to suck it
and hold it down on the proving grounds

You gotta problem with me keeping it real,
well here we go

Fuck your shit
Always gotta have opinions you can suck my dick
Always gotta have the last word such a little shit
Always gotta try to hide it but I fucked your bitch
Doesnât matter what the press says I wonât quit
Doesnât matter what the feds say smoke my shit
When Iâm rolling pass the 5-0 I stay lit
If you feel like youâre a victim, rape this pit

Take a hit of this SHIT
Let the moment set in always open ears and listen
Everybody can suck my fuck
Doesnât matter what you think
Iâm here to prove you wrong
hit the back button repeat this song
