Yeahhhhhh here we motherfucking go
Fuck that
We raise hell
I'll tear your soul apart
Fuck pigs
We raise hell

Lawless among the pack
 We never listen
And we live our lives above the law
We're fucking villains!!!
Fuck everything you say
I'm here to smash shit
Straight from the depths of hell
If you can't hang then fucking quit

(We raise hell)

Always Disorderly
Rebels with no defeat
Fuck with our team if you dare
Fuck all authority
Rep the minority
I've had enough of your shit to last me my lifetime
I stay out of line
I can't be put down this time
Try me if you dare
I don't even fucking care

Fuck that
We raise hell
I'll tear your soul apart
Fuck pigs
We raise hell

I'm badass and you're a fucking bitch

Rock &amp; roll was invented for the wicked
Leave your bibles at home under the bed
We're the villains and we came to raise hell
Listen to the fucking words I said
Hellraiser
