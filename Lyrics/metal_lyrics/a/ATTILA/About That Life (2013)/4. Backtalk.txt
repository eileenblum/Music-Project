What if all your secret shit-talk wasn't as quiet as you once thought,

I can hear your voice through the grapevine,
secrets donât exist not in my time,
always talking shit but you canât hide,
running your mouth like a bitch,

I can hear your voice through the grapevine, secrets
donât exist not in my time,
always talking shit but you canât hide,
running your mouth like a bitch.

backtalk getting the best of you,
bitch weâre gonna fuck you up,
cowards trying to hide their face,
but I think youâre out of luck today,

you better hope I never find you,
now letâs see who's the bigger asshole,

if I find you I will kill you,
back and forth again,

youâre always on to something,
this shit has to end,
too bad your life means nothing,
back and forth again,
youâre always on to something,
this shit has to end,
too bad your life sucks too bad your life sucks.

Everybody hates you,
youâre just another fucking bitch,

your ass is jealous of the shit
that comes out of your mouth,

it would only make more sense you fucking ugly faggot
