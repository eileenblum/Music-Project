Disregard authority
Fuck the law
I've been to every fucking city
And I've seen it all
If you got a fuckin' problem
Let the whole world know
Break every fuckin' thing
That you see at this show

This is not a request
It's an order
Are you fuckin listening
Attention defict disorder?
Close your eyes
Close your fists
And imagine that your enemy's in front of you
Now what would happen?

Break shit
Fuck the law
Fuck this shit
Punch that bitch
Break shit
Fuck the law
Fuck it

Punch a fuckin' bully
In the god damn face
Or just hit 'em with a brick
Or two just in case
They decide they want to fuck with you
And do it all again
You put the madness to an end

Take a deep breath
And hold it in
Break down these walls around you
Release your inner demons
And show me what the fuck you got

Total extermination
Fuck everybody
Wreck this place
Fuck it
I've got an anger problem
This is how it gets fixed

If you got a fuckin' problem
Let the whole world know
Break every fuckin' thing
That you see at this show

Break shit
Fuck the law
Fuck it
Break shit
fuck the law
Fuck this shit
Punch that bitch
Break shit
Fuck the law
Fuck it

Take a deep breath
And hold it in
Break down these walls around you
Release your inner demons
Spread your evil throughout the room

Take a deep breath
And hold it in
Break down these walls around you
Release your inner demons
And show me what the fuck you've got

They're always trying hard
Just to push you down
But when its all said and done
You're gonna run this town
You hurt their pride in front of everyone
So finish the job
You poured the gasoline
So set it off

You smash their fuckin' face
And watch them suffer
Just like they did to you
But make it worse
Retaliation is a must
They caused an issue
Violence will solve it all this time
Throw the fuckin' match
And watch the motherfucker Burn

BURN!
