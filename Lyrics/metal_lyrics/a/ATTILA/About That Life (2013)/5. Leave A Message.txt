[Phone beeps]

[Phone ringing]

"Yo, it's Fronz I'm busy as fuck, leave a message or somethin."

"Fronz it's Mike, you need to answer the phone
You've been ignoring my phone calls ever since you sent me these tracks
You said you were gunna mellow out on this record
And all you're doing is getting more offensive
I cant fucking believe it dude
I'm gunna lose my distributors and backing
All you care about is ruining peoples lives and fucking partying
Thats all you ever talk about
CALL ME NOW!"
