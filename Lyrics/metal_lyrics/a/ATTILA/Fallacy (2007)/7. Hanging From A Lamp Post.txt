You're up to something, something up to no good
You've made the wrong choice
You won't recover from this one
The report just came in
And things aren't looking too good
You can't forget your fears and your fears won't forget you!
We're coming from the ashes!
To remind you of your jaded past
You won't like your punishment....
HANGING FROM A LAMP POST
METAL BAT TO THE FACE
NEEDLES UNDER YOUR NAILS
CHOKING ON YOUR ENTRAILS
Should have learned from your mistakes
Too bad we never gave you the chance
Don't fuck with us
