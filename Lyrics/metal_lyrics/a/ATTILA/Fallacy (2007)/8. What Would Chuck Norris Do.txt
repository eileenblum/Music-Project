Discoordination will make the last of you
Your bad reputation will follow every thing you do
What would Chuck Norris do?
A swift kick to the face should put you through
The world is spinning
The world is spinning round and round
My life's a movie with a never ending plot
And you will see
What you've done to me!
And you will see
What you've done to me!
So just open your eyes
YOU'RE NOT COMING HOME!
YOU ASS HAS SEEN BETTER DAYS!
