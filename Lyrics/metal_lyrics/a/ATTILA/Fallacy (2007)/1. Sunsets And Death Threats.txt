Riding through the city leaving worries behind.

How can you be insightful when you don't use your mind?

You're trying so hard
to stay ahead of the pack.
We're living for the moment and we're never turning back.

Your words spill forth,
they hold no value,
quit while you are ahead,
it's your best choice.
Your path of destruction will be cut short.

It's affection that you savor,
and we'll return the favor.
Your path of destruction will be cut short.
It's affection that you savor,
and we'll return the favor.

Suffer one last time.
Your soul is mine.
Suffer one last time.
Your soul is mine.
Suffer one last time.
Your soul is mine.

One one one two two three four let's go!

You're in denial, another drop of poison in this vial.
You're in denial, another drop of poison in this vial.

Your path of destruction will be cut short.
It's affection that you savor,
and we'll return the favor.

Suffer one last time.
Your soul is mine.
Suffer one last time.
Your soul is mine.

Let's push the limits.
Who cares?!
Slipping past your conscience
