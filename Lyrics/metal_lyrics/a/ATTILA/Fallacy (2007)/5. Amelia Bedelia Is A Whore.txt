If I'm down, I'll get back up
Your drama really sucks
All I did couldn't please that robot
She was programmed for horny self-denial
THIS IS FOR THE BOYS AND GIRLS
FUCK THE DRAMA!
Once more-so it's stuck in your head
Once more-so it's stuck in your head
Fuck the drama, fuck the drama
Get out of my house
Take all your shit
You aren't wanted here
When you look back, on this life
Will you be proud, of all you've done?
It's time like these
When shit turns to shit
So cover your face
And spit in the pit
