And we all know their cause
Delayed our freedom
Lets make our own fucking decisions!
NO ONE WILL RETURN!
You'll die alone
Throw away your fears- the won't help you now
Failure wasn't all it was hyped up to be
Now it's here to haunt you and me
Success is not for you
No one will pull through
Grab swords and knives
(look to the sky)
Before you die
FAILURE STARING INTO YOUR EYES
(You're blind)
Filled with deceit!
Meant for deceit!
