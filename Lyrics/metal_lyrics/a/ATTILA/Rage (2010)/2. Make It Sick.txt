Second time and Iâm back again
Back on the track, Iâm about to formulate an ultimate sadistic attack
So free your mind, hereâs a remedy for misread introductions
Itâs a shame that people have it all wrong
Make it sick, prove them wrong and do whatever it takes to have fun
Theyâll be laughing- haha ha haha, and weâll go
On on on and again, cuz our beat will never end
You canât beat it you canât stop it, stick it in your pipe and smoke it
And if you disagree, so what?
I donât give a fuck if you like this song
Is it heavy, is it heavy!?
I donât give a fuck if you like this song
Is it heavy enough for you??
Okay pull it together, weâve got business to attend to
Donât take everything so literally
A party is whatever you make it out to be
Just have fun, make it sick
Now that we got a better understanding, we can take it to another level
Can you understand where Iâm coming from?
Do these words even make any sense?
Never take shit from anyone
Do whatever it takes to have fun
Stay happy, make it sick
If you donât get it, suck a nut!
We do whatever we want, AND WE WILL NEVER GIVE A FUCK
If you like it or not!
