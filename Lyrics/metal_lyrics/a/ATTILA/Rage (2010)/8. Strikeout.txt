GO
Clear that shit, donât stop
Until the green is gone and your thumb gets hot
You gotta breathe in deep, recollect your thoughts
Because its time to take this shot

Raise your drinks, raise your lighters, its about to go down
We can sleep in the morning, wake up and burn down

This is probably the best night Iâve ever had
We can do STRIKEOUTS all through the night
But weâre not quite over yet, come over here
CHUG CHUG CHUG finish that beer!
