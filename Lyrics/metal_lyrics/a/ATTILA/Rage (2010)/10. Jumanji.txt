Weâre going away
Crazy adventures await, day after day
I donât remember her name
Oh what a shame it is, oh what a shame

Shake your ass girl, break it down and drop it low
Itâs a photo-shoot with me and my camera phone
I can keep it on the low if you want me to
But secrets are no fun

Get up, weâve got a 6 hour drive
But drivings overrated, drivings overrated
Take a hit of this and weâll fly
Fly above the highest of highs
No one can stop divine progression
Let the haters hate as theyâd like
This is not an option, get out

Shake your ass girl, break it down and drop it low
Itâs a photo-shoot with me and my camera phone
I can keep it on the low if you want me to
But secrets are no fun

Shut the fuck up
This is not the time or place to start this war
Start this war!
