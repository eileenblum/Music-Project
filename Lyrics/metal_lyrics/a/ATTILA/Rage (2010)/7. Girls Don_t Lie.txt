SIKE!
EVERYTHING THAT YOU SAY is false
Just like your actions
Fill your mouth up with a filthy waste
Breathe it in
Oh yeah, here we go
So how does it feel when the tables are turned?
Take a moment breathe it in
Get a better perception of the damages
Oh, im glad I finally got the chance to say âI got the last laugh now!â

And now we start again
Oh, weâll take this situation right back to the city that created us
I canât imagine what it meant to you
If it meant anything at all
Youâve torn and broke the boundaries and itâs a miracle that weâre even around
So consider yourself to be lucky, sit back, donât talk, take in this sound
Yeahhh
OH MY GOD, what now?
OH MY GOD, what now?

This is my final stand, I wonât take another chance with your antics
Youâve torn and broke all of the boundaries
Surprisingly it still appears as if Iâll be the one with the last laught!
OH CAN YOU FEEL THE WEIGHT PUSHING DOWN ON YOUR SHOULDERS?
Youâll forever carry the weight of our past
