Apologies for the things Iâve said
Sometimes I donât think before I speak but who does?
Especially when youâve got a lot on your mind
Iâm short-tempered so just bare with me
Just bare with me and let me speak
Iâm punching holes in these walls
My eyes are open I canât even see, my eyes are open
Iâve had too many tonight but buy some rounds
Pass them around, get on my level, its only 11 and youâre far behind!
Iâve had too many tonight but buy some rounds
Pass them around, get on my level, its only 11 and shits getting heavy
Who fucking spilled the beer on my carpet!?
Alright everybody throw your hands up
Put em in the air and if youâre not holding a red cup
You know the drill- get on your knees
Iâm sorry, Iâm sorry I canât control my anger any more

But you must understand
Iâve been away for a long long time
No one can save me cuz Iâm too far gone
Oh baby baby, you should have seen the things Iâve done
God Damn, all those nights, all those blunts, all those lights
I wouldnât trade it for the world, or anything in it
I looked rough, but Iâll admit it- yeah the girls came too
They fucked me good but girl, I swear they donât compare to you
Oh shit
I think I said too much
Oh shit
I THINK I SAID TOO MUCH
And every day is like a never-ending struggle where Iâm always fuckin falling behind
And every second is a motherfucking obstacle where everybodyâs falling behind
Fall behind

Iâve had too many tonight but buy some rounds
Somebody buy some fucking rounds!
Who fucking spilled the beer!?
