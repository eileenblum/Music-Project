Unforgiveable your life is meaningless you motherfucker, how does it feel to be alone for a lifetime.

Forced to eternal damnation and guilt in your own mind, this went on for way to long, but nobody here had the balls to confront you, youâll always get what you deserve, so sit down bitch and know that youâve been served, stay awake and reflect on this keep toss and
turninâ fuck you.

Watch me sit here and think about trying-some kind of post-life abortion, how should I execute my feelings of hatred towards you, soon enough we will both have answers, don't get excited ha, I prefer another form of torture watch your conscious suffer, let the silence
hurt your soul and I will laugh. youâre sitting here begging Iâm just like, ............, I don't give a fuck, about you, so shut up, do you fucking understand,

This went on for way to long, but nobody here had the balls to confront you, youâll always get what you deserve, so sit down bitch and know that youâve been served, stay awake and reflect on this keep toss and turninâ fuck you.
Watch me sit here and think about trying-some kind of post-life abortion, how should I execute my feelings of hatred towards you, soon enough we will both have answers, don't get excited.

Try to forget it but I left scars and they are everlasting, try to forget about it but I wonât let it leave your head and iâm afraid youâll suffer worse if I just execute as planned I leave your mind to take the hit as, punishment fir all the shit you said and all the
people that you hurt in your life

Try to forget about it but I wonât let it leave your head and iâm afraid youâll suffer worse if I just execute as planned I leave your mind to take the hit as, punishment fir all the shit you said and all the people that you hurt in your life, youâre fucked,.
