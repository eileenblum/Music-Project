Let's start the party.
I'm tired of fucking around!
Leave your drama at the door, step up or step out!
And when we get things rollin', we'll be rollin' till the break of dawn!

Tonight's the night, so throw your hands in the air and fucking bounce.

Hey, girl, I'm lookin' for a good time.
Oh shit, this is how mistakes are made!
What now?
We've gone too far to take it back.
Oh fuck, I hope you don't keep bothering me.

Embrace the feeling that overcomes us all.
Yeah, I'm not about to preach to your virgin ears.
God damn, livin' the fast life.

Yeah, that's what's up!
Now that I've had some time to think,
I know what's best for me and you.
You're nothing but a one night stand,
And we can talk in fucking hell!

Smoke a blunt!
This party's overboard,
And all these whores are fucking sick.
I'm cringing in disgust,
I need more substance.

Na na na na na na
Smoke a blunt!
What the fuck ever happened to having fun?
You playas take this shit so seriously.
One night stand, fuck this plan.
