Villian
who are you,what are you,how can you LIVE!
run like a child,try to hide from the truth,did you forget you are human,life 
wont forgive you
NEVER!
spit up a mouthful of shit you expect us to buy,its just another lie
its so clear to everyone,everyone but you
Open and shut,you can run but you cant hide
God will spit you out
Your days are numbered!
