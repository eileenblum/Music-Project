Rain! her ear to the door
the thunder is over
but this storm has just begun
and these clouds will LINGER
fears race through her mind,each second eternal
everything feels so final
all things fall into place,to be scattered again
the door swings open,she falls to the floor
all life now CHANGES

WHAT THE FUCK HAVE YOU DONE!!!
I was told I was the selfish one
I tried to model my life after yours
You've thrown it all away
I'm always a second behind you
I'm only a second behind you
did you give any thought to this

did you Think OF ME!
hello did you miss me,did you think of me when you did this to yourself....
selfishly want one more chance to hold you,kiss you,at least to say "GOODBYE"
