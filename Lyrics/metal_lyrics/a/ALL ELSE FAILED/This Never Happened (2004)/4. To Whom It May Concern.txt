I apologize, I think I have confused you
With my fure of fake tears, and my self-thrown pity parties
That hard road, does that story sound familiar ?
Such drama, such torture, so sad it must be true
I'm sorry, we have nothing in common
A thief and a liar spitting stolen words
Mock feelings of loss
Mimic feelings of emptiness
Can you relate ? Do the words hit home ?
Your life is miserable. I'm just fine
I'm sorry, we have nothing in common
Feel for the martyr faÃ§ade hook line and sinker
I fooled you again
And now it's over, your shoes don't fit me anymore.
