I'm getting on that plane, I'm leaving you behind
No, there's nothing you can say to drag me back
Not this time. Tomorrow has arrived
I may have outstayed my welcome
You're the only reason I stayed this long
You're the only reason I came in the first place
And now you're the reason I have to leave this town
You've already written me off, you won't even notice I'm gone
Why sacrifice happiness and stay here to wonder why two people can't get along ?
Some vicious words, well those words are not retractable
This ticket is my response, and it's just as irreversible
This is my final decision
I've served my time inside this prison
And this may be my only chance to run
So I will pack my things, tuck tail and run
Tomorrow my new life begins, and everything will change
And I won't look back, not for one moment
I'm getting on that plane.
