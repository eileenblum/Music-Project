There are no signs of conscience. There are no week-long waiting rooms
Another one for your collection that serves a single use
A line your grandfather wrote, a story that's been passed down
What was necessity then, is not essential now
The word control is vague at best. There is no direct path
There are no signs of remorse. Tell your riends you are the victim here
Tell us all how you just followed orders, but wasn't this all your idea ?
The word control is vague at best. Is this ink smeared or my vision blurred ?
There is no direct path, but the one we're on won't work
Just string them up
Prepare for the final stand
Who will fall tomorrow ? Millions more will follow
Prepare for the final stand. Will we have to pry them from your cold dead hands
Just string them up.
