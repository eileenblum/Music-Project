You have sold my confidence
Now my soul is broken
You just told the perfect lie. I will not recover
The perfect demon. The perfect fit
The perfect reason to deal with it
The perfect demon, a friend of mine
A stolen moment, the perfect crime
One small lie, and the world falls
Three short words, and I cannot recover.
