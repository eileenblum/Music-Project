Don't worry, things will only move up from here
ROck bottom, it can only get better
A broken man with broken heart
And broken dreams of being back on top ...
Official crowned prince of potential
When it rains it pours. Right now it's torrential
A broken man with broken heart
And broken dreams of being back on top ...
Down, but not out. Down, but it's not over
Please reconsider
Please rearrange your busy schedule of wasted time
And try to fix the mess you've made
It's not too late to turn this around
Another closing door has locked you in
A midlife crisis at twenty-seven
Don't worry, things will only move up from here
Rock bottom, it can only get better
It's not too late.
