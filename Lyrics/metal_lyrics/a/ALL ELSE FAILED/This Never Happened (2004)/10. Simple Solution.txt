A simple addition to the list of ingredients
Will be hand-delivered to the 25%
Casualties of war they're already dead to us
This is not murder just a change in the catalyst
Taint the supply to end the demand
It can be added to pesticide distribute with a crop duster
Let it rain on the fields ... fatal upon inhalation
Life is sinking down. If this is a war ... We're losing
This is running out.
