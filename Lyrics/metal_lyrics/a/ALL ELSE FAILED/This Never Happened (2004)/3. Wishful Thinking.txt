Broken glass and broken promise
Wipe that slate clean. Why not kill that too
Kill it
I've suffered your silence. I've hit a brick wall
I've taken my chances. I've taken the fall
Will you answer ? Wishful thinking
And when the answer comes I wish you would
Bite your tongue ...
Until you choke on blood
It's over, all but the crying
I promised you roses
I choked you with vines
We traveled the galaxies
We tripped all the mines
We let the days wither
We let every day pass
We fit like a puzzle
We shattered like glass. Silence.
