The fat lady's finishing. The returns are diminishing
The triumph, the tragedy : a breathing dichotomy
It all looks the same to me. Revisionist history
This hindsight is a cataract. This valentine's heart attack
The triumph, the tears. We're showing our years in history
Remember. Recall. Revise. Rewrite all my mistakes, and hope everyone else forgets
My memory selective ... and overprotective
It all looks the same now.
