For most of us, sedation is wearing off
This hole we dig is just an open grave
So self-absorbed in our own lives that it eclipses the world around us
Daily priorities ...
Work. Sleep. Eat. Breathe
We just don't know any better than to expect the worst
We just ignore
This is a learned defense
What will effect us later, right now won't make a difference
Don't try to explain, I admit it's over my head
Maybe uneducated, maybe just disinterested
We just don't know any better than to accept the worst
I'd walk this line, but I find it is far too thin
I'd share these thoughts, but it's safer to keep them in
History is being made ... We look the other way
We just don't know any better.
