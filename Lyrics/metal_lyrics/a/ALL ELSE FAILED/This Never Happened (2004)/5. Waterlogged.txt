It slips away, buoyant for now
It's drifting past, just out of your reach
Though you swim fast, something still holds you back
The current's strong, but I'm your anchor
You turn to me to cut you loose
But I just smile and hold you closer
I fit you like a pair of concrete shoes
And the water is rising
So snug it's suffocating and the dead weight drags us both under
Sinking in a sea of promise, I whisper everything's ok
Embrace me and we'll both go under
As your dreams drift away. As your dreams drift out.
