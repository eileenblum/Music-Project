Her cry bleeds my heart
there is nothing to hear
except the vulnerable music of love
o, how I want to return
to return and fall asleep under the falls of dreams

You have left my hope,
my dream and pain.
the night will pass, stars will go out

And my star will fall... Forever.

The sun will blind
the moon will see
How her children will fall
The lie will cover the sky
but one of them will stay to cry

Her cry bleeds my heart

So why we die?
Why we cry?
And love what we shouldn`t

You have left my hope,
my dream and pain.
the night will pass, stars will go out.
