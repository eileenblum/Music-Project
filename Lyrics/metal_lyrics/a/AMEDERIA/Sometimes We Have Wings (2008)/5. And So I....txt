And I am full of hatred
Thatâs why I couldnât finish up my way
And Flowers wonât grow above my grave
And ravens wonât fly above us.

I will keep living and my body eaten by worms
Will suddenly find peace
And I will run into the darkness
Waving my arms for bliss
Iâm tired, I am living

Why does our fate offend us?
Destroying our life?
A drowns our ship of happiness
And puts us into the boat of sadness

No one can understand our fate
At gives us something and something take instead
Again it sends us far away

And we are sad, our soul is suffering
A dream breaks our hearts
Fate wonât let us realize it
Even the Sun doesnât save us

Our boat is coming to the port
There the angel is awaiting us
And this our life is flying
Leaving only black ashes
