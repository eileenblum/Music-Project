Having forgotten about autumn we rush into winter and get drown in cold emptiness,
having closed the hand over the warmth of our souls..
for a moment we recall (call in mind) the scraps of lies and bitterness of loss...

and death then has taken our souls
and we have understood there is no way back...
why canât we get nor in paradise nor in hell...?
thatâs because we are the other ones 
we are ghosts, running into the darkness ...

They remember only the night and the road..
And ahead - ahead is only death....
And no, thatâs not frightening, thatâs not the end of the jorney
Thereâs no need to cry, this wonât help,

Because the tears are the moans of the soul, that will kill you soon...
But the life could be so beautiful,
Could be as sweet as taste of blood for a vampire,
But we have choosen our way ourselves, and again and again we follow the road into the night

And once again, having forgotten about autumn and winter, we get drowned into the darkness of the ages
