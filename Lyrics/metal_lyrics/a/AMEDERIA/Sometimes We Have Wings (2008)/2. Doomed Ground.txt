There, where the dreams find rest
The world, without fear and Lie
Where Will be born the moon and dies the sun
Illuminating last way...

Burning fields drain me
Spirits killed with dagger of life
Have remained in embraces of death
Without hope...

So it so cold so lonely in this world
there is the void in my cold heart
All as in dream...

Not understanding anything,
we go through the darkness
You also will not rescue neither devil not god?

You are one... All alone
Exorsited from only
On this ground
