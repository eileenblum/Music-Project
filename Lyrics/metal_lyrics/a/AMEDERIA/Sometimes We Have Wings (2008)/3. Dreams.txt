I lived in darkness of my life
And didn't see the light, joy and love...

But smth said inside my soul...just live
The world is cruel but life more terrible 

But appeared the light in the night
And it's more powerfull in me
Like butterfly burns in the flame of the night
Falls and rise again...
I went ahead and didn't watch back
Can u hear?
Do u hear my heart stops beating...?
