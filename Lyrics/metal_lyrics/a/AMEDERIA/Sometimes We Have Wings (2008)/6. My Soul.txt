My fate's skimpy
Didnât give me warm
I Want to know, want to understand 
Why should I live and suffer

How long my soul
Will walk in the other world
I donât want to search you
And recall the pain in memories

I dreamed, I flew 
And suddenly have lost my mind
No more strength to scream
On happiness pain put the seal.
