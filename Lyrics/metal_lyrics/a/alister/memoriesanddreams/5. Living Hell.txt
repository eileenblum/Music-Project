Destruction
Smell the taste of pestilence
Abhorrence
"What's the colour of your blood?"
Feel the poison in your eyes
Hear the truth crying for us
Don't get away
Don't let yourself become blind!

It's just another day with no rising sun
Fight against the chaos 'cause we're living in a living hell!

Cemetery
Is waiting for us
Pain
It's a good day to die!
But remember that you're not alone
Your past is here, your aims and wishes
Don't get away from the future
Don't let yourself become blind!
