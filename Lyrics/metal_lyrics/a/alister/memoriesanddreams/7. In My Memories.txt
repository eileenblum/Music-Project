Blackness
Dark labyrinths of my soul
Are calling me
(I hear voices)

I'm going through my memories
And my life that passed away
Ugly things are calling me
I'm going through my suffering.
There are so many ways
Each of them says: "Come to me!"
I must choose the right one
If I fail I'll be lost!

In my memories.

So many things around me
So many weaknesses
My disgusting secrets
My strongest enemies
The weaker I am
The stronger they are
They want me back, they want me
If I fail I'll be lost.

In my memories
They call for me
And they want me back
In my memories!
