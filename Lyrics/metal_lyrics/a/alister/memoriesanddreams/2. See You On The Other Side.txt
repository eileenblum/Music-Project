Individual thoughts, Symbolic arts
Let the Metal flow, Let the spirit fly,
This anger in my voice, This rhythm in my heart
The only way to live, The only way to die!

See you on the Crystal Mountain,
See you on the other side!

This sound of perseverance Will crush the chains of time
But we must stand together, Together as one!
See through your dreams, Sail across the cosmic sea
My name is on your lips, My Music is eternity!

Trapped in a corner of universe,
One man and his Guitar,
He is the Godfather of Metal,
See you on the other side!
