I travelled across the sea
With my sisters, my shining stars
Dark depths were calling me
And they try to pull me under
I was looking for my mirror
Fighting against my fears,
Against my weaknesses
Which were trying to take my soul!

"And when I look long into the abyss
The abyss also looks into me."

I travelled across the desert
With my brothers, grains of sand
The cold sun was calling me
Wanting from me to be it's slave
I became blind, so blind
And the sun was in my head
I fought against myself
And I left my mirror in the sand

"Whoever fights monsters
Should see to it that
In the process he does not
Become a monster.
And when you look long
Into the abyss
The abyss also
Looks into you."
