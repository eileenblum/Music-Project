[Obscurity bonus]

Sunset
Night is coming nearer
Black clouds over your head
Here comes the black hero!
Moonlight
Darkness brings the fear
Your soul is black
But I have no fear!

Your mind is filthy
Your soul is black
Now listen what
Darkness has to say:
"I am the Father,
I am the Blood,
I am your Weakness
I am your God!"

Don't close your eyes
Don't let 'em go
Beware of yourself
And darkness of your soul!
Choose your destiny
Between life and death
There is a thin line
Watch out! You may break it!

Get away from your lifelessness
Don't be afraid, destroy the inner weakness!
Obsolete darkness eats from within
Light your darkness or fall into Obscurity!!!
