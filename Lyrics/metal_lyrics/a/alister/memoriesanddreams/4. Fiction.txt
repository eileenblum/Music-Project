I still hear your calls
I still hear and I wonder
Who you are, who you are?
Do you really exist?
Why do you always disappear?
When I'm so close to you?
Would you ever let me touch your face?
Let me touch your face?

Would you ever let me touch your face?
Would you ever let me be in your embrace?
Would you ever let me be in your embrace?

I still hear your calls
I still hear your voice
And for the first time
I can see your face.
Your eyes are so familiar
But sometimes so strange and cold
I'm falling into your embrace
Into your embrace.

I'm falling into your embrace
And in it I can see my face
And in it I can see my face!
