[Obscurity bonus]

If you can keep your head when all about you
Are loosing theirs and blaming it on you
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you
But make alounces for their doubts too.

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue
Or walk with kings nor loose the common touch
If neither fows nor loving friends can hurt you
If all men count with you, but none too much

If you can feel the unforgiven minute
With sixty seconds worth of distance run
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it
And which is more, you'll be a Man my son.
