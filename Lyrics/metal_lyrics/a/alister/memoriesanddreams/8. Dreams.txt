Universe around is holding me
I'm not free to find you, I'm not free to hold Thee
Still I am captured and still I don't know
Who you are? Where you are? Do you really exist?
You are like mist, flowing through the dark
And I'm not free to hold you, and I'm not free to have you.
Where are your calls now? And where is your voice?
Do I know you? Do you know me? Where do we belong?

Would you ever let me touch your face?
Would I ever find your embrace?
And I'm still seeking,
Looking for you in my dreams.

Deep inside my darkest dreams
Your light is pure, your voice is my cure
Could you tell me just one more word?
Give me a sign and my life won't be absurd.
You are just my fiction, you are just my dream
You are just like poison that tears me from within.
Where are your calls now? And where is your voice?
Do I know you? Do you know me? Where do we belong?

Once I was so close to reach your hand
Once I was so close to fall into your embrace
But then I disappeared from the space of my dreams
Knowing you're just a fiction that lives in my dreams.
