[Obscurity bonus]

Behind the mountain's peak
Sun is coming out
Black bird's song bespeaks the end
Smell of blood comes on the wind!
Black sunrise of a black sun
Agony comes! Cicatrice!

Silence, deadly silence
Sunrise, black sunrise
Silence, sunrise of a black sun!

Pain is in my heart
Fear is in my soul
I can feel your hunger
For what I die for!
Black sunrise of a black sun
Agony comes! Cicatrice!

Black winds from the land of mist and frost
Dark forest, moonlight, mountains of the hate
Listen to my words and prepare your slayers
I'm coming back to reave their souls!

I have killed the fear
I have killed the pain
But now I can feel
They'll come again!
Black sunset of a black sun
Agony is gone but there's a cicatrice!
