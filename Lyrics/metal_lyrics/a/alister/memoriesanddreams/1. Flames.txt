I felt 'em once
Long time ago
So honest so pure
Flames!
I felt 'em once
Deep inside myself
Like a poison like a cure
Can they be lost?

Flames
Whenever my soul lights the flames
They'll take me back through my memories!

I felt 'em again
At the beginning, at the end
Much stronger less weak
Flames!
I felt 'em again
For the second time
Living harder fighting deeper
Faith is the cure!

I feel 'em now
At the new beginning
Six stars coming together
Flames!
I feel 'em now
They can never be lost
Burning together
Together as one!
