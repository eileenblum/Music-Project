I slept in the space of darkness
My blood was cold
Evil destruction around my head
Was destroying my soul
Rusted minds controlled my dreams
Erasing my memories
Giving me false reality
Giving me what to dream!

Awake!

I slept at the horizon
With no rising sun
Shadows were flowing around my body
But my blood was worm
Something strange filled my veins
Giving me strength
Again the voices in my head
Louder, clearer...

Then I woke up from my old coffin
And I opened my eyes
You can't bury me again this time
No, you can't take my life
Deepest memories lost in the space
Are coming together
I hope I'll never sleep again
I hope I'll be awake!
