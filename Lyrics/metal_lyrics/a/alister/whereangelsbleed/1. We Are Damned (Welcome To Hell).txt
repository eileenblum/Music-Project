Human ignorance summons the apocalypse
Hungry scavengers bespeak A total chaos
Mountains explode, flames are burning
The beast is awake

Full of hatred it's coming for us
Beware of the hellfire
Strokes of lightning hit the Earth
Nature is dying, we're fighting in vain

We are damned

It's eyes are bloodthirsty
Our mind is benighted
It's smiling so blithely
We are damned

Welcome - To - Hell

Winds are embracing the Earth
Oceans are rising, rivers are flooding
Plague strikes and flames keep burning
Bow to the beasts from Hell

Nothing remained
But the smell of rotting flesh
And if life returns to this place
The process will start again
