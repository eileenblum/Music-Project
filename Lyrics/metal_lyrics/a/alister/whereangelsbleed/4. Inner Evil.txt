[feat. Irina Kapetanovic]

[Raven:]
Sometimes
When the moon is full and bright
Comes the darkness
And takes my soul.
Desire
For blood - my precious weakness.
My heart would never be pure
If you won't be my cure.

[Nightingale:]
Tonight
As the light disappears,
Something strange is in my mind,
I feel the beating of the heart.
Desire
To be your mistress, be your blaze of life,
For my heart is poisoned
But I shouldn't let it be your cure.

[Together:]
Shadow in the moonlight
Don't make the heart die tonight
Dance for me like you never did before
You're my weakness - you're my flame of life.

[Raven:]
In this eternal night!
Nightingale:
At this cursed hour!
Together:
We are two different sides,
We're condemned to be apart,

[Raven:]
For I am your poison!
Nightingale:
And I am your cure!
Together:
Never together
For now and for ever!
