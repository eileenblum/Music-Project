Sinking in a sea of emptiness, alone
A solitude, an isolation, to living men unknown
Shadows of memories dance across my mind
Just beyond reach with the passing of time
Searching with blinded eyes
For a truth that once was
Feeling so alive
My mortality I deny
Shadows of memories
Dance across my mind
Now totally lost to the ghost of remembrance
No tears can I cry to quench the thirst of suffering
Looking on life as the altar with a saddened familiarity
Only now in madness can I see the simplicity
Silence of loneliness roars in my ears
My own heartbeat rhythm I've grown to fear
Seven times eternity I'm sentenced this living death
Grief and agony multiply with each and every breath
Blackness of space, vast space of time
To richness of life, my heart now blind
Memories of the past now torture my mind
Suffering for eternity no rest in dying
On stone ears fall my cries
Shadows of memories dance across my mind
Now barely able to bring me to another time
A time taken as something owed
Looking back I wish I'd chosen a different road
Now totally lost to the ghost of remembrance
No tears can I cry to quench the thirst of suffering
Each pain filled moment alone another black
Cross to bear
Silence the loneliness roars in my ears
On stone ears fall my cries
