Lost in a blur of psychostatic
Electro info windstorm manic
A philosophy a way of life
Sold in a smile evangeliphile
Soothing pulsation mindnumbing relief
Pablum for masses in a cathode ray bile
Neon holographic wonderland lies
Reflected in millions of unsuspecting eyes
Synapse overload experience of the future
Electrical misfire distort minds eye feature
Radio wave cataclysm perception molester
Thought breaking tele-message messiah of the future
We've become message receiver mutated creature
Corporate faker and multi-national whores
Profess social rules and cultural mores
The foulness of spoiled flesh and viscidity
Reflect neo-Marshall cornucopial dream idiocy
Drowning in a sea of psychostimulation
Damned to thing thought death in a supersonic communication nation
A cunning and wicked disease
Spread by a virus of ignorant pleas
From Father McLuhan
The future is born
Is there any shelter
From this schizophrenic storm
Transistorized thought patterns
Television tube sight
Minds become captive
Bound by radio wave might
Message receiver mutated creature
