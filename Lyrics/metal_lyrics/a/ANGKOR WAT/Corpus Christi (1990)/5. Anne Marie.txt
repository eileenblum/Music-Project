I've got a hot white burning inside
That time only feeds my minds
Only need I add you fuel
To my fire my flames burn higher and higher
Shaking, Shaking, Shaking
I feel my body aching
Into the whole down deep in my soul
I shrink into my faking
The day grows nearer
And passes like an angry cat
That sat I feel upon my back
And its claws run through my tears
See is what I feel again
See is what I feel again
I've the taste of dry sand in my mouth
The grit can feel my teeth run white
But will I ever find the future?
If t can't forget about the past?
Lies away
I feed your hungry head
You need it, you slimy black space
Leave alone the things I say
Lies away
I cease to explain no more
Your hungry head pleads for more
My body needs the touch of a hand
To soothe my shaking
I feel my body aching
Can you soothe my need?
It's what I want, it's what I want?
Please turn around
Oh but tomorrow is mine
