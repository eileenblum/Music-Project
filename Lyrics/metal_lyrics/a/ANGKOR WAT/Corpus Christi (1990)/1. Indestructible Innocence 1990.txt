It's totally psychological Motherfucker
It's totally psychological Motherfucker
Hate and war and blind despair
Tell me you love me
Tears and screams and unholy fears
Tell me you love me
I want you to look at me
Tell me you love me
Tell me you love me
We're not indestructible
We're not indestructible
Pride and lust and selfish greed
Bow your head and pray raw meat
Grind my soul on your city street
Black spine snake crack
Fetal facial moral plaque
Scientific mutilation diplomatic falsehood nation
Movie world horror king star of saviour play on pain
Instrumental souls insane I want you to look at me
Tell me you love me
We're not indestructible
We're not indestructible
