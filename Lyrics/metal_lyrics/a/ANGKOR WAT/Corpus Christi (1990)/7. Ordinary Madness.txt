Lost in a cold dark garden alone
My only company
Night blooming dementia
Bittersweet blossom bloom of madness
The sharp knife in the mind
Kills the devil in the soul
The sun's light blotted out
Skies filled with savage black birds
Devouring creation, devouring my heart
My soul, a multitude starving
Like the dawn of creation
We awaken to a new day
A day of confronting reality
That dark satin veil, pierced
Cold steel poles to invade my flesh
Felicity burned by the red hot
Fiery coals of desire
The white hot sun burning
Like the eye of God watching
The sharp knife in the mind
Kills the devil in the soul
The dark satin veil pierced
That cold steel finger in my brain
Just may bring peace
On sunshine days
When we cast no shadow
And the heat's baked our mind
Into lonely submission
Then is when we realize
Something as thin as the web of a spider
Holds us back from
Ordinary madness
