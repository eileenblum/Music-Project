So this ain't the end
I saw you again today
I had to turn my heart away
You smiled like the Sun
Kisses for everyone
And tales it never fails!
You're lying so slow in the weeds
I bet you gonna ambush me
You'd have me down on my knees
Barracuda
Back over time we were all trying for free
You met the porpoise and me
No right or wrong you're selling a song a name
Whisper game
And if the real thing don't do the trick
You better make up something quick
You gonna bum to the wick
Barracuda
Sell me sell you the porpoise said
Dive down deep now save my head
You, I think that you got the blues too
All that night and all the next
Swam without looking back
Made for the western pools, silly fools
