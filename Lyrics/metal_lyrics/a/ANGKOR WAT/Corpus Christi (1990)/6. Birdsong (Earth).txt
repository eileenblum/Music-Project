Bright sky blue
Who now fades too
Frames birds on the wing
Whose sweet songs too sad so sing
Now only an echo in my mind
As sky fades to black
I wonder if he'll ever be back
And if we had ears to hear
Would we act out of fear
Or could we realize
We often grew up believing lies
Deafened I couldn't hear that birdsong
Singing truth simple and strong
My eyes blinded
By selfish complications
Bright sky blue
Will my children's children ever know you
Those birds on the wing
Have a song they need to sing
To their children and my children too
It's a song of truth
Unpolluted by time or tongue
It's a song that tells
Of all being one
If you can get past your fear
It's a song you should hear
Deafened I could not hear that birdsong
Singing truth simple and strong
Blind I could not see that birdsong
Singing truth simple and strong
