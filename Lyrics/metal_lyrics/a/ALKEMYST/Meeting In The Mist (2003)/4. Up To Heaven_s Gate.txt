Warrior's pride in God's service
My sword for the Almighty's voice
Fighting and winning, I proved my faith
Quickly my prayers disappeared
Blackened by bones and flesh and blood
To Hell my soul was quickly driven

Then my soul was set a seal on
Forced to take the oath with Satan
"Seek the Grail!", the cup of wonders
To save my soul I had to find
The divine cure for our world's pain
Oh God my quest had to reach an aim!

I was not alone, got a friend by my side
From the land of damnation we came

Up to Heaven's gate we shall ride
We may find an answer for all
Now we won't be your slave at all
Salvation, damnation:
A game we won't play
No more

I was not alone, got a friend by my side
From the land of damnation we came

Up to Heaven's gate we shall ride
We may find an answer for all
Now we won't be your slave at all
Salvation, damnation:
A game we won't play
No more!
