[Chapter I - The Awakening]

Falling...
Dreaming...
Forever illusions...
A nameless son...

[Chapter II - The Falling Star]

I smile at the rising sun
It fills my heart with fire
I touch the green leaves
Oh, They're thinking about me
Clouds are opening now
To let my lungs breathe light
T feel the night is coming, bright

The falling star crosses the dark with my dreams on the top

The world's in my hand
Just with power of mind

Falling, crawling
It's falling, another dream when I found out
The world is just a place
Where animals try to survive
Dead nature to my eyes
A veil is hiding my light
Or is it a fault, forever illusions?
Forever shall I be
A nameless son?...

I woke with shadow, darkness
I felt the useless sense of my life
The falling stars crashed to the ground with my dreams on the top
The world in my hand, just with fear that the void is true

Falling, crawling
It's falling, another dream when I found out
The world is just a place
Where animals try to survive
Dead nature to my eyes
A veil is hiding my light
Or is it a fault, forever illusions?
Forever shall I be
A nameless son?...

Live, fight, kill
I try to survive
Cheat, steal, win
Show your strength

"Sometimes I dream of a Utopian mankind
Coming from the same place - lasting forever"

[Chapter III - Visions and Doubt]

She smiles in peace of hope
Sitting on that stone
There by the shore
Dance her notes across the water
Suspended on a breath of air fly on
They come to the ears of the snake

Crawling on the friend snake
Biting on her neck the faithful lady
Behind her eyes the sun's still shining
Joyful and magical as before

As in your eyes!

So many times I have dreamed of a sphere
The whole infinite I found just by looking through your eyes
Could it be just fear of nonsense
A dream of omnipotence
Now I'm gonna open that door
Soon, the time will come to know
Maybe we'll return

I have fallen on my knees
Have fallen another dream when I have found
An empty door I would have opened...
Dead nature to my eyes
A veil is hiding my light
Or is it a fault, forever?
Forever shall I be a nameless son?...

Falling, crawling
It's falling, another dream when I found out
The world is just a place
Where animals try to survive
Dead nature to my eyes
A veil is hiding my light
Or is it a fault, forever illusions?
Forever shall I be
A nameless son?...
