Alienation - lost control
Paranoia - is the cage close now?

In a cold cell- I am trapped in the mirror
Insane again - will my mind explode?

Now it's time to face
The shadows - they dance in my head
It's time to conquer my land
It's time - I wonder
If I can escape from myself?
I'm still blind, trapped in my mind
Forever

In the shadows of my soul
Demons laughing
Let me sleep!

In a cold cell- I am trapped in the mirror
Insane again - will my mind explode?

Now it's time to face
The shadows - they dance in my head
It's time to conquer my land
It's time - I wonder
If I can escape from myself?
I'm still blind, trapped in my mind
Forever
