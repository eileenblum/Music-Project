Hear us call, need an answer now !
You might find it beyond...
"No one's beyond, we killed our gods"
So the answer is lost...
What are we here for?
Hoping for a piece of paradise
Praying...kneeling...

"For the time has come"
To open our eyes!
Free our mind
And scream!

Look!
We're living like dogs
We crawl, our values were sold
Slavery : that the price we're gonna pay
Our power...wasted

"For the time has come"
To build a new world,
Free our mind
And scream!

As I know the truth, I won't be saved
Then I won't be damned
I'm my own master I'll never accept to surrender
In the depths of my head
Always proud,
A voice is still screaming
I'm still alive
