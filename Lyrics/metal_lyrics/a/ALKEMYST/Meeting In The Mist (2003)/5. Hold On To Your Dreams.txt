Chasing whispers
The shadows belong to my mind
They shattered my dreams
Now boy, the time has come,
Worry about your fate!
Watch out I'm here
Answers aren't to be found
In this world of lies
Just look at the children cry!
The dark of the night is fading out

...Sow my little creatures misery...
I've got them in mind to spread
Reality is more than what you see

I say and I swear
So count on me
I tell I swear
So now trust me

Chasing whispers
Destroying our glance on real world
I've done it and taste the blood
But still I'm dreaming
A phoenix being reborn again...
Day by day
I hold on to my dreams and someday
I may reach my promised land

I say and I swear
So count on me
I tell I swear
So now trust me

Chasing whispers
Destroying our glance on real world
I've done it and taste the blood
But still I'm dreaming
A phoenix being reborn again...
Day by day
I hold on to my dreams and someday
I may reach my promised land
