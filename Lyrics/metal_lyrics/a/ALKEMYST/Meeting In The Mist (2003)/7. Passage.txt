I wait in silence...
Fire burns inside my empty soul
Pain is all that remains
Now I think
Once I was younger and stronger

The skies are open wide
I feel I get weaker
The skies are open wide
I reach the end of my life

Hear! There are voices beyond
(I'm deaf and those voices are silent)
I'll fight and survive!
Standing with pride
I'll look at your eyes
I'm not an easy prey
Every night, I can feel your presence in the darkest light

A shade in my mind
A shade on my mind
The skies are open wide
I reach the end of my life

Brave and proud I'm waiting for you
My thoughts are heading for your call
Will you miss the place the hours?
(to) Guide me through this passage unknown?

The skies are open wide
I feel I get weaker
The skies are open wide
I reach the end of my life

Brave and proud I'm waiting for you
My thoughts are heading for your call
Will you miss the place the hours?
(to) Guide me through this passage unknown?
