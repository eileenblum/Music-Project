Screamin' out the pain
Shouting to the skies above
I find no reason for it all
As a nightmare it will come
And close your eyes
Leave your heart behind
Can't look back at all

And you can deny the call
The time has come
Be shunt to another life

My soul now will return to higher paths
My eyes will cry no more
A figure through the darkness guides me to my home

As I'm looking through your eyes
There's something more
Oh, you're praying for a dawn in winter's fog
A brighter light that comes and solves the fear
So let's live your world

Too hard to face the end of higher art
Your soul may reach no heaven
Too late to look inside for reason why
You have lived

Have I been dreaming and fighting in vain?
I feel myself in a void with no sense
I had the power to talk with my heart
It gives me the wings of a god
As I point my eyes on my soul
What I see destroys my memories
Maybe the skies are getting cold
I fade in the distance, fade in the distance

I dream, I swear
I've seen only what they taught me
I dream, I swear
I got the power inside

Have I been dreaming and fighting in vain?
I feel myself in a void with no sense
I had the power to talk with my heart
It gives me the wings of a god
As I point my eyes on my soul
What I see destroys my memories
Maybe the skies are getting cold
I fade in the distance, fade in the distance
