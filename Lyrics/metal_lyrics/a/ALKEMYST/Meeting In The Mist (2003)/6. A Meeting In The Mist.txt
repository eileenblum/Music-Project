Walking obscure paths
My mind's summoning shadows from the past
They dance before my eyes
I know faces, but they fade away,
Ethereal misty ballet
The haze of time's on me

And I listen to a voice in the air
With tears I am singing
Will the mist fall away with the tide?
Will the light shine again?

I dream
I have never thought it once could have been real
It comes closer, sweet...
A silhouette rising up
An invisible presence so now appears...

I try to find this instant again
When a face and a smile pierced the haze
The meeting remains my sweetest dream
But still it's escaping in the wind, hanging on the wave
My glance is lost, hanging on nowhere
I'm sitting on the stone? Waiting for an answer

And I listen to a voice in the air
It sings with tears of despairs
Will the light shine again on my path?
Will the memories fall with the tide?

Dream...
I have never thought it once could have been real
It comes closer, sweet...
A silhouette rising up
An invisible presence so now appears...
I see...
Can I feel it through the clouds? It appears...
So deeply, in my heart
I'm diving, and then the spell sets me free
