Wrong expectations from the future
Step by step it's coming near
advanced prolongation of corrupted reality
makes all human disasters clear

Catastrophically misuse of the Earth
once thing was whole and now gone lost
Guided by false rhymes of their Gods
Homo species face real meaning of words

Under the vast reign of Entropy
Chaos turns the only existing way
All bombastic researches of the Military
Altogether will not hold this planet to stay

No one of today's idols will see tomorrow
Digital monsters gonna die in forthcoming vein
and from deep cages of striped souls
weird presence forever remains

And among the fires of vanished great cities
crawling on abandoned treasures of lust
Human spirit as the only survivor
predicts the future from the scattered past
