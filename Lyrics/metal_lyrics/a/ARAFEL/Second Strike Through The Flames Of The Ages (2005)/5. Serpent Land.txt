When darkness comes and the Night begins
The enemies prepare to hunt and sin
For Ancient Glory of Pagan Past
Our spirit of war will arise

Connected by virtue to woods and rivers
We spent our lives near darkest shores
We keep our arms as symbol of fight
No one can conquer our land tonight.

The land of dark woods and waters of pure

We swear to save your richness for sure
The enemy will act strong, brutal and fast
In strength of soul and sword we trust

When darkness comes and the Night begins
The enemies prepare to hunt and sin
We keep our arms as symbol of fight
No one can conquer our land tonight.

Clatters of horses, gnashing of metal
Fury in eyes feed a roaring Battle
The land was sprinkled by warm enemy's blood
Hymn of victory sings in our hearts

DEFEND YOUR MOTHERLAND UNTIL LAST BREATH
THERE IS NO SURRENDER! THERE IS NO RETREAT!

When darkness comes and the Night begins
The enemies prepare to hunt and sin
We keep our arms as symbol of fight
No one can conquer our land tonight.
Steel is cold and mind is clear
Forget about pain and feel no fear
Spirits of nature live deep inside
Leaving mercy and compassion behind
Rain falls down and wipes blood away
Fallen warriors step into the realm of gray
Forest 's leaves whisper very last pray
In eternity they stay
