The skies and the future, the color is the same
It's black:
The land is in a swamp there is no way,
Dark falls on homeland. That's it. The end is on the way
Horned knights, they are coming soon
Their blades shine under the opaque moon
Enemy: they want to rule our motherland
Enemy: they'll take our treasure till the end
Enemy: they'll burn our homes and fields
Enemy: they came with war!
The land needs help, the people pray for it a lot:
All of a sudden lightning strikes from the sky. It's a marvel from the dark!

Forgotten sun brings back to us illumination
The baby's cry revives lost hope of the nation
Forgotten sun brings back to us illumination
The baby's cry revives lost hope of the nation
The wind, is rocking the cradle, and father holds the candle
A flame-colored look from the baby's eyes makes father's eyes to freeze like ice
Birth of demon or birth of god, but he must grow up with chosen blood

The crowd hails the little king
The steed was snorting beneath the prince
Forgotten sun brings back to us illumination
And Alexander revives lost hope of the nation
Have you enough strength to defeat the enemy horde?
Have you enough power to stay with the throne?
