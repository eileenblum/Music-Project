The forest is imbued with the smell of the battle
The spirit of war soar above
Gaze around your land. What do you see?
Destiny's sign says that you're not a child anymore
The time of the wooden swords is over the time of metal is near!
Metal has come

So you are old enough to ride your own way
Your trusty steed is waiting for you
Your Armour is ready to cover you
The bow wants to be squeezed by your hands
And targets long for the spikes of your lances

But you need to learn, learn the art of war and faithful Ratsha will guide you.
He'll teach you to kill and not to be killed

10 shots in one minute or the sun won't rise anymore
10 shots in one minute or your people forever will be slaves
10 shots in one minute to turn you into a warrior
10 shots in one minute or you'll meet your death

You're still so young. This is the reason why your shield and sword are weightless
You wish to conquer the world like youthful child
Feelings of vengeance possess your mind

Your life is a struggle. Your life is a trial
You can die in a battle or from poisoned wine.
You don't know whom you trust, even a friend can betray
You can't avoid this dismal lot. Death is your fate
