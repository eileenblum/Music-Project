There where the sun is rising
from the faraway vast widths
malicious hordes have come on the
calm and free lands of the east...

...without having gained an easy conquest
the hordes finally decide
that after the long siege
it will be possible to capture the city
but the squad is fighting unequal battle
fighting for fatherland!
