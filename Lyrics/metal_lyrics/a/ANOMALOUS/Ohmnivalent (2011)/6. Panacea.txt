My cathedral surrounds me
from my chorus of canyons
to the hymns of my rolling blue hills

but my head slipped into a steel trap
severed the connection and put under the microscope
landscapes on a platter, reduced to code

lasso-tied, conquered, bound
hard disk obelisk
penetrating dirt mound
embers drowned

dust to dust
ashes, ashes you don't define me

bury me head-first into the ground
absorb and plant my seed
bury me alive
plant the seed nourish me so I may sprout

how advanced am I?
not enough land for my mass graves
how much progress have I made
if I'm still alone and enslaved?

pavement dreams haunt me
as steel gives way to sand and sea

my plastic rotating cage deteriorating
and fueling a new all-consuming seascape

lunar force colliding, breaking
containers spill back into the source

dust to dust
ashes you're my only destiny
