recurrence eternal
a false beginning with a tricky ending

it's all played out before
the greatest error doomed to repetition
invert this loop
oscillating mirage dream

conform to my new rebellious
anarchic military state
I can settle down in a vivarium
if the cell wall are wide enough to let me
spread my wings
I submit to you sharia in the sky
and maybe if you repeat a lie often enough
it could set you free!

bleeding knees
plasma ticking and smoking
imminent flesh-fueled bomb
feels like I've been on my knees too long
defined only by opposition
what am I without my scapegoat
on which I project my venomous rage?

how may I exalt myself without the cloak of purity?
all the pages buried within your vault
will not shelter my eyes while you get under my skin
assimilate and push that rock up the mountain again
another revolution another curtain-parting puppet show reveal
resentment there will always be
no matter who tops the hierarchy
blind man sees internally
when there's no witness to the fall

all the desecrations hidden in your vault
will not burn out my eyes
while she's executed in honor, martyr
my skin is steel your nails won't break through

for every stone lodged in the cross
for every raped and plagiarized ascension
it will die inside her jagged womb
his papal occupation

blind woman sees
through janus eyes
the one, the three
dead before it's alive

now it's time to get off of your knees
the vault is open and her spirit has risen

you're redeemed
open your eyes
don't swim upstream in the infant trinity's sea of lies
reverse the tide
reverse the lie
set us free
