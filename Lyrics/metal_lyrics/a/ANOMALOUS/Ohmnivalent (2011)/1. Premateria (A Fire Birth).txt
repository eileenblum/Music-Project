eye ex nihilo
out of the alpha swirling nuclear density
expanding, contracting, interpenetrating
cell walls touch, but I need an opening

thine infallible tessellation made flesh
reaching out of the orange dawn
fingertips beholden to a remote microbial sphere

26 orbs spiraling
snaking around her wooly legs
a wind blew, shaking the web
and knocked a globe off course

gyrated and submerged into amniotic oceans
encircling her fertile core
igneous ascends like an offspring prosimian wail

igneous ascends like fire from the sky
His good earth is born like venus crucified

forged in his shape
hands embracing flame
diminutive puppet thumb reaches around a rib bone
a slave of his own
given the choice of subservience or destitution

you cannot be me
there was one and now there's three
eclipsing the sky with a babbelling menagerie

feeble hands reaching at immortality
but the serpent-stung wrists bleed
draining the venom for eternity

you're my mistake and you'll always be
beneath my divine grace
