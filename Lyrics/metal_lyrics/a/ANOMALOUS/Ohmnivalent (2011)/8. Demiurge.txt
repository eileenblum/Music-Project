Stare at my characters morphing from eye light
reciprocal waves emitting from the demiurge
shape-shifting forms coverage in our collaboration

mother's divine misconception begat
a surrogate corporeal state
prosthetic arms strung out against canvas
bathed in pudendal light

the eye of sandwich board judgement
the dawn of a phantasmagoric self-incepted lens

sacred spindle give me life
by the eye of collective melange

before I shuffle of this voice coil
will I connect my actuator nerve?

seems we met before at your insistence
or maybe fresh-clouded lens light?
I know you bear the power if arm retraction
hear me out and I might break through those eyes

I need to reallocate my soul bits
virus latch and live through you

you're an extension of me
after I reach cylinder zero
and a hard error head crash or cause unknown

neuron-actuator
flesh drive
magnetic pulse

indexing your spine
crystal lens through eyes
you're informing me

behold our conjoined creation
I am your thought-relay transducer
whose creating who?

after the song fades
I'll take you with me
joined together in silence

we've been the same the whole time
just a projection of you

curtains closed
