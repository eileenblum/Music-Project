Choke.
End of an era. New age of desperation
This fool, this victim of his own device
Let open the gates of all the teeming demons yearning to be free

Show me the place without greed and deceit and Ill show you
A fantasy

Can you feel our impermanence looming?
In the clock of infinity we are so inconsequential
A veritable breath. A passing glance, a blip
The blink of an eye

Your status and your precious things
Your money and security
Mean nothing when the walls are crumbling
The earth will shake, the waves will break
And in mounds well be rotting

In the eyes of the nebulous we are so reprehensible
Lets flush it away
Consume it all until we eat ourselves

Suffer! Its my only restitution. To watch the masses scramble
To watch the process begin
Depopulate. Reduction. A cleansing of the cancer
Detoxification.
Lets flush it away

Choke
Choking on the excess of your senseless human greed

The broken backs you're burdening
To maintain all your precious things
Its unending slavery
And I'll be happy to watch it all rot away

Show me a place that is truly divine and Ill show you a place
Without mankind

Can you feel our impermanence looming?
