Mullan alla lepÃ¤si
Vaaksan verran peittona
KylmÃ¤ssÃ¤ kehdossa
Uinu kalman kynnellÃ¤

Sato verta taivahasta
Puna hiekan kasteli
Aukes silmÃ¤t mullan alla
Nyrkkiin koura kipristyy
Liha hauras voimistui
Kasvo nahka luihen pÃ¤Ã¤lle
HerÃ¤s maasta musta mieli
Paha ilma keuhkot tÃ¤yttÃ¤Ã¤

Mullan alta herÃ¤si
Vaaksan verran peittona
KylmÃ¤stÃ¤ kehdosta
Nousi kalman kynneltÃ¤

[English translation:]

[In Hell Is The Sinners Heaven]

Rested under the soil
Six feet under
In the cold cradle
Slept in death

Blood was raining from the sky
Red watered the sands
Eyes open under the ground
Hand tightened to a fist
Flesh so fragile was now stronger
Skin grew over the bones
A black mind arose from the ground
Evil fills the lungs

Woke from under the earth
Under six feet
From the cold cradle
Resurrected from the brink of death

[English translation 2:]

Rested under the earth
Covered by a handbreadth
In a cold cradle
Slumbered in near death

Blood raineth from the sky
The sand doused red
Eyes opened under the earth
Up to a fist the hand curls
Flesh frail grew strong
Grew skin to cover bone
Awoke from earth a black mind
Miasma filling the lungs

Woke from under the earth
Covered by a handbreadth
From the cold cradle
Arose from near death
