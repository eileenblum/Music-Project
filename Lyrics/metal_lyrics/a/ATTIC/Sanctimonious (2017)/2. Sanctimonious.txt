Sunset, darkness had fallen on the hill
A storm was raging on outside the abbey
In supplication sister Joan was kneeling at the convent gate,
Begging for admission once again

[Joan:]
"Purify me, forgive me my sins mother
Purify me, remove the demon within"

The gate swung open and Joan was taken by the hand
The old draconic abbess grasped her with an icy grip

[Margaret:]
"I'll punish defection, won't tolerate your sins
I'll bring salvation," mother Margaret said

[Joan:]
"Purify me, forgive me my sins mother
Purify me, remove the demon within"

[Margaret:]
"Your sins can be forgiven
Just die by my hand
De profundis clamavi ad te domine
They all plead for their lives and repent
Oh father rest her soul in the end
You deceived the Lord, acted the innocent
You sanctimonious whore"

[Margaret:]
"Hell awaits all infidels
Hell awaits all apostates
The day you left my convent, you were dead to me girl
Now you return to die again"

Margaret tore off her sister's veil and
Dragged her about by the hair
To the cloister courtyard
A dagger in her hand

[Margaret:]
"Your sins can be forgiven
Just die by my hand
De profundis clamavi ad te domine
They all plead for their lives and repent
Oh father rest her soul in the end
You deceived the Lord, acted the innocent
You sanctimonious whore"
