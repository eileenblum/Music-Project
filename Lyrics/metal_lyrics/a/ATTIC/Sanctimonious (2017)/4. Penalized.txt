13 girls side by side in line
One of the sisters committed crime
Foretold by voices from on high
Mother's revelations never lie

[Margaret:]
"With devious lies, Satan creeps into your minds
Soon we will see, who's not who she claims to be
Take this knife and get undressed
Incise the holy cross on your chests
God strengthens the innocent
Scourge yourself and face the torment
I won't abandon you to lust and lechery
And what I do, hurts me more than it hurts you"

[Margaret:]
"Down on your knees
You will bleed
Like he did on Calvary
By God's holy laws you despise
You shall be penalized"

Divine epiphany or insane bigotry?
No one ever saw what Margaret claimed to see
Distress behind enclosure
One sister could stand the pain no longer

[Margaret:]
"Take her to the cellar, I know what she needs
Ordeal by boiling water, she will concede"

[Margaret:]
"Down on your knees
You will bleed
Like he did on Calvary
By God's holy laws you despise
You shall be penalized"
