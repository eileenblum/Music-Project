[Alice:]
"You don't always reap what you sow
But God insists on obedience
Angel of light,
Don't lead me into temptation
I hear your voice every night
Whispering in my ear
Is it the devil that speaks to me?

[Voice:]
"Lay down your sinless heart
I'll rip you piety apart
Lay down your sinless heart
I'll rip you piety apart
I'll rip your piety apart"

[Alice:]
"Absolve my guilt one last time
I know, I broke my vow of chastity
Indulged myself in lust
Mortal sins in the sacristy
But God knows what no one can see
A lifetime full of sin
Is it the devil that speaks to me?"

[Voice:]
"Lay down your sinless heart
I'll rip you piety apart
Lay down your sinless heart
I'll rip you piety apart
I'll rip your piety apart"

[Alice:]
"Father, I have sinned
Seduced by the devil deep within
Father, please forgive me
I know I'll pay for my blasphemy
I know I'll pay for my blasphemy"

[Alice:]
"Is it the devil that speaks to me?"

[Voice:]
"Lay down your sinless heart
I'll rip you piety apart
Lay down your sinless heart
I'll rip you piety apart
I'll rip your piety apart"
