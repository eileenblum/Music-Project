Still isolated in the tower
Waiting for pain to come
Through the window to the courtyard
She saw a light in the dark

Margaret was lighting candles at the cellar entrance

[Alice:]
"What do you scheme?
Oh I wonder what's behind the door
Only you have the key for"

Alice left her chamber
To follow Margaret to the cellar

[Alice:]
"What does she hide down inside?
What does she hide deep down inside her mind?"

She found the hidden crypt under holy ground
Down in the dark
A grave for infant bastard kids
Born to die at once
Straight from the cradle to the grave
Killed at birth
Born from sin

Alice screamed at the top of her lungs

[Alice:]
"Margaret, what have you done?"

Infanticide in the name of Christ
Murder in holy disguise

Alice knocked her to the ground,
Grabbed her neck and choked her

[Alice:]
"What do you hide down inside?
What's going on in your deranged mind?"

She found the hidden crypt under holy ground
Down in the dark
A grave for infant bastard kids
Born to die at once
Straight from the cradle to the grave
Killed at birth
Born from sin
