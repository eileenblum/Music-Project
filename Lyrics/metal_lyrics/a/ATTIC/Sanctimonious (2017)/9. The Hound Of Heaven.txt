When everybody's fast asleep, she arises
Driven by a vision in her head
Almost every night she left the convent walls unseen
Led by divine order to purge a world so obscene

[Margaret:]
"Say your last false prayer
I'll find you everywhere!"

And every single night
She saw that glaring light
A kind of spectral entity
In her mind an angel's telling her to feed the God
...with blood

Blood
Unbelievers' blood
Blood
Unbelievers' blood

In the alleys, in the streets, people vanish
When Margaret's on her quest for blood
"Lovely Belle," they said, she was a notorious whore
How sad, she and her bastard son were seen nevermore

[Margaret:]
"Say your last false prayer
I'll find you everywhere!"

And every single night
She saw that glaring lifht
A kind of spectral entity
In her mind an angel's telling her to feed the God
...with blood

Blood
Unbelievers' blood
Blood
Unbelievers' blood

Every night under angel's command
Margaret was talking to herself again
While hiding bodies in the woods

[Margaret:]
"Naught shelters ye, who wilt not shelter Me"

And every single night
She saw that glaring lifht
A kind of spectral entity
In her mind an angel's telling her to feed the God
...with blood
