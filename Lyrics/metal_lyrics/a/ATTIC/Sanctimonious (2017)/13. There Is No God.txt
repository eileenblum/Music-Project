Margaret was on the floor
She wasn't breathing anymore
Her eyes so dead
Alice heard the voices in her head...again

Standing in the cellar amid decay and decline
Surrounded by the testimonies of Margaret's crimes
Alice was still in shock, her hands were shaking
It was apparent that her mind was breaking

Pure insanity in her eyes
Her faith was broken

[Alice:]
"No God in the skies
Just infinite lies
I deny the deceiver Jesus Christ"

[Alice:]
"Chaos will arise
All hope is lost"

The voice still talking in her head
It said: "There is no God"

[Alice:]
"Like a sheep led astray, I've been so blind
Your lord of lies feeds on simple minds
If there's a God he has left us to die anyway
Only terror reigns and death prevails"

Pure insanity in her eyes
Her faith was broken

[Alice:]
"No God in the skies
Just infinite lies
I deny the deceiver Jesus Christ"

[Alice:]
"Chaos will arise
All hope is lost"

The voice still talking in her head
It said: "There is no God"

Alice left the crypt and went to the dorm room
Margaret's dagger in her hand

[Alice:]
"No more lies, I'd rather bow to the devil's might
I'll end it all, I'll end it all tonight"

The first two sisters Alice passed were smothered in their sleep
The rest, awoken by a scream

[Alice:]
"Hail Satan!"

In a murderous frenzy, the nuns were stabbed one by one
Alice seemed to have fun

[Alice:]
"Hail Satan!"

After all the blood was shed, a dreadful scene was left
A convent of the dead

[Alice:]
"Hail Satan!"

[Alice:]
"Chaos will arise
All hope is lost"

The voice still talking in her head
It said: "There is no God"
