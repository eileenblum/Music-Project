[Margaret:]
"Choir practice today
There's no excuse to stay away"

Alice was still in bed
A piercing pain, in her head
Her condition got worse

[A fellow Sister:]
"If you don't go, you'll be coerced"

So she made her way up to the choir

[Margaret:]
"Sing!"

She could hardly climb the stairs

[Margaret:]
"Sing like an angel!"

[Alice:]
"Oh God," she cried
"There's blood on the choir stalls"
Her pregnancy exposed, blood has drenched her clothes
"Oh God, my child"
Her blood on the choir stalls
[Margaret:]
"Brazen Pharisee, you broke your chastity"

A stream of blood like claret
And the child came out dead
The sisters were petrified in fear

[Margaret:]
"No!
You won't blemish and defile
These halls no more
I'll get rid of the child
You others, clean that floor!"

[Margaret:]
"Sin!
Fornication means damnation!
...Damnation!"

[Alice:]
"Oh God," she cried
"There's blood on the choir stalls"
Her pregnancy exposed, blood has drenched her clothes
"Oh God, my child"
Her blood on the choir stalls
[Margaret:]
"Brazen Pharisee, you broke your chastity"

The pain was sharp and searing
Like a hot coal, burning in her stomach
Like being eaten from inside

[Margaret:]
"Take her away
To the tower
She brought disgrace on this holy place
Isolated she shall dwell
In her tower cell
No on should ever to speak to her...again"
