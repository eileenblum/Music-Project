[Alice:]
"A final prayer all alone, behind these walls of stone
On darkest days reality fades
No one to trust in this convent of snakes
The Lord has given, the Lord has taken away
Still I have to stay
Bound by shame to this penitent's cell
Why won't you take my life as well?

Take my life!
Remove the seven swords sticking in my heart!
End this pain, take my soul!
Guide me down to Sheol!
Remove the seven swords, the seven swords sticking in my heart!

The pain inside feeds the doubt I tried to hide
Oh tell me Lord, what's left to do?
Give me a reason why I shouldn't turn my back on you

Take my life!
Remove the seven swords sticking in my heart!
End this pain, take my soul!
Guide me down to Sheol!
Remove the seven swords, the seven swords sticking in my heart!"
