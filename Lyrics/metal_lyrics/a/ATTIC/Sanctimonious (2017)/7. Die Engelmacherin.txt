The twinge of remorse grew stronger each day
Her guilty conscience, a mental strain
Poor Alice, she needed a friend
Someone to talk to, who understands
...Understands

Prioress Clare was always at hand
The heart and soul of the convent
Talking to her was such a relief
She could keep a secret and ease Alice's grief

Oh, death drew near unseen
Peace can be deceiving

Alice felt so unburdened
In the cloister garden
Reciting the rosary
Having devotions quietly
While the church bell rang
She heard the cherubs sing
Not knowing that soon
Her child would be one of them

Joan always said: "Don't trust the Prioress"

In secret Clare was a snitch
And so submissive to the abbess
Right on the next day
She gave Alice's secret away
...Betrayal

Without a spark of decency
She reported Alice's pregnancy

[Margaret:]
"Transgression against holy law
You know the procedure, take care of that whore!"

Oh, death drew near unseen
Peace can be deceiving

Alice felt so unburdened
In the cloister garden
Reciting the rosary
Having devotions quietly
While the church bell rang
She heard the cherubs sing
Not knowing that soon
Her child would be one of them

Joan always said: "Don't trust the Prioress"

In the refectory
One meal was prepared separately
Clare was a master of her craft
Margaret's herbalist
Oh Alice never noticed that strange bitterness
Nor the poison of the prioress

[Clare:]
"Mother, this herbal extract
With mandrake and blue flag
Black hellebore and archangel
Is the key
To kill what's not meant to be"

Alice felt so unburdened
In the cloister garden
Reciting the rosary
Having devotions quietly
While the church bell rang
She heard the cherubs sing
With every meal, with every bite
She was killing her child

...Killing her child
