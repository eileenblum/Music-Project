The clock striked midnight
Donât leave your home anymore
âCause the headless horseman rides tonight
Coming to decapitate you â fear his might!

Heâs shattering the silence
With his ghastly cries
Is he coming for you?
Heâs wearing robes of black
The ambassador of death
Donât lose your head!

Never pass the haunted moor at night
Beware of the headless rider
When you hear his hooves, you know itâs too late
Beware of the headless rider!

A sallow full moon
The only light that shines throught the trees
The black spectre has returned from the dead
Risen from his grave to steal your head

Heâs racing through the darkness
On his undead horse
Run as fast as you can!
He will hunt you down
Till the night is gone
At the break of dawn, he is done

Never pass the haunted moor at night
Beware of the headless rider
When you hear his hooves, you know itâs too late
Beware of the headless rider!
