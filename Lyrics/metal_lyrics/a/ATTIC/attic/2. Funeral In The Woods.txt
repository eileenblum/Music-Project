In her Attic room stood a shrine
Made for ancient relics, evil or divine
On Christmas eve she took her own life
What a tragedy, but what she did was heresy

Black magic, alchemy
Giving worship to pagan gods is blasphemy
Her relatives entombed at the local grave mound
But for her disgrace, sheâs buried in unholy ground

Funeral in the woods
Her shame is not over yet
A wooden cross between the trees
But she wonât rest in peace

Funeral in the woods
Damned to rot alone
A wooden cross between the trees
But she wonât rest... she wonât rest in peace

In her Attic room stood a shrine
Made for ancient relics, evil or divine
On the skirts of the wood, they found her
Hanging on a tree, oh what she did was heresy
