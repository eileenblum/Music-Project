You donât always rip what you sow
But God insists on obedience
Angel of light,
Donât lead me into temptation
I hear your voice every night

...whispering in my ear
Is it the devil that speaks to me?

âLay down your sinless heart
Iâll rip your piety apart
Lay down your sinless heart
Iâll rip your piety apart
Iâll rip your piety apartâ

Absolve my guilt one last time
I know, I broke my vow of chasity
Indulged myself in lust
Mortal sins in the sacristy
But God knows what no one can see

...a lifetime full of sin
Is it the devil that speaks to me?

âLay down your sinless heart
Iâll rip your piety apart
Lay down your sinless heart
Iâll rip your piety apart
Iâll rip your piety apartâ

Father, I have sinned
Seduced by the devil deep within
Father, please forgive me
I know Iâll pay for my blasphemy
I know Iâll pay for my blasphemy

Is it the devil that speaks to me?
