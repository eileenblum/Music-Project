Weâre in ancient Egypt a thousand years before Christ
Through deserted fields a proscribed man is on the run
Through the hot desert sand ...oh no...
An outlaw has no place to go

The sun is burning down relentlessly
No place to hide, no shelter, not a single tree
And as he finally draws his last breath
He knows flagitious souls will never resurrect

Kneel down before the lord of the underworld
You failed, you didnât pass Osirisâ test
The Scales of justice end your final hour
Now youâll meet the devourer of souls

He can reach the afterlife or die a second death
On his exhausting journey through the underworld
Death is just the beginning ...oh, no...
âProof the purity of your soulâ

Threaten by demons, he has to pass the gates
To reach his final test, where heââll meet his fate
Anubis initiates the weighing of the heart
âIf you fail Ammit will tear your soul apartâ

Meet the devourer of souls
Meet the devourer of... souls
