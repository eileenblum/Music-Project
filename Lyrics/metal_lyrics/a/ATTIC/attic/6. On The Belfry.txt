Mary, she always loved the trees in the setting sun
Playing hide and seek in the woods was so much fun
The nightly meetings at the glade always seemed so harmless
Until she saw her friends burning at the stake

One day she got sudden visit
âTime to confess my dearâ
âWe know what youâve doneâ
âAn accused witch thatâs what you areâ
âConfess or suffer in hot black tarâ

In panic Mary started to run
Trying to escape, bigots never leave undone
She was looking for refuge in the local church
As she descried the open door to the belfry

Run, Mary run
Much to late for you to pray, the witchfinder is on his way

Kill Mary
Kill Mary on the belfry
Kill Mary
Kill Mary
Kill Mary on the belfry

Marys name rang through the tower
âTime to confess my dearâ
âWe know what youâve doneâ
âAn accused witch thatâs what you areâ
âConfess or suffer in hot black tarâ

She made her way to the spire of the church
The mob so close to her heels
âNowhere to hide for you in this sacred place
Oh, girl, itâs time to meet your fateâ

Listen to the bell
Listen to the bell
Itâs your death knell
