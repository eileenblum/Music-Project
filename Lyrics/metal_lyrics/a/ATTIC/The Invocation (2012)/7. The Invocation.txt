Black candles burn in this convent tonight
We forced our way in their sacred halls

To chant a litany of blasphemy
To pay obeisance to our lord

One of the nuns will join sacrament of lust
A human sacrifice under the inverted cross

"Oh sister you don't have to renounce your God
We just need your life, we need your blood"

Satanas, I call thee
Lucifer, I invoke thy demons
Azazel rise from utter darkness
I bow to you and avow myself to the liturgy of sin

Incense is rising to the chapel ceiling
Time to recite the incantation

We are enlightened, disciples of the dark lord
We feed the black flame

"While the other nuns are sleeping, you can witness God's demise
Sister, you'll see the frailty of Christ"

We are priests of the left hand path
The lord we praise tonight is not the God above
