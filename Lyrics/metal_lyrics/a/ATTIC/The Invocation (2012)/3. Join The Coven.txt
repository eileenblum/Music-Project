Demons arise from the cauldron
Black magic reigns tonight
At the fireplace
We her our enemies

Blood is spilled on the ground
Lets start the ritual
But remember girl,
This initiation takes its tool

Surrender to the master
Sell your soul
Surrender to the master
Sell your soul

Now swear the oath
Join the coven
Drink from the chalice of blood

Now swear the oath
Join the coven
Drink from the chalice of blood

Pledge your loyalty to Satan
Give up your chastity
Undress for the master
And dance in ecstacy

Immerse yourself in a world of lust
When Saturn shows its might
Kiss the goat and join our witches ride

All you've seen remains our secret
This union is a pact forever
If you ever leave our path, expect a slow and anguished death
