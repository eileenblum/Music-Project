When the swamps are covert with snow
Everything seems peaceful
Though you know what's down below

Even if he knew there was something amiss
He went into her trap
Mesmerized by evil, a woman he can't resist
"Henry, I'll show you my secret" she said
Bewitched by beauty, a lady in white
"Follow me to the temple of night"

"You are a part of a ritual
And you will die in this sacred hall"

She drank his blood like wine
Under the devils sign
A call to the master
Unholy angels sing a chant full of sin
Hail to the queen of the light
She is Satan's bride

Henry was awakened by a glaring light
It was so bright a sharp pain filled his eyes

A ritualistic fire was blazing in the temple
"Hear my call... my lord my master"
She was screaming in ecstasy
Henry was tied to an altar of sin
"Let the ritual begin"

Fallen Angel, Beelzebub, oh Lucifer
Hear my call
Take this human sacrifice, my carnal offering
Take his flesh and rise again
