Now I'm kneeling in your ashes, at the place where witches burn
What have they done to you?
Was I ensnared by a demon, ... a succubus?
No... I loved you

I'll do anything
I'll sell my soul to the devil
Though I begged them to spare your life
Church authority is always right
Damn you Christ, tonight I'll make them pay

For Lucifer is my witness, their whole parish will burn
I know revenge won't ever bring her back to life again
But those who burned Edlyn are gonna burn in hell as well

May the flames clean their corrupted souls
This is the last time they're sleeping tight
'Cause all of them gonna die tonight
Oh Lord, they're all condemned to hell

Edlyn, she wasn't at the Sabbath on that fateful night
But inquisitions forced confessions are so goddamn right
Oh Edlyn

Christianity, it's you that I deny
Church dignitaries, in agony you'll die!
