In the countryside, where you're looking for seclusion
There is a mansion where ghosts wait for their retribution

An abandoned orphanage, once left in ruins
Became a death trap for so many kids

When the curtain of night falls on the orphanage
They're coming from beyond to steal your soul
From the other side they are still watching
Listen closely, you can hear them scream

One gruesome night, the orphanage was set ablaze
The kids in the dorm room, eaten by the flames

Who was the arsonist?
What a horrific sight, small bodies in charred beds

The noises heard at night
That's not the wind
They'll haunt the living to take revenge in the end
To find peace at last
