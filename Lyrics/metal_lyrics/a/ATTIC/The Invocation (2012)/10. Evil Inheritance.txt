Under the cloudless nightsky
I returned to my secret lair
A hidden place in castle ruins

The wolfs are howling tonight
The stars align, the perfect time

To celebrate a rebirth of evil
To unleash Hell's forces again
Tonight I found the way to the hidden crypt
And to the vicious treasure kept in it

A hoof written in blood, bound in human skin
I found the key to omniscience
With pages so unholy, I put my curse on this world
Lucifer I'll follow your decree

High priest of the unholy
Reveal your lore to me
I'm faithful to the princes of hell

To the North, South, East and West
I conjure up familiar demons
To crush the weak, my wrath is on fire

I desecrate your frail guardian angels
I'll unleash Hell's forces again
Tonight I found the way to the hidden crypt
And to forbidden knowledge kept in it

Evil, reveal your darkened secrets
Evil, may the infernal flames crush the saint
Satan, I obey to you master
Evil, reveal your darkened secrets to me
