My time, your face in her eyes
Are scenes Iâm familiar with
Long night in thoughts and my heart is yours
But my hands are feeling her

Out time and your luster in my eyes
Iâm not gonna blame myself
Itâs you tonight but tomorrowâs het I wanna
Youâll never learn what Iâve done

I can simply lie to you and I really do
You can buy all I want as your faith in me is strong

As you sleep I have the time I need
Youâre the one I can love
So why itâs hard to stop lying even if you dream
Even if you cannot se me?
