Thereâs freedom, peace and silence
All of my senses I hold in my hands
No-one and nothing makes my run
A million of glances I place in the sky

Above thereâs space - a front thatâs unknown
There we wake up and fall asleep
Dawn is my Muse, dusk is the travel
My every breath the new pictures uncovers

When the red sky collapses like one of huge rocks
And my breath gets shorter
I donât want to flee the things already planned

I want freedom but I fear one day only
The day Iâm gonna lose you
And will still have to go on

No more love I want to accept in this form
You canât go away - donât let me lose you!
