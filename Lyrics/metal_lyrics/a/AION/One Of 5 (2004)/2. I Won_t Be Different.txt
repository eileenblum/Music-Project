Whatâs the life â youâre asking me today
Just the waiting for another day
What I shall expect from the day to come
Bit of bliss in my mind

What is was you know it was, what it will be
Iâm just over here which you all can see
Thatâs what lifeâs all about and you canât
Turn it round
I donât care they say my place is there

Tell me please what is this?
Another piece of the broken glass
And the question is emerging in my mind
If they will ever make up one some time

I donât look back, I chase every blaze
Here I am running in spite of my fall
Live is so short but longer canât be
If you are able - be everywhere

The door is open wide
So what you could walk inside
