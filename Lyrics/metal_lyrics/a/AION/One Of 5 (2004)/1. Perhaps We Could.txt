And youâre saying âYesâ again
When you want to say âNoâ
You say it peacefully
But in a while you shout
You have to ask someone else
As youâre afraid of asking me
Whether your question is important or not

I canât pretend any longer
I want to know everything
That the scenes in my film
Are only days and nights
Nagging me so much
Now I do what I want to

Unwavering and sleepy
Like a shadow to you
And you, seeing me powerless,
Like a diamond thorn
Stick into me everyday
In order to get out again
Do you think youâre a diamond?
Do you think youâre OK?

Perhaps an ultrasonic flight
Will leave the bad thoughts behind
Perhaps weâll finally get calm
And understand the time
Nagging me so much
Now I do what I want to

Whereâs our ANTIDOTE
That will break the hazy dream?
