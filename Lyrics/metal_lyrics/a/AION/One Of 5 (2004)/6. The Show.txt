Let the thorns of your greed be out of my sight
Donât get me involved in the trap of your hollow dreams
This is what I am - not a figment of your desires
Youâve been taking care about my imperfections for such a long time

Pain and dreams are only mean if I wanna fight and win
I am fighting with my tears, my weapon are my screams
Thorny paths to hearts as you often think of perfect love
Your cruel game you are playing with me ainât gonna stop

I have lost my way while walking up and up the steeply hill
Time to think of coming back to get some hope for life on track
You see me running after you, my breath is out the bridge is down
