This is a hopeless, unstable situation
You wanna do everything at once
You try very hard, your name is everywhere
But the authorities donât seem like you

As long as they know youâre weaker, you are OK
If they canât see you, they have a brighter day
They donât care communicating worse than they?

I met you today
And now we both believe itâs gonna happen
I met you today
And now we both believe!
