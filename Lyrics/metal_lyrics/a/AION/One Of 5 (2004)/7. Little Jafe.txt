Little Jafe is dancing on the waves of mist
Enchanting each day by herself
The storm which blows on her little wings
Is still with her

Little Jafe with her blood like a flowing lava
Sneering tango under the melting glaciers
The wind that made her spin around
Can also hurt with bits of night

Keep on dancing Little Jafe
Let your dancing little body
Makes us spin up to the sky
Till we reach the stars above us

The crazy flight over the oceans of souls
The crazy flight over the oceans of hearts
