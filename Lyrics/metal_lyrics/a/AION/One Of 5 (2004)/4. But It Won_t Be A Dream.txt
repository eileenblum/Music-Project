Where, they say, time has got its haven
And a brother found his happiness
Where a wind doesnât throw the dust of evil
And the hour-glass doesnât meter days

Hearts to hearts, stars to stars
There a soul meets another soul
Day by day, the moonlight charm
The beautiful glow of a million of years
Unreal but amazing us
No-one cheats any longer here
Everything like a dream
But we are gonna believe that!

Let me just for a while
See what your home is like

My hand is touching your temple
But no chance to feel the pulse
The world is running another way
Some say I can meet you there
Unreal but amazing us
No-one cheats any longer here
Everything like a dream
But we are gonna believe that!
