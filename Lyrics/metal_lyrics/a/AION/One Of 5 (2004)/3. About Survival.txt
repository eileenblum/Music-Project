Today I guess - Iâm fully neutral
Tomorrow youâll make me realize how far I was mistaken
Your eyes are not as clear as they used to be in old days
Iâm reading all from them - didnât you teach me that?
The corridor of light inflammable souls are rushing

As long as the world exists - let is give ourselves
As long as the sun exist - we have to survive!

You set your indestructible traps among my days
Trying to release myself - Iâm getting deeper
While praying, breaking wings, I beg you steadily
Yesterday I thought - Iâm free forever
