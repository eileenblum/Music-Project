You were talking me mum the story about my birth
You were talking about my first steps
You showed me good and bad people
You taught me what kind of man I should become
You didn't tell me that I loose it all someday

Now I know that we have to go by
I know that someday our children
Will take our places but thought about
Death doesn't let me dream peacefully
I'm afraid of entering to the bright tunnel

Now I know that we have to go by
I know that someday our children
Will take our places but thought about
Death doesn't let me dream peacefully
I'm afraid of entering to the bright tunnel

I love life I wish I stay always among my relatives
Thought about going by makes me shiver
I wish I forgot I didn't know
I keep praying for death forgets about us
I don't want to leave my relatives
I don't want to hurt them
I keep praying
