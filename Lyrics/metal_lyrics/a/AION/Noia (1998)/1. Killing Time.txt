Young fools drunk heroes Are
Writhing by my feet
The killing time has come
I'll do it it's high time to
Punish unfeeling killers and rapists
They'll feel ache !

I'm a ghost a Defender of Innocent
And Tormented creatures
I'm killing rapists of children and women
I'm murdering them with no mercy
I want them to feel like their victims

Ghost, revenge, killing time
Eternity...

When I get even with them all
When there is no cry fear and ache
I'll go away but remember young fools
I'll back immediately when I'll get the cry for help...

I'm a ghost a Defender of Innocent
And Tormented creatures
I'm killing rapists of children and women
I'm murdering them with no mercy
I want them to feel like their victims

Victim, Murder, Eternity...
