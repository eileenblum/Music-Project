Everything is so huge and incredible
When trees and houses lean over him
The boy thinks that these are pictures from a fairytale
His world is so magic and carefree

I wish these innocent pictures always
Reminds in his imaginations
Children's deserve for it

The boy can see everything differently
His world is beautiful and colourful
There is no everyday-dullness and
Uncertainty about tomorrow

I wish these innocent pictures always
Reminds in his imaginations
Children's deserve for it

So let's don't ever let the fear sneaks
In this world
It's a duty which sits on US-adults
Let's fulfill it

Let's don't ever let the fear sneaks
In this world
It's a duty which sits on US-adults
Let's fulfill it
