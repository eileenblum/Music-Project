I'm dying
I can see the sky full of stars and a shadow of death
Impenetrable black is surrounding me with every side
It's touching me with icy tentacles
I feel pain and fear my eyes full of tears

I feel ...

Help me to escape from this world full of pain
And suffering, tears and hate
Darkness is devouring me infinite abyss
There are no longer stars
Only emptiness and black
There's no longer pain and tears
There's only sadness left and fear
Still lays in wait somewhere

There's only ...

Can you help me ?
I wish escaped from this helpless existence
Please. help me !!!
