You're in trap a villain needs your blood
He wants to be your saviour by torments and sufferings
He wants to give you a freedom
The villain lusts for fulfilment today

You have never supposed that you
Find yourself someday in bad place
At bloody saviour
These Things never happen to us
Unfortunately you are this unhappy elect today

The bad place is in every nook of the world
Suffering and pain lives there
The villian lies in wait for you there

The bad place is in every nook of the world
Suffering and pain lives there
The villian lies in wait for you there

You know what nobody helps you
The villian will take care of it
He lust for drinking your sweet blood
In silence and peace

The bad place is in every nook of the world
Suffering and pain lives there
The villian lies in wait for you there

People will never grasp how much you suffer
