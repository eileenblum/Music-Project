The night is coming down, the sky is omnious.
The sun sank down below the horizon,
Gloomy darkness is wrapping the world,
In the moonlight among shadows,
You are leaving for the land of dreams
Suddenly you're opening your eyes
And you don't know if you slept or not.

It's so dark that you don't know,
For sure if your eyes are open,
After a while a sound is reaching you,
It's a woman's voice,
The voice is so clear and strangely dismal,
The words are fading in the air.

You feel the approaching death that's slowly
Embracing your body.
You look around and that
It's still dark everywhere

It's so dark thar you don't know,
For sure if your eyes are open,
After a while a sound is reaching you,
It's a woman's voice,
The voice is so clear and strangely dismal,
The words are fading in the air.
