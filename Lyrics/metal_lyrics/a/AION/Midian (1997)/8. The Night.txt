I'm quietly crying,
Nobody can see my tears,
Nobody can hear my sobs.

The night protects me from people's eyes,
The night is my only ally.
It silently listens to my complains,
And carefully wraps me up in its dark cloak,
It won't betray me.

The wind whispers words of comfort,
And delicately strokes my hair,
The rain cools my feverished body,
And streams down my face,
Washing tears off it,
And consoling me.

The night protects me from people's eyes,
The night is my only ally.
It silently listens to my complaints,
And carefully wraps me up in its dark cloak,
It won't betray me.

The night protects me from people's eyes,
The night is my only ally.

It silently listens to my complaints,
And carefully wraps me up in its dark cloak,
It won't betray me.
