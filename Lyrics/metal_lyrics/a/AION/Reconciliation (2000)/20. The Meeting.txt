I belive in unknown lands placed ages from here,
In other worlds staring at us, from the abyss of time.

I can see their star-shaped eyes
Warm and glowing to extreme
There the life pulsates

I feel no fear of the unknown
All I want is to know, to learn.
I can't think of anything else
I want to uncover
The mysteries of the universe for you.

When the desired moment of learning
Comes we'll become different people
The meeting with them will crown all
And the same time
Will end the epoch of loneliness
In the universe.
