I am guilty
I confess everything
I take the responsibility
for all the bad
I don't ask for mercy
though there must be someone
to be punished

I
sacrifice
myself
For wronged, ill-treated, murdered
of the whole world
I have courage to confess
I've done to help 'em!

I hope the great ones of this world
Will dream nightmares of their unknown victims
Maybe one day they will wake

Scared
in the middle of the night
they shall cry

I know no one sympathizes me
Let it be
I will be stronger when
the time comes to pay the price

I am guilty
I confess everything
