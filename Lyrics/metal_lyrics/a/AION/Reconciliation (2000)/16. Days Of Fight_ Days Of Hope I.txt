It was a great day, everybody saw it
It was beautiful light, great flash
Time as if it was standing still
I felt that everything had changed;
The angelic warmth embraced me;
Once again I was eager to live

I've seen the sign, Darling, it's time for me to leave.
Something calls for me
to safeguard our new life

The warmth that embraces me
Will enable me to face "it" woth courage.
The light will give me the power
To save our love.

"It" comes again and
It's stronger than ever before, they say.
Darling, I don't know what will happen with us.
I'm afraid...

The warmth that embraces me
Will enable me to face "it" woth courage.
The light will give me the power
To save our love.
