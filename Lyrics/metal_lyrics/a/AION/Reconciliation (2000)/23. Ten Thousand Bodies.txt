Ten thousand bodies
For two months the monsters called
Humans were getting into bloody slaughter
There was no one to stop them not to spoil
Their play. The monsters were devouring their
Victims accompanied by the sound of falling bombs.
That excited them even more.

Now, as shots calmed down ten thousand
Bodies are rotting, waiting for the day when
Their tormentors shall be judged.
I know the day will never come
As humanity turns slowly
Into unfeeling monstrosity.

Ten thousand bodies
Ten thousand victims
Ten thousand tortured ones
Ten thousand innocent ones
