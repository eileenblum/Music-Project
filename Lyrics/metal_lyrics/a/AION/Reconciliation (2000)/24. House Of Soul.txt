I want to speak of my house.
I want to reveal the image of my soul.
Sometimes when twilight falls, I can see
In the dark nooks of my house the unfinished
Matters, which I cannot solve

When I close my eyes I imagine beasts
Crawling out of the nooks of my house
They are my life, they thrive on my fear,
They frighten me.

When I open my eyes it gets bright again
"The beasts" disappear. My house is so beautiful,
My soul is so light and my conscience so clear.
So sad it is only an illusion
Because when twilight falls.
When I open...
