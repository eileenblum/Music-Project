Today I've understood what feels a man torn from hope
It is like taking the Earth all her flowers away
Today I uncovered loneliness for myself
It is like I have already not lived among you
Tomorrow I'll resurect heartbroken
Will the birds ever sing for me again?
Tomorrow in a mirror I'll see my new face
It will be the mask of grey
Tomorrow I'll resurect heartbroken
Will the birds ever sing for me again?
Tomorrow I'll resurect heartbroken
Will the birds ever sing for me again?
Tomorrow in a mirror I'll see my new face
It will be the mask of grey
Tomorrow I'll resurect heartbroken
Will the birds ever sing for me again?
Tomorrow I'll resurect heartbroken
Will the birds ever sing for me again?
