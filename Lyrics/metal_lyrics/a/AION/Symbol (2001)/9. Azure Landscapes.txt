I fly over the Earth very high
The sky vanishes, like mist, melts away
The colours change the the universe's image
I love this state, this hue of life
I lower the flight, sky opens it's gateway
I enter the legends' and the myths' ground
A glimpse of the answer - I do not believe
Azureis gateway shuts ordering to leave
Highest I am, with this splendid colour
There is no secret, mysteryis in here
I know the all azure landscapes' stories
I bear on the Earth the expected news
The expected news [x2]
