He could do nothing, was so defenceless,
Grief only and teardrops on face remained
In a cold cell black angel rests - the mother
Does not cry, cold as ice, which iced up
Tiny limbs of her son
Time is eternity, punishment supreme
Black angel slowly crushes the ice
Shiver, feeling it's state
In the dark cell dancing shadows
Remind of lost little figure
Sudden cold breeze skims sleeping mother's forehead,
In darkness scream resounds
You have to forgive, to wipe tears, to love
You have to kill, to hurt, to hate
You have to forgive, to wipe tears, to love
You have to kill, to hurt, to hate
You have to forgive, to wipe tears, to love
You have to kill, to hurt, to hate
You have to forgive, to wipe tears, to love
You have to kill, to hurt, to hate
