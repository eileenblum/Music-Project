In the gloom there's whisper of water
Flowing among the stones. The river is black.
When you bend your head
In a glimpse you can see a sad face
It's fading and then your face appears
Sink into the ebony current of Acheron
Cross to the other side
The river cuts the world into halves
On one side live those who believe in lies
On the other - those who believe
That the light is not everything.
There he is...
Sink into the ebony current of Acheron
Cross to the other side
Sink into the ebony current of Acheron
Cross to the other side
Sink into the ebony current of Acheron
Cross to the other side
Sink into the ebony current of Acheron
Cross to the other side
