Passion that I bestow on you is like narcotic ravishment
You're smouldering body and inner flame
Craving chains me and I can't leave burned with your look and slaved
I see your face sucking out and wasting my strength
I give you myself, that's my final word
I just love to be beside you, goddes of fervour and queen of the world
Please don't ever let me be waken up and keep me looking at your face
Love me my queen to the end of the world
I give you myself, that's my final word
I just love to be beside you, goddes of fervour and queen of the world
