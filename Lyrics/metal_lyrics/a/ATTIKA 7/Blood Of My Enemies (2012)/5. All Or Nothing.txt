Picking up all the scattered pieces
Hate and chaos are my best friends
Spill your blood Iâm a primal breed
Iâll kill you all for all your *****in greed
Life is a war
Iâll fight to the death
Defend my own with all my blood
Rearranging all the pieces
Itâs one for all and all or nothing
War torn world Iâm never lyinâ down
Itâs one for all and all for everything
Judge and jury are the noose
Of the hangman
Lock and load âem only the strong
Will survive
War Torn World
Iâm never Lying down
