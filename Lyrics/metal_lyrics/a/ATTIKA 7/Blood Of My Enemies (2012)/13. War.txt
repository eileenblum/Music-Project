I love war and destruction
It fills the need my dysfunction
I crave the carnage of battle
And slaughter people like cattle
At night I caress my A.K.
Spill the blood of my enemies by day
The smell of battle excites me
I deliver death for a small fee
WAR
My kind have been here for ages
Weâre always fought for our wages
GENOCIDE JUSTIFIED
As long as youâre on the right side!
WAR-WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?
FREEDOM
WAR-THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR...
BELIEVE IT
WAR-KILL CUZ YOUR NOT LIKE ME
ITS MY DIVINE RIGHT TO SET YOU FREE
Into the battle
Honor and pride
Blood, guts, and dollars
Brothers by our sides
For God and glory
Defending family
Gunfight for freedom
Destroy the enemy
Pure absolution
Turned inside out
No resolution
Who knows what itâs all about?
WAR
