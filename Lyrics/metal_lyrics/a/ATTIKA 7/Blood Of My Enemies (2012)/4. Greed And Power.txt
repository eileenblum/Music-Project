Day by day they spin the lies
Their puppets speak control they seek
Our guns for hire we built the fire
Weâre on this freight train in the fast lane
Greed and power man of the hour
Closed minds are blinded eyes
Driven by a sense of false pride
Spouting wind to no end
Iâve heard it all before
In a different skin
Fortress built and money burns
Melting pot of hatred churns
Walls stand high block out the sun
All things pure abandon
Greed- and power- man of the hour
Spiral down money it burns
Melting pot of hatred churns
Fortress walls block out the sun
Nowhere to hide
and nowhere to run
