Smoke your last cigarette
While the tide is burning
Sheâs stoking up the fire
With all her needles and things
Set in stone I wonât reform
Silent anger hidden in the storm
I was dead but now Iâm reborn
And the world keeps changing
Your pain has turned you grey
Are you still breathing
When you wake up from your dream
And realize weâre just dying
Weâre all just dying
Weâre all just , dying slowly
They play with my imagination
All the thoughts in my head
Happiness comes and it goes
Like the bitter end my friends
Stripped down of everything
But never laughing burden
When youâre given all youâve got to give
How do you fix what is broken?
We stomp the beast to this mother*****er
Its always been around
See all the little pieces
All spread out on the ground
Donât need to hear the shit
The way you run your mouth
Weâre dying , were dying, were dying
Weâre all just dying
Weâre all just , dying slowly
