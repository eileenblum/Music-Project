In this world of tortured souls
Incarcerated livin like moles
Never know you might be next
To wear a number on your fuckin chest

No redemption only a cell
No redemption you get what youâre dealt
No redemption youâre living in hell
No redemption

You try to live your kind of life
Free to work free of strife
But there are those the ones in control
Who own it all including your soul

You scratch and fight your way to the top
Watchin your back just stay on track
Youâve got eyes in the back of your head
Slip up once and youâll wind up dead

Thereâs no distinction
Day and night
No hope just pain and fear
Darkness without light
Despair and agony
Each moment is killing me
Time my enemy
Revenge will set me free
