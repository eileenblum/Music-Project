Hollow eyes betray empty lives
Hellbound-coming unwound
The time has come-no place to run
*****inâ with a loaded gun
In due time your soul is mine
Take you down to fire lake
We started all the damn fires hate
Weâll stomp you stomp you down in the ground
Weâll stone you take us up feel the hate
Weâre hellbound ***** with us burn it down
The end is near the reaperâs here
Youâre gonna burn reap what you earn
Get what you deserve
Accept your fate â itâs mine to take
And yours to taste
Next stop goinâ down fire lake
We started all the damn fires hate
Weâll stomp you stomp you down in the ground
Weâll stone you take us up feel the hate
Weâre hellbound ***** with us burn it down
HELLBOUND DESIRE
The time is here, your soul is mine
Hellbound Desire
Straight down
Hellbound
