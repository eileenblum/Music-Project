Got something to tell you
You listen to me
Living in oppression is not being free
The greedy amongst us sold out long ago
For the almighty paycheck
They live the status quo

The strongest chains you make
Could never hold us down
They try to oppress us
You didnât know we werenât fucking around

They chain and oppress us
As the masses sit mute
When will they stand up
Against the corporate suits
As we sit idle
The juggernaut rolls
Afraid to resist it
Weâre just pathetic souls

LOST SOULS DIE
RESIST THE LIES
LIVE FREE FIGHT
PROTECT THE RIGHT

FREEDOM
FREEDOM
FREEDOM
FREEDOM RING
