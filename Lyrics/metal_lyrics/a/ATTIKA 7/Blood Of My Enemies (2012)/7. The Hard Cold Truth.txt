What would you do?
If everyone you knew turned their back on you.
For something that wasnât true,
And point their fingers at you.
For something that you didnât even do,
Something that didnât even have anything to do with you
When deep inside you always knew
the hard cold truth
But the ones who claimed to be your friends
never ever really down with you till the end
But now you know just what is true
The bull shit and lies you can see right through
Because the truth in their eyes speaks to the deepest part of you
'Cause deep inside you always knew
That this faÃ§ade ain't nothing new
That all the jealously hatred and lies
That the truth about themselves is what they really despise
They dream your fall will help them to rise
But itâs only the truth they really despise
Only shame on you for acting surprised
Because in the end the truth will ultimately be their demise
Because their eyes are blinded by the darkness of their own lives
Ignorance and fear hides behind the guys of acting wise
But the truth
The truth can set you free
Because there is no justice
And there is no peace
Accused by your peers
Sentenced by your fears
Condemnation beyond comprehension
Because there is no justice and there is no redemption
