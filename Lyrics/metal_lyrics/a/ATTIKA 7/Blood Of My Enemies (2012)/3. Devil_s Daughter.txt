Blood on my hands
she comes to wash the pain away
with a snake bite kiss
and The darkness of her gaze
God knows Iâm to blame
Will I ever be the same?
Nightmares my reality
Not even death can set me free
Forgotten souls they pray for me
Blood on my hands eternally
Iâm in Love with the devilâs daughter
I can Taste her voodoo
Makin Love with the devils daughter
Shes no good for you
Will I make it out alive?
Spin the wheel just to survive
Upon my grave she waits for me
Burning my soul eternally
Iâm in Love with the devilâs daughter
she comes to steal my dreams
Makin Love with the devils daughter
Sweet pain of her darkness screams
Iâm in Love with the devilâs daughter
Shes got me under her spell
Makin Love with the devils daughter
She welcomes me to hell
Darkness surrounds me
Four walls are closing in
Shattered dreams escape the fear
Turn deeper to her sin
Then I hear her call my Name
Will I ever be the same?
Iâm in Love with the devilâs daughter
she comes to steal my dreams
Makin Love with the devils daughter
Sweet pain of her darkness screams
Iâm in Love with the devilâs daughter
Shes got me under her spell
Makin Love with the devils daughter
She welcomes me to hell
