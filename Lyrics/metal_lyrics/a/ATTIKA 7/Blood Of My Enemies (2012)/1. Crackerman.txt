Curse the day that we're all born
lives are ripped and souls are torn
first weâre Assimilated,
humiliated till weâre all dead
I donât need no reason
I stand for what I believe in
***** you and all your consequence
The day Iâm dead is the day that Iâll repent
Ride on Crackerman
Ride on ride on
Ride on Crackerman
Ride defy the world
I walk the road to my own End
Ill never break ill never bend
My enemies will never get the best of me
I fight and die to live and ride free
What you say means nothing to me
The ground is soaked with the
Blood of my enemies
Lights flash from the barrels
Of my 12 gauge
Iâm cutting down anything
Up in my face
