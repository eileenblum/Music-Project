Lockdown incarcerated isolated
Rotting away
Dying in this hell hole losing control
Smell decay
Evil consuming has possessed me
Iâm out of my head
Darkness surrounds me itâs lurking
Deep in my soul
Everybody on your face
Everybody down
ainât nobody
Sayinâ nothing
In this world of hate of pain
Karma comes around
Weâre Locked down,
Were LOCKED DOWN !
Lockdown- Humiliated -suffocated
Wasting away
Trying- to maintain -my sanity
Am I going insane?
Payback -fuels the fires -of hatred
Thats Burning my soul
I just â gotta hang on-cuz Revenge-
Is best served cold
Everybody on your face
Everybody down
ainât nobody
Sayinâ nothing
In this world of hate of pain
Karma comes around
Weâre Locked down,
Were LOCKED DOWN !
Bridge
There was a time when I was sane
Thought Iâd see freedom had much to gain
Then the things I once held close
Then theyâd hit me with another dose
At first I fought it I tried to resist
Wouldnât let âem cuff me
Beat âem with my fist
In the end my will worn thin
Lost my mind gave in to the sin
