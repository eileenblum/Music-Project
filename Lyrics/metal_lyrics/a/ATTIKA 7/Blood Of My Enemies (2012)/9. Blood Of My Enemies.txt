Bodies fall around me,
Itâs the pleasure of pain,
Pushed too far over the edge
There is a war inside my brain
Like a freight train outta control
Blinded by rage I just see red
Iâm a time bomb about to explode
never gonna stop until youâre dead
to all the fakes who turn their backs
jealous haters always on the attack
I trusted you I thought we were friends
But I guess its shame on me in the end
Just how much can one man take?
Keep it coming cuz I wont break
A brothers vow is down for life
Behind my back I feel your knife
The blood of my enemies
spill the blood of my enemies
I smell your fear from here
I saw you turn and run
You disrespected me
Made me a loaded gun
You *****ing hypocrite
I see right through your shit
youâll never get the best of me
spill the blood of my enemies
Revenge never tasted so sweet
