I feel the comin urge
Iâm gonna destroy
I canât control myself
Not since I was a boy
Adrenalineâs building up
Iâm gonna cause you pain
I ainât got no mercy
Somebodyâs goinâ down in a fit of Rage
Demons controlling me
My demons the things Iâve seen
Demons now youâre bleeding
Somebodyâs goinâ down in a blood stain
The voices telling me
Somebodyâs gonna die
My demons woken up
The fires burninâ high
The killer deep inside me
Has broken out
I ainât got no mercy
Somebodyâs goin down in a fit of RAGE
By dawn tomorrow somebodyâs gonna die
I canât help myself
Donât even ask me why
Demons are stirring up
Somebodyâs goin down
I ainât got no mercy
Somebodyâs goin down in a fit of RAGE
The things Iâve seen
ATTIKA
SERIAL KILLER
