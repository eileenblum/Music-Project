A lifetime I have spent
watching over them
And I have seen them devolve

You'd think that they would learn
but truth be told...

They are truly a lower form of beasts
They will stop at nothing until they are pleased

Emotions won't affect their intellect,
a bloodtrail spatters all that's pure

They would walk through fire
just to satisfy their greed
They would betray their own kind
to fulfil their own twisted needs

The beast called man

I spent a lifetime trying
to find beauty within man

You'd think that I would learn
but truth be told...

They are the hungriest form of beasts
They will stop at nothing to pursuit their beliefs

Emotions won't affect their intellect,
a bloodtrail spatters all that's pure

We would walk through lava
just to satisfy our greed
We would betray our own kind
to fulfil our twisted needs

The beast called man

This is why my family died
This is why my childhood ended
To this day I can't deny
we'd all be better off dead

We are
the Beast called man

We are
the Beast called man

And now I aim to end us all...
