Ages ago in the deepest forest
I sold my soul to Satan
Boiling pure of hate within
to spread my guilt stained with sin

This life brought me nothing but pain
I wish to repay
Infect the world with the sorrow I felt
as I was cast into life without choice

I will not find peace in life or death
Forever I haunt you mortal souls
Crystals of tears fall from my eyes
when I think of the life I left behind

Eternal sleep won't reach me here
Floating soulless over the boundaries of death
Blue mist covering my path
where no mortal dare thread
