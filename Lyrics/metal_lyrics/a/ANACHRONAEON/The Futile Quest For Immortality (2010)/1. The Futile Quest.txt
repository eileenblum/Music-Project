You all wish that you could leave a trace
Oblivion will devour the human race

A tyrant dies, another tyrant takes the throne
A historic triumph is carved into a stone
Blood is shed to obtain domination
But Death is watching through the eyes of a future king

You all wish that you could leave a trace
Oblivion will devour the human race
The sun will die down - all will be lost
The achievements that you made at any cost

Behold! Your buildings are falling to the ground
Let this be told! Your head is removed without a sound
History repeats itself! Another tyrant claims your throne
Memento mori! Now you are nothing but a pile of bones

The lives you destroyed, the things you did
Was it worth a name in the human history
The life your lived, always watching your back
Paranoid - just waiting for the next attack

[Chorus:]
Dreams of greed will blind you
And know that Death will find you
Though mankind will never see
it's a futile quest for immortality

Your father died and you inherited his business
You feel you have to prove him wrong even in death
You treat your staff like shit, just to make an extra buck
You must be proud of what you have become

You all wish that you could leave a trace
Oblivion will devour the human race

Behold! Your empire is falling, your stocks are worthless
Let this be told! Your failure is documented in the press
History repeats itself! A ruthless businessman takes your place
Memento mori! In the end we'll all become a pile of bones

The lives you destroyed, the things you did
Was it worth a name in the human history
The life your lived, never looking back
Obsessed by proving yourself to your dad

[Chorus:]
Dreams of greed will blind you
And know that Death will find you
Though mankind will never see
it's a futile quest for immortality
