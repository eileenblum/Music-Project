There is something in my head
I see glimpses of it everywhere I turn
Recently it has grown stronger
forbidding me to feel at ease

It appears as twisted faces
on every reflecting surface
Sometimes it freezes the world
and everyone but me

And it calls for me at night
with voices of people that I since long left behind
In another life
In another town

In reoccurring dreams
it wants me to live it and feel it
over and over again
Things I've suppressed with time

The Darkness in the Corner of my Eyes
blocks out the sunlight in my life

The Darkness in the Corner of my Eyes
will never let me forget the things I did

I fear the shadows behind me
Driving faster on the road to madness
I cannot even relax when I'm drunk
and it's been long since I responded to pills

In reoccurring dreams
it wants me to live it and feel it
over and over again
Things I've suppressed with time

Staring down from the edge of a building
knowing that I created this monster
One free fall to end it all
One leap from washing the guilt away
