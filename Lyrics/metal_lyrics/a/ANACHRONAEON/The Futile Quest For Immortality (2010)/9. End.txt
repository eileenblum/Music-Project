Water
covering me

Reflections
below the surface

Just a few more breaths
to become one with the stream

I have fulfilled most of my dreams
by the measurements of society
Though the longing has always been stronger
than the final outcome

They all say this should be enough
But my spirit is longing for something else
The spark of life is fading
Could I find release if I turn away?

[Chorus:]
This is the end
I have given all I can
but I am through, my friend

The love we both feel
could never be a reason
to stay alive for me

All of my life I've struggled to fill this void
But it keeps eating and tearing

Life's colors are fading away
slowly to be replaced by nothingness

Today I feel like something has changed
A feeling of determination slowly taking form
A sudden urge to watch the sea
I can feel it calling and I'm longing

I want it to consume me
Take my body away
Release me from these chains of life
In oblivion I am free

I take one step into the sea
It chills me and satisfies me at the same time
I walk further out
The water caresses my neck

This is the end
I have given all I can
but I am through, my friend

The love we both feel
could never be a reason
to stay alive for me

All of my life I've struggled to fill this void
But it keeps eating and tearing

Life's colors are fading away
slowly to be replaced by nothingness

I just keep walking further and further
My head is all below the surface
Your face seems so clear to me
I walk towards your smile

I inhale, and close my eyes, I hear your laughter
and float away into the stream
Soon I'll cross the border between life and eternity
and I feel happy for the first time in years

Water
covering me

Reflections
below the surface

Just a few more breaths
to become one with the stream
