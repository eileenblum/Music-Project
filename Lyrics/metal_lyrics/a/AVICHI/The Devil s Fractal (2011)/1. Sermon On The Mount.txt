[Satan:]

Oh heart! How hardened hast thou become!
With ambitious aim thou hast forced thy spear upon creation
And persevered through the anguish thy hell hast brought forth!
The pressure of your pride hast hardened you beyond stone!

By these forces dost thou now radiate with thine own puissance
For now thou shines with the brillance of the greatest of diamonds
Burn in my breast; oh how the savior salivates in jealousy
Envious now are those who dwell in frivolous servility

For this is my kingdom, and here my will shall be done as it is in hell
Are not the fruits of my labors visible for all to see?
Hear how the spirit in man cries out in my divinity?
Consume them shall I; force all of life onto bended knee

My throne I erect upon the sins of mankind
A mountain great enough to reach the bliss of heaven
Oh heart! How hardened hast thou become!
Thy fire equaled by none; oh how the universe begins to mourn!
