[Man:]

"My spirit concealed descended into hell
There I beheld fallen angels treading on flaming fire

With blackened garments and robes;
Countenances graven and cold;
Sustained by the wrath of his pride;
There in the absence of light,
I beheld a throne of stone stained by the blood of human flesh
Upon it sat the Lord in a terrible splendour

Oh his face lied fixed a stare as cold as the bitterest wind
Falling to my knees in sheer terror the Lord raised me by his own hand

He brought me out to where was every secret of desire; every secret of sin
He showed me all the hidden things of the extremities of hell
All the receptacles of corruption and the splendours of all
From whence they went forth beneath his six glorious wings

Standing there upon the entrails of Humanity,
I beheld angels innumerable;
Thousands of thousands;
Myriads of myriads;
Surrounded by hell's majesty

There in the presence of his sacred flame,
My spirit became changed
I cried out blessing, glorifying, exalting!

Upon my brow a talon was laid and he exclaimed:"

[Satan:]

"From the beginning has my seed gone forth since the dawn of Creation
Holy is he who drinks from my tabernacle - the spirit of perdition
Glory shall be unto the righteous, and dominion shall the righteous pursue forever and ever."

[Man:]

"It was then every power in hell raised in united voice,
To bless, glorify, praise, and exalt with the spirit of his fire
With the spirit of pride,
The spirit of lust,
With the spirit of malevolence!"

[The Great Cacophony:]

"Blessed is he; and the name of the Lord shall be blessed forever and ever!
All the elect who here dwell defiant in hell; all angels and men shall bless him!"

[Man:]

"And the Lord sat upon the throne of his glory, and the void was poured over him
Open your eyes and lift up your horns if you are capable of comprehending HIM!"
