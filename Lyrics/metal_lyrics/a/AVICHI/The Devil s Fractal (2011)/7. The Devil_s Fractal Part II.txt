Lifeless and deathless;
Empty and non-being;
A bottomless void surrounds me
The ashes of a creation gone mad

An enlightening sacrifice,
More exceeding than the last
Oh how I never cease to expand,
The sum of the Devil's mass

Yet not all can be destroyed,
For I am beyond eternity
In the darkness of this final exhalation,
I consume myself back into my being

In the stillness of my awareness
I gloat in my illumination

It is in this state where I never fail to realize,
How disgusting it is to be whole within oneself
I will my attention elsewhere;
Spew forth a new vision of vanity
A cynical tear drops its reflection,
Into the region of manifestation
The Logos speaks the word
And emits vacuous creation
Tentacles in a veil of gloom,
Give birth to infinite perversion
An existence ensues from sadistic womb,
Weaving truths destined to become only lies

In the wake of disharmony,
A new devil drags his maker down with him
A fragment of himself passionately envious
Expressing itself in a new hall of empty depths

Once again the universe lies in ruins,
Left to death's design
By the grace of the abandoned crown,
In nothingness we all shall drown
