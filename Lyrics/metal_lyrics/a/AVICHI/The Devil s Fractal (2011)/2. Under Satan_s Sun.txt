[Mass:]

"Satan, maelstrom of malevolence, thine is this kingdom of sin
Glorious is the sceptre of your dominion

We descend into deepest dark matter,
(And) pulsate with the severity of Abyss

Father Satan there is no chain nor desert able to contain thee
Thy fierce stare sees all truths and lies; nothing escapes thy sight
Thy triumph in the Garden of Eden became thy greatest gift unto mankind

We eagerly eat the fruit of your wisdom,
(And) satiate our souls with the virtues of your being

We adorn ourselves in the black visage of your carnality
In your wisdom our souls have become enfumed for all eternity
Reveal to us the pathway of redemption littered with the bodies of heavenly hosts

Great Satan, father of sin, we burn within thy clandestine blaze
You whose word spreads as a plague
You who wears the crown of black flame
We humble ourselves before your ability to destroy in thine own image
We feed upon the tears thy desolation ceaselessly reaps
We align ourselves to your power
We revel in the eternal fire
Our souls we give unto you to consume and emit from your being
as flies from lust's womb

Are not the sins of man truly without number?
Is not the glory of man attributed unto the virtues of sin?
Let us slither further into this denseness under the dawning of the sun of Satan
Here beneath the luminous boil in the grey air yearning for what radiates from him in contamination
Oh manifestation of the Most High, embrace us - the fractals of your own vanity."
