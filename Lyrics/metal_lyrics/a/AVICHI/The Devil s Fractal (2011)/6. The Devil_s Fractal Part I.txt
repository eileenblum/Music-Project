Indeed I suffer wholeheartedly,
Embracing the abyss in absolute devotion
My good deed for eternity - my defiance of integration
Bliss failed to content me in its submission,
So I fall into hells ever greater in torments
A maelstrom of evil bleeding hatred ever the more fierce
In the abyss I lie alone as the sum of wickedness
Utterly beyond redemption, as god surely must know,
my unconquerable will is the highest emanation
The weak doth perish in collective delusion,
Unable to suffer my halls of damnation
The incense of darkness burns on the altar of privation
Burn!
Self-inflamed!
Rise!
Etheric flames!

Within these flames I rise above the
firmament of heaven,
And gaze upon the profundity of existence
Such emptiness without resolvement
Such misery woven into the fabric of its reality
I rise to meet my maker
Approaching him in all own gruesomeness
In the wake of my presence,
God stares into me
The abyss consumes his sight
Vehemence wastes away his light
The face of god fades in the self-realization of chaos
Lucifer's gaze leaves heaven in a blaze

A Eucharist is served on a bed of worms,
Consecrating lifeless space
The Logos dissipates into oblivion
A proper resting place for an impoverished ideal
Messenger of darkness sound your horn!
You have paved the path to emptiness,
Leaving god to gnaw upon his essence
In the cold...
In the dark...
I am his cold...
I am his dark...
