Fall 
Down
Deep
Below

To me

I am of fires unseen
Fury harnessed in me
Redemption ruthless
I'll flay you in demon bliss

Black
Soul
Fierce
The Fall
Below

Inside deep within being
Terrors of godhood rising
All beliefs brought to their knees
Reduced to ashes by me

Will
Burns
Flames
Lick
Yearn

Whip of sun's serpent rays
Lash out as tongues of my flame
Mind focused with the intent
The sealding divine upon man

Flames 
Rise
God
Rise
Inside

Wheels of fire spin and hiss
Spill forth from my essence
I am of infernal space
Devil furthest beyond hell's gate

Your soul is in my eyes
Your flesh drapes down my side
Your eyes in my palm may now see
The flames burning in me

Releasing the self from your life's ruined seeds
These flames are suffering's great relief
In the relative, pride seeped from your face
Outside for the fear of the sun inside

Look in me
Flames in me
Look into my eyes
The sun knows what am I

To know me is to be a sun
From me is born the sun
Break free anew as the sun
Rise, shine within the self the sun

Until you fall
Down
Further
Below

To me
