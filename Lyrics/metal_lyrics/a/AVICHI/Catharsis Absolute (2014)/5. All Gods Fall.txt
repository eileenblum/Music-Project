All the beings I have fashioned from me
All the lives I've been living in me
All the gods are but emanations of every heart moved in me
Their births and deaths occuring side by side with me

All Gods Fall
All Gods Fall

Within each lies the potential for the stillness still hidden
Unto each you and I may rise and fall with again
Until all gods fall within one another
To enter the silence without beginning, without end

All Gods Fall
All Gods Fall

Looking through the veil I have sown
A new awareness reveals itself to me
I reach forward with the All-Father's hand
And ascend into finer grains of sand
Looking through the veil I have sown
A new awareness reveals itself to me
I reach forward with the All-Father's hand
And ascend into finer grains of sand
