Attuned with mists of solemn sage
Chiseled by winds rising from pain

Creep in me moss of the inner world
Blood of mountains coalesce with my being

Speak in me
Black magick being
Guide to me
White light mastery

Synchronized with the word of my soul
The only truth worthly of being known

Speak in me
Black magick being
Guide to me
White light mastery

Listless foul
My touch unnatural
Illusion covered
Smothered being
Shedding these remnants
Of the kiss bestowed
Emitting sick cursed throne

Deconstruct me to the roots
I no longer need a voice to wound

Speak in me
Black magick being
Guide to me
White light mastery

Step into the temple when you reach
The multi-universe everlasting
I am you guiding myself unto itself
The power of the planes
Reverent from age
Flowing through you and all of space
