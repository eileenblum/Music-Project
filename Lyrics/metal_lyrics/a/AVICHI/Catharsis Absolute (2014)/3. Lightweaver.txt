Within your sleeps
Dawn of divine being
Embrace the storm
Life provides what you need
Feel your light
And the heart will then bleed
When empty of lies
Your light will weave in me

Break away
The higher self becons
Not far away
Closer into the dark
Dissolve away
Into inner space
Senses escape
The binds of dismay
From my view a slave
Is a chance to perceive
A life beyond this world
Lost in dreams
Transcend your hate,
Your love, your belief
Will into being
All that is, was, and is to be

Lightweaver
In the light I breathe
Lightweaver
In the space between dreams
Lightweaver
By my light I'll find you
Lightweaver
In your Catharsis Absolute

Within your sleeps
