Your aura is black with malice
Descend beyond to the pit of utter hatred

Feel the pull of the Eighth Sphere
Become blessed with the ashes of death
There in the face of nothingness
You see the emptiness within yourself

Purification within the eighth sphere
Purification within the eighth sphere

Frozen by the cold winds of the abyss
Pulsating holocaustal misery
Flagellated by a thousand thorns
I am crowned in purity

AMEN
