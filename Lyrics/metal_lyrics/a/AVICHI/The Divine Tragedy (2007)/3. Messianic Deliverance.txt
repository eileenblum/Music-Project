My body swims across the abyss
A magnificent shadow of temptation
Demonic beings congregate around my fury
The profound evil arouses so many

Hatred ... a gift that keeps on giving ...

Redemption has come for those who lived in my name
For I have returned from the dark chasm

Sheep are led to the slaughter
Their shepherd has returned
Upon the cross I sacrifice myself
Inverted over the multitude in pain

My flock drowning in blood
Red poison burning their lungs
Eternal screams never to be heard
Behold the light of truth

The entrance into hell lies through me
For I am the savior that you seek

Messianic deliverance
