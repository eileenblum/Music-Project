Immersed ever deeper into flesh
I rise as a temple to ruin
My soul suffocates as I engross myself
My third eye coagulates in lurid lechery

Pleasures only increase my appetite
Entangled  to the pollution I create
Corrupting the universe as I corrupt myself
Self-realization through self-annihilation

Baptized by the sacred whore
Flesh cleansed in the great despair
Thrusting my hatred into another victim
Behold the apex of destruction

Insinuate the lotus of creation
Consecrate the violated orfice

As the serpent descends into hell
Sin continues to evolve through my sufferings
I meditate upon my anguish in Avichi
Enlightened by a halo of semen
