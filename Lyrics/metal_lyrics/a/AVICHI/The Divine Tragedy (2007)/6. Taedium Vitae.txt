Disappear from this world
No longer interested in its destiny
No longer interested in human reason
Grown weary of so much living

God continues to evolve through mental paradigms
Time for eradication of this shell
No longer interested in this existence
Perhaps god is also weary of his

Life continues to decieve itself
Nothing left for love to feed upon
No longer present among you
Only a shade of my previous self

Since my spirit may not find rest
I will inflict my pain upon everything in creation
I will bring you and the world into greater disharmony
I will show you how far decay can take you

No reason left to protect this great mistake
No reason to be abandoned by another womb
You may cower assured I will take you with me
Into the void to disintegrate your soul

[Dedicated to Emile M. Cioran]
