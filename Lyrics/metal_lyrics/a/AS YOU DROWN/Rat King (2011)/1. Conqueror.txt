Stuck in endless repeat
Mere actors in this play
Drinking bile from the same fountains
Wading on through shit

Forever chasing the phantom
But never catching it

All that you desire, that you believe
Will be swept away
The great void is calling your name

For now amid the mimic rout
A crawling shape intrude
A blood-red thing that writhes from out
The scenic solitude

It writhes! It writhes! And seraphs weep
Bleed! Die! Screaming on your knees

Its hunger is eternal, as it eats away
Devouring all that ever was and will be
Conquering our fate

All the liars, all the puppets
Will be just dirt in the ground

Out! Out! Out are the lights
No hope! Everything dies

Out! Out! Out are the lights
No hope! Everything must die
