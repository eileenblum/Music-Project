Dead harlots come closer now!
Give your flesh to me
I'll drink from your disease-filled cunts
These ketamine nightmares and frozen crack cocaine eyes
Are all great friends of mine
(but nothing burns as bright as this)

Darkness closing fast, on this puppet made to hang
Pitch black tunnel opens wide, grins with sharpened teeth
You don't know what I am
Peel the plastic skin to reveal the putrid mess beneath

Deeper into nothing, a futile endless game
The twisted scent of treason, fingers spark - synthetic flame

The final consequence
Of this failure to connect
We offer up our souls, at the altar of the night

Rotting piece by piece
The worm is bursting at the seams
In the cold grip of your warm flesh, finally revealed
In powders, pills, ungodly juices - oblivion incarnate
A serpent in the shadows - aching for release

And as the veil does fall
A violent retreat
Deeper into you, into the nothing

The final consequence
Of this failure to connect
We offer up our souls, at the altar of the night

This is the end of suffering
This is the end of all dreams
We offer up souls, at the altar of the night
