Fools!
Short-sighted greedy fools, destroying our world
They will do anything for green, spineless bastards
Crooked poison fingers, infecting all things
Bleeding the planet dry - blood for oil, death to all life

Bleeding structure, falling down
What will you profit from when nothing can survive?
Bleeding structure, falling down

Psychotic rampant fools, they're raping the world
They will do anything for green, spineless bastards
Crooked poison fingers, infecting all things
Bleeding the planet dry - kill all life, kill for profit

Bleeding structure, falling down
What will you profit from when nothing can survive?
We drown in rivers of shit
