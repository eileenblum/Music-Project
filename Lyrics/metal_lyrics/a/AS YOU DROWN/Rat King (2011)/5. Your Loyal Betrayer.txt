Ashen, hollow yesterday souls
Flashing cyanide smiles
Nothing left to show but a back full of knives
And there's only one reprieve, one final doorway
Only one way out

The only escape is the one that I offer
Just one little push is all that you will need to be mine forever

Twisted child of mine - you're nothing without me
Concubine - my hallowed needle again, stabbing the vein
Chemical burns, ashen skin - my mark is eternal
You will never be free

Savour me, never abandon me
Or you'll suffer
With mindless grin, speak to the god in me

I am the white, your loyal betrayer
I am the stars, the light in your eyes
I am your cage, the walls that surround you
I am the one who makes you crawl

Dead hollow yesterday souls
Flashing cyanide smiles
Nothing left to show but a back full of knives

The only escape is the one that I offer
I'm your one way out

I am the white, your loyal betrayer
I am the stars, the light in your eyes
I am your cage, the walls that surround you
I am the one who makes you crawl
