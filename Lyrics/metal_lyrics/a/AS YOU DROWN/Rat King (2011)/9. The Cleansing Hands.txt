Cold metal goddess - deathly perfection
Connecting everything
A new beginning, visions untold
The flesh dethroned

The final step...
Tentacles breach, humanity kneels
Burrowing deeper - the cleansing hands

Rising majestic, bathed in a sea of blood
Consciousness reborn, to touch the stars above

Steel arms of heaven - thrusting damnation
Fucking the bleeding wound
A new beginning - visions unfold
Death to the old

Let all connect...
Every hole filled, with cold gleaming drills
Burrowing deeper - the cleansing hands
Erasing, rebuilding - the cleansing hands

Perverse alliance, the end of all
No soul required, as part of the machine
A fractured echo, a ghost of our past
Is all that remains after the cleansing hands

All songs written by Mikael ÃkerstrÃ¶m (music) and Henrik Blomqvist (lyrics)
