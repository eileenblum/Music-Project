They see the light of dawn
And waste away
They have no own free will, they are nothing

Puppets on the master's string
They are slaves to the kingdom of fear

Their stench is revolting
Their minds are unplugged
Little sheep walk in line, laughing their way to the slaughter
They are the loathsome product of this imprisonment

Eyes - devoid of all natural light
Souls - nowhere to be seen
Man - spiralling down the abyss
Governed only by fear

Bent over in silence
To welcome their king
They're whimpering cattle, slaves to the kingdom of fear

Don't want any part of this thing that they call life
Six billion willing servants, succumbing to the blight
Cattle! Bastards! Whores! With my dying breath I'll curse you
Slaves to the kingdom of fear

Eyes - devoid of all natural light
Souls - nowhere to be seen
Man - spiralling down the abyss
Governed only by fear
