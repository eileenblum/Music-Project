You tell us you're different, say that you've changed
No! same old deceivers, the same old chains

Rabid wolves in sheep's clothing
Telling nothing but lies
Shit-eating grins, pitch black eyes

There is nothing that's "new"
About what you do
It's ancient, archaic - barbaric and cruel

Robbing the poor and harassing the sick
Taking what little they have
Treacherous vultures, feast on the carcass
Of all that we used to be

Everything's going down - falling apart
Everything's going down - back to the start

There is nothing that's "new"
About what you do
It's ancient, archaic - barbaric and cruel

Robbing the poor and harassing the sick
Taking what little they have
Treacherous vultures, feast on the carcass
Of all that we used to be

Raping! Selling our soul
The bastards are forcing us down

So...tell me, how do you sleep?
How does it feel?
To kick a man when he's down, to prey on the weak...
