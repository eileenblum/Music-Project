This urge, duct-tape and the barrel
Of a gun
Crowbar slaughter, a six-inch knife
To run you through

When I awake, from the silence
Of dreaming
Splinters of bloodstained glass
Burst inside my head

Faceless and scarred
Dig the hole and bleed you dry
Faceless god of bleeding scars
Dig the hole - Open Wound Salvation

Cyanide saviour, fractured soul
Nine millimeter redemption -
Open Wound Salvation
