We'll put an end to this oppression,
Tonight we'll tear it away
There ain't no peace - 'til we rip off
The roof and resume desecration

And this outburst
Never did come across the eyes

Do not rewind
Take the needles away
Increase the dose
That gave us reflection

The lines are written in the mind
And all the bitterness
Came to crash it down
We're all trying to find the peace
To purge the emptiness,
To fill this void

Don't look back, nothings left
From the world of our past
There ain't no peace,
Do not rewind - Just let it ... burn!

Do not rewind
Take the needles away
Increase the dose
That gave us reflection
