The eraser of all things,
The black hole that lives inside
Is it salvation or disease?
With every single move,
With every single breath
It wipes away all life in sight

A darkness lives in me
And it is ever-feeding, ever-growing
A darkness lives in you
And it will swallow all...

This is where I grew wings

All I thought I had, all I thought I was
Now gives in to...
An unstoppable force, devouring it all
To bring an age of nothing

A darkness lives in me
The time has come to redefine...

This is where I grew horns

The eraser of all things,
The black hole that lives inside
My beautiful disease
