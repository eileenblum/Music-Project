Soaring into blackness
Into a screaming sky

Sever the ties of reality
Dissolve all self-control
Swallow and disappear
The liquid will drown all your fears

Deny tomorrow - Delete yesterday
Patterns repeating - Forever the same

Number every moment
Remembering how to fly
Number every moment
And not afraid to die

Sever of the ties of reality
Dissolve all self-control
Until we fade from view
And disappear into the cold
