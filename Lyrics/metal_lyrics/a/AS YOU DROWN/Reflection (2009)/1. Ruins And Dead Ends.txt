King of ruins, master of dead ends
Didn't even break, just slowly bend
Carve me a smile, as I ... slip away

Nothing seems to seep through
No Impacts made, no voices heard
And all that I can do
Is wait here for the end

Something is holding me down
Something is holding me down
My head below the waterline

Sinking faster now
Falling to the end
Sinking faster now
It all fades as I descend

Watch me fall ... down!
Nothing seems to seep through
No Impacts made, no voices heard
And all that I can do
Is wait here for the end

My head below the waterline
