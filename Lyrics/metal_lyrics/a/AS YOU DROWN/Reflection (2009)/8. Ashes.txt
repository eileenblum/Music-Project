We'll erase what you've created
We'll take back the breath you stole

What you call civilization
Swiftly turned to dust
The ashes of your nations
Paint the sky

And as it all falls down...
From above - No answers

Useless civilization
Swiftly turned to dust
The ashes of your nations
Paint the sky

You have no purpose here
There is no law
We are what you most fear
We are the pure
