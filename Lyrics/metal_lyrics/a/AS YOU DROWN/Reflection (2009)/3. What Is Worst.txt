Our blood begins to boil
You're measured down to low
Now ask yourself - what is worst?

Hated. Spit on...
Measured down to low is what you are
We bring it to a new state

We are who we are
No need to bring this on
Oh, lowest of the low
You've stained me far too long

You think we've gone too far?
Then ask yourself what is worst

What you don't understand...
What you don't understand is this

It all keeps fading away
But as soon as it's gone, it comes back
Our blood begins to boil
But our eyes. They are still cold

You thought we'd gone too far
What you don't understand -
What you don't understand is this...
