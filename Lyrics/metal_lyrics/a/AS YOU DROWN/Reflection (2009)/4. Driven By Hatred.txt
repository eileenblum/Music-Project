Deceitful kind, I wash my hands of you
Tried to let go, but you've failed me
Once again
All I have left - hate. Regret ... And spite
I'll watch you drown in your own filth

When your towers and temples
All slowly crumble...
And fall to the ground
When the skies are falling
You'll see me smile...

Curse you all!

Deceitful kind, could never be like you
Oh, two-faced vermin, spitting lies
Through twisted masks
All that I see - betrayal and greed
I'll watch you drown, I'll see you fade

When the skies are falling
You'll see me smile...

Raise your glasses gentleman
To this world of grinning prostitutes
