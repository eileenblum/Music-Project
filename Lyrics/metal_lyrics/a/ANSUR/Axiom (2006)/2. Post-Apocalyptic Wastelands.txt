-The profound impact 
put the inhabitants in a gasp!
In which ascendancy
that made their planet descent

The earth will transfigure
into a plantation strict
Of an eloquent exigency
with grit and persiflagness!

"Air travellers and their planes subsided to the grounds
and there was not a single light on the surface of the earth
Power was generated, but not used at all
A comprehensive told of an immense, electromagnetic
pulse in a scale larger than the surface of the earth itself"

This bomb had no purpose of killing!
