"Phase two, built on offensiveness and even more untimidity:
a most influenced leader was seen to be abducted
to the ships of the unknown invaders"

Dolor!
Your deduction of superstition is your fiend,
a whole matter to this earth
Fatal as your breaching core

This is the premonition

And visualize this -
An autocracy
For you to obiter-dictum an own

"Every star a search we'we called (for a suitable resource furnish),
the project on earth is the greatest of them all"
It's eclectic correct,
face the manner

"There is nothing to disavow
This is the premonition"
