Unbelievable enough, the seas sunk
But the sudden wide, reputable desert...
Thats the astounding!
After leaving the crash-site,
the expedition recovered even more mystical findings
Oversized tracks of footprints,
and rags of fabrics totally unknown to this world
were spread in a straight vertical line,
leading higher and higher
This is a newborn desert, and someone is here already
This is where He emerged...

-Who are you wanderer?

The insight of your own kinds defeat an irony
I am the formula, made and brought above your figment
Also what, you were thought to abhor

See me as the conduct!
I have elongated in the desert for thousands of years
as a nematode in the soil, awaiting this very moment!

-This enigma you bring up on us... Towards what does it lead?

A turning point, the prehistorical truth, adhered to all religious beliefs!

There are evidence
A companionship is what I require
All of you will collect the "shrewd" fragments of clues
that will unmask and then portent the expression; God!

Because I am that example!
Not world dominant
neither the architect of stars
But I represent heaven, just as much as hell!
