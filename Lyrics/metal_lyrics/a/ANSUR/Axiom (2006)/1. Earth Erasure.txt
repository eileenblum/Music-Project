This is where it all ended - and began

The ridiculed humanity
by nature hierarch'es all of them
with characteristic aptitudes
inherited by our kind

and that needles me,
as well as observ them solemn eachother

Commence ignition!

"By melting the earth impact,
is taking our archaic world back - infact"

Plutonium melted the hemming chants
and sirens raised their howl
The stir past - you're (gone!)
Left a thousand chide words
to discern

"Beneath the veiling clouds, there lies our pauperizing
The far past abondoned relinquishment
the nuke was just a miscouncil

-But what about... "him"?

"He will stir into the opposition
but his plot will prevail
Do not worry..."
