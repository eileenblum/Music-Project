Thereâs a story that is told
Of the day the fire burnt away the sky
Strangers came from afar
Returning to a world unrecognized
They couldnât believe their eyes

(Mother Earth)
A billion years my biosphere
So perfect self-sustaining
Compromised in only a century
The greed of man is too extreme
No limits to their taking
No longer will I suffer for their needs

No longer will I suffer for the human plan
This legacy of decadence must end
No longer will I suffer for the human plan
My powers of recovery transcend

Fires raged a thousand days
Survivors were enlightened
A wiser race would claim the new frontier
Born again our vision clear
We guard the earth united
The harmony inside must persevere

We are the Wardens of the new world
Honoring the promises weâve made
We are the Wardens of the new world
The reckoning has risen from the flames

And the story goes on
Are we free from the flames,
Or will they reignite?

(Mother Earth)
My oceans will rise very soon
A dance that I play with the moon
Waves of renewal carry away
New life replacing decay
I will end the strife
I will bring new life
I will bring new life!

You are the Wardens of the new world
Honoring the promises you have made
You are the Wardens of the new world
The reckoning has risen from the flames

We are the Wardens of the new world
Honoring the promises weâve made
We are the Wardens of the new world
The reckoning has risen from the flames

We are the Wardens of the new world
Honoring the promises weâve made
We are the Wardens of the new world
The reckoning has risen from the flames

And the story goes on
We will unite with one true vision
Protect the Earth
This is our mission
Our home is in peril unless we all act
The Strangers have left us
But they will come back if we fail!
