(The Keepers)
Weâve returned, awakened by the light
We can feel her cries
You should see whatâs become of your world
Take a look through our eyes
An infectious disease out of control
Now youâll be cleansed by the fire

They have returned
The ones we hold divine
Awakened from a slumber eternal
Now we shall burn
Feeding their fire
Fueling a raging inferno
Showers of flames
Ignite the crimson sky
Witness untamable power
Few will remain
Defenders of the mind
This will be manâs darkest hour
The truth is coming emblazoned in gold
Thereâs no deliverance
We reap what we sow

Oh, we called the savior
Now weâll be cleansed by the fire
Oh, redeem our failures
Now weâll be cleansed by the fire

Sources draining
No sustaining the life
While weâre dreaming the Earth is screaming
But no one hear her cries
Donât be deceived by a heart that still beats
When the spirit has long expired
Why, oh why?

(The Keepers)
We gave you the technology to prosper
A chance to advance your race
Individual opulence has prevailed
over symbiotic harmony
Earthâs delicate balance has been threatened
She is infected
Her cries fall upon deaf ears
You turn a blind eye to the warnings
Although your hearts beat
Your spirit for life has long since expired
Now you will hear, now you will see
Now you will burn, burn, BURN!

Sources draining
No sustaining the life
While weâre dreaming
The Earth screaming
But no one hears her cries
Watch the world bleed
Taking more that we need
Now we choke on our selfish desires
Why, oh why?

The truth is coming emblazoned in gold
Thereâs no deliverance
We reap what we sow

Oh, we called the savior
Now weâll be cleansed by the fire
Oh, redeem our failures
Now weâll be cleansed by the fire

Oh, we called the savior
Now weâll be cleansed by the fire
Oh, redeem our failures
Now weâll be cleansed by the fire
