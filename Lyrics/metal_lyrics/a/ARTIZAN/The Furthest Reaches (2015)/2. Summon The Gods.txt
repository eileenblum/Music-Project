Mother Earth fight to breathe
Terra Firma is ripe with disease
Rape the land pollute the sea
Her blood runs black

Feel her spirit beneath our feet
Writhing in pain the more we deplete
Shock waves form to sound the alarm
She will strike back

Light shot into space
Bright as the sun
Calling them home
When the world is in danger
They will come

Rising from the sand
Tomb for a king who was never discovered
Built by foreign hands
Chambers that sing with the cries of our mother
Energy deep within
Surging with power that burns to escape
Cleanse us of our sins
We can summon the gods with the light of the pyramid

Follow your heart
Learn to embrace the dark

Light shot into space
Bright as the sun
Calling them home
When the world is in danger

Rising from the sand
Tomb built for a king
Shaped by foreign hands
Chamber golden sing

Power deep within
Yearning to escape
We can summon the gods
Her pain transcribed in light
