Unravel the mystery
Are we alone?
As far as the eye can see
And beyond our limitations

Can a ravaged Earth survive?
Will harmony prevail?
Change greets an open mind
Hopeful eyes will look to the horizon
Weâll find our way on the horizon
And we await their arrival from the stars

They travel the endless sea
To reach a world in danger
Restoring hope and peace
The intergalactic savior

Man is testing the grand design
Our greatest feat could be our failure
We are living on borrowed time
Hopeful eyes will look to the horizon
Weâll find our way to the horizon
Thereâs a new day on the horizon
And we await their arrival from the stars

An urgent message sent through space
Destiny unknown
Soon the receiver will awake
And make the journey home

They are the Keepers of the human race
Setting a course for the Milky Way
An ancient starship comes to life
Heading for Earth at the speed of light

And when the starships cross the sky
Only the dreamers get to ride
Is there time to change our ways?
Is it too late for the arrival?

And when the starships cross the sky
Only the dreamers get to ride
Is there time to change our ways?
Is it too late for the arrival?
Can they save Mankind?
