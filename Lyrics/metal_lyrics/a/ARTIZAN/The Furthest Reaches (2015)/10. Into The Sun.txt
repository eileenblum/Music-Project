Iâm living out a fantasy
Iâm goinâ away
This world is not enough for me
And I just canât stay
Iâm ready to fly
Iâll follow my dreams to unfamiliar skies

Lights that descend in the night
Vibrant colors exploding in my eyes
I have imagined the ride
Astral images occupy my mind

Ride on
Ride on into the sun
Ride on
The journey has just begun

I see the Earth below
Fragile and alone
Humbled by the sight
Majestic is her light
I wish they all could know

Iâm livin out a fantasy
Iâm flyinâ away
A guided tour is what I need
Around the secrets of space
The grandest show
Itâs all for me
Into the great unknown
Strange
Spiral galaxies wind their way
Iâm entranced by their display
Space
Always yearning to be explored
We will find new life someday

Ride on
Ride on into the sun
Ride on
The journey has just begun

Ride on
Ride on into the sun
Ride on
The journey has just begun

There is a light that hides
Deep in the darkest regions
Illuminate your mind
Explore the furthest reaches
There is a light that hides
Deep in the darkest regions
Illuminate your mind
Explore the furthest reaches
