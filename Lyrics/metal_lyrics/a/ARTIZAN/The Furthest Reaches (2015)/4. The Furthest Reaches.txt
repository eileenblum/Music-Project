If you believe in a lonely existence
Transcend your state of mind
Thereâs a star shining bright in the distance
Rising high over sentient skies

We are not all alone
We are crossing the great divide

Alone the Nile the angels descended
Cosmic stewards brought our visions to life
Erecting structures far beyond comprehension
The stones were set when we were left behind

The day will come when we will see
The ones who ride the golden chariot
Returning home with sadness in their eyes
Theyâll set the world on fire

Explore the furthest reaches
The deepest dark of space
Explore the furthest reaches
Where dreams of light are made

Voices still echo through the halls
In the greatest monument of the three
Messages inscribed on the walls
Reveal an ancient prophecy

Explore the furthest reaches
The deepest dark of space
Explore the furthest reaches
Where dreams of light are made

Explore the furthest reaches
The deepest dark of space
Explore the furthest reaches
Where dreams of light are made

Created as a summoning device
The Seventh Wonder stand forever tall
Activate the powers deep inside
And wake the Keepers with this call
Explore the furthest reaches

Theyâre coming home
From far across the sea
Theyâre coming home
Awakened from their dreams

We are not all alone
We are crossing the great divide

Whoâs to blame?
We lost our way
Broken is the rhythm of life
Fear the flame, soon weâll pay
Glowing like the embers â so bright, so bright
And the world will keep on turning
While weâre burning through the night
And we thought that they would save us

We are not all alone
We are crossing the great divide

Theyâre coming home
From far across the sea
Theyâre coming home
Awakened from their dreams
