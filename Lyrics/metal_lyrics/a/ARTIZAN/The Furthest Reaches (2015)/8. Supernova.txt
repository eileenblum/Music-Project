Light bright as a thousand stars
Brace for a stellar explosion
Nine planets are torn apart
Erased if the promise is broke

Static words no longer hold their weight
Without change there's no tomorrow

Supernova
We have been warned of the damage we've done
Supernova
Shine
Supernova
Beauty reborn from the death of the sun
Supernova
Shine

Find ourselves
A conscience changing
Find ourselves aligned
Find ourselves
A world worth saving
Find ourselves
The altruistic mind

Night is upon us, eternal dark
Time to awaken from our dreaming

Supernova
We have been warned of the damage we've done
Supernova
Shine
Supernova
Beauty reborn from the death of the sun
Supernova
Ignites

Light bright as a thousand stars
