I've fallen for the game
I'l never be the same
In order to survive
I'll fill your head with lies

You'll see... I've planned so carefully
The future's in the making

Believe... so easy to deceive
It's all mine for the taking

Now I'm able to acquire
The fortunes I desire
Consumed with only greed
I cast a lonely seed

Throughout mans history
We rape prosperity
In the end we're all the same
We all must play the game

You'll see... I've planned so carefully
The future's in the making

Believe... so easy to deceive
It's all mine for the taking

The strong persevere
The weak disappeaame within a game

The blackness inside
It keeps us alive
We're playing the game within a game

The strong persevere
The weak disappaer
We're playing the game within a game

The countless deceived
The stories I've weaved
I'm playing the game within a game
