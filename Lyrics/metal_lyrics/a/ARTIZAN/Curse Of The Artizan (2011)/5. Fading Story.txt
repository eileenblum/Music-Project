Do you pray out of fear when you're lonely?
Can a handful of tears make the hurting subside?
Are the walls of serenity falling?
Will a savior of sanity hear all you cries?

There's a fading story
Hidden deep within your mind
Seek the fading story
There's a magic you will find

Will lifetime of agony haunt you?
Does a mountain of memories stand in your way?
Your future is holding the answer
It's calling you, calling you don't turn away

There's a fading story
Hidden deep within your mind
Seek the fading story
There's a magic you will find

There's a stream in the valley of sadness
Flowing forever behind a closed eye
There's a scene that destroying the madness
It is showing the answers that keep dreams alive

There's a fading story
Hidden deep within your mind
Seek the fading story
There's a magic you will find
