I have rings of gold, a wealth untold
I've traveled everywhere
I've staked my claim upon this land
As far as you can see

The luxuries that I possess
Won't guard me from despair
I hold this world inside my hand
But it's not enough for me

I'd trade it all - if I could fly
I'd trade it all - if I could fly
Ride the winds - forever high
I'd trade it all - if I could fly

The truth be told, I'm growing old
Skies are turning grey
The sands of time are running fast
And soon I'll disappear

The fortune of my legacy
Can't buy another day
I only hope my soul is cast
Into the stratosphere

I'd trade it all - if I could fly
I'd trade it all - if I could fly
Ride the winds - forever high
I'd trade it all - if I could fly

Ride the thermals
Climbing eternal
