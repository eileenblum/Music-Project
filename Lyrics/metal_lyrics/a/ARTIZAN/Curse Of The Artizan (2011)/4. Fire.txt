There's a fire that burns in my heart
It's been calling me from the start
Time can't take the dreams I have made
There's a fire that burns in my heart

Pushing forward through all the years
Manifesting hope in my fears
Clutching the dreams I've betrayed
Utilizing what still remains

Once a victim of the machine
Staying true to what I've foressen
Heed the calling of my true art
There's a fire that burns in my heart

My true path
Will not fade
I will thrive
Seize the day

Through my dreams
I will fly
Wings of fate
Touch the sky

The fire is calling me
I'm yearning eternally

There's a fire that burns in my heart
It's been calling me from the start
Time can't take the dreams I have made
There's a fire that burns in my heart

There's a fire that burns in my heart
It's been calling me from the start
Time can't take the dreams I have made
There's a fire that burns in my heart

The fire is calling me
I'm yearning eternally
