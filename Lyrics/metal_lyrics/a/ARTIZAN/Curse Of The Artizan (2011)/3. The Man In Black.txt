The man in black looks in my eyes
My true emotion compromised
A burning rage is all I feel
My darkest thoughts are soon revealed

He waits until the anger builds
The cup of evil has been filled
I swallow all that I can bear
The man in black is everywhere

When I can't contain
The anger and the pain
He takes me to the bottom then pulls me back
Every time I bleed
He gives me what I need
The only friend I have is the man in black

Searching for some clarity
His venom is my therapy
Forget the things that you've been told
The man in black will free your soul

- The man in black

When I can't contain
The anger and the pain
He takes me to the bottom then pulls me back
Every time I bleed
He gives me what I need
The only friend I have is the man in black

- The man in black

I've learned  to live with all the pain
A little madness keeps me sane
And when it's more than I can stand
The man in black will take my hand

When I can't contain
The anger and the pain
He takes me to the bottom then pulls me back
Every time I bleed
He gives me what I need
The only friend I have is the man in black
