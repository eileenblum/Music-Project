Fear has cast a shadow upon me
Madness is at bay
The demons that reside in my mind are reforming
I hope I can keep them away

they won't let up

When they beat me down I always rise back up
When they beat me down I always rise back up

Circumstance has scarred my conviction
Ambitions worn and frayed
Energy relentlessly flowing
I'm tortured by the dreams I have made

they won't let up

When they beat me down I always rise back up
When they beat me down I always rise back up

Take back undying vision
Turn the gears of regression
Face what I believe
Free my destiny

they won't let up

When they beat me down I always rise back up
When they beat me down I always rise back up
