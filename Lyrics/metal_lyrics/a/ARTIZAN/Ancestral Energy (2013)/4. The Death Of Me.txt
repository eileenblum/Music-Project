Someone is gripping at my shoulder
They've come to take my breath away
I've never feared as I've grown older
An early grave might be my fate

And when the light is stolen from my eyes
Clearer I'll see
My essence will find a new life
I've always known I'll continue to roam
Forever free
The death of me keeps me alive

A thousand time I've made this journey
Infinity seems like a day
I have no doubt I am returning
Another time, another place

And when the light is stolen from my eyes
Clearer I'll see
My essence will find a new life
I've always known I'll continue to roam
Forever free
The death of me keeps me alive

[2x]
I will not fear the grave that waits for me
I will not fear a journey sublime

I will not fear the blade of the Reaper
I will embrace my death in due time

And when the light is stolen from my eyes
Clearer I'll see
My essence will find a new life
I've always known I'll continue to roam
Forever free
Forever free
The death of me keeps me alive
