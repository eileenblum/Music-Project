The lion, once mighty enthroned,
A pale shade of a dying star.
Behold the temple was burning inside,
And nothing but ashes remained.
The children displaced to the land of the whore.
But light shines better in darkness,
And shadows are so clear to see.
O children of Israel show me your tears,
And reach out your mind to the hands on the wall.

So turn around and see the street that is called your live,
Is this the way You really want to live.
The time of history is far away,
But yet YouÂ´re going through all these things.
The ultimate freedom is the cage of society,
Imprisoned by their own will.
The walls in these souls are as high as a moutain,
A dying from within, not a physical death.
But there is an end, this time will come,
Behold the hands on the wall.

For the future is at hand
And it comes like a thief in the night
Behold the seed nearly unseen with us
The birth of the kingdom
- Dethronement of dawn
And gather right now to finish the game
To break down the walls to carry the flame
That opens the gate to my fathers side
I am the leader if you let me guide
