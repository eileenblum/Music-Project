The veil of peace and holiness
fades away - the chapter begins.
And transforms to forces of the dark
against the fulfil of thy words.
Behold the signs of my sunrise
to be prepared for the final "Armageddon".

Take your sword to start the fight.
The battlefield of flesh and spirit.
Look at the blossom, so pretty and nice
but deadly ist venomous sting.
Look at the mirror and judge yourself
to gain the state of innocence.

Time is getting close to time.
Future and past melting to one.
The essence of live will rise again
to enter the kingdom of my dreams.
All creatures of shadow, powered by dark
will bow or taste the taste of dust.

The veil of peace and holiness
fades away - the chapter begins.
And transforms to the forces of the dark
against the fulfil of thy words.
Behold the signs of my sunrise
to be prepared for the final "Armageddon".
