Standing alone in the shelter of the night,
and I see I am lost in myself.
Fall into an abyss which I never will climb again
and I see I am lost in myself.

My cry so softly dissappears in the night
and I feel - nothing remains.
O Lord I please you take me out of here
set me free - give me live again.
