I saw you standing in the dimlight of doom
As you spoke to me: "Where have you been?"
I was hungry but you had no bread,
I was naked and there were no clothes.

Nailed for you on a cross made of sin,
Crucified to heal your soul.
Time is passing, second by second,
And still I cantÂ´t hear your cry.

Take my hand IÂ´m bleeding for you,
And still I canÂ´t hear your cry.

And still I canÂ´t hear your cry.

Take my hand IÂ´m bleeding for you,
And still I canÂ´t hear your cry
