Your normal live is grey in grey,
you're needing friends, but they donÂ´t care.
There is no sense for you in live.
You want to die, day after day.

A mum and dad are just a dream
there is none who really cares.
YouÂ´ve no home you have no gain
your life is covered with your tears.

You want to put out your lamp of live.
The razors edge lies in your hand.
DecisionÂ´s made, you're out of time.
just blood remains you fade away

There is a man who holds your hand,
nailed on a cross a slowly dead.
He kills your pain just go to him.
He sets you free gives new live.

[Chorus:]
Pain, never-ending pain in your heart.
Pain, `till your hope breaks apart.
Pain, now your eys fades into wide,
and your soul cries out for suicide.
