Cross the fie line
Between the barrier of time
Invading conscious soul
Taking conscious soul
Taking over personality
Schizophrenic infestion
Two people to share one mind
Life will never be the same
No former memory to remain

Torn between to worlds
Torn between to worlds
Torn between to worlds
Torn between to worlds

No way to contain
This infested thought
At the mercy of fate
No way to be controlled
Former self resurfaces
Desperate cries, desperate need
To free this alien persona
And let one's mind be cleansed

Torn between to worlds
Torn between to worlds
Torn between to worlds
Torn between to worlds

Cannot hypnotism slove this problem lodged
Too deep one body merging point?
Or just a mental malfuction?
One of life's mysteries?
One of life's crimes?
Attention seeking indiviuals?
Or one person with two minds?

Torn between to worlds
Torn between to worlds
Torn between to worlds
Torn between to worlds
