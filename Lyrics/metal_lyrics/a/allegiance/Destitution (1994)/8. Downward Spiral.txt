Ambitious future
Lead  to ruin
Inflicted suffering
To ease another

Force of habit - change your will
Fatal fascination - deadly addiction
Downward spiral - into the depths of despair
What is this life without any care?

Suffering hour
A craving desire
Endless path
Corrupting the weak

Force of habit - change your will
Fatal fascination - deadly addiction
Downward spiral - into the depths of despair
What is this life without any care?

Vice like grip
Cannot be freed
Rapid descent
Crush a future to be

Inward to need, forever a slave
Inward to greed, needle to the gave
How does it feel, to have no control
And live in a world that's not your own

Misguided child
What is your future?
Plunged into despair
Life of no care

Force of habit - change your will
Fatal fascination - deadly addiction
Downward spiral - into the depths of despair
What is this life without any care?
