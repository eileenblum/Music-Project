Left out in the cold
The world has closed it's doors
Time are so hard now
No fun in life no more
Looking back
At the way it used to be
The past is all I have now
Hard times have hit me

I wish I could run
Wish I could hide
Forget all my problems
Just curl up and die
Out on the street
Out on my own
Facing the world alone

My eternal suffering
A death sentence with no time
Endless journey no escpe
Destituion is my crime
Why am I so helpless
No feelings of life's worth
A desperate need for salvation
Is this life a curse

I wish I could run
Wish I could hide
Forget all my problems
Just curl up and die
Out on the street
Out on my own
Facing the world alone

Lack of baisc need
Desire on-which to feed
Desperation is my life
In poverty I will die
