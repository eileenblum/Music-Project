Charging in so blind, To manipulate our lives
What our eyes now see, Is not what was meant to be
Feeding off the pain, A game for the insane
Exploiting shallow truth, Is a profitable abuse

Shred your life
Take your mind
Strip your soul
Rob you blind

Blinded by words - blinded by faith
Feeding of controversy - feeding of hate
What is the truth? - What are the lies?
A past left behind - when chaos dies

Trubulent are the times, and and cutting are the lines
That we everyday, our thoughts are swept away
Diggin up the dirt, Inflicting constant hurt
The price to be paid, a life moulded into shape

Shred your life
Take your mind
Strip your soul
Rob you blind

Blinded by words - blinded by faith
Feeding of controversy - feeding of hate
What is the truth? - What are the lies?
A past left behind - when chaos dies

Take a look around - Take the time to see
The course of your own actions as thoses of others
