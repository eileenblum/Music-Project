Captured by curiosity
Drawn to what you cannot see
For others have decided your fate

Dare you look
Dare you try
Can you follow
A path of lies

Total govern to liberty
Leading you to immortality
Searching for a life of stability
Uplifting resurrection of truth

Dare you look
Dare you try
Can you follow
A path of lies

Consecending of other belief
Preaching contradicition and righteous conceit
To fill with guilt and feel enslaved
Are you the one who's life's left saved?

Dare you look
Dare you try
Can you follow
A path of lies
