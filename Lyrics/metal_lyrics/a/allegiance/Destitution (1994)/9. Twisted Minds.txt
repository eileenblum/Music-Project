Oppressed to see, the world as they say
Cannot think for ones-self, you minds have been made
Ties have been severed, a life no longer yours
Except to live and be and further thier cause

Rat race of humanity are we to blame
Trends upon trends following their game
Deviation unaccepted why do you conform
Blinded commerciality force fed their normailty

Who cares - if I cane see
Who cares - what I perceive
Who cares - if I believe
Your twisted mind
Who cares - if I cane see
Who cares - what I perceive
Who cares - if I believe
Your twisted mind

Blind lead the blind, so obvious to see
Apart from the gullible and those who are not free
Born with free will make our own choice
Don't let others decide and be your own voice

Rat race of humanity are we to blame
Trends upon trends following their game
Deviation unaccepted why do you conform
Blinded commerciality force fed their normailty

Who cares - if I cane see
Who cares - what I perceive
Who cares - if I believe
Your twisted mind
Who cares - if I cane see
Who cares - what I perceive
Who cares - if I believe
Your twisted mind

The memories you have of a life you once knew
Rebirthed and lving in a fabricated zoo
A saddening life, yes it is not yours
Except to live and be and further their cause

Rat race of humanity are we to blame
Trends upon trends following their game
Deviation unaccepted why do you conform
Blinded commerciality force fed their normailty

Who cares - if I cane see
Who cares - what I perceive
Who cares - if I believe
Your twisted mind
Who cares - if I cane see
Who cares - what I perceive
Who cares - if I believe
Your twisted mind
