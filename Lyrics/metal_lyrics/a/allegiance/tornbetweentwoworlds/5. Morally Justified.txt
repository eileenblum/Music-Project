When life reaches a point when it cannot be sustained
Physical impossiblity an obstacle too great
To play the hands of God to induce death
Is it committing murder? Or putting pain at rest?

Your will to survive
Your will to be alive
Will to let die
Morally justified

Image your the fighter but can't win the race
Arificial life support prolongs your living state
Imagine you're the dreamer but can't reach your goal
Artifical hope implanted in your soul

Your will to survive
Your will to be alive
Will to let die
Morally justified

Pain and agony
What can and cannot be
Torment andsuffering
Please don't induce death
Just get it over with
Prolonged by questioning

Pain inflicts the conscience on thos who make the decision
This is the choice of life or death peace of pain to be given
Depending on your line of thought will determine on what side
The argument of wrong or right the choice you must decide

Your will to survive
Your will to be alive
Will to let die
Morally justified
