Real life testing of an unborn child
Except the side effects are anything but mild
The effects of a drug are not known until now
Except the human guinea pigs, will suffer anyhow

Dealt the cruel hand - born without a chance
Dealt the cruel hand - victim of circumstance
Dealt the cruel hand - one life to be
Dealt the cruel hand - you'll be left in misery

One hand ties, one eye blind
One step behind, a cover up disguise
One life to be, one's life deceived
Ones pain to me has been lost in pity

Dealt the cruel hand - born without a chance
Dealt the cruel hand - victim of circumstance
Dealt the cruel hand - one life can be
Dealt the cruel hand - you'll be left in misery

False start to a life, that's taken a wrong course
Unknowingly inflict the pain and left to take the blame
The damaged has been done, a record of effect
Experiment or our own, compassion to the test

Dealt the cruel hand - born without a chance
Dealt the cruel hand - victim of circumstance
Dealt the cruel hand - one life deceived
Dealt the cruel hand - you'll be left in misery
