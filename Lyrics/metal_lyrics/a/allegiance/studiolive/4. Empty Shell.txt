Can pride be the essence of what drives a man?
Motivational force a will to succeed
World be captured an untamed need

What strange secrets do you hide?
Expressionless stare
Expressionless pride
What you can be, what we know now
Is just an empty shell - a life of hell

Sense of dignity
Sense of well being
One's inner strength
Split at the seams

What weight to be shared?
Is a weight to be bared?
To carry a load that can cursh our own
Sense of preservation

What strange secrets do you hide?
Expressionless stare
Expressionless pride
What you can be, what we know now
Is just an empty shell - a life of hell

What strange secrets do you hide?
Expressionless stare
Expressionless pride
What you can be, what we know now
Is just an empty shell - a life of hell

Sense of dignity
Sense of well being
One's inner strength
Split at the seams
Crushed by the force
Overloaded by thought
To distruction as one
Self destruction begun
