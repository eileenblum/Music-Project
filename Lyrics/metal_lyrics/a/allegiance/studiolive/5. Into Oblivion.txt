What wonders to unfold
We wonder what may be
Infinitely out of bounds
In a red tape lead lined society

Deciet
Concede
Confused
Abused

Not to think, not to hear
Descending destiny
Into oblivion
Not to see
Not to know
Blindfolded we are led,
Into oblivion

Pyramids natures beast
Whence does our knowledge come forth?
Wisdom absorbed but not withheld
We become our own worst enemy

Not to think, not to hear
Descending destiny
Into oblivion
Not to see
Not to know
Blindfolded we are led,
Into oblivion

Evidence to be tried
But it is not to be told
What secrets ar obscured,
From view, ever confused

Not to think, not to hear
Descending destiny
Into oblivion
Not to see
Not to know
Blindfolded we are led,
Into oblivion
