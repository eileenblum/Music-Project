Futureturns the tides
An abstract view on life
Morbid thoughts that dominate
Control your instinct to survive

Left in the dark again
Trapped behind a shadow
When will the confusion end
Left with no to-morrow

So many thoughts we cannot see
Condemn us to a life of sorrow
Leaving one to conjure ways
And try to make it through to-morrow

Left in the dark again
Trapped behind a shadow
When will the confusion end
Left with no to-morrow

Left in the dark again
Trapped behind a shadow
When will the confusion end
Left with no to-morrow
