Nothing is worth than what you now feel
And your sure you can't be healed
Your thoughts they conjure a new way out
To free your life of this self doubt
You are weak yet also strong
But what rational order do your thoughts belong
Can you save yourself this fall
Can conscience over ride yourself to stand tall

One step beyond - this is a place you seek
One step beyond - you cannot see
One step beyond - this fatal lie
One step beyond - would it matter if you die

Separated from the life you desire
Your head is spinning, pain burns like fire
It is almost too much to bare
Losing a grip on what isn't there
As you commence to your final decent
Was giving up the fight always your intent
I pity you because your so small
No courage inside of yourself at all

One step beyond - this is a place you seek
One step beyond - you cannot see
One step beyond - this fatal lie
One step beyond - would it matter if you die
