Hungry for your life
Blinding you with words
Playing on your innocence
The truth that goes unheard

Fucking with your life
Fucking with your head
Let your knowledge be your strength
Or you'll be ripped to shreds

Filling you with lies
While breathing down your neck
Bleeding your well dry
Broken into a wreck

Fucking with your life
Fucking with your head
Let your knowledge be your strength
Or you'll be ripped to shreds

Ripped To Shreds
Ripped To Shreds
Ripped To Shreds
Ripped To Shreds
