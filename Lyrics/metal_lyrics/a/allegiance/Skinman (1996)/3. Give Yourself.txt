Death before dishonour
But not before your time
Guilty as the victim
Your conscience you resign

No questions to be asked
No story to be told
To die by ones self
The truth will then unfold

Give yourself to the pain
Let your mind take control
Bend your body to the train
Let the rules take thier hold

Piercing eyes converge
Tied to a stringent law
The finger pointed at your worth
Counter action is withdrawn

Give yourself to the pain
Let your mind take control
Bend your body to the train
Let the rules take thier hold
