I told you once
Don't make me tell you again
Stop hanging around
Fantisizing that your some kind of friend

You've had your chance
This life belongs to me
I can't understand
What it is your trying to be

Just leave me alone
Stay the fuck away from me
I won't leave myself open
To your lies and deceit

You've had your chance
This life belongs to me
I can't understand
What it is your trying to be

Reality - Face Reality
Reality - Face Reality

You've had your chance
This life belongs to me
I can't comprehend
What it is your trying to be

You've had your chance
This life belongs to me
I can't understand
What it is your trying to be
