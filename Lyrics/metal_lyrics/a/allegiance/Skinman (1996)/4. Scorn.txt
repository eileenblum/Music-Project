Likes rats we strip the earth
Rampant animals and beast
Children in a stupor
Frustation is unleashed
Cauterize emotion
Striking at our worst fear
Breeding with unopen minds
And drowning in our tears

Grasping bloodied hands
Reaching out in agnoy
Life torn apart at the seams

Gripping throes of death
Crippling with zest
We are impaling our own being

Scorn Scorn

Corruptive minds at work
Open our eyes to see
Complusive wat to act
Implusive way to be
Eating at the remains
To crumble in decay
Turning onto ourselves and
The life that we reject

Scorn Scorn
