Looking for to-morrow
Before you find to-day
To be abused that way

A sign of the times
Society to blame
You ask yourself the question
Was it self inflicted pain

Blame
Who's to blame
Blame
Who's to blame
The chance of a new life
Or the beginning of the end
Looking to-wards the future

Drowning in self pity
As time presses on
No point in looking back
The past times are gone


Blame
Who's to blame
Blame
Who's to blame
The chance of a new life
Or the beginning of the end
Look to-wards the future
With yourself as your only friend

The chance of a new life
Or the beginning of the end
Look to-wards the future
With yourself as your only friend
Blame
Who's to blame
Blame
Who's to blame
