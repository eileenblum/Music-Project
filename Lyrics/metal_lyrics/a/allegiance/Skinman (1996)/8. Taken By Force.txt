Persecute the ones
The innocent are overcome
I won't accept your scorn
You won't accept the norm

I sense your anger
The pain that burns inside
You don't redeem my opinion
Or diminish my pride

Diminish or return
Castigate my word
I can't accept your cause
When you take me

Legislate the law
Bu took for any flaw
Or you'll be taken by force
Rules that are made
Are rules to be obeyed
Taken by force

I sense your anger
The pain that burns inside
You don't redeem my opinion
Or diminish my pride

Objection is not the answer
To this voracious form of cancer
Eating at the freedom of others
To enjoy thier own existence

Taken by force
Taken by force

Legislate the law
But look for any flaw
Or you'll be taken by force
Rules that are made
Are rules to be obeyed
Taken by force

Taken
