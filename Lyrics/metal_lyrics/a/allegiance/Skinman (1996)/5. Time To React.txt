Scars of rejection
Visible by all
Writhing indecision
Lacking direction

Time
Your wasting your time
Confined
To stand in line

Wasting away - Lies and fact
Freedom betrayed - Time to react

Power of perspective
Squeezing life from hope
Feeding on intelligence
Take the final fall

Time
Your wasting your time
Confined
To stand in line

Wasting away - Lies and fact
Freedom betrayed - Time to react

Connected to the system
Tied down by the law
Serve and obey
Feed your daily morals

Time
Your wasting your time
Confined
To stand in line

Wasting away - Lies and fact
Freedom betrayed - Time to react
Wasting away - Lies and fact
Freedom betrayed - Time to react

Time To react
Time To react
Time To react
Time To react
