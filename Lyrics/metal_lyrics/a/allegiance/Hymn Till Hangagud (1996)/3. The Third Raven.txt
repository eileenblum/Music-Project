I Carve my runes upon a cairnstone surface
A powerful pattern that will crush the walls to the unknown
I kill my eye as a bloodbounds sign
Generating powers that sleeping far beyond and down below

A warlock timeless strong I will be
With farces to see more than man can see
Wise as the mountain I'll prowl the world
The trinities last perfection The Allfathers Eye

I'll be the third One eyed God who rule the night
Grant me a part of your sempiternal might
Use me as your messenger
The third raven your second night
The Nornor Goddessess knows my fate
I'll walk right through the greatest of gates

Walls of spears
Roof of shields
In the Golden Hall I'll kneel in fear
For the one enslaver of my mind
Until this night
I've enlarged my mind
With secrets of most dreadful kind
Obscure rites have revealed the truth
I can not stop now I can not choose

A warlock timeless strong
I'll be With forces to see more than man can see
I'll be the third One eyed God who rule the night
Grant me a part of your sempiternal might
Use me as your messenger

The third raven your second sight
I let myself fall into an ancient lake
I break it's silent mirror like face
It's name is the sake that
I defend A Midgard worm...

Nor beginning nor end
The Nornor Goddessess knows my fate
I'll walk right through the greatest of Gates
Walls of spears
Roof of shields
In the Golden Hall
I'll kneel For the one enslaver of my mind
The greatest God that man can find
