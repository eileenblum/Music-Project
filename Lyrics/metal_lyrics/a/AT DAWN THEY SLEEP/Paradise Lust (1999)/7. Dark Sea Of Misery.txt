Something happened, something's gone,
the lost so great, forever gone.
The raised hammer, the hitten nail,
under your skin, biting your veins.

The sun won't rise as yesterday,
the widow won't cry after her loves,
even just yesterday, she cried the sea,
her tears as rivers, sorrow as the sea.

I am drowning, in the
Dark sea of misery,
The lance goes through my heart,
the stallion dances on my grave.

The knight has taken of his helmet.
His sword is broken, honor is gone.
The traitor did burn, their round table,
but he doesn't care, he is tired to...

Trying to live, in pain, in rain.
Rain drops so hot, don't quit, don't stop.
The sorrow of the widow, will end, don't bend
to the misery, live, breathe andwin.

You will always see the light in the end of the tunnel,
in the darkest dungeon.
Dive to the sea of misery, but light your way with hope,
don't ever quit.
But so often, your own strength just ain't enough.
Pray and you'll see, your sword will be new and clean
