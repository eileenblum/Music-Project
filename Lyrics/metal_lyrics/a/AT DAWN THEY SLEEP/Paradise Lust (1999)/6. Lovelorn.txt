"I'm the pain of the hollow ground,
I'm the morning mist
I'm the leaves of the autumn time,
I'm the wintersun"

Despair of your heart will feed my needs
I need you now, I need your disbelief
Over the crowd will message of the night
hunt for your heart
Will you be mine?

Do you know me? Will you come with me?
Am I the one you've been looking for?
Am I real?
Come with me like a stream, dream along,
Come on
I'll be waiting for you

Do you feel me? Will you abandon me?
Am I the fear you cannot feel?

I'm just the lovelorn girl...

Come with me like a wind, dream along
Forsake your God, forsake yourself...

And at the end I will rule.
