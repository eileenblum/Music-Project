Spill your tears, they will turn red
Not to be is to be red, that's it
We got the prison and decor is love
Endless love or pain

Oh, must be pain

Love is your throne, reality
Crush it, crush and Isabella arrives
Love her, bare your soul
For Isabella Red

This time you will lose
No destiny
Isabella calls
Better go...

Go to her sweet red, taste it
There's no time, no end

Life's ending
She's yours
She's smiling

She's Isabella Red
