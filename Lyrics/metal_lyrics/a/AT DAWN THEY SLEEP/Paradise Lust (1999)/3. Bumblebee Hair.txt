hey you girl, why don't you look to my face
why don't you please fly, fly to my world
the unnegative sign, on your lips
is something I want to feel, and I will be healed

take my hand, and guide me to your nest
let me drink your honey, show me the test

you are the queen, and I'm your soldier
that's all I will be, I can't stand no longer
but my mouth is closed, lips tied together
your bumblebee hair, flying in the air.

this won't last forever
you know, that insects don't live too long
not for forever
I haven't seen it all

now all that has come to reality
new emotions, the best quality
but still I'm so sad, because after all
why can't the bees live foreve
