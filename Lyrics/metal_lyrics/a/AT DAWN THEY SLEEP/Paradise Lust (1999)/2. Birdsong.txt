vivid colours and just like others, yet no songs of it's kind
the songless bird, flying without distinct destination
just looking for something... "I want to sing!"

a cry of frustration - that's no song, yet it's all, I'm afraid
carry on! you'll find it someday - the endless inspiration

fly higher, follow your kind, they say

"it's not what I want!"

a tearless tragedy - that's what you want?
"aye, if it be so, then yes. but I'll fly further"
from the dawn of your time you have flied but never sung
follows us while you can. the dusk draws nearer every day
what if it befalls on us and you still can't sing?

"then I'll fly by night!" the stubborn one cried and
flied on
you'll just get lost! come back you fool! it hurts us to see you
grieve
but the songless bird flew and flew still further...

vivid colours and just like others, yet no songs of it's kind
the songless bird, flying without distinct destination
just looking for something... "I want to sing!"
