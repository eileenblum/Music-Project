The shorelines shake with our advancement
Encroach the boundaries and break them
The spoils of victory have left you dead
And only flies will mourn you
By every method bound
And strangled to the ground
Excision root and branch
Life sources de-attached
Merciless smoke them out from their hives
Agonize harrow the scattered who remain
Heartless annihilate all that draw breath
Oblivion purge the trace of their names
The punishment has been decided
No clemency extends to you
The opportunities provided
For redemption are lost from you
In error disconnect
Catalyst from effect
The signals you reject
Sentence the world to death
Merciless smoke them out from their hives
Agonize harrow the scattered who remain
Heartless annihilate all that draw breath
Oblivion purge the trace of their names
Omnivorous and unforgiving
We arrive and leave none living
Descendants of the wicked
We gather in swarms
To feed on the slaughter
Of life in all its forms
Omnivorous and unforgiving
We arrive and leave none living
Omnivorous and unforgiving
We arrive and leave none living
Plague sickness beyond measure
Pestilence tormenting epidemic
Famine lethal deprivation
Warfare harvest of division
Destroy leave none living
Destroy leave none living
Destroy leave none living
