Thrown out of your lands
The blood of the lamb blisters your door as I ascend
Throne torn from your hands
The vault of the sky cleared of its veil as I cross the cataract
All that you know has been destroyed
Angels are cast out into the void
Serpents and demons eaters of light
Tearing heaven out of the sky
Hatred nothing but anger
I am the lightning striking the cross ignite the crucifix
Service to my lord Satan
Black wings outsretched unleash in swarms
The myriad plagues of your conception
All that you know has been destroyed
Angels are cast out into the void
Serpents and demons eaters of light
Tearing heaven out of the sky
Father to fear shaper of hate
Beloved by none that you create
Behold this day of apostasy
666 the satanic age
All shall fall into obscurity
Ruins of gold expelled into the sea for eternity
Bow before the cataclysm of our times
Black mass celebration in the garden of earthly delights
Cleanse the earth in falling blood
Bathe in profane light
God is dead hail Satan god is dead hail Satan
God is dead hail Satan god is dead hail Satan
God is dead hail Satan
