Burn in towering columns of cremation
Incinerate generations of disease exonerate and appease
Rendered into ash the last son of mankind
Absolved the legacy of men and judgment descends
Blood boiled skinless and scorched
Through immolation your species reward
Chambers ablaze charring remains
Exculpating the wicked their names
Burn billowing inferno of iniquity
Plumes of smokestacks eternal churning out cinders of the dead
Astral light obstructed and pitched into darkness
The embers of humanity remain in smoldering requiem
Funeral furnace
Dies irÃ¦ dies illa.
Funeral furnace
Solvet sÃ¦clum in favilla
Fornace funerea
Quantus tremor est
Futurus
Fornace funerea
Ut ex abyssus
Censura ortus
Terminus terrarum
Terminus terrarum
Terminus terrarum
Terminus terrarum
