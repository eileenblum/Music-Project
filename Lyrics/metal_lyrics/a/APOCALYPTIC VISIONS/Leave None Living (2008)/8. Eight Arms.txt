Venomous deadly shape shifter spreading
Kindred to none devourer of many
Treachery deception a cunning invention
Formed in the absence of gods intervention
Bones crushed organs erupt
In the coils of our embrace
Valves burst bloodlust thirst
In the coils of our embrace
Cold seeps and sulfuric vents
Beneath the hadal zone we lie
In stygian depths of the abyssal plains
Black sulfide tides
Nightmares structures comprised
A ring of tentacles caress
Denticulated to strip off your flesh
Blinded by chemicals expelled
Captive of eight arms prey to hell
