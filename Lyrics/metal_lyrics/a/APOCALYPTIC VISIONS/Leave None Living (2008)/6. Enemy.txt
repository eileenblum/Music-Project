Enemy your lives are forfeit now
Dead to me and coffin closed
Heresy your plea in foreign tongues
Weaponry we stand opposed
Conquest of all obstruction
Disparity crushed below
Separate the adversaries
Display our fallen foes
By your final transgression
Your corpse shall symbolize
Our narrow view of charity
We show no mercy to our
Enemy your lives are forfeit now
Dead to me and coffin closed
Heresy your plea in foreign tongues
Weaponry we stand opposed
Now
