Slavery loss of your identity
Parasite imprison your anatomy
Nothing you become nothing
Overthrown by malevolent tenacity
Conqueror belie a numberless capacity
Castrate victim sterilized
Autonomous systems paralyzed
Sinister creatures of obscene birth
Unseen masters dominate earth
Slavery loss of your identity
Parasite rex imprison your anatomy
Shut down disabled and blind
Your functions redesigned
Darkness trammel my eyes
Dissection by chemical knives
Pinhole swallows the mind
Injected parasite binding the life
Darkness trammel my eyes
Consumed from inside
Pinhole swallows the mind
Injected parasite binding our lives
Pathogenic epitaph
Winding serpents on the staff
Double crown of twenty two thorns
Cruel the world into which we are born
Malformed catastrophically ravaged
Recreated in the sovereign image
Betrayed by flesh of my own body
Cascade of phagocytes against me
Form changed  forces strange
Malformed catastrophically ravaged
Recreated in the sovereign image
Slavery loss of your identity
Parasite imprison your anatomy
Shut down disabled and blind
All that you once were is mine
