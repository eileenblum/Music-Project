Raise our swords to an eye level height
Display the might of our legion
Strike fear deep into the enemies minds
Their wounds envenomed with dissension
Breach defenses down
Our desire shall penetrate
And dominate all we survey
Will to power paralyze opposition
With the terrible might of our warship
Show no compassion to the fallen foes
Disgrace the fields where they die
Plunge the sacred into humility and ruin
Despoil corrupt lay waste defile
Breach defenses down
Our desire shall penetrate
And dominate all we survey
Will to power paralyze opposition
With the terrible might of our warship
Earthquake sundering the battle ground
Adversaries retreat from the apocalyptic sound
No charity bestowed and none enslaved
Naught but a death toll shall be engraved
In the hull of our warship
