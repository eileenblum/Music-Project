War
The anvil of the will
Fired flesh and molten bone transform into steel
Staining skin with my enemies blood
Stripes of crimson red
Life is blown into my lungs
From the mouths of the dead
All die I remain screaming victory
I emerge from underground
Raise my eyes to the sun
Shaking loose the leaves and earth
Draw the wind to my lungs
A lifetime of struggle
The harvest of war
Conceived in violence
In battle
Born out of conflict
Forged across the slain
Hatred baptize me
I become the blade
No man I obey nor god speak to me
No flag do I hail
I serve only me
