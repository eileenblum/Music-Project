Burn a mark into your hand to serve to remind
Who has spoken to thee
With your disobedience cometh a price
A terrible penitence
You have angered me unforgivably
The decisions is made
On this judgement day you will demonstrate
Where your allegiance lies
My laws you chose to break
Insolence foolishness
Your life now mine to take
Consequence ignorance
Put down before the knife
Bleeding heart torn apart
In ritual sacrifice
Suicide take your life
Burn drown kill yourself for me
Scream die your god is pleased
With plague famine thunder and flood
I demand blood
Hate hate hate the human race
No peace be found until mankind is erased
Hate hate hate the human race
No peace be found until mankind is erased
You die I live feeding on your suffering
Your one crime your true sin
Is that of being born human
