Parasite unequalled sorrow your disease
Paradise turned evil swallowed by your needs
Mindless domination rape your mothers corpse
Kindness be your prison hatred your reward
Terminate the breeding hunt you to extinction
Die
Isolate infection genocide correction
Ages
Before there were scriptures
And older than gods
No restraint no cages
And freedom was law
Humans fall dead struck down on sight
Hail with sirens
From their first sign
Humans!  kill them!
Doomed ones!  humans!
Humans fall dead struck down on sight
Beat back murdered none left behind
The hatred in me
For the spawn of your race ever growing
You arrived with pestilence sickness blight
And choked out the oceans
With the disease of your line
