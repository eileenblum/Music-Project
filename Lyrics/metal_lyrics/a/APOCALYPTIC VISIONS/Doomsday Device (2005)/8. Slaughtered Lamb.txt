Prescription for suicide starvation
Slow death
The memories of the grave surround you
Corruption on your breath
Mistaken compassion for living things
Convenient deception
Conceals your obsession with suffering
Worship the slaughtered lamb
I hate weakness
I hate weakness
I
I hate vegans
I hate vegans
I
Hunters teeth once deadly now rotten
In famine you consume your own flesh
Live by the sword die by the sword with honor
Live as cattle die as cattle disemboweled
I hate weakness
I hate weakness
I
I hate Jesus
I hate Jesus
I hate
I hate
