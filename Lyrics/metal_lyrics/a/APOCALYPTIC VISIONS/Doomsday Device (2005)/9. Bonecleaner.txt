White rows of tombstones lined in your mouth
Each bears the names of the men you've devoured
Speak with the wind at the gates to my grave
Dangle the lure from your tongue to enslave
Bonecleaner strip away my flesh
Leave me with nothingness and death
Hammered and poured in the forms of desire
Rewrite your life into what I require
Taken by force you surrender your throat
Lock fast your jaw and submerge me below
Bonecleaner strip away my flesh
Leave me with nothingness and death
