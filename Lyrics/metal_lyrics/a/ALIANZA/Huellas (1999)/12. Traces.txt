Someone came to this place,
at the beginning of the times,
always telling a truth,
across the Universe.

Now they return with the mission to help
this sick world, sick of evil.

They left here perfect signals,
that can hold within some answer,
to so much pain, to so much cynicism,
and to a decision of self destruction.

Ancestral temples,
marks on the stones,
ships and cities,
traces in the ground.

Talk of other beings,
that inhabited before,
wisdom from other worlds,
something left to us.

They are here all the time.
Feeling the end of human beings.
Wanting to avoid what it is to come.
Knowing we don't want to die.

They can see beyond.
Feeling, waiting for a signal.
Wanting to prevent it one more time.
Knowing that day will soon arrive.

They are here all the time.
Feeling the end of human beings.
Wanting to avoid what it is to come.
Knowing we don't want to die.

They know... they can see beyond.
Feeling, waiting for a signal.
Wanting to prevent it one more time.
Knowing that day will soon arrive.

Feeling...
Wanting...
Knowing...
