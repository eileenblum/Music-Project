I hear your voice again
through the wind in dreams
inside me
The brightmess of your eyes
stays in my mind
all the time
Fly away my memories
I don't know where
and my tears still falling down
a silver lake
where my sadness grows
Everynigth of this cold winter
I feel you near
so close I see you here
touching me
Oh,my love
drow your sadness because
my love will be with you
forever...
Fly away...
May the sun shine eternally
and may the sea dry
death covers me with it's dark cape
(but never will the flame of your love die on me)
Fly away my memories
I don't know where
and my tears still falling down
a silver lake
where my sadness grows...
May the sun shine eternally
and may the sea dry...
