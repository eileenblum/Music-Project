I had a vision in my mind
where it was a different world
there people lived other life
in a time out of our control

I've seen moonlight and sun shine
more where sky is pure and clean
I've felt whisperings in the air
and breezes of (other) seas

Will new winds of change come
that they'll bring illusion?
will lost hope return dreamland?
where do your tears fall?
dreamland

Where children's innocence expand
where there is an only war
is the one of peace and love
because laughters invade their hearts

I've seen moonlight...

Will new winds...
