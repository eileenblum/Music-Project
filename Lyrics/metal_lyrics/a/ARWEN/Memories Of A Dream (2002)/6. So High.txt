I feel it in my soul
arising from within my heart
seeing it with my eyes

I can see hills below me
the green woods blending
with the deep blue of sea

Where am I going? I don't know
What can I find? far away...

I am flying so high
over mirror of sky
against the breeze of wind
I am beating my wings...

Running through the clouds
crossing the great ocean
leaving my world behind

All are around myself
the bright light and the song of trees
let my thoughts rise

Although sun dies when nightfalls
I'm still flying
high cloacked by the moon and the stars

Where am I going? I don't know
What can I find? far away...

I am flying so high...
