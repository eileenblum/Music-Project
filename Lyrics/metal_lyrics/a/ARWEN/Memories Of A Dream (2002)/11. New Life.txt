Broken promised and
lies for a different world
living locked below of their key

Deceits from their dirty world
trying to steal, with egoism,
the justice for all

New life carry us to wonderful times
where we'll live free without chains
we'll see the brightness of new downs
and precious twilights
looking at the rainbow under the rain

Fighting against sea and wind on the wrong way
bearinng more and more, day by day

Deceits from...

New life carry us...


Thanks to ramy_bana, stefanzyb for sending track #9 lyrics.
