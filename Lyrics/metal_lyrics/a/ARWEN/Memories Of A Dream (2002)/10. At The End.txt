Endless time... show me the way
the light of the end...
endless time... show me the way
the light of the end...

My life goes out as a flame
my old eyes die sad and tired
I feel the fear in me...(and) now
I don't feel the pain

Is she the lady of dreams?
Oh god take care for my soul!

It's a dream to me...
what's happened exactly?
why does the sun shine again?
at the end of life!

Endless time... show me the way...

I walk alone between darkness
lost in somewhere far away
I can see a light near (to) me
and a fire burns me

Is she the lady of dreams?
oh god care for my soul

It's a dream to me...
what's happened exactly?
why does the sun shine again?
at the end of life!
