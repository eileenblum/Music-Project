Look through time
fell the heat on your skin
breezes're whispering a tale
remember what I say

Girl made of stone
show me your burning heart
full of feelings that an arrow crossed

I see a light shine in your eyes
and now I know... I'm not wrong!
help me to break this thin line
between love and pain

If I cry, will you feel my tears?
If you die...

Tell me why don't you have desires
and let your dreams fly with mine
then our souls will be together
finding what real love is this time

The feel of your kiss
Steals my life and my breath
I am bonding with you, this is my desire

Maybe someday I'll be far away
But my love for you will never change

I see a light...
