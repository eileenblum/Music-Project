While the life (is in my) voice, in our hands
We're sure the effort's worht it
Time never goes by
We're dreaming awake
Flying so far, to touch the sky!

I look behind
A song rising in our lives
A journey we started long ago
And we'll keep it forever in our minds

Learning to fly
With the wings we all have inside
Trying to find new roads to walk ahead
And oceans to sail!

So many illusions have come our way
Since long time ago 'till days of today!

Awake day and hight
In a long hard fight to survive
Supporting with courage our place
'Cause we are not alone in the strife

Keeping alive
This spirit of sacrifice
For something that seemed to be mislaid!
But not for all of us!

So the song (of my heart) remains alive
Pushing me higher
I feel it, running through my veins
Grow inside me!

While the life...

Why don't you believe
If it's in front of your eyes?
Why can't we continue fighting for it?
Follow me, together we will reach the same
The way, the top of the hill!
