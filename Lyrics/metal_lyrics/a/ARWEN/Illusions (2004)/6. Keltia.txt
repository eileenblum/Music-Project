I walk under the touch
Of the frozen snow
Wind whispers new words

The forests are sad
Trees die young
Leaves change their colours and fall

Why don't birds sing again?
Why doesn't grass sing with the wind
And the sun hides while the moon dies?
Dark clouds covering light of the sky

There is something stronger
More powerfull than me
He was made to create and destroy by his hand
He hates all around him 'cause of his greed

I will search for him, through the woods
Of glass and steel, and tell him:

Far away of conscience of your minds
There's a hidden place inside of your hearts
Take care of his gift 'cause your children
Will never know how this lost place was, they'll cry
And never, never, never they will see
The beauty was around them
