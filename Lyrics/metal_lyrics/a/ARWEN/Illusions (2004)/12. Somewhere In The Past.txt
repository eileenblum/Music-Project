Where am I? Don't know how
Could I have arrived
In this age at this place 
I was sent to another strange dimension!

Someone has entrused me a mission
Taking me off to the past

So many questions
Without answers in our minds
We need the keys to resolve
What science hasn't found

Mysteries of history
Of humanity, through all the time
They will be revealed to obtain wisdom
To understand our future days

I can see:
Everything that it is unknown
And all I've ever dreamed
Memories were forgotten in a hidden world

Civilitations that did their reigns
Lost places never seen
