Beyond those cold mountains an old mansion lies
It was a silent witness of terrible crimes
Blood paints the walls with gloomy lines
Screams are drowned in the deep blackness

They were harmless young ladies
"Now we are lonely souls"
Lost ghosts, traped by a cruel and sudden death
That wander by the forgotten halls

Victims of his fearsome madness
They dance between the shadows
"Without memories in an eternal life..."
They can rest, at last

Mirrors and windows hide the terrifying truth
Rapes and tortures stained their last dying days
Blood paints the walls with gloomy lines
Screams are drowned in the deep blackness

In the night, young girls whisper their songs
Traped by a cruel and sudden death
And wander by the forgotten halls

Victims of his fearsome madness
They dance between the shadows
Without memories in an eternal life
They can rest, at last
