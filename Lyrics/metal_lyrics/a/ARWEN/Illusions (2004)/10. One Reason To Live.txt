I wake up and my day is very dark
The sadness of my soul
The pain in my brain destroy my way
And my life...
Vanishes, escapes, slips, is lost without love
I would need support!

I will try it only one more time
I can't see as everything is consumed by cold tears!

Why don't you come, take my hand
And we will walk together by this darkness
Give me only strenght to see
The reason to live and carry on with hope!

See in your eyes
Try to search in your heart
I only see war
Blood and hate around the earth
Also it has...
Passion, godness, pleasure
Caresses in this world
You now have support!

I will try to feed my illusion
You don't see as everything is consumed by cold tears!
