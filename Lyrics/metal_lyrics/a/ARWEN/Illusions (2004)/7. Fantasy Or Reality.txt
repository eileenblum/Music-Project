Long ago I wanted to know
Why may dreams come come?
Are they the reflections of our own lives?
Strange blend of my imagination
And my confused thoughts

Through the valleys of knowledge
By the long ways of wisdom
In the middle of the void
Alone with your own silence
With your inner voice

Which is the power of mind?
Where's its force?
Can we have it?
What dark secrets does it hide?
Fantasy or reality?
Where is its force?
You will know it someday!

Is it worth to have lived
To find out after all
That the best hours
Are those which we slept'?
