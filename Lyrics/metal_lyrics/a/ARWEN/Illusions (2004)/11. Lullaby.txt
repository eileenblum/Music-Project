Don't you cry, I'm right here with you
Feel the darkness running away from here
Don't you cry, I will stay with you
Nightmare, demons... all end now

So close your eyes and you will travel
To a magic world
Where peace reigns forever

Today the stars will guide your dreams and
Protect all the things above you
Tonight an angel will come to give you a kiss
Only for you
Sweet dreaming now, my little piece of love

Here we go, don't look at behind
Hold my hand and we will fly away
Here you have a thousand of adventures to live
Just choose one every night

Don't remember (the) darkness and sorrow
Come here now, back to light
