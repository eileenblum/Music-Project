Shadows darken my head
I can't remember well
Yesterday I was a quiet woman!

Why did I hace to see it?
Why must I live while while my people have been
cruelly killed?
Danmed white men that said to be our friends
Have betrayed our race!

They took from me all! I hate them! I want...
Revenge, revenge invades my soul!

Riding alone, without a course...
Drum soud is in me
And it will go on!
Riding alone, I wish...
That the spirit of wind would protect me
With his warm cloak

We revere the earth and we've been vanquished by
Other men that only want to posses her
We are worthy of respect and we've been betrayed like
savages
In a cowardly way!
There are too many Indians dead
Too much blood sheds in vane!

They took from me all!
I hate them! I want...
Revenge, revenge invades my soul!

Freedom! freedom is all my soul long for!

Flying with my horse, I'm not alone
Every sunset reminds me my home
Only a thing I know, I'm free!

Neither greed nor violence
Can take away my brother's souls!
