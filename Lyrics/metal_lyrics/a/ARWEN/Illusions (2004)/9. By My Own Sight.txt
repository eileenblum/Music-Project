You would surrender
If I talked to you about hell (Sometimes it's life)
There are no guilty but a dirty trick

When you're a survivor
There's no place where you can hide
(You'll never try again)
You walked away like the moon's shadow
With a little light, shiny light
Made with your own nightmares
Your Shangri-la is (already) near
And it's a good place to rest

You would surrender
If you could see all the world (By my own sight)
Care your wounds to begin again...

When you're a survivor
There's no place where you can hide
(You'll never try again)
You walked away like the moon's shadow
With a little light, shiny light
Made with your own nightmares
Your Shangri-la is (already) near
And it's a good place to rest
