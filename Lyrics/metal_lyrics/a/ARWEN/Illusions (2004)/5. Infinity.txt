Only void, only silence
A point of bright light
Was lost in deep darkness

Energy, strong forces
United for the beginning of existence
Then a miracle came out
Millions of stars, thousands of planets
In harmony were painted
The space for coming life

If we are alone in the universe
How much space is wasted
I want to see far beyond all we know
I need to understand, find the answers
Why can we reach real truth'
Where's the key to survive?
To this incessant doubt?

Deep black holes, rings of fire
Great neboulouses, distant galaxies
Oceans of different colours
Lands of tomorrow shine at night
Divine forms through sky line
Misterious signs that time can't erase
Will the infinity be there in the future days?
