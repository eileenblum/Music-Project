Man evolves and spreads like a cancer, peace is terminal, effect is nothing what is progress when outcomes fail?
The chaos enslaves all beauty then dies, you exist for nothing / all alone in thrall to the void, yoked to the herd
and feeding on the shit, belief attacking the truth, more vicious than the lies, now I shoot the hat into the open vein
you exist for nothing
