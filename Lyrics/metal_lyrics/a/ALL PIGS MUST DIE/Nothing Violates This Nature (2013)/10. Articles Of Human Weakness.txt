Nothing violates this nature, this nature violates all, honed by cruelty we cling to humanity, existence an illusion deep in the bowels of god, floating through the abyss, the prayers never heard. Nothing violates this nature, this nature violates all, honed by cruelty we cling to humanity, breeding parasites, sucking on a wound, engorged shameless blood is the overlord, we all succumb starved diseased reduced to nothing, crushing bone to dust, all is lost, abandon all hope
