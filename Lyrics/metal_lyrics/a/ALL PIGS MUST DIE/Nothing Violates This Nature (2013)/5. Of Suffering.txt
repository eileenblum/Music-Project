Somewhere black clouds of smoke billowing, it seems the nest of wickedness is in the flames,
mobs strip women penetrate them with their knives, starving fathers kill their brood for the meat
brutal campaigns of mutilation, abducted and slain, clerics reflect the fury, staining blood to the streets, 
terror cloaked by religion, kill in god's name, only death is lurking, creeping sickness awaits
do you wonder why god loves them? Do you know they take no blame? The way they lie, hears no guilt
hand in hand in all, who will win the war in god's name?
