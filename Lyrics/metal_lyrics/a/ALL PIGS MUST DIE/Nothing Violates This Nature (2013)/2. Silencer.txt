The lights go out, pulse never raised, god hates man, the souls intersect, rope grips touch, burden the cross
arrange it wise, my will is all, 
to he reflected, in pleading eyes, clutch forgiveness, weakness divine, I am among you, as hunger grows the life you're given is mine to hold, see you suffer, watch you die, your tortured ghost has come to this,
see you suffer, watch you die, your tortured ghost has come to this
I am among you, as hunger grows the life you're given is mine to hold
