Belief is an instrument of deceit, a sham of thought or action, love of mankind is fatal, a great despiser distrust all
Faith eater, to embrace the degenerate is to abandon the predator, open the door to sacrifice, laugh at the open
grave / faith eater / as lambs led to slaughter, writhe in its voice, equally pathetic, blind and lost, the way is worn a million times over, now you must follow the herd, faith eater, drive nails into silence, faith eater, drive nails into fire, faith eater
