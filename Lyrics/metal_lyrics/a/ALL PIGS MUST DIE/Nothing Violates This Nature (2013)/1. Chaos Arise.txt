Hail the pitiful lie, the parasite of man, the age of total decay and endless misery 
chaos arise
the death of balance, can never be undone, idols smashed to bits and cities reduced to ash, 
what man creates, man destroys, if it is built then it will burn
chaos arise
the hour of great contempt, the arousal of disgust, scorn for scorn, no shepherd, one herd, desperate enthroned kings, the privileged, model of truth, the fruitful mother of popular error its many faces, its thousand roots
what man creates, man destroys, if it is built then it will burn
