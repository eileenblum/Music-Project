Ignorant, arrogant, petulant, cultural ruination, social chaos universal law, sick parts of a sick thing, come all and bear witness, instinct breeds the butcher, there is a war, its a machine, it must run in the truest form of blood.
kill in the name of divine love, all cut from the same bloodied cloth, arms wrapped tight around the beast
binge of endless violence, from the cities to the sands. death rules us [?] all
