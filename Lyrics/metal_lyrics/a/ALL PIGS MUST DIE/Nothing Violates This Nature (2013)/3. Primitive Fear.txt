Starving for salvation, primitive mortal fear, hated breath it stalks me, filling space, stopping time, ever present the shadow looms, convulsing and paralyzed, black earth take me back, soil of the birth giver, swallow it whole again
terror beyond the words, air drawn from bleeding lungs, total hatred owns my soul, so all is end, all is end
black earth take me back, 
cleanse purify purge all life, my one true god, the death bed shakes, dimensions join as one, eyes slammed shut, praying for the descent
