Frothing at the mouth
hungry wolf on easy prey
bastard sou,l crawling in my flesh
this war you cannot win
sink into your graves
stupid filth get in line and fucking die
ugly world, smash upon sleeping heads
praise your gods, hell is what is left
strangle what you hold
so dearly in your heart
cursed seed fueling me, chaos is the law
human scum infect, kill everything in your path
burn this planet dead, you blood stained whores
hungry wolf
easy prey
bastard soul, in my flesh
