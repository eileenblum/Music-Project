Hung on damnation's rope, deception raping your mind
diseased by ancient lies, man's manufactured demise
death is your only faith, war is the one religion
flock to your rotten god like a moth to a flame
born, bred, die ignorant
march in the rivers of blood, justified in your cause
blind, you see no light, righteous abject fight
death is your only faith, war is the one religion
flock to your rotten god like a moth to a flame
