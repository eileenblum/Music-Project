Destroy, killer of man, war, plague, alpha omega
hell, deliver the pain, dispose a world of fools
cold, emotional void, soulless is your god
live, according to this, chaos is it's name
as it is, so be it
sermon for the end
despise ultimate truth, no escape, death is your fate
scourge, nature's design, darkness swallows you whole
smash, take every life, nothing saved, nothingness
merge, the forces align, a sermon for the end
