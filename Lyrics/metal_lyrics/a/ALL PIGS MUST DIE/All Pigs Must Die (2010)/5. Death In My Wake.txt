Crack this mortal shell
bleed this hateful soul
clear my eyes behold
darkness ripping out
burn this house of lies
watch this world die
death in my wake
hooks of bondage tear
deep in to the hand
sharp my ears reveal
darkness screaming out
death in my wake
burn this house of lies
watch this world die
