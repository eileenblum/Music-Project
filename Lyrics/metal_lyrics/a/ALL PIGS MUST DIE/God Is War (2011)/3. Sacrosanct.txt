To live with them is to deny the beast that keeps us human
Itâs to become a pallid lie
The sad frail modern man
If thatâs their hope then I have none
Belief in them gives no quarter
Now hate them and see them exactly what they are
To grope truth
To deal in lies
To accept the foul order
The filth will rise
The weak shall rule
Soul is cheap in their virtue
Now give away
Now sacrifice
Your answers are force fed
No hate them and see them exactly what they are
Savior may fire consume the earth
