Black midnight sun
Endless void appear
Dark shadow purged eons
Death pulling you near
Dawn never come
World fall undone
Night of no end
Burning black sun
Twelve arms unite
The killers of light
You are the birth
You are the rite
Burning cities fall
Far as eyes will see
No graves, no coffins
Bodies fill the street
Dawn never come
World fall undone
Night of no end
Burning black sun
You are the birth
You are the rite
Destroy
Destroy
Return to nothing
