Man is born, along with war
Ultimate master, of the ultimate trade
The will of one, against another
Bound and forced, the pigs will have blood
God is war
Bred to select, erase from existence
Invention of morals, crushed by truth
Global order, defined by nature
Bound and forced, the pigs will have blood
God is war
