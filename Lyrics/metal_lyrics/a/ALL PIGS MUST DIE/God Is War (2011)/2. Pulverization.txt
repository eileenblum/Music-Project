Brutal conflict, the horror of war
Witness the torture, youâll never endure
Pulverized, youâre blown to bits
Crush the scum, they are worthless
Indoctrinate and sacrifice
Fifteen years old, and ready to die
For her faith, she will destroy
Execution the only reward
In cold blood
Wipe them out
Grip of death
Kills them all
