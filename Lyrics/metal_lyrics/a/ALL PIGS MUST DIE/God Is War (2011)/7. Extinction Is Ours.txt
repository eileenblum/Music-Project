Behold the harvest storm of death
Feel atomic flame steal your breath
The final nightmare has begun
The serpentâs wings have blocked out the sun
Fire, give life to hell and burn
Torrents of blood, hatred and pain
Fallout blankets, the dying remains
Orgy of doom, gesture of might
Survivors choke in the endless night
