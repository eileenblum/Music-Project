Viktor bout, lord of war, merchant of death
Conduit of terror, agent of torment
Endless out pour of global scum
Vultures of the end
Wretched filth pay to thee
Father still born breath
The soil soaked with blood
Ethnic cleansing
Profit from a gun
Killer of them all upon a throne of flesh
Rotting from within
The ashes of man lift
Adrift in wind and fire
Above the world that is
Suffer on to thee
Father still born breath
Merchant of death
