Endless refuse in a world of shit
Flies swarm their starving heads
Whereâs your god, he is fucking dead
No reprieve, you are all condemned
Massacre of human life
Total death in the age lies
Violence spreads across the world
No hope, all will burn
Isolate and scorn the herd
Force the doctrine of cruelty learned
Target and efface the heathen ones
Mass extinction, the beast smells blood
Massacre of human life
Total death in the age of lies
Violence spreads across the world
No hope, all will burn
The cries call out to empty skies
Angels see through warlords eyes
Superstitions have claimed you all
Know that war is the will of god
