Emerge from the womb
With savage intent
Prisoners of flesh
March, conquer, collapse
Helpless and broken
An eternal struggle
Rival gods
Keep us flooding the world
In blood
Crawling in the cages of misery
A black hole
At the center of everything
Crusade of the violent mind
There's no escape
The promise of death
Always breathing down your neck
Crawling in the cages of misery
A black hole
At the center of everything
Hostage animal
