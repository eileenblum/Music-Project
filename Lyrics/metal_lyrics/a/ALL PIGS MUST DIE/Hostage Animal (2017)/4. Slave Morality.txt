Natural law the tyranny
Famine of uncertainty
Blood and the fire
Terrible aspect of it's source
The filth of it's soul
Indifference as the power
Detachment as its purity
Last trust in a sure nothing
Rise as the tide
Deny with spite
The outward show
The porous mind
The truth of war
The truth of hate
Hope leaves its stain
As with the slave
