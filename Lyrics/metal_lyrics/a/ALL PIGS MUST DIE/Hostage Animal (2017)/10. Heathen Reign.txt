A killing machine ready to die
Vicious combat in the mud and blood
Chained strangled submit to none
Extinguish life through force of will
Proud yet fearing masters
Their time has passed
A killing machine ready to die
Bastard followers of a white christ
Devour their own god to free from sin
Drink his blood eat his flesh
Driven by hatred more than revenge
To the fringes of the earth
The heathen escapes the cross
The beginning is the end
And there is no god
Bound by traditions of endless torture
They make us what is dead
Could I ever forgive my father
For bringing me to this place
