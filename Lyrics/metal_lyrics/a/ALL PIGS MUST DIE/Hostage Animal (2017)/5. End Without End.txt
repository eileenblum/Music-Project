Slaves give birth to slaves
In a vile rite of pain and ash
When vanity is stripped away
Brutal force becomes authority
The nation state is a giant grave
The rule is endless insanity
Perpetual cancer hissing forth
Its independence is a shackle to the soul
Feeble breed for war and plague
Population rooted in shame
Its end without end
