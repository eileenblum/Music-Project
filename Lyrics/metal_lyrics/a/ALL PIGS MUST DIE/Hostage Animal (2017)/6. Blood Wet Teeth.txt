Nature exhale death, destroy
Pain rains from above
Total hatred instill this nightmare
Mouth of hell wide open
Blood wet teeth devours all flesh
Life eats life there is no peace
Climb higher on the crashing wave
The final wake a world of ruin
Hear the last feral scream
Nature exhale death, destroy
Mouth of hell wide open
Blood wet teeth devours all flesh
Bringing the end
