Reality, murder in a second degree
Jury is the executor I foresee
Forbidden, forsaken, bleeding to death
Privilege of agony, an ultimate aggression

Suffer through the loss of dismal grace
Ones who were killing themselves on your face
Contradiction, red demolition
You sink into my greed, no matter if you die

Brutality, all we see infinite for obsession
A rapist of sanity is our belief
Forgotten for nothing, arise of the dark
I'll take you down kill like a hound in the night

Struggle with a beast to hunt your rights
War is the closest friend you fight
The last possession and first violence
Beaten, abused, I don't hear your cries

Walk down the line and you see
There's no things to reveal from the past
Where is justice we elected
Where is devotion we selected
Where is the point when innocence turns to hatred

Ghosts of time are arising in my eyes
I can't resist the picture of reality
Put your head between two justice
And show with your lies when something must be done

Digging out your own grave I see a failure
Rusty cool bitch with the stitch of a hammer on your forehead
Hey yeah there is nothing to see, leave me fuck alone
Alone with the souls of death
