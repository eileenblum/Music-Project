You won't get yourself down and crawl on the ground for praying mercy
You won't pay attention by kneeling and show you got no life worth living

You're just embody of a creature in the state of a human
Deception
You only exist in appearance of betrayal and deception
Deceiver
I'm too exhausted to be always numb
It seems you're talking but I don't understand

Dismay, I have one pray
Life won't be paid until your final guilt
Ask me, collect your belief
Ascend from the depths of corruption and waste

There's no reflection from the past to make impression
The second coming is a freedom's reality
A closing decision
