Sixteen years in a deep manhole never conversation-low life
Deal your life with a devil's bound deep down underground-low life
Sixteen corpse of revolution, stinking flesh and spilling blood
Welcome to my fearless head, no limit for a new decay

Never, she's a devil she keeps me under pressure
Never, she's a devil she takes me to aggression

I am something else than innocence
I am devil of your head and evil in a man

Living dead inside my head a timeless boundary-low life
Walking through the empty core of my rotten bone-low life
Sisters loving evolution
Filth of naughty witch of blood
Meet the reaper at the gates of my fear and mind remains

Have you lost your mind I said are you insane
Emptiness surrounding your thoughts
Devil is a hunter of existing space
Does it really happen when you said you're right
Have you lost control
Have you seen the victims on your backyard
Have you seen them dressed in a devil's suite
