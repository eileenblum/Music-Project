Do you feel the breathe
Squeeze around your neck
The swollen eyes

Low like a bitch on the street of trash
Share a couple hits with a death of crash
Hangman's digging out an empty grave
Devil gets the hollow and beats the brave

Inhale before you lose control
Lack of the life creates your fall
Demons lurking behind your back
And you lead you out of the track

Shadows with the colors and a million years
Disappearing, into the darkest fear

Your past it will never die
It haunts you 'til the end of time

Get yourself fixed, look out straight
Lesson one to be out of my way

Shadows with the colors and a million years
Disappearing into the darkest fear

Escape through the loss, the trails of pain
Appearing on your sight with a million fakes
Shadows with the colors
A million years are disappearing

In this room the doors are sealed with flesh
The bodies of our future connected to the past
Exhale brutality of toxicated human
Born again and suffer
Die and reach the pleasure
Inhale reality of stimulated matters
