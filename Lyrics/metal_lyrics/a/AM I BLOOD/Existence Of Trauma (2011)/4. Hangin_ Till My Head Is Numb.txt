It's burning your eyes stimulating the mind
Wreck of the body is collapsing inside

I feel you're the only one that I hate
I know you're the only pain in my life when you live

Squeezing your brains paralyzing the legs
All I give a shit is how you prepay

I feel you're the only pain in my life 'cause you live

I'm feeling little insane 'cause you're smiling like a freak
Do I have to cut your throat before you start to speak

I should be hanging 'til my head is numb
Somebody cut the rope too fast
I should be wailing 'til suffocation
But I hit the ground too fast

Terminating my pride no remorse for a prayer
Remains of my body is the cure for disease

I should be hanging 'til my head is numb
Somebody cut the rope too fast
I should be wailing 'til suffocation
But I hit the ground too fast
I wanna hang 'til my head is numb
Do not cut the rope
