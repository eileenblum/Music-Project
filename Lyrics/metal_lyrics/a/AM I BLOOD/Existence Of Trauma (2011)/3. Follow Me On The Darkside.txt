Time is a blood for living psychos
Rapes all the weak and kiss 'em to death
Power of the green too insane
No limitation for the war you're marching in

You can destroy but you can't conquest me
You can damage me but you can't win this fight

Your luck is a dirt on the face
Hits a word of the beast you say
You never die you were never born
In your soul there is no remorse

You can judge me but you can't contempt me
You can paralyze but you can't rip my soul apart

Once again you follow me on the darkside
I will never breath until you bleed by my side
Painless end is vanity of your last depression
Live for your endless sadness
