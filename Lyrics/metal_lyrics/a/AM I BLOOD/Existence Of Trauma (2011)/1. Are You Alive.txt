Crying, sick of all and no one hears
I take a chance to incline my fate
To have a strength to be disregarded
Of life I despise
Strike, when you see you got only enemies
I'm your power on the field
And the source when we defeat

Jesus wept a burning tear
With his blind eye he couldn't see it clear

Full speed, nothing else, fuck 'em all I don't care
I'm a detonator of your death
On my scale I count to 4
To even out the superior force
Suck your brains, hit your face
Nothing seems to be the same
Aliens of brutal war
On the field there's no repent
Only screams of violent hate

Hollow dreams I understand
Not the wrong side you keep dragging me around

Are you alive you think, kneel down
Obey, I say
I sweep the barrel before you close your eyes
Are you alive you pray
Spit the blood and feel the pain
I sweep the barrel before you close your eyes

Silent screams that whispering
Dust to dust they die on my arms
Like the wind full of dead souls

Fighting with your faith, everything in your brains
Try to find a fatal pain
To overtake your final insanity
Of the light that feeds your mind
Kill, when you see, you got only bullet for yourself
You are the only enemy
In a war of your disbelief
