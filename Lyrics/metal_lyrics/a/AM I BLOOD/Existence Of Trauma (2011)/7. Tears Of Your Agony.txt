God is believer and I have to feed him
But all I got is a shot in my eye
Show me salvation, some kind of gain
When all the tricks to go on are gone

Gotta get myself killed face down
Gonna dive through the dark loss
Gotta get myself ahead I'm not done
Get high I'm not on the lost line

Tears of your agony
Souls in a coma
The pain is still in me
Tears of your agony
Brains in a trauma
The pleasure is all inside

My faith is unconscious and I can't deny it
Too hard to understand the point
Caused my affection, struggle of anger
I was born with the bullet in a mouth

Seeking for the darkness of reality
Get down it will overcome now
Tracking for the trails of never seen road
I drag you to the land of black hearts
