Fear, extension is the goal
To be buried or burned inside
Leave me out of the last confession
I caught the pace when you fell high

Cold addiction freezes my brains
No one could be nearly sane
I am here
Your exception
Until you lock yourself in the frames

More excited deep in your veins
I took the power to be king of your heart

Dedicate all the faith, insurrection
But don't kneel your face against the wall
Come and take
Don't be afraid

All the same if you fade
Through the gates of black unknown

You were already gone
When I tried to reach you from the mass of bodies
Suicide killed them all
Before the dawn became their pride

This violated world is spinning in my head and makes me confused
Is it just the dead who walk on earth when the life is ending

Segregated from this world
Nobody stand straight on their own
Humiliated by their talk
No mercy, don't spit out your words

Supremacy of a deadly game
Calculation of a satanic configuration
Spill the blood
Break the hearts
It never will save your skin
And I stand my head above the heaven
