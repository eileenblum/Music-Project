Pledge of belief creates my anger
Not a part of me can never be the same

Your delusion is the way you choose to be
Like a lack of nothing
Disgrace you'll reveal
You're a winner
At least your lies are fulfilled with self-esteem

The light that you release it feeds my hunger
The spirit of a sacred
It spears the evil one's

Your religion is the way you chose to die
For the numbers without the truth to see
You are divine
At last you got what you've been searching and never could find

I speak with different language, some out of understanding
I have religious anger, my head is full of hatred

Faith is your deceiver I'm just the sin of believer
Your faith-Faith is the traitor I am the sin of betrayer

Unfaithful instigators
Gathering the mass of hatred
How come you always choose to walk on the right side

No more lies no more tears
Revenge is coming back and you're the one to aim
I guess I'm gonna get rid off you
Do you believe what I say
