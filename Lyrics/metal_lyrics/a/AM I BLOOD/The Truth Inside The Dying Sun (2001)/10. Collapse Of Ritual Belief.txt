From now on I'm an executive dynasty
When your eyes begun to blind
Infinite desire 
Deed of charity
satiated For occupation of Queenly mystery
Through the flames back to fantasies
I'll obtain my faith

How long will last the spirit in my blood
A Second of conspiracy
Naked under a world of rage

To become stigmatized as a Saviour
And a yielding besets the flight
An imposing termination
I'll convert your thoughts
Insincerely I come across the doors
Loss beyond return with a proud of my arise
Nearly occupied

How long will last the spirit in my blood
A Second of conspiracy
Naked under a world of rage
Wicked for destiny's embrace

I forsee when hatred becomes my
Collapse Of Ritual Belief
I forsee devotion turns against
Collapse Of Ritual Belief

From now on I instigate for nullity
Prosperity declines
Finite submission
Instigation-Defeat
Castigated by replaced misery
Broken endurance
Through the pain back to suffering
I'll obtain my faith

How long will...
I forsee...
