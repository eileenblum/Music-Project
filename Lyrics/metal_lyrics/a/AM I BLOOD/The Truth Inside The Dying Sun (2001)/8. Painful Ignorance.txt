Darkness ends where the shadows become my fate
The place where I can drown to
Fearless for the sanctuary of tears 
Trapped inside of weakness
Where my sanity became part of me
And the one part of sleepless night
This night that becomes my fatal dream

Embrace of a cold kissing moment
Shivers the face of the hollow screams
The hollow screams of unseen disbelief

The picture of their peaceful unforgiving
Remains in a memory
Mindless for the sanctuary of fear
Awakening from disgrace

Where my sanity became to a part of hate
To the one part of sleepless night
This night that becomes my fatal dream

Get closer to the Painful Ignorance
Invited to escape
Into to the gage of humanity
Painful Ignorance
Come closer
Painful Ignorance
Invited to my gage

Darkness ends where the shadows become my fate
The place where I can drown to
Fearless for the sanctuary of tears 

Awakening from disgrace
Where my sanity became to a part of me
To the one part of sleepless night
This night that becomes my fatal dream

Get closer...
