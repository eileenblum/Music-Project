Standing right here I cover my face
Too late to see how weak is your faith
Longer I live
Deeper's your cult
Angry for selfish filth

You try to keep your face and cover your pain 
Is there humanity in you
You try to keep your face and cover your pain
And that's the weakest side in you

Crawling down here
You're chasing my flesh
No time to swear for your conviction
Harder I scream
Stronger's your lust
Degrade
The potency's the source

You try to...

Must be waiting here 
Until your hands have tied my life
WHY!
Must be waiting here 
Until your hands have tied my life

Standing right here I cover my face
Too late to see how weak is your faith
Longer I live
Deeper's your cult
Angry for selfish filth

You try to...

There's only hatred in a world
Where you're living your life
And Nothing seems to be Realistic in your mind
WHY!
Must be waiting here 
Until your hands have tied my life
