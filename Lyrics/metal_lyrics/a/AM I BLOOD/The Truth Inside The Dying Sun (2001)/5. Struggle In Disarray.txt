It's just a second and this all crash
You made room for life but they blind you
It's just a moment when you all scream
They're marching across the sand and through happiness

Silent waves I only hear them bleeding
The day has turned to darken the end
You cannot stand yourself
Struggle to keep all together

Why can't I feel my legs
Why can't I breath this open air

Opposite of fantasies ticking
Counting bodies of the loss
Mother Earth will serve the rich
As the death brings the silence

Silent waves...

Struggle In Disarray
Can't breath this air
Beseech to cut my life
Struggle In Disarray
Can't breath this air
Beseech to cut my life and let me
Struggle In Disarray
I can't breath
Struggle In Disarray
Can't breath this air
Beseech to cut my life and let me

It's like a family you've never met
Can't find no words no language to speak
It's not a reason for what they've done
Enemies of well-to-do, Hysteria

Why can't I feel my legs
Why can't I breath this open air

Struggle in...
