I sleep alone tonight
Before I wake I always see
That dream where everything is dark 
But I feel I`m tied with chains
It won`t let me go 
it won`t let me wake 
Before I`ve seen that scary thing
Which makes my life like misery

Walk through there`s a cradle where you`re crying
Laughing crowd with a sound too strange
I`ve seen it from everyside and everytime
I`m loosing that same
It could satisfied my hunger
Leave me be
I`ve gone with you

This waiting hour seems to last like pain
I feel inside
Every morning the same dream makes me 
Weak and suffer

Taste me 
You`ll see when it ends
Before there`s something to control me
Won`t resist you if you choose to do your own way
But the anger there`s left 
For longer there will be no rest
I'll drag you down with me

I`ve Gone With You
Somewhere-Nowhere-Someday

You`ve seen a poor child begging 
He became diposed to anger
So the world raised its hand against ignorent son
And the anger there`s left will never fade from this
head
I`ll drag you down with me

I`ve Gone With You
Somewhere-Nowhere-Someday
