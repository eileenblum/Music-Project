A bear to the brains is what you seek
Helmet is a fuel to feed every young being
Come over me my rising sun girl
Lizzard crawling deep in eccentric you

It's just a piece of you
You never gave me nothing
Melodic friend of mood
Are you happy

This witch ain't my baby just a sugar pie honey
Giving low price where she moves
Spell made a bitch with a hard core lips
Sins of immoral deeds

It's just a piece of you
You never gave me nothing
Melodic friend of mood
Are you happy

Bitch is part of you
Carcass of a wellfare state
Two blocks away from the street
Lovely good for nothing

Bitch is eternal you
Bitch is a part of you
Bitch is eternal you
Bitch is a part of you

Loaded head, full of acid rain
Get yourself ready, for exploding stand
Natural war's leading the beat of bullet
Guns save, as many lifes they're killing now

It's just a piece of you
You never gave me nothing
Melodic friend of mood
Are you happy

Bitch is part of you
Carcass of a wellfare state
Two blocks away from the street
Lovely good for nothing

Bitch is eternal you
Bitch is a part of you
Bitch is eternal you
Bitch is a part of you
