A little child and unspoken words
His dream was too deep in dirt
The only thing what he wanted to see
Was a tale that they should not hear
The colours of the sky turn black
Why to ask there's nothing to know
Happiness - Forever - It's gone
I'll tell you why you stained my heart

They expected I take them as God
In the hands, on the weakest arms
Building their future into my head
To be the master of my dying self

The soul of rape through the darkness
I can feel all their hatred
Feed your growing pain inside me
Can you stand all this torture

Never slept too long and deep
Before the dawn his screams begun
Why to stand beyond my shadow
I try to reach the truth of love

The soul of rape through the darkness
I can feel all their hatred
Feed your growing pain inside me
Can you stand all this torture

The last cry for suffocated love
Today is the day to make them fall
The last cry for suffocated love
Today is the day to get some more

The promises are burning deep in my thoughts
The colors of the lost became clearly back
I believe in time I have to forget
It's a lie, I can make you sure

The soul of rape through the darkness
I can feel all their hatred
Feed your growing pain inside me
Can you stand all this torture

Empty fields, one by one
I can't escape the smell of bones
Stripping happy with naked bodies
Rage is all what I could ever see


The last cry for suffocated love
Today is the day to make them fall
The last cry for suffocated love
Today is the day to get some more
The last cry for suffocated love
Today is the day to make them fall
The last cry for suffocated love
Today is the day to get some more
