Into my head
Into my pride
Cannot say I'm satisfied
Crawling into my enemies
Never seen a war before
Where I'm loosing my recall

Night disgracing me
Nothing can press me
Night disgracing me
Nothing can cross me

Pathetic prick
Unconscious teen
Blowing wind a new atmosphere
Straight to the heart into my blood
Never seen a war before
Where I'm loosing my recall

Night disgracing me
Nothing can press me
Night disgracing me
Nothing can cross me

Sorrow, my sanity
Is falling down with my hollow soul
Cries of the night so low
Calling me back to their home

Face of the state where
I'm a diseased culture
Keeping full speed when I cross you
Head in a mask blast through the dusk
Never seen a war before
Where I'm loosing my recall

Night disgracing me
Nothing can press me
Night disgracing me
Nothing can cross me

Sorrow, my sanity
Is falling down with my hollow soul
Cries of the night so low
Calling me back to their home


Night disgracing me
Nothing can press me
Night disgracing me
Nothing can cross me

Sorrow, my sanity
Is falling down with my hollow soul
Cries of the night so low
Calling me back to their home
Sorrow, my sanity
Is falling down with my hollow soul
Cries of the night so low
Calling me back to their home
