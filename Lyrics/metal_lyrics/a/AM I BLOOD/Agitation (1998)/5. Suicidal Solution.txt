My hate has never gone
Divulge a distrust to you
Plenary overcharges
Killing all which can't be saved
Come like surprise
Trying to scan opposites
Against delusions
The real mistery of my mind

Struggle with aggression
The shadows of freedom
Loaded obsession
My battle of weakness
Lays down dispirited
Excuses of solitude

Hunt of the truth
Entices I need to join
Lost of disarray
A call to sleepless divinity

Struggle with agression
The shadows of freedom
Loaded obsession
My battle of weakness
Lays down dispirited
Excuses of solitude

Next to necromancers breath
Escape, my victory
Staring above my innerself
Suicidal solution

Making me laugh
Penetrate a hundred of plans
Trip into mystery
Entrance to pregnancy

Struggle with agression
The shadows of freedom
Loaded obsession
My battle of weakness
Lays down dispirited
Excuses of solitude

Next to necromancers breath
Escape, my victory
Staring above my innerself
Suicidal solution
Next to necromancers breath
Escape, my victory
Staring above my innerself
Suicidal solution
