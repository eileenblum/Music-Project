I sleep alone tonight 
Before I wake I always see 
That dream where everything is dark 
But I feel I`m tied with chains 
It won`t let me go 
it won`t let me wake 
Before I`ve seen that scary thing 
Which makes my life like misery 

Walk through there`s a cradle where you`re crying 
Laughing crowd with a sound too strange 
I`ve seen it from everyside and everytime 
I`m loosing that same 
It could satisfied my hunger 
Leave me be 
I`ve gone with you 

This waiting hour seems to last like pain 
I feel inside 
Every morning the same dream makes me 
Weak and suffer 

Taste me 
You`ll see when it ends 
Before there`s something to control me 
Won`t resist you if you choose to do your own way 
But the anger there`s left 
For longer there will be no rest 
I'll drag you down with me 

I`ve Gone With You 
Somewhere-Nowhere-Someday 

You`ve seen a poor child begging 
He became diposed to anger 
So the world raised its hand against ignorent son 
And the anger there`s left will never fade from this 
head 
I`ll drag you down with me 

I`ve Gone With You 
Somewhere-Nowhere-Someday
