My sun, I see the truth inside of me
And the heavens that are is far beyond the hell I stand
And it's open as sky as a mind
You could face this thing before you lose the time

Fight this sorrow instead of precious silence
Return your favour, it doesn't matter how you live
Fight this sorrow instead of precious silence
Return your favour, it doesn't matter how you live

I told you everything you got on that way
And the question is still without my sight you reach
And it's closer than my heart and my dream
When you would just leave me suffering alone

Forget the price cos I have to pay it anyway
Escape your tears and let's see why you feel
Forget the price cos I have to pay it anyway
Escape your tears and let's see why you feel

Going down again
In this hell I stand
With a handful of words and nothing else

Going down again
In this hell I stand
With a handful of words and nothing else

We start to adapt to this waking pain
I barely can describe what's been plaguing our sight
When you're slow everything I embrace this way
You left me alone with suffering

Forget the price cos I have to pay it anyway
Escape your tears and let's see why you feel
Forget the price cos I have to pay it anyway
Escape your tears and let's see why you feel

Going down again
In this hell I stand
With a handful of words and nothing else
