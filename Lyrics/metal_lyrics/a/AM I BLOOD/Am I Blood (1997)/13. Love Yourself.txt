Turning to myself the old breed is standing
In front of natural human
The wrong side of forty years
There's something wrong with me

I don't know what I should believe
Where I want there's not much to see

Think I knew before it was over
If you understood how to say
Written order between the lines
Leave this hell without fear

If you feel you can be on my side
Love yourself before you hate

All these visions passing by a mind
With a turtle eyes I could see
Anyhow it's on the way
What could better be
Love yourself before you hate
