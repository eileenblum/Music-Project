You feel the hunger for terminal beat
The heart is sinking
I live my days by hearing your dreams
And will to pain

No waiting until the dawn
Your bleeding empty soul

The real lies of friendly mind
Can't touch your face
I came in peace but I leave this
Place with war inside of me

So come and realize
Look through my mind and see

I can feel the fuckin' things
That burn inside of me
Cannot feel I'm freezin' more

The hate of dream with ultimate scream
To get my pride back
I have a lust for deadly deed
Curious to find me
