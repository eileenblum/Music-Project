Blood kissing mister in a home-freak story
Pulls the teeth out of bone flaked arm
Fucker little beast like boring mother
Small head inside her room-mate

For your love if I do this thing to you
Cold meat eats my liver in raining sun

Science no loyal deeds hide with me
Killing people turning outside from themselves
Mastering eternity I found your bleeding head
Mastering eternity I found your bleeding head
From the room of ecstasy

Crawling deep into the story
Waiting of my awakening
Nothing seems to change the way of dream
You've planned, not to be served
For all feelings that die to unreal limits can't be alone
One of the lives you tried to choose
Was not for sale, again you fail

Send me an evil from long salvation
Black stinking blood runs into my mouth
The cats of pale gray sticking at the bodies
Mouse with turtle's shields
