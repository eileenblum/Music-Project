Sad to love the dark side of my eternal energy
Screaming at the emptiness the only time is past
Lurking with a pure virginity a suffering
The goal I see on my visual field disappears so far

[Chorus:]
Calling myself to be connected
Split at the time of uneducated
Holding a distance to give what I could
Staggered with admiration sure I will

The shelter of mine can't be a misty wind of fatal sky

Home near by my grave is just a warmless energy

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Pain grows from the heart I found a piece of humanity
The endless souls of hate feeding their insanity
Aching ice won't last this torture of self-command
Like liquid energy is spouting from a needle's end

Scared to be in love with enemies I met again
The fit of laughter my disaster overturns the ground

[Repeat Chorus]

[Repeat Bridge]
