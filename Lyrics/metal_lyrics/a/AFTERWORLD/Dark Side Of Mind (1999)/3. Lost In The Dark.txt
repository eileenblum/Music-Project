I don't know what is going on, I want to find myself
everything keeps spinning in my head, someone help me now
Memories is everything I have, I want to find my self
Only darkness, darkness everywhere
Lost, lost in the dark, the darkness kills me piece by piece
Lost, lost in the dark...
Illusions starts to take my mind, I want to find myself
Was it me and was the bullet mine, someone help me now
Now I know everything has gone, I want to find myself
Only darkness, darkness everywhere
God why can`t I take my life, I don`t want to live much longer
Hey can someone hear me now, someone who is much more stronger
