Government keeps telling us how to live our lives
everything goes just fine if we don`t resist
You can do nothing on your own, you`re just like doll
You can do nothing on your own
After all it`s always money why they must do their tricks
Without money without power that is what they believe
We can`t resist the rules they make, `cos they have power to kill
Our life is nothing more than a fake, they have power to kill
We just have to try to go on, without power to kill
We have the faith, so we don`t need, the power to kill
Perhaps tomorrow is brighter than we see
What if there`s no more fear and anger
Perhaps tomorrow we can laugh `cos we are free
and they`re lying deep in their graves
