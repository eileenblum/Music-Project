The night was coal-black when someone got it wrong,
that night was cursed by the shadows of the war
Too many reasons, too many minds
Flames of hell now raging everywhere
What is happening no one know`s
you just keep thinking is it time to go
If you keep listening you can hear it too
There`s no more sounds of life, no sunny afternoon
Feels like you`re drowned, waiting for the deadend
You can not breathe, you can not move, feel`s like you`r no one
Judgement day, people screaming for their fear,
and you know, the end becomes
Let it go, there`s no time to sacrifice
`cos you know, the end becomes
And you are hoping it`s getting easier
But it feels harder time after time
And there is no one who can help you know
You are on your own, and there is no way out
