Their life was just beginning, they didn`t know what`s fear
The day was warm but cloudy, and their eyes were so clear
But out in the alley, there was a man carrying a gun
His mind was full of evil, thinking it must be done
And he went in to the schoolhouse, and there they were, playing
sixteen innocent children, sixteen innocent children
Sick man with the rifle, they didn`n have the right to live
sixteen innocent children, sixteen innocent children
Their age was only seven, they had their lives ahead
Now they`re in fields of heaven, because of that man they`re dead
What is wrong with this man, can someone be so cruel?
What is wrong with the people, can someone be so cruel?
Under my skin is the devil, under my skin is the devil
That`s why I`m doing what I do
Under my skin is the devil, under my skin is the devil
That`s why I don`t care is it me or is it you
