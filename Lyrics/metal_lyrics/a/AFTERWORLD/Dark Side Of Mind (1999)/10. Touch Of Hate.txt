Night after night I`m dreaming does life have to be this way day after day again?
Time after time I`m thinking do I have to live like this day after day again? Too much, too far
Waiting for the miracle, waiting for the people to learn
Praying for the miracle, praying for that dream doesn`t burn
Life after life we`re asking if we can`t go on like this day after day again? Too close, too little
Do you see the faith is falling, we have a touch of hate
Can you feel the evil is calling, we have a touch of hate
Do you hear the nature is crying, we have a touch of hate
Can you say the world isn`t dying, we have a touch of hate
God, forgive their sins, `cos they don`t know, what they`r doingâ¦
