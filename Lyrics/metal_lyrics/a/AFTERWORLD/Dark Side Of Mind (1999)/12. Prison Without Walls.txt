So many colours in my sight, So many sick things in my mind
I want to find the new way of life, I want to live or die
Everything I feel inside, Is just mindless
And everytime before I cry, i see this emptiness
I`m still burning in the fire
Who can help me now?
I`m still burning in the fire
Who can stop me now?
I walk alone in dreams of yesterday
like a prison without walls
Too many dark days in my past, There`s no light in my future
I want to find the new way of life, I want to live not die
Everything I see outside, Is just mindless
and everytime before I cry, I see this emptiness
