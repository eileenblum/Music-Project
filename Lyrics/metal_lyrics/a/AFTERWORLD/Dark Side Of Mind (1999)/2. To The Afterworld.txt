Your life is empty like a sky with no stars, I wanna
show you the new way
Your soul is black like a candle with no light, This my way is the only one
Open your eyes and give me your hand
I`m your last hope new time has come
Open your heart and give me your soul
I`m the master new time has come
Come with me forever, come with me to the Afterworld
Come with me forever, come with me to my Afterworld
Your mind is weak like a storm with now wind, i wanna show you the new way
Your soul is sick like a tree with no leaves, this my way is the only one
