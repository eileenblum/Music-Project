Are we alone in this world
Can we believe, we are the only ones
Is this the truth, control belongs to us
What if tomorrow brings something new?
We`re running to call out their name
Are we alone here? Are we alone here?
We are the only ones, we pray
Is this the day when we should start to think
Things that we do can somehow wrong
we can`t be selfish day after day
For sure tomorrow brings something new
We`re running to call out their name
Are we alone here? Are we alone here?
We are the only ones, we pray
We just keep thinking we are strong
Are we alone here? Are we alone here?
Can someone say where do we belong?
