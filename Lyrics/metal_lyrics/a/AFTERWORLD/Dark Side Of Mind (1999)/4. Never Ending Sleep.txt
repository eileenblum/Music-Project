Screamin` and running, fear in the night
Somewhere out there the shining light
Falling and crawling alone through the park
Oh I can`t see, it`s way too dark
I wanna live is this real or nightmare, Live goes by
I wanna live is this real or nightmare,Live goes by
Screamin` and running, fear in the night
Somewhere out there the shining light
praying and waiting alone in the park
Oh I can`t see, it`s way too dark
And my lonely soul in the still of night
Like a black candle burning with no light
And I know I`ll never see a painless morning
This is my never ending sleep
