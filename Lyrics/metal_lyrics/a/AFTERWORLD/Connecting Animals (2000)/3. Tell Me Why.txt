[Spoken Intro]

You feel overburdened under your problems 
and feel like trapped in your own imagination. 
Realising that there are always new problems to deal with you decide to give up.

No chance to stay, no path to leave the scene
You are a prisoner inside your mind
There's no more trust, the details blinding you
And all the lies mixing your head

Time after time there is some new threat to beat
No solid ground to feel under your feet

No halo shining above your head, all the mercy is passing you by
Give up now the final dreams are dead, can you tell me why?

Too many times the broken mind has found
the answers to the questions with no doubts
Imagination of the injured soul
now finally will see sinister clouds
