[Spoken Intro]

For a too long time someone has been treating you badly. 
You haven't have the strenght or willpower to make things change 
but you have promised to yourself that someday it will happen. 
The day is now.

So many times you've had your chance to be the only one for me
Crossing the line without the fear is always harder, you will see

All the things you have said, said to me
I'll remember them all

My word is law, I'll keep my promises, 
I'm taking you to the final journey, beating you now
You've had your chance, I'll keep my promises
I'm taking you to the final journey, beating you down

Maybe the fairytale is fading, no more lies I'm in too deep
Too many terrifying nights I've lost my mind without a sleep
