[Spoken Intro]

Some people seem to be untrustworthy by nature. 
Even if you don't care about the majority of the people, 
there are always certain people you need to trust. 
In the relationship between two people trust is maybe the most important.

Hard to live, you just don't know what to say
And again, you're feeling pain on your mind

Too much noise, for all the little things
And again, we are missing the main point

Lack of confidence killing me cos time is running out..

Yes, I want to see the truth behind your eyes
Now, I need to trust in you
Because, without the future all the feeling dies
Then, There's nothing left to do

Not enough, time to heal the wounds
And too much, pain to let it fly

Too much stress, and it's forceing you down
And again, we are missing the main point
