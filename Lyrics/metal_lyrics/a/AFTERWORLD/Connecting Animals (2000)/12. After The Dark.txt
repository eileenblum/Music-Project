[Spoken Intro]

Feeling insane. 
You don't know if you are dreaming or awake. 
You feel certain that something is coming for you but you just can't be sure. 
Last night's happenings seem so unrealistic and yet so true. 
You just can't believe in your better future... 
not even if it's always gonna be a new day after the dark.

You feel they are following you, you have to run you have to hide
The night feels just too freaky, hard to survive without a guide
"I am the peace of hangman, so winter won't be crying" 
You can not see them moving, they fool your mind, blind your eye

No more trying, no denying, let them win and take your life

You can be hard on the still of the night
After the dark comes the light!
Open your eyes and see the light
After the dark comes the light! 
Try to remember all the shining moments
New day is rising and you know
After the dark comes the light!

Next day you hope you 're dreaming, nightmares just teasing you
But it's the time to face it, there is just too much to do
"I am the peace of hangman, so winter won`t be crying"
It's written inside your head, they don't care what you need
