Allow me to break the ice
My name is Freeze
So learn it, learn it well
For it is the chilling sound of your doom

My blood is laced with cryogenic liquid
So I will not freeze when all of you are dead

Allow me to break the ice
My name is Freeze
So learn it, learn it well
For it is the chilling sound of your doom

I will freeze anything that gets in my way
I will bring a bitter winter that will forever stay
You'll never keep me locked down for long
I will turn this world into an iceberg

Allow me to break the ice
Allow me to break the ice
