[from Conan the Barbarian]
[featuring guest shredding by Rocky Gray and Jason Suecof]

You want to know what is best in life?
Well, let me tell you!

To crush your enemies
See them driven before you
And to hear the lamentation
Of their women

It is not the open steppe
Nor fleet of horse
Nor falcons at your wrist
And the wind in your hair

It doesn't matter if we have won again
Until we have finally crushed our enemies
Crushed our enemies
What is battle unless you win the war?
You want to know what is best in life?
Well here you go!

To crush your enemies
See them driven before you
And to hear the lamentation
Of their women

You want to know what is best in metal?
It's a guitar solo! Oayaha!

To crush your enemies
See them driven before you
And to hear the lamentation
Of their women
