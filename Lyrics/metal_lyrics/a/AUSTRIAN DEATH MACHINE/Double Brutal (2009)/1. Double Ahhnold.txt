Hi, you've reached Tim Lambesis, I'm not here right now, so leave me a message (beep)

-Hello there, how are you? I was just thinking about double brutal and realized, we need to get started writing songs now! Come meet me at the graphic arts classroom so we can practice!

-Wait, wait, wait! Hello? Hello? Who is this? You are not the real Arnold! I am the real Arnold!

-No you're not! You're my clone, running around, trying to be me!

-Of course I'm the real Arnold you idiot! I'm at Tim's couch standing right next to a Maria answer the phone... I know you! I ... Mr Funny Guy with your jokes and all that about the Gummy Bear of Candycornia and working out, and ..., well it's not funny anymore!

-That's what any good clone would say! Prove it! You sound like an old man!

-Of course I sound older than you, you idiot! I am 62 years old and totally angry! Ah, you sound like me when I was 18. I see Tim standing right over there, you know, that girly man, with his long hair and colorful tattoos, right? Ha-ha-ha... Exactly!

-There's only room for one! And I'm the real Arnold!

-Stop it! Neeeeeaaaah! I will crush you!

-You are nothing!

-I will burn your eyes out with my stogie you idiot!

-You flucking choir boy
