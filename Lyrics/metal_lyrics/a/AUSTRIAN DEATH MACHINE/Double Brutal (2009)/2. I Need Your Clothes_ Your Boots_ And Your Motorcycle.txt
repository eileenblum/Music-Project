[from Terminator 2]
[featuring guest shredding by Andrew Tapley]

I need your clothes, your boots, your motorcycle
I need your clothes, your boots, your motorcycle

I just traveled back in time
And i showed up empty handed
Why don't you just cut me a break
With those things that I demanded?

Don't you see how strong I am?
You best fulfill my request
Why would you try to stare me down
And put your cigar out on my chest?

I need your clothes, your boots, your motorcycle
I need your clothes, your boots, your motorcycle
I need your clothes...
I need your boots...
I need your mo, mo, mo, mo, mo... your motorcycle

Now you'll be the one who's burning
With your hands on that cook top
If this was a different movie
I might have played a cop
Your friends can't save you now
I wish just break their hands
I will ask one more time nicely
For you to meet my demands

Can't you see how strong I am?
You best fulfill my request
Why would you try to stare me down
And put your cigar out on my chest?

I need your clothes, your boots, your motorcycle
I need your clothes, your boots, your motorcycle
