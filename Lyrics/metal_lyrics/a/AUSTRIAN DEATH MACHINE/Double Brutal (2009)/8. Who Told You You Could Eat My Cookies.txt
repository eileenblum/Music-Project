IF YOU'RE GOING TO SOUND LIKE COOKIE MONSTER
THEN WE MIGHT AS WELL WRITE A SONG ABOUT COOKIES!

Who told you, you could eat my cookies?
Who told you, you could eat my cookies?
Put those cookies down now!
Put those cookies down now!
I don't want you in my house!
Put those cookies down now!
No! I said no!

Put those cookies down
Put those cookies down now
You don't have to tell me, that these cookies are out of this world
Put those cookies down (I told you)
Put those cookies down now
Put those cookies down (I told you)
Put those cookies down now

Who told you, you could eat my cookies?
Put those cookies down
Put those cookies down now!
