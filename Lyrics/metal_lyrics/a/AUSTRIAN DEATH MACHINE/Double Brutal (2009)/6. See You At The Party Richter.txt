[from Total Recall]
[featuring guest shredding by Chris Storey]

I'm holding your bloody stumps
As you fall to the ground
See you at the party Richter
Ohhh neaahh!

You tried to erase my memory
But I just keep fighting back
It's down to just you and me
Right before the big party

I hope to see you there
I hope to see you there

See you at the party Richter
See you there!

One person you won't find
is your friend Hauser
My name is Douglas Quaid
And judgment has been made

See you at the party Richter
I'll see you there!

See you at the party Richter
That's the plan
See you at the party Richter
Without your hands

I generally want to be a peaceful man
But when I am forced to defend my life
I will rip off your hands
I will rip off your hands

I will rip off your hands
I will rip off your hands

See you at the party Richter
That's the plan
See you at the party Richter
Without your hands
