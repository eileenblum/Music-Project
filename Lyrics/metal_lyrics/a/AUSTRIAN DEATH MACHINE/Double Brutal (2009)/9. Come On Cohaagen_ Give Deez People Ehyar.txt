[from Total Recall]
[featuring guest shredding by Buz McGrath]

Come on Cohaagen, you've got what you want

Give these people air
You've already captured me
Why take this any further
Everything is where you want it to be

Come on Cohaagen, you've got what you want

Could you be more evil
Than to kill them needlessly?
By the end of this movie
You will be begging on your knees
You will be begging... on your knees

Why would you kill them needlessly?

Come on Cohaagen, you've got what you want
Give these people, give these people air
Come on Cohaagen, give these people air
Come on Cohaagen, give these people air

In five minutes I will still remember
That Richter punched me in the face
But most of all I promise you
That I will kick your ace

Just give these people, just give these people air

Come on Cohaagen, you've got what you want
Give these people, give these people air
Come on Cohaagen, give these people air
Come on Cohaagen, give these people air
