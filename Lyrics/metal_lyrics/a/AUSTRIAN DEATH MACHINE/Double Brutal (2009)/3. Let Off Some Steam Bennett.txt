[from Commando]
[featuring guest shredding by Rusty Cooley]

Let off some steam Bennett
No use getting all worked up
Even though we go way back, your work is done
Let off some steam Bennett
I will be the one who shows you how it feels to be a dying man

Even though we go way back, this is not like old times
You were once a true and faithful friend
Trusted special agent, armed force elite commando

Let off some steam Bennett, your time is through
Let off some steam Bennett
I will be the one who shows you how it feels to be a dying man

Let off some steam
Let off some steam
Let off some steam Bennett
Let off some steam

Your protective body chain is pretty lame
Plus your moustache is totally nasty

Let off some steam
Let off some steam
Let off some steam Bennett
Let off some steam

Let off some steam Bennett while I impale your flabby chest
I just want to save my girl from your sweaty, fat man breasts
I left the armed forces to be a better dad
You left to make more money and be a douche bag
