[from Pumping Iron]
[featuring guest shredding by Andrew Tapley]

"Hahaha!
What the hell's the matter with you, you girly man?
Get your flabby butts off the couch,
It's time to pump your muscles, get your body into shape
This song is called: It's simple, if it jiggles its fat!"

Bench press and jumping jacks
All good ways to lose those fats
Go ahead and touch my chest
You won't feel no flabby breasts

It's simple, if it jiggles its fat

Get ready to get pumped
I don't want to hear excuses
Get up hear and sing along
and scream like dying mooses

It's simple, if it jiggles its fat
It's simple, if it jiggles
It's simple, if it jiggles its fat
