I found your sister dying and knew you needed help
So I trailed behind you to keep you safe
Until I know we can destroy the talisman
But you keep pushing me away

If you yield only
To a conqueror
Then prepare to be
Conquered

If you yield only
To a conqueror
Then prepare to be
Conquered
Conquered!!!

Stop holding yourself back because of a vow you took
I will win your heart after I win this fight

If you yield only
To a conqueror
Then prepare to be
Conquered

If you yield only
To a conqueror
Then prepare to be
Conquered
Conquered!!!

Prepare to be Conquered

[Arnold]
This a love song to my beautiful Sonya
I confess my love to you
Oh how I want to run my fingers through your glorious red mullet right now
Listen to these serenading guitars and admit what is in your heart

Red Sonja,
Destructive power is growing!
Red Sonja,
Just like your love to me!

Red Sonja,
Destructive power is growing!
Red Sonja,
Just like your love to me!
