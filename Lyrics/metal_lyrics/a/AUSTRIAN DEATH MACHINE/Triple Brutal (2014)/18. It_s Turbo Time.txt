It's Turbo Time, yeah,
It's Turbo Time
I've gotta move fast, because my life is on the line
So I don't wanna let my family down
And I'm tired of these people pushing me around
Why it is so hard to find a gift for my son?
When the stupid cops are always keeping me on the run.
I'm on the run!

It's Turbo Time and I'm Turbo Man,
So maybe this wasn't my number one plan
But I finally got what I need
Let's see if you can stop me when I hit top speed

[2x]
I'm tired of this,
I'm tired of this,
I'm tired of this,
I am Turbo Man!

This time of year is a rat race
I'm all burned out and tired of this place
If there's one thing I can say to my friends
This madness never stops, it never ends
(It never ends!)

[2x]
I'm tired of this,
I'm tired of this,
I'm tired of this,
I am Turbo Man!

It's time to get moving,
It's time to break free,
It's Turbo Time!
It's time to get moving,
It's time for top speed,
It's Turbo Time!

[Arnie:]
What the hell's the matter with you?
You totally forgot the guitar solo, you idiots!
Play it! Play it noooow!
