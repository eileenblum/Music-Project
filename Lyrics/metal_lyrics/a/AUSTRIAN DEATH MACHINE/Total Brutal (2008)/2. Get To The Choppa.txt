Get to the choppa!
Ah!
Now our escape begins
Get to the choppa
It's the only way out of here
Don't let them to stop you
Don't let them hold you back
This is our chance
We all must go dead or alive
Oh yeah! BRING IT!
Get to the choppa
It's the only way out
Get to the choppa
It's the only way out
Neaaahhh!
I've watched you kill my friends
But we've got more guns left
I'm gonna get backup
Then come shoot you in the face
Yeah, that's right
Shoot you in the face
I'm gonna get backup and shoot you in the face

[guitar solo]

Now escape begins
Get to the choppa
It's the only way out
Get to the choppa
It's the only way out of...
Here
NOW
Get to the choppa [x6]
So do you want more of a neeeeeaaahh!
Or a ah!
