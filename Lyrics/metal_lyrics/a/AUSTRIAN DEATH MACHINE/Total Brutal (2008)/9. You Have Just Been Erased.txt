[guitar solo]

The only way to give you a future
Is to erase your past
I will give you a new name
I will give you a brand new life
But we must cut all ties
To keep you alive
You have just been erased
You have just been erased

[guitar solo]

Anyone you knew
That is not dead already
Must be dead to you now
Must be dead to, you, now
You are alive
I will keep you that way
Trust me and you will not be found
Anyone who gets in my way will be blown up!

[break down]

You have just been erased
You have just been erased
You have just been erased
Anyone who gets in my way
You have just been erased
Anyone not dead already
You have just been erased
