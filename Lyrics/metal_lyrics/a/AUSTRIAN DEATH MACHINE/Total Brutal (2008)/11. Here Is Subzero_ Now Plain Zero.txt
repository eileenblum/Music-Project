What has come of society?
That you call this a game?
You join to watch the innocent killed
And this evil is given fame
Here is subzero, now plain zero
You call him a warrior
Someone to be glorified
But he's just a man in an ugly suit
Who squealed like a girl before he died
Here is subzero, now plain zero
Here is subzero, now plain zero

[break down]

Here is subzero, now plain zero
Here is subzero, now plain zero

[guitar solo]

Go!
Yeah!
I will defend myself
But must I kill these men to survive?
You keep sending your best
But not one of them is still alive
Here is subzero, now plain zero
Here is subzero, now plain zero
Yeow!

[guitar solo]

Here is subzero, now plain zero
Here is subzero, now plain zero
Here is subzero, now plain zero
