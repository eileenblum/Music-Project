You did not understand
Let me rephrase the question
Your comments are killing me
Why won't you stop, talking
Now from all this noise
I have a headache
I have a headache

[x2]
You think it might be..
Might be a tumor
It's not a tumor
It's not a tumor

Stop talking
Stop talking
It does not matter
Who my daddy is
I was asking you the question
So just listen... listen...listen...
Listen to me!
It's not a tumor
It's not a tumor
It's not a tumor [x2]

Yeow!
My daddy is not a fireman
He is probably big
But he's not a wrestler
Yeow!
He is definitely not a basketball coach
But all these question give me a headache
Now

[guitar solo]

It's not a tumor
0A
It's not a tumor
Yeow!
