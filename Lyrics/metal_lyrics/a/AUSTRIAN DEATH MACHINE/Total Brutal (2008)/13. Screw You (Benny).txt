Screw you
Screw you
Screw you Benny [x4]

I thought you were my friend
And a fugitive just like me
A taxi driving freak
With five kids to feed
Then you betrayed me
Did you do it for money?
Were you consumed with greed?
I thought you were a family man
With four kids to feed
Screw you
Screw you
Screw you Benny [x2]

[guitar solo]

You betrayed me
You betrayed me
Now you're out for blood
To make me your kill
I must put a stop to this
By impaling you with this drill
Screw you
Screw you
Screw you Benny [x3]

You betrayed me
You betrayed me
So screw you
Screw you Benny
