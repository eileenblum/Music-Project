[Dutch:]
Raaar!
If it bleeds, we can kill it
If it bleeds, we can kill it
You're one ugly mother and that's why I'm talking trash
I've seen you bleed and now I know that I can kick your... ah!
I'm going to take you down
I'm going to take you down

[Predator::]
You are the hunted, you run in fear
Must I remind you that I've killed your friends
Must I remind you that your life is at it's end

[Dutch:]
If it bleeds, we can kill it
If it bleeds, we can kill it
If it bleeds, we can kill it
If it bleeds, we can kill it

[break down]

I'm going to take you down
I'm going to take you down
I've seen you bleed and that makes you just like me
The only difference between us is
You're the one who's going to die

[guitar solo]

[Predator::]
This is my planet now
I'm hear to hunt your kind
This is a game to me
You'll all be dead in time
Must I remind you that I've killed your friends
Must I remind you that your life is at it's end

[Dutch:]
I once was the hunted, but now your time is through
The tides have turned, and now I'm hunting you
If it bleeds, we can kill it
If it bleeds, we can kill it
If it bleeds, we can kill it
If it bleeds, we can kill it
