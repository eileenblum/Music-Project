I can't explain why my whole world is feeling so far away.
My reflection, it seems so fake, when will the night seperate this day?

I can't ignore the place I live. 
It feels so wrong.
They try to deceive us.
Wake up from this lucid dream.

I close my eyes but can't escape this feeling I have inside.
I walk alone dissecting life, wake up to discover a brand new lie.

I can't ignore the place I live. 
It feels so wrong, 
why can't I win?
We must be strong, 
it tries to deceive us.
Wake up from this lucid dream.

We can't ignore the truth inside.
Staring back at me for a reason, 
why do lies continue to come my way?
Force-fed the answers to trust in, 
forget that believe in another life.

I can't ignore the place I live. 
It feels so wrong, 
why can't I win?
We must be strong, 
it tries to deceive us.
Wake up from this lucid dream.

I can't ignore the place I live. 
It feels so wrong, 
why can't I win?
We must be strong, 
it tries to deceive us.
Wake up from this lucid dream.
