I'm searching deeper inside, 
inside myself until I, 
can find a place to rest my head.
If I surround myself with your negative self-respect, 
I'll never get the chance to live.

Time for change, 
deceptions killing me, 
break the chains, 
my redemption.

Take this life create another I choose to be what I admire, 
this skin is growing old, is growing old. 
Lack of pride and self destruction I push aside and feed production, 
this truth that will be told, that will be told.

I'm breaking through this weakness that lies behind my secret, to find the
truth inside my head.
If I divide myself from this fear that's holding me down, I'd finally get the
chance to live.

Time for change, 
deceptions killing me, 
break the chains, 
my redemption.

Take this life create another I choose to be what I admire, 
this skin is growing old, is growing old. 
Lack of pride and self destruction I push aside and feed production, 
this truth that will be told, that will be told.

Take this life you lead far away from me I will not be controlled.

Take this life create another I choose to be what I admire, 
this skin is growing old, is growing old. 
Lack of pride and self destruction I push aside and feed production, 
this truth that will be told, that will be told.

Choose your fate, reach for salvation.
Choose your fate, reach for salvation.
My redemption!
