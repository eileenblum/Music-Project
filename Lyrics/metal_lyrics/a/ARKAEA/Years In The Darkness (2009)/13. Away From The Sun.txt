I've fallen away from the sun, 
so far away from everyone.

Why must we fight to all survive?
Why must we cry to feel alive?

I've fallen away from the world, 
so far away I cant be cured.

Why must we fight to all survive?
Why must we cry to feel alive?
Why must we fight to all survive?
Why must we cry to feel alive?
