Blood runs down my face as I hold back the tears, 
tell me what the fuck am I doing here. 
Denial sets in my mind as you choke.

Face down in the ashes of all my own fears, 
felt enough pain for a thousand years, 
unable to set myself free to save you.

Lost inside this world without you,
lost in this world,
lost inside this world without you.

As I'm calling out your name you slowly disappear.
It's never quite the same beneath the shades of grey.

Burning flesh awakens me now from this dream, 
what I have dread became reality, 
defiled and broke I begin to recall.

Trapped beneath the wreckage encaged in the steel, 
with your only breath you reach out to me, 
your eyes have given me more than you know.

Lost inside this world without you,
lost in this world,
lost inside this world without you.

As I'm calling out your name you slowly disappear.
It's never quite the same beneath the shades of grey.

I never thought, 
this world could tear us both apart.
And now my heart's beneath the ground where you now lay.

I never knew you, 
and all we needed was time.
I never knew you.

I never thought, 
this world could tear us both apart.
And now my heart's beneath the ground where you now lay.

As I'm calling out your name you slowly disappear.
It's never quite the same beneath the shades of grey.

Beneath the shades of grey. [x4]
