As we speak another life is laid to waste, 
another victim of disgrace, 
is taken by the human race.

We are the ones holding the gun.
We are lost helping the cause. 

If we stand alone,
then our world is lost.
If we join as one, 
we can't be stopped.
We can't be stopped.
The world as

One man can't decide the fate of our demise, 
decide who lives and who will die, 
decide the fate of all mankind.

We are the ones holding the gun.
We are lost helping the cause. 

If we stand alone,
then our world is lost.
If we join as one, 
we can't be stopped.

Take your last breath as you look to the sky, 
life as we know it will crumble now say goodbye.
Say goodbye.

Take your last breath as you look to the sky, 
life as we know it will crumble now say goodbye.
If our ways don't change this world can't prevail, 
man must become one together we will not fail.

If we stand alone,
then our world is lost.
If we join as one, 
we can't be stopped.

If we stand alone (if we stand alone),
then our world is lost (then our world is lost).
If we join as one (if we join as one), 
we can't be stopped.
We can't be stopped.
The world as one.
