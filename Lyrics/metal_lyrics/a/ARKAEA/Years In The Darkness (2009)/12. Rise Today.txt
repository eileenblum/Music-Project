Another promise taken from under me, 
this broken trust decays what we used to be.
Why defend lies when you're clearly the only one to blame?

I'm not this way.
Don't tell me who I have to be.
I can't be changed.
Take back what life I used to lead.

Now I see it's gone too far, 
a traitor from the start.
Take your lies and hold them in your heart.

I've got something to say, 
I will rise today, 
now it's time to take this life back.
I've got something to prove, 
I will cut the noose, 
now it's time to take this life back.

Another reason thrown in my face again, 
you're breaking every bond that we used to have.
Why trust in lies and pretend you're something that you're not?

I'm not this way.
Don't tell me who I have to be.
I can't be changed.
Take back what life I used to lead.

Now I see it's gone too far, 
a traitor from the start.
Take your lies and hold them in your heart.

I've got something to say, 
I will rise today, 
now it's time to take this life back.
I've got something to prove, 
I will cut the noose, 
now it's time to take this life back.

I will break away. [x4]

You will never touch me.
You will never change me.
You will never stop me.
You will never kill me.

Now I see it's gone too far, 
a traitor from the start.
Take your lies and hold them in your heart.

I've got something to say, 
I will rise today, 
now it's time to take this life back.
I've got something to prove, 
I will cut the noose, 
now it's time to take this life back.

I've got something to say, 
I will rise today, 
now it's time to take this life back.
I've got something to prove, 
I will cut the noose, 
now it's time to take this life back.

Take this life back.
You're all dead to me.
