A fallen angel wraps her wings around you,
you turn your back and ignore.
When karma returns to shatter your surroundings,
maybe you'll feel some remorse.

The silence and years and years in the darkness, 
only deter you from the truth.
Vengeance dissolves in your weakness,
I'm here to show that you can choose.

Another victim cries upon your shoulder, 
you laugh and turn them away.
The only reason I hold my tongue around you, 
is that you'll regret this day.

The silence and years and years in the darkness, 
only deter you from the truth.
Vengeance dissolves in your weakness,
I'm here to show that you can choose.

The silence and years and years in the darkness, 
only for a chance at a new life.
Vengeance dissolves in your weakness,
only for a chance at another life.

Drown in regret take the fall, 
burn the pictures engulf them all.
This life will carry on without you, 
your path is chosen now its time to lose.

The silence and years and years in the darkness, 
only deter you from the truth.
Vengeance dissolves in your weakness,
I'm here to show that you can choose.

The silence and years and years in the darkness, 
only for a chance at a new life.
Vengeance dissolves in your weakness,
only for a chance at another life.
