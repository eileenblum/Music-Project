Born into a world of hatred and disease, 
a new life create to breed for the machine.
Sacrifice yourself to gratify the urge, 
realize we're just a number here to serve.

I'm reaching deeper, to find another way, 
a search for purpose, for existence.

I see your eyes staring out at me, 
I see your eyes lifeless just like me.

Visualize our future coming to an end, 
paralyzed by what I've chosen to defend.
Cut the ties resent the life I've come to lead, 
now it's time to break the silence over me.

I'm reaching deeper, to find another way, 
a search for purpose, for existence.

I see your eyes staring out at me, 
I see your eyes lifeless just like me.

Find truth inside you.
Take control of this hate burning inside.
Break the silence.

I see your eyes staring out at me, 
I see your eyes lifeless just like me.

I see your eyes staring out at me, 
I see your eyes lifeless just like me.

I break the silence, 
realize what I've become.
I bleed forever regretting what I've done.

I break the silence, 
realize what I've become.
I bleed forever regretting what I've done.

I see your eyes staring out at me, 
I see your eyes lifeless just like me.
