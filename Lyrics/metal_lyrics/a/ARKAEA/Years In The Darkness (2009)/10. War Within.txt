Never thought it'd be this way, 
all your intentions were here to stay.
Never thought it'd end like this, 
my desolation is far from bliss.

So far away but I can still remember everything we had.
If I could change this life I'd give it all up just to have this back.

Never waste the time we have, 
we must remember where we belong.
Never turn your back on this, 
our absolution must now exist.

So far away but I can still remember everything we had.
If I could change this life I'd give it all up just to have this back.
Just to have this back.

Death will find us all (death will find us all), 
it doesn't matter who you are (no matter who you are).
And when the time has come (when your time has come), 
you'll remember what you've lost (remember what you've lost).

We must live and learn.
Take back this war within me, 
take back this world around me.

Death will find us all (death will find us all), 
it doesn't matter who you are (no matter who you are).
And when the time has come (when your time has come), 
you'll remember what you've lost (remember what you've lost).

So far away but I can still remember everything we had.
If I could change this life I'd give it all up just to have this back.

So far away, so far away but I can still remember everything we had.
So far away, so far away but I can still remember everything we had.
