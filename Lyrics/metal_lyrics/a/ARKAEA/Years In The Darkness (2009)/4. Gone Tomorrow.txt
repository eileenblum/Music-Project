If only I could turn back time
Iâd save you from this life that I call my own
Itâs forcing me to lose my control

I wanted you to know we wonât see tomorrow
By the time you read this Iâll be gone
To a place I know, far away from here
Live your life like I was never there

And if the answers are so clear
Why do I live in fear
Of the truth inside me
Forcing down my every weakness

I wanted you to know we wonât see tomorrow
By the time you read this Iâll be gone
To a place I know, far away from here
Live your life like I was neverâ¦
Like I was never there

Lies have torn our worlds so far apart
I'm drifting further from the start
Our lives will never be the same

I wanted you to know we wonât see tomorrow
I wanted you to know we wonât see tomorrow
By the time you read this Iâll be gone
To a place I know, far away from here
Live your life like I was never there

I never wanted us to fall apart and end this way
But the world we live in tears apart the only thing we have

I wanted you to know we wonât see tomorrow
(The only thing we have)
By the time you read this Iâll be gone
To a place I know, far away from here
(The only thing we have)
Live your life like I was never there
