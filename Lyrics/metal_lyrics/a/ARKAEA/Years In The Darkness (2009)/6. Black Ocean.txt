Take control of all your fear, 
don't let somebody else decide the way you should live your own life.
Sometimes we can be fooled, 
sometimes we can be lured into a choice that we will all regret.
That we regret.

We'll never be the same again, 
we're lost among our fear.
When there is nothing left to say,
we'll die another day.

Break away from all the hate, 
I won't become your slave, 
find someone else to dig you your own grave.
There's never time to waste,
there's always time to make a choice that we all know we'll not regret.
That we regret.

We'll never be the same again, 
we're lost among our fear.
When there is nothing left to say,
we'll die another day.

We can't be confined inside a world like this.
We can't justify living our lives like this.
See this world face our demise.
See this world fall in our time.

We'll never be the same again, 
we're lost among our fear.
When there is nothing left to say,
we'll die another day.

We'll never be the same again, 
we're lost among our fear.
When there is nothing left to say,
we'll die another day.
