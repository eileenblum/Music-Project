Dispose of the ashes that were left behind.
Awaken to a world where choice is to decide.
I'm falling through the ground where feeble minded lay.
Deception of the mind confused by what they say.

I will not revise (will not revise), 
I will not confine (will not confine), 
I am not the lie (am not the lie).
Rise above and take them with us.

Implant the new virus in those who will infect.
Denial shining through it's this you must neglect.
Divide from all the rest and choose what life to lead.
A damaged life reborn now its time to see.

I will not revise (will not revise), 
I will not confine (will not confine), 
I am not the lie (am not the lie).
Rise above and take them with us.

As the world falls down you will come with us.
We must all learn how to wake up and change this now.
As the world falls down you will come with us.
We must all learn how to wake up and change this now.

Entrust the hourglass and see what lies ahead.
We breed for the machine and serve until we're dead.
Apologize for what lives that have been taken.
Another paradox soon we will awaken.

I will not revise (will not revise), 
I will not confine (will not confine), 
I am not the lie (am not the lie).
Rise above and take them with us.

As the world falls down you will come with us.
We must all learn how to wake up and change this now.
As the world falls down you will come with us.
We must all learn how to wake up and change this now.

As the world falls down you will come with us.
We must all learn how to wake up and change this now.
As the world falls down you will come with us.
We must all learn how to wake up and change this now.
