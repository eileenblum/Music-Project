HELL!!!!

Foul winds, injecting pain â On blood stained, horizons of death!
Stabbing, the burning sky, blankets of chaos!
Empty, into the dark, - spreading throughout chaos!
In hell, boiling within. The black hole oracle, waiting for the end!!

Planets align, mass destruction, universal, sucked inside â collapsing to hell!

Foul winds, injecting pain â On blood stained, horizons of death!
Stabbing, the burning sky, blankets of chaos!
Empty, into the dark, - spreading throughout chaos!
In hell, boiling within. The black hole oracle, waiting for the end!!

All creation, erupts in flame, galaxies ruined, just punishment-
collapsing to hell!

Torn, your bodies feel the anticipation, cities crumbling and drowned in lava! The stars are falling and gravity deludes!
This canât come too soon, for these humans are wreckage and they reap but loss. Universal collapse, metaphysical apoacalypse!
