Stuggling, sinking, entwined in the muck
Through time and experience, my faith is now stuck
My once sacred dream, ripped apart at the seam
Will trust ever reign or remain yet a stainâ¦â¦

On carpets of innocence, and revolting dissonance,
On walls of hollow sound, and infertile distant ground.

This wretched existence, a species untrueâ¦â¦a species untrue!
My learned resistence, unnatural to youâ¦..unnatural to you!

WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your theories, your pride, disclose, nothing to hideâ¦
For you there is no one sacred, no one kept insideâ¦.

Cocophony of chaos, awaiting the surprise, weâve heard it all before,
We know whats instore, your occasional yearning, your desire will be churning,
Caught in the cycle of distrust lies and ruin!..
There is only one lawâ¦.one pride, and one truth,
An empty boundless pit of nothingness!
A boundless pit of nothingâ¦â¦

NESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
On carpets of innocence, and revolting dissonance,
On walls of hollow sound, and infertal distant ground.

WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your theories, your pride, disclose, nothing to hideâ¦
For you there is no one sacred, no one kept insideâ¦.
