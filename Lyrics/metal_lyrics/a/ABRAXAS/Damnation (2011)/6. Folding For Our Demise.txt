Grrrroooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!

A pawn for the king, a writhing inkling. Beyond the shroud,
Lies the wolves amongst the sheep (Wolves amongst sheep!!)
Hearding all the fools, to the whims, of the self
We go about, our day, as these cards are forced into play

Folding for our demise! Heroes and idols in disguise
Ritualistic plundering, Mass enslavement it will bring

A pawn for the king, a writhing inkling. Beyond the shroud,
Lies the wolves amongst the sheep (Wolves amongst sheep!!)
Hearding all the fools, to the whims, of the self
We go about, our day, as these cards are fucking forced to play

Folding for our demise! Heroes and idols in disguise,
Ritualistic plundering, Mass enslavement it will bring,
From death camp to death camp all rebels will perish in the thundering flames!!!
(Flames!, Flames!, Flames! Flames!)

FLAMES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Disgusted by your unbelief, in human deceit
The foulness of betrayal, this enslavement you will meet

They burn their own cities, and place the blame â strategically
The pieces are in place, the death toll rises â increasingly
Glued to the news, false idols, and the empty promises
Your un-ability to accept will be your downfall
These humans are filth, malicious, and evil!!!!!!!!!

[Solo]

Glued to the news, false idols, and the empty promises
Your un-ability to accept will be your downfall

They burn their own cities, and place the blame â strategically
The pieces are in place, the death toll rises â increasingly

Oooooooww, Political warfare, a brainwashing tactic
Forced to forget the past, and unlearn, what was taught
Centuries of cult-ivating, these suppressed, children
Who accept these rules without â thought.

Disgusted by your unbelief, in human deceit
The foulness of betrayal, this enslavement you will meet
The masters of logic, and selfish â manipulation
They govern your existence, and this imminent â dev-a-station!!!
