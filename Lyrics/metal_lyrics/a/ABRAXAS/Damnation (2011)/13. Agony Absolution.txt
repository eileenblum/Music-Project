Meditational lust, for beliefs, in-car-nation
Manifest desire, and this, limitless fire
Disgust for the flesh, and living, natures plan
Shred the bloodline with, a burning, painfilled brand

Upon my skin I force my will!
Accept this truth â I want to kill! (kill!)
You bound this hate within this cage (cage, cage, cage)
Upon this flesh I forge my â Rage!!!!!!!!!

Your agony!!!â¦â¦my absolution!!!

Imprisoned for acting on impulse, This animalistic shell, I repulse
My skin is riveted, with pain, These acts of violence, considered unsane
It's you who choose to procreate, Like roaches you flourish, in filth
No satisfaction here, just hate, This will never end, I will not bend!!!

I take this pain to my grave, This pathetic life â I choose â not to save
Endless dreams of inflicted torture, A simple escape, a pleasant suture
