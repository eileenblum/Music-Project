[originally by Sepultura]To The Wall-- Claims The Soldier 
My Last Steps March To The Death 
Last Wills! Hell! This Is Idiotism 
Fuck Off To Me, Fuck Off To All Of You 

To The Death-- I Raise My Head 
My Last Moments--it's My Existing Countdown 
A Cry For Mercy Trapped In My Throat 
But Even In Hell There's A Place For Cowards 

The Burning Sun Over My Head 
The Troop Is Comin'- Compassion I Dismiss 
Sentence Of Death Pounding On My Back 
There's No Hiding When You're Thrown 
Against The Wall 

To Paradise, The Priest Is Saying . . . 
Blessing My Death 
He's Standing In Front Of Me . . . 
His Merciful Sight Sickens Me 
He Says That Soon I'll Have My Judgement . . . 
I'll Kneel Down In Front Of The Lord 

And He Asks Me To Regret My Sins. . . 
But It's Too Late 
Growling Words From The Bible. . . 
Raising My Agony Oh God!. . . 
How I'd Like To Have My Hands Untied 

The Wall I'm Facing Now 
Seeing My Life Going Through My Eyes 
Feeling Death Behind My Back 
An Acrid Taste Of Defeat Tormenting My Last Years 
And When I Feel My Body Being. . . 
Punched. . . Smashed 
There's No Pain . . . Just Silence 
My Last Breath Echoing . . . Spreading Through The Air 
My Body In Pieces. . . A Stream Of Blood . . . 

Bloody Drops Whipping The Wall 
The Silent Wall That Has Understood My Silence 
The Silence That Was A Prisoner Of My Soul 
Is My Soul That Now Is The Ruler Of The World 

To The Wall
