Ominous whirlwind, of charred skeletal remains.
To this earth we burn whole, with smothered stains.
Apathetic and uncaring, at one with the earth.
Animalistic knowing, through blood we return!

Your flesh shall be power, your heart shall go sour!
Burn this curse we hold dear, blackened sight becomes clear.
Apathetic and uncaring, at one with the earth.
Animalistic knowing, through blood we return!

Through Blood!! â We Return! [3x]
Through Blood!!

Ominous whirlwind, of charred skeletal remains.
To this earth we burn whole, with smothered stains.
Apathetic and uncaring, at one with the earth.
Animalistic knowing, through blood we return!

Through Blood!! â We Return! [3x]
Through Blood!!

A blank cold stare, a glaze of empty despair.
Electric pulses spark, and ensue hatred within the dark.
Out from the tips of my bones - Explosive, powerful drones!

Oblique â Passion! - Desire! Pessimistic stab of blood fire!
Oblique â Passion! - Desire! Pulse of, never-ending FIRE!!

Oblique â Passion! - Desire! Pulse of, never-ending FIRE!!

Ominous whirlwind, of charred skeletal remains.
To this earth we burn whole, with smothered stains.
Apathetic and uncaring, at one with the earth.
Animalistic knowing, through blood we return!

Betrayal of faith and all that one learns.
To enter the unknown and achieve what one yearns.
Power above all!
