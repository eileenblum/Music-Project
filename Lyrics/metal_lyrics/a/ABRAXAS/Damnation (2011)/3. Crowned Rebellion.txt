Sharp seething pain! Blackness surrounds. Sunset! Bloodset! The red sky creeps down.
No limit to the abhorrence. There are no bounds. Unending hatred â Rebellion is crowned!

Consume the blood, of fallen fragile life. Sever the cord, with a serrated knife.
Into the earth , or into the air â with burning pain, into the void I stare.

Thorned determination â No dream reigns more supreme!

Sharp seething pain! Blackness surrounds. Sunset! Bloodset! The red sky creeps down.
No limit to the abhorrence. There are no bounds. Unending hatred â Rebellion is crowned!

Consume the blood, of fallen fragile life. Sever the cord, with a serrated knife.
Into the earth , or into the air â with burning pain, into the void I stare.

The stench of slow rotting burns the eyes!
Such is life â This slow death â Everyone decays and Dies!!
