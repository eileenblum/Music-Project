YyeeeeeaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAA

Swirling chaos, and pounding vio-lence
Vibrations piercing, internally â si-lenced!

Upheaval, churning, your voice I am abhorring
Your arrogant pride, tempting my, hatred inside
If only you knew, all the blood that Iâve ripped through
Your pompous ways have made you â En-slaved!
You test me, and probe me, my energy, en-sues
To demolish your soul, and, devour you, whole!!!

E-ternally , E-rased!! / Eternally Erased!!

Time, and time again, asked for proof, yet again.
The demons now rise, from past times that Iâve despised! (despised!!)

Upheaval, churning, your voice I am abhorring
Your arrogant pride, tempting my, hatred inside
If only you knew, all the blood that Iâve ripped through
Your pompous ways have made you â En-slaved!

E-ternally , E-rased!! / Eternally Erased!!

Grrrroooooooooooooo!!!!!

The time has come, to take back what isâ¦..Mine!!!!!!! [3x]

I abhor you for this pain, this continual rainâ¦.of blood upon my â¦.soul!!!
I hate you for this pain, this darkness makes meâ¦..
Stronger in age, in power and in rage!
Yet this pain is increased, with each, spirit, deceased
Continual hell, of self proof and dispell
Iâll break your face! Your disgrace, I willâ¦..Taste!!!

The time has come, to take back what isâ¦..Mine!!!!!!! [3x]
