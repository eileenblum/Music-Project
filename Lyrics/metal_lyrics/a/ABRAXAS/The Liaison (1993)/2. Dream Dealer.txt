Deep inside your wounded mind
deep inside you brain
rules a force you've never seen
It's drivin' you insane

Dream Dealer

Make you see the future
Make you touch the past
Make you sleep in silence
Make you running fast

Dream Dealer

Deep in the night when all your senses are down
I'm gonna crawl in you mind, Make your body turn around
I am your pain or be the healer of soul
I am your master of dreams, A king in your mind

You feel me come to make your inner dreams come true
A whispering voice that fills your head

Dream Dealer
