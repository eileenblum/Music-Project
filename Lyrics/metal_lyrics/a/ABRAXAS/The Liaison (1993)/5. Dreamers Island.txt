Forgotten dreams lost inside
Hide your tears from others pride
Feelings so cold habits grow old
Lost my mind in emptiness
Dispersing questions not answered at all
hunted by reality

Faced with ordinary life eye to eye with the truth
Boring jobs build a senseless world
Tell me what can I do?

Let these days pass by Don't believe a lie!
Escape from reality

Welcome to dreamers island
leave all your sorrows leave all your troubles behind
Travel to dreamers island start a new life!
Better time will begin

My mind's full of Gods degrees
Will it be my destination?
Preachers word a better life will lead to dependence

Let these days pass by Don't believe a lie!
Escape from reality

Welcome to dreamers island
leave all your sorrows leave all your troubles behind
Travel to dreamers island start a new life!
Better time will begin

Let these days pass by Don't believe a lie!
Escape from reality

Welcome to dreamers island
leave all your sorrows leave all your troubles behind
Travel to dreamers island start a new life!
Better time will begin
[Repeat till end]
