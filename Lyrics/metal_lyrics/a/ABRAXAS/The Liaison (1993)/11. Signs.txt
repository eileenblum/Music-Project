[Bonus Track]

Six o'clock radio tells the morning news
Same old stories same old lies again
TV preachers selling member cards
Heaven's for sale ten dollars cash

There's a new religion "Money" is the name for
(Their) bible called "credit card"
In this temples of gold money games are played
and anytime the rich will win

Listen to the signs of time
Don't obey those master of lies
Listen to the signs of time
Find your way to feel all right

Politician leaders give us promises
Idle words later on they can't remind
Doin' sales and deals behind a mask of truth
Bending the law in their own way

There's a new religion "Money" is the name for
(Their) bible called "credit card"
In this temples of gold money games are played
and anytime the rich will win

Listen to the signs of time
Don't obey those master of lies
Listen to the signs of time
Find your way to feel all right

There's a new religion "Money" is the name for
(Their) bible called "Credit card"
In this temples of gold money games are played
and everybody knows the rules

Listen to the signs of time
Don't obey those master of lies
Listen to the signs of time
Find your way to feel all right
