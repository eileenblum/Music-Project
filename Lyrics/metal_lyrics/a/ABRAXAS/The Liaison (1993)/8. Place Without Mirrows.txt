The day is fadin' away and the night comes with strength
Shadows has conquered the town now it's time to begin

Shadows and darkness protecting me
Hidin' my face in the twilight
If there's a God where should he be?
Give me the right to see my face no more!

Where is the place without mirrors and pain?
Take me inside just leave me be
Where is the place without images?
Time cannot heal all the wounds
Time cannot help to forget

Headaches are bursting my head
Now I can't stop to do
Mirrors cause pain every second in life when we meet

Shadows and darkness protecting me
Hidin' my face in the twilight
If there's a God where should he be?
Give me the right to see my face no more!

Where is the place without mirrors and pain?
Take me inside just leave me be
Where is the place without images?
Time cannot heal all the wounds
Time cannot help to forget
