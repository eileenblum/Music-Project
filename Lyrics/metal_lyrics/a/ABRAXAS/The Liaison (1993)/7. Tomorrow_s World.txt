Black was the night the all covered sky sending rain and fire
2066 a different world as we know
Two old men lightened up by a candles flame
A glance from their eyes showing no future at all

They tell a story which I can't believe
Listen to them and hear

Visions of tomorrow's world
See that mankind didn't learn
What we've built in thousand years
to pieces it is blown!

Listening to them a wounded soldier came along
Tired and hungry he is sitting down
A broken hero damned by his own rules
He's turning in circles there's no way out

Tears fallin' down from his eyes to the ground
as he remembered the

Visions of tomorrow's world
See that mankind didn't learn
What we've built in thousand years
to pieces it is blown!

Clear is the day sunshine is falling in my room
As I woke up no signs at all
Scared by a dream I know this can't go on and on
People wake up and beware

Black was the night the all covered sky sending rain and fire
2066 a different world as we know
Two old men lightened up by a candles flame
A glance from their eyes showing no future at all

There's only one way that we have to go open
your eyes for the

Visions of tomorrow's world without crime and
without hurt
What we've built in thousand years
lasts eternally!
