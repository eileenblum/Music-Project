Outside the rain is falling
The moon stands pale and cold
Somewhere the clock strikes midnight
six ours left to go
Justice says I'm guilty but is this really true?
Governor shows no mercy now the chair waits for me

I got a dream a long time ago
Visions of my life
Terrible deeds I saw in that night
violence crime and lies!

There are signs in the sky
tomorrow the day I must die
Lord stand by me on my last way!
(The) circle is closed and the visions turned to truth
Now I'm on my way to the gates of Eden

Sometimes I feel anger about my own life
I wouldn't see the danger in those days
Steps outside the celldoor coming close to me
Sunbeams of the rising dawn makes me fear!

I got a dream a long time ago
Visions of my life
Terrible deeds I saw in that night
violence crime and lies!

Cold sweat is flowing slowly down on my back
The sands of times are running there's no turning back
The priest reads the last writes guardian stands beside
My blood runs faster now it's time to die!

Now I'm leavin' up to another world
Maybe a better place to live maybe to sleep

Tears rollin' down on my cheeks as my life drifts before me
I'm afraid of the coming but no one can hear my silent cries

Goodbye Mama goodbye my love
Goodbye to the rest of all
The time is right for the last farewell
Stop from cryin' hide your tears
I'm not worth for all those fears
Send me a smile before I walk away

My heart is drummin' as they lead me to the chair
The smilin' face of death - I see everywhere
Hangman comes closer
Last cigarette I can smoke
Than he will take the switch to turn my life off

I got a dream a long time ago
Visions of my life
Terrible deeds I saw in that night
violence crime and lies!

There's a sign in the sky now it's the hour to die
Lord stand by me on my last way!
(The) circle is closed and the visions turned to truth
Ready to pass the gates of Eden
