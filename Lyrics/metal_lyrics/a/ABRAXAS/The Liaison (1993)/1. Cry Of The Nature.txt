Cracked by the storm
the waves and the sea
the ship sinks down on the ground
Filled up with oil that streams to the sea
turning the blue into black

When do we learn to prevent our faults?
When do we turn back to life?
This is the world where we only can live!
There will be no second chance!

The cry of the nature is seldom be heard
a slap in it's face all we gave
The air is polluted we can't breath at all
The dice will be cast here at last

We poison our rivers we dirten the air
Nobody cares about it all
Turning our heads everyday everytime
it's only a matter of time

Now it is time to prevent our mistakes
Now it is time to turn back!
This world's the only place where we can live
there will be no second chance!

The cry of the nature is seldom be heard
a slap in it's face all we gave
The air is polluted we can't breath at all
The dice will be cast here at last

Now it is time to prevent our mistakes
Now it is time to turn back!
This world's the only place where we can live
There will be no second chance!

The cry of the nature is seldom be heard
a slap in it's face all we gave
The sense of our times are running away
Give us a chance - so just give us a chance
give us a chance to survive
