Heavenly master creator of fire wind and earth
Take me in show me a promised land

And when I die has my life been glorious?
Death makes no sense at all

One world of euphoria
is this the place I wanna live in?
Madness has taken control
One world of euphoria
once been strong forever strong
War leaves peace behind!?
Everlasting lie!

Sun and ice freezing burning getting tired
Endless nights without knowing what's coming next

And when I die has my life been glorious?
Death makes no sense at all

One world of euphoria
is this the place I wanna live in?
Madness has taken control
One world of euphoria
once been strong forever strong
War leaves peace behind!?
Everlasting lie!

Sun breaks through the morning dawn
the great calm before the storm
I feel fear so much fear!
A shot wakes up the early day
there is nothin' left to say
And I feel fear deadly fear!

World is loosing
All are confused and the children are dying everyday
For those everlasting lies

Sun breaks through the morning dawn
the great calm before the storm
I feel fear deadly fear!
A shot wakes up the early day
There is nothing left to say
I feel fear deadly fear!

World is loosing
All confused in endless fear
Children dying each denyin'
Rest in peace
Times are movin' but not changin' day by day
News are telling no one's listening what they say

Victory music radio plays all night long
Signs of sadness never has been heard

And when I die has my life been glorious?
Death makes no sense at all

One world of euphoria
is this the place I wanna live in?
Madness has taken control
One world of euphoria
once been strong forever strong
War leaves peace behind!?
Everlasting lie!
