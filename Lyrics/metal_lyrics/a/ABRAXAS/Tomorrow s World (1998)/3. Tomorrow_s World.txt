[Music &amp; Lyrics: Klauke]

[Verse 1:]
Black was the night the all covered sky sending rain and fire
2066 a different world as we know
Two old men lightened up by a candles flame
A glance from their eyes showing no future at all

[Bridge 1:]
They tell a story which I can't believe
Listen to them and hear

[Refrain:]
Visions of tomorrow's world
See that mankind didn't learn
What we've built in thousand years
to pieces it is blown!

[Verse 2:]
Listening to them a wounded soldier came along
Tired and hungry he is sitting down
A broken hero damned by his own rules
He's turning in circles there's no way out

[Bridge 2:]
Tears fallin' down from his eyes to the ground
as he remembered the

[Refrain:]
Visions of tomorrow's world
See that mankind didn't learn
What we've built in thousand years
to pieces it is blown!

[Bridge 3:]
Clear is the day sunshine is falling in my room
As I woke up no signs at all
Scared by a dream I know this can't go on and on
People wake up and beware

[Verse 3:]
Black was the night the all covered sky sending rain and fire
2066 a different world as we know
Two old men lightened up by a candles flame
A glance from their eyes showing no future at all

[Bridge 4:]
There's only one way that we have to go open
your eyes for the

[Refrain:]
Visions of tomorrow's world without crime and
without hurt
What we've built in thousand years
lasts eternally!
