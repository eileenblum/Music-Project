[Music &amp; Lyrics: MÃ¼ller]

Forgotten dreams lost inside
Hide your tears from others pride
Feelings so cold habits grow old
Lost my mind in emptiness
Dispersing questions not answered at all
hunted by reality

[Verse 1:]
Faced with ordinary life eye to eye with the truth
Boring jobs build a senseless world
Tell me what can I do?

[Bridge 1:]
Let these days pass by Don't believe a lie!
Escape from reality

[Refrain:]
Welcome to dreamers island
leave all your sorrows leave all your troubles behind
Travel to dreamers island start a new life!
Better time will begin

[Verse 2:]
My mind's full of Gods degrees
Will it be my destination?
Preachers word a better life will lead to dependence

[Bridge 1:]
Let these days pass by Don't believe a lie!
Escape from reality

[Refrain:]
Welcome to dreamers island
leave all your sorrows leave all your troubles behind
Travel to dreamers island start a new life!
Better time will begin

[Bridge 1:]
Let these days pass by Don't believe a lie!
Escape from reality

[Refrain:]
Welcome to dreamers island
leave all your sorrows leave all your troubles behind
Travel to dreamers island start a new life!
Better time will begin
[repeat till end]
