[Music: Mindner, Klauke; Lyrics: MÃ¼ller]

I wake up soon before the dawn brakes
What's this place where am I?
I squat alone in the corner of any room
A fear to run a fear to hide

Sweat ice-cold it runs down on my neck
The door is locked barricades beside
Oh god is this my own house?
Who has this done perhaps I myself?

[Bridge:]
Pieces of a dream come back to me
A dream so wonderful a dream so frightening
Faces in my memories are passin' by
Don't know who don't know where there are

Dirty faces in the mirror deadly lookin' down on me
Empty rooms with white dressed people in a dessert far away
Many needles in my arms headphones talkin' low to me
And a wall of foreign memories hides a secret endlessly

Faces in my mind are gettin' clearer
Some are friends some are really bad
We all share anything mysterious
A secret that's stolen from my mind

[Bridge:]
Pieces of a dream come back to me
A dream so wonderful a dream so frightening
Faces in my memories are passin by
Don't know who don't know where they are

[Refrain:]
Feel it coming step away from me
Stolen memories won't come back to me
