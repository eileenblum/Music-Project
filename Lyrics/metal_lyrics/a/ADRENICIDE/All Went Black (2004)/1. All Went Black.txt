We've reached our destination Erased-blink of an eye Mindless determination Deface-our mother dies Lifeblood contamination Fast forward-ending soon We breath in ash Mankind beneath a killing moon  What you gonna do when the well runs dry? What you gonna do now you've torn the sky? What you gonna do if the Earth fights back? What you gonna do now it's all gone black?  All went black Same mistake- nothing's ever learned All went black Last chapter- final page is turned All went black There's no one- no one left to mourn All went black Hope for Mankind rests with the unborn  All went. All. All went black. Black  Mosh!  Headlong to termination Above us jet black clouds End-game contamination The becomes our shroud An air-born vile contagion All life is torn apart Bleak landscape- devastation Mass murder a fine art
