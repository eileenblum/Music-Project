[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Evaristo]

Vomitarium!!!

Gasping for a Cider
My throat is so dry
My liver surrenders
My body can't win
Lasting torment
My mind is afraid
My toilet my bedroom
Welcome to the vomitarium

Drowning in the sick
Waking in the filth
Nausea the future
Ceramics sanctuary

Vomitarium - drink until you're done
Vomitarium - sobriety won't come

Need a taste of beer
A vulcanic drink
'Cos i'm coming to a slow-down
Lost by the sink
A tragedy unfolds
Blown out my gut
An acid digestion
Stomach evacuated
