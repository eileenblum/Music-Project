[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Evaristo]

Health and safety
Ignored with rage
A path to wastland
Chemical doom
Bars high, danger signs
The stench is blowing into my room

Meltdown - steal your breath
Meltdown - as despair come to your town
Meltdown - burn your skin
Meltdown - sarcastic ways

Fail to comply and agree
Will result in legal action against you
So keep away and nobodies fucked

Strategic words they shout
Council houses coming down
Turn our clean rivers blue
Poeple powerless and static
But what you gonna do?

Factories built
Polluting constantly
At hugely life costs
The government's behing the mask
