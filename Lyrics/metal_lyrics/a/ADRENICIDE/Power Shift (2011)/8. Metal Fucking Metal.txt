[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Evaristo]

Take you to a real Headbangers world
But you got a million things to prove
Not like the shit you seen before
Don't go try and test your luck
Be Metal, bitch, listen and hear my speach
Hidding behind that Emo face
Won't help set the pace (out this place)

Pray for your life everyday
That we will guide your way
Of the beast, rage unleashed
Crush the weak and kill them all

M-e-t-a-l
Metal
My evil thrashing, aggressive life
M-e-t-a-l
Metal fucking metal
Under the spell
Sound the bell
Speak to kill
Dragging us all to Hell

We'll fuck you up - fuck you up
We'll fuck you up - fuck you up
