[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Armstrong, N. Evaristo]

What's the point of writting lyrics?
No one reads them anyway
Pretentious bastards, mindless Punks
Pretend they have shit to say

Short as fuck - as fuck
Short as fuck - fucked
Short as fuck
Short is the way to go
And that is short as fuck

Cut through the fuckin bullshit
Now i'm singing random words
Hoping that the chorus comes soon
'Cos my inspiration as left
What?
