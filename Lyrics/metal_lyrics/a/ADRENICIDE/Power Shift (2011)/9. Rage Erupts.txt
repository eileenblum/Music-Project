[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Evaristo, N. Armstrong]

The panic, running wild
Atmosphere of a constant disorder, lost
Crashing force, fear upon the rebel
Weight of a tyrant's fist

Tear gas - burns my eyes
Mob rules - mod rules to defy
Fierce riot - through the night

Silent screams, broken glass
Nazy pigs come for us
Night of anger, clashing tribes
City in danger
Rage erupts

Acrid smoke fills the sky
Hell is here, corporates fearing death
Now run amok
A battle field of blood
Can't contain the flock
Tantalizing words don't mean shit

Battle charge
Beast on my back
Territory taken
Hidding tough behind a strong shield
Over turned riot
Man burns
