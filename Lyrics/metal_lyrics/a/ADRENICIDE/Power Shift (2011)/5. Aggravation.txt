[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Evaristo, N. Armstrong]

Anger rising, blood is boiling
Broken views set to explode
Bury the hatchet, axes to grind
The condition is as sick as is you

Parasite under my skin digging in
Dirt on my nails where you live
The throne by my side
The thorn in my throat
The wolf in the sheep's clothes

A-ggra-aggravation
A-ggra-aggra shut the fuck up!

Crawl back into your wood-work cockroach
Fly onto my windscreen and crash
Streached on a red line
Anonymously currupt
Wipe all the stains off your soul
