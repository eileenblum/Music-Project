[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Evaristo, N. Armstrong]

Trouble is upon all nations
Delivered years of cruel intentions
Banished ideals, molded laws
Humanity's lost

Brutal acts
As bad as they can be
Mindless rats, fundamental thiefs
Brain washing, make beliefs
Global death plot

Global death plot
Population control
Global death plot
Control the populations growth
Die!!!

Fuckin bastards feed on greed
Pollute the air on which we breed
Tattered minds, frantic souls
Humanity's lost

People die, silent screams
Birth control, implanted chips
Closing doors on aphaty
Global death plot
