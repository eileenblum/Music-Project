[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Evaristo]

Born an outcast
Black sheep from birth
A street as a father
His mother a whore
Not white, not black
Caught between tribes
More to prove and nothing to loose

Rise through ranks
His cold blooded climb
The summit a place divine
His heaven of crime

When it comes the time to prove your tough
They'll say:
Vatos locos
Then you'll show you've got the balls to kill
They'll say:
Vatos Locos
Have you got the courage to display your hate
Vatos Locos
Rip your enemies all by the throat,
Our way
Vatos Locos
