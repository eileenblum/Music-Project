I've done my timeI've paid my dues Know right from wrongI've no excuseMy cards are markedPossessions baggedMy name is shit,my leg is tagged Better watch where I goBetter watch what I doBetter watch,watch what I sayNo mistakes! Got no car, no home, no jobSystem labels me a slobIgnore my fines, I pay no taxBut now I'm out-ain't going back I'm out on bail!
