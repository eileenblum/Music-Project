There's a company close to my home
They mess with my genes
And chromosomes
They alter the D.N.A. of my food
Put shit in the water
To change my mood

Sodium fluoride and P.C.P's
Chemical cocktail of C.F.C's
Modern day Frankensteins
Stealing our brains
Pour toxic chemicals down our drains

We live in a toxic society
Poisoned people - toxic society
We live in a toxic society
Deadly world - toxic society

Hang power cables
Over your house
Treat you like a laboratory mouse
Radiate me through the phone
Frys my mind &amp; makes me a clone
