Brain-dead clone,do as you're toldProgrammed at birth"Chosen" fate unfoldsProduction line-a processed raceSoul-less fuckin' robotExpression-less face Fall in line-follow the herdWear the chains of the slavesStay in line- believe their wordsFrom the cradle to the grave Can't you see you're all the same?An empty spaceWhere there should be a brain! Life mapped outFrom your first breathRepeat set patterns until your deathDestroying thoughtCrushing your willReset your brain all hope is killed
