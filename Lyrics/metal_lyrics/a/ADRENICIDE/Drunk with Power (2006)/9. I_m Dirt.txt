How comes you landOn your feet every time?Why is your skyAlways bluer than mine?I choose to pushYou know I should pullMy glass half-emptyYours half-full Call me human garbageThink their words really hurt?Label me as shitThey say my name isÂdirt! How comes you're happyWhile I'm feeling like shit?Rain fell like pissIt's me it would hit!Catch 22-can't help how I feelMy life or death?Huh!both don't appeal Dirt!-king of the sewerI'm dirt!-lord of the filthI'm dirt!-dirt!-human debris I'll live with the ratsIn the home that I've madeMy pre-fab slum where no rent is paidBorn in the gutter that's where I'll stay-fuck what they say! You're so popularAlways making new friendsI'm so despisedMy relationships endNot of your worldI don't seem to fitCos what I touch, man;Turns to shit
