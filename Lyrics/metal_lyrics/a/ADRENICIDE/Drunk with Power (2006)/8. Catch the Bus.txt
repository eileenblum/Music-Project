Friends have all goneAnd your parents don't careSit in your roomBusy going nowhereThey don't understandThe sorrow you feelSay "it's all in your head"But you know it's so real Pressure is buildingMy heads gonna popThink I'll take a journeyWith only one stop We're gonna - catch the bus!It's never gain,always lossWe're gonna Â catch the bus!One way ticketYou can't catch us! Relatives gatherOne cold winters dayWish they had realizedBut what could they say?Decision was madeSuch a long time agoActions, not words-is your"Told them so"
