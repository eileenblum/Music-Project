Planes straif the hill side"Top Gun" for our eyesDesigner warfareWatch  the share prices rise G.I. Joe stays safe in his tankAt the frontPoliticians says who dies in the HuntDeluded troops of Uncle SamForce their beliefs on foreign lands Toy soldier!-watch him go!Wind him up!-catch the show!It's the same in every warDevastate with shock and aweAnnihilate the weak and poorA devil in a soldiers uniform Corporation play-thingActing out their roleDestruction is the game with money as their goal Business man stays safeIn his house far awayAction man heroRepeats what he saysGods hypocrites they take their fillMetal angels swoop to kill Fight for the right (to be a dick) Pictures that we seeNever show the true storyChoreographed battlesAnd a fake march to glory Edit out the deathRate the slaughter P.G.1000's lie dead they don'tWant us to seeFight for a God they never seenSpread the words of the obscene Fight!Right!Dick!
