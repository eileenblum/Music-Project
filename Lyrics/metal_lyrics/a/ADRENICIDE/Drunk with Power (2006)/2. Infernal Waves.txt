Only playing songsBy the bands you know that matter It's infernal!It's infernal!Sonic terrorismMakes your ear-drums shatter!It's infernal!It's infernal! Play the new-school bandsWho have got a cool new songAnd the old-school shitThat's been around so long Turn the volume up to 10And listen-listen to the show-show! Infernal waves-infernal!Only play it if it's from the heartInfernal waves-infernal!Keeping faith or the scene falls apart
