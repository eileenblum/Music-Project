Been dragged to hellAnd beyond for so longBelieved  what you saidI was wrongLeft for the vulturesBeen dragged through the dirtWords stab like nailsLeft wounds that still hurt Scars showBut  you don't understandBlood flowsDrawn by my own hand You coloured my world with shitOur world with shit againYou coloured our worldWith your bullshit A witness to my own funeral pyreMind war rages, never cease-fireAmongst the wreckageI'm baptised in flamesDrowning in crimsonExistence of pain
