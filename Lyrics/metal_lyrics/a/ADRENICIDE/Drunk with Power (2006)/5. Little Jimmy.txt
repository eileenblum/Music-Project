Jimmy was a boyHis parents didn't love him Though Jimmy tried real hardThey still placed all above himHe got straight "A's"at schoolBut that still wasn't enoughAnd all that Jimmy wantedTo be shown a little love So Jimmy took a Tech-9And he took a Smith and WessonHe rode his bike to schoolJust to teach them all a lessonHe went into the school-yardAs usual insults flowedBut Jimmy has a supriseNow it's time to lock and load! JIMMY! Years of repressed angerUnleashed that summer dayWhen little Jimmy lost itAnd he blew his friends awayJimmy went back homeTo see his mum and dadWith a little smileHe gave them all he fuckin' had Jimmy climbed the stairsAnd went into his roomHe sat upon his bedCos he knew the end was soonTook out a shot-gunPut his books upon the shelfPut the gun into his mouthThen Jimmy killed himself
