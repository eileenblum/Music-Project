Your head's full of shitThat they don't wanna knowAnd your body's in a placeWhere you didn't wanna goYou're tied-up, strapped-downStaring at the wallAnd the therapy don't workThat just made a bigger fool I don't wanna live - liveThis way!I don't wanna feel - feelThis pain! Taken all their pills&amp; you've been to all their groupsAnd you've sat, sat up and begged&amp; you've jumped throughAll their hoopsDone what you're askedLike a puppet being jerkedYou feel a fuckin' failureCos none of this has worked I don't wanna feel - feelThis fear!I don't wanna live - liveWith hate! Ward 13! On ward 13 you're neverGonna leaveYou say you're getting betterBut they never will believeElectric shock treatmentFucks your mindAnd leaves you numbYour family is no helpVisiting hour never comes
