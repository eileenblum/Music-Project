Tooth chip &amp; thrashElbow to your faceGet in the pitIf you cannot stand the paceViolent breed is ragingPunch suckers on the jawLosers on the outsideKick suckers to the floor Punks &amp; thrashers together as oneA raging whirlwindWhere violence is funYou'll feel it tomorrowWhen you awakeYour skin bruised purpleAnd your bones all ache A squadron of psychosThe floor their war-zoneDrunken schitzo the gutter their homeSlams like a madmanActs like a foolBreak heads, snap bonesTear down walls Punks &amp; thrashers moshing as oneA bar-room brawlWhere violence is one Get in the pit-in the pit!And form a circleGet in the pit-in the pit!Do your shit-in the pit!Get in the pit! Total madman dude watch him rageSlams like a pro,jumps off the stageHates Nu-Metal bandsThinks they suckGot a look in our eyeThat says don't fuck Stuck in a time-warp since '88Never gave up always kept faithOld-school warrior true to a causeNot a sold-out bitchLike those Nu-Metal whores Kids are thrashin' all aroundBanging heads to the soundGoing round in circlesTo the beat of the bandMoshing like a lunaticDrinkin' beer until you're sickDiving off the P.A. never knowingWhere you're gonna land
