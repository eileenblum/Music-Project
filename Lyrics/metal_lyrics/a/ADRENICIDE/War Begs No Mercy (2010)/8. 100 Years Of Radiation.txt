[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Armstrong]

blast felt around the world
shake the foundations of life itself
mutual distruction the goal
destroy in one second 5 billion years

the second wave... ends what the first started
the second hand... counting down the hour

100 years of radiation
1000 years of pain
10.000 years of desperation
1 second without thought

the last remnants of man
to ashes we turn
burn in the pyre
fire engulfs what's left
evil invaders, black reigns
scarlet tears

blast felt around the world
shake the fundations of life itself
mutual destruction is the goal
DEVASTATION!
last remnants of man
to ashes we turn
burn in the fire
fire engulfs whats left
RADIATION
