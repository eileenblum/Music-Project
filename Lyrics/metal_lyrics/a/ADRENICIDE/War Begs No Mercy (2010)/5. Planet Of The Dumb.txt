[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Armstrong]

embryonic ediots again to be born
the womb that follows the silent to burn
childwood spent with second-hand lies
no wonder they grow up wrong
nation made them, society shapes them
empty vessels never filled
kill, free fall, lunacy pandemic
the planet of the dumb

ignorance, is color blind
for knowledge, there's no need
nation, nations of idiots
stupidity has no creed

the planet of the dumb
of the dumb
society keeps us numb
keeps us numb
the truth will never come
never come
watch the dumb scum run

run out of time
fall in line
stupidness a mass birth right
rule of fools, tools for the machine

parasitic over-lords rule over the earth
they keep us down and crush our spirit
outlaw hoods joke with empty minds
individuality, trapped under foot
nations made them, society shapes them
empty vessels never filled
kill, free fall, lunacy pandemic
the planet of the dumb
