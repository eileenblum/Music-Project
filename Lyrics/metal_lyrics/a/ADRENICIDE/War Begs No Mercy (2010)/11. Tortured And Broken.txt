[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Armstrong, N. Evaristo]

Low life, reject, fucked with the wrong guy
He was taking his cut, but got caught
Frippery buy, hand in the cookie jar
Took 3 grand, they took his life real slow

He bit the hand that fed
That path led to the death
A journey into hell
A taste of pain that no one's ever felt

Tortured - he was
Broken - soul crushed
Left to die - will is killed
In pain
Tortured and broken

Strapped down in a leaning chair
I scream, fear bleeds out
No second chance, busted, no life
Warning to the rest
Warning to the rest
