[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Armstrong]

thrash.......

forced to fight, believe in lies
your soul a suckers everyday
you think your mind is free
but suckles hold your world in place
automatons can't find a way
conflict of ideas, a stream of lies
disonesty their policy
innocents they fry
you watch them lie
we breathing bullshit for eternity

display to me
display to me your fucking face
explain to us
how you manipulate our race

crucified you leave behind
sadness of a wage left upon the world
evil propaganda at an edge they contemplate
beneath the skin chameleons curl
rhetoric of lunacy that fills the skies
an enigmatic tyranny
inner sanctum breach
forcified bridge
sanctified the lands of all the haters

display to me
display to me your fucking face
explain to us
how you manipulate our race

behind the vail where they hide
the serpents coil

his the truth true?
are their lies false?
what is the truth?
what are the lies?

crucified on a cross of lies
the truth is falling from the sky
feeble rebel in a constant coma contemplates
hidden masses of the third reich
