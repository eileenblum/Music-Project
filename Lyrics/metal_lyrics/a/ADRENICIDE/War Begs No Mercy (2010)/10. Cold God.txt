[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Armstrong]

born, born from deceit
plastic messiah, slow walk to defeat
colorful, idiots path
autocratic despot, call out the damned to die
cyanide, ritual
take off his flesh, drink off his blood
fools silent birth, dogma
you are cleansed, they are corrupt

second coming frozen
the chosen once failed
once failed

cold god, god cold - [2x]
forced to believe

demon exists in a void
corrupt deceiver, forsaken destroyed
servitude, slave chain to the cross
self obsessive monster
lord of the mad decrees pain
spiritual, death, demon
cosmic flesh, disaster beyond blood
baptized in filth, stigmata
nails through his skin
lies come much worst

born, born from deceit
plastic messiah, slow walk to defeat
colorful, idiots path
autocratic despot, call out the damned to die
cyanide, suicide
cyanide, suicide

forced to believe
life of deceit
drown in conceit
forced to believe
