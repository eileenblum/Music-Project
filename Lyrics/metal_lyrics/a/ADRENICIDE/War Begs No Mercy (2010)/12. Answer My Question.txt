[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Armstrong]

if there's a god watching down from the sky
question...
if there's a life after death when i die
tell me now...
is there a Hell in which we all burn
answer that...
if i am wrong where do i learn?

answer my question
when will i die?
answer my question
wanna know why
answer my question
change how i feel
answer my question
prove you're real

is there a Devil under my feet?
question...
if there's a sin which soul does he eat?
tell me now...
playing as Gods in the flames down bellow
answer that...
christ and the innocentes to the Hell that they go
