[Music: N. Evaristo / Lyrics: N. Armstrong, N. Evaristo]

i left my city 'cos i felt sick
i dream of home, now the mud is thick
b...bullets fly, can't stand the stench
my cigaretts are wet

no toilets on a battle field - no shit
no toilets on a battle field
no toilets on a battle field - no shit
my rifle's jammed
one bullet left
i'll save that one for myself
so where do i shit, sarge?

my boots don't fit my feet are drenched
wanna get home get out this trench
so - soldiers die... who gives a fuck?
just a statistic

...dear father the bombs are dropping like rain
fear runs through my veins
i'll be home one day
but i'll never be the same again...

no toilets - no shit - [4x]

no toilets on a battle field - no shit
no toilets on a battle field
no toilets on a battle field - no shit
my riffles jammed
one bullet left
i'll save that one for myself
