Finger on the buttonThey've targeted my homeIrradiated drunks in the fall-out zone Obliterate my liverToxins in my veinsAnnihilate my kidneysStrontium in my brainTerminate my bar-billA like of poison aleMutations in my pubFail-safe system fail Nu-clear puke!Indigestion caused by nukesNuc-clear puke!Florescent gunkGreen atomic chunks Desrtuction ensured mutuallyBombs above my bedDepleted uranium 238Stock-piled in my shedMissiles raining downAs the ground shakesGenetic break-downThe Geiger counter breaksNuclear winter comes I freezeI have no fearNo chance of salvationBut I've got my beer...here
