They've got their beady,Piggy eyes on everything we do(the strong-arm of the warlords,Break down your door)That's why I've got a 1,000 namesFor the bastards that wear blue(wrong arm of the lawRotten to the core)"Pig", "Bacon", "Rozzer", "Fuzz", "Babylon", "Five-O", (these animals? protect us?), Might as well say "Fuck-heads"'cos that covers it in 1 go,(tell these fucks... where to go), Call the police!Call the police!Call the police bastardsPhone 9-9-9Call the police!Call the police!Call the po... call the policeman a swine Get these beasts off my backGet these bastars in blackget these mother-fuckersOff my streetWankers... on the beat
