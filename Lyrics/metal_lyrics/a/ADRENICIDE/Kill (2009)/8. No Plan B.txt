No-one ever listenedNo-one ever there...to count my scars 1-2-3-4No plan "B", no destinyNo second chance is left for meNo hope, no goalsNo sanctuary, no return to sanityNo fate, just hateIt's suicide I contemplateI'll wai, but no-one rescues me...save me No plan "B"Ain't no life for meNo plan "B" 1-2...no-one counts my scars 1-2-3-4, N-N-N no plan "B"
