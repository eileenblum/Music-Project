Lesson learntYou're liying in a casketAnother statisticOh this fucked up counrtyNow, for you, just flowersOn a graveTo prove that you evenLived at all Problem is your attitude sucks!Attitude problem?You're fucked! Little man, who walked so tallMet a real lunaticNow don't you feel small?Teen-age scarfaceThought he was so badDead in a box, no-one remembers
