Jackles in ackboots&amp; snakes in blackPin-stripe tyrantsPrepare for attackFactory spews shitAs they spit green liesMorally crippledNo care for who dies Mass consumptionNeck-deep in shit and drowningOut of control, confusion reignsOh high...we die! Our every move is watchedThey crawl into your headEvery freedom lost...at what cost? Government pigs, Pigs govern over sheeps they've madeGovernment pigs Ghouls in governmentPigs on the street, zombie flock...They're blind to defeatSelling us shit &amp; lies we don't needFear and dependencyThe filth that they need (now, let me tell you a storyI was walking down my streetMy street, and this pig says to me"empty your pockets son" &amp; I said"what the fuck? this is my street, &amp;These are my fuckin' pockets!So if you don't mind, fuck you sir!"So this cop says to me, and he's angryNow "empty your pockets, or I'm callingFor back up" so I say to him "back-up?!, What is the collective name for aMutha-fuckin' bunch of pigs?!")...brain...dead...pig
