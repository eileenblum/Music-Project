There's a Cleric in my sandwichThere's a Vicar in my 'fridgeThere's a Muslim in my closetNow my brain is under siegeCatholics in my showerThere's a Bible in my soapHoly Water is my pissGot a Pope up on a rope Turin beach-towelsBible comicsFully-posable day-glo ChristIndex linkin-in God we trustWashed of our sins...Except greed &amp; lust Got Jehovah on my door-stepI found Buddah in my bedSikhs swimming in my sink-trapHindus hiding in my headKrishnas in my bottlePouring Karma in my glassGot a temple in my stomachI've got Rabbis up my ass Pope! Pope on a rope! rope!Pope! Pope on a rope! rope!Pope! Pope on a rope! rope!Pope?...dope! (Pope...rope..dope!)Can't cope7th-Day Adventist...Was lurking inside my shoesOpened up my trash can,Man, and out jumped 50 JewsMormons in my cornflakesI've got Jesus in my cheeseBanker-priest stole all my cashLeft billions...on their knees
