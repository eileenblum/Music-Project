A crack of thunderBreaks the moon-lit skyPower surge leads:Leads to your demise Flesh will burnBones will charThere's nothing you can doFried aliveBoiled insideA bolt sent from the blue Blast: will strikeSnaking from aboveIt's gonna courseRight through your veinsMassive voltage: over-loadThe vengeance of the GodsIs gonna fuck you up again Struck by lightning...(twice)Struck by lightningNurse! go get me ice!! Electricity runs down your spineAdrenalin; will surge againFucking up your mindFlesh will burnBones will charA pain you've never feltFried aliveBoiled insideYou feel your brains will melt (flesh will burn)(bones will char)(fried alive)(boiled inside)
