I fall asleep, dreams splattered redWhen I rise, wish i was deadConstant Hell, the nightmare lastsFeels like my brain's in quick-sand&amp; I know i'm sinking fast Feels like a maggots in my brain(my brain!)Drilling holes - it's insane(insane!)Curled like a fossil in my bed(my bed!)I'd rather be dead Never learned the lesson,Wake afraidNightmare vision,Wake afraid...wake afraid...aaah! Wa-wake afraidI close my eyes&amp; I see HellWa-wake afraidSick twisted dreamsOf dead things that seem so realWa-wake afraidI'm in a cellWa-wake afraidSick twisted lifeThe nightmare comes
