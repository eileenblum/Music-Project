I knew this guyDown on his luckMet this girlShe liked to fuckWent to her houseHe felt so goodDrunk some wineGot in the moodKissed her titsTook her panties offShe spread her legsSaid..."eat from my trough"Put Rohypnol in his drinkTied him upNow taste the pink,Blearrrgh! No Brazilian,Massive thatchNeed a rake,To part her snatchMunching carpetChewing rugShe left a trail,Like a slug Spit the hairSpit it out!Choke on fur, time runs outSpit the hairSpit it out,Choke on fur (time runs out!) Spit it out,If you don't want to choke,Spit it out,If you don't want to chokeSpit it out,Don't die as a joke! Spit the hair Under-carriageFlaps come downMuted screamHear no soundRepetitive strainIn his tonguePendulous labiaSoaked in cumBitch squats downon his facePubic veilLost without traceForced to eatFrom twisted slut2 kilo fur-ball in his gut Respitory system failGenital cuttings, stacked in bails(vaginal jail)His face, her throneHe can't escapePussy over-grownShe moansHer final ask:His minge-skin mask:Her task?To save cum in flasksSpit it out!
