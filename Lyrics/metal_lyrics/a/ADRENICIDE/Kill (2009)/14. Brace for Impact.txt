Collision course;Unknown is the pathThat leads to demiseExtinction level,Event unfolds before your eyesA curse? an omen?In the fire we'll be cleansedThe coming destructionUpon us; no defenseA prophesy? prediction that's so oldLeaves the planet coldIgnorance? a blessing in disguise?The price of knowing?To know this is goodbyeTo die awake: Awakening of the GodsThe odds against us(brace for impact)hell approaches at near light-speed...all life dies(mankind must face the fact)A race against time...(brace for impact)Death appearing in the blackened sky...we die!(mankind falls dead)Brace for impactThe coming of the end Deadly force,Now known is the fateThat leads into HellEvolution derailedDominant species failsThe clock it ticksThe final page is readNow tolls the bell,Life hangs now by a threadDefiance? there's no chance to surviveOur science failsAs nothing's left aliveTo die afraid: afraid of what will comeThe Gods have left us Nemesis: comes the opposite of lifeLife in the balanceComes now the fireFire raining down,Down the rivers of denialThe blood of every nation:Will splash ashoreApocalypse is comingArmageddon at our doorFather Death has dealt his hand,The dice is thrownThe debt now paidMade afraid, laid to waste, our fateThe Sun will never rise again,All hope is slayedThe final card is playedThe game is: chaos reigns!...
