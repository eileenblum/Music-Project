A soldier, a rebel?Killing machine modelThe signs show hateNo-one wants to see'til they're blown awayWe ain't bitchin' Punk Disaster awaits...doomsday will comeall your worst dreams come trueNightmare made fleshThey al...all shall die! Welcome to the...suck Born from rubbleCriminal generals laughIt's chaos on highLevels of reasoning deceasedYour honour's fucked Just a biginning of what I callInfliction: right uponA wrapped heart drown in darkWithout direction, even hopeLocked-on inside his mindWhile higher minds generate warNo distinction, negativity,Unceasing joke War...within warsDeath machine,Again raging out of controlHold to your gunsFace your enemiesThe blood runs through your hands Welcome to the suck!
