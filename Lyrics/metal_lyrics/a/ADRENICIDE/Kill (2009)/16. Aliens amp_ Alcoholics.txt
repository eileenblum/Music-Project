Engage!Went to my cool-box'cos dude, was I dry20 bottles empty,So I looked to the skyI see bright lightsAnd an Alien ship20 Greys in a daze:Each havin' a sip Taking samples from my brewThey tried to leave for outer-spaceCrash-landed in my back-yard'cos the pilot... 'cos the pilots off his face Aliens &amp; AlcoholicsArea 51 here we come Climbing from the wreckagecame a beast with 50 eyesSaid to me "man, crack a can...or else you're gonna die!"I'm getting drunk withE.T.Watching re-runs of "X-Files"Earth invasion cancelledAs the pubs are drunk dry for miles Come on lads...Agents in black helicoptersCircle round my lawnSearch-lights target monstersThat beer has caused to spawn"nice planet - lets take it!"Aliens in their multitudeDescend upon my townExit-velocity... can never be attainedFuel-rods &amp; beer kegs... have been drained Aliens...Aliens &amp; Alcoholics...Area 51 - here we come!
