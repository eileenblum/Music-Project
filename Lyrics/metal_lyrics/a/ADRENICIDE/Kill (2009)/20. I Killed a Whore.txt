17 minutes past the hourThe motherfucker waitsEvil look in his fucking eyesLike a Wolf lurks by the gatesEyeing up little childrenThis fucker deserves to dieI'll cut this fuckers throat,His throat, and bleed the bastard dry I... don't see... why ICan't just execute this guyHe's slime; pond life i killed a whoreNear a liquor storeI killed a whoreHad to even the scoreI killed a whore Territorial warI killed a whoreKilled a whore Nearly half-past 12Out the wood-work junk-heads crawlFucking filthy, fuck-headsThey've got no self-respect at allDrop their used syringesIn the street and on my pathI'll stick their fuckin' needlesUp their dirty Junkie ass These are our streetsWe'll take them backFrom the mother-fuckers dealing Crack,Smash them in the fuckin'...face the factThis is our worldI'm sick and tiredDon't even thinkI'm half-way doneWith your Punk-assYou low-life
