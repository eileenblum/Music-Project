Crossing timeless oceansFull speed to distant shoresInvasion force in motionBring gifts of hate &amp; warConquest of the ancient waysKill in the name of ChristDevastate the hereticsLet them feel God's knife They are bringing...death and God's word Killing without mercyWar-monger of the crossWomen and children put to the swordElder's secrets lostWarlord priestA bringer of plaguesA poisoned jungle HellIn blood inked is the storyThat history never tells Burning &amp; lootingThey plunder destroying their landsKilling,they rape;fear God's thunderBlood on Christian handsStabbing &amp; shootingThey murderBlood-soaked is the landSlaying, they bring slaughterDestroying Holy lands So! Let them eat steel(Let them eat steel)Let them eat steel(Let them eat steel)Let them eat steel!Crushing without mercyJesus at their sideSmash their templesSpill their bloodA hidden genocideArmy of the Holy onesSoak the dry ground redVicious wielders of the "truth"Won't stop 'til all are dead Let them eat steel
