Run through the smoke
You're an in-mate
The city a prison of ha-hate
Siren screams a war-cry, die!
Light the fires tonight
Fight the fight
make society pay

Wings been cut
Your eyes are blind
You're acting so deranged
Screaming insane words
Tuned to a world... of endless rage

Ignite the fight
...night after night
Ignite the fight
...resist their might
Ignite the fight
...pig get your share
Ignite the fight
...the fight's never faire

A spark starts the flame
Run insane,the future?
A cutting bloody blade
Afraid of what you've made
Laid to waste, waste is laid
Throw the molotov

(ignite...the...fight!) go...
(ignite...the...fight!) fuck...
(ignite...the...fight!) yourself...
Cop!
