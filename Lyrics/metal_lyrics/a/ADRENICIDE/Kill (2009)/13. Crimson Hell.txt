Relationship is breaking upThat woman always breaks my ballsOnce a month she is a bitchA screming, bleeding psycho-witchEvery 4 weeks on the blobI'm left alone with hand on knobPart the red Sea,Grease-haired scragBut sex is banned:She's on the rag! You always treat meLike a piece of shit, bitchYou always say that:"you can scratch your own itch"You always leave meIn my room with my pornBut when the tides out,You want horn! Crimson Hell!The Devil's Spell!Crimson Hell!...what a smell, bleaarh! Smashing cups and throwing platesIt's me alone that woman hatesGirlfriend cries when she ain't sadTempermental?! she's fuckin' mad!Turns down every advanceShe'd stab me if she got the chanceA blow job is a mortal sinDoors are shut, painters are in
