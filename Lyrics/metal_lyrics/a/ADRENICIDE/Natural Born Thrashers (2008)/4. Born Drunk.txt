My mother was a bar-maid
And my father was a drunk
When they mixed their cock-tail
9 months later came this Punk
Never went to nursery
And at school I wasn't missed
Playing hookie with the big kids
Only homework? Getting pissed!

Suckled on sambuca
Nurtured on the jack
Drunk before I'd crawled
Everyday...spent on my back

Born drunk
10 green bottles hanging on the wall
born drunk
you bet I drank, I drank 'em all

Never knew a nipple
Only bottles, kegs and cans
No fluffy toys in my push-chair
Just empties in my pram
Through my mothers pregnancy
She poured it down her neck
That's why I was born drunk, man
That's why I am a wreck
