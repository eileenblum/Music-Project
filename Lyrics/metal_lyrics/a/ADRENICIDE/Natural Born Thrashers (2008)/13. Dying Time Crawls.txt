Straight-jacket so tight
In bite the straps
Broke on the inside
Fragile heart strings snap
Finished with this life
Should've been born dead
Denied dignity
Blow a hole in your head

Mind is a prison
Without locks or bars
At war with yourself
Mental coup d'etat
Leaves scares

In this room so white
Everything so black
Prozal world so small
There's no turning back
Never changing Hell
World within four walls
Your soul destroyed
As dying time crawls
