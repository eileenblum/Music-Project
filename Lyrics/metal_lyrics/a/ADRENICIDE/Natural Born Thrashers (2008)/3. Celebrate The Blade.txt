Cold steel pressed into his palm
His eyes reflect no light
Instinct drives his will to kill
A hunter of the night

Moral guide-lines blurred
To kill without one word
"I hate no God"
Celebrate the blade

Brutality in perfect motion
A master of his heart
Flesh his canvas; sufferance due
in frenzy; torn apart

Moral guide-lines blurred
To kill without one word
"I hate no God"
Celebrate the blade

CELEBRATE...CELEBRATE THE BLADE
CELEBRATE...CELEBRATE THE BLADE

Acting out sick fantasies
To kill and kill again
Relentless he will track you down
The only question: "when"?

Exquisite in his violence
He'll play games with your blood
Swift incision; blade comes down
Left face down in the mud
Brutality in perfect motion
A master of his heart
Flesh his canvas; sufferance due
in frenzy; torn apart
