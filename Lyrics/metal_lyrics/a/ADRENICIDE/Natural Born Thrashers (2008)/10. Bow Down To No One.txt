Be a rebel with a cause
Won't fight their wars
If your mind is closed
Kick down the doors
No 9 to 5...no bosses bitch
Nobodies slave...no getting rich

You maybe in a minority of one
It's still: "fuck you"
It still means they're wrong

Bow down to no one
Bow down

Don't be a dick, dude
And use your brain
Don't swallow shit lies
Go against the grain

You maybe in a minority of one
It's still: "fuck you"
It still means they're wrong

Bow down to no one
Bow down to no one
Bow down

"I smoke when I wanna smoke,
I drink when I wanna and I mother-fuckin'
Skate where I wanna...
...fuck and shit and piss and bastard
mother-fuckin' pig!"

Break their chains
Run wild, run free
Choose your own path
Choose your own destiny

Bow-down!
