Victims crawling through the wreckage
Fallen race takes it's last breath
Pulse slows - to a crawl
Silent Hell - to live means death

Systems raped
Systematic reaping
Broken world...
...of life devoid
Evolution at a stand-still
Mankind steps into the void

Six billion screams
Our last serenade
Day turns to night
As vital signs fade

Futile cries of an endangered species
Humanity falls to it's knees
Selection process a random harvest
Mankind has become a disease

Life expectancy in free-fall
Bio-collapse - rapid decline
Tip the balance into terror
Ground-zero paradise

When the shit hits the fan
Where will yu stand
As vital signs fade?
When the shit hits the fan
All will be damned
None will be saved
When the shit hits the fan
Where will you stand
As vital signs fade?
When the shit hits the fan
Vital signs fade
