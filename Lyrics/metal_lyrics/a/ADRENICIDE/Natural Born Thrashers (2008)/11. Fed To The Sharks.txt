Living not to die
Beneath the cloak of night
Hiding in the shadows
Invisible to their eyes
A witness to a deal going down
Caught on radar...
...now i'm living under-ground

Run...hide...you're caught
You bet you'll die

Retribution - price on my head
Frantic and scared - they want me dead
i'm on the run and if i'm found...
...Fed to the sharks

Tracing all my calls
Surveillance on my house
Feds and crooks are hunting me
A game of cat and mouse
A witness to a deal going down
Caught on radar...
...now i'm living under-ground

Fed to the sharks
I've no death wish
One false move...
...i'll sleep with the fish

FED TO THE SHARKS
FED TO THE SHARKS
FED TO THE SHARKS
FED TO THE SHARKS
