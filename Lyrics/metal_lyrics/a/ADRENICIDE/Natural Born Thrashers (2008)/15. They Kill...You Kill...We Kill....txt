Deaf and blind to all
Violent and twisted mind
Mechanized to kill at will
A soul no longer alive

They kill...
You kill...
We kill...

Old reasons to act so cold
Decide who lives and dies
Hell is waiting warm
Truth exists afar

Life?
Lives controlled like mice
Aggression can't go uncontrolled
Put in trance to decide the future
As Hell unfolds...
...emptiness your grave forever
never had a chance
insane you are
there's no escape
democracy in flames

They kill...
You kill...
We kill...
Kill...kill...kill...kill...
