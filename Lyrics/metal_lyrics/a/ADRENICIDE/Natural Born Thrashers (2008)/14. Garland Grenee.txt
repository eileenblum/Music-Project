When Garland was a boy
He used to torture cats
Now he drives around the county
Wearing peoples heads as hats

Can't be cured!
No cure for what he has
Can't be cured!
That's why Garland acts so bad

With his little friend
Plays with dollies by the pool
Cyrus escape plan is screwed
As Garland stands and drools

A chemical imbalance?
Or was he dropped on his head?
Cos something inside Garland
Makes him play with the dead

Garland Greene is bad!
