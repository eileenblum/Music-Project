On shores we stood, to always watch and learn.The gifts that you bestow, marvel at your beauty.The host of our land, the pathway to my journey home. Atlantic light, will guide us home.The light from Earth will shine. To you I go, in hunger and in rage,to find solace.But you remain furious at spit at the earth that mocked you.Shape the Earth I wander among, and your promise is true. Atlantic Light, guide me.Atlantic Light, shine upon me. Within your walls, I find a certainty.Of wood and wind you shall be my host.Day breaks, night comes in endless cycles.The shore reminds of times unknown. Breathe within me - this is my path, my light.Breathe within me - to guide me home.Breathe within me - with my light.Breathe within me - to guide me home. My light.I am not beyond.I won't fail.My light. Once we stood on the shore, but now we will not learn.We care not for your life, and we refuse your light. I will host our land.I will guide my journey.But you remain with a will to destroy.Atlantic Light.
