Adjutorium nostrum in nomine Satanas
Per Luciferium, per Ignem, per Aquam
Per Aerem, per Terram, ut potestem sit in te

God of war, vanquisher
Commander of hosts
In the name of the covenant sworn
Between thee and I
Call to thee, come forth from hell
Hearken and come

To my lord and master Satan
I acknowledge thee as my lord and king
And I promise to serve thee forever

Forever...
