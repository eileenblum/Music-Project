Satanas!
We serve you
Lord of hell
Satanas, may the four winds spread your voice of wrath
Great spawn of the depths of the earth
Ascend unleashed from our incantation
We serve you
Lord of hell

Goatlord Satan command
We obey to your laws
Satan demon hellwrath
We are your fist on earth

Horrific dreams, haunts you every night
Visions of sin - blind your faithful heart
Temptations - the cunt of the holy virgin
Hellfire, burns before you now

Goatlord Satan command
We obey to your laws
Satan demon hellwrath
We are your fist on earth

Horrific dreams, haunts you every night
Visions obscene, blind your faithful heart
Temptations - the cunt of the holy virgin
Hellfire, burns before you now

The throne of chaos rises again
Here where seasons never change
I spill my blood for you
And draw the sign of the beast
Appear now as I tell
The old forgotten words
A blasphemy mass through
Unnatural sexual disorder
From inside the pentagram
Demons unseen scream your name
You the great bestial god who
Destroys the creation

You destroy the mysteries of creation

Satanas
Legions walk behind you
Satanas
The horsemen ride before you
