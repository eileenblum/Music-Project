We are millenium 666
Arkhon Infaustus
Is just like coke
Take it, it's fast, it's hell
Ecstasy, pain, you'll abuse... and then you fucking die!

Hokus demons hurl in my veins
Voices inside
They drive me beyond and open the gates of hell
They drive me insane

Pain, war and misery, drugs and sin, here comes millenium 666
Incest and rape, murders and lies, we are millenium 666

Stigmata of the unchrist on my arms
Hell injection
Fucking madness I will never stop
I can clearly see the horns of the lord
Haunted voices speak of sin

I reach other dimensions of hell
Hell addiction
New perverted needs fertile
Back to the earth... I fall
So now give me some fucking more!

I am immortal... so immortal

Hokus demons injected
Arkhon Infaustus fixed
Hail Satan
Hell injection
Hell injection
Hell injection
Hell injection
