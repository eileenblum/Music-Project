Blasting the gates to the four defiled streams
Columns of bodies, smoke and ashes, screams of torment
Engines stroke with bodies, spiked wheels spit the flesh
The wall of symbols shakes with our clashing of the ground... the holy 
ground
Adharma Taptra!!!

Armoured legions, black congest
Death engines, black congest
Spreading death, legion as one
Spreading death, black fucking multitude...

They whip their truths on your dead thirsty soul
Peace is a bitch raped by it's own will
Worms of eve, Eden decease
Time drunk flesh, genetic evil inheritance

We're the venomous manna of the womb idol mass
Malign interceptors, black tanks, storming menace
A trial before the whore, blessed by Christ
And I wash the human waste, menstrual larvae

Spat from the ribs of Christ the blood fed worms of time
The demon's semen flows from the cunt-shaped wound

Disguised in misery, degenerated, drugged angels
Inspired by cruelty, holy disaster, the end is near

Armoured legions, black congest
Death engines, black congest
Spreading death, legion as one
Spreading death, black fucking multitude...

Hell conquerors, whirlwinds of the night falling disgrace
Hell conquerors, the final season, always riding forth
Hell conquerors, whirlwinds of the night falling disgrace
Hell conquerors, the final season, always riding forth
Reign of the Hell Conquerors
