I am the creeping chaos, rampant toward every life form
The devourer of universes raging inside my bowels
Planets are led astray behind me
Entire worlds collide within my sight
I am the ultimate anti-matter that time and space never affect
Astrology have led all wrong as only I can judge and sentence
The parasites of divinities adored for millennia

I am that mighty evil that you fear and long for
Like a fly around waste, like a man around Eve
You crawl before me in obscene dances
I am the murderer, God among man
Flies around my soul and cockroaches in my mouth
For I am the spirit of the hive whose voices sound like one
I am the hidden and permanent chitinal obscenity
The ant that builds tombs around their God

I am the great code of every cell
The scourge offered to all
The passage to the other state
And peace will come through decay
