Believe my lies...

Scream! Babylon, reaching God falling now to the ground
Men bristle upon the earth... hate and fear, God divides...
(Words become flesh)
Words forgotten, never karned, no way out from this cell
Human words, holy will, evil talk may unites...
Flesh become words!

Words of Eden, without end nor time
The world is dead for the closest son of God
Forgive, what cannot even be conceived
Walls do not exist without sight

...And from the dark they rise
Born in sickness
...The serpent tongue reveals
Lit in darkness

To reach the language of her procreator
Her tongues knew not but the cum of her progenitor

"God where are you?", now she says
Nothing but the words of yours', grunts of joy, sights of pain, Jesus lives
Swallowing origins, no words, no flesh bitch, kneeling down, learning Hell
Free or chained, without words, a dead God thrones above a dead world...
