Heretic laughters in distorted senses shred the world in thunderous sounds
Enslaved to the religious bitch from inside cursing all with equal hate
The Devil's kiss before I die to the great sacrament of the Grand Teneh

Rising from the deathlike slumber with pain amid the voices that mean nothing
But reversed words from the womb engraved reeking putrid semen elevation toward the light
The limpid blood of the surrounding stream frees the lumbs enforced with filth
Faeces open deformed visions of reality forever dwelling before morality

Desecrated lineage of vision, penance through senses
The rape that no one fears wastes the essence of sin
The veil of the widow is a cum sudarium
Desecrated lineage of vision, penance through senses

Prophets of vain sights gave relies to all the cross shaded birth of the replica
Holy of holies, rising of kings, greedy of sins, killing and raping
Sado-repentance of the ghastly bitch, and there I stand relieved from purgatory

The brimstone smell fills my lung and the sea gave up the dead
The mocking wrath of the prophets vomiting steel to crush nations
Laseive angels covering the walls, I am the flesh, I am the church of Hell

Apostles mystifying verses load cum into baptismal waters carried by addicted angels
To an heroin cult of relics and idols, symbols to themselves of Baphomet
And I am legion, taking the throne usurped by lethargy divine
Gehenna stands and all will follow to the everlasting laws of the whore womb

From the blood of Ahaziah we mock the Lord that once was
Hosanna Sathanas, I bring the humiliation of Christ
Sheol blessed forehead, I am the abomination of God
The infection iniquity of the ten have raised me from ghost to God
