And lie came out of the mass
With the gift of the corpse
Flies upon his crown
FLESH
Grotesque icons
Gifted gilded rotten
Hyperion
Eternal life through flesh
Receive Deceive Believe
Hyperion
Receive my flesh
Narcofili sancti
From the contaminated vial
Narcofili sancti
Suffer in offer the fire in shelter
Narcofili sancti
Seal my sins in sight of silence
Narcofili sancti
Slaughter sacrifice
Homosexual sin
The flesh of the damned
The secret of god
A human body turned the corpse of an angel
Dismembered icons Revelation of god
Judas made God again
Glorification of vanities the fruit is rotten
Tasting flesh fed by sin fed by horror
Experiencing the dead reversed voices of god
Whispering angels gapped by flesh stunned by anger
Revering the obscene and absurd gift of life
For my flesh is meat, indeed
And my blood is drink, indeed
Miracles in the desert are irrelevant
Until the word was made flesh
Full of grace and truth
Foul embrace of dust
Condemnation for those who refuse the flesh of the son
Revelation to those who drink my contaminated blood
You have no life in you
Triangle to spiritis
My words that I speak unto you
They are spirit and life
You have no life in you
