Scourge of God
The intense knowledge
The matrix has failed
Triangles of light
Crawling up my eyes, flies filled with lies
No one ever sees the only star that shines not
Spaces beyond your vision
In the disturbed astral equilibrium
The whore will arise her body full of scars
A map of all stars
The key resounds again and again
THE KEY RESOUNDS OVER AND OVER AGAIN
Trigrammaton
The logic that fails
Trigrammaton
The matrix inverted
Trigrammaton
Light of Saturn
The logic has failed
Scourge of God, crawling up my eyes
The intense knowledge, flies filled with lies
The matrix has failed, no one ever sees
Triangles of light, the only star that shines not
And all the light failed at once
And the first star to die shone again
An enemy ever present
An enemy hidden by the sun
Into the triangle we are drowned
Spaces beyond our vision
In the disturbed astral equilibrium
The whore will arise her body full of scars
A map of all stars
THE KEY LIES IN PATTERNS
Trigrammaton
The logic that fails
Trigrammaton
The matrix inverted
Trigrammaton
Light of Saturn
The logic has failed
