All stars are magnetised into one single god
Ancient Kopte unlocked
Evanggelion Youdas, second son of God.
Apostle without light
Your faith is based on lies
God sent me to die
Sacrifice Salvation
God has ordered to betray
Two sacrifices must be done
And one must be forgotten
I SEE FROM A NEW ANGLE OF THE SUNI SECURE THE AXIS OF DISORDER
One sin ordealed one scene ordered
One sin revealed one scene condemned
He that is far from me is far from the sun
He that sees darkness in light is a king
He that sees me will see the death of the sun
Serve the cadaver of the last meal
Disciples around the dead
A teaching of light and darkness
Sights of wonders that frighten angels
A decree from God to deceive a child
Offered to men, the darkening of the sun
A gospel enemy of the church
The truth behind all doctrines that all refuse
Your faith is based on lies
His light is forsaken
Forty days of seduction
His faith is abandoned
Three days of salvation
Now he rises from the shadows of death
Desert my soul and grant me light
Divide my soul and show me darkness
