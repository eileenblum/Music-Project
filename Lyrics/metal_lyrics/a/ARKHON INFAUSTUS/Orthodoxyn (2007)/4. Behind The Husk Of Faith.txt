Light can be talked about, but not the Eternal light
Names can be named, but not the Eternal Names
Unity that skatters the divided
And one simple god to gather them all
Ritual is the husk of Faith
The door to worlds, worlds of chaos
Behind the husk of Faith
Into the seed that sees not the cosmos
Whose husk pulses into the Macrocosmos
This is the harmony of the corrupted
Pure essence of the foul verses
When all the world recognises beauty as beauty.
This in itself is ugliness
When all the world recognises good as good.
This in itself is evil
Eternal exaltation of the minded
Hypergeneration of the degenerated
Seeing into darkness is clarity
Your own light returns
To the source of Light
Into the practice of eternity
And there we are at one with the darkened light
Shadows of a thousand suns
Into the practice of eternity
Back from madness the mind has talked
I am the mistake of the Tao
And I have seen into the eyes
Of Kalima
Light fails once and forever
Ritual is the husk of Faith
Change as only constancy
Behind the husk of Faith
Power of the asharat
Universal failure
Breaches into conception
Satanic exposure
The black apostolate
A temple without walls
