I have heard the call from the Ziggourath
Abysmal voices from the geometrical non sense
Distortion of the Icon, bleeding from the painting
We are the Church and you are the priest
I remember when they have called
E JEMEN AN KJ
Through the desert I have witnessed
On the mystical path of Ur
Into the sixth sanctuary
I have ordealed this master himself
The primeval chaos has been disturbed
By the clamor of the younger gods
We are worms feeding on Kishar
Seven gates that will not be passed
Shrines behind the gates of Ur
In the silence of the gods
Chthonic seed of angles
NETHERWORLD
Stars on tablets
Astral wheel kabal
Alone and drugged I fell
The sage had the tongue of the serpent
And I betrayed my own kind
So the underworld itself had a sky
Now die
Religious infection perverting my veins
The name has been called
Spiritual renewal of matter
Now fall Petra Generatrix
Aids spread into the world itself
Total contamination
Skies Signs visions
Waters
FOR ONE DIVISION BELONGS TO ALL
Divine forces that called upon murder
Signs of Kut shiver round my spine
Now that I know that they have called
And my arms slaughtered the last God
