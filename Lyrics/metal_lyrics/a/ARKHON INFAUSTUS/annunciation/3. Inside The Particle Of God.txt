Inside the particle of God
The opposite energy that proves all
Inside the Particle of God
Quantic principle of evil
Inside the Particle of God
The three sides from primeval square
Inside the Particle of God

A madman holding dimensions
A journey without end
The atom holding infinity
Madness holding humanity
Inside the particle of God

A new sun to hide the highest heavens
A circle including all angles. A new face for the idols
Ecstasy revealed to infidels
Nothing but a force
Nothing but a transformation

The particle of god reversed itself
His reason to be has become absurd
New dimensions interreact
The quadrature is finally a hand
Its reason to be has become absurd
The hidden dimensions opens
The negative energy, the last pillar
Light from oblivion, endless implosion
Dimension Satan

A light without any origin
A force beyond time itself
A silent teaching
A religion that fears no others
The idol standing in nothingness
The hidden God behind all principles
