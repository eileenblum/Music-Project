A river that floats through time. An abstract thought which created itself. The eternal circle. In the end I walk with solitude. I walked the whole way. No more. It is so easy to close the eyes, it is so hard to open them again. The gleaming streak from my
pupils bare the lulling lies but is helpless lost in dark and sweet visions. With each stride a subjacent stratum. Through dark and sweet visions. It bares the lulling lies but is helpless lost in dark and sweet visions that my mind uses to project on the inside of my
eyelids. Like a flying one who was remembered that he isn't able to fly, I sunk to the ground. No above, no below. No borders, just chaos. I won't need eyes to see the infinite black. Just delusion waits if you try to understand the chaos. Somewhere in a dream. Osseous
marble, fossilized wings. A temple, a hollow and lonely thing. Inside you can hear delusive dreams sing. Inside you can see pale dreams growing. Their leaves scattered like worn-out lies singing from skies so bright. Just a monument for the nil, shaped by time. The sun
radiates black, the world is bright. I'll float in the current. The essence of myself melts.
