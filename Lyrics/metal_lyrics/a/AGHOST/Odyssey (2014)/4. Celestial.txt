A feeling overcomes me as if this whole moment would just be a rough draft that could be just rejected. I search answers in the sky, but there are just clouds and the cold snow which falls down on me like it tries to cover my questioning gazes. The scenery
looks deferred, like it could collapse in a moment. There is nothing subject to rules: Here prevails coincidence. The zenith cracks. Adrift in the celestial, on the edge of internal. Separate between truth and lies. Origin and end beyond the sky. Hope flourished under
cosmic light, wants to blossom into omniscience. The source of two currents in mind, deceit and verity split in two lines. Everything is there, I just have to take it. A vision so clear: Grab the time and break it. Shaped by despair, search the light and awake it. Walked
so far, still lost in a dream. At this point I am not ready to become one with the void. Continuing the track that leads beyond the zenith. Itâs just a step to select between beyond and above. A window to enter. A chaos to transverse.
