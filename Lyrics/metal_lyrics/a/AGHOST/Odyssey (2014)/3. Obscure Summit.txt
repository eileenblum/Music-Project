The mist has passed and my feet carried me to the bottom of mountains made from iron. I start the ascension and snow starts to fall. I keep advancing as I'd hope to simply rise above gloom and disorientation. I just want to face the stars, I miss them.
As I could cling to the stars just because they are the only versant ones. If you drift blind in a river that floats through time, you'll never know where you will strand. Like a stone, as if the river would have abraded all the rough memories. I revel the feeling of
being lost actually. But am I lost in this world, in the time, or just in my head? Did I forfeit myself in dreams? But I am here, how could I be forfeited? Just myself and the snow that accelerates falling like it tries to cover something.
