Am I awake? I open my eyes, still it is so bright. Am I awake? Wait till senses and consciousness connect complete. Am I awake? Questions echo through yet empty space. This world tastes false. Actually just the taste that stays. Everything looks right, but to
me it seems like thereâs a net made of lies that clasps the whole sky beyond the blue. The blue stopped shining in infinity but am I able to understand it? A child that was fed lies sits clean, stops questioning. No poison to saturate this dreams. Everything is imbued.
Let it enter my head. The rules of time tug at the prison made of skin and bone that surrounds me. My mind is infinite. The osseous firmament above it is no border, just a veil for the fools. Am I awake? I still don't know, wait till senses and consciousness connect
complete. Am I awake? Laying down a mosaic, made with limpid memories. Like blind glass and a missing piece. Colours taken, time was the thieve. I still don't know. I close my eyes and start to seep into the black of my eyelids. It is still there, just interlaced in the
patterns behind my eyelids.
