I try to crack those walls that aren't there. It is complex. Have I made these walls up or do I just imagine their existence? They have to fall, they conceal the answers. But I don't know the questions yet. This world is a puzzle, I just miss a single
piece. I'm floating far too long searching the purpose that runs beyond everything. The pillar I adhere to is so rational. Reality and purpose, two pillars hold the order. The track is endless. No track is endless, apart those in my head? It would be better if I could
calm down. To interweave the striae of light in this dark dreams. But are these my dreams or were they poured into my sleep? I am lost. Everywhere. Even in myself.
