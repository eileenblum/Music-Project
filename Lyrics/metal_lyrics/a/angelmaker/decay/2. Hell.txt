I am the tormentor
I am the tormentor

The incisions shall cut deeper
Have we gone too far?

I walk among the cavalry
I am in the devils army
Everyone around me seems to want to hold on to their dreams
He drags a blade through her chest and cuts out her heart
This is the faction of insanity and itâs an art

RIP HER FUCKING HEAD OFF

They say to grab the bull by the horns and then attack
I wish to crush them all as if they were fucking rats

I want
To hear
You scream
For mercy
Before
I put
This hammer
To your fucking skull

And in the end I want to hear your scream
Your fucking life will mean nothing

Her head is nothing but a fucking trophy on the wall
His vision blurred from all the alcohol
He drags a blade through her chest and cuts out her heart
This is the faction of insanity and itâs an art

Impurity until the end will not exist
So let the bloodstained vomit cleanse your love
A heart of gold will never drain a river of blood
She suffers now just like her cross-bared lord
Have you ever seen a preacher without his words?
Tongue cut out and gagged of blackened blood
The sky turns red as the devil marches
To gates of heaven to slayâ¦
ALL GODS!

Lets see god save you now
Lets see god save you now
