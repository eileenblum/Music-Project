[feat. Darian Mazloomi Of Argent Strand]Stand up tall keep your head up high
Fight till the day you fucking die
The world is an ugly place full of hatred and
Lies
Stand up tall keep your head up high
Fight till the day you fucking die
The world is an ugly place full of hatred and
Lies

I thinks it's time we saw the
Demise to all the ignorance
And lies I see
Surrounding our lives

Too many
Hearts broken
Too many
Lives taken

Live to the fullest
Never let them bring you down
And never let the things that are true to you fall
No one is meaningless we all have something to fight for
I will never change
What I have become

I will stand above
All the bullshit that we are fed
Do you know what it's
like to feel alone
Face the facts
We are the ones who are here to stay
Together no one will stand alone

You don't know what you've got till its gone...

You've reached your end
For cheating your life
Focus on your life and your lies of your ignorance and bullshit that you live with.
You think you can
Change my direction
I will never change what I've become

Stand up tall keep your head up high
Fight till the day you fucking die
The world is an ugly place full of hatred and
Lies
Stand up tall keep your head up high
Fight till the day you fucking die
The world is an ugly place full of hatred and
Lies

Fuck you
The end of your life has begun
Because of you
This is what I've become

Where is the change?
What will it take?
Until we break

Watch your fucking mouth
And every single word you say
Or you'll be hitting the floor

I WILL FUCKING BREAK YOU

You've reached your end
For cheating your life
Focus on your life and your lies of your ignorance and bullshit that you live with.
You think you can
Change my direction
I will never change what I've become
