To all those who have betrayed me
I will exact my revenge
And bring your high and mighty world into a sudden fall
I can here them scream as they run back to you
We don't run from fear when death is natural

Fuck you all

This is a patronizing fate for all the unborn saints
And I have been among the broken too many times before
And now I'll walk a cross this lake of broken dreams
A nightmare emerges from the depths

Until our time
Our time of dying
The sinking sand
Forever sinking
Until our lies surround us on our post purity
We will not follow you because you're false security

False security
False security
False security
Until we die...

A blackened burden is as beaten as a broken truth
You cannot free the beast
For he will cut himself loose

As we see that fear, is running from the truth
The hatred of the past
Is coming back to you
I can here them scream
As they run back to you
We don't run from fear
When death is natural

I live this life to see you suffer
Life cut short by the decimator
I live this life to see you suffer
Life cut short by the decimator

SEVER THE PIECES

Until our lies surround us on our post purity
We will not follow you because you're false security
