Her cryptic whispers whistle through the winds
Creaking branches, tangled roots, entwined in ancient sin
The twisting timbers beckon me within
I can't control the overwhelming urge
Something that lurks inside my skin

Her presence haunts my steps
I feel her every breath
I hear her whispers creep inside and down my spine
Our fates entwined, in my restless soul I find
The urge to purge this worthless life of mine

The mistress stares, her skin stretched tight and white
I'm lost within her sight on this starlight autumn night
Pervasive intentions, love fails to lust
Satanic sÃ©ances
The succubus has struck

I can see her dead eyes as they are looking right through mine
Hollowing me out from the inside
I cannot resist the call, into her arms I wish to fall
My body feels foreign as her presence looms and conquers all
Hold your arms around me and bleed me fucking dry

Conjure this animosity in me
Dragging me into apathy
Besiege, she's taking control
Feels like I'm losing it all, her hands round my throat

Underneath her scarlet cloak, sinful pleasures she invokes
To reap me of my soul and seed in sin we spawn sick blasphemy
The floor then opens up wide, emerging from the ground
Sharp claws and wretched sounds
Twisted horns arise

Her lovely skin begins to peel and rot
Vile visions lay before my eyes
Unearthly horrors swirl, bestowed unto this world
I can hear them laugh at me
I fell for trickery and now the beast is free to plague humanity

Ten thousand hands pull me to the deep, six faces in the flames their whispers make me weep
The sons of Satan stare into my eyes, the moon is dead, rains runs red
Tonight the end is nigh

Eat the children, bury the breathing, rise unholy serpents of deceiving
Eat the children, bury the breathing, rise unholy serpents
Eat the children, bury the breathing, rise unholy serpents of deceiving

Let me go
I helplessly witness in misery, horrors I have unleashed
The flames surrounding me and now I burn in regret

To the woods we never go, for evil there it grows
The witch is waiting
She whispers towards you, baiting
To lure unlucky ones into her grasp of thorns
