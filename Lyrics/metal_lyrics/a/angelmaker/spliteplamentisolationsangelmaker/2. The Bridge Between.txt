Watch The
World
Slip
Away
As the line is crossed between reality and dreams
We drift into the obscene

I enter my exodus
My visions begins to dance and things that once were ordinary at a glance
Become something entirely more
Colors explode from the deepest reaches of my mind
And begin to tell me of a different time where these voices I hear inside my head

Begin to whisper so silently and proceed to tell me of all this beauty
That has always stood in front of me and like a movie these scenes play out
Unable to tell what's real I shout

GET OUT OF MY HEAD
Get out of my head!

Senses of ecstasy begin to drastically evolve into a nightmarish dream in which I can't escape from

Frozen in horror as I watch the floor
Open to the darkest depths of my sub-conscience

Voices begin to shout and fill my head full of doubt
That everything I knew, that once was true
Is not my reality?
I dwell in a bending body but my mind is surfacing onto a whole new tide
I'll flow with the sin that I'm cleansed with
Till the break of dawn that I thought would never come at all

Now the walls are closing in
Im losing grip
I envisioned so much more than this
My existence seems trapped until the
END

The chaos ensues in my mind
I don't not believe in the end
My eyes are closing

Why do I see the reasoning between the lines I slip
Why do I feel so scared? Like I do not belong
Maybe that's the way it is and how it's meant to be
Stuck forever on the bridge between

THE BRIDGE BETWEEN

Voices begin to shout and fill my head full of doubt
That everything I knew, that once was true
Is not my reality?
I dwell in a bending body but my mind is surfacing onto a whole new tide
I'll flow with the sin that I'm cleansed with
Till the break of dawn that I thought would never come at all

The dawn won't ever come
I've crossed the bridge, there's no turning back
I've crossed the bridge, there's no turning back
