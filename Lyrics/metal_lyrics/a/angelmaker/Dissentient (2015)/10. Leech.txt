You're a fucking coward
No pity for the weak
Sever the ties
You suck the life out of me

My eyes are dry tonight
When I put you in your place, it almost doesn't feel right
Then I remember all the shit that you put me through
It almost feels like a burden just to fucking know you

I can feel my body weakening beneath the weight
Because you take all I have inside and you leave me insane
I can feel the hollowing continuing inside
I'd like to tell myself that this is all a waste of time
But I know I'll learn, I'll grow
As I'm sifting through the pieces of the rubble
I have always known forgiveness
I have always had a heart
But you pushed me into dark
Now watch it all fall apart

Sometimes I feel like I can't fucking breath
You hold me down for your own bettering
I feel your fangs sinking deep
Leeching off of what I reap

Pain you cause me
Emotions they taunt me
Carving me of everything
If I was your fucking puppet
I'd choke you with the strings
How far will you bend me before I fucking break?

I'm engulfed
Engulfed by the flames
My tired eyes are weak and in pain
Resolutions follow through as your walls of hate fall on you
Crippled and writhing bathe in your shame
You live so carelessly taking no blame
The sentiments we made will fade
I won't miss the memory so just fade away

Oh, may you forget me

This never-ending cycle
A vicious spiral, eating me alive
It's all about give and take
But I have given all that I am
I don't owe you fucking shit

Every time you take from me, do you feel justified?
Every time you belittle me, do you feel satisfied?
Every time you close your mind everyone's an enemy
Every time we say goodbye you're always crawling back to me

Pain you cause me
Emotions they taunt me
Carving me of everything
If I was your fucking puppet
I'd choke you with the strings
How far will you bend me before I fucking break?

I'm engulfed
Engulfed in the flames
May my afflictions bring me shame
For all the karma I bestow
You now can drown in the undertow
In which you forged upon yourself
And now I yearn to be without
Parasitic company
I wish to live in harmony
â¨
And no on
Said it's fair
But nor were
You to me
