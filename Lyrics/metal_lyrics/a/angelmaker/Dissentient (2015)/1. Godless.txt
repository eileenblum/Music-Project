Iâm awakened
Never bound by what I am
I wouldnât want to be
Whatever âheâ has planned for me
âThou have seen no god before meâ

You have met your match
From your womb purest evil is hatched
With your lies, you disguise
All the things that I despise

You will rot alone in the dirty ground
Alone, alone an afterlife will not be found

This isn't hatred this can only be fate
To say the least, your shit is fading away with heresy
It isn't wrong to believe but it's just such a disgrace
That the narrow fucking minds are the ones running this race

Trust me when I say
I know true evil comes in many forms

I will never be whatever you want to see me be
I want to watch you plead on your knees fucking begging me

Their blind eyes see not of the horrors to come
Wasted breath on deaf ears
Children of earth, all guilty of sin
Cleanse them of the ignorance that lies within

Desecrate
Its time to realize we are all
Godless
Godless
GODLESS

Obliterate
They are a dying breed
Hopeless
Fucking
HOPELESS

I hope you see the reddest eyes draw from the blackest hell
Abysmal wakening, as the darkness fell
The figure stands before as tears of fear fall from your eyes
The devil calls for your hand
And he'll show you where the truth lies

Underneath innocent feet, I dwell in lucid conjuring
Holding dear the broken souls
The lost the damned the wondering
Did your preacher tell you, how unconditional God's love is?
Is it eternal? It is a weakness
Consumed by a culture, leaving you blind
I see no gods, but only meager minds

Fuck your faith

Iâm awakened, never bound by what I am
I wouldnât want to be whatever you have planned for me
