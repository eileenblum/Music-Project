[feat. Ryan Robillard]Plunging from zenith
Spiraling ever so downward
Oh, why do I hold on to this dismal feeling?
Descending ever so downward

I feel lost

Reaching out through the dark
Hoping for answers gone
Every moment in ash
The wick has burnt away

There were moments burning bright that I hold on to tightly
Now I stay awake and gnaw my wounds more than nightly
And I can't see what's illuminated right in front of me
With every shaky breath I lay awake in melancholy

I lay in my dismay
Another love now lost so pathetically
Lacking the will to push
Too weak to strive, to reach out for the light
I've traced my tracks through the sands
To find out where it all began, and if I could relive those times I would have burned brightly

Resonating
In a state of disillusion
I'm constantly reaching for validation and evaluation to create a conclusion
Desperation
This never ending desire to know where I'm standing and I'm not forgetting the moments that I have been feeling cast down to this abyss to be dismissed of all my bliss and I, to my core know that I can be more than this and I try to keep my soul so alive, but I dive ever so downward

Stifling the call of my heart
These shadows are draining me of my spark
Choices I've made now tear me apart
This mountain of mistakes I've made from the start has ever diminished my senses and spirit
I sew my eyes shut, for the dark I revere it
Bathed in failure
I'm so full of missing pieces

As I lay in my dismay
I now have found, I've lost my way
No conviction behind my every word
No restriction to habits I've deemed so absurd
I can't feel
I don't know what is real anymore, and to my dying core
I'm lost inside an eternal war
