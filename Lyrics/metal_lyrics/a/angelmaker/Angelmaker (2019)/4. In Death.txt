In death I am free
One with the reaper, you and I forever now
Burn away in darkened fury
Break free from chains that bind us
Burn in darkened fury
Break free from chains that bind us
Burn alive in darkened fury
Embrace the endless misery

If we're going to burn
Show me pain for what its worth
Feel my rage until your grave
As I'm burning now
The only truth that I have found, is I am nothing but the ashes left behind

We'll devour
Lend us your agony

Leave behind the pressures and pain to which you're holding on
Release of pain the break of chains
Inner hatred best let free
In death I am free
In death I am free
