It's always one step forward then it's two steps back

In my head, all I think about is death
My suffering eternal, wounds infernal
Misery keeps calling me, inflicting me, deeper and deeper
Deeper and deeper, ecstatically eager
I'm burning my body to set forth the reaper
Suffocate in the black, a sanctitude of sick for me and you
Crippling to the will of hatred
No salvation to run to

We all suffer in a cycle built and bound to claim us all
Scraping through the agony we suffer so religiously
SAVE ME
Devour me alive or just gut me with a knife
Nothing I can do will ever rid you of my life
Every breath is agony, and all I know is

THERE'S NO WAY OUT

It writhes its way in

Left to rot alone again
Shackled by the chains of my own disdain
Misery my company, endless agony consumed by the wounds which inflict me
Of all the wounds that cover me none of them more burdening
Than the hole in which the pain inside resides eternally
Crawling in my skin
Immeasurable torture

Hollow heart
Sunken and aching empty soul
Devoid of hope
My body is not whole

Death stands in front of me
Ridding me of all I see
No more pain and misery
The reapers gift has set me free
Full of sin
I'm pulling back my skin
Tearing out my organs and exposing all the hate I've kept within
Creeping, bleeding, seething, weeping
Bury me alive, in a coffin full of knives
Suffocating sickened cycles left me seeking out the scythe
I yearn to feel peace once again

I'd rather die than live like this
