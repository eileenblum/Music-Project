This sickness never ends
Constantly begging for air I suffocate under the weight
I crave escape
Aching lungs exposed my body festers full of toxins
Filth is all I know

Drained 'til I'm bitter spent and strained
These magnifications of pain
Have cost me more than my dreams
These aspirations decayed
Leaving me insane
I can no longer retain
I can't take this anymore

Agony's always upon us
Idle I deteriorate

Snapping spines, cracking sternums
This pressure crushing me
Let the weight break me down if this is what I'm meant to be
Pushing limitations of pain
Through the psychical agony
The signs behind I've never seen
Where'd it go so fucking wrong?

Reeking of cortisol
I long for rest
Begging to be washed clean
Rid me of stress
What has become of me?
I long for rest
Traumas so far from fading
I can't fight this stress

Damn this habitual disconnection
I long for rest
Taxing more than my soul and complexion
I can't fight this
Unending days enshrouded in torment
I long for rest
Heartstrings detuned and weary
I cannot fight this
