I can't help but tell myself that I wish I found out earlier
Never could I have imagined how this could have happened to meâ¦ to usâ¦ to youâ¦

I keep sifting through questions vacant of answers
Only to feel the sands of hope slipping through powerless fingers
Dreams of grandeur lay in ruin, and everything that once was, will never be again.
How am I to pick up the pieces?
I've grown distant
I've become hollow
Not a moment passes that I don't beg to take your place

I just can't hold myself together anymore
When alone I look in the mirror and I can't even force a smile let alone breathe with ease
How can I have the capacity to be when my heart's in constant atrophy?
Heartache is a lot more than it seems and why do I carry on?
Well, I know it's what you would have wanted but it's hard to breathe when you're gone
I swear I'll make you proud
I'll hold on

I'll miss our conversations and I'm sorry we couldn't grow old together
We will meet again even if it takes forever
I won't go cold nor will I slowly wither

This isn't fair, but I see the sun
Coming to terms with our final farewell
All has unwillingly come undone

Dreaming away
Floating free
Visions of amber spilling grief

We'll dream again
I won't forget
I'll heal and mend
I'll find content

Sunsets of golden rose
Spirits dance beyond the cold
You reside in the meadow of my memories in gleaming light
Eternal glow

Ethereal
Gone with the tides

Without the grace in which you gave
I would have drowned, I would have caved
Although you're gone, you're always here
I'll find my way and meet you there.
Thank you

Things are better now
I'm holding on
I have so much to tell you when we meet again.
I know you'd be proud of me
(I want you to know) I think about you all the time
I miss you
