Forward we stride with fear in our eyes
Into the jaws of death
Vanquishing brothers and fathers and sons of our conquerors
Mortars and fire ignite like sunlight

The sands stained of such blood
Lead hails from above
Trenches reeking of agony
Unfathomable pain surrounds me

Explosions of red
Trapped in my head
Brethren dead
Endless carnage ahead
Mangled corpses broken flesh
Lead as rain from heaven sent

Breach lines forward
Razor wire torn
This place is so godless
Stories will tell how we fought this

Willingly cast into the jaws of death
Broken men battle through annihilation
We answer with our guns razing through damnation
Aim down your sights to bring our salvation

Reigning our fire
Mortars descend upon formidable foes
TAKE COVER
Pinning us down below our enemies
Reigning their fire
Heavy artillery blasting the beaches below
INCOMING
Shrouded in hell as you're praying for peace

SHOW THEM NO FEAR

We have come to put an end to this genocide
Surrounded, there's nowhere left for you to fucking run
Who's going to save you now motherfuckers?
Hoc Est Bellum

Teeth break on every bash
No face just pulp and mash
I decimate, weeping wounds and dripping blood
Clenching onto everything I've ever loved

Ad Victorium

We march on forever
Forward into the next abyss
A hell unfolding
Into the jaws of death
March forever onward, into the next abyss

Willingly cast into the jaws of death
Broken men battle through annihilation
We answer with our guns razing through damnation
Aim down your sights to bring our salvation
