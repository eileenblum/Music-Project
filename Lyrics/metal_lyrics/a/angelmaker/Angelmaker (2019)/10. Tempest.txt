Go
Conquer this world is mine
I'll be pushing every step of the way and I'll see it through that I'm endlessly
Fighting my way through failure and flame
Living for more than myself I shall never let my will be tamed
Stand firm and rise to your calling
Stray far from weakness
Hold your ground
Lean into it
Dig in your heels
Bare your teeth

THIS NOOSE WON'T HANG ME

BREAK FREE
TAKE HOLD

We lack the motivation to pursue the dreams in which we're sold
I won't let my world go cold

Racing my heart and mind to seek the vibration that thrives in my divine being
Fleeting, shining through in perishing light
I loathe this malaise
I can't live out my days knowing my spine is misaligned or a frame too frail to endure against the weight of time

Push forever onward

No excuses
Onward through the storm to zenith
No excuses

Racing my heart and mind to seek the vibration that thrives in my divine being
Fleeting, shining through in perishing light
Rarely I ask
Never I beg
Often I collapse
Always I rise again
