Pale light divine
In crimson skies the stars align
Fair love of mine, her lips I long to kiss tonight
To the gathering by invitation turned to fire my heartâs desire
Drenched in trepidations ankles weighed I slowly drown
Down to the depths where the sun can never shine

At the door, rose in hand
To the depths, I descend with dread
One deep breathe and I enter
Crowded halls full of wealth and splendour
There she stands in the center my rivals all around her
Locking eyes I caught her gaze
Heart sinks she turns away
Closing in my adversaries surround me
Beaten and bound
My innocence is left unfound

Primed to scorch amidst the ever crimson flames
My love has turned for now I shall burn eternally

Inversions grim this eve hollow thy being.
Hell conceived
Empower thee in incantations of lord Satan

I am reborn
I return
I feel the devil coursing inside me
Unholy virtues flowing through my veins

Now I canât feel an ounce of pain revealing
Endless possibilities within me
Hands of darkened might to cast of lightening
All around me skulls imploding

Innocence torn away gone
All control, lost from here on

There she stand frozen in fear as we embrace I vaporize my dear
Now I walk forever in shame destined to kill full of rage
Cloaked in degradation I hide my face

Inversions grim this eve hollow thy being
Hell conceived
Empower thee in incantations of lord Satan
I am reborn
