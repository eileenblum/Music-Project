Where did I go wrong?

One last time and I swear that I'll be rid off this
One last time and I swear that I'll be rid off this
One last time and I swear that I'll be rid off this
One last fucking time I swear that I'll be rid of this

Poison, dissolving in madness
I'm becoming my own worst enemy
Aching, I scrape my fingers to the bone and I know I'm slipping off the fucking slope

I follow the rabbit down the hole
Chewed up and swallowed I am no longer whole

The fear you'll feel are the demons you buried inside
A state of mind where you haven't the choice to hide
Face to face with the darkness you will earn your place
Define your will or you will define disgrace

I loved myself before I slipped
And now I live with regret

Fog of the abyss
I'm much better than this

Chaos reigns

I follow the rabbit down the hole
Chewed up and swallowed I am no longer whole

The fear you'll feel are the demons you buried inside
A state of mind where you haven't the choice to hide
Face to face with the darkness you will earn your place
Define your will or you will define disgrace

So lost, I cannot find my way
No turning back, I've dug my own grave
I had it allâ¦
I watched it burn, burn away
This path I've paved is stained of hur
