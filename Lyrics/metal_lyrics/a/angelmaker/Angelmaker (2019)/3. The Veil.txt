I, in loneliness will wither away if I let the over bearing weight of
the world consume me
The future is as bright, as the city lights
An empire of naught built upon a crown of rot

Your masks cannot hide the strength in which you left to die
Wasting precious time burnt alive
Next thing you know you've pissed away your precious life

The days of judgement draw near
They will not pardon you
When your thirsty and cold will you know what to do?
Insurrection ensues and all you cry for is help
You've failed to see the signs it's time to pay for pain that's dealt

All we do is consume, expel and rot away
We live our lives so blind, looming hell impending

What do you stand for?
Who does it benefit?
Why endorse all the horrors of the innocent?
Where are your calluses?
Where is your composure?
Choosing to filter love and overload with fear

Who are we to blame for all the ways leading us into an age of ruin?
Our forefathers blame theirs
Passed the veils, the meager ways will fail
Fail us all
Let our will determine who shall thrive or die

I'm sickened by the cycle of the world surrounding me
Slipping through the holes of my own insanity
We, the purveyors of our own calamity
Take a step back, is this what you want to be?
How far do we go and at what cost?
Fleeting fame feeding egos so lost
We're trapped inside a cage but the door is unlocked
It's thrive or die but at what cost?

How long can we sustain these crimson ways?
How far can we go before collapsing?
Just listen to the world and all her agony
Your lack of contribution utterly disgusts me
You'll probably say I'm wrong
You soon shall surely see
An age of regress is written in prophecy

Who are we to blame for all the ways leading us into an age of ruin?
Our forefathers blame theirs
Passed the veils, the meager ways will fail
Fail us all
Let our will determine who shall thrive or die
