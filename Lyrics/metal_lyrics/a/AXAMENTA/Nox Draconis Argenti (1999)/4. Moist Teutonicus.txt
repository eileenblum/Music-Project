Into the ninth circle of inferno
Where dragontales glint in snow
The crystal dragon rests ice-bound
Dressed in cold fire she withers

Glass-like eyes reach out for the sun
Benighted her fate will be

Bifacial widow of light
Prophesies the dream's demise

Amongst the ruins of a wayward taint
A wanton betrayal resides in flames

Timekeeper of eternity
A goddess enthroned in light
A testament older by far
Final destiny call

Stemmed in a gale of rigors
A queen of blades has been crowned
