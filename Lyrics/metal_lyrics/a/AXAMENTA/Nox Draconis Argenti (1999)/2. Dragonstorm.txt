It is the dawn of a new dark moon
A man has lost his dragonheart
Into the depths of the fog of ages
Where only lightning paves his way
There where the fire has been laid to rest
The dragon faces his quest

The wings of time have been spread
Along the shores of oblivion
The sign of darkness reveals
The storm of the dragon

Into a dimension of guardians of the light
The strings of fate are being woven
When only the oracle knows the answer
And the child of the whispering wind sings
The spirit of guidance loses it's way

Passing the border of reality
As he dances with faith
At music of hurricanes of black jade
The scarlet waltz of death

Dawn of a new dark moon
Lost dragonheart
Into the depths of the fog of ages
Where lightning paves his way

It is the dawn of a new dark moon
A man has lost his dragonheart
Into a dimension of guardians of the light
The strings of fate have been woven

Passing the border of reality
As he dances with faith
The scarlet waltz
Of death
