Terror swirls around the Nileâs region
Enslaving the masses in its entombed legion

Dead cold scavengers maraud the sand lake nation
Their hide is scathed with marks of devastation

The dreaded fear of a fallen land
Its demise is manâs atrophic shame
The wheels of wrath fall into place
The death bells ring in Egyptâs name

Destiny is at hand

Plague-bound shades corrupt and infest lightâs creation
Itâs mankindâs fall in a vile retaliation
And now - The meek inherit the onslaughtâs vision
As all - beckon the carnage of millions

Terror reigned the empire of the Nileâs region
The enslaved masses have soiled the sand lake nation
And now - The echoes of the death bells stir
To cast - their last chime on Egyptâs world.
