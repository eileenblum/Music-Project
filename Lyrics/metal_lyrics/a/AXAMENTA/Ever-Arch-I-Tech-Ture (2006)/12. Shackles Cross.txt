Upon this bridge the fate of many is sealed
Confronting the collision of future and past
I face the demon that once sheltered within

Into times bygone - into tormentâs reign
I have let my eyes to witness to see
Times incarceration to a certain degree

Under the crimson light of the motorised moon
I face the one whoâs been cast out of darkened times

Nightly horrors have stained red the soil
The lights bleed upon the river beneath
As I am forever reborn, never a burial
So will the fallen rise, another circle complete

Rise - never a burial
Rise - complete is the circle

Upon this bridge the fate of many was sealed
Benumbed by the collision of future and past
I have faced the I identity that once sheltered within me
