Glinting around the wings,
A vitreous gleam of the eyes
Entangles the fleshly garment
In the midnight burlesque
Thickening to visible mist
Earthbound spirits are shown
With elongated limbs ending in vicious claws
For they lie there in the darkness
The chosen tempters of mortal minds
Guiding chariots to a new pandemonium
Are adorned with powers of the night hag
A paragon of vices, lycanthropic skulkers,
Effeminate wraiths, children of celestials
Sorrow sings a passage from the curse of the thorn
Into the nightfall of the elder storm
Within the prophecy where time stands still
It's dead melancholy when a wolf howls alone
Star child demons gaze upon the stars
Orbital bonfires enlighten the night
In a time of no shadows
A swift exodus scours the earth
Laying waste on our proud lands
Our ghost within is lost
An abomination made fierce
A vigil embedded in evil
