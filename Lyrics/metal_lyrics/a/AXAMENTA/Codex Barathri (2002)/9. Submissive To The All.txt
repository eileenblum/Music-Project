And thus the world begins with another tale
The all is creating and dominating
In the intangible vastness of space
Under the reign of Father Time
Wind - Raged storms
Fire - Scorched life
Redeem the martyr into existence
Earth - Holy ground
Water - source of all
Order and chaos come by
O Mater Matrum, minimus sum
Mother Nature under your power
O Pater Patrum, minimus sum
Father time in your era
In all of this man is just a sigh
From dawn of men we try to survive
Four forces of nature to dominate
With dispassionate beliefs we crucify
Feel the falling of her dying tears
Hear her calling on the winter night's breeze
Fear the crawling of her ghosts within
Crave for her, deliverer of life
