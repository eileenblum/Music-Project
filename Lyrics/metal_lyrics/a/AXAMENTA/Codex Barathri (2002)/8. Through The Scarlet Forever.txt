The earth lies ever silent
Under star sent life that saves
This soil you feed's much deeper
Than the shallow of your graves
These throws of bleak existence
Like sting of poisonous thorn
That slay all without scruple
All that is earthly born
You'll burn in your world
I'll rot in mine
Pray for salvation
As prophesised
Through the scarlet forever
In this savage realm
Where Gaia clipped the angels' wings
And your false idol fell
You'll burn in your world
I'll rot in mine
Pray for salvation
Before you die
Through the scarlet forever
Always Astarte signs
Of tormented bodies, tortured souls
And your false burnt offerings
The children of earth now renounce thee
Freed from oppression they knew
Like darkness at nightfall unhindered
Instinct a right of the few
