Starlit hidden eyes by blood and hair
Her head encircled by a dark aureole
Wildflowers entwined in her flesh
A raven's paramour brought to disgrace
Beauty of darkness
Mirrored in the lake
Innocence awaits
On your redeemers throne
In the midst of her raptures
All the ills that flesh is heir to
Are withholding our dreams
And wake her dormant heart
Nocturnal beauty
Tempered in all its supremacy
Nighttime water eyes yeal
For an immortal kiss
Just to be for once caressed
By demon wings
We are the ruins of a dream
The misery we have become
A marbleise icon made ethereal
Romance rusts in a sea of tranquillity
The night is swathed by her call
Our memories are enmeshed in her toil
An everlasting Odyssey forsaken
An ecstatic blood thirst gratified
Souls are estranging to a haven
A legacy embodied invisible
In the endeavourment of the night
Empowered in infancy so egregious
