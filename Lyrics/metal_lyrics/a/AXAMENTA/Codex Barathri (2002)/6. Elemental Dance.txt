We are the end of summer
We are the dying light
We are the god's creation
From elemental might
For we who bleed under the cursed skies
On our journey to the end of time
The soil we plunder, the decay that is man's
The endless cycle, elemental dance
We are the waves of fury
That sweep on writhing tides
We are the newborn children
Stained not with blood of Christ
To ancient decorum humanity slaves
Mankinds witness the end of their race
Winds claim their season and seas their domain
Reason's voice muted, ignited the flame
Sam Hein...possess me with your power
Sam Hein...enlighten me with trance
Sam Hein...devour me in your fury
Sam Hein.........the elemental dance
