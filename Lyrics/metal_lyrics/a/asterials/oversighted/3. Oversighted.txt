i find that all you believe is a lie
with all the grace that you hold on inside
your life made of condemnation and praise
nothing to do but your hands are raised

the most are blind and it will always prevail
but ones who sighted can look behind the veil

think about that the pen is mightier than sword
you believe in a lies that someone put in a word
weaknesses remains a weak there is no strong
look through my eyes and all you see is wrong

they never had a faith in me
so why i should believe in what they say
how they were able to get so much authority?
they try to bow me down for watch me pray

i'm not the one to admire
i find your weakness in what you desire
show me an icon i will call it a fake
your beliefs built on the mistakes you have made

let's call it a global conspiracy
but it's an eyes that won't looking at me
call me pathetic i will stand on my way
so you will fall apart with nothing left to say

blood stained letters will take you to enslave
with empty voices that guide you to your grave

history is mark those who benefit from tribulation
possessed of keep your mind above insanity
we sail in a sea of depression
search for a key to the mind of humanity

you honor the things that you shall fear
the final repentance with third eye blind
so watch a gates as into the mirror
trying to see the light behind the leaf
