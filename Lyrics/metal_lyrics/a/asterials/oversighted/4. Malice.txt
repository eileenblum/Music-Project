i can't remember when we used to start
this conversation out of boundary
every night i used to fall asleep
in a bed built of my sanity
i know the time but i can't really remember
any signs that show me a place
what day is now please tell me
my thoughts went outrace

add a feel of sanity to my existence
i'm not the one on this scene of senses
ascension is the point i'll try to fight
my future is the burden i should leave behind

oh life you try to bow me down
tilt my life down on the surface
to watch me hit the ground

feelings of what used to be
holding me at the same place
trying to reveal me
meaningless guilt for you forever
courage of those fucking days
bury me me at the same place
negative in the same way
sorrow waits for embrace you now

now whats your fucking price bitch?

my idea become an endless treason
the reason you still there a pointless breathing

this comfort drag me
in the further depths that i grown within
this is a progress
your search will always take you back to me

tomorrow wait for
another story you will tell around lately
this road will always
always lead you back to me

misery
grow seed in me

and if you thought i forget everything you said
and everything i lost and everything i get
you'll better run away look back at me
because i can't forget thing we call reality
