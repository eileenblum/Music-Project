this world is on the edge
my pledge is about a question of the age
how is it possible not to see the change?
this is the way we want to turn the page

the stars will collide out of our sight
oh god there is no sunshine
to enlight this satellite

someone's watching at us from the outside
inside we are all about to fucking die
your life means fucking nothing
why don't you even try?

the truth is hiding in the skies
behind the curtain of the clouds
there is still reason to try
open the skyline and walk on the other side

what the fuck do you think we are all about
miserable things on the ground
i find us nothing know we're all about
we meant to see something more in this world
but someone hide it all from everyone
we meant for something more

i swear i never saw a thing more beautiful in this world
we are all seems so small
i want to express this but i cant find a word
these stars have shown me the way
forcing me to stay

you will never know
as i saw things different way
you will never feel the change
look at the star array you will never be the same
open the gate
lockup this narrow cage
