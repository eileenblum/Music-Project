you wake me up
and now i never want to close my eyes
our lives are filled with misfortune and break up
but you're the one who helped me to stand up

standing here broken but not alone
i hope it will last forever
we are exist till world will gone
and after years
i still believe you are the sun
i'll hold you in my arms
till dusk chase us down

thousands of words in my head
begging me to understand
maybe it comes to an end

give me a sign a shining star far from here
where you will be if i still stand here?
this is the way i will decay as i stay
i saw this world through the eyes of foreigner

runaway
we sinking with the ship we've made
it's not a place we'll stand together
it's not the place we always be there
let's encounter our faith
walking through the darkest days
with all the fears we had
and all the chances missed

no afterwords we grow stronger
on the way we reach the stars
we watch the highlights getting older
