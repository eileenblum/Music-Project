incomprehension
something that guide you through your life
behind the mist of blinded eyes

something is haunted when you're fall asleep
because in a dream
there is no safe place for me

i hear voices call me
i can not be only one
bring light into darkness
sources of the voiceless souls

can I save myself from
just leave to oblivion
wander through the spaces
searching for the safest place

souls into a limbo
torment with no reason here
i'm stuck here forever
in a parallel between our worlds

silhouettes fill these universe

no one can save me

one day i start realize what i beg for
with empty vessels i fill for a no one
ascetic way of life is something i can live and die
my soul and feelings is a thing i can't see through my eyes

mirror of soul is a thing i can hold
maybe someday all sins flow away through my wounds

modern sun will take down away every day
but if i can i will push on a replay
something just pull away
it's an emptiness inside of me
the path of god is a lie that lead you constantly
