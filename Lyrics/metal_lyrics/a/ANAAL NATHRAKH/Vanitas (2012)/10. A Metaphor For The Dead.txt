Act! While in delirium,
I no longer know what I say,
or what I do!
And yet it's necessary... make an effort!
Bah! Are you not a man?

Naked and alone, before the cadaver

[A quote from "Pagliacci":]
Ridi, Pagliaccio,
sul tuo amore infranto!
Ridi del duol, che t'avvelena il cor!
[English translation:]
Laugh, clown,
at your broken love!
Laugh at the grief that poisons your heart!

Put on your costume
and powder your face.
The people pay to be here, and they want to laugh.
And if Harlequin shall steal your Columbina,
laugh, clown, so the crowd will cheer!

Pane of glass shattered, yet finally clear.

Ridi, Pagliaccio,
sul tuo amore infranto!
Ridi del duol, che t'avvelena il cor!
