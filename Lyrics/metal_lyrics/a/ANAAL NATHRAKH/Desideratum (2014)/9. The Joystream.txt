[Pre-chorus:]
How does your bounty taste?
Dining on carrion,
What have we done?
Nothing, nothing, nothing!

[Chorus:]
Bathe - in the joystream,
Twenty-nine thousand children to tame,
Tomorrow... the whole world!

...

[Pre-chorus:]
How does your carrion taste?
Are you not filled with pride?
When will we permit this to end?
Never, never, never!

[Chorus:]
Bathe - in the joystream,
Twenty-nine thousand children to tame,
Tomorrow... the whole world!

[Pre-chorus:]
How does your bounty taste?
Dining on carrion,
What have we done?
Nothing, nothing, nothing!

[Chorus:]
Bathe - in the joystream,
Twenty-nine thousand children to tame,
Tomorrow... the whole world!

Bathe - in the joystream,
Twenty-nine thousand children to tame,
Tomorrow... the whole world!
