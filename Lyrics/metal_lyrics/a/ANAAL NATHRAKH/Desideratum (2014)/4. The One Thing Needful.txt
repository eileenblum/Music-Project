Go and kill yourself

...is my own

In silence we wait here
At the bended knee
Servitude, be our master
The one thing that we need

There won't be a second day
This is [?] where it ends

The one thing needful
But in the close of all
From the Lamb of God
Remember meekness
The one thing needful

All praise apathy
...is my own!

In silence we wait here
At the bended knee
Servitude be our master
The one thing that we need

But in the close of all
From the Lamb of God
Remember meekness
The one thing needful!
