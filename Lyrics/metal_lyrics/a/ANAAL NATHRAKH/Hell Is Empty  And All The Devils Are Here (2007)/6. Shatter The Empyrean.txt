The highest reaches of heaven,
Illuminated by a perfect flame,
Shatter the empyrean,
And leave a nuclear winter.

The highest reaches of heaven,
Illuminated by a perfect flame,
Shatter the empyrean,
And leave a nuclear winter.

And when the sun is burning brightest,
Herald the coming of accuser's dawn.

The highest reaches of heaven,
Illuminated by a perfect flame,
Shatter the empyrean,
And leave a nuclear winter.
