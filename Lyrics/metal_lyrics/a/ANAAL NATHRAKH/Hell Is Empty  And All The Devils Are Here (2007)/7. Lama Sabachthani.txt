For nation shall rise against nation
And kingdom against kingdom
And there shall be famines, and pestilences
And earthquakes, in diverse places

Eloi, Eloi, Lama sabachthani

For then shall be great tribulation
Such as was not since the beginning
Of the world to this time
No, nor ever shall be

Eloi, Eloi, Lama sabachthani

And shall cut him asunder
And appoint him his portion with the hypocrites

There shall be weeping
And gnashing of teeth

Eloi, Eloi, Lama sabachthani
