[Verse 1]
The drop
The shock
The [?] in your back
There is [?]

[Chorus]
Oh the horror my eyes will see
Only [?]
Hiding behind daddy dear
Donât peek with your sad little eyes

[Verse 2]
The [?]
The troop
The state-sanctioned shank
[?] to keep you safe

(Chorus)

[Bridge]
Take your seats, one and all
The showâs about to start

(Chorus)
