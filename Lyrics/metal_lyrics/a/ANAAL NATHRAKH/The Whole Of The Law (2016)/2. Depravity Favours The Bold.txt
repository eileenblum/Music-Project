[Pre-Chorus]
Depravity Favours the Bold

[Chorus]
Our sins are stubborn
Our repentance weak
Lavish our confessions
Sins cleansed by tears
Everyday a step closer towards Hell
Without horror, through gloom that stinks

[Bridge]
If rape and poison, dagger and fire
Still not embroidered their pleasant designs
On banal canvas of our pitiable destinies
It is because our souls, alas, are not bold enough
