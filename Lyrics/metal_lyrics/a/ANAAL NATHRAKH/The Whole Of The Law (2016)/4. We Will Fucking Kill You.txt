Apostasy
Sedition
Rebellion
Caprice

The multiplication of our kind borders on the obscene, the duty to love them on the preposterous.

We will fucking kill you
Shall be the whole of the law
We will say we love you
As we scythe you down like grass
See how we will save you, how we'll give you what we have
Diseased spiritual oblivion in an amoral morass

Deformity
Poverty
Greed
For your own sake

I cannot contribute anything to this world because I only have one method - agony

We will fucking kill you
Shall be the whole of the law
We will say we love you
As we scythe you down like grass
See how we will save you, how we'll give you what we have
Diseased spiritual oblivion in an amoral morass

In such moments you will be severed from life, from love, smiles, friends and even from death

We will fucking kill you
Shall be the whole of the law
We will say we love you
As we scythe you down like grass
See how we will save you, how we'll give you what we have
Diseased spiritual oblivion in an amoral morass
