[Verse 1]
[?]
This is what you wanted, this is what you need
[?]

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold your children close and pray for oblivion!

[Chorus]
As the world goes
The strong do what they can
And the weak suffer what they must
Shallow be thy graves


[Bridge]
There shall be the whole of the law
[?] would love to change your mind
Cause you were [?] from me
All this fucking insanity you have to worship me
Trust me cause you're blind there is no way to fucking see
This is what you wanted, this is what you need
