[A sound clip from the film version of George Orwell's 1984]:

If you want a picture of the future
Imagine a boot, stamping on a human face, forever.

With years of pain, frustration
Etched into granite face!
Such joys they fade in memory.
Do not speak!

Do not speak! (Do not speak)

Do not speak! (Do not speak)

Do not speak! (Do not speak)

Do not speak!

Do not speak!

Do not speak!

Do not speak!
