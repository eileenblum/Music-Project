Kill everybody in the whole word... Ahaha!

You have (something) of sustenance
There will be no oxygen to sustain the flame
There will be no air for your kind to breathe
You will wither and become a thing of the past

Destroying Angel!

You have decayed from within
Your redemption is (not sure what he says)
You have become one with your poison
You will submit to The Destroying Angel

Destroying Angel!

You have staggered on the brink of reprieve

Destroying Angel!

Destroying Angel!
You have staggered on the brink of reprieve
your book you're freezing hell
