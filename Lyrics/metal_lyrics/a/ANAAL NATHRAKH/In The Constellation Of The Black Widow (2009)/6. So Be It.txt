Ecce Dominus dissipabit terram:
Et nudabit eam, et affliget faciem ejus,
Et disperget habitatores ejus.
[English translation:]
Behold the lord will scatter the earth:
And will strip her, and will crush her beauty,
And will scatter her inhabitants.

For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh.

(But countless) shall be the son of man

Dissipatione dissipabitur terra, et direptione prÃ¦dabitur;
Dominus enim locutus est verbum hoc.
[English translation:]
The earth will be scattered by scattering, and will be despoiled by plundering;
Indeed, the lord spoke this proverb

For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh.

(But countless) shall be the son of man

Propter hoc maledictio vorabit terram,
Et peccabunt habitatores ejus;
Ideoque insanient cultores ejus,
Et relinquentur homines pauci.
[English translation:]
Because of this, the curse will devour the earth,
And her inhabitants will sin;
And therefore her inhabitants will be insane,
And only a small number of people will be left behind

For by fire and by his sword will the Lord plead with all flesh.
