Book keepers
Butchers
Ladies' men
School teachers
Kissed sweethearts
A row of pansies
Kids in the tree house
Proud parents
It'll all be over by Christmas

Oh for one last
Bowl of borscht
Glass of beer
Cup of Rosie Lea

...up and over...

Forward!
Forget your fear, the guns at your back scream
Forward!
Who gives a fuck if your enemy's starving
Forward!
No place for cowards, up and over
Forward!
Your country needs you, so start killing

Bells ringing
Enjoy a good shit with a paper
Class photos
Knowing everyone in the pub's name
Beaming wives
It'll all be over by Christmas

Oh for one last
Spotted dick
Pierog
Slice of Stollen cake

...up and over...

Forward!
Forget your fear, the guns at your back scream
Forward!
Who gives a fuck if your enemy's starving
Forward!
Onward through the stench of death screaming
Forward!
Your country needs you, so start killing
Forward!
Forward!
Forward!
Forget your fear, the guns at your back scream
Forward!
