The blood is on our hands

Burn... burn... burn...

And we must bear the scars
Suicides... the whole human race... we kill for the... and we will be slaughtered and die [2x]
Die.

Burn, Burn
The blood is on our hands
The  societies grasping consciousness

Until we go to our deaths

Who thinks of the executioner of death? we stand guilty on everyone's behalf
On behalf of the human race, guilty before god AND WE WILL BE...

Slaughtered by the executioner
Lonely souls who conspire to 
Who thinks of the executioner
Not the sick and...
Not the sick and...

And we must bear excuses too, we're going down
Blood and water humanity's big fallacy of heartlessness...
By this evil and sin we stand before god and he must judge us AND WE WILL BE
Slaughtered and die

Slaughtered and die [4x]
