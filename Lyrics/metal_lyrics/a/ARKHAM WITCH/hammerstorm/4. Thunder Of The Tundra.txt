[originally by Thor]Summoned by the Goddess
She needs some volunteers
A band of trained commandos
To scan hemispheres

In search of the sceptre
Who's power soothes the beast
We travel through the snowstorms
And blizzards from the east

There's thunder on the tundra
There's giants across the land
There's thunder on the tundra
There's giants across the land

Our chariots scream with fury
Towards the northern lights
Snowblind we brave the storm
We torpedo across the ice

The dragons guard their treasure
In a metal citadel
We smash down the walls
And crush the gates of hell

There's thunder on the tundra
There's giants across the land
There's thunder on the tundra
There's giants across the land

There's thunder on the tundra
There's giants across the land
There's thunder on the tundra
There's giants across the land

There's thunder on the tundra
There's giants across the land
There's thunder on the tundra
There's giants across the land

There's thunder on the tundra
There's giants across the land
