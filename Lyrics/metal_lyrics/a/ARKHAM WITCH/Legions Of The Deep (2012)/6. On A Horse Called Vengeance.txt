Hang 'em high
Cast 'em low
On Death's chariot
A shape awakes
The earth betrays
This dark Lazarus

A knight in need
A demon steed
Heaven sent!
Dig me no grave
For I claim
The Lord's revenge!

On a Horse Called Vengeance!
He rides into town
On a Horse Called Vengeance!
He's gonna cut you down!

On spectral hooves
Death moves
Guns blazing!
A pale rider
Storms the hells
He's raising
Souls fall - heaven calls
The guity vow
Each bullet, the Lord's work
To stow 'em how!

On a Horse Called Vengeance!
He rides into town
On a Horse Called Vengeance!
He's gonna cut you down!

Hang 'em high
Cast 'em low
On Death's chariot
A shape awakes
The earth betrays
This dark Lazarus

A knight in need
A demon steed

Dig me no grave

The Lord's revenge!
