It's true to say
That we're a breed apart
The mill-fire's in our eyes
The moors are in our hearts
From an ancient town
With a gravity of its own
And the souls so proud
Hear her bleak wind moan

Think you'll get one over me?
Motherfucker, wait and see
We'll tell you once
And we'll tell you briefly
Fuck you - we're from Keighley

We hail the past
And our fathers' industry
That holds the greying gables
Of every stone we see
An anachronistic bruise
On the knuckle of history
'Twas no more in '74
Or that's what they believe

Think you'll get one over me?
Motherfucker, wait and see
We'll tell you once
And we'll tell you briefly
Fuck you - we're from Keighley
