A swift crash of horses
Through the heavy reeds
A slender girl, she rises
From her dying steed
Pursued like an animal
By an evil man
Who falls before
The broadsword of a barbarian

To walk a road
Of slaughter is my doom
I'll sail a crimson tide
Until the tomb
Iron Shadows in the Moon

They found the iron statues
In the darkened hall
Strangely feafured men
From the days of old
And with a flexing,
Writhing of ebon limbs
What should have lain
In silence now begins to live

To walk a road
Of slaughter is my doom
I'll sail a crimson tide
Until the tomb
Iron Shadows in the Moon

A heavy mountain
Of thews and ferocity
Defeated by the leverage
Of braced arm and knee
I fight and now I lead
The Red Brotherhood
And cast off from
This island for good

To walk a road
Of slaughter is my doom
I'll sail a crimson tide
Until the tomb
Iron Shadows in the Moon
