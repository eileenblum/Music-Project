Here I come with fire and steel
Don't question Fate
'cause I am the one
Making short work of every meal
I do the doing
Till the doing is done

So gather round
And bear the sound
Of my enemy falling down
The killing floor
The whore of war
I'll send 'em packing
To Death's door!

Gods of Storm
And Thunder
Gods of Storm
And Thunder
The Lord of War!

So fully trained
In the art of deadly
Listen up my sword, it sings
A massacre filled funeral medley
Of severed heads
And severed limbs

So gather round
And bear the sound
Of my enemy falling down
The killing floor
The whore of war
I'll send 'em packing
To Death's door!

Gods of Storm
And Thunder
Gods of Storm
And Thunder
The Lord of War!

Here I come with fire and steel
Don't question Fate
'cause I am the one
Making short work of every meal
I do the doing
Till the doing is done

So gather round
And bear the sound
Of my enemy falling down
The killing floor
The whore of war
I'll send 'em packing
To Death's door!

Bloody rites
I live to fight
Out crusading in the night
A baleful stare
A heart of ice
A storm filled thunder sacrifice!

Gods of Storm
And Thunder
Gods of Storm
And Thunder
The Lord of War!
