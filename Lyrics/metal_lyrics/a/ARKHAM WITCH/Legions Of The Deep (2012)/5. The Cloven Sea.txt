Seeress cast the runes,
Oh we adore you
Let Smooth Lying bend
To our lustful prow
Hails to Donner, we pray
You stay your thunder
Pass overhead
Our horned helms do bow!

We fight, we strike,
We always survive
Keen for a taste of war
Alert, berserk, we live
To hear the roar...
Of the Cloven Sea! Hooray!

Hails to Wotan
As we stride the whale-road
A deadly wild hunt
That foams the sea
To a distant Ragnarok do we go
To war the eerie trolls of Illrede

We fight, we strike,
We always survive
Keen for a taste of war
Alert, berserk, we live
To hear the roar...
Of the Cloven Sea! Hooray!

Into the den
Of the accursed hellwhore
Shields they break
And swords they will be dashed
To grab a grip
Of the strange enemy stronghold
For ale and Alfheim we are cast!

We fight, we strike,
We always survive
Keen for a taste of war
Alert, berserk, we live
To hear the roar...
Of the Cloven Sea! Hooray!
