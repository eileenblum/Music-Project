So some privileged men
Seek to slander me?
So insecure
Of their own authority
Using their wealth
And their social gait
They seek to subdue
And to dominate
I'm afraid, gentlemen
It's too late for you!

We are enlightened
Inducted Northern men
Whitechapel is not
The only host for them
Dinner and tea with
The Supreme Magus
One big mass of pomp and fuss
Fraternitas Rosae Crucis indeed!

Of the Dew and of the Light
The Lamp of Thoth
Is blazing bright
I invoke the Gods tonight
Make me stronger
The Brotherhood
Of the Rosy Cross
Esoteric Philosophers
Occultists of the North
Keighley Fathers!

Hails to our friend
"The one who has been duped"
I would suggest
That this epithet is true
For why would a gentleman
Seek to boast
Of the sacrifice of a kid or goat
When the greater crime is
A broken oath - or two?

It's true that our circle
Is adept in alchemy
The Philosophy of life
And the art of astrology
But to beget a being
On the astral plane
In the light of the Spirit
Where they emanate
Is a practice from which
We surely would refrain
I assure you!

Of the Dew and of the Light
The Lamp of Thoth
Is blazing bright
I invoke the Gods tonight
Make me stronger
The Brotherhood
Of the Rosy Cross
Esoteric Philosophers
Occultists of the North
Keighley Fathers!

"Remember, the undevout
Occultist is mad
He is but the unconscious instrument
of the evil powers he flatters
himself he commands. At Death,
downwards falls his soul in the realm
of being to spheres of subhuman
existence. His chance of immortality
is for ever lost, and among evil
elementaries he thought he had
made his slaves he leads a malicious
existence of uncertain duration,
until having expended his vitality,
he gradually becomes unconscious,
a flitting phantom, disintegrating,
atom by atom, into surrounding
elements, at last he is gone, not
leaving even a shadow behind.
Such is the fate of the faithless"

So in conclusion,
My dear gentlemen
Mathers, Westcott,
Blavatsky, all of them!
Seek in the cause
Just to publicise
And to plant the notion
In the Neophyte mind:
That only a mason of
London can be wise!

True faith is not found
In a mark or degree
Or in the vain posturing
Of their pageantry
The greatest source
Of the greatest wealth
Is not by greed or not by stealth
But through the maxim,
Man, Know Thyself!

Of the Dew and of the Light
The Lamp of Thoth
Is blazing bright
I invoke the Gods tonight
Make me stronger
The Brotherhood
Of the Rosy Cross
Esoteric Philosophers
Occultists of the North
Keighley Fathers!
