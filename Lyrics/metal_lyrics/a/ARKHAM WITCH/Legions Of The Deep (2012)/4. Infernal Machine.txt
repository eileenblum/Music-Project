Oi!

A red eyed cyborg atop
A winding stair
Howls at twin moons
That lag the carnage bare

War Machine of Hate!
War Machine of Hate!

A crimson spasm spews over all
Before the dark batteries
Legions fall

On the ground men try to save
Planet to become their grave

Radioactive nightmares form
Laughing at the world forlorn

Infernal Machine - Oi!
Infernal Machine - Oi!
Infernal Machine - Oi!
Infernal Machine - Oi!

A nuclear brain, an atomic heart
The science of ripping
Flesh apart

Black mathematics
In a metal brain
Calculate trajectories
The bullets rain

Annihilation now online
Download death into his mind

Doomsday weapon, human shape
Planet killer laying waste
