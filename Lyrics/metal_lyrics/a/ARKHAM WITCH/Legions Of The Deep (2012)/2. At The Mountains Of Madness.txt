Remember that big expedition,
Back in '32?
Well, I came back from
That icy journey with
A different worldview
Elder gods, giant penguins,
Cyclopean cities
Mankind's place in this hostile
Universe was clearly set for me!

At the Mountains
Of Madness, baby
When I met you
At the Mountains
Of Madness, woman!
The Elder Gods
And Great Cthulhu!

I could see an endless vista
Of wondrous mirage
Housing creeping evil shoggoths'
Protoplasmic charge
Pre-Cambrian illumination,
Deepest dawn of time
Was this flippin' revelation
Only in my mind?

At the Mountains
Of Madness, baby
When I met you
At the Mountains
Of Madness, woman!
The Elder Gods
And Great Cthulhu!

I don't wanna go
I've read too much Poe
Were we too blind to see
That mankind is a cosmic joke
A poor absurdity?

Ia! Ia! Ia! Cthulhu
Ia! Ia! Ia! Cthulhu
Ia! Ia! Ia! Cthulhu
Azathoth!

Bastard sons of star-head spawn
That ne'er walk nor crawl
Who'd have thunk this alien race
Was father to us all?

Remember that big expedition,
Back in '32?
Well, I came back from
That icy journey with
A different worldview
Elder gods, giant penguins,
Cyclopean cities
Mankind's place in this hostile
Universe was clearly set for me!

At the Mountains
Of Madness, baby
When I met you
At the Mountains
Of Madness, woman!
The Elder Gods
And Great Cthulhu!
