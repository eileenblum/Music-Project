Smack 'em in the face
Kick 'em in the head
They're a disgrace!
Punch 'em 'til they're dead

We will not suffer a poser to live
They're always taking,
but they never give
You downloaders, you shit talkers,
you fucking posers will never stop us!
For metal!

Lying in the grass
Like a fucking snake
Always on your arse
And always on the take

[Chorus]

Here they come, in their shiny denim
Been in the scene, since forever

Since when my friend
was it up to you
What is false
and what is true?

Smack 'em in the face
Kick 'em in the head
The only good poser
The one that's dead!

We will not suffer a poser to live
They're always taking,
but they never give
Suck the scene
just like some parasite
Passing judgement on
what's strong and right
You downloaders, you shit talkers,
you fucking posers will never stop us!
For metal!
