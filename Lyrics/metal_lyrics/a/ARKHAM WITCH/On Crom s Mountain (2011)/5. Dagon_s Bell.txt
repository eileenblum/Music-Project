Grey sombre bell
Tolling weird foglight
Follow to dwell
In the weeds of her caress

Gold in her hair
The priestess is calling 
In darkness she glows
In dark spectral bethel

Submarine churches
Order esoteric
Mother HydraÂ´s spell
Coiling in old father DagonÂ´s Bell

Brooding fishhead
Chthonic scholar
Contaminant
Moontide philosopher

My body bursts and swells
in unknown calling 
Transformed into
Oily wrath of the sea

Submarine churches 
Order esoteric
Mother HydraÂ´s spell
Coiling in old father DagonÂ´s bell
