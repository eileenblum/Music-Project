Honey, spare me the details
CÂ´mon now, cut the crap
Well tell me where to go woman
Show me where itÂ´s at!

Some men got their subtletics
Some men got tact
Well, I ainÂ´t got none of these
Baby, IÂ´m a batterin ram!

I got the right connection
I got the will of steel
ThereÂ´s only one direction
When IÂ´m behind the wheel

Storm the gates!

IÂ´m living in a ramÂ´s head
I got the monkey on my back
A prehensile nightmare 
When I attack!

Hungry like a wolf
Demanding like a prince
Well, all I know here
That lifeÂ´s a bitch!

Some men got their subtletics
Some men got tact
Well, I ainÂ´t got none of these
Baby, IÂ´m a batterin ram!

Raise the stakes now one more time
Before we kick the can
Way to play, your place or mine
Baby IÂ´m a battering ram!
