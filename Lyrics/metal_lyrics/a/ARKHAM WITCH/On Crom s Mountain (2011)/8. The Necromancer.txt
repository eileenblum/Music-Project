Lies and pain and an evil heart
I walk this world a man apart
Ancient voices crowd my brain
I assure you dear, youÂ´ll live again

The Necromancer!

Lika a black banshee on the winds of death
I walk the road of nightmares on the devils breath
Take my strength from the souls they give
In grey grim world under coffin lid

The Necromancer!

The last vestige of entity leaves you, 
and your weary soul welcomes the cold eternal repose of rest
The calm of non-being and the forever dream of secrets
as the scent of heaven drifts in dying nostrils
But through the fleshy cosmos comes a strange groan 
and the crackling twitch of stiff dead fingers
You hear the call and your black lungs dusty howl, 
as the runes muttered seal you in hell

Awake!
