"Incest makes feel at home",
She knew no difference,
The fact that it remained
A "secret" left an imprint,
Sobbing as she takes his pain,
Heavy breathing,
Mental relapse like before,
Now she's bleeding.

Self portrait, of hatred

Churning hatred in her head,
He's still speaking,
Light switch on, relieve the dark,
Rarely sleeping,
Remedy will never end
While its vivid,
Child within is between lies,
Wake up screaming

Self portrait, of hatred

Churning hatred in her head,
He's still speaking,
Light switch on, relieve the dark
Never sleeping

Self portrait, of hatred
