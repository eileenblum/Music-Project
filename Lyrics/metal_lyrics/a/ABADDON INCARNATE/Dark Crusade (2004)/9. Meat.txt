Scum who sit high, emanating bullshit
Empty vessels look up waiting to be sated.

With a callous disregard of human life
It grinds us up like meat.

Filled to the brim, going of like warheads
Exploding in hate, create our own extinction

With a callous disregard of human life
It grinds us up like meat.

With no foundation, no fools to hold high
Those who controlled us alongside us shall grind

Cheat us of a chance used up and spat out
Obeying scumbags
Playing with our lives
