False truth hidden behind closed doors
Obvious act of deceit to those you have hurt
Horrid reality, the anger was born
Now stand and make ready, swine you will burn
I warned you not to and you didn't listen
Now prepare yourself for the violent reaction
Heart was destroyed on that awful night
As the worms indulged in their carnal delight

I damn you with my anger
My fists will beat you both
Smiling as you defiled my being,
(I guess) a beatings not enough
Feeble excuse was given, split wide open
While the vermin swarmed
Drunken friendship was broken

Blind to the fact of the pain you were causing
Cause and effect, accept your beating
The victor stands over the vanquished bleeding
One truth, and hate that my anger is feeding
Sickened to death now your form lays pulped
As sheep to the slaughter line up and come
The cold grip reality, white blinding rage
If hell is a word then much more you'll face

I damn you with my anger
My fists will beat you both
Smiling as you defiled my being,
(I guess) a beatings not enough
Feeble excuse was given, split wide open
While the vermin swarmed
Drunken friendship was broken

For the birthing of my anger
ENGTRUSTED WITH DISGUST
You heartless fucking piece of shit
ENGTRUSTED WITH DISGUST
The whorish fucking slug I loved
ENGTRUSTED WITH DISGUST
Killing you is not an option
IT'S A FUCKING MUST

I hate you
I despise your fucking form
My anger grows, my fury flows
This will constitute my norm

The heartless maggot with the ignoble mind
ENGTRUSTED WITH DISGUST
Damned unforgivable union
ENGTRUSTED WITH DISGUST
I wept tears you disgusting fuck
ENGTRUSTED WITH DISGUST
Your friendship and love was a fucking lie
ENGTRUSTED WITH DISGUST

I hate you
I despise your fucking form
My anger grows, my fury flows
This will constitute my norm

Friendship is dead now , writhe in hell
Now I sleep, all is well.
