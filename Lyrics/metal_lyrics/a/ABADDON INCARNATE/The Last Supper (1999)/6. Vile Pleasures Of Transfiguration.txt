Mortals die for search of knowledge
Ancient wisdom spell's of changing

Call on astaroth send to us messengers
Minions of unholyness join us with the nothingness

Behold Orgy Of Bestial frenzy

Destroy my mortal form with forbidden words I call you forth

Transform servants to essence of Chaos
We all exist as one with new found pleasures
Flesh crawls taught grows mind goes to world beyond
Ecstasy transcend to death skin part shared It never ends
