Shadow culture arise a call to arms
The time of burning has come
Armed with bombs and hatred
A new holocaust of Christians has come

Balors one eye is watching us
Our hearts grow cold to all life
The hour for devastation of humanity
Is ours in which to rise and burn

Wrath of the black wraiths
Force of hate devastate
Goat cults rise to strike!

Building a Dark Age. Burning the old age
Architect soldiers. Armed with malice and bullets
On into final war. Burning human scum
Nuclear fires rage
Nothing will stop us from burning these fuckers

Reaffirming our stranglehold on humanity
Our webs grow even tighter
A intricate design of a web of laws
To choke you ugly things
We are more beautiful and brighter than your God
You are small and ugly. We detest your weakness
We will obliterate your ugly race
And the devour your God

Holy repulsive humans
We wash your filth in atom fires
Born of hate we will kill you
The ancient signals reaffirmed
Death is our king he is back
666 destroyer of man
5 billion worms dead at fast
The beast awake man is dead
My hopes are done. I weep with euphoric joy
