You names yourself "The Black Pope"
Built a church in Satan's name
Dressed your flock in bestial garb
Lines your coffin with mortal currency

Sermon of mockery, from the clerical clown
Dead end messiah, its vacuum you preach

You ripped the words from red beards mouth
Then went on to bastardise DEE
There is no law of the trapezoid
And you rendered impotent the enochian keys

Sermon of mockery, from the clerical clown
Dead end messiah, its vacuum you preach

Now your corpse has voided the soul, you shall face the abyss winds
Its tendrils are as claws that shall rip you asunder
We will give you credit for one thing, but for all your vacuous lies
Extend the vamacharic influence, the emperor remains uncloathed
But your life was an ultimate dead end, in his citadel of cards
Have you become a victim of your own point?

They could say you reached internal adept
In a bankrupt old world roundabout way
But you knew nothing of immortality
Flesh and blood like everyone else

Sermon of mockery, from the clerical clown
Dead end messiah, its vacuum you preach
