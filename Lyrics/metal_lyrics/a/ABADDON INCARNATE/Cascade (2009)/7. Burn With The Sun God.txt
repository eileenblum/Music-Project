Such a force, cannot sleep long, for it will become.
subverted rage of nuclear fission, carries the sleeping ghost of wrath.
Spawning the sunlit rotting corpse boiling thirst and arid death
It came to me through a thousand dreams fragmented from the void
The amalgamation of a billion phobias, burning, yet unnameable.

We met inside the veins of quartz, running through ancient stone
Frozen and thawed throughout millenia, give manifest a Tetrahedron

It rose up from that dormant seed asleep within my heart
Lighting a lamp of shadows clothing my mind with a cloak of dark
An ancient voice of rust and dust spoke a mighty curse
My body becomes a nova, tuning the black to white heat

I am the sun, your solar dream, the source of light in the void of night,
A bringer of life or a nuclear death, a storm of fire, sun god!

Creation has rejected me in favour of a lie
I shall send a tongue of fire to cleanse the earth of life
My temples lay fallen in favour of synagogue, church and mosque
The sun god is vengeful god and shall not be forgot

Remember the cult, the cult of the sun god!
Embrace the burning, burn with the sun god!
