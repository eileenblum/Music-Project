Hysterics, of the insane
A slave lashed by the semi divine
Smashed to death with a whip

Mortal tears, of despair fuel the laughter
Of the dark immortal

Beheadings, decadent boredom
It amuses him to run his hands
Through the fountains of warm blood

Mortal tears, of despair fuel the laughter
Of the dark immortal

Thriving upon fear, feeding on the sad
The slaves shall serve the wicked, and the wicked are raving mad
Bestial incestuous rapture, surrounds himself with fear
There is sickness in the heart of the empire
...harlequin

Passing into immortality
Another tyrant ascends
The cycle goes on and on
But the hysterics never end

Mortal tears, of despair fuel the laughter
Of the dark immortal
