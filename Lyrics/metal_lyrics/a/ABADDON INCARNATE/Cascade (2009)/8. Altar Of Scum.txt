To enslave the living
An altar of death
To hold the people of the world in thrall
A choking inexorable web, immortal illusion
A pox on our minds a saviour of nothing
And a harbinger of lies

Rat like priests, pissing out lies
Upon altars of scum

Feeding on the shit of the human mind
With twisting poisonous tongues

Cult of death
Penitent guilt ridden tears
A warning of eternal death playing upon our fears
Devouring his flesh and drinking his blood
To gain atonement
They cannibalize what they defy

To enslave the living
An altar of death
TO hold the people of the world in thrall
A choking inexorable web, immortal illusion
A pox on our minds a saviour of nothing
And a harbinger of lies

Una nox dormienda
Martyred for your own guilt, it means nothing to me

Nightmares of the flesh
Of beauracratic celibates
Give rise to altar thumping dogma
Of bible bashing zealots
Condemning the living for relishing a short life
Wasting their lives away
Awaiting eternal death

To enslave the living
An altar of death
TO hold the people of the world in thrall
A choking inexorable web, immortal illusion
A pox on our minds a saviour of nothing
And a harbinger of lies

Una nox dormienda
Martyred for your own guilt, it means nothing to me
