I step down from jagged precipice
Through the breaking of the first light of day
I'm the son of the morning star, but you don't know who you are

Potent with virtues of pride, ego and bullshit
I proclaim the ways of old aeon dead and gone
I bring a new law, for you cannot govern yourselves at all

It was written in my mind by the star that never sets
The dogma of the bottomless pit
So it was written so it shall be
Swallow it!
