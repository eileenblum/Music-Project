Sorority of the wise, maids, mothers and crones
Inquisitorial sadist lords, torturing at the behest of celibates

Hanging in his dungeons, hands tied behind our backs
Humiliated, death is welcome, end our pain
Henbane vapors, traversing dark spheres
Take solace from suffering of the hanging god

Tell me do you poison the wells from which we drink?
Do you murder our children at sabbaths above in the high places?

Your mind is closed and you will never understand
What we do at our sabbaths is none of your concern
Hanging in his dungeons, hands tied behind our backs
Humiliated, death is welcome, end our pain

Sado maso, dances of the sexes, stage set for strappado
When the curtain drops, who will be left?

You make conspiracies, with your cult of women
You bring plague upon us, in the filth of leprosy

Take solace from the suffering of the hanging god
Whereas we are the hanger of gods and greater things

Your preoccupied with paranoia, your time will pass she'll breathe again
Sado maso, when the curtain drops, who will be left?
