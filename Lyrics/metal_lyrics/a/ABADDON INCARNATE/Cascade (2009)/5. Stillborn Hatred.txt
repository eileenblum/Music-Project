Infected by another, my hatred is awoken
It's our immortal struggle, that I am bound to make you suffer

I'll change your joys into anguish, I'll turn your heart to dust
I'll fill your lungs with scalding air, stillborn hatred

I point across the ninth wave, with my outstretched finger
With hatred in my ambition, to turn your womb into a tomb

I'll change your joys into anguish, I'll turn your heart to dust
I'll fill your lungs with scalding air, stillborn hatred

In a hovel in the sinister land, you nurse your babe to be
Accursed larvae, I liquidate within thee.....

Infected by another, my hatred is awoken
It's our immortal struggle, that I am bound to make you suffer

I'll change your joys into anguish, I'll turn your heart to dust
I'll fill your lungs with scalding air, stillborn hatred

All your joys, hopes and dreams shall become unto oblivion
potential years of happiness taken from you via sorcery
I make poisons, I make death, I breathe hatred in the winds...

Inhale...

I spasm in ecstasy as the rot within you dissolves
Now my work is done, I retire in satisfaction
May you remain barren for all time to come
I expect creativity, in your riposte
You could be creative, behind that mask of idiocy

I'll change your joys into anguish, I'll turn your heart to dust
I'll fill your lungs with scalding air, stillborn hatred

Potential years of happiness taken from you via sorcery
Stillborn...
