Barbed wire ascendancy
Foaming mouthed barbarity
The only way to get out alive
Is to be the focused killer

Flesh torn and ripped, enemy psychotic
Hell bound soldier, kill or be killed

The claw of the violent God of War
Thirsts for corpses in the snow
Reaching out amongst the barbed wire
Frozen mud stained black with blood

Flesh torn and ripped, enemy psychotic
Hell bound soldier, kill or be killed

Eight million souls to sate his thirst
Morbid moonlight photographs the carnage
Have I become just a ghost wandering?
These desolate killing fields

Flesh torn and ripped, enemy psychotic
Hell bound soldier, kill or be killed
