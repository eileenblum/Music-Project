I am like a walking plague, vomiting poxy death
Sent forth from the eschatolon, to bring a sickly end

Pestilence incarnate, disease ridden carrier
Trojan virus, harbinger of pandemia

I take it upon myself, to become the first henchman
Hippos, melios, the black horse

I carry the scales, weighing out the bacterium
Famine, drought, disease

Chosen by ego, sent forth by my passion
Death is my sceptre, hatred my angel
I drink from the test tubes, the liquid appolyon
I'll go amongst the detritus, spreading the disease

Spread the disease, by holy mandate
Toxic priest, wrath of plague
Summon forth the breath of death
The whisper of pandemia
Listen, harken and remember!

Upon rotting stead descend through the burning dawn
I smile upon mankind, with stinking decaying teeth

I exhale vomitous mist, the miasma of disease
My nature is apocalyptic, I am...
Pandemic by nature!

Chosen by ego, sent forth by my passion
Death is my sceptre, hatred my angel
I drink from the test tubes, the liquid appolyon
I'll go amongst the detritus, spreading the disease

Spread the disease, by holy mandate
Toxic priest, wrath of plague

We hail the lady of the sewer, who lies down in her black filth
Drunk with excrement of a million sub humans

Who divides with oil waters
Green banks scum encrusted
With the detritus of the undead
And the mindless and the pointless

Exterminate - pandemic by nature
Exterminate - pandemic by nature
