I am winter mute, freezing in Janet's Foss
I made an oath to indominate horrors
Kabeiri
Take my mind away, from the wares of detritus
Up these stone steps, back to the black scar

Perish ambition! A weakness had a grip on me
With platinum claws, a rancid poison

Avenues to immortality, blocked by sentinels
Demonical phantasms of self mistrust

Perish pessimism! There are no claws, my will is sound
The poison is impotent and yes is the answer to everything

Avenues to immortality, blocked by sentinels
Demonical phantasms of self mistrust

In the presence of namtosuelta
She menstruates in the stream, her skin smooth like porcelain
Sign your name, in your own blood

With kabeiri, the watcher at the threshold
Sign your name in your own blood
This lunar contract binds all territories

Retrospective arrogance, how frail I was
Chase the moon across the sky, in pursuit of lunacy
