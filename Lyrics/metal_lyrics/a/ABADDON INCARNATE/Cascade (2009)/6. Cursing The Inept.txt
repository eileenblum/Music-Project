Futile climb to a dead ambition
Empty hollow aspiration
Starry visioned apprentice to nothing
Up the frozen steps to ruination
Yearning to be dead on the other side

Calling the bastard names of illusions
Crying out for kind of infinity
No-one is minding the steps of your pathway
No-one cares where your path may lead
Yearning to be dead on the other side

Falling apart at the seams, the universe is ending
Day by day it spirals to somewhere that will never be
All my infinite ambitions laid out for ridicule
Yet those who ridicule have no future either

Aghast stairways, pathways unto certain oblivion
Let me rest here and think who is responsible for this farce?
Who is this cruel creator
Who grants me capacity to reason and think?
All that is immortal is dead, all that remains is bestial

At the end of all known pathways
Is the final certainty of death
All roads lead to certain hell
No salvation

Falling apart at the seams, the universe is ending
Day by day it spirals to somewhere that will never be
All my infinite ambitions laid out for ridicule
Yet those who ridicule have no future either
