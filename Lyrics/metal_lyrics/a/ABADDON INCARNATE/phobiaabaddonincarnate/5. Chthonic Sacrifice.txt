[performed by Abaddon Incarnate]Enter the living god, beneath emerald forest the Mother earth
Enter subterranean hell, where executioner awaits his prey
Thirsting for blood of the chosen to die,
Macho priest disguises sexuality
Hiding his madness behind his mask of religion
Chthonic grave for the sacrificed slaves
Earthquake, solar eclipse, But the bloodthirsty priest keeps hacking off heads
Tidal wave, drought and disease, Build more pyramids to the homicidal gods
Agony of faith, apostle of pain
Die to satisfy perverted lust for death
Into the cold waters we offer the corpse
Glass exhumes still beating hearts
Naked corpse turns pale in death
Spectre of the angels of the underworld
Ignite their bloodlust with the ripping of flesh
And the breaking of bones, with hammers of stone

Arcane words, scrapped into fleshless skull
Auto script, words take on a life of their own
To memorize the death the agony here
Look to the stars, mathematics of sacrifice
Ancient cult of blood and sacrifice,
Has no place amongst the civilised
But the priest keeps hacking off heads
..... With his glass knife
