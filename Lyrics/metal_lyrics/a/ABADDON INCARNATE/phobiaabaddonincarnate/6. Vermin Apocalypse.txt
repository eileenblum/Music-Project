[performed by Abaddon Incarnate]From the saline depths of Issyk kull,
Parasites they carry to us, a gift to our filthy unwashed ways

Vermin apocalypse parasitic death, mass despair, terror, unseen killer

Hear ye! Bring out your dead,
The plague doctor's futile attempts to heal them have failed

Cursed is cursed was and cursed will be,
Damn to world and it's sick to hell, that is my decree

Rotting corpses fill the gutter, morbid shadow haunts my days
Cursed of this pox disease, vermin apocalypse.

Dead children, cling to dead mothers breast,
Drunken fathers in despair commit suicide
Plague Doctors, hide behind, bestial masques,
Their magic is obsolete in the face of this pestilence

Rotting corpses fill the gutter, morbid shadow haunts my days
Cursed of this pox disease, vermin apocalypse.
