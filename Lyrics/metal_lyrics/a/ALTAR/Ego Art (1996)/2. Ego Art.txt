I look around and see my place
My role towards humanity
I deny to be a part
Of a functional society
Won't contribute and play the whore
To your christian ways to stand for

SET - FREE - EGO - ART
I rule my life
Obey my soul
I am my god
And take control

Convinced of myself - Just think of me
No doubt - Creativity
Intellect - Competition
Mental towards

Convinced myself - Supremacy
My force above religion
Cynical justification
Hostile towards

You never wanted but you got me anyway
You have tried to turn me
To your pathetic play
But now I finish you. You are just a shade
You're already dead
And I'm digging your grave
