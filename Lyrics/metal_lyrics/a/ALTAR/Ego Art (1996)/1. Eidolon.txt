I Take

I am spoiled , I'm raised in wealth
I've learned to care just for myself
I don't take time to wait for things
I please myself with what's interesting

'Cause I'm born in this country
I've had no choice I'm surrounded
By fools who love their money and have
The time to mourn about the life of others
They sit back and wait too stupid
To see that...

I take what I want
I take it now

I'm a product, raised by a law
That learns to speak with no meaning at all
Don't spend much time on useless goals
I enjoy myself. Don't sell my soul

'Cause I'm born in this country
I've had no choice I'm surrounded
By fools who love to stab backs
And think they have to right
To judge the life of others
Then they meet me too stupid to see that

I take what I want
I take it now

I take my pleasures and I know how to use I take
The flesh to satisfy my needs
I know what I want. I don't refuse
