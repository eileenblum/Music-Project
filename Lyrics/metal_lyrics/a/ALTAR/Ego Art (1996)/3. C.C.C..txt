Driving on bastard road
Too much shit in my veins
Has polluted my brains

Walking my way home
This terrible night
Will end in a fight

I don't need excuses
My patience has expired
This time it's for real
I'm getting sick and tired

Going the wrong direction
It's my way to choose
What have I got to lose

Anger needs a way out
Too much hate in my veins
Has polluted my brains

Let's drive!!
Then it happens all at once
Just when I thought that it was allright
To break the rules of normal life
And kill the silence of this night
I feel the urge to walk away
But my pride says stay

Christian Cop Convicted
My law has been broken
I will walk my way
Fuck your law and order
You misuse your power
Fuck your law and order
I pity your frustration
You think you're always right
Fuck your christian orders

Perhaps I'm too concerned
About my will to be free
Maybe I should listen
But then I'm still concerned

Who will feed the mouths of your family when
You're unemployed. No more job for you cop!!
