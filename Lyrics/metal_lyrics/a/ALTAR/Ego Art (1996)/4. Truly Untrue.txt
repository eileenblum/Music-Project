Hate is what I feel. I hear you talk to me
I have no interest in what you say to me
What you talk about is nothing new to me
Don't you understand you are my enemy

You say - You're true - What does it mean?
An image - It seems - To me - How does it feel?
I'm wrong - You're right - What do you mean?
Uphold your dream - To me - It isn't real

If you are the problem
Why don't you kill yourself
True or not true - True or not true

Satanic, False, Christian, Belief, Religion,
Right, Relief Useless information

You paint your head like you are dead
You wear the cross inside your head
But still you feel the pain of me

You build a church to worship him
You sacrifice. A ritual
The pain remains
