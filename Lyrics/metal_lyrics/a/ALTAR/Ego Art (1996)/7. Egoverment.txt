You've been kicked on this world
The naked truth of a big mistake
Another part of this family
A gift from god what a fake

Why call them parents?
They don't give a fuck
Why call them teachers?
They failed the test of life
Why call them brothers?
There is no equality
Why call them preachers?
Their message doesn't work

You're a victim of authority
A generation of stupidity
Unless your ego feels supreme
Above this pool of foolishness

Fight the ones on your way
Trample down their emptiness
Place your boots inside a face
Get'em down before they use

Do not bend - egoist
Challenge it - egoist

Weak or strong - You stand alone
Blessed are you 'cause you're alone

Break away - egoist
But not accept - egoist

Destroy them ! !
