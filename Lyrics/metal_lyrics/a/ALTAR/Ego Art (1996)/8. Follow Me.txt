Without feeling guilty they misuse you
It doesn't make sense, the things you do
Your mind begins to separate
From feeling sane
You feel no difference
Between pleasure and pain

Insecurity you would leave behind
Their hollow lies made you blind
Charming words you can't resist
They preached love you'd always missed

"Come my friend and follow me
I'll be there when you need me
I know god, I am his son
They call me the chosen one"

"Bow my child, before me
Swallow my hypocrisy
If I am god, you are my son
Don't tell them I'm the horned one"
