Stop your bullshit
I will never be your friend
Stop convincing me
Why don't you understand
That you are an asshole without hope
That you belong at the end of a rope
That your saviour means shit to me
That I won't be a part of your slavery
Fuck your God
Fuck your life
Fuck your church
And then your wife
Stop complaining
About my attitude
Stop believing
That I am in the mood
To take your blabla serious
'Bout some who died on a cross
To be totally fuckin' positive
Be a dull and boring conservative
Fuck your book
Fuck your smile
Fuck your rule
Fuck your luck
Think of it - Asshole
That I'm sick of it - Asshole
