Mother tell your children
Not to follow my example
I am from a generation who's
Got the X factor in it's head
Get your phone, dial the number
One hundred six six six
Then ask for the biggest fuck
Of generation X
An amazing discovery
For the twenty fifth century
To dig up the remains
Of another sick society
Everyone knows we're to blame
Of crimes against this planet
We deny this mass attack
But everyone has done it
We all cheat - We all lie
We will try - To survive
We all are - We all be
We will die - When we don't see
We as individuals
Can never stop this process
Multinationals nowadays
Make it seem so useless
Stare at the empty faces
Makes me sometimes wonder why
You take too much healthy space
Two third of the human race
No responsibility
Not any functionality
Zero credibility
A menace to society
