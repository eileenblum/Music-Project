I still remember you
And what you wanted too
So many years ahead
The world belonged to you
I still believe in you
And what you want to do
The things you left behind
The stupid fool in you
I thought you were a friend
Till it all would end
We stood together as one
An anti-christian stand
Now it's all over &amp; done
With me &amp; my old band
Since you met that bitch
Walk along the easy way
Follow trends &amp; family
Convenience is the course
Christianity at it's worse
What I still don't understand
Which or what you really meant
Was it what we could create
Or the way of life we used to hate
You are asshole of the day
Fuck your trends &amp; family
Your path of convenience
Fuck your christian obedience
Now, Every now &amp; then I remember who
But then I think about
Things you have to do
On your knees for God and his family
Then I realize I never want to be
