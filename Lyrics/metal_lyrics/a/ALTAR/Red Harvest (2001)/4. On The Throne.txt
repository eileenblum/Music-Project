I'm not curious anymore
Now I am for sure
I took the left hand path,
Towards a mental shore
Destiny is at my feet
I dive into a sea
Waves are uplifting me
Feel everlasting free
Christians deep down below,
Wipe each other out
Satanic victory waves are
Rolling proud
I step into my boat
That floats on evil gold
Carry an illegal load
Of stories yet untold
I see purity - I see poverty
I smell misery - Of the holy
It sinks into a bottomless pit
Together with the other shit
I ban unto a lasting stream
Mankind calls the christian dream
The throne of fire still belongs to me
From whereout I can see
My revenge has worked out fine
The great indulgence now is mine
The waves of fire take their wrath
Encouraged by my satanic breath
Bloody sharks take their bait
Hungered by religious hate
