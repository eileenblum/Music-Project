Many boots are trambling down
The harvest of this year
With arrogance these men destroy
They seem without a care
Children crying, People dying
Environment's a waste
A storm will rise, nature shows
The fields are filled with hate
The end of days has come
We will all be slaughtered
Nature takes it's toll
What's never been restored
Troops prepare to fight against
An unknown enemy
For now there is no place for
Individuality
On this cold and cloudy day
The autumn leaves it's trace
Destruction soon will take control
Of the entire human race
Apocalypse is near
The earth has lost it's patience
Based upon a lie
Of a thousand generations
So now, take a good look at him
The one who always has been here
The man who always has been at
Our side
Now tells us we deserve to die
