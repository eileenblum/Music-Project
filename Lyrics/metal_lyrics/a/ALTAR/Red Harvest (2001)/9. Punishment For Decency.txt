What are you afraid of
When do you want to make a stand
You fear God will reject you
Of entering the promised land
You are weak, fear the open road
You can only be the one you've
Been told
You're too scared to speak for
Yourself
That everyone denies you is
Your own bloody fault
Weakling, softling,
Better hide in fear
Tonight is the last of the
Rest of your career
Evil has told me to take your
Last breath
I kill all the people before
They bore to death
I look at the icy sea
A million eyes see me
Forever trapped in silence
Locked eternally
The punishment that waits for those
Who belong to me
You are now in my realm
I rule this frozen sea
I entertain all fools
Reign eternally
Don't close your eyes
Don't fall asleep
There is no escape
You're in too deep
So you'd better think again
Get a life while you can
I'm hungry for your soul
To leave it there in the cold
