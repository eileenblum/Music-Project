Why don't you follow me
Up on this hill
See if you know
This thing I see.....Called pain
You've heard this shit before
The risk is up to you
You've seen this man before
He'll break the bones in you
I'm screaming, You're begging
Start crying and gasping
You realize this the last time
You can play the act
Scares the shit out of you,
Cause you are close to your death
Pain - More intense than you think - Pain
Pain - You will never last - The Pain
Pain - Hear the hammering - Pain
Pain - The iron in your flesh - Means Pain
I'm screaming, You're begging
Start crying and gasping
This time your daddy won't be here
To save this situation
In all those years he has lost
Faith in his son
Your life is one big mess
The test is up to you
It seems the world cares less
They lost their faith in you
Don't you listen to me
I'm your biggest mistake
Betray yourself and me
Judas is my name
