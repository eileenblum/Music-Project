Holy ritual rape
Blessed with the soul of a god
Lustful demon's sperm
Shoots the virginal flesh
Holy infant born
To restore the house of god
To spread lies
And give false hope to a hungry crowd

His only son - An infiltration

Your slaves will be dethroned by reality
No hope left for Christianity

The lack of interest in your religion
I fill in with my aggression

Jesus is dead, but we live on
Jesus is dead, but we live on
Jesus is dead, but we live on

What's the meaning to the fake mankind
This carnal madness you've left behind
Powerless priest what do you search
To worship god with endless dirge

Holy ritual rape
Blessed with the soul of a god
Lustful demon's sperm
Shoots the virginal flesh
Holy infant born
To restore the house of god
To spread lies
And give false hope to a hungry crowd

Do not weep for me but for you and your children
Father forgive them for they know not what they do

Your slaves will be dethroned by reality
No hope left for Christianity

The lack of interest in your religion
I fill in with my aggression

Jesus is dead, but we live on
Jesus is dead, but we live on
DEAD!
