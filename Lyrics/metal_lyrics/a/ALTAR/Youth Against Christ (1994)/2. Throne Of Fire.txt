Tortured by your curiosity
You took another destiny
The screams you'd heard were awful real
Like they suffered a life of insanity
You smelled the pain of distorted desire
And took the path towards the lake of fire

Your useless life slips away
Pass your soul right on to me
Today I'll make a final stand
Your future becomes my history

The throne of fire now belongs to me!!!

When the apocalypse has arrived
The seven lords will be released
To judge the world by his deeds
And kill the ones who have forsaken me

Ruler of God I than shall be
Because his holy ghost has embittered me
As the son of Satan I mock the dead
And offer their souls to take revenge
To take revenge

The throne of fire now belongs to me!!!

Your useless life slips away
Pass your soul right on to me
Today I'll make a final stand
Your future becomes my history

The throne of fire now belongs to me!!!

Ruler of God I than shall be
Because his holy ghost has embittered me
As the son of Satan I mock the dead
And offer their souls to take revenge
To take revenge

No warning signs
Just human waste
The stench of death
Surrounds me

Satan's wrath
In yellow blaze
A grip of evil
Sounds from below
