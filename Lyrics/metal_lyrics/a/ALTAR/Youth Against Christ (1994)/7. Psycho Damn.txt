The day I was born
No troubles at all
Living on this world
Never thought to fall
Human life problems
I saw around me
Then my life changed
And I had to see
My eyes sunken in
Pollution of the brain
The day I will die
There'll be nothing to remain

Psycho damnation - You see the people thinking
Now's the time - To see me here screaming
They think I'm mad - Want to see me bleed
Until the time - My psycho problem dies

Brain pollution
Exploded visions
No relation
Intimidation

Other direction - You see the people thinking
Now's the time - To see me here screaming
They think I'm mad - Want to see me bleed
Until the time - My psycho problem dies

The day I was born no problems at all
Living on this world never thought to fall
Human life problems I saw around me
Then my life changed and I had to see
My eyes sunken in pollution of the brain
The day I will die there'll be nothing to remain

Psycho damn
Psycho damn, damnation
Psycho damn, damnation

Psycho damnation - You see the people thinking
Now's the time - To see me here screaming
They think I'm mad - Want to see me bleed
Until the time - My psycho problem dies

Psycho damnation - You see the people thinking
Now's the time - To see me here screaming
They think I'm mad - Want to see me bleed
Until the time - My psycho problem dies

Brain pollution
Exploded visions
No relation
Intimidation
