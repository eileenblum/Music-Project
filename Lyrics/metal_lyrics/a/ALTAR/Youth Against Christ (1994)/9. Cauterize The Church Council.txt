Aggression for life that you must live today
For every disappointment you will have to pay
Indoctrination it's the only way
The meaning of life you obey
You are trapped in this reign of terror
Face your reality that is what you fight for

Cauterise the church council
Burn their flesh in agony
Hear their souls scream in pain

Aggression for life that you must life today
For every disappointment you will have to pay
Indoctrination it's the only way
The meaning of life you obey
You are trapped in this reign of terror
Face your reality that is what you fight for
Hypocrite bastards rotten to the core
Obtain your success when you want more

Cauterise the church council
Burn their flesh in agony
Hear their souls scream in pain

Aggression for life that you must life today
For every disappointment you will have to pay
Indoctrination it's the only way
The meaning of life you obey
You are trapped in this reign of terror
Face your reality that is what you fight for
Hypocrite bastards rotten to the core
Obtain your success when you want more

Christian motherfucker

Put their heads on a stake
Release the skin from their bodies
Speak the words of evil minds
Of a burning life in misery
Feed them with the seeds of hate
Let them hear your blasphemy
Blasphemy

Aggression for life that you must life today
Another disappointment you will have to pay
Indoctrination it's the only way
The meaning of life you obey
You are trapped in this reign of terror
Face your reality that is what you fight for
Hypocrite bastards rotten to the core
Obtain your success when you want more
Don't fuck with my life let it be
My evil shall rise you will see
