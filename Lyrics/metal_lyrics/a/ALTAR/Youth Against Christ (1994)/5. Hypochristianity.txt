So god, of the rich and right
Stand up to face before me
So god, of weak and poor
Just dare to stand before me
So god, of an honest life
Show me that you can be
So god, of peace and love
Why don't you come and fuck me

Hypocrisy Of The Church - Hypochristianity
Hypocrisy Of The Church - Hypochristianity
Hypocrisy Of The Church - Hypochristianity

I am a stranger in your land
A monster you don't understand
You fear the possibility
That I confess your forgery

You try to set me at your hand
Await the day I will repent
I am the one you cannot form
Into your lies you call a norm

So god, of the rich and right
Stand up to face before me
So god, of weak and poor
Just dare to stand before me
So god, of an honest life
Show me that you can be
So god, of peace and love
Why don't you come and fuck me

Hypocrisy Of The Church - Hypochristianity
Hypocrisy Of The Church - Hypochristianity
Hypocrisy Of The Church - Hypochristianity

Money, greed and power - They form your trinity
You worship a god of money - To satisfy your greed
But on your knees for me - To earn the spirit of power

My whole life I had to live
Embittered by your falsity
Your image of hypocrisy
Has put a lot of hate in me

I want to kill your image of hypocrisy
Kill your image of hypocrisy
I want to kill your image of hypocrisy
Kill your image of hypocrisy
