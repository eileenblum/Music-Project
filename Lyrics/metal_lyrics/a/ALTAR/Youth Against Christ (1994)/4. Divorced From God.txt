Divorced from god

You are 21 and found the only son
No longer wild, now you want a child
Afraid of your insecurity
You want to be a family
In the church you promise him
To love eternally
What a happy life you live
What more has Jesus Christ to give!

You have been infected by religious rules
You are no longer free to choose
The perfect girl in the eyes of society
An example of how they want you to be

The regrets come mostly after a year
This boring life becomes your fear
Your only one has sex with some one else
Your child a victim of this hell

Frustration of stagnation
Divorced from god

Satan, creeps in your mind
Satan, the tempter
Satan
Satan
Satan
Satan, want your bitch
Satan, your flesh gets weak
Satan
Satan

You are 21 and found the only son
No longer wild, now you want a child
Afraid of your insecurity
You want to be a family
In the church you promise him
To love eternally
What a happy life you live
What more has Jesus Christ to give!

You have been infected by religious rules
You are no longer free to choose
The perfect girl in the eyes of society
One example of how they want you to be

Divorced for almost a year
And now you all see it clear
You dream of Christianity
But always wake up in reality

Frustration of stagnation
Divorced from god
