[Spoken by a TV-preacher dude:]
"If you don't change your way to refusing to acknowledge the grace and the
mercy and the love of Jesus Christ
That's what has already damned your soul unless you decide to make a change
in your eternal hellish destination
Either you think that by sharp catechism you somehow foam your nose at god,
you shake your fist in the face of the almighty
I want you to know what he searched on the circle of the years you can't
touch that"
