Deathsquads leaving
Without mercy
People are dying
For fidelity

Senseless destroying
Without premonition
Ready to kill
The other population

Endless fighting
Without a way
To release them from
This horrible decay

Unalarmed we aren't
When the master speaks his word
Certitude available
When luscious speeches are told

Immortal no one is
Impossible doesn't exist
Oppression nothing learnt
From enslavement in days before

Unalarmed we aren't
When the master speaks his word
Certitude available
When luscious speeches are told

Immortal no one is
Impossible doesn't exist
Oppression nothing learnt
From enslavement in days before

Come on you Christian motherfuckers

We must take a look
To our inner self
Our personality
Left to rot in Hell

We must take a look
To our inner self
Our personality
Left to rot in Hell

We must take a look
To our inner self
Our personality
Left to rot in Hell
