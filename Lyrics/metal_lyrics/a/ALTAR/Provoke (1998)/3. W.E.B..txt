I listen good 'cause you're superior
I have competed and now completed
This is my future, this is my score
Take my life from the book
Like they've done before

You are the choice, you give the tools
And I'll pass the line with success
Prepare me for the big life I obey the rules
I thank god on my knees I can go to school

I suddenly experienced this wasn't right for me
To practice what you preach for the rest of my days
To walk along the path that you've set out for me

Conformation or self contained
Be a part in don't care at all
Educated, indoctrinated
The more you told me the more I hated

Finally I realized this system wasn't right for me
I could never take for granted all the bullshit
When you talked to me
Now I see the difference between you and me

Confrontation of self regard
The danger of intelligence
Wavering institution
You prepared me for insurrection

You should be ashamed of yourself
To create this perfect image
Of a world that's one big trap
To come up with a great illusion

You're the teacher
Of our future
Must we take over
What you did wrong

You should better ask yourself
Why there is no use
In forming an enormous gap
Between problems and their solutions
