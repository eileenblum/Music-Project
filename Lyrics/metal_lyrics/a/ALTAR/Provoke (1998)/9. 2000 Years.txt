I am aware that I will die
When the moment's right for me
I know it's unavoidable
I want to take it gracefully

Never known
Never seen
Always there
In between

But before the lights go out
I return to the ground
I want to seek all the joy
Pleasures in life to be found

There are things I can't predict
In where I have no control
Or sometimes I hurt myself
And I'm full responsible

But before the lights go out
I return to the ground
I want to try and take it all
Misuse, abuse in large amounds

Two thousand years ago
Some one died
Two thousand years from now
Some one dies
