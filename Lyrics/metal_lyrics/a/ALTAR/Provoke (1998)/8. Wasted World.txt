We've been chosen planet earth for us to live
And what do we do, we tear the the place apart
Whelmed in darkness our world begins to fade
There's one conclusion, we have no second chance

Another scandal, a large amount of poisoned ground
Found in districts, where we live and stay
No one noticed, 'till kids came home and showed their skin
Wounds are gasping, and pus is running out

No response - They won't take the blame
Undissolved - Just more lies
Unexplained - They don't answer you
Breath the air - You'll slowly die

We're so selfish think we've the only right to live
It's our future so please don't mess around
Just continue and there is nothing more to give
Another lifetime, we don't stand a chance

It's so much depressing
Sitting up the hill
And see our nature dies
How our land was in the past
Remains us in our thoughts
And memories tell no lies
