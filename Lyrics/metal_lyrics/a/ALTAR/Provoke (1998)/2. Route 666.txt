Please step in, let's take a ride
Don't hesitate cause we're out of time
Get in my black tank, don't fear my mood
I'm a well known guy in this neighbourhood

Not a minute on this road
They stalk behind my back
But grandpa doesn't see
That he's in front of me

Now let me drive fast
I want to be free
But there is the radar
That takes my money

Welcome on route six six six
Let's hate each other and have some fun
Welcome to this fucked up world
The road movie that has just begun
