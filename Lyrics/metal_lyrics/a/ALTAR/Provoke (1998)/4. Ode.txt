Let the feast begin
Come and sing with me
Raise the glasses high
To our victory

This is the perfect day
I see that we're complete
Let us celebrate
Answer lust and greed

We share the same mentality
The order of damned souls
Enjoy our mass brutality
We know what's our goal

Tonight we do not care
About the ones who didn't know
About the ones who are not here
About the fools who live below

Indulge our glory
Proudly we stand
Indulge our glory
Of the left hand

Now gather around
To dispose our sins
On ceremonial ground
Let the storm being

This song is an ode
To twenty years pleasure
To where I belong
That twenty years of metal
Made me strong
