Destruction guides us everywhere
Total chaos rules
Rape and violence we don't care
Man still makes wrong moves

Mass frustration
our daily news
Divides the nation
moral madness brews

Disorder spreads all over us
in horrifying forms
Murder, psycho sick abuse
became our standard norms

I praise myself I don't see things this way
I don't share this new born doom-scenario
It creates a new breed of Christian reformers
But they will sow the new seeds of hate

Soon society must live the rules they will maken
Will repression form another hate-scenario
It creates a new breed of Christian reformers
But they will sow the new seeds of hate

I tell you two third of the hate in this
world is to blame on you
So don't be surprised half the world
runs all over you

I don't need you
