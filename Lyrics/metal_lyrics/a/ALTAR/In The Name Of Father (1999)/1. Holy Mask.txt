A perfect member of society
That is what you want us to believe
They say a Christian celebrity
There's nothing wrong - in your own conceit

Rely on trust
Calvinist
Deny your lust
Calvinist

You say God is everywhere, he sees from above
and at the end he will judge us all
He has given you the light, you represent
The force that hides us from the fall
But you're on the edge, you stumble yourself
Satan has got you by the balls
So you push yourself, and he will forgive
when you make the final call

It is not the God himself
who should be ashamed
Stupid Christian motherfucker
you're the one to blame

You can't always hide, behind your holy mask
The day has come to speak the truth
You children will grow old, and won't be afraid
to tell about their distorted youth
