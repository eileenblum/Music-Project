From the beginning, man walked the earth
Followed needs instinctly
Searching food, he created ways
to fight his biggest enemy
His fear of death, made him skilled
to hunt down a perfect prey
for centuries, millenniums
man survived until this day

But now - it has to change
man has found - better ways
To indulge - his basic needs
and keep the human race alive
The only animal allowed to kill
is the beast that man - has inside

Two centuries, of industry
made man think differently
To kill for living, the search for flesh
stood for immorality
And so he believed, the instinct died
The hunt became inferior
certain groups criticize
In every man's a carnivore

Kill the species - that dominate
Kill the hunter - and it's too late

Due to man's mistakes nature lost it's balance
Our environment needs an interference
