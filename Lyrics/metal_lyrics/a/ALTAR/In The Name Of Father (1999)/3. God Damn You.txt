You asked for it - you've done it again
You made me loose my control
You miserable piece of shit
You act is unbelievable
Your termination will now begin
The last thing you'll see is a satisfied grin

Why the hell you never learn
I'm way beyond to make a turn
Your stupid enough to leave a trace
I'll ram my fists into your face

It's on you - God damn you
I mean you - God damn you

A big disgrace for the human race
Who needs losers like you
You irritating motherfucker
There's one thing left to do
Your termination will now begin
The last thing you'll see is a satisfied grin
