He is the one who gave me life
because of him I walk this earth
He is the one who's in my blood
because of him I know it's worth
He is the one who fought for me
so I can live in liberty
He is the one I think was right
In the name of Him I feel this might

Brought up in a home ready for this generation
Told to be suspicious 'bout the human life
The individual against the rest of the nation
Raised by a man with freedom in his eyes

In the name of the Father - I must resist
In the name of the Father - Retaliate
In the name of the Father - I clench my fist
In the name of the Father - I am

Others draw a line of fear and frustration
afraid to ask themselves 'bout the reason why
I'll always be apart from the rest of the nation
I'm raised by a man with freedom in his eyes
