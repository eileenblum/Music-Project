We're ready to go, we have a bond
to discover all the unknown realms
We don't care, we'll take it all
We go where others would not dare

There'll be a time, when we will count
We matter in our own world
All for one &amp; one for all
Our friendship cannot be hurt

Now we have the courage
to rise on the wings
For victory
we crown ourselves kings

We challenge your power, challenge your faith
We'll rise up to stand for our own
We shout to release the gods of hate
Tomorrow you'll never know

We'll come we'll see we'll conquer you all
We'll come we'll see and make you fall
We'll come we'll see we'll conquer you all
We'll come we'll see and make you fall

In our dominion
we'll rise on the wings
In our dominion
we crown ourselves kings
