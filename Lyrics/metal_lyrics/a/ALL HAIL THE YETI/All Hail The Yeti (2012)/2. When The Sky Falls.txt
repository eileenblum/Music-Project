This day will forever change my life
I was lost deep inside my sorrow
Thinking this part of me was gone forever
So much of my heart given only to be taken
I built a shield to protect what was left and no one deserved what I have to give

Then one evening was it summer or was it fall
Both seasons crashing like waves
Sea sick would not come on this day
No sea sick would not come on this day.

Whiskey and children and terrible sounds

Hey you
Whatâs that touch when you pass me by
Little Girl
Just one look and I made you mine

You take the light right from the sky
Just like the sunset pouring from your eyes

Darkness turned the day into night
Now my instinct my nocturnal hunt
This music pollutes my ears
One more drink down its my time to act
Like predator to prey I get what I want

I wanna take you, take your soul
There will be no ransom note
Abduct this angel from heaven
Will that send me straight to hell
Then burn my body down

You spoke
Spoke your name perfectly
Telling me
That youâd follow me back,..over the sea

You sing the song,
I crave to hear
Just like an angel
Humming in my ear

All the spinning lights flashing with audio sex
This is it I thought my life has just now begun
A short tlak with few words
In my sights my eyes set for kill
I will have her if its the last thing I do

I wanna take you, take your soul
There will be no ransom note
Abduct this angel from heaven
Will that send me straight to hell
Then burn my body down

I want your lips
And your kiss I need your skin
And your touch I crave your smell
And your taste
I will have your heart
And your fuck

I wanna take you, take your soul
There will be no ransom note
Abduct this angel from heaven
Will that send me straight to hell
Then burn my body down
