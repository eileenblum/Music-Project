Pure evil inside asbestos walls
This great fire raged one hundred feet tall
Taking forty children cradled in it's flames
And two dozen women who were said to be blamed

There was a surgical stench in the air
It reaked of flesh and burning hair
You hear the cries behind every door
With screams of pain and festered sores

Save us! Save us! (Save us when darkness comes)
Save us! (Help us from the evil ones)
I hear the spirits come
After the great fire
When the children call
After the great fire
Now their spirits burn

A terror looms like thick black smoke
It haunted them when nighttime woke
Dead children bloom in the month of hate
It's all the same when you're insane

Help us! Help us! (Help us from the evil ones)
Help us! (Save us when darkness comes)
I hear the spirits come
After the great fire
When the children call
After the great fire
Inside the smoke they're born
After the great fire
When the children burn

I hear the spirits come
After the great fire
When the children call
After the great fire
Inside the smoke they're born
After the great fire
When the children burn
After the great fire
After the great fire
After the great fire

I am the devil
I am the smoke
After the great fire
I am the devil
I am the ghost
After the great fire

I am the devil
I am the smoke
After the great fire
I am the devil
I am the ghost
After the great fire

I am the devil
I am the smoke
I am the devil
I am the ghost
Envoke me!
Set me free!
