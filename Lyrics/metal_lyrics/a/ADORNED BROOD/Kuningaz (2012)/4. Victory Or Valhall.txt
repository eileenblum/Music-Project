Once upon a storm
An old man came to me
And in a twisted tongue
He told the prophecy
"A young man will arise
From the common folk
To end all tyranny"
Were the last words
He ever spoke

Yesterday we showed them mercy
This cursed day we gave our lives
Yesterday we fought for freedom
Melancholy in our eyes
Victory or Valhall
The gods will choose

Our gods stand beside us
Our gods they will guide us
Our gods fight with us
Our gods won't betray us

Now I open my eyes
And I see the blood-red sky
Look at the pain around me
This ain't what I am fighting for
My brother's eyes are empty
Melancholy in their eyes
I can barely hear them screaming
Melancholy in their eyes

Open the gate to
Welcome us all
Embrace our fate in
Odin's great hall
No one will remain
Behind the golden door
Freedom we will find
Forevermore

Victory or Valhall
We can never lose
Victory or Valhall
The gods will choose
Victory or Valhall
In the great warrior's hall
Victory or Valhall
I hear the great gods call

Open the gate to
Welcome us all
Embrace our fate in
Odin's great hall
No one will remain
Behind the golden door
Freedom we will find
Forevermore

A chill creeps through my body
And now it downs on me
How to win the battle of life
