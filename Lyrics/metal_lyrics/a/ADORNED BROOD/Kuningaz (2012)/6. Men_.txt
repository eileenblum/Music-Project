Without a doubt
Everyone knows what it's all about
Prisline a machine
No need for gears and no burning steam
So proud and loud
every whisper is deafening loud
We're men who can
What all women never understand

Be strong my son
Soon you're by my side
Be strong my son
It's time to fight

We are men
Strong as a mountain reaching to the sky
We are men
Drink from the fountain we will never die

This is the anthem
For all fathers
Make the children understand
There's a fire deep inside us
Learn to be
Be a man

We fight with might
No one's ever gonna break our stride

Stand tall one for all
Always running we will never crawl
We ride with pride
If we have to naked through the night
We're men who can
What all women never understand

Be strong my son
Soon you're by my side
Be strong my son
It's time to fight

We are men -
Strong as a mountain reaching to the sky
We are men -
Drink from the fountain we will never die

This is the anthem
For all fathers
Make your children understand
There's a fire deep inside us
Learn to be
Be a man

Without a doubt
Prisline a machine
So proud and loud
We're men who can

We fight with might
Stand tall one for all
We ride with pride
We're men who can
