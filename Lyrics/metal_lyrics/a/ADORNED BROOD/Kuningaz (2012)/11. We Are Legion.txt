We are fathers and sons
We are the children
We are going to kill our enemies
Still we fight for our gods

Don't fear this time - this time of fate

Here in the silence of battle
Far from home and you beloved
It's time to change your life
To ascend into higher spheres

We are legion - fighting together
We are legion - forever and ever
We are legion - show no remorse
We are legion - the master's force

Don't hide your fears when your god appears
The awareness of death
Brings a teardrop to the warrior's eyes
And your fathers awaiting you

Don't fear this time - this time of fate

Back to the origin
They do call me
Back to the origin
Warriors of the North

We are legion - fighting together
We are legion - forever and ever
We are legion - show no remorse
We are legion - the master's force

There do I see my father
There do I see my mother
And my sisters and my brothers
There do I see the line of my people
They bid me to take my place among them
In the halls of Valhall where the brave may live
Forever - Forever

[Solo Thorsten]

We are legion - fighting together
We are legion - forever and ever
We are legion - show no remorse
We are legion - the master's force
