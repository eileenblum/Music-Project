Beat me at night and kiss me at dawn
kill my flame with your tears
Light my hate with your fears
Feel my heartbeat in your veins

I hold you tight - you hold my chains
This is war
I hold you tight - I hold your chains
Be my war

Furious thunder of passion feeling storm arise
This is our destiny
Forward, push forward, just forward
Until the break of dawn
Know we will not give in

Goddess, my goddess, oh beautiful sin
Gladly I would give my life
Struggling over who's gonna win
A battle we will survive

Follow me into battle
Be my sword, my protective metal
Take me hard, I'm yours
You are the key to all my doors
Be my inspiration, my spiritual source

I hold you tight - You hold my chains - This is war
I hold you tight - I hold your chains - Be my war

Furious thunder of passion feeling storm arise
This is our destiny
Forward, push forward, just forward
Until the break of dawn
Know we will not give in

Goddess, my goddess, oh beautiful sin
Gladly I would give my life
Struggling over who's gonna win
A battle we will survive

Be my love in the night
Be my fright I hide
Be the Enemy I fight
Be the way I ride

Be my love in the night
Be my fright I hide
Be the enemy I fight
Be my goddess, my pride

I hold you tight - you hold my chains
This is war
I hold you tight - I hold your chains
