I watch the sun
Rising from the ocean high
Beneath my skin the trembling
Of this sacred sight

Beyond my comprehension
More than the sum of its parts
This is a whole new dimension
The lost key to my locked up heart
To my Heart
To my Heart

I watch the sun
Rising from the ocean high
Beneath my skin the trembling
Of this sacred sight

Beyond my comprehension
More than the sum of its parts
This is a whole new dimension
The lost key to my locked up heart

Rise and fall
My new way
Trying to be free
Nature's call
And finally I found
My tranquility
