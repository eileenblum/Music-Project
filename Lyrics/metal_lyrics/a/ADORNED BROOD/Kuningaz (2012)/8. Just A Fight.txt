Just a fight in the darkest night
A magical journey in my mind
That's how I feel when I'm with you brothers
Asgard is so far away

Allfather - hold your hand above us
Allfather - your eye is watching us

Just a fight - my life fades to grey
Jost a fight - to the hall of the king
Just a fight - one day I will go to Asgard
Just a fight - I can never lose, only win

The moon casts shadows, shining
On the ground in the dark deep night
Unreal light all around the field
Reaching for the sword, I can't fight anymore

Allfather - hold your hand above us
Allfather - your eye is watching us

Just a fight - my life fades to grey
Jost a fight - to the hall of the king
Just a fight - one day I will go to Asgard
Just a fight - I can never lose, only win

My life fade to grey, Asgard hails welcome
The great halls of the one-eyed king
I can never lose, only win
Only win

Just a fight - my life fades to grey
Jost a fight - to the hall of the king
Just a fight - one day I will go to Asgard
Just a fight - I can never lose, only win
Just a fight - Asgard hails welcome
Just a fight - the battlefield is my home
Just a fight - one day I will go to glory
Just a fight - I can never lose, only win
