Her love had left her lonely
He went with the western wind
On a boat that sailed for nowhere
Looking for new land.
Twenty fine young warriors
Went on board that day
The girl was crying badly
Her love had gone away.

Farewell, my love, farewell young warrior
May the gods be with you as brothers of the sword
Farewell, my love, farewell young warrior
IÂ´ll be waiting for you
IÂ´ll keep you in my heart

The years went by and no one
Heard of the boat again
The girl waited so long
By the harbour until her end.
She died sad and lonely
The black death raged across the land
Her love returned the next year
A broken man until this end.

Farewell, my love, farewell young warrior
May the gods be with you as brothers of the sword
Farewell, my love, farewell young warrior
IÂ´ll be waiting for you
IÂ´ll keep you in my heart

When the night is dark and cloudy
ThereÂ´s a whisper in the wind
A woman singing sadly
Â´bout her love that had to end
If you go down to the water
And stay there for a while
You may see the Vikings daughter
A vision from the other side.

Farewell, my love, farewell young warrior
May the gods be with you as brothers of the sword
Farewell, my love, farewell young warrior
IÂ´ll be waiting for you
IÂ´ll keep you in my heart
IÂ´ll keep you in my heart
Farewell my love
