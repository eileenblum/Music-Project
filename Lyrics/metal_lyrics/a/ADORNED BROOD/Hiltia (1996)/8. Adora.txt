In the world
where she was born
witchcraft and
sorcery were practiced

Transformation, Christianity, Cremation

Adora walks her way
through the forest in the night.
The moon is shining brightly.
Adora walks her way
through the forest
and the trees whisper to her.

Adora - in the name of Christ
Adora - churcheÂ´s lies

She lives her own life
and she is very intelligent.

Transformation, Christianity, Cremation

Because of being that way
she was a witch
and she had to be
burned by the christians

Transformation, Christianity, Cremation

Adora was thrown on the hist
she burned with a smile on her face.

Adora - In the name of Christ
Adora - churcheÂ´s lies

Adora walks her way
through the forest
in the night.
The moon is shining brightly.
Adora walks her way
through the forest.
