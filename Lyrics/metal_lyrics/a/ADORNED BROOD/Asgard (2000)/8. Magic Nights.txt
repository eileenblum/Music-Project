Exhausted and near death,
Tyrael percieves a light in the dark.
A few steps in front of a little house
he drowns in deep unconsciousness.
Dagaz, a nice young demigoddess,
owner of this house,
picks him up and cares for him
until he arouses.

[Ref.1]
Whenb he looked into her eyes
both fell in deep love,
it's clear! They'll spend some magic nights.
And hope they'll stay together so long.

Attracted by her smile,
Tyrael knows that he found the one,
the one to stay near by,
the one to live with side by side.
Dagaz is now sad and worried,
she knows that she'll get a child,
but it's not the baby, it's not Tyrael
it's the premonition of war that makes her wild.

[Ref.2]
When they looked into their eyes
both fell in deep love.
Now as they spent some magic nights
Their luck is over.
