Magic is in the air. As many miracles,
as many gods there in this land.
- Asgard, land of the gods -
I saw the path to him, there's no turning back.
My entrance in this world was beautiful.

[Ref.1]
Walhalla the holy land.

Hall of the proud warriors.
Place of Wotan's throne.
Am I good enough?
Ruled by the one-eyed, old man.

Murderers and scum will go to hel.
A woman who rules her reich by herself.
As the loneliest majesty.
Her face, half woman half beast.

[Ref.2]
Helheim the unholy land.

A hall of pain.
Far away from light.
No turning back.
Where ever lasting darkness rules.

[Ref.3]
Asgard, the land of the gods.

Hall of the proud warrior.
Place of Wotan's home
Am I good enough?
Ruled by the one-eyed old man.

My power becomes bigger and bigger.
Magic lives in me.
- Forever and ever -
Don't you ever forget what's been told,
or die...
- Die by my hand -
