"I killed the beasts on my fathers side.
My dagger sled into the black hearts.
Courage and power I felt.
Power killed the greed.
Pride was my desire.

Fear I defeat." [Tyrael]

[Ref.]
Blood spread in this night.
The ground soaked from the blood.
- Death - shining so bright. -
Blood on the hands
In this night.

"There was might, I feel might.
Might - about life and death
Might - to extinguish the life of the beasts
Might - to kill with my hands
Might - to crush my enemies
Might - about life and death
Pride was my desire.

Blood I feel on my hands." [Tyrael]
