The journey went on, through a black
forest of misfortune.
Woods of murderers and scum.
Far away they heard laughter.
Many eyes followed them.
Narog scented their were being watched.

[Ref.]
"The second trial is awaiting you."
"In the battle I will be on your side.
My sword will kill for you."

The scum attacked from the ambush.
A violent battle began.
The bodies of the scum were torn into pieces by the swords.
The blades were drilled deeply into the scum's bodies.
The silence turned into beastly screams.
