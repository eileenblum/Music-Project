In a time,
where magic spells and gods ruled.
In a time,
where Wotan held his hand above us.
Welcome in a time,
in which we can live as once.
Spread your wings...
Spread your wings and fly.

[Ref.]
Life in the dark you open the wrong door.
Life in our Asgard we know it's our endevour.

I - I don't tell you lies.
Close - Close your eyes and hear.
Follow me into a time,
where father and son go on journey.
To teach to fight.
To learn to kill.

[Ref.]

Three trials must be passed
Fight, kill without fear.
When the son would be pass (as a warrior)
Fight, kill without fear.
In a time,
where magic spells and gods ruled.
In a time where Wotan held his hand above us.

Welcome into a time, ruled by Wotan.
Sooner or later you must understand.
