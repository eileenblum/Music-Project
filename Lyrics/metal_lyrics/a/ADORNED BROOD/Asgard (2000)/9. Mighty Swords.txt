The battle begins, Side by side
A battle of life and death.
The battle starts.
Mighty men with might swords
Kill their enemies.
Screams can be heard
All over the land,
carried by the wind.

[Ref.1]
Screams can be heard all over the land.
Screams, full of pain and despair.

This bloody battle takes a very long time,
but the enemies fought until the bitter end,
in this bloody inferno.

[Ref.2]
Raise your mighty swords and fight.
Raise your mighty swords and do as Wotan pleases.

Tyrael, the mighty warrior was exhausted.

"Dein Sohn braucht Dich." [Dagaz]
He longed for his father and his wife.

"Ich begehre Dich.
Verlass uns bitte nicht." [Dagaz]

- Raise your mighty swords and fight -
A battle to the blood, day by day.
A battle to the flesh, day by day.

Hit by an enemies sword through the heart,

- He lay dying on the bloody ground -

and saw his life full of pride passing by.

- carried by the wind -

The last being he thought of, as Dagaz,
then the virgins led him to his master.
