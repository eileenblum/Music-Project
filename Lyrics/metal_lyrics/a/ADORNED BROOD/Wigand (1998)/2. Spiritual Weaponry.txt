This light that I see deep inside,
songs from Walhalla they come
Spiritual weaponry
I'm tired, the end is close,
one more night and my live is done
Spiritual weaponry
The sun creeps under the shadows in grey,
coldness is my torment
This is the beginning of an eternal trip
this is the way to my last battle
My life fly's away
for death embraces my last wish;
the desire to get more
I'm weak but I'm a warrior
I'm gonna fight for my honour and land
The last blood in my vains
flows for you Wotan
I swear yes
I swear yes
I swear for you Wotan
