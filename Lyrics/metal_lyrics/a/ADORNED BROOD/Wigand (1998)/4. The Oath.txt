Oh Heimdall, my shield in the baygone fight
be thanked for your aid last night.
Were you not there against wrathful foe
would the life out of my body go.
For the day when my life I leave
Today this promise you I give:
On the day when you the
Gijallarhorn blow
I will be by you with rage like a fiery glow.
We affirm our alliance anew
and I fight until death beside you.
