I sat under the tree
When my Master spoke to me
His words froze my blood
As he told the truth.

Under Yggdrasil
I want to know who I am
Under Yggdrasil
Tomorrow's awaiting, heading to paradise

I cried for the ones I lost
My heart bleeding for my Brothers
Oh great Lord in Valhalla
Give me Strength to survive.

What do I see each time?
Is this my destiny?
Is this all thats left for me
Confusion and bad memories?

Under Yggdrasil
I want to know who I am
Under Yggdrasil
Tomorrow's awaiting, heading to paradise

Under Yggdrasil, under Yggdrasil,
Under Yggdrasil, under Yggdrasil

Under Yggdrasil
I want to know who I am
Under Yggdrasil
Tomorrow's awaiting, heading to paradise

Under Yggdrasil
I want to know who I am
Under Yggdrasil
Tomorrow's awaiting, heading to paradise
...I'm in paradise
