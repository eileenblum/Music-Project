Words of destiny,
Carried by the wind,
Whispered in your ears
They bear tears.

Looks like an Angel, with the Beast in the internal one.
Wild and untamed, hated and beloved

These words come from a Creature,
At home in our heads.
And tell me what do you see
A wolf in a Lambskin?

Looks like an Angel, with the Beast in the internal one.
Wild and untamed, hated and beloved

She seems like an angel
Behind her eyes it's dark and cold
The Beast waits for her Appearance
To take you all in her spell

She's not what she seems
A vision in our dreams
Look beyond her crystal eyes!
Adorned Princess, you're the keeper of the Brood.

Looks like an Angel, with the Beast in the internal one.
Wild and untamed, hated and beloved

She seems like an angel
Behind her eyes it's dark and cold
The Beast waits for her Appearance
To take you all in her spell
