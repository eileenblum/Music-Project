Crushes the life of our enemies.
Crushes everyone who has gone.
Crushes everyone who did not believe.
Crushes everyone who turned away.

Ashes at every place we left.
Villages we have robbed.
We have conquered castles.
We have made the gods furious.

Long is the way to our Noor,
It was long away we sailed
And we're sailed across
The Northern Sea,
Far from home.

The Northern Stars lead us the way to our Noor.

Crushes the life of our enemies.
Crushes everyone who has gone.
Crushes everyone who did not believe.
Crushes everyone who turned away.

Long is the way to our Noor,
It was long away we sailed
And we're sailed across
The Northern Sea,
Far from home.

The moon is shining so bright, to show us the Harbor.
The morning sun leads us the way to our Noor.

Long is the way to our Noor,
It was long away we sailed
And we're sailed across
The Northern Sea,
Far from home.
