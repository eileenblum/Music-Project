Brothers of Metal
Your hands held high
Brothers of Metal
Thousand fists to the sky
Side by side
With iron and steel
Side by side
Fighting for Metal that is real

Sons of the damned
Together we're strong
Sons of the damned
Together we're one
Sons of the damned
With the Gods on our side
Sons of the damned
(Let us drink to our Lord)
We will win the fight

Metal is our Law
Metal is our Life
Metal is our Law
Metal is our Life
We stay together
And show no fear
For Metal
We stay here

Sons of the damned
Together we're strong
Sons of the damned
Together we're one
Sons of the damned
With the Gods on our side
Sons of the damned
(Let us drink to our Lord)
We will win the fight

Sons of the damned, together we're strong
(Let us drink to the sound)
Sons of the damned, together we're one
(Let us drink to our Lord)
Sons of the damned, with the Gods on our side
(Let us fight for Metal)
Sons of the damned, we will win the fight
(Sons of the damned)
