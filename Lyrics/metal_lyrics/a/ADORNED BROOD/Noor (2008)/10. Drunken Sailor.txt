What shall we do with the drunken sailor,
What shall we do with the drunken sailor,
What shall we do with the drunken sailor,
Early in the morning

Hoo-ray, and up she rises,
Hoo-ray, and up she rises,
Hoo-ray, and up she rises,
Early in the morning.

Put him in the long boat until he's sober,
Put him in the long boat until he's sober,
Put him in the long boat until he's sober,
Early in the morning

Hoo-ray, and up she rises,
Hoo-ray, and up she rises,
Hoo-ray, and up she rises,
Early in the morning.

Shave his belly with a rusty razor,
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,
Shave his belly with a rusty razor,
Early in the morning,

Hoo-ray, and up she rises,
Hoo-ray, and up she rises,
Hoo-ray, and up she rises,
Early in the morning.
