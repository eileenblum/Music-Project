When the night releases the day
Which pushes cold in your nape,
You will hear this song,
Before you flee into the night.

When the day makes him angry,
The night will be attacked from the troll,
You will smell his breath,
And creep finally on the ground.

Formed by their Gods.
A part of the everlasting woods.

If the day expels the night,
In your mind the fear remains,,
This song, will fade away
Before the crowd moves into the dark.

Trolls in big crowd will now sing
Their song, quite oddly.

Formed by their Gods.
A part of the everlasting woods.
