[Music: Thorsten &amp; Frost / Lyrics: Frost]

Your sanctimony sickens me
You lie to our faces and still think we believe
As the hammer destroys the cross
The fish falls prey to the raven
Arid is being torn apart

Our strength will be your downfall
Our swords will shatter your
Your faith has failed
We'll stay true to our gods

The way we head is against the stream
Of the weak minded sheep
Slaughter the lamb of your god

Grab your swords and take your shields
We will prevail - we will bestride
Now our time has come to fight
In armour we ride - side by side
Together we stand united as one
In Wotan we trust - he is our guide
We turn this place into hell
Shout out with us "Hellea"

Birds and beasts of prey
Versus herds of sheep
In the sign of the wolf and raven
We'll stay true to our gods
Birds and beasts of prey
Versus herds of sheep
In the sign of the wolf and raven
We'll stay true to our gods
