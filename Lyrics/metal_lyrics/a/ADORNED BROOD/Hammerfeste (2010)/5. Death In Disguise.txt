[Music: Jan &amp; Thorsten / Lyrics: Frost]

The battle is won
Smoke-clouds are gone
The defeated surrendered
And begged us to come

Then they took us
To meet with their king
"Let us fight together"
His majesty said

He promised us gold
He promised us land
But we all knew
This meant death at the end

Knowing our enemy
And his awful sins
We made them believe
We didn't see the trap

As we lay down
We pull our swords
To slay the horde
And prevail once again

[Chorus]

With traitors we dine
They poisoned our wine
With innocent eyes
They served death in disguise
