[Music: Jan / Lyrics: Frost]

Odin. bless our warriors
For they can go to Asgard
You stand beside us
And guide us
Through the night

With your amazing might
With your amazing might

From the mountains
Covered with snow
To the northern see
Bless our warriors
From the lakes
In the east
To the forest in the west
Bless our warriors

Fighting with them
The tears are falling
On the bloody ground
Fighting with my brothers
Together side by side

With your amazing might
With your amazing might

[Chorus]

Odin, protect us in this dark times
Odin, hold your hand above us

[Chorus]
