[Music: Jan &amp; Thorsten / Lyrics: Frost]

Black was the night
Dark stars were burning
Through the veils of mist
So dim and pale.
The track it passed
The realm of ghosts
When a bloody path
Wound its way down

And angry gods
Sent me to life

The gate is closed
In front of you
On the savage horse
Full of despair
You will be chased
Through dreary life
No delight
Dares to follow you

And angry gods
Sent me to life
Torture, pain
And suffering

Triumph - kein GlÃ¼ck geschenkt
Triumph - kein Weg zu weit
Triumph - keinen Tag verschenkt
Triumph - zum Kampfe bereit.

As you sink back
Into everlasting night
See desolation
Aiming at you
You only feel
Your life is pain
And you face
The countenance of death

[Chorus]
