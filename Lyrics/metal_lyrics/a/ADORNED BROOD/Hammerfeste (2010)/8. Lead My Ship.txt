[Music: Thorsten &amp; Frost / Lyrics: Frost]

Onward! Warriors! Ride those waves
For honour gold and property
I won't rest with my wife
Because battle is in my blood
Winter storms roar, masts burst
We laugh in the face of the storm
To die in battle - the highest honour on earth

Lead my ship
Lead my ship

Odin, lead my ship to the kingdom of Asgard
See wild valkyres riding
Odin, father lead me to the everlasting kingdom
I shed my blood in battle
Just like our forefathers

Raging giants, burning belief
The axes ooze with anger
The faithful Viking belief
The warrior's most precious resource
Defying the wild thunderstorms
Thor's hammer lights the sky
The ravens whisper our victory
In the ears of the godly world

[Chorus]

Winter storms roar, masts burst
We laugh in the face of the storm
To die in battle - the highest honour on earth

[Chorus]
