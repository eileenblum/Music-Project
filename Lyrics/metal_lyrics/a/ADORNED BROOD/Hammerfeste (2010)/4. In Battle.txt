[Music: Jan &amp; Thorsten / Lyrics: Frost]

As I gaze into the sky
I can see the ravens fly
And as I hear the northern call
In battle is where I will fall
When axes clash and blood is shed
My path is paved by the dead
In battle I will reign supreme
On victory I am so keen

As I gaze into the sky
I can see the ravens fly
And as I hear the northern call
In battle is where I will fall

In battle we will stand or fall
Waiting for the northern call
To Asgard we're gonna fly
Ravenlike we'll soar to the sky

[Chorus]

In battle [3x]
I will reign supreme
In battle [2x]
We will stand or fall
In Battle

[Chorus]

In battle we will stand or fall
Waiting for the northern call
To Asgard we're gonna fly
Ravenlike we'll soar to the sky
