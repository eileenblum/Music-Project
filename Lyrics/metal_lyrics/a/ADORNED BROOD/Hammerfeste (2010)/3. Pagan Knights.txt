[Music: Jan &amp; Thorsten / Lyrics: Frost]

Listen to my sword I hold high
Praying to my gods
Listen to the words of our gods
And fighting for them

The pagan knights will fight
Fight for freedom

Without any fear we march into the battle
Blood will cover the path, the path to freedom

With proudly raised heads and crossed swords
We are ready to fight and to die

We protect our country and our faith
The faith in the old gods

The pagan knights will fight
Fight for freedom

With proudly raised heads and crossed swords
We are ready to fight and to die

We are Odins warriors, prepare to die for him
With proudly raised heads and crossed swords

The one eyed old man is our king
The king of wisdom and freedom
If you're invited to his great halls
You are free, you're always free

[Chorus]
