All shall be consumed
Down to the last ashes
Malefic book of lies,
Replete with logical heresies

Profuse incoherent absurdities
And ethical fallacies
Thy cause of multitudes
To plunge unto thwarted cries

Thou shall let no tyrant god
Lay the yoke of faith on thee
Slay all paedophile gods
In their bestial semblances

[2x]
Your name will fade with time
Amidst your scorched barren shrine
Your name will fade with time
Death of all things divine

Man made rituals,
A lying foundation
Feeding on mechanical,
Mindless masses

Forget all
You know about the god of creed
Religion is
Tailored for the walking dead

For we lost our faith
In all that is celestial
All this time conditioned
Won't heal the pain

Whilst adherents are
Uttering a prayer to be saved
We lift the latch of bronze
And enter fearlessly

[2x]
Your name will fade with time
Amidst your scorched barren shrine
Your name will fade with time
Death of all things divine
