ONCE THE VIRULENT STORM HAS DIED
LIKE CRAWLING INFANTS YOU WILL STRIDE
THE HARDEST SHALL BE THE FIRST TREAD
WHEN FACING THE STEEP MOUNTAIN AHEAD

BUT BEFORE LONG YOU SHALL BE SET FREE
AS LION AND HORNED BEAST HOLD BATTLE
IN DISPUTE OVER YOUR VALUABLE CROWN
UNTIL FINALLY BOTH BEASTS LIE DOWN

EQUALLY GLAD AND EQUALLY WEARY
SOLE AND SUBLIME THAT CROWN OF YOURS
IN THE GRAY FROSTY VOID OF THE ABYSS
WATCH THE FLAME BEYOND THE WALL
RAISE THE CROWN TOWARD YOUR BLISS

ITS' TWELVES STARS FILLING THE SILENCE
AND SOLITUDE WITH A RAGING MUSIC
AND A MOTION SILENT INDIVISIBLE
YOU SHALL SIT ENTHRONED UPON THE INVISIBLE
METAMORPHOSIS OF THE MAGGOTS

YOUR EYES FIXED ON THAT WHICH IS NOTHING
BEYOND ANYTHIGN THAT THOUGHT OR TRANCE CAN REACH

METAMORPHOSIS OF THE MAGGOTS
ASCEND NOW BROOD OF THE ABYSS

YOUR RIGHT HAND GIRTHING THE AZURE ROD OF LIGHT
WHILE THE LEFT GRIPPING THE RED SCOURGE OF DEATH

GIRDELED BY A SNAKE MORE BRILLIANT THAN THE SUN ITSELF
THE GREAT OMNIPRESENT SERPENT WHOSE NAME IS ETERNITY
FULL OF KNOWING YOUR MOUTH CURVED MOON
LIKE IN A GRINNING SMILE
POISED FORWARD KISSING NUIT THE LADY OF THE STRAY ABODES
METAMORPHOSIS OF THE MAGGOTS
