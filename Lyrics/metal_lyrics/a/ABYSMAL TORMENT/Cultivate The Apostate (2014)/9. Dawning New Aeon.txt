THE SKYLINE SHONE BEAUTIFULLY WHILE ABLAZE
TWISTED FUMING METAL STRETCHED UPWARDS
EVERYTHING GLOWED WITH AN ORANGE HAZE
DARK CLOUDS OF VENOM ENGULFED THE LANDS

SIPHONING SPLATTERED RAINING BLOOD
SEWERS BELOW BECAME ALL MUDDED
I AM THE FORCE BEHIND THE SCENE YOU SEE
I WEAVED THIS WEB OF LIGHT AND ILLUSIONS
I AM THE SOUND OF A MILLION EXPLODING SUNS
I AM SHAKING YOU FROM YOUR DEEP SLUMBER

WITH A THOUSAND LONELY SUICIDES
FORCED BY TERROR OF INCINERATION
A DARK WIND BLOWS
CORRUPTION ABOUNDS
AND NEARLY ALL OF YOU ARE DEAF AND MUTE

CAST YOUR EYES TO THE CHASM OF ADEN
DAWNING NEW AEON

SIPHONING SPLATTERED RAINING BLOOD
SEWERS BELOW BECAME ALL MUDDED
I AM THE FORCE BEHIND THE SCENE YOU SEE
I WEAVED THIS WEB OF LIGHT AND ILLUSIONS
I AM THE SOUND OF A MILLION EXPLODING SUNS
I AM SHAKING YOU FROM YOUR DEEP SLUMBER
TRAPPED IN THE BOWELS OF THIS VILE REGIME

AND AS FORETOLD IT'S BLEEDING TO DEATH
BLOOD HOLOCAUST AMPLIFIED A MILLION-FOLD

THROUGH THE EYES OF THE WHOLE GLOBE
FOR MEMORY TO REMAIN AS A GHOSTLY

DISEASE OBSTINATELY HAUNTING YOUR MIND
YOUR FIERY GRIN, A FROZEN ASH SMUDGED FROWN
...AND THE DUSK'S PALE GLOW, SPIRALS UPWARDLY DOWN
