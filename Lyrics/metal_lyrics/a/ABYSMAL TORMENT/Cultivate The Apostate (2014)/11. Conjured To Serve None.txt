FATHER CHOKMAH THOU ARE I IN THE BURNING SPHERES

HALLOWED BE THY FLAME EMANATION OF KETHER

NON SERVIAM MORIAH VICTRIX VENTUS

MY KINGDOM COME,
BY TOIL AND WRATH,
OF THE DARK MOTHER,
THY WILL BE DONE,

THY WILL BE DONE, THY TRUE WILL OF THE BORN-LESS ONE
IN MALKUTH AS IN EVERY MANIFESTATION OF THE AIN SOF
THY WILL BE DONE, THY TRUE WILL OF THE BORN-LESS ONE
STRENGTHEN US AND QUENCH OUR LUST TO KNOW THY SELF

TRESPASSING BEGETS NO SCORN FOR IT IS YOUR WILL IN MINE
WE OF ASSIAH HAVE BUT NAUGHT TO FORGIVE NOR BLAME
LEAD US NOT AMONG THE BLIND HORDES OF IGNORANCE
BUT DELIVER OUR EMBER FROM THE NIGHT SKY'S WOMB

NON SERVIAM MORIAH VICTRIX VENTUS

NON SERVIAM MORIAH VICTRIX VENTUS
