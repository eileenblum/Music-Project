WARE, NOR OF GOOD NOR ILL, WHAT AIM HATH ACT?
WITHOUT IT'S CLIMAX, DEATH, WHAT SAVOUR HATH
LIFE? AN IMPECCABLE MACHINE, EXACT
HE PACES AN INANE AND POINTLESS PATH

TO GLUT BRUTE APPETITES, HIS SOLE CONTENT

HOW TEDIOUS WERE HE FIT TO COMPREHEND

HIMSELF! MORE, THIS OUR NOBLE ELEMENT
OF FIRE IN NATURE, LOVE IN SPIRIT, UNKENNED

LIFE HATH NO SPRING, NO AXLE, AND NO END

HIS BODY A BLOOD-RUBY RADIANT
WITH NOBLE PASSION, SUN-SOULED LUCIFER
SWEPT THROUGH THE DAWN COLOSSAL, SWIFT ASLANT
ON EDEN'S IMBECILE PERIMETER

HE BLESSED NONENTITY WITH EVERY CURSE
AND SPICED WITH SORROW THE DULL SOUL OF SENSE,
BREATH LIFE INTO THE STERILE UNIVERSE,
WITH LOVE AND KNOWLEDGE DROVE OUT INNOCENCE

THE KEY OF JOY IS DISOBEDIENCE
