IT'S THE DAWN OF THE BLACK SUN
DEVOURER AND BESTOWER OF LIFE
ILLUMINATE, CULTIVATE THE APOSTATE

YOU OBSERVE AS THEY COMMAND
AND WADE THROUGH YOUR OWN BLOOD
BEFORE LONG YOU SHALL UNDERSTAND
WHAT IS IN STORE WITH THE SEEDS YOU SOW

IN WRATH AND VENGEANCE TEAR DOWN
THE BASTIONS OF THEIR GODS OF DOMINATION
BASK IN THEIR CRIES, ANGUISH AND SUFFERING
BE THE FOOL WHO KNOWS BUT REMAINS TACIT

IT'S THE EYE OF THE HOLLOW ECLIPSE
DISPENSER AND DESTROYER OF DEATH
ILLUMINATE, CULTIVATE THE APOSTATE

IT'S THE DAWN OF THE BLACK SUN
DEVOURER AND BESTOWER OF LIFE
CULTIVATE THE APOSTATE

IT'S THE EYE OF THE HOLLOW ECLIPSE
DISPENSER AND DESTROYER OF DEATH
CULTIVATE THE APOSTATE
