ADORER OF FALLACY FEEDING UPON EXTERNAL STIMULUS
LIKE PROMETHEUS CHAINED UP ON MOUNT CAUCASUS
DEAD I THE FLESH MISTAKEN FOR DEITY
FEIGN EMOTIONS FILL YOUR HOLLOW CONSCIENCE
CLINGING TO MASKS AND OBJECTS A LIFE IN SHAMBLES
ADDICTED TO IMPRESSIONS TI FILL A PSYCHIC ABYSS
AKIN TO PHOSPHORUS TRASHING AND CHURNING IN AN ICY HELL
MAN CAN'T BE STILL WHILE HE TRIES TO FILL THAT EMPTY SHELL

CARVING STAINING THAT CARNAL TOMB
CONFORMING SHEEPISHLY TO HIS DAILY DOOM
LOST IN A WORLD OF MIRAGES
CHASING REFLECTIONS IN MIRRORS

OSIRIS ENTOMBED ALIVE IN GOLD AND LEAD
DEAD IN THE FLESH
SIPPING ACRID POISON DRIPPING FROM THE SUN
DEAD IN THE FLESH

KALI BINAH REND THE CHARRED FLESH OPEN
DEAD IN THE FLESH
HORUS BE REBORN TO BALANCE THE REIGN OF SET
DEAD IN THE FLESH

AKIN TO PHOSPHORUS TRASHING AND CHURNING IN AN ICY HELL
MAN CAN'T BE STILL WHILE HE TRIES TO FILL THAT EMPTY SHELL

CARVING STAINING THAT CARNAL TOMB
CONFORMING SHEEPISHLY TO HIS DAILY DOOM
LOST IN A WORLD OF MIRAGES
CHASING REFLECTIONS IN MIRRORS

FEEDING ON HYPOCRISY AND FLATTERY OF THE SYCOPHANT
COMPETING AND FOLLOWING MORALS OF THE HIEROPHANT 
DEAD IN THE FLESH

IN ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION HIS REBELLION IS MOCKERY
BLIND SLAVES BRED TO SERVE THE WILL OF TRUE CREATIVITY

OSIRIS ENTOMBED ALIVE IN GOLD AND LEAD
SIPPING ACRID POISON DRIPPING FROM THE SUN
KALI BINAH REND THE CHARRED FLESH OPEN
HORUS, BE REBORN TO BALANCE THE REIGN OF SET
