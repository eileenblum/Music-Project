No god scribed those deemed holy texts
Devious men concocted those words by wit and intent
Aimed to divide and conquer stone headed fools
Such as most of these entrapped souls are

No god scribed those deemed holy texts
Devious men concocted those words by wit and intent
Aimed to divide and conquer stone headed fools
Such as most of these entrapped souls are

Whispering venomous ones
Vipers with shifty tongues
Whispering venomous ones
Belching forth their lies

I pray to god to rid me of god
If I were not, god would not be either
If I were not, god will not be god
God is within, I am without
The eye through which I see god
The eye through which god sees me
They eye is the same eye
They eye of evolution

Everything is as it is and everything is not what it is
Cursed sons of the pit called because

Only the inner man can grasp this
Find the one desire behind all desires
Through nothing, I become what I am
Only the hand that erases can inscribe truth
Whispering Venomous Ones
