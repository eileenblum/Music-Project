THEIR FUTILE SOBBING WORSE THAN CHILD'S CRY
WHEN THEY'RE REAPED BY SATURN'S LEAD SCYTHE
PAST PRESENT FUTURE FRUITLESS ABSENT MIGHT
THEIR END IS NIGH TO HANG THEM HIGH

THEIR AGE OF AMDNESS IS DULY OVER
DECEITFUL OF ARCHAIC MODE OF TAUGHT
FEAR, GUILD AND SELF LOATHE ALL IT'S BROUGHT
THEIR END IS NIGH TO HANG THEM HIGH

THEIR FUTILE SOBBING WORSE THAN CHILD'S CRY
WHEN THEY'RE REAPED BY SATURN'S LEAD SCYTHE
PAST PRESENT FUTURE FRUITLESS ABSENT MIGHT
THEIR END IS NIGH TO HANG THEM HIGH

HANG DOOM PROPHETS FROM THEIR LOFTY TOWERS
HANG GOLD-HOARDING DEATH-DEALERS OF BABYLON
HANG CHILD-DEFILING HIGH PRIESTS OF ROME
HANG SLY STATESMAN FROM HIGHEST FLAGPOLES

HANG THEM HIGH
WATCH THEM DIE

TIMES ARE RIPE FOR BUTCHERING CATTLE
SHOULD YOU CHOOSE YORU OWN DEMISE...
THERE ARE THOSE WHO WILL SELL IT TO YOU
AT A PRICE FOR ALL TO CONSUME AND DIE

HANG BLUE BLOODS FROM THEIR ROYAL FAMILY TREES
HANG CULTIST OVERLORDS FROM THEIR ZIGGURATS
HANG ISLAM'S INSANE CALIPHS FROM MINARETS
HANG CROOKED ZIONISTS FROM THE WAILING WALL

HEED THE PRISTINE LAW
THEIR SOULS BEGIN TO FRAY
SACRIFICE CULTIST OF OLD
UNDER THE LAW OF THE BOLD
