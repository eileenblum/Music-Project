ONCE MORE IT RISES FROM THE ANCIENT DEPTHS
FORCEFULLY GAUGING ITS WAY THROUGH DORMANT CLEFTS
AS ONE MULTITUDE OF MINDS REACHING FOR WHAT WAS LOST
AND FORGOTTEN IN THE SWIRLING WATERS OF THE PAST

OH HOW THE GODS HAVE FAILED
ENSLAVED IN MALKUTH
WOE ON THEE FRAIL MEN
IN THE CAVERNS OF MALKUTH

BURIED UNDER SHEER MASS OF FEAR, BLOOD, AND HATRED
SURGING, SURFACING FROM THE SUBCONSCIOUS MAUSOLEUM

OH HOW THE GODS HAVE FAILED
ENSLAVED IN MALKUTH
WOE ON THEE FRAIL MEN
IN THE CAVERNS OF MALKUTH

BLINDLY OBLITERATED BY FIRES OF PURIFICATION
SWALLOWED THE VIBRANT DARK EARTH IN COLLISION
SWEPT CLEAN BY TITANIC GRAILS IN ENDLESS TORSION
DROWNED IN THE BLACK WATERS OF DISSOLUTION

ENSLAVED IN MALKUTH
IN THE CAVERNS OF MALKUTH

PENETRATED BY OMNIPRESENT AETHER OF INTENTION
ELEMENTALLY DESTROYED AND THEN REBORN
EMERGING FROM THE WOMB OF REALITY'S VERY FABRIC
TIME HAS NO WOUNDS TO HEAL WHEN THERE'S NONE TO FLOW

ENSLAVED IN MALKUTH
IN THE CAVERNS OF MALKUTH
