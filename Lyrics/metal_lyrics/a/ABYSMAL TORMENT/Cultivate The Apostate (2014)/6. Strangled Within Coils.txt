THINGS SEEM ACQUIRED AND MORE ARE LOST
SUCH IS THE WHOLE PLY OF THE SENSES
JUST TRYING TO ORIENT THE SELF BUT STILL EVER LOST
A WEIGHT ON THE NECK POISED OVER OBLIVION
WAGING WAR ON THE SELF PHYSICALLY ENSLAVED
BY A SHIMMERING WORLD THUS I BEHAVE LIKE A MAN IN A GRAVE
CAUSE AND EFFECT ARE THE PRESCRIBED LAWS
SELF-DECEIT AND DELUSIONS THE OPIATE OF THE MASSES

HEARKEN IN SILENCE
HEARKEN DEVOID OF SENSES
HEARKEN IN DARKNESS
SEPARATE FROM SENSIBLE THINGS
HEARKEN IN EMPTINESS
VOID OF CORPOREAL QUANTITY
HEARKEN DEVOID OF CONSCIOUSNESS

TEAR OUT THE EYES AND FATHOM WAHTS BEHIND
PIERCE THE EARDRUMS AND LISTEN TO THE HUM
THE INNATE LIMIT FALLS, FEEL IT UNBIND
PENDULUM STANDS STILL, NO AGE TO COME

FEEL THEM, THESE SPIRAL VIBRATIONS
STRANGLED WITHIN COILS
FEEL THEM, JOLTING IN THE VEINS
STANGLED WITHIN COILS
FEEL THEM, IN THE PULSING FLAMES
STRANGLED WITHIN COILS
FEEL THEM, THE PRIMORDIAL CHAINS
STRANGLED WITHIN COILS
