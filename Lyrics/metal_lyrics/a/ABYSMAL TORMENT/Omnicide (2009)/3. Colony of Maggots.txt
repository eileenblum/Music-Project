Weâre one sunlit eve away from the storm
One caressing kiss away from the fist
One promising tomorrow away from sorrow
One steady step away from the slippery edge
One laughter filled breath away from our death
One daring leap on a mountain too steep

Weâre one genocide away from salvation
One droplet of rain away from the flood
One restful sleep from the cemetery mud
One triumphant victory away from shame
One unique idea and itâs all the same

Weâre one bullet away from homicide
One sandy step away from the deadly tide
One truth bleeding from ten thousand lies
One incessant horde that follows as mice
One furtive abortion from annihilation

Weâre one fraction of an immense abstraction
One will to slaughter our way to salvation
One wield of a sword from the godheadâs ablation
One impure stream of cleansing devotion
One more stab at a mother in convulsion

Weâre one expression of freedom in bondage
One wall in a prison of our own conception
One colony of maggots feeding on a sore wound
One dangling strand of hope poised on doom
One virulent strike cast in burning desire

Weâre one mind with no design that is right
One strenuous now from tomorrowâs plight
One field of vision and nothing in sight
One short eternity from heavens light
