Standing on the nameless graves
of victims slain just to please me
Tortured craving death as mercy
Mangled so my whims be served
Their life I claimed, stalked and reaped,
Living they belonged solely to me
To torque and shape as I demand
Emperor in my ruthless dominion

Sovereignty of terror I uphold 
Treading placidly on moist soil
While they rot beneath my feet
Their putrescent decomposition
summons my countless servants 
To gather for the decaying banquet
Of human leftovers that I abjured
For nature to claim her sublime due

When dead they serve no purpose 
Mortal injury being the perfect tool
To extract fear in massive amounts
Supreme tyrant by my own decree

Sovereignty of terror I uphold
Treading placidly on moist soil
While they rot beneath my feet
Their putrescent decomposition
summons my countless servants
To gather for the decaying banquet
Of human leftovers that I abjured
For nature to claim her sublime due

To dispense pain and harvest dread
Becoming a tangible addictive entity

Of graying husks burred in damp earth
Penchant for tender flesh of females
Being more malleable for my designs
But in the end I don't deny myself conveying
Unthinkable suffrage indiscriminately 
All are welcome among the fold
To rot in saturated mass graves
Rigorously terrorizing the living
Absorbing fear is my sole undertaking
