In due time when lastly I become Death
Death will be the seed from which I grow
Animated by ardent conflagration
I am all you so heatedly strove for

Now filled with regret wail in desperation
For all shall vanish in one violent roar
For Death needs time for what it kills to grow in
This endless viral replication of life-in-death

The furnace of millennial pressures
Scorched beneath flaming wings
Virulently explodes in vengeful wrath
scorched Beneath Flaming Wings
A Heated pyroclastic flow that purges
Scorched Beneath Flaming Wings
Consuming all standing in its path
scorched beneath flaming wings

The wings of death 
Unfurl with a cry of war 
Now filled with regret
Behold the Phoenix soar

Now I am become Death destroyer of Worlds
Flirting with possibilities beyond hate and bliss
Placing illusion in the fiery grave as it belongs
Into scorching fire all shall find their desired peace

A flame of omnicidal candour
Embracing all in grandeur 
Scorching bonds in rapture
Nothing but glowing stupor
