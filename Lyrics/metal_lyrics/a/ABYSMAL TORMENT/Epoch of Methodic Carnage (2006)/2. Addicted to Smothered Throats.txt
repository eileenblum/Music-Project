Rising from the torpor of stale water
Reminiscent fragments of memories
Pierce my consciousness as shards of glass
Slowly forced through living meat
Reflecting images taught forever erased
How wrong was I now I discover
Feeble inside tenuous restrains of taught
Laid by confessions amid deep introspection
Solitary monologues of a madman's temptation
Scourging dreams of stealing chastened blood
From the vestibule of innocence
To satiate the thirsty vaults of my sick mind
Once more I watch these hands these fingers
A tight noose wound round a shriveling throat
Striped of life extinguished like a flame
Violated Venus dressed in liquid
Enveloped in death silhouetted in the darkling shimmer
Staring open mouthed back at me
In serene surreal ambiguity
Black eyes mirroring the haze on my blank face
Vacant within sinking the tips of my fingers into her
Eyes losing luster like worthless stones adorning
The disembodied remains beneath the surface tension
Specter of a denied past still looming in my head
But no more at rest now residing within my hands
At last released free afloat and she slowly sinks
Abandoning me as fluids invade her chest
Guilt does not impair primordial needs
This deed only inflames my hunger
Yearning more throats to smother
