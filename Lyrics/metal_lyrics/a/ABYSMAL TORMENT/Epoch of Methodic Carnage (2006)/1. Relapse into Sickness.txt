Once within the chaotic maze I'm lost forlorn
Crushed in dejection by a whole host of possibilities
I followed whispers suffocating in the gloom
Gurgling like blood through a slit throat
I followed in silence amid twisting halls
Only just iridescent of fading specks of light
Consumed and put out by tears that blood has shed
All around losing substance giving way to numbness
Where in others what springs is fear of the unknown
In essence irrational but still hard to subjugate
Bleak prospect of finding any sense at all
Betrayed from the start by my very nature
Fruit of centuries of regenerating in suppression
Absurd inhibitions shackled higher insurrection
Incoherent ideas sculpted to spread dismay and guilt
For crimes that aren't, in my core I seek to ravish
Lapsing in lower state while drifting in a sea of languor
Demise is all I can perceive among this horde
Vacillating like tired birds amid ferocious hail
Sipping untold mystery diseased born of fear
Raping dispoiling whatever pure still stands
Adulterated by slithering concealed snakes
Sinuously in motion allure to feeble emotion
Envenomed dragged to the brink of resignation
Life allure to the hopeless herd grazing in envenomed fields
Lost in a path littered by virtuous truths of doubt
Bound by gregarious existence based upon perversion
Castrated ideals set my inside ablaze
Upon facing the golden age of filth
Pervaded with every kind of shit
Where subhuman mongoloid scum
Thrive engaging in boundaries perversion
Orgiastic culture of death fruit of our own making
Upon abject liars I vomit this visceral gush of aversion
Sought for domination I'm none's to bleed
Never shall I feed greed with pain and fear
Cut me open pull me inside out but I shall never bleed
All around me weather before hateful eyes
Bonds of affection are no more than frail twigs
Bound to be shattered in the midst of violent gales
Gales of hate where's there's no life
Veins vigorously pumping blood infused in abhorrence
While malevolence brews within my soulless heart
Intrinsic hatred voraciously eating me out
Lost and destined to dwell were no life dwells
Dead inside now choking on my own lies
Death becomes the only concrete reality
