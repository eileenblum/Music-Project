Amid the recurring batter of weapons
Epoch of Methodic Carnage
Muffled, but unmistakable sound
Epoch of Methodic Carnage
Human cries from the far edge of reason
Epoch of Methodic Carnage
Merging with the last echoes of another blast
Epoch of Methodic Carnage
Receding, leaving emptiness quickly filled again
With hammering of automatic weaponry
Sputtering beyond the last stronghold's walls
Toward a vanguard armed with ample hatred
Overwhelming and persuasive, just like a drug
The pummel of shells coming over in profusion
Whom shockwaves seem closer each time
The sky commences pouring death pounding the earth
Sounds of great storms compacted in successive instants
Reverberating ferocious tolling noises throbbing skulls
While ranks of buildings hastily eave in
Breaching invaders storming through
Gutted walls as jagged as broken bones
Vast deaf blind mobs of hate knowing no fear
Millions of darting projectiles finding harbor
Through flesh biting away at stricken bodies
Stoically accepting the pain of their failures
Raging crossifre sweeping figures off their feet
Guns methodically building up barriers of corpses
Brethren climbing  over dead towards martyrdom
Disease gnawing its way through population
As strewn corpses lay broken on the ground
All bearing agonized postures of endured torment
Human flotsam crushed by grunting heavy armor
Trenching open another corpses bowels
In a thousand years the earths ground will still stink of death
While main guns pulse towards a counterfeit victory
