The time elapsed now
As I turn my back
At the dark season
That's just gone by
I lay my feet on
The scorched ground and
Slowly walk on
Through the endless grey
Stretching beyond the bleak horizon
Serene Obscurity
Scenes of surreal tranquility
Seemingly impossible
Nocturnal noiselessness
I'm entangled further more
In increasing frustration
With every step I take
By which I can never reach
The border to this place
I'm imprisoned
In a cage without bars
