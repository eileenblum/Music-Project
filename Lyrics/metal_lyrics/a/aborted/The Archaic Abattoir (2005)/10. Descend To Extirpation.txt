Exhume The Dead To Take Part In My Collection
A Gallery Of Gore
Reflecting Recollections
Dried Corpse-Mache
I Thrive On Decay
I'm A Malpractitioner
Invoked By Your Apathy

Recreative Art
Corpses Pulled Apart
This Is My Delicatesse
Sullied By My Name
A Debauchery

Recreative Art...
Pulled Apart...

Atropine Injected To Clarify Which Matters
I Shall Deride And Deprive All Of Man
To Cleanse The World Is My Putrefactive Plan

This Is My Epiphany
Decaying Tapistry
Peeling To My Satisfaction
My Collection
Closer To Completion

Gutting And Slashing
Maiming And Hacking
Pulpifying And Dissolving With Ease

My Necrotic Urges Can And Never Will Be Pleased
Gutting And Slashing
Maiming And Hacking
Grind The Dead To A Gangrenous Mush
Recollected To Partake In My Canvas Of Death

Exhume The Dead To Take Part In My Collection
A Gallery Of Gore
Reflecting Recollections
Dried Corpse-Mache
I Thrive On Decay
I'm A Malpractitioner
Invoked By Your Apathy

Mankind And Apathy
Go Hand In Hand In This Garden Of Dismay
