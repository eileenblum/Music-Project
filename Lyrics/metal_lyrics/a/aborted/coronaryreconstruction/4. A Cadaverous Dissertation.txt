Through scabs and boils we chisel on...
A decrepit homage to unfold...

These wretched deeds we enumerate...
No artery untouched, no vessel un-drained...
Your noxious cadaver we investigate...
A novel of grotesque narrations...

Every sick detail documented...
By scalpel and blade I am fascinated...
A vagary of interest...
Lewd is our presentation...

This retched corpse we gladly dismember...
A rotting shrine, a puzzle to unfold...
Necrotic tissue vacillating...
We're fornicating science...

An odious ode â latent minutia, so perceivable...
Hypocratic oath conflicted â  effete urethra, despicable...

We exorcise our pestilent scorn, our deeds rejected...
Unfolding thesis too constrict, the judges malcontented...
How little do they know, abomination projected...
How little do they know, we are demented...

Practitioners stand in awe...
Through scabs and boils we chisel on...
A decrepit homage to unfold...

These wretched deeds we enumerate...
No artery untouched, no vessel un-drained...
Your noxious cadaver we investigate...
A novel of grotesque narrations...

This retched corpse we gladly dismember...
A rotting shrine, a puzzle to unfold...
We're fornicating science...

How little do they know, infamy projected...
How little do they know......

Cadaverous dissertation...
Pathological abomination...

Practitioners stand in awe...
Through scabs and boils we chisel on...
A decrepit homage to unfold...
These wretched deeds we enumerate...
A cadaverous dissertation...
