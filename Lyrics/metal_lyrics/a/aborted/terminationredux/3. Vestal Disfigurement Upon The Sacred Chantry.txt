I left her to bleed
Vestal Disfigurement upon the Sacred Chantry

Once upon the altar
Unholy masturbation
For pleasure defiled
And left for god to see

Deflowered urethra
Birthplace of sacrilege
Immaculate deception
Slow serrated rape

I am of god
I am of madness
I am of children
I am corrupt and holy

I am of man
I am the sinful
Devour the innocent
I am corrupt obscene
Bringer of travesty

Deflowered urethra
Birthplace of sacrilege
Immaculate deception
Slow serrated rape

Trapped in this living hell 
Of giving head
Tearing stains from soiled drapes
Lost in a haze of whore-y absolution
Divine constitution?

Trapped in this living hell 
Wishing for death
Tearing stains from soiled drapes
Lost in a haze of whore-y absolution
Divine constitution?

Emissary
Wretched cunt
Holy Mary
Blind, distraught

I am of god
I am of madness
I am of children
I am corrupt and holy

I am of man
I am the sinful
Devour the innocent
I am corrupt obscene
Bringer of travesty

Culture of lies demoralise
Preaching violence and guilt to the blind
A soul of mistrust
Abusive and violent
Sacred cloth hiding a perverts gasp

A perverts gasp

Missionary
Wretched cunt
Holy Mary
Blind, distraught

Once upon the altar
Unholy masturbation
For pleasure defiled
And left for god to see

Lustful degrading mongrel
For the wicked
For we are blind to see 
Forever
