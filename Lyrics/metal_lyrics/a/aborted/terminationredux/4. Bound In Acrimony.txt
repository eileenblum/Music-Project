I cannot breathe, in this human cesspool
The odour of mass depression
Permeates the air with a gluttonous need

Brutalized by a mind-fucked society
Through their lies, they abide with little rancour
The corruption imbued

The stench of reflection
Fills the air with greed
I cannot wait to end these lives
A display of mediocrity

No guilt â no fear â no remorse
One by one become bound in acrimony
Killing â the cancerous feeling
Maiming â this underlying need
One by one you will all be exposed
A rotten carcass feeding of lives interposed

Melodramatic gestures bleeding the false
Hypocritical, religious sect of dying imbeciles
I will not rest until the rodents are entombed
Will you embrace your doom?

I cannot breathe, in this human cesspool
The odour of mass extinction
Permeates the air with a gluttonous need

Brutalized by a mind-fucked society

Through their lies, they abide with little rancour

The corruption imbued
All guilt â no peers
Manipulate â with fear
All guilt â no peers
Manipulate â with fear
