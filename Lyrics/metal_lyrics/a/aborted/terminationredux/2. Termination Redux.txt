Fetid and abhorrent, these fantasies I am having
Copious picturesque views of ending lives around me
Vermillion canvas â these fantasies I am living
Through human filth â miraculous views so vermillion and obtuse

Through their eyes, victimized
A grisly study in still life â voraciously nailed â a puddle of gore
The means to your pathetic end

Emaciated giblets rearranged on the floor â rotting
Some might find me deranged but I'm merely an artist
Bowels turn into vintage art
Caustic demigod, a Rembrandt of gore
Bowels turn into vintage art

Through their lives, idolized
Now a grisly study in still life
Voraciously nailed â attention seeking whores
Die on your pedestal

Fictitious and bored â more than you ever were
Now part of my body of art

"You are the scum of the earth, ambulant filth, self righteous and idle idolatry, societal degeneration."

You are the birthplace of disease
You are a cancer that feeds, breeds
No more than a sculpture that kneels, bleeds â contemporarily pleased

Through their eyes, victimized
A grisly study in still life â voraciously nailed â a puddle of gore
The means to your pathetic end
