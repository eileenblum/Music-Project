Through their eyes, decide their fate
Reminding me of the face I hate
Frustration, a common drug

Perversity brought by the one that gave me the 'gift' of life
Their fucking eyes, driving my acrimony

Oh, how I plead for extinction
You psychosexual, retarded cunts
Call me prophet of extirpation

I will bring you salvation
As I violate and defile
End you worthless existence
Feed the wrath within

Beating to pulp, adrenaline rushing,
Thrusting Eden into my veins
I pleasure none less than divine

Redeem yourself, prisine excitement
Atonement of the sins, the blood I shed
The excretion of an ingrate god

Through their lies, relentless rage
Reminiscence of the cunt I hate
Internecion, my daily drug

Perversity brought by the one that gave me the 'gift' of life
Their fucking eyes, driving my acrimony

No guilt, no remorse
No fake pretentions
For all the lives I've taken
For the concubines slain
Engorging recklessly
This path of gore and debris
Misogynic carnage

Relive the first kill, over and over again
Continuous bloodshed to purify her lie-spreading throat
With goreastic entrails I am adorn

No guilt, no remorse
No fake pretentions
For all the tramps I've buried
For the concubines slain
misogynic carnage

Redeem myself, pristine excitement
Atonement of the pleasure, the gore I spread
The excretion of a butchered cunt

Psychotic bereavement of the ecstasy I crave
