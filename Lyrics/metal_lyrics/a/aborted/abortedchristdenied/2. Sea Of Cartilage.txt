Murder
Into the basement
My own private morgue
Necrotic restants are left to devour
I will not rest Until I've killed you all

Lunacy erupts from the world you breed
Nothing more than pustules &amp; crude organic waste
Mayhem indulging my hall of gore
I will not rest until you hang on my wall

Left in my sea of cartilage... I'm draped in blood

Severed head as ornament - my collection of the dead
Punctured cranial walls collapse - filled with acid, my aphrodisiac...

Slicing the meat, on your restants I feed
Slicing the meat, genitalia are what I need...
I have such sights to show you, beyond your boundaries
Nothing more than a pile of waste, the human race
Was destined to fade... Murder...
