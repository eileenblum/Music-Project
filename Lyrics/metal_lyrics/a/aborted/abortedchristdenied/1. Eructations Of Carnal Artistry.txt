Random torture, suffer for my needs
Slicing and cutting, submit to my torment

Pierced with nails, reincarnated puppet vacillating
On the verge in a blaze of gory
Moulding the eructations of my carnal artistry...

Gathering the insides, winnowing inferior guts
I sever and dismember, hack fervidly with gasping cuts
Fleshtised... Cuts...

Muscular limbs, a perfect casket, how fanatic can I get?
Different corporal parts, agglutinated with suture
From a delusion to a morbid stature
Rashes of skin, stitched from within
I'm pulling the strings, resurgence spreads its wings

Veins are dangling, bloody chunks, bloody chunks  exfoliate
Its countenance purses, the artifact expectorates...
My creative is urge fed by engineering the dead

Excessive gore is what I need... to nurture my carnarstistic need
