Reality drenched my miscarried life
Dementia seeps in, irrevocable
The gods have once spoken to me

A new race I will create
I am the seed of misery
Spawned of fraudulent filth

Of scabs and boils
Dehumanized, ostracized this emetic pain
Demoralized, nullified, insanity reborn

Deranged? Delusional psychose
The gods have once spoken to me

A new race I will create
Hypocrite larvae shall propagate

We are the walking dead
Our sanity has bled
Stone cold, defunct, forlorn
Abomination of all things
Stone cold, defunct, forlorn
The world, my rotten seed
We are the walking dead
Our apathy has spread

It is to be with man before crying out: let there be death
It is to be with man when our spirit moved into the dark
It is to be with and and filth he created in his image
It is to be a god to take what is your and end it all

Reality drenched my miscarried life
Dementia seeps in, irrevocable
I will reclaim what was taken from me

A new race I will create
I am the seed of misery
Through scabs and boils I propagate
