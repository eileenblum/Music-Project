blessed be the ones who show no remorse
the lecherous mongrels that serve your cause
to worship and idolize a pile of decay
to rob infertile minds of any sense of reality
your fraudulent joke exposed

where is your savior
a deceit so picturesque and pertinently skewed
like a vulture you prey on the weak
the culmination of hypocrisy

lies upon lies, upon lies, upon lies
haven't centuries of bullshit been enough
nothing but crud in retrospect
the blessing you have left
our father who art of feces

the rich get richer, the poor poorer
haven't centuries of torment been enough
nothing but shit in retrospect
the curse you have left
are father who art of feces
where is your fucking savior
where is your savior now

for he brings damnation
a reality so disconnected and permanently screwed
like a vulture you prey on the week

the culmination of all thy greed
lies upon lies, upon lies, upon lies
haven't centuries of bullshit been enough
nothing but crud in retrospect
the blessing you have left
our father who art of feces
