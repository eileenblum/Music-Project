Poetry in motion
A quiescent movement in my bowels
An unrelenting thirst for this fecal forgery

Inundated with revolting matter
This succulent banquest of drud and gore
The playful joy of fecal batter
As I am engulfed in excremental charm

I did nothing, I smell nothing
Terrorized by this fumy hors d'oeuvre

This fecal forgery
Befouling my decency
In festering excretions I rest
This succulent banquet of nectarous chyme
I suffocate and gasp
The purfum of the dead, in my ass lies to rest
Oh holy puzzle of manure
I piece together with grand rigor
All that rotting fumes beget
A colonic arrest

Peotry in motion
A quiescent movement in my bowels
An unrelenting thirst for this fecal forgery
This fecal forgery
Befouling my decency
