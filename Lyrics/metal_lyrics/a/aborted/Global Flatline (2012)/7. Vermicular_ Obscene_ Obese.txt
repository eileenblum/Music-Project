In death I find affection
parasitic abomination

gnashing - gluttonous- appaling

vermicular, obscene, obese

horridly detrimental, a sordid and foul obsession
necrotic fixation of what's igonimously mine

vermicular, obscene, obese

a delicatesse for me to gorge
your exsanguinted stump is my fillet pur

nutritously infernal, a banquet of tepid flavors
necrotic fixation of what's perversly mine

gluttonous, appaling
the gargling pleasure of rotten brew
you are my savoir, my plat de jour
eviscerate, debilitate, such pleasure
you rotting sack in my anal tract
the gargling pleasure of your rotten brew
the afterbirth no more tha a nefarious fume

In death I find affection
gnashing - gluttonous- appaling
vermicular, obscene, obese
crepitated bowels move in disgust
a mere victim of my carnal lust
