Come forth my children - Walketh the path to heaven
All our lives are betrothed - To the one savior of all
Your shepherd wants to see you bleed

Feed upon my rancor - I am a psycho predator
All your lives are betrothed - To the biggest lie of all

Come forth my children - I will show you true pleasure
All your lives are lost - To the biggest farce of all

God almighty - you can call me David
Bathe in my ideology

Restless torment I feed upon the weak
So slow, their minds too feeble to resis
Kneel before your shepherd as you take your life away

Restless mongrel, cease to exist
A sullied paradise, behind a barage of lies

Feed upon my rancor - I am a psycho predator
All your lives are betrothed - To the biggest lie of all

Come forth my children - I will show you true pleasure
All your lives are lost - To the biggest farce of all

Swallow my seed - the body of Christ
A drip from your lips - this nectar divine
A folly to most, yet a necessity
The church of the insane

For I am David - For I am He
For I am Koresh - bow before me
Some call me criminally insane
With blood on my hands I desecrate
Through the power of Christ I compel thee
Some call me the Lord incarnate
With a load in your mouth, I celebrate
Through the power of lies, I deceive thee
