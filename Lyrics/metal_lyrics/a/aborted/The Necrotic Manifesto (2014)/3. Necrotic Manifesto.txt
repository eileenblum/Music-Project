A work of art, my collection of rot
A rotten census, manifest of the damned

Sordid formulae of harvesting the dead
Mentally degrading, socially perverted
Six feet of foreplay towards my needs

Archived decay - necrotic manifesto
Decrypting semiology
This book of the dead, a symposium indeed
Celebration of flesh and bone
My fascination is far gone

The scriptures of the dead satisfy my curiosity
So fascinating, so captivating
Enigmatic paths to rigor mortis

A collage of deterioration
Macerated limbs are dislodged
Upon tissue I viciously gorge
Celebration of flesh and bone
My fascination is far gone

Necrotic Manifesto - creating life after death
Proceed with my work - surreal necrotic rampage

A grisly work of rot
Decrypting semiology
This book of the dead, a symposium indeed
Celebration of flesh and bone
My fascination is far gone
