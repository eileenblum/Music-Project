Luscious fermented
beneath rorulent soil
a thin layer of compost 
between right and wrong
lugubrious insatiable 
a narrow pathway to insanity
a cold mephitic stiff
raising mahogany 
Coffin upon coffin
into the dead i shove my meat
Coffin upon coffin 
into a rotting heap 
malodorous liquid splashes
a brief moment of shame
such a cold mephitic stiff
i am so delightfully insane
Coffin upon coffin
beyond the grave i pack my meat
Coffin upon coffin
such a sloppy feast
malodorous liquid splashes
a brief moment of shame
such a cold mephitic stiff
i am so delightfully insane
Luscious fermented
beneath rorulent soil
a thin layer of compost 
between right and wrong
lugubrious insatiable 
a narrow pathway to insanity
a cold mephitic stiff raising pathuggens 
Incubated this rotting beef
Incubated my sausage bleeds
incapacitated this putrid meat
eradicated insatiable needs
Incubated my sausage bleeds
incapacitated this putrid meat
eradicated insatiable needs
Coffin upon coffin 
i'm a necromaniac
Coffin upon coffin
my utopia
Coffin upon coffin 
i'm a necromaniac
Coffin upon coffin
my utopia
