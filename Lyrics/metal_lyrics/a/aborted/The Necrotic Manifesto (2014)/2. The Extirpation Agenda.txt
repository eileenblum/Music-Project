The urge to kill drives me every movement
A plethora of visions plague my gray matter
With the swing of my axe I bring salvation

Exemplary butchery
I stalk my prey
Death envisioned picturesque
I am defiled at heart, I am decay
My sweet bliss
Exemplary butchery of those who stand before me
Total extermination of all I see as unholy
There will be no mercy
As I purify this world of shit

Bringer of the apocalypse
One by one I rid the world of filth
This is my final solution

Extirpation agenda
No separation between race and gender
Extirpation propaganda
I am the herald of death

The cranium exposed, with every savage blow
As you lie on my slab, decorticated at last
A contorted expression left from the peeling
Eyes torn from sockets and used in my brew
Your cadaver to appease my bidding
I am the herald of plague

Exemplary butchery - I am beyond the grave
I am the dead
I stalk my prey
Death envisioned picturesque
I am defiled at heart, I am decay
My sweet bliss
Exemplary butchery of those who stand before me
Total extermination of all I see as unholy
There will be no mercy
Watch me purify this world of shit

Extirpation agenda - extermination propaganda
Foul murder propaganda
Extirpation agenda
Foul murder propaganda
