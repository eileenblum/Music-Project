I can't control my animosity - Undeniable misanthropy
This unstoppable rage inside of me

Once torn from the womb
My tribulation commenced
With the swing of the hammer
I wil bring your existence to an end

Hatred everlasting - Murder is salvation
Turmoil of the wicked - Murder is salvation

I can't control my virtuosity - It comes easy to me
This unstoppable hatred within me

Once torn from the womb - My tribulation commenced
With the swing of the hammer - I'm bringing your end

Morbid human collage, a true display of art
Craving everlasting. To suture the dead
With grisly precision I model my creations
This sordid abattoir, a catwalk of cadavers
Craving everlasting, a true display of art

As I model my morbid creating
I see the beauty of murder
"you are nothing to me, an enumeration of cadavers
a lampshade at most, a cup to fill my dose
I can't wait for you to decompose"

Woe become of you if you will
Stand in my way of debauchery
As you stand perplex, at my crafty finesse
Admire the display of this rotting mess

I can't control my animosity - Undeniable misanthropy
This unstoppable rage inside of me

Once torn from the womb - My tribulation commenced
With the swing of the hammer - I will bring your existence to an end

Woe become of you if you will - Stand in my way of debauchery
As you stand perplex, at my crafty finesse
Admire the display of this rotting mess

Hatred everlasting - Murder is salvation
Turmoil of the wicked - Murder is salvation
