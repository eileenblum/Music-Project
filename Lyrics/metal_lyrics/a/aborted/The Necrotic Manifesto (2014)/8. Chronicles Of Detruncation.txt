A celebration of my perverted mind - Your carrion exposed
So calculated - my apparatus gesticulate
Detruncated - your body, a sight to behold
Fueled by disgust, by childhood foretold
A mere corpus, noxious usurper of body parts
A celebration of my perverted mind - Your carrion exposed
These chronicles of detruncation
Your innards disposed

So calculated - your date has expired
Exfoliated - why don't you stew in my brew?
Churned innards
A delicacy so refined
I am the grand chef
The orchestrated conductor of your demise

Fueled by disgust, by childhood foretold
A mere corpus, noxious usurper of body parts
Pedigreed - an untimely demise for your breed
As you stew in my pot, your insides boil and rot
A marmalade of post-human glot

Chronicles of Detruncation
Now rot - recipes of human ordure
Nothing left but your bits to consume

Chronicles of Detruncation
Now rot - recipes of human ordure
Nothing left but your bits to consume
A tasteful consumme with croutons
Your phallus a moldy goulash
