[feat. Phlegeton]Hallowed by thy dung - A fecal tour of fortune
Sifting through mysteries of brown delight
Predicting future guided by excrements
Shallow by thy dung - The truth lies within rectum
Bowing down to the porcelain god
I am anxiously fishing for more predictions

Excremental veracity - We shall bow down to turd almighty

Oh holy crap - Once from the pooper now shall be heard
This pungent mess - The whole wheat shaman of death

Show me the light, from true vision I am bereft
An organic puzzle of methane to behold at last
To behold full breath

Now comes the fever, a true believer - Epiphany through solid waste
Through holy feces, a true reliever - Epiphany from this septic tank

Excremental veracity - We shall bow down to turd almighty

Oh holy crap - Once from the pooper now shall be heard
This pungent mess - The whole wheat shaman of death

I gain wisdom from every turd
My fecal visions shall forever be heard
