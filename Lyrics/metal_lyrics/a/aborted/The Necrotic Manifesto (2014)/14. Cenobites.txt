We have such sights to show you
A journey through the chasms of hell
Like artists painting on canvas
We toil with your flesh

A deafening rumble
Upon the solving of a puzzle
We will tear your soul apart

Oh sweet serenade of torture
As pleasure and pain unite
We become one, Cenobite

Tearing flesh from bone, desires are born
The spasms of orgasms uncontrolled

The reaping has begun - through pain and suffering I cum

Divine serrated torment - As heaven and hell unite
We will tear your soul apart
Oh blessed be this moment - Quivering so serpentine
We become one, Cenobite

Oh luscious torture
These little deaths I die all over
With hooks and chains torn apart
These little deaths are mere fine art

Cenobites - explorers of flesh
Cenobites - the wretched living dead
Cenobites - Emissaries of hell
Cenobites - Practitioners of eternal torment

Through flesh and bone, your life is forlorn, sadistic needs are reborn
The spasms of orgasms uncontrolled, through pain and suffering you cum
We have eternity to know your flesh, for we are death

Divine serrated torment - As heaven and hell unite
We will tear your soul apart

Oh blessed be this moment - Quivering so serpentine
We become one, Cenobite

Infernal seeker come find us, follow lines that were written in blood
We have no more surprises, we have eternity to know your flesh
