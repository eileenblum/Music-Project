[feat. Vincent Bennett from The Acacia Strain]Erratic rodent, arrogant nephilim
Worthless piece of shit, you are but crud to me
Through life you merely slither, like the serpent you are
Manipulating parasite, I can see right through your lies
Bullshit runs off your tongue like spit
No scrutiny spared from your imperious deceit
Your enititlement means nothing to me
Your bereavement means nothing to me
Through life you merely slither, like the piece of shit you are
Manipulating parasite, I can see you for who you truly are

I saw your world fall apart
I saw your world fall
Fastidious mongrel, this is your private holocaust
The purest form of hatred is what you found
What is left of your greed?
Nothing but misery

Bullshit runs off your tongue like spit
No scrutiny spared from your imperious deceit
Take your fucking mood swings and your pathetic ego
Go be the best at shoveling turds
Your entitlement means nothing to me
Suck it you fucking asshole
