Lustful glances entwining madness
Within rivers of saliva, an excruciating torrent
A desire within me, you are to be bound to please
You are bound to please
My desires come to pass
Squirming within shackles, I explore her flesh
Deep inside her Eden, I feast upon forbidden fruit
Her derriere fully in bloom

I am the wretched, I am a ghoul
A sexual cancer, I thrive on degout

Oh sodomy, sweet duodenal catastrophe
I am vulture, a predator - Sweet sensual misanthropy
For I am Sade, emissary of debauchery
Sliver in ache whilst from hymen you are torn
Lashing and gashing at Persephone
In the mouth of madness, innocence I devour

Libertine lunacy - feeding perversity
Libertine lunacy - gorge upon my seed

Quiver - pleasure and pain unite
Squirm - for I am bliss divine
Quiver - pleasure and faith divide
Torn - Innocence forever reviled

For I am Sade, Emissary of abundance
Squirming within shackles, I explore her flesh
Deep inside her Eden, I feast upon forbidden fruit
Her derriere fully in bloom

Oh sodomy, sweet duodenal catastrophe
I am vulture, a predator - Sweet sensual misanthropy

Libertine lunacy - feeding perversity
Libertine lunacy - gorge upon my seed
Libertine lunacy - feeding perversity
Libertine lunacy - vicariously you bleed

Quiver - pleasure and pain unite
Squirm - for I am bliss divine
Quiver - pleasure and faith divide
Torn - Innocence forever reviled
