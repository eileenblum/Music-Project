This barren wasteland, your utopia has died
Consumed by greed and lust
This is our final absolution, erased and burnt

This barren wasteland, a mere memory
Testament of failure and defeat
This is our final absolution, a hypocritical creed

Under rorulent soil, a mere bag of bones
Complete exsanguination of the human race
A pile of crud, nothing but walking dung
Complete excoriation of the human farce

Testimony of acrimony
Self loathing and absolute greed
Testimony of misanthropy
A manifesto of utter envy

This is our final solution

Man creates - man destroys
So is the way of the world
Man hates - man abhors
Recreation for the fallen one

Under rorulent soil, a mere bag of bones
Complete exsanguination of the human race
A pile of crud, nothing but walking dung
Complete excoriation of the human farce

Testimony of acrimony
Self loathing absolute greed
Testimony of misanthropy
A manifesto of utter envy

Ruins of man - a utopia in ruin

This barren wasteland, a mere memory
Testament of failure and defeat
This is our final absolution, a hypocritical creed

All we are - what we are
Parasites tearing the world apart
The final absolution
A zero tolerance solution
Parasites tearing the world apart
