We have a capacity for rapacity
This human condition
Bred into deception

Bred to believe manipulations
Forced to consume
Controlled for produce and blinded
Our grand depression

We have a capacity for redundancy
This demented affliction
Our grand depression

And exquisite farce, guiding my misanthropy
A myriad of "choices" in vapid world of abasement
Bred for extinction
Misanthropy within me, a reckoning force
On our path to extinction

We have the audacity and idiocy
An ignorant affliction
Bred for production
A ghastly farce of epic proportions
Loathsome and present
Bred to perfection

A myriad of "choices" in a vapid world of abasement
Bred for extinction
Misanthropy a reckoning force
On our path to extinction

Bred to believe manipulations
Forced to consume
Controlled for produce and
Blinded by a white fence utopia

Exquisite covinous drama
Nothing but tools, brainless fools
Exquisite covinous drama
Nothing but tools, mongrels, fools
Behold the stench of misery
Sweet bouquet of society
Result of apathy

We have the capacity for rapacity
This human condition
Bred for production
A ghastly farce of epic proportions
Loathsome and present
Bred in to perfection, bred for extinction
