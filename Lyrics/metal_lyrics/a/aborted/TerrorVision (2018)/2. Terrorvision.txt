Grotesque manic display of misery
Forfait values, refuge for vanity
Unholy masturbation
Self-inflicted drama
For the drama craving drama queens

Hold a mirror to society
A piss poor display of displaced narcissism
Wretched whores
Animus violence
Displaying animosity
Rancour distrust
Warmongering

Oh holy devastation
Divide and conquer
Spreading fear, hatred and disbelief
Hold a mirror to society
A perfect display of misanthropy

Obey the terrorvision
Demonic manipulation
Spreading hate
Spreading death
Fear

Praise the lord
Sever the whore
The masses want more

Bow to me
Oh nephilim
Emisarry of perversity

Praise the whore
Nu Babylon
The masses need more
Crawl for me oh idiocy
Emisarry of stupidity

Watch them crawl spineless
Opium for the masses
Watch them bleed for us
Religiously walking meat and erroneous pride

Unholy flagellation
Self-inflicted trauma
For the trauma craving trauma queens
Hold a mirror to your bigotry
A piss poor display of society

Manipulation of the masses at hand
Hate [x2]
Terrorvision
Sociopathic iteration

Manipulation through black mirrors at hand
Hate [x2]
Terrorvision
Psychopathic iteration

Hate
Fuelling the masterplan
Hate
Moving the pawns around
Hate
Our embodiment
Hate
Fuelling the masterplan
Hate
Blissfully ignorant
Hate
Our decadence
