Suffocating mess, this other Hell
So pragmatic, enigmatic

Nurtured by redundancy
We embrace this mental lobotomy
The apocryphal art of idolatry

Ignorance is bliss, catatonic state
So dogmatic, yet ecstatic - catastrophic

Eternal cowardice...
Maze of no return, your palaces burn
Claustrophobic,

Suffocating mess - reality
A cage of callousness

Nurtured by redundancy
We embrace this mental lobotomy
An apocryphal art

This stench of reality, crepuscular society dusk
As I suffer through this other Hell

Altro inferno - spirit of the dead
Altro inferno - machiavellian deceit
Altro inferno - the other Hell in me
Altro inferno

Altro inferno - spirit of the dead
Altro inferno - corrupted at best
Altro inferno - slithering so serpentine
Altro inferno

For I believe in Hell
Hell is other people
Dauntless descent to misery
Into this lobotomy
For I believe in Hell
Hell is other people
Claustrophobic maze of no return
Repulsive creatures

Altro inferno - spirit of the dead
Altro inferno - maze of no return
Altro inferno - slithering so serpentine
Altro inferno
