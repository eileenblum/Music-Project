Free my hate
Aching need to crave up woman
I'll rage their souls
Spastic gestures as I retract the saw

Spectral indoctrination of a superior mind
Well thought ematiation of the human kind
Worthless pile of crud
The stench of internal spunk
My knee deep in your menstrual blood
Relentless sight of gore

I penetrate your mind your thoughts pathetic being
I eliminate your flesh I am your god
Vomit type puss erupt from her pit
Pittoresque sculpture of bile
Degraded to road ornaments

I'll rape their hearts and souls
As for a drug I scream for more gore

I penetrate your flesh unbound by laws
I sever your soul
I humiliate and defile your skin
You'll beg for more
I split your intestines you're a body bag fill to me
Insane sexist bastard
My fist rests in your ass
