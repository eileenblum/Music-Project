Shovelling his way through the graveyard soil
Home of the deceased repository of vermin
Beads of perspiration are standing on his brow
Rutting glances in his bloodshot eyes
As he keeps on digging for the body in the ground

Taking the lit of the box a stagnant odour arises
Revealing, creaking and grating
The carrion of a disabled gorgon recently expired of
Putrefaction advanced leprosy and psoriasis this emaciated
Corpse shall fulfill my necrocoprolagnistic will

Gravedigger, slicing through the flesh
Rancid stench emerging from the wound
Ornaments necrotic utensil he dressed up in their skin
Transvestite in extreme squatting down raping the corpses

Lunacy stricken he lets down his pants
Slaveringly staring at the carcass

Gravedigger peeling of the skin
Ranic stench emerging from the wound
With surgical precision meticulous dissection
He squarts down raping the corpses
