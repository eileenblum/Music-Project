See â the waste
His rancid stinking spunk, sparkling in the moonlight
Torn apart by hooks, cerebral lobes are emerging
From the cavities, convulsive regurgitations of
Decomposed entrails
The reek of putrefaction
Corporate perditions fall upon thee
Bludgeoned to death
Suppurating liquids
I savour your skin

Extemporaneous exploration of
The mass beneath the skull
Countenance completely minced
The cranial skin is excoriated

Bulging eyes I pierce, scraping the cornea
Intersection of the carotid

Extirpation of the dying pile of puke
Excrescence of humanity, an organic cesspool
Androgynous propagation
Of my pathological murderousness
