Born into a life of degeneration
Societal deformity
Inept repression - Inherited abasement

Our common wealth debilitates us into depression
Abundant misery

Depending mongrels chasing a clock
Forged for decrepitude: the sum of man
We stand for:
Redundant catastrophe - Abundant misery

âLivingâ a life of misinformed, construed travesty
Our common stupidity their master-plan
Is this what you call a life? Alive?
Pathetic, apathetic - forever wrapped in chains
The feeling of never being awake
Prone to misery, we claim our throne of unjust
As we step foot in nothing
Is this what you call a life? Alive?

Our common idiocy debilitates us beyond redemption
Abhorrent reality - We are manâ¦ We are the end

Our common wealth debilitates us into depression
Abundant misery

Depending mongrels chasing a clock
Forged for decrepitude: the sum of man
We stand forâ¦.
