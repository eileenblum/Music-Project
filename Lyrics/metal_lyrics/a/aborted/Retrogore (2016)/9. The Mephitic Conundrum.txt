Malodorous, I defecate and consume - Te mephitic conundrum

A walking heap, colonic mystique - Gathering of shit
Walking human methane bomb - Ready to extinct
The common cancer known as man
Answering the greatest riddle of all
âHow much poop is too much poopâ
About 5 billion of them all.

Threading - Ridding - Killing - Maiming
As we destroy the world - Turn it into a heap of shit
As we destroy the world - Our fecal playing ground

We will never known peace

I am mesmerized that we are all still living
A steaming pile, the human excrement

âWith intestinal fortitude I am forced to digest,
the purulent crud that forms your carbon print
greedily amassing, by greed unsurpassing
Youâre all connoisseurs of rotâ
