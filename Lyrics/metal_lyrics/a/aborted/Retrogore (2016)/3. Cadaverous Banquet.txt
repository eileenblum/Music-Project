My horrendous concoction
Defaced and erased, a beastly corpus eloquently drained
Carbonated and flavored at will

Grinded, blended, a milkshake highly recommended
Necrotic nutrients decompose

Your body is mine for the taking
Shot thrice, cranium excavated
Delusional amour, your cadaver my shrine
Pleasure holes depraved,
by the relentless thrust of my blade

My sweet post-mortal fuck
Vintage of the damned - Succulent and frail
An eternal silence by canine extrement

Your is mine for the raping
Shot thrice, exsanguinated
Delusional amour, your cadaver my shrine
Pleasure holes depraved,
by the relentless thrust of my blade

Delicious gory banquet, Seved up to fill my needs
My appetite temporarily pleased - Bleed

Cadaverous Banquet - Vintage of the dead

Chase-ing my meat through her urethra
Mashed up to fulfill my needs
My perversion subdues indeed
Thrashing and grinding necrotic tissue
Your compost becomes my feast
A good vintage indeed
