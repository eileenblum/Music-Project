Divine Impediment
The cross penetrates, neuters and violates
My name is your restraint and order
Perturbed, force-fed, your body is mine to shred
I - a minister of corruption

By the leash, the bane and rod - I rend and trisect
Exacting the trinity of pain and perversion
As above, so below

By the lash, the hate and rot - I rend and trisect
Exacting the nihility of man and destruction
As above, so below

Strapped in a carapace - beaten into my image
Suffering in ecstasy divine, all mine
Praise the enlightened whore of Babylon
Suffering in ecstasy divine, all mine
Battered lamb, glorious pulp
By faith I justify my endless craves

A litany of stifled screams, gutted peaks so enticing
Hear this harmony
A litany of stifled screams, gutted peaks so enticing

Diving Impediment

Non interpretable dogma's slammed into your skull
Subject to our object - A faceless, invisible figure as lead
A terrible joke gone real and global
We picture fictional cunts (as our righteous alibi) to fuck the world
Our war is out - Our whores are out - Yet we're still in denial

By rejection I connect - To rein the inane - To reign the insane
