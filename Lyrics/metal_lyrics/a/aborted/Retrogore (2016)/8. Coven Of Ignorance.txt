Watch the mouth open
As the bullshit excretes
A coven of ignorance
Prophets we claim to be

Watch them eat it up, like rodents and pigs
Devouring misinformation so blatantly
Search for the truth, one click away
A myriad of theories just waiting to be spread

Conflicts breeding conflicts, for the sheeple to see
A myriad of fake sympathy waiting to be spread
Varmint, erroneous, an idiocracy
Sycophantic apathy, we suddenly care

Pretend to be righteous - Pretend to be clean
Warriors behind screens - Warriors of values
Pretend to matter - Pretend to be heard
Warriors behind screens
Societal catastrophe

Watch the mouth open
As the bullshit excretes
A coven of ignorance
Prophets we claim to be
Watch the world falter
As opinions decree
A coven of ignorance
Where everything offends me

Tools for Idiology - Bed for attention
I will watch the world burn

Watch the mouth open
As the bullshit excretes
A coven of ignorance
Prophets we claim to be
Watch the world falter
As opinions decree
A coven of ignorance
Where everything offends me
