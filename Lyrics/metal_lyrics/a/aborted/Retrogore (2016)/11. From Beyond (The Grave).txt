From beyond the grave
From the cradle to the grave
Following your life, bloodstained
Closer to death, so arousing
A whiff of formaldehyde as foreplay
Your eternal unrest, so amusing
From beyond the grave
Follow your gurney, cum-stained
Closer to me, so perverted
Rigor mortis - part of my horrorscope

Once upon the slab now in my bed

From beyond the grave
Now let us pray
From the cradle to the grave
Your body lies rotten
From the pleasures I have begotten
Your corpus my whore to enslave

Partake in my madness
My luscious cunt from the sepulchre
Pertain to my madness
My special cunt from the sepulchre

By death betrothed
To the grinding beef of my package
Your sullied rotten cave
A fantastical musky present
With every thrust I regain lust
Of sullied rotten cave enslaved
From the cradle to the grave

Your carcass - my grand amour
Molten out eye sockets my fuck du jour
Youâre my sexual plat de resistance
My freaky decomposing slut

Cum-stained - depraved
Your death I celebrate
Deeper and deeper
From the cradle to the grave

Now let us pray
From the cradle to the grave
Your body lies rotten
From the pleasures I have begotten
Your corpus my whore to enslave

Abrasive - disgusting
Many donât see the treasures Iâm beholding
A furious fuck - your final gift of life
Partake in my madness
My luscious cunt from the sepulchre
Pertain to my madness
My special cunt from the sepulchre

You are recked beyond the grave
