Knee-deep in hate I seethe
An abomination of man
The perversion of am
The burial of all thatâs sacred
Bi by bit - I strip your world apart

As I step forward
Into your world, you gluttonous glob
A walking heap of crud, the embodiment of sloth
Bit by bit religiously torn apart
As skin is stripped from bone
I refine my grand art

Resurging bloodlust
Human, redundant
We have been set up to fail

Returning, occurring
The savagery weâre evoking
We have been set up to kill
For the thrill

A global abattoir
No separation of race and gender
A moral abattoir
Like cattle to the slaughter

Knee-deep in rage you bleed
A mongrel of man - The reflection of all

Knee-deep in hate I seeth
An abomination of man
The perversion of am
The burial of all thatâs sacred
Bit by bit - I strip your world apart

Portent to the end of your life
Bit by bit, emaciated
We were all born ripe
Cretins for the taking

How meaningless is your life?
Bit by bit, classified
How pointless is it to fight?
Bit by bit, emaciated

Like sheep we follow the march
Put upon this earth, meaningless - Being born was just a curse

Bit by bit, the world cleansed - Born to murder the world
Bit by bit, the world feared - Born to slaughter you all

Knee-deep in hate I seeth
An abomination of man - The perversion of am
Bit by bit - I strip your world apart
