"In this world there is room for everyoneÂ 
and the earth is rich and can provide for everyoneÂ 
The way of life can be free and beautifulÂ 
But we have lost the wayÂ 
Greed has poisoned men's soulsÂ 
Has barricaded the world with hateÂ 
Has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed
We have developed speed but we have shut ourselves inÂ 
Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want
Our knowledge has made us cynicalÂ 
Our cleverness hard and unkind
We think too much and feel too littleÂ 
More than machinery we need humanity
More than cleverness we need kindness and gentlenessÂ 
Without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost
The airplane and the radio have brought us closer together
The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men
Cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all
Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world
Millions of despairing men, women and little children
Victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people
To those who can hear me I say "Do not despair"
The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed
The bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress
The hate of men will pass and dictators dieÂ 
And the power they took from the people will return to the peopleÂ 
And so long as men die [now] liberty will never perishâ¦
Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes
Men who despise you and enslave you, who regiment your lives
Tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel
Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder
Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men
With machine minds and machine hearts
You are not machines
You are not cattle
You are men
You have the love of humanity in your hearts
You don't hate, only the unloved hate
Only the unloved and the unnatural
Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty
In the seventeenth chapter of Saint Luke it is writtenÂ 
The kingdom of God is within manÂ 
Not one man, nor a group of men, but in all men, in you
You the people have the power"
[from Charlie Chaplin's Great Dictator's Final Speech]
