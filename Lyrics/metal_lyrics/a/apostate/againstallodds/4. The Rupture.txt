I'll write another cheap verseÂ 
To crown the pile on the floorÂ 
It might mean anything tonightÂ 
And no one needs to find outÂ 
I'll write another cheap verseÂ 
This is my last oneÂ 
I promise, I swearÂ 
I am sorry for letting you downÂ 
AgainÂ 
See, I'm just a man, who tries too hard to stand on his feetÂ 
Not falling on the kneesÂ 
That I forgot there is something above themÂ 

And something always kept me from sharing my dreamsÂ 
As if I dared to shape them with wordsÂ 
They would crumble away and leave me with fearÂ 
That I have been always running fromÂ 
When all of your deedsÂ 
Were re-assembled in sweat by me
I can't find a wayÂ 
To blame someone elseÂ 

To walk alone is to walk with honorÂ 
Because you won't be walking for long [x3]

Same old frail odeÂ 
To the pastÂ 
We are not raising glasses this time [x2]

I guess we all have a favorite roleÂ 
And what scares me the mostÂ 
Is that I found my ownÂ 
In the pursuit of a reason for deathÂ 
But if you don't have one, what's your life really worth?Â 

The heart above the headÂ 
The thing that counts the mostÂ 
When there's nothing left to geinÂ 
You walk awayÂ 
The heart above the headÂ 
The thing that counts the mostÂ 
When there's nothing left to geinÂ 
Be honest
