We've burnt the brightest of our mindsÂ 
For the sake of being equalÂ 
In a flock of moaning sheepÂ 
And now we're waiting for the leaderÂ 

When we've let the nails of fearÂ 
Drive into our heads so deepÂ 
That it almost felt like loveÂ 
At least we made ourselves believeÂ 

But I still can't get
No I still don't knowÂ 
Why after all these yearsÂ 
We still need someone to sufferÂ 
For our mistakes
In the name of our futureÂ 
Like they haven't paid enough
In the past for us in presentÂ 

And three words of the truthÂ 
Still cost us thousands of livesÂ 
And if this is your homeÂ 

THESE ARE YOUR PEOPLE

Is there something but liesÂ 
You have left for your children?Â 
Can you take the blameÂ 
Can you take the blame for thoseÂ 
Who remain unforgiven?Â 

You were scared that we would rememberÂ 
All of your crimes proclaimed as the featsÂ 
You can bury every bone
Scatter words to lettersÂ 
Burn every broken home
But you can't steal the promiseÂ 
Made by the mother in front of metal doorsÂ 
Her greatest fear after the biggest lossÂ 

HOW CAN WE DARE TO FORGET?
HOW CAN WE DARE to forget?

HISTORY IS MADE by the cries of the lost generationÂ 
HISTORY IS MADE by the ink that colored the sheets with frustrationÂ 
HISTORY IS MADE by the years of courage and hopes of the childrenÂ 
HISTORY IS MADE by the ones who refused to let it be written
