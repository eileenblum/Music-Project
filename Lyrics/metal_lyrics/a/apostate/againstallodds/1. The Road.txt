[french speech]

Empty days and endless roadsÂ 
One team away from what you call homeÂ 
One dream away from what you call loveÂ 
Can you call this a life when we called it all off?Â 
You can put your money but we've put our faithÂ 
We will be gone soon, the word will stayÂ 
You think you found strength in the numbersÂ 
Well, I see nothing but fear and violenceÂ 
Open your eyes, step up and listenÂ 
This path has no end as long as we're breathingÂ 
They call us apostate and you are the reasonÂ 
We've omitted the "y" and made this our cityÂ 
To all unbelievers - we stand in the nameÂ 
Of your every wrong turn
Of your every mistakeÂ 
And not that it matters but we went against every oddÂ 
Your mind can possibly think ofÂ 

This world is ours
