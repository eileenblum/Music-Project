Your soft white face, as cold as ice
You died from me, dark angel, and now you suffer in eternal hell

Eternal hell

It was only one deep kiss, your blood fills my every need
Soon will I join you my love, my angel I bleed for you
So burn for me
Nocturnal spirit rinse my soul, dress me with the coat of mortality

Mortality

In the dim light of the dusk
I will forever sleep in earth
As the warm wind blows, and is whispering of love and of stolen life
The music dies away, the wine is all empty
As I now wear the funeral dress

Dark angel, I taste your blood, death's shadow dances for me

As I call for you, death shadow, dance for me, and grant me mortality
And finally, you're mine for eternity

Dark angel, I taste your blood

She dances for me an erotic dance, so full of life, and with romance
You were there for me to keep, the nocturnal spirit sent you to sleep

Sent you to sleep

Please let me join you there, and release me from my spell
Or I will forever in this dark and evil dwell
As she dances for me an erotic dance, so full of life and with romance
You were there for me to keep, but the nocturnal spirit sent you to sleep

Darkness comes as snow falls on your grave

Now I wear my funeral dress
In the dim light of the dusk
