Mourning, silent rain, will light my burden, endless is my hunger, my paths so dark
After all these years living in vain
I am disillusioned, without an aim, close my eyes, run scared away

Drowning in a lake of tears
My soul fly away into deep
Running from life, saving me from a dark mind

The wood so cold, the silent shrine, so silent. (The eternal) resting place for my mind
Helpless am I, walking down into the depths of the night
With no light ...in My mind... I'll leave all life
No turning back for me, my way to doom
To doom

This is the end of me, bringer of darkness and sanctity

Where are you now?
Can't hear you now
Can't see you now

Where are you now?
Can't hear you now
Can't see you now

I need to feel you now
Bring me the light
Now my sorrow turns to hate
You're the one to blame

I hate you

Lying in the silent shrine forever
I rip of my skin to get deeper within my pain
Deep in my soul, I tear off my flesh

A sea of stars above me
A funeral life in front of me
My eternal life in sorrow
In shadows I'm alone
No afterlife
This is my home
In the shadows of the damned
