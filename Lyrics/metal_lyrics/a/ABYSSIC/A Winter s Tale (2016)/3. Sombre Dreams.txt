Fear now my hunger for flesh, feel now my hands bringing death
I am the bringer of doom, your life will end very soon
I am the bringer of doom, your life will end very soon

No Regrets, just lust for more

Fear now my hunger for flesh, feel now my hands bringing death
I am the bringer of doom, your life will end very soon
No more will you get to see, the light and serenity
I am the bringer of doom
Death

Darkness fills my soul, no regrets, just lust for more

Stench of fear, human blood, empty eyes and wasteland
Animal lust, true desire, bestiality from within

Come forth my child, I will feed on thee, I am the bringer of god

Seeking sorrow, feeding on pain, this entity so much in vain

Come forth my child, I will feed on thee, I am the bringer of death

Darkness fills my soul, no regrets, just lust for more
Seeking sorrow, feeding on the pain, this entity so much in vain

Seeking sorrow, feeding on pain, this entity so much in vain

Come forth my child, I will feed on thee, I am the bringer of pain

Fear now my hunger for flesh, feel now my hands bringing death
I am the bringer of doom, your life will end very soon

Darkness fills my soul, no regrets, just lust for more
Moon is full, blood red flesh

Stench of fear, human blood, empty eyes wasteland

No more will you get to see, the light and serenity

I am the bringer of doom
