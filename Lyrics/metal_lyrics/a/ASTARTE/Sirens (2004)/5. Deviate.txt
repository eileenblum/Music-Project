I roll on shadow sphere
My will is out of fear
Pain, hate and lust
Truth is where you crass.

Torture Trap
My inner-break
Swallow fear
Of mind.

Deviate/Violence Erase
Deviate/Violence Break
Deviate/Invocate
Deviate/Accept your fate

I roll on shadow sphere
My will is out of fear
Pain, hate and lust
Truth is where you crass.
Plug their minds twist them till they die.
Darkness of my Fate
Deviate
