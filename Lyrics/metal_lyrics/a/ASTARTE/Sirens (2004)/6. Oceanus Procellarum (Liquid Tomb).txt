Inside my vision, raise again, my ego
Forever escape my fate
I summon the end of skies
What falls, raise my fear

Arise from Hell
Through the depths of the earth
Summon the dead
From this graveyard earth

Oceanus Procellarum
Clouds are gather
Upon horizon
Shades and shadows around
Sea remakes it's heavy loud

Oceanus Procellarum
Thunder lighting
My darkest soul
A near death experience
My senses fade away.

Seeking a sign of existence
Through the years of pain
Gather the masses of unborn
To regain my fate.
