Mourn the silence again
Sic your fate as I rise,
Blaze tears and grace
Karma shows the end

Nightfall shadows, Death embraced
Awakes human fear

Arise Spirits of Dead
Awakes the shadows of Hell

Nocturnal maze of death
Creeping bodies
Sound of silence, arise

Outbreak, burn my mind
Madness, Dark inside.
Outbreak, Motherfucker die
Outbreak, time to face the pain.

[Epilogue:]
Wide open delusions of unconscious
Blackness already trap me inside
Release temptations and unger
What left shall generate the future
