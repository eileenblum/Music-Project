Demonized
Demonized
Fire in her eyes
Her beauty hide the signs
She devil female disguise
Innocence has died
Born of fire, spawn of Evil
Dwelt down in to her mind
Nothing sacred from her treason
All is lost from her denial
Demonized in to your soul
Sacrifice to things unknown
Demonized from the spirits of Hell
Suffering that will never be end
Demonized in to your soul
Sacrifice to things unknown
Demonized from the spirits of Hell
Suffering that will never be end
