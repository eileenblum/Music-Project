Sleeping surrounded by angels who cry
Falling to eternity never to lie
Seeking for answers to those who have died
Faking remembrance a demon has cry
Bury your nightmares to a fire of pain
No one can see you while you fade away
Time is deceiver and none can lie
Hope is a shelter to those who have tried
Burn the night feel the heat
Feel alive bleed for me
Burn the night feel the heat
Feel alive bleed for me
Burn your mind in your memory
Feel no fear set me free
Heart of flames burn for me
In your eyes I can,
I can see
The fear within
Close to me and,
And never give in.
