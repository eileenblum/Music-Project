Sent down to this world filled up with hate
His fate bound with men as there are his slaves
Worst than death
How life can become
Weak suffer from pain
Deep inside their hearts
Fear me now
Lay down and be silent
No remorse at last
Spiral madness
All my past
He came down
Bow on your knees
Shield your mouth
And fear him now
His name roots of words
Which have no mean
Deathless fear of a man
Reborn in this earth
Erased from his pain
Never forget what we've done
God among men,
Black release from the skies
Heavenly cursed demonic disguised
God among men
Try get free from the signs
Never salvation
Damnation will rise
God among men
Cross the lines of Hell
Bury my dreams
Melt on my signs
God among men
Frozen darkness my end
Power of pain
Cause nothing remain
I am the way
Bow on your knees
Shield your mouth
And fear him now
He is the way
Bow on your knees
Shield your mouth
And fear him now
