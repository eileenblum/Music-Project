[Feat. Attila Csihar]

Born of suffering
Cursed by the moon
Moonspell creature
Nightmarish look
Jaws of hatred
Blood from his eyes
Scream in his head
Speak them to die
Jaws of hatred
Blood from his eyes
Scream in his head
Speak them to die
Trapped among worlds
In the wood seeking a sign
Staring eyes
Leap of faith
Believer of wolf
Unknown creation
Suffering doomed
Lycon
Silver bullet can stop him now
Lycon
A misery index for things unknown
Lycon
Chained by the lunar night
Lycon
Our blood will flow once again
