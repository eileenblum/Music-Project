Into this world something is hunting me
Searching for shelter in despair
Follow the steps in to the muddiness
Altar of madness in her face
In the heat of the night
In the fear of the dark
Someone spin me a trap
Feel the hatred down my spine
Seeking endless for a sign
Black at heart nothing to find
All is vain into my mind
Can you ever wonder why
In a world which full of lies
Nothing left but you remain
Lost in a world of fear
Take away my pain
Lost from the true belief
The way which I feel
Lost in a world of lies
Where nobody cares
Nothing to loose or win
Lost in the dark
