[Feat. Henri Sattler]

Hellcome to the land of the dead
Truth dies here and reborn somewhere else
Feel the tension to the back of your head
Seek down for something which is died away
Rapid downfall passed from abyss seeking answers
Always in vain
Truth is hateful nothing shame full rapid downfall
Straight to Hell
Truth is hateful nothing shame full rapid downfall
Straight to Hell
Rapid downfall passed from abyss seeking answers
Always in vain
Sphere of nightmares, dreams of passion
Dreams so shameful, gilts may come true
Sphere of nightmares, dreams of passion
Dreams so shameful, gilts may come true
I become the queen of the damned
You become the king of undead
Thy kingdom always in pain
