Locked in a cage
Blood red the skies
Tears of disposal
Tears for fear
Mouth of madness
No time to cry
Poison lips
Shield my mouth
In the dark I hear my thoughts
Someone please unlock me now
In the dusty cellar door
Just let me out of here
In the dark where nobody hears
With my nails I scratch the walls
All is lost within these walls
Set me free down from this hole
God I hate them all
I'm dying in this fucking world
God I hate them all
A suffering which never ends
God I hate them all
Tortured in this fucking world
God I hate them all
No love is lost
