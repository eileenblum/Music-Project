Hanging upon the wind
Such as the world never know
The ancient tragedy and drama
Watch under their sharpen eyes
To see what a mortal is unable to see
A kingdom wrapped around cloud's veils

Gods look down from the Olympian kingdom
Challenge fates, wars and history
Disguised in sounding tones

Hold the arrows of desire
Reign unfold!
Takes me to the chariot of fire
Find in the night
The deep pulsation of mother earth
