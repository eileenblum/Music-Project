A gruesome scene
Avert your eyes, sweet girl, this was never supposed to be!
We are dealing with a monster
We cannot falter now
Alert the city (Run, run, ring the bell)
Our killer is still prowling the streets waiting to pounce

Such a tragedy
Who are we to hunt, to kill, to blame?

The Witch in the Forest
The people are scared of what they do not know
They'll blame druidic forces
The frightened will fight and the brave will follow in tow

Enter the trap of the red mage alchemist
The Ritual has begun
Enter the void of a parallel plane
In a black hell that you cannot escape

We are dealing with a monster
We cannot falter now
I'll control the city, all the people, and the lands

Enter the trap of the red mage alchemist
The Ritual has begun

This kingdom calls to me it's saviour
In my dreams a vision I've foreseen
Once I take the crown I'll conquer
A fiery wasteland for all to see
