An ancient evil has awakened (brought forth by the witch in the forest)
Roused by the assassination of our late king
No typical man could perform such horrors
But a servant of the witch (who sold his soul for eternity)

In the forest just beyond our walls dark forces gather
Bring forth the dagger used to kill the king
Here is proof the seed has been planted
Blackened hearts might beat right next to you

Or belong to you, controlling your every move
I have been chosen by rule of the gods
To purge this land
I am your new king

I am your new king
Bow to me
Vengeance will be swift
Blood for blood and purge by fire

An ancient evil has awakened
Roused by the sacrifice to my dark patron
No typical man could perform such horrors
Only a servant of the witch

I am the serpent
Only a servant of the witch
Could embrace blackness from within
Every time I close my eyes
Staring back at me: ancient demons

I belong to you, controlling your every move
I have been chosen by rule of the gods
To purge this land
I am your new king

I am your new king
Bow to me
