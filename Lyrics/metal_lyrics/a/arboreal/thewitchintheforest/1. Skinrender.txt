Cutting, slashing, rending
Hacking and heaving this shell
Skinrender

Body split open, entrails wrapped around the neck
Tied like a noose
I am the bringer of a justified death
Your ghost can never haunt me

Where there is death, I bring you life

I cannot imagine a different way
Skinrender's calling a blessed curse upon me

All bow
Prepare to feel
Oh my crime scene, so beautiful
Red painted across your eyes
I am blinded by such beauty
This one will go down in history

Cutting, slashing, rending
Hacking and heaving this shell
Skinrender
