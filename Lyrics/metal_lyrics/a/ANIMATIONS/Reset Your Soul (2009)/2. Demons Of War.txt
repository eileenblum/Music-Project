Time passes by
Thought I'd soothe my soul
I haven't though
I don't feel the same
It's hell inside
With every shot
Heavens die
Darkness fills the skies
They made me fight
Made me take lives
Kill with a stone cold face
They made me fight
Run and hide
Stay alive
Keep a rifle by my side
I'm not allowed to choose
Another point of view
Night and day
Sun and rain
Feel the blood pump through my veins
Unconsciously subdued
Why am I so confused
They made me fight
Endless devotion
Sudden emotion
Buried in silence cries
Do as you are told
Never whine or moan
You'll never question your orders
Army is your home
Gun is all you'll own
Inside a battle you're all alone
Do as you are told
Never whine or moan
You'll never question your orders
Army is your home
Gun is all you'll own
You gotta know that
You are a demon of war
Face to face
Arm to arm
Eye to eye
Play with fire
Feel no pain
War's my game
Fear I've tamed
Survival is my aim
