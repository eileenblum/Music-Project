Why I feel this way
Fear of future days
What I feel inside
Force majeure
Someone by my side
Keeps me sane
You are my truth
Am I the only one
Who wants to see your face
I stare towards the skies
To figure out your ways
A chance to feel at peace and free
Catch the time and don't let go
Every moment feels so strong
Like it never had
Before I struggled with each day
And wind would blow straight to my face
I worried then
What happens when
Everyone
For whom I lived
One sunless day
Will leave without goodbye
I feel unsafe
I'd like to know
Will You help me stand up high
Let me cross the fire
Put a stop to my cries
Let me stumble on heaven's smile
One ray of light to realize
Hope
Never dies
