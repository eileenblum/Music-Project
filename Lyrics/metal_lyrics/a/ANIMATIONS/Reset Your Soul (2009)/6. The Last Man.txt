My friends just left me
There's no one here
I'm all alone
Really hard to understand
Hard to explain
Really hard to realize
Never felt what I feel now
I think I'm afraid
I want to wake
Leave all behind
I want to find a way
To follow like cats do
I will keep
Keep on running
Running faster
Until I lose my breath
And this cruel
Cruel empty town
Be the last on Earth
It scares me
Like darkness scares the kids
I'm crossing streets
Hearing my heart beat
Seeking someone in a panic
Someone just like me
Just real, standing here
Whom I can touch with my fingers
To believe
Nobody to talk to
Nobody to complain
Nobody who'd help make my soul clean
I don't know what to do
I feel that one false move can break me down
Can break me down
The only thing comes to mind just run away
Without leaving tracks in the mud
I never wanted to break
I never wanted to feel this way
I keep on crossing
Holding my heart
Looking for someone like me
Like I am
Never wish to be the last man
Your dreams may come true
Every word you say may come real
Always think twice
Power that you have and space around you
Can be not enough to let you win
Not losing all
Not losing you
Losing me
