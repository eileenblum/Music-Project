Do we have to even take it
When empty words feel just like flames
Why the hell do we even bother
We cannot keep them far away
Why every word is never final
Seems like we're wandering in a fog
Why is it hard to try to fight them
Those cyberpsychos we all know
Those words have never made nobody smile
They burn and sting over and over
Is this some kind of "see me, help me" cry?
Are you some kind of new age showman?
Hero
Behind the cable
Fingers
Full of anger
Cyber toxic
Venom
Safely
Behind the wall
Hidden
From the outside
Delusions of
Grandeur
It's a mark of times
Spreading stupid lies
It doesn't make no sense
Who's to blame
Leave those lads alone
Always let things go
They will keep coming back so
Care no more
Have no respect
Hate
Rage
Wrath
Anger
Pain
Cry
Harm
Sorrow
