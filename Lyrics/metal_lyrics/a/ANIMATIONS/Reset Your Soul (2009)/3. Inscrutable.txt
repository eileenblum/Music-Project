Sun goes away
Night wins over day
People are running scared
I'm on fire
Fate is to blame
Cannot fight with myself
Panic runs through my veins
I'm on fire
Maybe I'll find
A way
To be free
Like an open space
Want to feel
Want to cry
Want to feel frail
I can feel it rise again
Hunger blinds what's left inside me
One step away
I felt this candied taste
One final move
What have I done again
Why once again
I have lost my chance to change
The beast within me
Spat straight to my face
Now, now I know
I might never be alone
Live each day
While this demon finds its prey
Wait
I can try to change
Try to change my life
Die and leave yourself behind
Forever free my mind
And let me fix my soul
Now I've come to realize
My enigmatic life
Is filthy, sick and low
Silence in my head
I'm not filled with dread
I feel numb and it's all over
Dreams are bright again
Mind is strong and sane
I've been freed from all this horror
What is wrong with me
Maybe it's not real
I cannot take it
Someone rescue me
It was not a dream
I feel like caving
There's no way I'd live as two forever
I won't be a part of this endeavor
Don't want to hide my face
Destiny's won the fight
I feel weak inside
Time to set me free
Face now it's time to face
This wretched fate of mine
Go time to go
I must find another home
Yes I'm prepared
To run away
Leave the flesh and soul
Yes I must go
Disappear
I can't see another way
