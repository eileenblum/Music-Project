Real fades
Seems like all this is fake
So vague
Disillusioned in all ways
Blinded by the state of things
It's hard to see the truth
It's a world filled with hate and fury
It's a world where nothing like it's supposed to be
It's a world where lifes are on display
It's a world where no one knows your name
Deprivation
It's a world where only cash is praised
Reset your soul
It's a world where everything's for sale
Maybe time has come to finally recognize
You cannot seize the days
Until this chase is over
You're trapped inside this vicious maze
You're struggling for your breath
Every day you're growing older
Your only way to free your life is to reset your soul
Tell me do you like the road we've taken
Life is a sum of mistakes
There must be something deep down
You have to find out your way
It's a world where freedom is enslaved
Reset your soul
It's a world where reason's locked away
Maybe time has come to finally find out why
