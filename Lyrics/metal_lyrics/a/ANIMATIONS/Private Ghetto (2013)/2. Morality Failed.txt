Careless life given on a silver plate
Illusory conviction that you're more than great
Money has no value since it's always there
Your inner vision has been impaired

Somehow, it will not ever change
You'll choose the easy way
No sweat, no tears, no sand thrown
Into your open eyes
You've set a foul game
That doesn't know fair play
Tell me explain me
Where the fuck's your shame?

Sticky hands, briefcases filled with cash
You always end up with the bigger stash
One for me five and six for you
Under the streetlight no one has a clue

It's the way
You act
That sickens me
Your rotten morality failed
Spoiling the bunch
Parasitizing healthy cells
It sickens me
It sickens me

You always speak using the edge of knife
On his anxiety your ego thrives
No keys are needed to open any door
Grab what's inside and leave him on the floor
