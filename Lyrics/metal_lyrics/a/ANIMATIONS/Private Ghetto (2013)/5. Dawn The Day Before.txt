Endless escape, a path with no aim
Isolation of the transience
Trampled in my weakness
I'm born and killed every day

Time comes!
We all have a time and place
Truth be told!
We all have a role to play
Believe it!
We're all a part of an opus
We don't know it's there

Insanely, internally
Like a stone tied to my neck
I poke the thought that's trying to help
I cannot reach for its hand

Time comes!
We all have a time and place
Truth be told!
We all have a role to play
Believe it!
We're all a part of an opus
We don't know it's there

Now
Losing pain I cry for myself
Now
Open a solid heart
Now
I'm tired but hope for rebirth
