Behold, my enlightenment
To your rhetoric
And in retrospect
I say behold a new Testament
Based on Evidence
So that the fears of man
May be justified

And so, where do we go from here?
Shall we live in fear
While these puppeteers
Control our lives

And all that "god" has done
Is what you've done for you
And god will forever be
The chosen image of our time

And I say behold my enlightenment
And I say behold a new society
And I say behold the greatest lie of man

And all that "god" has done
Is what you've done for you
And god will forever be
The chosen image.

And I say behold my enlightenment
And I say behold a new society
And I say behold the greatest lie of man
And I say behold its end in me
Behold our Grand Mistake!
