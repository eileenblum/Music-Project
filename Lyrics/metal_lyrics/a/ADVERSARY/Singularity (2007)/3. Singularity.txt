Everything that came before
Is irrelevant to now
To the choice at hand

Half measures will no longer avail
This is where my dreams meet resolve

May I sway the cold ear of fate
And bring about a day 
When forever knows my name

So seize the day

May I sway the cold ear of fate
And bring about a day when forever knows my name

Or will I take my name down into my grave
Or will I be a singularity?

This is improbability vs. will

And as this ontological renaissance does become me
May the sands of time engrain in a man
That understood that existance 
Means more than just existing

So seize the day

May I sway the cold ear of fate
And bring about a day when forever knows my name
Or will I take my name down into my grave
Or will I be a singularity?
