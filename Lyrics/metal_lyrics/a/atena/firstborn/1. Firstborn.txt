Take control of your life
One is born to evolve, and not just to die

I SEE YOUR PROBLEMS, BUT I DON'T SEE YOUR REASON
I TRY TO EMPATHIZE BUT DON'T REALLY MEAN IT

OH FUCK

MOMMY DOESN'T LOVE ME AND DADDY DOESN'T CARE
I'M A BITCHY LITTLE ADDICT WHO ALWAYS LIVED IN FEAR

NOBODY BELIEVED IN ME, I NEVER HAD A CHANCE
I AM WAITING FOR A MIRACLE TO COME AND SAVE MY ASS

NO DEMONS TO BLAME, NO ANGELS TO THANK
NO DEMONS TO FIGHT

CAUSE THEY'RE NOT FUCKING REAL

WE ARE ROTTING

WE ANNIHILATE OURSELVES

(I make the boys hard, I make the men sin, I make them crawl just to get what I want)
(I am the voice in your head that makes you steal, hate, ruin, kill, do what god says)

WE ARE SUFFERING
BUT YOU WON'T SEE THROUGH THE LIES

YOU COULD CHANGE THIS WITH A DIFFERENT SET OF EYES

WHAT YOU SEE MIGHT NOT BE THE RIGHT
SOLUTION OF A RESCUE FOR YOUR HOPELESSNESS

SALVATION WON'T HELP US, THE SILENCE IS CALLING

THERE'S NO TIME TO TURN
THE ILLUSION UPON YOU NEEDS TO BE SHATTERED

YOUR WEAKNESS WILL BE YOUR STRENGTH
BUT YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP
