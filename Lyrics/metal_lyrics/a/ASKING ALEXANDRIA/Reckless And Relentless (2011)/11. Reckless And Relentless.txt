They said that self destruction I stopped below and for along, 
My only home is the bottom of the bottle and a rolled up bill and I'm ready to go! 
I let the scent die in and out and I dont care how long I last, 
On the constant drink and drugs and dont get me wrong I'm having a fucking blast. 

I am rock and roll, living a life we can only dream of, 
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest 

Just like the cigarettes hurt, 
Just like the whiskey burns, whoa wohoa 
I guess I'm never gonna learn 

Just like the cigarettes hurt, 
Just like the whiskey burns, whoa wohoa 
I guess I'm never gonna learn 

You cannot stop me till my insides bleeding, 
You cannot stop me till my last breathe comes, 
I'm gonna go until I hit the floor 
Cant find a way back to my feet 
Anymore

Pass me a glass and lets destroy everything in this fucking place 
Like a billion miles an hour you pussys cant keep up with this fucking pace 

I am rock and roll, living a life we can only dream of, 
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest 

Just like the cigarettes hurt, 
Just like the whiskey burns, wohoa wohoa 
I guess I'm never gonna learn 

Just like the cigarettes hurt, 
Just like the whiskey burns, whoa wohoa 
I guess I'm never gonna learn  

Ive drunk the last time you stood here, your by my side, 
You thought that it should be just like the good old days of rock and roll 
Without a drink, without regret without a second thought 
You look below on the end of the back of your fucking throat 

I am rock and roll living a life we can only dream of 
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest
