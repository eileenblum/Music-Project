Get the fuck away from me

I know that I have done wrong and continue to do so but without remorse
I know that I am on a fast track to the grave and I'm headed there alone
I struggle to find myself this time
Save yourself for a man with a conscience
I fight to find myself this time
Save yourself for a man that isn't me

I spend my days looking through pages
Trying to find a way to get away from me
With love to give that leaves you breathless
Now all I need to find a way back inside my mind

I don't want to leave you breathless
When will you realize
I don't want to leave you breathless
When will you realize
I don't want to leave you breathless
When will you save yourself

Yeah!

I spend my days looking through pages
Trying to find a way to get away from me
With love to give that leaves you breathless
Now all I need to find... a way back inside my mind

I need to find
A way back inside my mind [x2]

This is not the end
This is the end of [x3]
This is not the end

Every mistake I've made leaves a scar that burns every day
Yet still I carry on
Without regret
Without remorse
I'm gone
You're better off to walk away
I am corruption, I am sin

Forget my name
Forget my face
Forget my name
Forget my face
