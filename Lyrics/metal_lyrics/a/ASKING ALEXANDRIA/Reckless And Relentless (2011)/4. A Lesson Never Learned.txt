Please, you have to help me
This is not my true face
If you could see my soul
As I have seen my soul
I could show it to you
It's rotten
It's poison
Help me please 

Please give me a fucking excuse
I beg for just one reason to give you regret

Are you with me or are you on your own?
Itâs time to choose your side, so choose your side 
Are you with me or are you on your own?
Itâs time to choose your side, so choose your fucking side

Could be the end of the world 
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away 
Could be the end of the world 
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away 

Hear me now 
Get off your knees 
Nothing changes when you pray
I'm the closest thing to a god you'll ever know
Get off your knees

Open your eyes 
I'll regret never again 
And I stand above you

And I canât feel this pain anymore
And I canât carry on this way
Iâm hiding behind false eyes

Could be the end of the world 
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away 
Could be the end of the world 
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away 

Over and over 
Over and over
