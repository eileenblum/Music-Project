[Bonus Track]This is hell for me to say
But I think itâs time we said
âEnoughâs, enoughâ
Turn around and waltz away

You became my friend
Theyâll never cause you pain again

We canât surrender
We wonât surrender
Though weâd hate to run away
We canât run away from them all
We canât surrender
We wonât surrender
Theyâll bleed for what theyâve

Done to us
They shut us out for long enough
In the dark
I want to watch this

Listen, canât you hear them screaming?
Theyâre buried in the walls
Now theyâre never leaving
They can never hurt us again

Peeling the scab
From each and every
Last one of them
Screeching
A moment around
[?]

Blood
Blood
Blood
Blood

Blood is seeping
From the fingers
That are wrapped
around my arm
Silent
Braced myself a lifetime
This is what Iâve
Been waiting for

Listen, canât you hear them screaming?
Theyâre buried in the walls
Now theyâre never leaving
They can never hurt us again

Theyâre dead, theyâre dead
Theyâre dead just like I dreamed of
Sleeping softlyânever to awaken
Dead, theyâre dead
Theyâre gone into the shadows
Never to be seen again
