As I breathe, my disease brings me to my knees
All you need is a taste itâll set you free
Youâre infections my discretion honey one in the same
Cause I get so medicated it fucks with my brain

I donât want this baby
I just need it

Cause I have a white line fever
and I never toured for sin,
If there's a black hole heading for hell
then maybe count me in?
I sold my soul so long ago
the bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go,
If there's a black hole heading for hell
then maybe count me in?
I sold my soul

Licking every drop of poison
off the back of your keys
While some daddy's little angels
getting down on her knees
When the sun comes down
the filth runs free
Youâll never find a brighter specimen
than filth in me

I donât want this
I Just Need This
To Carry On

I've got the white line fever
and I never toured for sin
If there's a black hole heading for hell
then maybe count me in?
I sold my soul so long ago
the bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole heading for hell
then maybe count me in?

So theyâll send down the devil
and he stressed his wealth
Cause I've been through a burned town
and rebuilt hell
with a heart of ice
he did not give a fuck
Iâm a noose to the world
and Iâm painting it black

I've got the white line fever
and I never toured for sin
If there's a black hole heading for hell
then maybe count me in?
I sold my soul so long ago
the bullet in the chamber with nowhere to go
If there's a black hole heading for hell
then maybe count me in?

I sold my soul
