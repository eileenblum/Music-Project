Am I insane?
I ask myself over and over and over again
Trapped in my brain
Pull it out from the cracks in my skull
Am I alone?
Surrounded by shadows
I think I might just be suffocating

The devil came to take me to hell
But I'm already there.

Am I insane?
Am I insane?
Am I insane?

The devil came to take me to hell
But I'm already there.

[Chorus]
I won't let you be the death of me
No I refuse to let you bring me down
Bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong
And I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back
And I'm better than ever.

Am I insane?
I've rolled myself over
And screamed till I spit up blood
Trapped in my brain
The answer has taken my hands to pull my eyeballs out

Am I alone?
The voices who fight in my brain just won't fucking go away

The devil came to take me to hell
But I'm already there.

Am I insane?
Am I insane?
Am I insane?

Am I alone surrounded by death?
I think this might just be the end

Am I insane?
Am I insane?
Am I insane?

The devil came to take me to hell
But I'm already there.

You can't take this away from me
You can't release these demons
You can't make this OK for me
You're the one who caused these feelings

I apologize for what I'm about to do
I try to sympathize
But at the end of the day
You brought this on yourself

[Chorus]
I won't let you be the death of me
No I refuse to let you bring me down
Bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong
And I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back
And I'm better than ever
Now I'm back
And I'm better than ever

The tears
Have left a blur
That I can't explain
The pain
Has left a hole
In which my heart should've been

I'm blind with rage
And I can't shake this feeling
Irrational
Impetuous
And intemperate

I'm blind with rage
And I can't shake this feeling
Irrational
Impetuous
And temperate

I won't let you be the death of me
I refuse to let you bring me down
Bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong
And I lost my mind before
But I'm back and I'm better than ever
