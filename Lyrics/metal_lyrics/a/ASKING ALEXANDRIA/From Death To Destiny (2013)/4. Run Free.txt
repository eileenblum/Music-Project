This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
Run free!

Run free and wild lose your mind,
Escape your inhibitions,
Taste the wind,
Let your hair down,
Throw your hands up

Go, go, go,
But don't forget the consequences
Go, go, go,
Let go, running free

Open your heart, open your mind
To a new world, to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly
To a new world, to a new world

This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
Run free-ee-e-e-e!

Run free and wild, lose your mind
This world's yours for the taking
Open wide, scream it loud
"This is my life!"

Go, go, go,
But don't forget what came before
Go, go, go,
Let go, running free

Open your heart, open your mind
To a new world, to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly
To a new world, to a new world

Close your eyes and pray for something better than
This world has to give!
Make it worth your time when you move on to
Whatever the hell is next!
Know that you went in the end without a single
Regret!
That you lived and loved and laughed and cried and
Followed your dreams!

You won't be alone in the end
You don't have to be afraid
Run free and wild, let your heart soar with the eagles
Run free and wild, let your love take over
You won't be alone in the end
You don't have to be afraid
