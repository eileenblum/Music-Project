Am I insane?
I ask myself over and over and over again
Am I alone?
Surrounded by shadows I think
I might just be end
Am I insane?
Am I insane?
Am I insane?
Am I alone?
Surrounded by shadows I think
I might just be end

I won't let you be the death of me
I refuse to let you bring me down
Bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong
And I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back
And I'm better than ever

The devil came to take me to hell
But I'm already there
The voices grow fainter but they won't go away
Am I insane?
Am I insane?
Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell
Over and over again
But I'm already there

I won't let you be the death of me
I refuse to let you bring me down
Bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong
And I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back
And I'm better than ever
Now I'm back
And I'm better than ever

The tears have left a blur
That I can't explain
The pain has left a hole
In which my heart should be
I'm blind with rage
And I can't shake this feeling
Irrational
Infectious
Intemperate
I'm blind with rage
And I can't shake this feeling
Irrational
Infectious
Intemperate

I won't let you be the death of me
I refuse to let you bring me down
Bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be
The one who's in the wrong
And I've lost my mind before
But now I'm back
And I'm better than ever
