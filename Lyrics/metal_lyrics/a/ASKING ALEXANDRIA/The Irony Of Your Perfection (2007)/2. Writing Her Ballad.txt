Let's get away cure your fast pain.
What a perfect way to ruin this day.
What a killing, with a lot of blood put away.
Without back in my bone.
The sarcastic, self will save it
Where'd it go, where'd it to go, where'd it go, where'd it go!? Okay!
The voice we need to talk, to talk, where'd it go, where'd it go!
Let the break house of us burn.
Let me take a cam and fly...
Let it carry us from the worst! To say goodbye...

Writing hurts, the writing hurts as she kills herself,
Conscience stained with the blood of me.
Your voice finally begins to mourn because we're breaking,
With a fracture I'll sit and wait.
Your lips, we kiss, to be part of something.
You mad? It's okay, it's well known heart break.
This voice, better tell you you're dreaming!

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!
Okay! The voice we need to talk, to talk, wake up, wake up!
Let the break house of us burn!,
Let make this cam and always try, and I cannot find the words...
To say... Goodbye!

OKAY!

Fight, fight, fight!
Fight, fight, fight!
Fight, fight, fight!
Fight, fight, fight!

Rah!

It's all this complication, okay you're screaming uh-uh-uh okay!
And all this complication, okay you're bleeding uh uh uh uh uh
The only complication, okay you're screaming uh uh uh uh uh
And all this complication, okay you're bleeding uh uh uh... uh...

It's 2 am...
You're fast asleep... (NOOOO!)
I'm watching you weep, and dream away your inspiration...
Oh no... you're drifting away...
I'm all alone, but I'm still writing... (WRITING TO YOU!) to you...
And I will travel from all the way from hell
Cause' I love you...
