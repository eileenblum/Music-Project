Kiss goodbye, to the poetic letters, the symptoms
Of being able to breathe without a care
Cushion the screaming, it's merely conversation in regards to
Speaking for the sake of concern 

Take the flight of a butterfly, drop dead
Hear the whisper of the bullet's pace
Have you ever felt; heartbreak, bullet, kiss your heart?
Scream goodbye
You're dropping dead 
And it's all over

Say hello, to the clock counting down the seconds
The bullets pace, your beating heart point A, point B!
Let's see how quick you are, 
Whether you'll risk it all on the line just to gain some ground
To show you can soak up the shots fired

Take the flight of a butterfly, drop dead
Hear the whisper of the bullet's pace
Have you ever felt; heartbreak, bullet, kiss your heart?

Butterfly, you gotta race the bullet's pace
Butterfly, you gotta race the bullet's whisper
Butterfly, don't fall, gotta keep up the chase
Just scream goodbye
Bleed, butterfly whisper gotta crack break drop dead
Bleed, butterfly whisper gotta fracture
Bleed, butterfly whisper gotta crack break drop dead
