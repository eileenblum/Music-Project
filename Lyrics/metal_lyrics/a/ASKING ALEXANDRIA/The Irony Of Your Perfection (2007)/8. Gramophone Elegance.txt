Paint your lips blue
Murder artistry
Heartbreak and romance
The cold is what you need for events such as this
It's better being numb if you're cracking at the heart
Pick up the rhythm, the timing that you'll need
Tonight's final serenade, it's time to take your leave

Dance the routine
And your romance is warm inside
Your heartbeat's racing
Heartbreak is cold when you
Don't dance, dream, sing our song

Come get some
Everything stops
Everything starts
Give me your hand
One on one
Two on two
Three on three
Dance step four
The cold is what you need for events such as this
It's better being numb if you're breaking at the heart
Pick up the rhythm, the timing that you'll need
Tonight's final serenade, it's time to take your leave

Dance the routine
And your romance is warm inside
Your heartbeat's racing
Heartbreak is cold when you
Don't dance dream sing our song

Poetic whispers of romance
Fill the dancing midnight air
Dance
Dance
Blood stained glass, shattered hopes
And dancing dreams in your head
I can't seem to find my steps 
In this murder
