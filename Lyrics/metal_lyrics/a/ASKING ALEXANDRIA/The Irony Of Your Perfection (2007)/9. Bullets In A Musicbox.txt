Aaaahhhhh
Take a deep breathe in front of the mirror,
His concious stares,
They place a curse on you.
Should I smash your face into the glass?
Well then pick up the pieces.
Oh keep it short,
You're what you love the most.

Do you consider to keep turning
(round and around and around and around)
The worlds watching so keep turning
(round and around and around and around)
You need to keep it down!
(round and around and around and around)
The people you keep bringing in your life.

No place to go,
But such a perfect image.
It's not enough,
And it's what you want
Its not what you need.

Fuck the pretty girl.
She ain't as bad as you
Glitter your eyes to prove her wrong

Do you consider to keep turning
(round and around and around and around)
The worlds watching
And they're listening.
(round and around and around and around)
You need to keep it down!
(round and around and around and around)
The people you bring in your life

The worlds turning
Everybodys watching
(round and around and around and around)
Do you consider to keep turning

You can't recount
What time (Your lipstick expires[?])
Your fake on the outside;
I think its oh to easy
To see straight through you
With your melted face
First time that you're [?]
ROUND

OH GOD
Round and around
Oh God
Round and around, round and around
Oh god (you keep turning)
Round and around
Oh god
Round and around (ahaha) round and around.

Round and around
The worlds watching
So keep turning
Round and around
You consider to keep turning
Round and around
The world's judging
So keep turning.

OH
