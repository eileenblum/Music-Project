How stubborn are the scars when they won't fade away?
Or just a gentle reminder that now are better days?

We'll be home soon, so dry your eyes,
You'll be okay (you'll be okay!)

Oh my God!
The water is rising!
It's rising!
You just have to believe in me!
Failing that I'll ride this storm alone!

We can still make it out,
'Fuck'

I can help you through this,
But you have to take my hand!
I can take you home,
Take my hand,
Take my hand!

I should've known the tides were getting higher.
We can still survive.
They think we're drowning but our heads are still above the waves,
Above the waves.

(I should've known the tides were getting higher)
(We can still survive)
(Above the waves)
(I should've known the tides were getting higher)
(I should've known the tides were getting higher)

We can still survive!

You never said goodbye, goodbye!
[x4]

And now you're on your own!

You never said goodbye!
You never said goodbye, goodbye!
