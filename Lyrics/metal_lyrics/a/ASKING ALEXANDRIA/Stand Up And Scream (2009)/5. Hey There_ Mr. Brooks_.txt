[feat. Shawn Milke of Alesana]Oh, you're back to me
And the hunger returns!
I told myself
I was done for good!
All the memories
Of all the pictures burned!
I see them dancing!
My heart begins to pound!

I didn't make a sound!
They didn't see me coming!
The lights are left on,
The curtains left wide!
One scream, it's over.
I lay them side by side,
side by side!
Holding each other.

I'll be there in the morning 
With a smile on my face.
I'll be there in the morning 
To start it all again.

Boy, you caught me red handed!
You've got no fucking clue what
You just got yourself into!
Panic runs down your leg,
seeing me kill again!
You just got yourself caught 
And you don't even know it!
On the drive you get the rush 
And pull the gun on me!
We make the stop,
It's time to be set free!

Oh, the bullet's gone!
I take the spade, I slit your throat!
You fall into your grave!
I cover up my tracks, I'm done!
I won't kill again!
I said that's it, I'm done!

I'll be there in the morning 
With a smile on my face.
I'll be there in the morning 
To start it all again.

No, she's daddy's little girl!
She wasn't meant to be another me!
But it's the scissors to my throat!
To my fucking throat!
