I'm alive!
I'm alive!

Watch yourself,
I'm taking over.
The cracks in the pavement won't break my stride.
I tread lightly,
I tread light!
I'm alive!

I can't believe what I've become,
I won't stop breathing.
Your world is falling at your feet,
I won't stop breathing.

Oh my God!
Yeah!

I can't believe what I've become,
I won't stop breathing.
Your world is falling at your feet,
I won't stop breathing.

Just 'cause you're breathing
Don't mean you're alive.
Excuses are useless
When your mouth's stapled shut.

I can't believe
What you've become,
I can't believe.
[x2]

Oh!

You're drowning in the back room!
so this is what it feels to waltz?
[x4]

What it feels to waltz!

I must be dreaming!
Demise is so surreal!

I must be dreaming!
I must be dreaming!
I must be dreaming!
