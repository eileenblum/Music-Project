This isn't over, baby, don't believe a word they said!
But then,
She takes a moment to ponder,
To wonder what could've been given another chance!
To find a light in the darkness and a way out of this!
If only she could see what I could see!

She takes a moment to stumble to her feet.
If only I was there to hold her hand.
If only she saw what I saw,
She'd get out of this one!
She'd get out of here!

What burns the most is that you lied right to my face!
And, still, I hold your hand to set you free!
What burns the most is that you lied right to my face!
And, still, I hold your hand to set you free!
(To set you)

(Free!) With eyes closed,
Her heart breaks
And through it all,
She brought this on herself,
On herself.
With eyes closed,
Her heart breaks
And through it all,
She brought this on herself,
On herself.

For me,
For you,
The fallen.
Save her!
For us, 
For me,
For good,
Save her!
[x2]

Save her!
She falls beside me!
She brought this on herself!
(This song's for)

(You!) With eyes closed,
Her heart breaks
And through it all,
She brought this on herself,
On herself.
With eyes closed,
Her heart breaks
And through it all,
She brought this on herself,
On herself.
