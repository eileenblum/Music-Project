So you're all stars now
So you're what's in now
Top of the world now
So you're the kings now
There's only one throne and I'm not done with it
Still shitting sleeping eating breathing it
Ten years and you're still hanging onto my every word with baited breath
After a decade pushing boundaries proving impossible possible making something from nothing creating larger than life
Always rejecting the herd
Always ahead of the curve
Writing the records your favorite band rip off in their records

You're all so fucking outrageous I can't take it
Motherfuckers more than a little complacent
Where did it go
Where did it go so wrong
Just sit the fuck down pay attention
There's too much noise for a second listen
Where did it go
Where did it go so wrong

There was the first one
The "triple gold" one
The "stole by every fucking band on summer tours" one
Then the second one
The "living reckless" one
The "knock the pop stars off the charts" one
Then the third one
The "fuck the world" one
The "arenas singing every fucking word" one
Then was a fourth one
The "wasn't me" one
The "we needed just a little space to breathe" one
But now there's this one
The "I am the king" one
The "I don't care I'm gonna do my thing" one
"Breaking every fucking rule in the book" one
The "fuck you all"

This shit is fucking outrageous I can't take it
Motherfuckers more than a little complacent
Where did it go
Where did it go so wrong
Just sit the fuck down pay attention
There's too much noise for a second listen
Where did it go
Where did it go so wrong

Don't have to like it but you can't deny you needed me
To show you what comes next what comes next
I set the standard far too high for you to follow me
Feel free to try your best try your best

You're all so fucking outrageous I can't take it
Motherfuckers more than a little complacent
Where did it go
Where did it go so wrong
Just sit the fuck down pay attention
There's too much noise for a second listen
Where did it go
Where did it go so wrong
