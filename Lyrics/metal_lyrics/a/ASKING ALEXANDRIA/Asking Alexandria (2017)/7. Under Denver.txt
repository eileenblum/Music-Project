Just wait and see
Just sit and breathe
Your life's unimportant
Your ego's distorted
Just let what is be
Delusions of control how's the wool feel
Pre-decision doesn't mean that this is not real
Why throw away what you've been given just to spite it
What will be will be

Children of the world dream in peace
The fourth will watch over you
Sleep and you will know the truth
Children of the world dream in peace
Here rebuild in solitude
Under Denver calling you

You're not alone
Your truth is wrong
It's best to accept it
No sense in resisting
Just let what is be
Listen follow orders buy consume sell
Stay on the surface it's OK to trust the system
Tried and tested they know best they know the outcome
What will be will be

Children of the world dream in peace
The fourth will watch over you
Sleep and you will know the truth
Children of the world dream in peace
Here rebuild in solitude
Under Denver calling you

They're more than we
They hold the keys
They live in the silence
Just offer compliance
And what will be will be

Children of the world dream in peace
The fourth will watch over you
Sleep and you will know the truth
Children of the world dream in peace
Here rebuild in solitude
Under Denver calling you
