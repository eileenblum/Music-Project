Take it all back
Take it all back
Take it all back

I'm not too sure what I'm supposed to do with this
These hands, this mind, this instability

From a cage I created to a hell that heaven made
Can't let go of the hatred 'cause I love the way it tastes

Take it all back

I wouldn't take back a moment, not one miserable moment

I give it all 'til there's nothing
I walk into the fire
Into the fire
I walk into the fire
Into the fire

Into the fire

I've come to terms with the fact I'll never change
And that's just fine, I find solace in the pain

I don't mind the darkness, it's easy on the eyes
I'm praying for something to make me feel alive

I wouldn't take back a moment, not one miserable moment
I give it all, 'til there nothing
I walk into the fire
Into the fire
I walk into the fire
Into the fire

Into the fire
The fire
No

I'm paranoid, sycophant, masochistic dilettante.
Narcissistic elephant in the room
I'm the end of the world, thinning the herd,
The all around outta my my mind, fucking absurd
I am gone, I am gone

I wouldn't take back a moment
I walk into the fire
Into the fire
I walk into the fire
Into the fire

Into the fire
Fire

Take it all back
