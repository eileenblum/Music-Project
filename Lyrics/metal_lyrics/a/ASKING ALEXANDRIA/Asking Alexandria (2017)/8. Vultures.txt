Close the curtains cash me in
Gather photographs of the devil you let in
Digging deep inside my soul I don't know
I don't know

Where to turn
Everywhere I look these vultures burn
The life right outta me, do I run
Or lay down and die
Is it time to close my eyes

Keep me numb I'll follow direction
A pawn to pass around and be bled until I'm dry
It's hard to see what's underneath is it me
Is it me

Where do I turn
Everywhere I look these vultures burn
The life right outta me, do I run
Or lay down and die
Is it time to close my eyes

For so long all I've known all I've seen's green lights
Fuck your greed all I need's somewhere to catch my breath, rest my head and ease my mind
I've been holding on but grip ain't what it used to be
I'm much older I'm bitter I'm jaded I'm lost can somebody give me a sign

Where do I turn
Everywhere I look these vultures burn
The life right outta me, do I run
Or lay down and die
Is it time to close my eyes

Where do I turn
Everywhere I look these vultures burn
The life right outta me, do I run
Or lay down and die
Is it time to close my eyes
