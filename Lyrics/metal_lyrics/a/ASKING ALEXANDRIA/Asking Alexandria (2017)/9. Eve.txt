I am iniquity

You think everything's perfect silly girl
There's so much wonder here right in front of your eyes
What could it hurt what is wrong with you
Who the fuck is he why can't you know why can't you know

And the walls came down and the heavens opened
It's too late to claim your innocence once the trust is broken
It was just a little taste it was so sweet
You couldn't imagine in your wildest dreams
You had to taste it
Reach out and take it

For just a second consider why a man who cares so much would keep something so simple from someone so innocent
Maybe he wants it all for himself 'cause he thinks you don't deserve to feel all the joys that he feels that you'll never feel

Ask yourself why does he give you less when he takes more
Ask yourself how being free is being locked inside these walls
Maybe you're weak or a mistake or too emotional
Maybe you're not good enough for his world maybe you never were

And the walls came down and the heavens opened
It's too late to claim your innocence once the trust is broken
It was just a little taste it was so sweet
You couldn't imagine in your wildest dreams
You had to taste it
Reach out and take it

He'll never know I'll never tell
You deserve
You deserve to be free
You have my word damn me to hell
You deserve to know
You deserve to be free

And the walls came down and the heavens opened
It's too late to claim your innocence once the trust is broken
It was just a little taste it was so sweet
You couldn't imagine in your wildest dreams
You had to taste it
Reach out and take it
You had to taste it
Reach out and take it

Reach out and take it
