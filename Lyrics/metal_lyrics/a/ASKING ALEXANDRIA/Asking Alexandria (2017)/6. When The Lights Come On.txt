There's a world passed the curtains of eager excitement
A sea of impatience awaiting incitement
It's all so enticing it's so mesmerizing
It's so hypnotizing the rhythmic beguiling

Bring the house down
Breathe in, out
In, out
In, out

When the lights come on
When the crowd goes wild
Rip the roof up off of here
Take it to the stratosphere
To the stratosphere
Stand up and scream it loud
When the fire flies
Rip the roof up off of here
Take it to the stratosphere
To the stratosphere

After sitting and waiting and anticipating
The energy through the walls reverberating
It's so captivating the buzz generated
It's invigorating I feel elevated

Bring the house down
Breathe in, out
In, out
In, out

When the lights come on
When the crowd goes wild
Rip the roof up off of here
Take it to the stratosphere
To the stratosphere
Stand up and scream it loud
When the fire flies
Rip the roof up off of here
Take it to the stratosphere
To the stratosphere

When the lights come on
When the crowd goes wild
Rip the roof up off of here
Take it to the stratosphere
To the stratosphere
Stand up and scream it loud
When the fire flies
Rip the roof up off of here
Take it to the stratosphere
To the stratosphere

To the stratosphere
