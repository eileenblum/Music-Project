Staring eyes wide open
Gazing into nothing
Running in place again
Going through the motions
In and out as the oceans
Repeating
Numb to the silence to the absence of emotion
The sum of the script nothing but a click in the rotation
Sick of the peace of mind that goes along with keeping on
And I can't keep on keeping on

Inside it feels like I'm stuck here suspended at best underwhelming what's wrong with me
My conscience is calling but the world isn't all it's cracked-up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful (hopeful) that I'm not stuck here suspended in a world pretended was right for me for me

Strung out on the same old
Got an itch for something painful
To feel something real once to remind myself it's not in my head
Sick of the calm coinciding with stick in and with the line
Can't keep on keeping on

It all just feels like I'm stuck here suspended at best underwhelming what's wrong with me
My conscience is calling but the world isn't all it's cracked-up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful that I'm not stuck here suspended in a world pretended was right for me for me

(What's right for me)
When I close my eyes
When I leave the light

Inside it feels like I'm stuck here suspended at best underwhelming what's wrong with me
My conscience is calling but the world isn't all it's cracked-up to be
I'm hopelessly hopeful that I'm not stuck here suspended in a world pretended was right for me for me
