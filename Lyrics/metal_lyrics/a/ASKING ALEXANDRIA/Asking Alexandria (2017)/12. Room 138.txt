On my back breathing heavy staring at the light
Praying this isn't the end but it might be
On my back got my heart beating out of my chest
I never thought I can't believe that I'd go out like this

So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
I never expected to be here again
My vision is burning as the light starts to fade
Please pull me out of this

My ribs are breaking I swear I'm only twenty three
Crawling searching for a lifeline I just can't reach
Somebody hear me someone open up the door
Get me up off the floor and stop the shaking the shaking
This blood is boiling in my veins oh god the pain it's unrelenting
I'm ready for the end if it means that all of this will end

So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
I never expected to be here again
My vision is burning as the light starts to fade
Please pull me out from this

Through the haze I saw a face a second chance another life to live
How did you forgive me
Held my head against your chest told me everything's alright
Don't be afraid
Close your eyes and rest

Through the haze I saw a face a second chance another life to live
How did you forgive me
Held my head against your chest told me everything's alright
Don't be afraid
Close your eyes and rest

So these are the walls that have to hold this moment
I never expected to be here again
My vision is burning as the light starts to fade
Please pull me out from this

Please pull me out from this
Please pull me out from this
