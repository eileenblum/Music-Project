[feat. Bingx]Yeah and they tell me that life is short
In the blink of an eye we come and die kept in mind that life is war
Stay grounded fly and soar always know what you're fighting for
Aging fast gotta pave a path and go figure out what my life is for
Quick witted and everyday I gotta switch lanes
Fuck race no pigment I got thick skin making big waves
Positive being positive is my legacy
Pray for me or make way for me because I'm setting out to go change the earth and I just may
My life is what I call it and I call it successful
Now everybody wanna eyeball it like how the fuck he do that though
Take pride in your every action everyday of my life is work
They say time is money and I know what that time is worth

Even if the sky was falling down
Down down down
Even if the sky was falling I'm not falling down
I stand tall through it all
I've risked too much to just give up now
I'm pushing on through

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Sure as the tide rolls in at night
I'll still be here at the end of days screaming at the sky
Let the fire consume and cleanse what's before me
Behold I'll build my empire before the ashes hit the ground

Life inside a piece of paper live it through my pen and pad
Lead inside my pencil like the hammer on my pistol back
There ain't no hitting back life ain't no tennis match
All over the net but that ain't where I do my business at
Face to face with adversity and intimidation
This is real this is raw ain't no imitation
No limitations ain't a ceiling in sight
There ain't no rules or regulations either yield or you fight
Just take a look at where I been that's some appealing advice
'Cause you can build until it falls or keep it real and you rise

Even if the sky was falling down
Down down down
Even if the sky was falling I'm not falling down
I stand tall through it all
I've risked too much to just give up now
I'm pushing on through

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Sure as the tide rolls in at night
I'll still be here at the end of days screaming at the sky
Let the fire consume and cleanse what's before me
Behold I'll build my empire before the ashes hit the ground

Sure as the tide rolls in at night
I'll still be here at the end of days screaming at the sky
Let the fire consume and cleanse what's before me
Behold I'll build my empire before the ashes hit the ground
Ashes hit the ground
Ashes hit the ground
Ashes hit the ground
Ashes hit the ground

Ashes hit the ground
Ashes hit the ground

Sure as the tide rolls in at night
I'll still be here at the end of days screaming at the sky
Let the fire consume and cleanse what's before me
Behold I'll build my empire before the ashes hit the ground
I'll build my empire before the ashes hit the ground

Ashes hit the ground
Even if the sky was falling down
Ashes hit the ground
Ashes hit the ground
Even if the sky was falling down
