So here we fucking go
You're going down
You're on your own
This hate is endless
Tonight I think I'll cross the line
I'll cross the fucking line
This hate is relentless

Oh here we go down this hole
I've lost control
Save me
Oh here we go down this hole
I've lost control
Save me

Picking up, picking up another life
Waking up, waking up from all the lies
I feel so alone

Sometimes it ends
Sometimes you fall
Crossing out the man that I've become
I'm standing tall
Stronger than I ever did before
Against them all

I know that you have locked me in your eyes
And I can't resist it
The target on your chest is all that I can see
Fight me now
It's not over
No, no, no, it's not over
Pick me up off the ground just once more
So on I go, on I go
But never alone

Sometimes it ends
Sometimes you fall
Crossing out the man that I've become
I'm standing tall
Stronger than I ever did before
Against them all

Now it's my turn to drag you through this hell
Through this hell
I won't forgive
I won't let go of what you've done
Woke up alone
So sick of this game
I've spent too many years in this house of pain
If you can't find the words, read between the lines
So take it or leave it to me
So take it or leave it to me from here this time
