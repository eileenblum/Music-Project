A bottle of whiskey in my hand is like a fucking gun against my head
Just waiting to go off
So let's go
Come on
It's our curse on this road
This is what we all live for
A new will to begin
Armed with a license to sin
We're back at it again
Stay out of my fucking way

Did I take the right path?
I don't know, but I'm lovin' everything
All the hearts that I have broken
All the lies I've left unspoken
It's time to move on and just walk away
But in the end we'll be okay
And I'll be the one to blame
It's time to move on and just walk away

Fuck yeah
You might be the first for the evening
But you sure ain't the last
Another temporary lover whose lovin' never lasts
It's rock and roll and we love it that way

Did I take the right path?
I don't know, but I'm lovin' everything
All the hearts that I have broken
All the lies I've left unspoken
It's time to move on and just walk away
But in the end we'll be okay
And I'll be the one to blame
It's time to move on and just walk away

I'm out of my fucking mind
I don't care cause I'm lovin' everything
Fuck
I'm telling you I'm crazy
Baby this is how I play
And you can't fucking stop me
I'm in it all the way
