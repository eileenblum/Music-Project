No, I never said it was easy
We're starting over again
Oh, you fucking gotta believe me
We nearly fell off the edge

Circled by the wolves, they want me dead
Look me in the eye, I'm no longer afraid

I've come so far, I won't turn away
Let go of the past and live for today

I don't run fucker, I kill motherfucker
And I'm here motherfucker
You can try to beat me
Step inside fucker
You're next motherfucker
And you'll see motherfucker
You can't fuck with me
You're long dead to me

Fuck yeah!
Our fingers raised in the air
So can you hear me now?
Say my name
No longer wasting my time
Your words don't bother me
I don't care

I've come so far, I won't turn away
Let go of the past and live for today

Cheers!
Oh God..
I can't believe you thought we couldn't see
You wanted closure - now it's here for you
F U C K Y O U

We're all just running in circles
Forever chasing a dream
As if everything that we long for
Is not as far as it seems
Who the hell are you any way?
Who the fuck are you to say we're done for?
