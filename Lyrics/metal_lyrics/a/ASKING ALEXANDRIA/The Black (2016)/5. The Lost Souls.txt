We are the ones that no one gave a chance
We are the ones that almost lost it all
Ghost in the hallway who never catch a glance
We are the lost
We are the lost souls
Our hearts, our souls are shallow empty holes
We sing this anthem for us all
We're so fucked up
Oh God we're so alone
Just close your eyes and sing along
If my heart stops beating, will you still remember?
Will you still remember my name?
Did I get what I deserved?
We're trapped in doubt
In our own minds
Ignoring all we feel inside
Forsaken, gone, forgotten
Everything has come apart
Lead us back from out the dark
Our hearts, our souls, are shallow empty holes
We sing this anthem for us all
We're so fucked up
Oh God we're so alone
Just close your eyes and sing along
Let's go
We sing this anthem for us all
Let's go
We sing this anthem for us all
We are the lost souls
