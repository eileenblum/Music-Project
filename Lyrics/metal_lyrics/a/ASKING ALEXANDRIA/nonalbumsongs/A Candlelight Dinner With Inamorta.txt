This isn't over baby don't believe a word they said
But then
She takes a moment to ponder
To wonder what could've been given another chance
To find the light in the darkness and way out of this
If only she saw what I could see
She takes a moment to stumble to her feet
If I was there to hold her hand
If only she saw what I saw she'd get out of this one
She'd get out of here
What burns the most is that you lied right to my face
And still I take your hand to set you free
With eyes closed
Her heart breaks
And after it all
She brought this on herself
For me, for you, the fallen, save her
For me, for us, for good, save her
She falls before me
With eyes closed
Her heart breaks
And after it all
She brought this on herself
