[performed by Danny Worsnop solo]I slipped up, I fell down.
I laid there with my back against the ground.
I've reached out, all I found,
My own reflection floating up into the clouds.

You helped me out of my madness.
You pulled me out of my grave.

I'm alive,
Breathing deeper than I've ever breathed before,
And I owe it all to you.
I'm coming home.

I found my heart,
I thought was dead and gone,
Safely in your hands, and it will stay there forever.
You keep me up, you keep me up. You keep me sane.
You taught me love. You saved me.

You helped me out of my madness.
You pulled me out of my grave.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

I'm alive,
Breathing deeper than I've ever breathed before,
And I owe it all to you.
I'm coming home.
The distance can't haunt us anymore.
I'm coming home!
[4x]

I'm alive,
Breathing deeper than I've ever breathed before,
And I owe it all to you.
I'm coming home.
