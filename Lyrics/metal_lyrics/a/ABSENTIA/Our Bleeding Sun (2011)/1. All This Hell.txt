As I lie in this frozen ground
My soul has no empathy
Tears of rage fill my eyes
Something within me dies
Tears I have never wept
Inflame the burning hate within me
I will spread my once broken wings
and fly beyond the skies
I wait for the moment to be set free
Far away from all this hell
