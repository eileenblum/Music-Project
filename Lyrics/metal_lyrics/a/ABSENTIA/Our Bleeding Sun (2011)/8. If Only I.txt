If only I could take back time
If only I had never opened my eyes
If only I can free the words from my mind
Words turn to screams
... Screams to break my old skies

Tonight I heard the wind whispering my name
The sound was so clear... it drew from my fears
The sky is stained with blood
Under the light of our bleeding sun
I crawled through the ashes with nowhere to run

Obsession, unable to materialize
Perpetuated self
Essence is fragile because it never takes shape
and in doing so his ideal vanishes

If only I would forget my mind when my eyes are closed
If only I could forget the caress of time
If only I learned to walk those paths unknown
Undoing those things from long ago
