Cleanse my sins with the falling rain
Running down my pale cheeks
No that my heart is frozen
Purify the lies within my destiny
Free my soul into the deepest abyss
Where I have so longed to fall
Where I have so longed to be
I still remember the way back but...
I choose eternity in darkness

Take my hand and lead me through the darkness
I've been so afraid of dying
But this world is do old
And my eyes are so tired

Take my hand and lead me through the darkness
Now that I have learned the meaning of fear
Is this just a dream? I'll bleed forever

Take my hand and lead me through the darkness
I've been so afraid of dying
But this world is do old
And my eyes are so tired
Inferno
Drag me through the dirt
Where no one misses the light of day

Is this heaven you were longing for
Or is it just a dream among your fears
You will never awake
Your dreams are a part of me now
Is this heaven where I'll roam alone
My rivers run red like the light of a fading day
I have no fear
Burning tears of a life once lived
