Shadows walking by your side
Remnants of never ending sorrow
But now... the dream you lived in your life dies every single day
Sad eyes looking for a new day that never comes
Remembrances are the only thing you have
Remains in a broken life
Silence whispers your name
Silence is the only thing you've got

Is heaven crying? For you... You're so alone
Is heaven dying? I wish heaven were lying
Is heaven crying? Thee shadows are crawling
Is heaven dying? I wish heaven were lying

Never look back... At your broken smile
Never look back... At your dreams never dreamt

When destiny called (it) filled your eyes with grey
Dreams are never dreamt
When destiny called
The path you walked altered its course
The end was unforeseen
Between two worlds, heaven and earth
My hell is your heaven
When the time came you forgot to say goodbye
Lost words to say goodbye

Eternal rest grant unto her O Lord
and let the perpetual light shine upon her
My she rest in peace
Amen
