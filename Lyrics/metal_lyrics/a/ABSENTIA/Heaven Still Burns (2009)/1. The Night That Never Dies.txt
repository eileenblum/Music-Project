At dawn Iâm the breeze upon your dead dry leaves
That hide memories deep beneathâ¦
In the evening light Iâm that raven in the skyâ¦
Darkâ¦ as the death I carry inside.

ââ¦ A snake in flowers by nightâ¦
â¦ a kiss in the lips of a thieveâ¦â

At dusk a shadow in the shadows
Awaiting for a new dawn to die
This night seems to never die.

ââ¦Naked and so fragile surrounded by your liesâ¦
â¦ one thousand timesâ¦ one thousand criesâ¦â

Leave me alone with my sinsâ¦
I know who I am and thatâs my will
Leave alone hating my dreamsâ¦ my lost dreamsâ¦
Since my star forgot to shine, this night seems to never die.

âIâve sailed through oceans of time, I walked paths
leading to nowhereâ¦ and all Iâve found was the
edge of a new day. Nakedâ¦ and alone, lost in this
nowhere land, where time stands still and all
promises fade awayâ¦ the wind kissed me deep and for a second time my heart forgot to beatâ¦
once againâ¦ and again my star forgot to shineâ¦
How I wish to be a dream burning is these cold flamesâ
