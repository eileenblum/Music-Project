Rain fallsâ¦ rain like tears falling down my cheeks
They drag me to an endless seaâ¦ staring through dusk I know so well

Under seven star weâll came together in deepest silence
Silence is more silent nowâ¦ when rain falls

Silver fills my eyes with eternity
I will suffer in your endless seas eternally
Slave of an angel in disguise
Damnation is a burning darkness in my heart.

ââ¦Heaven still burn under my skin as I kiss her lips
She dressed in silver surrounded by mistâ¦â

The last sun will die when Iâll taste her bloody kiss
Drops of silence fall in a crimpson poll so warm and so deep
The last sun will die.

ââ¦ Sheâs the wind that makes fly my wings
She is a spider weaving my once lost dreamsâ¦â

Dreams like rivers dragging me to your endless seas
Slave of days and nights in deepest silence
My last sun will die like that rose withered in your throne made os stone
My last sun will die.
