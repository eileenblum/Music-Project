Chemical kids lost in the street, looking for some kind of saviour
Perverted minds lead them like sheep into the slaughter they have to face

[Chorus]
Too young to die, too drunk to live
As they follow in the path of believers before them
Too young to die, but there won't be too long to live

Daddie's princess fixes her hair, powders her nose from the inside
Smokes in the car, drinks her last beer, soon she'll be ready for one more day

Head for the classroom and to hell but the clock up on the wall hold the blind face of freedom

[Chorus cont.]

There's time to die but she just needs more time to live

[Solo]

Years from now
Look how they change
They're so mature and respected
Makes them laugh
They were such fools
So unaware of the real live world
Honey I'm home, fix me a drink
It's been a long hard day and the boss drove me crazy
Watching the clock on the wall for the happy hour
