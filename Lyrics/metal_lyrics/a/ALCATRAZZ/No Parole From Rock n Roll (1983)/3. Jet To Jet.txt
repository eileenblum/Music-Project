On a short trip we made a landing
Then we were strangers in town
How they stared as we made our exit
We're white they're all brown
Dr. Livingstone where are you when we need you the most
We're white as ivory on the ivory coast

[1/2 Chorus]
Jet into jet

Eat their poison like true ambassadors
We will drink up their beer
So predictable washed out white
Men foreigners are here
Call me master I'll call you boy
If that's all that you need
How that wounds me just leave me here to bleed

[Solo]

Black mans burden is on his shoulder and keeps him well in his place
Two hundred pounds worth of megawatts
That smack him in the face
There's no reason to take the weight
Life's not strapped to your head
Don't wear the token till the token black is dead

[Chorus]
