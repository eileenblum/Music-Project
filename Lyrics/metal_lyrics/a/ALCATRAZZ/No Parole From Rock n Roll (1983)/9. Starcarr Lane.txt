Just a young boy's memory summer days
Chasing rabbits through the fields
Taking water from the well
And the warmth of the grandfather smile
And his magical eyes

[Chorus]
It's hard to go back again to be who we have been
Hot as the memory burns it's cold and wearing thin
(In Star Carr Lane)

By the light of Kerosene
Deals of cards and dominoes
Play for matches play for laughs
Flirting with the radio
Climb the stairs in the dark by the candlelight eye in the night

[Chorus]

All the stone faced sepia stares
Looking out with secret smiles
In defiance of the years
Remember me I knew you well
And the warmth of the grandfather
Smile from his magical eyes
