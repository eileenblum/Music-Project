The cold December day I came
You knew me well though I was a stranger
You suffer me
Why you suffer me
Oh suffer me
Why you suffer me I touched you
You felt my heart
Then I was born the second son
Oh how you suffer me
Oh you suffer me
Oh suffer me
Why did you suffer me

[Solo I]

Oh suffer me
Why did you? How could you? Suffer me
Suffer me
Who oh-oh

[Solo II &amp; Fade out]

Suffer me
