Street wise, smooth thighs, dress for your pleasure
Your old man says, "Young man, stand and deliver"
She just wants that hard stash, hot from your pocket,
She don't need your credit card
So shove it, if you've got it

Sailing on her waterbed
Side by side and head to head

Painted love, painted love, painted lover
Painted love, painted love, painted lover

Pin striped city tyke has a soft underbelly,
He's transfixed by the heel clicks
And he ducks down the alley
Silken legs stiletto spurred
Pulls you in to make you hers
