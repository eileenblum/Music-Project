One more hotel it's 12 o'clock we're checking out
Still confused and slow to move to get on the bus,
The driver keeps that Memphis smile for his good old boys
He's loaded them up and heads them out in the void.

We drive -- pass those trailers and trucks
We'll make good time with some kind of luck

Another victory, for sons and lovers
You gave us the power, you gave the power

It's not just one more show we know it's gotta be right
We work the songs then kiss the road a warm good night
