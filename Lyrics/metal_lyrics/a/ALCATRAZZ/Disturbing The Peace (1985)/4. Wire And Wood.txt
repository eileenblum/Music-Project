Down the street a snake of leather sliding off to war,
Out to fight the battle with the boys upon the boards,
Up against the disciples with their backs up to the walls,
They don't care, 'cos they can take the blast
They're just out to bust their balls!

In the arena the battle begins
They're eye to eye face to face...

They come back to feel the smack from the wire and the wood,
Pack that slap, don't take no crap from the wire and the wood

Crushed against the barricades
And worked up to a rage
How hot it gets, and how the leather sweats,
As they reach to claw the stage

In an hour or two,
The battle will be done
No one leaving in defeat
Both sides having won
Blinded by the silence calling them back home
