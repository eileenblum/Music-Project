He's just a kid and loves to ride
Taking the freeway, driving blind
Just like a loaded gun, he pushes down the hammer
Hard to fire

In the embrace of his gasoline lover
Her sleek body wraps all around
Turns on the radio, lights up his cigarette
Takes the lights up, dims them down
A silent Geisha, the perfect seducer
Knows someone is waiting too long

Oh will you be home tonight
Oh please say you'll be there

He's just a kid who loves to drive
To get out of sight out of his mind
He pushed the hammer down
And shot just like a bullet from a gun

Drunk on the fix of the powerful kick
As he shoots up from zero to speed
Has one more drink of the cold liquid courage
To keep on the level he needs
Soothed by the sound of the wheels on the ground
But he won't hear the tires when they scream...

Oh will you be home tonight
Oh will you be home tonight

Oh will you be home tonight
Oh will you be home tonight
