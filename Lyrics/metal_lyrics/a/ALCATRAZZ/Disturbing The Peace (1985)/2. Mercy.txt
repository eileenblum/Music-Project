Sister moon and brother sun
Shining down on my India
Spreading your light across the ground
Guiding the executioner
Great white warrior, you are the lonely hunter
Killing the prince of India
Killing the king in Africa
Tiger burning brightly crying tears of fire

Mercy, mercy, mercy

Chand bahen ar suray bhy
Shining down on my India
Chamakta hey mana barat ka upar
Guiding the lonely preditor

Tiger burning brightly crying tears of fire

Mercy, mercy, mercy
