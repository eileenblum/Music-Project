In the London rain the sun called "go west",
The American loves the way you speak English
And they watched you growing as their son for so long
How they long to embrace you, tell you, `This is home'

Beloved foreigner this your America
Wants you to stay forever
Beloved foreigner this your America
Wants you to stay forever

As you look down on the New York skyline
There's someone waiting for you among the crowd
He wants to be just like you, he wants to be a friend to you,

Reach inside, and just be part of you
He saved the photographs, he read the magazines
Making you part of the city

Beloved foreigner someone to crucify
Breaking the heart of the city

In the London rain the sun called "Go West"
The Americans love to hear you speak English
He took your autograph
Spit out the magazine
