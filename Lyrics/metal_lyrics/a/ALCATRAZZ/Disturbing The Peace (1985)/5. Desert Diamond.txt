Lie in Egyptian sands, Ethiopian overlord
Royal mountains stand
Guardian of the Kings
Sleep in your dusty sea
Silent shining desert diamond, sleep eternally

Eyes of a blinded lion, saw the age of the Pharaoh come,
And return to sand,
Gold and silver gone stripped from your virgin stone
Still you stand so strong and silent

Frozen by the sun

Desert diamond
Stone leonine
Desert diamond
Stone leonine

Silent shining
Desert giant
Ethiopian sons-diamond
