[G.Bonnet ,Y.Malmsteen &amp; J.Waldo]

Masters of the world hidden from our eyes
In the sun we grew sharing the same light
Elegant warrior my gun and your spear
Killers that keep our lives apart

Pictures from the air stole away your souls
Aerobatic thieves photographic freeze
Lead by the legend of Kree Nakoorie
The man that hides away from man so
hard to understand
