When darkness spreads through everything
Black clouds descend, mist strangles life
Deception springs, confusing tides
From bitter winds and shard of ice

Through dying woods of lifeless wrecks
Of shallow pools awash with cess
Dark soil interred, bid part the earth
Your soul immersed, exhale and swallow dirt
