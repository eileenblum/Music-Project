Blaspheme my name and blaspheme my works
Drinketh from my chalice and swallow dirt

Such time of delusion
My gospel, divine
There are rats in the basket
And scum in the wine

Still you will hunger and still you will thirst
Stillborn are your children, slaves to my words
Immaculate concepts, the masochist lust
Submit to obedience or be crushed into dust!
