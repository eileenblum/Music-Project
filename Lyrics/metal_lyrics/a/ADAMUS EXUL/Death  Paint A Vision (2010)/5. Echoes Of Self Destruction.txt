Desolate, dark landscapes
Misery awaits, enter the void
Eternal unrest, smoke and haze
Bloodshot eyes
Can't you see how close you are?

Death and ruin, caving chaos
Reach the precipice - cast you down!

Twisted dead! Skyless world!

Shades of shadow, overturned
Emptiness, nothing left
Reach the end
