Sanguine hatred, a thirst for Zion's blood
Moral decline, triumph of the will
Triumph of the will!
Dark clouds gather, beware the coming storm
Cowards collect, fires burn everywhere

[Spoken excerpt, Adolf Hitler's 'Mein Kampf':]
For if the Jewish people's instinct of self-preservation is not smaller but
larger than that of other peoples, if his intellectual faculties can easily
arouse the impression that they are equal to the intellectual gifts of other
races, he lacks completely the most essential requirement for a cultured
people, the idealistic attitude..

In the Jewish people the will to self-sacrifice does not go beyond the
individual's naked instinct of self-preservation. Their apparent great sense of
solidarity is based on the very primitive herd instinct that is seen in many
other living creatures in this world.

Scavengers salivate
You fear now and you believe
Soon you will know fear!
Darkness in purity, the conduit for decline

Reality shifts, as was foretold
Extinguish the Star of David!
The ruins of Zion!
