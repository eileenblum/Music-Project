Grace is lifted, revealing a worn clitoris
Her loins smeared with blood
She crawls satisfied to whore anew

Grace beget the leper
Spreading lies of perseverance
Rewarding life, and stigmatising the wise

Christ birthed salvation
Gifts unto the blind
Rewards for the loyal
Everlasting life

Death, paint a vision
A landscape, sublime
A frame without colour
A world without life
