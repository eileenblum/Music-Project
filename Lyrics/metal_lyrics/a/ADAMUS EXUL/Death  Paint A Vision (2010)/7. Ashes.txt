Sick, black despair, a depression monologue
Black storm weather, crippling mental fog
On forges descent, through bleakest sorrow
Deeper she went..

As darkness is, cloud mental disruption
Cold feeling overcome
Only for a moment she walks alone
Beyond the tumult

Life and death!
Scars and flesh.. virus life consume
Sickness scars the surface
She knew she was rotting
Even before she slipped away

As shadows coalesce
And sunlight recedes
Slowly.. slowly..
Two worlds become one
