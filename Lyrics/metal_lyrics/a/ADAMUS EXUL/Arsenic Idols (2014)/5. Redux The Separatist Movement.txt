Stagnating within the confines
Pressure building the storm

A procession of indignification - Proceed to crumble...
Proceed to crumble!

The temple is covered in filth
smeared across your eyes
spine severed - disemboweled
Ignorance forever prevails!

Ignorance forever prevails!

Defecate on my words!
Spit in my face!
Burn down my sanctuary!
Piss on my ashes!

Seal your own fate - putrid and vile
your temple - a whorehouse of self-righteous back-stabbing for all of eternity!!!!!!
FOR ALL OF ETERNITY!
