Self-righteous imbeciles excrete upon the throne
empty souls striving to opress
ejaculating venom upon purity
eyes that see nothing - hearts that feel nothing!

Eternal pariahs, inflamed expression
Wretched in agony, condemned to solitude!

Bitter black void hunting
Striving to engulf all meaning!

No tourniquet can hold this together
For the wounds are exposed and you are smothered!
Your dark eyes will never see - your charred heart condemned to suffer!
Empty vessels ripped apart by their own chains of oppression

Floating in abyss - so high above us all
Spewing blood!
The end of the road!
Hollow - empty - VOID!

Hollow empty
Hollow empty void!
