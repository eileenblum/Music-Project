Nauseating sickness permeates
Traumatizing cells
Cranial agony - exhaustion takes hold

Strive for detachment
Pursue isolation
The sweat of desperation

All ahead appears empty
Cracked and crumbling
Slip into mechanical state

Awakening full of fear and dread
Desire the eternal dark
Final grievance
Final grievance

Mind asphyxiation
Into the abyss we cross
Serotonin deprivation

Self-pollution - waste away!
Repetition into eternity!
Self-pollution - waste away!
Repetition into eternity!
