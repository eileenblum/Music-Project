These are dark times, vultures scavenge what they can
Blood trickels from the flesh, never hits the floor

These are dark times, vultures scavange what they can
Blood trickels from the flesh, never hits the floor

For all cruelty in the world
For the agonising pain of life
For megalomaniacal pigs
Scattered ashes of discord!

Scattered ashes of discord!

Death remains victorious
Maggots will always crawl and feed
The inferno blazes on
The inferno blazes on!!!

But the eternal flame will flicker out!

Skin torn off my flesh - flesh torn off my bones
Single motion of eternal destruction
Destined to rot - destined to burn
Destined to rot - destined to burn!

Desolate wasteland sears my eyes
Mysteries of life, irrelevant and futile
No one to blame - we chose our fate
The flame extinguished in the blink of an eye

Your dogma - your idols
Your dogma - your idols
Your dogma - your idols
YOUR POISON!!!
WORTHLESS TOURNIQUET!!!

Mountain of pain - overdue
Death will come - inevitable end

Desolate wasteland sears my eyes
Mysteries of life, irrelevant and futile
No one to blame - we chose our fate
The flame extinguished in the blink of an eye

Chaos shall reign
Chaos shall reign
Erased from history!
CHAOS REIGNS!!!

Chaos reigns, chaos reigns, erased from history, chaos reigns, chaos reigns, chaos reigns...........
