I am the heart of battle
I am the arm of warriors
My father, he gave me the heavens
My father, he gave me the earth
He who was alive yesterday
He who was alive is dead today
The thunders of wrath and judgement are numbered
And harbored in the earth, so open the gates
The voices travel with the wind â listen, feel itâs power
Fear is not! for in time it will reveal the true powers
The powers and the might of the black divine
The luminescence of darkness
Chaos â void of creation
Chaos â rise
I am the one who comes forth of frost and show
With a shadow cast and soon unveils
The northern darkness glory
I am the angel that never felt
All the mysteries are mine
I lead you to rebirth though death and destruction
Just take my hand
For I am the angel that never left
All the mysteries are mine
I lead you to rebirth though death and destruction
I am the one who comes forth of frost and show
With a shadow cast now I unveil all
The northern darkness glory
Creation â understanding
Destruction â transformation
Renewal â wisdom
Just take my hand
Chaos â void of creation, chaos rise!
Chaos â it is done
