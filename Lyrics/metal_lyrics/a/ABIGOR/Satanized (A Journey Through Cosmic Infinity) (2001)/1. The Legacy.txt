Overwhelming fear
As all nightmares come to life
Extracted pain unfolds within this realm of fear
A change of visions extend my mind
Psychotropic pulse
I am the chosen one â Satanâs son
A flash of shivering stardust enlightens
The truth beyond the portals
Realityâs borders fade â replaced by liquid glass
Modulation tunes reveal
All your tears unleashed
All souls wrapped in plastic and wonder how
It must hurt to see all the fears unleashedâ¦
A battlefield of indescribable beauties
Like silver statues that glide
In everlasting oceans depths
Legions march onwards in their perpetual cycle
But soon our journey reach itâs end
And since ages I felt that kind of satisfaction
As my one and only axe strike hits the hand
Of my chosen victim that kneels crying before me
Oh how I enjoyed to see him cry and finally die
Now your prophetic redeemer is dead
But take a look around and understand
What has changed, say to do really miss him?
So forget all set up morals
And let eternal wisdom flow
Cosmic revelation â demonic incarnation
Collective concentration â total devastation
Psychotropic pulse
I am the chosen one â Satanâs son
A flash of shivering stardust enlightens
The truth beyond the portals
Set ablaze the fires of Satan
