Awakening
Although I thought I would never again
In a room with no begining or end
But for sure there is a center
Nothing but vastness
And an object of supreme magic
A mirror shaped as a pyramid
Black but still reflecting
My hands and arms but not my face
I'm watching myself moving
Towards this blasphemy
Attracted I float nearer and nearer
Trying to step aside
But my journey ends behind the glass
A sea coloured red is awaiting me there
Everything is upside down
Am I destined to drown
Surfaces belong to other dimensions
Hell is above
And heaven awaits far below
Deeper and deeper I sink
And scream without sound
Unrealistic reality or a dream
In the state of being awake
For sure this will be
My greatest victory or my final defeat
If I am demon all the angels must die
