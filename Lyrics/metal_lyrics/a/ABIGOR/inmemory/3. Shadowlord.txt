Running but an end is not in sight Trying to escape the claws of god
Lights are hunting me to take my life Inquisition tries to make me
burn Flames burnt high I have seen my brothers die
Revenge guides my way All their churches burn one day But I promise
that I'll sin again And no fire makes me turning white I give my
life for you the only one Lord of Shadows, this is for you
The circles shined bright in these lost days We danced naked under
the fullmoon And become one with the demon of war We drank blood and
cried in lust Shadowlord... The forest offered grimly shelter Noctus
! Esus ! Boreas ! Zephyrus ! Hectate offered us deep ecstasy
