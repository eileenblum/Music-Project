Eyes Upon Me Watching Me in My Perpetual Sleep Dreams Deceive Me My
Future Depends on a Mindless Dream I've Fallen From Promises Damned
to Take Risks on My Own The Masterful Science That Freezes Your Mind
And Your Soul The Wretched Dream Is Realized The Human Race is to be
Crystalized Thoughts Of Laughter Filling The Head Of The Master In
Charge Worlds Of Wonder Is This A Cure or a Painless Death I'll
Fight And Resist Till They All See The End That is Near The Doctors
The Lawers And G-Men Are Living In Fear Living My Life With One
Distant Hope
A Cure That Will Kill My Invincible Foe the grave
