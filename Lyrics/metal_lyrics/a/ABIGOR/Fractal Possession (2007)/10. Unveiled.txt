When time stands still and sparks of burning flesh enlighten the glimmering horizon -
Reality's borders fade, unreal...
It's hard to face the truth as your reality bursts...
Real pain defines what you forgot through your wasted life based on mortal morals.
Pain reveals the real existence, it leads to understanding:
If you seek life, then prepare for death.
