My heart that once raged in battles of fire now feels so old...
Still the taste of blood on my lips - I just fix this problem with a blade...
"Sharpen the dagger and open your veins!"
Stone cold is death's bowl and all that's left is ash.
Death is not a punishment, just the gate that leads me into the ultimate existence...
