Oh, grand machine of desperation - Deliver thy sermon.
We will chant with you in a choir of void filled souls.
We feed you, god of the grotesque, our flesh shall serve you well.
Welcome to the realm of endless death, where we are nothing but slaves...
All colours are dead and unreal now, oh great kingdom of the withering...
