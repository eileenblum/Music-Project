[Thesis:]
The devil, great consumer of mortality, appears as the destroyer of cause and effect, and of God's linearity.
Hence man can be merged in His infinity.

Monument, o mighty monument of time!

We're marching through the ongoing passage of time
Life eating... collapsing... drowning...
Pointed but without origin
Continuum... sequence... pendulum...

We provoke spiritual leadership
We step out of this miserable race
We become one with His principle
We are one
We invoke the magnificent purity
We invoke the almighty black flame
We become one with His principle
We are one - we are none

Locked and trapped inside thy self
Thou shalt never be free
Dissecting process marches on
Without limitation
A solemn decay procession
Cycles structuring around thee
Like a maelstrom

[Ecclesiastes 3:1-8:]
A time to kill and a time to heal
A time to tear down and a time to build up
A time to weep and a time to laugh
A time to mourn and a time to dance
A time to throw stones and a time to gather stones
A time to embrace and a time to shun embracing
A time to search and a time to give up as lost
A time to keep and a time to throw away
A time to tear apart and a time to sew together
A time to be silent...
And a time to speak

PERPETUA SERVITUS

Thou seem to be separated in entities
Consumed and erased you creep and crawl
A sequence of extermination

Constellations evolve out of prima materia
Periodically transforming and enduring
Focusing on metamorphosis
Where shall all this lead to?
Grand Master Satan lead us through!
Time - father - reaper
Life eater

Time is Satan's way of keeping everything from happening at once.
[Albert Einstein]

Perpetual cycle devoid of all logic
So cold and bare of all reason
When nothingness becomes even more desperate
A moving mausoleum of eternal death

A delicate cut through the heart of goodness
Tyrants of an alternate faith rise in clarity

SATURN ESCHATON

We provoke spiritual leadership
We step out of this miserable race
We become one with the fragmenting principle
We are one - we are none
Bloody knives and utopias shall be hidden
Yet there is a weapon that will never be found
We the shadow's priests - we are absence
The endless not-knot - the void's presence

Directing the anxiety circus in eternity
Monument, o great monument of time
O you black colossus of presence

TABULA RASA

At the heart of it all...

I will no longer rise
Nor will I fall
From towers shadowing the sky
All logic comes tumbling down
As one and one equals none

When Icarus' ways lead to Phoenix' grace
Victory I praise
Illuminated - resurrected - gloria victoria!
HALLELUJAH!
Alleluia... alleluia...

Come ye father and reap my soul
Come ye, come ye father
Unveil it all

Now and forever we fall
We fall!
