Empty the vessel and hollow the shell
Come, toungues of fire
Abandon all earthly, glance deep into hell
Purge and inspire

The act of worship sets us ablaze
Demonic burden, ecstatic delight
A monument of malicious sonority
Our humble sacrifice, devotional rite

Revealed in the flesh
Justified in the spirit
Seen by the chosen
Heard by the few

All earthly vanities of existence
Exceeded by tones supreme
Melodies older than mortality
Enormous as death itself

Praise his name

Chosen are the ones
Who have command of the language
That needs neither mouth nor words
Who transform the inmost truth to notes
Who form sculptures reflecting his glory
And spread the gospel of the horned

Weâve been granted the most precious gift
We are element and entirety
Performing the everlasting cycle
Without beginning or end
Find the unimaginable paradise
Amidst these pits of hell

Those who chant his hymns
Hallowed be their names
Immortal is the choir
Only the highest art
Supreme and impure
Purified through his will

Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of him
