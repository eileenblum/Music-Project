Souls of infidel men
Form a fertile soil
Like dusky forest grow
On rotten leaves below

Souls of infidel men
Wither and burn
Like arid grass on dead ground
Forsaken, eternally bound


We feed on the essence of mortal weakness
The flames chain the fallen and proud
Holyness, purity, and all gifts of light
Long vanished, decayed and dead
Buried by godâs children eons ago
Heathens, sordid and profane


We are the legion, the leveling horde
True to the laws of the horned
Faithful and strengthened and
Fiercely unbound
Lurking to gather the mourned

Planted is the seed of him
And no blood flows in our veins
Nurtured by souls of infidel men
In the kingdom where darkness
Forever reigns

Soil of souls

Behold and see
Glorious our realm will be
Immortalis et semper fidelis
