The first duty of the earthborn is worship
As it directs the soul towards him
Because it is him man is bound to as mystic source and purpose
Protean king of thousand faces and forms
Only when man accepts his highest reign and truth by revelation
Then man is above all welk and rotten
So I proclaim the glory of our lord

To the devil, the father of all
We praise thee
To Satan, his mysteries hidden within all scripts and cults
We praise thee
To Lucifer, who touched man and brought knowledge on earth
We praise thee
To him, who is above us, in us, as well as below
We praise thee

We praise thee by our existence!

Glory
O, rebellious son
Glory
Blackwinged angel, fallen one

To the devil, the father of all

When man's entire conduct is catered to him
When man's worship is exercised with surrender
Then man's soul is directed towards him
Then man is above all welk and rotten
