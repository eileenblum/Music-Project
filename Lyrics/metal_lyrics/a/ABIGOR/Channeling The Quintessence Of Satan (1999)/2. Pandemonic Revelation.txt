A hunger for insanity within illusions infinity
A heart of dreaming ice and burning flesh caught in passion
The ultimate pain shines as a star upon God
And his creation that gaze at the horizon of the dead

A source of tranquility obscure the mind
Paralysed by abyssmal revelations
Endless oceans formed by skulls
Pandemonic outbreaks cause chaos within the universe

Blood for Satan - Tears of God

Lords from beyond fly through the astral skies
From the ashes of burning hell
Satan's legions rise again
To sweep upon earth in flames' disguise
Within the gloomy eyes
You always saw the darkness rise

So think about it
Because it's the last moment you will remember
Forever burning in your mind
The cruel and ruling all consuming unity
