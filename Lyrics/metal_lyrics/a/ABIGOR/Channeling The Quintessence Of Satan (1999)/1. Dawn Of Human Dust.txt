A newborn day waits to surrect
But what will cover dawn?
Neither begging nor pleading will find ears
When all the angel hordes have gone to war
For a final twisted dance
A twisted dance into death
Writhe within the emptiness
Writhe because there lurks endless pain
To satisfy our brothers slain
To satisfy our sisters drained in flames
The dark age shall rise again
And ten for one we will revenge what has been done
Bathe in flames to clean your souls
Your silent screams guide your eternal fall
One another you will tear
Your flesh out of your bodies burnt by fear
Now keep your breath and feel inside
Can you feel... it's the time
Is this judgement day?
We feel the signs supporting us
But shall the moonlight bathe again our midnight prayers
To reach the aim we're longing for
To rise up from the human dust we dwelled this earth
The trust in us and victory
Drives us against our enemy
Our kingdoms we are dreaming of
And hoping gives us sense to be
So let us bring an end to this
And lead the first hit to the faces
Of the crowds out of the light
For broken now lies all their might
From all directions coming in trembling with fear
The herd of God sentenced to death
I lead the first sword strike to eternity
You cannot flee from certain death
When dawn has come this final day pass with your dying breath
