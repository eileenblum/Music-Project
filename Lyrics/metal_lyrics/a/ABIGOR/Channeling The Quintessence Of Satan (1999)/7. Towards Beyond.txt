Through imperial halls of ice
Where I left bloodstained pillars
Resplendent seem these silver walls
Silent phantoms I burn
Towards the emptiness
Towards the gorge

Onwards, onwards... to hell, to hell
I was the could through which angels fell
Onwards, onwards... to hell, to hell
I was torture, death and fatal spell

Onwards - through another vortex of colours
To hell - where I left devouring darkness
Onwards - opaque visions I haunt
To hell - impervious seem these delusive lights

My journey begun
As you unveiled my face
As I ripped of my skin
And my demon was roused
Thrones and dominions mean nothing to me
As long as I seek the truth
Thus I break man and ice
On my journey towards beyond
