Melting in the heat
Beloved Succubus I lick your lips in fever dreams

Pandora sweet
Your hot flesh sucks on mine as I flow deep into thee

My bride in red
In lust our souls ablaze scream with the winds of hell

My high priestess of death
Drowned in the seed of doom you spread

You - my blessed grim reaper
Writhing in you brute embrace
You - you breathe miasma
I taste your kiss of pestilence

Pandora - glorious countess of plague and fevers
Tears darken my eyes
Dripping on you naked breast
You lick my flesh
Greying, decaying by your touch, my body wreck
Convulsive grasp
My flesh is stricken, shivers run across my skin

I face my death, rape my fading life
And ride my fevery soul through thunderstorms in Hades' depths

You - you're the flesh untamed
I - I face my death unchained
