[performed by Abigor]Divination choir of the broken winged sing Thantifaxath's march through tunnels blood-tinged:

"Schreie in Todesnot
Marter im Abendrot
Worte scharf wie ein Schaffott
Dammerung fur den falschen Gott"

The devil (diabolus, le diable) is not identical with Satan the adversary and not with Lucifer the black illuminator but He is the all-spawning all-demanding soul eater
We offer ours and consume theirs
May the descendants of Abraham ascend to heaven
We descend into hell

Above
On dark soil he walks
Inhaling (particles of) God's aether
Spitting flames and nails, piercing sonics oscillating, permeating
The membrane of worlds - many

Son of titans, father of angels - adored
In desert he suffered and transformed
Tempted the holy lamb, goat of man, sin his bread

One daemon infernal, eternal, abysmal
Protean myth-bearer, stormbringer
Guide into the ultimate
Below

Sub specie aeternitatis:
Murder the idolatrous cherubim, kill the keeper of the gates
Douse their flaming swords of space and time
Sacrifice the whore Mary Magdalene on the altar of redemption
Eternity unfolds
Devoid of witness to the saviour's heavenly ascension

Descend into hell
Aiming straight into the nous of Christ

Divination choir of Thantifaxath sings:
"Come, receive the devil's revelation
Chant Lord Satan's song of negation
Sing Lucifer's hymn of liberation
And seraphim's grotesque strangulation"

Plunging angelic elysium into chthonic under-worlds
I bring down Horus and Maat in the abyss where aeons end
I reverse the 22 and feed dimensions to the I essence of all
Azathoth energies, anti-aeon, Yog Sothoth
Your adversarial enemies

Sleep - fall into the shadows of your subconscious
Meditation - tap into all points of the snake-spine
Trance - float into vorago's tunnels

Sink into the ground, decompose
Transform like the fallen arose
Fall into sleep meditation trance
Awakened by the chthonic demons' dance

We leave the waters of the world behind
And sink into the regions where fire forms the clay

Descend into Hades, chant the foul tunes of rotten flesh
Where the seething magma of raw energy resides
Mercurian prima materia engulfs
(Between worlds) Abraxas awaits at the gate

Satan
Grant me the entrance to your tunnels
Sleep meditation trance
Drink blood-wine and feast on flesh to step down
Your bread feeds the children of the chasm
