in this glorious age
of darkness and death
of witchcraft andfire
foul stench rises up from the depths

he hears our chanting - we obey his call
Lord Satan's arrival - the abyss takes its toll

the plague of rats is welcomed
the pestilence is spread

Lord Satan's arrival
silent beast, ghoul of worms, king of the dead

woeful is the sight on those who walk
in rotten trance
bodies twist like branches deformed
he commands and executes, grotesque the dance
and mute, not one sound breaks the eternal night

all bones, rotten flesh, scythe in hand
he appears as the winged reaper, horned dancer
lifting his instrument, darting his pestilent tongue
and the golden angel of salvation is burning
