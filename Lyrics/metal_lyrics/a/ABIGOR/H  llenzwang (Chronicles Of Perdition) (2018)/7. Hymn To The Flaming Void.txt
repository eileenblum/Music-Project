carried through the absolute all-abyss
unforgiving is the infinity of darkness
his breath of flames surrounds and occupies all

all motion freezes to moving stasis of lava matter
fire without end
end of time, time for the end

slit throats cut veins rape souls eat hearts
plunge humanity into the pits of eternity
blood lakes black holes deep chasms
all dimensions crumble

when mirrors crack
sinister energy permeates
reality melts into lentous states
pouring over from the astral world
the flaming void consumes

death spawns changes, senses overstrain
the omniverse dissolves, evil reigns supreme
Satan wields his axe
all imploding chaos arises
