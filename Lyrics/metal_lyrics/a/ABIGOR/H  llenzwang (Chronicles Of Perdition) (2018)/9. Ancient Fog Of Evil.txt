An old cloud like a notion of times gone by

the scent of death and decay - preserved
in the past's perpetual haze
all trees sing rotten hymns

the soil is lifeless where evil dwells
let the eternal night encompass any light

when shadows mingle with the vapours of the earth
when thoughts become manifest and deeds dissolve

Azazel roars the tragedies of man
the devil raises chaos against the holy plan
Satan whispers primordial lies
Pandora spawns the Lord of flies
Belial thrusts to the sun's demise
from the depths a fog will rise
misty spirits, cursed ghosts, all that never dies
forms the ancient fog of evil
