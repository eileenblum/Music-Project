I witness all the falling souls consumed

Reward me father for I have sinned
Baptized by fire, servant of Thy will

I'm still wide awake

Worms come devour, feed on entrails and brain
My unclean spirit shatters all earthly bane

Restfully I'm awaiting the moment of descent
Through the soil of human filth I still hear their hearts pounding

Dislodging the burden of physique after a lifetime of seeking His manifestations

Deciphering the writings and signs
No martyr of flesh will ever receive His divine grace

No one can stretch against the heavens while rooting deep in the ground
To pass the gate one must leave contrasts, views, poles and sound
Only the haethen rots within the cage of a horizon
Opening doors of mortality will only build walls

Murder all doubts, break the chains that bind
Blessed are the seeing, damned are the blind

Worlds of the antithesis move towards me
The supreme command defies flesh and blood
Smother all infidel men, hallowed be Thy name
Bow down, confess and acknowledge

And I witness all the falling souls consumed
