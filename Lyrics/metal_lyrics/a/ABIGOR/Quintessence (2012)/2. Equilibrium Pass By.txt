Obtained are now all wisdom's thrones
Once desired, splendidly clear, envisioned through my inner-eye

Extinguished equilibrium as I became immortal
No blood but time flows through my veins
Dimensions and matter, dissolved and confound

I spit forth tongues of fire, no blood to soak this battleground

Ultimate knowledge is a vast plateau, concealed for millenniums
Unknown, unseen, yet spirit longs for nourishment, for eons and still
Thus I must break the cycle of life and death and bring an end to the greatest of all sins

Dying is the sacrilige of man-divine

A new age rises to my outstreched arms, an age of uprising or eternal stagnation
No more blood and no more flesh, all in hibernation, subconscious drama
The wisdom's flame lights the labyrinthian tunnel, all glass and mirror reflecting my osseous face
Bleak are the eyes that had witnessed worlds crashing into the void

Apocalypse passes by... apocalypse passes by... equilibrium pass by

Must I settle down on this throne to close my eyes?
Is this really what I am striving for? An infinite existence without any challenge
What is the purpose of a spirit supreme when four equals one and equilibrium never ends?

The humble disciple never seeks but finds
