The shadow of mortality slays the illusions of infinity
When a heart burns with passion the intellect yields faith

The flaming star of salvation shines upon man
While God's creation gazes at the horizon of death

Views of endless oceans of bones attract the eye
Paralyzed is the soul by such divine revelations

Chants of tranquility obscure the heathen's mind, join in the choir of the damned
We demand a new order of chaos within the universe and raise pandemonium on earth

Our blood for Satan, their tears for God

Our blood for Satan, their tears for God
Our blood for Satan, their tears for God

And the vacuum of souls yawns inbetween

Those who never confessed roam the limbus forever
Feed their pain to the demons and their hope to the angels

From the ashes, from the fiery pits of Hell, Satan's legions rise again

Subtle shifts the day to night, slowly fade doctrines of light
Without the roaring of a final battle, without the colossal act of disgrace
With every sin and every lie, you could watch the monuments of darkness rise

The last moment bears the revelation, the cruel and ruling all-consuming unity
