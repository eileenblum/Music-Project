Just one more night is missing, the night that ends the endlessness
Sky's still alit by radiant stars 'til our belief's severe enough

The strings of silence - hushed
The strings of silence - smooth

Within a few hours all signs will read storm... listen!

Spirits roam and gather bodies, many-voiced the speechless arise
Cadavers once of proud existence, now chained to His storm

Chained to His storm!

The air approaches to condense, channelled, electric and charged
Oscillating in the circle's centre, coiling and circling and narrowing

The voices sound higher and higher, the light rises faster and faster
The silence is smothered by hiss, the sonics are piercing the bodies and thunder is shaking the ground
The elements are in uproar, all signs now read storm
Insignia shine dark ablaze from a violent encounter of sulphur and lead
Sparks, fire, thunder and lightning, furious tempests of the apocalypse

The world holds its breath, a moment like an eternity

An infinitely rising coil is merging with the cone
O, magical miraculous horn, stretch out into eternity

Atmosphere's resounding with claps of heavy wings
The storm of hell will never halt, driving angels and demons round its vortex
Perpetual magical battle for the glorious return of Him
