A newborn day waits to surrect, but what will cover dawn?
Neither begging nor pleading will find ears when all the angel hordes have gone to war

Processions of flesh creep over the earth
Welcomed to get in line for a final twisted dance
O, what a gruesome sight, the ghastly cortege of death
Repent, bathe in fire, cleanse your souls
Writhe within the moment of emptiness, sinful lot await your eternal fall

Awaiting the lamb to break the seals, so that the seven trumpets resound
Headless hordes herald the beginning of the end

The angel of fear burns infidel men
The angel of regret whips the skin off their bones
Thus hold your breath and harken close
His darkness is final, His will grandiose
Can you feel their presence, this is judgement day

All signs are pointing to kingdom come

No sea of holy water could purify your vessels soiled
Swept from the shores of life to the sharp edges of death
Heathen plague rot away and face your destiny
We rise up from the human dust
To dwell here on earth between heaven and hell
We witness foolishness end in despair

You'll be buried under the falling stars, you'll be drowned in the poisoned sea
Pest crowned herd, sentenced to die, this final day passes with your dying breath
