Through the halls of the enigma, built on giant bloodstained pillars
Resplendent seem these silver walls, silent phantoms I haunt

Towards the emptiness, towards the gorge
Towards the emptiness, towards the gorge

Onwards, onwards to Hell
I am the cloud through which the angels fell
Onwards, onwards to Hell
I am torture, death and fatal spell

Onwards - through a purgatory of colours
To hell - into the devouring darkness
Onwards - opaque visions I pursue
To hell - impervious delusive lights

Quest, creed, humility
Swordstrokes of ignorence block the path to Him
Doubt, regret, disbelief
Ye wavering forms draw near so I smite you again

I am on my way to infinity, I am drowning in sway and I'm nothing
My transition is pure yet unclean, everything I am is in Him

My path is omnidirectional since He unveiled my soul
I ripped off my fleshly shell, roused is the demon, spirit unclean
Thrones and dominions mean nothing to me as long as I seek the truth
Thus I break man, stone and ice on my journey towards beyond

Dignified man awaken! Acknowledge His revelations!
Praise His manifestations or perish in flames!

Channelling the quintessence of Satan
