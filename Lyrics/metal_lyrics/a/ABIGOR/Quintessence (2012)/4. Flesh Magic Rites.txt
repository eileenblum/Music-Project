In the ancient tradition of conjuration, I'm evoking my bestial urge

I raise blackened magic to the heavens, words like spears against the light

So, appear and bring forth what I'm yearning for
Flesh is slave to the spirit's reign, creatures enslaved in this spiteful act

Submissive servants to my rite

Summoning the old fire that licks and consumes

Souls victimized and presented to Him

What flame burns brighter than desire in a violent ritual rage
Sublimating the lowest human instincts
Lust, pain and passion as sinful gifts
Wildfire in the heart of man, channelled and overcome

Utilizing the flesh, elevating the spirit to grant me powers beyond nature
So let the earth open up and spew whores, sexual rites to praise His name

Sitri! I command your tongues of fire! Iao Sabao!

Unclean flesh purify my spirit, set me ablaze on the climax of sin
