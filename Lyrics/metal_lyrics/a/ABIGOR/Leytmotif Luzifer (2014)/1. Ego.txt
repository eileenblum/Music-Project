Filled with humbleness and tempted by pride I kneel before you
I did not command but accept the fires you send
For not my hands receive and give, but through yours I deliver
Incomplete yet not unjust, and with you I shall burn

Veni sancte spiritos
Come and fill my vessel!

Grant me the right to speak
Clothe me with the fabric of perception
Here I am, bare and bleeding, facing your vast magnificence

Veni sancte spiritos
Come and fill my vessel!

Am I worthy, is my dignity enow
Cathechise your 7th disciple
Your Spears shall pierce my nescience

Who is higher than me, who else has your authority
Is my arrogance the sole ordeal in front of you?

Do these rites legitimate me to evangelise
Will you guide me through the entrails of the Earth
And accept my sacrifice

In the dirt, in orans posture
Presenting the litany
What more is there to offer than myself
My deeds and thoughts, my anguish and joice

Indulging in the shadow of your splendour
Building Cathedrals not of stones but words and tones
Bind not these hands of yours, but anoint them with strength
Fill this ardent vessel with your fiery revelation
