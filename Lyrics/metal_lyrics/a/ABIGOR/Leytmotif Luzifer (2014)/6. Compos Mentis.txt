Not in humility we look down
But resolute we stare into the abyss
For the righteous falls 7 times a day
And depravity paves the way into damnation

Rejoice! Powers of hell
Shadow legions, darkness descendants
Exult and gather all around Satan's throne
Lucifer, our lord is risen
Enthroned upon deniers bones
Thus sound the trumpets of doom
Rejoice!

Rejoice, o earth in sunken splendour
Vanished in the brightness of your king
Satan has conquered, once and for all
For he has redeemed us with his infinite fall
Inverted Eden and bled for Adam's sin

Mad laughter and disharmony
Resound, ye songs, in ecstasy
Chant well his gospel, cry aloud, inflame the fires of hell
Scorched be feathers, flesh and skin
All Choirs and armies nw join in
Exult and rejoice to the honour of him
And so we sin

And so we sin, fall and rise herein this dirt

Born out of dust, but fire we became
To the great dragon we have served all the hearts impaled
On crimson pillars pointing to Megiddo
Assuaging his hunger, quenching his thirst
With the endless stygian stream
Made of all blood and all tears of all angels and saints
We cut the flesh open and proclaim the rise of us through him

Martyrs of the earth
We praise your strength of transformation
Martyrs of the heavens
We bath in your feces and blood
And summon the
Martyrs of hell

Sing to the honour of him
