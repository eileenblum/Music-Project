Through one single man sin came upon earth
One single man is enough to open up eternity

So take this yoke of him and bear

Take the order and sacrifice this new covenant
Holy oil, Candles and blood

Drink from this chalice
Taste from the most forbidden fruit
Flesh opens the membership
In the mystic body of him

Become the tempter!

May the painful burden of these sacred words
Become holy privilege
And meaningful purpose of existence
May the sole gesture of you once scorned vessels
Become fiery reality

Feast on the body and become the impure!

Per aditum, per adoratum
All renewal in him
Per gustum et locotionem
All renewal in him
Per tactum, per gressum
All renewal in him
