A falling mist surrounds the horizon
as a chilling sight disrupts my stare
There before me a wickedness arises
drawing me ever closer to it's lair

Down beneath this realm of peace
fall down and pray lest you be enslaved

Now as shadows take hold of me 
they're longing to be free of any earthly desire
Calling out the enemy knows my name
as it proclaims we hide....inside your dreams

Each passing moment brings panic down around me 
unveiling the threat of eternal rest
The sound of laughter with the images approaching
confirms they will rid me of my breath

Now as shadows take hold of me 
they're longing to be free of any earthly desire
Calling out the enemy knows my name
as it proclaims we hide....inside your dreams

Inside subconscious there is nothing there
but it all seems so real

Caught in the grasp of reverie
there is one chance to be saved
Put hope aside and follow me
let it be known there's a way.....out

When all of nightime is covered with suspicion
and no one knows what lies ahead
Only then do the images awaken
and prey upon our innocence

Down beneath this realm of peace
fall down and pray lest you be enslaved

Now as shadows take hold of me 
they're longing to be free of any earthly desire
Calling out the enemy knows my name
as it proclaims we hide....inside your dreams
