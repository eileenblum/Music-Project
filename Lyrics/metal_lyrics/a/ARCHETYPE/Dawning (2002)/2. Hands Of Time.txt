Let go of anger and offer youself unto me
this night

I am the reason you fear the light
Summon the demon hide what you say
the pain is the answer and why you obey

There was a time when our faith was alive
saddened by truth we all must find a way

Give me your fallen hear them weep
watching and waiting for release
Feel the power I bestow
my untold desire is all you will know

This is the time when our faith must survive
gather your strength we rise at the break of day

It was just a forbidden lair
hands of time have taken us there
With this yearning resistance is born
to carry on

Foresaken dreamer condemn me and alter your fate

Fearful of torment my lies speak
wretched believers banish me
Hidden amongst them lying in wait
a painful reminder that I will create

This is the time when our faith must survive
gather your strength we rise at the break of day

It was just a forbidden lair
hands of time have taken us there
With this yearning resistance is born
to carry on
