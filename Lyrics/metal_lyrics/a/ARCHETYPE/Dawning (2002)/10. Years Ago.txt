Gone today without a whisper
set forth to claim a life lost so many years ago

In silence he stares at the sky
and waits for a moment of mercy
The vision that stands by his side
is calling on forces within to reach out alone

Sworn to be remembered for the promise he made to keep
Fearful of any encounters as they may darken and invade his destiny

Captured by fear in the dead of night watching shadows cross the gound
Hiding beneath the dim moonlight they speak without a sound
I can see why others would never want to dream
Take my hand and I will make you believe
your time is near

The memories arise 
reliving the moment when her spirit dies 
A portait burned inside his mind
so many years ago

And still he wanders on
through days of exile leaving fate undone
until the time when all can be taken down

Where the fires are burning
where the innocent fell
Forced to the edge by a vastness of fury
trading heaven for a glimpse of hell

Now that the time has come to relinquish
there's no more sorrow to bare
Resurrecting the ageless emotion
leading onward into this despair

Possessed by an image where two souls unite
destined to seek and avenge
Falling through sorrow concealed in the night
when does it finally end

Take my hand and I'll lead you onward
to a land so far away
I alone am the one you follow
the only one who sees your pain
Her fading image is out there waiting
a hearts desire so incomplete
As a savior I make this offer
to walk on water to set you free

Take my dreams
I shall believe

Years lost in exile have taken their last
her fading image found
Within an instant the forces strike them down

Where the fires are burning
where the innocent once fell
Forced to the edge by a vastness of fury
trading heaven for a glimpse of hell

Posessed by an image where two souls unite
destined to seek and avenge
Rising from darkness to conquer the night
never to wander again
