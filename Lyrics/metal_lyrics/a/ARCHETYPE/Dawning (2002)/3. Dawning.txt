Far beyond skies of grey
there lies a place kept away
a sanctuary from afar

It's here his thoughts come to pass
as memories that never last
drifting onward to the stars

Untouched was this lasting peace
concealed for centuries
until the moment they arrived

In time his soul will lay to rest
lost among the final breath
left to search on in the night 
for new life

He must rise above

How can the silence go on anymore
as it crumbles to the ground
Masses corrupting this once sacred home
with the pleasures they found

No longer can he wear the disguise
or surrender to the fear
Reclaiming some meaning in life
that makes the harm disappear

Sail away into the winds of yesterday
Here escape is waiting with reality obscured
facing the uncertain at a point of no return

Now we must leave all the others behind
Let your spirit soar through space and beneath
Journey to salvation 
return to a place where minds are free

One mind will lead as another
is left standing all alone 
Many have yet to discover 
the power of what he has known 

Slowly rising soaring ahead
Seasons changing never again pretend to see

There at the dawning the when ages collide 
he retreats to solitude 
Drawn to uncover one lasting desire
to remain as one of the chosen few 

Sail away into the winds of yesterday
Here escape is waiting with reality obscured
facing the uncertain at a point of no return

Now we must leave all the others behind
Let your spirit soar through space and beneath
Journey to salvation 
return to a place where minds are free

One mind will lead as another
is left standing all alone 
Many have yet to discover 
the power of what he has known
