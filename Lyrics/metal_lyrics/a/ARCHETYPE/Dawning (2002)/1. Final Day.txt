Side by side the legions ride
unto the conflict and into the unforseen
For what lies ahead one can only dream

Go defend your place in time
Return and stake your claim

Onward with faith in their hands and night closing in
learning to gather the last moments to live
Reflections can't turn away
the anquish that cannot hide

Held by the perils of sin and forced from within
to venture beneath the sky

As they hear salvation call
deception commands them all
Unknown are ill-fated ways
that further desecrate
their minds the truth the honor

As they hear salvation call
deception commands them all
Led by a meciless lie
belief and demise are revealed

Gazing down to the ground below
an endless sea of endless foes
Once so far now plain to see
the sullen grip of reality

Rising forth from the light of day 
the lonely souls cry out in vain
Shattered hope now felt inside
look to the heavens for compromise

One by one with will undone
the faithless minions embrace the enemy
and summon the passion for victory

Go defend your place in time
Return and stake your claim

Torn by the venemous pride and their sacrafice
Condemned to fade away 

As they hear salvation call
deception commands them all
Unknown are ill-fated ways
that further desecrate
their minds the truth the honor

As they hear salvation call
deception commands them all
Led by a meciless lie
belief and demise are revealed
