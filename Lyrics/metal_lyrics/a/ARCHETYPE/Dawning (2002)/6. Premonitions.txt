Hide away 
the warnings are falling into place
the time has come

I hold on to the last hope
unaware what the mysteries have meant
Now I see the secrets revealed and understand
our premonitions descend

On that day 
the skies will darken with rage
beware the signs

I seek shelter in the night
and run from damnations arrival
No promise of a future in sight
with knowledge of mankinds denial

A challenge awaits us to stand the test of time
foretold are the warnings to never cross the line
Let go of your instincts and just as before
we'll rise from the ashes of this world reborn...

See the way that tomorrow is fading 
feel the weight of the shroud sent down from above
Ask not forgiveness as the future is changing
we'll all pay the price when our days are done

I just can't believe why so many were chosen
to suffer the fate meant for so few
Open your eyes and pray that tomorrow 
is your dying day the day we all lose

Passing on 
the final prophecy has come
the end remains

I'm searching for the answers
crying out for what man cannot see
Unable to realize our premonitions 
are destiny

A challenge awaits us to stand the test of time
foretold are the warnings to never cross the line
Let go of your instincts and just as before
we'll rise from the ashes of this world reborn...
