Out of temptation A new age is dawning
the helpless sinners will follow until the end
Captured by regret and humbled by triumph
their solemn hearts together shall repent

See the day behold the tragedy
Be not afraid and find what is meant to be
Anger remains and falters endlessly

Keep me from falling into dissension's wake

With this knowledge I pray for a sign
distant lights are fading into memories
Once a sinner who beckoned the night
now a savior with secrets kept inside of me

Holding the answers and begging for hope
sands of time have fallen and cannot return
Reaching out to embrace the new day
finding strength and the will to not betray

Lead me on show me where I belong

Relive let it begin
Commense the feelings within
Transform the words for a while
Believe reconcile

Into redemption the future is calling
to hide the truth and see beyond the past
Light begins shining and faith realigning
this world of freedom remains forever vast

See the day behold the tragedy
Be not afraid and find what is meant to be
Anger remains and falters endlessly

Keep me from falling into dissension's wake
