In the endless turning
within the back of my mind
is a world I cannot ponder
Can there be a future
will the images die
my inner peace must pull me onward

If these visions remain any longer
constant thoughts and dreams will control my mind

From the unknown darkness
awakes a tell tale sign
of misery and unknown splendor
Tearing forth at feelings
reaping all that is mine
solitude is not the answer

From the moment that time left me standing
I felt an anger that burried my soul
Will the silence return as a traitor
or will this anger burn out of control

Contemplate Eviscerate
the mind and the body are one
Futurize Fantasize
the power of thought has become
This vision is all that I see
what will become of me

Take a walk with me I will show you fantasy
Come inside my mind I will teach you misery
Voyage through my eyes now you know what I see
Imminent demise what can I believe

Is there understanding
images darken thdarken the known
Ungodly Commanding
descend to a world down below

Crying and fearing and losing time
frightened by what I can't see
Endless are terrors I cannot define
eternal sight I now concede

Come and see the future
underneath the lies
come alone and do not wander
Through the deepest sorrow
to the darkest night
to the place that keeps my honor

From the moment that time left me standing
I felt an anger that burried my soul
Will the silence return as a traitor
or will this anger burn out of

Contemplate Eviscerate
the mind and the body are one
Futurize Fantasize
the power of thought has become
This vision is all that I see
what will become of me
