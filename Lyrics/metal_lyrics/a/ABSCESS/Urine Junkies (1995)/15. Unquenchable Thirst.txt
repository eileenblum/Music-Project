Saw cuts through flesh like a hot knife through butter
Jugular vein severed gushing vein blood sputters
Waterfall of plasma pouring out red beauty terror filled
Eyes turn to glass dead and cloudy draining you dry
Pushing blood from every place pale dead flesh draped
Across your emptied face lust for blood that cannot be
Satisfied burns my brain the more the liquid is supplied the
Rush of life plunging down my throat I drink from the kill 'til
My veins begin to bloat lifeless skeletal shell is left
Behind unquenchable thirst frenzied bloodlust fills my mind
