I can feel the pus the infection is dripping the lacerated
Wound soon my throat I'll be slitting I'm digging in the gash
With a rusty screwdriver stinging sensation blood in my
Saliva I puke up my mind on the concrete street worms
Crawling in it and it fucking reeks I've lost my mind and it's
Foaming with pus eyes seeing vomit and more bile building up
I'm looking at you with a gangrene stare you think I'm going
Crazy but I'm already there my mucous membrane is burning
With disease my face rots slowly as I mentally bleed
