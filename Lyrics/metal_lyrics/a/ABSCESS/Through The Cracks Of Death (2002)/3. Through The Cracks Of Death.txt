[music: Reifert, lyrics: Reifert, bass: Bower]

I woke up in the black of night
And went for a dead sleep walk outside
Out to the place where thr withered trees sighed
Acrid winds blowing through my mind

I stopped short at a hole in the ground
And looked into its shadowy depths
I saw a corpse lying in its floor
It looked like me in the maggoty webs
I called to myself "come in crawl out"
I screamed from the grave "come in crawl out"

[solo - Coralles]

And in that fleeting moment
A rip cracked the universe
Dawn and dusk they fucked
And life and death became one
I reached out and my fingertips touched
And I lived and died an a glimpse of insanity
And I went back to bed
As my corpse turned over once more

[solo - Bower]
