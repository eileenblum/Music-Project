Darken down and fall
Your chance, your death
Feel the beyond call
Last blood, last breath
Road of skulls you walk
From time, from mind
To dead souls you talk
Just rot you'll find
The hearse's wheels
Roll a dozen more times
The coffin drones its song
Your blood, it leaks darkly away
Your minds derailed
It won't be long

Just desperation for the end
Is all you can conceive
The lid is shut on your casket now
As twilight starts to bleed

Memories turn into dust
As comas kiss sinks deep
Maggots find your shattered mind
Fall into final sleep
