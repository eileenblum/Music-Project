Saw a tattoo on a pretty young thing
A piece of art on her back
I don't think she understood
When I said I have the perfect frame for that
Tattoo hunter, tattoo collector
I've got a wall of Kiss tattoos
And a room full of just Ozzy
From Black Sabbath to Randy Rhoads
I've got a space saved for his smiling knees
Tattoo hunter, tattoo collector
I've got lots of human skin
Covered in beautiful art
I'd like to add you to the collection
But first I must take you apart
