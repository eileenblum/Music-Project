The unhealing wound
Existing only to consume
Eat flesh, swallow life
It's inside of you

Inherently unpure
Not of this world
Ancient conscious drives
Insistent holocaust

March onward into empty horizons
March onward into empty horizons
Heavy the air, Armageddon dawns
We march, we rot
On empty horizons
