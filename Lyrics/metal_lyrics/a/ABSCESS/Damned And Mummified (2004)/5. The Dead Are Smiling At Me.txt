We watched the bombs come down
Then we rolled into town
The dead is what we found
Greeted by the dead

The dead are smiling at me
Face rots, exposing the teeth
Eye sockets black, empty
I wonder if these holes can see
They all look strangely happy
The dead are smiling at me
The faces have burned away
The dead are smiling at me
Cut the chains
Break down the gates
Nothing left alive
Greeted by the dead
