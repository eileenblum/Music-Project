Swallow the venom
On the arctic plains of my frozen soul
It's hard to survive, to remain alive
So dead inside, deathtrippin' scenes
Sometimes it cuts each time I breath

Encased in ice my spirit filled with frigid bile
Freezing point, travelling toward the poison fog
Seeking heat from fatal liquids proved to kill
I'll burn at any cost
Swallow the venom
On a burn, watching lava devour the cold
Lost in a frost, blood on the snow
Suicidal jump through the psychedeathic door
Into the mighty flame

Swallow the venom
