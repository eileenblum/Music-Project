False prophets pray
Break the laws of our faith
Condemned by cowards
Pigs in black robes decide your fate
Burn the witch
Accused of being demon possessed
Lies from the masses
It is for those that hell awaits

Hide behind your crosses
Throw your holy water
Recite your senseless verses
Let the darkness hour turn
When witches burn

[Solos: Coralles / Bower]

Flames rage with hate
Growing higher and higher
Curse the bastards
Inhale the black magic smoke
Torch the soul
Opening hell's hole
Burn with desire
To light the devil's fire

Hide behind your crosses
Throw your holy water
Recite your senseless verses
Let the darkness hour turn
When witches burn
