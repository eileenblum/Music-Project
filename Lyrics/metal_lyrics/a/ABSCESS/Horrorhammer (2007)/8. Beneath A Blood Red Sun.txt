Grim serpents, rise entwined
Can't remember when the noose was satisfied
Pigs blood splashes, deep red sketches
Deathworms feed on pain
I'm damned in acid, skinned again
Senseless stitching, too much flesh to spend
Wheels of bone, death trip set
Bleeding toward the end
Burial meltdown, gods in flames
Throne of ash, all hail insane
Beneath the fucking blood red sun
Comets burn my veins
Wicked are the teeth of the beast
Blood drenched dawn, rituals obscene

Beneath the fucking blood red sun
Comets burn my veins
