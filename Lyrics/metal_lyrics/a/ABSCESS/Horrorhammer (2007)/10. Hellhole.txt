[Solo: Bower]

Slaughtered flesh, seething hate
Consume the filth, feed the pain
Wretched life now destroy
Open gates into the void
Hellhole fucked inside my head
My fucking wasted rotting head
Hellhole sucked into the pit
My own creation, steeped in shit
I hate everyone that ever lived
Kill your fucking self before your dead
Swallowed by hellish rot
Purification of my though

[Solo: Coralles]

Terror, panic, horror, pain
Tortured soul, brain insane
Dragged to hell, demons grip
Into the hellhole, Satan's crypt

[Solo: Coralles]
