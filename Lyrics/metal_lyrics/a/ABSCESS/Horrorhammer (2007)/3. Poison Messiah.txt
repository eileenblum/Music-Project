Damn the one who brings the flock before me
I'll poison each and every fragile mind
Turn your very tainted blood against you
Assume the role of bane of human kind
I am your lord
Absorb your souls
Cold upon my throne of flesh
Seek enlightenment discover death
Hypnotized, my eyes they slay
Searing holes of hell, your thoughts decay
Brain you with a single blow
Leg bone smash, plasmatic river flows
My fingers crush the heart beyond your bones

Everything you love will fall to dust
Burn your bridges as you crawl across them
Life will wither into the fetid rust
Poison messiah, messiah, messiah, messiah
Enraptured in blood thrall

Bastard of the netherworld
Lie in wait for simple bleating sheep
Crown of sinew, robe of skin
Vulturistic talons rupture deep
High above the cliffs of black
Spreading venomous eternal sleep
