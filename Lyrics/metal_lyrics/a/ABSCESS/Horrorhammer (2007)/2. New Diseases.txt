Don't drink the water
Don't touch the dead
Don't breath the air
Where diseases are bred

Extreme agonizing dehydration
Precedes violent hallucinations
Reddened blistered burst on faces
Doomsday illness life erases
Dry bones litter toxic ground
Cries of pain the only sound
One by one the strong will fall
The weak have died extinction calls

Don't pray for life

[Solo: Bower]

Don't wish for death

[Solo: Coralles]

Black maladies
Swarm in your breath
