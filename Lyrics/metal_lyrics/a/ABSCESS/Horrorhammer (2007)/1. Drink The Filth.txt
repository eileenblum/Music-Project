The power is in the blood

[Solo: Bower]

Baptize me in the blood of the enemy

Razorblade open up the vein
Drink the filth!
It's time to cut your fucking throat
Drink the filth!

[Solo: Coralles]

Baptize me in the blood of the enemy

Razorblade open up the vein
Drink the filth!
It's time to cut your fucking throat
Drink the filth!

[Solo: Bower]

The army of rats are with you
The plague will follow

Razorblade open up the vein
Drink the filth!
It's time to cut your fucking throat
Drink the filth!
