Gotta leave this place
Don't ever wanna come back
Don't wanna make your scene
Don't wanna hear your crap
Don't wanna see your face
Don't wanna hear you bitch
Just wanna leave this place
'Cause it's a fucked up trip

Rotting in the dark
Whiskey on my breath
Blood colder by the day
Can't meet what you expect
Don't wanna hear your voice
'Cause you've got nothing to say
These four grey walls
You'll never penetrate
Gonna spend the hours
Out of my fucking mind
Just wasting away
So sick of human kind

The outside is a shithole
No use for society
People clapwing for a piece
Of what can never be
