Don't want to go outside today
Inside i think I'm gonna stay
My tortured mind it chokes me down
In here I'm free to bleed and drown

Just one more private hell
Stuck in this mental shell
I haven't slept for seven days
I watch my face just melt away
I hear them coming after me
Perpetual demonology...

Brain in flames I'm sinking down
Stabbing voices all around
Sleep is something i can't do
Stay awake, nightmares come true

Just one more private hell
Stuck in this mental shell
I haven't slept for seven days
I watch my face just melt away
I hear them coming after me
Perpetual demonology...

Eyes are circles skeletonized
Read Maldoror twenty five times
Drank window cleaner and insect spray
This hell is mine for one last day

Just one more private hell
Stuck in this mental shell
I haven't slept for seven days
I watch my face just melt away
I hear them coming after me
Perpetual demonology...
