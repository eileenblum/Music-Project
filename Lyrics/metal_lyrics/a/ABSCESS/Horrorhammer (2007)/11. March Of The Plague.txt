Noxious cloud rising from the sea
Rising from the fields of the dead
Left by the storms, left by the wars
That precede the plague, march of the plague
A black giant roaming the land
Black abscess mark of the living dead
Death rides a black horse

March of the plague, death roaming free
Swallow the living
Blackened abscess, infest our bodies
Vomit black blood, black death, blood infection
A ship of dead in the harbor
A cargo hold ripe with disease
The plague has come to our shore

March of the plague, death roaming free
Swallow the living
Blackened abscess, infers our bodies
Vomit black blood, black death, blood infection
The plague has come to take me
I wait and watch my sores bleed
A fire burning my brain
I feel my body rotting
Noxious cloud rising from the sea
Rising from the fields of the dead
Left by the storms, left by the wars
That precede the plague, march of the plague
