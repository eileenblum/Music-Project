Business man before my eyes
Pinhead robot in a suit and tie
Obsessed with money, obsessed with greed
Take 'em out to hang and bleed

Shake the hand, stab the back
Rehearse the sickening phony laugh
Shake the hand, stab the back
Exterminate the business man
Mr. pig man, you're a joke to me
Your life's a kiss ass fallacy
Your mirror shows a corporate sow
Kill yourself, the time is now

Your money is your life
Your image burns my eyes
You're just a waste of flesh
You're all that I despise
You sold the soul you never owned
So smug upon your plastic throne
Tear you down, destroy your mind
Rid the world of your useless kind
