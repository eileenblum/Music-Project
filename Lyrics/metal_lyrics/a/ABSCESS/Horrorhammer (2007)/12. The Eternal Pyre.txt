Ashes to ashes, mankind is dethroned
Death machine grinding and spitting out bones

Bodies on bodies the flame rises higher
Endless fuel for the eternal pyre
Sky turning black from the smoke of the dead
Perpetual deathtoll, hung, drawn and bled
Carcass by carcass, they're filling up tombs
Rampant delusional bloodshed and doom

The eternal pyre
Flesh devoured by flame

Meat for the grinder, casualties rise
Blood soaked soil, dehumanized cries
