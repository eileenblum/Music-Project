I caught a great
Big batch today
Walked out of the water
And felt them suck
Tiny teeth
Affixed to my flesh
Glisterning denizens of muck

Leech -- I'm a leech boy

My folks they
Sent me out again
There'll be no food
Without you boy
That's fine cause
They're my little friends
My family my food
My toys

Leech -- I'm a leech boy
