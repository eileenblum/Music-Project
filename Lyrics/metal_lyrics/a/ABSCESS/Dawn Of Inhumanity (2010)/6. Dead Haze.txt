I screamed at the sun
While it tore at my flesh
An offering obscure
More absurd with each breath
Mind blown in a dead haze
Can't look back or I'll waste away
I talked to the night
With my brain set on fire
I drank from the moon
As it filled my desire
Reason torn in a black mind
I'll live to suffer while the end begins

[Lead â Coralles]

I followed the dawn
As it's tongue flickered red
It told me its tale
As it squirmed in my head
Cyclone void in a deep haze
Can't think 'cause it's much too late
I fell into dusk
With my bones in a vice
It sucked at my soul
As my veins turned to ice
Goin' home though it's nowhere sane
Can't help but melt away
Inside out of a dead haze
Inside out in a dead haze
