I must be dreaming, no you're not
The dead are walking, still the bodies rot
Now we are all losing a war that can't be fought
Operator dead, post abandoned
We're getting out, someone has to survive
Let's leave the city, soon nothing will get out alive
Don't know where we are going, just up in the sky
Operator dead, post abandoned
We watch the lights go out, we see the city die
We fly above the battle, we watch the nation die
Don't know where we are going, someone has to survive
When the dead are living you must stop the killing
What have we done to ourselves?

[Lead â Bower]

It's really all over isn't it
What have we done to ourselves?
When the ead are living you must stop the killing
Or lose the war
We checked the television, there is no signal today
We checked the radio, there is no help on the way
We made this hell and we are here to stay
Operator dead, post abandoned
We watch the lights go out, we see the city die
We fly above the battle, we watch the nation die
Don't know where we are going, someone has to survive
When the dead are living you must stop the killing
What have we done to ourselves?

[Lead â Coralles]

It's really all over isn't it
What have we done to ourselves?
When the dead are living you must stop the killing
