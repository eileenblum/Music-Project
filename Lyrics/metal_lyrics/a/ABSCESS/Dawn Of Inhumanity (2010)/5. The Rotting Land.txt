[A) Hammers of chaos]
[B) Doom unfolds]

Beyond the flames
All tomorrow's yesterdays
Erupt in the dim
A glistening red burst
Old wounds heal
While fresh stitches
Are torn wide

[C) Desolation/Torment]

A skull lind path winds
Forever onward
Distorted trees reach
And cover all
With suffocating silence
The lack of light
Intoxicating
The rotting land assuring
Nauseating
All days are one

[D) Human Vultures]
