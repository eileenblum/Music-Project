Look beyond the window, tomorrow's staring back
The book of lies is open, the sky is turning black
The great beyond is calling, the great divide is here
Humanity in ruin, the future grave and clear
Torn from tomorrow, torn from tomorrow
Today is raped and sold
Scenes of tomorrow, scenes of tomorrow
Are ready to behold
The wheel of life is cracked and dead
Torn from tomorrow, torn from tomorrow
The smell of burning skin
Scenes of tomorrow, scenes of tomorrow
The end will now begin
The wheel of life is cracked and dead
Torn from tomorrow, torn from tomorrow
As terror crawls through every head
Anxiet is burning, the eye of doom sees all
Apocalyptic vision, to oblivion we crawl

[Lead â Coralles]

Experiement in failure in the form of skin and bones
We're born to feed on violence and bred as rapid drones
Forlorn winds, tombstoned minds
The foul remains of human kind

[Lead â Bower]
