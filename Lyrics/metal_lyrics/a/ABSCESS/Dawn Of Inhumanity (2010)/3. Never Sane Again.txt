Curled up in the corner
Stinking like a gangrene dog
Straightjacket tentacles grip
Your mind has flown away
Reflections blows to broken pieces
A tortured shell remains
No fire inside, dead as ash
Never sane again

[Lead â Coralles]

Gas mask in acid
Distorted faces emerging from the walls
Vomiting rotted eyes
Deformed, waiting to implode
Crawling screaming fingers
Penetrate your skull
The weird released
The sickening moon is full
Raining blackened jewels
Razor wire and pills
Bridges of infected saliva
Strange sky and hills
Melt through the mirror
A cocoon of sick despair
Encased in bile and mucous
Forever now ensnared
Frozen blood oceans alive
Movement strange and nauseating
Injecting powdered glass
Limb to limb, the end begins
Black teeth gnash at your soul
Lost in a psychedeathic hole
Reflections blown to broken pieces
A tortured shell remains
No fire inside, dead as ash
Never sane again
