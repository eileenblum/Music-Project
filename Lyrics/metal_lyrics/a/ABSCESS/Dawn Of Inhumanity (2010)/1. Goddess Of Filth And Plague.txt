Crypt ascension, from below she rots
Impure procreation, hell in breeding form
Eyes of blackest depths beyond all hope and fear
Altar of abyssmal drug addiction

[Chorus]
Goddess of flith and plague
Seduced by death, disease awaits

Inhale the perfume of victimized souls
Each carcass a trophy to the coffin's teeth
Goddess of the darkest minds beyond repent
Apocalyptic chasms filled with pus and skulls

[Chorus]

Humanity laid waste
Every mind bleeds black
Her teeth appeased with flesh
Madness in her breath

[Lead â Coralles]

[Lead â Bower]

Fornication rituals for human whores
Spawning bloody spasms, flames burning high
World devoured, putrid lust unfolds
Menstrual atrocities, consumed by carnal rapture

[Chorus]
