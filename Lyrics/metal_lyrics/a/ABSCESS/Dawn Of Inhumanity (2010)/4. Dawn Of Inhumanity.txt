Life is a holy war
Death is the only cure
Torn from yout sanity
Killing the lies of the human breed

[Chorus]
Dawn of inhumanity
We are upon

Lead the sheep into darkness
Sacrifice the weak for your profits
Leave the sick to rot and suffer
Drink from what we have to offer

[Chorus]

Reaping from what you know
The torture waiting from below
Feeding on the deeds of death
Fighting 'til your last breath

[Lead â Bower]

Reaping from what you know
The torture waiting from below
Feeding on the deeds of death
Fighting 'til your last breath
The pain is yet to come
From the hell that has begun
Falling to our death

[Lead â Coralles]
