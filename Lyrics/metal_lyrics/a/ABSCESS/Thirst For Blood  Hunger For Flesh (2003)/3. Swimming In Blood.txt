Smoke filled skies, Bloodshot eyes
I'm as high as that glow in the sky
Burn, doe and fuckin' fry
Gonna fuck shit up and I don't care why
Hour's late, War's begun
Hit and run, We're having fun
Gas mask, Whiskey flask
Bloody boots on marching feet

Swimming in Blood

In the sky camera eye
Films the city as it dies
Higher higher feed the fire
Consumed by our desire
Broke city of lost hope
Is all that's under the smoke
Broken glass, Tear gas
Bloody boots of marching feet

Swimming in Blood

[lead = D.C.]
