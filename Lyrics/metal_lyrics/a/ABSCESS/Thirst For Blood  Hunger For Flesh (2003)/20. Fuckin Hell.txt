It's Fucking hell Everyday
I Don't know why but i Must Pay
Everybody's Feeling great
This Fucking hell I just can't take
Fucking Hell I can't be free - They're After Me
Fucking hell My Best Friend Died
My Girlfriend Lied
Fucking Hell
Everyday still the Same
Always trying to twist my Brain
Makes me Wanna Kill
and Kill and Kill and Kill and Kill and Kill - you
and Your little Dog Too
It's Fucking Hell

I Just wake up thats all I do
And all I Hear is "Hey, Fuck You!"
Feebleminded Worthless Fucks
Wonder why my whole life sucks
Fucking Hell working late
Live in Debt a rotting fate
Fucking Hell
