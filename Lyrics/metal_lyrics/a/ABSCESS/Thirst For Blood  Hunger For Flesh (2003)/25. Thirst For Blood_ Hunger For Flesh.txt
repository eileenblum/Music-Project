Your frantic screams arouse my lust
as they become more shrill
my demon seed is spilled

[Chorus:]
I thirst for your blood and I hunger for your flesh
I taste you as you're fading in and out of consciousness
gnawing at your tender flesh my fingers probe you deep
red razor stripes send you into crimson sleep

your sexy bleeding eyes canned now see
My lips slick with your blood
I'm lapping at your face
Just like a rabid lusting dog

[Chorus]

Savage slicking of the blade - Clint Bower
Perverse blood intoxication - Joe Allen

The doors of death open for you
but before you reach the other side
I shall detain you for a while
Flaying off your ruined hide

The hunger deepens - Danny Coralles

Your life it drains away
but you've become a masterpiece
Your final chokes turn into gargles
Drowning on my seed

[Chorus]
