Come with me where the dark dreams speak
Leave this dying world
Black holes feeding on souls
Blinding blackness of misery

[Chorus:]
Blood full of skin
A place of torture
Beneath the skin

Kneading the flesh
Open the wound
Bleed out the poison
The seed is entombed
Drain your shell
Of the hell within
A numbing death
Release the breed of insanity

[Chorus:]
Blood full of skin
A place of torture
Beneath the skin

[lead = D.C., C.B.]

The breeders of death
Calling me
These dreams of darkness
Will never set me free
Called back to host again
The unborn seeds
Beneath the skin
