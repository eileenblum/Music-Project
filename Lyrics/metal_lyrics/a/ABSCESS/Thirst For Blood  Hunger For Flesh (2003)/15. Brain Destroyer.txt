Lick your shit off of my bursting prick
Put on this helmet, it'll make you feel sick
Experiments tried and true, your sac turns blue
The enemy is within

[Chorus:]
Tubes connected to your eyes
Fed by bags of black supplies
Connectors screwed on to your ears
Instilling ripping nightmare fears

Here drink this, it'll make you go nuts
See through eyes of feces, dirt and guts
Personalities divide, destroy and conquer
Dried spit string grows longer

[Chorus:]
Tubes connected to your eyes
Fed by bags of black supplies
Connectors screwed on to your ears
Instilling ripping nightmare fears

Acid race through arteries
Fuse with dust from mind disease
Cruel instruments implied
Pack your fears for one way ride

[lead = C.B.]

Scream and yell, stuck inside a skin cell
Melted, rejected alienated hell
Brain probe deepens, stirring up the back
Soundless mouth mumbling in shock
