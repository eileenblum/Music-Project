Burned into your plastic mind
The face of my decree
Searching for a need to live
I can set you free

[Chorus:]
Gather at my house of sheep
Come inside go up in flames
Forget the world you stepped out from
Time has come to learn

Merging with the Universe
Minds Set for the Sky
Insanity builds soon to burst
For me you'll gladly die

[Chorus:]
Gather at my house of sheep
Come inside go up in flames
Forget the world you stepped out from
Time has come to learn

Slaughter of the Weak - Coralles
Immersion in Flames - Bower

Let's all die tonight
I'll pass the razors 'round
Cut and fry tonight
With death as your leader's crowned
