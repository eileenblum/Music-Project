The stars are lined up, the moons gone insane
Better pass by the day by smoking cremains
Too many thoughts spent upon socking fools
I Reach inside and tear out my guts
So I can throw them at you

Doomsday Inside My Head

The herding of the sheep like lemmings to the sea
Your laws are shit to me through all your lies I see
You make the sick, I just can't handle this
I could just crack inside instead I'll strick you blind

Doomsday Inside My Head

[lead = C.B.]

Doomsday Inside My Head

[lead = D.C.]

Freedom from skin... doors of death open realms
That stagger serrated biss domination.. fuck
God, fuck the devil and fuck, fuck fuck, fuck you
Subhuman spasms chew reason from bone... I rise
Maddened and your laughing wound makes me want to defecate
