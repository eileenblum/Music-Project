I am alone, I stand on hillI hear the wind, Loneliness and sadness Figures I see, Behind my eyesSpirits embrace, Oh my frozen black heart I feel so cursed, I'm blind but seeI can't resist, Darkness You come to me, To steal my heartPossessed my soul, Darkness Darkness, spirit, evil Nothing is true, Only the hateIt springs from in, Destroying all the feelings The only expect, A spoiled corpseRotting within, Destroying all the passions When night is come, You come to meI feel so cold, Burn me You see the hate, Into your soulThat only I want, Burn me Darkness, spirits, evil, Satan
