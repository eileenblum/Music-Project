Entering from the gate belowFrozen they stand in pure snowThese mountains of old I knowOn the tops I linger and stars seem low Piercing blasts from the north, under stormy skiesOn the altar of pagan gods, I spill the blood Kingdoms of snowBarbaric winter's dominionImmoral realms of frostFather My sorrowful criesFor you I sacrifice Piercing blasts from the north, under stormy skiesOn the altar of pagan gods, I spill the blood
