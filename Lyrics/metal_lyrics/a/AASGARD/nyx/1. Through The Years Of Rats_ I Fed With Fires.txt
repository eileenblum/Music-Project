Hark now insipided pussies, How treasonous tongues poisonNow at the return of the tide, Witness the signs of warfare I blasphemed with archaic truths, As their eyes stared dormantlyKept spreading the same words, Cursed be the misery of love My words are, the voice of chaos, Gloried is, the essence of hateDoomed shall be, the world of men, The years of rats, I fed with fires The revelation night is here, Tonight I sleep with eternityAlone I lived alienated, No need for rats beside me I am the great wanderer, The one carrying the vernal smellI am the great wanderer, Like the torch gleaming by night My words are, the voice of chaos, Gloried is, the essence of hateDoomed shall be, the world of men, The years of rats, I fed with fires I blasphemed with archaic truths, As their eyes stared dormantlyKept spreading the same words, Cursed be the misery of love I am the great wanderer, The one carrying the vernal smellI am the great wanderer, Like the torch gleaming by night Keeping the keys of knowledge, I am foreverI praise the apocalypse, Through the ages eternal
