Trapped in the nest of disgust
When the night approaches
Moonlight reveals my sickness

Shredding my unhealing wounds
Blades mixed with blood
Suddenly I shatter alone

Slowly I was fading
And nothing could I do

How I couldn't see
These shitfuckers surrounding me

For answers I was seeking
This life I couldn't bare

My teeth I gritted hard
Bless my hate for you fools

Obliterated from all passions, standing above myself
Unmanned was the spirit, standing now near myself

Envenomed I was feeling
My body was destroyed
My existence I was fucking
Following the solitudes path

The blood of mine was dripping
No knife I left unused

My way had no return
Driven by the will of clarity

Obliterated from all passions, standing above myself
Unmanned was the spirit, standing now near myself

My hands fractured the times
I was reborn to smite the fools

I awoke fearless and raven
From the steamy dungeons of hell
