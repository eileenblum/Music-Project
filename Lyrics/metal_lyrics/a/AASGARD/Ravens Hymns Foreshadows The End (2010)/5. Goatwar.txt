This is the kingdom of the dead
You can smell it in the air
There are only corpses without soul
The sky is cloudy and itâs dark
Demons are flying through my eyes
I see their master in his throne
He is the prophet of the sin
He is controller of the wind
He is a demon from the east
The apocalypse is called beast
Azrael is his name
He has the keys of all the gates
His pleasure is the blood of sands
He is the great fallen one
Now the legion marching on
The banners have the goat up one
The gate of heaven has collapse
All of the demons praying to him
The rise of goat has begin
The dust of war is clearly now
The blood of angels descends the land
Lucifer is his name
