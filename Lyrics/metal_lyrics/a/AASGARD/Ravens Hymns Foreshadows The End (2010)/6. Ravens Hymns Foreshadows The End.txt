Bleakness, dark
When a crow has calling death
Solitude, black hymn
Murky, sky
Ravens hymns foreshadows end
Forest, cold
And the sun has died
Loathsome, black hymn
Lit, torch
Flaming under frozen stars
Sun fall
Ravens hymns foreshadows end
Loathsome, black hymn
Frozen
Black sun
Winter
Ravens
The fall of the light
Hail darkness
Pure frozen wind
Bleakness rising
