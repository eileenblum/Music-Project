When the Christians
When the fucking Christians
Coming filth my land
We are fighting
In the dusk we hunting
We are rising under pagan moon our swords
I see blood
I see war
With the Pan we cut their throat
I see fear
I see flesh
When Apollon hold their heads
They are afraid
They are cold
When the Aris marching on
In the woods
In the fields
We protect our pagan land
Zeus destroy them with a storm
Hephaestus is make our sword
This is our great pagan land
We denied the Jewish lamp
We will fight for mother land
We denied the Jewish lamp
Standing up through ashes
We are walking
This is time for our attack
We will fight Jehovahâs prayers
King Zeus
Steel and fire dust and raining falling
Rising swords in Paganland
Under sky we wear our glory armor
King Zeus
