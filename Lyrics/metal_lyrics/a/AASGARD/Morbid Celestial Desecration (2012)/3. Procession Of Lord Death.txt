Death comes to you
To your bastard race
No one can't stop him

Hands rising to air
Procession of the lord death
Ravens flying
Saluting the king death

Black banners he has
Flesh on his clothes
A crown made it from bones

Screams begging for mercy. Procession of lord death
Blood fire ashes falling from the sky

From the depths of hell his rising
Morbid macabre procession of the lord death

Name him Satan
Name him Hades
Is the name of our father
