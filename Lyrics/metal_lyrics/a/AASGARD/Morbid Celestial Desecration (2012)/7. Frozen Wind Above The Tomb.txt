Buried frozen flesh
My soul flying to the stars

Father give me your hand
Embrace your child

Alone in life
Alone in death

Frozen wind above the tomb

Darkness fall to my eyes
My hope is lost
Where is my soul

Behold my fathers face
Taking my to home
I saw my mother's throne
I saw my kingdom

Back to stars
Back to home
Death is life
Life is death
