My home is in the woods
My brothers are the stars
The rivers are my blood
The art of paganism

Pagan fire lit to night

Smash the jevovah's priest
My father is the wind
Killing the muslim pigs
My mother is the earth

War against enemies
The battle is near

Burn the sky
Pagan Gods
Advent of the ancient race

The art of paganism
Blood wind fire
The art of paganism
Earth stars seas
