It grows in the ambers
it sways through my hands
Hatred amongst a psycothic dement
as a fading candle a eerie wind blows

Caught in reaction by faithful content
Darkness is gathering the scattered descent
Can i go back i wish to go back now

A tragedy leans on the face of this manÂ´s fallen light
The cross in relief and fate in lament cries the night
Death of the body releases the soul
as the passage unfolds the time
The mist wearing the cold
eyes wide shut to when you...

Scream to my father
to grant a last chance
A maniac depressed by the saviourÂ´s command
in view of false grace thereÂ´s no dawn as
Ungrateful master
Strikes me to death
Holographic mighty ilusion opress
I hide in my shadow wandering low as a traitor

..tragedy leans on the face of this manÂ´s fallen light
The cross in relief and fate in lament cries the night
Death of the body releases the soul
As the bridge is set for the path
and the wicked will finally behold
eyes wide shut when you...

under the veils of old sad mother
she sings but can hear no more

inside the empty space i find her
dying to see her son go

kill me now
no more sorrow
