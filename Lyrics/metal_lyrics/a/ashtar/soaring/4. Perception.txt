never-ending beginning
transcending perception
rich sovereign peace
summoning golden sun

I have to bid my last desire
and warm her(him) with my care
a wakening hour lays inside
where the lost child within rests

goodbye brothers sisters
sleep tight and let me be
beyond the fatherÂ´s presence
our way to eternity

for those who still remain
i leave my beloved memory
alas there is no more to be done
the flame of life has faded in my sun

goodnight brothers, sisters
this night my soul is free
the moon will soothe you dearly
as daylight wears my being
