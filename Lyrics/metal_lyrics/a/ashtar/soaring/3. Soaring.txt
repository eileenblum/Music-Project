flying upwards to the sky
a unique silence to be so kind
the clouds dancing in dawn i reach
it must be a dream
the most wonderful dream

stars grows nearer city of light
bright horizon i feel i see life

breath i canÂ´t anymore
this consealed sensation
fractured scenes
soaring, the sons of life

as the waves breaks in clouds
and open minds
a breach widly expands in me

as i soar to you
in the arms of eternity
