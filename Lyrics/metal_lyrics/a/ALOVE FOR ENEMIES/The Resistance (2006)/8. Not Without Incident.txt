Paralyzed by your lies.
Broken down by your crimes.
You sold us out for a price.
This is not a breeding ground for your greed.
We won't take this anymore.
We will fight back to the bitter end.
We'll take our scene back.
One kid at a time.
Paralyzed by your lies.
You ignore our cries.
You sold us out for a price.
This is not a breeding ground for your greed.
This has gone on long enough.
It ends now.
Take back what they've stolen.
We'll take our scene back one kid at a time.
Not without incident.
