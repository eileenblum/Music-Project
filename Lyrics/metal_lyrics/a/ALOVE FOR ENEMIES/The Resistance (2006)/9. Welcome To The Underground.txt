How beautiful is the sound of your empire crashing down.
How beautiful is the sight of us united, ready to fight.
This is all we have.
I will be there for you.
Faith is all we know.
I'll pick you up when you fall.
Fear is their way to keep us in line.
We won't be slaves.
How beautiful is the sound of your empire crashing down.
How beautiful is the sight of us united, ready to fight.
This is all we have.
I will be there for you.
Faith is all we know.
I'll pick you up when you fall.
This is all we have.
I will be there for you.
Faith is all we know.
I'll pick you up if you fall.
This is all we have.
