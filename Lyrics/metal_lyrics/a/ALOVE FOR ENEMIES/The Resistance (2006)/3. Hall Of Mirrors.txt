Like fighting my own reflection.
Like drowning in the blood of my wounds.
I scream, but no one seems to care.
So I will die once again.
Like fighting my own reflection.
Like choking on the air that I breathe.
I scream, no one hears me.
I'm lost in my addiction.
My bones have all gone numb and I'm enslaved to this.
The pills no longer help, so I give in to hell.
I scream, no one seems to care.
I die inside by my own hand.
I can't go on living like this.
Someone please take this away.
I'm screaming with all my voice.
Replace this pain with something new.
