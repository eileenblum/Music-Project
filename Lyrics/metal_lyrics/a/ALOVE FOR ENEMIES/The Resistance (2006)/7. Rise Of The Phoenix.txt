I'm praying for the flames to take me away from this wretched life and bring me home.
Up against this wall with my heart split in two.
Drinking life away.
What else could I do?
Jesus, set me free from my blasphemy.
Help me to rise up from these ashes again.
Here I go again with nothing left to lose.
Wasting life away.
What else can I do?
Someone set me free from my misery.
Help me to rise up from these ashes again.
The flames will bring me home.

Jesus, set me free from my blasphemy.
Help me to rise up from these ashes again.
Rising from the ashes.
Rising from the ashes.
