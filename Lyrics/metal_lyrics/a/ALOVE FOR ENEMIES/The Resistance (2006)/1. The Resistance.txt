I think we've had enough of all your spineless talk.
Of all your hateful words.
We've drawn the line.
This is our battle cry, this is a raging war.
This is the fight that we have been waiting for.
There's no more compromising, there's no more falling back.
We'll fix our bayonets and bring you down.
I will strike you down.
I think I've had enough of all your spineless talk.
Of all your vicious lies.
I'll bring you down.
This is our battle cry, this is a raging war.
This is the fight that we have been waiting for.
This is our battle cry, this is a raging war.
This is the fight that we have been waiting for.
We will strike you down.
