"Why do I care?" is what you said to me.
That question is haunting me.
It's time you find out why...
Do you enjoy watching me fall?
Hearing my bones break as I hit the ground?
Do you like it when my blood runs cold, turning your face to a memory?
Everything you've ever said, broken down inside of me.
You've said too much.
I laid my dreams beneath your feet, so please tread softly.
For you tread on my dreams.
Do you enjoy watching me fall?
Hearing my bones break as I hit the ground?
Do you like it when my blood runs cold, turning our love into treachery?
Here's my answer...
You're dead to me, I feel nothing.
