When the faces of desperation come crawling to your front door,
You push them aside because they're not like you.
I welcome the fallen, forgotten, and abused.
(You've stolen their voices, you shut them out).
When the faces of desperation collapse onto your front door.
While our Father embraces all, you turn your back.
I welcome the fallen, misguided, and abused.
So it all has come down to this, time to make a choice.
Will you sit by and watch them die? Or open your eyes?
When the faces of desperation start dying on your front door.
You sweep them aside because they're less than you.
I welcome the fallen, forgotten, and abused.
(You've stolen their voices, you shut them out).
You've stolen our voices.
But you can't take our dreams.
