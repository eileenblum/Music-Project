This is our time for redemption.
For integrity to rise again.
You've traded away your ministry for the fame and the industry.
This is our time for salvation for sincerity to rise again.
You've traded away your ministry for the fame and your industry.
You are the real betrayers, you are the real sellouts.
Walk around with your head held high, wearing your cheap disguise.
You are the real sellouts.
You are the real traitors.
You are the real sellouts.
You are the real traitors.
And you'll die alone.
