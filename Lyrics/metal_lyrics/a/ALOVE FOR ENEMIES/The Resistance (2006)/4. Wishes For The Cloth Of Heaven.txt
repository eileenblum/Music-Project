Evil roams the earth in search of how it can go on.
When will the fire crash down on us all?
Washing our fears away.
Anguish fills my eyes as I search for what is real.
When will the fire rain down on this earth, washing us all away?
So take my life to the other side of freedom.
When heaven awaits us.
When will the darkness descend on this world, crushing its hopes and dreams?
Please take my life to the other side of freedom.
When heaven is waiting.
I'd trade my blood for freedom.
