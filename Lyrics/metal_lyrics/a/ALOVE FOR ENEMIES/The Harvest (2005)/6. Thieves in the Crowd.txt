You walk around like we owe you everything,
But what you don't know is that we don't care.
You're not what you were, you're bitter now,
You're not what you once were, you're bitter.
Just 'cause you've been around, does not make you anyone,
Just 'cause you've been around doesn't make you anyone.
You reap what you sow, you'll be left behind,
Your bitterness will drive you to the ground.
You walk around here like we owe the world,
You think that you've above everyone.
You think you're so wise, beyond your years,
You'd like to think that you don't care.
Just 'cause you've been around does not make you anything,
Just 'cause you've been around, we don't owe you anything.
You reap what you sow and you'll be left behind to die,
Your bitterness consumes you as in this life you will find.
