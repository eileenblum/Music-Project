You've tried to break us down, you failed again, so many years you've tried and failed.
We put on all of our armor, never giving in to you, we stand strong together now, we will rise.
You've tried to beat us down, you've failed again, we are still here, standing together.
We put on all of our armor, never giving in to you, we will stand together now, we will rise.
We are still here, never going back to our old ways.
Standing tall, don't give up. Stand up tall, don't give up.
