The blood will flow, down from the sky, angels reaping all of us, faithful or not.
The moon will turn to fire, the sky to ash, sickles reaping all of us, faithful or not.
Then you will see, Christ coming back, saving all of us from this torture and death.
The moon will turn to fire, the sky to ash, sickles reaping all of us, faithful or not.
And we will wait here, swords drawn, ready to fight for you.
And we will wait here, swords drawn, ready to fight for you.
This is my truth, this is our victory.
The blood will flow, down from the sky, angels reaping all of us, faithful or not.
The moon will turn to fire, the sky to ash, sickles reaping all of us, faithful or not.
And we will wait here, swords drawn, ready to fight for you.
And we will wait here, swords drawn, ready to fight for you.
It's time to rise and fight for life.
It's time to rise and fight for Christ.
