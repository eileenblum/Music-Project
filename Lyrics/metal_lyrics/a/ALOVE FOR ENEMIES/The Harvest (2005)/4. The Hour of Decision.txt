What we once were can never be taken away from us.
Let's raise our fists in the air, let's make a difference, go back to when we had something to say, let's make them listen again, let's make them
Understand, that we still have something to say.
Let's start a revolution, let's start a fire, burn down these walls of hatred, burn down these walls of lies. Get back to what we used to be.
What we can be, can never be taken away from us.
Let's raise our fists in the air, let's make a difference, let's make them understand we are here.
Break down these walls of hatred, burn down these walls of lies, let's get back to when we still had something.
Let's start a revolution, let's start a fire, get back to when we still had something to say, march forward make them understand again.
We still have have something to say, we must make them understand, we still have
Something to say. It's up to everyone, it's up to you and I, we still have something to say.
