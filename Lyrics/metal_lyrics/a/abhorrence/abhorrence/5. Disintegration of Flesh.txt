Word of utter destruction
Spell of termination
Annihilating living flesh
The Organic Holocaust

Flesh To Dust !
Bodies To Ashes !
Flesh To Dust !

Evolution, of billion year
Destroyed, in a segment of second
Pain, so unbearable
But only, 'till the End (so short a time)

Death strikes so fast
Like the lightning from the sky
Memories of the past
Away they all will fly

Disintegration of flesh
Evaporation of organic matter
Celss of living creatures
Screaming for eternities

Flesh To Dust !
Bodies To Ashes !
Flesh To Dust !

The spell now finally finished
The dust blown away by the wind
Nothing remains of the life that has passed
Because the flesh is always weak
