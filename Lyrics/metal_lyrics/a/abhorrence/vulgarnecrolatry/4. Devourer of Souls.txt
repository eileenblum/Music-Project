Ancient Demons, ageless Evil
Preparing the Ritual of Awakening
Awakening of the Unspeakable

Master is here, the Infernal Duke
Arisen form the bowels of Earth
Eternal sleep been finally upset
World will taste the horror new sent!

Stabbing their hearts, Bleed
Eating remains, Feed
Crushing their faith, Terror
Twisting their minds, Horror
Devouring their Souls!

Vile superstition, Legends half-understood
Lurked somewhere below, but now unleashed

Twisting genius to madness
Kills without the mercy of Death!

Pray God! Pray for mercy
Evil! will triumph
Rebel! against the overlord
Merciless! Lord of Vengeance
Veneration! else shall thee suffer
