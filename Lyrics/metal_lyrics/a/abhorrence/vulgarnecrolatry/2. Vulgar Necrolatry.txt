Erosion of life i see
It makes the passion burn in me
Life it always withers away
Death will eternally stay

Corpses in their coffins
Forever rest in peace ?
There sleeping with the aspergillus
Is this justice to the dead ?

The atracious site, of a burial ceremony
christians weeping, for the departed
They don't understand, they should envy them !

The deceased they know, is there a Paradise ?
Or shall we feel, the Purgatory!
I open the graves, admire the Rot
I can feel the presence of something from beyond

Aureaola of nauseating reek
Wings of shriveled skin
Holy beauty of carcass
Divine sight for me to gaze upon !

Necrolatric, reverence for putrefaction
Necrolatric, reverence for the stench

I kneel, before a carrion
I pray, before the dead
I know, they shall rise
I fear, for the scourge
I revere, power of the dead
