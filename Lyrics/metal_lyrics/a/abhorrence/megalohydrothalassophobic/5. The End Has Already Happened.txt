The world has ended and we have been blind
We did not see the dream, that was always more than real

The world was never true, only a cycle, only time
There was never no one there, just mirrors in the dark
Now we hunt for ourselves in the ashes of our world
Ghosts of the extinct, howling at mirrors

We are nothing and we know it, and there is nothing as beautiful
All these tears are washed away, by memories of carbon ghosts

Only mirrors within mirrors, pale ghosts of infinity
The scream of a mind, as it sees its eternity

I can taste it, I can feel it, invisible, on my skin
And we are skin to skin, with every single thing
We begin only to end, we end only to begin
We merge and intertwine, we are base, we are divine

There is only a spectre of what we thought was real
We are haunted, we are homeless, we are fearless, we are free
Come and warm your hands by the burning fossil fire
Then we take the last ride to the poison light on the other side

There is no beyond
No beyond
