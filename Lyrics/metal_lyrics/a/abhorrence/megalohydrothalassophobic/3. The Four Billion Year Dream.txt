Dead, he dreams

This planet is haunted, by it's own dream
It is waking up, to its dying scream
The soul of the earth, waits under the sea
Dead from its birth, life is his dream

The ocean dreams of the ground
The earth dreams of the sea
The stars have all drowned
The Four Billion Year Dream

Our lives rounded with sleep
We are swirls in a stream
He is the source, he is the deep
The Four Billion Year Dream

Above us and below us, black seas of infinity
He dreams all of us, he calls for you and me
Fierce the pale star burns, deep beneath the waves
Slow the planet turns, light shines from the graves

Sleeper, awakes
