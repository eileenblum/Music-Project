The age of humanity
In catastrophe, the ecstasy
We rise above all division
In the glory of extinction

IÃ¤! IÃ¤!

We paint the earth black
To make an altar for you
There is no turning back
No world that was pure

IÃ¤! IÃ¤!

What was blue, has turned green
What was green, has turned black
What was black, always comes back
And it haunts us from within

The stars will be right
When the black stains all light

IÃ¤! IÃ¤!
