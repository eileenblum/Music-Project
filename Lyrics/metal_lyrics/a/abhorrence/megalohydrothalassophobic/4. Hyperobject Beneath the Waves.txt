I stare at the sea
The waves are all I see
A mask for what's beneath
Something waits in the deep
A shadow of a mountain
Something moves beneath the waves

My eyes cannot see
The enormity of the deep
I feel the vertigo
The abyss before me
The deep moves in the black
It cannot be, it shouldn't be
Too vast to understand
Something moves beneath the waves

I drown...

I am inside, the deep
I cannot see, it surrounds me
The thing, the horror
All around me, and inside me
It is in me, it cannot be
I cannot see, the waves
Everything, only waves
I am, only waves
And the thing, that awaits
Beneath, the waves

I cannot see, the sea
But the sea, sees me
The sea, it lives
The deep, it breathes
Too much, no more
I drown, no words

Space dislocating
Time overflowing
Dimension phasing
All-encompassing
