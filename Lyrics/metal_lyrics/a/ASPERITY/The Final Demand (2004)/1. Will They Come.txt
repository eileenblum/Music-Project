I'm laying here awake
Coz I'm afraid to fall asleep again

If I leave the light
And get into the dark
I'm sure they will be there
So tired but scared
Afraid of my dreams
Even if they seem unreal

If I close my eyes again
May I forever be insane
I don't know

Will they come into my dream world
Will they come if I fall asleep again

They have touched me once before
They've been near now
They want something more
No I hear them whispering
I think it's coming from my closet door
But I don't know now

Go to sleep now
They will sing you a lullaby
Go to sleep now don't be afraid
Coz it's so nice to die
