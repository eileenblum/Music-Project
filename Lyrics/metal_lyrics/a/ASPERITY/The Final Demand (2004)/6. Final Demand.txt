I can't remember what I did last night
It's like a shadow a black hole in time
This confusion seems to have no end
And all the questions and pain still
Remain

My bloody hands
My obsession might rule
I'll make my choice now
But I don't know how

This satisfaction it just makes me sick
The voices echoes in my head again
Nnow I realize what I have done
My sick desire has not left my mind

Now I understand
It's the final demand
Now I understand
It's the final demand
The final demand

I'll rock the cradle
That leads to a world
A world of fiction hope
God bless us now
A desecration in the name of god
No one can save you
You are hopelessly lost

My bloody hands
My obsession might rule
I'll make my choice now
But I don't know how
Blood on my hands
My obsession will rule
My choice has been made
Murder is my tool
