I'm going crazy inside here
These walls is full of bad things
And I really fear that if I stay
The ghost will chase me into darkness
And will never walk away

I'll guess it's time for me to go
So that my heart again will glow

On the run
From the shadows of my past life
On the run
To meet a brand new morning sun
On the run

I cut myself to end up dead
Tried to get rid of all the voices
In my head
But god he showed his face to me
And chased the devil home
So I could start to see

I will run away
