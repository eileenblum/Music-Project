White man stole his pride for joy
Took him as his slave
They raped his wife and killed his boy
Soon they'll dig his grave

Save him let him go
Let him believe in a future
Haunted everywhere
Coz white man will always be there
Where can he go alone
Coz he won't find the way
Back to his home

No he'll never let him go
Where can he go alone
Coz he won't find the way
Back to his home

What you going to go
With your freedom
What you gonna do coz your freedom
Won't be long

What you gonna do
With your freedom
Where you go
Coz there's nowhere you belong

One night he refused to see
His only way to go
He took the white mans gun and prayed
That he will find the road

You will never find
A way out of there
Release me
Will you ever see
That the end is near
Release me
