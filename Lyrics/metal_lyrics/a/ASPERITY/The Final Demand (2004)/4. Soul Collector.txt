You stole my soul
And made me to your slave
But I managed to break the chains
You made me blind
And still your shadows hanging
Like a grip around my neck

Walking in darkness
I can not see
Strange eyes watching
Over me
Gotta be strong gotta be strong
Gotta hold on

And let the holy cross guide me
And never let faith
Never let hope
Never let go
Coz someday I'm gonna be free

I was caught in your world
With all your pain and anger
And all the lies you spoke to me
But ven now when I'm on the run from you
With every step I take
I hear your breath
