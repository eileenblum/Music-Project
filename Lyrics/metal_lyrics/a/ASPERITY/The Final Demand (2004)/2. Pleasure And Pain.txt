I'm so confused by my love
Coz sometimes I want
And sometimes I don't

Go don't turn around
Stay forever bound
I don't want to leave her now
Go...
Stay...
I don't want to leave her coz her

Eyes is like paradise
She makes me whole
It is a battle between
My head and heart
And everything makes me fall apart

Caught between
The pleasure and pain
Love can really make you go insane
Go insane

And if I choose to stay
They I will know
The next day I wanna let her go
