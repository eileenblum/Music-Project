In the darkest hour
Something with mighty power comes
With the speed of light
The man with thousand faces
Has been at many places
And now he is staring at you

Don't you never no don't you never
Call him by his name
Fire he'll becoming with the fire
Liar down to hell you go

He'll burn you up with fever
He makes you shiver
Now he's wanting your soul
The holy cross won't save you
No there is nothing you can do
He won't let you go

He blinded your eyes with one of this
Many disguises
And then he'll eat you heart out
And when you fall you know so well
It's the road that leads to hell
