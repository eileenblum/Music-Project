Oh I will go to heaven
When I die at least
Or will I burn with fever
And end up with the beast
Will I be forgotten and forgiven
For mistakes I've done and making
Or never understand
That I'm born in devils hand

Who am I good or bad
Not to know it makes me sad
Who am I wrong or right
No answers in my sight

I'll never understand
I will never understand
Where I belong
I'll never understand

Oh I heaven I will meet
In heaven I will see
The people that I love
The people that I need
In hell I have to face myself
And talk to them I hate
And shake hand
When I die at least
I maybe end up with the beast

I'll never understand
I will never understand
Where I belong
I'll never understand
Where I'll be
When I'm gone
I'll never understand

Forgiveness father forgivenesss mother
Cause now I hear
The demons are coming
I don't want to follow them down
