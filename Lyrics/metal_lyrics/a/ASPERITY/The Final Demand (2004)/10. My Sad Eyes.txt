She comes crawling in the moonlight
When I call out her name
I want to kiss her lips of fire
And all that she wants is me to burn

And she makes me reach
So much higher
Still my needs
Yes she makes me reach
So much higher
Still my needs

She can read it in my sad eyes
My sick desire she can heal

I've got to get myself together
She makes me live on the edge
I can't go on like this forever
Living on the edge

My sad eyes is telling you
Everything to know
All of my darkness there glows
And she is the perfect weapon
To shoot my fears away

That's why I'm calling out her name
