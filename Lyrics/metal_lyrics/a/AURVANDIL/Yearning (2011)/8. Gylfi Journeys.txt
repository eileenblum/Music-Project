Once there was a king
A wise man skilled in magic
His name was Gylfi
Lord of the Swedes

Amazed by the Asir's wisdom
He set out on a secret trip to Asgard
On a quest for knowledge

Changed into an old man
Under the name of Gangleri
He walks in snow
Toward north

His voyage through mounts and valleys
Leads him to high peaks and deeps caves
He travels through forsaken realms
Guided by the morning star

His only companions
On this quest for answers
Are grim ravens, wind and darkness

Wanderer, at the end of your journey
In the horizon
Behold the golden hall...
