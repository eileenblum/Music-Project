Where once was life
I evoke dread
I summon scorn
Revel in pain

Where once was pride
Complaisance thrives
The scum of the earth
Now dictates paths

Reign in spite
Odium supreme
I summon scorn
On thy abhorred kind

To gather for the final strike
Unholy and bleak
I come forth with fury
To burn the temples to dust
