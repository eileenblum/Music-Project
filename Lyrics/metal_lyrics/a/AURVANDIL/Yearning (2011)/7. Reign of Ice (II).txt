Now is an age of great battles
Innumerable armies, invincible throngs
Encounter in carnage
And brothers fight brothers

The blood of the dead
Poisons the springs
These cold and swift springs
I used to watch
Endlessly
Turned into veins

Blizzard kills the wounded
Ravens survey the dead cold sky
Mighty frost embalms the dead
And wind bears the tears, the cries

Here I stand above valleys
In which silence now rules
Veins of the earth
Why am I here?

Thus ends the world
Dimly lit by a cold sun
Snow now falls on the remains

O beloved winter
