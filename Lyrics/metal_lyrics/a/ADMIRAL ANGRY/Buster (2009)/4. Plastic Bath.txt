FUCK I FORGOT TO WAKE UP
DON'T GIVE A SHIT
CLOSE YOUR MOUTH
GO GET FUCKED
I ONLY CARE JUST TO NOT
SO GUESS WHAT
I STOPPED
DON'T TRY TO WAKE UP LONG ENOUGH TO GIVE A FUCK

MUTTER ME SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW
MUTTER ME NOTHING
FOR FUCK SAKE

I BETTER WATCH OUT 'CAUSE I HAVE A GUN
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I EVEN KNOW IT
WHAT'S THE POINT WHEN NO ONE'S WATCHING
IN THIS SHIT DOESN'T LAST VERY LONG ANYWAY
I BETTER WATCH OUT 'CAUSE I HAVE A GUN
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF IT'S EVEN LOADED
WHAT'S THE POINT WHEN NO ONE'S WATCHING
IN THIS SHIT DOESN'T LAST VERY LONG ANYWAY

IT CAME TO ME
LIKE A DREAM THAT SEEMS REAL
FOOLING ME INTO HUMAN PIECES
EVERYTHING SHIT
COVERED IN SHIT
I LONG FOR THE WILL TO REPAY
THIS FEVERED LIFE
THESE FUTILE DREAMS
EVERYTHING CAME TO BE
LIKE THE DREAM UNFULFILLED
SEEING HUMAN NEEDS AS FECES

LET ME GRAB A MACHINE
AND MAKE IT REAL
MELT ITS PLASTIC DOWN
TO BURY SHIT DEEP
TO ROT IT
FORGOTTEN
