SERIOUSLY I'M LOSING IT
FAITHLESS IN WAYS I CAN'T FAKE
UNLESS MY TONGUE IS SPLIT
HELL IS A HEARTBEAT SOAKED IN COCAINE
NOBODY TAKES SHELTER UNDER A TREE STRIPPED OF ITS LIMBS
DOPESICK VOMIT SOAKED
I'M GOD
THIS NEEDLE IS FILLED WITH MY FAILURE, MY CONVICTION
FUCKING FILLING MY VOID
REGISTER YOU FUCKER AND MAYBE THIS TIME THEY'LL LET YOU IN
I HONESTLY THOUGHT BEING A PARASITE WOULD STICK

SO WHERE IS MY MOTIVATION
DOPESICK VOMIT SOAKED DERELICT
COCKED SLICK AND HOLY
REGISTER YOU FUCKING BITCH

DRAGGING MY VEINS
LICKING ROCKS OFF MY CARPET
SEEING MY GOD IN THE WHITES OF MY EYES
DRAGGING MY VEINS
CUTTING MY ARMS OFF
TASTING MY PULSE SO SWEET
HEARING NOTHING BUT BEAUTIFUL STATIC

BEAUTIFUL STATIC
THICK AND CORROSIVE AND ANNODIZED
LICKING ROCKS OFF MY CARPET
SEEING GOD IN THE WHITES OF MY EYES

RAPING MY BLOOD IS MECHANICAL
I CAN'T STOP
I CAN'T CONTROL IT
BASTARDIZED TO MY FUCKING CORE
HOMELESSNESS EXISTS ONLY IN YOUR SOUL
