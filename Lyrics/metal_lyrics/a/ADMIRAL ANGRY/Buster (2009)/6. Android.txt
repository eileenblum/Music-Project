WHAT'S THIS MACHINE THAT FEEDS ME
DIGESTING FEELING INSATIABLY
COOKING UP NOTHING IN EVERYONE
MY HANDS ARE TOO NUMB TO FEEL SHIT
I'M HIGH AS GOD
I MUST BE IF THEY FEED ME

FIT CAME TO BEGOTTEN
IT'S EVERYTHING FAILED TO FEEL
CONFRONTED BY WHAT YOU THOUGHT TO BE
WHAT AN ANIMAL, A BEAST, A STRAY

ESCAPING MYSELF
FUCKING UP AND GIVING BIRTH TO A SHELL

ANDROID

WHAT'S THIS MACHINE THAT FEEDS ME
DIGESTING FEELING INSATIABLY
COOKING UP NOTHING IN EVERYONE
MY HANDS ARE TOO NUMB TO FEEL SHIT
I'M HIGH AS GOD
I MUST BE IF THEY FEED ME

I WAS COMING FROM THE DARKEST SUM
OF THE FEARS OF MY FANTASIES
NEVER TO BECOME TRUE
MYSTERIES PASS US THROUGH
FORTUNE COOKED PATHS OF MOLD
TRASHING MY FAST PATIENCE
PULLING FOR GOLD
FUCKING CRASHING
