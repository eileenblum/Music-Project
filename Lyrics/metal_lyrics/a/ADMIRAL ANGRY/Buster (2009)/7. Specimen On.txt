WHEN DID THIS BECOME EVERYDAY
WHEN I'M EXPECTED TO SHOW EVERYBODY MY BRAINS
HOW COULD I WALK AROUND
WITH IT SPLATTERED ALL OVER ME
WHAT CAN I SAY BETWEEN THE SHIT THAT I COUGH UP
AND COULD I LOOK YOU IN THE EYES
WITH MY PUPILS CONSTRICTED TO PUT THROUGH YOU

IS THIS MESS MAKING YOU BEG
WE AIN'T ALL ASKING THE SAME FOR CHANGE
IS THIS MESS MAKING YOU BED
WE AIN'T ALL BEGGING

AN ORGASM
A SNEEZE
AM I THE GLIMPSE OF A FUCKING GOD
THE SMALL DEATH OF ESCAPING
ONLY TO BE BORN A HERO
