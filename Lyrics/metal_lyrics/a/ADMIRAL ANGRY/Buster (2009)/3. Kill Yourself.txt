I'D LOVE TO KILL MYSELF
IF I WERE NOT SO AFRAID OF DEATH
SABOTAGED ATTEMPT
AS I FAILED SUICIDE TODAY
DON'T CARE AS LONG AS ANYTHING GOES AWAY
DISSIPATING FROM MY MEMORY
TIRED OF FEELING SO DAMN AWAKE
FEELS GREAT
TO HAVE THIS LIFE TO FAKE

I'D LOVE TO KILL MYSELF
IF I WERE NOT SO AFRAID OF DEATH
SABOTAGED ATTEMPT
AS I FAILED SUICIDE TODAY
DON'T CARE AS LONG AS ANYTHING GOES AWAY
DESTROYING MOST OF MY MEMORIES
TIRED OF FEELING IN DEBT TO PAIN
FEELS GREY

I'D LOVE TO KILL MYSELF
IF I WERE NOT SO AFRAID OF DEATH
SABOTAGED ATTEMPT
AS I FAILED TO KILL MYSELF
