RESTRICTING
FEEL THIS FOR ME MOTHER FUCKER
BENEATH THIS CRACKED LIFELESS SOIL THERE IS FREEDOM SO SWEET
FILTHY, DILUTED AND BREATHTAKING
SHEDDING MY SUCKED UP INSIDES
I CREATED A MASTERPIECE
SO FUCKING DELIBERATELY CRAFTED
TO TASTE THIS BILE AND SHARPEN MY TEETH

CANNIBALISTIC I WILL ONLY DIGEST MYSELF
CANNIBALISTIC I ONLY DIGEST MY OWN FLESH

SLEEP ONLY IN FAMINE, FEVER, OR FAILURE TO BREATH
DISEASED I FIND MY FAITH IN RESTRICTING

CAN I BE A FATHER TO COLD FUCKING IMPULSES
BREEDING LIKE ROACHES INSIDE ME
CAN I BE A FATHER TO COLD FUCKING LIES
GENERIC AND DEEP

MY INSTINCTS ARE FLAWED
I'M STARVED AND TOO WEAK TO BELIEVE
EXOSKELETAL
EMPTY AND GROUNDED
IN AN INSECT MALFUNCTION
I TORE OFF MY GODDAMN WINGS

RESTRICTION IS ALL I OWN
I CAN'T STOP BEFORE I STARVE TO DEATH
THIS CRAVING IS PULLING ME DOWN

EXOSKELETAL
CRACKED AND DEAD
FUCKING STOP
