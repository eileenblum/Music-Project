BREAK MY BACK
SPINE SPLINTERED I SIT SMOKING CRACK
I'M ABOVE YOUR CONCERN
MY MIND IS INFINITE AND MY HEART BURNS
AN ABSCESS WHERE SAINTS EXCHANGE SMUT VERSE BY VERSE
SITTING ON MY CHEST
REEKING OF SEX
LOOK INTO THE DENIAL I PROJECT
WITH EVERY CONFIDENT GESTURE
EVERY MONUMENT TO YOUR INTEREST
IN THIS FILTHY APARTMENT COMPLEX
TURN AROUND
SHUT THE FUCKING DOOR
HERE IS YOUR SHIT

TIE IT OFF
CUT MY OWN THROAT
JUST TO HEAR MYSELF COUGH UP
YOUR IGNORANT, FILTHY NEED FOR A SHOT OF MY COURAGE
FETAL AND HELPLESS
GODDAMN MISCARRIAGE

CARRY ME TO THE CROSS
I AM YOUR GOD
CROSSDRESSED AND SILENT AND HOLDING YOUR DRUGS

FORGETTING MY FAMILY EXISTS
I LIVE UNRESTRICTED
A DEITY TO POISONOUS HABITS
IT'S MY FEET THE CHILDREN ALL KISS
FUCK IF THEY DIE, I'LL TAKE THE CREDIT
BURNING GLASS CRACKED OUT OF CONFIDENCE IN MY SWIFT RE-GRIP
ABOMINATIONS
CONTAGIOUS AND PATHETIC
FORGET IT
