Enduring the distance
Leaving behind trodden sand
Overwhelming burden weighs
Compass point has been lost again

Tell me how to find direction
A path to better future
Doing nothing but a heavy duty
I got to get rid of this sledge of stones

Blue thoughts devour the day
Miserable and lacking consistency
Actions speak louder than words
Roaming through a quagmire
And always aiming headwind

Tell me how to find direction
A path to better future
Doing nothing but a heavy duty
I got to get rid of this sledge of stones
