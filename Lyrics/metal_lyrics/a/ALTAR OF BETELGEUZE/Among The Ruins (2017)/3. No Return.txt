Down to the core
Of dazzling sights
A world under the spell
That hinders perspective

It matters not
One's got to seek the easy path
Sweet ignorance
It's bliss to live in denial

As the torch is lit
One has to choose what to believe in
All these tales of unknown truths
They shine forevermore

Act without thinking
Follow an illusion
Through a cloud of lies
Inhaling dishonesty
Impaired vision, at the
Point of no return
Face the facts
And settle the score

Don't you want to see the truth?
Closed eyes and misguided feelings
Adhering words that resonate
It's better not to show emotion

Discard questions and prepare for
Outcome which may not please
Maybe one day you'll find that
The system avoids honesty

It just doesn't matter
Always a bliss to live in denial
Plainly follow the illusion
Proceed and repeat
