For hardships there is defiance
And, when it all will end
Placed out of sequence
Matters that are twisted and bent

Through a whirl of doubts
Waiting for the curtain to fall
Patience for being still reflects
The absence of light

A whirl of doubts
Out of sequence
The absence of light
The path to extinction
