The high tide is approaching
The signs are clear
Do not stare into the sun
Let it all fade away

Another look around
The sands of time are running out
But where to hide?

Take this offering of peace
A chance for quiet rest

Awareness will end
Descending into deeper
Depths of oblivion
Now everything is lost

The signs are clear
Can't take it anymore
Eternal slumber
A place in the sun
Now forget
