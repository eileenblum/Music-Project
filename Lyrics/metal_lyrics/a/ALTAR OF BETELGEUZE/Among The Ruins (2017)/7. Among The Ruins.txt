Among the ruins
Beneath the barren ground
Charred, forgotten
Placed in oblivion

Do not look behind
Toward those ghastly sights
When wisdom was overruled
The way of confusion
A path to the sun

A single flare
Ignited vicious circle
Violent outburst
On an unprecedented scale

It's better not to look behind
Words have no meaning

Providing a reason is useless
Devastation can not be undone
