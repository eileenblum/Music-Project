Death and greed
Tighten up a web of lies
Always wanting to feed the fire
Acting along without exception
Casting the dice
You're in for the kill
And doing as you're told

When will they fail?
Reveal their true existence
Bent, twisted and frail
Advocating deception

Playing by the book
And ripping up the unaware
The struggle mounts
Words are written on silk paper
Into the madhouse
The greed has to overflow
Suppression is the key

When will they fail?
Reveal their true existence
Bent, twisted and frail
Advocating deception
