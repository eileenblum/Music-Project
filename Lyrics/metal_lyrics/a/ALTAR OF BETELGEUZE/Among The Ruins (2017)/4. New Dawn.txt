Welcome to the end of days
As the tables are turned
Better to possess an open mind
And look for a shelter

The bombs are pouring down
From the blackened sky above
Bloodhounds howling in the rain
A new dawn that purged heresy

You've reached the end of the line
Open up a new chapter, stop believing
Salvation won't reach you
Just forget the past

The bombs are pouring down
From the blackened sky above
Bloodhounds howling in the rain
A new dawn that purged heresy

Moving along
The path of devastation
After having reached the crossroads
Of a new dawn
