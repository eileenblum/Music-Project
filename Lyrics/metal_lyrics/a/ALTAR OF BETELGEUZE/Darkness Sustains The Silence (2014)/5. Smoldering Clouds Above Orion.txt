Deep in the star constellation of Orion
One massive blaze of the Alfa Orionis
Worth of ten thousand Suns combined together
Light years away, far in the unexplored outer space

Soon to explode into torrid bits
Reaching the stage of supernova
The scorching core pulsates within it
Consisting of hydrogen, unstable nuclear fusions

The devils eye, engulfed in devastating flames 
Devouring the vast spheres in near proximities
The starved vultures arrive from hell's fire
The smoldering clouds finally appeared above Orion
As we expected
