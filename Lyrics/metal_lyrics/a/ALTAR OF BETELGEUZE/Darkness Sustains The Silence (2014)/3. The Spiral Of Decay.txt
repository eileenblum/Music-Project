As I make my way through these deserted streets
It crosses my mind what has been lately gone wrong in this society

And I'm wondering what had been going on 
Why it ran out, all fell down
With a split second window
The passing rates soared sky-high
Swirling down to the spiral of decay
Being stuffed with all those lies they tried to feed to me

This is another form of anarchy and suffering
People living without any hope, struggling to survive

And I'm wondering what had been going on 
Why it ran out, all fell down
With a split second window
The passing rates soared sky-high
Swirling down to the spiral of decay
Being stuffed with all those lies they tried to feed to me

Going ahead, face to face with my own mortality
Seeking for a cure for this disease, although it's not possible
The stocks ran dry, no one in place to ease or help it
This is a drama of no return, that's without a question 

Praying for an answer from the higher level above us
Got nothing in return, the time I have is now running out
My mind starts fading away, body turns slowly off
Deep within this spiral of decay I finally descend
