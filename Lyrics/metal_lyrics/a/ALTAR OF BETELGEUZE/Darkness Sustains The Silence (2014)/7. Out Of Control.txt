I'm waking up yet again
While feeling the weight of the world sitting on my shoulders
Hearing it well, the clock will tick
A feeling that builds up and never lets alone

Lacerated thoughts
Lungs proceed on overdrive
The system overloads
My thoughts begin to wander around
Nobody must feel it like the state I'm in

In desperation I search for a repair
Like for a machine
There must be an answer
A cure that would set one free
The chains were imposed and cannot be seen

The limited ability
To control movement
Heart beats are slowing down
Agonized thoughts that swirl
Nobody must feel it like the state I'm in

Down to the wire
Things get postponed every time
A spell with an effect to be whole again
Or a conjuring to deepen the agony

The destination is again toward unknown
I'm spinning out of control
It might get better the day after day
No progress in sight
Although, at least I tried

I'm waking up yet again
Hearing it well, the clock will tick
My thoughts begin to wander around
Nobody must feel it like the state I'm in
