The hot coals are about to burn
As the priest calls his name
For the following actions he'll be punished
The world swirls as the bonfire is set

Eternal perdition awaits the sinned
Obedience, for the lack of belief
No need for a final blessing
The heretic must be purged, disposed in just flames

Among this sacrificial site
The blood begins to boil
Flesh wraps around and curls in the heat
A human torch blazes, the sins are redeemed

And the punishment is done

"Soul of Christ, sanctify me
Body of Christ, save me
Blood of Christ, inebriate me
Water from the side, wash me
From the malicious enemy defend me
In the hour of my death call me
And bid me come unto Thee
That I may praise Thee with Thy saints 
Forever and everâ

âA world without end."
