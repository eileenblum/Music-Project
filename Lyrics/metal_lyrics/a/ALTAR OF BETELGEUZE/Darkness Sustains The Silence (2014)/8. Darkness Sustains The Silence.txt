[PART I:]

This is the cruel way of reality
A twisted pathway one has to endure
The cycle of nature, unchangeable by a human being
Entranced in a swift change
The sunlight will never shine

Holding on to a distant belief
Now crushed, Armageddon bound
It flickers away
Grasping unto something that once was pure
But there is nothing, no more
While descending into an anarchy
Societies perish to dismal remains

[PART II:]

Distorted faces vanishing in a spectral haze
Sirens of doom break the silence
Uncertain figures wander through the mist
Collapsing structures
And heavy rains of packed snow emerge

Explosions fill the night sky
A feeble try to make it whole once more
The weapons of mortals won't offer much help
Only chemistry irrelevant to the final outcome
Dropping down to fatal degrees
The call of gods or is there anyone?
Hostilities break out between rival communities
Just expedites the final extinction

Oil reserves depleting
Energy not stabilized
Strong networks vanish
Technology is obsolete

Final sections of the life cycle
Evolution backfires
Without the needed potencies
Distributed through the outer space

Darkness sustains the silence
Unstable forces gravitate
Glaciers spread throughout the regions
Humidity begins to crystalize

Final sections of the life cycle
Evolution did backfire
Without the needed potencies
The sun gives no shelter
Ice tears the havens apart
The warmth is long gone, it's gone

[PART III:]

If only I'd been able to foresee
Oh, just hold on to these distant believes
Now nothing, we're Armageddon bound
While darkness sustains the silence

Condemned to be a part of this
Glaciers spread throughout the regions
While darkness sustains the silence
The sands of time finally soothe us to rest
