Back in the game
Pouring the right liquid though my veins
My blood is fixed
It runs smoother than ever before

Give me back the reins
Let me guide myself to that place
Where the sun won't shine forever
Looking at the starting spot
It ain't the way I live 

What do you say?
I'm a one-eyed man
I'm a one-eyed battering ram
I'm a full-fledged steamroller

I take the stance
I do what I feel is right
Thinking back to yesterday
It's not my proposal, no way

With this great feeling
Breathing the fresh air
Being my current self
No need for explanations
This is as honest as I can get

What do you say?
I'm a one-eyed man
I'm a one-eyed battering ram
I'm a full-fledged steamroller

Bring tonight
Burning bright, burning low
I don't care at all
What's up to you?

I don't take any feeble considerations
Just pour me a drink
No need for a reservation 

What do you say?
I'm a one-eyed man
I'm a one-eyed battering ram
I'm a full-fledged steamroller
What do you say?
What do you see in me?
I'm a one-eyed man
I'm a one-eyed battering ram

A full-fledged steamroller
And I'm coming your way
