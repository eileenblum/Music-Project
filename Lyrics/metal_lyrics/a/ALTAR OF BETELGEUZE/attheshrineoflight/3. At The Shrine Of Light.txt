Imagine the scenes
Awaken by the chantings
Closing on light
The way is here 
The wait is heeded

The clouds are gathering
Forming, aligning to the sun
Blazing, strong rays, no turning out
To face the eternal way, placing the wails

Burning alive
The oceans on the planet's face
They are vaporized
Deeper, dwelling to the unknown

The time had came to reach this final state of termination 
whether it was too late
Had I decided a different path earlier, perhaps
This journey of souls, supressed, a neverending stream for divinity
Now fulfilling and saturating in heat, to bath in eternal light

The beams reach us, the ground is levelled
Hot burning air, a gigantic pyre
The sun once worshipped at the altars 
The universal degree fulfills above and beneath the ground we stand on

Imagined the scenes
Awoken by the chantings
Closing on the source
The wait was heeded

The everlasting colours
Spectres of total beatitude
Symbiosis of belief and unawareness
Entering the life through death

The clouds are gathering
Forming, aligning to the sun
Blazing, strong rays, no turning out
To face the eternal way, placing the wails

Burning alive
The oceans on the planet's face
They are vaporized
Deeper, dwelling to the unknown
We are at the shrines of light
