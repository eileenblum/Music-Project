rough lines they draw 
weariness in those eyes 

they keep trembling 
making up new heroes 

and now at last 
fading ignorance 

but now 
just now 
they are alone 

forever wrong 
heavy souls 
watch them now fall 
and now ignore 

and now force your eyes up to the sky 
blind them with light 
false light 
forget all left behind 
bite your lips hard 
taste blood 
cold rain 
firing fury 
this is where we part 

numbers in a quote 
words left untold 
lines never drawn
