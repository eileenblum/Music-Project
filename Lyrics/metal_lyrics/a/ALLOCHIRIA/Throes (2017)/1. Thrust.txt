rage in scattered souls struck by lying hopes 

rage kept suppressed enough to burst but yet remains 

where's his rights? 
where's his life? 
where's the dreams he was making before all this? 

let it out 
and fight without 
security of fate made to wipe you out 

rage in neighbourhoods you wouldn't dare to live 

tried 
failed 
struggle has fed them 
but they don't win 

facing ground 
life ran dry 
all eyes on you 
until the 7th day 

and thousands cry 
and thousands break 
until the 7th day 

no human, no 

there 
is 
no 
atonement
