for the norms you can't let go of 
that held you captive 
for taboos you are afraid of 
but always wanted 
for reflections in the mirror 
you never changed and 
for that fucking step you didn't 
risk to take and 

for secrets you kept 
for the life you led 
for mistakes you made 
for people that prevailed 
opinions you always scream 
defeated modesty 
the weak you 'never' see 
mocking memory 

are you really proud? 

with all the choices you make 
and the chaos you so much adore 
and all of your always-winning thoughts 

I can't see feelings in your hands anymore 

for all the neutral actions that fall to same patterns 
for life depending on every made-up task 
for joy on tears shed to boost a caring image 

detestable 

lie now 
go on
