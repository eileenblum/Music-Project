all is too less 
stillness' power on demand 
bailing the perfect plan 
a sharp decline 
surrender 

forgive us 
forget us 
forget me 

fears back again 
well-known friend 
portrait-made life 
so sick of 

stay clear 
and witness 
the fall 

we are the people 
no more 

failed 

soothing tears 
no more 

whispering 
no 
sleeping 
dreaming 
no 
solitude 

vision 
no 
light 
no 
air 
no
