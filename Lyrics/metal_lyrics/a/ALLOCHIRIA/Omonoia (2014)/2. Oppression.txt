grabbing his hands 
dragging him close 
shouts 
screams 
out of control 
suicidal thoughts 
his head in chaos 
craves for revenge 
and judgment is blind 
blinded by hate 

"it is their fault" 
who's angry now? 
"it is their fault" 
who's insane now? 

and there's blood on his hands 
and there's blood on the floor 
whose fault is now?
