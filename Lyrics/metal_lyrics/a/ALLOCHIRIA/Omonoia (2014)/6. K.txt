coming close 
what do they want? 
do they know why? 
were my choices wrong? 
what do they judge me for? 
do they know why? 
can't I decide for my own life? 

restrained between four walls 
hated by most 
my life or my beliefs? 
can't stand this hell I feel 

angry like a beast 
feel the veins underneath my skin 
my freedom now is gone 
too late, the war is on 

confusion takes over 
why so guilty? 
trembling from the heat 

time stops 
fell into the void 
darkness around 
suffocation 
where is my mind? 
and when does this end? 

they want my mind 
I keep my beliefs 
I give them my life
