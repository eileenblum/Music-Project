rise and fall 

running between 
your alter egos 
all the same 
all so fake 

playing well your role 
as you 've been taught 
keep rehearsing your life 
keep waiting for the show 

then try to find 
answers for yourself 
reach the end they want 
and fall in despair 

keep struggling for more 
until the end 
greedy thoughts again 
it never ends 

then struggle for less 
suddenly at the end 
honest thoughts return 
sorrow once again
