searing pain we feel 
thoughts eating our guts 
this world stands for nothing 
this world is falling apart 

empty inside 
we crawl 
towards nowhere 
horizon's call 

and our respond 

toying with our lives 
like we 've never breathed before 

blazing eyes 
trapped minds 
dead-end roads 
biased wants
