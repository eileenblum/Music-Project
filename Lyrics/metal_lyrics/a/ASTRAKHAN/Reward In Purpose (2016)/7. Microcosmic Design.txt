In reverse zoom from point of sand to floating moon.
In lunar dust.

Lesson learned in life, boiling the inside
Well without a trace, stuck in your side
Remains:
Quivering, sinking in, let the light bathe you.
The need to force
A microcosmic design.
To be perceived as one.

Calling of the drone
Becoming cold.

Forager of own, and seeker.
Turning preacher.

Softly states, all these years
How my size fails me now.

To be perceived as one
While thousands of millions collide
Ignorant to this.
