We suffer, why suffer more?
Why bother?
Seething, blaming me.

Enclave:
Worship those in control.
Glass eyed cyclops:
Bringer of blight, purveyor unknown.

The sum unspeaking tongues, and voice that equal none
Amount to this god weâve crafted from mud.

Awake yet we wait,
Enlivened we wander,
Rejecting the pure, and corroding the song.

Imbibe your cup awaits â incite the psalm.

We house, feed and grow.
Our voices sink and fold.

Quiet.

Voices sink and fold.
Words so holy flow.

Dry your eyes.
