Motions will be made when others lay.
The path untamed lays souls.

Hold stoic gaze, and steady pace
The other foot drops.

Lace break.
The first to fall.

Pipedream. Onwards we go.
Lace frayed â not unreachable.

All I'm left with:
Words to curse this.

Last cans opened, vacant eyes wander to the blade.
White fur, our friend: loved; skinned.

Stone toed, endless road
The first to fall
Burdened least of all.

Tied your rabbits in holes.
One final whispered oath.
