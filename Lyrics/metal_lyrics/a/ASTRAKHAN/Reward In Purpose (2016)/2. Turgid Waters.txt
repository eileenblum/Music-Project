A serpent drifts through water, itâs true form skewed by silt
Spewed forth in bursts of murky current
Hard dark scales.

An ancient leveler of egos, a tempest undisturbed
Cast aside in the wake of shadows.

This writhing figure embodies, fangs sharpened on the bones
Of the less aware.

I, intrinsically, am here only for my most basic need
And so easily am finding myself.

Fade away, dog shit
Straight line â sick of it.
Try to rest, lay to waste
Unrestrained, break the gray.
How do you fight for this
Dusk ends â gone
Are the days free to spend
Find a time; find a away.
