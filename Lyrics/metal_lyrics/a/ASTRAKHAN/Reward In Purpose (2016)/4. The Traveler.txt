Dark daze
Lion on a crowd
Sight fixed
On his masterâs throat
Iâm no sorcerer
How can this be?
Unrepentant day
All your life so cold
Look around
Go your own
Sun Hazed
Shrouded in this cloak
Painted
by the shadowâs stroke
Iâm no sorcerer
take this from me
Iridescent beast

Light this sage
Consecrate
Let yourself be low
knocked down on your knees
alone

I'm no sorcerer
light your sage
concentrate
light your sage
consecrate
leave this place
