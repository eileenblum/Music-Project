Hell
Is firing
Back

A child's feet
Disrupting
Mosses

One step of a million

Erased from the home that holds
His name
Heir

Will quiver in silence
Fraught despair

Well I don't need no son
To sort it
Sort it

Enjoy the trees forever

I didn't see the sun
Today
Tomorrow holds an unknown
Fate for me
Within these walls I ache
To liberate a spark
And plan another way
A kid cleaned up

Pale and weak
But standing
Craving vengeance
Hunting you
