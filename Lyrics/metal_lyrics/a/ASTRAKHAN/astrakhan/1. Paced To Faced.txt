My miser ways are mounting
I'm counting days
While nullified and wretched
Channeled aggression
That's fueling the rage

Oh why I'm thrashing my body with age

Oh what a better way to split 2 fives in 6 ways
Paced to faced

I've flown from the far away mountains
Spit on the brave who are hidden in their caves
Lost limbs in the fiercest of winds
Shits gone astray
Hairs falling in clumps
My toes are eternally numb
Cold air has now all but prepared
My body for a marriage with soil

Rage on through clouds of the bitch storm
It's on its way
Scarring the face
Crush cans to get gone and get away
Salvation's rays
Soul eater's haze

I'm waving
The standard
With honor
Singing my own accolades
I'm violently drifting
And sordid
You are!

Oh what?!
I'm finding myself today

Oh what a better way to split 2 fives in 6 ways
Paced to faced yea

Grave drawn
Martyr by my own hand
Thin hands scratch through
The skin to my bones
My bones now entirely hollow
Bit by bit I decay
Hairs falling in clumps
My toes are eternally numb
Cold air has now all but prepared
My body for a marriage with soil
