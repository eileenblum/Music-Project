Even sideways
Let it grow
Inside me
Waiting
Yea

Eager awaiting
To sunder

Cell walls combustion
Embers moan
Aloud and cry out
Our time is now
Eager awaiting the burn


In my time
By myself
I am withdrawn
My exile
Sweat procures
To steam and scald

I inhale
Searing lungs
Embers moan

Birthing fire
From the flesh
Baking air
Cutting stone

Birthing fire
From the flesh
Braving death

Cauldrons on kindling my fingers are tingling now
My eyes fall to passing ground
While streaking through air
My heart cannot bare to endure
Reflections
Reflections of the man before
