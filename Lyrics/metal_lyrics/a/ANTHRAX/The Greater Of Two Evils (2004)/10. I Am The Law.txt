Fifteen Years In The Academy
He Was Like No Cadet They'd Ever Seen
A Man So Hard, His Veins Bleed Ice
And When He Speaks He Never Says It Twice
They Call Him Judge, His Last Name Is Dredd
So Break The Law And You May Wind Up Dead
Truth And Justice Are What He's Fighting For
Judge Dredd The Man, He Is The Law
Drokk It!

With His Gun And Bike He Rules The Streets
And Every Perp He Meets Will Taste Defeat
Not Even Death Can Overcome His Might
Cause Dredd And Anderson, They Won The Fight
When The Sov's Started The Apocalypse War
And Mega-City Was Bombed To The Floor
Dredd Resisted And The Judges Fought Back
And Crushed The Sov's With Their Counter-Attack
Drokk It!

Respect The Badge - He Earned It With His Blood
Fear The Gun - Your Sentence May Be Death
Because...

I Am The Law
And You Won't Fuck Around No More - I Am The Law
I Judge The Rich, I Hudge The Poor - I Am The Law
Commit A Crime I'll Lock The Door - I Am The Law
Because In Mega-City...
I Am The Law!

In The Cursed Earth Where Mutants Dwell
There Is No Law, It's Just A Living Hell
Anarchy And Chaos As The Blood Runs Red
But This Would Change If It Was Up To Dredd
The Book Of Law Is The Bible To Him
And Any Crime Committed Is A Sin
He Keeps The Peace With His Law-Giver
Judge, Jury And Executioner
Drokk It!

Respect The Badge - He Earned It With His Blood
Fear The Gun - Your Sentence May Be Death
Because...

I Am The Law
And You Won't Fuck Around No More - I Am The Law
I Judge The Rich, I Hudge The Poor - I Am The Law
Commit A Crime I'll Lock The Door - I Am The Law
Because In Mega-City...
I Am The Law!

Crime - The Ultimate Sin
Your Iso-Cube Is Waiting When He Brings You In
Law - It's What He Stands For
Crime's His Only Enemy And He's Going To War
