Racing Down The Road
In A Street Machine Of Steel
Gears Are Jammed In Full
I'm The Madman At The Wheel

Got My Foot Pinned To The Floor
You Can Feel The Engine Roar
I Got Thunder In My Hands
I'm Metal Thrashing Mad
Metal Thrashing Mad

Driving Like A Maniac
Can't Go Any Faster
Burning Up The Road
Headed For Disaster

Got My Foot Pinned To The Floor
You Can Feel The Engine Roar
I Got Thunder In My Hands
I'm Metal Thrashing Mad

Racing Down The Road

Got My Foot Pinned To The Floor
You Can Feel The Engine Roar
I Got Thunder In My Hands
I'm Metal Thrashing Mad

Metal Thrashing Mad!
