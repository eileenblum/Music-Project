Why Don't You Listen to me when I try to talk to you
Stop thinking of yourself, for just a second fool
Shut up, shut up, I don't wanna hear your mouth
Your mother made a monster, now get the hell out of my house

Can't Stand It For Another Day
I Ain't Gonna Live My Life This Way
Cold Sweat, My Fists Are Clenching
Stomp, Stomp, Stomp, The Idiot Convention

Which One Of These Words Don't You Understand?
I'm Caught In A Mosh
Talking To You, Is Like Clapping With One Hand

What Is It? - Caught In A Mosh
What Is It? - Caught In A Mosh
What Is It? - Caught In A Mosh
What Is It? - Caught In A Mosh

Don't tell me how to do my job
There's the door, your name's on The Knob
You're always in the way, like a beast on my back
Were You Dropped As A Baby, Cause Brains You Lack

Can't Stand It For Another Day
I Ain't Gonna Live My Life This Way
Cold Sweat, My Fists Are Clenching
Stomp, Stomp, Stomp, The Idiot Convention

Which One Of These Words Don't You Understand?
I'm Caught In A Mosh
Talking To You, Is Like Clapping With One Hand

What Is It? - Caught In A Mosh
What Is It? - Caught In A Mosh
What Is It? - Caught In A Mosh
What Is It? - Caught In A Mosh

Think - Before You Speak
Or Suffer, For Your Words
Learn, To Give Respect
That Others, Give To You

Hey Man
I'm Trying To Reason But You Don't Understand
Talking In Circles, We'll Never Get It Straight
Just You And Me In Our Theatre Of Hate

Can't Stand It For Another Day
I Ain't Gonna Live My Life This Way
Cold Sweat, My Fists Are Clenching
Stomp, Stomp, Stomp, The Idiot Convention

Which One Of These Words Don't You Understand?
I'm Caught In A Mosh
Talking To You, Is Like Clapping With One Hand

What Is It? - Caught In A Mosh
What Is It? - Caught In A Mosh
What Is It? - Caught In A Mosh
What Is It? - Caught In A Mosh
