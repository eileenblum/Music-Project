Steel Shattered In The Night
Soldiers Racing To The Fight
Bombs Waiting To Explode
Fear Is Cast Up On Your Soul

It's Just Around The Corner
For Those Who Dare To See
With Eyes Of Fire
The Burn Right Through Me

Blood Painted On The Streets
Metal Cutting Into Meat
You Can See It In My Eyes
Pain That Never Will Subside

And You Can Feel The Power
On Evil It Will Feed
The Force That Surrounds Me
It Brings Me To My Knees

We Better Run For Cover
There's No Time To Waste
'Cause If You Turn Your Back Now
It'll Blow You Away
