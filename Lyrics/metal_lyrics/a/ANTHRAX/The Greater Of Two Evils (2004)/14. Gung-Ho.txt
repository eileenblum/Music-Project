Striking Down The Enemy
Fighting Hand To Hand
Troops Are Thrusting Onwards
Time To Take Command
Ready To Devour
On The Attack
Bodies Lie Dismembered
Maimed, Killed And Hacked

Draw Fast, Cut First
Live Hard, Die Hard
Feel The Point Of The Blade

Lunging Like An Animal, Killing All In Sight
Going For The Throat, Living For The Fight
In A Bath Of Bloodshed, Mixing With The Sweat
Crawling Through The Barbwire, Put It To The Test

Fight, Fight, Fight
Fight, Fight, Fight Fighting The War
Fight, Fight, Fight
Fight, Fight
Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho
Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho

Raging On The Warpath, Storming Through The Town
Blowing It To Pieces, Killing All Around
Stand In Our Way, If You've Got The Balls
In A Hail Of Bullets, Your Nailed To The Wall

Fight, Fight, Fight
Fight, Fight, Fight Fighting The War
Fight, Fight, Fight
Fight, Fight
Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho
Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho

We Wait Out The Day, We Burn In The Sun
We Move In By Night And Kill Everyone
Show No Emotions, Have No Regrets
Made To Take Pain, No Fear Of Death

Fight, Fight, Fight
Fight, Fight, Fight Fighting The War
Fight, Fight, Fight
Fight, Fight, Fight
Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho
Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho, Gung-Ho

Draw Fast, Cut First
Live Hard, Die Hard
Feel The Point Of The Blade
