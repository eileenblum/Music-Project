Mankind,
The Public Enemy's Not The Man Who Speaks His Mind
The Public Enemy's The Man That Goes And Acts Blind
Searching For An Answer That He'll Never Find
An Action From Reaction And You Can't Make A Retraction
Once You've Put Your Head Out
And Then You're Blue In The Face
As You Try To State Your Case
You Can Think With Your Dick
But It Can't Shout

Yo, I Try To Understand What The Hell Is Going On
I Can't Imagine How Things Ever Got So Far Gone
You Separatists, Say You Want Your Own State
I'll Give Them A State, A State Of Unconsciousness
Retribution, No Solution, Constitution
Discrimination, Through The Nation, Raining Hatred

I Yell, When There's Schism You Must Rebel
I Yell, So You'll Hear
I Yell, I Refuse To Live In Your Hell
I Am What You Fear

I'm The Truth, I Don't Keep It In The Family
Live Your Life, Take Someone Else
Keep It In The Family
The Real World's Outside Your Door
You Can't Keep It In The Family
You've Got The Longest Way To Fall
Keep In The, Keep In The, Keep In The Family

Don't Even Try To Tell Me What You Think Is Right
When To You Blacks Are Niggers And Jews Are Kikes
And You Expect To Be Taken Seriously
But Your Actions, They're More Than Curiously
Juvenile, You Emulate What You Hate
And You Don't Even Know Why You Feel This Way
'Cause Daddy Hated This And Mommy Hated That
And Your Own Ability To Reason's Like A Tire Gone Flat

Yo, I Try To Understand What The Fuck Is Going On
I Can't Imagine How Things Ever Got So Far Gone
You Separatists, Say You Want Your Own State
I'll Give Them A State, A State Of Unconsciousness
Retribution, No Solution, Constitution
Discrimination, Through The Nation, Raining Hatred

I Yell, When There's Schism You Must Rebel
I Yell, So You'll Hear
I Yell, I Refuse To Live In Your Hell
I Am What You Fear

I'm The Truth, I Don't Keep It In The Family
Live Your Life, Take Someone Else
Keep It In The Family
The Real World's Outside Your Door
You Can't Keep It In The Family
You've Got The Longest Way To Fall
When You Keep In The, When You Keep In The,
When You Keep In The Family

Acting Out Of Pure Cold Hatred
'Cause Of What Another's Race Is
Color Of Another's Face Is
Different And Your Own Frustrations
Taking On A Violent Nature
Full Of Hate, So Full Of Hate
You'd Kill A Man Is That Your Fate
Your Street Becomes A Police State
Why The Fuck Do You Hate?!
Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate, Hate!!!

I'm Not Gonna Stand For It
Someone's Gonna Pay For It
I Yell, We Rebel

We're The Truth And We Won't Keep It In The Family
Live Your Life, Take Someone Else
Keep It In The Family
The Real World's Outside Your Door
You Can't Keep It In The Family
You've Got The Longest Way To Fall
Keep It In The Family
I'm The Thing That You Most Fear
I Don't Keep It In The Family
I Am The Truth You Won't Hear
Keep It In The Family
The Real World's Outside Your Door
You Can't Keep It In The Family
You've Got The Longest Way To Fall
Keep It In The Family
Keep It In The Family
Keep It In The Family
Keep It In The Family
