White Coats To Bind Me, Out Of Control
I Live Alone Inside My Mind
World Of Confusion, Air Filled With Noise
Who Says That My Life's Such A Crime?

Trapped, In This Nightmare
I Wish I'd Wake
As My Whole Life Begins To Shake
Four Walls Surround Me
An Empty Gaze
I Can't Find My Way Out Of This Maze

Cause I Don't Care
Fall In, Fall Out
Gone Without A Doubt, Help Me
I Can't Take The Blame
They Don't Feel The Shame

It's A Madhouse
Or So They Claim
It's A Madhouse
Oh, Am I Insane?

My Fears Behind Me, What Can I Do
My Dreams Haunt My Sleep At Night
Oh No, Won't Learn Their Lesson, White Fills My Eyes
And Only Then They See The Light

Trapped, In This Nightmare
I Wish I'd Wake
As My Whole Life Begins To Shake
Four Walls Surround Me
An Empty Gaze
I Can't Find My Way Out Of This Maze

Cause I Don't Care
Fall In, Fall Out
Gone Without A Doubt, Help Me
I Can't Take The Blame
They Don't Feel The Shame

It's A Madhouse
Or So They Claim
It's A Madhouse
Oh, Am I Insane?

Trapped, In This Nightmare
I Wish I'd Wake
As My Whole Life Begins To Shake
Four Walls Surround Me
An Empty Gaze
I Can't Find My Way Out Of This Maze

Cause I Don't Care
Fall In, Fall Out
Gone Without A Doubt, Help Me
I Can't Take The Blame
They Don't Feel The Shame

It's A Madhouse
Or So They Claim
It's A Madhouse
Oh, Am I Insane?
Mad Madhouse, Mad Mad Madhouse
