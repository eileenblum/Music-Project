Look in my holy eyes
An empty smile
And youâre hypnotized
Selling lies my enterprise
The sheep just get in line
Capitulate so easily
The power of fear
That Iâm trafficking
Years of sleep have made you blind
I made the bed your in

As I lead the child to war again
Heaven lives in every gun
I damn you

Iâm alive to be the demon
Iâm alive to be the one
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hell it lives in everyone

When your world has slipped away
And all you have is me to pay
Once so proud you beg for more
And spread you legs like some dirty whore

As I lead the child to war again
Heaven lives in every gun
I damn you

Iâm alive to be the demon
Iâm alive to be the one
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hell it lives in everyone

Iâm alive to be the demon
Iâm alive to be the one
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hell it livesâ¦

Iâm invited
Iâm invited in
One nation
One nation under me

As I lead the child to war again
As I lead the child to war again
As I lead the child to war
Heaven lives in every gun

Iâm alive to be the demon
Iâm alive to be the one
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hell it lives in everyone

Iâm alive to be the demon
Iâm alive to be the one
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hell it lives in everyone

Iâm alive to be the demon
Iâm alive to be the one
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hell it lives in everyone
