The kids have gone wild in the streets
Iâm backing the havoc they wreak
Itâs time for the fall, so say we all
Starter of anything, ender of everything
Coming to kick you to sleep
The damage inflicted is gonna be deep
Cheering for your own demise
Starting tonight, people will die

Time bomb, ticking away, ticking away
Scare the hell out of you
This earth is on hell, earth is on hell

Welcome to your earth on hell
The worse that it gets, the better it sells
Itâs time for the fall, so say we all
Starter of anything, ender of everything
You made this sick hell on earth
Spitting your poison infected at birth
Taking the streets occupied
Starting tonight, people will die

Oh, Iâm getting out of line
Itâs like I lost my mind
Earth is now on hell
Oh, Iâm getting out of line
I fucking lost my mind
Earth is now on hell!!!

The kids have gone wild in the streets
No longer the stepchild you beat
Theyâre taking it hard, kill the old guard
Starter of anything, ender of everything
Coming to kick you to sleep
Itâs reap what you sow, not sow what you reap
Cheering for your own demise
Starting tonight, people will die
