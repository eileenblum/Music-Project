[Bonus Track][originally by Refused]CAN I SCREAM?!!!
YEAH
We lack the motion to move to the new beat
WHO!
We lack the motion to move to the new beat

It's here for us to admire if we can afford the beauty of it
If we can afford the luxury of turning our heads
(If we can if we can if we can)
Adjust the thousand dollar smile and behold the creation of man
Great words won't cover ugly actions
Good frames won't save bad paintings

WOO
We lack the motion to move to the new beat
YEAH!
We lack motion

When the day is over (Hey) the doors are locked on us
'Cause money buys the access
And we can't pay the cost
How can we expect anyone to listen
If we're using the same old voice?
We need new noise
New art for the real people

We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs
We're not leading

We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs
We're not, we're not, we're not
We're not, we're not, we're not..
Leading

We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs

We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs

Here we go!

We dance to all the wrong songs
We enjoy all the wrong moves
We dance to all the wrong songs
We're not leading

YEAH!
YEAH!
YEAH!

The new beat!!
