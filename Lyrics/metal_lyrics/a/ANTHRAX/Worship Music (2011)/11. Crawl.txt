Sometimes I forget to see
Now that Iâve found you
What is and what will never be
Now that Iâve found you
When my time has gone away
The words I say
Their lies will help you through
And I feel like itâs gonna rain
A real rain
To wash this from you too

So addicted to the pain
And itâs the pain that drove you crazy
Your mind is closing in
On a fight that you canât win
Itâs making me insane

If you crawl
Iâll follow, Iâll follow
Donât walk away
If you fall
Iâll follow, Iâll follow
Donât walk away

I think of all things that just got lost
Now that you find me
As if I had just had shuffled off
Now that you find me
When my time had gone away
The actions played
They broke your world in two
And I feel like itâs gonna rain
A real rain
To wash this from you too

Crawling
What Is and what will never be
And itâs the pain that makes you crazy
