Iâve been a man of brutal means
Dealing out my business, itâs so obscene
Iâm not crossed, just recognized
As the son of a bitch that pulled it right between your eyes
An unexploded ordinance
Variate the deviance
A Glasgow Kiss or a Molotov
Iâm about to blow it all

Countless, broken by the horror
A heroes end is still the end
My kind wonât be seen again

Let the right one in
Ya gotta go with the devil you know
Itâs a goddamn sin
Ya gotta go with the devil you know
Iâm ready, ready to begin
You bastard
Let the right one in
Ya gotta go with the devil that you know

What goes around comes around
And what comes around is gonna get beat down
I donât let anything go to waste after the cold reveal of my murder face
Another right that I  made wrong
Another I donât belong
Of all the thing I said that stick
Nothing good can ever come of this

Countless, broken by the horror
A heroes end is still the end
My kind wonât be seen again
And if ya donât know, now you know

Itâs just the devil in me
Thereâs no hypocrisy
What you see is what you see
What you get is what you get
