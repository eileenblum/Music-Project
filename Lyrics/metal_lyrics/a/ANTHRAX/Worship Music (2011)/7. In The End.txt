Lone star was dark tonight
Our diamond shined so bright
I watched it go
Farther than he ever dreamed
I canât take it

No matter how I try
I canât stop asking why
âCause somethingâs broken
Scarred it breaks my heart
I wonât take it, I canât break it

In the end
Iâm pounding on the door
But Itâs already over
Too little, too late

In the end
Youâll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down on me

And when the greatest falls
Heaven and Hell will call
Stand up and fight
On and on his memory screams
I canât take it

Stand up and fight withal
I wonât take it, I canât break it

In the end
Iâm pounding on the door
But Itâs already over
Too little, too late

In the end
Youâll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

In the end
Iâm kicking down the door
And Iâm taking this over
Iâm cleaning the slate

In the end
Youâll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down on me

Did I thank you for our time together?
Did I thank you for making me better?
Did I thank you for being the one I would
Bleed and kill for?
Did I thank you for tearing my head off?
Ripping my heart out
Fucking my world

Did we tell you how much we loved you?
Did we tell you you made our dreams come true?
Did we tell you you were the one?
Paving our way, the damage is done
Did we thank you for tearing our heads off?
Ripping our hearts out
Fucking our world!

Whoooa! Whoooa! I can't break it down

In the end
Iâm pounding on the door
But itâs already over
Too little, too late

In the end
Youâll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

In the end
Iâm kicking down the door
And Iâm taking this over
Iâm cleaning the slate

In the end
Youâll be my light in the dark
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down on me
