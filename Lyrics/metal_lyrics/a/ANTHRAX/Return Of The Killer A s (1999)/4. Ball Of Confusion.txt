[originally by the Temptations][Norman Whitfield / Barrett Strong]

People moving out, people moving in
Why, because of the color of their skin
Run, run, run but you sure can't hide

An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,
Vote for me and I'll set you free
Rap on, brother, rap on

Well, the only person talking about love thy brother is the preacher
And it seems nobody's interested in learning but the teacher

Segregation, determination, demonstration, integration,
Aggravation, humiliation, obligation to our nation

Ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey

The sale of pills are at an all time high
Young folks walking round with their heads in the sky
Cities ablaze in the summer time, and oh, and the beat goes on

Evolution, revolution, gun control, sound of soul
Shooting rockets to the moon
Kids growing up too soon

Politicians say more taxes will solve everything
And the band played on

So, round and around and around we go
Where the world's headed, nobody knows

Oh, great googalooga, can't you hear me talking to you

Just a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, ooh, yeah yeah

Fear in the air, tension everywhere
Unemployment rising fast, the Beatles' new record's a gas
And the only safe place to live, is on an Indian reservation
And the band played on

Eve of destruction,
tax deduction
City inspectors,
bill collectors
Mod clothes in demand,
Population out of hand,
Suicide, too many bills
Hippies moving to the hills
People all over the world
Shouting end the war
And the band played on

Oh, great googalooga, can't you hear me talking to you

Just a ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey hey

ball of confusion
That's what the world is today, hey hey
[repeating until the end]
