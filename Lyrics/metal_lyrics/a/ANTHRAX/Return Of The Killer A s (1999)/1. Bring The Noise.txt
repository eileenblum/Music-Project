Basss!
How low can you go?
Death row, what a brother knows
Once again back is the incredible
The rhyme animal
The incredible D, Public Enemy, number one
"Five-O" said, "Freeze!" and I got numb
Can I tell 'em that I really never had a gun
But it's the wax that the terminator x spun
Now they got me in a cell 'cause my records, they sell
Cause a brother like me said, "Well...
...Farrakahn's a prophet and I think you ought to listen to
What he can say to you, what you ought to do"
Follow for now, power of the people, say,
"Make a miracle, D, pump the lyrical"
Black is back, all in, we're gonna win
Check it out, yeah y'all c'mon, here we go again

[Chorus]
Turn it up! Bring the noise

Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact that's corrupt as a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
Cause the beats in the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm saying inside music
That the critics are blasting me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters now across
The country has us up for the war
We got to demonstrate, come on now, they're gonna have to wait,
'till we get it right
Radio stations I question their blackness
They call themselves black, but we'll see if they'll play this

[Chorus]

Get from in front of me, the crowd runs to me
My deejay is warm, he's x, I call him Norm ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock 'n' roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band man
Makin' a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call'em demos, but we ride limos too
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, beat is for Yoko Ono
Run-DMC first said a deejay could be a band
Stand on it's own feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B and L L as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still I can rock bells ever forever,
Universal it will sell
Time for me to exit, terminator x-it

[Chorus]

From coast to coast, so you stop being like a comatose
Stand my man? The beat's the same with a boost-toast
Rock with some pizzazz, it will last, why you ask?
Roll with the rock stats, you'll never get accepted as
We got to plead the fifth, we can investigate
Don't need to wait, get the record straight
Hey, posse's in effect, got flavor, terminator
X to sign checks, play to get paid
We got to check it out down on the avenue
A magazine or tow is dissing me and dissing you
Yeah, I'm telling you...
