Wake Up, Got Another Day To Get,
Through Now, Got Another Man To See
Gotta Call Him On The Telephone Ay O
Gotta Find A Piece Of Paper
Sit Down, Got Another Letter To Write,
Think Hard, Gotta Get A Letter Just Right
Little Ringin' On The Telephone Oh No,
Gotta Write Another Letter
No Such Thing As Tomorrow
All We Want
Two, Three, Go!
Time, Got The Time Tick Tick Tickin' In My Head
Time, Got The Time Tick Tick Tickin' In My Head
Time, Got The Time Tick Tick Tickin' In My Head
Tickin' In My Head, Tickin' In My Head, Tickin' In My Head
If I, Tell Ya What I'm Doing Today
Will You, Shut Up And Get Out Of My Way
Someone Ask Me What The Time Is, I Don't Know
Only Know I Gotta Go Now
No Time, Tryin' Ta Get A Watch Repaired
No Time, Never Got A Thing To Wear
Little Ringin' On The Telephone
Oh No, Hear A Ringin' In My Head Now
No Such Thing As Tomorrow
All We Want
Two, Three, Go!
Time, Got The Time Tick Tick Tickin' In My Head
Time, Got The Time Tick Tick Tickin' In My Head
Time, Got The Time Tick Tick Tickin' In My Head
Tickin' In My Head, Tickin' In My Head, Tickin' In My Head
No Such Thing As Tomorrow
All We Want
Two, Three, Go!
Time, Got The Time Tick Tick Tickin' In My Head
Time, Got The Time Tick Tick Tickin' In My Head
Time, Got The Time Tick Tick Tickin' In My Head
Tickin' In My Head, Tickin' In My Head
Tickin' In My Head!
