Your lies that took me where I've been
Your lies don't make me who I am
Your lies that left me scarred
And so fucking hard
Your lies that burn me deep inside (inside..)
Your lies that helped to bleed me dry (bleed me dry..)
Left on your own
Because your cover's blown

(I am..)
Taking the music back
(I am..)
Taking the music back
(I am..)
Taking the music back
(I am..)
Taking back, yeah!

Against your will I'm not a slave
Against the deal and you get paid
I won't throw you a rope
You prove that shit can't float
Against it, you're the enemy (enemy..)
Against it, your philosophy (philosophy..)
Shit thrown against the wall
You'll eat it all

(I am..)
Taking the music back
(I am..)
Taking the music back
(I am..)
Taking the music back
(I am..)
Taking back..

Yeah!!

(I am..)
Taking the music back
(I am..)
Taking the music back
(I am..)
Taking the music back
(I am..)
Taking back..

(I am..)
Taking the music back
(I am..)
Taking the music back
(I am..)
Taking the music back
(I am..)
I'm taking..
