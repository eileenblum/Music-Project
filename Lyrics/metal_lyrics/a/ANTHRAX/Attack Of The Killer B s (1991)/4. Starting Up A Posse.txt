[Anthrax]

Now I'm gonna tell you a story
A tale of wrong and right
And freedom is the reason
You can't take it without a fight

[Verse 1]

So now I'm startin' up a posse

( Suck my dick, suck my dick )

To come and look for you
We're gonna put a stop
To what you want to do
You fuckin' whores ( you fuckin' whores )
Thatï¿½s all you are

You say our records are offensive
Our message ain't right
You say where gonna label records
So our kids can grow up right
You fuckin' whores ( let then deside )
That's all you are

[Chorus]

Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
These seven words you're trying to take
Shit, fuck, satan, death, sex, drugs, rape
Right or wrong it's our choice to make
America the beautiful, Land of the Free
Don't change the words to Land Of Hypocrisy

[Lead ( Scott )]

Youï¿½re a whore arenï¿½t ya?

[Verse 3]

Now I'm startin' up a posse ( fascist scum, fascist scum )
And we'll damn sure make you see
Something that offends you
May not be offensive to me
You fuckin' whores ( you fuckin' whores )
That's all you are

Now you might take offence
To a word like "Fuck" or "Shit" ( Dick! )
But you fuckin' don't have the right ( Cunt! )
To descriminate me for saying it
You fuckin' whores ( you fuckin' whores )
That's all you are

Go suck a dick, uh.

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]


So now I'm startin' up a posse ( mother fucker, mother fuck )
To right for freedom of choice
To fight for freedom of speech
We're gonna make you hear our voice

[Verse 6]

And now I don't do this to show you
( That's the end, that's the end )
I don't do this for spite
You've got the choice: don't buy it, don't read it
And don't say your opinion's right
You fuckin' whores ( you fuckin' whores )
That's all you are ( cunty, cunty, cunty, cunt )

[Verse 7]

You know you can't censor my feelings
You can't censor my thoughts
Censorship's against,
Everything America stands for
You fuckinores ( let us decide )
That' all you are ( and this ain't sexist after )

And this ain't sexist either.

[Chorus]
