Wake up on fire every day
And I never say goodbye
Pre-determined destiny
I've never been afraid to die

Ever since I was a kid
I've seen things my own way, with my own eyes
With my hands I turn the screws
In my life I decide

You're bent on under the will of endless dogmatic restraints
I will rage against the machine spewing out blind faith

Think about an end you can live with
Think about an end I can give you
Think about an end that would satisfy

Think about an end you can live with
Think about an end I can give you
Think about an end

The only thing that's touched my soul
Ever in my life is love
Tangible and physical visible
Unlike your god above

You're bent on under the will of endless dogmatic restraints
I will rage against the machine spewing out blind faith

Think about an end you can live with
Think about an end I can give you
Think about an end that would satisfy

Think about an end you can live with
Think about an end I can give you
Think about an end

[Solo]

Where is all the mercy on which your faith has been built
All I see is hatred caused by years of inbred guilt, yeah.

Resurrecting genuflecting killing in the name
You disavow the right to choose. It's medievally insane

Your god is dead or doesn't care. Tell me which one's worse:
An uncaring god or knowing that your alone on this earth?

Wake up on fire every day and I never say goodbye
Pre-determined destiny I've never been afraid to die

You're bent on under the will of endless dogmatic restraints
I will scream, will rage.

Think about an end you can live with
Think about an end I can give you
Think about an end that would satisfy

Think about an end you can live with
Think about an end I can give you
Think about an end
Think about an end
Think about an end
Think about an end
