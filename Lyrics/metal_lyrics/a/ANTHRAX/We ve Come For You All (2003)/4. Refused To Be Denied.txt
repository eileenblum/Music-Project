Proud and free that's American to me
Symptomatically, and so basically
It's so definite, freedom is all of it
No humanity without restraint

Refuse to be denied refuse to compromise
Your ideology always a lie
It's jingoistic or nationalistic
Or whatever the hell you want to call it

With my raised fist
Never to be denied
I stand and resist again

Proud and free that's a human thing to me
Burning at the core and I'd go to war
Ain't gonna change my way of life
Twisted rhetoric, I won't subscribe

Refuse to be denied refuse to compromise
Your ideology always a lie
Imperialistic colonialistic
Bandwagon patriot wake up to this

With my raised fist
Never to be denied
I stand and resist again
