You give them Hell
Straight to the chin
If you canât win 
Their hearts and minds
On the first try
Up and say aye!
AYE!
Theyâll listen

Fires are raging and the sirens scream
And your pathetic life has run out of road
If you were offered eternity
Would it slip through your fingers to wicked to hold?
Rebel
Backslider
Reach higher
You give them Hell
You give them

Hell this ainât no warning
You giveâem hell because you must 
Itâs a long hard road weâre walking
Because this battle chose us
This battle chose us, this battle chose us

A gang of blood
And by killing so distilling
A simple plan
Never settle our true mettle
Yeah!
Theyâll listen
Fires are raging and the sirens scream
And your pathetic life has run out of road
If you were offered eternity
Would it slip through your fingers to wicked to hold?
Rebel
Backslider
Reach higher
You give them Hell
You give them
Hell this ainât no warning
You giveâem hell because you must 
Itâs a long hard road weâre walking
Because this battle chose us
This battle chose us, this battle chose us

Hell, you give them Hell

You canât choose your battles, you canât choose your battles, this battle chose us

You giveâem Hell
This battle chose us, you canât choose your battles 

Battle!
