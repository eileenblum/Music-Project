You can die screaming
Or you can give me what I want
Iâm gonna get it, get it either way
And I canât let it be
Viciously
Relentless pursuit of vengeance
And I wonât let it be 
Viciously

Impaled
You all shall hail
Youâre just a bag of blood and Iâm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Impaled
And I never fail
Youâre just a bag of blood and Iâm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe

Youâre slowly dying 
Thereâs no more lying
Iâm not your friend I never was I work alone
And I wonât let it go âcause youâre so
Brutal i
In your refusal 
I just wonât let it be
Viciously

Impaled
You all shall hail
Youâre just a bag of blood and Iâm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Impaled
And I never fail
Youâre just a bag of blood and Iâm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Impaled
The holy grail
Your goddamned soul is my white whale 
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Impaled
And you all shall hail
Youâre just a bag of blood and Iâm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe in me
In the small numbers when order sleeps and the streets are mine
It's a time and a place where I can thrive
And burn you with my demon eye
In my life the things I've seen
Inhumanly brutal the worst extreme 
I torture me because I can
Obscene the soul of every man
In my life the things I've seen
Inhumanly brutal the worst extreme 
I torture you because I can
Ive seen the soul of every man is fucking damned to a fate, and dead if you donât, and damned if you do, and dead if you wonât
Impaled

Impaled
You all shall hail
Youâre just a bag of blood and Iâm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
Impaled
And I never fail
Youâre just a bag of blood and Iâm holding the nail
You gotta believe, you gotta believe
In me
