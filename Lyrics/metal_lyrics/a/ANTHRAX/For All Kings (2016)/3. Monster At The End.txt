Do you think that youâre worth anything?
Do you think that you had everything?
Or was it just another dream
With a monster at the end
Promised youâd get what you want
But instead youâre getting what you need
This ainât just another dream
With a monster at the end

Down and under where the damned are riding
Down and under where you pay
Your golden halo is burned and melted 
Crown the monster at the end 

The wall of sleep is crumbling
And your conscience is left fumbling
A massive sleeping serpent
Uncoiled and awake
In this place, this sun-bleached Hell
Your sins were yours no angel fell
A monster hiding in plain sight
Itâs the monster at the end

Down and under where the damned are riding
Down and under where you pay
Your golden halo is burned and melted 
Crown the monster at the end

Itâs coming, itâs coming, itâs coming, itâs coming
The monster is unleashed

Now that crown is on your head
Youâre that monster at the end

Itâs coming, itâs coming, itâs coming, itâs coming
Down and under where the damned are riding
Down and under where you pay
Your golden halo is burned and melted 
Crown the monster at the end
Itâs coming, itâs coming
Down and under where the damned are riding
Down and under where you pay
Your golden halo is burned and melted 
Crown the monster at the end
Itâs coming, itâs coming, Itâs coming, itâs coming
