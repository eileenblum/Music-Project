Itâs everything, whatâs wrong with it?
Itâs everything, whatâs wrong with us?

Null, rictus grin, beyond death
And itâs after
Me, so insane, suzerain
And heâs calling

Nothing is over, nothing is over, nothing is over, nothing is over
Come see, with me as everything turns
Nothing is over, nothing is over, nothing is solved it only starts over
Youâll see with me as everything burns
What comes after
What comes after me

A history, of love and pain
In this story itâs all the same

Void, rictus grin, stand in sin
Rule the rulers
Blood, on the plains, suzerain
And heâs screaming

Nothing is over, nothing is over, nothing is over, nothing is over
Come see with me as everything turns
Nothing is over, nothing is over, nothing is solved it only starts over
Youâll see with me as everything burns
Nothing is over, nothing is over, nothing is over, nothing is over
Iâll be set free, free from this memory
What comes after
What comes after me

Nothing is over, nothing is over
Youâll see with me as everything burns
Nothing is over, nothing is over, nothing is over, nothing is over
Iâll be set free, free from this memory
What comes after, what comes after me
