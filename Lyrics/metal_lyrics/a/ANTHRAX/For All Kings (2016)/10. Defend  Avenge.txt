Waking on a bed of nails
Dying wind through shredded sails
Can you hear me when I shout
And nobody knows what Iâm talking about

What can I do?
Iâm trying to figure it out
Right here right now
Teaching me how 

Kill all the ends itâs your cold black revenge
Mark my words
Defend avenge
Break till it bends itâs a means to an end
Defend avenge
Youâre all gonna get what you fuckinâ deserve

Defend avenge

Your indifference abounds
Everywhere fence-sitting clowns 
Harvesting the seeds of doubt
And nobody knows what Iâm talking about

What can I do?
Iâm trying to figure it out
Right here right now
Teaching me how

Kill all the ends itâs your cold black revenge
Mark my words
Defend avenge
Break till it bends itâs a means to an end
Defend avenge
Youâre all gonna get what you fuckinâ deserve

Defend avenge
