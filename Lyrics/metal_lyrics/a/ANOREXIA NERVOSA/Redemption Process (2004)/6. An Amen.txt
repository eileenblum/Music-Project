This is the creation of your world
Pain of endless days with you
Torture of never-ending nights, without God
All my idols are dead
No one risks living anymore

Come, come crashing in
Into my fake glory
Sick as your gods in the desert of skies
No, no one knows
No, no one cares
Hellish boredom
Nobody dares
Dead

All my heroes are dead
Never wanted this to happen
Never wanted to live in there
Just between the ant-hill and the opium-den

There's nothing for us out there
Innocence is lost
Speed up the fall and say Amen
There is death for the dogs

Destin rongÃ© pa le remord
Un sacerdoce grave dans mon corps

Can't stop looking back
All my dreams are drowned
Days always pitch-black
Your Christ is crowned
Void's little helper addicted to wounds
Ran helter-skelter and hit the ground

And I wanted you hot
I wanted you so cold
But because you're half-hearted
I'll spit you out my tired mouth

Our existence is doomed
There's nothing for us out there
Speed up the fall
Say Amen

Our existence is doomed
There's nothing for us out there
Speed up the fall
Say Amen

Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla

Ecrance ritualle, prison de l''me
Les heures percent mon caur, autant de lames

Just a drop of social disillusion
And the army retreats in confusion
Forgive me for I don't wanna face the facts
I'm selfish and fearful and counterattacked

And I wanted you hot
I wanted you so cold
But because you're half-hearted
I'll spit you out my tired mouth

This is the creation of your world
Pain of endless days with you
Torture of never-ending nights, without God
Dead

All my heroes are dead
Never wanted this to happen
Never wanted to live in there
Just between the ant-hill and the opium-den

There's nothing for us out there
Innocence is lost
Speed up the fall and say Amen
There is death for the dogs

There's nothing for us out there
Innocence is lost
Speed up the fall and say Amen
There is death for the dogs

There's nothing for us out there
Innocence is lost
Speed up the fall and say Amen
There is death for the dogs

There's nothing for us out there
Innocence is lost
Speed up the fall and say Amen
There is death for the dogs
