In the very last days of judgment
I shall spread my spirit
Upon every flesh
Your sons and your daughters
They shall be prophets
And on this day it shall be done

Yes, upon my servants
I shall spread my spirit
And on this day, they shall inherit

For the first time you have to make a choice
Would you look down
Or look to the stars
To the ocean and far beyond
To the earth that is to erupt
To the red sky, to the storm
To the people who must die now?

A new cross rises on the hills of Jerusalem
Held by the arms of a stronger Christ

Now this is the very beginning of the end
Now lies have to be broken

Yes, cursed be betrayers
For they shall be left behind
And on this day, grace shall be redefined

For the first time you have to make a choice
Would you look down
Or look to the stars
To the ocean and far beyond
To the earth that is to erupt
To the red sky, to the storm
To the people who must die now?

Every one of us must know
That we are the very last ones
Martyrs and legends
Of a future New Testament

Cum aliguando vesperi
Atris nubilibus
Caelum cingitur
Cum auditor supra
Fulmen tonare
Statimpque exstingui
Sile, genua pone!
Vae tibi
Cum venatores
Aestu vesperis
Exsistunt!
Vae audaci
Qui nos in sublime
Adspicere vulti

Now look at me if you dare
It's so bright that it is blinding
A new cross rises on the hills of Jerusalem

Now that all of your nations
Are burned to the ground
Now that the words have no meanings
Experience the last sacrament
Be warm or be forgotten

Yes, upon the faithfuls
I shall spread my spirit
And on this day they shall inherit

A new cross rises on the hills of Jerusalem
Held by the arms of a stronger Christ

A new cross rises on the hills of Jerusalem
Held by the arms of a stronger Christ

A new cross rises on the hills of Jerusalem
Held by the arms of a stronger Christ
