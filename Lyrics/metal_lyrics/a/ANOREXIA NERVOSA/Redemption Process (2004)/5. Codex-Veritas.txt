[Incarnation I:]

Learn to admit the Machine's emanations
Act of initiatory chivalry
Learn to see the dramas in the sky
Act of terrestrial abnegation

You are not one of them
Not the same breed
You always felt out of place
Join your true scene

You want blood, not peace
You want shouts, you want tears
Not wisdom
Some Divine in their afflictions

[Incarnation II:]

Learn to stand apart from all profane dogmas
Act of final mind revolution
Learn to not care about their punishments
Act of war and liberation

You are not one of them
Not the same breed
You always felt out of place
Join your true scene

You want fire, you burn
Want the Great, not the minor
The absolute
Black and blue
The forever storm

[Harangue:]

Gloria victis!
Fatum nostrum universiis majus
Gloria victis!
Gloria victis!

[Lifecode:]

Cleanliness and order in your modus operandi
Achievement of the Great Work
Obedience, silently

Vois la splendeur vermeille et la triomphante beautÃ©
Et n'oublie jamais ou se terre l'Ã©carlate vÃ©ritÃ©

Acceptance of doing things
That are beyond your nature
Formal assurance that you are acting right
Whatever happens remember
That they could have no power at all
No power at all against you

Gloria victis!
Gloria victis!

Cleanliness and order in your modus operandi
Achievement of the Great Work
Obedience, silently

You are not one of them
Not the same breed
You always felt out of place
Join your true scene

You want blood, not peace
You want shouts, you want tears
Not wisdom
Some Divine in their afflictions

You are not one of them
Not the same breed
You always felt out of place
Join your true scene

You want fire, you burn
Want the Great, not the minor
The absolute
Black and blue
The forever storm
