It is coming
My last day
Sinner and saint
Innocent way

I don't know why
I don't know how
Passion is gone
The breath of life had a seizure
Do you know the name of the redeemer?

May the almighty God have mercy on you
In the name of the father...
And forgiving your sins, brings you to life everlasting
... And of the Son and of the Holy Ghost
Amen

So keep talking
The cheaters won
Life goes on
In deep depression

I don't know why
I don't know how
Passion is gone
So keep going down in my lover's arms
For I was wrong
For I was wrong

May the almighty God have mercy on you
In the name of the father...
And forgiving your sins, brings you to life everlasting
... And of the Son and of the Holy Ghost
Amen

We're all waiting for this masquerade to end
And nothing happens
No tears required
Just some dead meat between your thighs

We're all waiting for this masquerade to end
And nothing happens
No tears required
Just some dead meat between your thighs

We're all waiting for this masquerade to end
And nothing happens
No tears required
Just some dead meat between your thighs

We're all waiting for this masquerade to end
And nothing happens
No tears required
Just some dead meat between your thighs

We're all waiting for this masquerade to end
And nothing happens
No tears required
Just some dead meat between your thighs

We're all waiting for this masquerade to end
And nothing happens
No tears required
Just some dead meat between your thighs

We're all waiting for this masquerade to end
And nothing happens
No tears required
Just some dead meat between your thighs
