[Lyrics by RMS Hreidmarr]

His excess of light is searching for your darkness
He is the tyrant
There's one only law for him ...to be pure
He comes from above
He died a thousand times and put his hand in mine
He hails victory and loss

I hear him coming every single day
And the queen desires me
To use some gentle entertainment to him
If it be her will...

And I have no choice - Plus de chemin nulle part
I should kill for him - I will kill for me
He shall bring me the anti-matter
No compassion, never
Never kneel before anyone

The wound is so deep
Them - Us - Against

I sacrify my right arm to the golden rain
And I know it's a sign
I know the end is near
One black cancer to make the children close their eyes
Abime, Abyssus, Propator !

The red earth is trickling down on the wall
Its blood is running off my veins

Et tandis que le grand feu devore le monde la matiere
Je prends ma place a la porte du cercle divin

Antagonize the world - Incest and crime
Humiliation of the whore - Cum, suck me child
Vengeance is mine - Murder is wine
Purification through the forever more

Hold your breath and picture the scene

The green-eyed angels are losing their wings
All mothers are devorating the babies
While children fornicate with animals
And fathers die of overdose

Dressons le bucher de ce monde
Et les ames des elus seront la substance divine

United we stand
We walk through the flames
We walk upon the ruins of your dreams
Of charity and of respect
