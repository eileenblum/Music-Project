"The one who never laments and desires"
is dear to the heart of...
Ebola-monkey carries its heartbreak animalcules in the Saharan desert"
"come to me!" -
The master defying...
I went out &amp; saw it...

"Will I be still there tomorrow?"
Sadness &amp; melancholy

A pustular cascade...
Soren on the rocks...
Vague justifications...
The crime...
A compulsive treason
The original sin

I sat myself...
My legs feel ash, prostrated by the central aspiration...
I knew that something was tickling me under the tong (encouraging me to talk?)
Fire

Slow conspiracy &amp; some mouths spelling words in an unknown language...
"Time was come to us to call for him!"
"Let him come to shower us with his tears"...
Until dusk
"Think about this time, when you didn't exist at all !"
Atavistic idolatry

"Are these wax puppets my toys?.."
So someone in the crowd answered him to it is &amp; some guards beheaded him for the moment...

the master with the elephant body &amp; storms in the saharan desert...
scorpions with an axe tongue...
walking in the single line...
sucking the sap flowing down from the feel of the Ebola-Monkey,
the latter recognisable by its mammary growth...

- "Nothing is decided with out your raising the voice!"
the frozen men proclaim...
- "Come to me!"
Plastic suction

Revolting vision...
Plump disciples full of come...
Cloning eyes...
Crackling tongue...

One night, I had this dream :...
"Who are you?.."
"My own shadow"
"Legibility, why?.."
At first was the hermaphrodite...
So the flash.
The birds flew from the shore to escape from the new-born babies appearance...
