Yantric symptoms &amp; collusion of the body with the need...
play of a spirit ready to leave...
Ebola-Monkey visited me...
I had to kneel, to implore its grace
"Nothing more is to hope"
"Won't be there tomorrow"
The spirit of the valley doesn't die,
there resides the universe root subtle ans steady, it seems to last
Its functions never runs out...
"Holding a whisk... wanted to strike me...
Be-seeching him to make it hard...
But no mass anymore to implore him
The shady silence...
Abandoned me angels appeared to me."
"Are you holding the immortality mask?.."
I cried for the closed failure of the day
Twice etheric, I went out into the park to find the birds,
I didn't learn anything from them.
I was alone, dedicated to a certain death.
Ebola-Monkey in the original night.
I was alone, dedicated to a certain death.
Ebola-Monkey in the original night .
Ain-soph... is calling for me...
This state before birth &amp; deprived of oneself
reinstatement...
Unceasing mental flood &amp; regain calmness...
Concealed exhaustion
Foetal position...
The room is talking to me...
Mustn't answer &amp; the whole life will dir out this evening...
Embryonic dusk &amp; reddening landscape...
Cawing the marsh
The civilisation is regressing &amp; disappearing in my soul.
Body abstraction...
"At the end of the times we will be all spirits,
the matter will first resolve itself &amp; then will be dashed...
Only the spirits will remain in the liquefying space"
Conform space-time...
