I don't think,
collapse &amp; I adopt the foetus position...
I don't have much time to live...
"Who told you this?"
..."Something divides us do you know what it is?"
"No, I don't!"...
So I decide I won't go in this particular corner of my bedroom anymore...
Even to watch myself naked, with this horrible disability between my legs...
This three handed things which dangles down...
Ridiculous growth
Dunce's cap &amp; punishment.
