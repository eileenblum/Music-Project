...Lure of a protean beast...
chattering teeth the poison of the instilled &amp; insignificant murder -
death as a show -
dazed mob rushing at the clumsy executioner to free the torture victim...
Broken bones, ripped limbs...
On the cracked tongue &amp; lust, expanded...
taken from a floor to another
Death as a transfiguration...
The shaking eyes of the goddess with her string of skulls.
