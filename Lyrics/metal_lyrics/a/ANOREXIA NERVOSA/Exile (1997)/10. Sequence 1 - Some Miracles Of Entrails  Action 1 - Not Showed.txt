I was to close this strange compendium...
Fixed mirror...
This wall where I've climbed on to all the night
The astonishing disarray of the body its shrewd tongue that has just disappeared
I would have liked
"He has not to do this..."
Nothing more was possible
Carnal torture &amp; final stop...
This simple nothing
"Set me free..."
Pacify my burns
Flight...
Reached belly &amp; great smile...
