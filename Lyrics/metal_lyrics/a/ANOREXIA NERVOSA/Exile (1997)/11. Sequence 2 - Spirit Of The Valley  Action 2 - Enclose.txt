Angel faces' beasts...
Near the door all the night...
I'm no longer the absolute spirit
Theatre of sordid illusions &amp; prisoner of darkness
Complex machine &amp; matter's union...
The metals fallen from the sky inhaling the vital saps &amp; dream of the Babylonian alchemy
Shady deal with the flesh &amp; the life will pass away with my orgasm...
Ityphallicsculpture...
I am sure now: peace of the mirror
