So every day,
I get up &amp; come back to the mirror
...To fall silent at last...
Yet... "Don't go..."
"I don't go anywhere, I think!"
How long will is still last...
not to suffer from any kind of affront...
Am I here to tell myself that it's possible for me tomorrow not to wake up?...
Am I here to tell myself?

Fire &amp; flesh are false -
The executioner went back to his position -
The mob doesn't care about divine justice anymore.
