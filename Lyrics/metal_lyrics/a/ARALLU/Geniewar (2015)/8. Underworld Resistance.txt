Living under the land
Hearing the humans march
Creating the army of the judgment day
I'm the genie of the underworld

Lines of bloodstained swords wait for them,
Warriors, demons of the scum sperm they are born

The upper world begins to feel the evolution
I'm the genie of the underworld

I lay below the alleyways of Jerusalem, rotating the sun,
Violating the balance of the world
The Dome of the Rock must come to an end
Only a bloody Holy war will castrate the enemy
I am the demon of the underworld

From the heart of the world
War will break out
From the heart of the World
The resistance will arise

Decades of bloodshed over the holy land
Jerusalem, the ghost of the land
I call you, Revenge!!!
