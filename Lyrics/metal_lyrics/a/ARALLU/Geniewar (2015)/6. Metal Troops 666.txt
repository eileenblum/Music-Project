These were hard days on the holy ground
The blood flowed as a river
Everywhere, it was a massacre
Smoke, ash, flames and chaos, they bring with them

Thirsty for the blood, hungry for the flesh
Resistance fighters, keepers of the holy land

No holds barred, no boundaries no limits
They strike with hell's wrath
The enemy annihilation was insane.

Bombardments, attacks and
Destruction celebrated
Executions of the traitor's en masse
Legions of trains loaded with cadavers

(From desert genii storm
Like the spirits of death
Living under the land
They grow, as metal troops)

From the underground they fight
Drunk from the spilling of blood
