You wonder all the time
Why me?
What has happened to me?
After all you have done
It's not the end you longed for
You feel the world hate you, offending you,

Miserable

But then suddenly it works
Everything becomes part of the process
You are centered in a huge puzzle

The spirits of death create your end
Before you are born

You pass through the passages
As you drift deeper inside
Whether you want to or not.

And all that's around you
Is the background of your process
All around you are actors of your world

Spirits of death lead your way
To the coronation

Coronation!
