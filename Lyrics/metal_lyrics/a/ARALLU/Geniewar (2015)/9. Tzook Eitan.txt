We are all - marching for war
We are all - bleeding inside
We are all - feeling the pain
We are all - Tzook Eitan

Tzook Eitan - we stand and fight
Tzook Eitan - brave soldiers
Tzook eitan - we are strong
Tzook eitan - we always stand and fight

The enemy , afraid for his loss
We're here to keep the land
Soldiers of honor
Soldiers of war
We are all united!

We stand as a rock blocking the fire
We're sent to protect our people
sent to bring victory
We're fighters and always will be!

Tzook Eitan we stand and fight
Tzook Eitan brave soldiers
Tzook Eitan we are strong
Tzook Eitan we always stand and fight

Know behind the border death is waiting
Every step can be the last

But we shall never retreat!
