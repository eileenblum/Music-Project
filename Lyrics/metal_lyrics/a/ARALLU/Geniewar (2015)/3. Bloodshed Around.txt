In the center of total bloodshed
In the midst of total war
They slaughter their victims
Civil war erupts all around
There exists a small state

No man's land
Fighting for her life
From the Nile to Syria
From Baghdad to the Mediterranean

Rivers of blood, overflowing
The Blood fills Mesopotamia
Now Babylon is rising
The sands begin shifting

Land of blood and hatred for enemies
Land of blood hatred and trauma now calm.
wishes of Arallu are realized All my
The demon hits them, strikes them one by one,

Equally

Punishes them and drinks their blood
Sorcerer curses their souls
Under the fog, the sand dwelling souls are collected for Hell

Hell that was prepared specially for them
