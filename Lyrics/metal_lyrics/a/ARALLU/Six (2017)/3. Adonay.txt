The light burns my eyes
My soul leaving my body
Everything turns cold and dark
I'm checking, confuse
My body slammed on the ground
I'm wet and cold
Please stop the light that burns my eyes
Please clean my body I'm soaked in blood
Graveyard gates are opened once again
They throw my body inside the grave
From far away hear the screams
The unclear words
Why everybody stand above me?
Who is leading me to the light?
His wings cover me
His tail surrounding me

Adonay
Down below they prepare the ceremony
I am marching to the judgment of the dead
I'm just a man from Jerusalem street
And the gates are closed on me
