This is the war that will not be forgotten
I hear the screams of the dead
Calling me to join them
The warriors of hell are on my leading way.

Broken bodies on the ground!

There is blood , blood ,blood
Massacre, Lebanon, we won't forget
Satan sent me to his war
My demons take the souls

And strengthen the master

The souls of the dead unite!
The power will come forth

I see the fire , see the distraction
Black skies, blood and flesh
Butchered, slaughters

With his sword of death!
Open the gates of hell!

Bring in the demons!

ISLAM-- DEATH!!!
CHRISTIANITY- DEATH!!!

War , war , war- this is the way...
