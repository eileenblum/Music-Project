We look at the sky
We see the other world
A stronger light falls on us
Get us closer to him

In the next millennium
We see the world come above us

Something opens, a ball of fire
Arises on everything
Spills red sperm on the earth

It gives birth to evil warriors
And human beings are nothing

I see the sign to the black worlds
Burn, burn, burn, burn,burnd!!

Open the gate of the mysterious world
I got the curse of death from him

Arallu
Makes me messenger on the earth

Arallu
Evil world
