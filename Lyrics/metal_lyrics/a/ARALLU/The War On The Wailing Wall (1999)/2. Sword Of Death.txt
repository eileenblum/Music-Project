Nothing will ever stop the pain
Only the cold freezing death
The rippers boat gets closer
In a river of blood
As he holds a sword in his hand

Red dragon spilling blood
with a warriors on him
came to stop the ripper
from taking a mortal souls

The warrior start the battle
Satan's fog was everywhere
And Butchered came from Egypt gate
To Jerusalem

And..
