I see the black shadows staring at me
I'm freezing alone
Something holds me
Eats me from inside

Blood spills from my hands
I see the inverted cross
Rotting before me
Curse the genii

I feel I want my powers back
Forces that only I can use

Save me demons from the black wings
Save me father, save me Satan!!
Save me Satan!!

Silence

All will came back
And the Butchered came from the dead

With the devils sign- PENTAGRAM

Now no one will survive!!!
