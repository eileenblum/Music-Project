Demons call me through the night
Hate and evil go inside
The devil killing all around
The Armageddon is done

Master of the dead
Death of one
The killing has just begun

The rotting people of hell
Are in darkness
Silent and pain of horror
Is war

Is war!!!

The fear came
Life cant be the same

I am the Butchered
BUTCHERED!!!
