I wake up the morning after ,feeling that its over
Riding the roads and observing ,seeing flashbacks
I know that it will be back ,but we had our chance
We had brought it on ourselves

"lO LASHALOM - KEN LAMILHAMA" (no for peace - yes for war)

They remember and know what happened!

Not! their choice, but our destiny
They chose and they shall accept
Gods worshipers are getting stronger
How can it be???

Theres no way out , a few years and heres the past

The morbid shadow floats from above
Maybe thats our sign for the end

And you shall see my promise when it ends!
