We will do what you command
He sat on an evil throne.

The witch has begun
To walk on the abyss of hell
The 13 warriors of father take her and wait.

For whom or for what do they wait?
A black mist appears and he comes

Father ,Lucifer, master Satan

King of darkness, master of evil
God of demons, we are your sons

We will do what you command us
He sat on an evil throne
Evil throne and he screaming
I wont sacrifice.

Fire, the bloody witch, she burn!!!!
