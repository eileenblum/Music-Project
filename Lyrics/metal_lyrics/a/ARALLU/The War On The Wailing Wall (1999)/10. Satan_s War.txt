Hell!
This is the black moment of the full moon
Running in the woods , looking for the weapons
Sitting on my knees , the victim in my hands (bleeding)
Screaming for mercy!

All around inversed crosses
Dripping blood on the wall
Staring at me ,with their souls!

Getting my power from their souls
I'm collecting those souls ,who betrayed me
In war!

This is Satan's war!!!
Of the demons!!

Satan captured me , burned my soul in hell
Father is staring, say to the genie
This is your messenger, help him

Help him to find those angels of god
Who betrayed him
Blood red holy land

Jerusalem!!!!

Help me to find
The burnt souls in Arallu's hell

Open the gate to Arallu
Messiah of all evil

This is Satan's war!!!
