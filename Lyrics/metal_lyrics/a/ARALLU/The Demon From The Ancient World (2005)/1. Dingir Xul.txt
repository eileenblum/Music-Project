From a great distance I can see the altar
The victim as food to gomor the Uggae

On a mosaic of inverted crosses
They dance and sacrifice
In ancient times when witches knew all

Kashshaptu already knew of his arrival
Within her eyes I could see it accrue

The storm, the fire, and the blood
Created alal, created alal!

Arallu above and the abyss below
They contact through the human race

I curse you for being so shut!!!

Do you think all that horror is just a coincidence?!
All of these are ornaments for
The demon from the ancient world

Out of the flames and crushing holy land
He will crush the holy land
