The Butchered comes
From the pits of hell...

Slaughtered, so endless
Mortal souls
With the demon's sword
Welcome to the caveblood
Decapitated the angels of god.

The Butchered is a killer
Of evil supreme,
And it will come to
Satan's war, Butchered...

The blood spills 
From the enemy's corpses
When I slay the victims
Misanthrope
Misanthrope...
