They called him the MAD ARAB
The man who laid our meaning in code
While they search for the answer
Try to solve the puzzle
The truth itself is in the code
Only true believers are worthy of his work.
Hidden in the sands
Buried in the desert!

MASTER now his name.

The talismans, the keys, the gates
Will open the door to a black world
To horror, to terror
For eons they ask: is it true or false?

Well, a question it will remain forever
The answer will evoke when the game is over!
The book is written in spells
Which only we understand.

The book of the dead
Gives the living its meaning
The man who wrote of what he saw
Of what he learned tales of the black world
And the spirits beyond

He risked his life for us to taste
Of another world,
A soil with only one side to its truth

The MAD ARAB they called him
Master in their eyes
Possessor of the code,
About the truth, it's all to come.
