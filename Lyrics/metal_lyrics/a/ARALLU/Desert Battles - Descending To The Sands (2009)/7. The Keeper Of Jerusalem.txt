My eyes are open,
Though I'm inside a dream

I'm laying on the bed,
But my soul is running
I feel the burning sweat covering my body.
My heart beats as hell
I can't catch my breath
I'm waiting for the days that will
Change my life.

Waiting for the reorganization fire!
For the genie's daughter.
Now I'm vulnerable
Now I have something to lose...
I know the enemy will utilize it.
This secret I will keep close.

My words are clear now.
Not for myself I'm living for
Not for myself I'm fighting for!
I'm fighting for the next of generations
Fighting for the children of tomorrow!

The children that haven't tasted
This world of hatred yet
This world of pain, this world of terror

I wait, day by day, hour by hour
For the death blow.
Waiting for the time when Satan
Will destroy them
Erase the scum from the universe.
Erase the from the universe.

For seven days and seven nights,
Jerusalem will be in darkness
This seven days and seven nights you will
Hear the scum screaming in the streets.
Inside a liquid he keeps her from the outside evil,
Inside her soul turns to pure innocence.

She is the genie's daughter.
From all this evil she creates beauty and wisdom.

This child of hope
A hope for the next generations.
The keeper of Jerusalem,
The almighty demon will watch this child...
