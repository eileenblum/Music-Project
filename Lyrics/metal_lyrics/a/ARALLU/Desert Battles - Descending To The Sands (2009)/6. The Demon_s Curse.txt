In the time of demons and rulers
The desert was stable.
Only to deteriorate into war
As soon as they have forsaken these
Land into humanity's control

It was a curse that was set upon these lands,
By genii who roamed the ancient
Land of Mesopotamia.
As humans took hold of the land
Chaos embarked along

They hover above, grinning
They knew peace would be gone!

Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria - controlled by terror.
Jordan, Egypt and Sudan - controlled by human stupidity.

Echa has its purpose in the hierarchy of the cosmos
This power called life is too powerful for humans
No wonder their death is as a blink in the demons eyes.

Control is unobtainable!

Iran, Iraq, Lebanon and Syria - controlled by terror.
Jordan, Egypt and Sudan - controlled by human stupidity.
In the time when chaos will peak
And humans will lose all their hope
Armageddon shall bless this earth.

Sanity and light shall be restored in Jerusalem by the devil

It is only a matter of time till the gates will open
And through them will come the balance long
Needed in Mesopotamia.

The balance which will storm through the tunnels
Reuniting the dead souls.
