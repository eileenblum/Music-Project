It was so massive and tall
Its tip rips through the sky
Even god was intimidated
They talked in tongues
But they couldn't understand

It messed up their communication!
Punished them, broke their unity,
Trashed it to pieces!!

They betrayed him,
But soon enough they'll understand
He thinks only of himself
Always he will stand above.

The demons built each and
Every one of the seven floors
Thus are the ruins of Babylon
MARDUK opened the gates to the sky
They rebel and fight by
The hands of ARALLU.

The Babylonians were stripped of their independence
Stripped down to nothing
Their arrogance angered the genii
And still they pay!

Looking back at the past, the human race was so naÃ¯ve
Only now they understand that it was never for their own good
That's the reason why they fail!

We are just chess instruments played by the black angels
In attempt to destroy the world!

They try to make us understand
But the human race is so blind
Like sheep without a shepherd
Like leaderless troops

It broke their unity, but still we pay.
