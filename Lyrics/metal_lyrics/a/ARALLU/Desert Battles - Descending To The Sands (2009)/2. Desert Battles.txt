After decades of war,
Seeing Babylon turn to dust
I received my rest, as my elders did before.
Now, fighting is my speciality.
After many years of battles
And hundreds of wars

I prevailed!!

My time to relax has arrived.
I sit on my throne, tasting the finest grapes.
The robe on my shoulders covers
The blood-stained sword strapped to my side,
As my soldiers enjoy the victory party.

MARUTUKKU by my right
ASHARUALIM to my left.
Their shields aside as they take
Pleasure from the dance
of Babylonian whores!

The sweet sounds of the desert wind vanished
When the guard burst in, shouting: "WAR!"
Both ASHARUALIM and MARUTUKKU
Stood between the Butchered and the door.

Awaiting the new rival.
My commands are now clear...
GILMA is to serve me the head of the cunt
That has dared to come and attack my land.
