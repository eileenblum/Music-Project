DIE!
I call on you for WAR!

The past comes back with a blow,
I awake to the sounds of Death.
Tzidon, Tzur, Beirut, Bint Jubel, Tripoli
We have arrived to pound you again!

Our enemies threaten our existence
This time we are not as weak.
We awakened the voices of demons past.
Our anger is a deadly fist.

Hatred in our eyes, bone crushing teeth
We'll awake the beast within
Time will come and we will commence the destruction
The destruction of the inferior parasites that infests the Mesopotamian land in our time
Battles of this kind were foretold.

In this time of man it is us who take the form of ancient genii.
Crushing, destroying, ruling
It will be us who will erupt out of these poisonous times.

Victorious!

I can hear the dead clarion call
The drums of war blast in our nations mind.
As it called in the battles of this land's past.
Echoes of this war shall roam the earth for times to come.

The enemy is close to his defeat,
Losing his strength
Mesopotamia, a never anding
Blood red battleground
Arabian lands, your body count will never stop!
The three main religions are the death crusade forced by the human race

Some things will never change
War! War! War! As I said before remains the only way!
