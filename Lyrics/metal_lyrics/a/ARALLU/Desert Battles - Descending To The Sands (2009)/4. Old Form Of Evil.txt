At that frozen place
The place which death conquered
That which was buried for
Thousand years is coming to life!
Old form of evil

Not a life as you wish
Not a joyful life
Global warming by Satan's hands
As he melts the icebergs
To future rivers of blood

At that frozen place
The germs, insects and plagues
Are defrosting once again
Soon they dwell on us as well as before
As in ancient times

Beneath the frozen ground
The smell of rot is growing
Kept there for all those years
Now it's turning loose
An old form of evil coming again for
The human race.
Venom and disease are upon us again!

Those forms of sickness
Bites into us as if we're butter
Ripping our skin to nothing
This evil is coming closer

Slowly though the fog
When he attacks
Each one of you will die
Evil has no boundaries

Evil doesn't care, he is only eager for the kill!
