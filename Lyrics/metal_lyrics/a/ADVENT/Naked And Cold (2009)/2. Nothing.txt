I canât seem to answer all these questions in
My Mind is running overtime to figure out
This Life so full of anguish without all the death we see.
I see, I hear you, but itâs so hard to believe.
God, where are we now?
Can you hear us through those clouds?
When the rain is beating down?
Our hopes and dreams never left the ground.
Nothingâs being done for your daughters or your sons.
Everything just stays the same.
So they tell me Nothingâs your name.
Do we believe in Nothing?
(Nothing? Nothing? Nothing? Nothing? Nothing?)
Scream at the sky!
I scream at the sky!
Into the big nothing, begging to hear something.
Into the big nothing, begging to hear...
Scream at the sky.
As I close my eyes to sleep,
I decide I still believe.
