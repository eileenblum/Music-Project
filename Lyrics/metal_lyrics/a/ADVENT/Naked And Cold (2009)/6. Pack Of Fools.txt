Show yourself to the world,
the cancer that you are.
You parade on the stage.
Your followers in awe,
engaged to a fake... to a fake.
A snake charmer without a snake.
Youâre the death of their faith,
and for that you will be burned alive at the stake.
You think youâve found your sheep to fool?
Iâve warned you, but soon you will find out,
youâll find a pack of wolves... pack of wolves... pack of wolves.
Youâll find a pack of wolves here!
Pack Of Wolves.
Youâll find a pack of wolves here!
Youâll find no pack of fools here!
Pack Of Wolves.
Youâll find no pack of fools here.
You turned around and found youâre all alone with no legs to stand on.
No way to run away from the mess youâve made to try and find another pack of fools...
pack of fools...
pack of fools...
pack of fools.
