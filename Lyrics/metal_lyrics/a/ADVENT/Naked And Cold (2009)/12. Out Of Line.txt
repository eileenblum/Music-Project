The American way.
I pray to God,
this lie will have nothing to do with me.
American way.
The lie of the century.
Told by the great deceiver.
Laid down as a law of the land.
To question is the greatest of sins.
So we raise up our flags.
Call ourselves the chosen sons of God.
Add another link in the chain.
Get in line. Assimilate.
Itâs your call to be true to red, white and blue.
But is there something truly wrong when we drape the flag over the Cross?
You say freedom isnât free,
but who the Son sets free is free indeed.
Weâre freed by His name,
not by homeland security.
I will never be ashamed of My Redeemerâs mighty name
and I will never run and hide...
hide under the flag of violent pride.
I step out of line.
I step out of line.
And so I step out of line.
Raise the flag.
Raise the flag up high.
Raise the flag.
Raise the flag.
I walk against violent pride with these violent strides.
In defiance of prideful men.
I stand against blind allegiance to a nation that kills its children.
To a nation that profits in death.
To a nation that reaps what it sows.
Blood, sweat and tears.
Reap the flag.
Reap the flag.
Blood. Sweat. Death.
Blood. Sweat. Death.
We will reap blood, sweat, death.
Blood. Sweat. Death.
Blood. Sweat. Death.
Blood. Sweat. Death.
We will reap blood, and sweat, and death.
We will reap blood, sweat, death.
