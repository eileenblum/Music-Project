Pierce yourself with grief.
Your hope in worthless things.
Your falsehoods and your blood money
cry out against you even now.
Wealth of men means nothing after death.
Wealth of money hungry hypocrites,
sealed in mansions in the deepest depths of fiery hell.
Weep and wail.
Fatten yourself for the day of slaughter.
Woe to you. Condemn yourself you rich oppressor...
Children of misfortune littering the streets.
Passing by your mansions, laying broken dreams at your feet.
Looking from your high-rise the poor seem so small.
Crush Them under the weight of your corporate monster,
slaving away kills them all...
What have we done to our faith?
Why have we killed in His name?
Children are being enslaved as we chase fortune and fame.
What have we done to our faith?
Why have we killed in His name?
Children are being enslaved as we chase fortune and fame...
Weâve paved our...
Weâve paved our own way.
Weâve... Weâve paved our...
Weâve paved our own streets straight to hell.
Weâve paved our own streets straight to hell.
Weâve paved our own streets straight to hell.
Weep and wail.
Fatten yourself for the day of slaughter.
Woe to you. Condemn yourself you rich oppressor.
All we have to offer You is the blood washed from our hands.
Paved (paved)
with (with) blood.
Paved (paved)
