Tear me down.
Tear me down.
Tear me down.
Set fire to my weakness.
Place Your word inside my heart.
Bring joy into my sadness.
Your righteousness my rock.
Your mercy is my comfort,
Your grace is all I need.
Your Name it goes before me.
Your blood it sets me free...
The chains of death are no more.
The chains of death are loosed.
For all men, atonement for all sin...
How do I know this peace inside of me?
How do I have this peace inside of me?
How do I hear this peace inside of me?
How do I have this peace inside of me?
Your love.
Your love.
Your voice. Your word.
Your love.
Your voice. Your word.
Your love.
Your voice. Your word.
Your love.
Your voice. Your word.
Lead me away.
Only my flesh is afraid.
Lead me away.
Lead me away.
Pick up my cross, I die daily.
I will follow Him to the place of the skull.
I will follow You to the place of the skull.
Golgotha.
Golgotha.
