State your values.
State your case.
State your purpose.
We just want to hear you say youâre fake.
We Scream with anger but not from hate.
We Scream with passion but not for fame.
We Scream resistance to see a change.
We Scream for justice to see a better day.
Your words mean nothing.
Your words mean nothing.
With Anger!
In Anger!
From Anger!
I draw the line within.
You Scream for nothing,
your actions speak.
You Scream for boasting,
youâll have your fame.
You Scream injustice and youâll find it
in the face of every follower running in circles...
Running in circles.
Recreating waste.
Your words mean nothing.
Recreating waste.
Running in circles.
Recreating waste.
Your words mean nothing.
Youâre recreating waste...
