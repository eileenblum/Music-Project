There is a light in my heart,
the catalyst to ignite the spark.
There is a name on my tongue:
Emmanuel, God with us.
There is a cry from deep within our broken hearts
for You to meet us here.
And as we gather in this place,
Lord send Your Spirit to ignite the flames of revival.
Revival.
Revival.
Revival.
God send revival.
There is an Almighty King.
His love endures.
He makes righteous everything.
His voice controls the seas.
Lion of Judah, Prince of Peace.
There is a name above all names.
Jesus Christ, King of Kings.
And as we gather in His name,
strongholds will fall in the wake of the flames of revival.
Revival.
Revival.
Revival.
