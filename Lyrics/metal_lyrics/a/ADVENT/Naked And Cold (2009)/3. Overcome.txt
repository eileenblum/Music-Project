OVERCOME
The foolishness of the cross?
Salvation for the lost?
Are we decieving ourselves for our cause?
I still believe in a GOD i can't see.
What foolish things do i cling to?
I stand accused, i'm a fool this cross i cling to [x2]
Will not be removed.
I cling to YOU
I am rooted in the truth.
In the truth
You, ancient of days.
I steep my heart in your almighty ways.
Spit in the face of the
Saviour
Spit in the face of the
Save Your
Spit in the face of the
Saviour
Spit in the face of the
Save Your Breath
Save you mockery
Saviour. Saviour
Save me. Save me from myself.
Overcome
I am not ashamed. To live is Christ, to die is surely gain.
Overcome
this worthless sense of grief
Stare death in the face. I am not afraid
Overcome
We will stare death in the face [x2]
OVERCOME
