From the shadows, you spit your rotten words.
Killing His name. Spit in His face. Crucify! Crucify!
Legacy of blasphemy. Nail yourself to your cross of lies.
I fight to hold my head above this sea of heresy.
I watch the blind living completely hopeless lives. It sickens me.
I refuse to give in for your prize. I will not believe in your lies.
I refuse to give in for your prize, I will not believe in your lies or give in for your prize.
I refuse your worthless, worthless, worthless prize. I will always fight for You.
I will always stand for truth. I will fight for You. I will always stand up.
I will stand for truth. I will fight for You. I will always stand up.
I will stand for truth. I refuse.
