Blackout.
Fear grips the heart of man as locust black
The sky over a nation that takes a stand
For crooked, spineless, murderers.
Self-righteous thieves.
They slither on the ground like a venomous disease.
They drink from the cup of ruin and desolation.
And they will soon choke on the blood of the innocent.
Tears for tears. Vengeance for vengeance.
You sow in deceit and you reap the consequences.
Bloodshed for bloodshed.
The treacherous betray. You sing a song of grace,
But with terror you repay. All your enemies will blackout the sky
Over this wicked land for your atrocities of enslaving the oppressed.
Backlash. The weary catch a breath.
Pushing back against the wall that held the captive in.
You will pay for selfishness and greed.
For endless hypocrisy. For crimes against humanity.
Your judgment is released. Meet your doom.
How can you be so blind to the truth?
Meet your doom. How can you be so blind?
Meet your doom. It will come swiftly.
For all to see. Drawn and quartered.
For all to see. America will plead for innocence,
But mercy will not be given to the merciless.
Only punishment.
