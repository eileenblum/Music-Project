Fighting to save our traditions.
Pointless endeavors and missions
Talk is all I hear.
Empty words.
From the heart to your mouth.
Impotent vision.
Throwing stones from cathedrals.
Empty pews.
Dead institutions.
Paying the fee
10 percent
Country club
Now you're in.
Bankrupt religion.
We do the same thing, every night, every day.
Nothing has changed, nothing has changed, nothing!

"A time will come, when silence is betrayal".
[MLK]

A time will come, when our voices will not be heard.
The years that we've chosen to say nothing, they'll return.
The guilt, the shame, the pain and the anger.

So, we break these chains.
Of religion, of useless tradition.
Moved to action â so we break these chains.
Of a system that has coaxed us to sleep.
Don't need religion â so we break these chains.
Religion has never set men free
Religious guilt dies with me

Weight of the world!
Chains falling down.
Weight of the world.
Chains falling down!

I won't be buried in chains.
I'm free from the shame
Religious guilt dies with me
Religious guilt diesâ¦

Judge. Jury. Execute.
