Shot in the back, point black
We caused this pain and suffering
What happens
The streets are crowded
With those we've rejected and neglected
The demonstrations of frustration
Because of brutality
Your god: politics
Turning brother against his brother
Build up your wall of hate brick by brick
Turning sons against their fathers
It makes me sick to see us hate one another
Turning fathers against their sons
No love lost, just blood
Turning fathers against their sons
No love lost, just blood
No love lost
Just blood
Turning fathers against their sons
Crushing with weight, rooted in hate
Brick by brick
Brick by bloody brick
Crushing with weight, rooted in hate
Brick by brick
Crushing with weight, rooted in hate
Cities built with bloody bricks
How can I not call it out?
Chaos fills the streets
It makes us enemies
Blinded by politics
We eliminate what makes us unique
No one is listening
But everyone screams what they believe
It's institution versus humanity
Turning fathers
Turning fathers against their sons
We built this monstrosity, brick by brick
We built this brick by bloody brick
