What is this pain
What is this suffering
Pain and suffering

A void, a darkness begins to take a hold of this soul
Deep in my chest
It knows me, but it's not the pain
It's not the suffering that scares me the most
It's just the cold
The emptiness, when there's nothing left
The days of solitude, they have beaten me down
Over and over, I have come to the end
I'm just waiting for a word from You
This brokenness I feel in this
It's just too much to bear
Tearing away the lost and forgotten dreams
That I once held
I've laid them all but down
To quit, the easy road, something I'll never know
The weight is too much
This mountains too high
The dark's closing in
But the fire inside is alive
Eternally the fire burns
A voice in the valley
Will you trust in me
When the world around you is dying
Inside, the spirit speaks
Setting fire to my weakness
The cold it burns away
A man, made new in his suffering
Pain, suffering
I can't see through this fog
I don't understand
Is this the end
Am I all alone
Pain, suffering
Forged in flames
Pain and suffering
Refined by pain
Forged in suffering
As wind blows from the valley
The fire inside still remains
The fire burns
Forged in suffering
As wind blows through the valley
The fire inside still remains
