I saw the shadow.
I heard his voice whisper my name.
I felt the chill of reality
When your spirit went away.
I felt the tears running down my face.
I knew he smiled as I felt the sting
My mind raced as I heard his deceit
Death robbed your family today

I felt my stomach sink
The pain, the suffering
I felt the chill of mortality
As I watched your color fade
I closed my eyes and I saw your face.
I felt it burn into my memory
It's a picture I can never erase
Death took my father away

Life is short.
Death is coming
Life escapes.
But death comes hunting
Every man, born of flesh.
Will take with him, nothing
What he leaves, memories
That will be his legacy
Face the trials.
Face the pain.
Face the fears.
Your final breath, drawing near.

Death is a thief
Death steals for keeps.

Death is coming,
There is no escape.
But death is not your destiny.
Death is a thief, death steals for keeps.

Life is [4x]
Life is short.
Death comes hunting.

Some men die now, some men die later.
Some men live for reasons beneath them, some live for greater.
At the moment of my death
As I take my final breath
Fatality! Not a moment left... and I step into eternity.
Into eternity
Will I be afraid?

What will await me?
Will I see my father, my family?
This life I lead, will it matter at all?
Buried six feet deep, body wrapped in pall.

I feel the shadow
It's coming for me
Do I really believe...
Death is not the end.
