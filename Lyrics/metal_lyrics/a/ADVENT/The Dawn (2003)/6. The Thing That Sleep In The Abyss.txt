Nightmares of worlds.
Nightmares of lands,
Nightmares of ancient places.

"That is not dead
Which can eternal lie
Yet with strange aeons
Even death may die."
[H. P. Lovecraft]

"...Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh
Wgah'nagl fhtagn..."

Circles of Stones lies around me,
Ancient Ruins in front of my mind:
Malevolent voices whisper in the night

"...Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh
Wgah'nagl fhtagn..."

Frost Oceans lies around me,
Ancient Stones o lost kingdom.
Mystical places of old wisdom.

Circles of darkness, visions of madness
Ancient horrors are standing in the dark
Malevolent shapes appear in the shadow

"That is not dead
Which can eternal lie
Yet with strange aeons
Even death may die."
[H. P. Lovecraft]

So far away It sleep in the Abyss
Down in the water It lies...

So far away It sleep in the Abyss
Down in the water It dreams...

Down in the Abyss:
In mystical eleven oceans
I see the seven eyes of madness

Down in the Abyss:
It comes out of Time and Space
It flew away beneath the stars.

Tormented my spirit by madness
Let my spirit free to fly beneath the stars...

Down in the Abyss:
In mystical eleven oceans
I see the seven eyes of madness

Tormented my spirit by madness
Let my spirit free to fly beneath the stars...
Torment by madness is my soul...

Circles of Ruins lies around me,
Ancient horrors lain in forgotten placesL
Malevolent voices murmur in the night

"...In the land of R'lyah he dead
Chthulhu
Waiting dreaming..."

Frost Oceans
Reboil around me
Ancient shapes
Arise from lost kingdom.
Mystical visions
Of mandess crimson.

Circles of nightmares
Visions o Nameless
Ancient terrors
Are standing in the dark
Malevolent dreads
Darken my mind

"That is not dead
Which can eternal lie
Yet with strange aeons
Even death may die."
