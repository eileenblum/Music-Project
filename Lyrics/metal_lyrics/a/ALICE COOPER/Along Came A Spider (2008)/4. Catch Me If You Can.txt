She was not the first, and he won't be my last
My hunger and my thirst, My brilliant future and my ugly past
They'll all be here with me, 'till my web is spun
My blessing and my curse, there'll be no rest until my work is done

Catch me, catch me if you can
Catch me, catch me when you can
I can't control myself

You won't have a clue of what is coming next
What I'm gonna do, surely classical in it's effect
Which limb will I choose, which one gets sawn in half
Which leg would you lose to an arachnophobic psychopath

Catch me, catch me if you can
I wrestled with the devil and I'd do it again
Catch me, catch me when you can
I can't control myself
Catch me, catch me if you can
I'm scheming with the demons and I'd do it again
Catch me, catch me when you can
I can't control myself
I can't control myself

Catch me, catch me if you can
Catch me, catch me when you can
Catch me, catch me if you can
I'm scheming with the demons and I'd do it again
Catch me, catch me when you can
I can't control myself
I just can't control myself
I'm scheming with the demons and I'd do it again
I wrestled with the devil and I'd do it again
I'm scheming with the demons and I'd do it again
