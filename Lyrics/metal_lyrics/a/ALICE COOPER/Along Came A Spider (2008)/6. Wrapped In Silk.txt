Where did I see those eyes
Why do I feel your heat
How do I know your name
When did we ever meet
Did you just pass me by
When did I smell your scent
I followed you from behind
Everywhere you went

(My, My, My, My, My)

You should be wrapped in silk
You should be bathed in white
You should be wrapped in silk
I'll make that dream come true tonight
Yes tonight
Yes tonight
Yes tonight
Tonight's the night

How did you see my face
When could you feel the knife
Was it your final thought
The moment I took your life
And just when your heartbeat failed
Were you just filled with fright
Were you in dark despair
Did you see the holy light?

(My, My, My, My, My)

You should be wrapped in silk
You should be bathed in white
You should be wrapped in silk
I'll make that dream come true tonight
Wrapped in silk
Dressed in white
Bathed in milk
I'll make that dream come true tonight
Yes tonight
Yes tonight
Tonight's the night
I'll turn off your lights (turn off your lights)

Where did you get that skin
I've never seen such teeth
It covers up all your sick...sin(?)
I wonder what's underneath

Did you just pass me by
When did I smell your scent
I followed you from behind
Everywhere you went

(My, My, My, My, My)

You should be wrapped in silk
You should be bathed in white
You should be wrapped in silk
I'll make that dream come true tonight
Wrapped in silk
Dressed in white
Bathed in milk
I'll make that dream come true tonight
Yes tonight
Yes tonight
Tonight's the night
I'll turn off your lights (turn off your lights)
