You gotta chased on your face
You got some scare in your hair
You got some rock in your walk
And some hips in your slips

Stop running
Stop hiding
Just wanna get in touch with your feminine side

You look so cool, you look so sweet
Come on baby, come on over baby
It's your world, but it's my street
Come on baby, come on over baby

You got stars on your scars
You got surprise in your eyes
You put some bite in the night
You got some sin on your skin

Stop running
Stop hiding
Just wanna get in touch with your feminine side
You look so cool, you look so sweet
Come on baby, come on over baby
It's your world, but it's my street
Come on baby, come on over baby

Stop running
Stop hiding
Just wanna get in touch with your feminine, touch with your feminine side

You look so cool, you look so sweet
Come on baby, come on over baby (inside)
It's your world, but it's my street
Come on baby, come on over baby (inside)
You look so cool, you look so sweet
Come on baby, come on over baby (inside)
It's your world, but it's my street
Come on baby, come on over baby (inside)
Woo woo.. woo woo.. woo woo
Woo woo.. woo woo.. woo woo
