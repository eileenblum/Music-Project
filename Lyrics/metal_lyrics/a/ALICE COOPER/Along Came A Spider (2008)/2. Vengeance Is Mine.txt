They hated every part of me
Expect me to forget it
They tried so hard to bury me
But I survived it every time

Convicted of every crime
Silently doing time
But when I get outta here
I wanna make it clear

Vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine, mine, mine
To forgive is divine
But vengeance is mine, mine, mine

They tortured every inch of me
Then expect me to forget it
They thought that they would finish me
But I pull through every time

Punish me everyday
But I'll never break
Hold on to all your fears
'cause when I get outta here

Vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine, mine, mine
To forgive is divine
But vengeance is mine, mine, mine

(Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance)

What I want
(Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance)

What I need
(Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance,
Vengeance)

What I want, What I need, What I want, What I need
(Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance,
Vengeance)
What I want, What I need, What I want, What I need
(Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance,
Vengeance)
(Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance, Vengeance... Vengeance)

Vengeance is mine, mine, mine
To forgive is divine
Not as rewarding I find
Because vengeance is mine...

Vengeance is mine, mine, mine
Vengeance is mine
Vengeance is mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, mine
