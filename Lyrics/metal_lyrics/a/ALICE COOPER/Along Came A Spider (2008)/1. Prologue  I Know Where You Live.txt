[Prologue:]
"We found his diary today.
He wrote in great detail, how cleverly he planned all of the killings.
How precisely he executed his insane fantasies.
It was all so perfect except for one thing...
(one thing, one thing, one thing, one thing)"

I like to watch from my car
I like to make sure you don't go far
I know the hours you sleep
Don't approve of the company that you keep

While you're in work I'm alone
In your room, on your bed and you'll never know
I like to go through your things
The touch, the smell, the joy it brings

I know where you live
I know where you hide
I know what keeps you alive
I know where you go
I know who you know
I know where your spending your nights

I don't like the guy in the suit
Or that street punk in the combat boots
You may not see them again
I showed them a quick but painful end

I know where you live
I know where you hide
I know what keeps you alive
I know where you go
I know who you know
I know where your spending your nights

I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you

I want to know what you say
I need to hear the prayers you pray
I like to play with your hair
When you sleep and you dream and there's no one there

I know where you live
I know where you hide
I know what keeps you alive
I know where you go
I know who you know
I know where your spending your nights

I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you
I see, I feel, I watch over you
