I'm your lover
I'm your brother
I'm your killer
I'm your friend
I'm your teacher
I'm your preacher
I'm the reaper in the end

I'm your healer
I'm your dealer
I'm your angel, lets pretend
I'm your jailer
I'm your failure
I'm the reaper in the end

Along came a Spider
Crept up beside her
Spun his web deep inside her
My darkness will guide her

I am the spider
I am the spider
I am the spider
I am the spider

You're my sinner
You're my dinner
My little puppet, let's pretend
You're the cure to my affliction
My addiction to the end

Along came a Spider
Crept up beside her
Spun his web deep inside her
My darkness will guide her

I am the spider
I am the spider
I am the spider
I am the spider

I was born to it (?)
Not something to strive for
Not something to even admire
Unless it was
it's done with the greatest of taste
Conviction and expertise
I am the spider

Along came a Spider
Crept up beside her
Spun his web deep inside her
My darkness will guide her

I am the spider
I am the spider
I am the spider
I am the spider

Epilogue:
Spider:
"Well, they found my diary today.
They were appropriately appalled
at the discovery of the eight victims
They're now putting it all together.
Women wrapped in silk
with one leg missing
Eight legs, one body, silk,
spider, brilliant!"
"We've been in this cell
for 28 years Steven
We couldn't have done all
those horrible things
Yes, I know
I know what you always say
You trap, you kill, you eat
That's what a good spider does
You trap, you kill, you
eat. You trap, you kill, you eat."
