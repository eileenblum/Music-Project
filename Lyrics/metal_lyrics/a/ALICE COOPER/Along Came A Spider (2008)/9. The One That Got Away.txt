You look like
you'd fit in the trunk of my car
I might let you live, I might go too far
I could wrap you up and take you home
We'd be all alone

Or should I let you be the one that got away
Knew it would happen
but I didn't know it'd be today
All the voices in my head always seem insane
The one that got away, away, away, today

Keep it down don't talk, I have to think
I could let you walk, I could feed the sink
I could grind you up and disappear
like you were never here

Should I let you
be the one that got away
Knew it would happen
but I didn't know it'd be today
All the voices in my head
always seem insane
The one that got away

[Voiceover:]
[Spider:]
"Hi, I was just wondering if you could help me out.
Um.. my hands are full could you just help me open the door to my van?"
[Victim:]
"oh I'm sorry
you see I just broke my nail
and I can't even hold my keys..
I ... gotta go.. dumb psycho"
[Spider:] "Hmm... must be your lucky day"

I should of let you be the one that got away
Knew it would happen but I didn't know it'd be today
All the voices in my head scream insane
The one that got away
You're the one that got away
Ah you're the one that got away
The one that got away (away, away, away, away, away)
The one that got away (away, away, away, away, away)
The one that got away (away, away, away, away, away)

[Voiceover:]
[Spider:] "Hmm, maybe some other time"
