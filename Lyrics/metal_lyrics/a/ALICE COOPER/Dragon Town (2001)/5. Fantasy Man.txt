I don't drink tea
Or white chablis
I sit around and watch tv
Don't send flowers
Or take showers
But I'll be there to pull your weeds
Oh yeah
I don't read books
I don't french cook
Or stroll around in galleries
I hate opera
I hate Oprah
Don't fill my head with poetry

You just want to squeeze my masculinity
Why can't you leave it alone
Hey, hey I ain't gonna change
Hey, hey don't you love it this way
Hey, hey I am what I am
So please understand
I'm not you fantasy man

I don't do dishes
And I'm suspicious
Of any grown-up man who does
I'm homophobic
Don't do aerobics
Just lay around and catch a buzz

You just want to squeeze my masculinity
Why can't you leave it alone
Hey, hey I ain't gonna change
Hey, hey don't you love it this way
Hey, hey I am what I am
So please understand
I'm not you fantasy man

Hey, hey I ain't gonna change
Hey, hey don't you love me this way
Hey, hey I am what I am
So please understand
I'm not your fantasy man

You just want to squeeze my masculinity
Why can't you leave it alone
Hey, hey I ain't gonna change
Hey, hey don't you love it this way
Hey, hey I am what I am
So please understand
I'm not you fantasy man
