There it stands way up high
A million bodies piled to the sky
Arms and legs, feet and hands
Impossible to understand

Countless heads, ears and eyes
Never hear, never cry
Tribal chants, tribal war
Tribal death, tribal gore

And the scaveggers are feeding
Cuz the killing fields are bleeding
Not a single soul is breathing
Cuz the Serengetti's bleedin'
And the scaveggers are feeding
Cuz the killing fields are bleeding
Not a single soul is breathing
Cuz the Serengetti's bleedin'

Listen somewhere in the jungle
You can hear the devil laughing
Somewhere

African genucide
Brother kill brother
Side by side
Wild animals show their teeth
And run away in disbelief

And the scaveggers are feeding
Cuz the killing fields are bleeding
Not a single soul is breathing
Cuz the Serengetti's bleedin'
And the scaveggers are feeding
Cuz the killing fields are bleeding

Listen somewhere in the jungle
You can hear the devil laughing
Somewhere

Somewhere the rivers will flow with blood
The mothers will cry their tears
They watch their sons die

Listen somewhere in the jungle
You can hear the devil laughing
Somewhere

Listen somewhere in the jungle
You can hear the devil laughing
Somewhere

Listen somewhere in the jungle
You can hear the devil laughing
Somewhere

Cuz the Serengetti's bleedin'
Listen somewhere in the jungle
You can hear the devil laughing
Somewhere

Somewhere the rivers will flow with blood
The mothers will cry their tears
They watch their sons die
