Now I don't know but I've been told
There's a nun having fun and she lost her soul
She's got cash, she got laid
Now she's dealin' with me and she's gonna get paid
She got caught with the bishop
She got caught with the abbot
Even cardinal sin tried to feed her habit

Now we get whores and pimps and skanks
But when your judgement came down even
He gave thanks

Whatever happened to me
Can't remember my name
Flying so high on angelic wings
Flew too close to the flame

Sister Sara
It's your penalty for eternity
Did you think that you were saved
You forget your old identity who you used to be
Sister Sara
So depraved
Moment to moment
Hour to hour
We'll be together

Oh, come O ye faithless
Get in line
You're gonna drown in the water
Turned to wine
And you're all going to wallow
When you sin and shame
You had every opportunity to call His name
Don't look surprised
Don't be in shock
You'll be a lovely little demon in my private stock
I'm just doing my job to pull you down
Cuz it's a one way ticket down to Dragontown
You got caught in my web
You made your own bed here
And now you must keep me well fed
You're mine
Too bad
You're here for me
You're just here for me

Sister Sara
It's your penalty for eternity
Did you think that you were saved
You forget your old identity who you used to be
Sister Sara
So depraved
Moment to moment
Hour to hour
We'll be together

Moment to moment
Hour to hour
Forever and ever
Time after time after time

Sister Sara
It's your penalty for eternity
Did you think that you were saved
You forget your old identity who you used to be
Sister Sara
So depraved
Moment to moment
Hour to hour
We'll be together
