I ain't got a name
I don't gotta face
No fingerprints or DNA
I ain't got no eyes
I don't got a tongue
But I know what's going on
I'm deaf and dumb
I'm pure non-entity
Don't even look for me
I watch you when you sleep

I am the triggerman
I am the underhand
I'll keep you on your knees
I am the brain police
I am the triggerman
I am the underhand
I'm full of dirty tricks
I'm twice as smart and
Certainly twice as sick

I am always out of sight
A shadow in the mist
I don't need no alibi, cos
I don't exist
I'm pure non-entity
Don't even look for me
I watch you when you sleep

I am the triggerman
I am the underhand
I'll keep you on your knees
I am the brain police
I am the triggerman
I am the underhand
I'm full of dirty tricks
I'm twice as smart and
Certainly twice as sick

He's sick, he's sick, he's really, really sick
He's sick, he's sick, he's really, really sick
