We must complete the trip
Try not to lose your grip
No sight of solid ground and never look straight down
Deeper, deeper, deeper, deeper your claustrophobic brain
Sucking you down the drain
The walls are closing in
The air is getting thin

The elevator broke
It went right through the floor
It left a burning hole
Down and down and down  we go
We're in a deadly spin
Hating this spin we're in
We're helpless
Panic grows
Down and down and down  we go
Daylight is at an end
You'll never see again
You'll soon embrace the sight
This cold eternal light
