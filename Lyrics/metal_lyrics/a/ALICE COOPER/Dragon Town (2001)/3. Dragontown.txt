Well, here you are
Lying bleeding on a grimy street
See the broken glass sparkling darkly
As it cuts your feet
Smell the rottingy stench
The rancid odor of old cantonese
Reflections of the shattered dreams
Feel the toxic flames all around you
You can hardly breathe
Come with  me

Come on. I've got something to show you
Come on. You thought that it was over
Come on. You're really gonna love this
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

We can dig you a hole deep in the ground
Bury your soul down in Dragontown
We'll he lower than low
Spiralin' down
Far as you want to go down
In Dragontown

Open any door
Remember everyone you met before
Oh. There's a wicked young man
Cooking slowly the frying pan
And the family of bones are back together sleeping all alone
Then there's Alice, dear
And all the little things that got him here
Now you're here
Come on. I've got something to show you
Come on. You thought that it was over
Come on. You're really gonna love this
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

We can dig you a hole deep in the ground
Bury your soul down in Dragontown
We'll he lower than toll
Spiralin' down
Far as you want to go down
In Dragontown

We can dig you a hole deep in the ground
Bury your soul down in Dragontown
We'll he lower than toll
Spiralin' down
Far as you want to go down
In Dragontown

We can dig you a hole deep in the ground
Bury your soul down in Dragontown
We'll he lower than toll
Spiralin' down
Far as you want to go down
In Dragontown
