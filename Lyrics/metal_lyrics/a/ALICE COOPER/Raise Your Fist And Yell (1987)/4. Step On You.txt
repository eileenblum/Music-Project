You're in my way
You crossed my line
You're in my face
You're on my case
Don't like your style
Don't like your sound
You talk too much
You got no touch, you drive it in the ground
I'm gonna step on you
I'm gonna step on you
I'm gonna step on you
I'm gonna step on you
Don't like your smile
Don't like your clothes
Don't like your hair
And I don't care about your ruby pierced nose
You push too far
You talk too loud
You stay too long
You're in my song but you ain't in my crowd
I'm gonna step on you
I'm gonna step on you
I'm gonna step on you
I'm gonna step on you
You ruin my day and you're wrecking my night
I'm biting my lips because I'm ready to fight
I'm gonna sharpen my spikes
I'm gonna strap on my boots
I'm gonna squash you on sight
I'm gonna step on you
Step-step-step-step
You ruin my day and you're wrecking my night
I'm biting my lips because I'm ready to fight
I'm gonna sharpen my spikes
I'm gonna strap on my boots
I'm gonna squash you on sight
Don't leve no message on my telephone
Cut right through the bull, right to the bone
The snow in your nose and the crack in your brain
It used to be cool, now it's just insane
I'm gonna step on you
Step-I'm gonna step on you-step
Step!
