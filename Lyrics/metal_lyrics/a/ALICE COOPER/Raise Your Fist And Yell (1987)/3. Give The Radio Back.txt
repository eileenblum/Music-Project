Hey teacher, what are you trying to do?
I'm getting tired of livin' in this zoo
You slap me in the face and you knock me down
You beat my head right in to the ground
I've never felt this way before
I can't take it no more
So give the radio back
Yeah, give the radio back
Give the radio back to the maniacs
Well, there's a party going on outside
All my friends got ya terrified
Don't call no cops or the state police
Don't break up this blown out symphony
You think I'm wasting all my precious time
You say my music outta be a crime
Well, give the radio back
Give the radio back
Yeah, give the radio back to the maniacs
To the maniacs
I never ever felt this way before
Ain't gonna take it no more
Yeah, give the radio
Give the radio back
Give the radio back to the maniacs
To the maniacs
Yeah, give the radio to the maniacs
Give the radio to the maniacs
Give it, give it, give the radio
To the maniacs
The little maniacs, you'll all maniacs
