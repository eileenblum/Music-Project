Well, I was born on a dead end street I'm cold blooded but I always felt the heat.
All my friend are dead and gone
If there's a hell, I'm one step closer to it
Somewhere I crossed the line
Somewhere I'm lost in time
I lost my soul and now I'm losing my min
Time to kill
I've had enough of all your lies
I've only got time to kill
I've seen the fire in my eyes
I've only got time to kill
I spend my days counting bricks on the wall
And every night I hear those sirens call
I sink deeper into a convict's sleep
And dream about the day I'm gonna hit the streets
One time I cursed the man
He laughed and broke my hand
I'm gonna take that fist and make him understand
I'll make him understand
I've had enough of long goodbyes
I've only got time to kill
I feel the fire in my eyes
I've only got time to kill
Y'know I always thought there was time enough
To win the game
But now I know times are rough
The seasons changed, times are strange
Somewhere I crossed the line
Somewhere I'm lost in time
I lost my soul and now I'm losing my mind
Time to kill
I've had enough of all your lies
I've only got time to kill
I've seen the fire in my eyes
I've only got time to kill
I've had enough of long goodbyes
I've only got time to kill
I feel the fire in my eyes
I've only got time to kill
