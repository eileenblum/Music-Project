An angel fell one stormy night
From heaven's glory
He split the earth to reign in hell
He fears the light
He fears the truth
He hears what's going to be
He spits on life
He spits on God
He spits up death for you and me
[CHORUS]
Prince of darkness
Study's the world with hungry eyes
Prince of darkness
Ready to baptize you in lies
Heart of evil, Soul of blackness
Prince of darkness
He saw that man was just a boy
With a baby's mind
He swore damnation to God's creation
He lives for hate
He lives for tears
He lives up to his name
He knew the light
He knew the one
Who was crucified in pain
[CHORUS]
Heart of evil, Soul of blackness
He fears the light
He fears the truth
He fears what's going to be
He spits on life
He spits on God
He spits up death for you and me
[CHORUS]
Prince of darkness
He smells the breath
Of sweet human sin
And deeply breathes it in
Prince of darkness
