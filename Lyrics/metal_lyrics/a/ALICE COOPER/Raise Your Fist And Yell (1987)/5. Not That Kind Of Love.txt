Hello, my little pretty
My, don't we look YUK
Come here!

You spend all day picking out your dress
I like you dirty when your hair is a mess
You smell so sweet walking in the room
You don't have to try so hard to drown me in perfume

Don't cry your heart out
Don't tell your preacher
Don't get ideas, this won't last forever
Just want to touch you
Just want to feel you
Just want to taste you
I never wanted, I never wanted love before
I never wanted, I never wanted love before

Not that kind of love
Not that kind of love
No, it's not that kind of love
It's not that kind of love
No, it's not that kind of love

I don't want know your Dad or Mom
I won't be calling you to go to the prom
If you want to go, some cheap motel
You can pick me up at eight, I'll never tell

Don't cry your heart out
Don't tell your preacher
Don't get ideas, this won't last forever
Just want to touch you
Just want to feel you
Just want to taste you
I never wanted, I never wanted love before
I never wanted, I never wanted love before

Not that kind of love, not that kind of love
Not that kind of love, not that kind of love
No, no, not that kind of love
Not that kind of love, not that kind of love
