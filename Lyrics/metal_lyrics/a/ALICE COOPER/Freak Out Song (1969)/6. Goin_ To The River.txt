Well I'm goin' to the river gonna jump overboard and drown
Yes I'm goin' to the river gonna jump overboard and drown
Because the girl I love she's gone and leave his down
Now when she left me I bowed my head and cried
When she left me I bowed my head and cried
I never thought I'd be I would be the one to cry
So if you see my baby tell her tell her goodbye for me
If you see my baby tell her tell her goodbye for me
'cause I'm tired of livin' livin' in misery
Yes I'm goin' to the river gonna jump overboard and drown
Yes I'm goin' to the river gonna jump overboard and drown
Because the girl I love she's gone and leave his down
Now when she left me I bowed my head and cried
When she left me I bowed my head and cried
I never thought I'd be I would be the one to cry
So if you see my baby tell her tell her goodbye for me
If you see my baby tell her tell her goodbye for me
'cause I'm tired of livin' livin' livin' in misery
That's why I'm goin' to the river gonna jump overboard and drown
Yes I'm goin' to the river gonna jump overboard and drown
Because the girl I love she's gone and leave his down
