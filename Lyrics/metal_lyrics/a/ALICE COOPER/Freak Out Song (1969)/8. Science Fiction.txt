Forever I'll enjoy you underachievement
I'm gonna see you every day now if I can
Why then don't the night show really matters
I still wake on the fields of regret
There is something to this dream we're all involved in
Oh can I see it can I say it may exist
Rest me hide my years around the planet
If we dwell in the fields of regret
I still wake up in the fields of regret
There is something to this dream we're all involved in
Oh can I see it can I say it may exist
Rest me hide my years around the planet
If we dwell in the fields of regret
What horror must invade the mind
When the approaching judge shall find
What sinful deeds from all mankind
With death and nature in surprise
Behold the wretched sinners rise
To meet the judge's searching eyes
And when the doomed no more can flee
From the flames of misery assist me while I die
Wander through those ever thoughts though if imagined
But come down on it's so easy to resist
Rest me hide my years around the planet
Sound another no part over won't forget
When we laugh at the fields of regret
