Nobody likes me
It's all my fault
Nobody likes me
Nobody likes me

Oh yes we all like you
We like you a lot
Yes we all like you
Yes we all like you

I never get a letter
We have no time
Never ever get a call from you
I have no dime

Oh yes you do
Oh no we don't [x3]
Yes! No! Yes! No! [etc.]

Never call, never write
Yes I do always try
Make me cry all the night
Sorry I made you cry
Make me mad, make me sad
Tell me true, what can I do?

Way too late can't make up
All the hate has built up
Ha ha ha ha ah

Right we all hate you
We hate you a lot
We hate all your family
We hate your dog Spot
Even Spot?
Yes
