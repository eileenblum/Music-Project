[From "Love It To Death" Album (1971)]

Lines form on my face and hands lines form from the ups and downs
I'm in the middle without any plans I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I don't know what I want eighteen I just don't know what I want
Eighteen I gotta get away I gotta get out of this place I'll go runnin' in outer space oh yeah
I got a baby's brain and an old man's heart took eighteen years to get this far
Don't always know what I'm talkin' about feels like I'm livin' in the middle of doubt
'cause I'm eighteen I get confused every day eighteen I just don't know what to say eighteen I gotta get away
Whoa lines form on my face and my hands lines form on the left and right
I'm in the middle the middle of life I'm a boy and I'm a man
I'm eighteen and I like it yes I like it oh I like it love it like it love it
Eighteen eighteen eighteen eighteen and I like it
