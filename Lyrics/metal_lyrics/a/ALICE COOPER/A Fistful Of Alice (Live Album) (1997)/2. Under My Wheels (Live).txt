[From "Killer" Album (1971)]

The telephone is ringing you got me on the run I'm driving in my car now anticipating fun
I'm driving right up to you babe I guess that you couldn't see yeah yeah
But you were under my wheels why don't you let me be
'cause when you call me on the telephone saying take me to the show
And then I say honey I just can't go old lady's sick and I can't leave her home
The telephone is ringing you got me on the run I'm driving in my car now
I got you under my wheels I got you under my wheels I got you under my wheels
Got you under my wheels yeah yeah I got you under my wheels
Aah the telephone is ringing you got me on the run I'm driving in my car now anticipating fun
I'm driving right up to you babe I guess that you couldn't see yeah yeah
But you were under my wheels why don't you let me be
Yeah yeah got you under my wheels yeah yeah I got you under my wheels
I got you under my wheels got you got you got you got you
Under my wheels got you under my wheels wheels wheels wheels
