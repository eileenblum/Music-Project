Hey you!
Fighting for your life where you've never fought before Hey you!
Running from the scene and nailing down your door Oh yeah!
Back 'em off, brother

Terminate the mother now
You know you gotta get hard
The world needs guts
The world needs power
Show me some blood
Show me some cuts
Show me some scars
The world needs guts
The world needs us
Hey you!
Crying 'cause your best friend's splattered against the wall Hey you!
Some maniac butcher's tryin' to hack away your balls Oh yeah!
Back 'em off, brother
Oh yeah!
Terminate the mother now
You know you gotta get hard
The world needs guts
The world needs power
Show me some blood
Show me some cuts
Show me some scars
The world needs guts
The world needs us
Hey, hey, what's in your eyes? I think I'm getting through
Say, say that you despise the things they did to you
Pray, pray some day their throats are in your hands
Take them, shake them 'til they understand
The world needs guts
The world needs power
Show me some blood
Show me some cuts
Show me some scars
The world needs guts
The world needs us
Hey you!
You gonna let some scumbag stab you in the back Hey you!
Turn around kicking and rearrange your sack

Back 'em off, brother
Oh yeah!
Terminate the mother now
You know you gotta get hard
The world needs guts
The world needs power
Show me some blood
Show me some cuts
Show me some scars
The world needs guts
The world needs us
