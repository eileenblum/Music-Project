Tie you up baby, really tight
In a lover's knot
I'm in the mood for my leather boots
With the leopard spots

Take you down to my side of town
Where I learned to love
Strap you down, honey
Pet you nice with my velvet glove

You dial my number
So let me take the lead
I'm the man, understand
With the smooth slight of hand
And all the magic you need

T-t-t-t-t trick bag, sit back and just enjoy the show
Burn you with desire
Trick bag, come on and let your body go
Gonna lay it on thick
So the memory'll stick

Chew me up with your perfect mouth
Don't you spit me out
Teach you good, Little Miss Hollywood
What it's all about

You call me up baby, in the middle of the night
You say you're sweating red
And you're dripping on the bed
T-tripping in the moonlight

T-t-t-t-t trick bag, sit back and just enjoy the show
Burn you with desire
Trick bag, come on and let your body go
Gonna lay it on thick
So the memory'll stick
