We're gonna have a bash and we're glad you finally got here
Coz we're already trashed and the band is really hot here
We're gonna dance our heads off and we're gonna keep it tight
If we keep ourselves together we might make it through the night

Ghouls gone wild, wilder than before
We had a little taste and now we need a little more
Ghouls gone wild, screaming in the night
We're feeling kinda hungry and we came in for a bite
Ghouls... Ghouls....

We're gonna raise some hell yeah, we're gonna rock and roll here
And my sulphur that you smell well it adds a little soul here
We're dancing on your grave and we're dancing in the street
We're dancing through the fire and it's burning up our feet (burning up our feet)

Ghouls gone wild, wilder than before
We had a little taste and now we need a little more
Ghouls gone wild, screaming in the night
We're feeling kinda hungry and we came in for a bite
Ghouls... Ghouls....

So exciting when we're biting
Come on and play, whatdaya say

Ghouls gone wild, wilder than before
We had a little taste and now we need a little more
Ghouls gone wild, screaming in the night
We're feeling kinda hungry and we came in for a bite
Ghouls... Ghouls.... Ghouls... Ghouls.... Ghouls.... Ghouls....
