Daddy wants to take me for a ride
Daddy likes to drink when daddy drives
He's pounding on my door
He wants to come inside
Yeah daddy wants to take me for a ride

That's just the way it is, when I'm left alone
Yeah that's when hell comes home

Mommy says that everything is fine
Mommy hides her bruises all the time
She always makes excuses but I know that she is lyin'
Mommy says that everything is fine

That's just the way it is, he's evil to the bone
Mommy says that everything is fine
That's just the way it is, when we're left alone
Coz that's when hell comes home

I hear those footsteps on the stairs
Mom's bleeding out or maybe she don't care
We live in darkness and despair
I'm just so tired of being scared

(Daddy's home.. Get out my way... Gimme the bottle.. Steven... Steven... STEVEN... )

(no... no... no....)
Daddy's gonna get a big surprise
I'll put one right between his eyes
And in his blood I'll write his last goodbyes
Yeah daddy's gonna get a big surprise

That just the way it is, he'll be deader then a stone
That's just the way it is, he'll leave us both alone
That's just the way it is when hell comes home
Home....
