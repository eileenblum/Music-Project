She was a dirty dream, cool and clean
With seduction dancing in her eyes
She turned around, looked me up and down
She took me by surprise

I tried to run, tried to hide
But my feet were made of clay
Looked in her eyes, I was paralyzed
I just couldnât get away

She licked her lips, they were bloody red
She had the heart of the living dead
She pushed me down on a burning bed
Thought I was in heaven, but instead
She turned her head and she softly said

Iâll bite your face off
Iâll bite your face off
Iâll bite your face off â little man
Iâll bite your face off â you know that I can

She put the whip into cream
She was a sinnerâs queen, oh a delicious angel face
Sheâd invite you in, câmon and lick my skin
Youâd sell your soul for another taste

She took my heart, my resistance fled
I loved each lie that I was fed
She pushed me down on a burning bed
Thought I was in heaven, but instead
She turned her head and she softly said

Iâll bite your face off
Iâll bite your face off
Iâll bite your face off â little man
Iâll bite your face off â you know that I can

She pushed me down on a burning bed
Thought I was in heaven, but instead
She turned her head and she softly said

Iâll bite your face off
Iâll bite your face off
Iâll bite your face off â little man
Iâll bite your face off â you know that I can
Iâll bite your face off
Iâll bite your face off
Iâll bite your face off
Iâll bite your face off
