[Announcer:] All aboard. Watch your step people. Last call for the nightmare express hahahaha

I found myself slipping away
Just this side of dead
I woke up in a box car
I wasn't in my bed
I found my leg chained to a spike
That ran down through the floor
Attached to thirteen angry men
All rotten to the core
But I'm innocent I cried right out
I'm in someone else's dream
They looked around and laughed out loud
Said "Brother, so are we"
"Yeah brother, so are we"

But I'm a big celebrity
Known all round the land
"Well buddy you ain't no one here
Man, you ain't in demand"
Speeding t'wards a flaming wall
Like a screaming sonic boom
I really gotta wake up now
Or I may meet my doom oh lord,
I may meet my doom

So all that I remember
Is how much my body hurt
Now I'm sleeping in the graveyard
On the wrong side of the dirt
Yeah I'm on the wrong side of the dirt
Wrong side of the dirt, don`t you know
I'm on the wrong side of the dirt
