[feat. Ke$ha]She gonna come for you
And you can try to run and hide
No matter what you do
She gonna take it deep inside
You're thinking this could be a dream come true
But you don't really understand
She feeds on flesh and blood and boys like you
She gonna make you be a man

She'll take your bleeding heart and your soul, no regrets
Coz what baby wants (What baby wants wants wants)
Baby gets (She's gonna gonna gonna get)
What baby wants (What baby wants wants wants)
Baby gets (She's gonna gonna gonna get)

[The Devil:] I gotta pretty face
[Steven:] Yeah but I've seen what's hiding underneath
[The Devil:] You like my pretty mouth
[Steven:] But you got razor blades instead of teeth
[The Devil:] And now its too too late for you
[Steven:] Oh yeah tell me what you gonna do
[The Devil:] I'm gonna drain your veins and bathe in your blood
[Steven:] Honey I seen worse then you
[The Devil:] I'll make you sit, beg, roll over, play dead
[Steven:] Ain't gonna be your little pet
[The Devil:] Oh really...

What baby wants (What baby wants wants wants)
Baby gets (She's gonna gonna gonna get)
Yeah what baby wants (What baby wants wants wants)
Baby gets (She's gonna gonna gonna get)

Bay tells lies, Baby looks you in the eyes
It's her aphrodisiac, when she stabs you in the back
She comes on like a saint but that's exactly what she ain't
Not a damsel in distress, she's the devil in a dress
She's gonna stay with you
She's gonna play with you
It's one thing you can bet

Coz what baby wants (What baby wants wants wants)
Baby gets (She's gonna gonna gonna get)
Yeah what baby wants (What baby wants wants wants)
Baby gets (She's gonna gonna gonna get)

[The Devil/Steven:] I'll make you sit, beg, roll over, play dead. I'm gonna be your little pet

Coz what baby wants (What baby wants wants wants)
Baby gets (She's gonna gonna gonna get)
Yeah what baby wants (What baby wants wants wants)
Baby gets (She's gonna gonna gonna get)
Coz what baby wants (What baby wants wants wants)
Baby gets (She's gonna gonna gonna get)
Yeah what baby wants (What baby wants wants wants)
Baby gets (She's gonna gonna gonna get)

What baby wants, baby gets
