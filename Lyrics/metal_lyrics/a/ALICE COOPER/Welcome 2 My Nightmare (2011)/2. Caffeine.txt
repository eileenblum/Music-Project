I gotta stay awake
I just can`t sleep
Becasue I know inside if I close my eyes
it will be the death of me

Because I feel the night
When the darkness creeps
that`s when the shadows fry
that's when I must survive
cause every night they come for me

I'm shaking in the ice cold shower
I been for here for about a week
But if I leave I could doze for hours
and that will surely be the end of a coward like me

Caffeine! Caffeine!
Amphetamine
A little speed is all I need
Caffeine! Caffeine!
woo woo woo

I wont sleep at night
I won`t rest my head
Because I realise if I shut my eyes I'm gonna wake up dead
I'm in a desperate way
I'm very near the end
And all I know's a triple shot of joe is my only friend

I'm shaking in the ice cold shower
I been for here for about a week
But if I leave I could doze for hours
and that will surely be the end of a coward like me

Caffeine! Caffeine!
Amphetamine
A little speed is all I need
Caffeine! Caffeine!
woo woo woo
woo woo woo

[Middle Break]

Caffeine! Caffeine!
Amphetamine
A little speed is all I need
Caffeine! Caffeine!

Caffeine! Caffeine!
Amphetamine
A little speed is all I need
Caffeine! Caffeine!

Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme [etc to fade]
