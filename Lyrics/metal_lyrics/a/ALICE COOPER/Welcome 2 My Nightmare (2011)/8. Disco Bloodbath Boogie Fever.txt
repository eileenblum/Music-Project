Yo Yo Yo, Yooooo
Yo Yo Yo, Yooooo

Here you are in the club, with your bottle full of bub [short for 'bubbly', slang for champagne]
You've got grill, you got bling but player you don't know a thing
Put your hands in the air, stick 'em up like you don't care
Face the wall, count to ten, we mow you down, reload again

Oh no, here we go

Disco who, disco what
Get down on your knees, and keep your trap shut
Disco this, disco that
When disc-gos to hell, that's where we're at, where we're at

Yo Yo Yo, Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Yo Yo Yo, Whoa-oh-oh-oh

Disco Bloodbath
(Disco Bloodbath Boogie Fever )
Boogie Fever
(Disco Bloodbath Boogie Fever)
Disco Bloodbath
(Disco Bloodbath Boogie Fever)
Boogie Fever
(Disco Bloodbath Boogie Fever)

Bodies here, bodies there, piles of bodies everywhere
On the chairs, on the door, disco bloodbath on the floor
Hear them yell, hear them scream, just like someone's scary dream
Dig a hole, push 'em in, tomorrow they'll be back again

Oh no, here we go

Disco who, disco what
Get down on your knees, and keep your trap shut
Disco this, disco that
When disc-gos to hell, that's where we're at, where we're at

Yo Yo Yo, Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Yo Yo Yo, Whoa-oh-oh-oh

We cleaned the house tonight (We cleaned the house tonight)
We did our job (We did our job it's alright)
We turned out all the lights okay

We were sent to let them know (I think you really let 'em know)
It was time to let them go (you know they really had to go)
Coz we're the ones who close the show okay
