In the beginning I was just a shadow
In the beginning I was alone
In the beginning I was blind, living in a world devoid of light
In the beginning there was only night

I was shattered, left in pieces
And I felt so cold inside
Then I called you from the darkness
Where I hide

I am made of you
I am made of you
I am made of you
I am made of you

In the beginning you were revelation
A river of salvation and now I believe

All I wanted, all I needed
Was someone to rescue me
I was drowning, I was dying
Now I'm free

I am made of you
I am made of you
I am made of you
I am made of you

Here I am now, I can stand now
Cause your love has made me strong
And forever you're the singer
I'm the song

I am made of you
I am made of you
I am made of you
I am made of you

I am made of you
I am made of you
I am made of you
I am made of you
