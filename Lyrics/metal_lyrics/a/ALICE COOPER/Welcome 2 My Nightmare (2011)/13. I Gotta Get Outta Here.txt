I can`t wait to wake up in my very own bed
Far away from the madness and my pounding head
The shiver up my spine and this feeling of dread

Well first I finally passed out, then I woke up in pain
Tangled in the wreckage of a runaway train
Was I the last man on earth or was I just insane

I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get outta here
I gotta, gotta get outta here
I'm getting the message, it's totally clear
Yeah I really gotta get out of here

I danced at a disco where the bodies all fell
Piled up to the sky, what a sulphurous smell
Man, the ghouls on the beach they were hotter than hell
(Yeah yeah yeah)

I popped the old man, put a hole in his eye
Spent the night with the devil, she was such a bad guy
And if he has her way I will eternally fry

I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get outta here
I gotta, gotta get outta here
It's not complicated, yeah it's pretty damn clear
I really gotta get outta here

Just wanna be myself again and find my way out of this iniquitous den
I ain't having fun and I ain't making friends
I don't wanna know how this nightmare ends

I don`t know why I'm here, why I've fallen from grace
I can't explain the burns, or the scars on my face
Somebody please wake me up and get me outta this place
(Yeah yeah yeah)

I said I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta get outta here
I gotta, gotta get outta here
They say isn't the message clear to you yet, sonny
