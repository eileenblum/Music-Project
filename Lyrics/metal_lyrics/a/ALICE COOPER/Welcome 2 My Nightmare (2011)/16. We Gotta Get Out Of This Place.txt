[Bonus Track]In this dirty old part of the city
Where the sun refused to shine
People tell me there ain't no use in tryin'

Now lil girl you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is due, I know

See my daddy in bed, he's dyin'
Yeah his hair been turnin' grey
He been workin' and slavin' his life away
I know

We gotta work, yeah
Work yeah
Work yeah
We gotta work, work, work, work

We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
Girl, there's a better life for me and you
I know it's true

My little girl you're so young and pretty
And one thing I know is true
You'll be dead before your time is through, I know

Watching my daddy in bed he's dyin'
You know his hair been turnin' grey
He's been slavin' and workin' his life away
Yeah I know
That we gotta work, yeah
Work
Gotta Work
We gotta work, work, work, work

We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
Girl, there's a better life for me and you

We gotta get out of this place
If it's the last thing we ever do
We gotta get out of this place
Girl, there's a better life for me and you
And you know it's true
