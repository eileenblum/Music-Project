Baby, I wanna tell you something
Just a word and it's no lie
I got so much feeling in side of me
Baby, our love will last forever
Through the changes of the heart
Through the lonely nights whenever we're far apart

Before we say goodbye
All I wanna say is I......

I just wanna give you something to remember me by
Something that lasts forever
Coz our love is for all time

Baby, I may be gone tomorrow
But I'm here with you tonight
I'll be holding you 'till morning light
And baby I'm gonna watch you wake up
Scattered clothes across the floor
And hear you whisper to me "love me again once more"

Before we say goodbye
All I wanna say is I....

I just wanna give you something to remember me by
I won`t be gone forever
And our love is for all time
I wanna give you something to remember me by

Something to remember further on down the line
Something to remember me by
Bye bye
