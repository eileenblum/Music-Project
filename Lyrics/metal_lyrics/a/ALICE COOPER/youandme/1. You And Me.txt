When I got home from work
I wanna wrap myself around you
I wanna take you and squeeze you
'till the passion starts to rise.

I wanna take you to heaven
that would make my day complete
but you and me ain't movie stars
what we are is what we are
we share a bed some lovin' and t.v. yeah.

That's enough for a workin' man
what I am is what I am
and I tell you babe
well that's enough for me.

Sometimes when you're asleep and
I'm just starin' at the ceiling
I wanna reach out and touch you
but you just go on dreamin'.

If I could take you to heaven
that would make my day complete
but you and me ain't movie stars
what we are is what we are
and I tell you babe
well that's enough for me.

You and me ain't no superstars
what we are is what we are
we share a bed some popcorn and t.v. yeah.

And that's enough for a workin' man
what I am is what I am
and I tell you babe
well that's enough for me.

When I got home from work
I wanna wrap myself around you
I like to hold you and squeeze you
'till the passion starts to rise.

I wanna take you to heaven
that would make my day complete ...
