Oh four years long and oh what a sigh to hear my dear
Four long years now we stop to hear a whisper Alice Cooper
All of the time we have all of the time we have you
All of the time we have all of the time we have
We are throwing all of our hands so high you out there
Singing lovely dittie beautiful song for you to be aware
All of the time we have all of the time we have you
All of the time we have all of the time we have all of the time we have you
You're the one you're looking for let me in let me in
Who's there who's there who's there
