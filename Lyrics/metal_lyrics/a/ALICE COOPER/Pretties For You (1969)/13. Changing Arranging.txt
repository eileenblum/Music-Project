Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah ooh ooh ooh ooh
I'm changing arranging things I never thought I'd move before
I'm changing oh arranging to your personality I asked for it before
I need a soul who never say what I feel just fearing that I will accept the ideal
I lick the pie and I sweat all I see it's a carbon copy image of me
I'm dying had trying baby baby for the rest of my life
I'm trying had dying maybe maybe he's trying to be my life
I've got a never ending battle inside just trying to rectify my personal pride
I swear I don't know what it's got over me but I know it doesn't want to be free
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
