Living is only one part of being
Believing is to know just what you're feeling
You weren't supposed to think you know you heard
I'm sure that you're knowing you're growing and it's you
Thinking is your own world of living
Dreaming is the one way to feeling
Your wind and your eye can see everything that you
The only real person you need to know is you
Aah aah aah aah ooh living living living
