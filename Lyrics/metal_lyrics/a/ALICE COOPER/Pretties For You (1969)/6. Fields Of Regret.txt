Forever I'll enjoy you undertaking come to see you every day now if I can
Is it not the time for everybody I still wake on the fields of regret
There is something to this dream we're all involved in can I see it can I say it may exist
Why then don't the night show really matters if we dwell in the fields of regret
What horror must invade the mind when the approaching judge shall find sinful deeds from all mankind
With death and nature in surprise behold the wretched sinners rise to meet the judge's searching eyes
And when the doomed no more can flee from the flames of misery assist me while I die
Wander through those ever thoughts though if imagined but come down on it's so easy to resist
Rest me hide my years upon the planet sound another no part over won't forget
When we laugh at the fields of regret
