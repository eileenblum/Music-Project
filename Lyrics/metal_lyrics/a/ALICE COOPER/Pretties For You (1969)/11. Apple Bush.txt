October in a land that's in my back yard there's a people who succeed they don't try hard
Well they've found a way to live with ease eating from the bush instead of the tree
Apple bush apple tree back to eternity find you a path and you buy with a car
Apple bush apple tree back to eternity cut you a path with a chance you may fall
Move over in a corner standing there tell my house they have to see it again
But my house doesn't worry it's got a path of its own and a bush and a tree gotta leave it alone
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Apple bush apple tree back to eternity find you a path and you buy with a car
Apple bush apple tree back to eternity cut you a path with a chance you may fall
Someday like my house you're going to chose too ooh if you cut this new path well the old one will do
If you live with the people who live with ease ooh the red apple bush the blue apple trees ooh
