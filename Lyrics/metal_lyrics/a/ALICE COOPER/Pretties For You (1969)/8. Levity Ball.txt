I got my invitation to the annual levity ball
Seeing the location is within the mirrored room
Walking in my room I found I had nothing to find
I got into my evening wear and left my clothes behind
I sat down on the stairway seven hours at a time
Writing all of this poetry that I knewq would never rhyme
The memory I knew I must have had when I came in
Was of some varied places where I've never ever been
And then in came a cake all decorated in my name
With four paper brown candles are all spelling out this name
The clock was passing out from time to time I saw it all
The beginning of the ending of my first levity ball
