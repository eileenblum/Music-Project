I slipped into my jeans lookin' hard and feelin' mean
I took a spit at the moon it's all in this luney tune
Just a little insane a couple of shots I can't feel no pain
Hey where have I been and who are these scary men
Is this all real is this all necessary or it this a joke
Many know I don't regret at all 
They locked me up for good pinned me against the wall
I can't find the exit I quit lookin' for doors
I stole a razor from the commissary I just couldn't take it no more
I'm swimmin' in blood like a rat on a sewer floor
No longer insane just part of this crazy dream
