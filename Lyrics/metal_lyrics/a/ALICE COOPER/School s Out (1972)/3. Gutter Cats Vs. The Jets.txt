I met an alley cat pussyfootin' around 'till the break of dawn
Found me knocked out flat on my head
Some feline beauty waved her tail my way 
I just had to stay I couldn't get the blood off my hands
She made my eyes bug out her tail stand up
And I ain't even in heat for a month meow
House cat you really got it made
Sleepin' all night and perfect delight of day
Some feline beauty waved her tail my way
I just had to stay I couldn't get the blood off my bed
She made my eyes bug out her tail stand up
And I ain't even in heat for a month meow
Some bad cats from fourth street come down to our alley
Well we say that's cool but just stay away from me and my boys
Eyes clash and claws slash and green eyed fur goes flyin'
Midnight cat fight neck bite die
When you're a jet you're a jet all the way
&gt;From your first cigarette till your last dyin' day
When you're a jet let 'em do what they can
Little boy you got friends you're a family man
The jets are in gear they're always well respected
You're never alone when company's expected you're well protected
Here come the jets like a bat out of hell
Someone gets in our way someone don't feel so well
When you're a jet you stay a jet wow
