Rain is falling down my cheek searching for the sea
Tomorrow like the rain I'll be back home again
I watch the bus as it pulls out of view
Someday like that bus I will be leavin' too
But you know it breaks my heart to leave you camelback my high school
And now alone cryin' in my beer
'cause old friends said goodbye I guess I'll be leavin' too
But you know it breaks my heart to leave you Cortez I'll miss you
Yes I will yes I will you know I will
Yes I will yes I will you know I will
Well so long so long everybody everybody I hope that I would see you again again
Goodbye goodbye everybody everybody I finally grew up they finally let me out of school
Hey remember the time remember the time
We took that snake and we we put it down little Betsy's dress
Now I don't think Miss Axelrod was much impressed
Now I don't think Miss Axelrod was much impressed
Well I don't think Miss Axelrod was much impressed
Oh goodbye goodbye everybody everybody I hope that I would see you again again
So long so long everybody everybody
