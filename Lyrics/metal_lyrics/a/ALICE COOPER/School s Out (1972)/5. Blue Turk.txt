I'm lazy you know it I'm ready for the second show
Amazing thing growing just waitin for the juice to flow
But you're so very picturesque you're so very cold
Tastes like roses on your breath but graveyards on your soul
I'm hurting I'm wanting I'm aching for another go
You're squirming wet baby nothing bad comin' very slow
And it's burning holes in me
You're so very picturesque you're so very cold
It tastes like roses on your breath but graveyards on your soul whoa hmm
One spastic explosion two pressure cookers go insane
It makes me act crazy I shiver but I love this game
You're so very ordinary you're so very lame
Tastes like whiskey on your lips and earthworms rule your brain
