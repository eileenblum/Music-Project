Please clean your plate, dear, The lord above can see ya
Don't you know people are starving in Korea?
Alcohol and razorblades and poison and needles
Kindergarten people, they used 'em they need 'em
The over- indulgent machines were their children
There wasn't a way down on earth here to cool 'em
'Cause they looked just like humans at Kresges and Woolworth
But decadent brains were at work to destroy
Brats in battalions were ruling the streets saying
"Generation Landslide close the gap between 'em"
And i laugh to myself every man and the ladies
Who never could see those billions dollar babies

Militant mothers, hiding in the basement
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets
Molotov milk bottles heaved from pink high-chairs
While mothers limp burned, with certificate papers
Dad gets allowance from his sonny the dealer
Who's pubic to the world, but involved in high finance
Sister's out 'til five doing banker's son's hours
But she owns a Maserati, that's a gift from his father
Stop at full speed at one hundred miles per hour
The Colgate invisible shield finally got 'em
And I laugh to myself every man and the ladies
Who never could see those billion dollar babies
