Beautiful flyaway somewhere like holy days wonder what brought me down to earth 
Haven't I always been here let's have another nibble later I think I'll disappear into the bishop's hall 
And take a look at what we offer DDT poisoning me changing my relativity what's it going to be 
Da da da da d da later I think I'll disappear into another room and take a look inside the till 
Lovely days human ways journeys that take us to the end aah
Haven't we always been here sharing one love and one fear 
Some day you'll know that life is really really all about you 
So come and look inside you'll be surprised to find
Later I think I'll disappear into another womb and take a look inside the mens' room 
Haven't I given you everything that I could give where do you live aah
