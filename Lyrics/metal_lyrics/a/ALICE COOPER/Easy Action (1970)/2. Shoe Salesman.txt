I know a shoe salesman he's an acquaintance of mine 
One day he showed me some marks on his arms in a line 
I did not know what to say do you think those freckles will stay
I need a popsicle do you want lemon or lime 
I've got a special today if you've got the time 
Winking she pokes me in the side well we could go for a ride yeah
I did not know what to say do you think those freckles will stay heh
Well you think that she will see yeah heh I don't think she will see yeah heh
