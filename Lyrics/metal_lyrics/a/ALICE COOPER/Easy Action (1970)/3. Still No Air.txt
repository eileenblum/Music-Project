Who says the earth is crumbling and no sky is falling through sometimes I just can't die 
The world should be assembling but not just right out of view whole days I would like to fry 
Easy action got a rocket in your pocket 
When you're a jet you're a jet all the way 
From your first cigarette to your last dying day 
Who says the earth is trembling and there's still no air 
One two three four ooh ooh
