Well I pray in my final hour
All the people who again must die
All the liars and the robbers and the cheating wiles
Tortured every time
Well I've written home to mother the ink ran from my tear

I said momma momma please tell me why you brought me here
Well I'll hang on another minute
But really I have to know
If you ever want to see me again
You know what you can do
Well I've written home to mother the ink ran from my tear
I said momma momma please tell me why you brought me here
