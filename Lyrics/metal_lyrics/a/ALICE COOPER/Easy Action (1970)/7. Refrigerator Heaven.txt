I'm freezing I'm freezing I'm icicle blue so low low cool
Cyber neurotic technicians imbue so low low cool 
I've been admitted to refrigerator heaven until they discover a cure for cancer I'm low 
Refrigerator heaven so low refrigerator heaven 
I'm ice packed I'm hand stashed I'm waiting for you I'm older and younger preserved in a tomb 
I've been admitted to refrigerator heaven I feel like I told you on my heart 
I won't get back 'till the sun sets down on the moon 
Won't get back 'till the sun sets down on the moon
