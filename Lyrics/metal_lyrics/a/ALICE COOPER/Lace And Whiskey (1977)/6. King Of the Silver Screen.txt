By day I'm a workin' man,
layin' bricks or layin' pipe.
I don't stand out in a crowd;
just look like one of the guys.
Little do they know,
when I'm alone in bed at night,
I become the King of the Silver Screen.
I stare at the ceiling there;
I know where I belong.
I two step with Fred Astaire or
fighting old King Kong.
I can be any hero at all;
Zorro or Don Juan.
I know I'm the King of the Silver Screen.
Hollywood movies keep flashin' across my mind.
I could've been Valentino if I was born in another time.
I might be solving a case or swinging from a tree.  Share a joke with Crosby and Hope; we're such good friends, you see.
Even dazzle the Academy with my versatility.
'Cause I'm the King of the Silver Screen.
Hollywood movies keep flashin' across my mind.
I could've been Errol Flynn
if I was born in another time.
I could've been a star.
I could've been a star.
I could've played that part.
But Hollywood movies keep flashin' before my eyes.
I could've been Greta Garbo
if I was born in another time.
I wake the very next day
go on back to work.
I'm just a face in a crowd;
another average jerk.
And all the guys on the building site look at me flirt.
Because I'm the Queen of the Silver.
Recitation...
Yes, I'm the Queen of the Silver Screen.
I admit it to all my fellow workers.
I don't care any more. I'm tired of closets.
I'm gonna eat my makeup for lunch today.
Just stop hittin' me again. All right guys?
I'm going to Hollywood to be a starlet.
I know I'm 240 pounds and play center
for the Detroit Lions.
I don't care any more.
I like makeup and dresses and Hollywood.
I'll make somebody a great little wife.
"Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn."
