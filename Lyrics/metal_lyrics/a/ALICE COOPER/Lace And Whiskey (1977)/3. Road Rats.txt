We work this band 'cause they make it rock,
but we're the guys that make it roll.
We move the drums and amps and junk.
Road rats...
we're a pack,
and the road's our home.
On the road half my young man's life.
I spend a lot of time;
ain't got no bread to show for it.
Road rats...
all the cash spent on whites and wine.
We're the men behind the man.
We're the backbone muscle clan.
We do a thousand one night stands.
If the stars can make it,
if the band can shake it,
well, if those guys can take it,
we can,
yeah.
