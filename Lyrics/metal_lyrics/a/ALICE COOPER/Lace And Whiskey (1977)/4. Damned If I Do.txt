I'm gonna sign my name
to full confession.
It seems the woman I loved last night
belongs to another man.
They like to take you home;
they like to purr and tease you.
but I'm a passionate man,
and I couldn't leave her alone.
'Cause you are damned if you do,
damned if you don't;
damned if you will,
damned if you won't.
Sometimes they look so good,
but don't you let'em deceive ya.
'Cause then you find out that they got
some kind of a venomous mind.
And the thing that's worse
is that it all seems worth it.
I'm still a passionate man,
and she wouldn't leave me alone.
If you think that being a stud is easy,
well, now don't ask me, boys;
I wouldn't know.
I'm a little slow.
And you are damned if you do,
and damned if you don't;
you are damned if you will,
and your damned if you won't.

I'll be damned
