Well giving up to death, terror and hate
Feeling full of meth, I just can't wait
Give the rats what they want
Give the rats what they want
Open the cage, give the rats what they want

Oh, give me my cheese, the grill and the ride
Some bling and some sex and they glow inside
Give the rats what they want
Give the rats what they want
Just open the cage, give the rats what they want

Let 'em run the maze, let 'em ring the bell
Let 'em chase their tails, let 'em go to hell
Let them multiply, that's what they do
You better get them what they want
Or they're coming for you

Let 'em run the maze, let 'em ring the bell
Let 'em chase their tails, let 'em go to hell
Let them multiply, that's what they do
You better get them what they want
Or they're coming for you

Give the rats what they want
Give the rats what they want
Give the rats what they want
Give the rats what they want
Just open the cage, give the rats what they want
Open the cage, give the rats what they want
Oh, open the cage, give the rats what they want
