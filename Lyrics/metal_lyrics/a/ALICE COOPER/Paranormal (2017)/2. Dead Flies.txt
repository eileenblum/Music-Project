Please, watch your step, dear
The world is out to beat you
Don't you know there's cannibals
Designed to kill and eat you

You sister's high on angel dust
And so's your porno brother
And your phone know's more about you
Than your daddy or your mother

They'll drive you to the edge
And they'll leave you to die
Infected by the venom of their vicious, viral lies
It's all lies
We're dead flies

Priests and Parriahs
Disguised as holy guru
Practicing their montra
Of some cybernetic voodoo

And their's always a messiah
Preaching mass disaster
Claiming that their Jesus or Illuminati matters

They'll drive you to the edge
And they'll leave you to die
Infected by the venom of their vicious, viral lies
It's all lies
We're dead flies

It's all lies
We're dead flies

They're gonna need your money
To relieve you of your stessing
They'll take your wealth and fame
In exchange for the blessing

And they'll kill you with their gospel
Full of psycho-babble vomit
When they make you drink the Kool-Aid
And you ride off on that comet

It's all lies
We're dead flies
