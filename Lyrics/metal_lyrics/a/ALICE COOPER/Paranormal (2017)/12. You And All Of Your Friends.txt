One, two, three, four

We're burnin' down your city
The message has been sent
Angels without pity
We hold you in contempt

And this is how it all ends
For you and all of your friends

It's righteous conflagration
It's our way of payin' you back
For plunderin' our nation
Paintin' heaven black

So this is where it all ends
For you and all of your friends

And when the sun goes down tomorrow
We will no longer be your slaves
And it will be the end of sorrow
'Cause we'll be dancing on your graves

'Cause this is where it all ends
It's too late to make amends
For you and all of your friends

Thanks to vincent.lion1994 for sending track #5 lyrics.
