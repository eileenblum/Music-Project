I was a tall cool cat and I was on my own
Calling girlie after girl on my telephone
Then she stopped me in my tracks with those coal-black eyes
She put me on my back, I was paralyzed

My baby's love is hard, my baby's love is tough
If I were anybody else I'd o' had enough
'Cause she treats me like a dawg, not a cute little pup
But I've fallen in love and I can't get up!

Get up
Fallen in love
And I can't get up
Fallen in love

I was a billion-dollar baby in a diamond dress
Now I'm a dirty desperado and a steaming mess
She drive me nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof
She's like a dirty cup of poison that I can't refuse

My baby's love is hard, my baby's love is tough
If I were anybody else I'd o' had enough
I mean I used to be a stud now I'm a powder puff
'Cause I've fallen in love and I can't get up!

Get up
Fallen in love
And I can't get up
Fallen in love

Now I'm laying on the floor, I'm a broken mess
Somebody rescue me, I'm in distress
I need an S.O.S.

My baby's love is hard, my baby's love is tough
If I were anybody else I'd o' had enough
'Cause she treats me like a dawg, not a cute little pup
But I've fallen in love and I can't get up!

Get up
Fallen in love
And I can't get up
Fallen in love
