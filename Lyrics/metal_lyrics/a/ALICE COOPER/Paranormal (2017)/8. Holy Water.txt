I got a dot path and a walking cane
I got a black cat on a golden chain
I got a white shirt with a bloody stain
Going to the river of love
She got long hair
And big brown eyes
She belongs there, it was no surprise
Nothing wrong there, she made me realize
We're going to the river of love
We're going down to the river of love

Oh, holy water
Take me down, hold me under
Oh, I feel the power
Fill my soul with righteous thunder

I was decaying just like a cavity
Dismayed of my depravity
I got way laid by all the gravity
'Til we went down to the river of love
She is an angel, her name is Tiffany
She's kinda strange though, but my epiphany
I wouldn't change though 'cause she's a gift to me
And she leads me to the river of love
We're going to the river of love

Oh, holy water
Take me down, hold me under
Oh, I feel the power
Fill my soul with righteous thunder

I look around and I see loneliness
And hearts are bitter and cold
And filled with target this, the indoctrinations of a soul to kill
The emptiness you live with every night and day
But I'm here to tell you well that ain't the way
You gotta sing it out, you gotta reach to the sky
Until you ring it out, kiss the devil goodbye
You gotta wrap your arms around the woman you love
And raise your eyes to the Lord above, yeah
Raise 'em up to the Lord above, and say

Oh, holy water
Take me down, hold me under
Oh, I feel the power
Fill my soul with righteous thunder
Oh, holy water
Take me down, hold me under
