Please clean your plate dear the Lord above can see ya
Don't you know people are starving in Korea
Alcohol and razor blades and poison and needles,
Kindergarten people, they used 'em they need 'em
The over indulgent machines were their children
And there wasn't a way down on earth here to cool 'em
Cos they look just like humans at Kresge's and Woolworths
But decadent brains were at work to destroy
Brats in batallions were ruling the streets and
Generation landslide, close the gap between them

And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived those billion dollar babies

La da da da daa

Militant mothers hiding in the basement
Using pots and pans as their shields and their helmets
Molotov milk bottles heaved from pink highchairs
While mothers' lib burns birth certificate papers
And dad gets his allowance from his sonny the dealer
Who's pubic to the world but involved in high finance
Sister's out til 5, doing banker son's hours
But she owns a Mazarotti that's a gift from his father
Stop at full speed, at 100 miles per hour
The Colgate invisible shield finally got 'em

And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived those billion dollar babies

La da da da daa

No one gives an oink about prom night or football
Cos just getting home from school safe is a gamble and a blessing
Girlsies play with girlsies and boysies with boysies
Bored with one another, like old broken Christmas toysies
Kids are all hot and their parents so are noisy

And I laughed to myself at the men and the ladies
Who never conceived those billion dollar babies
