I'm machinery
With a semi-automatic heart
I'm unclassified
I terminate, I tear apart
I'm always there when you think I'm not
I'm razor sharp and I'm white and hot
My finger squeezes out the final shot
Say "Goodbye"

No integrity
No conscience, I'm just sold and bought
I'm insanity
I'm a camouflag-ed work of art
I've done some things I really can't describe
I've made some mouths open pretty wide
And I am licensed - trained and bona fide
Say "Goodbye"

Who do you think we are
Special forces in an armored car
Who do you think we are
We don't care, we don't care

I'm carnivorous
Can't count the flesh that I've been through
Never sick of this
I'm red and white and black and blue
I'm always there when you think I'm not
I'm razor sharp and I'm white and hot
My finger squeezes out the final shot
Say "Goodbye"

Who do you think we are
Special forces in an armored car
Who do you think we are
We don't care, we don't care
