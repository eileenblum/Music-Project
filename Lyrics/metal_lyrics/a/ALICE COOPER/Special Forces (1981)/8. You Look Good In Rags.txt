Yeah yeah

Yeah

I've seen cool, I've seen cold
I've seen the women up front, way down below
Ladies of the evening screaming, some were like vipers
I've seen 'em dressed real tight, act real loose
I've seen 'em strutting good stuff, I've seen 'em all used
With thousand dollar faces and worth every penny they spend there

But you look good in rags
With dirt in your hair
Yeah you look good in rags babe
Oh, I don't care
(Ah, you look good)
Yes you look good in rags
With bones in your hair
Ah, you look good in anything
Ooh, I don't care

Now I've seen class, I've seen tack
I've seen 'em walking down the street with smoke in their stacks
And pouring into limos, they wake up in millionaires' bedrooms
I've seen their hair cut short, black and sleek
Tied in 20 thousand knots so ultra neat
Swearing by the Harper's Bazaar, like it equalled the Bible

But you look good in rags
With dirt in your hair
Yeah you look good in rags babe
Aw, I don't care
Yeah Yeah, you look good
Oh you look good in rags
With dirt in your hair
Ah yeah, you look good in anything
Forget about Vogue or them hundred dollar jeans,
You make a 2 dollar T-shirt obscene.
Rag, rag
