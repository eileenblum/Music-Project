I fearlessly walk into battle
With a shine on my boots and my teeth
Never flinch, never blink, never rattle
My blood is like ice underneath
Oh, I'm the reincarnation of Patton
And I've got Hannibal's heart in my chest
God told me I would have rivalled
Alexander the Great at his best

(You're a movie)
Quite
(You're a movie)
Yes
(The exception)
That's right
(You're the final kind)
(You're a movie)
More of an epic
(Please include me, send us to the line)
Mm, that's right
Very good

Bullets repel off my medals
And my men are in awe when I speak
All chaos my strategy settles
My mere presence gives strength to the weak
For me it seems really alarming
I'm really just only a man
With five million sheep in this army
I seem to be the only one fit to command

(You're a movie)
I'm quite aware
(You're a movie)
Yeah
(The exception)
Oh, you've noticed
(You're the final kind)
(You're a movie)
Hey, very true
(Please include me, send us to the line)
Mm, if you're lucky
I must go now and save the world
Move aside mere drop of water, let the ocean pass

(You're a movie)
Quite right
(You're a movie)
(The exception)
(You're the final kind)
(You're a movie)
(Please include me)
Mm hmm
(Please include me)
(Please include me)
Possibly
(Send us to the lines)
Good man
(Send us to the lines)
I'll be at the front, please
(Front of the lines)
Oh, alright
Follow me

Another day, another victory
Another gold stripe, another star
Really quite boring sometimes
I wish they'd send someone equal to my strategies
What a guy
I'm really quite a guy
