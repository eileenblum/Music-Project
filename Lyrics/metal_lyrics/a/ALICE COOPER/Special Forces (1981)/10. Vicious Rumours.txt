You feel the knife stuck in your back
You feel it twist and you hear it crack
Can't make a sound for the sudden pain
You wish your blood were Novocaine

You see the smoke and you feel the flak
You're burning up and you're turning black
They say you fell and you hit your head
Your other bun is Whitenbread

Vicious rumours, paranoic fears
Sonic boomers ringing in your ears
All of this is getting normal now
You'll never go back to your farming plough
Vicious rumours

You're right at home back at William's flat
You heard a sound you turned and shot your cat
Your hands are shaking, everybody sees
And there's a rhythm drumming in your knees

You return into a foreign night
Inside you know something is just not right
Sometimes you duck when you see your pet
Canary turned into a Sabre jet

Shocked consumer - you're just an average guy
Swelling tumor pushing on your eye
And now you know why all the headaches come
And why you're getting progressively numb
Vicious rumours

I've been denied, debriefed, detuned
Sometimes I howl right at the moon
My family treats me gradually
They know my volatility

Vicious rumours, paranoic fears
Sonic boomers ringing in your ears
And now I know why all the headaches come
And why you're getting progressively numb
Vicious rumours
