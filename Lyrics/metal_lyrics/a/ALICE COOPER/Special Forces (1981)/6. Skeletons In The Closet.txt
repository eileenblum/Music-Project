Woah-oh, woah-oh
Skeletons in my closet
Woah-oh, woah-oh yeah
Skeletons in my closet
Skeletons in my closet
Skeletons in my shoes
Skeletons I can only see
Skeletons I can lose

I said woah-oh, woah-oh
I got skeletons in my closet
I said woah-oh, woah-oh yeah
Skeletons in my closet

Skeletons in my basement
Loitering on my streets
Wearing my best pajamas
Sandwiched between my sheets

I said woah-oh, woah-oh yeah
Skeletons in my closet
I said woah-oh, woah-oh yeah
Skeletons in my closet

Ooh, I see bones
I see bones, icy bones
Ooh, I see bones
Say say bones - say boys don't you see them bones?

Rattle them bones at midnight
Shaking my bed, no sleep
I find fingers in my coat pocket
Skeletons from the deep

I said woah-oh, woah-oh
I got skeletons in my closet
I said woah-oh, woah woah-oh
I got skeletons in my closet

Ooh, I see bones
I see bones, s-see bones
Ooh, I see bones
Icy bones
Say boys don't you see them bones?
No?
Heart bones, leg bones, ankle bones, arm bones,
Finger bones, dogie bones, head bones

Skeletons in my closet
They even know when I'm in my closet
It's my... my closet
Not your closet
My closet
You can have it though

whisper
Alice we want you
Alice
Alice
A-Alice

What?
Whaddya want?
