Don't tell me I should, I better, I can
Don't talk old to me
Don't shake that finger in my face no more
Cuz I might bite it off and spit it on the floor

Better get secure get my life insured
Buy a house and car that run
Better sell my bike, my leather coats
Those city auto parts and all my guns

Don't talk old to me
Don't talk so old to me
Don't talk old to me tonight, tonight

Don't tell me I should, I better, I can
Don't talk old to me
Don't shake that finger in my face no more
Cuz I might bite it off and spit it on the floor

Don't talk old to me
(Don't talk old to me)
Don't talk so old to me
(Don't talk old to me)
Don't talk old to me tonight, tonight
Don't talk old to me
(Don't talk old to me)
Kill me psychologically
(Psychologically)
Don't talk old to me tonight
Don't bark and I won't bite
Won't bite
Don't you bark

Better get secure get my life insured
Buy a house and car that run
Better sell my bike, my leather
Those city auto parts and all my guns
No fun, no fun
No fun, no fun, no fun, no fun fun fun

Don't talk old to me...
