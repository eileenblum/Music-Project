I'm 6 foot 3 with a fist like a hammer
And I work with the Vice Squad when I can
And when I pull out my badge they forget all my glamor
Little guys all surprised
Take a seat
Peek at me
It's a bust
I'm a man

I'm the prettiest cop on the block
I set your souls on fire
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block
I'm cool and I'm so mean
Oh, I'm the prettiest cop on the block
I've handcuffed your desire
I've got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock
My kids are confused and my wife is in shock

I'm a full blooded man not a weak immitation
I like to flex my arms in the neon lights
I'm a queen on the street and a king at the station
It's a secret of mine, not a sign I'm gonna make that right
Because..

I'm the prettiest cop on the block
I set your souls on fire
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block
I'm cool and I'm so mean
Oh, I'm the prettiest cop on the block
I've handcuffed your desire
I've got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock
My kids are confused and my wife is in shock

I must look pretty shocking
In my bullet proof vest
With my black lace stockings
All this hair on my chest
When the boys see me coming
All the boys start to run
They all got their empty holsters
And I got the only gun
Because..

Because, I'm the prettiest cop on the block
I set your souls on fire
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block
I'm cool and I'm so mean
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block
I handcuff your desires
I got a stiff reputation with a stick like a rock
My kids are confused and my wife is in shock

I'm the prettiest cop on the block
I set your souls on fire
Yes, I'm the prettiest cop on the block
And I'm cool -- so mean
I'm the prettiest cop on the block
I handcuff your desires

I'm so pretty, I'm so pretty, so pretty
Yes I'm gorgeous
I'm really lovely
And I'm so mean, so mean

I'm oooo I'm mean
But I'm pretty
And I'm mean
Sooo Pretty
But I'm mean
And I'm pretty...
