There's only six hours
Left in the day
Time is so precious
And it's slipping away

Got no destination
Got no place to go
And being with you
Is all that I know

Put your head on my pillow
We're finally alone
Wash the dust from your hair now
I don't care if you ever get home

There's only six hours
How quickly it goes
In this sacred place
Our secret is safe, nobody knows

Put your head on my pillow
We're finally alone
Wash the dust form your hair now
I don't care if you ever get home
Wash the dust form your hair now
I don't care if you ever get home
