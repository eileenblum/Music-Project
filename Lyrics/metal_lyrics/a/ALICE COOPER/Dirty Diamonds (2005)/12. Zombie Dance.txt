Walkin' through the tombstones
Go there everyday
Stood damn still I got a chill
Someone walked across my grave

Stroll across the killing fields
In the middle of the night
Walked across the fire
In the cold moon light

Black cat crossed my pathway
Winks her juju eye
Cross myself and kiss this world goodbye

Nights alive with music
Puts me in a trance
Sneak up on the bonfire
Watch the zombies dance

My tongue is hot and burnin'
When I try to speak
Spirit is so willing
My flesh is gettin' weak
Yeah, it's gettin' weak

Now I ain't superstitious
Don't roll no juju bones
Someone calls in the middle of the night
And no one's on the phone

Black cat crossed my pathway
Winks her juju eye
I crossed myself and kiss this world goodbye

I ain't superstitious
Don't roll no voodoo bones
Someone calls in the middle of the night
No ones on the phone

Nights alive with music
Nights alive with music
