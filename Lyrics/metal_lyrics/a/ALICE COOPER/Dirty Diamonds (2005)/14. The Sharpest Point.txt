Hurting me
Seems to be
Your passion

Misery
Is certainly
Your style

I'm like a kid in a candy store
I'm on my knees 'til I lick the floor
Can't stand to look at your face
But I'm burning for more

Sharpest pain
The ugly scar
The deepest cut
Is what you are

The burning sting
Is what you bring
And you remain
The sharpest pain

You're the star
In your own sad story
I'm just a toy
You can drag around

You're about as sick as you can be
A twisted abnormality
I don't want to be your first fatality

Sharpest pain
The ugly scar
The deepest cut
Is what you are

The burning sting
Is what you bring
And you remain
The sharpest pain

Though your never ever funny
I just gotta laugh out loud
Cuz you keep me in stitches
Until the last thread of decency runs out

Sharpest pain
The ugly scar
The deepest cut
Is what you are

The burning sting
Is what you bring
And you remain
The sharpest pain

Sharpest pain
The ugly scar
The deepest cut
Is what you are

The burning sting
Is what you bring
And you remain
The sharpest pain
