It just ain't fair I was put in that position
Somebody left their keys in the ignition
I saw the unlocked door and made my decision
I just can't help myself

Everybody knows
I'm gonna steal that car
My reputation shows
I'm gonna steal that car
I did some time in '99
I'll do some time again
Everybody knows
I'm gonna steal that car

I don't get bored with a Chevy or Ford
With a V8 enginee and a 4 on the floor
And a naughty Maserati can't be ignored
I just can't help myself

Everybody knows
I'm gonna steal that car
My reputation shows
I'm gonna steal that car
I did some time in '99
I'll do some time again
Everybody knows
I'm gonna steal that car

Everybody knows
I'm gonna steal that car
My reputation grows
I'm gonna steal that car
I did some time in '99
I'll do some time again
Everybody knows
I'm gonna steal that car My reputation shows
Steal that car
Steal that car
Steal that car
Steal it, steal it, steal it
Steal it, steal it, steal it
Steal it, steal it, steal it
Car, I want that car.
I want that car
I want that car
