I'm a shock-rock romeo
I like to leave 'em shattered
Oh, I can love 'em and leave 'em
It doesn't really matter

I never met my match
Until I met that lady
She hooked me
She cooked me
She practically filleted me

Some girls try and get you in bed
Some girls are like a kick in the head
Some girls make you wish you were dead
Some girls make you blue when you should be seeing red

She's a woman
Some kind of woman
I got a woman
A woman of mass distraction

The first time I saw her
She said she wants to date me
The next time I come back she tried to castrate me

Some girls try and get you in bed
Some girls are like a kick in the head
Some girls make you wish you were dead
Some girls make you blue when you should be seeing red

She's a woman
Some kind of woman
I got a woman
A woman of mass distraction

She's a woman
Some kind of woman
I got a woman
She's a woman
She's a woman
Some kind of woman
She's a woman
Some kind of woman
