You're the star
You're the face
You got the look that I can't erase
You look the world right in the eye
Stare 'em down baby, make 'em cry

Well I know it don't make much sense
I'm in love with your innocence
What you got what I need
You took my breath
Now let me breathe
What you got what I need
I follow where you lead

You make me wanna
Woo-hoo-hoo
Yeah, you know you make me wanna
Woo-hoo-hoo
Oh, you make me wanna
Woo-hoo-hoo
Yeah, I think I gotta
Woo-hoo-hoo

You're the bomb
I'm the fuse
Light me up and turn me loose
You shake me up when you walk by
My heart is beatin' and my mouth is dry

Well I know it don't make much sense
But I'm in love with your innocence
What you got what I need
You took my breath
Now let me breathe
What you got what I need
I follow where you lead

You make me wanna
Woo-hoo-hoo
You know you make me wanna
Woo-hoo-hoo
Oh, you make me wanna
Woo-hoo-hoo
Yeah, I think I gotta
Woo-hoo-hoo

Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo

What you got what I need
You took my breath
Now let me breathe
What you got what I need
I follow where you lead

You make me wanna
Woo-hoo-hoo
You know you make me wanna
Woo-hoo-hoo
Oh, you make me wanna
Woo-hoo-hoo

What you got
Woo-hoo-hoo
Oh, I got to
Woo-hoo-hoo
What you got
Yeah yeah yeah
Woo-hoo-hoo
What you got

Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
Woo-hoo-hoo
