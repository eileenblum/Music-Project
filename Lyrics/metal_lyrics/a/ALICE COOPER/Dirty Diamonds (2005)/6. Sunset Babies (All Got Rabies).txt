They're running in packs on a saturday night
They got their own bark and they got their own bite
Waitin' in line I can't wait no more... No
Slip right in, get kicked out the back door

I don't know
If it's possible to tame one
I don`t know
If she'll follow me home
I don't know
What it is about her

Sunset babies all got rabies
Sunset babies all got rabies
Got my shot...

They got a sixth sense, they know why you're here
They can smell the fear thru the smoke and the beer
They're a vicious breed and they just don't care
You think you're in but you're getting nowhere

I don't know
If it's safe to pet one
I don`t know
To go for my throat
I don't know
What it is about them

Sunset babies all got rabies
Sunset babies all got rabies
And I'd buy her a diamond collar, if she'd only throw me a bone
Here I am alone...

Sunset babies all got rabies
Sunset babies all got rabies
Got my shot...

And she's supposed to be a mans best friend
Why she play around
Now I gotta put that old girl down
