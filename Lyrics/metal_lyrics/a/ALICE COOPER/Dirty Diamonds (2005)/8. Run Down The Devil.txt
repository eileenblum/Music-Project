It's twelve o'clock in the mornin'
While everybody is sleepin'
I want him dead in my head lights
Cuz in the shadow he's creepin'

Drive on down to lonely street
He's always waiting there for me
Run down the devil, run the devil down
Run down the devil, run him down, down, down
Run down the devil, run the devil down
Run down the devil, run him down, down, down

I want to take him to the Mercury grill
I hope he's ready for the big blast
He'll be my ultimate road kill
I'll kick his future up his past

I'll send him back to hell alright
The world can sleep in peace tonight
Run down the devil, run the devil down
Run down the devil, run him down, down, down
Run down the devil, run the devil down
Run down the devil, run him down, down, down

Everybody's gotta hold him down
Can't let Beelzebaby back in town
Run down the devil, run the devil down
Run down the devil, run him down, down, down
Run down the devil, run
Run down the devil, run him down, down, down
Run down the devil, run the devil down
Run down the devil, run him down, down, down
Run down the devil, run
Run down the devil, run him down, down, down
