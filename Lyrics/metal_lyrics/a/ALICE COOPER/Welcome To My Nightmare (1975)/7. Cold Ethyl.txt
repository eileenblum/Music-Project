Yeah ooh oh one thing I miss is cold Ethyl and her skeleton kiss
We met last night making love by the refrigerator light
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms
Ah one thing no lie  Ethyl's frigid as an Eskimo pie
She's cool in bed she's gotta be 'cause Ethyl's dead
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms
Come on cold Ethyl freeze me baby that's cool that's nice
One thing it's true cold Ethyl I am stuck on you
And everything is my way ethyl don't have much to say
Ethyl Ethyl let me squeeze you in my arms
Ethyl Ethyl come and freeze me with your charms
Come here cold Ethyl what makes you so cold ooh so cold ooh ooh
Cold Ethyl cold cold Ethyl cold Ethyl cold cold Ethyl
Cold Ethyl cold cold Ethyl cold Ethyl cold cold Ethyl
If I live 'til ninety seven you'll still be waiting in refrigerator heaven
'cause you're cool you're ice cold Ethyl you're my paradise aah
