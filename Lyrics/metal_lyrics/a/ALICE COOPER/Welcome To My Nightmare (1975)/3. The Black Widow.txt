These words he speaks are true we're all humanary stew if we don't pledge allegiance to the black widow
The horror that he brings the horror of his sting the unholiest of kings the black widow
Our minds will be his toy and every girl and boy will learn to be employed by the black widow
Love me yes we love me love him yes we love him love me yes we love him ahahahaha
He sits upon this throne and picks at all the bones of his husbands and his wives he's devoured
He stares with a gleam with a laugh so obscene at the virgins and the children he's deflowered
Love me yes we love me love him yes we love him love me yes we love him ahahahaha
Our thoughts are hot and crazed our brains are webbed in haze of mindless senseless daze the black widow
'cos these speaks he says are true we're all humanary stew if we don't pledge allegiance to the black widow
The black widow
