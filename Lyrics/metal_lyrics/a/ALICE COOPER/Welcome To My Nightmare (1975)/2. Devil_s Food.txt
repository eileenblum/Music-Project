Get ready for the lady she's gonna be a treat
Simmer slightly 'till ready make her soft too make her sweet
I kiss the tears off from your chest I felt the poison fright that's in your breath
I knew your precious life and I know your death
I squeeze the love out of your soul all the perfect love that's in your soul
You're just another spirit on parole you are devil's food
You are devil's food you are devil's food ah
