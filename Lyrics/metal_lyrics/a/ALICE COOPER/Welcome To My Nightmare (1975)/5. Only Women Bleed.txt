Man got his woman to take his seed he got the power oh she got the need
She spends her life through pleasing up her man she feeds him dinner or anything she can
She cries alone at night too often he smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed only women bleed only women bleed
Man makes your hair grey he's your life's mistake all you're really looking for's an even break
He lies right at you you now hate this game he slaps you once in a while and you live and love in pain
She cries alone at night too often he smokes and drinks and don't come home at all ooh
Only women bleed only women bleed only women bleed only women bleed
Only women bleed only women bleed only women bleed
Man got his woman to take his seed he got the power oh she got the need
She spends her life through pleasing up her man she feeds him dinner or anything she can
She cries alone at night too often he smokes and drinks and don't come home at all
Only women bleed only women bleed only women bleed
Black eyes all of the time don't spend a dime clean up this grime
And you there down on your knees begging me please come watch me bleed
Only women bleed only women bleed only women bleed only women bleed
Only women bleed only women bleed only women bleed
