Some folks love to see red some folks never talk about it
Some folks crave a blue lady some folks know and still they doubt it
I'm just no good without it I'm not a man at all it makes my skin crawl
Baby baby come on and save me save me my my baby baby come on and save me now
Some folks love to feel pain some folks wake up every morning
Some folks live for no reason some folks die without a warning
I'm just no good without it I'm not a man at all it makes my skin crawl
Baby baby come on and save me save me my my baby baby come on and save me save me
My my baby come on and save me now
I just can't live without it just can't live without it
I don't want to think about it don't want to think about it
I just can't live without it I just can't get it
I just can't I just can't no I just can't live no I I can't
I'm just no good without it I'm not a man at all it makes my skin crawl
Baby baby come on and save me save me my my baby baby come on and save me save me
Baby baby come on and save me save me my my baby baby come on and save me now
'cos I just can't live without it I just can't live without it
I don't wanna think about it I don't wanna think about it
No I just can't can't live without it I know I don't wanna think about it
I just can't live without I just can't I just can't no I can't
