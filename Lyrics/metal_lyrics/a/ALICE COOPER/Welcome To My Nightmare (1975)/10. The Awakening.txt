I wake up in the basement I'm so hungry I'm dry
I must be here sleepwalking mustn't I
Getting up from my easy chair looking for my wife
Following a trial of crimson spots that lead into the night
Suddenly I realize I see it all through real eyes
These crimson spots are dripping from my hand
And oh it makes me feel like a man
