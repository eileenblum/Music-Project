I don't want to see you go I don't even want to be there
I will cover up my eyes and pray it goes away
You've only lived a minute of your life I must be dreaming please stop screaming
I don't like to hear you cry you just don't know how deep that cuts me
So I will cover up my eyes and it will go away
You've only lived a minute of your life I must be dreaming please stop screaming
Steven Steven I hear my name Steven is someone calling me I hear my name
Steven that icy breath it whispers screams of pain
I don't want to feel you die but if that's the way that god has planned you
I'll put pennies on your eyes and it will go away see
You've only lived a minute of your life I must be dreaming
Steven is someone calling me no Steven I think I hear a voice it's outside the door
Steven I hear my name Steven is someone calling me I hear my name
Steven what do you want Steven what do you want what do you want what do you want
Steven Steven Steven I hear my name
