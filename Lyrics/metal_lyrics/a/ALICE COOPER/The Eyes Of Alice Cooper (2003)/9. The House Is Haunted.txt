I was sitting in my room, dark and gray and crying
Someone in my life I fear was at the point of dying
A cold wind blew right up my spine, it was the break of dawn
A little voice way deep inside told me she was gone
Oh... This house is haunted
Oh... That`s how I want it to be
Oh... This house is haunted
You can always stay here with me...
No more singing, no more laughing, no more sunny days
She left and took the colours with her, buried in her grave
This is where we climbed the tower, this is where she fell
Then when her young heart stopped beating, I went to hell
Oh... This house is haunted
Oh... Ha....
Oh... This house is haunted
Ho.. . Oh...
You float through the lining room, I watch my TV
I feel you sit down on the couch right here next to me
The I feel you lips touch mine just like we used to do
I`m so happy all alone being here with you...
