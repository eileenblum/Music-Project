I call you every hour on the telephone
I work my fingers right down to the bone
I even got you a chihuahua so you wouldn`t be alone
Got you you a trailer 'bout the size of Maine
Bought a mile of interstate in your name
I`ve given you everything
Baby what do you want from me!
I burned all my porno - 'cause you were PMS'n
You say it offends you - All that talking it never ends
Disconnected my X-Box and ditched all my friends
So you can go to the opera.
Dumped all of my girlfriends - Even the dirty ones
You think they annoy you - they wanna destroy you
I`m givin` you everything
Baby what do you want from me!
Got you a picture you can put in a frame
Wearing a suit all check and lame
I even signed it at the bottom so you`d 'member my name
Took you to Target for your birthday meal
Got you an autographed buns of steel
So what a deal!
I`m givin` you everything
Baby what do you want from me!
I burned all my porno - 'cause you were PMS'n
You say it offends you - All that talking it never ends
Disconnected my X-Box and ditched all my friends
So you can go to the opera.
Don`t call my girlfriends - even the dirty ones
You say they annoy you - they wanna destroy you
I`m givin` you everything Baby what do you want from me!
I give you everything
Zirconium diamond rings
I Gotcha LoJack for your Pontiac
And some decals on your finger nails
And a a bassmaster(?), a Singing trout
And a TV and a CD
And a DVD from ABC
And baby what ya think of me!
Burned all my porno
You say it offends you
Disconnected my X-Box
Baby what do you want from me!
What do you want from me!
What do you want from me!
