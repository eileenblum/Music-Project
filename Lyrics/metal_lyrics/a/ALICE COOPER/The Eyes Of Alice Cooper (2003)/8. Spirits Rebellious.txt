I can`t do right when all I wanna do is wrong
My conscience sounds aloud like the waning on a Chinese gong(?)
I know about the punishment, I know about the law
My sins cut deeper then the teeth on a saw
My attitude is bad and my nerves are raw
I`m a shotgun snake, I`m a jackal with claws
I was born with a chip on my shoulder on a stormy night
Alright
My spirits rebellious, you tell us everything OK
No way
Spirits rebellious, we won`t do anything you say
It`s a hard, hard world with a black corroded heart
There`s a livin', breathin' devil trying to tear my soul apart
In a cold, cold grave on a dark, dark night
Eternity is black, I'll never see the light
Never listen to advice, I was never that bright
Couldn`t walk away, I was lookin' to fight
I was born with a chip on my shoulder on a stormy night
Alright
My spirits rebellious, you tell us everything OK
No way
My spirits rebellious, we won`t do anything you say
No Way
My spirits rebellious, you tell us everything alright
Tonight
Spirits rebellious, all we gonna hear is lies, lies, lies
Lies......
My Spirits rebellious
My Spirits rebellious
My Spirits rebellious
My Spirits rebellious
