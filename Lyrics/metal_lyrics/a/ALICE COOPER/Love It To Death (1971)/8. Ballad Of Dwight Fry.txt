Mommy where's daddy he's been gone for so long do you think he'll ever come home
I was gone for fourteen days I coulda been gone for more 
Held up in the intensive care ward lyin' on the floor
I was gone for all those days but I was not all alone 
I made friends with a lot of people in the danger zone
See my lonely life unfold I see it every day see my only mind explode since I've gone away
I think I lost some weight there and I I'm sure I need some rest 
Sleepin' don't come very easy in a straight white vest
Should like to see that little children she's only four years old old
I'd give her back all of her playthings even even the ones I stole
See my lonely life unfold I see it everyday see my lonely mind explode when I've gone insane
I wanna get outta here I wanna get outta here I I've gotta I've gotta get outta here
I I gotta get out of here I gotta get out of here I gotta get outta here I gotta get outta here
Ya gotta let me out of here let me outta here I gotta get outta here I gotta get outta here
See my lonely life unfold I see it everyday see my only mind explode blow up in my face
I grabbed my hat and I got my coat and I I ran into the street
I saw a man that was choking there I guess he couldn't breathe
Said to myself this is very strange I'm glad it wasn't me
But now I hear those sirens callin' and so I am not free
I didn't wanna be I didn't wanna be I didn't wanna be see my lonely life unfold I didn't wanna be
Leave me alone I didn't wanna be don't touch me see my lonely mind explode when I've gone insane
