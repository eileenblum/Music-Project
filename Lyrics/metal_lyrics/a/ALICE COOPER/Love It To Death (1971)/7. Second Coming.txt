I couldn't tell if the bells were getting louder the songs they ring I finally recognize
I only know hell is getting hotter the devil's getting smarter all the time
And it would be nice to walk upon the water to talk again to angels on my side
Time is getting closer I read it on a poster fanatical exposers on corners prophecy
It would be nice to walk upon the water to talk again to angels at my side
I just come back to show you all my words are golden so have no gods before me I'm the light
