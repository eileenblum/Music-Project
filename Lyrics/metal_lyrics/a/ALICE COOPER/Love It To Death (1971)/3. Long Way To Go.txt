We still got a long way to go we still got a long way to go we all got a long way to go
What's keeping us apart isn't selfishness what's holding us together isn't love
Listen to the man who's been touched all his life yes he's the one they call the fool
Where is that saviour of the sidewalk life and the road that takes us to the crusades
I've seen those shadows as they're moving in my sleep leading the blind poet to his grave
'cause we still got a long way to go we still got a long way to go yes we all got a long way to go
Please don't waste your energy on me my friend 'cause we still got a long way to go
We'll meet again some day but right now just go away 'cause I still got a long way to go
The silence is speaking so why am I weeping I guess I love it I love it to death
Yes we still got a long way to go yes we still got a long way to go yes we all got a long way to go
