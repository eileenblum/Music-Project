Touched by the toil and plunged into his arm cursed thru the night thru eyes of alarm
A melody black flowed out of my breath searching for death but bodies need rest body
Under the soil now waiting for worms all that I feared is all that I've learned
All that I know is all that I think dead feelings are cool down lower I sink ah hah
Bodies need rest we all need our rest sleep an easy sleep rest rest
Bodies need their rest we all need our rest sleep an easy sleep rest rest rest rest
But come back in the morning come back hard wake up wake up wake up wake up 
Bodies clutching and biting my soul has caught on fire my evil is now and I'm caught up in desire
Everything I'm living for is all that I am liking it and loving it that's all in the plan black juju
