Gather round right now and hear me whisper the words of the prison the words of laughter
The lords and the ladies were fixing their hairdos cursing their lovers cursing the bible
Hallowed be my name yelling at fathers screaming at mothers hallowed be my name
Come all you sinners come now in your glory and my ears will listen to your dirty stories
You're fighting to go up 'cause you're on your way down cursing their lovers cursing the bible
Hallowed be my name yelling at fathers screaming at mothers hallowed be my name ahhahahahaha
Sluts and the hookers have taken your money the queens are out dancing but now they're not funny
'cause there goes one walkin' away with your sonny cursing their lovers cursing the bible
Hallowed be my name yelling at fathers screaming at mothers hallowed be my name
