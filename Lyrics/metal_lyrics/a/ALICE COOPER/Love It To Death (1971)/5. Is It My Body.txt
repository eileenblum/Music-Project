What have I got that makes you want to love me is it my body or someone I might be or somethin' inside me
You better tell me tell me it's really up to you have you got the time to find out who I really am oh oh ah
What does it take to get inside of your mind give me a break and take a chance for the very first time
You better tell me tell me it's really up to you have you got the time to find out who I really am
What have I got that makes you want to love me now is it my body or someone I might be or somethin' inside me
You better tell me tell me it's really up to you have you got the time to find out who I really am ah ah ooh
