So they said
all of you said
that this would never last
we proved them wrong once again
now it's time
oh its time
to pull the curtain
above their eyes

they said
they said
that we cannot walk the path they have laid
they said
they said
that we still walked out on you once again

my eyes have seen the glory of this unbecoming
oh its time, open your eyes,
and see what all this is coming to

they said
they said
that we still will doubt the path that they laid
they said
they said
that we cannot mark the book
they were wrong

Yet we stand right up here
in front of all of you and your kings
as we
sink our teeth to the bone
right to the bone

and it feels sincere,
when you take this all and you throw it back to me
bearing down all this pain
I can see the sky
as it parts and I rain down
the shells of the blood on your head

oh they came
took this land
well they took and left  dried up
we will have nothing to pray about
oh it's time
open your eyes and see the future
and I can taste your flesh
when I sink my teeth right into your
open wound
open your eyes and see the truth

I will not be fueled by your endless lies
we are just waiting on all of you
it's too late for us to save anyone else but us
no time for this
we are stuck in your head
lets go,
gone
we'll take the shadows that are covering the sun

These are the signs that we left
for you to lead on
These are the signs that we left
for you
