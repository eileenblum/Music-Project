So this is what you wanted,
when your hands are tied behind your back and so content
You're a rook with no moves,
emptiness now ensues
and now you will feel exactly what it was
to rip away the paper mache
behind the mask it was you
behind the mask
it was you

I can taste the fear as I watch the tear
drip from off of your smoothed down porcelain face
break through the chains
of dispair and pain
Watch as the sun, it falls to the sea
you, feeling the same
run to the ship as it sinks in the bay
now we'll do the same
until they proclaim...

and we'll descend to the bottom,
of this empty hole,
that we claim is our home now
yet we still must dwell
on the actions dishonored
by you, burn in hell
bury all of the weakest
pray this is done now
we'll slowly die
we're still treating you wrong
don't make one false move
you're on the edge standing still
we'll bleed out the pain that's inside
bury yourself,
I confess to you it says,
run down
let this all go
but you didn't
now you sit

holding your head in your hands
OH!
block out the demons inside
praying to god, but only to pretend
your ignorance is innocent
Only to pretend, your innocence is pure

I will be left up on this hill,
that you died upon
The stars will die to see,
you picked his will
oh
You pushed his will on us
to bind us to

I'm afraid that in footprints i've made
I'll look back and i'll feel records of my mistakes
even animals leave footprints of men
this time i'll hold fast to your hands
as your feet
are nailed to trees
