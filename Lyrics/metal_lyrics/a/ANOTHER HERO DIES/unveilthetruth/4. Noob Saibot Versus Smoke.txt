Repent, pray the storm will slowly go,
and wash away this guilt  overtaking me,
and now
wipe the smile from off of this face and replace it

Blank stares fill the room
and yet all,
eyes are on me and I cannot see
You still feel the poison
rushing through your vains

With a quivering jaw you stand and stare right into the eyes
of the devil and he stares right back at you
and the devil he will stare right into your soul

Pray that the storm will come and flood me in the end
but I can't say what I want to be when i'm all alone
my god, we will never let them win again
we'll sit down

I dig deeper,
to pull myself together
no scars will be left upon
this body of mine
I want you to feel
the pain  you left on them
the scars wont heal until you show us
what it means to feel this time
with your light

[x3]
We are all the kings
you can't defy us
when you've only come this far
