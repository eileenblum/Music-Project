We've been walking so long
your lips lead us on
Weakened by the lights,
but when your eyes are closed
you will see the sun

We only hoped that this would all be
one in the same in the end,
but you cannot help jealousy
when you're lusting through,
but my eyes will be fooled
by you and your tainted ways
you lie
lie to me

Watch as we all fall down to the street
wait to the side
wait here in vein
fight through the fog
you cannot hide
we will not stop, dont fight

[x4] Don't let us in, You cannot win

It's time to tell the truth behind the lies,
this is for you

I only hoped that this would turn
and find it's way back to you,
and everything you went through
this will be tied
no end this time
When you get out of breath,
write it down then die
god bless them they'll help you
until you have finally lived

We stand in silence
we stand inside this so we can see you standing silent
We stand inside ourselves so that I can see the truth
handing out a false impression
This will be you,
write it down on my heart

Stand inside
stand inside this so you can see you
Stand inside
stand inside yourself
