Close your eyes

Lets wash away these feelings of emptiness
Knowing nothing of what still lies ahead
Still moving forward
Feeling stronger with every step
Don't wage this war on your own mind
This is the beginning of something new
Trying to rebuild ourselves from the ground up
We can't stand with twisted tongues

The soil pours from my mouth
For all those made to speak against us
The soil pours from my mouth
With open ears to know the truth

Never give up on yourself
Don't become your own enemy
This battle can be won by you
So hold your ground

And when the fire is burning inside us
Can you feel the heat?
Torturing all who stand below us
What is becoming of me?
We have walked the right path for so long
Now it's slowly fading away

The soil pours from my mouth
For all those made to speak against us
The soil pours from my mouth
With open ears to know the truth

We must move over this mountain
To see everything we've changed
There is no need for failure
We all deserve a second chance
