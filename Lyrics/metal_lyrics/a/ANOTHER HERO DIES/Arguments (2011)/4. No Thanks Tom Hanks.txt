I know that you're still watching over me
But I fear that I cannot be the man that I thought
As long as I know that you are there
I can rest with ease and sleep tonight

And I know that I cant let you go
And I cannot take this over

Reaching into the back of my mind
Finding all these things I've been hiding
From myself and everyone else
I'm setting out to prove them wrong

I know that if I follow all these steps
It will become so clear
If you're still standing above me
These lessons can't be learned

You will not walk on me again
When this becomes a distant memory
I will stand as tall as these trees
I have showed you we will not be walked on this time

We will tear this thorn from our side
And scream out loud
Never silencing again
I'll make this stand when no one else will
And when your crown falls
I'll steal this throne
I'll steal your throne
You fucking bitch

I will never be self righteous
I refuse to be a monster
All these things that I have learned
Brought me here today

I wont drown like my brothers
Walking backwards
Every footstep
Seeing everything ahead of me

It's like im trapped in this moment
Still watching everything unfold
I can't watch their selfishness
Destroying everything I've built

Free me from his cage
Help me break these chains
So I know what it's like to be alive again
Now I know how it feels to be alive again
