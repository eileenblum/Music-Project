You will see everything in me
I despise like a disease
Now will be when this all begins

The tables start turning
There is no happy ending
When you let this life pass you by
Your narcissistic ways will hold on you
Until you die

We cut it off and watch them fall this time
We cut it off and watch them fall this time

We spread these lies
We spread these lies and now they are laid out on the cutting board
This time we spread so thin that we cannot hold no more
We cut them off and watch them fall this time

We watch them fall

This would become
You said all this would become
Real
We're not you
