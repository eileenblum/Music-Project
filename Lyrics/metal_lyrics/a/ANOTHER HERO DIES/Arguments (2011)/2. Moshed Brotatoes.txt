I cannot change who I am
I need your help to guide me through this
I cannot change what I've become
I can't escape when I have no faith

Coming so far just to stop
Would be a waste of something precious
Grab the last good memory
and push to start a new day

We must learn to live through our mistakes
Our tragedies that we have created
All of this can be erased
We've come too far for this to end
This is the sacrifice we make to ourselves

[Chorus]
I said I want to be free
Not shackled by the chains of uncertainty
My fall will only come
If I let myself down

We will never give up
Until this wall is broken down
From the voice of hypocrisy
We will break free
Never believe what they say or what they do
They will believe when they're sober
Now, inside is where it lies
The strength to move along

You know I'll never be the same again
They made me change for the better

[Chorus]
I said I want to be free
Not shackled by the chains of uncertainty
My fall will only come
If I let myself down

Never follow in the footsteps
Create the path on your own
