Always thinking of a better way
But not pursuing anything
You say this is all a joke
Because you will not see this through

Procrastinating is all you've ever known
Your mind is like a room with no doors
You cannot see in the dark
So let me light the way for you

Light the way for you

I know I can help you if you just let me in
Dig this grave

Silence fills the air around you
I know exactly what you're thinking
You've come to terms with the choices you have made
But you wont let them hold their weight

As this begins to fall apart
You think you have won, but this is just the start
You can't kill them all
Let me take your hand
I can lead you through this hell
All this sadness seems so miniscule
once you see the big picture

You only get one chance to breathe
Among the giants we've created
We are evolving every day

You can be better than them
Let me teach you these things that have been passed on to me
I promise this will be the last time that these tears will fall
Like an ocean around you
If you don't move the tide will pull you under
The water is beginning to rise
Now get to shore because it's almost high tide
I can't let you drown like this
I have to free you from these waves
And when the storm becomes so fierce
And you can't stand still
I will quiet the thunder and calm these winds
And if you ever falter
I will place the ground back under your feet
