Staring straight at the ceiling
Feeling nothing at all
My bare bones will scrape these sheets
I cannot sleep
These thoughts are keeping me awake X2

Bury everything that you had left
This is the last time you will take a breath
Screaming for something that will not come
Hoping,Praying that this will be done
But you know that this will not end

[Chorus]
Taking back all of the ugly things you said
Mortified by all these awful things we've done

Now forgotten
You cast yourself aside

You lost again all the confidence you had
They see the weakness and they will knock,
Knock you down, Knock you down

You can't hide from every problem that we face

[Chorus]
Taking back all of the ugly things you said
Mortified by all these awful things we've done

Taking back all of the ugly things you said
Mortified by what we have done

No one can escape these lies
Tell the truth or it's your demise
Tell me the truth
