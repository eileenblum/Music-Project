We salted the wounds of the ones
who followed us into the night
we prayed as we broke all there trust
were marked in there sights

The cycle is never ending
we watch as this is buried in the sand
but we must build upon this broken bottle where this is
buried in the sand

I will write this down for you
to never read the words
I will write this down for you
and never read the words

Wipe all the tears that we have shed from your eyes
wipe all the tears that we shed

Keep me awake
for he will come
and take me away

Keep me awake for this is all I have
no time for the good farewell
nothing to calm the nerve
you let me slip into the night
without having any regrets or any faith
nothing to save my life

Keep me awake, the silence is broken
were falling again
Im on the edge, this time
never standing for anyone
but me

Playing back what they said
from the lies
and its been to loud
to hear the voice from here

Dont ever...

I will write this down this time
the context of my life
running from our lies its all I have
no truth in sight
Bring it back to the way we were before
dont ever say never again my love

This is buried in the sand
Loss is whats at hand

I will write this down again
for you to feel the sound
