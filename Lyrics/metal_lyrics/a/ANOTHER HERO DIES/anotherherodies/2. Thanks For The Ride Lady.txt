Your deeds brought you the shame
But They were hidden away
you always knew who to blame
I know your marks

I am the shadow
the man inside your sleep
you know who you are
faith will always hold these bars

Your eyes become crowded
as your mind weakens
thier will be no seconds in your eternity
for this death that you deserve
for this death that you deserve

I am not sorry for what i have done
this pain eats at my stomach
I swallow my hands in defeat
i am not guilty
i am not guilty
i am not guilty

the faith wiped from my face
I will always still feel the presents of your absent grace
With this pain devouring my stomach
I keep a steady pace Until we meet again

Until we meet again
Until we meet again
