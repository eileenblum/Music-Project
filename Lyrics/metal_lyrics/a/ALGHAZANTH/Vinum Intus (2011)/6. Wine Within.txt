For aeons and aeons
We've witnessed the journey of the sun
and the moon voyaging across the sky
and still we know that neither shine forever
...forever like we shine

We keep the water of faith flowing
for that is dead which stands still
In the ceaseless act of going
hides the key to doing our will

Wed are the lunar and the solar
Silver and gold are mixed together
The left and the right turned into one thing
The wine within

For countless ages
We've experienced the wonder of birth
and death cutting down life's puny weeds
and still we know that neither are eternal
...eternal like our deeds

Deep into Nightside's ice-cold womb
With dark intent we plant these spells
As magical seeds shall they strike root
in the soil within ourselves as well

Wed are the lunar and the solar
Silver and gold are mixed together
The left and the right turned into one thing
The wine within

May the opposer
drink deep of this sacrament
As a token of our oath to Him
We formulate this offering
