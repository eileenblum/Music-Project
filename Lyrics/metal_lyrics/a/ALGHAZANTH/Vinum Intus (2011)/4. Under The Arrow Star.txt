Red is the winding way that leads me to the gate
and black the path beyond running through unknown plains
In the heat of combat, in all untamed love
To fall like a warrior is to rise like the sun

For the one that truly has awakened to know
In the strangest patterns the cosmos unfolds
Even the most wondrous chimeras of flesh
In the eyes of a true beholder equal nothingness

In the fort of eternity is my home
Upon the triangle of ice I have set my throne
I follow not the ones above, nor lead those below
In this magical universe I am alone

With the wine of attainment the earth will be fed
Where I shall once fall rewarded with death
A thousand vultures will haunt that place
Each taking a beakful until bare bones remain

In the fort of eternity is my home
Upon the triangle of ice I have set my throne
I follow not the ones above, nor lead those below
In this magical universe I am alone

Place thou upon my altar the head of humility
and in a cup beside it the blood of mundane dreams

In the fort of eternity is my home
Upon the triangle of ice I have set my throne
I follow not the ones above, nor lead those below
In this magical universe I am alone
