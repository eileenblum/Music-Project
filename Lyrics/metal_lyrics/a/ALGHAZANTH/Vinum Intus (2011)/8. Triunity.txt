A time tailored after an ancient design
With stellar formations positioned aright
mercilessly pound the hammers of Sin
Forging into form the dusk on Adam's kin

In silvery streams the earth now bathes
by their touch feathers change to scales

Unhallowed goddess, all nightmares at her feet
A perfect sanctum for the master's seed
Wet with divine lust, all lesser wants forsaken
Herself she opens as the shadows awaken

Behold the beast, behold his queen
Behold their pact of obscenity

Bow your heads down...
To her, the anointed harlot
To her who is forever lewd
and to him, the venom of God
To him that can't be subdued

In unison their psalms all ravens intone
Across the dimensions this hymn now flows

And the Day of the Scythe is ushered inâ¦

Exalt the beast, exalt his queen
Exalt the one that completes the three

Raise your cups high...
To her, the darkside's whore
To her who is of the night
and to him, the heart of blackness
To him who begets the child

In their towers made of severed heads
They are high enough to touch the moon
As monoliths have now arisen
The ones cast out from heaven!
