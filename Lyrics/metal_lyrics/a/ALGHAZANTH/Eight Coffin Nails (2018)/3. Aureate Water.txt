Not even in the abyssal ocean
Did the nail from the sacred forge cool,
And that iron thorn fallen from on high
Was driven into a soil ever-frozen.

By its burning blessing
Everything was transformed,
The ice turned into a stream
And the land into its sole vessel.

Through more and more sacred drops
The stream became a gushing river.
Wild it flowed forth, consuming
Even the earth around it.

Come the deadliest of droughts
Or a winter without end.
The water will not still,
Its course will never bend.

Day after day, night after night,
My mind rides its hidden currents,
And the mirror-like surface
Cradles my truest reflection.

The roaring will,
The earthen heart.
Their essence mixed together,
Their destination the same.

The sea of your shoreless darkness!
