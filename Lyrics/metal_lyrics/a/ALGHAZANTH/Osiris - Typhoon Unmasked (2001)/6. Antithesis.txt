Spokesmen of slavery,
The earth is barren where you stand
Knee-deep in the quicksand of inability
Yet, respect is what you demand 

Save your quotes and affected sermons
'coz stupidity has never impressed me
Know that my windows aren't walls like yours are
And no act you engage in can do me harm 

Why such reluctance to discard the doctrines
That are like talons tearing apart your within?
Oh, the despair if god ever turned his back on you
This catastrophe scenario of yours is making me amused 

You are but fools sacrificed at random
In the twisted game of redemption
It's illogical to choose a path
That will ultimately lead to one's decline
And still wish for a sip of monumentality's wine 

In the same labyrinth of dilemmas we dwell
To me it is a challenge, to you it is a hell
Your kind may seek comfort in thraldom
But I stand erect, holding high the banner of wisdom 

Rapists of dignity,
Sowing your falsehood into young minds
So arrogantly trusting your sanctity
Though, the stab will come from behind 

You are but fools sacrificed at random
In the twisted game of redemption
It's illogical to choose a path
That will ultimately lead to one's decline
And still wish for a sip of monumentality's wine
