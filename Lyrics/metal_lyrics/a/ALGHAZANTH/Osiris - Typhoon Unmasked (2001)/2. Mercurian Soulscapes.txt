Demigodly creatures infiltrating the human race
Embodied hellish energy behind a common front
Aware of reality's phantasmagoric nature
We can see right through its manmade exterior 

Bearing the spark of purification
Which'll clothe all continents in a fiery veil
Erasing the errors of the past
Thus, making way for the future
And reclaiming the dignity once lost 

Those sharing the goblet of deeper insight
Can never be misled by any mortal word
And so we wander in subterranean shadows
Where the beams of biblical light fail to distract 

Like a pack of bicephalous wolves
Patiently observing those we desire to hunt
Fully prepared to unleash our innermost demons
To violate, to ravish and to annihilate 

By sundown's ghastly eminence we'll assemble
To bayonet each and every clerical heart
And with the lifeblood of the first dead shepherd
Our faces will be painted as an indication of triumph 

Enfolded by bleak auras
Glowing with otherworldly splendour
Upon the wings of inborn aspiration
We shall soar high above the carcass fields
Where fellow ravens peck holes in rotten skulls
