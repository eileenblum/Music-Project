I am cause and effect, I absorb and reflect
Picture an unbroken circle and you'll comprehend what I am
I have no beginning nor an end
A stream of impure deeds that the holy resent 

I improve your fractured reality
But only to deprive you of a crown
I even build you towers
But only to tear them down 

By my command
The heaven bleeds a rain of arsenic tears
And petty souls are put asunder
Like two-thousand years old papyrus scrolls 

Ignorance=degeneration
Your deletion lies in this equation
Acknowledge your secret thirst for my existence
For I can turn you into a god 

All the names of darkness are carved upon my skin
I am an unsolved riddle, a myth of the gloomiest kind
The fountain of excellence or the venom of mind 

Never has true euphoria been rooted in utopia
Dip your face in acid and admire the new you
There is illusion even in illusion
But behold with my eyes to see clarity in confusion 

Be my scepter and I shall be your throne
A Union Equilibrium, we'll reign eternities as our own
A thin line seperates madness and magnificience
And together we are bound to balance upon it
