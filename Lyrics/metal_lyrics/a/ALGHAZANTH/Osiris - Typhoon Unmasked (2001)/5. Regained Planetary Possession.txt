The lower the sun sinks,
The larger each shadow grows on celestial soil
Not suddenly but certainly
The holy land is swallowed into new kind of tyranny 

The planet, like a thoroughly raped whore,
Bled the demonic ones out from its core
The tempest speaks in ominous tongues
Of a tremendous havoc yet to come 

Worlds bend and even time devours itself hollow
Inhale the blasphemous dance of the macrocosm
With throes it gives birth to a strange constellation 

Emerging from the sea of distress
Like a 21st century Leviathan 

The unseen legionaries, all-worldly possessors
Now enter the skies over god's paradise
They dominate and they destroy
They decide when the curtain shall fall (on our pityful existence) 

Mother earth already underwent the metamorphosis
And so shall all her children
Kissed by Thanatos and pulled to the grave 

Soldiers of Satan, the very emperors of this world
Animosity embodies, new methods of torture surface
Human despair is their amusement
Nations fell pale before life's nemesis 

On the expanded levels of awareness
Compulsive behaviour breeds
Give in to these imperatives
And participate in self-destructive deeds
