All the way from Eden to Armageddon
Such long the journey, not a single step taken
Infested the planet like malignant tumors
Still being the lowest of all terrestial lifeforms 

Welcome to the grand downward vortex
Drowning in nightmares, fear is what we breathe
A flickering flame of a candle is our existence
Fading out, evermore insignificant 

In comparison with the living
The dead seem rather fortunate 

We have engraved our own epitaph
The last paragraph in the chronicles of man
A scythe-bearing sun smiles at the tragedy
Sheding a light of irony upon the failures of humanity 

Technology marches on
As does the death of intelligence
Towards a brand new Golgatha
Where only one cross awaits us all 

Mankind... Cast aside... Deprived of life
Tormented with the nails of extinction
The last swing of the hammer concludes the parody
Of a race poisoned by triviality 

And still some dare to ask: Will dawn follow this darkness?
