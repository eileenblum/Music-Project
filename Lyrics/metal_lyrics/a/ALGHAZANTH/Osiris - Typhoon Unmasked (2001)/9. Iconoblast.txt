Profoundly punished am I
Bound to bear witness to this global masquerade
In which kings and fools may be the same
Theatrical innocence and whoredom are abloom
In the rotten hierarchy fundamentally deaf to all truths 

Narrow is the path of the compassionate
Vain is the philanthropic approach
Making haste from the womb to the stage
To star an incoherrent martyrplay 

I bow to Osiris-Typhon
And to the grandeur of His ascendancy
Within, about and beyond me
I extol the sun-outshining Mercury
That steals the feeble's vision 

Consider me as a potential iconoblast
As a gun pointed at your foreheads
Without mercy and remorse
I tread on the debris of benevolence
And assault the most sacrosanct 

Corrupted to the core and, yet, so sinless
Terminally short on dignity
Just barely breathing in morality's stranglehold
If self-delusion was a crime,
You'd be taken straight to the gallows 

Narrow is the path of the compassionate
Vain is the philanthropic approach
Making haste from the womb to the stage
To star an incoherrent martyrplay 

Profoundly rewarded am I
Stripped of all humane amidst this global masquerade
