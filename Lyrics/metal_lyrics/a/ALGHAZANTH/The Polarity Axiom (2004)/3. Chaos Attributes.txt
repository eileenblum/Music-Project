Vapours of malice and ill-will we breed
up to the Astral Light they steam
as hails of pandemia they'll soon return
battering the race of human worms

The great crusher of worlds
demolishing with us as Thy tools
unstable sinister element
force omega to the ways of fools

Beyond the tangible shroud
the black waters cease not to stir

The great architect of worlds
constructing with us as Thy tools
the vital fire of rebirth
force alfa to the aeons of Truth

The raging waves of Fohat
ride over our dimensions
and we are the rocks that they carry
the mass of the primitive oceans
once set the process in motion

The march of chaos - alliteration to order

Beyond the tangible shroud
the black waters cease not to stir

The raging waves of Fohat
ride over our dimensions
and we are the rocks that they carry
the mass of the primitive oceans
once set the process in motion

No shackle of any mundane rule
can or will chain us still
for we are the ones to quake this world
