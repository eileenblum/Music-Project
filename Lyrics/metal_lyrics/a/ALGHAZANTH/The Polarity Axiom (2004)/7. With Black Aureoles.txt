We fell and were dressed in skin
as beasts to roam this labyrinth
the voice of the Cosmic Mind
still echoes in the depths inside

Behold these carnal forms
against a background of gold
with black aureoles

Spirit and matter, the balance and the battle
polarity - the basis of all living and dead
the dragon and the serpent, the higher and the lower
polarity - the basis of all written and said

By a modern means to an ancient end
to pour reason on the minds once bent
the "I" is nought without the "AM"
awareness, light the wick in man

Full of the hunger to absorb more
and to shine it all forth
with black aureoles

Spirit and matter, the balance and the battle
polarity - the basis of all living and dead
the dragon and the serpent, the higher and the lower
polarity - the basis of all written and said

The warmth on our backs
is the same on your chest
and the cold beneath our feet
is the one on your flesh
