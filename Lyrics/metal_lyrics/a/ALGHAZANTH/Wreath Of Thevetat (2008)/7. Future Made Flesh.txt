The crack in the earth
between us grows wide
there's dread on your face
but certainty on mine

We differ in essence
like night does from day
I'm a proud servant
but you're just a slave

At the opposite ends
of the rope we are
you with blue lips
I with sore palms

This scene is a symbol
for the fate of mankind
future made flesh
a glimpse of coming times
