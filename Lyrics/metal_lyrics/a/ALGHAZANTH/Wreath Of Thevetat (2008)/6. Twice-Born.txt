Solely in Thy presence freely I breathe
set apart from the choking world of fetters

Forlorn will be each vain objective
butchered all ingrained penitence
release me from all that is illusive
from humanity grant relinquishment

The shadow of Thy horns will keep me cold
sheltered from the treacherous warmth of matter

I have given Thee my thoughts
thus them Thou Will and shall conduct
I have offered Thee my flesh
thus it Thou will and shall corrupt
my mind is the temple of worship
and body the altar of sacrifice
by will and devotion is hastened
the elevation above this mortal life

Heed, Father in darkness, unto my wordless call
and from mundade veils now strip this spirit bare
as with deepest obeisance in my pounding heart
I kneel before the scorching five-armed star

Responding the the unearthly vibrations
this ego is medium for the sinister
as prism to refract the dreadful rays
streaming from the Eyes of Chaos

Madly with the thirst of a deserthound
I drink from the river of satanic might
committed I am to perfect this crown
placed on my head by the hands of Thine

Thou have set me upon this path
thus it I will and shall tread forth
Thou have opened me these realms
thus them I will and shall explore
the rock I stand on can't be moved
for it rests upon Thy sanctity
each word of reverence I utter
shall pass my lips in awe for thee

Heed, Father in darkness, unto my wordless call
and from mundade veils now strip this spirit bare
as with deepest obeisance in my pounding heart
I kneel before the scorching five-armed star
