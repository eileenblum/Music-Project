From the One that beyond thought is seated
cascaded forth the drops of blood aflame
and this blinding rain of stars was greeted
with the abysmal depths of existence agape

The radiant sons of the blackest light
in the mirror image of Kosmos reside
with these tongues the serpents speak
with these lungs the serpents breathe
still adapting to the poisonous essence
to the strong walls of earthly presence

The obliteration of our growing decline
storms at the behest of Lucifer himself
to kindle awake the pyres divine
smouldering within these carnal cells

Thickening matter with its relentless hands
flagellated the high powers into dormancy
but though bolted fast by the flesh of man
in time they shall restore full vitality

A call is upon the gods we hear inside
from their aeon-long slumber to arise
with these eyes the serpents see
with these minds the serpents dream
slowly surpassing the strict boundaries
set by our narrow and weak abilities

The obliteration of our growing decline
storms at the behest of Lucifer himself
to kindle awake the pyres divine
smouldering within these carnal cells

On the great day the drops are rejoining
the vast sea of fire will be all-destroying
The stellar substance and the soul of man
In world's warm ashes as one then stand

The obliteration of our growing decline
storms at the behest of Lucifer himself
to kindle awake the pyres divine
smouldering within these carnal cells
