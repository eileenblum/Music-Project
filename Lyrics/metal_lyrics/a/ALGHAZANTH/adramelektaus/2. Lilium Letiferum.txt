From a single seed I have grown you an Eden
from a drop of blood the gushing rivers around
deep within I have prepared you a throne
so flourish throughme with your root in my soul

At the heart of the cross
the elements join as one
likewise has my road
merged with yours become

Naught more are men but pollen in the wind
spreading your gospel far and wide
where ever we may go your presence will follow
not as a companion but as a murderous shadow

At the heart of the cross
the elements join as one
likewise has my road
merged with yours become

One day upon my tomb a solitary beauty shall bloom
and beneath it my weary bones lie bound by your root
