By my spell / the knots i tie to bring flames near
without sound / passed from my lips right to your ear
be thou bound / chains of dread will bind your thoughts
be thou drowned / in a tide of spite your self is lost
Hear these words of bane
may their salt inflame
the gaping wound that grows inside
hear these words of bane
may their salt turn grey
the once-fertile soil of your mind
At the break of the final dawn black vultures cloud the skies
then, as if dipped in a lake of blood, your sun will rise red
no warmth in its rays, no hope in its light
and then your knees shall hit the mud from its heart rides death
By this curse / the hounds of malice I invoke
without sound / a thousant teeth will rip your throat
be thou bound / forever sunk in restless sleep
'neath thy mound / nothing left but a maggot's feast
Feel these words of bane
like shrapnel in your brain
from this barless cage there's but one way out
feel these words of bane
guide you to your grave
yet death means not escape from hell's hungry mouths
At the break of the final dawn black vultures cloud the skies
then, as if dipped in a lake of blood, your sun will rise red
no warmth in its rays, no hope in its light
and then your knees shall hit the mud from its heart rides death
