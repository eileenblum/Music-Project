[While incarnate, man is equally an entity of intellect and flesh, and neither aspect should be overlooked in the context of establishing and maintaining a connection to our gods. To worship merely in the temple of the mind is to wield the sword with just one hand.]

A cold presence descends on us
like some mist of blackest water
drenched in this darkness
we are cleansed from all profane

The circle is forming
there's no way nor will to retreat
with faith as our fortress
we've discarded doubt and shame

Be with me now, o' children of Samael
our mouths are one as we drink from the fullmoon's well

No path is stonier than this
No path as tortouous as His

With the ichor of highest magick
the Master moistened our lips
He taught us the craft of Speech
and thus we'll make our voices heard

The Kingdom is ours to rule
and the heavens are in our grasp
let our words of power reach
all the quarters of the earth

Move, dance, give away to this trance
may hand join in hoof and hoof in hand
sing, praise, as lust smears your face
no act is unlawful in His pyre's blaze

Sin, transgress, put each border to a test
grant divine impulse full reign over flesh
boil and seethe from head down to heels
with fervour feed the God that lives in deeds

Stand with me now, o' servants of Samael
our mounts are one as we eat of the sun that fell

No path is deadlier than this
No path as glorious as His
