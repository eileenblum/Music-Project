Disentangeled by abominations
Strenghtened in every aspect through confrontations
Hiding oneself from the sarcastic faces of this universe

A fallen disciple burdened with confusion
Conquered by an uncontrollable creed to scatter His delusion
Plundered down to the spectral gorges of the earth

Undisguised for the ignorant to see
The splendour in such a profane conspiracy

Imprisoned and lost in the untrodden maze
...of predators and preys

Cutting like a dagger hardened in His fire
Afflictions and violations are freed in this void
Possess an almighty eye to witness their choir
And hunt down fools that have always decoyed

Wingless and scattered, the slaves of submission
In them, ideal serpent of death, waiting
Lead by instincts like vermin on a carcass
oppressed by the context; blessing of oblivion
...Absence is present when the presence is absent

Anxiously awaiting His millennia
Slowly sowing the seeds of hysteria
Captured in the strangling embrace
...of predators and preys
...Presence is absent when the absence is present

Charged with misantrophy...
This is how we hunt!
