The sons of adam, the daughters of eve
All have bent down to the dust onto their knees
Anticipating the final asbsolution
The sweet, liberating execution

The flames have swallowed all hallowed
And the white gowns of the saints are now blood coloured
Pathetic whores of jehovah are oppressed
The lambs are slaughtered and christ bleeds of insest

ANNO SATHANI, ANNO SATHANI
ANNO SATHANI, THE YEAR OF BLASPHEMY
ANNO SATHANI, ANNO SATHANI
ANNO SATHANI, THE YEAR OF SODOMY

Behold! Your cross is burning
It will no longer bare your weight
In the name of the mighty persecutor
This is the sunset of christian faith

I laugh at the very annihilation of your kind
All fools going down with their "master mind"
We are bound by hellfire's seduction
As we pledge in the name of Desruction

ANNO SATHANI, ANNO SATHANI
ANNO SATHANI, THE YEAR OF SUFFERING
ANNO SATHANI, ANNO SATHANI
ANNO SATHANI, THE TIME OF AGONY

ANNO SATHANI, THE DAWN OF TRIUMPHANCY!!!
