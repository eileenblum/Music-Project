Hidden horrors strive from the inner mind
And all life is altered to sadness
Rapture is now the painted crime
Images are enriched with madness

I watched as it opened right before me
A vortex reflection of the mystery sea
Where pain and pleasure do collide
Where compassion shall never abide

Here no beast hides his face behind a mask
Here no hollow words are spoken
There breathes no forgiveness
No chains grow to be broken

This would no mortal creation ever bear
For the forlorn sins I hereby share
I am a part of this dark and demonic feast
The walls are laughing in the Temple Of The Beast

Give me wings and give me horns
Infest my heart with Thy morbid thorns
Blind my sight with the infernal flame
And I shall slaughter to honour Thy name
