[To say that fate is what you make of is not entirely true. There are certain paths you are drawn to and bound to tread even if you might fool yourself to think otherwise. We can drink now or be led to the water later on but at some point drink we must.]

Faceless faces behind masks of stone
boneless bones clad in burning robes
by hidden hands the wheels are turned
through words unsaid their purpose learnt

The paradox I live and breathe
I roam its fields in thought and dream

The silence within...
it hums your symphony
in the voice of thunder
your angels sing to me

Providence works in ways unknown
more obscure couldn't be its lantern's glow
yet by diverse means the web is spun
and all the paths I take in the end are one

Whichever is my role on Earth
with your scarlet thread my heart is girt

The silence within...
it hums your symphony
in the voice of thunder
your angels sing to me

And it all echoes throughout eternities
