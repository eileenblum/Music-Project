Enter through the door hiding in your dreams
Step forth and explore our domains with mesmerized eyes
Lift your hands towards us and invoke us from the deeps of your mind

Open your eyes to behold
The chalice is overflowing with blood
With the blood from your arms
Feel the thunders as they reach for you
Welcome them on your knees

Watch the shadows dance in that mist
Hear how a nightly hymn bewitches
And know that we are the ones who walk where stars never sleep
Under the eyes of the Superior One

Raging sound of the spiritstorm is closing in
Death is calling you to bathe in eternal sin
Tempting your most deepest desire
Soul to burn in the everflaming fire

Now, drink from the warm stream of your own blood
Break down your mortal bonds and blaspheme the worthless one
For your place is with us here where sun is never shown
And the obscurity gives you everything you seek
So you stand above the foolish and the weak

Enter through the door hiding in your dreams
Step forth and explore our domains with mesmerized eyes
Lift your hands toward us and invoke us from the deeps of your mind
Under the eyes of the Darkest One
