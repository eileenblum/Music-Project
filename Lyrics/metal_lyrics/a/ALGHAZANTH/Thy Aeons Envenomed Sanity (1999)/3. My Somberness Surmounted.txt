I close my eyes and your light is ignored
I entomb my memories and your words are forlorn
Subconscious walls imprison me no more
The blade runs upon my skin, my hands become sore

It must be the crasp of Death that pulls me under the surface, over and over again...

At last I'm setting myself apart from your useless ways
At last I forsake the burden you created for me
Your illusions are like dust to me
Just some reflections of worthlessness

Hate breathes within me
I see thousand times farther than any of you can
You failed to sense the harvest which you've become
You revealed me the weakness in man

Bitter sweet is this view of solitude
...take me but not my flesh...
Confused I am by all these dark emotions;
Am I to sink in these infinite black oceans?

I see cursed bodies dance around Devil's fire
My Dark Father! Receive me... complete me... impale me with immortality
