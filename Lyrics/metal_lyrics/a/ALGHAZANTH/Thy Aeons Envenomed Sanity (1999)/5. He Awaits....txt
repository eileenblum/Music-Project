Take a look beyond this mortal world
Can you see what awaits thereon?
Listen! Can you hear those voices call your name?
Different words but they all mean the same

Wooden gates are closing behind you
No turning back, walk onwards on your path
Coldwinds are blowing against your face
Be prepared to feel the most gruesome grace

A place where the fire has its lair
You can't turn away, you are already there
Burn with passion!

Let the mist move aside, let it clear your sight
Can you feel His presence?
Stars as His crown, mountains as His throne
This is your destiny for you are His own
He awaits...
