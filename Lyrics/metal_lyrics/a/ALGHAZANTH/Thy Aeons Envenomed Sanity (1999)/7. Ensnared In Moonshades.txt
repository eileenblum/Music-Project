Above the silvery shining surface of the water
Beneath the breath of the cruelest breeze
Through the foggy and untouchable blackness
 From the blackest rain that couldn't freeze
The shadows of my Lord approach

The touch of the evening mist, colouring views black for my eyes to see
The magical reign of the darkest infinity
Thee I praise, the Mightiest one
Proud I am to be Thy son
Come and bring Thy shadows to veil my existence

Let me become a permanent part of Thy kingdom
Let me drown in the shades of Thy greatness
May I feel Thy presence stronger than ever before
May Thy flame embrace me like the waves embrace the shore

Thou who art the ruler of the deepest
Thou art merciless to those who don't follow thy obscure paths
But never to Your sons and daughters

I give my life away and my soul is at Your hands...

I descend into images so dark and deep
As one with the night I sleep
With rejoice I die and fade away
For never again touches me the light of day

Now darkness remains as eternal to me
Blessed I am by His supremacy
For there is a star enthroned in the forbidden side of the sky
...and that star is I!
