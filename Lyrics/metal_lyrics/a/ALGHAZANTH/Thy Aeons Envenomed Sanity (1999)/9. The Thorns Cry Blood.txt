Peaceless is my grim existence
I am my own shadow, your tormentor
When the dark no longer slumbers
I will take your thoughts into the weeping veil of stars

Hear my hymn you lightseeking mortal
You can find the truth from these dark views
But by turning away only ignorance and weakness shall clothe your soul 

See me standing in the shades of the eclipse
Flames by my side, storm as my companion
I'm the one hidden behind the velvet mist
Watching you unwounded by the thorns of agony

Await no paradise, receive no salvation
Forget their lies, become true Damnation

Don't try to deny the attraction of infernal powers
Let them fill your within with their torturing pleasures

Haunting whispers silently piercing your mind
Follow me to the path of silence and thus I reveal you the answers you long for
Open your lightblinded eyes, kiss the seducing face of the night
See the thorns cry blood, feel my Masters might
