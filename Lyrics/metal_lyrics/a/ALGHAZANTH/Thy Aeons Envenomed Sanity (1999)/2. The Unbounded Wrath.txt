The sky has blessed us by revealing its obscure side
From which the stars look upon us, begging to be taken away
For we are the ones who already fell from amongst them, to weaken the light of day

With the reality of blade we'll cut the wings from your dreams
The mighty darkside mocks your saviour, laughs at his screams
We are the embodiment of war
We are the whip of Satan himself
We are the whirlwind upon your kind

Merciless towards you all we are
With all the pride of a fallen star

Suffer, you christian bastads
We'll force you to drink your own blood
And the last thing you'll realize will be the cruelness in our eyes

The sky has blessed us by revealing its obscure side
 From which the stars look upon us, begging to be taken away
For we are the ones who already fell from amongst them, to weaken the light of day

Shudder before the might of our Lord and His legions
Cry in pain when these claws of Death reach your heart
The wrath we hold within is strong enough to crush even mountains
Be ready to feel it, you'll all die on your fucking knees!
