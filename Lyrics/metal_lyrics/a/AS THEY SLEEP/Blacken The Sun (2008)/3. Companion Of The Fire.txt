Here's to the confrontation
here's to the sleepless nights
companion of the fire
I will unearth the lies
I see inside
betrayal confide

Why live in fear
I shed no tears
lie to your peers
so insincere

you failed, you failed so miserably
but I'm still standing
control, control this energy
for it consumes me

Just try
what once was lost is now gone forever
to see through my eyes
what once was trust now replaced with anger

This anger it burns from within
fueled by your ignorance
the closer we get to the end
scarred by your own regrets

No more will I be blinded
thus taken for a fool
despite all good intentions
of what I thought I once knew
I can't change time
you've crossed the line

Why live in fear
I shed no tears
lie to your peers
so insincere

you failed, you failed so miserably
but I'm still standing
control, control this energy
for it consumes me

Just try
what once was lost is now gone forever
to see through my eyes
what once was trust now replaced with anger
