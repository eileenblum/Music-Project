Now here I stand before you
say what you've got to say
you've passed your judgment unto me
lost my respect today

What is this so called safety
don't say it won't affect me
there is a price for freedom
a price but who will pay

Swallow my pride look up at sky
decide whats important in this life
hearing your voice is fuel to the fire
I sift through the ashes and the lies

Bred to sew the seeds of hate
bred to shred and destroy me
is this the way we must live
to learn how to take and not give

Split the chest of this nation
expose all that's absurd
open to exploitation
I lay my trust in the word

Swallow my pride look up at sky
decide whats important in this life
hearing your voice is fuel to the fire
I sift through the ashes and the lies

Bred to sew the seeds of hate
bred to shred and destroy me
is this the way we must live
to learn how to take and not give

Testing my faith its not going to change

Now that I know you
I with that I never knew at all
now I can see who
who's gonna catch me when I fall

Now that I know you
now I can see who
I with that I never knew at all
now that I know you
now I can see who
who's gonna catch me when I fall

Bred to sew the seeds of hate
bred to shred and destroy me
is this the way we must live
to learn how to take and not give

Now here I stand before you
say what you've got to say
you've passed your judgment unto me
lost my respect today
