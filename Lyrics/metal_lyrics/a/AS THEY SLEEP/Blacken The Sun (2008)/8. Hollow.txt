You're free to go
no remorse for the precious lives
that you've left behind
the tears have dried
but your soul is soaking wet
with the past you hide

So many questions unanswered
so many thoughts fill my mind
soon will be your time to suffer
and burn with the likes of your kind
where innocent souls meet destruction
marks the end of a life I never knew
we cry as we look to the heavens
clench teeth in disgust at the thought of you
disgust at the thought of you

Left in our minds
is a hollow spot that was once full of happiness
and now we turn
to the ones that can help replace them with hope and bliss

clench my teeth

In time we will become whole inside
once again
oh lord have mercy on our souls
once again

I could never feel the pain
nor could you ever explain
I must pray to keep me sane
I never had the chance
to know part of my past
my past

where innocent souls meet destruction
marks the end of a life I never knew
we cry as we look to the heavens
clench teeth in disgust at the thought of you
disgust at the thought of you
