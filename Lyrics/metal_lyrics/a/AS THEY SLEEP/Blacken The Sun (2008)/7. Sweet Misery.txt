Evil

I let you inside my life
my heart
my soul felt so complete
I reminisce those days and memories
of all the things she used to say
your existence dead to me
dead to me

A magnificent creation
we never thought to question why
misery consumes our lives

My sweet angel of grace
take me so far from this place

All hope is lost
I've nothing left for you
I wash my hands of a life that was untrue
behold she dwells in misery
so help me God I'll find my way
find my way

I love you I hate you
I can see through you

Destroying all those things I held so dear
its funny how this time you act sincere
goodbye I've lost the will to try
I'll see you in the afterlife
afterlife

My sweet angel of grace
take me so far from this place
