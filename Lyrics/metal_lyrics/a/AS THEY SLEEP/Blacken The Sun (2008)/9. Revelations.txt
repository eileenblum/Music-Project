Who will repent for all your sins
we fight the war that no one wins
a mothers tears the devils grin
a fathers pride torn from within
to live to die
to laugh to cry
we give we take
we love we hate
can't take this any more

Anymore
is this what we've become
and yet we try once again
to wash this blood off of our hands

And when the star falls to the earth
you've lost the window of rebirth
a great abyss
a locusts sting
blacken the sun
a wrath to bring
war torn how can we escape this horror
reborn
a chance to change this all forever

Anymore
is this what we've become
and yet we try once again
to wash this blood off of our hands

Look and behold a white horse
look and behold a pale horse
we've sought to conquer all or die

Worthy is the lamb who was slain
