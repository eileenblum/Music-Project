Memories left in time
give me the strength to move on
accept the loss of reason
to find find a way
to say farewell and not goodbye

So many questions lie
within the depths of our past
we keep reinventing wheels
await the day
no longer sacrifice

Time slipping away this is all too real
can't explain the way this makes me feel
I'll never say I didn't try
I can't sit back and watch you die

I shall not sell my soul in vein
hold on so gracefully

Everything in life shall drift away
hold on to what's true to you

We, we shall be stripped of all our flesh
we, we shall stand up and rise against

Time slipping away this is all too real
can't explain the way this makes me feel
I'll never say I didn't try
I can't sit back and watch you die

Embrace Insanity
as it courses through my veins

Read between the lines
as we corrupt our minds
we see unrelenting greed
I see your face
and it sickens me
mass hypocrisy
making its way to me
sit back watch it bleed the dream
inducing hate
another casualty

Time slipping away this is all too real
can't explain the way this makes me feel
I'll never say I didn't try
I can't sit back and watch you die

I shall not sell my soul in vein
just hold on tight for one more day
hold on so gracefully

Everything in life shall drift away
hold on to what's true to you
