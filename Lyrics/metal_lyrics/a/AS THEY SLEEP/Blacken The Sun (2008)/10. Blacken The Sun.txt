Behold the light
as we all watch a storm of souls
unveil the flashes of our lives
a dawn of death
embrace the parasites
in which the world we all once knew
becomes a kataklysmic tomb

They feed
unto our weakness
unmercifully
so dark the con of man
take heed and see
a better part of thee
can't you foresee
your cursed eternity
eternity

Will it fulfill the prophecy
into the heavens shall we gaze
make way the coming of the king
or is it death you seek

Who will prevail
as war is waged for seven years
will you be lovers of yourselves
embrace the plague
as the last trumpets sound
when death runs rampant in your mind
its death you shall not find

They feed
unto our weakness
unmercifully
so dark the con of man
take heed and see
a better part of thee
can't you foresee
your cursed eternity
eternity

Will it fulfill the prophecy
into the heavens shall we gaze
make way the coming of the king
or is it death you seek

Into the void of untangeable strife
born of weakness
fallen victim to filth and disease
contradiction and perils
shall humble the fall to your knees
to your knees

They feed
unto our weakness
unmercifully
so dark the con of man
take heed and see
a better part of thee
can't you foresee
your cursed eternity
eternity

Will it fulfill the prophecy
into the heavens shall we gaze
make way the coming of the king
or is it death you seek
