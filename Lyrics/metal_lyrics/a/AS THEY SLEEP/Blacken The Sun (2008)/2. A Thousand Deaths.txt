Trapped in this life together
as we struggle each and every day
will it ever get any better
time will tell our fate
search for deliverance
anything to take the pain away
fight for the answers
sign your life away

How can we be
so blind that we cannot see
that happiness is
so far from being free

To have the life
I'd die a thousand times
what makes this world go 'round
only corrupts our minds
we give you take
can't take this anymore
the rich keep getting richer
the poor keep living poor

Time will tell our fate

Can't be pushed much further
every man has the right to change his ways
deception not the answer
make the sacrifice
plow through the faithless
spit in the face of agony
its time to take back
take back what you gave

How can we be
so blind that we cannot see
that happiness is
so far from being free

To have the life
I'd die a thousand times
what makes this world go 'round
only corrupts our minds
we give you take
can't take this anymore
the rich keep getting richer
the poor keep living poor

Time will tell our fate

Darkness controls all of man
a life that we've built upon sand
tuning whats left of this place
into a life of eternal disgrace
a race to be God among men
greed will consume all it can
damnation a certain demise
looking for truth in the midst of a lie
darkness controls all of man
a life that we've built upon sand
tuning whats left of this place
into a life of eternal disgrace

who will decide your self worth
