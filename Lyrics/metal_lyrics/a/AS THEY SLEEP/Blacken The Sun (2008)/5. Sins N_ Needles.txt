You've got to pay for
consequences brought forth by anger
you got to take more
more time to reconcile and break free

He who walks in the shadows
holds onto the ice cold hand of death
I've seen the aftermath
just as sure as you'll pay for all you sins
just when you think its impossible
you gain the nerve to go down that road again
re-open whats been done before
an insatiable love that never ends

Start blaming yourself
stop blaming the world
stop blaming all the ones who pray for you
just open your eyes
and meet your demise
and fight with all the strength you have inside

You can lead a horse to water
but you can't make it drink it's sins away
you follow the steps of your father
will you ever be who you want to be
rip out the shame and rebuild your soul
own up to the blood that once was shed
so precious so beautiful
to be given the chance to live again

Start blaming yourself
stop blaming the world
stop blaming all the ones who pray for you
just open your eyes
and meet your demise
and fight with all the strength you have inside

Rise to your feet and justify
the truth of a lie
Search in your soul to say goodbye

Why live the lie
is it worth all the pain and anguish
try one more time
take control of your so called life

Start blaming yourself
stop blaming the world
stop blaming all the ones who pray for you
just open your eyes
and meet your demise
and fight with all the strength you have inside
