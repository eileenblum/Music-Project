O blessed are the souls
Who escaped the battle fields and walk in spite of all their woes
The sacred birds are feeding on the flesh of those left dead and gone
son of Zeus thy hated one
Words cannot describe the hate that lies behind your eyes 
Thy will
Beseeched
What are you fighting for
Thy will
Beseeched
Relentless god of war 
The gods of Olympus look down upon your soiled crown
Your time in hell awaits for the lives that you've put down 
Pulled by steeds of fire
With your bloodthirsty desire
Waging war on all who cross your path
God forbid your bloody wrath
They pray the gods to take your life
This plague of never ending strife
With mortal men and gods alike
Left screaming for their lives 
Battlelust
Watch Athens fall to dust
Battlelust
The elder gods no longer trust
Battlelust
Must war take all of us 
Unmerciful thou art
This cruel Olympian
You are the god of war
