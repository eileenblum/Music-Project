Arise thy king
O ruler of Rhine
Devastation lust for war 
A perilous quest to conquer the West 
I long for the days of the innocence
We've pushed them away
Barbaric be thy name
We've pushed them away 

Tattoo your face for war
The scourge of God
Anything goes as I raise my sword 
Chastise
My brother's demise 
An endless conquest for more
An unsettled score
Why haven't we learned from our mistakes 
Why put on the crown of thorns
Why waste your time
Its all been done before
