To the republic for which it stands
We have sacrificed and met demands
The rhetoric of a sovereign nation
The searing screams of exasperation  
If logic is the money of the mind
Than clearly we have spent ourselves blind
Unite Unite  
Depreciate the American dollar
Magnify this quest for power
Alas when everything is said and done
Who will be the anointed one
It's so easy just to push the blame
When at stake is a politician's fame
It's so easy just to push the blame
And bring on endless suffering 
Have we not learned from yesterday
Or are we blinded by hypocrisy
Have we not learned from yesterday
Tempers flaring every word that you say
Have we not learned from yesterday
You cannot finance destiny 
The art of losing
Is not hard to master
It's so plain to see
That we are falling faster 
Aim your guns high
You have to learn to walk before you learn to fly
Aim your guns high
You have to learn to walk before you learn to fly
Aim your guns high
But when the bullets fall back to earth they may take your life 
To the republic for which it stands
We have sacrificed and met demands
The rhetoric of a sovereign nation
The searing screams of exasperation
One nation under God
That doesn't seem to be the case
One nation under fraud
Emancipate this dying race
