Summoned by the winds on the primeval ocean
Under the waves the earth's creation 
Deities of a dead world
The gods formed their pantheon
This place
This Mesoamerica
Seeks desperate divination  
What was your obsession with time and sacrifice 
Bloodletting
Clouds of black smoke
A burning blood offering
All in attempts to speak to the vision serpents
A Mayan offering to hear the serpent sing 
Rise and fall
Who's meant to have it all 

Calendars of the ancient
A cascade of catastrophe
The collapse
Both natural and man made
Astronomical prophecy  
Scarred by time
