1-30-33
A reign this world could not foresee
Into the mind of a fascist leader
And the birth of a deadly regime 
Eradicate
Burned to ash there was no escape 
As he rose to power
Approach the final hours
Behold the holocaust has come to take your lives
How could this come to be
Propaganda make believe
This Aryan master race
The ashes tell no lies 
Children cry out
From starvation
No sympathy
For God's creation
Children cry out
Suffocating
No sympathy
Death was waiting 
Lest we forget
This evil anti-semitic
As bodies filled the streets
Forever etched in memories
These final days
Have set the bar for all to raise
A withered shell
You've crawled your way to the pits of hell 
The horror
The terror
Your lifeless body lays
Known as nothing but a coward for the rest of days
For the rest of days
The horror
The terror
Your lifeless body lays
Known as nothing but a coward
Coward
