Beyond the shadows of your deepest doubts
Above the bluest seas
Lies a kingdom we have willingly died for
A true land of the free

Lift up these broken battered soulds
We cannot do this on our own

Where will we go?
What shall we see?
Lose your grip on reality
Open your mind
Fall to your knees
Embrace eternity

I hear the angels singing
Thy purest gifts they're bringing
Take now your righteous seat at the throne of theocracy

The days of sufferng shall soon be over
The word hath been received
For we are here
Our cup runneth over
Is this not destiny?
It's not worth fighting for
A world of senseless war
Lay down your battle sword and open up your eyes
