Throughout history we've sought our questions answered
Seeking immortality
Seeking darkness at the same time we ignore the light
Provoking the unseen 
The god of the underworld has you in sight
Raping your soul
Unmerciful master of brimstone and fire
Devouring all 
There is no escaping the god of the dead
You've made your bed
Now it's time you've slept in it 
Demon of dreams
Life is not all that it seems
Leading the blind through your passage of screams
The oracle of the dead
A shrine to lay your head 
Into obscurity denying heaven's light
Falling to your knees
The path you've chosen is a hell you can't describe
This evil deity
