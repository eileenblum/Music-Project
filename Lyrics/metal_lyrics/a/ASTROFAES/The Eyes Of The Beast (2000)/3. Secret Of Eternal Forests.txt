Oh, symbol of the Ancient Wood!
Huge sarcofage,
Where time buried the past glory!
Passed so heavy way.
To the source of wisdom of past centuries
Bow knees before you,
With whole soul absorbed your power,
And dark, and glory!
Silence, the memory of past centuries!
Devastation and night!
I see, I see this power,
All is dim before her.
Where fell the heroes - 
To storm the green of wood,
Where rustled wings of eagle - 
Turned the black raven.
So this forest, century trees,
Thicking hills and blackened stones - 
A sole, what remained to us?
The near echo hoots, from depth of woods.
Spread a real voice to devote:
"We are imperious above the hearts of giants,
The masters and geniuses of Earth!
We still keep our power and glory,
Not all magic that is hidden
in us has disappeared,
Not all the visions, secrets and legends,
Not all remembrances, that have covered
Us by a tenacious and hidden attire,
And the unearthly glory fills heart!"
