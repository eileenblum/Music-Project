The light pierces my eyes
The horns' blow, fluid bronze blade
The calling scream. The other worlds'
Birds speak to us.
Spread out, the light of fire,
The light of the sacrifice. And
the lungs inhale the smoke
In a corporal form - 
Like an eagle divided in half
I am, alive.
And as that eagle I am living, Gods!
Will I be the whole one or divided for You?
Whistle of winter storm,
And summer squall in tops of the oak.
Wind, let your Sons
Roam in the steppe
But for my Sons it destined to see
The red Crimson light of sunset
That is blood and pain of my Land.
