Black forest tops has minged with the skies, and only grass trembling scarcely
West gleams with the scarlet afterglow, birds and animals are quiet with fear
Every sound has faded suddenly, no any rustle to hear
Earth's hands has touched to the strings, celestial lyre has uttered a moan
The sounds of beyond is singing now, severe fire burns my soul
The heart is all in sick, the heart is like dried away
River of fire runs through my veins, tears has dried upon the dull glance
The speech has froze on the cold lips, let the heaven's vaults do blast with thunder
The flame alive, burn the abyss!
