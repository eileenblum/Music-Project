I stood, all surrounded with gloom, there was only black shadows around me
The moon rose over the horizon, and the stars reflected in my eyes
And listening I had a feeling, the earth is choking, the smell of burn
And sweet'n'sour taste of death, the moon reflects bloody gleams
In the quiet of the silence, no solitude shall be
For here are buried forever, those whom one shall not forget
Their souls piercing the skies of black, the icy moon, the sea of bright stars
Fills night with its deadened light, of rays of pain and fire
The time of prophet's visions has filled my spirit
The thoughts that never can get ease, like a blood wasted steel
A wind, the sigh of Stribog, the hill is the name of the fallen
Black mist in the high, the mystery in the dark of the world.
