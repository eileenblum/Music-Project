And your spirit shall be alone, deep sleep in dark forests
Let spirit keeps the silence, you're alone but not forgotten
Death was beside you in your life, death is beside you in your death
Do believe in it's power! Bright night shall look frown
And only shining of the stars will not be dull
I will remind you of your destiny, the thoughts you can't get off
The visions you can't scatter away from your spirit, the sighs of Gods.
The distant wind the roar, the mists on the grey swamps
And shadow keeps its gloom, and misery of death
