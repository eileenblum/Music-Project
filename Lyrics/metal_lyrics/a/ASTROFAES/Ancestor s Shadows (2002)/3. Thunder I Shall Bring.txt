Following the thunder and the flashes of lightning, upon the way that is revealed to them only
Where upon the skythrone, rod rules the law, I came to this land
Where's no light, no dark, no time, steppes and ravines, forest's oceans.
The oak-giants, the fragile birches, the sea is rising to the heaven
Within it's fire burns the flame, my spirit soars over free land
Trembling my chest, proclaim the song of Gods unmeasurable dusk
A shadow of unknown past, the woods open the gates to adepts
Black clouds is gathered in the burning sky, THUNDER!
And blackest gloom the fall, my spirit shool this earth with storm
Sorrows of past and glory of future, grey covered gloom
Dripping light-drops upon my heart.
