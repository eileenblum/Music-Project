Fire approaches and there's nowhere to hide, the fiery cross swallowing us
It burns, closing away my skies, the fiery dew dripping from it
Sky is torn apart, and the cross of fire still burns
And our sons is burning in, and rays as nails has been nailed in our souls
How to escape from this blizzard? No escape, and the cross of fire chases after us
A stamp. A knock. The hooves throwing sparkles, the road is all covered with pools
Beated with tears, there's crosses and crucifixes on the eternal road.
