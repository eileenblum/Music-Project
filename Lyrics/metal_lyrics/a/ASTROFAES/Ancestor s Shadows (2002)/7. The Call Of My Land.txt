I hear the voice, my land is calling me, and that call is enemy's sword in the heart
Murmur of the oaks and moans of the forests, screams of the rivers, and weeping of the streams
And a dumb look of the lakes so green, is bringing the news of my enemies to me.
Black are their clothes, greedy are their beasts-like looks
They have the law of sword, they have the fight of blood
My Land, let me ease your pain, let me give you strength
The forest is embraced with wrathful noise, and I can see the ray of your dawn
With sun it shall gleam on the steel, when it's time for war.
