Land is soak up blood by ages
All is forever here
Where sun forever goes
Where fires was burning
Where sunset still live

Step by step... in chaos of unbeing
Step by step... in abyss of darkness

Fear for fear
We're was laid in fear
Blood for blood
We're was wanted by blood
We're live in fear... life of illusions

Dying emotions domain
Here hate is respect
Here power no for turning back
Here power and might for stand above

Difficult way through the fear and pain
Strong, be a stronger!
Bold, be a bolder!
Let's hell burning red,
The sky is denied

Land is soak up blood by ages
All is forever here
Strong, be a stronger!
Bold, be a bolder!
Breaking the light

Dying emotions domain
...Rise above... upward...
