And only night give me salvation
From the sunlight of ruthless
And only moonlight reflections
Give me deliverance from the horrors of days

At nightfall my mind becomes clear
My body start fills by power
(power of supernatural)
It's was given by Black Gods

Beast is come out from lair
Ancient instincts are filling my mind
Nature is call me to unite
To unite with her at midnight

Liberty!

Fullmoon light
He coming out from the thicket
He demand
That yoke of the sun will be broken

(...demand the clearance from the horror of sun...)

"Let my Black Gods stay with me!
From the white light
Let they set us free!

We're will together break yoke of sun
We're will together going to stars
We're will together ruling this world
And nothing will can break us!"

Liberty!
