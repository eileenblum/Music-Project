On the east a new light rise again
From darkness
Let stars, daughters of heavens
The path will shining for a man
They are alight together
And fly about from one place

Come to oneself where power of the law
Gods was going

Wake up!
Do you hear a noise of surf?
They are alight together
As summer lighting
Stars is burning

Black heavens by clear shadows
They are clear and bright is cover up

"Gods, give me the children!
Burning daughters of heavens, give me the riches!
Come to oneself beneath the defence
We're will becoming fathers of bold sons
Gods will giving that... heavens and earth"
