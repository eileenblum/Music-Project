[ÐÐ»ÑÐº Ð½ÐµÐ½Ð°Ð²Ð¸ÑÑÐ¸]

The rise of the scarlet sun. the thoughts awakening the spirit.
With the dawn the understanding comes.
Born by fires and ring of the hammer
He is fed with the sweat and bloody milk.
War  both life and death.
War  both knowledge and the void.
War  both scream and silence.
War  both fiery flames and darkness of the earth.
The one who was bearing for centuries the banner of glory and honour,
Would find his halls he is near the starkest spirit.
He would howl of hunger and freeze to death without flesh or blood.
But once the time would come he'll become free.
