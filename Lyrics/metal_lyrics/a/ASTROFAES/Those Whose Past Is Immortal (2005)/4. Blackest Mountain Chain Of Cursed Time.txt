The flesh was pierced by wildest revenge. the veins were torn unto the bleeding mess.
Of steel and wrath  the unity of hatred. a scarlet fog in thy eternal search for wisdom.
Where time is nothing...  and all the consciousness is just a scum.
The truth is hidden behind the hills of black.
The mountain chain of time. the curse of silent scream.
The shadows would be gone, behind horizon far. and this ghastly whisper would now remain alone.
And no one ever would return from battlefield just worm eaten bones and empty eyes of skulls
Under the raven screech the ancient woods would sprout through them.
This blackest mountain chain stained with bloody wounds...
And ruined by the rotten roots.
