Away, far away the wolf packs are gone.
Deep, even deeper the thoughts, ideas and knowledge are buried.
Closer and closer now are the clouds of dead crows.
If you would take a handful of leaves only rot you will see.
If the for the roots you would dig. only dust you would find reason is torn to pieces,
And the flesh is shattered i was chasing a wild she-wolf
Have you seen her eyes? the true hatred and fear.
And there is no way to feel the taste of this life,
If you never felt these two emotions at once.
From the bared fangs the liquid spit was running down
And from her throat the silent howl escaped.
Horror in her eyes and boundless might in her flesh. they will return...
Either by life's order or by death's threats.
