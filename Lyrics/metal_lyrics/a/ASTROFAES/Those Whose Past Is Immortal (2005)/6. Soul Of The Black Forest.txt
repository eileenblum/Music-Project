In the fog of the lifeless dusk black apparitions of the past arise.
Fly as a flaming storm the bloody shades of the eternal thoughts.
Feel the cold  the nails of the icy fear pierce your every remained thought.
Endless, unbearable run. if you fall  you're dead.
And these roots try to suck your strength,
These branches tend to pluck your soul through eyes.
Dead forest. without end or beginning.
Black forest. the domain of the ancient souls.
Take a step into its borders. you won't find nor path.
Thickets, wind-fallen trees and swamps.
The shade of the raven and an endless echo...
