Pain of my soul
Is embraced with the roots
Of the Ancient oaks
The abyss of forest dust
The high of heaven's water
Vast oceans of the forest
The look of eagle alone the heaven side
I turned to all this
Sunbeam was fading
Where no one else has been I was
The others left the black back water
Their spirit is dead forever
Let my scream wake up
All those who left in swamps and thickets
Those times has gone
But I'll never have the rest
My soul rather shall like eagle soar
Than be oppressed by shade of sadness.
