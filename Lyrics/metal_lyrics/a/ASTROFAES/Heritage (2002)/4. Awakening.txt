The spirit is awoken by Eternity rays
Icy wind was breathing in the dark
The moon was calling by the cold look
The world was lying spread under the sky
In the sea of rays that swirled
Its golden gleam over soul
The spirit who's house is there
In the deep sky
Wings of gloom has spread over the vale
The mist-like forest gleams
In blind tears of mist
No single ray shall shine
Over the long night
The land shall hoot of thousands alarm bells
The swords-like lightnings
shall cut the night
And mad fire shall burn
Stand up from your knees
Take this sparkle
The look. It is the first look of fire
Your call. That call in the distance
Grows up into the long hum
The hum of free land's birth.
