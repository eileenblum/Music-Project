Look! There Gods has rose their throne
Where's our ancestors' dust
In the mist, like in bonfire's smoke
Where all heroes went
Into the shadows land
Those battles I remember
I feel the adversity's approach
I cannot close my eyes
The lightning's light was scarlet
In the midnight
It tore the black clouds
I heard the war horns howl
And storm of moan screamed
In impenetrable darkness
About the battles on my earth
My great spirit soared
And eagered for the battle
To the freedom
Reaching the spirit's freedom
The way of heart to inherit the glory
The times of past eternal call
Only the time set free my flight
And I rushed in the land of shadows
Of mist and sacred fire
