After the awakening in the forest
It seemed you're forgotten
This world  free and nameless
Is before your thoughts
With greatest power
The visions appearing
You reminding the names
Of every river
Every tree
And every hill
The moment will come
In icy stillness
In the black forest's thicket
You'll hear your name
Forgotten with ages.
