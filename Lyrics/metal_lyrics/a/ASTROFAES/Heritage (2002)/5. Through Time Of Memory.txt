Life flows like a violent stream
The world may die with me only
It is in my heart
Bound with rains and dews are my days
Spiteful belief does beats in their hearts
In this world full of lies
With every cell we're mingled
With every feeling
And with every nerve
We're bound
Time rushes to memories
My heart soar and vanishes
On the eternal ways
There's too much fire
The pain burns me through
The scars of earth
Unhealed wounds of Fathers
With the blood and the steel
Eternity overfilled my look.
