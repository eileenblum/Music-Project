[Music by: AndrÃ© Matos / Hugo &amp; Luis Mariutti]

What if you could unlock your dreams?
Could you perceive what they mean?
The nights are clear,the days so dark
But there's a way out there...

Whatever comes into your mind
May be the answers trapped inside
You feel a cold cut through your veins
But there's a way out there...

Alone you go into the darkness

You feel the fear of someone else
A broken picture from the past
The feeling traces in your hands
But there's a way out there...

Alone you go into the darkness

What you're searching for...
Struggling for your sanity
Is knocking at your door...
Dream inside reality!

The more you will find,
The less you will get...
Last tears never cried
Will drown you in the end
You've got nowhere to hide
You've got nothing to give
Who'll rescue now you will to live?

Along your life you never felt on inch of pain
Because you never realized you're still the same!
You ask me why but I'm afraid to let you know
I was your pride that made you fall so far below...

What you're searching for (...)

"The more I could find
The less I could get
Tears never cried
Drowned me in the end
I spread nothing but lies
I had no love to give
Who'll rescue my will to live?"
