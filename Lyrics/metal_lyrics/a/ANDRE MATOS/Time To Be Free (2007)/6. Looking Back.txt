[Music by: AndrÃ© Matos / Hugo Mariutti]

I thought you'd last forever
But like a star,you never would
A stairway on the rainbow
I wish that I knew
Your silhouette surrounds me
I miss the way things used to be
Your voice floats in the wind
How I wish you were here...

Solitude is taking over!
By the way,
So many things I kept from you till now
Stand by me,
Reach out for my hand and I will follow!

Beyond this time I'm living now,
I'm ever looking back at you
And when it rains upon the green fields,
I'll be thinking about you..

Remember how it feels now
You taught me freedom with few words
The beauty of this world was
All pointed by you

Solitude is taking over!
By the way,
So many things I kept from you till now
Stand by me,
Reach out for my hand and I will follow!

Beyond this time I'm leaving now
I'm ever looking back at you
And when it rains upon the green fields,
I'll be thinking about you...

Beyond this time (...)

I knew one day you had to leave me
Still I'll walk on with you...
