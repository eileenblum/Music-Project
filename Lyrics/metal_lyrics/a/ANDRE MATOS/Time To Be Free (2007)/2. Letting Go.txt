[Music By: AndrÃ© Matos / Pit Passarel / Hugo &amp; Luis Mariutti]

A brand new day at last is born
The first wave breaks on the shore
The sun's shining bright
Across the centuries of pain
My heart is rising again
Did you hear all my cries?

I'm on the edge to turn away
I can't explain
But I don't want to be alone
It's in the air,it's in my face,it's everywhere
I'd like to know how to carry on...

I ask myself in the end:
_Was everybody just lying
Right from the start?
And if you're longing to be free
You better think of a way
To find some love in your heart

I'm on the edge to turn away
I can't explain
But I don't want to be alone
It's in the air,it's in my face,it's everywhere
And now I know how to carry on!

I'm falling with the rain
I'll meet you once again,
Set me free!
I'm flying to ever more
But I won't fly alone
Can't you feel me letting go?

A moment like a million more,
Let me hold it for a while!

Just strangers now or have we met before?
I's up to you to treat me well
Or throw me on the floor
There's a reason why we live and die
In the end only our footprints stay behind...

There's a time for love,a time for pain
Have you seen how pictures melt down
With the sky?

Letting go,letting go...
