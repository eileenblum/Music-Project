[Music by: AndrÃ© Matos]

Life storm broke my anchors
And like a wreek I've been
Sea and sky were just one darkness
Such a brilliant radiance...You came!

I'm alive,I'm alive...
Just by the light from your eyes!

Life storm freed my anchors
Many shores,I've seen
Sea and sky,they gave me shelter
Now we only meet in dreams

I'm alive,I'm alive...
Just by the light from your eyes!

And I need you to be
Like the haven that I seek

But clouds showed me and I saw!
You were just the moonlight...
And the moon belong...To no one!

Suddenly,I stare and see
The light in you still shines on me
Pouring down,endlessly...
