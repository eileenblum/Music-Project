[Music by: AndrÃ© Matos / Fabio Ribeiro]

The aftermath of disaster
Strikes down to the earth
Time is life's destroyer
A transitional mixing
Commercing us all
As we split forever in two
And the wheels keep turning...

Suspended in time
As you glide through the air
See your body below you
Feelings no longer hurt,
No more fears within
Let me fly together with you
And the wheels keep turning...

Stand forever in the rain
Watch the sun
Break through the sky
If this world has let you down
Take a leap to higher ground
Cause your heart will never die!

Conscience wakes to remind you
The rule of the game
There's no turning back now
You'll became someone else
You perceptions will change
Let me change forever with you
And the wheels keep turning...

Stand forever in the rain (...)

These nights of thunder
Won't come back
Just disappeared
These nights of thunder,so dark
Mode visions become clear!

Endeavour always
Leads so far
Beyond the scene
Endeavour always sows love...
The struggle ends up here!
