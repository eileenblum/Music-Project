[Music by: AndrÃ© Matos / Hugo &amp; Luis Mariutti]

Falling drops against the window
I took a while to feel awake
Moving clouds is this dream never end
Memories haunt me again
Hear a voice
It sounds like water
Visions make me slip away

All around,the forest growls
While the whispers fill my head
Falling down into a stream of ages
Visions make me slip away

That every day,
I realized the fire burning
Out,as far as I could see
I feel into a silent morning
It's hard to tell,but I say:
Whatever it was,it makes me fear
Invisible for the rest
But I recall it all so clear

These times of joy,these times of wonder
Like a lost edge inside our dreams
It makes me wonder:
What is life,what does it mean?

Rise again,
For your fate will always follow you
No more cries,no hurt and pain
See the future like never before

Undress your sorrow
Leave the past all behind
Time to be free!

Falling drops against the window
I took a while to feel awake
Moving clouds is this dream never ends...

Sounds,they pierce through like an arrow
Hear my voice,it beats like rain
Memories,I'll carry them away...

These times of joy,these time of wonder (...)

Time to be free,give me time to be free...
I need some time to be free
