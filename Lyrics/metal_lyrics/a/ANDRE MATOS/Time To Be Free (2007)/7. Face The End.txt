[Music by: AndrÃ© Matos / Alberto Rionda]

I decided to come here
To tell you what I never could!
In the end we're not the same,
I'm tired of being misunderstood

All I need is to break free
Like my spirit used to be

Too many nights
I thought of you
But now there's nothing I can do...

Forgive me but I'll say the truth:
It's time to face the end!
What goes around
Comes around back to you,
Forgive me but I'll say the truth...

See the scars deep in your face,
Feel the thorns around your heart
All that's gone now stays behind,
There's no need to fall apart

All I want is to run free
With no shadows over me

So far away
Though standing near
I know these words are hard to hear!

Forgive me but I'll say the truth:
It's time to free the end!
What goes around
Comes around straight to you,
Forgive me but I'll say the truth...

Would you pledge absolution to me now?
Will you throw away your armour?
Or will it go on and on with you?

Forgive me but I'll say the truth...

Forgive me but I'll say it
There's nothing left to stop me
Forgive me but I'm over you!
