As the universe expands
And high flames are burning
As the light breaks through the haze
And sunrays melt away the snow

The streams get out of control
For we don't own life

It's a fact: we're born to stray
On this deadly journey
We don' know where it begins
And nobody tells where it goes

The wheels just roll down the road
Is there still a chance?

We're alive - that's all we can say
We must stay alert through the night
Side by side, let's keep hand in hand
And wait for the turn of the lights...
The turn of the lights!
