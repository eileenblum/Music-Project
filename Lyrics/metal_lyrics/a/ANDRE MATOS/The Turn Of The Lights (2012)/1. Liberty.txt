Story of life
Story of fate
Something I could've done and now I feel
I've lost myself in time

A picture of those
Beyond control
Hearts messed up, abide,
And so I hear
Spirits weep out loud

Living for my next step
Swinging across the border line
I wanna climb those stairs
And reach the top now

You brought me what I need
Addictive heroin
You sucked my heart, still you want everything
Melting flesh and bone
I don't know what you are
I don't know where I've been
Just look behind and see the shadow
Of a one-day-promisse

Come for a ride
In the kingdom of light
Most of us don't care to sign the deal
When evil hangs around

Heading for my last step
Running across the border line
I wanna stand and stare...

You brought me what I need
Addictive heroin
You sucked my heart, still you want everything
Melting flesh and bone
Whole days and nights in vain
Unplug and mute the pain
These matted eyes now miss the last glare
Of a one-day-promisse
