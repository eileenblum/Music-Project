Northern lights dance in the air
Nature paints its scenes
Haunting the winter sky
The wild is so vast,
The air quiet and still
Today a new sun will rise

Weâll be together when the time comes around
Weâll save our prayers and never say farewell
Far becomes close;
Scary, divine
A sudden blaze reveals the course of life

I walk in the night
Counting the stars, in silence
With tears in my eyes
But Iâll never surrender

Weâll be together when the time comes around
Weâll save our prayers and never say farewell
Nothing to fear,
Nowhere to hide
Nobody escapes the course of life
