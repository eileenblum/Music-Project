When a shade follows my footsteps at night
That could be you
I descend to the riverside
As Iâm staring at the blackened water flow
I sense you getting close
I know youâre getting close

I could reach my hand
And fool my heart one more time
I could stick to what remainsâ¦
Itâs helpless: our future is behind us!

- You say that you go, you donât go
And you never leave a choice
- You say that you need, you donât need
Though thereâs urgency in your voice

Youâve been searching for happiness
But emptiness youâve found

You say that you go
You think you belong - no, you donât
Youâre still living on your own

Is there a future for me?
Is there a hope?
Sometimes illusions, they drown
And dreams are gone with the flood
