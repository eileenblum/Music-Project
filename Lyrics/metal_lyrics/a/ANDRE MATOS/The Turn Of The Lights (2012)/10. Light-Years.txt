Unleash the beast you used to be
Let go off, and set it free
Relieve your heart, let it breathe

Forget the place you used to know
Get ready for a miracle
Straightening the curve of the road

From this time, from this day
You'll never be the same
Leave behind what's insane
And let it fade away
You can still count on me
From the past, nothing remains
It's light-years away

When you just listen to the words
From someone who wants to take hold
Of your will, of your thoughts,
Of your mind and soul

People who've lost their own life
Normally try to get by
Inside your world, to lead you on,
They cherish when you fall...
