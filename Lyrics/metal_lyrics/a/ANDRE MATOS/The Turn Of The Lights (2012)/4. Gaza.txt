Someday I
Will feel enough
To remember
Whatâs gone
And I will live enough
To be humming
This song

Someday I will
Rejoin your soul
When fire stars
Are falling down on me

Let the clouds
And let the rain
Pour red tears down
Today

Let the heart
And let the pain
Flow away
Away

Feel what is over
Feel what is dead
Your smile forever will live

Like a scar
So many say
It will never fade away
Like a rainbow in the darkest sky

Someday I will be
Together with you
Someday I will leave
This woe behind
For good

Like a scar
So many say
It will never fade away
Like a rainbow in the darkest sky

Someday I will be
Together with you
Someday I will leave
This woe behind
For good
