The corporations' jaws
Are spreading all around
Invading like a plague, you can't ignore
You're led into a trap
They even seem to care
About your life, your health - your misery!

They need you to stay
They want you to play
They will find the way into your needs
You're scanned high and low
Cause they want to know:
- Are you plain enough to serve us?

Every time they reach their goals
You're stabbed, but you don't know
Can't you sense the Oversoul?
The meaning of it all...

The blooming of a life
You're innocent and wild
You guess you know the truth but you just don't

That's right when it begins:
You've gotta join that game!
You're looking for respect - to be someone!

They force you to play
They lead you to crave
From now on they'll be behind your needs
You'll do what they say
Can't choose your own way
Right when it's too late to turn back

Every time they reach their goals
You're stabbed, but you don't know
Can't you sense the Oversoul?
The spirit of it all...

Look around and see:
Have you lost all will to live?
Why don't you stand and fight for your soul?
