Sometimes I'm sad and lonely
Somedays because I miss you
You held me tight in your arms
As I came out of darkness

Sometimes I watch you go away
I watch you go away...
Hope you don't cry

'Cause in my own stories
I'm ever side by side with you
Somewhere to bind the distance
Somekind of timeless moment

Somewhen I'll let you know
How far you've made me roam
Across the nights,
I hear a train
That won't bring you back
But I'll still wait...

I never really lost you
You never really left me
I feel our hearts as one
Every time I gaze
At the moon
