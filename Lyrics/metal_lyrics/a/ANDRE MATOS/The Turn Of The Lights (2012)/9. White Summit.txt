The sight revealed before my eyes
On that very day
A sea of clouds surrounding high
The mountain summit

All so unexpected,
Falling to pieces to the ground

At first I held the shock inside
And then I woke up
I looked around and realized:
The white was red with blood

All so disconnected
When you're striving to survive

I must go...
Over the top, to the summit
Or never know
What lies behind the white giant of snow

Step by step to the summit
I'm face to face with the giant
There's no return...
