In the start, light had been made
There were rainbows in the air
In a place we all belong

Itâs so curious how it swaps
Like the pieces of a play
It depends on how we stand

Day after day
How we care for each word we say,
Each move we makeâ¦

You pretend youâre in control
That you sit so high above
But I prevail without you
When at night you call my name
All your tears roll down in vain
Youâre nor unreplaceable

We must stand
Day after day
We must care for each word we say,
Each move we makeâ¦
