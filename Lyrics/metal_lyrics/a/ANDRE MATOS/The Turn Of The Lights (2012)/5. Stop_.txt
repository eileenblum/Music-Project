You declare wars in your head
You desert them all instead
Every pulse that pumps your veins
Just reminds you of the weight
All over you...

Simply for a little joy
You neglect and then destroy
The key questions in your mind

When your self-esteem is low
When you find nowhere to go

Stop!... the world can't wait!
You won't find a crystal ball
Throughout the haze

It's about time
To quit that maze
Nothing justifies your pain
For there's no one else to blame
