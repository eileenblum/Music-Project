And If I tell you that our hearts are free again
You'll know I will return

When you hide yourself away
You know you're pretending
When you shed your feelings
When you let then down

Many times in life we stray
We're seeking an exit
The solitude is leading to a final call

Will you hide in the sea?
Will you lay all your sorrow on me?

And if I tell you that our minds are free again
You'll know I will return

So many stars are lightning up along the way
You'll know I will return
Back forever

I remember the first time
I dream to be over

I believed in demons, I believed in saints
Now we see what we became
The dream was forever

Since we know the path we won't miss match again
I will rise from the sea
I will take you forever in me

And If I tell you that our hearts are free again
You'll know I will return

So many stars are born each in everyday
You know I will return
Back forevermore

The dream was forever
We won't miss match again
I will rise from the sea
I will take you forever in me

And If I tell you that our hearts are free again
You'll know I will return

So many stars are born each in everyday
You know I will return

Back forevermore
