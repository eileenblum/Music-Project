Sometimes you've been searching for a mend
Sometimes you keep hoping instead
But what you don't see
Is the way things turn
Just to remember how far you've gone
Just to remember how far

Hush sweet darling
Rest your head
Keep on dreaming
Beg for more...

somedays seem so fearless
But too soon they're over
It's when all the pain hits back inside
You're tied in your ordinary thoughts
As time goes by...

rest your head
Keep on dreaming so

All over now
Watch overhead
Nothing left but
Some painfull wounds
That won't heal away
Till you can touch all the truth

Hush sweet darling
Raise your head
If you think
That nothing's over yet
Then you need to understand
Every tale has an end!

All over now
Watch overhead
Nothing left but
Some open wounds
That won't heal away
Till you can see all the truth

All over now
Till one day
Life smiles back...
To you!
