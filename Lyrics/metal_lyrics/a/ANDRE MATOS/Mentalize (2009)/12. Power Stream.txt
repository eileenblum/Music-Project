Do you remember, not too long ago
the cherry tree blossomed in vain?
it was so hazy, yet hard to forget
now all seems to happen again

With the power of your mind
no desire is denied

It's a power stream you conceive your dreams
in world you'd never say no
there's a place to go land of miracles
where the feeling never went wrong, no no no no

Time is scare now,you better sleep
forget all the crosses beared
and though you keep on dreaming,your life is for real
all you need to do now is dare

With the power of your mind
every longing can be defined...

It's a power stream you conceive your dreams
in world you'd never say no
there's a place to go land of miracles
where the feeling never went wrong, no no no no
