Staring at the audience
Your head is a cage
Broken thought fly over
A familiar stage

Gathering the pieces of yourself
That you can't live without
It's only when you became someone else
That you can ease your mind
Always

Heart full of rancour
Has made yourself blue
Enlightened by darkness
The fear becomes true
Kept always pretending
That nothing's been done
If your burn with fire
With fire you'll get burnt!

Gathering the pieces of yourself
That you can't live without
It's only when you become someone else
That you can ease your mind
Always playing a role!

The action was so brilliant
The audience applauds!
You bend down your head and
Deflect any flaws
Inside your heart's freezing
Your mind is a cell
You've swallowed the fire
And fire was your spell

Gathering the pieces of yourself
That you can't live without
It's only when you become someone else
That you can ease your mind
Always playing a role!
