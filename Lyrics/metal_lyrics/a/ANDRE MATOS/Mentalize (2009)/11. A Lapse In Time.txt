I've never been
The ordinary man
The world begin
Like every story does my friend

I won't come down
To where i was back then
And nice mirage of love
Has matter single in my heart, my friend

But when the white fog descends
Over the meadows of light
And when the milking way descends
And shatters the meadows of light
It's time to stand up, stand up and walk
Walk all alone, down the same road

I could feel again
Cause i long for the answers lost
And I'd change everything
If i could have a lapse in time

And i could feel again
Before going insane for good
I would change all mistakes of mine
With just a lapse in time
