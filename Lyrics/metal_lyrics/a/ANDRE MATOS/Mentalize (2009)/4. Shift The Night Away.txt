Ran away,
In a fragment of despair
From a vicious threat
Such a damage to repair

Finding the truth
Where all have already searched
Is the only way
To fulfill a soul with lust

Lust for revenge
In a world full of sins
Something we're building now
Never figured in dreams

Banal intentions
Mold a personality
needles to mention
Madness and insanity

Lust for a chance
In a world full of wins
What are we searching now
That belong to our dreams?

Shift the night away
Shift the night away
Nothing else could let us fall
We're building up our hopes
We're trusting them again
And suddenly a sign will be found

Shift the night away
Shift the night away
Nothing else could let us fall
We're building up our hopes
We're trusting them again
And suddenly a sign will be found

Make a stand
Start all over
In your inner core
Some day what has caused your suffering
Will reset you back for more

Shift the night away
Shift the night away
Nothing else could let us fall
We're building up our hopes
We're trusting them again
And suddenly a sign will be found
and suddenly a light has been found!
