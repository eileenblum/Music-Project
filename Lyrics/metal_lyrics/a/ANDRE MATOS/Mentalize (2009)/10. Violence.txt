Inside a nest we were born
there we grew up together
you flew away towards the sun
I rather stayed and wondered
why do we fear the storm?
why do we hate and suffer?
inside the heart the mystery lives on
inside the mind,it succumbs!

so, anywhere you go flowing with the stream
have a look inside and see
who in fact we are what you've done so far
with the time you let go

Violence and decadence
tragic routes that cross each other
no one cures the consequence
left behind by violence

Learn from your lessons my friend
and your heart will beat much stronger
for a man who looks out just dreams
but he who looks in awakens!

So, anywhere you go flowing with the stream
stuck within the realms of flesh
all we see is flesh longing for the next
episode of pain cause

Violence and decadence
tragic routes that cross each other
no one cures the consequence
left behind by violence
