Inspiration
Introspection
Keep on drilling round and round.
Incarnations
Circumspection
Sending shockwaves through the ground

The power got so close to me
Changing my dreams and my hopes
Time to remember the tide will return
Bringing together a storm!

Let it come out and I'm leading on
Just for a while and the stars will burn!
Let it come out and I'm leading on
just for one night and the skies will burn
Oh they'll burn!

Tonight, it descends a new reason
That thunders inside us intensely
Under the moonlight. It's reaching out
And you'll see:
You're making a final decision
Evoking the might and the fury
Drowning together back to Earth's womb...

The power got so close to me
Changing my dreams and my hopes.
Time to remember the tide will return
Bringing together a storm!

Let it come out and I'm leading on
Just for a while and the stars will burn
Let it come out and I'm leading on
Just for one night and the skies will burn oh they'll burn!
