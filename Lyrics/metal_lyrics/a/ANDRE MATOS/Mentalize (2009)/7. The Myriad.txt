Among the myriad of green
another grief has been heard today
it flew tearing out again
all the way through the landscapes of light
'till the dawning is killing the night

And how much time will be left
to paint the blue on the firmament
and nothing will be changed
nothing else will resist without care
and the last regret harder to bear

Who said you're invincible
is not at your side now, not at your side now
somedays we're invisible, no one can see us
out in the myriad
your prayers cannot prevent
what's meant to be broken,
it's gotta be broken
it's not just a miracle
consider it a virtue to be caught in the myriad...

You made your way to the light
and now no reason retrocede
but once it starts to burn
feels so useless to capture the fire, oh oh
and nature is ready for war!
awake again it's all inside of you
this feeling has to stand
the coldest winds that freeze and bind you
you're about to see the true face of nature
the selfish won't be spared succumb in the end that's all they search for!

Who said you're invincible
is not at your side now, not at your side now
somedays we're invisible, no one can see us
out in the myriad
your prayers cannot prevent
what's meant to be broken,
it's gotta be broken
it's not just a miracle
consider it a virtue to be caught in the myriad...
