[Bonus track]

Before the rays of light
Into a fading bright
Riled up by such a thrill again
I just keep still, don't move
The reason can't improve
A scene unfolding in my mind

Into the light I'm falling
Nobody turns to hear cries
Climbing the highest peak of pain
A reason to stay?

Can't stand the pressure of
The pleasures that I bought
They promised I'd be free someday!!
They told me: "Don't despair"
But then now who'd expect
A phantom shadowing my nights

Into the nightmare, running
Somebody, please, set me right
Offer some kindness, no domain
A reason to stay

Oh, waiting for the sun
No wonder why our lives
Were waiting just to run
Don't need you by my side to
hang together on the ropes
Won't you get out of the way?
I've got to go!

Before the coming fight
You need to stay alive
Riled up by such a thrill again!

Into the nightmare, running
Somebody, please, set me right
Offer some kindness, no domain
A reason to stay

Oh, just waiting for the sun
No wonder why our lives
Were waiting just to run
Don't need you by my side
to tell me it's alright, no more...
Won't you get out of the way?
Oh, waiting for the sun...
From this day on, I'm freed forevermore
Don't need you by my side to
hang together on the ropes
Come on, get out of the way
I've got to go!!!
