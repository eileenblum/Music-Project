It was a day when the sun cried out
it was a moment to burden the doubt
whatever lingers will never reveal
whatever leftover wishes conceal and it's clear

Like the rain:all my fears define who I am
and I hear loud and long, everywhere, a mythical song

Hung in the sky, a lonely star
caught in the twitlight it dances apart
stuck at the gates where the dead stepped
in a subtle hollow spreads out from within and I see

All the way what my eyes could never convey
and it's near,closer now everywhere,a mystical sound

Oh... let me know don't fly away, I'm here
I need to know when will the rain pour down again
coming down over us,washing the past with a smile

To the top of the hill
reach out the sky awake from the dream
now I know we'll fly away
we're free here we go
the falling rain will come again
no matter where or when
it will pour down in the end.
