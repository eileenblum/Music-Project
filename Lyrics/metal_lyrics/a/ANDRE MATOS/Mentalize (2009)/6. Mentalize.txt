Transforming what's invisible
To controvert the physical
A blinding ray across the dark
In outerspace
A veils of sparks

The surging particles align
Quantum reaction in the night
Converting matter into light

Hear an S.O.S
Drawn inside the torrent
Fear contains a quest
Now the unbearable unveils

Never think you'd run away or neglect your pain
Primal forces spin around
Magnitude reveals a plan
Anything leads to the edge
Have you ever tried?

Nothing but a state of mind
Just mentalize
Just mentalize

A magic echoes everyday
keeps emanating from the brain
Converting matter into light
The will prevails over the time

Send an S.O.S
Drawn inside the torrent
faith contains a quest
The unbearable unveils

Never think you'd run away or neglect your pain
Primal forces spin around
Magnitude reveals a plan
Anything leads to the edge
Have you ever tried?

Nothing but a state of mind

Never think you'd run away or neglect your pain
Primal forces spin around
Anything leads to the edge
Have you ever tried?

Drawing near
Mentalize!
