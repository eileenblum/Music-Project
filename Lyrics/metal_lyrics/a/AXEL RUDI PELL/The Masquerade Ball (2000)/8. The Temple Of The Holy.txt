Gone with the wind and home is far away from me
There's no one way to see
Haunted by ghosts the evil force of mystery
No way out for you and me

The end of the time, they're the end of the line
(They're) searching for the stars they couldn't find
The end of the time, they're the end of the line
(They're) searching for the stars they couldn't find

Oh, how much longer will they pay
For the sins of yesterday

With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
They are searching for the temple of the holy
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
They found shelter in the temple of the holy

Don't touch the magic wall, the sign of the crystal ball
See their faces in the mirror
They're the legions of the damned from an unholy land
Bringing fear and reign of terror

The end of the time, (they're) the end of the line
Searching for the stars they couldn't find
The end of the time, (they're) the end of the line
Searching for the stars they couldn't find

Oh, how much longer will they pay
For the sins of yesterday

With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
They are searching for the temple of the holy
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
Finding shelter in the temple of the holy

Oh, how much longer will they pay
For the sins of yesterday

With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
They are searching for the temple of the holy
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
Finding shelter in the temple of the holy

With their flesh and their bone from dusk until dawn
They are searching for the temple of the holy
Fading and gone on the wings of the storm
Finding shelter in the temple of the holy
