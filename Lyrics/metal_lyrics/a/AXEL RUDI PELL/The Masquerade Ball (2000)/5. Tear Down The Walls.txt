Are we hypnotised
Seeing shadows in the air
The world of lost horizons
The devil's in despair

Are we strong enough
To climb up to the sky
The wizard of the holy
Is strong enough to fly

The Moon was rising
With his power shining bright
The heat from down under
From the curse that wasn't right
Not right

Tear down the walls
As the Moon eclipsed the Sun
Tear down the walls
The temple's left undone
Tear down the walls
Lonely on the run
Tear down the walls
Lightning strikes the Sun
Tear down the walls

Can we open our ears
And hear the voices are calling
Calling out your name
It's not the end of the game

Are we fools enough
To cut the edge of a rainbow
(As) we're running out of time
Are we evil or divine?

The Moon was rising
With his power shining bright
The heat from down under
From the curse that wasn't right
Not right

Tear down the walls
As the Moon eclipsed the Sun
Tear down the walls
The temple's left undone
Tear down the walls
Lonely on the run
Tear down the walls
Lightning strikes the Sun
Tear down the walls

Yeeeah
Tear down the walls
As the Moon eclipsed the Sun
Tear down the walls
The temple's left undone
Tear down the walls
Lonely on the run
Tear down the walls
Lightning strikes the Sun
Tear down the walls

Tear down the walls
Tear down the walls
Lonely on the run
Oooh uoooh yeeeah
Tear down the walls
