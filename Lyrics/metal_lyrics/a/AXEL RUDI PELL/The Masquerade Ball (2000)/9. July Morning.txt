There I was on a July morning
I was looking for love
With the strength of a new day dawning
And the beautiful sun

At the sound of the first bird singing
I was leaving for home
With the storm and the night behind me
And a road of my own

With the day
Came the resolution
I'll be looking for you
Oooh, oooh, oooh!

I was looking for love in the strangest places
(There) wasn't a stone that I left unturned
(I) must have tried more than a thousand faces
But not one was aware of the fire that burned

In my heart, in my mind, in my soul
Oooh, oooh, oooh!

In my heart, in my mind, in my soul
Oooh, oooh, oooh!
(Waw-waw) wa-waw, wa-waw, wa-waw, wa-waw
Oh, yeah!
Yeah! In my soul!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Oooh!

There I was on a July morning
I was looking for love
With the strength of a new day dawning
And the beautiful sun

At the sound of the first bird singing
I was leaving for home
With the storm and the night behind me
And a road of my own

With the day
Came the resolution
I'll be looking for you
Oooh, oooh, oooh!
