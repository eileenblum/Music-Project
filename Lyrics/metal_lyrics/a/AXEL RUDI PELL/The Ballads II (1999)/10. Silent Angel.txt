RAINY DAYS, COLD NIGHTS TO REMEMBER 
WHO WILL I FIND TO STAY FOREVER 
A LIFE WITHOUT YOU, NO DREAMS WILL COME TRUE, 
WON'T BE FOOLED JUST LIKE A PRETENDER

A WHISPER IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN, 
LIKE A SOUND OF LOVE AN' PEACE ON EARTH. 
SILENT ANGEL
I WANNA HOLD YOU
SILENT ANGEL 
IN MY FANTASY 
SILENT ANGEL 
LET ME LOVE YOU
SILENT ANGEL
PLEASE STAY WITH ME 
ALL ALONE, WITH A HEART OF STONE
CANDLELIGHT NEVER BURNS SO BRIGHT
HOW CAN IT BE, THAT BETWEEN YOU AND ME 
IS NO WAY OUT, OUT OF MISERY 

[REPEAT BRIDGE]
[REPEAT CHORUS]
