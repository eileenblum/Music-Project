Put a spell on you
Runnin' through your veins
Don't give up you fool
Don't cry in the rain

Burnin' fever
Is drivin' you insane
All of your life you have tried
To follow your dreams

Don't turn back and run away
There'll be no regrets, no way
Don't turn back and run away
I need you here please stay

I believe in you
Don't give up you fool
I believe in you
Don't break down the rule
I believe in you
Don't give up you fool
I believe in you
Don't break that rule

With your back to the wall
You were lost out in the cold world
All the feelings are gone
They were just fading away

So you realize that there'll be soon
A new tomorrow
You're casting the spell
Which will free you from your dreams
