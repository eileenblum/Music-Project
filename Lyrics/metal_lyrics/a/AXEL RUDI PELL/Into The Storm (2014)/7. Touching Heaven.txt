I keep on lookinâ down to the sea
And I realize thereâs a life for you and me
The higher we climb, the harder we fall
Searchinâ for a new world, for you and for all

Coming out of the shadows, hunting all without fear
Fallinâ down to the ground, whising theyâd disappear
Livinâ all life in danger, getting out of control
Afraid of the dark, losinâ oneâs soul

Forever ? Howerver, things must come to and end

Weâre hidinâ the sun, weâre on the run
And touching heaven
Weâre losing our minds, the stars never shine
Weâre touching heaven

Just donât dream of tomorrow, wavinâ flaps in the air
On top of the world or in depths of despair
Shininâ bright in all glory, silent screams in the night
Runninâ high and low, in this neverending figt
