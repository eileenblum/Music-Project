What can you hear ? Can you believe it ?
Should we remember all the words outta your mouth ?
Livinâ a lie, no guts, no glory
No sign to surrender, youâre the devil in disguise

Expect no mercy
You are responsible
Weâre looking ahead
On the train to tomorrow

Ohâ¦
Catch your wounded pride
High above
In your tower of lies
Ohâ¦
Youâre on a never ending ride
High abouve
In your tower of lies

Is it all true ? Drawing conclusions
All of your stories, weâre passing in review
A liarâs not believed, even when he speaks the truth
You stand convicted, leaving you in loneliness
