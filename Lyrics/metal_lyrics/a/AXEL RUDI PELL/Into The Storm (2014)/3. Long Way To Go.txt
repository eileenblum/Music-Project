I wanna know, where did you go, to which part of the city
I kept moving, struggling around to find you in all laces

City lights turned out in all darkness
Strangers are lost, just searching around
Way down in the chamber of life
Blocked out, just tryinâ to survive

Left all alone, but they had to be strong

Coming from nowhere, and the candle lit the shadows
Weâre coming home, weâre on our way
Coming from nowhere, and the lightning hit the shadows
Still have a long, long way to go
A long way to go

They disappeared, contact lost, when did you leave ?
The tide is turning, waves are high, overflowing the shore

High and low, no feel to surrender
The wind just blows the rain in my face
Ramblinâ on to the bridge of forever
Holy grail, no time to disgrage
