Once upon a time, in a land of the sun
Soldiers were dying, under the gun

The people were screaming in a place of no return
With a strike of their hand, theyâll make you burn

We know we crossed the line
Cursed by the spell, runninâ out of time
Sending shivers down the spine
Only time will tell, if weâll live or die,
Weâll live or weâll die

Run on the edge of tomorrow, cryinâ in the rain
Whipping burning chains
Winnin and losing in pain, is the part of the game
Whipping burning chains
Burning chains

Taking no prisoners, the mob ruled the world
The heroes were falling, died by the sword

Getting rid of all the fools, hidinâ bodies in the sand
Heading for tomorrow, to the promsed land
