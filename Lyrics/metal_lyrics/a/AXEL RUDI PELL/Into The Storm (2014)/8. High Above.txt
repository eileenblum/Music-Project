On the horizon thereâs a starlight
Shining down to the world
Theyâre hiding faces in the daylight
Movinâ on, like a bird

No believing
A dream or just a fantasy
No returninâ
Heading into tomorrowâ¦far away

Flyinâ high above
Runninâ fast as an arrow
Flyinâ high above
On the wings of a rainbow

Where the eagle meets the condor
Through the thunders, wind and rain
Peopleâre sayinâ thereâll be peace on earth
All their prayes were not in vain
