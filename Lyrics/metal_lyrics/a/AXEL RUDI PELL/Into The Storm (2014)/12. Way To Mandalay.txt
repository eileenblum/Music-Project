[Bonus Track]I wandered down the pathway, through the misty moor
Like I knew he did a thousand times before
Voices seem to echo "Come talk with me a while
Just around the corner, just another mile..."

I had heard the stories, her legend served her well
A mystic's myth or fable, truth or fairy tale
A raggle taggle gypsy , with a toothless smile
Said "Sit with me my darling, let's talk a little while..."

And the road goes on, seeming ever longer on the
Way to Mandalay
And the road goes on, forever I will wander on the
Way to Mandalay...

The mile went on forever, the minutes turned to days
Could I have been misguided by the mystic's ways?
The moment lasts forever, at least it does for me
Caught between what happened and what could never be...
