On the loose, but hearinâ gunfire
To time to cruise, leaving for our destiny
Cold hearted city, donât wanna stay
Undeserving of pity, better get out our way

Out of the dark and into the light
Moving shadows, full moon on the rise

I wanna know, where we have to go
A thunderous roar, weâre changing times
I wanna know, where we have to go
A thunderous roar, weâre changing times

In a different time, a cry for solutions
Fallinâ out of the ski, losing control
All roots of evil, appearing at oncea
Donât dance with the devil, cause youâll have no chance
