The first time we met, our heaven was on fire
My burning heart was aching, unfulfilled desire
Iâd been a fool in longing for your love
The magic is gone, weâre livinâ out of touch

Did you every sing in the rain ?
Have you ever felt the pain ?

Crossing the line on the edge of our time
Searchinâ for words, when the truth hurts
Our love was so strong, but now itâs lost and gone
Searchinâ for words, when the truth hurts

Youâre gone with the wind, leaving shadows of love
Our whispering hearts were torn apart
