[originally by Neil Young]Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll can never die
There's more to the picture
Than meets the eye
Hey hey, my my

Out of the blue and into the black
They give you this, but you pay for that
And once you're gone, you can't come back
When you're out of the blue and into the black

The king is gone but he's not forgotten
Is this the story of Johnny Rotten?
It's better to burn out than to fade away
The king is gone but he's not forgotten

My my, hey hey
Rock and roll is here to stay
Hey hey, my my
Rock and roll will never die
