What did you see Can you believe it ?
All fallen heroes forever gone
The eternal lights died out in itâs shadows
Brought back some memories when evil ruled the world

No fear, the sun will never fade
One more pray to heaven

Weâre sailing in
In the burninâ sea

Into the storm
Into the storm

Follow the ship, sail on the oceans
Dark stormy nights, aimless victims of the sea
Lifeâs on the edge, fadinâ lost and gone
Trying to break free, but somethingâs goinâ wrong

Round and round in circles, in a place of no return
The captain is in sorrow, the sails started to burn
As we passed the border, to a new and different world
The northern lights kept shining, but the taleâs left unhead
Far awayâ¦far away
