[Music: Axel Rudi Pell]
[Lyrics: Charlie Huhn]

There's a hot new piece slippin'thru the city
slitherin' 'round sneakin' out lookin' much too pretty
Got her number got her thru my bedroom door
coiled her legs around me then she wanted more

Don't make me beg like a dog without a bone
Come on little sweetie don't cha turn your heart to stone

She's burnin' I'm learnin'
She's got Snake Eyes
She's burnin' I'm learnin'
can't stop and won't think twice
She's burnin' I'm learnin'
She's got Snake Eyes
She's burnin' I'm learnin'
She controls the dice - Snake Eyes

Come on snake eyes get it while it's hot
fell the venom sting ya get every last drop

[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus]
[Solo]
[Repeat Chorus]
