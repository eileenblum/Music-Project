[Lyrics: Axel Rudi Pell]

Sheila, a rockin' girl
you can feel the power
she is 19, dressed in black
and rides hour after hour

Yeah, we all know

Every night, when the time is right
she spreads her legs of fire
straps in black, lips in lila
she coolest my hot desire

Yeah, we all know

Ooh, they call her Princess
Ooh, she's the hottest girl in town
Ooh, they call her Princess
Ooh, she's the hottest thing around

It's eight o'clock, she wants my rock
heavy sound is roaring,
Sheila's ass goes up and down,
it never seems to be boring

[Repeat Bridge]
[Repeat Chorus]
[Solo]
[Repeat Chorus]

Come on Princess,
let me kiss your lips of desire
