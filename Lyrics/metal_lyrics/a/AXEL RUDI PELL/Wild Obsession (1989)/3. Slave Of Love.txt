[Music: Axel Rudi Pell]
[Lyrics: Charlie Huhn]

I surrender, feel the pain,
I hope our lovin's not in vain,
I'm just a prisoner, not to blame,
can't help myself here I go again

I don't care, what the people may say,
I never listen to 'em anyway
I'm just a victim oj your master plan,
your every wish will be my command

Call out my name - I'll come runnin' to ya baby,
Drive me insane - you know, I gotta have it

I'm your slave of love
tell me what can I do,
There's no escapin' girl, I'm hooked on you
I'm your slave of love
and my heart is true
Gotta have you woman,
I'll always be your slave of love

She ties me up with all her sweet demands
you dominate my life, it's in your hands
I try to tell myself, it's no big deal
she knows just how to make a young man feel
