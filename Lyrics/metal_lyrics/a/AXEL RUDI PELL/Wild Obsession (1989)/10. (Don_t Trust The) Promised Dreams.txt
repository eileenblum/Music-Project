[Music: Axel Rudi Pell]
[Lyrics: Axel Rudi Pell]

Midnight, the lime is right,
lake a trip to the dark moonlight
silver spoon and needle soon,
ya get to hell, without a spell

Don't trust those promised dreams
there's no way out of misery
Don't trust those promised dreams
there's no way out - of misery

Loser's child, can't break free,
down on your knees under draggon trees
Crack or Smack, no turnin' back.
Right or wrong, man you won't have long

Don't trust those promised dreams
there's no way out - of misery
Don't trust those promised dreams,
there's no way out - of misery

[various noises under drug influence]

[Repeat Chorus]
[Solo]
