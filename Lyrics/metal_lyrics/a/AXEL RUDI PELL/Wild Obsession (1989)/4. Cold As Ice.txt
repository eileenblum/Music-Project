[Music: Axel Rudi Pell]
[Lyrics: Axel Rudi Pell]

A long time ago when we felt the fire,
and it all seemed alright,
but times have changed your love is strange,
there's no luck in sight

Don't want us to lose,
but you're tearin' at my heart,
so confused,
you're tearin' us apart, you're tearin' us apart

She pulled the trigger
she was cold as ice,
she pulled the trigger,
so cold
She pulled the trigger
she was cold as ice
she pulled the trigger
so cold - as ice

She damaged my brain, she's broken the chain,
I can't find a reason,
I wasted my time, can't get cha out of my mind,
our love's out of season
