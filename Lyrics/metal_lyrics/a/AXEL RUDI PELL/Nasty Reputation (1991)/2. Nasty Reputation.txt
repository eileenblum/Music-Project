[Music: Pell]
[Lyrics: Pell]

Can you see me racing down the highway
can you see me walking on the moon
no one cares, I'm gonna do it my way
I don't care, I'm breaking all the rules
I see the fire, the flame is burning bright
I'm a live wire,
I don't know what's wrong or right
I've got a nasty reputation
from town to town
you know we came to rock the nation
oh oo oh
Can you hear me screaming on the TV,
yeaah
I wanna see you rockin'to the show
anyway, I never take it easy
anyday, I'm ready to explode
I've got the action,
and you can't slow me down
it's a chain reaction,
I'm gonna turn you upside down
I've got a nasty reputation
it's all around
you know I came to rock the nation
I've got a nasty reputation
from town to town
you know I came to rock the nation
rock me
[Solo]
[Repeat Chorus / twice]
