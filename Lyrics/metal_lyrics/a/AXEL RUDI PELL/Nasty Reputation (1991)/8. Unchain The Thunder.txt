[Music: Pell]
[Lyrics: Pell/Rock]

They disappear right before my eyes
all my dreams and the love of my life
oh no I feel the shock and the danger
no way can't find no love with a stranger
war and peace you know
there ain't no rules
look out, it turns lovers to fools
down on my luck
now out of deep frustration
I'm lost in desperation
oh no, can't get enough of your show
oh no, I don't know where to go
Unchain the thunder, let the lightning strike
Unchain the thunder,
let the lightning strike tonight
Feels so right when I'm in your spell
let me know if it's heaven or hell
oh, take a walk on the wild side
come on in from the outside
gimme your way, control the situation,
now I'm in a new creation
oh no, can't get enough of your show
oh no, I still don't know where to go
unchain the thunder,
let the lightning strike
unchain the thunder, feels so right
unchain the thunder, feed my appetite
unchain the thunder,
let the lightning strike tonight
unchain the thunder
[Solo]
unchain the thunder,
let the lightning strike
unchain the thunder, feels so right
unchain the thunder, stay with me tonight
unchain the thunder, feed my appetite
unchain the thunder,
let the lightning strike tonight
walk on the wild side
come on in from the outside
let the lightning strike tonight
