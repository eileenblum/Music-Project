[Music + Lyrics: Blackmore, Gillan, Glover, Lord, Paice]

If you're leaving, close the door
I'm not expecting people any more
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor
whether I'm drunk or dead
I really ain't too sure
I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
and my world is pale
when a blind man cries
Lord you know, there ain't no sadder tale
[Solo]
Had a friend once, in a room
Had a good time,
but it ended much too soon
In a cold month, in that room
we found a reason for the things
we had to do
I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
now my room is cold
when a blind man cries
Lord you know, he feels it from his soul
[Solo]
[Repeat Chorus]
