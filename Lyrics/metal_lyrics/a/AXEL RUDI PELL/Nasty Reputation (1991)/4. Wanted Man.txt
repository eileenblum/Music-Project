[Music: Pell]
[Lyrics: Pell]

There I was a dirty boy,
a stranger in this town
there you were a broken toy,
lost and never found
watch out, here comes the judge
can't tell by the others
reach out, but you're not there
better run for cover
man on a mission, I'm ready to rock
locked in position, I'm never gonna stop
I'm on the run down the highway
I'm a wanted man
you better stay out of my way
run as fast as you can
Draw the line ain't got no time,
when all is said and done
Fell the heat down on the street,
looking for some fun
Hold out, it's not too late
take my revenge
Hold on and get it straight
Living on the edge
man on a mission, I'm ready to rock
Locked in position, I'm never gonna stop
I'm on the run down the highway
I'm a wanted man
you better stay out of my way
run as fast as you can
I'm on the run down the highway
I'm a wanted man
you better stay out of my way
run as fast as you can
[Solo]
[Repeat Chorus/twice]
