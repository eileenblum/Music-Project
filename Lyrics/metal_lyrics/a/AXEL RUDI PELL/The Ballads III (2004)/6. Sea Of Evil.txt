[1. Verse:]
They were sailing on the ship of the damned
Straight on the ocean to an unholy land
Sirens were calling, only exist to believe
Longing for their souls, possessed by the misty morning

[Bridge:]
Lights were shining
From far away
Praying for a wonder
They don't want here to stay

[2. Verse:]
Their thoughts were blinded, the tide's turning high
Searching for fool's gold under the blackened sky
The sea is deep and it wait's endlessly
Hungry for souls, for you and for me

[Bridge:]
Lights were shining
From far away
Praying for a wonder
They don't want here to stay

[Chorus:]
Sea of evil
So many born to die
Sea of evil
Leaving tears in the sky
Sea of evil
Never asking why
Sea of evil
A heavenly cry

[3. Verse:]
Northern lights once shined so bright
In a wonderful heaven, now are hiding in the night
The mood turned Zero, hearing echoes in the dark
The colors of a rainbow were in need of their spark
