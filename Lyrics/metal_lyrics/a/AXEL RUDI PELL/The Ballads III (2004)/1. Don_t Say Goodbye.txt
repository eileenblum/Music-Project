On a cloudy night
I looked outside the window
Seeing faces disappear
The wheels of time kept turnin'
Through endless days and nights
I'm hiding my soul from the light

Holding on, to the two sides of the coin
I'm blinded by lies - too late to return
Late at night, the fires starts to burn
I'm a prisoner of flames
Will I ever learn?

We're falling in and outta love
Calling our hearts
Tears from heaven

Don't say goodbye
Love is forerver
And I need you to stay
Don't say goodbye
We're so strong together
Don't leave me this way

On and on we searched for Fool's Gold
Pulling down the trigger of love
Any chance we had is passing by
It's just too late for another try

Lonely hearts lost fires in the night
The end of our romance's in sight

Don't say goodbye
Love is forever
And I need you to stay
Don't say goodbye
We're so strong together
Don't leave me this way
