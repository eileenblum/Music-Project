In the distance from far away
I can hear your voice, the words that you say
You left forever, your love has been gone
But I still feel so strong... for you

You left me crying, you're leaving me alone
You and I together, once it was so strong
The shield of love has broken, you're fire has been gone
Now I'm back on my own

Come back and stay
Don't leave me all alone
Can you hear me pray
Forever
Forever

I want you,
All the rest of my life
I want you,
All the rest of my life
(The) rest of my life

Every moment (still) I'm thinking of you
But it seems that there's nothing, nothing I can do
If there's something, something I could say
To bring you back some day

Come back and stay
Don't leave me all alone
Can you hear me pray
Forever
Forever

I want you,
All the rest of my life
I want you,
All the rest of my life
(The) rest of my life

I want you,
All the rest of my life
I want you,
'Cause I need you
All the rest of my life

I want you,
And I want you
All the rest of my life
I want you,
(You'll always be the one)
All the rest of my life
(The rest of my life)

I want you,
(I need you close to me)
All the rest of my life
I want you,
('Cause I need you)
All the rest of my life
(All the rest of my life)

Yeah...
