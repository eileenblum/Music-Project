Alone at night
In the cold and windy city
When the candle fades away

Another morning
And the Sun's shining pretty
You can watch the children play

(But) there's a hole in the sky
And it cries for you and I
And We can't find the reason for calling

(But) there's a new place to see
Another world for you and me
(And) one can hear the bell which will be tolling
Tolling

They crossed the line
See the light, it shines
They crossed the line
Heaven or Hell, who will decide?

What's coming after
The curse of wrath and agony
Oh Lord, please help us find our way

(We) tried to get out
Of the last light of eternity
But we couldn't get away

(But) there's a hole in the sky
(When) it cries for you and I
(When) we can't find the reason for dreaming

(But) there's a new place to see
Another world for you and me
(And) one can hear the bell which will be tolling

They crossed the line
See the light, it shines
They crossed the line
Heaven or Hell, who will decide?

Oooh, oooh!
Oooh, oooh!
They crossed the line
They crossed the line

Touching the heaven
Burning in Hell
Cast away, cast away
Cast away the spell
Oooh, oooh, yeeeah!

They crossed the line
Can't you see the light shines
Cast away, cast away
Oooh, oooh, (they) crossed the line
