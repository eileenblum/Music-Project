When I was young I saw the birds of prey
Leaving all behind and had nothing more to say

I walked through sunshine and was singing in the rain
Before judgement day

Wandering around in search of fool's gold
But all I found were stories left untold

I walked through sunshine and was singing in the rain
Before judgement day
I heard birds crying, crying out their pain
On judgement day
Judgement day

I can see through pouring rain
Changing fortunes on their way
From the cradle to their grave
That's what life's about
Stumbling in, fading out

There's only one life could be blowing in the wind
But we will find out on the day of reckoning

I walked through sunshine and was singing in the rain
Before judgement day
I heard birds crying, crying out their pain
Before judgement day
Judgement day, hey

I can see through pouring rain
Changing fortunes on their way
From the cradle to their grave
That's what life's about
Stumbling in, fading out
