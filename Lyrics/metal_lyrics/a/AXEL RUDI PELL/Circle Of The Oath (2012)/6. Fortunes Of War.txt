In a scary night we left all behind
Soldiers are following blind
Politics, religion, the truth we'll never find
Revenge is coming to our mind

Longing for fame and for glory
But hoping for peace on earth
Earth

Running and hiding and ready to fight
Scenes that we'd been through before
Losing and riding all day and all night
We follow the Fortunes of War
Fortunes of War

Wounded or fallen, much to our regret
Slaves of the Empire we are
Praying 'till the morning, for some it is too late
The victory seems to be far

Longing for fame and for glory
But hoping for peace on earth
Earth

Running and hiding and ready to fight
Scenes that we'd been through before
Losing and riding all day and all night
We follow the Fortunes of War
Fortunes of War

[Solo - Axel]

Longing for fame and for glory
But hoping for peace on earth
On earth

Running and hiding and ready to fight
Scenes that we'd been through before
Losing and riding all day and all night
We follow the Fortunes of War

Running and hiding and ready to fight
Scenes that we'd been through before
Losing and riding all day and all night
We follow the Fortunes of War

Fortunes of War
Fortunes of War
Fortunes of War
Yeah
