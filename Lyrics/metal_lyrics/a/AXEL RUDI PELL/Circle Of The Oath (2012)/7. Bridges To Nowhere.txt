Walking around all the day, we're on our way
Heard a misleading spell, from heaven or from hell

Oh, I'm losing my mind
Oh, not sure what I'll find
Hoping for peace of mind

We're searching for our destiny
We're on the Bridges to Nowhere
We're the masters of insanity
On the Bridges to Nowhere

Silent cries in the darkness are left unheard
The signs on the walls, all forgotten words

Oh, I'm losing my mind
Oh, not sure what I'll find
Hoping for peace of mind

We're searching for our destiny
We're on the Bridges to Nowhere
We're the masters of insanity
On the Bridges to Nowhere

[Solo - Axel]

Oh, I'm losing my mind
Oh, not sure what I'll find
Hoping for peace of mind

We're searching for our destiny
We're on the Bridges to Nowhere
We're the masters of insanity
On the Bridges to Nowhere

We're searching for our destiny
We're on the Bridges to Nowhere
We're the masters of insanity
On the Bridges to Nowhere
On the Bridges to Nowhere
Oh, Bridges to Nowhere
