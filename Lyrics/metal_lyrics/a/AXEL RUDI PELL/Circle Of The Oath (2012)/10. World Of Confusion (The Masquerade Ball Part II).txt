I kept on crying on the stairway of doom
Saw all the lives fading, ending much too soon
Cries in the darkness from the wizard's chosen few
We're back on the ball, mysterious call

[Solo - Axel]

One night to remember, whole life full of sin
We never surrender, but ain't gonna win
We played with some voodoo, our souls turned to stone
If there's no one to fool you, you'll be left on your own

We never saw the wind with our eyes
We'll be leaving tomorrow, the room full of lies

In a World of Confusion, strangers in the night
Stick to your guns, the evil's never right
In a World of Confusion, eagles flying high
Touching the rainbow, hearing angels in the sky
In a World of Confusion

The bell's striking midnight, a crimson coloured sky
The weirdness is calling, is it time to die
Turn round the circle, at the edge of our time
Fools in the night in black covored light, trying to hide

We never saw the wind with our eyes
We'll be leaving tomorrow, the room full of lies

In a World of Confusion, strangers in the night
Stick to your guns, the evil's never right
In a World of Confusion, eagles flying high
Touching the rainbow, hearing angels in the sky
In a World of Confusion

[Solo - Axel]

I'll break the silence
And I'll break the rules
And I don't follow the guidance
And I don't wanna be your fool
Don't wanna be your fool

[Solo - Axel]

It's the Masquerade Ball, climb up to the stars
Through the winds of wonder, the evil's in despair

It's the Masquerade Ball, see the wizard fly
There is no tomorrow on the other side
It's the Masquerade Ball, climb up to the stars
Through the winds of wonder, evil's in despair

In a World of Confusion, strangers in the night
Stick to your guns, the evil's never right
In a World of Confusion, eagles flying high
Touching the rainbow, hearing angels in the sky

In a World of Confusion
We will leave tomorrow, in the room full of lies
Of Confusion
There is no tomorrow, in the room full of lie
