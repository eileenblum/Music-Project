I heard you calling
I heard you calling out my name
I heard you screaming, yeah
All day to play your game

Your reputation
So bad to ruin your life
No resignation, words or anything
But it's all about time

Surprise in the morning, remember the night before
Many things we are learning, a therapy behind closed doors

Playing with fire, it's not so easy as it seems
Burning desire, but better Hold on to your Dreams
Our love is a liar, but there are always ways and means
Dancing on a wire, but better Hold on to your Dreams
Hold on to your Dreams
Oh yeah

You keep on moving
Living in a world of sin
You think you're grooving, yeah
But there's no chance to win

You got me yearning
Got me yearning for your love
But realizing what a fool I've been
Teared my heart apart

Surprise in the morning, remember the night before
Many things we are learning, a therapy behind closed doors

Playing with fire, it's not so easy as it seems
Burning desire, but better Hold on to your Dreams
Our love is a liar, but there are always ways and means
Dancing on a wire, but better Hold on to your Dreams

[Solo - Axel]

My heart's still burning
So is my soul
Sometimes I'm dying
Where it all would go
Yeah

Playing with fire, it's not so easy as it seems
Burning desire, but better Hold on to your Dreams
Our love is a liar, but there are always ways and means
Dancing on a wire, but better Hold on to your Dreams

Hold on to your Dreams
Hold on to your Dreams, yeah
Hold on to your Dreams
To your Dreams
Hold on to your Dreams
Ho-ho-ho-hold on
