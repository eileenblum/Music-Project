We are heading out on the land
Raising our swords in the air
We'll fight for glory 'till the very end
Strong with no fear and despair

We followed the sign
Leaving our world behind

Oh, Ghost in the Black
Running and leaving, we're under attack
Oh, Ghost in the Black
Hiding our souls, we might not come back

Should we go on into the dark
Even if we will be crucified
Expect no mercy, disastrously spark
The battle goes on in the night

We followed the sign
Leaving our world behind

Oh, Ghost in the Black
Running and leaving, we're under attack
Oh, Ghost in the Black
Hiding our souls, we might not come back

Oh, Ghost in the Black
Running and leaving, we're under attack
Oh, Ghost in the Black
Hiding our souls, we might not come back

[Solo - Axel]
[Solo - Ferdy]
[Solo - Axel]
[Solo - Ferdy]
[Solo - Axel]

Oh, Ghost in the Black
Running and leaving, we're under attack
Oh, Ghost in the Black
Hiding our souls, we might not come back

Oh, there's a Ghost in the Black
Oh, there's a Ghost in the Black
Ghost in the Black
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Ghost in the Black
Yeah
