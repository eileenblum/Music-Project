All of your life you worked hard for your money
But when you got old you realized it wasn't funny
You're shouting out "Who's to blame?"
A one way cry that drives you insane

But when your life is over, when it's coming to an end

You'll say I was born to love you
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hold you in my arms
Before I die

Life's a bitch, I ain't no loser
Reaper'call is coming closer
Party all night in the heart of the city
Can't join no more and that ain't pretty

But when your life is over, when it's coming to an end

You'll say I was born to love you
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hold you in my arms
Before I die
Yeah

[Solo - Axel]

But when your life is over, when it's coming to an end

You'll say I was born to love you
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hold you in my arms
Before I die

I was born to love you
I don't wanna cry
I just wanna hold you in my arms again
Before I die
Before I die
Before I die
