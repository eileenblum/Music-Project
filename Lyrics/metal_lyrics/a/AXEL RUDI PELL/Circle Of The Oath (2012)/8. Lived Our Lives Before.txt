A long time ago there lived a man
He was searching for an answer
He had seen it all, faces in the mirror
Alone in that room made him shiver

Burning candles, seeing shadows in the night
Bringing back memories in mystical light
Holy spirit in an unholy night
Enlightenments never felt so right

We don't know
If we Lived our Lives Before
Is it a dream or just a fantasy
We don't know
If we Lived our Lives Before
Is it a dream or just a fantasy
Fantasy

[Solo - Axel]

On his journey learning all about life
He was dreaming of the past
Praying day and night, looking for a solution
But in the end there's only confusion

Burning candles, seeing shadows in the night
Bringing back memories in mystical light
Holy spirit in an unholy night
Enlightenments never felt so right

We don't know
If we Lived our Lives Before
Is it a dream or just a fantasy
We don't know
If we Lived our Lives Before
Is it a dream or just a fantasy
Fantasy

[Solo - Axel]

We don't know
If we Lived our Lives Before
Is it a dream or just a fantasy
We don't know
If we Lived our Lives Before
Is it a dream or just a fantasy

We don't know, oh
Is it a fantasy or just a dream, yeah
We Lived Our Lives Before
