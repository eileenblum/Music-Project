Your life was filled with anger, agony and pain
Continuing problems, always the same
The government is not your friend, all words full of lies
Collateral damages, no big surprise

On and on to a brighter future
Moving on to another strain

Run with the Wind
And leave it all behind
Run with the Wind
And find your right destiny
Run with the Wind
And get rid of it all
Run with the Wind
And try to free your souls
Free your soul, hm

On with the action, enough of broken dreams
Never surrender, by no means
No wonder why there were always fights out on the streets
Inequitable conceptions we don't need

On and on to a brighter future
Moving on to another strain

Run with the Wind
And leave it all behind
Run with the Wind
And find your right destiny
Run with the Wind
And get rid of it all
Run with the Wind
And try to free your soul

When will we find a solution
When will it come to an end

[Solo - Axel]

Run with the Wind
And leave it all behind
Run with the Wind
And find your right destiny
Run with the Wind
And get rid of it all
Run with the Wind
And try to free your soul

Run with the Wind
And leave it all behind
Run with the Wind
And find your right destiny
Run with the Wind
And get rid of it all
Run with the Wind
And try to free your soul
Free your soul
And run with the Wind
Run with the Wind
