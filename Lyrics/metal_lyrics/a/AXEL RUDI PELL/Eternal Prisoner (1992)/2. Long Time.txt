[MUSIC: PELL]
[LYRICS: PELL/SOTO]

TAKE YOUR SPELL AWAY,
LIKE U DID IT BEFORE, 
CUZ I DON'T NEED 
IT ANYMORE.

4 A SUMMERTIME,
WE WERE LIVING A LIE,
BUT WHO KNEW LOVE 
WAS GONNA DIE.

NO MORE FOOLIN',
CUZ YOUR'RE DRIVIN'
ME INSANE
U BETTER STOP MOVING',
OR YOUR'RE GONNA FEEL
THE PAIN.

IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
WE TRIED EVERYTHING,
YEAH, WE TRIED IT ALL,
STILL OUR LOVE WOULD
TAKE A FALL.

ANOTHER SLEEPLESS NIGHT,
ANOTHER ENDLESS DAY
+ THE MEMORIES JUST
FADE AWAY.

[REPEAT BRIDGE]
[REPEAT CHORUS]
