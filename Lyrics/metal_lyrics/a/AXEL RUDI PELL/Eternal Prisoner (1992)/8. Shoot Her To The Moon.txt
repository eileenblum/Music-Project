[MUSIC: PELL]
[LYRICS: PELL/SOTO]

SHE WAS BORN DOWN
IN UPTOWN, BABY
+ EVERYTHING SHE WANTS, 
SHE'S GOT WITH
BIG DADDY'S MONEY,
KEPT UP WITH
THE LASTEST FASHIONS,
BUT WHEN IT CAME 2 LOVE,
SHE DIDN'T KNOW JACK ABOUT 
IT, FUNNY.

CUZ SHE'S TELLIN' ME MAYBE
WE COULD JUST BE FRIENDS,
I'VE GOT ANOTHER PLAN IF MY
LOVE SHE'S GONNA END

SHOOT, SHOOT, SHOOT,
SHOOT HER TO THE MOON,
SHOOT, SHOOT, SHOOT,
NOTHING MORE 2 LOSE, 
SHOOT, SHOOT, SHOOT,
SHOOT HER TO THE MOON.
SHOOT, SHOOT, SHOOT, WHATCHA
GONNA DO.

CAVIAR WITH A SILVER SPOON,
DESIGNER EVERYTHING
+ MORE AS LONG
AS SHE CAN BUY IT.
THAT'S NOT THE WAY
2 TREAT A TRUE EMOTION,
CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON LOVE, BUT
I KNOW IF SHE COULD,
SHE WOULD TRY IT.

NOW SHE'S TELLIN' ME MAYBE WE
COULD JUST BE FRIENDS.
I'VE GOT ANOTHER PLAN IF MY
LOVE SHE'S GONNA END.

[REPEAT CHORUS]
