[MUSIC: PELL]
[LYRICS: SOTO]

SHE'S YOUNG + FINE LIKE
A SIP OF GOOD WINE,
+ SHE PLAYS LIKE SHE'S
DYIN' 2 MEET U
+ IF U TAKE HER HOME,
ONCE U GET HER ALONE,
THAT'S WHEN HER
INNOCENCE BEATS U.

SAME OLD STORY
4 A SMALL TOWN GIRL,
SHE'S GONNA PLAY U LIKE 
A FOOL, YEAH,
SHE'LL TAKE U UP
THEN BRING U DOWN,
HAVE A DROWNING IN YOUR
OWN LITTLE POOL, YEAH.

OH, SWEET LITTLE SUZIE, WHO'S 
YOUR VICTIM 2 NIGHT
ON SWEET SUZIE WON'T 
U TURN OUT THE LIGHTS,
(GIVE IT 2 ME NOW)

WELL, I PLAYED ALONG,
THOUGHT I'D KNOW THE GAME.
TOOK A CHANCE
WITH A TRUE EMOTION
GAVE HER HEAVEN + MORE 
THAN ANYONE COULD GIVE
SWEARED ON MY DEVOTION.

SHE TOOK IT ALL IN STRIDE,
JUST ANOTHER RIDE,
U KNOW I MUST'VE BEEN 
A BLIND, YEAH,
CUZ, NOW SHE'S FEEDIN' OFF
ANOTHER LOST SOUL,
SHE'S GOT YOUR HEART ON 
THE LINE, YEAH.

[CHORUS]
