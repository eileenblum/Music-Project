[MUSIC: PELL]
[LYRICS: PELL/SOTO]

GONNA TAKE U DOWN,
DOWN 2 THE FLOOR,
GONNA MAKE U WANNA
SCREAM 4 MORE.
TAKE A LOOK,
A LOOK IN MY DIRECTION.
TOUCH YOUR BODY AS YOU'RE 
FEELIN' MY ERECTION!

AS I BURN IN YOUR DESIRE,
I CAN FEEL
U TAKIN' ME HIGHER.
UP + DOWN,
FILL U UP WITH MY LOVE,
(HEY, HEY, DO U WANNA RIDE
THE BULLET!)
IN + OUT TIL U CAN'T
GET ENOUGH.

I'LL BE THE BEST,
THE BEST U EVER HAD,
DO IT SO GOOD,
I SWEAR I'LL DRIVE U MAD.
LICK YOUR BODY LIKE A CAT
WITH A BOWL OF CREAM
+ WHEN YOU'RE COMIN' UP, OOH
IT'S SO OBSCENE.
YEAH, U PUMP ME 2 THE WIRE,
LIKE A BURNIN' WHEEL OF FIRE.
GRIND U DOWN TIL YOU'RE 
BEGGIN' 4 REASON
(HEY, HEY, DO U WANNA RIDE 
THE BULLET!)
TASTE MY SKIN,
IT'S THAT TIME OF THE SEASON.
