[MUSIC: PELL]
[LYRICS: SOTO]

ROUND + ROUND WHEELS
R TURNIN!
ALL YOUR LIFE,
U BEEN FIGHTING 4 THE DAY.
2 TAKE THE SPOTLIGHT,
+ STEAL THE THUNDER,
+ NO ONE'S GONNA TAKE
THIS TIME AWAY.

IT'S ALL PART
OF THE PASSION,
GOIN' ALL THE WAY.

WHEELS ROLLING ON,
+ THEY KEEP ON TURNIN',
WHEELS ROLLING ON,
IT'S AN EVERLASTING ROAD
THAT'S HERE 2 STAY

IT'S YOUR TIME,
IT'S YOUR DESTINATION,
THOUGH U KNOW THAT YOUR
BACK'S AGAINST THE WALL.
BUT THE LIGHTS ARE CALLING',
THE NIGHT IS SCREAMIN',
+ NOW IT'S ALL 4 ONE
+ ONE 4 ALL.

THIS NIGHT WILL LAST 4 EVER,
DON'T LET IT GET AWAY.
WHEELS ROLLING ON,
+ THE NIGHT IS BURNIN',
WHEELS ROLLING ON,
YOUR HEART IS YEARNIN',
