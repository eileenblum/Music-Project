[MUSIC: PELL]
[LYRICS: PELL]

I SAW THE SHADOW RISING
FROM A HILL UP DOWN BELOW
THERE WAS NO PLACE
FOR HIDING
STILL I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE TO GO

I'D BETTER BE AWARE OF
THE PLACE OF NO RETURN
ALL I COULD HEAR WAS SOME-
ONE SAYING "BURN"

ETERNAL PRISONER
FOREVER LOST IN SPACE
ETERNAL PRISONER
FOREVER LOCKED IN A CAGE

IN THE LIGHT OF DAY
YOU CAN HEAR
THE WIZARD PRAY
AND IN THE DARK OF NIGHT
THERE WAS A RAINBOW
SHINING BRIGHT

ETERNAL PRISONER
FOREVER LOST IN SPACE
ETERNAL PRISONER
FOREVER LOCKED IN A CAGE

THEY NEVER SAW
THE LIGHT OF DAY
ALL THEY COULD DO
WAS WISH AND PRAY
THEY WERE TORTURED
TO THE BONES
WITH SWORDS AND
GLOWING STONES

[SOLO]
[REPEAT CHORUS]
