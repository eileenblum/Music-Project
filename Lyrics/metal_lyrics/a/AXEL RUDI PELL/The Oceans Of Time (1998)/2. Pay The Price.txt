Yeeeah
Oh yeah

Struck down, time is late, thought we could rule the Earth
Can't get away of all those promises
Moving through the holy land we're lost in the curse
No matter how we could get out of this

Shots in the dark ringing in my head
Fear of the night's running through my veins
The lords of twilight disturbing my brain
Another night of slavery will drive me insane

They come from behind
Stealing your mind
Tearing your soul apart
There's no place to hide
And you realize
They'll rip out your heart

(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
We pay the price for love
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
We pay the price for love
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
We pay the price for love
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
We pay the price
For
Love

On and on we sailed away we're running through the night
Heading for the end straight into nowhere
Destination paralyzed shockwaves in the air
Can't get along we're running in despair

They come from behind
Stealing your mind
Tearing your soul apart
There's no place to hide
And you realize
They'll rip out your heart

We pay the price for love
We pay the price for love
We pay the price for love
We pay the price
For love
Price for love

They come from behind
Stealing your mind
Go!

They come from behind
Stealing your mind
Tearing your soul apart
There's no place to hide
And you realize
They'll rip out your heart

(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
We pay the price for love
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
We pay the price for love
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
We pay the price for love
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
We pay the price for love
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
(Oh oh oh oh)
We pay the price for love
(Oh oh oh oh)
We pay the price (Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Price for love
Oh love

Shots in the dark
Ringing in my head
Fear of the night's running through my veins
The price of love
Yeah
Pay the price
