We saw the wonderworld, of all the wild wild horses
Flying around, like an eagle in the sky
But we had been told, of the danger of burning roses
Longing for you, and they're never asking why

Don't touch the flame
Run through the fire
Calling your name
We're flying higher... to the edge of the world

Carrousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carrousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me
Carrousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carrousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me

Carrousel

Far out in the distance, there was a place we once called home
Lost forever, filled with emptiness and moan
The rising force of evil, broke the chains of destination
Hard to believe, but there will be no recreation

Don't touch the flame
Run through the fire
Calling your name
We're flying higher

Carrousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carrousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me
Carrousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carrousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me

Yeeeeh
Yeah

Carrousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carrousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me
Carrousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carrousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me
Carrousel
Of broken dreams
Turning around in a circle
Carrousel
You know what it means
Making a fool out of me (carrousel)

Make a fool out of me (carrousel)
Carrousel
Make a fool out of me (carrousel)
You know what it means (carrousel)

Don't touch the flame (carrousel)
Run through the fire
Calling your name
We're flying higher (carrousel)

Carrousel
Carrousel yeah (carrousel)
Make a fool out of me
(don't make a fool of me)
