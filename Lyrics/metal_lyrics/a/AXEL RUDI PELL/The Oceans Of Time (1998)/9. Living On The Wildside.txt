The memories are coming, all slowly on my mind
We searched for hope and glory, for the things we couldn't find

We're stone cold crazy, our love is been apart

Remember the feelings we had all in the past
They're gone forever, didn't know it wouldn't last

On the ashes of love
Living in the wildside
On the ashes of love
Living in the wildside
On the ashes of love
Living in the wildside
We didn't know it wouldn't last

Living in the wildside
On the ashes of love
Living in the wildside
On the ashes of love
Living in the wildside yeah
On the ashes of love
Living in the wildside
On the ashes of love
Living in the wildside
On the ashes of love
Living in the wildside
On the ashes of love
Living in the wildside
On the ashes of love
Living in the wildside
We didn't know it wouldn't last

Living on the wildside

Living on the wildside
Oh yeah
Living on the
