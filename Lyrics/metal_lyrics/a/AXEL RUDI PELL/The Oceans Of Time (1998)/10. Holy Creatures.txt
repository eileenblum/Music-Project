The evil wolfs in the dark are howling again
I wish that I could sleep every now and then
The moon is shining in, in my face so bright
In this neverending storyteller's night

It was not worth to remember
Left all alone in the cold
We never give up, no surrender
But our souls have been sold

Holy creatures
Coming out of the dark
Twisting around in the night
Holy creatures
Riding the spark
Hiding in unholy light
Holy creatures
Coming out of the dark
Twisting around in the night
Holy creatures
Riding the spark
Hiding in unholy light yeah

The hunting in my darkest hour still goes on and on
Evil faces smiling bright appearing from dusk until dawn
The earls of darkness bringing torture slaughter and pain
I tried to stay awake but that was in vain

It was not worth to remember
Left all alone in the cold
We never give up, no surrender
But our souls have been sold

Holy creatures
Coming out of the dark
Twisting around in the night
Holy creatures
Riding the spark
Hiding in unholy light
Holy creatures
Coming out of the dark
Twisting around in the night
Holy creatures
Riding the spark
Living in unholy light yeah

Ooooh

Holy creatures
Out of the dark
Twisting around in the night
Riding the spark in unholy light
The creature
It was in the dark
Unholy again
Holy creatures
Holy creatures
They're out of the dark
Twisting around in the night
Hiding in unholy night
Holy creatures
We never give up, never surrender
But our souls have been sold
Never give up in the night
Holy creatures
Holy creatures
Holy creatures
(Holy creatures)
(Holy creatures)
(Out of the dark)
(Twisting around in the night)
