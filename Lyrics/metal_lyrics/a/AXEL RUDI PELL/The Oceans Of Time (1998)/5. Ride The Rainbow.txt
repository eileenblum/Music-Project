We're riding through the times, danger in the air
Lock up the wolves, don't trust those promises
The tower's passing by, the devil's in despair
Break down the walls, somewhere or nowhere

We're riding the wind
We're riding through eternity
We're living in sin
They opened the gates for you and me
For you and me

(Oh oooh oh oh)
We ride the rainbow (Oh oooh oh oh)
We touch the sky (Oh oooh oh oh)
We ride the rainbow (Oh oooh oh oh)
We don't ask why

Northern lights are shining and, we are left on our own
We'd broke the crystal ball, with blood, fire and stone
The cross of heaven and hell, was burning, lost and gone
Tearing the souls apart, and never seen again

We're riding the wind
We're riding through eternity
We're living in sin
They opened the gates for you and me
For you and me

(Oh oooh oh oh)
We ride the rainbow (Oh oooh oh oh)
We touch the sky (Oh oooh oh oh)
We ride the rainbow (Oh oooh oh oh)
And don't ask why

(Oh oooh oh oh)
We ride the rainbow (Oh oooh oh oh)
We touch the sky (Oh oooh oh oh)
We ride the rainbow yeah (Oh oooh oh oh)

We're riding through the times, danger in the air (Oh oooh oh oh)
The tower's passing by, the devil's in despair (Oh oooh oh oh)
Somewhere oh yeah (Oh oooh oh oh)
We ride the rainbow (Oh oooh oh oh)
And touch the sky
We ride the rainbow
We ride the rainbow yeah
We fly the rainbow
On and on
On and on
We ride
