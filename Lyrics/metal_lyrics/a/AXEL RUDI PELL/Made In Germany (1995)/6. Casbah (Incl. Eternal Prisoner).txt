Here I go and make my final stand
Very far away there's the promised land

The eagle came down and took me away
Puts me down in a hole I can't see the light of day

Oohoh, riding on the wings of wonder
Ohh, can you feel, the fire from down under

Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho, dreamin' of the casbah

The wizard prays in his unbroken rules
With tears in his eyes for a ship of fools

Then we sailed away and the sun turned black
We saw the eyes of the lost and we're never comin' back

Oohoh, riding on the wings of wonder
Ohh, can you feel, the fire from down under

Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho, dreamin' of the casbah

Eternal prisoner
Forever lost in space
Eternal prisoner
Forever locked in a cage

Eternal Prisoner
I saw the shadow rising, from a hill up down below
Eternal Prisoner
There was no place for hiding, still I didn't know were to go

Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho, dreamin' of the casbah

Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho, dreamin' of the casbah
