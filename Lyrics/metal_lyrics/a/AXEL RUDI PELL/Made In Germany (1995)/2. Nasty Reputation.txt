Can you see me racing down the highway
Can you see me walking on the moon
No one cares, I'm gonna do it my way
I don't care, I'm breaking all the rules

I see the fire, the flame is burning bright
I'm a live wire, I don't know what's wrong or right

I've got a nasty reputation
From town to town
You know we came to rock the nation
Oh ho ho

Can you hear me screaming on the TV, let me hear you scream
I wanna see you rockin' to the show
Anyway, I never take it easy
Anyday, I'm ready to explode

I've got the action, and you can't slow me down
It's a chain reaction, I'm gonna turn you upside down

I've got a nasty reputation
From town to town
You know I came to rock the nation
I've got a nasty reputation
It's all around
You know I came to rock the nation
Rock me
