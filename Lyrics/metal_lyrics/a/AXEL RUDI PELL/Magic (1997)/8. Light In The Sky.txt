:AXEL RUDI PELL]

Don't Close Your Eyes,
Could Be Forever,
Don't Close The Door,
On The Way To The Stars

Get Hypnotized,
Lost In The Shadows,
Don't Hear The Howl,
Of The Wolf Anymore

We're Climbing A Mountain Of Rocks,
Seeing The Eternal Flame,
They Tried To Hold Us Back From Above,
Saying This Trip's Not A Game.
Light In The Sky,
There's No Returning,
Light In The Sky,
Lost For All Eternity...

We're On The Move,
We're Going Nowhere,
Touching The Roof,
On The Top Of The World

We're Getting Close
To Another System,
We Said Goodbye
And We're Sure We're Gonna Miss Em...
