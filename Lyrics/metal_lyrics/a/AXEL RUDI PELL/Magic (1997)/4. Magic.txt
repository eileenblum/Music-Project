:AXEL RUDI PELL]

Somewhere In The Distance,
Was A Place You Can't Describe,
All People Lived In Anger,
They Thought It Wasn't Right, They Called It Tragedy

All Fools, They Disappeared,
They Were Lost And Never Seen,
Sometimes You Hear The Screams
Of The Souls Of The Undead In The Midnight Hour

Don't walk Alone,
Hide Your Skin And Your Bones,
Beware Of All Dark In The Night

It's Magic,
It's Magic,
Burning Symbols On The Wall,
It's Magic,
They Searched For You, They Search For All

Living For Today,
'Cause Tomorrow Never Comes,
Oh Lord, They Have To Pray,
That No Evil's Coming Out Of The Rotten Swamp

At The Houses Of The Holy,
They Tried To Break The Walls,
Their Whispered Dream To Turn The Key, An Evil Laugh
And They Knew, They Will Be Restrained.....
