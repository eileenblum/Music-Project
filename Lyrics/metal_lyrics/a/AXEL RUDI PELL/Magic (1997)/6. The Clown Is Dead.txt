:AXEL RUDI PELL]

The Death Of A Clown
Reminds You All Lifetime,
A Lake Full Of Tears
Overflowed The World.

The Reaper Brought Pain,
So Sad Are The Children,
Their Time Of Mourning
Will Be Forever.

Where Did He Go,
No Laughter In Heaven,
Where Did He Go,
Where Did He Stay?

The Clown Is Dead,
The Laughter Is Gone,
The Clown Is Dead,
A Life's On The Run.

Behind His Mask, 
He Was Only Human,
A Person Who Feels
Like You And Me.

Can't You See The Light,
The Star That Shined So Bright,
Was It A Lucky Sign,
From Someone Who Says "I'm Allright"...

The Clown Is Dead
...Will The Laughter Return...
We'll Never Know...

[Spoken Words:]
Innocence, Laughter, Madness,
Tears, Death, Heaven, Pain...
