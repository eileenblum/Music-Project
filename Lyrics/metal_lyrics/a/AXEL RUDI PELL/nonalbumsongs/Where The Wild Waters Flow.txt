[2011 "The Ballads IV" compilation track]When the sun lost its shadow
And heaven cries on a rainy day
Silent whispers, echoes in the distance
Scary voices bringing fear and pain

See the light leading out on eerie darkness
It's shining down, still a long way to go

Where the wild waters flow
And black roses fail to grow
Where the wild waters flow
And the black roses fail to grow
Fail to grow

Hear the wild horses neighing
Climbing the stairs of doom
To a world which was locked before behind the velvet moon
Coming all alone out of the dark, will we survive?
Hiding the secret dungeon 'til the sun will rise

See the light leading out on eerie darkness
It's shining down, still a long way to go

Where the wild waters flow
And black roses fail to grow
Where the wild waters flow
And the black roses fail to grow

Sometimes you wonder and look into the crystal ball
There's no time for surrender with your back to the wall

Where the wild waters flow
And black roses fail to grow
Where the wild waters flow
And the black roses fail to grow

We'll be lost forever
One night, one night to remember, yeah yeah
Where the wild waters flow, fail to grow
Where the wild waters flow...
