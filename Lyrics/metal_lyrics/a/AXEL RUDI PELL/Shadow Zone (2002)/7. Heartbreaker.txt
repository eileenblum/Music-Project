Not long ago we saw each other
For the first time at a show of a friend
We talked for hours in a round
We were glad that we've been found

And the sparkle in your eyes
Tells me (for) sure you don't know why
You left me alone

You're my Heartbreaker
I'm lost in the shadow of love
Heartbreaker
Alone and ready to fight

We shared the years, we shared each moment
Everyday on the phone late at night
You changed your mind, your heart was blinded
By your thoughts, that wasn't right for us

But the sparkle in your eyes
Makes me hope love will survive
And you'll come back to me

You're my Heartbreaker
I'm lost in the shadow of love
Heartbreaker
Alone and ready to fight

You're my Heartbreaker
I'm lost in the shadow of love
Heartbreaker
Alone and ready to fight

You're my Heartbreaker
I'm lost in the shadow of love
Heartbreaker
Alone and ready to fight

You're my Heartbreaker
I'm lost in the shadow of love
Heartbreaker
[Alone and lost] forever

You're my Heartbreaker
Don't leave me, don't [...]
Heartbreaker
Alone and ready to fight

Don't leave me alone
