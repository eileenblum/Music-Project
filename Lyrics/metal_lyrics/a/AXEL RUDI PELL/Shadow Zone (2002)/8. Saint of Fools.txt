[Music &amp; Lyrics: Axel Rudi Pell]

In a time not long ago lived a juggler and a fool
Trying to steal away your daydreams
On and on, they carried on to break the crystal ball
But they'll lose in their game with their souls

They're living a lie
In their own world of danger
But when it's lost it's gone forever
Gone forever

Saint of fools
Your life has its own rules
Saint of fools
Your wisdom is your tool
Saint of fools
With the eyes of a stranger
Saint of fools
You're running into danger

The night is gone, the light shines on
And you can see the breed has gone
But the evil left their traces in the mirror

Now they're moving on to a new born home
Somewhere in a new world
But the scars of the past will not be gone

They're living a lie
In their own world of danger
But when it's lost it's gone forever
Gone forever

Saint of fools
Your life has its own rules
Saint of fools
Your wisdom is your tool
Saint of fools
With the eyes of a stranger
Saint of fools
You're running into danger

They got a bad reputation
They are the lords from hell
There will be no salvation
There's nothing more to tell

Saint of fools
Your life has its own rules
Saint of fools
Your wisdom is your tool
Saint of fools
With the eyes of a stranger
Saint of fools
You're running into danger

Saint of fools
And you're running
And you're running
Saint of fools
[...]

Saint of fools
Your life has its own rules
Saint of fools
(Who is your fool?)
Oh yeeeah!
Saint of fools
