From far out of nowhere
Made of water, stone and sand
Came a holy man with evil eyes
To rule the promised land

with the eyes of a stranger
And backed on a thousand wings
He played a game to teach us all
The seven books of sin

We're riding the wind
And searching for the rainbow
We'll get rid of the sin
Near the thunder roll and feel the cold wind blow

Just follow the sign
Escape from the nightmare
Just follow the sign
Escape from the dream

Looking for glory
And the moon's shot down in flames
He is back again, the evil man
The king of a thousand names

Longing for tomorrow
We escape from yesterday
Riding on the storm, the edge of time
Hope to be back some day

We're riding the wind
And searching for the rainbow
We'll get rid of the sin
Near the thunder roll and feel the cold wind blow

Just follow the sign
Escape from the nightmare
Just follow the sign
Escape from the dream
Dream

Yeeah!

Just follow the sign
Escape from the nightmare
Yeeah!
Just follow the sign
Escape from the dream
We're fallen [angels] riding on the storm
And we are searching for the rainbown
Hear the thunder
Follow the sign
[Oooeh!]
