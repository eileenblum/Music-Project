In the city of the damned
Far away in a holy land
Where they feared his reign of terror

He called the dragons, ruled the land
Cursed the people, they're forever banned
But someone struck him down with holy water

Who's calling his name
(Who's calling his name)
will burn down in flames
He'll be born again
(Be born again)
At his resurrection

He's coming home
Coming home
He's coming home
the revenge of the Pharaoh

He's coming home
Coming home
He's coming home
The revenge of the Pharaoh

Rising from the mouldy grave
The beast is back to make some slaves
It's a never ending nightmare

They cast the spell, tried to win
But lost in vain, the evil's a sin,
The hope was lost and now they surrender

Who's calling his name
(Who's calling his name)
Will burn down in flames
He'll be born again
(Be born again)
At his resurrection

He's coming home
Coming home
He's coming home
The revenge of the Pharaoh

He's coming home
Coming home
He's coming home
The revenge of the Pharaoh

Oooh!

Who's calling his name
(Who's calling his name)
Will burn down in flames
He'll be born again
(Be born again)
At his resurrection

He's coming home
Coming home
He's coming home
The revenge of the Pharaoh

He's coming home
Coming home
He's coming home
The revenge of the Pharaoh

He's coming home
(He casts away his spell)
You're trying to [...]
He's coming home
(The walls of [...])
'Cause I know you're there
I can feel you near
He's coming home
Where is [...] home
I know you're there

He's coming home
The revenge, the revenge
(He's coming home)
He casts away his spell
(Coming home)
He's trying to wish you well
They've lost their way [...]

And the evil's [...]
The evil's [...]
(He's coming home)
Oh I can feel it in the air
He's coming home
(He's coming home)
Oooh!

He's coming home
Coming home
He's coming home...
