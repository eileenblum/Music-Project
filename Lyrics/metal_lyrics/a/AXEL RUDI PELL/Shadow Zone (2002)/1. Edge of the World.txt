In the city of Angels, the city of sin,
Who will survive (and) who's gonna win
Who's been the joker and who's been the fool
The game in the night has its own passion rule

We're losing our minds
Losing (our) souls
Who will restrain
Who can't let go

We're riding on, on the edge of the world
We're riding on, on the edge of the world
We're riding on

Take care of your body, take care of your skin
Don't turn out the lights or you'll never win
Be hunter or hunted in the streets of the night
Don't lose your control and try to survive

We're losing our minds
Losing (our) souls
Who will restrain
Who can't let go

We're riding on, on the edge of the world
We're riding on, on the edge of the world
We ride
We're riding on

We ride
We ride the edge of the world
We're riding on, on the edge of the world
We're riding on, on the edge of the world
The edge of the world

We're riding on, on the edge of the world
We're riding on
We're riding on, on the edge of the world
The edge of the world

We're riding on, on the edge of the world
We're riding on

The edge of the world
We're riding on...
