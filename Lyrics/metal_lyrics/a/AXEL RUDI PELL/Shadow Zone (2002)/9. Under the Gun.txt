(They) searched for love under the moonlight
Sailed on the storm, they touched the sea
(All) hell broke loose, they felt the cold wind blow
On the wings of the cold and rainy shore

Looks like nothing hasn't changed,
"Love, hate, war" it still remains
Lost in the world, like ice melts in the sun
But they'll carry on

Under the gun
Under the gun
Under the gun
And they carry on and on

A world of peace still to remember
They broke the chains to set us free
Lost in the world, like ice melts in the sun
But they'll carry on

Under the gun
Under the gun
Under the gun
And they carry on and on
And on!

Under the gun
Under the gun
Under the gun
And they carry on and on

Under the gun
(Looking in the mirror)
Under the gun
(What have we done)
Under the gun
([Searching] for the [reason])
And they carry on
(And) they carry on
