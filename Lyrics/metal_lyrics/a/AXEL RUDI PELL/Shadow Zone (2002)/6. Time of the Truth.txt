I was born in a cave of a mountain
I couldn't hear they were calling my name
All they said "it's the curse of the haunted"
I couldn't see that they're burned down in flames

Run away from the gates of thunder
Escaping from the scary dream
Holy knights, the seven wonders
(Will) help me through this mystery
Looking back there's a light in the darkness
Shining through the hole in the sky
The walls came down at the wizard's crown
Oh I wish, I wish I could fly

Locked again in a mountain
Dancing through the fire, ice and snow

Oooh, it's the time of the truth
Don't wanna hurt you
The liar and the fool
Oooh, it's the time of the truth
Don't wanna hurt you
The liar and the fool
Woooh...

The grinder and the fallen angel,
The hangman's work was left undone
The gates of life are closed forever
Searching for the midnight sun
Sailing through a sea of shadows
Riding on the edge of time
The hands of doom are searching for you
And you wish, you wish you could fly

Dreams are turning into nightmares
And heaven turned to hell

Oooh, it's the time of the truth
Don't wanna hurt you
The liar and the fool
Oooh, it's the time of the truth
Don't wanna hurt you
The liar and the fool

Woooh...

Oooh, it's the time of the truth
(The time of the truth)
Don't wanna hurt you
The liar and the fool
Oooh, it's the time of the truth
(The time of the truth)
Don't wanna hurt you
The liar and the fool

Oooh, I don't wanna play [...]
Don't wanna hurt you
The liar and the fool
Oooh, it's the time of the truth
(The time of the truth)
I don't wanna hurt you, no
It's the time of the truth

(The time of the truth)
I don't wanna hurt you
I don't wanna play [...]
Yeeah, yeeah
It's the time of the truth
The time of the truth
(The time of the truth)
