A dark night in paradise, the moon was on the rise
Yon can hear the cries when someone dies
On the scaffold in the valley of the king

The knights turned to stone with their flesh and their bones
They were locked in chains in this evil game
Trying to escape from the masquerade

To live for the king,
No one will ever win
You'll turn forever into stone

Hiding from the sun, the mob is on the run
They're coming home again, it never ends
Losing all their minds (and their souls)

To live for the king,
No one will ever win
You'll turn forever into stone

To live for the king,
No one will ever win
You'll turn forever into stone

Oooh! Oh yeah!

Long ago in a land far away
They were living in the garden of evil
They felt the magic, they'd been strong
Burned in fire, turned to stone
And hiding their faces from the sun

Oooh, casting the spell
No you're

Catching a dream and you don't know what it means
Give up your life, live for the king
Catching a dream and you don't know what it means
Give up your life, live for the king

The damned, they lived in anger, built a tower out of stone
And felt the cold wind from the dark side of the moon
The juggler, the holy, the joker and the ghost
Trying to escape out of the valley

Oooh, casting the spell
No you're

Catching a dream and you don't know what it means
Give up your life, live for the king
Catching a dream and you don't know what it means
Give up your life, live for the king

Catching a dream and you don't know what it means
Give up your life, live for the king
Live for the king

Catching a dream and you don't know what it means
Give up your life, live for the king
Catching a dream and you don't know what it means
Give up your life, live for the king

Catching a dream and you don't know what it means
Give up your life, live for the king
Catching a dream and you don't know what it means
Give up your life, live for the king
