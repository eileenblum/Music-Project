He was the toughest guy on our street
Always ready to fight
His girl's a hooker on her knees
Making money all night

The darkness never was so black
All living in danger
The boys are ready to attack
Screaming for anger

Don't stand in his way
Or you might never be seen again

It's may be right or wrong
But he still is on the loose
He's teaching sin
The king of fools

Innocence never last that long
Contrary to the rules
He's a living sin
The king of fools

Better turn your backs to the wall
Never look behind
Regret nothing and stand tall
To truth declined

No one ever really know his name
Downtown in the city
He's searching for fortune and fame
Without luck it's a pity

Don't stand in his way
Or you might never be seen again

It's may be right or wrong
But he still is on the loose
He's teaching sin
The king of fools

Innocence never last that long
Contrary to the rules
He's a living sin
The king of fools

He's teaching sin

It's may be right or wrong
But he still is on the loose
He's teaching sin
The king of fools

Innocence never last that long
Contrary to the rules
He's a living sin
The king of fools

He's a living sin
On a loose
He's the king of fools
