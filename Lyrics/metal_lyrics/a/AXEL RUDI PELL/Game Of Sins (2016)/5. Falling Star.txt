Once there was a magic mountain, raging to the sky
The evil's curse dropped a fountain, now it's do or die
Eternal fire burning bright, on the edge of our time
Scary shadows in the night, the moon refused to shine

Can you see the dragon rising
Shooting fire through the clouds up in the air

Ride through the misty morning
See the lights shining from afar
Wait till the tide is turnin'
And try to catch, catch the falling star

The man of a thousand faces, puts a spell on you
Being there at different places, don't be a fool
You don't care what he'd done, wherever you'll go
You'd be better on the run, time's running too slow
