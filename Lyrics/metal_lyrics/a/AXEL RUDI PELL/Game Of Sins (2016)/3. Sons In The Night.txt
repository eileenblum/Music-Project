On the streets, on the highway, they're cruising at night
No doubt, doin' their way, no ending in sight
Burned rubber on the pavement, filled tank of gasoline
Feel the flames from the muffler, they're born to be free

The road goes on and on, seems to be forever
There's no turning back, getting the brothers together

Sons in the night
Restless and wild
Never surrender
Sons in the night
Ready to fight
No need to defender

Always dealing with danger, tough stuff's all around
Never trusting a stranger, never fall to the ground
No regrets, no backs to the wall, always throwing the dice
Man for man and one for all, bad boys aren't nice
