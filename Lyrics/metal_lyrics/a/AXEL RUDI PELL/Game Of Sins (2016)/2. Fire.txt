High above, fallen angels, now it's do or die
The price you have to pay is high, a drama in the sky
Sole survivor, holy ghost, the writings on the wall
Words ain't what they seem to be, all heroes gonna fall

Out of the shadows and into the sun
Memories remaining and things left undone

Fire Lucifer's rising
Once you got trapped in there is no escape
Fire
No compromising whatever you're trying now it's too late

Flames're reaching higher so will we all fall
The upcoming heat means the end of us all
We sailed into the storm and a new breed was born
We look into the future and a new days dawn
Impending disaster we all left behind
Our prayers got heard, one of a kind
