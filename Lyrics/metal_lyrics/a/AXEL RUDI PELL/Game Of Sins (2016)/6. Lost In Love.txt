Loneliness, keep praying everyday
Still searching for the one who would stay
Living on my own, lighting candles in the dark
My heart turned to stone like a fire needs it's spark

Take my heart, and take my whole life too
I can t help falling in love with you

Lost in love
You and me together
True romance on the rise
Lost in love
Seems to be forever
But the truth is really lies

In my dreams, I m holding you close to me
Am I really that blind, too blind to see
I would do anything for you
Ignoring their saying, don't make yourself a fool
Don't leave me broken, filled my heart with pain
Outside in the cold, I'm standing in the rain
I'm so lost in love, it's getting insane
Please don't leave me this way

I'm lost in love
