Here today, then fade away
Another pray, wish you could stay
Searchin' for answers, in our minds
Looking for solutions, many different times
See the light, still far away
Paradise? It's hard to say

Forever free
Lost and gone
Rise beyond the rainbow
Forever free
Don't be afraid
When it's time to go

Tears fallin' down like rain
Bringing back memories and pain
So many emotions deep in our hearts
Soul mates in heaven, never fallin' apart
