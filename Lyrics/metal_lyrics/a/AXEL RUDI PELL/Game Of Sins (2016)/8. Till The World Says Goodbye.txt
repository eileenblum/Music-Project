Still we.re rolling on the road of broken dreams
Got no idea what it means
Desolation everywhere, smoke filled up the air
There's no hope only despair
Machines took on the world, the wise man taught us wrong
In the eye of the hurricane we can't go on
We don't understand life won't be the same
And we wonder who's to blame
Watching the clock ticking slow
Now the time has come to go

I don't wanna cry
And I don't wanna die
Till the world says goodbye

The words had been spoken, turned out to be all lies
But much too late to decline
The impacts of the global warming left the rivers dry
The songbirds stopped singing in the sky

I don't wanna cry
And I don't wanna die
Till the world says goodbye
