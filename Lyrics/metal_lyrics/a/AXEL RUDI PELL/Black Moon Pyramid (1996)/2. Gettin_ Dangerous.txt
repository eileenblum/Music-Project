: SOTO]

TAKE WHAT U WANT, IF ALL'S WHAT U NEED
WELL, THAT WAS A THING OF THE PAST.
YOURS 4 THE NIGHT &amp; ALL THE NEXT DAY
BUT U KNOW ALL GOOD THINGS NEVER LAST.

ALL THE EVILS U ONCE SAW AS JOY
HAVE FINALLY CAUGHT UP 2 U.
OTHERS MISFORTUNES ARE LESSONS WE'VE LEARNED
IT'S HIGHT TIME WE KNOW WHAT 2 DO...

IT'S GETTIN' DANGEROUS
THE WORLD'S GOING UNDER AS WE FALL
IT'S GETTIN' DANGEROUS
IT'S TIME 2 DECIDE WHEN OUR FATE CALLS

Y DOES THE RAIN CRY ON OUR SOULS
WHILE BLOODSHED TAKES OVER THE STREETS?
Y DOES THE NIGHT DECIDE NOT 2 END
WHEN 2MORROW IS NOW WHAT WE NEED?

DO U REMEMBER A SIMPLER TIME
WHEN DREAMERS COULD FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS?
IT'S SO PLAIN 2 SEE THAT WE'VE DRIFTED SO FAR
IT'S NOT HOW IT ONCE USED 2 BE...

IT'S GETTING' DANGEROUS
THE FURTHER WE GO NOW THE DEEPER WE BURN
IT'S GETTIN' DANGEROUS
IF U DON'T GIVE A DAMN THE WORLD CEASES 2 RETURN.

[REPEAT CHORUS]
