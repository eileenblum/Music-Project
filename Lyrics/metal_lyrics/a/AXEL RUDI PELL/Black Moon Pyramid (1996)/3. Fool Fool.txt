: PELL]

JUST A DREAM OR A TRICK OF ILLUSION, 
HDING BACK FROM A NIGHTMARE.
ENDLESS CIRCLES, SO HOW COULD I KNOW
IS IT TRUE (OR) SHOULD I CARE

FANTASY IS THE NAME OF THE GAME,
BRINGS YOU PASSION AND PAIN, 
MOVING PICTURES RUNNIN' FAST AND SLOW
GONNA DRIVE YOU INSANE.

WHAT ABOUT TOMORROW, 
WHEN THE DREAMS BECOME REALITY, 
THE NIGHTS FULL OF SORROW, 
A GAME BETWEEN YOUAND ME

FOOL, FOOL, 
DON'T WAIT FOR AN ANSWER, 
FOOL, FOOL, 
THE DEVIL IS A DANCER 
FOOL, FOOL, 
DON'T WAIT FOR AN ANSWER, 
FOOL, FOOL, 
THE DEVIL IS A DANCER

GOIN' GROUND THROUGH A TUNNEL OF HATE, 
ENDLESS FEAR AND DISASTER, 
SCARY DREAMS FROM THE OTHER SIDE, 
FROM THE SOUL OF THE MASTER 

[REPEAT BRIDGE]

[REPEAT CHORUS]
