: PELL/SOTO]

SILENCE OF THE NIGHT AND A MOON THAT SHINES 
SO BRIGHT, SCARY MOMENTS ARE FADING AWAY 

ALL LIFE, NO REAL FUTURE WAS IN SIGHT 
BUT I'M ON MY WAY

BURNING FEVER RUNNIN' THROUGH MY VEINS 
LIKE SCREAMING HORSES WHO WILL HAVE NO CHANCE 
IN THE AQUARIUS DANCE 

BREAKING OF THE DAY AND A SUN THAT LEADS THE WAY 
A NEW HORIZON'S HERE 2 STAY 
ALL 2GETHER WE CAN SEE THE OTHER SIDE 
WELL I'M ON MY WAY 

[REPEAT CHORUS]
