: SOTO]

ARE U LAUGHING, ARE U CRYING 
DO U KNOW WHO U ARE? 
IF YOU'RE LIVING WELL THEN Y ARE U DYIN'
YOUR SOUL IS SADLY LEFT &amp; SCARRED. 

SLOWLY TURNING, U TRY 2 LEAVE 
BEFORE THE DAWN, U GOTTA SEE... 

...SEE THE VISIONS IN THE NIGHT 
FUTURE'S BRIGHTER THERE 4 U 
SEE THE VISIONS IN THE NIGHT 
IF YOU'RE LOOKING 4 THE TRUTH. 

ARE U WANDERIN', ARE U SEARCHING 
4 THE MEANING OF YOUR LIFE? 
ARE U WAITING, NOW ARE U FIGHTING, EVERYDAY?
TIME JUST SEEMS 2 PAST U BY. 

EMPTY LIES &amp; AGONY 
BEFORE TOMORROW U GOTTA SEE... 
...WITHIN THE VISIONS OF THE NIGHT.

[REPEAT CHORUS]
