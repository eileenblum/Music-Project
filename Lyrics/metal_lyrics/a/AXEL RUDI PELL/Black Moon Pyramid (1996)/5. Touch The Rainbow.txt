: PELL]

FROM DOWN BELOW YOU CAN SEE THE MOUNTAIN
RAGING HIGH THROUGH THE CLOUD - BURST TO THE SKY

WIND BLOWS COLD THROUGH YOUR MIND AND YOUR SOUL, 
CAN'T BREAK FREE FROM THE FEAR THAT'S SURROUNDING ME.

WANNA LOVE YOU BABY, 
ALL NIGHT LONG.
WANNA HOLD YOU BABY, 
SO STRONG 

LOSE CONTROL, LOSE YOUR SOUL, 
AND TRY TO TOUCH THE RAINBOW

LOSE YOUR SOUL AND GET OUT OF YOUR MIND 
LOSE CONTROL, LOSE YOUR SOUL 

AND TRY TO TOUCH THE RAINBOW 
LOSE YOUR SOUL, AND TOUCH THE RAINBOW

TIME GOES BY AS WE PASSED THE RAINDROPS, 
FIRE AND SNOW, SUCH A LONG LONG WAY TO GO 

MOVIN' ON IN A WORLD OF SHAME, 
DON'T KNOW WHY BUT THE SANDMAN SAID 
GOODBYE

[REPEAT BRIDGE]

[REPEAT CHORUS]
