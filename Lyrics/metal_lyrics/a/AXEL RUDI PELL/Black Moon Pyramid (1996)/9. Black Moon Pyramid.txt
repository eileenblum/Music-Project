: PELL]

THEY CAME OUT OF NOWHERE, 
FROM THE LAND OF THE BROKEN SOULS, 
TO BUILD UP A TOWER, 
WITH THEIR FLESH AND THEIR BONES. 

THEY SAILED ACROSS THE SEVEN SEAS, 
TO BREAK THE SEAL OF SLAVERY 
FROM BEYOND THEY HEARD THE THUNDER 
FROM THE SHIP THAT WENT UNDER THE SEA 

THE MOON WAS SHININ' BRIGHT 
WITH HIS DARKENED PURPLE LIGHT 
TO SPREAD THE WINGS OF WONDER 
WE HAD TO FIND SOME PLACE TO HIDE 

SHADOWS IN THE DARKNESS 
FROM A LIGHT DOWN IN THE BLACK, 
WE'RE DEALING WITH DANGER, 
WILL WE EVER BE COMIN' BACK AGAIN 

OOH HO HO HOOH HO HO 
HOOH HO HO HOOH, WE RAN THROUGH THE FIRE 
OOH HO HO HOOH HO HO 
HOOH HO HO HOOH, TO TOUCH THE FLAMES 
OOH HO HO HOOH HO HO 
HOON HO HO HOOH, WE RAN THROUGH THE FIRE 
OOH HO HO HOOH HO HO 
HOOH HO HO HOOH, TO THE BLACK MOON PYRAMID 

SILENT SCREAMS AND NOISY THOUGHTS 
FILLED THE AIR WITH DANGER, 
HOW CAN WE ESCAPE FROM HERE 
WITHOUT THE PAIN AND ANGER. 

WE CROSSED THE DYING FIELDS OF WAR, 
LOST IN THE WORLD OF (THE) EVIL SCORES, 
TO GET OUT OF INSANITY, 
WE WENT THROUGH THE TEMPLE OF ETERNITY 

[REPEAT CHORUS]

WE SAILED ACROSS THE SEVEN SEAS 
TO BREAK THE SEAL OF INSANITY, OH HOO HOOOH 
WE'RE SLAVES TO THE KING, SLAVES TO THE KING 
OF THE BLACK MOON 

[REPEAT CHORUS]

WE SAILED AWAY, WE SAILED AWAY, TO ETERNITY 
WE WERE LOST IN THE WORLD, (CONTINUE PAGE)

LOST IN THE WORLD, OF MISERY 
WE CROSSED THE FIELD, CROSSED THE FIELD, 
CROSSED THE FIELD, OF THE PRINCE OF DARKNESS

THE MOON WAS SHININ' BRIGHT, 
WITH HIS DARKENED PURPLE LIGHT,
TO THE PYRAMID OF THE BLACK MOON 

WE HEARD FROM THE DANGER, 
OF THE LAND OF THE STRANGER, 
YOU BETTER BE AWARE, BETTER BE AWARE, 

DON'T TRUST THE SHADOW, DON'T TRUST THE
SHADOW OF THE BLACK MOON PYRAMID
