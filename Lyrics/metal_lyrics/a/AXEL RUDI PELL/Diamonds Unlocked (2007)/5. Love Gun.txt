[KISS cover]

I really love you baby
I love what you've got
Let's get together we can get hot
No more tomorrow, baby
Time is today
And girl I can make you feel okay

No place for hidin' baby
And no place to run
And you pull the trigger of my
Love gun, love gun, love gun

And you can't forget me baby
Don't try to lie
And you'll never leave me, mama
So don't try
And I'll be a gambler, baby
Lay down the bet
When we get together, mama
You'll sweat

No place for hidin' baby
And no place to run
And you pull the trigger of my
Love gun, love gun, love gun
Love gun, love gun, love gun

No place for hidin' baby
And no place to run
And you pull the trigger of my
Love gun, love gun, love gun
Love gun, love gun, love gun
