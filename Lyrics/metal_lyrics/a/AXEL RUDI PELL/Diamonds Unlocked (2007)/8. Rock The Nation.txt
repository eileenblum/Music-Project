[Montrose cover]

All Right! Come on, now! Oooh yeah!
Here we go now!

Got it in me, I've got it in me
Ain't gonna quit until it all comes out
Gonna do it, ain't nothin' to it
Just shake my hips, throw my head
Back and shout

Been a long education
But my homework is done
I'm gonna rock the nation
Just-a wanna have fun, yeah!
Have some fun

Gonna shake it and I ain't gonna break it
I'm gonna show you what it's all about
Got it in me, I got it in me
Ain't gonna quit until it all comes out

Been a long education
But my homework is done
I'm gonna rock the nation
Just-a wanna have fun, fun, fun!

Got it in me, got it in me
Don't wanna quit until it all comes out
Gonna shake it babe, ain't gonna break it
I'm gonna show ya' what it's all about

Been a long education
But my homework is done
I'm gonna rock the nation
Rock the nation, rock the nation
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock nation
Wanna have fun
