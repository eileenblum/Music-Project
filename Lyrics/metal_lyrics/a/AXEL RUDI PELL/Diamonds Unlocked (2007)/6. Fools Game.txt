[Michael Bolton cover]

When I met you, oh
You know at first you had me so confused
I used to lay awake at night
Just copin' with the feelings I so long refused, yeah

Well I surrendered my love
I saw you turn your love from cold to ice, darlin'
I put my heart on the line for you, yeah
I put my heart on the line, yeah

First you take me to the highest ground
Then you keep me hanging like some foolish clown

It's such a fool's game, yeah
It's such a fool's game
I keep playing such a fool's game, yeah
I keep on playin', I keep on playin' this fool's game

I can't take another sleepless night
It's time to light the fire down inside of you
I don't mind, I have the sun on my back
To get a feeling that you never knew, you never knew

Got the secret in the palm of your hands
Will you keep it woman, will you break this man

It's such a fool's game
Girl I know you're playing a fool's game, yeah
It's such a fool's game
You keep playing such a fool's game
Fool's game

Girl I know, you're playin' full time
But I may be too late, when you make up your mind

A fool's game
I keep playing such a fool's game
Got me playing this fool's game
Forever keep on playin'
I keep playing this fool's game, yeah
You got me caught up, you got me caught up in this fool's game
Oh, I got my heart in the line
You got me caught in this fool's game
You keep on playin', you keep on playin' this fool's game
I got my heart in the line, my heart in the line
Uh, fool's game
You got me playinh this fool's game
Fool's game
