[The Mission cover]

I'm not scared anymore
I'm not scared of the dark when I sleep with you, with you
And I'm feeling alive
And I'm feeling strong again when I'm with you, with you
And it hits me
Just like a runaway train
And it blows me away
Just like a hurricane
You can make me happy and I hope you feel the same
You make me feel just like a child, a child again

I'm not trapped anymore
Between Madonna and the whore when I lay with you, with you
And the days run away
Like wild horses run away when I'm with you, with you

And I'm breathing you in (breathing you in)
Just like the morning air
And I'm wrapping you around (around)
Just like a skin to wear
You can make me happy and I hope you feel the same
You make me feel just like a child, a child again

Oh sweet thing
I'm born once again
For you sweet thing
Just like a baby again
You make me happy and I hope you feel the same
And I'm in heaven and it feels like a gentle rain
You make me happy and I want you to feel the same
You make me feel like a child, a child again
