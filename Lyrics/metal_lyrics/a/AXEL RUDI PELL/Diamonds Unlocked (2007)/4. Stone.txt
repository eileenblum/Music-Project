[Chris Rea / The Law cover]

Tangled dream and endless highways
Bang the drum in a foreign land
Sometimes I wonder just what I'm chasing
When all I need is the touch of your hand

But I've got no fixed abode I'm out of my own
Babe it gets so cold
Without your love I'm just a stone
Without your love I'm just a stone
Without your love

We all laugh and the jokes get wilder
Staying up, staying out
When we're drinking fade away into the morning
And the strangest cold eats deeper still

But I've got no fixed abode I'm out of my own
Babe it gets so cold
Without your love I'm just a stone
Without your love I'm just a stone
Without your love I'm just a stone

Without your sweet kiss I'm gone forever and
Without your touch I have no control
Without your love I'm just a looser
Without your love I'm just a stone
I'm just a stone without your love

I'm just a stone
Without your love I'm just a stone
Without your love I'm just a stone
Without your love I'm just a stone
Without your love, without your love
Without your love I'm just a stone
