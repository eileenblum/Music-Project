[Riot cover]

Into the darkness that all men must face
Within the brief hours, of your life here on Earth
Pain thrashed into his life, the great prince stood firm
Behind his high and mighty shield, awaiting his turn

Shield at his side, cloak across his breast
His love and his life, they put him through the test
Shine on, shine on, in all of your glory
Shield all your fears, release all your fury

Shine, shine on, through the darkness and the pain
Shine, shine on, Warrior
Shine, shine on, through the wind and the rain
Shine, shine on, Warrior

Shield at his side, cloak across his breast
His love and his life, they put him to the test
Shine on, shine on, in all of your glory
Shield all you fears, release all your fury

Shine, shine on, through the darkness and the pain
Shine, shine on, Warrior
Shine, shine on, through the wind and the rain
Shine, shine on, Warrior

Shine, shine on, shine on
