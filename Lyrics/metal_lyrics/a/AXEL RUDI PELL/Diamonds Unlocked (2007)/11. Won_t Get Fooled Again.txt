[The Who cover]

We'll be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worshiped will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgement of all wrong
He decides and the shotgun sings the song

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a vow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again, fooled again, yeah

The change it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold, that's all
And the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
'Cause the banners, they were flown in the last war

I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a vow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray, yeah
We don't get fooled again, don't, don't get fooled again

I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
Though I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do ya

Yeah
Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss
I'll tip to the new revolution
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
