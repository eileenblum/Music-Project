Well my maker
Must have been a hard heartbreaker
I said my maker
Must have been a hard heartbreaker
I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why

I'm breaking my own heart
Yes I am, tryin'... to love a faker
Heartbreaker

Like a blind man
My little house is on fire
Just like a blind man
My little house is on fire, is on fire

I'm burning my own eyes out
Tryin'... to reach the door
Tryin'... to love a faker

Well the sun is shining
But it sure don't seem to reach my heart
Well the sun is shining
But it sure, it sure don't seem to reach my heart

I'm wasting my whole life
Tryin'... to make a new start

Make a new start
Make a new, a new start
Make a new, make a new start
