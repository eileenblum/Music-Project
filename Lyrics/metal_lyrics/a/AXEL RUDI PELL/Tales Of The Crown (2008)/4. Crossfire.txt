Burning rain kept on falling
A black smoke filled up the air
Dead mill kept controlling drowning out, the evil actor of despair
Can you hear it?

Can you feel the right the wind blows?
Call it out the co circles name
On and on, you have to be strong
Or very soon you'll go insane

Where's the answer? Disillusion to stay alive
A dawn, helping to survive

Standing in the Crossfire
No escape form the flame
Standing in the Crossfire
Trying to break out, too many people lost again

Round and round kept bodies on the ground
Telling their chance of a war
The enemies fight for sorrow, lost victims and no glory
Turning a never-ending story
