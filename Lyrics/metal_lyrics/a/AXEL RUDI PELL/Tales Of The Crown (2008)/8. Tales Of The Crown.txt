Red sky, there's a moon on the new horizon
We're dreaming on the world of broken dreams
Escaping from the Elian inquisition
But the howling in the night goes on and on

Searching for a shelter
Out of cool from the rain
Break the chains of tragedy
Feeling the pain

Unbroken bowmen
Tell the tales of the crown
Even the strong lay
Leave the tears on the ground
Unbroken bowmen
Tell the tales of the crown
Even the strong lay
Leave the tears on the ground

Keep moving on to the edge of the turn
Protect us from the realm of the other side

In a world of dreams, sins and fear
The fools held up the crown to disappear
They tried to get hold of his soul
Like they came on the other world beyond control
The torches are shining in the dark
The shadows of the sword toting a spar

They kept breathing
Our souls kept on bleeding
