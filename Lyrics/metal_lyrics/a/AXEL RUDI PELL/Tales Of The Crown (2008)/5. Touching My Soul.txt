I been on my own for too many years
Searching for love almost in tears
I've cross many rivers, moving all the time
Where is my love, my little piece of mind

Why does anything last forever
Two hearts on fire belongs together

You touching my soul
Forever
You touching my soul
And my love will carry on

Love awaited portion, I'm leaving the truth behind
My restless heart is beating, for the love I will find
A look in the mirror, there is magic in the air
Soon I will win my fight, my final despair

Why does anything last forever
Two hearts on fire belongs together

You touching my soul
Forever
You touching my soul
And my love will carry on

The fire is burning is written on your face

You touching my soul
Forever
You touching my soul
And my love will carry on
