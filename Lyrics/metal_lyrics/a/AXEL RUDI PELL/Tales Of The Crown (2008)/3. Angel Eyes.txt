Hold on restless and the gypsies
Falling down from the stairways of June
Running wild escaping form the devil
Hearing screams in the night

Ramble on, searching for tomorrow
Facing ghosts in the mirror of dreams
Shattered walls cries of sorrow
Throwing vows in the night, scarring flames shinning bright

Angel Eyes
Looking down from heaven, drowning our fools into hell
Angel Eyes
Cast out the evil whispering magical spells
Angel Eyes
Angel Eyes

Angel Eyes
Looking down from heaven, drowning our fools into hell
Angel Eyes
Get rid of the devil, destruction, fear and hate
Angel Eyes

Devil dancers balance
Ranging hell far from heaven to earth
Agonize, no time to surrender
Throwing vows in the night, scarring flames shinning bright
