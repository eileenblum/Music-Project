Rain is falling down from new horizon
We travel on across the seas
Truth then dispense on the ocean
The sirens call under a plea

We're sailing in circles, almost blind
We are at the point of no return

The northern lights keep on shining
Over the ocean and the sea
The northern lights shine on forever
The guiding light for you and me, you and me

From far away we saw the rainbow
Shimmering brightly across the land
We call the rulers of the lenders
Lead us to the world's dead end
