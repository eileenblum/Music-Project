When the earth kept on turning
When the snow fading away
Climb the walls at the end of our time
Sending shivers down the spine

They feeling like those fools in the night, wherever they are
Living ruins with the moon shining bright
Louder than the storm

Higher than the mountains
Reaching the stars
Higher than the shadows
Coming out of the dark, yeah, yeah

Silent screams out in the black rain
Are gone forever with the wind
I know, they can feel it coming
Riding with the sun
