Early in the morning I heard doctor falling, is this all the end?
Surrounded by darkness the way to get out of this strangest dream
Twisting and turning for freedom I'm yearning, trying to be free
Gasp people red in the dark, I'm lost in this misery

A dream or reality?
I wish I could stay alive
Destination is sanity
Is someone to help to survive?

Buried Alive
Scream to survive
Buried Alive
Lock in the casket of fry
I'm Buried Alive

Hearing from the outside the rain and the thunder
Prison quote in the dark
Alone in the night wishing someone is locking at the constant let
I'm true around my dream and my doors are still clear
Or will they all in my soul?
Try to remember what I've been at all
