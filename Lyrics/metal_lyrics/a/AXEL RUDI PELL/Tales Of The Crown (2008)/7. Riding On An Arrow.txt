We travelling on towards our destination
Searching far away to the holy land
The closer we got without hesitation
The sooner we found out is the world a land

Time is passing on as long we ever here
We won't stay long in the garden of fear

Riding on an arrow
Flying through the sky
Riding on an arrow
Flying on so high
We're riding through the sky

We fly in circles trusting no one
The shadows of the world are fading away
Life's in the darkness kept on shining
He's trying to tell the wishing tale, Is here to stay?
