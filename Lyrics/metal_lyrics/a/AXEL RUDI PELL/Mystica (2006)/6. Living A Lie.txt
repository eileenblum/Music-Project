[1. Verse:]
We met on the streets down somewhere
no place to survive
a look in your eyes signalized me
our prospering love
We thought it was heaven, never turned into hell
but only time tells the truth, the wicked spell

[Pre-Chorus:]
Crying in the night
there's no future for you and I

[Chorus:]
Living a lie
cold hearted, time to cry
Living a lie
love will never survive
Living a lie
endless time of sorrow
Living a lie
hopeless life with no tomorrow
(Living a lie)

[2. Verse:]
We danced on the edge of anger
even in the pouring rain
never thought that it's time to surrender
all the tears had been drained
falling down, in and out of love,
the thoughts had been paralyzed
You, the heartlessly demon,
go and get a life

[Ad-libs:]
The scream of anger, the pouring rain
all the tears that you cried
were gone with the wind...
Your heart made of ice, your soul just a stone
Love sucking bitch go and leave me alone
