[1. Verse:]
Still searching for our way, our way through the dark
mountains we left behind, the fire and it's spark
fighting the spell, drowning coins into the wishing well
dreams turned into nightmares and heaven turned into hell

[2. Verse:]
We sailed across the seven seas, lighting candles in the wind
moving on to the midnight sun, rising up again
the twisting and swirling, we're losing the ground, running out of time
The execution of your mind sent shivers down your spine

[Chorus:]
They're cursed by the spell
and turned into fallen angels
they're going through hell
a howl in the night
they're tolling the bell
hiding their faces in the darkness
unhallowed is the sinner, holy is the saint
it's the curse of the damned

[3. Verse:]
Something's in the air, told us to beware
the rain kept on falling and the evil's not too spare
believing the charm, the sword and the gun, seeing cracks in the wall
facing the mask of the devil, carved into stone

[Chorus ad-libs:]
They're cursed by the spell...
and turned into fallen angels...
the curse of the damned...
destination nowhere...
unholy nights.. will they ever survive...
the curse of the damned...
they turned into fallen angels...
and went trough hell...
the curse of the damned...
the curse of the damned...
Ohh ho ho...
Ohh ho ho...
