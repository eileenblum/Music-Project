[1. Verse (mellow):]
Life is unreal, in the darkest dreams
we felt it all, a long time ago
can't find our way through silent screams
searching for the way to go
Too blind to realize
our way will lead through fire 'n ice
dreamings of paradise, prophecies of scary nights

[2. Verse (hard):]
Higher and higher, through the mist and snow
through the fog, a long time to go
out in the cold, but still feel the fire
hearing echoes of darkest desires

[Pre-Chorus:]
On and on
we travel through the danger zone
on and on
You're out on your own

[Chorus:]
In the valley of sin (sin, sin, sin)
bad night to remember
Sin (sin, sin, sin)
they don't let you go
Valley of sin (sin, sin, sin)
bad nights to remember
Sin (sin, sin, sin)
Hear the siren's call

[3. Verse (mellow):]
Masked fools are screaming, death is dancing in the dark
Life without a soul is like a flame without a spark

[4. Verse (hard):]
The faces of doom told us all wrong
whispering tales from the shadow zone
up down the hill, in this full moon night
warriors are waiting for the final fight
