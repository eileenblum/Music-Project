[1. Verse:]
The world's falling down
on our way to the promised land
have we ever been
to this twilight zone before
we touched the rainbow
and crossed the castles of the Kings and Queens
believing what we see
in the night where even eagles aren't free

[Pre-Chorus:]
Mysterious journey
on our way through the gates
black moon on the horizon
sailing on through the oceans of time
will we ever arrive ?

[Chorus:]
Mystica
we travel through shadows
try to hide in the night
Mystica
surrounded by darkness
we fell into the light

[2. Verse:]
As the edge of the world's passing by
we saw an angel
we crossed the hellfire
magical truth from down below
paralyzed knight
on the run still not sure which way to go
