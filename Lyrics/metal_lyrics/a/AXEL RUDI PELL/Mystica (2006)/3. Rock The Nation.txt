[1. Verse:]
The show is over
still hear the ringing in your ears
another day on the road and no to time for fears
The lights turned off
the stage is cleared and empty
the energy level you had turned down completely

[Pre-Chorus:]
Hot nights of thunder
all fists up in the air

[Chorus:]
We are a wild creation
and we will rock this town
we gonna rock the nation
so shout it out loud

[2. Verse:]
A thousand miles away from home
you're locked inside this circus
Stage fright, you try to stay cool and not getting nervous
the countdown starts, a few seconds to go, all hell breaks loose
and you're giving all that you can and sometimes even more

[Chorus 2 and 3:]
We are a wild creation
and we will rock this town
we gonna rock the nation
and there is no doubt

we are no strange sensation
but wanna teach you loud
we gonna rock the nation
and there is no doubt

[B-Part:]
This is your life and it means all to you
This is your time for braking the rules
