[1. Verse:]
Living in cages, with fearful eyes of sorrow
so sad and lonely on their own
dumb and pushed off, no hopes for tomorrow
trembling bones all alone

[Pre-Chorus:]
Lost creatures running blind
But you hope with all the tears you cried

[Chorus:]
There's no chance to live
another torture's passing by
no chance to live
don't want to die
no chance to live
hearing screams from above
mistreated and crying out for love

[2. Verse:]
How can you do such bad things to me
I cannot talk, can't defend and I'm not free
where is the person which really really loves me
and helps me to get out, to be free again

[Chorus ad-libs:]
No chance to live...

much to young to die...
raped souls on the way to the sky...

No chance to live...
Oh lord please hear me calling...
I'm crying out for freedom...
