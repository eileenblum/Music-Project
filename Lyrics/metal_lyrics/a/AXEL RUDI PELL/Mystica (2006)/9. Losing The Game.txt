[1. Verse:]
Running and hiding, out on the run
fast as an arrow or a firing gun
Lucifer's waiting with the evil mob of hell
unholy soldiers, only time will tell

[Pre-Chorus:]
We're sailing on ships of tomorrow
riding into the light

[1. Chorus:]
We touched the wind, hide to survive
we aren't losing the game
damned bloody fights in eternal heights
no one can drive us insane

[2. Verse:]
Rapid fire, crossing shots, screams that filled the air
victimized nightmare, a fight of despair
biting and ripping, the nature of the beast
red sky is burning, rising in the east

[2. Chorus:]
We touched the wind, hide to survive
we aren't losing the game
damned bloody fights in eternal heights
no one can drive us insane

There's a hole in the sky shining through the black clouds
the creatures are losing the game
coming from nowhere and breaking through shrouds
the chalice main share of the blame
