[1. Verse:]
She was the queen of evil
Ridin' on the storm
With the heart of the devil
Will we ever learn

[2. Verse:]
She called the rolling thunder
Cold wind and rain
Tearin' waves from down under
They still can feel the pain

[Bridge:]
Still a long way to go
They were lost in the zone
Dreamin' of a holy wonder
No time to return

[3. Verse:]
They're ridin' to the tower
On the ship of the lost
Storm made of power
And the hull turned to dust

[Chorus:]
Sailing away
Into the fire
Sailing away
Lost children of the sea
