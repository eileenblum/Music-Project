[Intro words:]
Long ago in the enchanted land
They lived in fear and had a hard stand

[1. Verse:]
In the distance beyond the sundown
Down to the world of purgatory
Holy night, the cry of the angels
They chose the one, the one to kill the king

[Bridge:]
They'd been living in a nightmare
In a world of hate and full of despair

[Chorus:]
Take the crown
And take your life in your own hands
Drawbridge down
The night of the demon dance
Take the crown
We're fighting united
Turn it down
Down to the ground

[2. Verse:]
On and on they fought till dawn
The chosen lords of doom
Going down down down the knights are around
Till the rising of the moon

[2. Bridge:]
No more living in the shadows
Released from grace and the bell it tolls
