[1. Verse:]
From the distance came the thunder
And took their breath away
Eternal lights forever
The price they had to pay

[2. Verse:]
The storm of death is comin'
Through the wind and rain
The midnight bell is tolling
The mob is on it's way

[Bridge:]
No one dared to stand in their way
Or else they had to pay

[Chorus:]
They don't know
They don't know
They're the legions of hell
They don't know
Where to go
And they're casting the spell

[3. Verse:]
Echoes in the darkness
Which are hiding from the light
Wheels of time kept turning
The moon ain't shining bright

[4. Verse:]
Black sun on the horizon
The air turned to dust
Rules made from evil
And the water turned to blood

[B-Part:]
The forces of hell,
Infernal lights, demonic nights

[Adlibs:]
We are the legion, the legions of hell
When they're casting the spell
I wish you well
From the distance from far away they had to pay
I wish you well
That's why they are the legions of hell
