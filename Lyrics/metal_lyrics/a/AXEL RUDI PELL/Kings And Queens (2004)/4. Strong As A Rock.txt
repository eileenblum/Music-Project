[1. Verse:]
Looking back at your own
Life lost life, which once was so strong
You ruined your body, toxic indication
Back to the wall, too weak to rock the nation

[Bridge:]
Looking up to the sun in the sky
To higher places, but I don't wanna die

[Chorus:]
Strong as a rock
On the edge to the sky
Strong as a rock
See the angels fly
Strong as a rock
The abyss calls out your name
Strong as a rock
It's yourself you have to blame

[2. Verse:]
Seeing faces on the wall
The monkey on your back, cold turkey's coming home
No escape out of this nightmare
Back in rehab, last try of despair
