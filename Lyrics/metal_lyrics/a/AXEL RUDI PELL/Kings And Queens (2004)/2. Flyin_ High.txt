[1. Verse:]
Ride through the air, heavenly stair
Over mountains, forests and seas
Mystical clouds, creatures around
Stealin' the air that I breathe

[Bridge:]
All alone on the wings of an eagle
Catchin' the eye of the storm
And you wish to put on a curse
On the day you were born

[Chorus:]
Flyin' high
Through the dark of the night
Do or die on the edge of a rainbow

Flyin' high
Safer place out of sight
Touch the sky and feelin' the wind blow

[2. Verse:]
The journey goes on through the twilight of shadows
Passing the moon and the sun
Stars are shining like the eyes of the devil
Lucifer's breed on the run
