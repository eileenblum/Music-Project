[1. Verse:]
You call yourself a lady
With innocent eyes
But your mind drive's me crazy
A devil in disguise
Burnin' nights of passion
Lasting from dusk till dawn
Falling in and out of romance
Forever on and on

[Bridge:]
The heart of the moment's hiding your cold
Hearted lies
Inordinate torment
A waste of time

[Chorus:]
Cold heaven
Feels like hell
You're heart's like a stone /
[2nd:] You drive me insane
Cold heaven
Nothing more to tell
Better leave you alone /
[2nd:] Love's not a game

[2. Verse:]
I used to be your romeo
Your master of sin
But you behave like a gambler
Playing games you can't win
Extinguish the fire
Been blinded by the flame
But there's no more desire
Don't want to feel your pain
