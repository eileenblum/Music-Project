[1. Verse:]
They heard the call from the evil vault
And raised their swords in the air
Kings and Queens, the evil dreams
Their hearts full of steel and despair

[Bridge:]
Rain and thunder
The lightning strikes the earth
And a thousand warriors
They lived and died by the sword

[Chorus:]
On the run
Only the strong will survive
Get on down
Can't escape from the hideaway
On the run
Only the strong will survive
On the wings of no return
Will they ever learn

[2. Verse:]
The battle cry, the call to die
the witch is cating the spell
"Oh Lord" they prayed, no time to wait
don't want to fall into hell
