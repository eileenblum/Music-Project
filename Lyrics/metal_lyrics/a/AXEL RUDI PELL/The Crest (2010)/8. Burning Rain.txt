[Music &amp; Lyrics: Axel Rudi Pell]

Hold on
The sentinel is screaming
All Hell's breaking loose, so don't walk away
But we're leaving all behind, with nothing left to lose
On the way to our journey, we're fading away

Ooh will we ever be back home
Ooh we can't go on

All night long
When we are leaving
We're going black to the dungeons
Through the burning rain
We'd been so strong
But now we are yearning
We are yearning for breathing
In the burning rain

No return
We seem to be hopeless in the night
We wish we could fly but only can crawl
We tried to repress the tragedy, searching for our goal
On the wings of tomorrow we're losing our souls
