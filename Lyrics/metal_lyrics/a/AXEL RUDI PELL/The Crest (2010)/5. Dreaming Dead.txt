[Music &amp; Lyrics: Axel Rudi Pell]

See the fly on the wall
And the spider's sitting closely
Build a church out of stone
And the devil's watching angry

On and on, you open the gates
Calling out Lucifer's name
You left so strong, whatever it takes
Hoping, that it's not too late

Ooh, ho ho ho
You're dreaming dead and felt from the sky
Ooh, ho ho ho
Nightmare goes on and you're wondering why

After dawn the dream goes on
Burning demons kept on scaring
Crying souls in the dark
Dancing ghosts, no regret from the evil
