[Music &amp; Lyrics: Axel Rudi Pell]

I hear some voices in the rain
Coming through clouds on a stormy night
Will it remain
The fear and the pain in the shimmering light at night
All alone in the dark

His glowing eyes are filled with anger
The massive wings are shinning bright
He's causing trouble and danger
There's no return, it's Lucifer's night

In your dreams, in all glory
He's calling out all your names
Life's a neverending store
There's no chance to win this game

In the Devil Zone
Got lost in the night
In the Devil Zone
You scream and shout
You're too young to die
To die

The twilight torture goes on and on
Watching the creatures in the air
Don't lose your mind or you will turn to stone
You cry for help in your dispair
