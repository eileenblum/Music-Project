[Music &amp; Lyrics: Axel Rudi Pell]

Where are we going
To whom are we running too
We search for the answers on and on
The die is cast, we have challenged the fate
And lost rainbow in our hands

A sorrow shared is a sorrow halved
Together we're strong, with our fists up in the air

Our route is wrong
The sails are turning
We can feel the dark side of the sea
The rain goes on
The thunder's roaring
We're sailing on the dark waves of the sea

The siren's are calling
From a time lost long ago
We bear the destiny in our hands
The rain's running cold
Feeling the strong breeze of the ocean
When are we leaving this behind

We sailed across the ocean
On the winds of the sea
We're sailing on the Oceans of Time
We're moving through the twilight
Passed the black moon in our way
We're sailing on the Oceans of Time
