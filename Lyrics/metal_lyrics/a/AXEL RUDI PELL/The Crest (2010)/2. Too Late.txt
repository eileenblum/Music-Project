[Music &amp; Lyrics: Axel Rudi Pell]

We fought some Voodoo
Silent screams in the night
Causing all trouble at midnight
We're fading, but we relieve in the prevision
We're calling for help, for protection

Some think we're dead
Cause we're lost and never found
But our spirit lives on
Some think we're falling
Down to the ground
But still feeling so strong

Too late, the vermin took the throne
No resort, we're under the spell
Too late, our minds have turned to stone
Alone, there's no way out of Hell
We're much too late

We're screaming for vengeance
Waving swords in the round
Rolling the dices of evil
All of a sudden, out of the dark
A light's signalising the ending
