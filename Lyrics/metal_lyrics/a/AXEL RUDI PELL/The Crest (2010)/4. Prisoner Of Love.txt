[Music &amp; Lyrics: Axel Rudi Pell]

Cold winter is coming
All the leaves are falling down
You left without a trace
And leaving me veined
No words of sorrow
Or have I been blind

Still hear your voice all over again
I hear your calling
Calling out my name
Without a warning
I'm prisoner of love

One thing I remember is
All the good times we had
It's hard for to realize
That our love turned into hate
No time to surrender
But you teared my heart apart
Although life goes on
I pray for another start
