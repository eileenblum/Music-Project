[Music &amp; Lyrics: Axel Rudi Pell]

Alone at heart, I was searching for the one
Lost in love, falling tears in the dawn
A call for a job that day led me to that place
Climbing the stairs of doom when I saw your face

Coming undone
You're like an arrow to my heart

Glory night
One date to remember
Glory night
Never felt so strong before
Glory night
My dream, no surrender
Glory night
Two hearts forever more

Walking the same line, we share our life together
Our love's so strong, can't live without the other
No storm, no dark clouds can tear us apart
You're the chosen one deep down in my heart
