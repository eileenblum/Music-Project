Back in the days on the edge of sorrow
Our backs to the wall, there's no tomorrow
A fire in the sky, bringing light to the darkness
A reason to cry 'cause they live and let die

Ah... they are strong, they are alive
Ah... you better take care when they'll arrive

In our wildest dreams
We'll live forever
In our darkest dreams
They'll take us all
In our wildest dreams
We're still together
In our saddest dreams
We're torn apart
The wildest dreams

We're trying to hide on the top of a mountain
Climbed to the sky and far beyond
There ain't no chance, but we'll try to survive
Time's running out and we're sure they'll demise

Ah... they are strong, they are alive
Ah... you better take care when they'll arrive

In our wildest dreams
We'll live forever
In our darkest dreams
They'll take us all
In our wildest dreams
We're still together
In our saddest dreams
We're torn apart

Whoa!

In our wildest dreams
We'll live forever
In our darkest dreams
They'll take us all
In our wildest dreams
We're still together
In our saddest dreams
We're torn apart

Oh, oh, oh!
Whoa, oh, oh!
In the wildest dreams
