Every now and then on sadden days
Thinking about the times I still remember
Heaven full of stars wished they would have stayed
But can't come back, time to surrender

But the force of destiny has changed
All dead and gone or being estranged

Is there life beyond the light
In the valley of the souls we'd lost long ago
Is there life beyond the light
Only in our dreams or in reality

When they were young, silly things in their heads
Enjoying life to the limit
The tide has turned with endless days of pain
But the wish remained to survive

But the force of destiny has changed
All dead and gone or being estranged

Is there life beyond the light
Or is it ending now
Is there life beyond the light
So far away

Is there life beyond the light
In the valley of the souls we'd lost long ago
Is there life beyond the light
Only in our dreams or in reality

In the valley of my souls
Beyond the light
In the valley of our souls
Beyond the light
