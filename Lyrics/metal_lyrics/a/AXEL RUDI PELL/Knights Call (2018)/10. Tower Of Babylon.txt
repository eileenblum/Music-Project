We're travelers on our journey
Through space and time
Get away from mayhem
And runnin' wild

On and on against the tide
Carry on and pay the price

Tower of Babylon
Tower of Babylon

All we saw just turned to dust
Right before our eyes
Hearing echoes
From afar

On and on against the tide
Carry on and pay the price

Tower of Babylon
Tower of Babylon

Tower of Babylon
Tower of Babylon

Blinded in darkness, no way to see
The fallin' angels lookin' at me
We're eight miles high, sailing through the sky
We're fallin' down, fallin' down to earth
Oh...
We've been through thunder, we've been through rain
Seeing light down under, keeping away from the fire
Oh...
I see the tower fallin'
Fallin' down from the sky
And it cries for you and I
We see the fire rising
But the smoke left us blind
And the sun refused to shine
Oh... oh... oh...

Tower of Babylon
Tower of Babylon
