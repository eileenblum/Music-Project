Sometimes I'm dreaming of the past
Making love in the summer while it lasts
But life ain't easy as it seemed
Much tougher and louder than I dreamed

I thought I was living in paradise
And those were the days of my life

The wild and the young
They never look back
The wild and the young
They don't know
The wild and the young
Just wanna have fun
All of their life still to go

The older they get they'll be wiser
Sometimes even up to compromise
The energy, the power, their will to survive
Don't feel for a job from 9 to 5

They think they are living in paradise
And these are the days of their lives

The wild and the young
They never look back
The wild and the young
They don't know
The wild and the young
Just wanna have fun
All of their life still to go

The wild and the young
They never look back
The wild and the young
They don't know
The wild and the young
Just wanna have fun
All of their life still to go

The wild and the young
