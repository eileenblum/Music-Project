They need to find out their way through the storm
The tide is turning rough over sea
Way up on the horizon the sails kiss the sky
Bringing fear but hope for a new tomorrow
Ride on!

No time to remember, escape from the dark
But the rain's falling down to the ground
The crusading knights from a holy land try to reach
The promised land
But never expected this journey through hell

All night long
All night long
Time for movin' on
You better watch out
And don't drift
Into no man's land

They're riding on
The crusaders of doom
They're never gone
On the horizon
They're riding on
The crusaders of doom
They're never gone
On the horizon
Way up in the sky
In the sky

As the prisoners were released
And the screaming mob deceased
Making sure no foe sets foot on land again
Flyin' high, only fools know why
Now there's no more reason to restrain

All night long
All night long
Time for movin' on
You better watch out
And don't drift
Into no man's land

They're riding on
The crusaders of doom
They're never gone
On the horizon
They're riding on
The crusaders of doom
They're never gone
On the horizon
Way up in the sky
In the sky

All night long
All night long
Time for movin' on
You better watch out
And don't drift
Into no man's land

They're riding on
The crusaders of doom
They're never gone
On the horizon
They're riding on
The crusaders of doom
They're never gone
On the horizon

The crusaders, crusaders
The crusaders of doom
The crusaders of doom
