Don't believe life is forever
Just follow the rules while on earth
Unlimited free runs are far away
But nobody no longer wants to stay

No signs for a fast and easy rescue
Still locked in the dirty hole of doom
Everything bad must come to an end
But still no way out to attend

We don't follow the sun
Chained in the dungeon
We don't follow the sun
But tryin' to break the chains

Can't think of an act to regret
But life runs faster than the truth
Tears and lies, things you never forget
Too late and breaking out in cold sweat

We don't follow the sun
Chained in the dungeon
We don't follow the sun
But tryin' to break the chains

We don't follow the sun
Chained in the dungeon
We don't follow the sun
But tryin' to break the chains

Follow the sun
