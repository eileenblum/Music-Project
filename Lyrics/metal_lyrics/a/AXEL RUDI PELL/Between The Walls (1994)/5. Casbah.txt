[Music: Pell / Lyrics: Pell]

Here I go and make my final stand,
Very far away there's the promised
Land.
The eagle came down and took me
Away,
Puts me down in a hole I can't see
The light of day.
Oohoh riding on the wings of
Wonder
Can you feel, the fire from down
Under
Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho - hoho
Oh hoho, dreamin' of the casbah
The wizard prays in his unbroken
Rules
With tears in his eyes for a ship of
Fools
Then we sailed away and the sun
Turned black,
We saw the eyes of the lost and
We're never comin' back.
[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]
