[Music: Pell / Lyrics: Pell]

Oh so long, hide your faces from the
Sun,
From the distance I hear you callin',
'cause you're on the run.
You're one out of millions and
There's no place that you call home,
(It's) an endless turnin' circle,
Nobody cared where you're comin'
From.
Where are you runnin' to, escape
From yesterday
Is this the price you have to pay.
Can't see the sun around, you're
Hidin' in the cave
And if you don't care more, it will
Take you to the grave
You're an outlaw
Undercover in the night
You're an outlaw
There's no heart to jump
Inside
You're an outlaw
Broken hero in the night
You're an outlaw
Running wild
Hear me screaming, it's agony and
Fear,
Shadows in the darkness, there's no
"Life" to appear
I can't go on without love, I'm lost
Behind the wall
I'm the guy who rides the devil, For
Whom the bells toll..
[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]
