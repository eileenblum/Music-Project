[Rodgers, Kirke, Yamauchi, Bundrick, Kossoff]

Take off your hat, kick off your shoes
I know you ain't going anywhere
Look around, all your time you're singing your blues
I know you ain't going anywhere

You've always been a good friend of mine
But you always say farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

Throw down your gun. you might shoot yourself
Or is that what you're trying to do?
Put up a fight, you believe to be right
And some day the sun will shine through

You've always got something to hide
Something you just can't tell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well

But I know what you're wishing for
It's love in a peaceful world
It's love in a peaceful world
And some love in a peaceful world

You've always been a good friend of mine
But you always say farewell
And the only time that you're satisfied
Is with your feet in the wishing well
