[Music: Pell / Lyrics: Pell]

Hangin' out on the street with a
Face full of tears
I couldn't understand why
He puts me down in a hole I don't
Know where to go
That's tearin' at my soul
Endless pains goin' far too long
Broken souls could never be so
Strong - again
I'm an innocent child
Hear me calling
(I'm an) innocent child
Hear me calling
The nice guy was calling, he taught
Us not to fear,
And don't go cryin' to others
He was bad to the bone with a heart
Made of stone
Naked bodies all alone
[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]
