She's gone now,
And the memories starts to fade,
I'm holding,
Holding on til yesterday,
Without your love,
My heart is empty and cold,
Without you near,
Nothing seems clear.

Falling,
Falling,
I can't stop these falling tears.
Falling,
Falling,
I'm missing you,
Where these wasted years?

Together,
We have the world in our hands,
Forever,
Was it that part of the plan,
Without your touch,
I can't feel anymore,
Without your heart,
There's nothing too hard.

Falling,
Falling,
I can't stop these falling tears,
Falling,
Falling,
I'm missing you,
Where these wasted years?
Oh.

Oh.
Falling,
I'm Falling,
I can't stop these falling tears,
No.
Falling,
I'm falling,
I'm missing you,
Where these wasted years?
Now your gone.
And I keep holding on.

I've been falling.
She's gone now
