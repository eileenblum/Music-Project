All over the world there's a feeling that's always the same
A fallen world is a part of the game
Search high and low, someday happen to find the answers
Now, one thing I've learned is to don't work that way

If you can remember, don't hide away from all your fears
Heart as a pretender, and a fool for all your tears

You want love, a feeling from deep inside
Love, is something you cannot hide
You want love, the riddance in your eyes
Love, is something you cannot hide

Fight for the truth, is enough to drive you insane
It all seems to be confusion and pain
Now, someday I know we will follow all our dreams
Escape from the lies and run from the rain

If you can remember, don't hide away from all your fears
Heart as a pretender, and a fool for all your tears

You want love, a feeling from deep inside
Love, is something you cannot hide
You want love, the riddance in your eyes
Love, is something you cannot hide

And every morning you wake up
Is this a dream or is this real?
Will you ever find love again?
Now, tell me what you feel, yeah yeah..

You want love, a feeling from deep inside
Love, is something you cannot hide
You want love, the riddance in your eyes
Love, oh lord!
You want love
Love you feel it deep inside
If you can remember, don't hide your love
