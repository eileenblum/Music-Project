First time I saw your face
By your side was the only place
That I would wanna be
Sometimes and I don't know why
Love can come or it can pass you by
Now you take all the love you gave to me
What you take, yeah
You're tearin' out my heart
Oh

Never thought I'd see the day
You would throw my love away
And oh... it's killing me
One thing you'll never know
How it hurts to let you go
As you turn and walk away from me
I see you waking baby
You're tearin' out me heart
Feel like I been ripped apart
You're tearin' out my heart

Daybreaks, I try to be free
But your memory is haunting me
Oh - there's nothing I can do
All alone in the candlelight
I see your face again tonight
And I feel all the emptiness without you
I'm talking without you
Tearin' out my heart
Oh, I feel like I been ripped apart
Tearin' out my heart

Tearin', tearin', tearin', tearin' out my heart
Tearin', tearin', tearin' out my heart
Tearin', tearin', tearin' out my heart
Tearin', tearin', tearin' out my heart
