I will find you some tomorrow
I will know you by your eyes
Then it will be easy to live on my life
Girl, I know you're out there, can you hear me say
Somewhere, someday, someway

You are so clear in my mind
You are the one I'll make mine
Somewhere, someday, someway
Somewhere, someday...

There's a time for everybody
And I'm living for that day
Though it might come easy on a stony way
I will believe you and I win the play
Somewhere, someday, someway
Somewhere, someday...
You are so clear in my mind
You are the one I'll make mine

Whoever, wherever, two hearts belong together
Whenever, I can't say
Somewhere, someday, someway
Somewhere, someday, someway
Somewhere, someday, someway
Somewhere, someday, someway
