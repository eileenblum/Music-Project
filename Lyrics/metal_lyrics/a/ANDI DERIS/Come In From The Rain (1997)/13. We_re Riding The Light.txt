Unbounded colours are drafting ahead
Lighten a future which we never had
We are the troopers
Riding through space until we die
Riding through space until we die

We're riding the light
Riding the light
We are the damned of the holy reich
We're riding....

First came the liars
The there was hate
The came the fire
And nearly too late
Were sent the troopers
Into the space of human race

We're riding the light
Riding the light
We are the damned of the holy reich
Where is the one?
Where is the one
Leading us home where it's all begun?
We're riding....

We are the troopers
Deep in your minds
We are the troopers
We are the spies

In a dreams without end
It's a dream without end
We are the damned of the holy reich
Where is the one?
Where is the one?
Leading us home where it's all begun?
We're riding....
