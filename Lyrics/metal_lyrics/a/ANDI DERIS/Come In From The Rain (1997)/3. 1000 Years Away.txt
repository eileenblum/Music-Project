A little manchild
High up at the window
His trembling feet at the line
Hey little manchild
Do you see the people?
From high above they're so kind
Do you see the ravens?
It's you whom they're calling
"Come fly with me
We keep on wandering
And all the sorrows
Are simply staying here"

Fly with me over all nights and days
To the eternal place
Thereto where all are going
1000 years away
1000 years away

A little manchild
Lies there on the road
Why in God's name?
Hey little manchild
Do you see the people?
From down below they're so plain
Do you hear the ravens?
It's you whom they're calling
"Come fly with me
And all in morning all will be forgotten
And you were never here"

Fly with me over all nights and days
To the eternal place
Thereto where all are going
1000 years away
You'll be seeing where it's all begun
Who makes the world go round
There where we all meet one day
1000 years away
1000 years away

On the 7th of December, 1995, around 6:30 PM, 
Peter flew with the birds. He was eleven years old.
In that same month, a further 3 children flew like Peter. 
In the following year, 33 more followed. 
Peter had many friends. 
In his last letter he said good-bye to all of them. 
Also to his mother - but not to his father... 
Due to the impact with the ground, at the post-mortem, 
Peter's body showed no sign of the terrible mistreatment he had suffered. 
Later, in tears, his mother said that Peter - wherever he may now be - 
Need no longer live in fear of his drunken father
