You are such a believer
You never will doubt or fall
You have endlessness patience
In whatever you try to solve
You and I, wonder why
You have feel and intention
For what might be wrong or right
I often harmed you and criticized
Too blind, to take in your light
You and I, wonder why

Take my mind under your sun
Show me how I see you
Take my mind under your sun
Dry my fears under your sun

You're always there with a helping hand
Whenever one needs a friend
But you show no expectations
To get back some out of what you've spent
You and I, wonder why

Take my mind under your sun
Show me how I see you
Take my mind under your sun
Dry my fears under your sun
