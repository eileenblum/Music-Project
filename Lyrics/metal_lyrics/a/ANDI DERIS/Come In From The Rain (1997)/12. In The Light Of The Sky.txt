Johnny you see all about tomorrow
Then when the night has come you look up to the sky
Johnny you see all about the sorrows
You wait for a sign to come
You wait for a sign to come
Johnny you'll be taunted like a messiah
When the cross kills again the answer's gone with you
Johnny you are chosen for the higher
Wait for your time to come
You wait for your time to come

In the lights of the sky
Stand all the secrets of the sky
Why are we all so blind?
There's something nearby
Something nearby
In the lights of the sky

Johnny you know all about the fire
Then when the shadows die you see the world in flames
Johnny you know they will call you liar
Then you know your time to come
Then you know your time to come

In the lights of the sky
Stand all the secrets of the sky
Why are we all so blind?
There's something nearby
Something nearby
In the lights of the sky
