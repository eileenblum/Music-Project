Winter has come
And the snow at the window is
Grey as my mind
I'd want to just leave it all behind
Something is out there I need to find
Dark is the night
And the cold is my enemy
I want to hide
But I ain't got no time to flee

Could I leave forever and a day
I would look for a bay
And would there be forever lasting May
I wouldn't change a day

Life is a bitch
Too expensive to be your friend
I wanna fly
Far away where the winter ends
Lay down at the beach
And build castles with sand

Could I leave forever and a day
I would look for a bay
And would there be forever lasting May
I wouldn't change a day
