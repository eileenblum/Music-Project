Jenny had a white heart
Now her face is red with blood
Her eyes that I know laughing
Stare into the rot
Jenny went her last way
On a cold and rainy day

No, she didn't want to live forever
She didn't want to live forever
But she didn't want to go today

Good bye Jenny
I'll see you someday in a better life
Then I'll take good care of you
Good bye Jenny
I'll see you somewhere in another time
Then I may send my tears away

Jenny I know you're fine
And you're smiling down at me
No doubt you are in good hands
I wished I could see
Sorry I'm a bit angry
But you left too suddenly

No, she didn't want to live forever
She didn't want to live forever
But she didn't want to go today

Good bye Jenny
I'll see you someday in a better life
Then I'll take good care of you
Good bye Jenny
I'll see you somewhere in another time
Then I may send my tears away

[To Jenny - 22 September 1996]
