You make me go through your changes
Already gave you my heart and my everything
Now you turn away
You made me tell you my deepest fears
By the faith I had in you yesterday
Where's it all gone today?

But now that I know this ain't love
I still haven't closed it enough
Shouldn't feel the way that I just do
Shouldn't feel that way
But now that I know this ain't love
I still can't get enough

It's like dying of fire
Like the wind blowing word to nowhere
Nothing left to say
And in that morning when you'll b gone
I'll sit down with a pack of cigarettes
Waiting you come home

Now that I know this ain't love
I still haven't closed it enough
Shouldn't feel the way that I just do
Shouldn't feel that way
But now that I know this ain't love
I still can't get enough
