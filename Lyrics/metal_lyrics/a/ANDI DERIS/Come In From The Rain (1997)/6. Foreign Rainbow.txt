Too many people follow too many minds
And we don't cling together if there's nothing to find
Everybody stands alone in the line

Sometimes I hope when I look up to the sky
There's a picture I see but it's not come through my eyes
As if a vision and blindness would have become allies

I can see a foreign rainbow
Of a land behind the sun
There's a world where the winds blow
In our mind, in our soul, in our want

We are so often helpless but we all seem to find
Hope and courage by something odd and strong in our mind
I know this is magic that we all have inside
I know this is magic that we all have inside

I can see a foreign rainbow
Of a land behind the sun
There's a world where the winds blow
In our mind, in our soul, in our want
Built on dreams blameless and callow
Somewhere behind the sky
We can see that foreign rainbow
In our mind, in our soul, there it lies

I see a foreign rainbow 
Somewhere behind the skies
A world whereto the winds blow
In our mind, in our soul, there it lies

I can see a foreign rainbow
Of a land behind the sun
There's a world where the winds blow
In our mind, in our soul, in our want
Built on dreams blameless and callow
Somewhere behind the sky
We can see that foreign rainbow
In our mind, in our soul, there it lies
