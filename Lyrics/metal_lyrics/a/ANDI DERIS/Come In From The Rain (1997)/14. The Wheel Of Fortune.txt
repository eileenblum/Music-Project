It's your turn now
Try to make it right
Take turn now
You're playing for life
Take your turn now
I know you are the one who will arise

Take your turn on the wheel of fortune
Try to break free
Take your turn on the wheel of fortune
Break free, break free

When the sun rises
Then you know it's done
When the sun rises
Then you are the one
When the sun rises
Then the light will never more be gone

Take your turn on the wheel of fortune
Try to break free
Take your turn on the wheel of fortune
Break free, break free
The wheel of fortune
The wheel of fortune
