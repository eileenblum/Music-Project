See all the people waiting for our coming
The town has changed but the stage door's like before
Let it go (Got to take it to shove)
Don't keep em, down (Through the highs and lows)

We are welcome home to the house of pleasure
We ain't got nobody but the house of pleasure

It's not easy as it seems, my friends
We had to fight for with all means, at the end
Let it go (Got to take it to shove)
Don't keep it down (Through the highs and lows)

We are welcome home to the house of pleasure
We ain't got nobody but the house of pleasure
We are welcome home
We are welcome home
We are welcome home
We are welcome
Welcome home to the house of pleasure
We ain't got nobody but the house of pleasure
We are welcome home to the house of pleasure
We ain't got nobody but the house of pleasure
Welcome
