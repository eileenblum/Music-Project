In a thousand years from now the last of the human race
Somewhen had found a shelter somewhere out in space
A tiny planet going Â´round a silver star
But life is dark and cold its sun is just too far

No we havenÂ´t changed no we havenÂ´t changed
Can we be that strange can we rearrange

Will we ever change will we ever change people
Will we ever change will we ever change people

ItÂ´s a strange new world of dawn and biting winter nights
So some got big and rich by selling heat and light
In the deep they found a fuel just awesome safe and clean
But thereÂ´s much more to earn with good old gasoline

No we havenÂ´t changed no we havenÂ´t changed
Can we be that strange can we rearrange

Will we ever change will we ever change 
Will we ever change will we ever change 
Will we ever change people 
Evil brother sister mister lister
Will we ever change will we ever change
Will we ever change will we ever change
Will we ever change people

Will we ever change will we ever change
Will we ever change will we ever

Will we ever change will we ever change 
Will we ever change will we ever change 
Will we ever change will we ever change people 
Evil brother sister mister lister
Will we ever change will we ever change
Will we ever change will we ever change
Will we ever change people
