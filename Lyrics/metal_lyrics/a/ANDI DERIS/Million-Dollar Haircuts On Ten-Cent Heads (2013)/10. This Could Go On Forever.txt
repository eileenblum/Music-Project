Listen how strong the winds are blowing
They sing the salt of the sea into my life
Glad IÂ´m with you babe
Glad IÂ´m with you babe
Glad IÂ´m with you babe
Look how deadly the waves are coming in
If you want to sruvive you get to dive
How I would miss you babe
How I would miss you babe
Miss you babe miss you babe

This could go on forever go on exactly as it is
This could go on forever

Feel the rays cominÂ´ bright and warming
See the grey rip apart because of light
Yeah I got to kiss you babe
Yeah I got to kiss you babe
Yeah I got to kiss you babe
Smell the sulfur right from the mountain
Feel the tremble that wanders in the ground
How I would miss you babe
How I would miss you babe
Miss you babe miss you babe

This could go on forever go on exactly as it is
This could go on forever

Let all be the same enjoy what became
Adore whatÂ´s behind and love whatÂ´s to find

This could go on forever go on exactly as it is
This could go on forever forever

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

This could go on forever go on exactly as it is
This could go on forever yeah
This could go on forever go on exactly as it is
This could go on forever

Let all be the same enjoy what became
Adore whatÂ´s behind and love whatÂ´s to find

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
