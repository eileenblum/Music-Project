This life was solitary myself my sanctuary
Alive but fragmentary 
Day and night a lonesome fight
My dreams got ancillary my mind a cemetary
But just preliminary 
Â´cause here you are to kiss my scares

Yeah now is the last day
The rain comes down on me
Yeah now is the last day the sun keeps hidinÂ´

I drowned in abnegation 
Saw no need to search salvation
Got stuck in blind stagnation 
Paralized self hypnotised
You spoke words of redemption 
Pulled me in your dimension
Life seems like a new invention 
You brought me back into be

Yeah now is the last day
The rain comes down on me
Yeah now is the last day the sun keeps hidinÂ´
Now is the last day the stars wonÂ´t shine for me
Yeah now is the last day we wear these chains
The last days of the rain 

The way it should be the way it should be
ItÂ´s the way it should be

Yeah now is the last day 
The rain comes down on me
Yeah now is the last day the sun keeps hidinÂ´
Now is the last day the stars wonÂ´t shine for me
Yeah now is the last day we wear these chains
The last days of the rain the last days of the rain 
Ooh the last days of the rain
