Go lock your door rather stay inside
But when they come there is nowhere to hide
Not far away everywhere on our earth
They brought the fight to us havenÂ´t you heard

This could be our last day standing
This could be the final ending

DonÂ´t listen to the radio itÂ´s just a game itÂ´s just a show
No battle ships no alien foe donÂ´t listen to the radio

Got laser guns rippinÂ´ buildings apart
ThereÂ´s nothing out here they will skip to bombard
All our troops have been scattered or killed
God help us all now we pay for our guilt

This will be our last day standing
This could be the final ending

DonÂ´t listen to the radio itÂ´s just a game itÂ´s just a show
No battle ships no alien foe donÂ´t listen to the radio

DonÂ´t listen to the radio itÂ´s just a game itÂ´s just a show
No battle ships no alien foe donÂ´t listen to the radio
DonÂ´t listen to the radio itÂ´s just a game itÂ´s just a show
No battle ships no alien foe donÂ´t listen to the radio
