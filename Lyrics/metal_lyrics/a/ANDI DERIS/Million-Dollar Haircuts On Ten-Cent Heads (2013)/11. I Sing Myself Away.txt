I wake up in the night
ThereÂ´s still no morninÂ´ light
So I pour a whisky
My guitar is with me
I sing my self away
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Mm mm mm mm mm mm

I smoke my cigar
I donÂ´t care in my own bar
Have another whisky
Got my beauty with me
I sing myself away
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Mm mm mm mm mm mm

I hear callinÂ´ from the beach
These voices I know each
Shout to take my six string
Come to surf eat and sing
Turn night into day
I sing myself away
I sing myself away
I sing myself away
