[Bonus Track]There are so many pains on so many stories
So many tears have been cried
When the children weep but nobody tells them
No youÂ´re not the ones right
Sometimes pride is killing so many feelings
So little left to survive
When itÂ´s all destroyed and too late to wake up
We asked if truth were the life
No woman no cry no woman no cry

Little lies can lead to heaven
Little rights can be so wrong
And you can tell lead you straight into you know where
Little lies can lead to heaven
Little wrongs can turn up right
Unspoken truth can just keep it alright

There are so many pains on so many stories
So many tears have been cried
When the children weep but nobody tells them
No youÂ´re not the ones right
Sometimes pride is killing so many feelings
So little left to survive
When itÂ´s all destroyed and too late to wake up
We asked if truth were the life
No woman no cry no woman no cry

Little lies can lead to heaven
Little rights can be so wrong
And you can tell lead you straight into you know where
Little lies can lead to heaven
Little wrongs can turn up right
Unspoken truth can just keep it alright

I know this is life I know this is
I know this is life I know this is
I know this is life I know this is
I know this is life I know this is life

Little lies can lead to heaven
Little rights can be so wrong
And you can tell lead you straight into you know where
Little lies can lead to heaven
Little wrongs can turn up right
Unspoken truth can just keep it alright

Little lies little lies little lies
