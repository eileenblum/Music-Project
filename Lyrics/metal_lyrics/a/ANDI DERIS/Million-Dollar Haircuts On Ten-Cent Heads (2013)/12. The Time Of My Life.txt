[Japanese Bonus Track]Hey you can you tell me 
How I achieved to end up here
Hey you are you by my side 
Â´cause you are what you appear
Listen I donÂ´t know why 
But you still hold my sweet lime
Twisted IÂ´m feelinÂ´ good 
And I donÂ´t prossess a dime

The time of my life twists and turns like a knife
Turning all that was good into evil skins me alive
The time of my life twists and turns like a knife
Cutting all that was plain into pieces
Hello you time of my life

Yeah now I remember 
Who I most likely used to be
Damn damn on my wedding day 
I decided just to flee
Sister I have no clue 
Who the flying fuck you are
But baby youÂ´re lookinÂ´ good
So letÂ´s see how cheap you are

The time of my life twists and turns like a knife
Turning all that was good into evil skins me alive
The time of my life twists and turns like a knife
Cutting all that was plain into pieces
Hello you time of my life

The time of my life twists and turns like a knife
Turning all that was good into evil skins me alive
The time of my life twists and turns like a knife
Cutting all that was plain into pieces
Hello you time of my life
