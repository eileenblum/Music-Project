Time is standinÂ´ still
My mind moves on against my will
Life itself goes blind
But leaves a cell where I just find

You you you I know form a distance
But how could this be 
True true true I see myself come closinÂ´ in
ItÂ´s callinÂ´ me itÂ´s callinÂ´ me

Who am I if you are me
When I die where will you be
Who am I who am I

LetÂ´s me go away
I fear this palce and all its night
Help me to awake
I swear this time IÂ´ll stand and fight

Wait wait wait help me please 
Understand before you start to fade fade fade 
Time begins to tick again
IÂ´m fallinÂ´ home IÂ´m fallinÂ´ home

Who am I if you are me
When I die where will you be
Who you are and what youÂ´ll be
Is that my reality who am I who am I 
Who am I who am I who am I

Time is standinÂ´ still time is standinÂ´ still
Time is standinÂ´ still time

You you you I know form a distance
But how could this be 
True true true I see myself come closinÂ´ in
ItÂ´s callinÂ´ me itÂ´s callinÂ´ me

Who am I if you are me
When I die where will you be
Who you are and what youÂ´ll be
Is that my reality who am I who am I who am I
