I believe we can change I believe we have strength
Let us carry the world
We are part of the game we should give it a name
LetÂ´s believe in the same I believe in you

I believe in Enamoria
I believe somewhere it lies
I believe in Enamoria in Enamoria

It can happen to me it might happen to you
We all know this is true
When thereÂ´s someone in need
DonÂ´t step back donÂ´t recede
We all know whatÂ´s to do I believe in you

I believe I believe in Enamoria in Enamoria
I believe I believe somewhere it lies somewhere it lies
I believe I believe in Enamoria in Enamoria
Somewhere it lies somewhere it lies 
Somewhere it lies somewhere it lies somewhere it lies 

I believe in Enamoria
I believe somewhere it lies
I believe in Enamoria

I believe I believe in Enamoria in Enamoria
I believe I believe somewhere it lies somewhere it lies
I believe I believe in Enamoria in Enamoria

I believe in Enamoria in Enamoria
I believe I believe somewhere it lies somewhere it lies
I believe I believe in Enamoria in Enamoria

Somewhere it lies somewhere it lies 
Somewhere it lies somewhere it lies 
Somewhere it lies somewhere it lies 
Somewhere it lies somewhere it lies in you
