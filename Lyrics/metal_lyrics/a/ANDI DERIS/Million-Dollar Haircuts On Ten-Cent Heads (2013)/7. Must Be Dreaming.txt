Aah aah aah aah aah aah aah aah

When I close my eyes just for a while
I gazed at another sphere
Like a different life not far away
But definitely not here I must be dreaminÂ´
There I am a king of just myself
Abode to rule my life
And the queen I love is begginÂ´ me
To finally arrive I must be sleepinÂ´

Aah aah aah aah I must be dreaminÂ´
Am I dreaminÂ´ am I dreaminÂ´
Aah aah aah aah I must be sleepinÂ´
I must be dreaminÂ´ forever dreaminÂ´
I must be dreaminÂ´ all this life
I must be dreaminÂ´ on through my life

There are bigger trees and smaller names
The first must walk behind
To help up the weak and ease their pain
The chore on the devine
Aah aah I must be dreaminÂ´
Aah aah I must be sleepinÂ´

Aah aah aah aah I must be dreaminÂ´
Am I dreaminÂ´ am I dreaminÂ´
Aah aah aah aah I must be sleepinÂ´
I must be dreaminÂ´ forever dreaminÂ´
I must be dreaminÂ´ all this life I must be dreaminÂ´ 
On through my life oh on through my life

Aah aah aah aah aah aah
Am I dreaminÂ´ am I dreaminÂ´
Aah aah aah aah aah aah
I must be dreaminÂ´ forever dreaminÂ´
I must be dreaminÂ´ all this life I must be dreaminÂ´
