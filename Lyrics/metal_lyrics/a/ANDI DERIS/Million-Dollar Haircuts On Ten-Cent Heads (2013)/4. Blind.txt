DonÂ´t want to die to see nor want to live forever
But there is something I must find IÂ´m blind

I got a house and pool bulit on the isle of summer
I should be glad but still I whine IÂ´m blind

No better life without me breakinÂ´ these chains
No better day to wake my mind IÂ´m blind
We are the ones we are the children of change
But still behave like left behind IÂ´m blind

I guess I try to say that we may own whatever
But we canÂ´t buy what we must find IÂ´m blind

No better life without me breakinÂ´ these chains
No better day to wake my mind IÂ´m blind
We are the ones we are the children of change
But still behave like left behind IÂ´m blind

I donÂ´t find my signs I hide I lied cannot break out
My mind is breakinÂ´ my heart is achinÂ´
I want to change now but I donÂ´t know how no

I donÂ´t believe fate is a thief
There must be more weÂ´re livinÂ´ for
We got to go we got to see
WeÂ´ve got to find IÂ´m blind oh oh oh

No better life without me breakinÂ´ these chains
No better day to wake my mind IÂ´m blind
We are the ones we are the children of change
But still behave like left behind IÂ´m blind
