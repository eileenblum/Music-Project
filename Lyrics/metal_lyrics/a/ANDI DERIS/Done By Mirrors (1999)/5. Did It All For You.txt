There was a time
There was a place
Where every flesh was light and laughter
Did not need any nations
All has been one
But you were bored in paradise
There was no thrill and no adventures
So you began to push me
And now you're gone
Way down I did it all for you
Way down I did it all for you
It's said and done
It's said and done
All you are is light in the sun
Way down I did it all for you
You chose a world in material space
And I promised you independence
But you could always call me
I hear you pray 
So many lost their link to me
What was a truth is long forgotten
Now it's time to wake up
And find back home
Way down I did it all for you
Way down I did it all for you
It's said and done
It's said and done
All you are is light in the sun
Way down I did it all for you
