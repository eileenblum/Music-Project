My hair touch my shoulders
My eyes are iceblue
I walk in Mom's kitchen
With dirty wet shoes
I eat with my fingers
I like to bite nails
When I'm bored I watch "Baywatch"
When everything else fails
I am dangerous
I am dangerous
I am a black jack
I'm a maniac
I am dangerous
Dangerous
I am dangerous
I am a mad pig
I am a lunatic
I am dangerous

So cold is my longing
Vanilla-chocolate-cream
Willingly the woman
I'm hunting in my dreams
I buy me a six-pack
And man I never share
I build car-plastic-models
And blow 'em in the air
Dangerous
I am dangerous
I am a psychopath
I am a wicked ass
I am dangerous
Dangerous
I am dangerous
I am a black jack
I'm a maniac
I am dangerous
Dangerous
I am a mad pig
Lunatic
Wicked ass
Psychopath
Dangerous
