Grey days
To be or not to be
Who are we
It's a mystery
Always
We have bleeded for
The Grail of life
Though it's just next door
The best you don't need to pay for
The best you don't wait to come
The best you don't need to pay for
Always on the run

Time flies
Many thousand years
And slowly
The stupor disappears
People
Stand up one by one
To find out
What makes the world go round
The best you don't need to pay for
The best you don't need to buy
The best you don't need to pay for
Recall and realise
The best you don't need to fight for
The best you don't wait to come
The best you don't need to pay for
Always on the run
The best you don't need to pay for
