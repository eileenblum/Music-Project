All I had now is gone
Was not always alone
Now yet shed my last tear
For the child of my fear
What is true for my eyes
Could be all made up in disguise
Once out there now is here
It's the child of my fear
These words I'm singing
These days I'm giving
These tears I'm paying 
But my child of my fear is staying
On and on

It tells lies over me
Or I'm not what I think to be
Gave up all that was dear
For the child of my fear
Like a silent thief
Stole my faith my belief
What was doubt now is clear
I'm the child of my fear
These words I'm singing
These days I'm giving
These tears I'm paying 
But my child of my fear is staying
There roads I'd taken
Seemed all mistaken
Now the truth was spoken
And I feel the spell is broken
Gone
Forever gone
