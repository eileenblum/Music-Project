Somewhere when I'm dead and gone
I will stand there justifying
Was I living my life for
The shadowside or was I shining
Many times I drove in
The wrong way for long
But those who kept moving
Forever lost home
They follow the evil
I knew that they would
I don't believe in good
I don't believe in good
Don't believe in the good
I don't believe
I got no reason I should
No belief in the good
I don't believe

Honesty is dying
In as much as corruption grows
Poverty's increasing where the big lie is sold
Now the strong are climbing
The weak are falling down
But I know what happens
When masses hit the ground
A new revolution to add in the books
I don't believe in good
I don't believe in good
Don't believe in the good
I don't believe
I got no reason I should
No belief in the good
I don't believe
In you
