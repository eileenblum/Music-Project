Should I break like my father?
Should I cry like my mother?
Had I stayed with the others
I had not found my brothers
Free
Yeah we are free
Had I followed my teachers
Like the christian the preachers
I had not cut the wire
Which tied up my desire
Free
Yeah we are free
Free
Yeah we are free
I want to fly
I want to be 
I want kiss eternity
I have a dream
I have a time
Tomorrow is a friend of mine
To you and me
We are free
Yeah we are free
We are free
Free
