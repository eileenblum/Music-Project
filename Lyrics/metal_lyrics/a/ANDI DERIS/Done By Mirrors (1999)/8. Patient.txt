(Strong education)
I live now and today
(Securitisation)
I'm willing to pay
(Future prospects and expectations)
Just space the words you want to say
(Your social order)
Yeah I got to stand up
(Ethical border)
And I got to get out
(Economical deep, keep your head above water)
Just call me unreasonably proud
Don't want to patient
I don't want to hide
I want to run wild
Don't want to patient
Will not be patient
Let me just fly
One time only try
Don't want to patient
Will not be patient no more

(Working condition)
I've a dream in my head
(Name and position)
That's why some call me mad
(Colour of skin, religion and mission)
When I feel good some make it bad
(Political sides)
When visions are gone
(Your family ties)
We waited too long
(Favorite temptation and sexual wise)
We die but once we were strong
Don't want to patient
I don't want to hide
I want to run wild
Don't want to patient
Will not be patient
Let me just fly
One time only try
Don't want to patient
Will not be patient no more

I don't want to hide
I want to run wild
Don't want to patient
Will not be patient
Let me just fly
One time only try
Don't want to patient
Will not be patient no more
