[written by Ralph Mason &amp; Andi Deris]

Time is a healer
For everything that hurts inside
For things you've been going through
Stealing your pride
Making you cry
I'm picking up the prices
Of what I once felt inside
A world full of promises
And memories cut like a knife
Do you really wanna know
They way that I feel
Though you've been such a long time
Running away
You really wanna know
That's I'd beg and steal
Though I don't really know if you
Remember me

Love is a dealer
Selling your heart and soul
Taking your everything
When you can't give enough
When you're starting to fall
I'm the pretender
Pretending I'm doing fine
But nothing makes sense to me
Cause there are mountains between us
Made of space and time
Do you really wanna know
They way that I feel
Though you've been such a long time
Running away
You really wanna know
That's I'd beg and steal
Though I don't really know if you
Remember me

All the pain and sorrows
All the echoes of promises
Make me feel I'm eternally
Lost and never found
Do you really wanna know
They way that I feel
Though you've been such a long time
Running away
You really wanna know
That's I'd beg and steal
Though I don't really know if you
Remember me
