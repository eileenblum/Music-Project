Listen brothers and sisters
I know that you cry
There is you and no others
And damn you know why
Do you know what I mean?
Do you know what I mean?
Hey what do you do?
Follow me and let your love fly free
Hold on let's get it done
Follow me and let your love fly free
Let your love fly free

Do you feel when it's calling?
Or suffer in pain?
Did you ever try to face it
And call it by name?
Do you feel what you feel?
Really feel what you feel?
Hey you what do you do?
Follow me and let your love fly free
Hold on let's get it done
Follow me and let your love fly free
Let your love fly free
