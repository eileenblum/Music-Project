It's like an open file
Spreading out
Burning higher
It's a game
You know the name
Still it goes the same
Like a guiding angel
White in white
Plain essential
For my life
For my mind
Still so much to find
I love you more than I can say
A little bit more each day
Hey I love you
A little bit more each day
I love you
A little bit more each day

It's like a giant cyclone
From a breeze we raised it to storm
And the rain was followed by
Royal in the sky
And it's like every hour
Without you is ache and sorrow
It's a game
You know the name
Still it goes the same
I love you more than I can say
Before and after
I love you more than I can say
A little bit more each day
Hey I love you
A little bit more each day
I love you
