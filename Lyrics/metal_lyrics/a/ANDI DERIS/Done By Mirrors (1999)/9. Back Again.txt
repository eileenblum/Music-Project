Life is what I'm bringing
Pain is what I'm killing
Hope is what you need to give me
Dust to dust and energy to energy
I'm gonna fill up your hearts
I'm gonna fill up your hearts
Now I'm back again
To make you see
Yes I'm back again
I walk on water where was sand
I'm back again
I hope I make you understand
I'm back again
For you

Death is your own decision
Once you dared a timeless mission
Lost in mind and mere forgotten
Sleeps the power you have gotten
I'm gonna fill up your hearts
I'm gonna fill up your hearts
Now I'm back again
To make you see
Yes I'm back again
I walk on water where was sand
I'm back again
I hope I make you understand
I'm back again
