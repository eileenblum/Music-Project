[Music: Schuliga/Aldridge, Lyrics: Dower]

Consigned to the tomb, to sleep, to dream forever.
Rotting... dissolving in my grave clothes, my
flesh turns to soup.
A distant thud, as a shovel parts the earth.
By moon lit night, a looming shadow... sunken
eyes, gaze up to the stars.
My shrouded, decomposing corpse,
sprawled on frozen marble.
Carefully unwrapping,
your putrid, fly-blown prize.
Disrobed you sit upon me,
straddling my death remains.
Momentum slowly building makes a horrid
slushing sound.

[Ch] Stench rising, blood thirsting
Flesh peeling, sores bursting
[Rpt]
Gripping tight to my exposed ribs,
your cumming in a frenzy.
Draining every bit of love my body has to offer.
Kissing teeth where lips once sat,
a foul and bitter taste.
Lapping at my putrid flesh,
you puke into my sockets.

[Ch] Stench rising, blood thirsting
Flesh peeling, sores bursting

Your task is complete. My corpse lies in a heap.
Spewing forth my rotten dregs... dribbling,
oozing down your legs.
