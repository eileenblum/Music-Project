A burning tree death came screaming from the sky
Igniting the old, wise mystery tree
As the flames reach higher the devils appear
Only one target in their mind
Horror, destruction enslave them all
What's left of humankind
Is only the burning tree
Those who fight back against the enemy
Devils of the deep darkness will conquer all of earth
It started with the burning tree
The flames went deeper
Until ashes were all you could see
The flames went deep
What's left of humankind
Is only the burning tree
Those who fight back against the enemy
Devils of the deep darkness will conquer all of earth
Who are we to judge their mortality
Creatures of the dark live in slavery
Their time burns faster as they do wrong
I, I know I used to be one
What's left of humankind
Is only the burning tree
Those who fight back against the enemy
Devils of the deep darkness will conquer all of earth
Only a sapling was left, saved by a child from the roaring inferno.
