Older than the art of fire
The earth breeds all life
The wind blows through every tree
A storm of wisdom conquers the sea
We are the wisdom of the earth
New life is born under every full moon
The earth craves death to be in bloom
Spread all the roots when you've got time
Or let the tide wash you out like sand
