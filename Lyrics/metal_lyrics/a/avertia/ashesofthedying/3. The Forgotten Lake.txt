When there were fire in the woods and it all burned to the ground there was a small lake untouched by the age of men
Deeper than the truth you seek the lake dig down in the deep
The forces were awoken by the lord of the great star. If they only knew about that place â the world would breathe at a calmer pace.

The lake was forgotten by those who survived. An era was over â a new one begun. The forest will come back again wait and you will see. The forgotten lake will create new life to be.

The men who survived â never found the lake. Until this day it is still untouched by men.
