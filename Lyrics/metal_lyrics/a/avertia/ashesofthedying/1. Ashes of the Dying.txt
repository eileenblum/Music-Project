Fueled by the foulness from my poisoned wound â slowly turning to the dark side of the fjord. No return to the daylight. My future is set â sharp axes await.

I deal death with an axe and a torch. I see souls as they wander in the bleakness. Behind great trees â and in the deep seas. The past, now, and in the future.

The task you gave me when we met still haunts me. The burning oak â sap is dripping, branches creaking and dying.

This is the last you will ever hear from me. A silent letter â written in ash on a tomb stone.

The wandering souls await my presence. Smoke my ashes and let me be present.
