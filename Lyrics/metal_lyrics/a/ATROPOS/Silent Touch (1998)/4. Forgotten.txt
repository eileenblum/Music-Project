Birth 
Sin
Jesus
Set

Born in pain
As shiny soul
To rot between
The shine and shade

I am the lord of the world
He said
I am the master of time
He thought
He jumped
He's lost
And the world persists

My spirit
Rounds
Over the memory of milliards
Of souls decaying on
The bank of Styx
And over the dreams
Of unborn

This is the work of man and
Gods
Of present and future
Life

And the sky will stay
Blue
