Between the corridors
of darkness
I enter the Hell

A little dwarf
wearing satanic cloth
spreads his wings of destiny above me
He jumps on his short legs
in passing catching the toads
spread on the naked rocks
His face is wrinkled

His eyes are diabolic

I look on the cloud
in my innocence
to learn how the twilight
looks like

Dreams gather
my body on fire
up into infernal
eternity
The last wish

Black Orchid
