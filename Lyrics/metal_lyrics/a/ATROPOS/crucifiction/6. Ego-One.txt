A gasp, quickly stiffled, comes from the shadows beyond the fire
A shriek pierces the flame-lit night
The final cry of a creature in torment
Tree branches sway in the wind, and the fire's flames dance

Are you brave enough to undertake a sacred mission?
Do not hesitate. Do not fear
You are now the Seeker
Do you wish to become a sacrifice?

Your heart sinks in cursed weakness
Your mind plummets into surrender
Your life slides down to defeat
You loose your soul to blackness

Create yourself as God
Offer yourself to yourself
Become your own paragon of beauty
Pray to yourself to satisfy your needs

Hellish fire licks at you
If you believe in hell 
Heavenly punishment shall reach you 
If you believe in heaven

Seek for creation, seek for your name
I bestow upon you a power of the Enlightened
I give you the light, I show you the past 
I betray you showing you the path

I open the gates of sorrow
I open the gates of joy
I push you to open your eyes
I open the book of ego

Try to revive - you as the One
The power lurks deeply in your thoughts
