UNRI.DARE.S

The Sun strangles the Night
Burning down the earth
Fire kisses me at dawn
Demolishing my dreams

The Moon bleeds on the clouds
Loosing fight for life
Arch of gold prevails
Crushing tears of dew

I struggle to rise to meet the fiery face
Like a cloud of storms to defeat the light
I set sails in black, I deny my eyes
Willing to survive punishment of day

I come armed with stone beating as my heart 
Baptised in the ice to fight off the glaze
I dare to stand up, I break in the heat 
I stand up to fight for my Mother night

Man can feel heat of torch
When the day rises from the dead
It comes through the mist of dying Night
Announced by convulsed shriek of Dawn

Meet my companions,
my friars of the Nightshade Order
Chaos and Fates gathered with the knights
We dare to challenge the life
We dare to challenge our instincts
We fly up high, we refuse to die in dust 
We dare to deny our humanity
We dare to enjoy profanity
Of bloodshed and lust 
We dare to be wild wild beasts
Until we die free in the arms of desired dusk

Chaos let us live, we outstrip the gods
The Night gave us birth 
We replace the Fates

Columns of the world made of lie and clay
Soft like flesh of god fall into disgrace

We come as the wind blowing from the sands
Challengers of Souls, Order of the Fight

We Desecrate the Garden, Eden of the Men
We defeat the Sun

We will set our will free preaching for the fall 
In the name of Chaos, in the name of Shade
Never flee from heat, timid by the light
Join the war of lust - join the sixth crusade

I struggle to rise to meet the fiery face
Like a cloud of storms to defeat the light
I set sails in black, I deny my eyes
Willing to survive punishment of day

I come armed with stone beating as my heart 
Baptised in the ice to fight off the glaze
I dare to stand up, I break in the heat 
I stand up to fight for my Mother night
