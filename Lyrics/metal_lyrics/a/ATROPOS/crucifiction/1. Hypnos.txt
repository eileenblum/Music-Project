..Nemus...Dacos...Cabid...Leebo..

Spirits of the Western Portal 
For your names
Kingdom of Dream 
Opens human eyes for billions of planes

..Nemus...Dacos...Cabid...Leebo..

Beyond the Tower of the West 
Human dreams mix with threads of eternity
For Hypnos reigns where thought has a shape
He keeps watch on a treasure of the space of Zin

We follow the Valley of Dream looking at the cobweb of minds
Plans, unreal dreams braid making 
The Net of our existence, for they determine
Our actions and future steps

As long as Morpheus doesn't destroy the spell
I dream looking in your thoughts
I control your steps, like you were a puppet on the strings
You are a puppet in my hands

Hypnos! Hypnos!
Hypnos! I repeat the name for million times

Through the Western Portal following thoughts flit
We are the Guardians of Eternity
