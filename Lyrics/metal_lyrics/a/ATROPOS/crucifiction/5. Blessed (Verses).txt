For devil himself
Masquerades as the angel of light
It's not surprising then 
If his servants masquerade
As servants of so-called
Righteousness

Blessed are you 
When men hate you 
When they exlude you 
Insult you and reject your name as evil 
Because of who you are

Blessed is the one
Who trusts in man 
Who depends on his flesh for his strenght
And whose heart turns away 
From the light

Above all guard your heart 
For it is a wellspring of your might

Your end will be 
What your actions deserve
What your force decides

A man's pride will bring him high
And the power of spirit
Will retain 
Honour
