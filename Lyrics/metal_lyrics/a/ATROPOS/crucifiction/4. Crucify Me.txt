Here I come
Above the shine
Below the Darkness
To you - blinded by light

Crucify me if I lie
Crucify me if you dare

I can feel your fear 
I can see your thrill and sweat
Try to catch my eyes
Try to find my fear within

Crucify me if I lie
Crucify me if you dare

Fighting with my weakness, forcing silent moment
Anger in my heart, fever in my mind
Victory of Will 

I don't believe you're able to defeat my soul 
Anger in my heart, fever in my mind
For the victory of Will 

Crucify me if I lie
Crucify me 
Here I come
