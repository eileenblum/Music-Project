We revere burning sin
Eternal fire of disgrace
Hear the voice of the closest space
Divine moaning of the dead

Glorification of human beastliness
Disorder of human reflex
Animal instinct of life
Animal life after death

Madness in vague ideas
Drowning amidst the mind
Scattered by dripping blood
Of deadly distress of aeons

Severance of insanity
Has been made a martial merit
We follow the wish of ourselves
To divine end of the dead

We revere bestiality 
Eternal fire of disgrace
We obey the voice of internal space
Divine scream of the dead
