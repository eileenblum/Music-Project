Fear comes at dawn
In the moments free from dreams
When sunlight
Burns the peace of the silence of night
Of nocturnal dream, in ourselves
The stone and steel spout with the beams of sparks
Inside they light the torches so that the balefires could live
The call to fight for another day
Everyday the indomitable powers wake in us
They lay down the shades behind us
So that we could severe
What is unknown and what is inconceivable
The shadow is a sublimacy of our evil
For us
Only to be
The heresy in front of the whole world
Desires, which we cannot overcome
