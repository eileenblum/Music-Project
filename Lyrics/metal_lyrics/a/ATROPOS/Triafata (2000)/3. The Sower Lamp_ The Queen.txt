I am
The Guardian, animistic angel
Creeping to his Queen
His burnt offering
Fiery dragon
Waiting with the shackles

I was sentenced to death
By the highest courts
To decay, to burn, to rust
For disobeying the heart

Body torn to pieces
By the devilish thoughts
Mind in the shelter of desires
Brought by the darkest dreams

The statuesque sower

Disgrace frisks with the purity
Rape thunders over the clouds
Of the infamous lust

The Guardian... the angel...
The Queen.. the sower...

'... and the Queen received the sower...'
'... and the dragon limbed the angel...'
... and I opened my wounds...
... and I paid with my head...

Lord! Receive my soul!
I accept the punishment submissively...

I was sentenced to death
By the highest courts
To decay, to burn, to rust
For disobeying the heart

Body torn to pieces
By the devilish thoughts
Mind in the shelter of desires
Brought by the darkest dreams

Disgrace frisks with the purity
Rape thunders over the clouds
Of the infamous lust
