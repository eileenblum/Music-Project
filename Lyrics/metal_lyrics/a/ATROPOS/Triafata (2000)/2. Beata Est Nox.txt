The Night
Is the best confidante

Like no friend
Listens
Like no lover
Quaffs the tears
Instead of advising
Calls the thoughts by her silence

I leave
Day by day
I love
Day by day
I am
Day by day
I vanish...

(But when you're alone with her)
The Pain
Demonstrates its world outlook most loudly too
Noisy gnome
Which you can overcome only
When you unite your powers with the Night
In Love
And without Hatred

Beata est Nox

I leave
Day by day
I love
Day by day
I am
Day by day
I vanish
Day by day...

The Pain...
Demonstrates...
most loudly...
Noisy gnome
