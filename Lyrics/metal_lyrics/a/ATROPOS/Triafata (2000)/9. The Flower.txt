In the love downfalls
I seize my graves with myself like black ghost.
Queen Night is hugging me,
She wants to cure my wounds, to allay my pain.
From the crown of the everlasting oak
Floats the alleviation for the mundane self
Which is calling The Flower,
Whispering It's Name
With it's chapped lips.
Had Baudelaire known
The flower of desires,
This kind of flower?
The flower of life...
Cruel Nymph! Be...
The flower of desires,
The flower of life...
My heart is overflowing with pain
My soul is playing cards with hatred
Love
Buried in rubble
Trembles
In the long agony
The fire burns, although is covered up with sand
And salt
Eating up the wounds
In the love downfalls
I seize my graves with myself like black ghost.
Queen Night is hugging me,
She wants to cure my wounds, to allay my pain.
