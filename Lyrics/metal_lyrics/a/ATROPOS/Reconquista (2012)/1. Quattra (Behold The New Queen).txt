Behold the New Queen coming!
Behold the New Queen coming!
Behold the New Queen coming!
Behold the New Queen coming!

The Three welcome the Fourth One
The Three bow and hail
The Three become The Four
The New Queen has arisen

I am the shepherd of the wolves
Howling the name of the Queen
I am the Son of the Fourth
I am the carrier of Her Name

Step back when the New Queen approaches
Nod when She passes by
For She's the One
Whom the Three welcome tonight

It's the time of coronation
As the Fourth Queen arrives
The Queen has been born!
Long live the Queen!

I am the prophet of the Fourth One
As She pointed at me and called my name
She restrains my hand, determines my paths
She opens new perspective

The Fourth means Revolution
The Fourth means Reason
The Fourth means Liberty
The Fourth means the New Order

Revolted minds are stronger
They reach for Liberty
Quattra is only Reason, a Foundation
Of the New Order

So step back when the Queen approaches
Nod when She passes by
For She's the One
Whom the Three welcome tonight

I am the prophet of the Fourth One
As She pointed at me and called my name
She restrains my hand, determines my paths
She opens new perspective
