Hot liquid is dripping like a stream
Filled with life we run from the plinth of the world
Farther and farther from the place where the flame of our being
Glows to admonish the ones
And teach the others....

Alive and strong in the beginning of our way
Full of will to fight we push our lives to the place
Where glaring glow of experience will be invisible
It burns our dreams at ease
Our past

As drops of wax we congeal
Where invisible flame won't blaze us
We congeal in silence, in strangest poses
We fall asleep...

Unconscious
In silence

One day

Alive and strong in the beginning of our way
Full of will to fight we push our lives to the place
Where glaring glow of experience will be invisible
It burns our dreams at ease
Our past

The flame will seize us ...together with us it will destroy all
We've been building through our lives

Alive and strong in the beginning of our way
Full of will to fight we push our lives to the place
Where glaring glow of experience will be invisible
It burns our dreams at ease
Our past

For brightness
For vagrant
For admonishment and teaching..

You are the fuel of god ...
