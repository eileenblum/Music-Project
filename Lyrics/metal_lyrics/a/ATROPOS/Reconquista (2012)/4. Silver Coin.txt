Silence of dawn hung over me,
Taffeta covered all sounds and noise..

Silence..

..Dark besetting my thoughts sunk in every day,
It filled the air and every breath..

It's night.

You vanish beyond the horizon of dreams
And your presence becomes unreachable
Even for deepest desires.

Women tease me with their smell
Their ogle, never realized touch
A fingertip gliding on the lip..
Temptation often is pleasant to time.

Frightened I run from the world to the dark and night.
In me.

A close in silence of a flower,
Black tulip,
Reproaching myself an the world,
That on a contrary to all,
Premises, desires, beliefs, opinions,

I still remember

I hate you when I'm alone and
I hate you when you think of me
Only to love you again when you come

Indeed, love is like a whore,
For her body one has to pay in advance;
For every minute with you
Thirty silver coins I give in the hand of Judas..

Frightened I run from the world
To the dark and night in me.
A close in silence of a flower,
Black tulip, reproaching myself and the world

You vanish beyond
The horizon of dreams
And your presence becomes unreachable
Even for deepest desires
