No past, but presence, but future is ours
No past, but future â the time is now!
Rising flow cannot be stopped
Anger and power will swell again

We are the ones, I am the one
Twilight of gods, clash of creators

We live full of life, not frightened by light
There is no sin, no punishment
No fear of death, as death is the end
And after you die, you're dead forever

You are the one, I am the one
The Pantheon of the present
Follower of the Three, rulers of today
For the time is now, for the time is ours!

Take my flesh and blood, all of you, eat and drink it
Mother Night and powerful living Moirae
We praise and thank you through our thoughts
Your Beings change our hearts
For this we should never cease to aim glory of our egoes

Mishearing yesterday is a betrayal of ourselves
For we have to remember the past
For the presence and future cannot repeat
The sins of the past generations

Chaos and fire are indefensible
We will carry the sword of Chaos
For we must reconstruct what God had spoiled
For we will enthrone the Daughters of the Night

No past, but presence, but future is ours
No past, but future â the time is now!
Rising flow cannot be stopped
Anger and power will swell again

We are the ones, I am the one
Twilight of gods, clash of creators
You are the one, I am the one
The Pantheon of the present
