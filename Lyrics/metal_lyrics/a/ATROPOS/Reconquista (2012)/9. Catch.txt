[originally by Kosheen]Catch you
You create misery
Have your cake and eat it
Take your place in history
And pray we don't repeat it
Call it faith, call it back, call it off
Don't call me later
Lay your head in your pain
It's just how you make it

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out off my way I'm coming
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out off my way start running
I'm gonna catch you

It's your day believe it
It's your date with destiny
It's to late to leave it
After all it's your it's your party
Call it luck, call it faith, call me beautiful to my face
Call it out to my to surprise
It's just how you make it

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out off my way I'm coming
I?m gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out off my way I'm coming
I'm gonna catch you

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out off my way I'm coming
I'm gonna catch you if I can

Out off my way I'm running
I'm gonna catch you if I can
Out off my way I'm coming
I'm gonna catch you
