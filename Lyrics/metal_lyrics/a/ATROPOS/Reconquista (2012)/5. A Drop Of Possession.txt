When you call my name
Strange whisperings silently step in your thoughts
When you raise your voice
My breath becomes your breath

I am a part of you

Wake a spirit in you
Feel that the body is a jug
Pour over your spite, pour a part of yourself
Into the emptiness, show my anger

I am a maxim of an unspoken sentence
I am your thought lost in a dream
A dream you've never dreamt
I am your shadow that people fear

In the day of eclipse
In the noise of thoughts
You keep repeating one word
Subconsciously trying to catch it

Wake a spirit in you
Feel that the body is a jug
Pour over your spite, pour a part of yourself
Into the emptiness, show my anger

I am a maxim of an unspoken sentence
I am your thought lost in a dream
A dream you've never dreamt
I am your shadow that people fear

It blows the skull
It hurts the heart
It leads to faint
I am you
You are me
We're two-sexual
Surrealism touched your reality

I am a part of you

Wake a spirit in you
Feel that the body is a jug
Pour over your spite, pour a part of yourself
Into the emptiness, show my anger

I am a maxim of an unspoken sentence
I am your thought lost in a dream
A dream you've never dreamt
I am your shadow that people fear

In the day of eclipse
In the noise of thoughts
You keep repeating one word
Subconsciously trying to catch it
