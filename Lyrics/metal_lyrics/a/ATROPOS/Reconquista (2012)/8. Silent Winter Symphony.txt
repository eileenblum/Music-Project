Skeletal princess touching eternity
Silent fluttering of wings
In the midst of breath of million

If we lived eternally
Would my breath on your body be eternal?
Everything is like dispersion of dust by the wind
Recollection kills ticking of the clock

How easy is to profane eternity
The living touch the dead
To believe in future

I believe in one death, non-existence of saints
Authentic death of the "saviour"
And reward, and love under will
..life is a silent winter symphony..

If we lived eternally
Would my breath on your body be eternal?
Recollection kills ticking of the clock

How easy is to profane eternity
The living touch the dead
To believe in future

If we lived forever
Would my memory, left by myself, be eternal?
Everything is a hollow prayer before wooden idol
A prayer of a def-mute
