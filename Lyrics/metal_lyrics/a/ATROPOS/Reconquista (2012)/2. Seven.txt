Pride gives the sight of self-confidence
Avarice or Greed, egotic supremacy
Envy reaches for goal clearing your way

For the power of Vengeance
And My Names they unite
For the sake of Demon
We â as Eight â approach

Seven Powers of Deadly Sins
Come to support me
For Antichrist is lurking
In every human beast

Wrath, better known as Anger
Unifies Pride, Greed and Envy
Lust propels the hand, directs the strike
Gluttony, like Avarice and their sister â Lust
Give pleasure
Finally, Sloth is a reward
Gained by the brave, taken from the weak

For the power of Vengeance
And My Names they unite
For the sake of Demon
We â as Eight â approach

Seven Powers of Deadly Sins
Come to support me
For Antichrist is lurking
In every human beast


Touch the tight ropes
Spark of power
Smell of blood
The power of hatred

Lucifer, Mammon, Asmodeus,
Satan, Beelzebub, Leviathan, Belphegor

Self-knowledge means knowledge of sin
My heart shows the way o the ungodly
In excessive, perverted love the man gave them birth
The sins are not nameless or faceless

Pride, one of Perversions, leading the harness
Arrogant, naughty, delicate creature of gods
Feeding on compassion, faithful until death
She is the goddess, the queen, the first and the one

Pride, Greed, Wrath or Anger
Lust, Gluttony, Sloth â the Seven
Ancestors of Freedom, Earthly Angels
Foundation of the man, self-revelation

For the power of Vengeance
And My Names they unite
For the sake of Demon
We â as Eight â approach

Seven Powers of Deadly Sins
Come to support me
Antichrist is lurking
In every human beast
