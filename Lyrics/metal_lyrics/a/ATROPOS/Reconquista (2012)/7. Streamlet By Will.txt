Essence of life, pure, unstained by emotion..
Power flows in our veins

Power of creation or every creature
Dependent only on us

From my hand life flows as a streamlet
A life that I give under my will

You who watch for the day if your death
When you close your eyes!
Your minds bound by eternal fetters
Can you feel how the worm nibbles your thoughts?

From my hand life flows as a streamlet
A life that I give under my will

Here I spit on every picture of absolute
Wove by you in terrifying vision
In depths of our souls
The sleeping â dead rests
His thoughts like a stream
Mix with a flow of desires

Here I spit on every symbol of faith
Created by you to silence your fear

For I am the God
Through me runs the path to Catharsis

From my hand life flows as a streamlet
A life that I give under my will
