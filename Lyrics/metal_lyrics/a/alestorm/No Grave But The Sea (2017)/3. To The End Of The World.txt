A codex of doom from a deep catacomb
A dusty old volume of lore
Hidden within this annal of sin
Confounding the doctrine of sphere
Science has lied since the dawn of mankind
This world is a fragment of four
3000 years of deception must end
Free from the shackles of time

Conjectural convolution
Exposing mathematical flaws
Armed with sedition and armored with truth
Lay waste to the doctrine of law

Ride into the storm!
To the end of the world!
(Under the sign of the cube of time)
Ride into the storm!
Set fire to the sky!
(The truth will be told as the circle unfolds)
Ride into the storm!
To the end of the world!
(Onwards we go to the world below)
Ride into the storm!
Defying the tide!
(Questing the seas with a vengeance)
We're riding the storm
To the end of the world

Perspective is why
The earth and the sky
Converge into one
This can't be undone
As sure as hell
Lies deep down below
Around the earth
The sun doth go

Haunted by dreams of a perilous quest
The nightmare revolves in my mind
A vision unfolds, the mission is clear
Set sail to the end of the world
Wielding the timecube, my voyage begins
Westward into the unknown
Once and for all the truth will be told
Heliocentric demise

Empirical revolution
Fighting the fraudulent scourge
Over the apex and to the unknown
Cross the terrestrial verge

Ride into the storm!
To the end of the world!
(Under the sign of the cube of time)
Ride into the storm!
Set fire to the sky!
(The truth will be told as the circle unfolds)
Ride into the storm!
To the end of the world!
(Onwards we go to the world below)
Ride into the storm!
Defying the tide!
(Questing the seas with a vengeance)
We're riding the storm
To the end of the world

Cross the firmament
Over the edge of darkness
Cronos guide the way
Through the Elysian Fields

Cross the firmament
Over the edge of darkness
Cronos guide the way
Through the Elysian Fields

Face reality
Shatter the false deception
Taste enlightenment
Of the true nature of time

Face reality
Shatter the false deception
Taste enlightenment
Of the true nature of time

Forged in the fires of chaos
Earth is a fragments of time
Onwards, voyaging onwards
Far we have followed the sign
The price of our human existence
Paid in the sins of the past
Aeons, spiraling aeons
Entropy conquered at last

Ride into the storm!
To the end of the world!
(Under the sign of the cube of time)
Ride into the storm!
Set fire to the sky!
(The truth will be told as the circle unfolds)
Ride into the storm!
To the end of the world!
(Onwards we go to the world below)
Ride into the storm!
Defying the tide!
(Questing the seas with a vengeance of human existence)
We're riding the storm
To the end of the world
