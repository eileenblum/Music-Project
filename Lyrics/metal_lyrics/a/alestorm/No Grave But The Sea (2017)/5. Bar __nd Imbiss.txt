One night I sailed the seas
Of dark Thuringia
I thirsted for an ale
So I headed to a bar
Schlumpfi was the name
I saw above the door
A curious smell came flowing out
So I went inside for more

I see the man called Schlumpfi
Behind the oaken bar
"Welcome to my tavern!"
He cries with open arms
"Schnitzels by the dozen
We have for you to eat
Sausages and local beer
It's quite the gourmet treat"

Cold winds are blowing
The night is dark and long
Raise up a tankard
And join in our song

Plunder with thunder, kill for the thrill
Drink up me hearties 'til we've had our fill
Raise up your tankard, into the sky
Pirates forever from now 'til we die
Fighting together with swords in our hands
Stealing their wenches and scouring their lands
Plunder with thunder, kill for the thrill
Drink up me hearties 'til we've had our fill

I try to fill my tankard
With a pint of that ol' spiced
"No" he says, "you must pay up,
My drinks come at a price"
So of course I did
What's natural to me
I took my flintlock out
And shot him through the knees

We drank the tavern dry
Devoured all the meats
We kidnapped his ugly wife
Then took off through the streets

Plunder with thunder, kill for the thrill
Drink up me hearties 'til we've had our fill
Raise up your tankard, into the sky
Pirates forever from now 'til we die
Fighting together with swords in our hands
Stealing their wenches and scouring their lands
Plunder with thunder, kill for the thrill
Drink up me hearties 'til we've had our fill

Plunder with thunder, kill for the thrill
Drink up me hearties 'til we've had our fill
Raise up your tankard, into the sky
Pirates forever from now 'til we die
Fighting together with swords in our hands
Stealing their wenches and scouring their lands
Plunder with thunder, kill for the thrill
Drink up me hearties 'til we've had our fill
