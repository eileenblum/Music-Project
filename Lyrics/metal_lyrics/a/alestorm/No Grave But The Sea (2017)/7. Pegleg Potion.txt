Far away in a secret cove
In the land of Sgriubh-Ã¡-dubh
We hide our mighty pirate ship
From the eyes of folks like you
Aboard the good ship Matey
We brew a toxic punch
It looks a bit like gravy
And it tastes like captain crunch

Ephemeral, delectable
Entirely undetectable
You'll need a pair of spectacles
For diplomatic dog

I sail the seas of Sgriubh-Ã¡-dubh Island
So pour me a glass of the pegleg potion
Always on the search for treasure
So pour me a glass of the pegleg potion
Drink to the end of time

Take one part finest spirit
From Caribbean seas
Mix it up with monkey brains
And the scrapings from your knees
A dash of creme de cacao
A pint of french moonshine
Shake for 15 seconds
Prepare for drinking time

From Oregon to South Dakota
Underwater toilet quota
Driving in an old Toyota
Systematic frog

I sail the seas of Sgriubh-Ã¡-dubh Island
So pour me a glass of the pegleg potion
Always on the search for treasure
So pour me a glass of the pegleg potion
Drink to the end of time

I sail the seas of Sgriubh-Ã¡-dubh Island
So pour me a glass of the pegleg potion
Always on the search for treasure
So pour me a glass of the pegleg potion
Drink to the end of time
We'll drink to the end of time
