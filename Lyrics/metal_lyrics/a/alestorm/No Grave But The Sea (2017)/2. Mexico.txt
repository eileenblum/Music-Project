When the quest is over and the battle's won,
There's a land far to the south where we go to have some fun.

The wenches they are plenty, the alcohol is free,
The party last all through the night, and the alcohol is free.

Woooho, tonight we drink together,
Tomorrow we will die!

Yo ho Mexico! Far to the south where the cactus grow,
Tequila and a Donkey show,
Mexico, Mexico!

Yo ho Mexico! Far to the south where the cactus grow,
Take me away from the ice and the snow,
Let's go to Mexico!

A pirate's life is simple, we drink, steal and kill,
Always we are questing in search of bigger thrills.

We sail across the oceans, get drunk in many bars,
But when we sail to Mexico, that's when we party hard!

Woooho, tonight we drink together,
Woooho, tomorrow we will die!

Yo ho Mexico! Far to the south where the cactus grow,
Tequila and a Donkey show,
Mexico, Mexico!

Yo ho Mexico! Far to the south where the cactus grow,
Take me away from the ice and the snow...

Three margaritas and a taco!
Let's go to Mexico!
