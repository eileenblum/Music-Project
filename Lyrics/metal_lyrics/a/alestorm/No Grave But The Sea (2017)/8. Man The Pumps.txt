Into the oceans of hell, my friend
Into the oceans we ride
Pump with both hands 'til you're back on dry land
We're sailing the seas 'til we die

Well I was just a boy of 12 when I first left the land
I'd never seen a pump before nor held one in my hand
But fate it had in store for me a different destiny
When I joined the crew of the leakiest ship that ever sailed the seas

We were a crew of scurvy dogs but sure we loved to pump
Even though the ship we sailed was just a ragged dump
Every day we pumped together standing side by side
The water kept on creeping in, I thought that we might die

Into the oceans of hell, my friend
Into the oceans we ride
Pump with both hands 'til you're back on dry land
We're sailing the seas 'til we die

Into the oceans of hell, my friend
Into the oceans we ride
Pump with both hands 'til you're back on dry land
We're sailing the seas 'til we die

Twas in the gulf of Mexico we sailed a crimson tide
And all the other pirates began to run and hide
"This is a devil's omen, we cannot pump these seas"
I found myself alone on deck, so the task it fells to me

The pumpy quest ahead of me was ominous and grim
Our ship was sinking rapidly, the red tide flowing in
I battened down the hatches, prepared to do what's right
I screamed a mighty battle cry and pumped all through the night

Into the oceans of hell, my friend
Into the oceans we ride
Pump with both hands 'til you're back on dry land
We're sailing the seas 'til we die

Into the oceans of hell, my friend
Into the oceans we ride
Pump with both hands 'til you're back on dry land
We're sailing the seas 'til we die

Into the oceans of hell, my friend
Into the oceans we ride
Pump with both hands 'til you're back on dry land
We're sailing the seas 'til we die

Into the oceans of hell, my friend
Into the oceans we ride
Pump with both hands 'til you're back on dry land
We're sailing the seas 'til we die
We're sailing the seas 'til we die

Then daylight came, and all was calm, the ship she did not sink
And all the crew did celebrate their rescue from the brink
But when they spied where I did lay, the mood it fell bereft
For by the time the sun arose, I'd pumped myself to death
