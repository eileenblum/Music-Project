How did we come to this place and time
Our lives now ruled by a mariner's rime
We sold our souls to tell this tale
This quest for treasure we regale

With the stars in the sky our guide
Voyage ever onwards
Set a course to the other side
Of the endless oceans blue

Treasure Island
Oh the legends told of a land of rum and plunder
Treasure Island
On a quest for gold we'll sail the seven seas
Treasure Island
Oh the legends told of a land of rum and plunder
Treasure Island
On a quest for gold we'll sail the seven seas
I can't believe we're on our way
We're going there today
Yarr ahoy!

The mate was fixed by the bosun's pike
The bosun brained with a marlinspike
And cookey's throat was marked belike
It had been gripped by fingers ten
And there they lay all good dead men
Like break o'day in a boozing ken

High was the price that was paid this day
We spun the wheel 'til the coffers ran dry
Nevada sun was burning bare
The stench of everclear filled the air

With the stars in the sky our guide
Voyage ever onwards
Set a course to the other side
Of the endless oceans blue

Treasure Island
Oh the legends told of a land of rum and plunder
Treasure Island
On a quest for gold we'll sail the seven seas
Treasure Island
Oh the legends told of a land of rum and plunder
Treasure Island
On a quest for gold we'll sail the seven seas
I can't believe we're on our way
We're going there today

Fifteen men on the dead man's chest
Drink and the devil had done for the rest
But one man of her crew alive
What put to sea was seventy-five

On the endless quest
So far into the west
Where history and destiny collide
Your luck will last forever
And the truth will never die
Prepare to roll the dice just one more time

On the endless quest
So far into the west
Where history and destiny collide
Your luck will last forever
And the truth will never die
The fates shall be eternal on your side
Prepare to roll the dice just one more time

With the stars in the sky our guide
Voyage ever onwards
Set a course to the other side
Of the endless oceans blue

Treasure Island
Oh the legends told of a land of rum and plunder
Treasure Island
On a quest for gold we'll sail the seven seas
Treasure Island
Oh the legends told of a land of rum and plunder
Treasure Island
On a quest for gold we'll sail the seven seas
I can't believe we're on our way
Our destiny lies in the waves
We're going there today
Yarr ahoy!
