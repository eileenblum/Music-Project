[Music: Christopher Bowes Â· Lyrics: Christopher Bowes]

Under the sea, thereâs a colony of bees
And a man named Fred who will shoot you dead
If you try to steal from his apiary sealed
With magic spells at the gate to hell
Heâll kill you in your sleep
If you so much as take a single peek
Set sail across the waves
Where we will stop no man can say
The alcohol stores are running low
So into the deep blue yonder go
Set sail across the waves
Where we will stop no man can say
Weâll end our quest by following the smell
That leads us to the Mead from Hell
He brews his mead with psychotropic weeds
Thatâll get you high, assuming you donât die
And you probably find that it makes you go blind
From the alcoholic proof (itâs through the roof )
We seek the mead from hell
The endless search for the infernal hydromel
Set sail across the waves
Where we will stop no man can say
The alcohol stores are running low
So into the deep blue yonder go
Set sail across the waves
Where we will stop no man can say
Weâll end our quest by following the smell
That leads us to the Mead from Hell
Weâve found the mead from hell
The infernal hydromel
The booze is in our grasp
Now itâs time to kick your ass
Set sail! Set sail! Set sail!
Set sail for the Mead from Hell
