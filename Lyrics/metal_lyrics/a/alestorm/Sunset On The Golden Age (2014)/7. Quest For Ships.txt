[Music: Elliot Vernon &amp; Christopher Bowes Â· Lyrics: Elliot Vernon]

I know a place at the edge of the land
Where the grass runs out and turns into sand
I know a place where a man canât stand
Cos a man canât walk in the sea
I know a place where a man canât go
Where a man would drown and sink below
But if you have a ship then you should know
That you can come with me
Come with me on a quest!
Iâm on a quest, a quest for ships
Sailingâs how I get my kicks
Iâm on a quest, a quest for boats
Iâm mad for anything that floats
Iâm on a quest, to find a craft
A barge or bark or dinghy or raft
Iâm on a quest, a quest for ships
And now I need my fix
I know a place where we can sail
A place I heard of once in a tale
No gems, no gold, no holy grail
A place at the end of the sea
But thereâs one problem I can see
I have no ship that could take me
But if you have one, or two, or three
Then you can come with me
Come with me on a quest!
Iâm on a quest, a quest for ships
Sailingâs how I get my kicks
Iâm on a quest, a quest for boats
Iâm mad for anything that floats
Iâm on a quest, to find a craft
A barge or bark or dinghy or raft
Iâm on a quest, a quest for ships
Wonât return 'til Iâve had my fix
