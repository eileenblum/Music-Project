With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey!
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

Don't try to run, it's all said and done
There's a treasure in sight
We are robbing you blind I hope you don't mind
We are taking it all tonight

Just walk away we will conquer it all
Pirates will stand and the loser will fall

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing
Pirates are all we can be

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey!
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

Down to the core we're coming for more
With a sword close at hand
We are scary and bold, with a chest full of gold
We get sea legs when sighting land

The hook of our captain is looking at you
There's no Peter Pan so what can you do

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing
Pirates are all we can be

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey!
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

[Solo]

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing
Pirates are all we can be

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey!
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey
We're bound to be close to the sea
Our captain will stand on the bridge and sing
Pirates are all we can be

With a hi hi ho and a hi hi hey!
We're hoisting the flag to be free
We will steal the show, Jolly Rogers go
We are wolves of the sea
We are wolves of the sea
