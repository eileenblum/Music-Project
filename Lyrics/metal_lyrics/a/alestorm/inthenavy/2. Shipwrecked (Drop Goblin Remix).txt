It's 3 years to the very day,
Since a pirate captain said to me,
Hey lad come join our crew,
Adventure and glory waits for you!

I took his words as gold,
And set sail for quests untold with a bottle of rum,
In my hand I dreamed of wealth and foreign lands!

Hey! You're banjaxed! Hey! You're screwed!
And death is coming for you!
Trapped on an island lost at sea!
Shipwrecked you'll cease to be!

Hey! You're banjaxed! Hey! You're screwed!
And death is coming for you!
Trapped on an island lost at sea!
Shipwrecked your destiny!

On the 16th night at sea,
In the depths of toil and misery,
We struck a hidden reef,
And our ship began to sink beneath,

I grabbed some drifting wood,
And held on as long as I could,
'Til I landed on a desert isle,
Now I'm stuck here 'til the day I die!

Hey! You're banjaxed! Hey! You're screwed!
And death is coming for you!
Trapped on an island lost at sea!
Shipwrecked you'll cease to be!

Hey! You're banjaxed! Hey! You're screwed!
And death is coming for you!
Trapped on an island lost at sea!
Shipwrecked your destiny!

Shipwrecked! Shipwrecked! Get drunk or die!
Shipwrecked! Shipwrecked! Get Drunk or die!

Hey! You're banjaxed! Hey! You're screwed!
And death is coming for you!
Trapped on an island lost at sea!
Shipwrecked you'll cease to be!

Hey! You're banjaxed! Hey! You're screwed!
And death is coming for you!
Trapped on an island lost at sea!
Shipwrecked your destiny!
