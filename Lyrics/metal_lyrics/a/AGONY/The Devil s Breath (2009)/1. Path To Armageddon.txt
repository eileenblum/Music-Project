Violent pictures of desolation
In my dream, my eyes' obsession
Matter decays, rotting away
Getting closer to the end

Follow your way to doomsday
March away - soul betrayed
Follow your way to doomsday
Nothing to say - rules to obey
Follow your way to doomsday
The sky is grey - clouds of decay

Felling the cold world
Confronting the lies told
Facing no serenity
Resistance`s fire within
Waiting for their killer plan to unfold
Trapped inside their holly wars

No way out... there's no way out of hell
There's no way out of hell
There's no way out of hell
There's no way out of hell
There's no way out of hell

Self destruction
There's no way out of hell
There's no way out of hell
There's no way out of hell
There's no way out of hell

No way out... there's no way out of hell
There's no way out of hell
There's no way out of hell
There's no way out of hell

Self destruction, there's no way out of hell x4
Self destruction!
