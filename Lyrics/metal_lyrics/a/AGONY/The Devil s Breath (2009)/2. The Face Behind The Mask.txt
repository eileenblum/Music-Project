Wake up and look around
Walk through the brave new world
Take me to heaven and drop me like a bomb
Live like it's your last chance and take the risk to fall
People really need to know now it's the time to go
Wake up call, wake up now!

Power, new attitude, crush evil deception
Expose the face behind the mask of hypocrisy

Bring it to life
Wake up and look around
Walk through the brave new world
Take me to heaven and drop me like a bomb
Power, new attitude, crush evil deception
Expose the face behind the mas hypocrisy

Bring it to life - now it`s our time,
Bring it to, bring it to life
Bring it to life - we're so alive-
Bring it to...bring it to life

Now it`s the time to break through
New life joins the world day by day
Better find the best way out
New life joins the world everyday

Wake up and look around
Walk through the brave new world
Take me to heaven and drop me like a bomb
Power, new attitude, crush evil deception
Expose the face behind the mask of hypocrisy

Bing it to life - now it's our time,
Bring it to, bring it to life-
Get up and fight,
We're so alive!
