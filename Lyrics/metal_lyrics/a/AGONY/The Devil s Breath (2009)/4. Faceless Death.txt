Fascist slaves of a superior race
set their minds at a different pace
spreading sickness all over the place
dreams of power beyond their embrace

When everything is turned to dust
the only exit is unknown

Everything the say will make no sense
causing confusion inside our heads
everyday we realize that they are insane
killing people right in our face

When everything is turned to dust
the curse is goin' on and on.... forever

Faceless Death
Faceless Death
Faceless Death
Faceless Death

Lips shot dead
dead eyes cold

Everything the say will make no sense
causing confusion inside our heads
everyday we realize that they are insane
killing people right in our face

Faceless Death
Faceless Death
Faceless Death
Faceless Death
