Spirit hunter bring it on
mindfull journey set it off
inner demons let them go
revelations are about to unfold

Black soul - Dragon - Shaman
flash before my eyes [x4]

We are, we fight, as one
we bleed, we kill, we die

We found ourselves in the darknest place
inside the forest of giant grace

Black soul - Dragon - Shaman
flash before my eyes [x4]

We are, we fight, as one
we bleed, we kill, we die [x2]
Black soul - Dragon - Shaman
flash before my eyes [x4]
die
we...we die
