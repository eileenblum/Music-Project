Take everything you can and even more
Revolution, revelation of your civil war
Cannot take your propaganda anymore
Biased information forevermore
There's not way you'll chance your plans of taking over
Lies are true in the kingdom of the evil one
Sold your soul to open hells door met with mars the god of war
Brought all your enemies to the floor for it is Satan
The one that you adore

Mental holograms - it's all an illusion
It's all an illusion - matrix of confusion
Matrix of confusion - dangerous delusion
Dangerous - mind controlled

Can you see! this is not real!
Can't you see this is unreal?
Pestilence, nothing is real
Hate and greed the greatest deal
Deadly disease, mind is unreal
Detestation the highest ideal

Mental holograms - it's all an illusion
It's all an illusion - matrix of confusion
Matrix of confusion - dangerous delusion
Dangerous - mind controlled

Mental holograms - it's all an illusion
It's all an illusion - matrix of confusion
Matrix of confusion - dangerous delusion
Dangerous
