Lost
Crushed
Lost

An army of Satan
a legion of demons
won't make your Christ
come back to earth

Setting a price on sin,
cutting a pound of flesh
pestilence spread in his name
bloodshed was propelled,
cutting a pound of flesh
slaves, the servants of god

There's no "joy"
there's no "choice"

Nothing and no one will take your soul

up to the sky out of your pain
nothing and no one will take your soul when you die
up to the sky when you die

Preach about giving,
keep the masses in the dark
face eternal damnation
in the jaws of hell
There's no "joy" no "Freedom"
there's no "choice" no "reason"
there's no "joy" no "freedom"
there's no "choice" no "reason"
