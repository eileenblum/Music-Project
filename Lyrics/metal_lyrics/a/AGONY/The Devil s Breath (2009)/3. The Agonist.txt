Lost in her eyes, lost in her daze
lost in her soul, dreamlike despair
vanished in thoughts, nothing remains
bleeding in pain, you're blowing my brain

Into nothingness
worlds of emptiness
gods of mean spirit:
your names i invoke

People bear the mark of Cain
all possessed by psycho brains
i do not believe in this lie
i just want to live my life

Into darkness
world of worthlessness
war between spirit
all strings are pulled

People bear the mark of Cain
all possessed by psycho brains
i do not believe in this lie
i just want to live my life
