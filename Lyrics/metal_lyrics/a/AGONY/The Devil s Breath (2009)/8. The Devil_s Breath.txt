Gone - so gone, gone forever
lost - so lost, lost so clever
fun - it's not fun, lost in anger
alone - so alone, alone and bitter

It take your soul away from - you [x4]

Gone - so gone, gone forever
lost - so lost, lost so clever
fun - it's not fun, lost in anger
alone - so alone, alone and bitter
its demonic presence - make you lose yourself
killing your will - becoming slave
kulling your mind - frying your brain
lost in a cave - digging your grave

It take your soul away from - you [x4]

The blow of death - blinds you out
the forces of evil control your soul
Gone - so gone, gone forever
lost - so lost, lost so clever
fun - it's not fun, lost in anger
alone - so alone, alone and bitter

It take your soul away from - you [x4]
