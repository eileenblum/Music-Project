Semantic of deception
The ultimate war is the war against your mind
Terror - terror
The ultimate war is the war against your mind

No one knows what's going on
All we hear - play on words
Terror -error
No one knows what's going on
All we hear - play on words
The ultimate war is the war against your mind

The ultimate sacrifice, your mind is priceless
Bear with me and take my advice
Cover your ears, close your eyes

Deception
The ultimate transgression
Bear with me till the end
This is the end of civilization

Force fed lies
Lies!
