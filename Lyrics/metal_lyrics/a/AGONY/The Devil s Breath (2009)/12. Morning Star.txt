Away from you and time is refusing to pass
My days are so long and the sun never rises
Fell i drown in the ocean of life
Wanting to find some peace of mind

So, rise again
Come bring back the light again
We're not alone
When lights are off again
Far away from you hand i hear you voice in my head
I'm lost and disturbed, i can't feel anymore

So, rise again
Rise again
We're not alone
Rise again
