The essence of life is bound to no mistakes
natural selection, controls mutation rates
a new state of balance, cellular repair mechanism
unplanned accidents, influenced misbehavior

The truth lies between extremes tying both sides
the people in the middle not knowing what's really behind
waves of violence orchestrated by the hidden hand
toll of sacrifice, seated vegeance, deceit, defeat the enemy

Created the problem
and the reaction
bring the solution
create destruction
crontrol the money
control religion
control society
absolute power [x2]

Covered dictatorship running society
covered dictatorship running society
found the power to curse the fiction - absolute power!
got the power to curse the fiction - absolute power

Endless bloodshed death toll of sacrifice
welcome to the - welcome to the end of time
endless bloodshed death toll of sacrifice
welcome to the - welcome to the end of time
found the power to curse the fiction - absolute power!
got the power to curse the fiction - absolute power

Create the problem
and the reaction
bring the solution
create destruction
control the money
control religion
control society
absolute power [x2]
