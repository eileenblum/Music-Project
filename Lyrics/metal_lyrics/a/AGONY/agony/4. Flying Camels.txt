Forbidden destruction of human remains
Leading to battles against evil face
Fighting and running and slaining with pain
Fading the soldiers that have now no face
Crossing with fear the landmark is near
Breaking with boundries of reality
I can't deny it death feels so close
Flying camels surround you... this dream is so real!!
Getting the power to cross seas of darkness
Being witness of murders on humanity
Victims of slaughters with feelings afire
Ripping agression as blaze burns your soul
Feeling the world turns against man
Changing the rules of your dying mind
Sweat blood of anger tear drops are drying
Flying camels surround you... this dream is so real!!!
Mortally wounded nothing remains
Keep by my side death as only my friend
This dream is over war will never be
Shadows will never let me be in peace
Lies inhabit the troops of sorrow
Waiting to awake in the promised land
Justice is gone my chains take me down
Flying camels surround your... this dream is so real!!
