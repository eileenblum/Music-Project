What is the name you show?
Why is your flag a cross?
Who is the one you care?
Which are the words you pray?
Do you believe? You have a faith?
Do you believe? Do you recall?
You did betray!
What is the ham they caused?
Why can't you just forgive?
Who is behind the wall?
Which is the word untrue?
Do you believe? You have a faith?
Do you believe? Do you recall?
You were betrayed!
They faked, you gave your trust, you put your heart in them
But the answers, the false reasons are reminding shame
They were lying when there was no time for any doubt
Lost your honour, lost your fame, have to wont it back
What is the price of lie?
Why is your soul alive?
Who is the only god?
Which is eternal light?
I do believe! I have my faith!
I do believe! I do recall!
I did betray!
