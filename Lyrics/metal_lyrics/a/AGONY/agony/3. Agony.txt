My whole life is an awful mess
I can't resist any more
I'm suffering
I can deal with death if I want to
Vanish from this earth
Think you have got the key for happiness?
Take your soul away from home
Put away your fucking fear
Feel your heart your brain is cracked
Death life pain blood of agony!
Falling to the end of hell
Only death has the last word
You run so fast you never stop
Burning till the midnight hour
You go insane you feel so weird
Corrosion now is invade in you
I wish I had a fucking belief
That gave me only a simple reason
To leave forever this addiction
Sick in seas of madness
Hate is filling all with sadness
Sickness confussion growing anger
Wrong! Society crush you- Agony
Death will take your soul to hell
Life is only uncounciousness
Pain makes everything so dark
Blood will justify your faith
Don't let those stupid ideas of society
To take you away. Are you a failure?
The wind has taken away every word
You have spoken. Did you ever try
To live the way you feel or want to?
Can't find your way? You are just
A piece of scum in the middle of society
Following crowd's pleasures. Using
That crap stuff to realize that
You are smarter one more creative.
Are you set minded? Can't see
That real world? You are not listening
To your soul. I'm telling you: care
About yourself. The trip has finished
Wake up!
