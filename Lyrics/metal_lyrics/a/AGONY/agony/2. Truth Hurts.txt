Night is breaking, you never know what you're waiting for
Time is running, you can't feel the freedom yet
Look around you, there's no truth in what they do
Hell is calling, only you can save your soul
Fear, slaves, sorrow behind you, break loose, out of the dark side, lost minds, rotten society, mankind, seeking it's rest now
Fire's burning, you want to touch without remorse
Free to see now, the expectec gate is open wide
Pain sorrounds you, better move or fall inside
Choice is waiting, grab your weapon and defeat
Fear, slaves, sorrow behind you, break loose, out of the dark side, lost minds, rotten society, mankind, seeking it's rest now
Push the desire away from your spirit an fight, struggle against
Don't loose your senses and see what they have become,
Dead meat
Truth hurts
Truth hurts
Truth hurts
Truth hurts
Air is thick we cannot breath
Heavy storm's already here
Somethin's watching in the dark
"Why" is always what you ask
Feeling sick world is wrong
Thought bad dreams were never real
Now we pray for a better day
Don't you feel the painful wound
