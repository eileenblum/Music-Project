Can't you find the whores in music?
Pogota
Creeping' souls of human race
Pogota
Can't you get a little knowledge?
Pogota
Get the idea you piece of s**t

Dare to teach me how to slam
now I'll show'em back street music doesn't slam like pogota
when the slam drives us wild
No more nice boys no more costumes, I'll tear off your stupid mask
Feel so good to kick your ass,
Asses to kick, suck my d**k!

Pogota
Wake up, look around you
Pogota
It's the dance of Agony
Pogota
'Cause you're the idiot motherf***er!
Pogota
Asses to kick, suck my d**k!
