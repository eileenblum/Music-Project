Rise [x4]

Long time behind the mask of destruction,
whispers, betrayal, hateMind corruption
spicing my bitter thoughts with loneliness
Who's gonna' give me back my happiness?

Rise [x4]

Connection of nerves, tentacles
Machines programming mindsManipulation [x2]

Old mentality, old mentality was a new child seed for a new man
A new mentality seed for a new world [x2]

Rise [x4]
