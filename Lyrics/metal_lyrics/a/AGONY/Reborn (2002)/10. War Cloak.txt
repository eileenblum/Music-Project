Every day is a storm living with the pain,
I can't figure out how everything's out there
Sickness, insanity, desecration and sadness,
feeling darkness everywhere, every day is the end of evolution

face the end after the war
Millions of weapons of invisible force,
evil minds planning wars anywhere
Flying everyday I'm trying to forget...'cause everything is war inside my head!

That's what I'm trying to forget,
What can I call this???
Auto-war? self-destruction???
All apologies and no inner-construction???

Face the end after the war!!!
It's time to renew the minds
War is the end of any evolution!!!
War cloak - warhead - warfare
Heroes from nothing,

I just wanna' hate you [x4]

That's what I'm trying to forget,
What can I call this???
Auto-war? self-destruction???
All apologies and no inner-construction???

Face the end after the war!!!
It's time to renew the minds
War is the end of any evolution!!!

I just wanna' hate you
yes I just wanna damn you motherf***er
I just wanna' hate you
Die!
