Once upon a time, when the loneliness burned my life into ashes forever
This is not my time; since you're gone the pieces of my trust will never be together

Once upon a time, vengeance came to me and nothing else remained in the spirit but hate,
Disgrace and tears everywhere, sometimes I want to die, end this existence,
My world is falling down, i feel so lost, confused, end this misery,
all this sorrow and pain...

Once upon a time, when the loneliness burned my life into ashes forever
Once upon a time, vengeance came to me and nothing else remained but two hands full of blood
Purifies the spirit, I wanna kill myself, end this existence,
how can I survive, it was a rude awakening, what's left for me?, more frustration and pain

Swallow my pride for a new beginning, open my mind to remain alive
Don't end your life this way, your agony is as my own
Reborn and defeat death, reborn to create again

Swallow my pride for a new beginning, open my mind to remain alive
Don't end your life this way, your agony is as my own
Reborn and defeat death, reborn to create again

Once upon a time, when the loneliness burned my life into ashes forever
