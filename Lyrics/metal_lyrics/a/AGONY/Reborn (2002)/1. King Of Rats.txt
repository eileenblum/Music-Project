I want out! [x4]

End of reaction, now I'm in the worst position,
waiting for the messiah, the one that will never come
I want out of this hell, I don't wanna live this way
cause you're so deep dumped in filth and sh**

KING OF RATS, KING OF RATS
the KING OF RATS is what you have become
The lord of a rotten world
I can hear you, I can see your face, misery my friends?
Why don't you get used to it???
Poverty and death are part of your destiny, have sweet dreams sleep well,
don't wake up you won't feel pain.KING OF RATS, KING OF RATS
the KING OF RATS is what you have become
The lord of a rotten world

KING OF RATS, KING OF RATS
the KING OF RATS is what you have become
The lord of a rotten world

Losing the fight , there is no destiny ,it's all sickness.

KING OF RATS, KING OF RATS
the KING OF RATS is what you have become
The lord of a rotten world

KING OF RATS, KING OF RATS
the KING OF RATS is what you have become
The lord of a rotten world
