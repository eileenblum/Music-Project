I'm getting crazy; I can't stand this anymore [x4]

Regrets, regrets,
so many demons spinning in my head
How can I live? How can I live with myself?
I'm getting crazy, I can't stand this anymore

"-You are nothing but a f**king looser-" [x4]

Betray, betray, is this the world that I'm building everyday?
How can I live...how can I live with this pain?
somebody help me, I'll never go out

The devil stands behind my door, waiting in the dark
This is it, my life is gone, I can feel it coming,
i can fell it coming...no please no!!!

I'm scared, scared and confused, so many demons spinning in my head
I'm scared, scared and confused, I'm getting crazy, I can't stand this anymore
I'm scared, scared of myself, so many demons spinning in my head
I'm scared, scared of my self, the evil one is possessing my dreams...
How can I live? How can I live with this pain?
Somebody help me, I can't stand this anymore

Regrets, regrets, so many demons spinning in my head
How can I live? how can I live with this pain?
Somebody help me, I'll never go out

"-You are nothing but a f**king looser-" [x4]
