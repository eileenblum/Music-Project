Blinded society
Despair runs across their life
Spiritual warfare
Hate runs across mankind
Eye for eye Look their faces and cry
Cry for cry
Dying in this decadent land

Blinded peace
Desire and dreams are subdued
Sarcastic minds
Taking us to sadistic war
Lie for lie
Mankind in the abyss
Do or die
Rotten culture we have crowned

Look the world
Black shadows
Around anywhere
We cry in pain
Weâre losing the calm
People escaping, trusting religion
People lie to win
People lie forevermore
Human kind heading towards the end
False prophets
Puppets of faith
