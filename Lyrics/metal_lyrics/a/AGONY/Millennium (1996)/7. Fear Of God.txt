Fire in the sky
Shining of a human kind
Blazing of my mind
Flight of an endless time
Blink of an eye
Awakening in a past life
Strange fear
Sin traps my soul
Below the earth
I feel the pass of time
Dark silence
Waiting for extinction

Lost in an uncertain future
War I Wonât lose this war
Struggling with my thoughts
Suffer for the last hope

Fear of God
Sacred truth
Pain for the just
Pleasure is paid

A fear of God

And I donât feel
The supreme power of expressing
By the ambition of my ego
Only crying is left
