Sometimes seems that god forget us
That lets us die alone whit our pains
We are playing whit fire
The sadness the pain
Maybe don't have
A hope behind the fear
A misery of life I fall into
My ruins, no preach to live slave
Of fear again to live
And to die in this hell
Motherfucker

Why?
A desperate question
We are playing with fire
The sadness, the pain
Maybe don't have
A hope behind the fear
Between the miseries I have
A misery of life I fall into
My ruins, no preach to live slave
Of fear again to live
And to die in this hell
Motherfucker

Sometimes seems that god forgot us
That lets us die alone whit our pains
I see death as a door, if I knock on
This door
I open other time, other life, another future

Why?
A desperate question
Why?
A question with no answer
I don't come to pray
A know it's hate
Why is it time to die?
A question without answer
