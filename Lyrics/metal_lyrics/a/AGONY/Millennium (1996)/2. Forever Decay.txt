Bleeding tears, forgotten cry,
Fall and die, slaves of liberty,
Screams in pain, sorrow, wars an pests,
I see the souls of black in my mind,
Right to live, never ending life,
The release s not real

Empty minds in the way to die
Brutal insane, gods of steel
Blood and sand under your flag
My release is not real

[CHORUS]
Forever decay
Eternal torment
Empty minds
In the way to die

Hate in my mind, hate is my rule
My morbid dreams, my toxic dreams
I live in a terror zone, darkness inside me
Walls come down, broken space

[CHORUS]

Law in my mind, laws I donât see
Cut your illusion looking whit hate
I take your soul, I take your dreams
I spill my blood, tears are falling
My painâs to die, my fearâs to live
Hate in my mind, my pain is bleeding.
