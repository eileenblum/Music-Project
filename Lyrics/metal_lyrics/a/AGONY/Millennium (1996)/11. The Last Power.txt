Chirac racist motherfucker
Throwing your nuclear shit
Into our ocean
In front of our coast
Killing the fauna and flora
Demonstrating the world your Power
But youâre nothing, just shit
You fucking piece of shit

Worldâs last power
Mutilation, domination
Of the lost empire
Cause we are not your
Slaves anymore
We are no more your puppets!

Fear of the end
Invading you
Evil control
Just hell on earth
Stop the madness
The nuclear scum
Feel the pain Of agony

I hate you

Why donât you throw your scum
In front of your own house?
Why donât you show your egocentricity
In front of your own country?
