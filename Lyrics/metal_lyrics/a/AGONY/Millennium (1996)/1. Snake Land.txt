Governance of a blinded nation
Killing for money, no shame
Terrorize, system of superstitions
Chaos, the meaning of death
Blood is the language
The way and the pain
Cruel destination of war
Nobody wants to stop ignorance
Falling in years of decay
War against the peace
War against the states
War against the people
Aggression, destiny
Death is everywhere
Country of no one else
Rotten system, hunger
Colombia, will you live?

[CHORUS]
Arise
To be alive
Who wants to die?
YouÃ­ll be the next!

War against the peace
War against the states
War against the people
Aggression, destiny
Death is everywhere
Country of no one else
Rotten system, hunger
Colombia, will you live?

[CHORUS]

Governance of a blinded nation
Killing for money, no shame
Terrorize, system of superstitions
Chaos, the meaning of death
Blood is the language
The way and the pain
Cruel destination of war
Nobody wants to stop ignorance
Falling in years of decay
