I was falling again
In the infinite past
Which fastens into the deep
To die in my AGONY

I was growing again In the wicked present
What makes to die
In my deep agony

I was dying again
In the maltreated future
Which uncertainly
Has me a prepared destiny

And my false memory fools me
And my false mind condemns me
And my pain wasted me away
And my wicked pain kills me
The faked torment
The infinite future
Which makes me to die
In my uncertain destiny

Falling, falling, again

I was falling again
I was growing again
I was running again
I was dying again
