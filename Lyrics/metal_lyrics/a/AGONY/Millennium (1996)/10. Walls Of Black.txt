And I had to close the shade
because the moon torments me
arising the morning and I
cut her flesh easy there
repugnant to me
she tried to kiss me
she requested to forbid the screams

now I remember her eyes
I remember her flaccid body
Her lament being deeply involved in my Head
And I only wish o make it again, I stay in silence
I look my hands and I donÃ­t know
How could I get so far whit my hate
There was the knife that blinded her life

[CHORUS]
I lit the switch because the light Seemed to
Be cold and scared me
But the fear stayed there
I lit the switch but in my heart I know
That my fucking weakness
Is waiting for me behind the gate

The cold and the fear
IÃ­m looking them in slow camera
Moving his arms whit weak power
I was defeated
I was feeling so guilty
Only that knife in my hand
Introduced it inside my neck
And only felt the void
Making my pain bleed
I die paying for my faults
