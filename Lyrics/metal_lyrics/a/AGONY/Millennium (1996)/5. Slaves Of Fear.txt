Ride in the sky and live in hell
Praise In his land and await the awake
Angel in chains and burning whit hell
Kingdom of martyrs and slaves of the beast
Hate In his life and hate when you die
Pain when you lie and pain when they pray

[CHORUS]
Which is the mane that you preach
Slaves of fear
Which is the god that they preach
Slaves of fear

This is the hell that they blasphemy
Created to hurts us, to make us die
Spheres of steel falling to the sky
From the darkness, to the future if the light

They decide who dies and who lives
There is no other way to sacrifice
Falling serenity lies to humanity
Arguments, justify
And heÃ­s here watching to the sky
He searches the answer to this misery

This is the hell that they blasphemy
Created to hurts us, to make us die
Spheres of steel falling to the sky
From the darkness, to the future if the light
They decide who dies and ho lives
There is no other way to sacrifice

[CHORUS]
