This is not my home
I'll take my chances on my own again
This is not my home
Your addictions took all they will from me.
Coming home with dishonest intentions,
insanity fueling the strength in your lies (in your eyes)

Tell me who I'm lying next to,
I would save you, do the same thing.
Tell me who I'm lying next to,
you know your words will fail.

Tell me have you forgotten that I,
Forgotten that I carry this with me,
And you do the same?
So I'll place the blame on you,
Coming home with dishonest intentions,
Insanity fueling the strength in your lies (in your eyes)

Tell me who I'm lying next to,
I would save you, do the same thing.
Tell me who I'm lying next to,
You know your words will fail.

We have been through this before,
Can't you figure it out?
You are making this so hard for us if we plan to go on.

Time and time again, words don't mean a thing.
You make this so hard for both of us. Just take a look at you, you make this so...

Tell me who I'm lying next to,
I would save you, do the same thing.
Tell me who I'm lying next to,
You know your words will fail.
