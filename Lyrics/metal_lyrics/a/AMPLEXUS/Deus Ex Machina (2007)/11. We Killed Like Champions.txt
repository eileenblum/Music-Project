Paint the acropolis
Trash your treasures
A graffiti mess rising crisis
The ground is aching to collapse
If we stay here we just will not survive
It's panic time
Be our white-winged dove
Bring back an olive branch of dry land

The World aching to collapse
Though the plan is improbably clear
And so are the people attached
The outcome's concealed
Hope is short it's part of our craft
And we stand for the hope of all those who look towards the sky

We're pensive.
"We're never going to make it there. You're insane to think again that we would"
"I'm not insane. talking makes it feel better. Gives you something more to hope for "right?"

The ground aching to collapse
Though the plan is improbably clear
And so are the people attached
 The outcome's concealed
Hope is short it's part of our craft
And we stand for the hope of all those who look towards the sky
"We've finally arrived... we just might survive"
"But though we may live our past will die with no choice.. but extinction will be their fates"

Stand up and build a world that mirrors your own
Stand up it's not your fault you must carry on

"Strive to find a way to thrive"
"We aren't alone. We are not alone"

The world is aching to collapse and with the people still attached
Our hope is short it's part of our craft
Go through the motions just to last
Sober up on failure. it's real.
Capture this moment. recover. make amends

"And now that I know it's the road we must take, it's all come so clear the war I must wage"
"Remember this day for it is yours for all time. stand and face the morn"
"Cause minutes and moments will all turn to years, and loved ones we've lost; a world of my fears"
"Remember this day for it is yours for all time. stand and face the night"
"Can't be afraid that this moment is here. been silent so long. we'll rise or we'll fall"
Remember this day it is yours for all time.

Sober up on failure. it's real.
Capture this moment. recover. make amends
