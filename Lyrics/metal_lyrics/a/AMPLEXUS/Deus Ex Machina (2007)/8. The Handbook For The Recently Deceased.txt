I swear I felt the earth move
Do we still exist?
My hands are gray and foreign
The sand beasts have a violent glare
We are just smoke and mirrors
Our substance beneath the dust in our wedding's finest
We die and they live

I swear you cast a lovely shade on my eyes
It's all in my head, we didn't survive?
We die and watch them live
For one hundred twenty-five years
We find a way to live for one hundred twenty-five years
This is so surreal

A soul dispossession and we've been evicted
The life we were building it no longer stands
We'll haunt with a vengeance.
Persist through the ages.
We just want our home back. why won't you go?

Will we be together? I think not. but hold my hand.
Gazing into the starlight we know fright
Let's watch them squirm...

Has it ever occurred to you that there are things that can never be taught?
And it's not that they're faster or stronger, they're just born with a little extra
When our time is over, we'll go hand in hand.

I swear you cast a lovely shade on my eyes
It's all in my head. we didn't survive?
We die and watch them live
For one hundred twenty-five years
We find a way to live for one hundred twenty-five years
This is so surreal

A soul dispossession and we've been evicted
The life we were building it no longer stands
We'll haunt with a vengeance.
Persist through the ages.
We just want our home back. why won't you go?

You're so beautiful as you waste away.
As we stand here with death
I will never forget
So grind the chalk against the wall
And venture down the sideways hall.

We die and watch them live
For one hundred twenty-five years
I will never forget
