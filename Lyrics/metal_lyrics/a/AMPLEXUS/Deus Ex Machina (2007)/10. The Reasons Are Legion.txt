Jerk the wheel to the side and jump the guard rail
Let's find out what it's like to truly soar
Do I take myself so seriously?
I'm just some organs with a beat

Fire like hell a barrage of questions
Impatience suits me well.
I'm in the front of the class and I'm listening close
But my hand is beating the air.
All I know is that I just want the answers.
Let them wash away the panic the anxiety of what will be.
Have we seen what beasts us men can be?

Can you see the same holes that I can see in myself?
Doesn't life seem full of thirst?
All I know is that I just want the answers.
Let them wash away the panic
The anxiety of what will be.

Coming clean. You need to know
When the siren calls. I'm inclined to go
Could I turn away if glory casts me to the road again?
We are blind to our told fortunes
Am I self aware or unaware of the cost
Of my perfectly framed dreams.
Have we seen what beasts us men can be?
Can you see the same holes that I can see in myself?
Doesn't life seem full of thirst?

Sometimes I think I'll never open up my eyes again
Light will find its way back in
Light will find its way back in.

Coming clean. you need to know
That the siren calls. I'm inclined to go
Could I turn away if glory casts me to the road again?
We are blind to our told fortunes
Am I self aware or unaware of the cost
Of my perfectly framed dreams.
Have we seen what beasts us men can be?
Can you see the same holes that I can see in myself?
Doesn't life seem full of thirst?

Light will find its way back in
