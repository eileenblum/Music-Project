I will strike down with great vengeance and furious anger.
Those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.

And you walk free blood on your hands.
The night hides you now but a red sun will rise

I know I'd find you. cower and pray.
Here is the bargain: my soul for your head
And there's no turning back

Don't turn away,
You know there's no escape.
Now I'm taking my time with you oh so carefully.
Justice fails us all
Your sentence is now
What you've done couldn't go without punishment.

The sun beating down.
This will be easier now
Strike down with no regret.
Tears mixed with beading sweat
My footsteps seem distant but sure that there is no returning.

I knew I'd find you. cower and pray.
Here is the bargain: my soul for your head

Don't turn away,
You know there's no escape.
Now I'm taking my time with you oh so carefully.
Justice fails us all
Your sentence is now
What you've done couldn't go without punishment.

And your day has come
You deserve everything you get

The innocent they call when no one's listening.
The innocent they call me

Don't turn away,
You know there's no escape.
Now I'm taking my time with you oh so carefully.
Justice fails us all
Your sentence is now
What you've done couldn't go without punishment.

Don't you run away from me
Take our time

You poison our existence and my hands are the cure.
I'm seeking retribution, this violence I deal is called for.
