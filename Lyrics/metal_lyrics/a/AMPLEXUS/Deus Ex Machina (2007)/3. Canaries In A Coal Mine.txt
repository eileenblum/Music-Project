How long will this last
Falling deeper in my invented self.
Don't feel like a real person anymore
Mannequin with their moving eyes follows me there
My consciousness is meaningless the list it never ends

Who can I trust?
Certainly not myself.
Its seems that I've misplaced the very reason why I'm here.
Untethered losing shape
Too dull to cast a doubt
The tracking button that cleared the lines is on the fritz again.

Falling deeper in my invented self.
Don't feel like a real person anymore
Mannequin with their moving eyes follows me there
My consciousness is meaningless the list it never ends

My confusion is a flood
And I am ill equipped.
Can I tread water with no help from my arms or my legs?
I'm not a liar,
but it seems every part of me is fake.
I'll take what's left of me in petals I'll bring to my friends.

Falling deeper in my invented self.
Don't feel like a real person anymore
Mannequin with their moving eyes follows me there
My consciousness is meaningless the list it never ends

I only see through the glass darkly and nothing else
And the little that I know
Can I count on that?

Falling deeper in my invented self
The death of knowledge of existence is where it ends
Take a bow
You were stunning
A footnote of our kind

But don't you think you've had enough
Of all of these lucid dreams
And I will keep this for my friends
Move on and serve a different purpose now
And I will keep this for my friends

This place has become unsafe
I'm your canary in a coal mine
It's unsafe. It's unsafe here
It's unsafe
I will warn my friends
