Right now
They say they'll cover you with culture
Right now
Until it all falls down
Right now
And then they'll bury you with nothing
Right now
Before you turn around.

Don't go I am not finished yet.
I am only half drawn.
His nerves are shot but his fingers are
Well they're as sharp as ever.

If this could end in a way that's sure to be painless.
I'll close my eyes while we tarnish the meaningful
The perfect representative to all of our aversions
All that fuss from such a little cut

Stuck in this town of phobias
He has not grace but he's all heart
I am complete and not alone
And I made this just for you

If this could end in a way that's sure to be painless
I'll close my eyes while we tarnish the meaningful
The perfect representative to all of our aversion.
All that fuss from such a little cut

You can't touch anything without destroying
You can't touch anything without destroying it
You can't touch anything at all
You can't touch anything without destroying it
You can't touch anything
Go away. You don't belong here. We're better off

All that blood from just that little cut
Has sent us sprawling backwards to Jurassic days
There is no tolerance for those with different ways
He wouldn't hurt a fly
But he'd protect the ones he loves
He would die for them and always be in the snow.
If this could end in a way that's sure to be painless
If this could be painless
