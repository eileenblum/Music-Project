If I get another chance
I'll read lots of books
That talk about humanitarian thought
Since we're speaking in theories
"Me and the devil put our cards on the table"
What we have here is a conflict of interest
If we make a move maybe we pull this off

And in the eyes of a broken man
This is the bottom we've reached it
And in the eyes of a broken man
I know this place isn't for me

"Abdicate the throne the peasants are making their move
Planning escape
Remember there's no celebration
They must fall"

"We will shed a tear for bones of those who tried and failed
It is for certain they had passion in there hearts"

He deals not in handshakes or promises
He takes what you need
We must escape

"Abdicate the throne the peasants are making their move
Planning escape
Remember there's no celebration
They must fall"

"(Remember) March in time men
(Keep Fighting) you must want redemption
(In spite of) more than ever this night
(The footsteps behind us)"

The sun has hastened the escape
Never dance with the devil in the pale moonlight
The sun is setting
Lower the white flag
Salute the sun and don't look back
(This is our only chance, when will we find the sun?
The sun is setting can we go on?)

I see through the eyes of a broken man
This is the bottom we've reached it
(March in time men. Passion in your hearts)
I see through the eyes of a broken man
This is the bottom we've reached it
(Burn down the white flag, this is our chance)

I see the sun
Through the eyes of a broken man
(It's right there. It's the sun. It's the sun.)
It's the sun
