Oh we're dying we're dying the slowest of deaths
Sad to say that this is the end and you know
Oh we're dying we're dying the slowest of deaths

So I give way
She comes with expert timing
(This is the day she lured me to)
Her sharpened shears press the life line dry.
(This is the way the strings were cut)
I'm minus protest. I've seen this day, It's all arranged
I am I am not afraid of slow death

(Oh we're dying we're dying a slow death, sad to say that this is the end my friend)
It's all arranged
So move along like we're turning the page.
That we are merely improve of blood and cells
The fact we have the gift of dreaming is incredibly presumed
It's wrongly assumed that there's no
There's no equal exchange
For us to receive something else must give way.
(So I give way)

Oh we're dying we're dying the slowest of deaths
(She comes with expert timing)
(This is the day she lured me to)
Sad to say that this is the end and you know
(Her sharpened shears press the life line dry.)
(This is the way the strings were cut)
Oh we're dying we're dying the slowest of deaths
(She comes with expert timing
Her sharpened shears press the life line dry)

So move along like we are turning the pages
Move along like we are finding the next great adventure

This is it.
How could I foresee?
It's more real than I ever dreamed
Take my hand, you're a part of this
Though you tried to place holes in my guard

So move along like we are turning the pages
This is the way the strings were cut
I am not in awe
This has all been arranged

I knew a day like this would surface
And now you confront me?
I made this right.
There's no shame
I lived for the moments that couldn't be ignored

A new strand is spun, measure and cut
A new strand is spun, measure and cut.

So move along like we are turning the pages
This is the way the strings were cut
I am not in awe
This has all been arranged
So move along like we are finding the next great adventure

I knew a day like this would surface
And now you confront me?
I made this right.
There's no shame I lived for the moments that couldn't be ignored.

Steady your heart baby this one it might hurt
Steady your heart baby this one it might hurt

This whole thing is real
This whole thing is real

We make the day, a new horizon is born.
Move along like we're having our say
We choose our fates. We make our dreams.

We choose our fates. We make our dreams.
We choose our fates. We make our dreams.

And we make this Real
