In tune, indecision.
Fear not, self omission.
For real, this condition.
Fetal, imposition.
Tonight, status vision.
Will not, self omission.
Quiet trepidation,
distraught, oversensing.
In tune, indecision.
Fear not, self omission.
For real, this condition.
Fetal, imposition.
In sight, still stuck in the way.
Dissolve into the fray.
In spite, still stuck in the way.
Put down, evolving away.
Tonight, status vision.
Will not, self omission.
Quiet trepidation,
distraught, oversensing.
In sight, still stuck in the way.
Dissolve into the fray.
In spite, still stuck in the way.
Put down, evolving away.
Void, null, alive.
Time pleads down on the brow,
palm trees bear it somehow.
Throat's dry whistle from a
flame, gnaw, thumb,
drifting once again.
Pressure beats down on the roof,
dead space thickens as we move.
Last stand founded on a mistake.
Void, null, alive, nor awake.
Void, null, alive.
