Shame, fight.
Range, find.
Fume, spite.
Grace, light.
Plans run deadly askew,
slain birds captured in you,
crooked pine whispered
the legends been told over and over.
Sunken eyes fixed on the end,
better seek shelter or bend,
pleasure fiend feasts on your will
sensing destruction for thrill.
Habit struck.
Rapid cut.
Into shallow
darken hollow.
Soft fine sever,
faint pain pleasure,
making you bleed from the rings,
raking the scales from your wings.
Shame, fight.
Range, find.
Fume, spite.
Grace, light.
Shames gone soft,
shames got the better of you.
Shame comes ripping,
the last cinders of soft tissues still living.
Sunken eyes fixed on the end,
better seek shelter or bend,
pleasure fiend feasts on your will
sensing destruction for thrill.
Habit struck.
Rapid cut.
Into shallow
darken hollow.
Soft fine sever,
faint pain pleasure,
making you bleed from the rings,
raking the scales from your wings.
