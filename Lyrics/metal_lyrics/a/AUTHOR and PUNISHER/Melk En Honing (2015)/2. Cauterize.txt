Terrorize, to feel.
Cauterize, to heal.
I'm not looking for madness.
I'm not looking for madness,
but it's found.
Sympathize, to feel.
Weeping eyes, to heal.
I'm not looking for madness.
I'm not looking for madness,
but it's found.
Teacher, there are things,
vicious things,
that I want to learn.
Some of my favorite things
are vicious things,
wouldn't you like to know?
