Strung out in the desert,
nowhere and no sound.
Best train on the planet,
cycle on rough.
Crashed plane is a respite
from political slough.
Strung out in the desert
Pulling teeth from a mountain,
a triumph of will.
Faces cut out of granite,
political swill.
Disparate, barren but fueled.
Disparate, getting high on the fumes.
Summers breeze
makes me feel, all of this is not real.
Disparate, barren but fueled.
Disparate, getting high on the fumes.
Disparate.
