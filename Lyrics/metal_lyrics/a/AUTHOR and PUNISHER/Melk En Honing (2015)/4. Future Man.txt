We've got no future plan,
locked up by the needs of man.
We've got no future plan,
transparency marks our decline.
Too little much too late,
given how far we've fallen.
It's a miracle we've come this far,
given the load we're hauling.
I'm not a future man,
fed up by our demand.
I'm not a future man,
and I'm fading under constant light.
Too little much too late,
given how far we've fallen.
It's a miracle we've come this far,
given the load we're hauling.
We've got no future plan,
locked up by the needs of man.
We've got no future plan,
transparency marks our decline.
Too little much too late,
given how far we've fallen.
It's a miracle we've come this far,
given the load we're hauling.
