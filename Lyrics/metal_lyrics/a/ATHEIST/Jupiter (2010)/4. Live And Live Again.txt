Free flight to a field of happenstance..and the air is cold
Clutch tight to the appetite for the starving
Hesitations soul.
Another flight to the bluest skies, maybe I could just electrify.
To warm up a little happenstance to light my revolution on fire!
Live, and Live Again
Grass to plant to tree
Live and Live Again
Caterpillar to wings.
I did, I am, I will Live Again
I did, I am, I will Live Again!
It's the rise, it's the high noon, it's the sunset
It's the tide, when the moonlights beaming just right.
It's the rise, it's the high noon, it's the sunset
It's the side of a mountain, with a cloud ride
Live and Live Again
Grass to plant to tree
Live and Live Again
Caterpillar to wings
I did, I am, I will Live Again!
I did I am I will Live Again!
