The process never wavers for you
The agenda is clear.
Feed on your precious, fictitious glide
Nothing's ever true for you.
Stain your kin with decisions
A thought for you to review
Can't find a frame large enough
Built to surround the 3 of you.
It's coming, moments away oh it's coming I say!
Not charming, deplorable and just alarming, I say
Maddening, on so many levels it's saddening, I say
It's coming, any day now approaching, I say.
Not for me to just disagree.
Not just something to do.
Like a mouse on a wheel I feel
I can't run far enough from you.
Do you feel when the knife cuts in
That you're somehow more alive than you've ever been?
Almost...Maybe? Maybe? Never!
Your fictitious glide is forever.
