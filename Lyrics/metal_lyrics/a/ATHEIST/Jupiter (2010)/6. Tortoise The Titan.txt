Slow, Strong and steady, that's who wins this race
The end carries little confetti, thank evolution, I love the pace,
The proportion, the sustain in the space of the now.
It's not how you die, it's how you live your life.
It's not how you try, you just do it! Suffice it to say in the space of the NOW!
Slow down!
Tortoise the Titan, Tortoise is the Titan...Slow down!!!

Hate? Pass me
Addict? Run past me.
Liar? Trust me, you won't likely finish this race!
User? Fly past me
Abuser? Run far from me! RUN!
Slow down
Tortoise the Titan, Tortoise is the Titan...Slow Down!
