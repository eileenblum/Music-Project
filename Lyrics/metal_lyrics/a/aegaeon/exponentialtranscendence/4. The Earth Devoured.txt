The earth, existence is terminated prayers are not heard,....Shaking, hands are reaching up into the blackened sky,....Minds are, lost and searching endlessly for a place to ....Torture until there is no sanity left on this mother fucking planet....Infectious- your mind is slowly turning,....Disease- is spreading everywhere....Decomposition begins to set in, ....The feast now begins with the kings devourment,....From the dark and the desolate....The most vile breed....For the fallen dreams must fall, the last images we will ever see....Your narrow mind doomed your soul, your total being....Feeding to admonish, thirsting for blood....For blood....The earth, existence is terminated prayers are not heard,....Shaking, hands are reaching up into the blackened sky,....Minds are, lost and searching endlessly for a place to ....Torture until there is no sanity left on this mother fucking planet....Nothing can stop it now....Ripped from the body....The most vile breed....
