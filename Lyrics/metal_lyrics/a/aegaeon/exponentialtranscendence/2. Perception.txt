World I am overtaken by greed,unknowingly awaits their destruction,I am the destroyer; I am their savior,We are all the same; avarice controls their minds, so easily susceptible,Destruction fuels our minds as they destroy themselves,There is no evil in this, just selection,They must fear us, for survival is at stake,As we approach another race we realize the pattern is endless,Self-destruction fuels the universe,This will change when all order has taken place,With all things obliterated a new chapter will begin,An extreme circumstance has triggered an irreversible pattern of events,A world thats overtaken by greed unknowingly awaits their destruction,I am the destroyer, I am their savior.
