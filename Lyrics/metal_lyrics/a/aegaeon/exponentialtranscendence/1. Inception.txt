A failing race desperately activating a project with unknown results, the inception of a destructive master-creature,Diseased minds of a corrupt civilization poisoned by fear,Radical measures are taken for salvation,What once were of the greatest minds, became the architects,cataclysm of an unfamiliar specimen combined with synthetic elements,This creation, is abomination,Their hunger is multiplying, and life is depleting,This is the end,complete decimation,cessation is commencing,The slate is wiped clean, a total abomination,Of every living organism...
