When they are finally dying, ....All other sentient beings are dying with them,....A burning sense of the fragility of each being,....But the realization will come too late,....They are more afraid of life than death,....But they will only reach a resolution in their minds,....Making their dying thoughts of this resolution....A new age will begin....They will all meet their destroyer, they wont meet their creator,....It is time to feed upon the living....Now its time to feed upon them ....They may call this the end, but it is only the beginning....A deep, clear, understanding for all beings will emerge, ....A new age is beginning....Exponential transcendence is near,....And now the end is here....
