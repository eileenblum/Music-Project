This is a resurrection of the ancient,
A disease, a virus, a poison,
Annihilating all things that exist,
The creator desires it to stop,
I respond by tearing apart the center of his cosmos,
A disease,
Insanity has pushed through the levels and eaten at my mind,
Annihilation is no longer an option,
This is a resurrection of the ancient,
The resurrection,
I will feast upon all thoughts,
I will feast upon all things,
This is a resurrection of the ancient,
A disease, a virus, a poison,
Annihilating all things that exist,
I am awake now,
