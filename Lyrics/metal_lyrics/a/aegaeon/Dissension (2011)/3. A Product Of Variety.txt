Cosmic calamity,
A pervasive everlasting affliction,
Discord is essential,
A product of variety, dissension,
Intrinsic in choice,
Can I transcend the paradox?
Defy the fundamental essence,
What should be left?
Simultaneous beginning and end,
Stretched and compressed to infinite past and future,
I will incur,
Boundless oblivion with complete stagnation,
Permanent nothingness composed of frozen everything,
A shapeless entity of impossibility,
Uncertain abstract phenomena,
I will incur,
Boundless oblivion,
I will incur with complete stagnation,
Cosmic calamity,
A pervasive everlasting affliction,
Discord is essential, a product of variety, dissension,
I will incur,
Simultaneous beginning and end,
Stretched and compressed to infinite past and future,
Defy me,
What will be left?
