I am ruined,
Until the moment in time arrives when I strip life to bare matter,
I do not value life; I value its destruction,
Open your eyes, see the death that is coming,
Rage has overtaken my mind,
I will descend; I will descend into the depths of reality,
And make the decision to erase the universe,
Time does not exist, the consumption of everything,
I do not value life; I value its destruction,
I can see everything,
The consumption of everything, the overtaking of nothingness.
