Inconceivable realm imprisoned in a singular paradigm,
Such a feeble understanding of the whole,
Lost in a void of consciousness unknown,
The vast totality of being,
I have stared into the depths of the abyss,
And it has stared into me,
No pity for weaker life,
No pity, no pity for weaker life,
I eclipse the dimensions of reality,
I eclipse the dimensions of reality,
Your narrow scope of conception I will erase,
I will erase,
I eclipse the dimensions of reality,
Inconceivable realm imprisoned in a singular paradigm,
Such a feeble understanding of the whole,
Lost in a void of consciousness unknown,
The vast totality of being,
I have stared into the depths of the abyss,
I eclipse the dimensions of reality,
I eclipse the dimensions of reality,
Your narrow scope of conception I will erase,
I will erase,
I have stared into the depths of the abyss,
I have stared into the depths.
