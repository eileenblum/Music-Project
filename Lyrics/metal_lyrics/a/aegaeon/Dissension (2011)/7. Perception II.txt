This is my perception,
It is you; a virus,
My mind was constructed to see this universe as poison,
An immortal machine of pure energy,
This is my perception; it is your oblivion,
This is my perception,
It is you; a virus,
Perfection and harmony will only exist with no destroyer and no creator,
This is my perception; it is your oblivion,
It is your oblivion,
My mind was constructed to see this universe as poison,
An immortal machine of pure energy,
It is you; a virus.
