Nothing is forever; nothing is what it seems,
An equilibrium must be reached,
Evolution must take place,
A morbid virus has grown; the human race is transient,
Failure after failure, transformation is god,
The singular constant, time is up,
Time is up,
Why would you want to live forever?
Millennia of misdeeds have caught up,
Death is the catalyst that breathes life into this endeavor,
Nothing is forever, impermanence,
Immortality is a hopeless endeavor,
All memory of achievement will perish,
A universal collapse I will bring,
Immortality is a hopeless endeavor,
All memory of achievement will perish,
A morbid virus has grown the human race is transient,
Failure after failure, transformation is god,
The singular constant, time is up,
Time is up,
Impermanence.
