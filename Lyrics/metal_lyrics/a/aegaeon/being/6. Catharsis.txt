For you I will crawl
Beyond the depths
Of hatred 
Beneath the gates
To the demiurge 
I am screaming in agony why am I happy
This is a look into the eyes of the evil
We are buried
We've had a look into the eyes of the evil
What of this matters
What more can we do.
I choose life
I choose life
I choose life
