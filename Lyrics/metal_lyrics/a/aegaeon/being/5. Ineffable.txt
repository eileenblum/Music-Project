It is you, it is me, it is everything,
The birth of discernment,
To know itself and all its possibilities,
Intertwining consciousness, the catalyst, the source,
Inherent and integral,
There is no self, only pure essence,
Formless unfolding,
There is no self, only pure essence,
Freed from the self,
It is after the end and before the beginning,
The birth of discernment,
To know itself and all its possibilities,
Intertwining consciousness, the catalyst,
It is you, it is me, it is everything.
