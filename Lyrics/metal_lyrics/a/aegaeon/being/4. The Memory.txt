The feeling is Calm
The light is Gone

I am well
You are well
We are Buried...
Welcome death
Wel-Come Death!

We will all be okay
If we just remember to listen
To our Fathers and their Songs
Of the End
Of the day of Man
Of the bigger world
To come...

But when it all collapses
I will cry,
"We have won!
We have won..."

I-Have-Found-The-Tree-Of-Life

We will all be okay
If we just remember to listen
To our Fathers and their Songs
Of the End
Of the day of Man
Of the bigger world
To come...

But when it all collapses
I will cry,
"We have won!
We have won..."

I will cry,
"We have won!"

I will cry,
"We have won..."
