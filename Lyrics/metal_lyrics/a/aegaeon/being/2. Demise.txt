The cry of the darkness rings loud to me,
I follow the footsteps of the great beast,
Into a cloud of uncertainty,
Welcome the thought of certain demise,
When the crown is cast,
And the throne is burned,
Only I will have returned,
As the crown is cast,
And the throne is burned,
Only I will return,
I can feel you standing close to me,
The cry of the darkness rings loud to me,
I follow the footsteps of the great beast,
Into a cloud.
