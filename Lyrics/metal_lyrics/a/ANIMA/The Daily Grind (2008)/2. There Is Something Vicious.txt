There is something vivious on my mind
And I have to surrender
I am so vulnerable
It's like a monster
Disemboweling me
I am feeling helpless
I want to tear
It out of my body
But it became
A part of my rotten life
I can not stop it
There's no happiness left
Life is a lie
It keeps coming back and tries
To finish up what's left of me
Now I found an escape in quenching
My thirst for blood
And repayment
Now I started the quest
For the reason
Of my
Sickness
Until I may
Rest in peace
I will find
And torture and kill
The beautiful people
For they are responsible
For what has happened to me
I am cursed by sick
And dead emotions
Coming from inside
