The style you walk this world
With no respect
For anyone
This is my aversion!
You are just like dregs
You do not desire
To stay alive
You're a terrible residual
I can't understand
Why people
Like your believe
They're like Rambo
You look like the people
Who live in trees
With teeth eroded by maggots
But still
You believe
To be the king
Of this village
Go home to mommy
Tell her I love you
At home you are the pussy
Sitting in the wardrobe
Crying why mommy
Doesn't love you
In the evenings
But turn back
To the wannabe Rambo
Of your small world
Show all the people
Of this fucking
Asocial planet
That you are the future
Of tomorrow
However. I will not be like
All the idiots
Who change sides
When they see you in the streets
And wet their
Expensive jeans
When you start crying in your circus
