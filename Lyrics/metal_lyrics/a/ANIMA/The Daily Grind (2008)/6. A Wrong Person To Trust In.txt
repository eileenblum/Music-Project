I have never
Seen the catastrophe
That happened
In front of my eyes
Tried to dispel the pain
I trusted you
I was so blind
Scratched out my eyes
For you
I know what you are doing
The guy you fuck with
Can't hold back my rancor now
I loved you so long
Why must it turn into hate
Excuses are senseless...
I will never close my eyes...
I will never be blind again...
One day you will lay here and bleed
An agony I had to live
The torture reflect on you
I was so blind could not see the truth
Tried to dispel
Everything you were doing
Is there no repentance you feel
