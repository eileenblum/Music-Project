Don't want to follow the grind
Pass back what they
Gave to me I don't want
To be their slave I have to break their neck
Rip of their fucking head...
Split their hearts in two
Let these maggots bleed
They don't make me their slave again!
Reigned by hate
No fate was left
Waiting for the moment
That makes this agony end
Waiting for the moment !!!
Let the revolt against the fucking breed begin
They won't take me down
Take me down once more
Try to break away from chains
That shackles your hands
And give them back the same torture
You had to survive
Grab the cutthroat that lies
On the table opposite to you
It's only one step
To let them feel the torment
This daily grind
Has to end
Now it is done
