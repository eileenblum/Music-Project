Is saw the fear in her eyes...
She lost control over here body
And mind
Why did it have to get this far?
We've spent all time together
But your ignorance
Torn us apart
I saw the fear in here eyes I relied on I vain
Your affection
Support and the fact of love
Mean the way
I am
I still love you
Even through
You're dead
Now it's now
I realize how much you mean to me
Even through
You're dead
Now it's now
You mean to me thrilled by a sense
Of guilt embossed by grief
Now is see this life
This life
Has become senseless
(preposterous me)
