His childhood was anguish field
With hate, lies
Betrayal and never ending pain
Abandoned
By his family
For he is not like them
A genetical error made
Him a monster
For everybody
To see he lived his sick life
Isolated
From society
An adult now he's searching
For the spirit of live
In women never
Really being noticed
Isolated
His love turns to hate
It's only when he can
Control and rule
Them that he's satisfied
Torture was no everyhing
But the fun in this sick game
His nature is characterized
By pain and hate
