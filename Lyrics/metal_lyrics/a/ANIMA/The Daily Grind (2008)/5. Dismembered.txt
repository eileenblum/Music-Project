The path of your like has become harder and harder
You always believed I was like
All the other stupid puppets
But now I am pulling the cards
I switched sides now your are
Locked from the inside
I will let you swallow your own shit
And make you feel
What you have spread over me
The first step of agony is raw
Pure pain
Me ripping off
Your fingernails
Flaying the skin
From your dismembered body
I know
You do not
Believe me
That is the reason you must die
Die very slow
Die in your own misery
Die alone with no fucking perspective
In your head
Full of shit
All this time of suffering
Changed my way of thinking
I feel delighted by killing
People who deserve to leave
The world of the living
Just like you
I constructed my homicides
Like killing games
So that my immolations
Will have the chance to change
Their lives
Just like me
