is there a place?
where we can find ourselves
in the way
that we want to be
a place of happiness
ecstasy and pleasure
or it's (only) our fate to die in hate

I saw last night
a shining blast in front of my eyes
but (who knows why) I didn't wanted to discover
what is hiding on the other side
(fuck, maybe it was even worse there)
