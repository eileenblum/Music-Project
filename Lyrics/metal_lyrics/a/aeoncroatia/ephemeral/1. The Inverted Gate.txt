leave me in my world
and let it breathe with me
don't touch our riches
and don't touch our gate
(outside, there's a man)
in every man's heart
there's only hate and scorn
fuck you
better die alone

my life belongs behind the inverted gate
no one can enter there
no one can touch it
it's only mine...
the gate to my world
as I want it to be
