open the ceremony gates
someone's life will end tonight
limbed, shredded
under the horns of the omnipotent

blood spills free
bleeding from all the sides
our sacrifice for thee
may satisfy thy hunger

unholy majesty
I depend on thee
hear my call give to me immortality

congest, blood overflows
rise the chalice, as he dies
in our blasphemy
