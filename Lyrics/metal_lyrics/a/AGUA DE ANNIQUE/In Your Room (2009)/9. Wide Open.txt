My arms are wide open,
I feel your presence inside.
You might be moving slow,
That's why I do not wish to hide.

I wanted you for a second, then I run,
I crave for you for a day, after that.
I love you, oh, but I didn't not know how to react.
I'll find you again, I suppose.

My eyes are wide open,
I hear your voice in my head.
You found me when I was broken
And led up the life in my heart.

However you may feel about me now,
I wish you know you have coloured my life somehow.
I love you, oh, but I didn't not know how to react.
I'll find you again I suppose.

I love you, oh, but I didn't not know how to react.
I'll find you again, I suppose.
I love you, oh, but I didn't not know how to react.
I'll find you again, I suppose.
