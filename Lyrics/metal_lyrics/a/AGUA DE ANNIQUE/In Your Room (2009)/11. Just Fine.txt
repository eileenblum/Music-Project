Hey, when the water falls just jump on
And see where you end up.
Hey, when the air spins this just jump on
And see where you belong.

One day, one day I wake up.
One day, one day I find
One way, one way or another,
I will be just fine.

Hey, when the sun rises just wake up
And see what's in your day.
Hey, when the moon seems just to rest,
Get ready for your life.

One day, one day I wake up.
One day, one day I find
One way, one way or another,
I will be just fine.

Say you will, and I will be just fine,
Say you will, and I will be OK,
Say you will, and I will be just fine.

One day, one day I wake up.
One day, one day I find
One way, one way or another,
I will be, I'll be just fine.
