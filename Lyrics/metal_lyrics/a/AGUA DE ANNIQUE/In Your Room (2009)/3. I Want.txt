I want, I want to, want to understand
What is it, what makes you think you are a man.
Is it money, money, money, money?
Is it power, power, power or just in your head?
Are the ladies, ladies. ladies, ladies
That crazy, crazy, crazy to share your bed?

All the love you had is getting away, my friend,
All the joy you shared in your life.
Make it up to me, let yourself be free.
Help me to believe, help me see.

I want, I want to, want to hold your hand
But you, you are too dumb to understand.
Then nor money, money, money, money
Nor power, power, power will save your ass.
Then no lady, lady, lady, lady
Is crazy, crazy, crazy enough to last.

All the love you had is getting away, my friend,
All the joy you shared in your life.
Make it up to me, let you set me free.
Help me to believe, help me see.
