Asleep in pearly white sheets
My shirt is dirty:
Stains of milk and longing
Colour my door lovingly.

You don't really know me.
I've watched you all morning.
Every word you're saying
This girl does not understand.

A stranger in early sunlight.
My urge is flirting.
Trails of milk and honey
Colour my floors lovingly.

You don't really know me.
I've watched you all morning.
Every word you're saying
This girl does not understand.

You don't really know me.
You read the news everyday.
I watch every morning
Not hearing all that you say.
