You give me, I need you,
I flourish, you bleed,
Not to mention heeding the voice of reality.
You whisper, my heart beats,
That's bitter, that's sweet,
But your service is ending:
The minute you walk the street.

It's physical, irresistible, wonderful,
It's logical, you're so marvellous, but
Don't shut me out.
It's physical, irresistible, wonderful,
It's logical, you're so marvellous, but
Don't shut me out,
Don't show me out of your heart.

You smile and I see
It's professional indeed.
Just the one last time and I will be on my way.
You give me, I need you,
I flourish, you feel good,
No reason to end this now.

It's physical, irresistible, wonderful,
It's logical, you're so marvellous, but
Don't shut me out.
It's physical, irresistible, wonderful,
It's logical, you're so marvellous, but
Don't shut me out.

It's physical, irresistible, wonderful,
It's logical, you're so marvellous, but
Don't shut me out.
It's physical, irresistible, wonderful,
It's logical, you're so marvellous, but
Don't shut me out,
Don't show me out of your heart.
