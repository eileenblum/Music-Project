Your eyes, your shoes, it's hard to choose,
But the best thing about you is the way that you move.
Side by side all through the night,
And the thing we dream the most is to see the morning light.

Hey, okay, why don't you stay another day?
And if it feels allright will you stay another night?
Hey, allright, why don't you stay another night?
And if it feels okay will you stay another day?

Your place or mine, whatever, it's fine
Let's dance, let's sway the night away.
No fear, no shame, we play this game,
And the best thing about it is I don't even know your name.

Hey, okay, why don't you stay another day?
And if it feels allright will you stay another night?
Hey, allright, why don't you stay another night?
And if it feels okay will you stay another day?

Hey, okay, why don't you stay another day?
And if it feels allright will you stay another night?
Hey, allright, why don't you stay another night?
And if it feels okay will you stay another day?

Hey, okay, why don't you stay another day?
And if it feels allright will you stay another night?
Hey, allright, why don't you stay another night?
And if it feels okay will you stay another day?
