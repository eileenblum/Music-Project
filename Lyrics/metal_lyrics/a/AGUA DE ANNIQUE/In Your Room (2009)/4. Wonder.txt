Drove on by your house today,
I know it's hard to stay away.
It's allright, you pick a fight,
But my heart is on the tray.

Whatever you may think of me
You know that there'll never be
Someone who loves you more than I do.
One day you will understand
You had me in the palm of your hand,
And I will be gone, I leave you to wonder.

I took a breath, looked at your door,
The times that I've been here before.
Your smiling face, your warm embrace,
Those days are not here anymore.

Whatever you may think of me
You know that there'll never be
Someone who loves you more than I do.
One day you will understand
You had me in the palm of your hand,
And I will be gone, I leave you to wonder.

Drove on by, I don't know why
It's so hard to stay away.
I kiss goodbye, a teary eye,
It's another lonely day.
