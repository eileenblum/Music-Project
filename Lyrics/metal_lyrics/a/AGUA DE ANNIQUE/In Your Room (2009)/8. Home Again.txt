Living, learning but I wish you well
Hoping, waiting though I would like to tell you

The stormy day is here today
To guide me back home
The stormy day a cloud away
To guide me back home

Home again
Home again
Home again

Very clearly but you know it's me
Patience, courage though I'm the one to leave you

The stormy day is here today
To guide me back home
The stormy day a cloud away
To guide me back home

Home again
Home again
Home again
