I sit here in my aeroplane seat.
There's only one pause left that allows me to sleep.
I don't know why, but I think I'm allright
Taking off now to fly through the night.

But even so my eyes are wide open:
I cannot shape the way you make me feel.

The longest day
Was when I was away from you.
The longest day
Was when I was away from you.

The aeroplane is entirely to blame
That the gap between us is insane.

I am staring at the lady in the yard.
I will sit here and remember us for a while:
What it was like with you and how you turned me on,
But now it's time for me to take those memories back home.

The longest day
Was when I was away from you.
The longest day
Was when I walked away from you.

How can I resist another day
Not to be with you, my love, to help me on my way?

I sit here in my aeroplane seat.
There's only one pause left that allows me to sleep.
