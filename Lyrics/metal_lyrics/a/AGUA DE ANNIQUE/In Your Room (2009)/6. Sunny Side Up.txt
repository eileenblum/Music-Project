Miranda takes her eggs sunny side up in the morning.
It's quiet while she eats,
But not for long before she starts talking.
She loves her music
And she prays for a nice day while she's walking.
She moves her eyes up to the sky
And calls out, "Have a nice day".

All the love she knows she learnt from you, you were the wisest.
All the love she knows she learnt from you, you were the wisest.

I don't know her all too well,
But I can tell she's a believer,
Passion sparks her eyes,
She's the sunny side of her own life.
Miranda, plays her songs for us to hear in the evening.
Late night she's alright,
She must be Jesus' little helper.

All the love she knows she learnt from you, you were the wisest.
All the love she knows she learnt from you, you were the wisest.

Miranda takes her eggs sunny side up in the morning.
