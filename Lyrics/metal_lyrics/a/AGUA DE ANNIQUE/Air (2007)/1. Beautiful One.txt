Beautiful One
Your hair shines in the sun
I wish I'd never left

The wind intwines our hair
Our words get swept through the air
I wish I never left

Your face shines in my eyes
Our last look before our goodbye
I wish I never left

Beautiful One
You shine like the sun
I wish I never left
Before I have said
You are the one
You are the one

Your sun will come and go
But its beauty will keep its glow
I wish your rays would shine over me
Keep filling me with your beauty
I wish I never left
I wish I never left
