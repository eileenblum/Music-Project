Oh, you are nice
Paradise
I say it only twice
Man, you are nice
Your skin soft like veil
Warm but pale

Oh, you are great
Fascinating
I'll blow you out of my mind
Damn, you are fine
Your skin soft like veil
Warm but pale
Oh, you are sweet
Sweep me off my feet

Oh, you are nice
Para-holy-dise
I'll say it only twice
Man, you are nice

Your skin soft like veil
Warm but pale
Oh, you are sweet
Sweep me off my feet
