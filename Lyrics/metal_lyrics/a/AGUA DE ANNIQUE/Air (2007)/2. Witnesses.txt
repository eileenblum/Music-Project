No change no pleasure no jokes no sex
No choice no morals no ethics no depth
No colour no fight no freedom no life
Profound creation, temptation is swept

I hear knocking on my door

I wonder how it's possible
That I just sit here in my room
Watching some TV
Thinking of nothing and nothing
And I don't know how
Does anybody have the nerve
To come to my door
And sell the world of God

I wonder what's the remedy
And I can move on with my life
Before you people are through
With the extinction of the universe

You save the world from me
I wonder who will be left over...
