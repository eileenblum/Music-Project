Today is the day after yesterday
And yesterday didn't go so well
My love came down and assured me:
Sit down I have something to tell

[Chorus:]
When I met you my eyes hurt
That is how beautiful you are
I don't suppose I could feel this way
If I'd still have you by my side
By my side

I did not anticipate your candour
Even though I didn't know you too well

They say one door closed is another door open
But this door is leading me straight to hell

[Chorus]

I'm just broken up
I'm caving in
That is how tired I am

I don't suppose I could feel this way
