My friend, she's gone away
And left us here to stay
And I understand
I do

We write and think of her
About whatever may occur
We ask the clouds in the sky
We do

When you were here you didn't feed us
When you passed over it hit us
You are the one who knew
The only hidden truth

We write and think of her
About whatever may occur
We ask the clouds in the sky
We do

When you were here you didn't feed us
When you passed over it hit us
You are the one who knew
The only hidden truth

Thirty-four and I am only beginning to understand
What this is all about
Do you think you will be able to forgive me?
Do you?
