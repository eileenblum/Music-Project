I can't go home
I cannot sleep
I cannot give
I cannot keep

This heart of stone has left me here
With only rumors of your left
I guess to see you leaving was for the best

I dream too much
and spend my days
Like a sailor lost at sea
And you were like a mermaid
in that Danish fairytale
I guess the best thing that I could do
is to sail

Away from this sunken soldiers ball
Away, do you remember me at all?
I have no better words than "Thank you and goodbye"
I wish I didn't have to see our love die

At last I'm home
My horse will rest
This tattoed heart
This trembling chest must be alone
And carry this sorrow back to bed
I hope there was no innocent blood shed

Away from this sunken soldiers ball
Away, do you remember me at all?
I have no better words than "Thank you and goodbye"
I wish I didn't have to see our love die
