I shield you from this life
Your heart is kept on ice
I file you where I need
And keep you from the heat

Running, running away

You hold me in contempt
Forever will I depend
You file me where you need
But never kept me from the heat

Falling, falling away
(I'll serve you, I'll serve you well)
On the surface, on the surface

It's always cold in hell
I have felt it
I can tell

They file you where they need
In ice water there is no heat

Burning, burning away
(I'll serve you, I'll serve you well)
On the surface, on the surface

Burning, burning away
Burning, burning away
