My hands are tied
I'm on your side
You are my girl
I hold your hand and understand
You are my girl, my girl

[Chorus:]
She has to learn
To walk on artificial grass
And they have to earn her love

Your big embrace
Has kept me in this place, my girl

And when we change
We did not lose our faces, my girl

[Chorus]

Now all is said and done, my friend
We're growing up

And now that we are
What we have become
I still don't know, sometimes

[Chorus]
