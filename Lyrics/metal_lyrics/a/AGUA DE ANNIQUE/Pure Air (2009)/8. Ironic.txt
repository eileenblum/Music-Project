An old man turned 98
Won the lottery and died the next day
It's a black fly in your Chardonnay
It's a death row pardon two minutes too late

And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's a good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought
It figures

Mr. Play-It-Safe was afraid to fly
He packed his suitcase and kissed his kids goodbye
He waited his whole damn life to take that flight
And as the plane crashed down, he thought:
"Well isn't this nice?"

And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's a good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought
It figures

Life has a funny way
Of sneaking up on you when you think
Everything's okay and everything's going right

And life has a funny way
Of helping you out when you think
Everything's gone wrong and everything blows up in your face

It's a traffic jam when you're already late
A no smoking sign on your cigarette break
It's like ten thousand spoons when all you need is a knife
It's like meeting the man of my dreams
And then...meeting his beautiful wife

And isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?
A little too ironic
Ooh yeah, I really do think

It's like rain on your wedding day
It's a free ride when you've already paid
It's a good advice that you just didn't take
And who would've thought
It figures

Life has a funny way
Of sneaking up on you
And life has a funny, funny way
Of helping you out
Helping you out
