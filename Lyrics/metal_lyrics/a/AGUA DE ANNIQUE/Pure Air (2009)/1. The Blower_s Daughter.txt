And so it is
Just like you said it would be
Life goes easy on me
Most of the time

And so it is
The shorter story
No love, no glory
No hero in her sky

Can't take my eyes off of you [x5]
Can't take my eyes...

And so it is
Just like you said it should be
We'll both forget the breeze
Most of the time

And so it is
The colder water
The Blower's daughter
The pupil in denial

Can't take my eyes off of you [x5]
Can't take my eyes...

Did I say that I love you
Did I say that I want to
Leave it all behind

I can't take my mind off of you [x5]
I can't take my mind...
