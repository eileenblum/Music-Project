The road to Hell is paved with gold
From where I stand it's clear
The story of my life unfolds
And all I haven't left is here

My mask concealed no treachery
Your heart was on your sleep
I removed your veil of innocence
With no intention to deceive

Our trust was built on promises
And all that I held dear
You are the one who stole my heart
When it was yours for free

And then your life was torn apart
And it was plain to see
How far I've fallen cutting deep
Beyond belief
And now I give it all
To catch a thief...

Your character was plain to see
I stumbled and I fell
Your silver words spelled tragedy
Although you seemed to wish me well

And what I gave so easily
Someday you will repay
You are the one who stole my heart
When it was yours for free

And then your life was torn apart
And it was plain to see
How far I've fallen cutting deep
Beyond belief
And now I give it all

You took away my will to live
I took all that you had to give
Now I have nothing
I have nothing to lose
But the pain and misery of losing you
And I really cannot see me pulling through

My story ends but here I see
Your debt is overdue
I need no mercy,take my life
'Cause now my heart belongs
To you...

We can rebuild our lives again
And our reward is here
You are the one who holds my heart
I gave it willingly
You turned my whole life inside out
And now it's plain to see
I had to fall in love so deep
Beyond belief
And yes,I have it all...
You are the one who holds my heart
I gave it willingly
You turned my whole life inside out
And now it's plain to see
I had to fall in love so deep
Beyond belief
And yes,I have it all...
To catch a thief...
