Hiding from the blue in your eyes
I never told you that I don't need a reason to be
In love with the smile on your face
Guess I just want you around
To get my feet on the ground

And I say
Why can't you tell me
What is the reason
Tell me what is on your mind
I try
Not to be uptight
But I need to know now
Tell me what is on your mind

Is it something we've got to know
Or should we do it over again
Do you need some more time to
Learn how to love and in time
If only you gave me a sign
Then I know I'd be fine

And I say
Why can't you tell me
What is the reason
Tell me what is on your mind
I try
Not to be uptight
But I need to know now
Tell me what is on your mind

Don't be afraid
It's never too late
I can't bear to see you hesitate
It's a matter of time before you'll be mine
But until that day I won't cross the line

Then life will be so much better
For you and me
Just let us be

And I say
Why can't you tell me
What is the reason
Tell me what is on your mind
I try
Not to be uptight
But I need to know now
Tell me what is on your mind
