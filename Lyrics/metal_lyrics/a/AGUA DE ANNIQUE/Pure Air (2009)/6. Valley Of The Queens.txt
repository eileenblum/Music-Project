My journey's over
I'm standing on the edge
And close my eyes
To this world of lies

My will is broken
It's the end of all my dreams
My soul yearns
For the Valley of the Queens

My rose has withered
It will never bloom again
The soil is dry
Time has come to die

My faith has left me
They have stolen all my dreams
Oh lay me down
In the Valley of the Queens

My search has ended
My name is carved in stone
On the temple wall
Beyond Osiris hall

No holy sunrays
Will light my tomb of dreams
I won't return
From the Valley of the Queens
