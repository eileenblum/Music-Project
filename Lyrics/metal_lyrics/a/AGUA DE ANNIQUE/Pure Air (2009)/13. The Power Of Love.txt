Dreams are like angels
They keep bad at bay

Love is the light
Scaring darkness away

I'm so in love with you
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

The power of love
A force from above
Cleaning my soul
Flame on burn desire
Love with tongues of fire
Purge the soul
Make love your goal

I'll protect you from the Hooded Claw
Keep the vampires from your door
When the chips are down I'll be around
With my undying, death-defying love for you

Envy will hurt itself
Let yourself be beautiful
Sparkling like flowers and pearls and pretty girls
Love is like an energy
Rushing inside of me

This time we go sublime
Lovers entwine divine
Love is danger, love is pleasure
Love is pure the only treasure

I'm so in love with you, purge the soul
Make love your goal
