I hear knocking on my door
I wonder how it's possible
That I can sit here in my room
Watching some TV
Thinking of nothing and nothing
And I don't know how
Does anybody have the nerve
To come to my door
And sell the world of God

You save the world from me
You save the world from me
I wonder who will be left over...

You save the world from me
You save the world from me
I wonder who will be left over...
