Like wild flowers
Left alone
By the side of the road
Imperfect on the edge

Like wild flowers
Left alone
By the side of the road
Imperfect on the edge

They stand in the wind and the rain
Not a fear left in the world
They've learned that this life
Is unpredictable

Like wild flowers
Left alone
By the side of the road
Imperfect on the edge

Like wild flowers
Left alone
By the side of the road
Imperfect on the edge

Far away
Where the moon falls into the sea

Like wild flowers
Left alone
By the side of the road
Imperfect on the edge

Without knowing anything for certain
This may be the last day
So everything has more meaning
And so much more color this way

Far away
Where the moon falls into the sea

Like wild flowers
Left alone
By the side of the road
Imperfect on the edge

Like wild flowers
Left alone
By the side of the road
Imperfect on the edge
