'Chantress, she who within the magic of the ivory can act as a siren to
the angels. You hold within your very eyes an eclipse and with you also
comes a sun, whose arcane light can destroy all in it's path.'

'It is not really so I have told myself, but to a man whose own reflection
is threatening, such rational words fall forever on deaf ears. And yes,
you hold Eden and your golden aura that I have held in my hands will take
me to other worlds where the fruits of Eden are life itself.'

And as love itself seeks our nectar, to read your next chapter
is all I have wished for, but a blank page will enlighten no man.
