And love itself sought our nectar, and time itself stood still...no man
before had tasted the fruits of such immortality and when your hands
touched my face time itself kissed my soul. And our souls fell, as angels
had wings, we had grace below us. We became no man, no love would escape
our sun and where once an arcane cage gripped me, my soul, now I could
swim free in the oceans of time.

I too have embraced a new day as a new life only to find that complacency
can lead to life creeping behind and closing my eyes to a world that
wished to embrace me and kiss my very soul.
