In the breast of the sky, I saw them gathered in flight, casting down
their enveloping aura, as leaves would fall, it touched my every pore. The
kindest words of echonian tongue no longer fell on deaf ears and I could
feel their joy as it carried me into the clouds. And for six days and six
nights, I was as they were... I too spoke in echonian tongue and sang the
songs of Byzantium. As Midas had with touch, I was granted with a vision,
as a gold world embraced me and kissed my soul. I was alive then.
