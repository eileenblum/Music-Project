Change my life, seize me. Change me, chain me
Change my life, please me. Change me, chain me

A lonely beach in the distance far
The building sites, the city lights
Seeking her Atlantis
Beneath a windy town

Lost in her fantasies
Drowning in her dream
The waves so wild
Pounding patterns into white
Modern times descended
The dream is taking flight

Running from the beach, suspended are the lights
"What'll I find," she says, "In the ropes, death or life"?
Returning to the folds, like her mother's dress
She heads for the structure, for eventual re-birth

Change my life, seize me. Change me, chain me
Change my life, please me. Change me, chain me

The water's black and the moon drifts by
Orchestral nights perform their rites
Sinking in Atlantis
They dance on their way down

A figure slowly exiting from this crazy scene
And Neptune smiles with his trident come to life
He summons me to the sea
To be his liquid wife

Standing on a bridge, I can see for miles
"Change my life," she says
A cab drives by and she smiles
Spinning round in the city light, she got up without a word
Turned around and disappeared into the night

Change my life, seize me. Change me, chain me
Change my life, please me. Change me, chain me
