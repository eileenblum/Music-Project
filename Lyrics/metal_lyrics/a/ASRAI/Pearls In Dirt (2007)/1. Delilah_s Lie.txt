Buried her head in her hands
(Delilah, you liar)
Buried the sun with the mysteries within
(She craves the sin)
She played her perfection
The lie was waiting to be
The words left unspoken
Now you will seeâ¦

Her lips are sealed
And dead in a kiss
The promises, she made and touched her lips

Sleep through the fear, through the din
(Go to sleep my little one)
Blood on my lips from the dagger that I kissed
(Kiss the pain away)
Now death I have tasted
Though I had sensed your treason
Your virtues lay wasted
So it will beâ¦

Her lips are sealed
And dead in a kiss
The promises, she made and touched her lips
Burn in her fire with your passion within
Go to sleep my little sin
