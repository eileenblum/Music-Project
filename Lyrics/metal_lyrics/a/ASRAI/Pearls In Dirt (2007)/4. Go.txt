A craving is calling me
Desire in all its splendor
Pulsating, rushing sounds
Getting louder and louder

Go, go
Show you the secret me
Flaunting my desire
Moral virtues are beneath me
Oblivious to pain

Go, go  To the underground
Hey, hey Let's die forever
No, no No limits here
Open up, you know you want to
Let's go

Feed me with your last breath
Embrace your destination
Take me as far as you dare
I'm on the edge so....

Go, go To the underground
Hey, hey Let's die forever
No, no No limits here
Open up, you know you want to
Let's go

Feel the force out of control
Shattered dreams are taking over
Fears have lost their lustre now
Excel in all my senses
Give it up . Give it

Go, go To the underground
Hey, hey Let's die forever
No, no No limits here
Open up, you know you want to
Let's go
