Shelter for a frightened girl
Who lost so many years
Lost track of all the tears
Shelter in a bitter world
Protect her from her fears
She needs shelter now
Give her shelter

Never was she scared before
Death tempted her away
Gave meaning to her days
Never did she dare explore
The feeling held at bay
And she never will
No, never

Forever we severed
The ties that bind together
Keeping us alive
We're losing, refusing
The cry that keeps us choosing
Was she hearing mine?
Did she take the time?

Wander through your fate alone
Where madness rules the weak
Too painful there to speak
Wonder why the love has gone
Your loss is not unique
So you wander lost
And you wander

Forever we severed
The ties that bind together
Keeping us alive
We're losing, refusing
The cry that keeps us choosing
Was she hearing mine?

Lost inside this memory
Break under the weight
Will my fate be doomed
To make the same mistakes?
