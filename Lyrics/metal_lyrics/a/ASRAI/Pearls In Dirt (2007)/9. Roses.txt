She puts on her makeup
And roses in her hair
She smiles to the face in front of her
And tries to be sincere
Tomorrow seems so far away
When the moon shines silver light
Shines her silver light
That blazes through the night

Never to last. Never would there be
Another question to ask
Forgotten in a dying flame

She opens her heart up
In hope of better times
A sliver of a trust betrayed
Of old, forgotten rhymes
Her eyes, they cast their twisted spells
And thorns tear through her dreams
Petals falling hopelessly
With nothings as it seems

Never to last. Never would there be
Another question to ask
Forgotten in a dying flame

Questions never been asked
In the silence of the night
And even when she tries to talk
I forget, I forget myself

Escape in lonely stories
Too sad for her to tell
No one there to comfort her
She sighs, "It's just as wellâ¦"

Never to last. Never would there be
Another question to ask
Forgotten in a dying flame
Never meant to last
Never would there be
Another question to ask
Forgotten in a dying flame
