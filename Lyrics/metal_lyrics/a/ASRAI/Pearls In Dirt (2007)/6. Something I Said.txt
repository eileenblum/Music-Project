Don't close the door
It's cold outside
Nothing is the same anymore

It's all changing  It's cold outside

Don't close the door
I feel one with the cold outside
And now nothing seems the same anymore

It's all changing
And I've absolutely no control
So tell me now

Is it something I said, is it something I did?
Is it something in between you and me?
Just you and me

My words turn into accusations
Yours into excuses
The distance creeps between you and me
So why don't you just go on and tell me now

Is it something I said, is it something I did?
Is it something in between you and me?
Oh, just tell me now
Is it something I said, is it something I did?
Is it something in between you and me?
Just you and me

No matter what I say here, I'll still be losing
No matter what I do, I am lost anyway
What're you saying? Just tell me now

Is it something I said, is it something I did?
Is it something in between you and me?
Oh, just tell me now
Is it something I said, is it something I did?
Is it something in between you and me?
Just you and me

Is it something I said, is it something I did?
Is it something in between you and me?
Oh, just tell me now
Is it something I said, is it something I did?
Is it something in between you and me?
Just you and me

And it cuts me like a knife
A different story, waiting for your lies
Is it something I said?
Is it something to regret?
So tell me nowâ¦
