Wake up little girl
We're running out of time
I know that you've been running
On a long, lost line
They cut your tongue in pieces
Denied you any rights

All your trails so many years
Still hunting for the things unknown to man

Just let her sleep. On a bed of white roses
Seems peaceful to me. Thorns pierce her skin
As I kiss her goodnight. I kiss her goodbye
