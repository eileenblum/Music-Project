She wrote her name in sand
And lived a lie within
The sadness and sorrow
For the loss that came again
Water washed the tears away
But the emptiness stayed
Tamed itself with outrage
And spit the bitterness away

This water won't feed the earth
Nothing grows on sour ground

She cannot calm the screams
To silence in her head
Staring with her empty eyes
Try to feel what she had
She wrote her name in sand
And loved a lie within
Where beauty can be cruel
And beauty takes it all

This water won't feed the earth
Nothing grows on sour ground

I will swim with you
And play amongst the waves
Where mermaids will be singing
Where the sweet song remains
Like a comfort whisper
To be together again
She wrote her name in sand
And believed her lie within

This water won't feed the earth
Nothing grows on sour ground
This water won't feed the earth
Nothing grows on sour ground
