Where will I stand
When there's nothing left to say?
Stay with me
What will you choose
When there's nothing left to lose?
Time stands still

Hide behind the walls
Where a house is not a home
Stay with me
I can't break through
When there's nothing to be told
Stay with me

Stay with me
When there's nothing left
Stay with me

How can I breathe
When the sky has turned to grey?
It fades away
I don't understand
Does it always feel so cold?
Breathe with me

Do the nightmares find your head
Staring to the face behind?
Time is all we have
When the sky has turned to grey
Stay with me

Stay with me
When there's nothing left to say
Please stay
