Forget my past in your game
This is just a bruise
This is just the mirror meant to show the truth
Dusty eyes set free to rise, changing over soon
Dusty eyes to see now the changes in you

Your hand's so coldâ¦ forgive me
Your hand's so coldâ¦ forgive me

I can't breathe this poison
It strangles little girls
The marks of pain remaining
Upon her face a pearl
A trail for all, a sinner's ball
Stare with hungry eyes
A trail for all the sinners
Staring as you rise

Your hand's so coldâ¦ forgive me
Your hand's so coldâ¦ forgive me
All that's left until the end
All that's left, our time be damned
Your hand's so cold

Oh, forgive me

This is the mirror
It reflects what is real
Sinners stare as you rise
And they kill with their eyes
This is the end
Our time may be damned
As you trip, as you change
As you slip out of range

This is the mirror
It reflects what is real
Sinners stare as you rise
And they kill with their eyes
This is the end
Our time will be damned
As you trip, as you change
As you slip

Your hand's so coldâ¦ forgive me
Your hand's so coldâ¦ forgive me
All that's left until the end
All that's left, our time be damned
Your hand's so cold
