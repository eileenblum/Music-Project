I walk through the garden
Touching rain like sparkling diamonds
Walking next to you
In the garden of innocence

Standing alone in the circle of insanity
The voices circle in your head
The next step leads you to the darkness
Oh please let me forget

Once there was a child in the garden
Her innocence so pure
Her ominous fragile soul
They are mine to keep

Standing alone in the circle of insanity
The voices circle in your head
The next step leads you to the darkness
Oh please let me forget

Protect your body against insanity
You will think it will not come
But before you know, you'll wish it wasn't me

Protect your body against insanity
You will think it will not come
But before you know, you'll wish it wasn't me
They circle in your head

The shadows are hiding
