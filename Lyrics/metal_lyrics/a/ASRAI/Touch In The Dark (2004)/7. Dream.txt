Dream the dream
You always do
Catch me if I fall
I've lost the old game
We'd played before

Catch me if I fall
I'm losing hold
I've lost the old game
We'd played before

I close my eyes
And try to remember the panic in yours

Strange what time can do
It gives and takes our precious memories
Melting with all my senses
Melting here with you

Catch me if I fall
I'm losing hold
I've lost the old game
We'd played before
I try tou touch the moon
But I fall back
Reality kills

The dream has just begun
You'll always be apart
Of a whisper on the wind
Melting with all my senses
Melting here with you

Catch me if I fall
I'm losing hold
I've lost the old game
We'd played before
Reproach the scarves
We'd kept a secret
For all those years
