Like a long day in life
Never so strong is the mercy inside
I feel my eyes turn to the skies
Sliding slowly, melting in your eyes

You cover up the cruelty
They built so carefully for all thoseyears
You cover up the cruelty
They built so carefully for all those years
Spit on Mother Nature
When you yearn and cry out her name
And cry out her name

Cry little child our bodies
Drown our sorrow tomorrow
How painful it is to watch you vanish
Don't say you're sorry cause you can't
Fill this hole

You cover up the cruelty
They built so carefully for all thoseyears
You cover up the cruelty
They built so carefully for all those years
Spit on Mother Nature
When you yearn and cry out her name
And cry out her name

How lonely is the darkness of the night
Say goodbye to a lost friend
Desperatly seeking to remain
Fall into girief that finally turns to silence
When silence turns into madness
An endless rage against all odds
Spit on Mother Nature
When you yearn and cry out her name
And cry out her name

The sour taste of sorrow
