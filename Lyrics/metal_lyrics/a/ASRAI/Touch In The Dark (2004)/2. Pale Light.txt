A pale light enters my room
A skinny wrist
A clammy hand on white sheets
Side with fear
I can't move
I'm in agony

Only my eyes lived
And showed the sadness of a loss
A small world surrounded me
There's nothing more
Nothing more left

Exhausted by wandering
Through the cruel days
Awakening sadness
As I recall

Outside, this changing time provokes me
My big desire, I can't hear this choking love
And I can't hold our memories

Exhausted by wandering
Through the cruel days
Awakening sadness
As I recall

The sun closes
her eyes for the night
Strange shadows rise
at my wall
They are trying
to catch my light
And dance together
into this dark night

Exhausted by wandering
Through the cruel days
Awakening sadness
As I recall
