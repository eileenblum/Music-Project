I'm feeling restless tonight
Is it a dream or our goodbye?
The snake bites my spine
I'm between the devil and the deep awakening

Your hand on my mouth
I choke in the words
And nothing comes out
I'm too deep
Still too connected
The warmth unprotected
I'm in too deep

I know what I'm feeling but I can't stop thinking
The poison of a jealous mind
I'd rather live the lie than be lost in the truth
At least you had a choice, but you took
You took mine, too

I see the fear in your eyes
I want to get closer
I see the fear in your eyes

I can't reach you
I can't reach you

Every touch feels different
Every word I can't believe
Every touch feels different
We're both locked up in our grief

Please don't ask me how I feel
You don't want to hear
The doubt I'm already in

Your hand on my mouth
I choke in the words
And nothing comes out
I'm too deep
Still too connected
The warmth unprotected
I'm in too deep

I'm in too deep
