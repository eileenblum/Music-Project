In front of me, just for a while to ever see
A reaching voice beyond my mind
Your words go down my spine
All my questions are asking why

We died tonight
Enclosed in the dark
Wandering ourselves
And tried to hide our lies again
Walking on wind as I recall the last time

I don't mind you asking question
For all and more, it's yours to know
In my dream I bleed for you
Obliviated in your reasons to be
The one to hurt and feel my lies
The one to hurt and feel my lies

Your face still colours my mind
Reality turned into the inside
Walking on the wind
As I recalled the last time

I don't mind you asking question
For all and more, it's yours to know
In my dream I bleed for you
Obliviated in your reasons to be
The one to hurt and feel my lies
The one to hurt and feel my lies

Cry out my words

I bleed for you
