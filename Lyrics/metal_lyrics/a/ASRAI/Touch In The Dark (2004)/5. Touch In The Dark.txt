See the reach of a child in you
From a touch in the dark
Among the shades of blue
From a touch in the dark

A hand, a name, a queen in truth
A balanced word in a new song
No sound from this place belongs
Among the shades of blue

See the reach of a child in you
From a touch in the dark
Among the shades of blue
From a touch in the dark

And through the fields of flow
And meaningless sentence
From a touch in the dark

For all waht happened since
In these mianingless ways

A hand, a name, a queen in truth
A balanced word in a new song
No sound from this place belongs
Among the shades of blue

A touch in the dark

A hand, a name, a queen in truth
A balanced word in a new song
No sound from this place belongs
Among the shades of blue

A touch in the dark
