She came into your life
Like a shadow of a doubt
She wants to explore the
Shadow of your doubt

The shadows fall
And the silence returns
You feel the forest breath
And she gives the breath of life

As she falls into your arms
As she falls
She's falling into your dreams tonight

She stands before me
Her white dress on the ground
I tasted my wanting
As she wounded my soul

As she falls into your arms
As she falls she's falling
Your dreams tonight

As she falls, she falls
