She has met the stranger inside
Looking in the mirror
She saw the face behind
And how can she forgen
When it's staring in her face
She can't remember where it went wrong

Staring in the mirror
It's the face on the wall
Screaming for these questions
But she already knew it all

The silence marks the time
What's happening?
Don't know
And walked away
And walked away

A silence for the storm
I lost your face in the crowd
I thought that's what you wanted
But the fear keeps me screaming

She apologised for her abuse
She believes her body is only for use
Locked up in a tower
Broken glass inside
She's pressing her lips on the wall
She screams out

But no one wants to hear
But no one wants to hear

She's a stranger to herself
She's a stranger to herself
