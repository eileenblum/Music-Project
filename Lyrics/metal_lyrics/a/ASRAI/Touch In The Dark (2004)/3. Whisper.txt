It doesn't matter
How hard I try
Nothing that is has changed
After this long, long time

When the angel closed her eyes
She spread her wings
She tried to comfort you
As she spreads her wings
The truth will find it's way
And all your twisted lies
Beat up against the wind
As The Angel closed her eyes

I hope you feel the same
The force is for us all
Give you all the trust
Close your eyes
And let it go

So lift me up
And fly upon a dream
You've recognised it all
But it's not what it seems
The truth will find it's way
And all your twisted lies
Beat up against the wind
As The Angel closed her eyes

I'm whispering your words
To close this chapter's end
I'm frozen inside
And lost in your different worlds

When the angel closed her eyes
She spread her wings
She tried to comfort you
As she spreads her wings
The truth will find it's way
And all your twisted lies
Beat up against the wind
As The Angel closed her eyes

So lift me up
And fly upon a dream
You've recognised it all
But it's not what it seems
The truth will find it's way
And all your twisted lies
Beat up against the wind
As The Angel closed her eyes
