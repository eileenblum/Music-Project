Free your mind and stop living in your head
Because you're only making sense for someone else
And I know this life is too far to grasp
Don't listen to the voice that says you can't

I seek to know and I seek to understand
A depth to life beyond what I can comprehend
There's more to life than what we've come to know
And so I'm drawn to the unknown

I can show you with the distant, foreign coasts
It's such a bitter feeling to have once known

When the water turns to sand, and the sand to concrete
And the concrete dissipates from beneath your feet
Left to drift and grow indifferent
It was never my dream to just belong

Deep in love or deep in hate

Another day, another way to escape
I'm faced with the choice of fade or stay

I'd rather cut the rope and not be shown
To live on this ground, but rather swim alone
In chase of direction and pursuit of truth

Another day, another way to escape
And either deeper in love or deeper in hate,

I can show you with the distant, foreign coasts
It's such a bitter feeling to have once known

I can show you with the distant, foreign coasts
It's such a bitter feeling to have once known

A skyline unfolds in the red distant sea
It speaks to my suppressed beliefs
For there's nowhere out and nowhere to be
And nothing remains beyond our false reliefs

Free your mind

It is time for you to free your mind
It is time for you to free your mind
