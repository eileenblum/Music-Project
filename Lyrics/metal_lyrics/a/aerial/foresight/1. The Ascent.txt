My feet feel so rooted to the ground
I for one stumble in the dark blue dawn
I need to take another step forward
You'll understand exactly how I feel
And whilst I taste the scent of death on my lips
I chose to live

A dream I need to indulge in
Within my sea of beliefs

I'm used to let my mind wander with the stream
Wherever it leads me that's where I'll be
On my purpose, waking up
I feel re-deemed

Where my mind just wander through the stream
Wherever it leads me that is where I will be
It's not what I wanted so I'll leave a trace
Let's sink into these dreams soon as we leave this place

Two pathways diverged
One is easy and one is rough
I chose the one where hope springs high
The celestial influence perched deep in the sky
Can you feel the air? Can you feel the air?

Where my mind just wander
Where my mind just wander

Where my mind just wander through the stream
Wherever it leads me that is where I will be
It's not what I wanted so I'll leave a trace

Let's sink into these dreams soon as we leave this place
Where my mind just wander through the stream
Wherever it leads me that is where I will be
It's not what I wanted so I'll leave a trace
Let's sink into these dreams soon as we leave this place

Where my mind just wander
Where my mind just wander
