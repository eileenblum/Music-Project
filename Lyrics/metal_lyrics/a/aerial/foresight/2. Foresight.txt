I am discovering what it means to believe
We are sparks of divine energy
We will get what we lost
We won't linger in the dark as we learn to live again
We're lost in the storm
And out of the mist I see a light peak through
These stars remind me to be vigilant

Exposing myself for the world to see
I am discovering what it means to believe

Another ghost peers through the entrance
As I walk into a vivacious embrace
But we won't linger in the dark
Past regrets, still present with remembrance
Another ghosts peers through the threshold
But I won't give in
I won't give in

We won't linger in the dark

And as we walk deep, lost within the dawn
Wherever we go, and wherever we've gone
We won't remain forlorn
For you remind us of home
You pulled me out

Dragging me home
You pulled me out

We won't linger in the dark
We won't linger in the dark

Exposing myself for the world to see
I am discovering what it means to believe
Exposing myself for the world to see
I am discovering what it means to believe

I won't give in

Another ghost peers through the threshold
But I won't give in
I won't give in
