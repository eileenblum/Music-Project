Doing the same thing over and over
And hoping for a different result
And what voices do I have to make them fall for me?

Fall for me

So cut the rope and face yourself
Cause we all have our own chamber of regrets
With deception lingering in ever corner
We sought it, and it sought us back
So it's time to lift up your eyes and break away
So it's time to lift up your eyes and break away
Lift up your eyes and break away

So it's time to lift up your eyes and break away

Everything we trust; test us
Everything we trust; test us
And through the torment, we grow restless

Cut the rope
Face yourself

It was never my dream to just belong or linger in distance
It was never my dream to just belong or linger in distance

Lift me up

Everything we ever trust; test us
Everything we ever trust; test us
And through the torment, we grow restless

Doing the same thing over and over, over and over
Doing the same over and over

I forget time and space now as I levitate into existence
Cause I can see the end of the hollow man I used to be

Everything we trust

Everything we ever trust; test us
Everything we ever trust; test us
And through the torment, we grow restless

Everything we ever trust; test us
Everything we ever trust; test us
And through the torment, we grow restless
