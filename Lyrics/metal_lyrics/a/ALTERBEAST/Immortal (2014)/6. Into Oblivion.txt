Unholy light caustic death the sores pulsate mushroom clouds abominate

sweeping waves a toxic breath structures break atoms split execrate shadows burned into the ground

advanced facial deformation generations plagued of similar fates

unholy light caustic death the sores pulsate mushroom clouds abominate appendage growth at random on the torso and limbs misery a concept held by all

the lungs fill with the ashes evaporated skin feel the ripping pain within underneath the barren

wasteland soiled depths below the mutated living ascend

breathe your last curse the night into the void you slip null of life

perverse thirst it will be fed upon the ground earth spills red it rips it stabs it tears apart your hand out stretched into the dark

unholy light caustic death the sores pulsate mushroom clouds abominate appendage growth at random on the torso and limbs misery a concept held by all

the lungs fill with the ashes evaporated skin feel the ripping pain within underneath the barren

wasteland soiled depths below the mutated living ascend

breathe your last curse the night into the void null of life

no god there is no judgement there is no moral barricade false hope blinds you
