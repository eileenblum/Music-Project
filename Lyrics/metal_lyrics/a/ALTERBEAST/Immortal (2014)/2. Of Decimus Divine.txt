Breathe the black thought with heavy dream fear the continuity the pale

resigns bleed out the vestiges burn somber it is the blinded whore

penetrate the heart of dark shadows shrouding all life shrew of nil it comes strewn across the table

the wave shall rape upon the fetid shore violence plays in glares wincing through shadows shrouding all but life the crypt it reigns rape the shore

nemesis of claustrophobic minds a dark and fetid sea a dark and fetid sea

the pale resides bless this opulent death black the crypt reigns a new

redemption bless this opulent death black

suffocate the firmament exsanguination crooked nocturnal sculpture of waste exsanguination oldoroll releasing the elders of life
