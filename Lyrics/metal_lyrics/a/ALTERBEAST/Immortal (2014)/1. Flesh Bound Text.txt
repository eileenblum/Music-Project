Of all the beautiful deaths this night was written in blood soaked perfection an epitaph for memory fondest I bleed my vessels dry for one last glimpse of your frail callous shell

Your legs strewn backwards your chest cavity thus exposed your innards form a bloody mess of a withered rose tendons to separate your facial forms I desecrate heralding triumphant symphonies as I mutilate

Now overcome with every urge to masturbate the sight beheld a vision to these hungry eyes a feast for famine bless this macabre picturesque exposed here now in the dampened dark the bloodshed of my mark

Your legs strewn backwards your chest cavity thus exposed your innards form a bloody mess of a withered rose tendons to separate your facial forms I desecrate heralding triumphant symphonies as I mutilate

Gaze deep into my perfection carved from the gods own reflections witness the birth of my visceral dream my prophets transcribed from their own screams for this was the first page of my magnum opus line after line written in blood placed upon my altar left formless this books dead text made flesh

Viscera strewn outwards appendages are disposed the body forms a sexual and broken pose

Anatomy to excavate my findings I will demonstrate all your hope has been stripped away seed of my loins evacuates

Your legs strewn backwards your chest cavity thus exposed your innards form a bloody mess of a withered rose tendons to separate your facial forms I desecrate heralding triumphant symphonies as I mutilate

You exhale your last breath my shadow eclipses the warmth from your sun beyond the blackest pitch into this abyss no more will this dead angel speak my love she now waits in hells coldest keep carved in her heart removed from her breast written with the bones from her hollowed chest surpass the lengths of time you are forever mine light leaves your eyes eternal your sleep no matter how far always in my reach

Of all the beautiful deaths this night was written in blood soaked perfection an epitaph for memory endless I bleed my vessels dry for one last glimpse of your frail callous shell you and I buried in hell
