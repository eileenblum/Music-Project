Street lurking harlot bottom feeding whore desire cunt flesh parasitic bore

my aching for disease to bathe in the bile mucus dripping repugnant and so vile accentuating my pathophilia desire in fervor I gorge

in this corroded wretched cock worn cavity prevalent cognition of putrid disease plunge forth my phallus into the rotted fire using my member it takes it feeds

Street lurking harlot bottom feeding whore desire cunt flesh parasitic bore

dissevering the legs bathing in floods degraded slave no use for you asphyxiate approaching god gaze in the eyes of creation

I stand elated and fulfilled my thirst for sickness subsided for now until the next time I ravage and befoul

feast upon the blackened sludge fluids sick abhorrent creation drink upon the thickened blood reborn obsession maniacal scorn i am born of disease and hate slave to my will eradicate

A mind perplexed meta morph of thought vexation the air bursts from the lungs blood fills my chest another victim of the mind laid to rest abort rape the innocent malicious hatred for this world I call my own contort break excoriate skin flayed stench of death

it wasn't truth it wasn't fear with one last breath you fade to death a gasping wretch

bless this plague of existence necromancing on this plane beyond this life only death remains

it wasn't truth it wasn't fear with one last breath you fade to death a gasping wretch

abort rape the innocent malicious hatred for this world I call my own contort break excoriate skin flayed these vile remnants

bless this plague of existence necromancing on this plane beyond this life only death remains beyond this life only death remains
