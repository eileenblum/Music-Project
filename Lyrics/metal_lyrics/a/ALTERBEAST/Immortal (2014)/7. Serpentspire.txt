We are the nameless forgotten the ones who answer to the forbidden lord a plague of horror that slumbers in the writ of loathsome passages 

a doom that should not exist desirous of mans extirpation see through pitch black a thousand lifetimes away 

an arid stench a faltering few remain in these darkest of days fire breathes through me a serpent of chaos the fallen of the abyss 

beckon forward cries of torment heathen of thine of generations I speak we call unto you we invoke thee 

We are the nameless forgotten the ones who answer to the forbidden lord a plague of horror that slumbers in the writ of loathsome passages 

fire breathes through me a serpent of chaos billowing hatred infernal scarred by the gods wrath 

We are the nameless forgotten the ones who answer to the forbidden lord a plague of horror that slumbers in the writ of loathsome passages
