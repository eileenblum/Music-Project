Regurgitated hideous lifeforms birthed in ignorance inside these feeding tubes excrement force fed hog tied and harnessed catacombs of blood and iron this concrete cell becomes your tomb 

chained and prodded are you standing proud 

arrogant maggot oh how the gutless have wrought their fate blinded in fear like them you followed they lead you they lead you to your end 

hideous lifeforms birthed in ignorance inside these feeding tubes excrement force fed hog tied and harnessed catacombs of blood and iron this concrete cell becomes your tomb 

don't beg for mercy don't cry for help with mindless obedience weak and submissive you brought this upon yourself you are no longer human you are no longer free you are not a person you're

property 

devolved to animals rotting in filth and shit emaciated creatures bound to bone circling cells of hell like pigs you grovel slop I hope you take the time to stop behold the rot 


you've made yourself a slave to your god don't cry for help circling cells of hell and while like the pigs you grovel the slop you've made yourself a slave to your god don't cry for help circling cells of hell and while like the pigs you grovel the slop
