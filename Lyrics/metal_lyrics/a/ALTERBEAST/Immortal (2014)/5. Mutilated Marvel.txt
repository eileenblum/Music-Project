A voice mutters in the dark an archaic representation of life bleak words like that of a child born from madness now strapped down his wounds sewn shut electricity coursing through veins mutilated marvel behold

this abomination pieced with the flesh of the fallen a walking horror alone in darkness terrified creation of mine

a perversion of life youve become my subject of the deceased buried in dirt and forgotten they will forget you no more currents that flow through your corpse give life

to the beating sack in your chest this monstrosity wakes from its rest

on this night to the graveyard i walk worm riddled canvases strewn in every plot dissecting perfecting this dying art reanimate the heart
