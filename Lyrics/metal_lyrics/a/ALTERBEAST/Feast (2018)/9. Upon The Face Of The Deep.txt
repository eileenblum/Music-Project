With ears to hear and these eyes to see
Night blanketed beneath our feet
With arms embrace the chasm black
Into the void hand in hand
With finger tips feel the abyss
Feel its emptiness
Abandon breath from your chest
Oblivion beckons us

This life erase, eviscerate every trace
Cast it out into the depths
Shadows coiled in these crypts
Push it all onto the brink
'Til all is one and all's extinct
In this dark absence none can exist

And away from this light we slip
Inside this nothingness
The one undone
Into ether it lifts me
These words in silent like this tomb
This womb forever empty

Feel it's cold to cheek benumb
With lips we taste devoured sun
Spiraling this flesh transcend
Unraveling this temporal skin
Like falling ash, let fall your face
Finally our fall from grace
Cast aside this body rotten
We are all forgotten

Obsidian now swallow world
Inside the deepest pit were hurled
We watch the death of every star
Before our eyes
This galaxy we will unstitch
And through the gates and blackest pitch
Onto the other side

Opens wide
Peer through the key hole
And through lidless eye
And to perceive infinite
Dragon and serpent
Dissonant instruments

Trumpets herald signaling the end
Exquisite music leading us into blacken
Reborn from within this cavity
Deaf and blind for all eternity

Bringer of storms expel the light
Shade you adorn
Consume the sky and we'll marvel
How we stole the sun
Floating adrift, it is done
Now all is one

And from which it came
It shall be again
It stretches this endless Goliath
To wave after wave of the cold and the frost we are lost
Submerged inside of this giant
This titan in his fist he holds abyss
And we are freed
Without form and void we shall be

In the furthest reaches
Of this dimension these shadows which are hidden
Enveloped by the gulf
Hollow truly endless
Dematerializing inside these whirlpools
Into black hole condensing these molecules
And be pulled by gravity into this vortex
Reeling finally we stop and are suspended
At the edge of all we stare into Dis
Take my hand plunge from cliff

With ears to hear and these eyes to see
Night blanketed beneath our feet
With arms embrace the chasm black
Into the void hand in hand
With finger tips feel the abyss
Feel its emptiness
Abandon breathe from your chest
Oblivion beckons us

This life erase, eviscerate every trace
Cast it out into the depths
Shadows coiled in these crypts
Push it all onto the brink
'Til all is one and all's extinct
In this dark absence none can exist
