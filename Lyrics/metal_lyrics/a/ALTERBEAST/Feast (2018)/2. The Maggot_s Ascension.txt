We rise

For we once lived in servitude
Their palace built upon our tomb
With hundred eyes we can now see
It's they who'll kneel and bend the knee
Their world in flames and from the ash we rise
Larva laid in side
Food for worms, maggot turns
Ascending flesh

Engulf the sky this hive
Will shadow the world
Erode the throne and face the fall
Those without wings are forced to crawl

This host we'll infect and infest
From where we stand they're all insects
To feed and bleed your only use
In shit you live and die
Invading, gestating, existing, enslaving
Parasitic eggs we sow
Necrotic, symbiotic

They spring from flesh their nest of tissue and bone
No longer slaves beneath
The monolith
behold bodies stretching endless

Maggot metamorphosis
Cataclysmic it all comes to an end
It could not last, under ash
Your hell begins
Flies bring this apocalypse and its done
Once masters, now you're slaves
Your throne has become your grave

For we once lived in servitude
Their palace built upon our tomb
With hundred eyes we can now see
It's they who'll kneel and bend the knee
Their world in flames and from the ash we rise
Larva laid in side
Food for worms, maggot turns
Ascending flesh

Flies swarm from once they're born
This throne, to slaves, now broke their masters chains
His bones, incinerate, cast down his grave we desecrate
His reign, expired, burn in the flames of the funeral pyre
Inferno, you fear, bare witness for hells now here
For hells now here, for hells now here
