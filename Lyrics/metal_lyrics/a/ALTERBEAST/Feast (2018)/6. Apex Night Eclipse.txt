With this incantation we open the black abyss
Words of hate filled with poison
Feel their sting, venomous
We are the legion, we are the horde
We are the den where lions are born

Inverted priests they preach in tongues
In darkened corners, prayers silent
Only heard by one
The lord of liars
Weakness you taste
The body of christ
Spit from your mouth
Step out of the light

Horns of satan
Raised the end of days
Destroyer of worlds
Virgin mother
Look with eyes
Pierce the spear into christ's side
Spit the apple, feast on flesh
True knowledge is gained
The laws of god will bend or break

Unrelenting, never ending
We are the scorn, the phallic born
The goat and the snake
Through portal manifest
True form, behold it's might
Of the unholy light
Disciples of Baphomet
Plague, war and pestilence
Man we enslave forever

His army grows
These sons of whores
They don their armor seed
Infecting these unhallowed spores

Now clad in iron forged from the deep
Their swords are unsheathed
No christians for slaves
They fall under blade

These bloody fields to him we offer
These gifts that we bring
We place at his altar
Deliver us from god
We live by the seven
His evil be done
On earth and in heaven

Beast asleep, he lies in dream
And holds the key
Awaken behemoth, devour the flood
Drown these pigs in lakes of blood
Recite the text, and speak the hex

Oh father of lies we place our hand
Through earth and flesh and pentagram
Conjure these words, say his hymn

666
In your name dark lord we speak
Heavens light forever pierced by night
With this unholy rite
We shall bring god to his knees

666
Summoning the blackest fiend
King of hell, Satan hear our spell
With fang of wolf, we shall feast upon the sheep

666
Feel the serpent's breath in me
There is no christ, no paradise
Your king is dead

With this incantation we open the black abyss
Words of hate filled with poison
Feel their sting, venomous
We are the legion, we are the horde
We are the den where lions are born

Inverted priests they preach in tongues
In darkened corners, prayers silent
Only heard by one
The lord of liars
Weakness you taste
The body of christ
Spit from your mouth
Step out of the light

Angel wings we rip from back
This oath to black
With apex eclipse
And all shall align
Gathered your forces
Await your sign

Recite the text, and speak the hex
Oh father of lies we place our hand
Through time and space until all ends
With these words we summon him

666
In your name dark lord we speak
Heavens light forever pierced by night
With this unholy rite
We shall bring god to his knees

666
Conjuring the blackest fiend
King of hell, Satan hear our spell
With fang of wolf, we shall feast upon the sheep

666
Feel the serpent's breath in me
There is no christ, no paradise
Your king is dead
