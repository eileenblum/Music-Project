Blacken sulfur clouds fill the twilight sky
Forsaken god is deafened to your mortal cry
Defile the young with demon victory
Foul shrieks flood the darkness with their pain and misery

In shallow graves we take no slaves
Worm food left for the rot
Eternal suffering
Could you imagine eternity
Forever drowning in this endless agony
Turned to ash by the fires of hell

Knock down the door
They'll hear our roar
Strike fear down to the core
Slaughter their clergymen
Bathe in the blood of unholy sin
Dig up their fucking graves
Hide their bones in the caves
Penetrate their maggot filled corpses
This city is burned by our torches

This hallowed day we slay
We'll take their lives away
Revolt relentless onslaught
In fear the weak soon fought, we fought
Drink their blood, their eyes will watch in disgust (disgust)
Their legacy now come undone, their memory now turned to dust

Nothing left, not even sound
Cast down
We burn this church to the ground

Beyond this desecration
Foul dirty tainted, blood splattered
Slit their throats, now watch as they drain
The castle has fallen, their town set aflame
A kingdom lie soiled, forever in shame
Cast them unto oblivion, burned into ash

In shallow graves we take no slaves
Worm food left for the rot
Eternal suffering
Could you imagine eternity
Forever drowning in this endless agony
Turned to ash by the fires, these fires of hell
