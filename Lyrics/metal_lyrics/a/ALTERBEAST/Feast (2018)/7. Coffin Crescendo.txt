Wretched soul

Beneath the depths of this ocean a life once lost omit
This movement slowing down fluent motion
Rebirth now you submit
Inside this weakened vessel surrendered unto me
Now feast your eyes upon the blackened sea

Fear is for the living for the dead feel less than nothing
Echoed screams resistance
Eradicate your existence
Boat mans price afterlife, river of infinity
Pray my deeds outweigh my greed, secure my place eternity

These hell fires incinerate
Lay face down in the mourning fields
Bathe in guilt disintegrate
Inside this fucking hatred there is no remorse
This is where filth comes to suffer
This is where death comes to rot

The darkest abyss beyond the river of the gateways
Into morrow we enter this kingdom of pain and death
Agony calls out to me and there is nothing left
Of pain and death there's nothing left

Beyond the bounds of time, depths cloak the edge
Shadows reaching from the dark, taken forsaken we are
My bastard son what have you done for you have surely lost your way
Through the burning gates of the damned
You are damned, damned like me

Beyond the bounds of time, depths cloak the edge
Shadows reaching from the dark, taken forsaken we are
My bastard son what have you done for you have surely lost your way
through the burning gates of the damned
You are damned, damned like me

These hell fires incinerate
Lay face down in the mourning fields
Bathe in guilt disintegrate
Inside this fucking hatred there is no remorse
This is where filth comes to suffer
This is where death comes to rot

The darkest abyss beyond the river of the gateways
Into morrow we enter this kingdom of pain and death
Agony calls out to me and there is nothing left
Of pain and death there's nothing left

Beyond the bounds of time, depths cloak the edge
Shadows reaching from the dark, taken forsaken we are
My bastard son what have you done for you have surely lost your way
Through the burning gates of the damned for you are damned like me
