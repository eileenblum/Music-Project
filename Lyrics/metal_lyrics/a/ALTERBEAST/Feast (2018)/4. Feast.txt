Cold lifeless eyes glare into the night sky
Blood illuminated, reflected in the moons light
Their song now silent
The alpha's howl echoes, calling through the woods

Woods

Blood red eyes feasting for the hunt
The smell of blood stains the snow
Foaming from the mouth

Heart racing
Howling chasing
Caught by the fang of the beast
Devour feast

Fangs rip through skin
Jaw shattered bones
Dragged into the den, then ripped apart
Devoured whole, a carcass left for crows

Wolves pacing
Growling craving
Run faster
Devour feast

Dragged into the wolves den

Blood

Meat torn clean off this human bone
Ghoulish nightmare, the beasts have had their fill

Bones breaking
Snarling, shaking
Caught by the fang of the beast
Devour feast

The pack has returned to the shadows continuing the hunt
Looking for their next prey
These beasts roam freely
Mercilessly consuming the helpless with the greatest of ease

Cold lifeless eyes glare into the night sky
Blood illuminated, reflected in the moons light
Their song now silent
The alpha's howl echoes, calling through his fucking woods
Calling through the woods
