The wolves are at the door
Werebeast breathe life once more
Through nothing we've come crawling
Fighting, ripping, biting, mauling
Monster of the river van
Turning wolf from man
Remove sword from jaw
Devour all

Hello old friends, now snuff the lights
Our howls like music in the night
Under moon we turn and shed our skin
Rise from your grave yet once again
The immortals call, rejoin our pack
Through ice and flame to hell and back
Hoist the badge, raise the flag
We bury teeth in throat

With silver bullets in your gun
You pray you can defend
Against the cursed the utmost worst
The wolves they thirst for them
They thought that they could cage
Like we were dogs, like we'd obey
Sent them all six feet beneath
With bones we pick our fucking teeth

The group has changed since last we met
Hungrier these hounds of set
Insatiable and voracious
We feed on every thing
The weak the strong did eat
This town picked clean, just rancid meat
Feral animal inside
When one wolf dies the pack survives

Like frost we creep, the cold we seep
Into your youth corrupted
Wall of growls the only sounds
Weapons of blast destruction
Under our moon your mortal wound
We leave all asunder
Blood won't thaw for wolves are law
We shred with tooth and claw

At the edge of dark we lie and wait
The reason why you lie awake
At night and stare into the black
These starving eyes are staring back
And your children we have bitten
In this record message hidden
Pour the gas, light the match
Beast calls from fire

Do not deny embrace wolf side
Shape shift and become this
At the altar of the beast
Wolf clan can not be fucked with
Lock the doors, nail the boards
We're waiting out there like the freeze
Waiting for our chance
These wolves hunger for the feast

Thrown to the wolves once more
On battlefield we're born
With spear and claw we bare our teeth
Besiege your walls, run red your streets
All the blood we spill, never get our fill
Kill this world like a disease
Forever wolf and never sheep
