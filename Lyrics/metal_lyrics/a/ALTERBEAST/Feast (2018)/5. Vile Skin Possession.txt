It is I that you now obey
Hidden beneath I lie, in the deep inside your mind
With demonic tongues to consume, answer you'll never find

Control has been lost, mangled left void and null
Bleeding eyes roll to the back of your skull
Haunted their grasp is tightening
Daunted chills frightening
Speaking in demonic tongues
Breathless words now leave weak lungs

Wretched call to dark, this body is consumed by black
We bare his mark we hear his bark, through flesh and bone we hack
This curse I bequeath
This creature spawned from beneath
Bruised skin pale and torn
Hijacked now take your form

Distorted form levitates, cursing foul obscenities
Guttural voice damned to hell for their obscurities
Malevolent possessed plunge this dagger in your chest
Escape now be thwarted a body contorted

We are unquenched suffocating terror
Imagery of Satan thus depicted
Suffer now witness this true horror
This wretched curse shall be inflicted
Suffer, gaze as light slips away
Suffer, eyes bleed a hollow grey

Broken vertebrae
It is I that you now obey
Hidden beneath I lie, in the deep inside your mind
With demonic tongues to consume, answer you'll never find

Control has been lost, mangled left void and null
Bleeding eyes slowly roll to the back of your skull
Haunted their grasp is tightening
Daunted these chills so frightening
Speaking in demonic tongues
Breathless words now leave weak lungs

Wretched call to dark, this body is consumed by black
We bare his mark we hear his bark, through flesh and bone we hack
This curse I bequeath
This creature spawned from beneath
Bruised skin pale and torn
Hijacked now take your form
Dead inside this will defied
Broken decayed
Exist to feel pain
Dead inside this will defied and undone
Dead eyes turn a hollow grey
