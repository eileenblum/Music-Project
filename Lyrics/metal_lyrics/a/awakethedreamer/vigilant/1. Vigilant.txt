Wake up!

I have seen what defines a dream
Let me show a truth the world has never seen
Hate, Greed, Obey the brave
The saints we save turn their eyes away
It's time to wake the fuck up
How can we be so blind?

We awaken to the melodies that'll fade away
With open eyes we lie awake while mankind's asleep

Realizing what always was an illusion inside our minds
We are trapped inside our self fed lie
To see behind the clouds, we have to wake the fuck up

We are locked behind in a prison of greed built with bars from your god
Made these thoughts unreal

We awaken to the melodies that'll fade away
With open eyes we lie awake while mankind is

Locked behind in a prison of greed built with bars from your god

We lie awake while mankind's asleep

We'll save ourselves and let our saints descend
For all the broken lies
For all the broken lies
You marked a target on your fucking head, you disgrace
So watch your back and remain vigilant

We awaken to (We awaken to)
The melodies that'll fade away (They'll fade away)
With open eyes (With open eyes)
We lie awake while mankind's asleep
