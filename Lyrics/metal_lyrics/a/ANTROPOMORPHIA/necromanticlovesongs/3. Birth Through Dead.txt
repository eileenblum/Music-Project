Graving through the mud
For a body that's withered away
The surch for delight
And intense decay

The embalmed skin
Moisted and cold
Body Only
Two months old

My... sickened urge to fuck the dead
To rape her skull
And eat her flesh
Between her legs i climax
Planting seed
Birth through dead

Impregnated dead
A child inside to grow
The mother as it's meal
Rotting down below

My... sickened urge to fuck the dead
To rape her skull
And eat her flesh
Between her legs I climax
Planting seed
Birth through dead

Spilling sperm inside a corpse
Live has formed itself inside the womb
Carrier of my lust
Brings forth a living pile of rot

Graving through the mud
For body that's withered away
The black an rotten flesh
I'll eat away

I chew on cacky flesh
That's moisted and cold
Sexual Feelings
I fuck the stiff and cold

My... sickened urge to fuck the dead
To rape her skull
And eat her flesh
Between her legs I climax
Planting seed
Birth through dead
