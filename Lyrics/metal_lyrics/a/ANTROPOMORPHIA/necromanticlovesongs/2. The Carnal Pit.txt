Entering the grave
To fuck the decayed
Repulsive stench
Clouding the brain
The smell of decay
The touch of the flesh
So nice and cold
It drives me insane

Peeling the flesh that has started to flake away
Gnawing on meat that has fallen into dead
Slice up the corpse, through flesh I carve my way

Mummified
Stinking stench of death
Corrosive fume
Burning in my head
There lying cold
I look with some dismay
but then I start to slice
Through guts I'll eat my way

Carnal pit

Mutilate 
Dismember arms and legs
Carving through
With rusty blade I hack
Gaping sores
Leaking bile and pus the bloody whore
I splatter to mush

On graveyards I'm feasting by
Slaughtering the dead
Can't help the sickness
That's burning in my head

Shredded cartilage, collapsed is the back
My hands around her neck, vile crack
(as if she was alive)

Mummified
Stinking stench of dead
Corrosive fume
Burning in my head
There lying cold
I look with some dismay
but then I start to slice
Through guts I'll eat my way
