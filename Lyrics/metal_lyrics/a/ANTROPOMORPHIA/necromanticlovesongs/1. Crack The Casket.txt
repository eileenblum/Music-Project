*Chorus:
Crack the casket
Get out the corpse -  an take away
Rotten bowels - cook em up
Taste the decay

Digging in cacky mud
In surch for rot
Can't be stopped
Once the stench got up her nose
Almost cumming by the sight of the corpse
Lying in a pool of piss
Repeat Chorus*

Rotted meat a real treat
The taste so sweet
The hard and cold cock
That's in state of rot
She slices of

Emotions are getting high
Her face turns red
Can't control the eager
To fuck this dead
Severed cock for intercourse

Can't hold back this sickened lust
Masturbating with his guts
Sucking on his putrid cock
All overwhelmed with love
Climax, on this pile of gore
Which now isn't needed anymore
Bones she starts to smash
Shredding last flakes of flesh
