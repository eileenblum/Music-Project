Pus is cozing from of you
As I pull away the skin
Make a hole inside of you
Tear out what's within

Slicing through the tissue
A lust for rotten flesh
I love to gnaw on maggots
That dwell within the dead

The body a pile of pus dwelling maggots
That bread beneath the skin
Stick my hand inside the stomach
And tear out what's within
Ram my axe inside the skull
This sight drives me insane
When i'm through with your piss filed kidneys
I'll start on the rotten brain

Carve the eyeballs out
Out the rotten head
Blood is spurting from
The leaking head
Gutted flesh I chew
The putrid meat
My mouth upon her cunt
That is what I love to eat
