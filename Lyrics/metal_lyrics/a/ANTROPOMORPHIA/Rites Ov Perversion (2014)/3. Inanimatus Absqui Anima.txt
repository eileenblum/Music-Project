Persephone
Cthonic Whore
Letâs rob some emptiness from these graves
Tempt the deathwish
Like the raptor on itâs prey
White pulvering bones to ash
Smothered is this swamp ov flesh
Unraveled visions reveal to meÂ­
The sex Â­
Her luscious divinity

Aesthetic perversions in the flesh
Lick away the salt from the sweat between her thighs
Blue, cold and passed away
Her body, once alive
Once Alive!

The Rape ov Kore!Â­

The blade, Her throat, My hands, Feel cold
The rope, Her neck, The specter ov death
Alive no more.
This gracious whore
Cthonic princess. Heleneion whore
!Heleneion whore!

The Rape ov Kore!Â­

[spoken voice:]
âAnd now with rising terror from the dark void Â­ThanatosÂ­
The atrophy ov her beautyÂ­
Swayed in blood.
A maroon aurora stretches, throughout these tar blackwalls Â­
Wherein I beset, Her cold and crimson death.â

The blade, Her throat, My hands, Feel cold
The rope, Her neck, The spectre ov death
Alive no more. This gracious whore
Cthonic princess. Heleneion whore
!Heleneion whore!

The Rape ov Kore!Â­

And pray that all may come
That vulgarisis body and soul
Eater of innocence
Destructor ov form
The vanity ov your decay
A flourishing myrtle trampled
A Pantheon ov deprived
Corperal sway
