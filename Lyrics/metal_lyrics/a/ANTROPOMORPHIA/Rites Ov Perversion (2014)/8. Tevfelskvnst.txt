Nebulous reflections
Nurtured by blood &amp; flame
Servitude to wickedness
Beyond the shadows ov the Grave
From the river ov blackened waters comes forth this dormant creation
The desolated beauty in a cascade ov abomination

[Chorus:]
Hallucinogenic forms
Seas ov eroded bones
Pathogenic whores
Born from the withered womb

Frozen tongues
Sing a requiem ov woeful cries
From the depths ov Irk-al-la
Shadows dance like a rapteuos blazing pale fire
Salvific darkness runs through venal clotted veins
Pacified hearts revived by morbid grace

Nocturnal sacrifice
Purity defiled

Self-deifying sexual rites
Incestuous crimes

Daughters ov Cain
Communion ov pale
Gospel ov whores
Invocation ov the nine brides

The light ov the crescent moon
Engulfed by a blackened storm
As the daughters ov mist
Take anthropomorphic form
Naked mantles nourished and mothered by her deamon blood
Shadow flesh servitors ov her sexual lust
