Unshackled from this carnal garment full ov wretched, cancerous devouring light
A desirous carrier ov a venal melancholic lie
Subdued misery
Affirmation
Loathsome in every stride

Profound intense exultation
Vermin ov the womb
Lamb ov deceitful desire

[Chorus:]
Devouring pallid tides
Taste, Crowned in smoldering ash
Ghastly voices rise
Announce My beckoning death
Desolate freedom
Imprisoned by the murmur ov a formless life
Necromantical screams
Tortured wails
Withers the flame â Maze ov the blind

Embody and nourish
The cold caressing down my spine
Profound intense exultation
Valour â Wields the knife

Arterial purging
Inhale the beckoning yonder
A Numb weary embrace
The jaws ov this lawless hunger
Incised dissonance ov silence
Coagulation ov a pulsating flood
Unrelenting torment â binds this hearse ov flesh and bone
The oncoming wall ov darkness
Endless salvation pierced with poisoned thorns
Ground becomes my flesh
Wallowed in ashes cold
