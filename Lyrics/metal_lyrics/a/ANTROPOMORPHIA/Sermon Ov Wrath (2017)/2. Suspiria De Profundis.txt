The gates to the path ov self are open
Parting ov the flesh
Formless ascent
The gates to the path ov self are open
Exalted trance
Exceeding death

Perpetual waters tearing time
Tarnished heart ov fear
Ailment pours from the veins ov life
Intravenous drip ov a languid fire
Father's demon seed
The flames will ignite
Yearning to die

Veil ov wicked dead
Darkened rays ov light
Carving effigies
Veil ov wicked dead
Venomous desire
Devouring demon seed
Veil ov wicked dead
Split the ash filled vein
The immutable dream

The gates to the path ov death are open
The end is nigh
Stillness collides
The gates to the path ov death are open
Plague ov life
The blade ov sacrifice

Rise through the path ov flesh ov this Earth
Cast the cloak and release
Baptized by a second birth
Intravenous drip ov a languid fire
Father's demon seed
The flames will ignite
Yearning to die
