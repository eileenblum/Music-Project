To live and die without a smile.
Makes you wonder, what we are is not at all
worth time we waste away this day and age.

Until we spread these broken wings well never heal and learn to fly.
Lets shake the world and awaken the closed lids of our third eye.

We walk on broken glass to feel nothing, until we spread these broken wings well never heal and learn to fly.
Lets shake the world and awaken our third EYE.

As the masses burn,
we all have the water to smother out their flames,
but we don't care to douse our brothers.
So we watch the char and ashes fly,
as the masses burn,
as the masses burn!

Its time for us to start the change
that we want this world to be.
Well lock or hands and the lead
to the sun we shall not burn.

We talk but no actions walk for everyone
its time for a change.
Life is more than a game for everyone
its fading away.

Our hands our eyes our hearts our souls won't divide!
