Predicting what was next to come was never easy.
Disregarding ulterior motives and failing certainty
Still I remember how you sounded before the flood fell.
I felt the angels lift you up as earth was taken by hell.

Take a look inside.
Take a look at whats consumed you.
Disillusioned by day dreams and innocent nightmares.

We have the same exact image etched in our minds.
We savor depravity no on can justify
I taste the air in your lungs, I take what I can
You cannot live my life, you cannot make this right

I remember how you sounded before the flood fell
I felt the angels lift you as our worlds were taken
I remember how you sounded with every collapsed breath
I felt the angels lift you as our worlds were taken

We have the same exact image etched in our minds.
We savor depravity no on can justify
Still I remember how you sounded before the flood fell.
I felt the angels lift you up as earth was taken by hell.

Were so desperate for someone to lead us to familiar grounds, a safe and sound collision
(DECEPTION)
Disillusioned by daydreams deception within innocent nightmares take me away

(burn)
Were so desperate for someone to lead us on
Were so desperate for someone to lead us on

Lead us on
How long can I take this
Oh God am I forsaken
Well be gone
How long can I take this
Oh God am I forsaken
Lead us on
