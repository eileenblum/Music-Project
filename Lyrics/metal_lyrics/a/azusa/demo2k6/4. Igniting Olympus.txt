Fortune has bequeathed me this day
Count down to black out and love
Well let time be our murderer
Sipping wine at the fall of Rome
Without a trace I'll find
The right ways to
Misinterpret

Words can't turn back time
I can't believe this, here we go again
I'll swear that on this death bed that my
CONVICTION STAND THEIR GROUND
As you turn my
Remember that
If silence be broken
You can't break integrity

So this is where you have me at your benevolence
And I'll entertain your ego just for 1 step closer
Underestimations just got the best of you my darling
And now you find your self in this adverse circumstance

So I'll try to make this as painless as I can
And I would be so kind to make this cinematic climax quick
But make no mistake my cutthroat sweetheart
The demon Ive become takes more than an eye for an eye

Lackluster fallacies has collapsed pillars of faith
Hail to the idiots savant
Cradle now a last resort to desperation
Sacred hearts doused in kerosene

I'll strike the match that ignites the furies
For heavens sake
And burn every word thats said from a prophets orifice
Last words may be useful now

I'll strike the match that ignites the furies
For heaven's sake

Words can't turn back time
I can't believe this, here it comes again
I'll swear that on this death bed that my
CONVICTION STAND THEIR GROUND
As you turn my
Remember this that
If silence be broken
You can't break integrity
I'll swear that on this death bed that my
CONVICTION STAND THEIR GROUND

Whose the captain of this sinking ship
Will you use your arms to sink or swim?
Lift a hand for once and it might
Just ignite some sympathy from
Someone who never wanted
To let it end up this way
