Stung by your passionate darkness
ferocious in its form
Embraced by your chaotic freedom
its beautiful perfection

Essence of pure despair
running through my veins
yet I love every second,
every minute, every hour

You chemical relief
eradicates my pain
I loose myself for you,
forever devoured

Staring into the endless black
Not a single sound can be heard

Tearing life into pieces
spreading in the wind
I've accepted what tomorrow brings

I've got no hope left
can't let this go on
A final date with the needle... one last sting

As the cold wind caresses my skin
nothing but emptiness remains

Tearing life into pieces
spreading in the wind
I've accepted what tomorrow brings

I've got no hope left
can't let this go on
A final date with the needle... one last sting
