Life - once serene and innocent
Spread across the earth like a fatal disease
Earth - once so peaceful and calm
Raped and abused, time after time.

Depopulate - bring death to life
Euthanasia - for the human race
Depopulate - bring death to life
Euthanasia - for the human race

Why can't you see the solution?
It seems so obvious, isn't it so?
Can't you give me an option?
Or else I'll bringn you the end

Depopulate - bring death to life
Euthanasia - for the human race
Depopulate - bring death to life
Euthanasia - for the human race

Life brings death and death brings life
they both depend on each other
Two opposites in lovely harmony
Come death, come life, come storm!

The cleansing has begun
I can feel it in the air I breathe
The lovely smell of death
can't get rid of the filth you see

Life - once serene and innocent
Spread across the earth like a fatal disease
Earth - once so peaceful and calm
Raped and abused, time after time.

Depopulate - bring death to life
Euthanasia - for the human race
Depopulate - bring death to life
Euthanasia - for the human race
