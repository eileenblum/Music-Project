Eyes as closed as can be
but still I can see
Pictures flashing by
inside the lid of my eyes

There's no escape
No use to fight, just wait
As my mind keeps struggling
to stay sane

This is how it feels... damn you
This is how it feels... I hate you

Insomnia
Can't you see
You will bring insanity

Insomnia
Leave me be
Can't you see the chaos you feed

Forget the dreams so sweet
They're all escaping me
Inside my head the world is turning violently

Blood is boiling in my vein
torturing my brain
This restless feeling in my bones is slowly killing me

This is how it feels... damn you
This is how it feels... I hate you

Insomnia
Can't you see
You will bring insanity

Insomnia
Leave me be
Can't you see the chaos you feed

This mental chaos that's growing in my head
is draining me of life, it's fucking eating me alive
