Although it always rains on me
and all the days look the same
I want nothing more than to be alone

While my self-esteem is failing
and the faith slowly fades away
I put my only hope in you... in you

Staring into the barrel of a gun
Is there another way to see the stars?
As I'm about to end my life,
thirst is all I know

The only feeling I have left
is the urge for you
My beloved liquid friend,
it's not we who are the fools

Dreaming, falling, floating
It's all against me
Naked, dancing, roaring
Accept me or fuck off

Dreaming, falling, floating
It's all against me
Naked, dancing, roaring
Accept me or fuck off

Under the light of the moon I can seeÂ 
Shining color now set free
This great feeling when you're with me
Drunk forever I will be... I will be
