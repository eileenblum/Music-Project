I can't take it anymore
Can't help but feel like shit
Don't want to be your whore

I don't sell out, this is who I am
Don't fake your faÃ§ade to me
I see right through

You think you're standing over me
Think again 'cause I'm not leaving this be
For you that's a well-played card
but anyone can see through, it's not that hard

When all is said and done
there's no more room for words
It's time to shut up and just stop

When all is said and done
there's no more room for words
It's time to shut up and just stop

I can't take it anymore
Can't help but feel like shit
Don't want to be your whore

I don't sell out, this is who I am
Don't fake your faÃ§ade to me
I see right through
