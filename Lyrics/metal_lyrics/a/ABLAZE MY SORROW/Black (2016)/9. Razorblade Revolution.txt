We are revolution
We are vengeance

Revolution is in the air
Time has come will you be there
Time to act time to rise
Don't get fed these goddamn lies

Now it's time to make a stand
Join us now we know you can
See our banners held up high
hear our thunderous warcry

Razorblade revolution
Razorblade revolution
Razorblade revolution
Razorblade revolution

We are revolution
We are vengeance

Razorblade revolution
Razorblade revolution
Razorblade revolution
Razorblade revolution

Revolution is in the air
Time has come will you be there
Time to act time to rise
Don't get fed these goddamn lies

Now it's time to make a stand
Join us now we know you can
See our banners held up high
hear our thunderous warcry
