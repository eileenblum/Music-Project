Come forth and end my life
otherwise I will end yours
You better make it fast
or taste the fury from my fists

Where my demon grows,
it's an awful place for you
When you are dressed in white
I feel disgust

It's something I have to show,
the devil made me do it
An awesome dress in black
just for you

Now when we are gathered as one
Love your master as if he was your son

Embarrassed - overlooked
Our lives mean nothing
Possessed - well dressed
Roll the carpet for success

Now it's time for our revenge,
no christian life to be spared
They better hide for what to come
or it will be their last breath
