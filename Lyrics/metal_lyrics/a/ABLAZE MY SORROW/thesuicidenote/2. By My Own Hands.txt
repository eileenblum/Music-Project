I don't want to see any misery that makes me cry
destroyed through with pain and sorrow
to stand alone make my long sharp knife
making sure that there will be no tomorrow

[bridge:]
for far long too I've longed for my death
tonight is the night when I say facing goodbye
a smile can be seen as I take my last breath
blank turns my eyes... then I die

[chorus:]
tonight ill be leaving this world
ill be leaving by my own hands
tonight ill be leaving this world
ill be leaving by my own hands

my life has been torn to pieces over and over again
I'm tired of this shit and will take it no more
for too long I've lived with the anguish and the pain
ill leave this fucking life, suicidal to the core
