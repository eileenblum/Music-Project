In a time long forgotten by man
When our ground still belonged to us
Our ancestors fought your armies
With swords in our hands

In a time when the northmen stood proud
Ina time when the northmen stood proud
Hear the thunderstorm as it roar
As you are approaching the final war

Our time will soon be here
The time when we will strike back
With swords in our hands
And strenght in our hearts

Prepare the return of the mighty raven...

In a time when the northmen stood proud
Ina time when the northmen stood proud
Hear the thunderstorm as it roar
As you are approaching the final war

When lightning strikes the sky
Your death is closing in
As heaven starts to cry
There is no way you can win

Prepare th return of the mighty raven...
