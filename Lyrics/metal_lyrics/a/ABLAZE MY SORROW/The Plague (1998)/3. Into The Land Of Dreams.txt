Close your eyes and fall asleep
And I will guide you to my kingdom
A place where we will unite
When the day turns to night

Join me - fly with me - into the land of dreams
We will walk through archways of solid gold
We will swim in lakes of wine
Fly with me - into the land of dreams
Join me - fly with me - into the land of dreams
We will walk through archways of solid gold
We will swim in lakes of wine
Join me - fly with me - forever - dreaming

In a world without limitations
Where worlds are heard but never spoken
Where reality becomes unreal
Join me - into my dreams

Close your eyes and fall asleep
And I will guide you to my kingdom
A place where we will unite
When the day turns to night

Join me - fly with me - into the land of dreams
We will walk through archways of solid gold
We will swim in lakes of wine
Fly with me - into the land of dreams
Join me - fly with me - into the land of dreams
We will walk through archways of solid gold
We will swim in lakes of wine
Join me - fly with me - forever - dreaming

In a world without limitations
Let your fantasies become real
On a trip far from life
Join me - into my dream
