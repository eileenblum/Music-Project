Is this just a preparation
For what is soon to come?
Another life might be waiting
For me to enter the tomb

I am not the only one
I am dying to find out
I want my life to rest
Solution suicide

I am not the only one
I am dying to find out
I want my life to rest
Solution suicide

This life is filled with ignorance
We are all born to die
No one knows what is to come
No one can see beyond life and time

Enter the realm of death
Sacrifice your life
To fill the emptiness
With knowledge from the other side

I am not the only one
I am dying to find out
I want my life to rest
Solution suicide

I am not the only one
I am dying to find out
I want my life to rest
Solution suicide
