What do you expect to see
The victory of humanity?
Your troops are only here and there
I am everywhere

You can burn it and pray that it dies
But it never just rests a while

You will be the victim of my game
You will be enslaved
Forever vanguished
Forever my slaves

I will build a mountain of skulls
And a castle of pain
I will build a throne of blood
You will be my slaves

I will build a mountain of skulls
And a castle of pain
I will build a throne of blood
I will be your god

What do you expect to see
The victory of humanity?
Your troops are only here and there
I am everywhere

I will build a mountain of skulls
And a castle of pain
I will build a throne of blood
You will be my slaves

I will build a mountain of skulls
And a castle of pain
I will build a throne of blood
I will be your god

You will be the victim of my game
You will be enslaved
Forever vanguished
Forever my slaves
