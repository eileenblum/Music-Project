A voyage through time and eternity
Through sorrows, grief and pain
This fucking life - this fucking pain
An eternal plague of mine

This fucking life - this fucking pain
An eternal plague of mine

I soar in this level between life and death
Not knowing where I am heading
This total silence, this total calm
Makes me wanna die

This fucking life - this fucking pain
An eternal plague of mine

Eternal death is calling my name
The world below awaits me
My life finally laid to rest
The world below awaits me

I soar in this level between life and death
Not knowing where I am heading
This total silence, this total calm
Makes me wanna die

Eternal death is calling my name
The world below awaits me
My life finally laid to rest
The world below awaits me

A voyage through time and eternity
Through sorrows, grief and pain
This fucking life - this fucking pain
An eternal plague of mine

This fucking life - this fucking pain
An eternal plague of mine
