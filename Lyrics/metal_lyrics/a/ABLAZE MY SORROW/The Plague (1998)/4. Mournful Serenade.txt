Remember your carress so gentle
Remember your kiss so delightful
With tears running down my cheek
I sit here alone wondering - why?

Sing with me - this song of love so pure
Sing with me - this mournful serenade
Sing with me - this song of love so pure
Sing with me - this mournful serenade

The pain inside me is unbearable
My love for you stronger than ever
Why this sudden departure
Why did you decide to end your own life

Sing with me - this song of love so pure
Sing with me - this mournful serenade
Sing with me - this song of love so pure
Sing with me - this mournful serenade

With the moon as my only light
I stare at the picture of you
With one shot I ended my life
So that we forever will be united
