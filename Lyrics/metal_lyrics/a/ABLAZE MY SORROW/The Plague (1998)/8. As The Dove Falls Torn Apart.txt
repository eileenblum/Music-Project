Hear thes sounds of war, it is coming, it is here
The dove of peace falls torn apart

We will not go quietly into the night
We will not vanish without a fight

Never - go into the night
Never - vanish without a fight

Unleash my fire, unleash my hell
To make you suffer, to bring you pain
Unleash my fire, my inner hell
If you will fight me, you will fight in vain

Watch the ashes scatter in the wind
As the dove of peace falls torn apart

Your flame has ceased, you will pass away
A dismal moment, not for me
Spread out the fire, sread out the pain
A total desolation, I feel complete

Hear thes sounds of war, it is coming, it is here
The dove of peace falls torn apart

The war is here, the dove falls torn apart

Unleash my fire, unleash my hell
To make you suffer, to bring you pain
Unleash my fire, my inner hell
If you will fight me, you will fight in vain

Your flame has ceased, you will pass away
A dismal moment, not for me
Spread out the fire, sread out the pain
A total desolation, I feel complete
