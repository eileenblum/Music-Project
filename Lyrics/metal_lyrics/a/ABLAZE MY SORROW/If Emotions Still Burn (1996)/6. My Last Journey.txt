Without noticing the pouring rain
I sliced my wrist with my knife
I couldn't ignore the endless pain
The last thing in my dreary life

"Dark clouds filled the open sky
My heart was filled with hate
I bent down on my knees and cried
Is this really my fate?"

"I'll never again see the sun rise
Cause now I'm in my eternal bed
Death is so sweet and nice
And I enjoy being dead"

On this, my last journey
