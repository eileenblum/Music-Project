Shining bright but yet so dark
Full of love but yet so spiteful
Devoted to the mightiest of all powers
I whisper thy name in my dream

Rise above the storming sea
Come forth and unite with me
My goddess of lust and desire
Come forth and release your fire

Mesmerized by your beauty
I gaze into your eyes
Dreaming away, far away
Into another sphere
