This is the way of my living
This is the choice of my life
Will I be weak and obey you?
No, I'll stand strong and be me

I deny - your god
And all that - he stands for
I can't - understand
How someone - can follow your pathetic lies

I spit on you and I spit on your god
I have chosen my way to live

You say that I shall love
I say that I shall hate

If Jesus made wine out of water
Then I'll make wolves out of sheep
