On my black horse I ride
Towards the end of time
By the christians you were sentenced and died
Burned at the stake to redeem your crime

As the autumn leaf in the purling rill
My people followed their lie
But for you sake my queen
I'll scournfully watch them die

My utter denial of their god
Makes me divine
Their death will be
The ultimate revenge of mine
