As I fell asleep I could hear your scream
As I fell deeper into your my dream - you died

Did I not bleed for you?
Did I not suffer?
Did I not cry for you, my dear?

You took your life, my dear
You entered hell, my love

I want to be with you
Not even death can stop me

I enter the gate of the realm of death
As I face the eternity
I feel the emptiness and desperation

"In the darkest place of this Earth
Where the wild wolves are howling"

I seem to be one with the winds
As I soar through the air

I took my life, my dear
I entered hell, my love

As I fell asleep you could hear me scream
As you fell deeper into your dream - I died
Forever - resting in hell
