Alone I wonder in this misty forest
In this my (own) world of darkness
There are no lights that show me the way
The screams from my past surround me

The rain that falls tastes like blood
The blood that falls enchantes my soul
The chickets around me burn like fires
The fires around me enchantes my soul

Fear ain't a part of me, my feelings are no longer mine
Here in this my kingdom
Where the trees are my people
and the rivers my servants

The rain that falls tastes like blood
The blood that falls enchantes my soul
The chickets around me burn like fires
The fires around me enchantes my soul

Is this a dream or is this me?
