[Music: M.Carlsson / Ablaze My Sorrow]
[Lyrics: M.Carlsson]

Give me energy
I can't control myself
I'm burning up from inside
There is no contact to your world
The flame inside me just died

Every day will be the same 
My only passion will heal my pain 
One day light will come 
For me it did never exist

True love is an empty bottle 
Which I made promise to 
True love is shining colours 
Once again it will be shown 
True love can't be taken away 
It will never disappear 
True love is here to stay 
Now I've got nothing to fear

Your world is a blind mans eyes 
That will show me eternity 
Your ear can't obtain my cries 
I've already set my destiny 
As we walk the path of life 
Which seems to have no end 
Alcohol made my cold emotions 
And the rush is my only friend
