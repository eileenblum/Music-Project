[Music: D.Linden / Ablaze My Sorrow]
[Lyrics: K.Lonnsjo]

Divine warmachine, terror on wheels of steel
Engine roaring like thunder on the field
Is it Hell? Is it Eden?
No sympathy, no peace
Just anger, hate and fury

Suffering an higher art of pleasure
Pain, revel in this agony
Soldier, living for the kill
Soldier, living for the thrill

No mercy, crush the weak
High on blood, feel the rush
Fire guns, destroy the hush

FIRE!!!

Supremacy through shells of steel
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Charging forwards, no turning back
Engage in battle, ATTACK ATTACK!	

Metallic wagons of fear invading everywhere
Yeah... Hell is here...
