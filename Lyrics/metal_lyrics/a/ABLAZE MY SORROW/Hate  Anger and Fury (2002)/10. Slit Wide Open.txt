[Music: M.Carlsson / Ablaze My Sorrow]
[Lyrics: A.Brorsson]

There seems to be no meaning 
There seems to be no hope 
There seems to be no meaning 
It's time to fetch the rope

These thoughts carve in my mind 
The scars they make are eternal 
My hate grows stronger each day 
The hate towards life and myself

I'm drowning in this vicious river of suicidal thoughts 
Stopped struggling for the surface a long time ago

These scars inside of me 
Now slit wide open 
My life has ceased to be 
Now slit wide open

This painful agony 
Come death set me free 
My life has ceased to be 
Now slit wide open

There seems to be no meaning 
There seems to be no hope 
There seems to be no meaning 
It's time to fetch the rope

Is this the last you'll ever hear from me? 
This remains to be seen 
Does anyone really care? 
I know that I don't

These scars inside of me 
Now slit wide open 
My life has ceased to be 
Now slit wide open

This painful agony 
Come death set me free 
My life has ceased to be 
Now slit wide open
