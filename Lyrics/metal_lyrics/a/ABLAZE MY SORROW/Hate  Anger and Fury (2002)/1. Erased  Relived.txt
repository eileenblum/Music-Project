[Music: M.Carlsson / Ablaze My Sorrow]
[Lyrics: M.Carlsson]

Black shadows creeping down the wall
Another life is about to end
I can feel the hour creeping closer now
Today it's my execution day

Without fear in my eyes
I walk 30 meters to the chair
The thoughts that rush through my brain
Makes me once again see their pain

Kill me, set me free
Come to me beautiful death
Kill me, set me free
Feel the pleasure of killing me

I rather dead forever 
Then living without my needs

When the lightning strike through my eyes
And my skin starts to burn
This act will give you satisfaction
You think you have saved the world
