[Music: M.Carlsson / Ablaze My Sorrow]
[Lyrics: D.Linden]

I can't close my eyes
Staring straight into the empty sky
Feeling trapped an overfilled with lies
I can't deny
These lovely thoughts of death has crossed my mind

I can't deny
Death is on my mind

I can't close my eyes
I'm feeling trapped inside a world of lies
I can't see what's real, it's all disguised
I can't deny
These lovely thoughts of death has crossed my mind

I hate this world 
I hate this life

I focus on the strength 
The strength I'm building up inside 
I feel it growing stronger every day 
Strong enough to take my life away

I have closed my eyes
My final rest saved me from all those lies
It's over, I'm free from this pain called life
I can't deny
I'm dead, I'm cold, I'm six feet under ground

I can't deny
I'm dead, I'm cold, it ain't no lie

I focus on the strength 
The strength I'm building up inside
I feel it growing stronger every day 
Strong enough to take my life away

Suicidal!
