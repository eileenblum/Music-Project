[Music: M.Carlsson / D.Linden / Ablaze My Sorrow]
[Lyrics: K.Lonnsjo]

I will follow my desire 
Building up my dreams empire 
Not listening to your bullshit 
I'm free I have no sire

I will not hesitate
If you stand in my way
Then I'll promise you
You won't see another day

I am the one 
That fulfill my dreams 
I will live my life 
Ad Libitum!!

See my crowbar in your face 
My knife in your heart 
My fingers around your neck 
I won't think twice

I am the one 
That fulfill my dreams 
I will live my life 
Ad Libitum!!

I am a predator	
You are the prey
So shut your mouth
And hear what I have to say

Life is survival 
Only the strong will live on 
The future lies clouded 
For you, not me

I'm on top on the food chain 
Your just another worm 
Your efforts to pull me down 
Well they are in vain

I am the one 
That fulfill my dreams 
I will live my life 
Ad Libitum!!

This is our world
We don't want you here!
