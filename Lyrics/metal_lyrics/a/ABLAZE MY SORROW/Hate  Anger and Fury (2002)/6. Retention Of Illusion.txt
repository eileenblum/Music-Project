[Music: M.Carlsson / Ablaze My Sorrow]
[Lyrics: K.Lonnsjo]

Faithful believers of a nonexisting god 
Waste all your life on your bare knees 
Reality a word unknown 
Passing your head with a gentle nod
Brainwashed from the day of your birth

Religious fanatic from the cradle to the grave 
Christian pedophiliac is that your way to save?
Why can't you see beyond, the illusion, the lie 
Just sitting there praying to an empty sky

You are maggots, sheep's that walk in flock 
Not able to think on your own 
Don't come to me begging for mercy 
No fucking remorse, you are going down

Religious fanatic from the cradle to the grave
Christian pedophiliac is that your way to save? 
Why can't you see beyond, the illusion, the lie 
Just sitting there praying to an empty sky

I hate you
I curse you
The truth is what I speak
My words is your defeat

Day in day out before your precious icon 
Your life is mine to waste 
Blindfolded "men" of god
I deny your lords existence! 
Holy father nothing more than phantasm
Pestilential lord of lies
