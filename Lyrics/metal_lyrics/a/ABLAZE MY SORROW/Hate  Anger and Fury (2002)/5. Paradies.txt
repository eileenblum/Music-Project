[Music: M.Carlsson / Ablaze My Sorrow]
[Lyrics: K.Lonnsjo]

Gazing up to the blackened sky
Makes part of me slowly die
Among a clouds I can see a dove
The messenger of love

Follow it, they said, to paradise
Afterwards I hate them and their lies
It was the beginning of my demise

I've been in Paradise, don't want to go back
It makes my feeling go numb and black
I couldn't find the desire of my heart
It was far away and slowly breaking apart

Hypocrisy and lies
There is no fucking paradise
Looking for the love of my life
It isn't in your fucking Paradise

I'm grasping for air, so thick I can't breathe
Inhale, exhale, asphyxiate
Among a clouds I can see a dove
The messenger of love
