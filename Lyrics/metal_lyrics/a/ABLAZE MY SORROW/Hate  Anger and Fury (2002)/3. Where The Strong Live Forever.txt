[Music: D.Linden / M.Carlsson / Ablaze My Sorrow]
[Lyrics: K.Lonnsjo]

Bom to die, our fate has been sealed
The webs of life spun since day one	     
Odin father of death, our paths will cross
In the halls of Valhalla well feast, warriors from north

These seas whipped by the fury of Jormundgand 
These mountains born from the teeth of Ymer
Beautiful and majestic, forever in my heart

The setting sun burns my eyes
Will this be my last or will I again see it rise?

Ancestral pride burns in me 
I am the king of the northern sea

A battle is raging soon to be won 
I raise my sword to Bur and Bestlas son 
Can't remember how many I have slain 
Then, all I feel is the burning pain

A fatal wound has appeared
But I'm not afraid it's nothing I feared

Ancestral pride burns in me      
I am now set forever free

Chilling winds caress my body 
The rain falls hard on my face
As I gaze up to the sky 
Clouds gather and thunder roars

Valkyries ride down to me 
Einherjer is what I'll be
I ride with them to the golden halls 
Deep within Asgards walls
