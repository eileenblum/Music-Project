[Music: Ablaze My Sorrow]
[Lyrics: K.Lonnsjo / A.Brorsson]
[Arrangement: S.Luckander / F.Larnemo]

The world seems to matter no more
I'm standing by the threshold to the door
Where death is waiting on the other side
Chained to the shore awaiting the coming tide

As the shining steel caresses me flesh
I depart on a journey beyond life and death
Domain of the damned is where I will dwell
I bid you welcome - welcome to hell
