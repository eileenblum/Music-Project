Slaves of fate mindless drones
Came out from the forbidden zone
Radio-active death-fanatics
Nuclear power in the midnight hour

Eyes are searching through the night
Scanning worlds with lazer sight
Call upon obliteration
Radiation, desolation

Mass destruction on earth
Through atomic rebirth
Chemical disease
Only death will increase

Death rays

Vacant planet, foreign calls
Soldiers rust for future wars
Killing sprees on unknown seas
Murder missions, inquisitions

Hypnotize the masses eyes
Take another human life
Trapped inside an evil maze
Far beyond time and space

Mass destruction on earth
Through atomic rebirth
Chemical disease
Only death will increase

Death rays
