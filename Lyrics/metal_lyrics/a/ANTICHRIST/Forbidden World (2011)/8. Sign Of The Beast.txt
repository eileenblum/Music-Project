Follow the call, await the command
Satan is watching over the holy land
An omen appeard in fornt of their eyes
Sign of the beast, obey him or die
Visions of sinner, pleasures of sin
Seed of the master, the hatred within

As they burn the church and
Cut the cross to the ground
Rituals in fire, the sign has been found
As they hang the priest and
Crush the town to the ground
Eyes in the skies, the sign they had found
On the ground all will lie

Terror
Swords you canât fight
Evil
Striking tonight
Blood
Marking the skies
Death
On the ground all will lie

Fear of the night
A curse sweeping the land
Screams of death
Phantoms awoke by the sign of the beast

As they burn the church and
Cut the cross to the ground
Rituals in fire, the sign has been found
As they hang the priest and
Crush the town to the ground
Eyes in the skies, the sign they had found

Terror
Swords you canât fight
Evil
Striking tonight
Blood
Marking the skies
Death
On the ground all will lie

Fear of the night
A curse sweeping the land
Screams of death
Phantoms awoke by the sign of the beast
Arose from hell
Ruling the land
Laughing with Satan
Killing
Under the sign of the beast

Burning red eyes,
They watch from every corner side to side
In silence they lie,
Hungry for the blood of the night

Sign of the beast

Under the sign of the beast
