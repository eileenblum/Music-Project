Cast the spells
Abomination
Evil rites
And celebration
On this night
Invoke the power
Gather around
A funeral pyre

Skies are filled
With spirits and plague
In chasms beneath they eternally dwell
Sent down in fire now burning in hell
Tormented screams marked by a spell

Now fall into the pits, down in the deep
Die by the spells of the dead
Scream, now itâs too late
Suffer your fate
Die by the spells of the dead

Burning sinner
Keep on burning

Skies are filled
With spirits and plague
In chasms beneath they eternally dwell
Sent down in fire now burning in hell
Tormented screams marked by a spell

Now fall into the pits, down in the deep
Die by the spells of the dead
Scream, now itâs too late
Suffer your fate
And die by the spells of the dead

Spells of the dead â on this wicked night
Spells of the dead
Spells of the dead â take away your life
Spells of the dead
Alright!

Cast the spells
Abomination
Evil rites
And celebration
On this night
Invoke the power

A funeral pyre

Now fall into the pits, down in the deep
Die by the spells of the dead

Suffer your fate
Die by the spells of the dead
