Raging for destruction, napalm burns the land
Savage screams of terror and murder on command
Kill the men and children, let the women serve as slaves
The troops of doom are coming to lay the land to waste

Youâre trapped and canât escape
Green hell holds your fate
Watch out â the militia of death
We have come to take your breath away

Militia of death
Revel in madness, I have gone insane
Violent screams of horror echoes in my brain
Killing for the pleasure, killing for the thrill
We will keep on killing till thereâs nothing left to kill

We attack, the order has been given
No turning back, leave no one alive
We attack, the order has been given
No turning back, you all shall die

Raging for destruction, napalm burns the land
Savage screams of terror and murder on command
Kill the men and children, let the women serve as slaves
The troops of doom are coming to lay the land to waste

Annihilation, bombing the docks
Vietcong combat shocks
We strike â the militia of death
We are here to take your breath away

Militia of death
