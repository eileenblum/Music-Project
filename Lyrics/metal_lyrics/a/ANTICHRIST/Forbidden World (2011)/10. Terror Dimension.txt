Striking from the past
A vision came at last
Leaving you with nightmares
Your life runs out so fast

You canât escape the horrors
Youâre trapped within the walls
Keeping you forever
Until your last breath calls

A world beyond ours
Calls out your name
To become the victim
Of their evil game
Give up your life
A final farewell
Deliver your soul
To the darkness of hell

A violent creation where reality is left behind
A journey through darkness, a journey into your mind

Enter the terror dimension

You canât avoid the shadows
The creatures of the night
They lurk in every corner
Inside your twisted mind

Blind your eyes with terror
Bring terror unto you
How long will you exist
When death shall be here soon

A world beyond ours
Calls out your name
To become a victim
Of their evil game
Give up your life
A final farewell
Deliver yourself
To the darkness of hell

A violent creation where reality is left behind
A journey through darkness, a journey into your mind

Enter the terror dimension

Tonight you travel with oblivion as guide
On through aeons of death you ride
What lies beyond the endless terror
When you reach the other side
