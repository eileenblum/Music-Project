In the fading glow of the final twilight
I sense the coming of undying evil
For aeons brooding in timeless silence
Soon the radiant darkness will hatch
Awaiting the ultimate night to arrive
Mankind is fettered and held, in cold suspense
Gathering shadows of the holocaust
He has entered into the realm of the living

I am the vessel, I am the sentinel
I know the prophecy must be fulfilled

Usurpers of the throne
Descending from the stars
from beyond the gate of Yog-Sothoth

Messenger of death proclaims their arrival
Reciting the words from the book of Azathoth
The rapture will come without salvation
The abolishment of physical laws
I sense the presence of unworldly forces
A phosphorus horror eating the land
Seething nuclear chaos, boiling sea of death
Ascend ancient city from beneath the waves

I am the key, he is the gate
A mystical voyage has only begun

The future is grim, shrouded in death
The world that we know - fruitless and bleak
One thousand masks obscuring his face
Swept by the black wind into the abyss

I am the vessel, I am the sentinel
I know the prophecy must be fulfilled
I am the key, he is the gate
