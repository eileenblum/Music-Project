The magic hour is here at last
Spirit rise in spectral flight
Ethereal presence in midnight winds
There is no rest even in death

Empty vessel must be found
Human host shall be bound
Parasite of unwary souls
Wicked power takes control

Wailing cries from the graveyard at night
Can you hear the lamentations of the dead

Temple conquered by demon fiend
Fleshless ghoul never redeemed
Doomed room the realms beyond
It returns to steal your breath

To revert from amorphous existence
Incarnation, the final deliverance

There is only one purpose in ageless oblivion
Biding time - wait for the gate to appear

In this moment the passage is complete
What was you now never will be again

Perverted into an injurious sinner
Morbid blood flows inside the shell
Your soul has been banished forever to dwell
But the body lives on infested by darkness
Infernal intentions now master your mind
Sucumb to the godless, malefic desires
Planted there by a malevolent force

Hidden in a world of obscurity
Cast into the incromprehensible void
drowning into the impious sea of nothingness
The mysterious eternity revealed
Your plaint of sorrow cannot be heard
The gate is closed, you belong to the shadows of death
