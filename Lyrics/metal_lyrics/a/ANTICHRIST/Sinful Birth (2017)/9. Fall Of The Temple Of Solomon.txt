Prophecies of chaos, misery and pain
Time of desolation arrives
The kingdom of Judah to be destroyed
In the scrolls of Jeremiah

Armies of warriors from Babylon march
The king commands the temple's defeat
Pillage the heart of Jerusalem
Leave suffering and death on the streets

Hekhal Shlomo
Under attack

Terrible screams
Echoes through the night
Behold the wicked skies
The temple turns to dust
Fall of the Temple of Solomon

Brimful of passion, hatred and lust
Like Asakku demons screaming for blood
The children of Abraham praying for death
The bell of Jehova will crack

On the seventh day of Av destruction began
The surrounding city walls began to breach
Blood ran from the blade of Nebuzaradan
Massacred until there were none left alive!

Hekhal Shlomo
Under attack

Terrible screams
Echoes through the night
Behold the wicked skies
The temple turns to dust
Fall of the Temple of Solomon

Hekhal Shlomo
Under attack

Terrible screams
Echoes through the night
Behold the wicked skies
The temple turns to dust
Fall of the Temple of Solomon
