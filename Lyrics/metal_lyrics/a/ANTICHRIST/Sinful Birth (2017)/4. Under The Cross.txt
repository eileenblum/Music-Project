In the night he returns
To claim their souls to be burned
With his scepter and his eyes
Evoke the graves of those who died

Reanimated from their tombs
Enslave them all in hateful gloom
Hear the words of his command
Behold the power within his hands

Bewitched with a fiery web
Death shall not be the end
Through dimensions unknown to man
he leads the corpses to his land

Possession - of their minds
Soul abduction - into the burning jaws of hell

Tormented screams dwells in the deep
Beyond the door of final sleep
The laughing fate of tyranny
Slaves for all eternity

Under the cross of Baphomet,
his kingdom they will serve
In the heart of an infernal maze
Hear the trumpets of the damned,
obey the endless wrath
Of the destroyer of rest and of mind
Imprisoned in another world
where god is held in chains
In the abyss of the heretic
Forced to fall into the depths
Of fire and of black
At the sharp edge of no coming back
Oppressor of the undead,
dictator of the night
Ruler in the vast realms of time
Slaves under the pentagram,
now kneel towards the throne
Preachers of heaven, now servants in hell
