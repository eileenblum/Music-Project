The melting of skin
An unspeakable death
Reacting in horror
They're soon out of breath
Victims of arson
Dying in fire
Maliciously burning
Sadistic desire

Lack of compassion
Atrocious assault
Inhumane nature
Kill and exalt
Action of terror
He laughs as they cry
Bodies ablaze
Expire and die

Repulsive behavior
He laughs as they scream
Acting in evil
A mischievous scheme
Aiming to harm
To kill and torment
He'll do it again
With vicious intent

Vindictive presentment
Crushing existence
Merciless games
With cruel decisions
The arsonist trembles
Devastating scene
This living nightmare Could not be foreseen

Burned beyond recognition
Left to die in critical condition

Children scream, a cry of death
Slowly burning, melting away

Extermination
By conflagration
The haunting results
Of this operation
Nowhere to turn
They have reached their impasse
Scrapping their bodies
And drape them in gas

Trapped in the flames
Blood boils in their veins
Fragments of bones
Mortal remains
Reduce them to ashes
The smell of cremation
Transform them to dust
Through incineration

Burned beyond recognition
Left to die in critical condition

Skin is turning black
And blood is pouring from the face
Flesh is peeling off the corpse,
They slowly burn to death
Buried in Inferno
In the most unpleasant ways ...
... they die!
