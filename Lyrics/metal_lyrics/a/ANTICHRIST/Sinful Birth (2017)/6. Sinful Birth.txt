Deep within the convent walls
Blood stains from her torn up cunt
Cries are heard of pain and fear
Birth of sin is drawing near
Night appears with evil host
Calling for the exorcist
Nuns are praying while she screams
Satan's child inside her breeds

Raped and tortured by the priest
Before he tried to kill himself
The Devil took his hallowed soul
And used it as a puppet doll

Behind the cross, a door of Hell
Spectral powers, floods of rage
Ravaging shade in darkness dwell
Into the Devil's hands she fell

Twisted evil brood
Dwells inside her womb
In their holy shrine
Birth of Satan's child

Sinful birth

Deep inside their soul they know
Satan's power will only grow
Still in denial they kneel and pray
Betray themselves till death's day

Nightmare in the whorehouse of God
Soon shall be a dark and horrid memory
Corrupted by the demon of outmost malignancy
Death can be her only solitude

Sinful birth

Plant the evil seed
On her soul it feeds
Murder from within
Kill the nun of sin

Abused by the priest, possessed by the Devil
Betrayed by her sisters, deserted by God

Behind the cross, a door of Hell
Spectral powers, floods of rage
Ravaging shade in darkness dwell
Into the Devil's hands she fell

Demonic growth within her uterus
Reversed oppression of the holy cross
Fertilization of sinful heresy
Traumatic molestation in hateful blasphemy
