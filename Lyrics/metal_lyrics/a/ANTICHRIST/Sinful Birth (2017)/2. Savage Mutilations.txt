Beneath the darkened cloak of nightfall
Insanity reveals
The embryo of senseless horrors
Breeds behind their eyes
Under the moon a growning lust
A hunger starts to rise
A satanic need to stalk and kill
In shelter of the night

A violent end of tragic life, a sacrificial gift
The demon owns her tortured soul
The torment never stops

A twisted sexual desire
To slit a tender throat
And to feel the life escape the body
As death takes his freezing hold
Raise the shining sword of conquest
The mutilator's blade
Her lifeblood runs in rivers
As she dies on the altar of ail

Savagely killed as a sacrament of blood
Revel in the treasures of the flesh
Below the eyes of a mournful god
Exploring the ultimate pleasures of death

Beyond the door of Satan's house
Rituals of death proceed
The Devil holds their certain fate
Controls their wicked needs

Minds are warped by the presenceof the fallen one
He will never let them go
She knows too well the meaning of pain
And now her anguish will only grow

They cannot resist, the hunger is too strong
This seems the only solution
But never enough, prowling the streets again
Obscured by the shadows
They hunt for the weak, the lonely and lost
In the aphotic abyss of the city
From twilight till dawn, but then they are gone
But soon to return again

She felt the shapeless darkness
In the eyes of the disturbed
In the flowing river of blood
Her fate eternally was sealed

Life after life they offer to him
Their master still beckons for more
His voice can be heard in the silence of night
His thirst will never be quenched

Savage mutilations
The nightmare is no dream at all
Victim of Lucifer's work
Her faith is of no avail
The cry of a prostitute
Slaughtered like a helpless lamb
Savage mutilations
