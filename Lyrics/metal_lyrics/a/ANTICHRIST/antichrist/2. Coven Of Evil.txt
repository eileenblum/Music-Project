In the night, witches amass
coven of evil
sacrifice their eternal soul
to the fallen angel
drink their blood
a black magic spell is cast
from the mist
you hear them call
Coven of Evil
Midnight, the blood is shed
A ritual killing
Sacrifice, the altar runs red
And the shadows grow taller
Evil spirits join us now
on this eve of damnation
satans fire spreads across the earth, total desolation
drink their blood
a black magic spell is cast
from the mist
you hear them call
coven of evil
n the night, witches amass
coven of evil
sacrifice their eternal soul
to the fallen angel
drink their blood
a black magic spell is cast
from the mist
you hear them call
