We are the hungry wolves hunting in the night
Stalking our prey with burning eyes
Jaws of fire, awful sight
Steel inferno, unholy delight

Crusades from hell run on the plains
Through the cities, along the lanes
Cruel beasts is what they say
Human souls is what we crave
Frightened victims on the run
Evil horde, four born sons
Teeth to bones, swords to throats
Share the blood for our master below

Tormentor
Tormentor
Torment me

Tormentor
Tormentor
Torment in hell

Fear us, weâre the antichrist
Carrying the number 666
Satisfy our hunger from left to right
The price you pay is your own life

Tormentor
Tormentor
Torment me

Tormentor
Tormentor
Torment in hell
