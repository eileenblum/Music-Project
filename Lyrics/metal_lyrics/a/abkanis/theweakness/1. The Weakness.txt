[Music and Lyrics Talo, Nelson]

the sociability obey,
this was a shit
sociality forget
are weak-minded!

usurpers of consciousness!

the sociability obey,
this was a shit
sociality forget
are weak-minded!

war!
the government is...
war!

I feel the voice of, conscience!
we have the eyes closed, for pleasure!
