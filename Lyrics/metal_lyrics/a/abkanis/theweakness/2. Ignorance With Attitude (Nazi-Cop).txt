[Music and Lyrics Talo]

You run again, At a crossroads!
Never stop, still fighting!
For equality, total anarchy!
Living what the tv never show !

Kids police, bred to kill!
Caring for the pocket of big business!
The country emerged, thanks to the worker
And yet ... The police is still winning

(Die! Nazi-cop!)

They say exist to help!
They say exist to protect!
His only contribution is the repression!
Against a society that is already about to explode!

Offenders in uniform!
Convicted of a flag
A people imprisoned
Ignorance with Attitude
