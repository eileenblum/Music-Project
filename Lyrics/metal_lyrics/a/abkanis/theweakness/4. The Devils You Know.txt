[Music and Lyrics Talo]

I invoke the evil horror
I demand your supreme power
Ancient gods, of lighting
Genocidal unconscious!

In the lighting! The lighting is so cruel
my schizophrenia is the rainbow to the gods
into the darkness, my life is much better
and if the darkness is the light of my life?

My conscience is tainted
For all the sin that I thought
The birth of, my paradise,
Ravens fed of my soul
