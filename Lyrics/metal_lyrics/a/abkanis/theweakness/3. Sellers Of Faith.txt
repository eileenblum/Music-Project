[Music by Talo, Nelson Lyrics Raul, Talo]

A lump in the throat, convicted of faith, your fear is my money
Corrupt hypocrites, murderers of God, in robes stained with blood
Liars thieves, blinding people, influenced by an unreal book
Sweeping of innocence, pedophiles unpunished, false prophets of god

Seller of faith, play with precious
Seller of faith, i will refuse

Political saints, pedophiles hiding behind a cross
Billionaires hit men, pigs bathing in gold
Worse than Satan, disabling our consciousness
Lustful, greedy! Lazy, full of ignorance

Vanity of shit compared to Jesus, they want to be like God
Pornography death, disgrace apathy, upsetting our minds with verses
We are the sons of the six six six, we buy our paradise
Catholic-evangelical, Mormon or witness, at the end everyone is equal

Seller of faith, play with precious
Seller of faith, i will refuse
