I learned to swim in a river my Daddy taught me to fish
When I get down, I drank that old whiskey best believe all them fools seein' how I live
I'm grown, and own a new mantra sun set another day for me to bleed
I guess I'll keep on a running beats the fuck out of watching the hard-headed breed

Well let me tell you friends we're burning through the night again
I feel the change, it cant be long The Dixie Fight Song
