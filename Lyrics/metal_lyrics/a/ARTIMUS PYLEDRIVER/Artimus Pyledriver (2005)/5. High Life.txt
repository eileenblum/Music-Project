Well I feel it on a Friday Lord its creeping up deep inside.
Now when I think about the high life and how we lost our mind.
It's not the feeling of a chemical she still do me real good.
It's a beautiful experience when we hit the woods.
Back into the high life get back, get back

Got a cooler and a green bag a tent built for two.
Old lady and my good friends getting high in that dew.
Way down by the river bank catch the action of the day.
Everybody feeling all right rolling with the waves.
Back into the high life get back, get back

Well wind is a rushing Lord, old sun's going down.
Back into the clearing going to pass a few around.
Got a transistor radio going to be here a while.
Raising hell in the darkness no one for a country mile.
Back into the high life get back, get back
