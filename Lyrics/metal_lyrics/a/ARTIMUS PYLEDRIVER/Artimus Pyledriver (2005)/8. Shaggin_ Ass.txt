All the fucking powers corroded well listen, done gave up on my kin.
And the failure, she so mobile going to get the best of him
Well little sister, eroded the cycle spins again.
The train, she rolling see you at the end.

Done ain't I glad you beat me.
Well I'm broken, ain't got a god damn thing.
Well I'm content, with nothing still gave up on the fucking dream
I find a way to escape break in that change friend.
Now the train she rolling see you at the end.
