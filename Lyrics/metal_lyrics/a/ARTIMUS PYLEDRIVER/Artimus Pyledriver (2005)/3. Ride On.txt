Heading out, going to get the fire again pan head, rolling toward the ocean,
Loud pipes, whiskey, and a cold beer Lord if there's a heaven
I done found it here well them outlaws make the rules real clear.
It's a code of life them boys got here
Ride on, get gone ride on, get yourself gone

Scalded dog, keeping the night alive can't catch them boys Lord now, to save you life.
Hell bent on riding 'till the road ends going down that highway and back again.
It's a code of life them boys got here
Ride on, get gone ride on, get yourself gone
