Black water, Lord don't you scare me I embrace all the tranquility
Night fishing under the southern sky I feel the north wind I hear the earth sigh
White lightning drink of the southern man Lord knows I never get enough of them
Be hard pressed to find a working man living for his time, well he's god damned
Gone up the creek you all ain't going to find me
I be by myself I live for no one else

My footsteps of vindication, my life bleeds stimulation
My soul, is the driving force, of these limited times
I make this life mine feel the water rush, I feel the moon rise
Cast the line, look up into the sky isolated from the chains of modern man
Look at your life it's a fucking sham
Gone up the creek you all ain't going to find me
I be by myself I live for no one else

Black water, Lord don't you scare me I embrace all the tranquility
Night fishing under the southern sky I feel the north wind I hear the earth sigh
White lightning drink of the southern man Lord knows I never get enough of them
Be hard pressed to find a working man living for his time, well he's god damned
Gone up the creek you all ain't going to find me
I be by myself I live for no one else
