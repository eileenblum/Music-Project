We rode hard from the South eastern plains right through the hills of Appalachia.
Haven't seen the sky so blue in days I miss the gold sun rays.
With the state line in our site now you know I'm feeling right.
Get back to where you from come on get some.

Lord knows I want to be at home darkness like it's one long night.
I watch the boy he's growing on be a man before you know
With the state line in our sight now you know I'm feeling right.
Better get back to where you're from come on get some.
