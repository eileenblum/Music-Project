Done found myself a lady she treat me just so fine.
When I get home at night from working she rub me down, let me unwind.
She's my dirt road white girl, roots and all.
Come on baby doll, just give me a call.
She's my dirt road white girl, all I need.
Down with her man, that's fine with me.

Going to find a way to make her all mine.
Four wheels on my pick up truck pumping Texas boogie be just fine.
She's my dirt road white girl, roots and all.
Come on baby doll, just give me a call.
She's my dirt road white girl, all I need.
Down with her man, that's fine with me.
