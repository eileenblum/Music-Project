Well I was born in that cabbage patch out by the free-way.
By god that Grady Baby, that's what they call me.
Home's that stretch of road, old Atlanta highway.
Live down South with them backwood hill billies.
Well you want to talk Southern, son don't even try.
Well you want to talk fishing I'll meet you down by the riverside.

Too many times I find myself far from home.
Thank god there's a place these Southern boys will roam.
You'll can have that city, you'll can be in a rush,
I'll be spinning on whiskey hiding in that bush.
Well you want to talk Southern, son don't even try.
Well you want to talk fishing I'll meet you down by the riverside.
