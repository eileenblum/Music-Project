From hells heart it is him 
Evening star Lucifer, the light 
Bringing strife and division 
And a hatred of mankind 

Blood vapour a mist upon the land 
Tears boil in hellfire 
Prayers to heaven, stopped by sword 
Serpent shadow across the land 

Centuries old stories of paradise lost 
Rewritten by cloven hoof 
A prophecy now reality 
Eclipsed â the setting sun 

Blood vapour a mist upon the land 
Tears boil in hellfire 
Prayers to heaven, stopped by sword 
Serpent shadow across the land 

Serpent shadow across the land 
A prophecy â the setting sun 
A mist across the land 

From hells heart it is him 
Evening star Lucifer, the light 
Bringing strife and division 
And a hatred of mankind 

Blood vapour a mist upon the land 
Tears boil in hellfire 
Prayers to heaven, stopped by sword 
Serpent shadow across the land
