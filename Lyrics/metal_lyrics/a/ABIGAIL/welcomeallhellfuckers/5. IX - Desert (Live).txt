[Bulldozer cover]

The army always pretended to take
The men to subject to their rule
The law and the policy always denied freedom
You've got no choice
You cannot refuse you cannot escape
'cause jail knocks at your door
They won't wait a minute handcuffs are ready
And a cell is waiting for you

Don't serve the army - bastards
They'll lose the war - we don't care
Don't love your country - it kills you
Try to survive - desert!

The national hymn has been badly composed
For the crowd of the idiots and turds
It sounds disgusting it makes me feel
Ashamed to be born in this land
But if i think outside it's the same
I'm also ashamed to be a man
Slave of my country slave of the world
I'd better cut off my balls

Don't serve the army - bastards
They'll lose the war - we don't care
Don't love your country - it kills you
Try to survive - desert!
