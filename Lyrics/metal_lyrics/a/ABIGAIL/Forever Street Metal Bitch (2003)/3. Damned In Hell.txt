They curse the day when I was born
You can keep your sympathy
I'm not gonna take it lyin' down
I'll kill tonight

Damned in hell
Tonight I'll fight

They want more violence
Screaming confusion
So give me all the powers of Hell
More death heat me up

To get power
Shots rip the air
Raise the knife
Burning Fire
