I am bastard evil angel
Worship blood and fire
Now you doing, slow and terrifying, really band fell
Fighting beating nothing holds the storm
Die die die

Charge!

I love the dead, Satan's revenge
Let the deadly game begin
I'm standin' proud, I'm shot on your thacks
Screaming to fuckers
Fighting beating nothing holds storm
Die die die
