Blood sworn oath under
Clouds of dark sky
Bestial fire, bestial scorn
Spirit soars bursting hate

Confound eternal
Vanquished gods asunder
Winds torment the mankind
In conflict and death
(Oh, in conflict and death)

Serpent gaze like starlight
At new moon of harvest
Loosed, the enemy of peace
Sky split by thunder roar...

Sacred writings desecrate
Cold blood of dead courage
Unholy excommunicate
The deathless destiny
