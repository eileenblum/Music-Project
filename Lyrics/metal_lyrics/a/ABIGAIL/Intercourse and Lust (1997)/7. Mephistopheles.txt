Cold nasty, Tear laugh, Wired laugh
Ask a persons help, world rule
Woman temptation, rape, kill
Emperor over the river suppy to both

Mephistopheles you're my pride in hell

There is not border in hell
We are going to found in hell
Confusion of people and fallen in hell
Exceed of Satan, marvelous evil
