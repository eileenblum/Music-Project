November horizon twilight
Glow red with war-star
Spirit of ages rebirthed
Finding fire and no speak

On rocks and shoals of Blood Sea
A fortress of unrighteousness...
Moonrise dance invoke frenzy
Full face shadow cast

Twisted oath find favor
And praise by legion sons
Mocking cries rise to cloud tops
Their mass celebrate no second...
Coming!

Strength of other world
Faith of other world
The winged serpent regal
Wrapped clock shroud darkness

Spirit of ages rebirthed
Finding fire and no spark
Wrapped cloak shroud darkness
Strength of other world...
