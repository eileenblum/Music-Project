Thrash 'til die
To glory of attack
Attack with spell
In my attack

Bleeded blood burst out
On alter of pure hell
Chimed bell rise clear
Moon squalls dying blood

The horror infernal of damned earth
Flight in night light shadows forward
Following the masters example
Death soldier hided nots

Sorcerers words drift unto twilight dawn
I curse creed and dawn light of heaven

Buried under cross of good
Cenotaph of bloodspots manifest
Power of hell and pit lord-I rise
Now god loose control

Invert good and great victory
Call to him a palace flame
My spirit burn in distant skyline
Now god loose control...
