Metal warriors lose your mind
Stab your back when you look behind
Evil metal has no control
You'll soon be free,
You'll soon see

Metal evil metal
Burning your heart
Metal evil metal
Keep on burning

After the metal war, the world is so still
No poser is living after kill
Over the burning hell life will go on
Blazing up to the sky

Metal evil metal
Burning your heart
Metal evil metal
Keep on burning
