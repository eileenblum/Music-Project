Black metal is the way
Defend the faith everyday
If you come here to metal
Let me hear your scream and shout

Death to the false metal
Burn! Power and damnation

Don't be afraid of your own feelings
Let out a scream if it makes you feel good
Just close eyes and get into the metal

Death to the false metal
Burn! Power and damnation
