Bitch is waiting to kiss my lips
But she will wait for my war
Blood and death are waiting
She now is free to pleasure

Dance on pentagram
Queens of metal bitch

Wild fire metal bitch

Bitch be my slave
That's your reason to live
Kill their servants
Till there's no blood left to spill

Dance on pentagram
Kings of metal bitch

Wild fire metal bitch
