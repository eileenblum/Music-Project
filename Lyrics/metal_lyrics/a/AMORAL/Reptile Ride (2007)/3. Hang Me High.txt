Can't afford the cost of a life
That would get lost
There won't be another round
As we're rising up to relevance
Or whatever the circumstance
It has no right to go on

It's on now!

I'm not about to disagree
we are all fixed
Feel free, blame it on me
Am I a masochist?
Fuck yes if this is it!
Passed the deadline
Still working on it like a bitch!

When they try to scapegoat me
When I become their property
Make sure they hang me high
No need to crucify
Just hang me high
