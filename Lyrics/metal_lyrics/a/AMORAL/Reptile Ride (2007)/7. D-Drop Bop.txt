Bring me the one
The one who got all this done
The starter of this downward spiral which begun while I was gone
Three shots of revolution, give it three shots to get it roll
To keep this crazy train on rails I'm ready to give my all

INJECT! INFECT! ME!
Infect me with your soul disease
Take all that's mine that's pure
that's of any worth
and do with it as you please!

INJECT! INFECT! ME!
Inject your black into these arms that refuse to bleed
Cannot slow down the progress
Can't force it all to stay the same
The future is on fire and we're the ones feeding the flame

Three shots of revolution, give it three shots to get it roll
And if we crash and burn, so be it then, I'll take the fall

WE WANT THIS PLACE DOWN!
Don't be afraid, you'll be remembered for this day

WE WANT THIS PLACE DOWN!
Come what may, the d-drop bop will lead the way
