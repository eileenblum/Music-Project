Cheated and seized when in rapture.
Observed tortured and siposed of when dead.
To posses against will, be it words or distorted display of behavior: little did I fucking know.

So they are out of control
And they are out for some more

Spasm cult, tongue of feet cold, and their void's fulfilled through assertions, to explain the worthlessness in which they so noble dwell.

[Chorus:]
And now... my spit turned to rape seen.

They'll strap me down.
Exposing me to the shattered face of humanity. Through no efforts I'm now part of this profanity.

[Chorus]
