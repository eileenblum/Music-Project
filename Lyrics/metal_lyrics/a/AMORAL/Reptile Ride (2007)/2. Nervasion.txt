I sense an intruder and my
Nerves are aching
Something is grinding against them

Teeth gone gray
Eyes bloodshot by the end of the day
Looks like I could kill
In this case of

Nervasion!
The hardest working
Builds it up inside

Grin that is set to unclear and disturbed
Should I turn bitter
Or spread it on thick
Small scale invasion
That's making me a wreck
A hostile psycho with nails in your neck

Teeth gone gray
Eyes bloodshot by the end of the day
Looks like I could kill
In this case of

Nervasion!
The hardest working
Builds it up inside
