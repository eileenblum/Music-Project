Fuck!
Somebody knows where I live
Since when has it been in a hide?
To live in fear is to lure out menace
And I rather earn the lesson to learn

Some things found and collected
Swaloows the shattered grin of yours

Limbless provocative struggling ever active
Empty sockets still filled with visions
Limbless provocative skinned and sold for dog meat
A longer reach enticing, truly a break

I swear, now I'm paralyzed
And this is when we start to amputate

Never even close to blind
Never to face the grind
Leave your dead behind

Breathing from the vein

This
Isn't it wrong for you?
Swallow the shattered grin to keep it for good
I'd leave your dead behind
