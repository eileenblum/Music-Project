Go - and leave yourself behind
Pride - a useless state of mind
On your knees, hands to the heavens
Tear it down, start again, make it last this time

It will not be easy
Most likely you'll never succeed
The fall of all that's to be
Not for all but for one

A view to put things to perspective
Not pleasant but surely effective
Where to go with the wishes rejected
Lies defected, despair injected

Barking through life, leaving biting for others
Oblivious to the filth that it gathers
Pushed and delayed and now it's too late
Take a deep good look in the eyes of your fate, as it says

Done - this one is done
White knuckled fists give us the guilty ones
Don't - don't you tread on me
This one was simply not to be

A view to put things to perspective
Not pleasant but surely effective
Where to go with the wishes rejected
Lies defected, despair injected

Barking through life, leaving biting for others
Oblivious to the filth that it gathers
Pushed and delayed and now it's too late
Take a deep good look in the eyes of your fate, as it says

Done - this one is done
White knuckled fists give us the guilty ones
Don't - don't you tread on me
This one was simply not to be

To come out from the other side with no regrets
To feel that these scars belong to someone else
To still be standing when you're hearing the bells
Un-fucking-likely
