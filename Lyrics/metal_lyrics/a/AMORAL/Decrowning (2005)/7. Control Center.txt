I cut your wings
The moment you think that you cannot fly
Smother my habitat
Foment the thoughts of my demise

Seems like we've met before
You may not know me but I know you
Pretence paradox
Fault of purpose amputee

Am I your enemy or what?
I attack from inside
When I rule there are no principles
But I know where they lie
Keep your hands out of this
An untouchable progress has begun

Control cancer
Inside you
I watch your struggle
Control cancer
Inside you
I make a strike

Decadent vision controls my life
And the vision is your very self
Immortal life form
Nesting in a mortal shell

I am the excess you try to skim
But you retake us the on the sly
For rejecting me
You're shaking your halo

The drill of reason
Reaching your temple
Insecure and weak
You cut the tongue that digs my eyes
Am I your enemy or what?
I attack from inside

Control cancer
Inside you
I watch your struggle
Control cancer
Inside you
I make a strike

We shall retake our existence
