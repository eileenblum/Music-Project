When you lose the first round
You call yourself reborn
Do you know what you do
If you can't understand what it will gain?
A point blank refusal of forgiveness
For deliberate indifference

Injury self-inflicted

Your face is covered
Still I know you're alive
There's an alien in your mind
And the haven is harder to find
Perfectly supreme
I'm your frequent despair

See how fast I take your place, your form
I will prevail
I will remain
Actuating something that's always been there
Presence outshined
You've been made disabled

Try to run from what's within

Your face is covered
Still I know you're alive
There's an alien in your mind
And the haven is harder to find
Perfectly supreme
I'm your frequent despair
