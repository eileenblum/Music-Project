Running out of solutions
Conscious or carried away?
Classify, separate, codify - hear dismay
Atomize, aggregate, rearrange - fear the fate

Invasion and spiritual penetration

Awaken on the edge of unjustified suspicion
Is the alteration possible with no demolition?
Deadbeat and shivering, approaching the next period
The delusion that liberation is drawing near

Mind-set euthanasia
Arise out of impulse

Mental suicide
Exertion beyond intensity

With open arms adopting the true desperation
Affected system towards the new adoring face
Another victim of a synthetic evocation
A cry of relief sealing the disgrace
