I think today might be the day
We'll see it all go down
Jesters taking over
Kings separated from their crowns
And if that is the case
I'll join the crowd, lead the parade
Look back nine years from now
And see the damage that we've made

For those still by my side - it will not go unnoticed
For those against me - your name is ailing

I think today might be the day
We'll see it all go down
Jesters taking over
Kings separated from their crowns
And if that is the case
I'll join the crowd, lead the parade
Look back nine years from now
And see the damage that we've made

For those still by my side - it will not go unnoticed
For those against me - your name is ailing

No, don't tell me it's
The thought that counts
That saying is for those
Who misfired each one of their rounds
Now mark my words
I'll raise the bar
I'll walk the mile
I've just begun

For those still by my side - it will not go unnoticed
For those against me - your name is ailing
