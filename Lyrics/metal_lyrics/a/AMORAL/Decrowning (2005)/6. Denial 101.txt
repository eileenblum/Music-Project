You win the prize for being the first one
I wash the blisters off my hands
Because and in spite of this breed
Nothing remains excluded
No difficult choices made
The silence, the silence will reach you

Tempted by your core
Cease to be, cease to live
Tempted by your core
Devoted to peel - denying to feel

Exit granted
Feel the tension
Now step out of this dimension
Inwards growing intention

A state of mind one could envy
Lick up the pressure that I have shed

Hate defends
Hate repels
Hate prevents
Hate demands less

Everything sinking through the skin of your feet
While standing on the splinters of your past
Serving you fate or serving your will?
Not that it ever made a difference
For you are and will endure ill

Tempted by your core
Cease to be, cease to live
Tempted by your core
Devoted to peel - denying to feel

Exit granted
Feel the tension
Now step out of this dimension
Inwards growing intention

A state of mind one could envy
Lick up the pressure that I have shed

Hate defends
Hate repels
Hate prevents
Hate demands less

When did you creep to me?
I live to recognize
Why don't you figure out
By yourself why to run away

You better keep on hiding
'Cos you'll be fucked if you start to run
Here's the line, give it a go
This bridge is flammable

A state of mind one could envy
Lick up the pressure that I have shed

Hate defends
Hate repels
Hate prevents
Hate demands less
