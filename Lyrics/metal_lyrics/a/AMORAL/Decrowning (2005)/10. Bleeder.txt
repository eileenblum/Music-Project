Burning a hole in the back of my neck
It will always come back to this
For a second I looked away
And it got the job done
I say that I understand
But I'm not sure that I do
If I only could have those few minutes back...

We're the ones who made it happen
I alone made it all come down
The point of no return
Is purifying

Retrospecting for all the wrong reasons
Pointing fingers to numb out the pain
Distorting the truth
With a good dose of make-belief
I will have to live with this
For the rest of my life
And that will take me to my grave

We're the ones who made it happen
I alone made it all come down
The point of no return
It's purifying
