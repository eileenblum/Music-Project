Thereâs a bridge not far from here
I tend to cross from time to time
A secret pathway I hold dear
it leads me to the other side
I keep these visits for myself
I guess itâs hard to understand
Not a choice anymore, itâs out of my hands

And yet again I can hear her voice calling me...

Everything that I know to be real is in you
Why I left when I did, that mistake I canât undo
Give me a few second chances
let me start this all anew
All thatâs real is in you

Staring down the void teared by the years
I was away
it looks eternal, all-consuming
way too much for any man to bear

Staring down the void teared by the years
I was away
itâs ever-deep I know
but hell if I donât patch it
with that once was there

Staring down the void...
Staring down the void...

Everything that I know to be real is in you
Why I left when I did, that mistake I canât undo
Give me a few second chances,
let me start this all anew
Everything that I know to be real is you

Everything that I know to be real is in you
Why I left when I did, that mistake I canât undo
Give me a few second chances,
let me start this all anew
All thatâs real is you

All I know to be real is you
