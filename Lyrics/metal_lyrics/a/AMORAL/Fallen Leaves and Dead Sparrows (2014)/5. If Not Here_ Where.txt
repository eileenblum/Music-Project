Ainât seen the blue sky in who knows how long
still Iâm searching for shade
As I lay down, my head on a stone
Taking in the price I paid

Met an old man, saw fear in his eyes
His words still ring in my head
I shouldâve listened, I couldâve at least tried
but chose to turn my back instead

Bring out the sun, paint with light
Bring out the sun, make it right

âThis place is not for you
It never was, but that you knew
Things will never be the sameâ

âIf all you loved has changed
If all the good seems gone
youâve only got yourself to blameâ

Home â look elsewhere
Help â none here
Hope â itâs all gone
Faith - try fear

Words are worthless, acts define
You keep staring at the spaces between the lines
A lost child who thinks heâs running away
Ha! Youâre barely existing

All that remain are stories
scenes played out in a daydream
All that have cared now mourning
trying to set you free

Trace your steps all you want
it wonât take you back
Instead of the third act a fade to black
From the ashes of pride a scar is born
Nothing left from the roses now but the thorns

Getting close now, I can feel it
Soon Iâll reclaim control
The thing I fear most is to lose it all

All that remain are stories
scenes played out in a daydream
All that have cared now mourning
trying to set you free

All that remain are stories
scenes played out in a daydream
All that have cared now mourning
trying to set you free

This place is not for me
It never was, that now I finally see
Things can never be the same again

Everything I ever loved has changed
And all I saw as good seems now long gone
And thereâs no-one left but myself to blame
