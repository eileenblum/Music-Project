The sunâs coming down, and Iâm still sleeping
No crossed over words or lines
in this list that Iâm keeping
To blame it on time, prime reason for falling
Insist that it flies
when itâs you whoâs been crawling

Tied âem down to prolong a stay
If only for one more day
Pushing them all away

No shackle or iron chain
Immune to this kind of strain
Caved under a tide of pain

Nails now long gone, red and ivory
How I wish that youâd reach out for me
Shadow rising, staring down at me calling

A study of minds of those most persistent
Cut someone deep enough to prove I existed
A blink of an eye, there, now I missed it
Fifteen turned twenty-nine
despite my attempts to resist it

Tied âem down to prolong a stay
If only for one more day
Pushing them all away

No shackle or iron chain
Immune to this kind of strain
Caved under a tide of pain
