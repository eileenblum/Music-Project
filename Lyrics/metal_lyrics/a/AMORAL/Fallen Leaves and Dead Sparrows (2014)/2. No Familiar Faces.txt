Another hallway, staring at the door
Itâs been a while now but Iâve been here before

The marks are there still itâs not quite the same
If this is it why donât I recognize the name?

The wind brings a warning, misses ear by a mile
Shadows make it all worthwhile
Like a flood all returning, most with a smile
Helping to make it worthwhile

Come out come out now, yeah the jokeâs on me
Can we please go back now to the way things used to be?

A useless search for a familiar face
Not a single one found from this place

The wind brings a warning, misses ear by a mile
Shadows make it all worthwhile
Like a flood all returning, most with a smile
Helping to make it worthwhile
