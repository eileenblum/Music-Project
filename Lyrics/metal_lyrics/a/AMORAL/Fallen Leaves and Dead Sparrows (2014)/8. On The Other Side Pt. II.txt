Eyes
Donât lie to me
I know itâs there
It has to be

Eyes
Why canât I see
My way away
Away from here

Fallen leaves, mistake for dead sparrows
No more purpose in a turn of a stone
The road to ruin paved uneven and narrow
For the journeyâs to be taken alone
This is now shelter
This is now home

Unconditional love, what a fool I mustâve been
Blind faith, infinite trust are to blame
for this mess that Iâm in
Walls tilting forward
Air getting thin

Mirror the reason why all is not well
Eternal wild meadows turned into a cell

I waited, wasted all this time
Aching for, wanting more

Awaken, the blindfoldâs off my eyes
Forgotten souls were built to fall

Old lover with a dagger
a black widow dressed in white
Weakened by my wounds I stagger
trying to crawl into the light

Youâll apply the pressure
keep my fingers from the cuts
Hold me here with you forever
staring out the windows shut

âLay right here in my arms
rest your head for a while
To be real is to hurt
to stay here is to dieâ

I waited, wasted all this time
Aching for, wanting more

Awaken, the blindfoldâs off my eyes
Forgotten souls were built to fall

See my dreams unchained, undone
See all clear, all right, all gone
See my dreams undone
See all clear, all gone
