Hey, itâs good to see you again
All those moons, itâs been a while
Wait, I have a few things to say
I think weâve used up all of our denial

With all that weâve been through
We are the same, me and you

Hey, did you go and make amends
With all those dreams you left behind
Say, you really think youâll be content
by letting fear take over pride
as you lock the door and keep inside

As the themes keep moving forward, so should you
No other choice but to continue, to see this through

It might be all too late
The wrong turn written in your fate

It might be all too late
The wrong turn written in your fate

As the themes keep moving forward, so should you
No other choice but to continue, to see this through
As the themes keep moving forward, so should you
No other choice but to continue, to see this through
