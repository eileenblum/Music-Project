Twist my words to use them as weapons
Break me down to gain more control
grab my thought and point out
its weakness

Strip my mind from all that of value
Turn my goodwill into hatred and lies
Smash my soul into a thousand little pieces
We've become everything we've despised

How the hell did we let it get this far?
Right now it feels like I don't know
who you are

[Chorus]
All my life, all this time
I've been searching for something,
searching the peace of mind
And I had it for the shortest of time
Now I'm no longer yours, and you're no
longer mine

Why we're fighting
I swear I do not know
Remind me how this started,
we've been at it for so long
New sides of you appear
I've never ever seen you show
Still in our own eyes neither one has
done no wrong

We had it perfect,
we let it all go down the drain
We gave up easy,
didn't try to see this trough
It was all roses,
now we're drowning in a pool of pain
And now I feel I'd rather hang myself
than look at you

[Chorus]
All my life, all this time
I've been searching for something,
searching the peace of mind
And I had it for the shortest of time
Now I'm no longer yours, and you're no
longer mine

[Chorus 2]
All my life, all this time
I've been searching for something,
something to ease my mind
And I had it for the shortest of time
Now I know you're not happy but neither am I

[Chorus]
All my life, all this time
I've been searching for something,
searching the peace of mind
And I had it for the shortest of time
Now I'm no longer yours, and you're no
longer mine

[Chorus 2]
All my life, all this time
I've been searching for something,
something to ease my mind
And I had it for the shortest of time
Now I know you're not happy but neither am I

All my life, all this time
I've been searching for something,
searching the peace of mind
And I had it for the shortest of time
but we tore it apart, we let it dry up and die
