There's gonna be some changes
I'm gonna start with everything
Gonna give it all up
See what this tide will bring
I'll be holding so tight
Haven't stop for thinking with what I'm doing is right
And now I feel that it's time
Time to let go

Didn't think I can pull this through
I've got to say that I was wrong
Now I realise I had it in me all along

I'm bleeding it all out
Here's to a new say goodbye
Release from my past life
Afraid I knew I'm left behind
I'm bleeding it all out
I won't touch my true-self anymore
Nothing will remain as was before

Something new might come out of this
Something stronger, something true
I don't care what I manage what I have to do
For all the ill-natured spirits
There's a say what this good turn into
All I use are some pieces I was left from you

I'm bleeding it all out
Here's to a new say goodbye
Release from my past life
Afraid I knew I'm left behind
I'm bleeding it all out
I won't touch my true-self anymore
Nothing will remain as was before
