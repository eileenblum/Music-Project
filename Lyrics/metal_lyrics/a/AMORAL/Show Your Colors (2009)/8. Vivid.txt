Staring at in
but I cannot see the sign
I guess it's one of those days
A minor breach in paradise
Won't disturb my glam-struck craze

Tyranny lovers, private pushers
Pool parties with a view
Plastic dreams, bedroom action
For these streets
it ain't nothing new

[Chorus]
I always wanted to know
where do fallen angels go to die
I guess I've found my answer
They're all right here getting high
Let's be shallow just for one night

Take the 'bird out
drive it down the hill
Wander up n' down the Strip
before we end up at the Grill

Pink, black n' green...
the vivid colors of this scene

Standing on handprints and autographs
Framed pictures on the wall
Blonde beauties, young and willing
So sure they've seen it all

For one night you'll be treated like
a queen
Tomorrow noon you'll know exactly
what I mean

[Chorus]
I always wanted to know
where do fallen angels go to die
I guess I've found my answer
They're all right here getting high

Let's be shallow just for one night
Take the 'bird out
drive it down the hill
Wander up n' down the Strip
before we end up at the Grill

Pink, black n' green...
the vivid colors of this scene.
(C'mon)

[Chorus]
I always wanted to know
where do fallen angels go to die
I guess I've found my answer
They're all right here getting high

Let's be shallow just for one night
Take the 'bird out
drive it down the hill
Wander up n' down the Strip
before we end up at the Grill

Pink, black n' green...
the vivid colors of this scene.
