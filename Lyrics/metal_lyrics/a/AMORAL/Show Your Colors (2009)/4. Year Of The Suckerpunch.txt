Yet again I'm forced to see my face
Attached to a lie in the headlines
I won't let it in my headspace
Just straight out from my mind
These vultures they're out for my blood
It's all about supply and demand
I'm trying hard to keep my cool
Trying hard not to buy this

Oh how bad you need people like me to keep you distant company!
To help you be all you can be!

Here I am, standing with the best of them
In the year of the suckerpunch
Here I am, standing with the best of them
Give it a shot let's see what you've got
Here I am, standing with the best of them
This is the year of the suckerpunch
Here I am, standing with the best of them
Give it a shot let's see what you've got

Let me tell you some of the things I hear
Don't know if I should laugh or cry
Running your mouth when I'm not near
It's kind of sad your lack of pride

Oh how bad you need people like me to keep you distant company!
To help you be all you can be!

Here I am, standing with the best of them
In the year of the suckerpunch
Here I am, standing with the best of them
Give it a shot let's see what you've got
Here I am, standing with the best of them
It's the year of the suckerpunch
Here I am, standing with the best of them
Give it a shot let's see what you've got

Get your kicks out of mishaps of others the truth ain't enough so you'll add in some colors
So proud of the stories you get to share
Did you really think I wouldn't trace a lie, baby there's no secrets in the HKI
Couldn't sink to your level even if I tried

Here I am, standing with the best of them
In the year of the suckerpunch
Here I am, standing with the best of them
Give it a shot let's see what you've got
Here I am, standing with the best of them
This is the year of the suckerpunch
Here I am, standing with the best of them
In the year of the suckerpunch..
