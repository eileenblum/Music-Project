This was not my intention
this is not what I wanted
But I rattle the cage
when I start feeling daunted
I can't explain why
this just had to be done
And I'm so fucking sorry I wasn't the one

This was not my intention
I really need you to know this
To be a shadow beside you
always there yet deeply missed
If I could take all your pain
and make all of it fall on my shoulders
In a heartbeat I'd do it
I'd never make you go through this

I welcome the turbulence
I need the unpleasentness
This comfort zone is choking me
Can't help this restlessness
Forgive me for doing this
This is not where I need to be

As for the hurt
I guess it's inevitable
And the black
The black will wash away
To turn it around
Is to come out the winner
Make it good again

I've been going in circles
so much for "live and learn"
Not even surprised anymore
When I find myself getting burned
Why do I tear it apart when
all the pieces are finally together?
We all should know by now that nothing is forever

I'm walking with no-one
I'm not walking at all
Just staying still for a while
as this guilt trip is taking it's toll
To disappear from the world
hide here in this nest of mine
If I give this some time will everything be fine?

I guess it's inevitable
The black will wash away
To turn it around
Is to come out the winner
Make it good again
