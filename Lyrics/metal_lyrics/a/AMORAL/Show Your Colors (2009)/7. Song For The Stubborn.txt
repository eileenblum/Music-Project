Just once to be the one

On the outside, the one looking in
See it the weaknesses are showing
The ones I feel cannot win
One minute all is fine
the next I'm losing my mind
When all is said and done
can't dig too deep
I'm scared of what I'll find

You see you don't see it
Oh, just you wait
You say it's all way to perfect
I see you're falling for the bait
You say my tongue's like a razor
Well I'd say that you're right
So stay out of the way
get the fuck out of the sight
Better leavy me alone
for it is on tonight

[Chorus:]
From 0 to 100 in a second
I should get this under control
but I like how it feels
it makes me give my all
From 0 to in 100 second
Kiciking into higher gear
the brakes are gone
but I'm nail-deep in the steer

I know I'm loud whit my opinions
and I could use a few
I do not go trought the motions
trying to work on something new
Half the time I have no idea
no fucking clue what's going on
in my head
But I know for a fact
if I'd try to stop
I'd end up dead

[Chorus 2x]
