I've been shedding my skin
I've been trying to work
on the shape that I'm in
I don't have what it takes
I won't be there
to walk you through your mistakes

Out with hope, in with fear
(please don't describe how I feel)
Look away from the mess
that you're leaving here
(please do not force me to heal)
And for all that you've saved
(all that was taken away)
I can't give you the
peace of mind that you crave
(all that's been changed from this day)

So take this stone with you
And bring yourself back alive
If not for me, for someone else
I will step aside

If it's this easy to walk away
For you to disappear
Were you ever here?
