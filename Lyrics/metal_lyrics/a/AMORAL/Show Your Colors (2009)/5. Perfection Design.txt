I don't know if you exist
What I'm looking for might not be real
Still, I have to believe
Mark my words; I will find you

They're telling me nobody's perfect
Well that's exactly what you are
I will turn every stone, search all over the world
Won't stop till I've made you mine

I won't stop till I've made you mine

I just know that you exist
This is no place for compromise
I will turn every stone, search all over world
You will be mine

To settle is to die
Can't do that, now can I?

She says just the right things
And with her gorgeous eves
She gets under your skin
My perfection design,
am I losing my mind?

My perfection design
Sweet obsession of mine

She says just the right things
And with her gorgeous eves
She gets under you skin
My perfection design,
oh I'm losing my mind

She takes hold my hand
She whispers sweet little lies
This will cost me my life
My perfection design,
my perfection design.
