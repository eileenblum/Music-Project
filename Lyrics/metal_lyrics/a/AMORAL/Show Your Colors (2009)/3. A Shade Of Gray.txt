I don't know where I am,
how I got here,
or the fate that awaits me
But I'd rather be in any
other place but this
Separating my eyelids,
trying to focus my vision
to no avail
There's simply nothing there
And then it hits me
The answer is right there
before me
The air escapes from my lungs

[Chorus 1]
Beneath the surface
There's no way I could fight this
It's getting dark
I'm going down

[Chorus 2]
The end is flying towards me
A shade of gray amidst all blue
New form of pain I never knew

I'm aware that it's random,
but believe when I say it
feels personal to me
A thousand pains piercing
through my skin
I reach for the eyes, but
they're too far away
Just seconds and I'll seize
to exist

The nightmare holds me
I like so many others before me
The air escapes from my lungs

[Chorus 1]
Beneath the surface
There's no way I could fight this
It's getting dark
I'm going down

[Chorus 2]
The end is flying towards me
A shade of gray amidst all blue
New form of pain I never knew
