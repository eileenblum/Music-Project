Our entire world with all itâs prisoners
Is hidden in her eye
You can fight it all you want but you see,
The mirror doesnât lie

Passive self-destruction by the numbers
Greet the reaper with a grin
Donât you see a problem with the state that you are in?

Live feeding, canât look away
A perfect day for the mind to stray

Shame seems to be now long forgotten
And we keep passing down the blame
What once considered cold and rotten
Now in the limelights all the same

Youâll never see it
Standing so close to the flame
Just another chapter in this ever ending game

How much it takes for us to jump the gun,
Leave everything behind?
The results more frightening
Than every Rorschach test combined

Live feeding, canât look away
A perfect day for the mind to stray

Shame seems to be now long forgotten
And we keep passing down the blame
What once considered cold and rotten
Now in the limelights all the same

Youâll never see it
Standing so close to the flame
Just another chapter in this ever ending game

Shame seems to be now long forgotten
And we keep passing down the blame
What once considered cold and rotten
Now in the limelights all the same

No, youâll never see it
Standing so close to the flame
Just another chapter in this ever endingâ¦
â¦in this ever ending game
