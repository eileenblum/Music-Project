A bond of yesterday
Somehow got lost along the way
Itâs amazing how little thereâs left to say

Was all of this done in vain?
A silent stares is all I gain
This house that weâve built canât seem to keep out rain

Holding on to my mask of indifference
A shrug of the shoulder, embracing the end
Like a card game with time as the dealer
Weâve arrived at the crossroads my friend

I remember those days, not a dime to our name
Discovering new, finding more of the same
I look back at those times with only light in my heart
Such a shame to see a good thing torn apart

Used to search for a heart of gold but it got me nowhere
Bending backwards, make you feel you belong
Still you just were not there
Canât hold you hostage,
Donât wanna force you for the ride
If the passion is gone please step aside

We used to have the exact same fire,
But where are you now?
Where did that hunger go, did you lose it somehow?
I canât believe I have to ask you to like it
The one thing so easy for us

Yeah I remember those days, not a dime to our name
Discovering new, finding more of the same

I look back at those times with mostly light in my heart
Canât let one weak link take it all apart

We reached the end of those days, still Iâll hold on to our name
Wonât see me fold at the top of my game

A bond of yesterday
Somehow got lost along the way
Itâs amazing how little thereâs left to say
