I am not myself today
Just got informed youâve gone away
Threw my whole little world into disarray

Canât see the forest for the trees
Wonât turn our heads for any less than a wildfire
I wanna say that Iâve changed but that would make me aâ¦

Helped me see all that Iâve got
Made me work on what Iâm not
What good is a script if thereâs no chance of getting it shot

Canât see the forest for the trees
Wonât turn our heads for any less than a wildfire
Iâd like to say that Iâve changed but that would make me aâ¦

The weight of reality hasnât sunk in yet
The things left unsaid being my biggest regret
And all that you helped me with I wonât soon forget

Head in my hands, tears in my eyes
Not so much as a simple goodbye
Denial works only the first little while

Iâm gonna grab the day by the throat
And shake it for everything itâs got
There has to be a ray of light
Hidden in this moment of darkness
The strain of an invisible chokehold
Threatens to blacken a memory
There is no way this was meant to be

The weight of reality hasnât sunk in yet
The things left unsaid being my biggest regret
And all that you helped me with I wonât soon forget
The things left unsaid being my biggest regret
