The moon above it lights my way
This highway empty now, been driving night and day
Even in the dark, my vision could not be more clear
If youâd ask me now, Iâd say Iâm staying right here

The first time I was guessing
The second time I know
I do not want to go home

The first time I was guessing
The second time I know
I do not want to go home

The first time I was guessing
The second time I know
I do not want to goâ¦

With open arms I welcome the unknown
(Mesmerized by all youâve shown)
It wouldnât take me long to make this place my own
(It is with you where I belong)
How beautiful a landscape when you paint the people out
(How beautiful you are)
Breathing easy now, isnât that what itâs about
(I take you in, I let you out)

The first time I was guessing
The second time I know
I do not want to go home

The first time I was guessing
The second time I know
I do not want to go home

When the flaws begin to show
I do not want to go home
I wonât be going home
