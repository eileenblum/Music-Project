Familiar only by the name
Nothing else has stayed the same
The one from days away has died
When all was said you shoud've lied

Won't forgive, i won't forget
No way back, the mind's been set
Work that scar, don't let it heal
Don't let it heal

If i told you soon i'll be gone
Would your behavior change?
Or would you still feel the need to
Keep me out of range
