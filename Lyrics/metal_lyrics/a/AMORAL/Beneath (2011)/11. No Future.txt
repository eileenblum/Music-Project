My god, I think I did it again
Let my guard down, now look where I am
I feel it coming, itâs just a matter of time
Counting backwards still Iâm cought for my crime

I keep getting so much, yet I have nothing to give
And I know it ainât right but Iâm still learning to live
This thing as it is, itâs holding me back
This past that I have, pulling me off the track

Iâm getting tired of being me all the time
Would you take over just for a while
Somebody please, just for a while
Just for a whileâ¦

Losing myself between the black keys and the whites
Choosing myself instead of balancing wrongs and rights
I see no future in whatâs becoming of it
No future in any of it

Asking permission, making excuses
Still confused of what my deal with you is
It took a while but now I can see
It ainât fair to you and itâs not working for me

Losing myself between the black keys and the whites
Choosing myself instead of balancing wrongs and rights
I see no future in whatâs becoming of it
No future in any of it

Losing myself between the black keys and the whites
Choosing myself instead of balancing wrongs and rights
I see no future in whatâs becoming of it
No future in any of it
