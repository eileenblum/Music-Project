I'm cold but it's okay
I can't breathe, still I want to stay
Please don't pull me back up, I'm perfectly fine down here
If you ever truly cared, you will let me dissappear

You will let me dissappear

I left all of my troubles on shore
Where I am I do not need them no more
Underneath it all, the very end of the line
Accompanied by many, still this moment is all mine

Take me, swallow me
I want to drown in you
I surrender myself to the waves
That have come for me

With the ultimate embrace
I am gone without a trace
Amidst all beauty, I'm home again

Storms replaced by calm, speak has turned to thought
No one to concider; no, nothing to be bought
I can see the ones before me, now finally at peace

Take me, swallow me
I want to drown in you
I surrender myself to the waves
That have come for me

With the ultimate embrace
I am gone without a trace
Amidst all beauty, I'm home again

A life of rush, greed, spite, hurt, hate
I refuse to participate
No loger do these values apply
Goodbye...

Oh, the colors and the shapes
Might get to be too much but I know I can take it
I won't underline all the reasons for my escape
For you, these reasons are worthless
This will all be over soon
And no, I'm not afraid
So grateful for all that I got from you
All that you've shared with me
All that I'm 'bout to become
