A perfect smile I cannot ruin
I looked way, she passed me by
And though Iâd love to be the target
This piece of glass helped me deny

All I wanted was some closure
A chance to move on with a smile
Now I know itâs not to happen
Not while I'm here, not in this life

Every time the past emerges
It brings it right back to the start
Keeps reminding of the burden
Forever carried in my heart

All I wanted was some closure
A chance to move on with a smile
Now I know itâs not to happen
Not while I'm here, not in this life
