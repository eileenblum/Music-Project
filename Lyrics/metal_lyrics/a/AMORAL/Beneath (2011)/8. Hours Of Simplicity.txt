We lean towards the earlier hours
Hours of simplicity
We shun away from all which devours
Devours precious memories

For all I know, our past must show

All our worries once were temporary
The need for expression, with all else secondary
Our knowledge equals guess
When weâre content with less
All our worries forever temporary

I know this one will slim down my chances
And so Iâll have it be
Iâll step in front of the chariots of progress
And let the weight revive me

For all I know, our past must show

All our worries once were temporary
The need for expression, with all else secondary
Our knowledge equals guess
When weâre content with less
All our worries forever temporary

All our worries once were temporary
The need for expression, with all else secondary
Our knowledge equals guess
When weâre content with less

All our worries once were temporary
The need for expression, makes all else secondary
All knowledge equals guess
We were content with less
