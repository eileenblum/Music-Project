Far in the pale horizon
Burning shadows still hanging
Remnants from the past
The sun may not rise anymore

Standing I greet the new twilight
The end as well as the beginning

A change for corruption and death
Progression made backwards - extinction
A change for silent rebirth
The balance between autumn and spring

Not the rising new order
Like the tide sweeping the old away
Silent renewal

There's no need to push the limits
Only to keep awaiting for the change

A crime committed by the world
The secret of old without words
Seasons turning absurd
But choked voice cannot be heard

Not hte rising new order
Like the tide sweeping the old away
Silent renewal
