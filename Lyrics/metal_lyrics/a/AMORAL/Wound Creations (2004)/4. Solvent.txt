Abuse of intoxicant emotions
Owing all that you have to the bold
Play with the knife, play with the solvent
Tear open the scars and revoke the will

Empty slots filling your body
For vacancy to be shed on others
Separating the faults from the reason
Isolating your life from your mission

How far to follow the thread
Where you are - follow the thought you shun

You are all when they have nothing
And still wandering inside the trap
Play with the hatch, play with the solvent
From final destination onwards again

Unable to distinguish the writings
Because of standing too close to the wall
By finding your head from the corner
You would only prove your word

How far to follow the thread
Where you are - follow the thought you shun
How far to thread by the stream
Stray now - tie off the dead veins

Wound fate leaves you wound creations
Searching for life in ways many would question
Blindly stabbing your back for your ailing needs

Prey upon self
