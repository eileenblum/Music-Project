Cold stare and a crackling sun. On lifeless trees our will is hung.
Passion is grand. Eager ears have heard, denial at hand, romantic absurd. Thru blind caverns we run. Crawl with the rats yet trust not but one! Again and again, a shocking reminder. Face to face, we've never been blinder. Silent breath in robotic nerves. The final truth of all things is that there is no final truth. Truth is what's transitory, Its human life that is real. Passing spheres overhead, does not bring rest. Forgotten tears to dread, a lingering pest! Thoughtful creatures, they scurry around while bound shackled to the flesh. Speak your mind, move nothing but chaos, within the brain, fabricating a purpose for your death. Life it is nothing,
simple, hideous nothing. We've got to remain logical, theres no choice,
its that or the end. Clarity thru Apathy.
