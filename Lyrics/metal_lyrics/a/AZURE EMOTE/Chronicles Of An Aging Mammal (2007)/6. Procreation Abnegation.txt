New life child. Age old trial. Their eyes speak - help them DIE!!
Procreate. Ease your fate. Our eyes speak - help us DIE!! Time on the wall. Smiles: Where have these faces gone? Down hill dawn. Child on the way. Please: Take care of my fading life. Bare my strife. Why should we continue and feed the flame? Selfish need. Bred to ease. When will it end? Child - Empty instinct - No Way! Please! Be there when you die. Hold my hand. Fade! Copulate. Ease your fate. Procreate! Give the youth, more than what you had. More emptiness!
