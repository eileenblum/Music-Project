Stay the fuck away from me, you disgust me. I cringe at your debauchery. Arrogant pride based on nothing, futile lives on others clinging. Breeding. Speaking lies, abrasive and apparent. The filth, the stench, in everyway. The filth, the stench, obscene, disgusted! Misanthropic. Cough and hack and spread disease. Test and probe your selfish reprieve. Kiss and fuck then kill each other. Children learn their hopes to smother. Swing from trees then wear a suit. The third eye sees societies root. Create religion, fear and war. Poverty, riches, survivals core. To each his own, your filth, your home. Fake your smile. and fake your fucking love. You shit the same, then play the game. Struggle to gain, we're all the same! Misanthropic stigma in my brain. Human foulness, pathetic and insane. Animalistic nature, selfish and repulsive. Ignorant struggle to procreate and live. Die!
