Oh travesty and loyalty amongst honor. Stab my back and kiss my cheek, but thats o.k. You'll die alone. Just like the rest of us all, just as nature intends for us all. Trust misplaced fantasy. Where There's a will There's a way. A way to be, misguided by the lies. Ignorance is the wellspring of love. We swim in peace before we drown! Stand to be betrayed. To be alone. Eternal war, for nothing more. A dream to know, unbinding flow. Eternal war, for nothing more. You plan to be forever free. Inaccessible momentary lapse of transitory dreams. Blacklisted logic for a shared retreat - in lies. Cold shadows on the moving floor. Disregarded warmth to please the whore. Gaze through the abyss of pointless pride.
