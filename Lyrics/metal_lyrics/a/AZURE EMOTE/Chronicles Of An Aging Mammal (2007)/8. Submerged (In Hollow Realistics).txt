Flood in apostasy. Flood in ecology. Flood in integrity. Flood in this empty sea! Moldable creatures with opposable thumbs, painful waves carry my spiritual crumbs. erac lliw eno on dne eht ni rettam sgniht ekam ot yrt llits I. Tell me of love to ease my mind. Let me dream to forget mankind. I will not stop fighting to give, to give this heart some depth and to exit like a martyr, and to die with heartfelt breath. And...and to die, to die with heartfelt breath. Friends are deep and family more, just a creature behind the door. Face this truth so empty and sore. This truth has a dreamer of meaning turned to life nevermore! Behind these speechless eyes, my observance, and disgust strips away my passion. For in everything there is naught and in naught there is nothing.
