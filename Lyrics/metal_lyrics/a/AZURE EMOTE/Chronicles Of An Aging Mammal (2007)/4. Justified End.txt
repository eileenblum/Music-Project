Justified end! Infect disease, growing, the need. Science reliance, Flesh! Ignore Godwar, bombthreat, fleshsore. Mammals procreate Death! Blood! Transfuse. Blood! Reuse. Cut it, clone it, transplant, own it. Vaccinate, subjugate Flesh! Poison bloodgod, reason, jihad. Sickness, illness, death! Panic now, found us here, pray my son, fell behind, in our home, Sure to die. Sullen eyes, in the night, no way out, hear the dead, push the cold, to my head. Splicing genepool, cloning braintool. Recreate, reanimate Flesh! Our fate will tell, irate deathbell.
Feeding, screaming Death!
