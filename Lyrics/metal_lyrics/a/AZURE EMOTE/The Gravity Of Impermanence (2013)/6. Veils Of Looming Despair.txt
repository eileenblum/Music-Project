Observe! Your balance conceived. Awaken through darkness to peer.
The guiding moon of quantum focus. The sun is covered, the dusk will reveal. Sojourning home, behind these veils of, this looming despair...
Anxiously yearning, the narrow portal â eternally there. It is waiting.
The crest above, manifold physical in the vast, eventide echoes.
Seemingly bleak, a sobering gaze on shores of freezing despondent life!
Repetitive swells of constant motion, numbing persistence in your groaning heart. Silent mind, inward outcries. The gentle rush of pain rising to the surface! The crest above, manifold physical in the vast, eventide echoes. Seemingly bleak, a sobering gaze on shores of freezing despondent life! Repetitive swells of constant motion, numbing persistence in your groaning heart. Silent mind, inward outcries.
The analogy of suicide, gravity and spirit!
