"For many people, life is a gift..." "A gift?... Who gave it to you?"

"You've lost common sense in this society because of religious fanaticism and dogma. Your basing your laws and your whole outlook on natural life, on mythology." Absolute Autonomy. Suicidal liberty. Determination! with a sneer of contempt. Morbidity profound. Empowered through logic. Logic over fear. Mercy takes strength, action is what's needed! In brave rebellion, enrage! Manifest escape! Morbidity profound. In ignorance we submit to suffering. "Sacred? Is the fecal material in your intestines sacred? Your a biological organism like every other biological organism, you bleed when your cut, and when you die you stink. Now... what's sacred about that?" "What crime has this child committed that it should be born?"
â [Spoken by Kevorkian quoting Arthur Schopenhauer]

Empowered through logic. Logic over fear. Mercy takes strength, action is what's needed! In brave rebellion, enrage! Manifest escape!
Morbidity profound. In ignorance we submit to suffering.
