Attack!, Attack oppression. Burn the walls of suppression.
The living spiral of the mind, the highs and lows can be unkind.
Wake up to lies. See your death in your better self. In your longing to complete, you find there is no soul, in your goals once achieved.
Time passes on, the hammer shall fall, granting escape. The unfair, claim unfair. The living spiral of the mind, the highs and lows can be unkind. Wake up to lies. See your death in your better self.
In your longing to complete, you find there is no soul, in the goals once achieved. Your own empty web you weave, refusing to rot â we burn. Sardonic â suffocate! Cringe, as i stand amongst you.
Consciousness, transcendence. I want to crush them all!
