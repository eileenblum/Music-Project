Technological shifts, of dependency. Feeding on the chemical, promises and lies! Closing the narrow corridor into slavery. Dancing on, the wisdom of ancient graves! Transient molecule's importance is ignored. Shallow and empty, the entertained worthless horde! Values misplaced, our pineal eye is erased. We're shackled in, the de-evolution to be! Gleaming lights of choking smoke. Increasingly plagued with no hope. The fall of an empire, makes way for another... and the cycle repeats, it perpetuates. We are slowly extinguished, in horrific demise. Our quantum essence, it fails to align. Gleaming lights of choking smoke. Increasingly plagued with no hope. Transient molecule's importance is ignored. Shallow and empty, the entertained worthless horde! Values misplaced, our pineal eye is erased. We're shackled in, the de-evolution to be!
