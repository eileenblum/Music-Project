Solitude! Empowered in, my fortitude! Thicket of thorns - endless!
Marching forth to a growing unknown! Shadow overcast, my boiling blood...
Dismal fog, embraced within. Overwhelming deepened sanity, dissipates within! Quantum awareness! Inter-dimensional!
We are the light! I frown upon my savior, which i have now overthrown!
Nothing is left unspoken. No purity unbroken.
