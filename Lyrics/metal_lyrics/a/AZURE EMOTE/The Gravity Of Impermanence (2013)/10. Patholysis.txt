[Instrumental][R.I.P. - Dr. Jacob "Jack" kevorkian, May 26th 1928 â June 3, 2011]
["Patholysis: When a patient in agony dies, then a doctor's true calling implies, one should do what is best, at the patient's request, for a humane, quick and painless demise." Morbidity profound, in ignorance we submit to suffering. "What crime has this child committed that it should be born."]
