Euphoric suffering, bask in the blasphemy of existence.
The skies unfold. Behold! We are electricity consciousness, with haunting visions. The cold winds of hollow souls - Behold! Cycle of morbidity, conduit of atrophy - inevitable! Passing pages of nostalgic pain. Ebbing physical validity. Incubus of bleeding retrospection. A sharp white light of a hallucinated life! Waning, relenting, faces foreboding. Borrowed energy - 
a fading reflection to our demise! Cycle of morbidity, conduit of atrophy - inevitable! Passing pages of nostalgic pain! Dismal reveries in twilight sleep. Daylight atrophy the fearful will weep!
