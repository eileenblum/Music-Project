We absorb, swallow and deny! Oppressors masquerade â overlords of deception. Shadows of mortality, buried but striving to breathe. Emptiness infecting me. Forced to survive, yet yearning to be free! Strike back! This Kingdom shall fall! Held down! Forced to see, this mask of corruption, 
the strings of your puppet deities!
