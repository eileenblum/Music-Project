I control obsession, I control direction. Scatter to achieve, value in the passing daylight. Labor to relieve, our pointless internal plight.
I control obsession, I control direction. Rot into the earth, pathways, options and values. None will bring you worth, beyond the bleeding quicksand of time. Choose your poison well. Fleeting hedonistic purpose.
Only time will tell. Never-ending vortex. I control obsession, I control direction. Perceive a decaying moment, reflecting painful inspiration.
Perceive a decaying moment, choose your portal unto death.
