Bathos and its dilettantes, bow down to the Iconoclast for itâs all been
done before and I yearn to break the symmetry of you all.
âWe but yen to suffocate in this box,â so they pride, stumbling towards the
morgue, clutching their instruments. Worthless clichÃ©s are their lives, so why
wonât they die?
Dive deep into the shallow grave dug by the hands of fools, but live not by
their simplicities, their precepts nor their rules.
Bathos and its dilettantes - mere copies of mere copies of mere copies of
absolute horseshit.
