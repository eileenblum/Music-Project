âTheyâve immolated our children upon their altars of bloodshed and burning
- Moloch and Tophet - for with the sounding of the trumpet comes the beast to
raze the congregation, the promise of Wormwood.
âLetâs blast the sixth trumpet, and pour forth the plague of our judgment.
Cast their pedophileâs messiah to the flames and slit the throat of each
accomplice.â
Jesus loves the little children of the world. Exit the corridor of
blackness.
Paedophilanthrope, how blessed are the weak ones. Paedophilanthrope, they
prey upon the children.
âGive them the persecution and death that they lust for.â
Nothing will wash away the stain, misanthroat.
âThese sons and daughters of maggots and men, these wolves in priestsâ
clothing -
if we donât bury them theyâll do it again.â
Paedophilanthrope, how blessed are the children. Paedophilanthrope, preying
upon their weakness.
âThis violation will never stop until the last priestâs throat is cut.â
