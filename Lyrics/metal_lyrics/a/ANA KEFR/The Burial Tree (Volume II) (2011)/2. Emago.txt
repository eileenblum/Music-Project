Slava!
âDulcet bitterness it was, with shadows cast as pearls therefrom - the
Burial Tree,
the blessings of Illumination,â said the serpent to me.
âFor, if the worth of our autonomyâs the everlasting flame, itâs a pleasure
to burn and to the ashes do we return. So let bleed the scourge, do this in
remembrance of me,â his sullen tongue of coals whispering secrets to the
hearth.
âThe tree of wisdom bears the fruit of blasphemy, for if from ignorance
hails bliss then with enlightenment comes the abyss and hopelessness,â so said
the Ophidian One.
Bathos, my bodhi - this changes everything.
âIn this immoral fableâs meaning: the forbiddance to seek the path of
knowing,
but instead obey, exalt and concede; censure the lust for liberation, prize
submission, retreat.â
The serpent recoiled in disgust and sensed the presence of the abattoir.
âFattened for their slaughter, they ask and now receive. What theyâve sown
now they shall reap.â
Where the tree of knowledge stands is always Paradise.
âHear me in my reprieval, mortal enemies of reason: embrace the way of your
ishtishhad god if your lives are but a vale of sorrow. Hear me, deceivers - the
Swastikristâs your savior, your precious prophets all pedophiles, your
afterlives populated by whores.â
So spake the serpent unto me.
