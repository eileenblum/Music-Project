âThere can be no true repose in a lie,â so wept the serpent, âfor there are
parasites in the tree of life. Yet I will never be pacified without knowing,
therefore I reject their strain.â
So am I the host or am I the plague?
âBut now itâs evolving, therefore I must purge their stain. They believe
because theyâre terrified to truly know. The empire of denial is burning as
anomalies are cast below.â
So the parasite benefits most when it is sanctified and adored by its host.
How I wish I were the hypocrite, that I could kill them all and be at peace
with it.
âAnd when itâs claimed their tongues, theyâll speak of life as if salvation
were their death and dying, as if their graves were opened arms.â
There yawns a chasm between transfiguring our mortality into a means
towards life and twisting our destiny into demise as an end unto itself.
