âThereâs a prefabbed usurper in the big top, the stateâs an asylum for the
demented and damned. Swing to and fro until the twine slips into a knot while
the Tamer of Prophets is devoured.â

abused?
âRingleader, house speaker, witness the cabinet squeeze millions of
citizens into a box.
âA puppet is a puppet,â so hinted the serpent, âRegardless of which fist is
forced straight up its ass.â
And weâve all already paid admission through our taxes.
âStop breathing, stop eating, stop breeding, if you really want to save the
world.â    There is nothing more rare in the world than consistent men, and
nothing so plentiful as lies.
