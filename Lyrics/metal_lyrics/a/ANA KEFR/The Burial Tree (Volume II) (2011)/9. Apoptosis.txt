And the fifth trumpet sounded.
Scab-peel diatribe. Process of cellular suicide, the beauty of mourning in
nature. Prevent the onset of atrophy, reach out and touch the earth with all
five fingers.
Leaves, bones. Pitiful when the host opens wide to infection.
Trees, petals. Weakness in the flesh, downward flowing, self-deception.
