âThere is no darkness in damnation. When all great truths begin as
heresies, it is a vileness to believe. Let this our gospel's Inquisition be
reborn and, in the throes of birth, enact its first rites of communion upon
their flesh and blood.â   
The first trumpet sounded.                           
We are the Children of Perdition, basking in the glow of their churches
burning.
âBeside 'truth' I've descried the chosen lie whereby your lives be death
glorified, praising the hands that fasten tight upon your throats - and you
choke.â
In this, our hour of judgment, humanity is violently redeemed. Thena'
Shaitan! Ana Dajjal! Enta Shaitan - and every knee may bow except for mine.
The second trumpet sounded.               
âThere is no light borne with salvation, the tragic fallacy's that we've
perceived a death's the worthy price to forgive ourselves for simply being
alive, a vicious lie. Cast the bastards to the pyre.
âI am Legion, who have been sent to dwell among the swine, hearts corrupt
with diseases, minds clouded by the treacherous divine.â
The third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven, blazing as
if it were a lamp, and its name was Wormwood.
âWe are the Great Satan.â
