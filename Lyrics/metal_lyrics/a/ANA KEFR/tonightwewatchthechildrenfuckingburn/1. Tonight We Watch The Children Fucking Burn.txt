How can we justify
The death-march of the Fourth Reich?
Sitting back as the Final Solution
Is applied to Palestine
As was done to Jericho,
Ai and Hazor â
Those of Canaan â
Ethnic cleansing near a Holocaust scale.

"Bow down to the Master Race."
The gods of Zion bleed
Behind a Fuhrer's face.

Do you see the irony
That victims of tyranny
Would acquire the infamy
Of the boot that crushed them down?

Is it the Master Race
And the Fatherland,
Or the Chosen People
And the Holy Land?
Bloodshed made holy
By your god of swine.

Tonight we watch the children fucking burn.

Hereby I testify
That the god of gestapos and hate
Manifests in the form of a gun,
Reveals himself in the
Violence that he creates.

Tonight we watch the children fucking burn, and
One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.

Fuck the U. N.
In 1948,
Established boundaries with
No regard for civilians.
Can you believe?
A state born of pity
Nourished by an age-old myth
And the world sits back and watches it.

And you wonder why
There is no peace
Behind the iron wall.

You see the irony,
That victims of tyranny
Would acquire the infamy of the boot
That crushed them down.
Crush them down.
Crush them down.
Crush them down.

Is it the Master Race
And the Fatherland,
Or the Chosen People?
How can you vilify one
And then justify the other?
