We release the rage
the epidemic of the Kali-yuga age
the fear rules us
the eye of the storm
the shelter of the blind
the ages passing byÂ 
into the traces in the sky

the world is compromisedÂ 
the ways synchronized
but not in my soul
aware of consistence
aware of my existence

a frequency range I'm able to see in
provides me nothing but unreality

Inside a world of dreams
endeavour of the senses
the senses that collide
outside reality

incantationÂ 
chanelling into obscurity
levitation
travelling deep to the memory

the world is compromisedÂ 
the ways synchronized
but not in my soul
aware of consistence
aware of my existence

a moment in timeÂ 
a million years away
the shelter in the sky
a shard of yesterday

Inside a world of dreams
endeavour of the senses
the senses that collide
outside reality
