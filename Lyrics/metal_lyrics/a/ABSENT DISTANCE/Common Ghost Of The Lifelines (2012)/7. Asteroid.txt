Floating in time and emptiness
waiting for the loss of empty hands
coursing, rewind eternity
in the universe's eyes I see

the lines will be us
the space is the loss
awoken by chance
led by our sense
the stars are the wayÂ 
the suns are the prey
to feed every life

Floating in time and emptiness
waiting for the loss of empty hands
coursing, rewind eternity
in the universe's eyes I see

a movement circular
an extended moment
a lesser piece of forever
in and through the vast
the cycle of the day
shifts the heat away
slowly leads the sun to decay

to the endÂ 
of existence
to the disaster without light
