Flow in my river
break the stream of my soul

The tide is covering the horizon
the waves come falling down
an undertow wipes away
the air from the inside

the sky is open
feeding the ocean
wash this place away
far in the distance
there is an absence
growing on

Dragged in the water
the waves are turning down below
the pain is over
set free from all that has ever hurt
Bound in desire
drowning in made up histories
we lose the fire
and leave the emptiness behind

I could see this through the ages
through a million years
there is no one pulling me out
struggling in vain

Dragged in the water
the waves are turning down below
the pain is over
set free from all that has ever hurt
Bound in desire
drowning in made up histories
we lose the fire
and leave the emptiness behind
