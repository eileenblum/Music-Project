I am the chosen OneÂ 
New born KingÂ 
Bringer of the lightÂ 
The truth divineÂ 
Soon, my kingdom will comeâ¦

The hour has comeÂ 
To face the fear in meÂ 
Am I going to die?Â 
Or will my nameÂ 
Be heard for eternities

Give me the strength to beatÂ 
This fear in me, so realÂ 
Believe, Iâll set you freeÂ 
Believe in meâ¦

Pass the stonesâ¦

And watch how Goliath fallsÂ 
Taste of fear, and panic in their eyesÂ 
I stood alone, before them allÂ 
This battle is wonâ¦Â 
I brought him down right on the groundÂ 
Here is your head of the giant oneâ¦

Now, when everything has come to an endÂ 
Still I contemplate in painÂ 
Is there a cause?Â 
Or everything just happened in vain

Give me the strength to beatÂ 
This fear in me, so realÂ 
Believe, Iâll set you freeÂ 
I am your King!
