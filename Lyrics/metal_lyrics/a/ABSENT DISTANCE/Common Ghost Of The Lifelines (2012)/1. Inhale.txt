I resemble natureÂ 
through everything I am
solid, lucid
breed of light
a breed of hollow light

it's time to breathe in the life
to let a new one begin
the halo slowly leaves the body behind

Immortal eyes
in disguise
stare into eternity

a sacrifice for my sanity and clarity
I'm on the way to find myself
a little breath is the evidence to the obedience
to gravity itself

from nothingness alive
leaving the unborn
cascading in, let it begin
a brand new life

I resemble natureÂ 
through everything I am
solid, lucid
breed of light
a breed of hollow light

it's time to breathe in the life
to let a new one begin
the halo slowly leaves the body behind

Immortal eyes
in disguise
stare into eternity

a sacrifice for my sanity and clarity
I'm on the way to find myself
a little breath is the evidence to the obedience
to gravity itself
