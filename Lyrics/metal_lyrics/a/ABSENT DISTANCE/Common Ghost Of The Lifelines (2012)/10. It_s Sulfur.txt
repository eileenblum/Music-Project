I warn you do not rethink
in ways you should not speak
these words are venom to the Earth
damnation itself

there is truth in both of our sides
the splendour which the authentic hides
there is pain which can be compared toÂ 
the tranquillity locked in you
there is truth in both of our sides
the splendour which the authentic hides

the left hand brought me tales of beauty
while the right hand crawled the way

Realize
I am but one
All that dies
dies undone
