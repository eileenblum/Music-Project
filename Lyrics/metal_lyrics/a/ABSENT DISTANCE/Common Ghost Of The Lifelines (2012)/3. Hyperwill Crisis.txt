So much we tryÂ 
so much to lose
so much we plan to live
so soon we die

unreal existence shifting in the air
a common ghost of the lifelines
left behind and incomplete
rejected in ignorance
no need to believe

weaving the air to form the shape
seeding despair to mould the fate
breeding more and more bodies
to hide away the breath of life
the true breath of life

So much we tryÂ 
so much to lose
so much we plan to live
so soon we die

Fly, fly away from me now
