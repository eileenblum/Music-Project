Caught withinÂ 
in the thin line
particles build the body and soul
everything what we see now
at the end of the day
prison made of informationÂ 
a limited life forÂ 
instant memories

I remember that decemberÂ 
fades it all away
A fake liaison
laid the eyes on
everything we had

now the Earth is the only place
to remind to rewindÂ 
to become the universe
not the only solution to offer
and suffer to comfort ourselves
we become what we most despise of all
a parasite and genocidal
leave it all to the sea
leave it all to be

I believe in endless circles
to revive in
time and time again

I remember that decemberÂ 
fades it all away
A fake liaison
laid the eyes on
everything we had

Caught withinÂ 
in the thin line
particles build the body and soul
everything what we see now
at the end of the day
prison made of informationÂ 
a limited life forÂ 
instant memories
