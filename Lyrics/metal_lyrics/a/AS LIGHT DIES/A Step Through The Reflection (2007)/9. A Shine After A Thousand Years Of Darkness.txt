[Words from the booklet]
What starts with a simple glow in a place
where it wasn't light in the last thousand years
can wake what has been sleeping since then
Beware of these ancient places
What sleeps is sleeping by a reason
Awake what sleeps before time
may have disasterous consequences
Or maybe the awakening time has come?
