[Words from the booklet]

There was a traveller and studious man, that in an expedition found
an ancient grimoire of an ancient civilization yet unknown by men

The book became his obsession, and during eight months was his only focus of attention,
During the greater part of the day and night he was locked in his studio room
His family was worried
When all of them shared the time together, during lunch or dinner,
they noticed that he was absent-minded
Rarely he talked. Always daydreaming.
Always thoughtful about what he had deciphered from the book since then.

He had discovered unusual things about the mirrors
It is known that mirrors were used the first time in the classic Greece
and they used it like we use it nowadays
But in this book was written that a thousand of years before the mirror had another use

The mirror was created to give a clear reflection,
and it was used for many kinds of black sorcery
Through the reflection they could see many things
...past ...future ...present ...other worlds ...another dimension ...another realities....

This man went even farther. He went beyond of what dared the most insane sorcerer from past
The mirror can show many things, but could show the dark reflection of this world as well
It is a window to hell
Never happened where you are looking into the mirror for a long time that
you start to feel that the one reflected is not you?
Then you have started to peer through the reflection by chance
The longer you look into the reflection, the clearer you see the differences
First the reflection becomes different. The room reflected becomes another weird place
The one reflected becomes any other thing, and finally there's a moment that you see it clearly...

That is the way this man used to peer at hell
No wizard has been so insane to try it
He expended hours, days, weeks and months
enclosed in the bathroom looking inside his reflection
He learned so many things that it is better not to mention
and he beheld so terrible things that are better not to describe or name
Those things are things that no human must behold

He didn't know that peering through the reflection is really risky
It has their fatal consequences
At the same time you watch, you are watched too,
and maybe when you come back from observation
Something that is better to stay in hell would use this way you have opened,
to cross through the reflection
It could be very dangerous for you, or for those who live with you

Is that real, or are just ideas resulting of an obsessed and insane mind?
