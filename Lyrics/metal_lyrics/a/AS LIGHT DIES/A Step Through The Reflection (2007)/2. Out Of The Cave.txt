All my life I've been chained 
and forced to watch a lie
Shadows over the wall...
I thought nothing existed but this

I was mistaken
One day, when I turned back and I saw the burning fire
I wondered if it would be something more
That's why I united the ties that bound me
and I stood up from the floor when all mankind lies
absorbed by shadows and I walked towards the opening

Finally I am out of the cave!
The light of the sun blinds me!
The absolute knowledge and the ideal world
I have arrived where no man had before

I have beheld the real world
Now I know what my duty is
I have to let them know what I've seen
I have to enter the cave again
and wake them up

I would never imagine this! Non one wants to listen to me!
No one wants to believe in what I have seen outside the cave
Everyone prefers to live with their illusions forever
That's why they have condemned me to death
and my only crime has been to try to show them the truth.
