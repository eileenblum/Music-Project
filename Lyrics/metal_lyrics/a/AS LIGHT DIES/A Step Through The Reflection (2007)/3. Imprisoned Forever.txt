Many eons in a slumber
I woke up in an unknown place
A prison cell with a candle
that never extinguishes
No doors and no windows...
No way to escape!!!

And I hear steps from the outside
I call them but no one answers my cries
I have broken my hands and torn off my nails
by biting and scratching the walls

Dreaming of freedom that I will never reach
I'm puzzled. Where am I???
Please, someone answer me!!!

A nightmare is this prison forever I'll stay
Desperate beyond belief
Please tell me why I'm here!!!

What was my crime??
Why me instead of someone else??
How long must I stay imprisoned in nowhere??

Give me back my life!!
Take me back to the place
where you captured me.

Why I can't remember anything??
Give me back my memories!
That's all I ever had

There's...
Is something there outside????
All these years trapped
in this dark cell like a rat

Maybe it's my fantasy??
Too much monotony!!

I'm a prisoner in a room
where there's no entrance or exit

I think I'm going crazy
I can't remember how I reached this place
Maybe I've always been here
and that's why I have lapses of memory

Perhaps it's just my imagination
but the candle fades away
I feel so cold, and as the light dies
my life goes out

This light is the only thing
that keeps my mind sane
in this cell of loneliness

The darkness is covering the cell
Here I am completely blind
I'm just hoping to die soon
not to lie forever
trapped in this eternal gloom
