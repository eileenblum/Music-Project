[Instrumental][Words from the booklet]
The beginning of everything. What was the beginning of the very beginning?
Was the very beginning the very end as well?
Or are we part of the beginning of something else?
Before the beginning, it was nothing: the really void
If there is a beginning, then there must have been a non-existence state
in what we call existence - universe - reality
What did the change from non-existence to existence?
Maybe never has been any beginning or any end,
and the universe has been always.
