Half of me has woken up this midnight
Half of me has died, I feel
Some doubts fly around me
Something worse than death itself

Just another joke running around my head
beating me behind my eyes
I have left the horror and the terror of my heart
from the coldness of my hands

Just a nightmare left behind
A practical joke of my subconscious

My blood turns into ice in my veins
My wife lies dead at my side
with two bleeding holes
in the place of her eyes

A light beams though my head...
A vision of the killer...
A splinter pierces my heart...
Reality becomes pain...

I swallow a scream so I won't wake my kids
Again another strange feeling
pushing me to see their room
Silent scream comes out from my soul...
Oh no!! All death!!

Wandering in my house like a lost ghost
trying to rebuild the facts
A voice, a dead voice from hell warning me:
"The murderer may still be here
just a step away from you
You will recognize him
Maybe he is closer than you think. Now go!"

I can't stop the tears falling from my eyes
tears of horrible sorrow
and pain deeper than the cold night

Remembering everything, my family, my life...
Afraid at last of being the next
in this horrible line

Getting on my feet, gathering all my courage
Going to find the man 
Going to take his life with my own hands

Sneaking in the ball, I see something at the end
A man, the murderer... I'm going to kill him
I can see the killer smiling at me
so close, so near...
In a new step I see the mirror

"You have unbound from bell your inner beast
when you peered through the mirror"
Everything has been my fault
Why I've condemned myself to hell??

The killer with my face...
The blood still in my hands...
Now I'm trapped in a dark realm
and he has crossed to the other side

My reason falls into darkness forever
My evil soul has come alive
The smile of my reflection...
I now be will freely enjoy his crimes

He needs more blood, needs more lives
And I have no power and I have no way
to leave the world of reflections
He has stolen everything from me
and has taken my life

I am a slave of his movements
when he is in front of a mirror
Now I know the grudge
that he would fell all this time

"This is the price of peering through
the dark realms of reflection
Something would cross to this side"
Through the glass you will see him
Something from hell longs to be free
