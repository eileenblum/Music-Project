[Instrumental][Words from the booklet]
If you want to enter in hell, then you have to be ferried across the Acheron
but first you must pay to the ferryman Charon
The fair is a coin if you are dead, but if you are alive, you need a golden bought
If can't pay the passage, you will be damned by Charon
to wander on the banks of the Styx for a hundred years.
