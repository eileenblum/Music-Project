I hear the soar coming 
This is the day of the end of our great empire 
The scourge of the gods finally has arrived
to slash our corrupted civilization 
Our wise men predicted it,
but we didn't want to listen at them 
It's too late to restrain the rage of our gods 

We will be swallowed by the ocean
to the very deeps of the earth
where every light dies before emerges 
All that will remain of us, will be a legend and nobody will believe...
A new age begins, and another dies with us 
Our culture and influence in the world will lose its name 
No one will find our remains 

An awful earthquake shakes the earth
and our buildings are crumbling
The ground breaks itself
and swallows the horrified people!

No one knows where to run away,
A few of them pray in repentance
I feel how the cold waters wet my feet
in the middle of this catastrophy

Waves drowns the Atlantis citizens
as its power destroys the continent
Atlantis is sinking, and all of us are sinking with it
It is dragging us to its unavoidable end

I am floating in the edges of a great whirlpool
spinning faster and faster, reaching the fatal center
where I will be swallowed up forever!!
