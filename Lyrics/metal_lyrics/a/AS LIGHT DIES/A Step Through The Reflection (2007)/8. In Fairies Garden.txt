Night is falling, dreams are calling
Crystal lights behind the trees
Glittering madness in fairies garden
Closer to this mystery

Enter here and see your dreams: dancing mindless
Leave yourself and fly away: kiss the fire

Nothing seems to be like what I have been
Stars fall in my eyes, strange dreams haunt my mind
Faeries take my hand, music leads my heart
Dancing 'round the night, leave my fears behind

Something thrills me,
my soul is tingling
fighting with my heart
No more magic,
my mind is knowing
I see the hands of time

Outside the sphere I see the sun
that sinks a thousand times
The lady of madness warmly kisses
the surface of my soul

Pain... all my might is in vain
Cold... scars are marking my soul
Shades... my soul is praying for death
Fear... I don't know who I am

My mind falls apart
No more laughter
I see no tomorrow
Oh, queen of the night, queen of the light
take away my sorrow!!

Now the music fades
Someone strange takes me out of here
I can see her face... oh is so sweet
I can leave myself to dream

Seems like I've been sleeping for years
Oh, sweetest voice waking me

A familiar vision of dreams in the mist
Tales from a lost world, waking my memories
I can remember her face in my sleep
She guides me by her hand
but I know the way

Crossing the clouds her hand in mine
So many feelings inside me are waking
Over the seas and the lands
she takes me farther, I'm getting scared

Strange new vision, she shows me a new place
surrounded by a purple sea
She sits beside me and touches my face
Dreams becomes reality

"You know this land
I've seen you fly over these shores
Look inside yourself...
your dreams will tell you
what you want to know"

"Yes, I remember...
I've been here many times flying above us
I can't pretend... you're all I've dreamed for
my whole lifetime.
I have a life, far from these shores
far from your heart
Maybe in dreams, we'll meet again
This is not the end"
