Glimpse the angles, and vertex of madness...
...imperfections of reality 
where demons travels through the hyperplanes

Glimpse the bounds of Tindalos... 
...outer-planer creatures
There's no place in cosmos to hide of them

Glimpse the impossible geometric shapes never dreamt...
as polyterons, and politopes... 
with dimensions never known before

Glimpse... glomes... tesseracts... rotatopes, spherinders 
and the infinite-dimensional hypersphers of Yog-Sothoth:
The door and the key

Planespace...
Realspace...
Tetraspace...
Hyperspace...

Behold the figures of infinity
Behold the perfect paradox
The most absolute symmetry
in the most absolute chaos

Behold the infinitely big superstring 
that will vibrate forever with infinite energy

It will destroy the reality and won't left life behind
the hand of gods can't interfere
It's a power greater and older than them.

Gaze the unexplored corners of the universe
where no light has ever shone...
...Lost stars whose light won't ever be seen anywhere

Gaze the ravenous dark holes 
that swallow entire constellations
...the destruction of the matter...
...and beyond the black horizon...

Gaze the worm holes...
...the portals out of time and space
that would let you go backward and forward in time... 
...it's the threshold to eternity

Contemplate the center of the universe and what remains...

Contemplate the imperfection of the lines and the bends
that causes absolute madness with just one sight
If you do it, their shapes would swallow you forever
in their damned axes and vectors

Contemplate what an eye haven't seen before...
...spheres where you may find universes and other realities
where madness and destruction 
are the beginning and the end of everything

Contemplate the end and the beginning of it all
Big Bang and Big Crunch
The cosmos expansion and the contraction...
...it's the breathing of creation!!!!
