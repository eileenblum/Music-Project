[Music &amp; lyrics: Nightmarer]

10 PM.. 11PMâ¦ 12 PMâ¦ 1 AMâ¦ 2 AMâ¦ 3 AMâ¦
4 AM in the morning.
They arenât back yet.
Iâm wondering where my wife and my son are.
They were supposed to be here long ago.
Iâm tired and worried.
She doesnât answer the phone.
Where are they?
Someone knocks at the doorstep.
I wish it wouldnât be the truth.

My worst fears are confirmed.
I canât believe it.
I canât bear the idea.
I cannot face this.
They kidnapped and killed my family.
They raped and strangled my poor wife.
They tortured and beheaded my son.
Both of them have been dismembered
and then burned. They took everything away from me.
Who could do such a thing?

Their remains are unrecognizable.
The distinction of both bodies is impossible,
therefore they were buried together.
I do not think so. It must be false,
but the bodies were wearing their clothes.
One finger had our ring.
This couldnât be happening to me.
Why did this happen to me?

I cannot stand the pain within my chest.
I think my head will explode. Nausea, retching
and vomit are increasingly violent.
I am consuming myself faster and faster.
For months, I couldnât sleep.
My body refuses food.
Suicide attempts already counts four.
I've been fired from my job.
I am ruined and finished.
My friends consider me a lost cause.

Analgesics cannot prevent my headaches.
Nor tranquilizers or antidepressants can prevent my suffering.
Neither alcohol nor drugs let me forget.
I am not able to feel relief.

All these terrible images come back to my head again and again.
Make me feel their agony.
God!
Why did you take their lives away?

I squirm in the mud and water.
I am only lit by storm lightning bolts.
Pouring down on me.
I'm cold and dripping wet digging with my own bare hands.
I feel the tingle of my skinned wounded arms.
Blood flows from several places.
I lost my finger nails, but I donât care.
I need to know.
They cannot be them!
I must check by myself.
I must see their bodies.
I need to identify them.
I have to know!
If it really is them, then everything is over for me.
I will join them at this very moment.
So no one will be able to separate us again.
