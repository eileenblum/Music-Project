[Music &amp; lyrics: Nightmarer]

You came and you've gone. 
You've been here and even you have not left a wake.
 I hear your voice in my head like an echo of what never was.
I have a feeling of irreplaceable loss. 
I feel the void from within.
I hear the songs that I first heard before being with you. 
They are irrefutable proof that I'm alone.
 I never heard these songs when we were together. 
Nowadays these songs remain, but what we had doesnât.
I watch the imaginary pictures hanging on a fridge that does not exist, 
of children we never had and never will. I miss them. 
You have separated them from me. 
You took them away from me. I canât recognize them, I canât remember them. 
Their faces were defined as years together went by, 
but now they are blurred, and they are fading away.
I wonder how my life would had been with you, 
I can see myself crying for you at your deathbed in old age, 
I imagine you crying my farewell in the same way, 
taking stock of the past and missing him. 
Not regretting even for a moment to have spent all our lives together.
A long time ago we released our hands, 
and when I tried again to hold yours you had gone away.
I keep reliving the moment when I saw how you were leaving 
and closing the door behind you.
 I could have run to you and have solved everything, but I did not. 
Deeply I knew that this would happen, but I did nothing about it.
I picture myself in deathbed in a few years wondering why.
Who's to blame? What was the cause? 
Unimportant. Nothing is so important.
Now you're just a memory in my head. You are intangible, immaterial and unreal.
It seems you have never happened.
It seems you have never existed.

Now you're just a memory in my head. 
You are intangible, immaterial and unreal.

I wish to fade away myself with your memories and die. 
Because I am part of all these faded memories, and this passed away wake. 
Without you, my existence makes no sense.
You faded awayâ¦ you passed awayâ¦you never happened.
You faded awayâ¦ you passed awayâ¦you have not ever been there
You have faded awayâ¦ you disappearedâ¦you never happened
You faded awayâ¦ you just passed away
Youâve been here and even you have not left a wake.
