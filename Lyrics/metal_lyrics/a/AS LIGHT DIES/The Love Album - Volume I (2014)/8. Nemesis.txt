[Music &amp; lyrics: Nightmarer]

You shouldnât have abandoned me. You shouldnât have done.
You should not have awakened the animal.
You should not ... But you did ... You provoked it. It was your fault.
You cannot flee ... you cannot run ... nobody will help you...
nobody is going to save you.
Now I have lost control in myself.
My anger controls my actions.
My mind just thinks of amending what is tainted.
I need revenge.
You canât hide ... you can do nothing.
You'll never escape me. Wherever you go I'll be close.
Wherever you move I'll be watching you. Whatever you say I'll be listening.
If you notice a pair of glued eyes in your back it will be my sight.
If you feel a warm breeze on your neck it will be my breath on you.
I'll hit you again and again until the brightness of your eyes will be no longer clear due to the trembling of your tears. I'm looking forward to hearing your prayers, feeding me with your tears and washing my hands with your blood.
You were born to be mine, and die by my hands. I'm your Nemesis.
I will show you're mine, so I will do whatever I whether you like it or not.
I will suffocate you because I want to read an apology in your eyes watery dumb,
and in your rattle of death I will possess you again
to let you know that you belong to me.
Then I will finish myself because my life is meaningless without you.
We are bound to each other, now and forever ... whether you like it or not.
You're mineâ¦ forever
