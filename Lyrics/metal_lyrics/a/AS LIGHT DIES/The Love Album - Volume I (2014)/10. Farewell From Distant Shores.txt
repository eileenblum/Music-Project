[Music &amp; lyrics: Nightmarer]

I regret I have left without farewell
I couldnât take any more time here.
I was summoned, and thatâs a call that nobody rejects.
Please, forgive me for not having told you that I was leaving.
I know that surely you would want to come with me.
But this is an outward journey that you have to pass through alone,
and it is just one-way ride.
Donât be sad for me, because no doubt Iâm in a better place.
Here thereâs no sorrow.
It is filled with light and love. Our love.
This essence surrounds this place.
I do know you will love it.

Remember me this way, just like the image I left you now,
the same you fell in love with.
Donât remember me as when I was alive:
sour, sad, depressed,
towards the dead end,
alcoholic and self-destructive.
I know you cried for me, I know you suffered for me,
I know you made everything in your power,
you helped me to stand up when you knew it was useless.
I couldnât tell you what happened to me, neither why I was breaking down,
I couldnât even find an explanation.

Please, forgive me for taking my own life.
Iâm sorry for all the pain I have done to you.
Donât blame yourself. It was not your fault.
Not your fault. My life was already finished.
Everything was already finished.
Forget the grief. Pass over it. Live your life.
Donât feel shame for me, because now Iâm in a better place.
I wonât suffer anymore.

I will wait for you here, come here in no hurry.
Sooner or later I will see you again.
Maybe 20, 30 or 40 years from now, but it doesnât matter.
Whatever happens, I will be at the end of the path.
And we will be together again, this time it will be forever.
