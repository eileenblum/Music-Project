[Music &amp; lyrics: Nightmarer]

Steeped in misery during my return to the surface.
Passing many torments, haunted by spirits.
Staring forward, walking ahead is the condition 
to bring Eurydice back to life.

I lost her once and I couldnât bear to lose her again. 
I did everything for her. 
I prayed to gods and I traveled through the Katabasis, 
I appeased the Cerberus, 
I entered into Tartarus and I crossed the Styx.

With my [Music I have softened the hearts of the demons, ]
Iâve shaken up Hades and Persephone. 
Sisyphus halted his march towards the mountain; 
the vultures, which were devouring 
the entrails of Prometheus, 
stopped to listen;
Tantalus began to weep forgetting his hunger and thirst;
but I made the Bacchaes mourn for the first time. 
Hades allowed me to leave the underworld with my beloved.

The return was worse than the departure. 
Loneliness engulfed me, 
although the spirit of Eurydice 
was supposed to be following me.

The spirits made me wonder about it.
The cold was unbearable, 
hardships were enormous, 
Eurycide was calling for me far away behind me. 
The echoes of her voice, among the cavern, 
were driving me crazy.

After an eternity finally I saw the light of the sun 
and I turned back to admire her alive again.

But her foot was still resting on the shade.
I had broken the rules. Oh mother!

I was not supposed to stare backwards 
before she reaches the surface.
I ran to embrace her in my arms, but there was only air. 
She had vanished forever.

Oh father Apollo!
Your son begs for help!
Oh mother Calliope!
Your son begs for your help!

Now I know that I have lost her forever,
and the Bacchaes will come for revenge on me
due as I caused their weep, they wonât ever forgive me,
and they will tear me into pieces.

As I am waiting for my death, 
with my lyre I will tear off 
the nastiest notes all over creation. 
All the green around will be withered.
It's just a question of time. 
They will find me. But I donât care. I'm already finished.
