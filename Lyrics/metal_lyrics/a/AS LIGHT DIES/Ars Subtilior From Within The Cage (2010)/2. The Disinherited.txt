They are the bastards
the children, the phantoms
...the evil, the bloody
...the unloved, the unborn...

Induced abortions...
Hordes of headless babies...
Elephantism and deformity...
Resulting of rape...

They are the disinhearted
never loved by their parents
They appear in my nightmares
and in my thoughts
every time I close my eyes

My parents hate me...
...I know that soon they'll come
I'll be past of them forever
I'll be past of the disinhearted

Finally they've come to take me away
I saw them floating through the windows
whispering my name coming for me...

I hid myself under the bed but it's useless
They all know where I am
They whisper my name...
This is the farewell
