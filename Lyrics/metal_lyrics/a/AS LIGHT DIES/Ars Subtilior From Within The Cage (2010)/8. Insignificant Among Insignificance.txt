Invisible parasite plant
from your earliest childhood
you have fed on the most unclean dirt

All over your stems runs
the putrid sap with the stench of corruption
You have sprouted from an infected seed

Engendered in the worst den
guided by the twisted hands of chaos
headed straight towards your perdition

You have grown up watered by evil
You have drunk the waters of vanity
Being impregnated by the dew of falsehood
Knowing what you would become absorbing it

What are you looking for, evil hypocrite?
What are you aspiring, absolute corruption?
You are an invisible plant
You are an invisible parasite in a sea of parasites

You steal treacherously
the substance from the plants
of your habitat
which shine because they haven't 
been fed with the same
poisoned essence
and you try to make it
miserably invisible... miserably invisible...

Poisoned and putrid plant. What do you want?
Your odious roots tear off the unique sterile properties
of an increasingly sterile earth
and you propagate your intoxicated presence
which made you loose your innocence in such a miserable way

Then you have reached your goal...
What would mean this negligible goal?
What is the season for your existence

What is the season of your plague?
Why are you everywhere
bleeding and tearing this sick world
and turning it into ashes

Scorn drives me when I see how you grow 
and propagate your sick breed
everywhere I look

Then you have reached your goal...
What would mean this negligible goal?
I long for your extinction

What is the reason of your plague?
Why are you everywhere
bleeding and tearing this sick world
and turning it into ashes
I yearn for you disappearance

You want me to become one of you?
You want me to become one more?
You want me to busy my feet?
To turn them into roots
I won't be by your side
neither plant nor buried
I'll be far away
from your
breed

In my own pool of water
ingrained in my soil
Where you will never come
and which you will never find

You are insignificant in a society
in a world, in a planet, in a galaxy
and in a cosmos
even in your own reality...
The more we generalize
The more insignificant you are

You are an insignificant particle
in the great void
I'm not of your kind
I will transcend
and I will watch you from above
I am god now and I'll never stop despising you
putrid plant

Wither away with all your kind
and stop poisoning reality
Your extinction is insignificant
it is insignificant
Your extinction

Insignificant among insignificance
