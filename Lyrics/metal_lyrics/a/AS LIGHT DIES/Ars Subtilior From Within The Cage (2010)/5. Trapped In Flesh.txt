Evil...?
What the hell do these brats
know about something like that
Are they trying to scare me?

They could never scare me because I am fear
I could make them die of terror, if I wanted
but they don't deserve such a merciful death

Soon when I recover my powers
I will shatter them
I will torture them until the end
Now they run around the trees of this forest
Trying to scare me
trying to make feel that they are ghosts
because they think I'm crazy...
Everybody thinks the same!

But theey don't know how mistaken they are
One day I will have the last laugh

I'm going to make them suffer
an infinite pain and the calamities
of a miserable childhood
like they have done with with me

And they are trying to scare me
These fools are trying to scare me!
I'm a demon trapped in a kid's body that longs for its freedom
They think themselves evil
Soon I will show them what the word evil means
I am evil!

I'm going to kill everyone
and mutilate their bodies again and again
They don't know with who they are dealing with
I'm the incarnation of hate
the grudge son
and the heir of vengeance...
the heir of vengeance!

Trapped in flesh during a whole lifetime
Incarnated within a cage...
Those responsible are going to pay for it 
Degraded
humiliated
to this life form
I who have been since
the beginning of the universe

I'm going to fill their minds
with the worms of madness
before I finish with everything
No one shall ever laugh at me no more
when they will discover what is beneath my skin
