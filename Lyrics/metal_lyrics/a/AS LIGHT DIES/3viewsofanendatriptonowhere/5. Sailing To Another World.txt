Watching over the horizon
All this years remind behind
And the long awaited day
has to come soon
Too many nights longing to see my face reflected in your eyes
Dreaming that I'm again by your side.
It has been many weeks sailing the ocean waters
That keeps me away from my home and my family.
But this weather is arising my suspicions
The wind is getting stronger and rain falls with anger.
Oh My dear! The ship is sinking
There's too much water foam and screams coming from every way
The terrible waves shakes and splits the ship in a half
Seems to be the end for all of us
People cry resigned knowing what is going to come
Whatever happens I'll always love you and I'll fight until the end.
I only remember a desperate escape: fire, lifeless bodiesâ¦
The pressure collapsing my inner most deliverance
I fought to reach the surface and finally breath
Clinging strongly to a floating piece of wood.
Miraciously the night forgave my life the stormy sea, throw me to the coast
Before I lose my conscious I perceived the taste of my home shores.
Where am I?
I have recognized this soil as my own land but it is if I where in another world
The sky is always grey, and the storm doesn't seem to want to leave alone.
An eternal twilight crowns this weird insane earth.
I reach my city, but is in ruins and forsaken,
As if there would have been no life in a thousand of years.
Maybe I am dead or have the world died around me?
I feel so lonely, exhausted and coldâ¦!
Nothing to feed me moreover in the
Darkest moment I hear murmurs
From hostile presences searching for me
Like shades starving for life.
They want to finish with me I know
I don't know if I would escape
I don't know where to go or what to do
But I willâ¦
I will fightâ¦
For my lifeâ¦
Until the endâ¦
