As the darkness falls onto cold abyss
As the black light turns the silence into pitch black hiss
Blackened form descends from the ambient death
Where the cult of mass addiction is coming down on crystal meth

It evolves in pain from a septic plague
As the fragments fade the colors into ultra black

In the dark it breeds from the blackest seeds
Infecting vicious minds
Thereâs no taste or smell as it burns in hell
Spilling down in jet black dye

Poisonous tongues crawling down your neck
Blessed with a charm, Black - Ultra Black
Sin driven thirst, inner demons unlocked
Wheeled on the hearse, Black - Ultra Black

Twisted shapes deform in a boiling mass
From a shallow grave it's shining with its filthy grace

So cold and pure, so dark it blinds your sight
So rich and deep in color, it reigns the night

Embrace the glamour of its wickedness
Narcissistic elegance and chic
Eternal funerals and decadence
For which - the comfort we all seek

So fierce and raw, so wild and grotesque
Blacked out to the core, so simple yet complex

Santus inferno
Delirus obsqurum
Tristis pigmentum
Acta sanctorum
