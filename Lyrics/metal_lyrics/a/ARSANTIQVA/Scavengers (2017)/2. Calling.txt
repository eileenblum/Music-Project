Call upon the forces of the dark
Summon the deeds of those who rule the night
Desire to spread the ashes of the world
Evolving from the depths of inner self

Chaos, Voices, Fire
Blood, Possession, Death
Greed, Destruction, Lust

Fight the enemy within yourself
Confessions of ever lasting sacrifice
Horizon is turning red as angels fall
Destroyer arising high across the land

Chaos, Voices, Fire
Blood, Possession, Death
Greed, Destruction, Lust

Crown is granted for the filthy hands
For the sake of shameless greed
Faith is honored for the sea of lies
For the taste of sacred seed

I break the face of the innocence
I rule existence of the world
I spread disease around your flesh
A final judgment call

Young witches dance in fire
As villains picked their czar
Enthroned another liar
So clueless as they are

Chaos, Voices, Fire
Blood, Possession, Death
Greed, Destruction, Lust
