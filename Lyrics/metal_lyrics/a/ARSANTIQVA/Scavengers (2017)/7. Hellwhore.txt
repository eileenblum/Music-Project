From the devils pit, rising dark seductress
Naked nymph was born in fire on the night of sin
The scent of death is her perfume, her purse is monkey skin
She walks among the birds of doom with a leather whip

Wicked slut on purple heels, dominatrix for the twisted
She's a master of her slaves, casted spells can't be resisted

Hellwhore â Bondage and abuse
Hellwhore â Bound to seduce
Hellwhore â Shiny fur and glam
Hellwhore â Pleasure for condemned

Black candles burning, love never dies
Her rusted nails will pierce their eyes
A crucifix on broken strings
A cup of poison, unforgiven sins

Her victims fall in pain as she licks their wounds
On the silver plate with venom, slaughtered flesh consumed
Infernal queen of lust, she's admired and adored
By a lustful outcast, her price you can't afford

She won't hide in misery, she's no myth of superstition
Drinking whiskey with her tea, hell is bound for submission

Morbid beggars on the leash, celebrating crucifixion
Dripping wet with black disease, waiting for a new conviction
Holy prophets burn in flames, high on fetish and temptation
In the dirt, stripped of their names, desperate souls seek desperation

Ashamed will fall and rise, deprived of sacrifice
The Gods kneeled down in scorn the night the bitch was born

Ugly perverts hail their queen, virgin mistress for demented
Dominating since 13, all the wishes shall be granted
