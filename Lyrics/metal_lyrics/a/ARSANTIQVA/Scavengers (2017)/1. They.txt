Embrace in the fire, name your poison for the holy liar
Let them burn in the land of waste, curse them all kill the double faced

Resist, Rebel, Dissent Against the fools
Resist, Rebel, Dissent They hide the truth
Resist, Rebel, Dissent Their heads will roll
Resist, Rebel, Dissent Until they fall

Behold, beware, they're chewing rotten trash
They play and gamble, they sell their skin for cash
They praise and honor the sins of whoring flesh
Corrupted hordes of mammals crawl on a pile of broken bones

Their rules will define their views
Deception is carved on their tongues
Their wise men justify abuse
The suffering will serve the old and young

The circus of deviance invites to greet their kings
Where clowns and jugglers are pulling all the strings
Where hookers in coffins are flashing diamond rings

The storm is coming to their nest to lay them all to rest forever
The Serpents Rising
Sinners are preaching sacred words
Enslaved by sweet reward of pleasure
The Serpents Rising
Greed is hidden in their eyes they wait for the golden prize - salvation
The Serpents Rising
Blood is spilling from their veins
As vultures eat the slain in shadows
The Serpents Rising

See no wicked, hear no lies
Say no prayers when it dies
