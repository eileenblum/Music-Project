Black light of our creation
Dark matter of a cosmic force
A universe - illumination
Destiny has set its course

Ice is melting revealing truth
Revealing sins, revealing faces
Unfolding secrets of the forbidden arts
Exposing acts of self-starvation for hungry rats

Fire - Light of dark creation
Fire - Burning universe

In blood it's written, in dungeons hidden
In faith it's buried, conspiracy cult
The smell of torture from burning ashes, sweet taste of vomit
The Scavengers

Ice is melting
Disclosing filth, defying vermin guilt
The gates of worship have been broken by greedy scum
Perverted maids can bring salvation for an extra sum

Submerged in holy waters
True wisdom is entombed beneath
The world is slowly drowning
Away in children tears

Fire - Light of dark creation
Fire - Burning universe
