Rising on the red horizon
A cloud of black disease
Its poison and destruction
Have brought their masters to their knees

The eyes of fire are staring back at me
The winds are blowing through the chains
Obliterated mass has spread throughout the soil
Gomorrah is burning, survivors mourn the dead

Vivat Apocalypsis
Hellfire descends
Vivat Apocalypsis
Galactic wall of death

Memento Mori

The slaves of liberation
Have spread their virus for the cause
They're plagued by radiation
They'll trade their liquor for the whores

Contagious mere mortals elected as gods
Their offspring and wives have been gassed
Delusional creatures to fall one by one
They're nothing but nuclear dust

Time has come, light is gone
Looking at the frozen sun
As the world fades away
Everything is turning grey

Take my hand
I'll walk you through the Promised Land
A place where human life is banned
There's no beginning, just the end
