A verdict serves the justice and the law
I sentenced sinners to rot in hell
Survivors rise to wage another war
In rotten swamps they dwell

They dwell in fear, in darkness

A row of jurors will hear your past
Extracting victims guilt
Hyenas laughing at the outcast
Confined against their will
A witness comes to seal their fate
When questioned under oath
As tortured minds consumed by hate
Weighed what it's worth

Divide my flesh among the starving horde
Their dreams fulfilled in blood they've spilt
In agony united they've been gored
I watch them slowly killed

Obedience enforced inside these walls
As judgement falls upon a wicked soul
In dungeons frozen swine has decomposed
Last supper is gone to satisfy the cursed

Their throats are cut and hearts are left to bleed
The stench of stoned to death has spread
Grim servants serve my blood and those in need
The last amendment for the dead
