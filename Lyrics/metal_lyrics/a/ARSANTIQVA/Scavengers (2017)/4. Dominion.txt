I lay upon my burning throne
Simulated upon my soul
Glorified by a temple of your god
Reborn into the pandemonium of death

Bring my sacrifice, take your life away
Dominion with power and might
Dominion my temple rise
Dominion hate and death
Dominion black horde arise

I will sacrifice your love
Your desire makes my lust grow
Taste my spit feel my tongue inside your hole
Kiss my hands kneel upon the fallen stones

I'll spread my wings around
I'll make your children cry
I'll want them all hell bound
I want them all to die

I smell your dark desire
I smell your hopeless need
The dead will rise from fire
To spread their deadly seed

I dwell among abandoned tombs
I sit alone on my broken throne
The sense of time begins to slip away
The smell of death will fill the room
My hands are tied with rotten thorns
I ride the goat with the longest horns
