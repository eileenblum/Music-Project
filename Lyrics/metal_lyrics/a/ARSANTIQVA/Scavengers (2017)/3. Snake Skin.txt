Spill for me the poisoned seed, obey the law of greed
Obey the rules they never read
Death is in the air, it slithers everywhere
Relentlessly it slays the light

Ruler of despair the skin begins to tear
Pervaded by the sense of doom
Imperial the ways that lead them to decay
The cause for the absolute pain

Snake skin Break the seal
Snake skin Bring the fear
Snake skin Break the seal
Snake skin Set me free

Following the silent path among the fuming wrath
Among the burning ash, wicked mass
It's very hard to please when crawling on your knees
Sweet venom's dripping on my lips
Shed for me your devil skin embrace in deadly sin
Nocturnal enemy will end your dream
Lies are written on your face, the truth is the only place
To save the last remains of your race

Snake skin Break the seal
Snake skin Bring the fear
Snake skin Break the seal
Snake skin Set me free

They fall and beg for mercy
They vomit blood and curse me
They're locked inside forever
Their lust, their sins, their pride

Snake skin Break the seal
Snake skin Set me free
