You're killing yourself slowly, but I can do it much faster.
A separation of words like the separation of each of your spinal segments.
I am trying as hard as I can to break through these walls.
I am panning gold through this rib cage.
I will not be shot down.
Multiple stab wounds in the shape of your favorite constellation.
There won't be a scar until this bleeds first:
I have come to the realization that death is a serious matter
So quit joking around before I tie a knot in your jugular vein with my teeth.
I will stay alive long enough to rip my organs from my body and throw them at your feet
