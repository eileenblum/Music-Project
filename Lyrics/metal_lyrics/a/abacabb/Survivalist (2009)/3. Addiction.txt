Why would I take care of you?
Everyone around you, they keep drifting away
Why would I take care of you?
You've got nothing left and I got nothing to say
So where's all this faith and confidence?
I think it's your imagination
Will you take this to hell?
You're not the same
It's an addiction, can't you admit it?
I can't keep watching, you keep drifting away
I can't look in the mirror without thinking that I came from you
I have been consumed with lost memories and long sleepless nights, it's all because of you
You take more and more
It's always one more try
Always coughing up another excuse
If you don't stop now, you're never going to be the same person I knew
Blood is the only thing that keeps us biological
And I would drain my body of every ounce just to get rid of you
So where's all your faith and confidence?
I think it's your imagination
Conflicted and addicted
This shit is just as I predicted
Conflicted and still addicted, yet somehow you still can't admit it
This is an addiction and no one can change it but you
