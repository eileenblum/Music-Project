Don't wait for me
This might take awhile
I will live my life to the fullest extent
I won't live life by the books
I am in a state of destitution
I don't have much to live for
You are my life
You are golden
The articulation of these bones aren't strong enough
This encephalon can only hold so much
And the psychological result of perception
And reasoning is way too much
For you to handle
I know what needs to be done
I can do it on my own
However, I require that you are there with me
All I ask is that you wait for me because this might take awhile
