Nobody is saying it but everyone is thinking it
Nobody is saying it but everyone is thinking that shit
This camp might be everything but temporary
The infection is coming to wipe out what is left
We are a dying breed
Humanity's reign over this world has fallen seconds pass
I am breathless but I can still ruin
Numbers and technology will determine our fate
Where will you be?
Lay this land to waste
Fear was never an option
You're all that I have
I'm everything you wish you could be so get fucked
So say your fucking prayers to whoever it is that you believe in
Fear was never an option
I'm the infection
So where will you be?
Lay this land to waste
I want to free you from your misery
I'm everything you could be
I'm everything you wish you could be
Nobody is saying it but everyone is thinking it
Nobody is saying it but everyone is thinking that shit
Get fucked
