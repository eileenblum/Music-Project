Out of my way,
For the last time, you wonât break me (you wanna break me)
Why wouldnât you try on, or get in the game
But I wonât fall
As the presence, her presence is consumed by your shadow
Weâre here to wake up
1, 2, 3, 4

So take some notes and you can step aside
While we hand you a lesson that you wonât learn
Oh no, it looks like you were trying

As I sweat from the grasp of your groundfall, so will you
And like a dying heâll plead for another day
You will too
Donât fall back now
Toss out your pattern, donât break me

So take some notes and you can step aside
While we hand you a lesson that you wonât learn
Oooh no, it looks like you were trying
And I donât need to give a reason or lie
Iâll make myself look bigger in the flashing lights
So take some notes and you can step aside
While we change the world

[?]
Iâve been trying
Hold on, I can try
You can take some notes
Iâm having troubles to keep this ship afloat
Iâve been trying
Oooh
Iâve been trying

So take some notes and you can step aside
While we hand you a lesson that you wonât learn
Oooh no, it looks like you were trying (were trying)
And I donât need to give a reason or lie
Iâll make myself look bigger in the flashing lights
So take some notes and you can step aside
While we change the world
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
Oooh oooh
