Attack Attack!
We back again, baby.
We fresh out that jankety, baby.
Hey, yo, man.
Itâs that new joint, baby!
Itâs that new joint, baby!
2010!

There is only one thing that can fill my chest
As I go through the options, they are useless.
Looking for a reason
And something to live for
Everything seems to fall short

Oh my love, you need to just keep breathing, let your heart beat slowly.

Oh my love, I was never meant to fill your cup
And oh, I can't fulfill you forever
'Cause I'm not your knight in shining armor
Or the one that you might call for everything

There is only one thing that can still my fear
As I look for the meaning, you are still here
There can only be one god.
There can only be one god.

Shorty, you're on my mind (yeah)
Shorty, all of the time. (yeah)
Shorty, you're on my mind (yeah)
Shorty, all of the time. (yeah)

Oh yeah.

Oh my love, I was never meant to fill your cup
And oh, I can't fulfill you forever
'Cause I'm not your knight in shining armor
Or the one that you might call for everything
