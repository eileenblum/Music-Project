[Deluxe Edition Track]Is this my last breath? [4x]

I can't breathe,
I'm choking on my own condescending words.
Answer me
Will you ever answer me?

Aren't you gonna answer me?
When I am crying out your name and I'm lost in shame.
Lead me on my way,
And give me words to say.
(words to say)

And I can't see
That I've lost my dreams,
Carry me,
'Cause my heart is weak

Is this my last breath? [2x]

I can't sleep
This world inside my head is run by my anxious thoughts
Give me peace
Will you bring me off my knees?

Aren't you gonna answer me?
When I am crying out your name and I'm lost in shame.
Lead me on my way,
And give me words to say.
(words to say)

And I can't see
That I've lost my dreams,
Carry me,
'Cause my heart is weak

Is this my last breath? [2x]

I've been trying aimlessly, over and over
To fill this void inside of me.

My mind's in a cage
And I'm on my knees.
(on my knees)

I can feel the shift go inside my head,
Am I going crazy?

And I can't see,
That I've lost my dreams,
(is this my last breath?)
Carry me,
'cause my heart is weak
(is this my last breath?)

I can't see,
That I've lost my dreams, yeah
And carry me
(You gonna answer me?)
'Cause my heart is weak

Answer me! [3x]
