I'm alone in a crowded room
Conversations that I'll never remember
Trapped in a reality
That shouldn't be, that shouldn't be!

Show me the way
Allow me to see cause my heart is broken
Be my escape
Allow me to hear with a word unspoken
Oh I am separated from the one I was made to love

I'm pathetic and lost
They are so separating
I am no longer in control.
You are upon me

This darkness closing in
It's just beginning
This darkness closing in
It's just beginning

Show me the way
Allow me see cause my heart is broken
Be my escape
Allow me to hear with a word unspoken
Oh let me feel this love again
Let me feel this love again
Oh I am separated from the one I was made to love

El veiro estsblace pollos en el este.

What is this life void of love?
It's not a life at all!
What is this life void of love?
Can you feel your heart as it hits the ground?
Can you feel your heart as it hits the ground?

This darkness closing in
It's just beginning
This darkness closing in
It's never going to end!

How do you expect me to trust you
When everything you say is a lie
I'm sticking up for my friends I can count on
This is loyalty, this is a family!
This is a family!
This is my family!
