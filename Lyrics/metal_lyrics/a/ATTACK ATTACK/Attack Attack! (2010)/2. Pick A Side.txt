[Deluxe Edition Track]I'll never see what you live for.

Will I ever see you the way he does?
I'm nothing but a man with a child-like faÃ§ade.
My vision is skewed by my own self-destructive nature

No, this is all so wrong.
No, this is all so wrong.

So tell me the truth,
Shout it at the top of your lungs,
'Cause we all will be dead so soon.
I'm burning alive.
I need to find the reason for life,
Before I am hollow inside.

No, this is all so wrong.
No, this is all so wrong.
