What up, we got DJ Club.
Name is McSwagger.
We got J. Sleezy.

I don't give a.

Welcome to my party as I'm lettin' you in
Raise my hand to the DJ, let the music begin
McSwagger is the type man
To hold the world in his hand
My name will be on all your lips
And typed by all your fingertips

Baby don't keep coming up to me
I hope you know you lack originality
I don't drop my pants that easily
So baby, just get away from me,

I don't wanna have to make you cry,
I don't wanna leave with you tonight.

I don't give a.

Shut your mouth baby girl you're nothing new
I hate everything you do
Try to get away from you
I can't breathe when you're always close to me so go whoa.
Whoa.

It don't mean I'm from your future if I'm not part of your past
The feeling that you got, you'll sober up and it won't last.
Swag-dad can see that you used to moving fast
But now I'm VIP I'm the lead in every cast

Baby, I don't wanna talk to you
All the things that you're doing ain't nothing new
I can tell just what you want to do
So just get away from me,

I don't wanna have to make you cry,
I don't wanna leave with you tonight.

McSwagger in your car
McSwagger in your stereo
McSwagger part of every single bump and grind scenario
McSwagger in your ear
McSwagger in your head
McSwagger is a super star that you dream of in your bed.

I don't give a.

[2x]
Shut your mouth baby girl, you're nothing new,
I hate everything you do
Try to get away from you
I can't breathe when you're always close to me so go whoa.
Whoa.

I don't give a.
