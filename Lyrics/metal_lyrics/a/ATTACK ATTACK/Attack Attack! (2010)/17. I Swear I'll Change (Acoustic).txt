[2011 Re-issue Track]Seeing everyoneâs true face makes me wish they would keep their masks on.
âCause I donât wanna know, who you really are.
I thought you would have learned your lesson by now.
True face exposed; dark motives in the mind.
Was listening too scary for you?
You havenât changed, you never will.
You and I will never be the same.
You say you try, but you never change.
You can hide and say youâre not to blame.
I thought you have learned your lesson by now!
I was wrong; something in me still has love for you.
I donât know why.
Everyone is not as good as they seem.
Just trust in me, just trust in me, trust in me.
I never knew that lying came so natural to you.
âCause I canât bear to see, the man youâre gonna be.
I thought you would have learned your lesson by now.
You and I will never be the same.
You say you try, but you never change.
You can hide, and say youâre not to blame.
I thought you have learned your lesson by now!
You and I will never be the same.
You say you try, but you never change.
You can hide, and say youâre not to blame.
I thought you have learned your lesson by now!
