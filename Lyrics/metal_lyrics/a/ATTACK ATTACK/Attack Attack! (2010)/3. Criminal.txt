[Deluxe Edition Track]Looks like I'm doing time,
Framed for another crime
Lost all my innocence in the shameless sin of a broken mind

Well maybe I'm to blame,
Guess things are gonna change
Held down and taken in to a hopeless life for your pointless game

You lied, you lied to me
You went and blew my cover
You got away with murder
And now I'm the criminal
But you gave me the key
Now I'm the criminal
But you gave me the key

Would you say anything,
Give me some reasoning
To why you stabbed me in the back while I was covering
You for this stunt you pulled
Do you think I'm a fool?
I'll tell them everything
To keep my life in record clean

You lied, you lied to me
You went and blew my cover
You got away with murder
And now I'm the criminal
But you gave me the key
Now I'm the criminal
But you gave me the key

Bullets and enemies,
How is it you and me
Framed our future blaming our lost past?
Shotguns and make believe,
What you've become me
Holding on to memories won't last,
Your fame won't last

Now I'm the criminal
But you gave me the key
I'm the criminal,
I am the criminal
And you gave me the key

Now I'm the criminal!
