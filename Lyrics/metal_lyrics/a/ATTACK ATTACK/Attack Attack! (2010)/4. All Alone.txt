[Deluxe Edition Track]I'm feeling this desperation,
Your words are tearing me apart
With every last conversation,
Not going anywhere from the start
You and I could have made this happen,
Given time and some sense,
But now you're on your own
I can't help but wonder what this could have been,
But now you're frozen

I have to be the one who just leaves you all alone
I hate to see you leave,
But your heart's been growing cold
Now I believe and I'm starting again,
To be the man that I should be
I hope you find what you're looking for,
Just take a chance and then you'll see,
Then you'll see

I needed some restoration,
But you kept tearing me apart
I'm going through renovation,
Rebuilding what you took from my heart
You and I could have made this happen,
Given time and some sense,
But now you're on your own
I can't help but wonder what this could have been,
But now you're frozen

I have to be the one who just leaves you all alone
I hate to see you leave,
But your heart's been growing cold
Now I believe and I'm starting again,
To be the man that I should be
I hope you find what you're looking for,
Just take a chance and then you'll see,
Then you'll see

You and I could have made this happen,
Given time and some sense,
But now you're on your own
I can't help but wonder what this could have been,

[2x]
I have to be the one who just leaves you all alone
I hate to see you leave,
But your heart's been growing cold
Now I believe and I'm starting again,
To be the man that I should be
I hope you find what you're looking for,
Just take a chance and then you'll see,
Then you'll see
