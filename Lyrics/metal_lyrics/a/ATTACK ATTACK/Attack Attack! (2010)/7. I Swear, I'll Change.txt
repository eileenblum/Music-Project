Seeing everyone's true face
Makes me wish they would keep their masks on
'Cause I don't wanna know, who you really are
I thought you would have learned your lesson by now

True face exposed, dark motives in the mind
Was listening too scary for you?
You haven't changed, you never will (you never will)

You and I will never be the same,
You say you try, but you never change
You can hide, and say you're not to blame
I thought you have learned your lesson by now

I was wrong
Something in me still has love for you
I don't know why
Everyone is not as good as they seem
Trust in me, trust in me.

I never knew that lying came so natural to you
'Cause I can't bear to see, the man you're gonna be
I thought you would have learned your lesson by now

You and I will never be the same,
You say you try, but you never change
You can hide, and say you're not to blame
I thought you have learned your lesson by now

You and I will never be the same,
You say you try, but you never change
You can hide, and say you're not to blame
I thought you have learned your lesson by now
