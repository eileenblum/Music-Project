[2011 Re-issue Track]Open your eyes, we live in filth and misery.
Listen to what I say, through something that will last forever.
What are you fighting for?
What are you fighting for?
And now Iâve got to find a simple escape.
All I need, all I need is a simple escape.
Canât you see my mind as it struggles to be sane?
An escape from everything.
It finally changes on the inside.
Why do we forget, all the things that donât matter?
Listen to what I say; itâs still something that will last forever.
What are we fighting for?
What are we fighting for?
And now Iâve got to find a simple escape.
All I need, all I need is a simple escape.
Canât you see my mind as it struggles to be sane?
An escape from everything.
It finally changes on the inside.
Donât hold your breath for the things that you seek, it will all burn to the ground with everything.
Weâre all looking for our freedom from the things we want to run from.
All I need, all I need is a simple escape.
Canât you see my mind as it struggles to be sane?
All I need, all I need is a simple escape.
Canât you see my mind as it struggles to be sane?
An escape from everything.
It finally changes on the inside.
Open your eyes, yeah.
