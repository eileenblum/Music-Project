Go!

Life alone is not worth living anymore
There's no purpose in my actions
There's a hole so deep inside of me
This isn't how I planned it
I still don't understand it
Why is everything falling apart?

Everything seems so far out of my reach
And I can't get a grasp on reality

There's no ground to stand on
There's no earth beneath my feet
I don't feel like I can go another day
Living it out this way

Come on

Can you hear me screaming?
I've been yelling so much
That my throat is bleeding
I'm giving up on everything
I've given up on everything

Everything seems so far out of my reach
And I can't get a grasp on reality

There's no ground to stand on
There's no earth beneath my feet
I don't feel like I can go another day
Living it out this way

I just need another chance
I need to get back on my feet
I need to fight back
But I have nothing left

There's no ground to stand on
There's no earth beneath my feet
I don't feel like I can go another day
Living it out this way

Err-ah
