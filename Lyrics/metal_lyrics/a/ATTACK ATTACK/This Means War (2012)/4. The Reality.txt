I'm so fed up with living inside this prison
My life's controlled by another's conviction
I need a new reality
I need to find stability

(there must be some way out)

This is not the last time I'll say it
(I think I'm losing my mind and there's no changing this)
It's not going to stop until I'm dead
(not gonna stop until I'm dead!)

There's not enough room in here for the two of us
I say right (you say wrong)
I say love (you say hate it all)
So who do I believe?
(why is there no way out?)

[2x]
This is not the last time I'll say it
(I think I'm losing my mind and there's no changing this)
It's not going to stop until I'm dead
(not gonna stop until I'm dead!)

I've been trying so hard for so long and I think itâs hopeless

I need a new reality
There must be some way out of this mess
I need a new reality
But there's no way out

This is not the last time I'll say it
(I think I'm losing my mind and there's no changing this)
It's not going to stop until I'm dead
(not gonna stop until I'm dead!)

I've gotta find a way to live like this
I think Iâm losing my mind and thereâs no changing this.
Itâs not going to stop until Iâm dead.
(not gonna stop until I'm dead!)
