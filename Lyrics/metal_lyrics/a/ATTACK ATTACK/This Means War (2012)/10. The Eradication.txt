Where do you draw the line?
You think you can walk all over me?
Go ahead and tell the world Iâm dead, it wonât make a difference.

I'm coming to find you, we're all coming to find you
I'm coming to find you, we're all coming to find you

Our time has come, we're taking over (hey! hey! hey!)
We're done with being patient, no time for second chances

There's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You only have one option;
Come out here and face me like a man

I'm coming to find you, we're all coming to find you
I'm coming to find you, we're all coming to find you

Our time has come, we're taking over (hey! hey! hey!)
We're done with being patient, no time for second chances
So listen up now, we're taking over (hey! hey! hey!)
We're done with being patient, it's time to take a stand

You think you control me?
Well I can't be stopped, I can't be stopped
This pain is coming to an end, this pain is coming to an end

Our time has come, we're taking over (hey! hey! hey!)
We're done with being patient, no time for second chances
So listen up now, we're taking over (hey! hey! hey!)
We're done with being patient, it's time to take a stand
