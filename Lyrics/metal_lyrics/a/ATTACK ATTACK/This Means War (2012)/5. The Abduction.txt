Yeah!
Come on!

So now my son is in the hands of a murderer
If you think you'll ever get away with this, you'll have another thing coming

I'll do all that it takes to get to you
This is my flesh and blood, my one and only son
Now losing's not an option
It looks like fighting for you is what I'm called to do

I'm running a race against the clock
Every moment that passes by, could be a moment too late
I don't know where to start, but I know where it will end...
With you back in my arms

And when I find you, I'm gonna teach you what the meaning of pain is
I won't stop until it's over

I'll do all that it takes to get to you
This is my flesh and blood, my one and only son
Now losing's not an option
It looks like fighting for you, is what I'm called to do

I don't care what you say, I don't care where you hide,
I am going to find you,
And I'm going to help you realize that you've made a big mistake

I will find my son, so give it up!

(Oohhaa!)

Go!
Give it up!
