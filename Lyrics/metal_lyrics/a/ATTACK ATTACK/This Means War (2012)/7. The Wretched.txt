Thereâs somebody else inside my head
Heâs telling me to give up
Heâs telling me to give up
Iâm being taken down from the inside out
I think Iâm gonna die here

I need you now when nothingâs making sense

This time it's not my perspective
Thereâs something wrong with me
I canât seem to agree

Letâs face the facts, shall we?
My life, my life will never be the same
Thereâs no time to make a change
Iâm hopeless, Iâm broken
I'm beaten, bruised and bleeding
Oh God, where are you now?

I need you now when nothingâs making sense

This time it's not my perspective
Thereâs something wrong with me
I canât seem to agree

And I know itâs just what youâre thinking
Thereâs something wrong with me
I canât seem to agree

Iâve put it all on the line for you
Iâve put my life on the line for you
Iâve put my life on the line for you
So why did you say goodbye to me?

This time it's not my perspective
Thereâs something wrong with me
I canât seem to agree

And I know itâs just what youâre thinking
Thereâs something wrong with me
And I canât seem to agree
