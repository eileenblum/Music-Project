I've given all that I have to give
Taken all of the lives that I can.
Will this be my life?
(There's no end in sight)
Where are all of my brothers now?

I'll fight this war alone
If that's what it takes to get home to you.
I'll fight this war alone.

I've lost control again
And the night is closing in.
How do I keep my feet on the floor,
When I'm in over my head?
How can I fight a war?
'Cause I have you to come home to.

Take a step back and finally think for yourself,
You're living your life full of lying.
I'm over this process
Of letting my life be run by your desire.

I'll fight this war alone
'Cause that's what it takes to get home to you
I'll fight this war alone

I've lost control again
And the night is closing in.
I've gotta be whole within
So my life is mine again.

How do I keep my feet on the floor,
When I'm in over my head?
How can I fight a war?
'Cause I have you to come home to.
'Cause I have you to come home to.
'Cause I have you to come home to.

I'm never gonna give up hope.
I'm never gonna give up hope.
I'm never gonna give up hope.
I'll never give up until I'm dead.
And if you want me to you'll have to take my life.

I'll fight this war alone [4x]
