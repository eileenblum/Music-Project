So when did you decide
To take over my life,
To make me a slave,
And take my family away from me?

I fought for years because of you,
Taking so many lives to save my own
So if you have a reason,
You better speak up now

It seems you've been hiding all this time (this time)
Telling everybody you're their savior, when all you wanted was to take their lives

Do you know all the suffering that I've been through?
Or all the faces that haunt me?
I'll never be able to sleep again
I lay awake in my bed, thinking about what I did to have...
So if you have a reason, you better speak up now

It seems you've been hiding all this time (this time)
Telling everybody you're their savior, when all you wanted was to take their lives
It seems you've been hiding all this time (this time)
Telling everybody you're their savior, when all you wanted was to take their lives

This is your last chance, so give me the reason to believe you
You only get one chance, so give me the reason to believe you

No more running away
No more running away

It seems you've been hiding all this time (this time)
Telling everybody you're their savior, when all you wanted was to take their lives
It seems you've been hiding all this time (this time)
Telling everybody you're their savior, when all you wanted was to take their lives
