Go!

This ignorance I have is not enough to bleed me dry forever
because slowly but surely I'm finding out the truth

You've been doing all you can to hold me down
I'm standing strong
With all of my friends at my side
This is all that I have to hold on to
But it's enough to get me through this

This arrogance won't be enough
To fuel your plans to conquer us
We have the strength to take you down

I've never believed you
We never trusted anything you said

You've been doing all you can to hold me down
I'm standing strong
With all of my friends at my side
This is all that I have to hold on to
But it's enough to get me through this

You can cut the tongue from my mouth so I'll never speak again
Do what you want to stop me
I'm never gonna back down from you!

I've got you right where I want you
We've got you right where we want you
