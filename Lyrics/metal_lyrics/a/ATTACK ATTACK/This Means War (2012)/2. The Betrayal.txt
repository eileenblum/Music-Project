Get up!

How can you say you never knew me?
I put my life on the line to keep this family alive.
Hour after hour. Day after day.
Where's the meaning? Where's the passion?

Where's the passion?

Don't try to say you've forgotten about me.
I know the thought of us is creeping in your mind.
You drove me crazy, now there's no maybe.
So grab your guns, and pick a side.

'Cause this means war!
This means war.

I'm going to turn around and walk right out the door,
And in your mind you've never seen my face before.
Somehow they've made you believe, believe in the lie.

Don't let them take me away.
Don't let them take me away.
Don't let them take me away.
Oh God don't let them take me.

Don't try to say you've forgotten about me.
I know the thought of us is creeping in your mind.
You drove me crazy, now there's no maybe.
So grab your guns, and pick a side.

After all that they've put me through,
I just wanna come back to you.
After all that they've put me through,
Just remember me!
Remember me!

Come on,

Just remember me!
