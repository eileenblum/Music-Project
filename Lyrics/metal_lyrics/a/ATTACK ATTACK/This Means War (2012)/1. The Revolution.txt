Start the revolution
Start the revolution
Start the revolution
Start the revolution

For the first time I understand what it means to have taken a life
I don't think I can handle this, I feel my sanity slipping away

All is lost
Everything's been taken away from me
All is lost
Everything that I've known is gone

Can you hear the voices in your head?
Listen to what they're saying

There's no more time to be wasted
Cause I've wasted all my life
Giving in to the sin when I had a mind.
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

Thereâs the blood of another man on my hands (on my hands)
Why do I feel so comfortable? What's happening to me?

All is lost
Everything's been taken away from me
All is lost
Everything that I love is gone

Can you hear the voices in your head?
Listen to what they're saying
I can hear the voices in my head
Listen to what they're saying

[2x]
There's no more time to be wasted
Cause I've wasted all my life
Giving in to the sin when I had a mind.
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa

You've never been where I've been,
You've never seen what I've seen
You've never had to spend a day with a cage around your mind
Just set me free

(Set me free)

Start the revolution
Start the revolution
Start the revolution
Start the revolution
