NO!

OH!

AHH!

You never said that this would be easy, that this would be,
So go on live
You never said that this would be easy, that this would be easy
So go on live

WOOO!

This is the best part of the message
And it only took one

We live for what he's worth
And that's more than you'll know
He died for what he loved
And what he loved was you

I'll wait for you
You know I'll wait for you
You know I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
You know I'll wait for you
You know I'll wait for you

You never said that this would be easy, that this would be,
So go on live
You never said that this would be easy, that this would be easy
So go on live

Bow your head
Go on live

This is the time to let yourself go
Lord, pick me off the ground
You never said this would be simple
So pull me in and turn around
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh, oh

You never said this would be simple
That this would be.
