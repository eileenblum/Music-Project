Oh the blood, oh the blood, oh the massacre
Oh the blood, oh the blood, oh the massacre

Your love will run and hide
And leave me on my own
The true ones will fall
So hard, baby
And that's why this hurts
Lies, all this time, only lies.

I always thought that you would be the one
But, baby, just give me a chance
I always thought that you would be the one
But, baby, just give me a chance

This is the last chance you get what you want,
And I'll never be the one to turn on you,
And I get what I want, and I said,
I'll do anything, anything for you

I've torn apart this possibility
From one-night stands
You'd give it away for just one night
I'd give you all I had

I always thought that you would be the one,
But, baby, just give me a chance
I always thought that you would be the one,
But, baby, just give me a chance

Oh the blood, oh the blood, oh the massacre
Oh the blood, oh the blood, oh the massacre
