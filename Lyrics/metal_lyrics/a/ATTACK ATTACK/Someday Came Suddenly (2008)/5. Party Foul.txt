You lied
To me
You tried
To be
Everything I would want
But everything you couldn't be

The two worlds that you have made,
Have suddenly collided,
So you'll have the chance to lead,
A new life...

Everything that I would want,
Everything you couldn't be.

This is your cop-out to your life,
I'll be the end of everything you love,
It rips my heart out and I can't take anymore,
Heart out, I'm lying on the floor.

I can't
I can't believe this
I can't
I can't believe this

I can't
I can't believe this
I can't believe this is happening
I can't believe that this is happening to me
I thought that you would be, everything I need.

The two worlds that you have made,
Have suddenly collided,
So youâll have the chance to lead a new life

You want me back now that I'm on my own again.
