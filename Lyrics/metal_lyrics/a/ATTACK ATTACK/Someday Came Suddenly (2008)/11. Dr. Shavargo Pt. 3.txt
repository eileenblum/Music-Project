As always
It's all for you
As always
It's all for you
As always
It's all for you
As always

I'm all yours
Just take me now
I'm all yours
Just take me now
I'll rip out your heart
And your eyes until
You see the love I have inside
For you, carry on this way
and I will go and learn the truth.
I will go and let this down for me,
And it's all for you,
Take me never let me go,
Take me, I'll go and seek the truth

I cannot live without you near
I can't go on without you here
You're the reason why
Simply, because you're everything
I want and more

Take my hand,
I'll keep you safe,
Take my hand
Take my hand,
I'll keep you safe,
Take my hand

The truth will set you free,
Just hold my hand,
I'll keep you safe,
I know you're confused,
But I will always
Refuse to take you for granted

I'll rip out your heart and your eyes until,
You see the love I have inside,
For you, carry on this way, 'til you will go
And see the truth.

Come on girl,
I've been waiting for you to make your move
Come on girl,
I've been waiting for you to make your move

As always it's all for you
As always it's all for you
