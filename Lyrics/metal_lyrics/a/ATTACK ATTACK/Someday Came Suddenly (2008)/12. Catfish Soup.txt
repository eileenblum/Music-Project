Again and again sing this song that we live,
it's all we have to go off of.
This is a nightmare come to life,
this is something you'll regret at times.
When you see there's an end tonight.
Just think about this now,
as we come to an end.
The decisions you have,
made will come back to haunt you,
and as the story ends and
you look to the sky,
this couldn't have happened by chance.
And Here's your escape as
He Calls out your name,
you fall to your knees
and answer his call.
But Here's your escape,
He calls out your name, you fall to your knees,
and answer His call.

Lord I will be anything for you.

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, saved by grace. [2x]

Hallelujah, I've been saved by grace,
Hallelujah, saved by grace.
and this is why, I've been saved,
by His grace.

Just think about this now,
as we come to an end.
The decisions you have,
made will come back to haunt you,
and as the story ends and
you look to the sky,
this couldn't have happened by chance.
