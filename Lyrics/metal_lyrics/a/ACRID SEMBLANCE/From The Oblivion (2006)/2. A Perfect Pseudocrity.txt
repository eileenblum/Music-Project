As I fall through the depths of this abyss inside
A cold swirl devours me of my last drop of sense
Fallen way beyond from the archaic heights
I now see no black, only see colours so blind

Reason obliviates emotion, lust obliviates lust
Time obliviates touch, numbness I left in thy crust

I see the pain in your eyes, eating you from deep inside
Guiding you to the scenes you've seen, again they light the torch of misery
I see the pain in your eyes, feel my burning touch in your thighs
Leaving you in the abyss of demise, fight thy haunting guilts tonight

From a sense so vivid, from a life so rheotic
I now live a life, emptied by pseudocrity
Perfection, thy desire, unholy cry for lust,
I see thy fixated to the chains of disgust

Reason obliviates emotion, lust obliviates lust
Time obliviates touch, numbness I left in thy crust

I see the pain in your eyes, eating you from deep inside
Guiding you to the scenes you've seen, again they light the torch of misery
I see the pain in your eyes, feel my burning touch in your thighs
Leaving you in the abyss of demise, fight thy haunting guilts tonight

Reason obliviates emotion, lust obliviates lust
Time obliviates touch, numbness I left in thy crust

I see the pain in your eyes, eating you from deep inside
Guiding you to the scenes you've seen, again they light the torch of misery
I see the pain in your eyes, feel my burning touch in your thighs
Leaving you in the abyss of demise, fight thy haunting guilts tonight
