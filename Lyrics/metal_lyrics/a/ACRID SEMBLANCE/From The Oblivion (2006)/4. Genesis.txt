On our road we move into existence
We move towards extinction
Corroding every day, day by day
Living our sadistic life this day

Genesis, is all I need
Let's start off again
There is no other way for you
Genesis, just die again
Kill what all ever did exist
There is no other way for you

What use this lifeless lump?
What use thy open casket?
As we fight against the will
Of the one that still controls

Genesis, is all I need
Let's start off again
There is no other way for you
Genesis, just die again
Kill what all ever did exist
There is no other way for you

[Solo: Kshitish]
[Solo: Anubhav]

Die! You Now!
You lived, this life too long!
Die just now,
You've seen this treachery through your eyes!
Die, you die
Cause You! Have lived for long
Die! You've seen, this treachery, through your eyes!

End now is still too far
Beginnings are too off shore
My past haunts me still
Do I need the end once more?

Genesis, is all I need
Let's start off again
There is no other way for you
Genesis, just die again
Kill what all ever did exist
There is no other way for you
