Here we lie gazing the eternal ecstasy
So near, yet so far beyond our grasp
See nothing that's closer than you think
Hold its tail, and move behind, go where is all beyond mankind.

We see memories walking by
We see the demons ignoring me
We see the angels extend their arms
We say goodbye to all that came our way

Wake up...and find the truth
Wake up...from illusion
Too cruel...yet too true
Too cruel...yet so close
In Ashes... they remain
From ashes...they rise
Oh mirror... oh mirror
Who is the sanest of us all

Frightened by dreamy nights unholy nightmares follow
You pray to god, the lord of thunder and demise
Night's awake, demons crawls, I wait for lies that live beneath you.
Cry denial, meet demise, a sweet pain that binds us all to death.

We see memories walking by
We see the demons ignoring me
We see the angels extend their arms
We say goodbye to all that came our way

Wake up...and find the truth
Wake up...from illusion
Too cruel...yet too true
Too cruel...yet so close
In Ashes... they remain
From ashes...they rise
Oh mirror... oh mirror
Who is the sanest of us all

A tender prey, tries to sway

Inflated are now their minds, I find
Eats out my heart and soul, turning blind
stop this war!

A tender prey, tries to sway

Diminution in the skies left behind
perspirating pain and fear in their eyes
Inflicting anguish
