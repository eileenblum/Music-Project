Far away from the dark skies, drops the veil on my real life
Life it saw from your first blood, cackle as it dies for a new dawn.
Rooted deep to my words, beneath the mask of joy
Passion grows, for the route to infinity

I walk, no hope, no fear, no sight
Blind Me... Guide Me...
Darkness, open my eyes.

I crawl, then die, it flows, you cry
They cry, not shy
Screams rise, you fall

Time is short for me, I have to go I believe
I hear their cries, from the oblivion they rise

Burns down at the sight of the maddening moonlight
Shallow words, beneath my wounds
I find you right there, for your prey
Guards down, you hurt me bad

I walk, no hope, no fear, no sight
Blind Me... Guide Me...
Darkness, open my eyes.

I crawl, then die, it flows, you cry
They cry, not shy
Screams rise, you fall

Time is short for me I have to go I believe
I hear their cries, from the oblivion they rise
Words might be short, as they hit you hard
To deaf ears its my final call

Time is short for me I have to go I believe
I hear their cries, from the oblivion they rise
Words might be short, as they hit you hard
To deaf ears its my final call..
