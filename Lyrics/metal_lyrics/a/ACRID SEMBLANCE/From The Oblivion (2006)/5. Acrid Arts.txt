Plain truth your mind,
Says you're thyself,
Your mind says what,
Not your face did personify...

You are not you, but someone else...
Someone else's reflection
Reflection of what can't be, true these Acrid Arts

It's all said but done...
For what mind fears is pain
Pain and sorrow, do they know
They are still my best friends

You are not you, but someone else...
Someone else's reflection
Reflection of what can't be, true these Acrid Arts

[Solo: Vikas]
[Solo: Kshitish]

Every day as I rise, concealing the lies
Where we go from here, memories walking by

[Solo harmony: Vikas and Anubhav]

A moment of denial, of an emotion
A time for the peripheral to become central
A joy, not faced by, tears far left behind
Look back, to collect, the pictures of your time.
