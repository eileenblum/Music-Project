I've started to lose myself
I've started to give away my self
I've started to move towards perpetually
Towards the worlds that pull me away from you

[Solo: Vikas]

As you hate me more
I feel secure
Audacious as I may sound
But your succulence is what keeps me spellbound

Burning the Ashes of a whole lifetime
Burning the Ashes of my existence
Burning the Ashes of your uneasiness
Burning the Ashes of my haunting proximity

[Solo: Anubhav]
[Solo: Kshitish]

Beneath you sow the seeds of insecurity
High above you feel the moment of unease
Deep Down I'm drinking my last goblet of the pain
Burning the Ashes of one to never exist

Burning the Ashes of a whole lifetime
Burning the Ashes of my existence
Burning the Ashes of your uneasiness
Burning the Ashes of my haunting proximity
