[Lyrics: Anubhav,Kshitish, Music: Vikas]

As the world I see shrink to the point where we exist
We reach a point of nothingness and selffulness
Our point of faliure, is to high to experience
We can't live this way to just exist

We are baptised, In our own thoughts
We move inside, the demon sees it all

[Chorus:]

I kill myself
I just can't die
I just can't feel the end
Of my own time

I try again
The soul won't go away
12 faliures I've tried
Another Suicide attempt

As the worlds collapse, by its own roots
Imposed Upon me what the world to see in me
Though I percieve, change my thoughts for their thoughts
Here I am clapsed claws, mylife that's all
