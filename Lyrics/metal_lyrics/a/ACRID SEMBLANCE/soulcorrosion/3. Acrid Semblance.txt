[Lyrics: Kshitish, Music: Kshitish]

Throughout time eternal
On our never ending journeys we wonder (on existence)
Crossing all the barriers
Bridging all the gaps we outgrow ourselves

How We Corrode
Fall Prey to The clutches of this world
Never to be born again.

As we lift the curtain of illusions
We see an acrid semblance of life
An image far from unseen
Empty as it could be
Degraded by our thoughts
Erased by our lust

We reach a point
From where cries sound (far off) and faint.
Everyday we find new wounds that plague and haunt

How we corrode
Fall prey to the clutches of this world
Never to be born again

As we lift the curtain of illusions
We see an acrid semblance of life
An image far from unseen
Empty as it could be
Degraded by our thoughts
Erased by our lust.
