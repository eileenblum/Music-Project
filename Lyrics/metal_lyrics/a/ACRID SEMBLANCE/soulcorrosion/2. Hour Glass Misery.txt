[Lyrics: Anubhav, Music:Vikas,Anubhav]

I am here in this cradle of my misery
Lying beyond the all ecstasy
My words betray my sorrow
To search this tunnel till its hollow

[Chorus:]
What do we see?
(pain)
What do we do?
(run)
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

Run now, you must dieâ¦
Lye down, Must face the skyâ¦
Hour Glass is running high
It's your Hour Glass Misery

Fight Now, before its comes down,
Hide far, before it figures you outâ¦

[Chorus:]
What do we see?
(pain)
What do we do?
(run)
Where do we go?
Where do we go?

Here you areâ¦
Inside your very ownâ¦
Cage
Made by your very ownâ¦
Ghouls

Now run, where can you go
