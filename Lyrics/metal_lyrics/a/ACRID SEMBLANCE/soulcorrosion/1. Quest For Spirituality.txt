[Lyrics:Anubhav, Music:Vikas]

On our way to our final destinyâ¦
We see our days closing soonâ¦
We search for reasons,
To why we existâ¦
Just couldn't find the right answers insideâ¦

[Chorus:]
As I Quest For Spirituality
I see the lightâ¦
The halo of the dark inside
As we search for the end to all of this 
We fall deep into pit we made for itâ¦
We close our eyes to our doom
And thus we fall more and more deep inâ¦

As we search for a guiding lightâ¦
We see a figure in the dark
(Dark) Corners of our very own thoughts
(Thoughts) Are full of hope and pain (or they're same?)

[Chorus:]
As I Quest For Spirituality
I see the lightâ¦
The halo of the dark inside
As we search for the end to all of this 
We fall deep into pit we made for itâ¦
We close our eyes to our doom
And thus we fall more and more deep inâ¦

As my quest draws furtherâ¦
My spirit moves backâ¦
My pain is replacedâ¦
As my spirit moves to its roots
Grown with seeds of despair
I move a step closeâ¦

[Chorus:]
As I Quest For Spirituality
I see the lightâ¦
The halo of the dark inside
As we search for the end to all of this 
We fall deep into pit we made for itâ¦
We close our eyes to our doom
And thus we fall more and more deep inâ¦
Guided by the disguisedâ¦
Guided by misery
Guided by failure
Guided by lust

[Chorus:]
As I Quest For Spirituality
I see the lightâ¦
The halo of the dark inside
