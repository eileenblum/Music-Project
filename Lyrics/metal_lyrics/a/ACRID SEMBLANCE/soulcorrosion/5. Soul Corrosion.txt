[Lyrics: Vikas, Music: Vikas]

Spent my days in agony
All those years come haunting me
wasted years of blasphemy
i do finally see it

salvation in opacity
judging by my own reality
lost in this world of phalusy
blazin serpents twistin my head

[chorus]
soul corrosion
eating out my heart and wisdom
retribution
seekin a light in this holy daze
soul corrosion
on towards the pit of emptiness
disintegration
wearin out my inner sanctum

w/ every breath it's growin strong
thoughts wrestle in a swan song
can't find myself in this dreaded fog
all the demons lurkin somewhere

save me fom this spell of hell
burnin questions as the seconds fell
my own enemy my other self
seems my moment's finally here

[chorus]
