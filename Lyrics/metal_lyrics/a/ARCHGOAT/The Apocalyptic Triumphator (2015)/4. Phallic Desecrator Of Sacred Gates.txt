I'll ride the Flesh of the Whore,
The twin Pillars of her supple Thighs,
Spit on the Whore made Virgin,
Conceive the Woman of Nazareth.

The Chalice of Sacred Nectar,
The Altar between the silken Thighs,
Drink deep that heavenly Wine,
Worship and adore the Fleshy Gate.

Crushing the Petals of Sacredness,
Pounded into Oblivion again and again,
Each strike of My Phallic Hammer,
Sinks the Heavenliness to Lust.
