Lord of the Northern Sky,
Come forth behind Draconis,
The Great Black Dragon,
God of the cold and barred.

Rush forward Conqueror,
From the Shadows of Winter.
Lord of Beasts and Serpents,
Bearer of blackened Light.

Illuminated by the 7 Stars,
The Embracer of Storms,
Bring Your Blessing,
Of Darkness leading to the End.

A Day of Death,
A Day of Gloominess,
A Day of Graves,
And thick Darkness.

The Headless Cherubs fall,
Their Wings cut and broken,
Personification of Black Radiance,
The Apocalyptic Triumphator.
