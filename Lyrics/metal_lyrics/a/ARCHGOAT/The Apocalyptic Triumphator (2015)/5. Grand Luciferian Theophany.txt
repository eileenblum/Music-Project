Crawl the Path I walked,
Follow my Footsteps,
Burn the Semen as Sacrifice,
For Your Rite of Passage.

Through the Obsidian Gates,
Inside the Flames of Knowledge,
Join with the Darkness,
In the Circle of Summoning.

Hail Satan,
Hail Lucifer,
Hail Satan.

Hail Satan,
Hail Lucifer,
Hail Satan.

Sacred Cup of Knowledge,
Offered to My Ashen lips,
The Key to the Powers in Reach,
Theophany of Lucifer's Might.

Reborn as Might Incarnated,
Hail Lucifer, Father of Wisdom.
A new God in the Flesh.
Hail Lucifer, Lord of Earth.

Black Flame of Awakening,
And glowing Spheres of Abyss,
Eclipse the Faces of God,
As Wisdom carves the Weakness.
