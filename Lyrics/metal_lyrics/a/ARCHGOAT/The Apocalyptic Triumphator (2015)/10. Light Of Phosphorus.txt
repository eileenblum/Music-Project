I walk as if in Dream,
To the Source of the Stream,
As I wash in the knowledge,
My Mind clears from Illusion.

Flow through My Soul,
The Spirit of the Dawn,
Enter My Temples Gate,
The Angelic Spirits of Air.

Light of Phosphorus.

Blaze through Me,
The Spirit of the Dawn.

My Soul descends and hails,
The Lord of Silver Star,
As I drift closer to You,
The Darkness entangles Me.

As I stand by Your Presence,
I am bound to You eternally,
My Bones are of Your Bones,
My Flesh is of Your Flesh.

Light of Phosphorus.

Blaze through Me,
The Spirit of the Dawn.
I dwell inside Your Light,
In the Passage to the Morning Star.
