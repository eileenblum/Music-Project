Christ's Brides wide proclaim,
Ruin through your Savior slain,
God's Peace now obscured,
Smothered by the Light of the Night.

Praise and adore,
With Darkness revel,
Fall of Pureness,
The great Profanation.

NUNS, CUNTS &amp; DARKNESS.

The Whores now wear the Crown,
Their Halos adorned with Sin,
Unveiling Their Eternal Flowers,
Mount the Form Divine.

Open up Your Angelic Mouth,
That sang the Christ's Hymns,
Eat the Snake of Wisdom,
Swallow the Nectar of Rebellion.
