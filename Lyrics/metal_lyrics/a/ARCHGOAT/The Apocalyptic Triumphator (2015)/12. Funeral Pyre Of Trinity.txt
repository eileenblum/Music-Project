See the towering Churches,
The Christian Monuments,
Of the heavenly Oppression,
Caressed by the Flames of Hades.

Funeral Pyre of Trinity.

Winds carry, The blazing Ash,
As to celebrate,
The Conqueror of the Death,
Of Heavenly God, Who shall,
Forever be gone.

Funeral Pyre of Trinity.

I deny God and Your Religion.
I curse, blaspheme and provoke God with all despite,
I give My Faith to the Devil and My Worship and offer sacrifice to Him.

I do solemnly vow and promise all my progeny unto the Devil,
I swear to the Devil to bring as many into His Society as I can,
I will always swear in the Name of the Devil.
