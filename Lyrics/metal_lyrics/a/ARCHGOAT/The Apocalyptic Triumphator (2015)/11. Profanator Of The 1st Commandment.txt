I am the Temple of Darkness,
Born from the Dawn of Light,
My Kingdom is made from My Sins,
Freed by the Blood in My Veins.

I am the Son of Belial,
Child of Doom and Perdition.
My Throat is Open Grave;
My Words are Blasphemy.

Venom of Asps in My Lips,
Challenge the Wrath of God.
I drink of the Wine of the Wrath,
I am the Sword of Vengeance.

I am swift to shed Your Blood,
Ruin and Misery bloom in My Path,
There is no Fear of God in My Eyes,
All Sheep have turned aside.
