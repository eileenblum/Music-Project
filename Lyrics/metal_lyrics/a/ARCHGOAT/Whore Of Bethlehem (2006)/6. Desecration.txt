Servant of dying angel
Symphony of impurity
Once I was next to Father
Now my mangled corpse
Decoration impaled
At the gates of traitors
Purest white soul
Stained and taken from heaven

DESECRATION

Slain corpse's slain soul
Disappearing into might of oblivion
Darkness ate the light
Hoof tramples the crucifix
Holy word won't reach here
Cry of archangel won't reach here
Holy father won't wipe your tears
For the gates shall be closed

Sacrament of Blasphemy
Hymns of Debauchery
Liturgies of Destruction
