Sodomatic rituals of desecration
Lambs of hypocrisy, of Christian lies
Bow to blasphemy, in front of horned god
Eternal torment, profanity of church

Molesting the son of blind idiot god
In the shadow, of mighty wings
The pleas bring denied, cries for father
None shall hear, the lamentation

Angel of sodomy
Angel of sodomy

Black flame of destruction
Searing the faithful soul
Holy shall perish
Burned to their chapels
Deny the word
Written lies of tyrant
Await the judgement
Of sodomatic rites.
