[Dedicated to Gilles de Rais]

After abandoning the white whore
Sodomatic sacrifice, Death rituals
Huge grin to know the Black Arts
Black magic and tortured children

Torturing you, twisted and desecrated
Sodomising you, the innocent flesh
Confronting you, your pain is not in vain
Sacrificing you, to please the Devil

Come on oh little and innocent
I shall grant you the Pleasures unknown
I shall be your Tormentor supreme
I shall grant your existence a meaning

Taking my pleasure as the child dies
Kissing the lips now so cold
Eyes empty and hollow staring back
I am the Grand Marshall of Hell

Torturing you, twisted and desecrated
Sodomising you, the innocent flesh
Confronting you, your pain is not in vain
Sacrificing you, to please the Devil
