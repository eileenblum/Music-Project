I am the bringer of the luciferian light
I am creator of his eternal darkness
Devoted myself to his esoteric wisdom
Inside I burn with the black flame

For thy honour
Black mass prayers
For thy glory
Rituals of darkness

The darkness to the weak and fools
Light for the elite who ran ser

I cast my black aura
Against all white light
