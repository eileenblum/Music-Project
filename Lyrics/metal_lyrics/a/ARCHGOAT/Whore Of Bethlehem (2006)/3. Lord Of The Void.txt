I am the lord of emptiness
Raised to god by rats and mice
The worthless weed of humanity
Praising the blind idiot god
My son, killed by mortal men
Called once the messiah
His mother is the wholy whore
Why have I been blasphemed

I am the line for the to follow
The vast sea without the bottom
The horizon as far as I can see
I am the lord of the void

I am god
of nothing
