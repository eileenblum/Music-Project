The torch of Baphomet
Brightest in the sky
The eternal fire
Of terrestrial life
Invocation rite
Seven gradual psalms
Appear with flames
Praise to the true god
Make no Christian signs
Speak no Christian words
Funeral trumpet winds
Black torches flare
Goat-headed prince bounds
Forward among us he ascends
This is my worship
This is my path
Goat and the moon
