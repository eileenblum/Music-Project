The scarred messiah
In human Flesh
Mocked and scourged
King of the Jews
Carrying his cross
To the place of skulls
The Final Trail
The last condemnation
Blood
That flowed from Jesus Christ
The crown
Thorns set upon his head
The Nails
Nailed to the tree of the cross
The bitter scars
Of betrayed bereft man
And the sixth hour
The Darkness fell
The time is at hand
Last hour of Jesus Christ
The nothingness of heaven
May his name be cursed
Slain lamb, triumph to his fall
Expelled from their kingdom
