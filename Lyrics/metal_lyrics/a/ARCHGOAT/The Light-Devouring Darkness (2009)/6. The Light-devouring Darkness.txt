Belives of the lowliness
Of Christ's false holiness
Those weak of the soul
Earth you shall eat
The light devouring darkness
the great fallen spirits
Gratification of their lust
The virgin shall conceive
Him who denies Jesus Christ
Hail the great triumphant one
In his own name he comes
Burning down the seven churches
All the world worship the beast
Conquest, slaughter, dearth and death
The lamb, the woman and her seed
Cast in the pool of eternal flames
She spiritual darkness now shall reign
