Barren and lifeless Womb,
Carrying the spoiled Seed,
Conceived not by the Spirit,
But by the Flesh of a Man,
From putrid Semen,
The foul Nazarene was born,
Thrown into Torture,
In Misery and Affliction.

The Ritual starts,
When the Stars are aligned,
Fallen Priest arises,
Death is nothing to us.

Burn the Sacred Relics,
Their Religions pride,
Condemn weakened souls,
Jesus lowly followers.

The eternal Damnation of Christ,
To whom no Praise is chanted,
The eternal Damnation of Christ,
To whom no Incense is burned.
