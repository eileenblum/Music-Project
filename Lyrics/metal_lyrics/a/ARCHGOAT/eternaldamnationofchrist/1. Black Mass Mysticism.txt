Summoning Ritual,
In the Darkness,
Light the Black Candles,
Darker than Obsidian Veils,
Witches and Warlocks,
The Black robed Circle,
Praying and chanting,
Lucifer's name... Lucifer's name...
Lucifer's name... Lucifer's name...

Lucifer's name...

Black Mass prayers,
Trample the Cross of Christ,
A blackened Image,
Son of the Morning Star,
The Great Creator,
And his ceaseless beams,
Of glorious Light,
Enshrouding the Eternal God.

Come now and drink,
From the Chalice of Knowledge,
Worship the Pale Moon,
Honor the forbidden Gods.

Dance... around the... fire,
The... burning... Darkness,
We... conjure thee... Spirit,
Our... souls... belong to... Darkness.

The Sacrifice burns,
Inside the Magical Circle,
Rejoice with glory,
The Great Grand Serpent.
