Dive inside
An open mind,
And open soul
With many little faces.
You glue yourself
To a broken wall
And crack your bones
With countless little nails...

Live a life of joy
Die a tiny death...

Do me a favour
And lie on your back,
So I can replace
Your face with a picture..
I count on this world,
While you count on a stranger,
Becoming the past
And touching the void...

Live in your own breath
Break and self-destroy...
