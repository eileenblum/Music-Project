Wait for a crooked hand, emerging from the oil
To grasp your tiny neck and tear it apart
No more tears, you fucked up piece of meat!
'Cause heaven calls, heaven roars "welcome aboard!"

Watch the angels laugh and dance
As soldiers die and women cry
Along with people's blinded eyes,
So beautiful and useless...

Wait for your head to land on a neat and tidy scaffold
So you can bleed your way to the land of paradise
Tell me the words you hear in your tortured swollen brain
Maybe I hear them too and we are both insane!

Come with me into the water
Let your body float in peace
Take my hand and sleep forever
Becoming one with the midnight breeze

Dive inside
Your open mind,
Your open soul,
Your open heart
And fly above
The world you created.

Come with me into the water
Let your body float in peace
Take my hand and sleep forever
Becoming one with the midnight breeze
