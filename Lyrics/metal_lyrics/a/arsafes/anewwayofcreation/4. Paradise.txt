I opened my mind
And led my way
To the junctions of space
All I had I left behind
So nothing could rip me
From grace...

I ask the stars and skies
Why did I tear my skin when the angel cried?

Close your eyes,
For none you will see..
You let the fire burn me down,
You broke my paradise...

In the center of my universe
I found your image in the light
All alone... just all alone,
I thought I'd never find anything so bright...

I ask the stars and skies
Why did I tear my skin when the angel cried?

Close your eyes,
For none you will see..
You let the fire burn me down,
You broke my paradise...
