All the windows are closed
Fright is the weapon, the weapon he chose
No more food for the poor
Only corruption, blindfolds and force

Don't you dare to look back
Hounds of the king are prepared to attack
Daggers sharper than serpent's teeth,
Steel tears you skin and the soil turns black

One an only ruler of worms
Spreading your disease
One and only thief on the throne,
You shall die on your knees

I gather the horde
Of harlots, demons, troops of blight
I gather the horde
Of poison-blooded scum
I gather the horde
Of spirits, darker than the night
To crush the will
Of the traitor's bastard son

Son of evil, behold
You are a coward, drowning in gold
For your personal needs
You are ready to set fire to the whole world

One an only ruler of worms
Spreading your disease
One and only thief on the throne,
You shall die on your knees

I gather the horde
Of harlots, demons, troops of blight
I gather the horde
Of poison-blooded scum
I gather the horde
Of spirits, darker than the night
To crush the will
Of the traitor's bastard son
