You consume the seas,
You consume the skies
You make the heavens fall down
You breathe in the flames
As they melt my skin,
Burning my bones to the ground

Don't let it go
Don't let it leave you on your own
All alone in the dark
Don't let it go
Don't let it feed on the unknown
As you drown below the ark
Don't let it go!

Can I see your face?
Can I feel your touch,
The touch of false ecstasy?
Let me see your smile
As I crucify
What's left of my destiny

Don't let it go
Don't let it leave you on your own
All alone in the dark
Don't let it go
Don't let it feed on the unknown
As you drown below the ark
Don't let it go!
