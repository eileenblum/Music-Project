All creatures of the night
Shall walk away from me cause
I illuminate the sky
My fire burns away your fear
And puts it on its knees
Leaving your demons to die

As I look back again
I see the crooked life
Of the mob under layers of sin.
Those who shall take my hand
Will be finally free!
We'll fly away on the wings of the wind!

I came to tear your shackles down
I came to set you free cause
You dared to open your eyes
The slave became the master
Of it's destiny
The slave shall finally rise

As I look back again
I see the crooked life
Of the mob under layers of sin.
Those who shall take my hand
Will be finally free!
We'll fly away on the wings of the wind!

Of the mob under layers of sin.
