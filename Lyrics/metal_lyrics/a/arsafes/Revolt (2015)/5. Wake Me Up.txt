If there's a way to go
Why aren't you still free?
Too many walls surround you
Walls you cannot see

If there's a way to go
Then why is it so dark
This tunnel leads to hell -
I see the burning mark

I walk all alone
In a world made of sorrow
Betrayed and torn,
All the souls stare from below
I walk all alone,
Always hope for tomorrow
To wake me,
To wake me up

If there's a way to start
Living from square one
To change the world,
Make it brighter than the sun

If there's a way to live
Above the filth and lies
Then there's a way to
Fly higher than the sky

I walk all alone
In a world made of sorrow
Betrayed and torn,
All the souls stare from below
I walk all alone,
Always hope for tomorrow
To wake me,
To wake me up

As all your thoughts
Bring you to a state of apathy,
Your self-destruction mechanism fires

There's no way to go
From the legacy of history
You are a grain of universal sand
All hopes drown in the rancid pool of liberty
As you see your life in enemies' hands

Self deliverance
Through self destruction
As a choice of the crooked weak
Free the mechanism of malfunction
Let the trigger speak

I walk all alone
In a world made of sorrow
Betrayed and torn,
All the souls stare from below
I walk all alone,
Always hope for tomorrow
To wake me,
To wake me up
