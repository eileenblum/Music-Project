Just let them live
Just let them live their lives
Just let them live
They are not bred to die
Just let them live
You have no right to kill
Just let them live
Free from your will

You save the world from a
Prospering place that doesn't need you
You save the world from a
Part of humanity
You save the world from
Borders just because you can break through
While people die to fulfill your vanity

Why can't you see
Your lies don't heal our scars
Why can't you see
Your terror's gone too far
Why can't you see
You dug a million graves
Why can't you see
You dug them for your slaves

You save the world from a
Prospering place that doesn't need you
You save the world from a
Part of humanity
You save the world from
Borders just because you can break through
While people die just to prove your insanity

Save the world from your guns
Save the world from your bombs
Save the world from your force-fed freedom
Save the world from yourself

You save the world from a
Prospering place that doesn't need you
You save the world from a
Part of humanity
You save the world from
Borders just because you can break through
While people die to fulfill your vanity

You save the world
