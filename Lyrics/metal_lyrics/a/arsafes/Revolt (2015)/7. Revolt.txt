I lead the way
I lead my own way to freedom
I lead the way
I have my own fucking math
I made my own
I made my personal Eden
I made my own
I made my own fucking path

I have no fucking master
I have no fucking lord
I shall bring a great disaster to the global protocol
I cannot not kneel, I shall revolt!

I cannot be a slave, I can't obey the lord
I cannot wear the shackles, that I wore before
I cannot be a soldier in a mindless war
I cannot kneel, I shall revolt!

I live my life
I live my life as I want to
I live my life
I don't believe in your kings
I don't look back
I cannot stop, I just break through
I don't look back
I spread my fucking wings

I cannot be a slave, I can't obey the lord
I cannot wear the shackles, that I wore before
I cannot be a soldier in a mindless war
I cannot kneel, I shall revolt!

I live in revolt!
I live in revolt!
I live in revolt!
I cannot wear the shackles, that I wore before!

I cannot be a slave, I can't obey the lord
I cannot wear the shackles, that I wore before
I cannot be a soldier in a mindless war
I cannot kneel, I shall revolt!
