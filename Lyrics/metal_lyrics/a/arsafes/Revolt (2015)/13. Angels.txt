I learned to know the world
Never meant to be
A shelter for the
Wounded hearts
And eyes, that shined so bright, we
Always used to see
Once close forever
Cruelly tearing souls apart

Don't you worry, just
Don't you worry cause
I see them smiling in the sky
I only wish they said goodbye
Don't feel sorry, just
Don't feel sorry cause
The endless streams of tears you cry
Will rise up high

I saw a destiny
Brighter than the sun,
I saw a faith
That leads to grace
I ask the holy blade why
Does it choose the ones
Who try to make the world
A better place

Don't you worry, just
Don't you worry cause
I see them smiling in the sky
I only wish they said goodbye
Don't feel sorry, just
Don't feel sorry cause
The endless streams of tears you cry
Will rise up high
