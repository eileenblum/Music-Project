Goddamn this rainy season
Goddamn the fucking score
Goddamn this unintentional
State of war
I have no fucking reason
To see this clownery three-dimensional
So on your mark, get set and fuck you all!

No compromise,
No submission to the bastards' reign!
I realise
I'm the master of this bloody game!
Fuck you all!
Fuck you all!
I will never kneel before the world!
Fuck you all!
Fuck you all!
I will never fall!

Goddamn the propaganda
Goddamn the exchange rate
Goddamn my permanently
Fucked up state!
Time's praying for a scandal
In the toxic world of social surgery
So here's the antidote - fuck you all!

No compromise,
No submission to the bastards' reign!
I realise
I'm the master of this bloody game!
Fuck you all!
Fuck you all!
I will never kneel before the world!
Fuck you all!
Fuck you all!
I will never fall!

Fuck you all!

No compromise,
No submission to the bastards' reign!
I realise
I'm the master of this bloody game!
Fuck you all!
Fuck you all!
I will never kneel before the world!
Fuck you all!
Fuck you all!
I will never fall!

Fuck you all!
