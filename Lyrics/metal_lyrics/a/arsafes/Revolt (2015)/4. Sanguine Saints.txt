A weakened mind
Stops the soul
From reconnecting
With the light
It stays awake
In the arms
Of bleeding statues
Out of sight
Of all the eyes
Of all the faces
All the hands
That seek revenge

Sanguine saints
Are cursed to burn
In pits beneath the earth
Sanguine saints
Are made to learn
The ways of pain from birth

My eyes are open
My bones are crushed
By a thousand hammers
Of those who knew
That all I wanted
Was to set them free
From the will of blood,
From the crooked truth

Sanguine saints
Are cursed to burn
In pits beneath the earth
Sanguine saints
Are made to learn
The ways of pain from birth

In nomine spiritus sancti
Behead the slaves, all for one
In nomine spiritus sancti
The sages burn forever

As the lords assemble to deny
Your truly spoken words
Flames begin to rise up to the sky
Blindly igniting the heaven's doors
