Forget the light of day
Forget the light of day
The night is when you hit the road,
The night is when you play
You found a better way
You found a better way
To do every motherfucking thing
That i say

The neon lights are on
The neon lights are on
And all the hookers from the bar
Are here to join the fun
Today you're number fucking one

Jade
Come on, dance for me
Jade
For all the world to see

Behold the queen of kink
Behold the queen of kink
As the royal children slowly flow down,
Down the sink

So what does money win?
So what does money win?
Its wins a life of Rx
After an hour of sin

The fucking music's on
The fucking music's on
And all the bitches from the bar
Are here to join the fun
Today you're number fucking one

Jade
Come on, dance for me
Jade
For all the world to see

What are you cocksuckers doing in my fucking room??

Today you're number fucking one

Jade
Come on, dance for me
Jade
For all the world to see
Jade
Come on, dance for me
Jade
For all the world to...
