Good morning idiot, it's time to get out of your bed
Go take a dump and sniff your socks, you're ready for today
You hate this fucking world, you wish someone will find you dead
You wish someday all obstacles will get out of your way

Let the boundaries go
Let them collide with each other and fall
Let the ladders grow
Leading you out of it all

Bring out the nihilist!

You came back home to find your food as cold as polar ice
You can't believe your cat pissed all over your fucking floor
You understand you're all alone and finally you lose control
Let sanity get the fuck out of your brain

Let the boundaries go
Let them collide with each other and fall
Let the ladders grow
Leading you over the walls

Bring out the nihilist!
