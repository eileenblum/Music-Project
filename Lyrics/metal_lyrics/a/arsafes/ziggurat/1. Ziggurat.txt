I can see you, can feel you, can smell your fear
I see you bow before my throne
I can save you, enslave you, control your tears,
Can leave you rot forever alone

Gather your saliva and your emotions,
Your never ending apologies,
You need to march with the other soldiers in the name of me!
All I need is power, I need the oceans,
I need the lands that will soon be part of my private property

Lead me home,
Just lead me home
I embraced the anger you made my own
Drown my mind in the sea of scarlet wrath
Lead me home,
Just lead me home
Where my eyes can see what I've always known
Lead me home, to the red stone Ziggurat

I shall take you, shall rape you, shall make you mine,
You'll be the hound I shall possess
I'll control you, will make you respect my prime,
Freedom of will shall be suppressed

All these human torches will lead my way to
The era that shall return from the past,
Making way for my reign to last until I die!
All this living fodder will fuel my engines
From the first to the last, raising my weapons to the sky

Lead me home,
Just lead me home
I embraced the anger you made my own
Drown my mind in the sea of scarlet wrath
Lead me home,
Just lead me home
Where my eyes can see what I've always known
Lead me home, to the red stone Ziggurat
