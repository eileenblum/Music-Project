All eyes are turned to the mongrel's frown
All eyes are turned to its rancid crown
As it arrives
To approve the feast on burial grounds
And command a happy smile for peasants as they kneel down

I see the holy parade as it marches through the lands of grief
I hear the trumpets call as the darkness falls on those who disbelieve
I see the preachers scream as the crowd applauds to the chief -
A crowned filthy Hound in an emperor's gown, fed with luxurious beef

All hands are raised in the name of the lord
And legs are broken by the slaves of the Dog
For it was crowned as a spawn of an era of lies
Resurrected to testify that once again
Dog eat God
Dog eat God
Can't you see that
Dog eat God
Dog eat God

I see the holy parade as it marches through the lands of grief
I hear the trumpets call as the darkness falls on those who disbelieve
I see the preachers bless exceptionally people folding hands and closing eyes
Led by a filthy Hound in an emperor's gown, chewing on the bones of Jesus
Christ
