Everyone
Every little motherfucker thinking
That he is a precious gift to all of us
Every time
Every motherfucking second that I bleed
Upon the road to never-ending peace
Curse you
And your dirty hands that
Broke the necks of countless men
We lay ourselves on the altar of carnage
Breaking bones, slitting throats open wide

Come with me
And together we will travel
To the places of slaughter and grief
Tear my skin and see
All that's living inside me
And all that you will never be
Suck my dick
You megalomaniacal
Abomination of a cursed inverted womb
I am fucking cannon fodder
And I fucking salute you!

Rape!
The war machine collects it's troops
Take!
The war machine collects it's meat

We salute the order
Death is what we get
Meat and cannon fodder
Listen and obey
As the world is raped once more

Drop the bombs
Destroying every motherfucking village
As a threat to motherfucking global policy
Shoot the kids
Eventually denying every feeling that is
Opposite to hatred and brutality
Rape the young
Right? Why do we need a goddamn future?
And why the fuck do we need anything
That doesn't motherfucking kill?

Rape!
The war machine collects it's troops
Take!
The war machine collects it's meat
Rape!
Take!
