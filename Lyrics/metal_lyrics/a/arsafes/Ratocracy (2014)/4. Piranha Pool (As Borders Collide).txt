Can you feel the lack of satisfaction?
Can you hear the whispering men?
Can you see the social erection
Rising and deflowering the counterfeit zen?
Can you smell the stench of revolution
Offered as salvation to the mass?
Can you feel the political pollution
Fill the sky with venomous gas?

So now you can go and kill your fucking self
Cause anyway your only faith is rotting in a cell
There've been too many terrorists, there've been too many saints
Now welcome to the war zone, where they are all the same
The fucking radio commands to tighten up your belt
While the television promises serenity and wealth
But I've seen too many faces, I've seen too many tears
I've seen too many people exposed to their fears

You conceive the Babylon's child in grief - false salvation
You believe in promises of all the thieves - putrid lies

Can you feel the pressure of corruption?
Can you hear the speeches of the "Lords"?
Can you see the fictitious election
Masterfully played by the government's wards?
Can you feel your pride penetrated?
Can you feel your confidence raped?
Can you see that the bombs detonated
Shaking the borders of the world?

A fish rots from the head, so does the state
As crazy fucking people worship kings that they create
All the stupid motherfucking laws, all the empty stores
And all the calls for genocide and all the fucking wars
Now what we hear are arguments - which politician's right?
But in the end for people any ministry is blight
So take the ratocratic dick out of your fucking mouth
This should be nothing to think about

You conceive the Babylon's child in grief - false salvation
You believe in promises of all the thieves - putrid lies
You deceive yourself to believe in onetime fake peace
You deceive yourself to believe
