Rebuild your mind today
So you can see the world
And all it's filthy ways
In and beyond
Unchain your hands today
And break the walls around
Tomorrow'll be too late
Just listen to these sounds!

Against the legions of this world
We stand alone
Against the scavengers of souls
We fight as one
Cause we are the first
And we are the last

Be proud of what you are
Be proud of what you do
Don't give a damn about
What people say
All those cock-sucking pigs
Can eat our shit and cry
Can lick their mommy's cunts
And fucking die

Against the legions of this world
We stand alone
Against the scavengers of souls
We fight as one
Cause we are the first
And we are the last

We fucking stand alone!
