As I float in the rays of exploding suns,
Becoming a particle of bliss,
I forget the path to disarray, tear the past..
And the future's dawn breaks today...

It's alright
To cage the words in your mind
It's alright
To leave them for someone to find

Can I climb the ladder to ether
And grasp the reins of the skies?
Can I feel the sweet taste of Victory?
Can I find those words in your mind?

Follow me to the ocean of sanctity
Let the waves lead your essence to bliss
We are one with the grains of infinity
We are one with the light of a newborn star...

Follow me to the ocean of sanctity
Let the waves lead your essence to me
Say "hello" to my demons, they welcome you
And humbly bow their heads before your grace!
