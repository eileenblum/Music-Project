I collide with billions of worlds
Drastically tortured and raped
Here you are, Little Man, laughing at me,
Could you help me and rewind this tape?
Thank you, my friends, for clapping so loud,
But tonight I'll dance for myself!
I'm awake, little fuck! You better be gone!
Run away, Little Man, for god's sake!

Save your soul for yourself
Preserve your body for me!
So I can take it to the fair and buy it balloons,
Then fuck it behind a tree!
As you can see, I puked all over myself,
But somehow I don't give a shit...
Hooray, Little Man! You've won the game!
Again and again and again and again...
...and again!

Everyone in every world
And every world in everyone,
Singing songs, when all alone,
Denying the Unknown...
Every tiny grain of sand
Can hide another Little Man,
So from this blasted beach
I fly away...

So little to the eye,
A colossus inside,
Just fucking up my mind...
