[A: self-destroy]

Dive inside
An open mind
An open soul
With many little faces
You glue yourself
To a broken wall
And crack your bones
With countless little nails

Live a life of joy
Die a tiny death

Do me a favor
And lie on your back
So I can replace
Your face with a picture
I count on this world
While you count on a stranger
Becoming the past
And touching the void

Live in your own breath
Break and self-destroy

[B: a new way of creation]

Wait for a crooked hand, emerging from the oil
To grasp your tiny neck and tear it apart
No more tears, you fucked up piece of meat
Cause heaven calls, heaven roars "welcome aboard!"

Watch the angels laugh and dance
As soldiers die and women cry
Along with people's blinded eyes
That stare into the sky

Wait for your head to land on a neat and tidy scaffold
So you can bleed your way to the land of paradise
Tell me the words you hear in your tortured swollen brain
Maybe I hear them too and we are both insane

Come with me into the water
Let your body float in peace
Take my hand and sleep forever
Becoming one with the midnight breeze

Dive inside
Your broken mind
Your broken soul
Your open heart
And fly above
The world you created

Come with me into the water
Let your body float in peace
Take my hand and sleep forever
Becoming one with the midnight breeze

[C: the first tides]

Come with me into the water
Let your body float in peace
Take my hand and sleep forever
Becoming one with the midnight breeze
