You seem confused
Once walked the path of denial
A soul so bruised
That passed through error and trial

Hey you, you never know
They come and go
Hey you, you never know
Why faith's so slow

Far away there is a world
Close to the sky
Come and stay there with me as the night
Passes by

Don't be afraid
See through these walls that surround you
Just take my hand
And let these words become true

Hey you, I never know
They come and go
Hey you, I never know
When faith's so close

Far away there is a world
Close to the sky
Come and stay there with me as the night
Passes by
