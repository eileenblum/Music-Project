Believe the bleeding trees
And believe the silent soil
The mangled birds and the feasting rats
Covered in pitch-black oil
Believe the prison bars
As they form a cell around you
Believe the wailing wind
Haunting layered beds of honour

As human lives collide
In the vortex of war...
Raven's heaven incarnate on earth
The clouds grow dark upon you all

Deny the laughing mouth
As venom hides inside the gorge
Deny the shining gold
For a million graves compile the forge
Powder-driven hard lead arrows
Ardently kiss the heart
Sky-scraping piles of corpses -
A masterpiece of human art

I came from a valley of stars
To dwell in the shadows
Now I challenge the world with my scars

Desertion fails
On a path of no return
When feet entwine and eyes shut down
As men begin to burn
And the rain falls down
To wash away blood, sweat and tears,
Forming rivers of remains
And drowning fears

I came from a valley of stars
To dwell in the shadows
Now I challenge the world with my scars
Dropping down dead

I challenge the fire as I strive
Through burning streams, as they boil my skin
We challenge the world with our lives
For we ourselves are challenged again

I came from a valley of stars
To dwell in the shadows
Now I challenge the world with my scars
As they burst open wide
