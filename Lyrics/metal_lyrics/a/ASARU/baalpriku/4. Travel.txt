Carried from funeral winds I travel through time
Down under the earth in the depths of the sea and in the everlasting sky
There where the great dragons spread their fire long before anything existed

Here all my fantasies become one with my pains and fears and my reality
In this kingdom of joy nothing will ever be touched by any kind of your gods weak creations
Far beyond the universe a place of fire, soil, water and wind

Vinder av natten fÃ¸rer meg i det mÃ¸rke riket av dÃ¸dens skjonnhet

Travelling through ancient spheres
Travelling through time and space
Entering a new dimension

Deep in the halls of the unseen, a castle with walls of fog
Shadows from depths beyond life appear in the mist with powerful splendour
I open the gate to eternity and begin my journey to the wide realms of immortality
