As the fog creeps through the valleys of the dusk
And the stream of snow continues to live again
Every part of my mind descends into the black coldness
Wandering in memories of lost times I feel my tears burn

The pain of my conscience grips deep into my darkened heart
I feel the eternal darkness growing in my soul
And my eyes started to see the dark winter within me

As I look into the mirror of my frozen blood
I realized that the dead winter I've become
With all my frozen thoughts I desperate die
In my world of coldness and death

Every part of my mind descends into the black coldness
Wandering in memories of lost times I feel my tears burn
The pain of my conscience grips deep into my darkened heart
I feel the eternal darkness growing in my soul
