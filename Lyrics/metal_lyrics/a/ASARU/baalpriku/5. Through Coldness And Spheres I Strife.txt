Through coldness and spheres I strife
I entered a journey to the stars, watch my life
Forgotten all my desperate screams
All mysteries gone in eternal brightness

I fly to the valleys of darkness
Those not touched by human imagination
No tears, no sorrow, no pain
Can ever reach me in this abyss of souls

Where I can feel the non-existing
Where I can breathe the cold freedom
Falling into tuneless places
Creeping towards the fields of higher power

I have left my mortal corpse so far behind
To strike between the living and the dying dimensions
