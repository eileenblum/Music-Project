Eternity seems to be one captured unit
And the spirit turns into a nearly hard matter

A soul travels between worlds and energies
Long forgotten, the truth of every level
Becomes connected, they become one
The entirety of body and soul grows together
Even stronger

The perpetual play of the mortals disappears in the
Sea of the stars
In maelstroms of the spheres powers are roaring
Yet unseen, unidentified by human eyes
The era of universes shines pale above

One a passage through unknown nothingness
Everything recognizing and nothing concealing...forever...
