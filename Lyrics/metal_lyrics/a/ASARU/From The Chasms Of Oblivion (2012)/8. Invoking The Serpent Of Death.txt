Scorn to the light, erase the stars
Death to the moon and the sun
Open wide the gates beyond
A sacrifice has to be done

Contempt to the earth, delete the sky
Death to the sun and the moon
Beasts of the night rise in gloom
Summon thy angel of doom

...Arise from thy throne ...Appear from the world below ...Rise and come forth!

Descendant of the ancient gods of war
Dreadfully spread thy spawn upon this tainted world
Come forth, in anger rise up from beneath the ground
Thy curse may turn this world to ashes

Seeds of hatred prosper in the heart of man
Seeds of fear benighten body, mind and soul
Frantic screams, cry of dismay, riven by grief and despair
Cries of pain, stench of decay, manifest serpent of death

Let lightning crack to the soil , let fire crawl from below
Flames shall rise into the night, glow in the darkness so bright
Oh putrid human being, feeble creature of light
Recitate your prayers, the end is nigh

With the power of the oceans and the strength of the storm
With the rage of conflagration thy descendant be reborn
Breed thy spawn, thy kingdom come, swallow this world - let it burn
Great demise, no more disguise, manifest serpent of death
