Black clouds are raging, sweeping through a scarlet sky
The earth is shivering, eruption trembles, burning from within
Feel the heat rising up from deep below
As sulphur rain is pouring down unto the surface
And glaciers melt to steam

A crumbling earthquake shatters the ground
The beast is rising again
All hell breaks loose, the flame's unbound
A world on fire - remain

Black dust is spreading, carried by a funeral wind
Light is fading, the moon, the sun and stars don't shine anymore
Expanding darkness - falling into timeless night
As smoke and ashes fill the sky
And mother earth is burning down to the core

A crumbling earthquake shatters the ground
Mankind is struggling in vain
All hope is lost, the flame's unbound
A world on fire - remain

...Fire!

Apocalyptic prophecy, neverending wrath
Ancient gods will take revenge
Judgement day on the rise
Ending lives in misery, everlasting death
Angels and demons walk hand in hand
As this puny world dies

...Die!

Devastation, bringing forth the great demise
Armageddon, grand damnation, the final hour strikes
This world collapses like million others did before
As raging flames submerge the desolated landscape
And emptiness will rise

A crumbling earthquake shattered the ground
The beast has risen again
All hell broke loose, the flame's unbound
A world in ashes - remain

The pulse of earth reached its end
As cosmic powers blast this tiny ball
Back into the chasms of oblivion
