See the depths of unconsciousness
And heed the written call for all ages and times
But deception, lies and deceit is all you will find
On your way to extinguish your mind
Paying homage to a fantasy divine

Lead a life in obedience
For a god created by men who never wanted to die
And pray with your face down and ass to the sky
Day by day, dedicate all your life
To give credence to a fantasy divine

Blind obedience - do as they told you
Never question why, never comprehend
This be your fortune, joy and lust denied - blind obedience

Strive to continuously walk the path of confusion
Forget who you are and thrive in total delusion
And confess, repent all your sins
And indulge in sacred disillusion

Drown your spirit in fallacy
Rape yourself in a deadly dull encasement
Follow followers and writhe in self-enslavement
Be obsessed, apologize for being human
Remain in mental derangement

Blind obedience - guide your way
Close your eyes and stop to think
Blind obedience - mind astray

Blind obedience - light your path
For a lifetime struggling
Be a gregarious animal - blind obedience
