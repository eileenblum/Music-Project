Troops of damnation rise from the east
Spreading death and destruction across the land
Declaring war ... hordes of evil march

Assassinating suicide, terror rules the scene
Violence, machine gun fire
Hostages in fright, bombing raids all along the way
Prepare to die, prepare to bleed
Prepare your soul for this defeat

Utter devastation, bloodshed divine, messenger of doom
Holy persecution nowhere to hide
Prepare to bleed, prepare to die
Prepare your throat for your last cry

Request to the "holy war"
By a malicious preacher's fundamentalistical teachings
Of a storybook written many hundred years ago

Mindless misguided fools hidden among all of us
Waiting for the call of the suicide command

Never show mercy, never hesitate
The preacher has spoken, unite under the flag of Jihad

Chase the unbelievers, kill them one by one
The war has begun, are you ready to die?
