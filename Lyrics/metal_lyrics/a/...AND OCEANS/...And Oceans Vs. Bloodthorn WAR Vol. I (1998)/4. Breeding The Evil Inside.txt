[Originally performed by Bloodthorn]

Drops of new gleaming
In the flesh new morning light
My body cold and trembling
I've left the safety of the night
I sit here on the ground
By my side there lies a knife
I was her fault, I'm not to blame
I have to take her life
My tear-wet eyes won't focus
And neither will my head
I just sit here in the silence
Nothing lives here - all is dead
These feelings born inside
A new side of me is born
For ever face I see
I feel such raging scorn
When you took my life away
It gave you a new vision
I planted a seed
It gave you a mission
From beside the lifeless flesh
I pick up my bloody knife
I wander into a new day
Prepared to take another life
