[Music: Andreas &amp; Joakim]
[Lyrics: Viktor]

And as the dying man was reaching for heaven,
and stared into the vault of stars,
he understood the message that life had given
and took one last breath of air.

As the boy woke up to see the illusions
that the world had clouded his mind with,
he understood the message that life had given
and broke free and started to live for real.
...and started to live for real.

As the world turns from dark once more,
weÂ´re heading for a brand new day.
See the world through different eyes.
Let the light come shining down.

Again this vision, this blurry content of our lives.
WeÂ´ve seen this world through fire.
Alone we walk through the darkest corners of our minds,
and slowly turning every stone we can find.

As the boy woke up to see the illusions
that the world had clouded his mind with,
he understood the message that life had given
and broke free and started to live for real.

As the world turns from dark once more,
weÂ´re heading for a brand new day.
See the world through different eyes.
Let the light come shining down.

As the fire from the night above dies
weÂ´re heading for a brand new day.
See the world through different eyes,
and let the sun come once again.
