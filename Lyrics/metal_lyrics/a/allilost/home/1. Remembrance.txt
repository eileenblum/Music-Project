[Music: Viktor &amp; Andreas]
[Lyrics: Viktor]

The echo of her figure lingers on to my memory
and leaves a mark so deep, no gentle eyes could ever see.
The fragile shape within my mind of her lonesome smile gives
a gleam of joy that penetrates what is left in me.

Oh, through our memories we see.
Ah, for every star that shine, we bleed.

In the silent night I see her,
standing right next to me.
Caress the thoughts and let the night grow darker.
Just as long as her shadow stays with me.

And as the sun goes down and all the light will fade away
Her peaceful ghost will stay with me and keep me safe
And as the flood will rise and take me down as time goes by
the remembrance of her scent will not decay

So close my eyes.
Breath in the night.
I will always hold you close
to my heart.

Oh, through our memories we see.
Ah, for every star that shine, we bleed.

In the silent night I see her,
standing right next to me.
Caress the thoughts and let the night grow darker.
Just as long as her shadow stays with me.
