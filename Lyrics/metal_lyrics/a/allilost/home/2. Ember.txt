[Music: Andreas &amp; Joakim]
[Lyrics: Viktor]

So obsessed with their own creation,
their mind turns black as they reach for more.
Turned the back on all the sacred, we fall,
and the hope of a better world dies.

No time to say goodbye.
No time to speak my mind,
about the things,
the things that we left behind.

"We are the fire that consumes you.
The absence of light in your heart.
We are the dark side of the sun.
Obey and let it come down."

Still breathing on my own.
I will fight for retribution.
We will fill our holes inside
with the ember from your lies.

Tear down the walls with hate.
Release the beast within.
I wont stand alone, in this
self-made war of flies.

"We are the fire that consumes you.
The absence of light in your heart.
We are the dark side of the sun.
Obey and let it come down."

We've been falling down the spiral for far too long.
Now, crawling back!
