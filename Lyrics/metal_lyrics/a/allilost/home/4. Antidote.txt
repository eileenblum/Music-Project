[Music: Andreas &amp; Joakim]
[Lyrics: Viktor]

I remember every single word I've said to you,
and all the things I know I've put you through.

'Cause in the end of days
The one who standing by my side is you.
Even though the shit we've been through.

I have stumbled through the darkest hour with no hope.
Searching for a single light to follow.
And then you crossed my path,
and told me where to put my feet

You are the antidote of my heartache.
The star of this all-consuming night.
'Cause in the end of days, when all is gone,
you're the one who lights up my road.

These lions wont be keeping me away from you no more.
A fallen star to guide my way until the day we die.

And every single day I'm here for you.
I'm here for you.
And every single day I'm here for you.
Here for you.

These lions will not keep me away.

You are the antidote of my heartache.
The star of this all-consuming night.
'Cause in the end of days, when all is gone,
you're the one who lights up my road.

The antidote of my heartache.
