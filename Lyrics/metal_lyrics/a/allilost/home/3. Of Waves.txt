[Music: Andreas &amp; Joakim]
[Lyrics: Viktor]

Betrayed by the ocean once again.
A whirling chaos right before my eyes.
Slowly sinking further down,
as I get crushed from the weight above.

The depths of the black abyss
won't drain my strength, it wont drag me down.
I wont pretend thereÂ´s something left to save.
Of waves I am reborn.

Surrender to the waves around us
and with my eyes I see the end
A broken promise that would change the tide, and we will,
We will never be the same.

We all struggle with our memories
we choose to leave behind

From here I can see your true face,
reflected in this cold, dark water.
A vague illusion of the beauty you possessed.

This time I'll break the surface,
and fill my empty lungs with air.
I promise myself I will never return again

Surrender to the waves around us
and with my eyes I see the end.
A broken promise that would change the tide, and we will,
We will never be the same again.

We will never be the same again.
