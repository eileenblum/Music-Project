Beyond our beliefs lies another world hidden deep in the skies
Where islands float in the air and amazing creatures exist
There anything is possible,
All your hopes and dreams may come true
May come true

Let us take your there if your dare, if your dare
Just close your eyes and reach for the skies

Let the music flow and fill your body with this energy
It is a synergy
Let the music flow until your mind explodes and gains a new existence

Just close your eyes and reach for the skies, for the skies
Reach a higher state of mind
Reach a higher state of mind

This is a way to gain immortality
A new level to your reality
This is a way to live forever
Face you fate, accept your destiny

Just close your eyes and reach for the skies

Let the music flow and fill your body with this energy
It is a synergy
Let the music flow until your mind explodes and gains a new existence

Welcome to the promised land
Let your new entity stand
Time for your new legacy
Say goodbye to your old felonies (say goodbye)

Close your eyes and reach for the skies
The promised land

Just close your eyes and reach for the skies

Welcome to the promised land
Let your new entity stand

This is a way to gain immortality
