This is for all of you, who live your lives with blinded eyes.
Just look around yourself, what do you see?
Egoism thrives, loyalty is dead.
Greedy minds control our lives!
All I can see is how they feed,
false truths as rules to live by,
I refuse to obey.
Those endless lies corrupt our minds!

I don't feel it's the right way to live my life,
To believe in all those lies.
FUCK THEM ALL, WE STAND TALL!
Do you think it's fine to live your life in a lie?
All we need is a...

REVOLUTION, NOW!

Revolution to break the illusion,
That hypocrites have fed to us as rules to live by...

What will you do when you realize the fact that you have lived your life with blindfolded eyes?!

I refuse to obey,Â 
I refuse to be a slave.
My life will not be lived in vain.
I refuse to obey,
I refuse to be a slave!

I don't feel it's the right way to live my life,
To believe in all those lies.
FUCK THEM ALL, WE STAND TALL!
Do you think it's fine to live your life in a lie?
All we need is a REVOLUTION!
