[feat. guitar solo by Jori Haukio]Beyond our beliefs lies another world,Â Hidden deep in the skies.
Where islands float in the air and amazing creatures exist,
There anything is possible,Â 
All your hopes and dreams may come true... MAY COME TRUE!

Let us take you there if you dare... IF YOU DARE!
Just close your eyes and reach for the skies...

Let the music flow and fill your body with this energy, it is a sinergy!
Let the music flow untill your mind explodes and gains a new existence!

Just close your eyes and reach for the skies.
REACH FOR THE SKIES.
Reach a higher state of mind.
REACH A HIGHER STATE OF MIND.

This is a way to gain immortality!Â 
A new level to your reality!
This is a way to live forever!
FACE YOUR FATE, ACCEPT YOUR DESTINY!

Just close your eyes and reach for the skies...

Let the music flow and fill your body with this energy, it is a sinergy!
Let the music flow untill your mind explodes and gains a new existence!

Welcome to the promised land, Let your new entity stand.
Time for your new legacy, Say goodbye to your old felonies...

Say goodbye, Close your eyes, Reach for the skies, The Promised land.

Just close your eyes and reach for the skies,
Welcome to the promised land, Let your new entity stand!
