It's the final showdown...

I lost my soul in a gamble,Â To the man in black.
Now I'm trying to win it back!
It's the Devil's Hold'Em,Â The ultimate stakes,
And I'm all in! I'M ALL IN!!

I have to win this game to stay alive,
These chips in front of me are worth my life.
The fear of loosing is growing on my mind.
All I need is just a little luck,
Getting caught of bluffing would be the end of my time!
The end of my time.

Can I cheat the devil??!
OH HELL NO...

2nd hand let's go, I'm ready to roll.
Ace of Spades, Queen of Hearts.

I have to win this game to stay alive,
These chips in front of me are worth my life.
The fear of loosing is growing on my mind.
All I need is just a little luck,
Getting caught of bluffing would be the end of my time!
The end of my time.Â I put everything on the line to win an eternal life.
