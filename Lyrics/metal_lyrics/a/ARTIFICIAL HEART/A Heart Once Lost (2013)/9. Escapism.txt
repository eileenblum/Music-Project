Escaping from reality in the present world is understandable.
'Cause every step we take in the streets is making us cease deeper in dreams...

Because freedom is dead and the god is deaf and we ourselves are destroying the world!
The freedom is dead and the god is deaf...

What should we do when everything that used ours is taken away,
How should we feel? When nothing is as it seems.

Are we alive or just breathing,
Are we living or just dreaming.
Are we alive or just breathing,
Are we living or just dreaming...

There is no one to blame but ourselves,
Only we can make the difference, But the time is running out,
And it's always easier to dream through the chaos while the rest of the world shall burn.
While the rest of the world shall burn!

What should we do when everything that used ours is taken away,
How should we feel? When nothing is as it seems.

Are we alive or just breathing,
Are we living or just dreaming.
Are we alive or just breathing,
Are we living or just dreaming...

Wake up, Wake up, WAKE UP, WAKE UP!!
