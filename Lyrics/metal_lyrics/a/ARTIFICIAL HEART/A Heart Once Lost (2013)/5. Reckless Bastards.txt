Greetings everyone I tell you right now,
Our morals are deaf, We have no shame and we don't regret!
We live everyday like it's a weekend and we like to party.

Drinking, Sniffing, Smoking.
Anything goes down the drain.
We live tonight like there's no tomorrow...
NO TOMORROW!

We are coldhearted ladykillers,
When we go out anything can happen.
Let this night define who you are!
Sky is the limit we set, let us know your bet!

Drinking, Sniffing, Smoking.Â 
What doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger.
There is no routine on how we woll,
If you are tough enough then join our show.

We are the real reckless bastards,
We feel no regrets.Â 
By tomorrow we'll get fucked up again,
And drink ourselves to death.

We are coldhearted ladykillers,
When we go out anything can happen.
Let this night define who you are!
Sky is the limit we set, let us know your bet!
LET US KNOW YOUR BET!

HEY! HEY! HEY!
Join the crazy train.
HEY! HEY! HEY!
Ignore the morning pain.
Join the crazy train!
What even is the morning pain?!

We are the real reckless bastards,
We feel no regrets.
By tomorrow we'll get fucked up again,
And drink ourselves to death.
'Cause every girl dreams of a reckless bastard,
That they will regret.
There is no trusting on these reckless bastards,
They won't call you back!
