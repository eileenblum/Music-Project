[feat. Jesse Kitti (Drop The Pilot)]Sometimes we wander,
We struggle and we get fucked up by love...

Of all feelings a man can feel,
Is the one that makes us come alive,
But also at times it might break us into pieces,
BREAK US INTO PIECES!

We wanted to find something to fight for,
In the City of Lights.
Together we found a meaning to die for,
Our own paradise...

Right there destiny hit me, in the city of lights.
It was that place we found together, by mistake...

As this key closes our lock, as this key drops to the water.
It seals our love, it seals our bond, we will never be torn apart!

Have you ever felt so alive??!

Sometimes we wander,
We struggle and we get fucked up by love...

Together we make our stand and we have no fear.
We don't give a fuck about the world,
We have found our own paradise,
OUR OWN PARADISE!

We wanted to find something to fight for,
In the city of lights.
Together we found a meaning to die for,
Our own paradise...

Right there destiny hit me, in the city of lights.
It was that place we found together, by mistake...

As this key closes our lock, as this key drops to the water.
It seals our love, it seals our bond, we will never be torn apart!
