So out of reach when I needed a friend,
Where were you?!Â Doing your thing, not giving a fuck.
Now I'm making my dreams come true,
And I'm the bad guy. (HUH?)

This is my time to show everybody I can put up a show,
And I'm gonna take over the world.

And I'm never coming back down again!

I've been brought here to entertain,
To entertain. It's my fate to make you feel alive again,
To make you feel alive again.Â This is my destiny!

You never believed in me.
You never told me that you believe in me.

Have you ever felt so high,
That you said you're never coming down?
You're never coming back down again.

DOWN AGAIN!

I've been brought here to entertain,
To entertain. It's my fate to make you feel alive again,
To make you feel alive again.Â This is my destiny!
