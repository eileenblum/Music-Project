[feat. Mika Lahti (One Morning Left)]Hear this anthem, Join the rebellion, Find the courage you need to break free!
This is your time to shine, This is your time to stand against!Â This is your time to shine...

If you feel like being isolated from the rest of the world we want you to know you are never alone,
You are never alone!
Let your voice be heard and scream these words, We will not be silenced never again, never again...
Let your voice be heard and scream these words, We will not be silenced never again, never again...

The Liar's Paradox controls us all while the All Seeing Eye watches us tight!
Nations are dividing, there is no denying.
We are rising resistance, We bring the revolution.

We refuse to be slaves of so called "society's finest",Â 
We won't sell our souls and we'll never give our hearts away!
To false prophets, to the hypocrites!
We are the rising resistance, We bring the revolution.

Let your voice be heard and scream these words...
We are the rising resistance, We bring the revolution!
We are the rising resistance, We bring the revolution!

We refuse to be slaves of so called "society's finest",Â 
We won't sell our souls and we'll never give our hearts away!
To false prophets, to the hypocrites!
We are the rising resistance, We bring the revolution.

We stand as one family which can't be broken,
We stand as one family which can't be broken...

WHICH CAN'T BE BROKEN, WE STAND AS ONE!
