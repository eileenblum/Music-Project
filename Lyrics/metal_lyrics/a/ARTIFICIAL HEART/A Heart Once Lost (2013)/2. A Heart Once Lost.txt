I never cared what you tried to say, I never took a listen.
You tried to ask me if I could act differently.
You never said this could ever break,
But now I understand it. 
Maybe it was me who could have been a better man!

How did I not realize before,
That how I've been acting for far too long.
All the time you were left alone while I was having fun with my boys.
How did we end up in this situation we're in?
Can we fix it all again?
Choice is yours,
Take it or leave it.

Before there's nothing left for me to give in this world,
I won't give up on you. When all hope is gone, 
You are the one I turn to, I turn to you.

I turn to you if there's a chance to or have I really lost you?
How could I make you see the change in me, it's real.
I never knew that you never knew how much I love you.
So many years should have been lived in a different way.

This situation consumes me until the end.
How could I fuck it up like this,
It feels like I'm living my worst nightmares.
If I give up on you, I will regret endlessly.

Please let me know if there's a chance to make things right!

Before there's nothing left for me to give in this world,
I won't give up on you. When all hope is gone,
You are the one I turn to, I turn to you.
