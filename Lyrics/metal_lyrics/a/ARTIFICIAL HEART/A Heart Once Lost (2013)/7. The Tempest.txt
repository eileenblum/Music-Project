I see the upcoming storm in the distance,
I'm waiting for it to take us all!
I see the upcoming storm in the distance,
I'm waiting for it to take us all!

The lightning bolts are flashing faraway,
It sounds like countless amount of cannons blasting on concrete.

Out of nowhere a huge rainstorm arrives,
It lasts only a moment and feels like a warning...

When we struggle and suffer,Â In the end we'll come together!
We unite the mankind and strenght we shall find to survive! We will survive...

We will survive if there's a chance to make it out alive.
We need to unite, so death won't tear us apart tonight!

This swirling vortex of chaos is getting worse every passing moment.
Wind is blowing so hard it makes the water rain,
Like a streaming rapid right into my face...Â 

When we struggle and suffer,Â In the end we'll come together!
We unite the mankind and strenght we shall find to survive! We will survive...

After the typhoon has passed,
I see the damage done and I know I'm not the only one feeling restless...
Feeling so restless, Why I'm feeling so fucking restless?!

We will survive if there's a chance to make it out alive.
We need to unite, so death won't tear us apart tonight!

The morning after the flags have been lowered half-mast to honor the fallen ones...
HONOR THE FALLEN ONES!
