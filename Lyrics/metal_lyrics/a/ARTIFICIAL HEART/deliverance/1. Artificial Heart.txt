JUMP THE FUCK UP!

THERE IS AN ARTIFICIAL HEART BEATING INSIDE YOU ALL!

Can you see any light behind the dark, or are the waves getting too high to
climb, will you drown?
Disasterous storm like a purge it's rising, taking you with it.
Breaking, reaping, throwing you up. It's throwing you up.

Falling, flying from the highest mountain of them all.
Transparent like a ghost, into the deepest cave you fall.

THIS IS HELL!

Now you have to face him, show him that you're worth more.

Now you are walking on a broken glass!
Desperation is taking hold on you!

It's not wrong to be lost in life.
You walk through denial's grasp.

It's not wrong to be lost in life, everyone is once in a while.
Search your heart, what do you feel, hold on to it and grab a wheel.
