It's getting harder to breath, in this scum-like society.
Freedom is nonexistant, people are raised like rats.
Living in prisons, behind invisible bars.
Living in prisons, people are raised like rats.

RATS!

GO!

There is no defying the truth, there is no turning back.

We all have to sink to be reborn.

Through failure, through failure we people learn to live again.
Through failure, through failure I make my way to the top.

You all have to fight to exist again,
to break the illusion that wears you down.

Deliverance, I'm coming home to you.
Damnation, I wave you farewell.
