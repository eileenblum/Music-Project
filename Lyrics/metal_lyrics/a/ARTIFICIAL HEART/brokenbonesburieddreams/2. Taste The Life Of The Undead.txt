So now as the world we knew has come to it's end,
the zombie's time has begun...

As we spread on the streets breeding our forces,
give us a bite of your flesh and you'll never be the same!

As we rule this earth, and the troops are growing,
just let it go! Taste the life of the undead!

Taste the life of the undead, taste the life...

Give us a bite of your flesh and you will never be the same,
WHOO-WHOO-WHOO-WHOOU...
Infected blood flows down your veins you'll get your first taste of this life
of the undead!

Just let it go and taste the life of the undead...

You will be one of us. [4x]

You will be one of us and a part of ARTIFICIAL HEART!

Give us a bite of your flesh and you will never be the same,
WHOO-WHOO-WHOO-WHOOU...
Infected blood flows down your veins you'll get your first taste of this life of the undead! [2x]
