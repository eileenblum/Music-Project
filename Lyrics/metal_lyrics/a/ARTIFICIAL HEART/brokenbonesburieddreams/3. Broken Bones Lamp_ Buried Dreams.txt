Broken bones, buried dreams.
Toxic and garbage, there is no waste management!

Dead end plains, smoking ruins.
Roads leading nowhere, roads leading nowhere...

In the dead city you will never see the lights,
see the lights in the night.

In this wasteland screaming never ends,
will this nightmare never end...

In this wasteland the morning never comes!

Alone I wander on these empty streets without you,
now I'm all alone.

After the disaster the only thing that remains of you,
are the broken remains of you.

My undead heart was beating just for you,
It was for everlasting love...
Now my undead heart is bleeding just for you,
It was for everlasting lie...

It was for everlasting lie,
My undead heart for you... FOR YOU!

I have a picture of you,
a memory so beautiful...
In my memorial,
you shall forever remain! [2x]

Alone I wander on these empty streets without you,
now I'm all alone.

After the disaster the only thing that remains of you,
are the broken remains of you.

My undead heart was beating just for you,
It was for everlasting love...
Now my undead heart is bleeding just for you,
It was for everlasting lie...
