[feat. Nick Papageorgiou of The Northern]Do you remember the days before our thoughts were bound by threads?
Before crossed paths divided us and left our thoughts burred.

(Now) You are the living, breathing definition of silence.
The black that anchors to closed eyes.
The line that separates you from I.

While you lie awake at night,
I hope you never remember
The transience of your composure.

I hope you never see that
Your mask of sanity crumbled long ago.

'Cause we've been sailing through an endless ocean;
Past illusions of a distant shore.
And I know these words will never reach your ears.
