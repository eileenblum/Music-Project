The inks dried but the subtext remains
Words veiled but rooted deep in your veins
Watch tattered edges take hold of idle eyes and realize they're blind to what lies inside

I can't count how many times I've been misled by those once held in abstraction
But the truth is that no one should be held higher than your own true convictions

Paradigm breaking is this introspection
Once sacred walls breached by affliction
Look inside to ignite the connection
Between the path you've walked and the mirrors reflection

I never took you for a mannequin
Painted ivory to mask the black concealed withing

I never took you for a mannequin
Painted ivory to mask the black concealed withing
I never took you for hypocrite
But I will never put my trust in you again

Follow the labyrinthine steps to the barrow below
Walk with me in the black beneath where the roots hang like gallows

And with slated thirst and gilded lungs
Dig a little deeper until you're lost within
Within the cage that rests behind your eyes
A hollow where thieves and the weary hide
