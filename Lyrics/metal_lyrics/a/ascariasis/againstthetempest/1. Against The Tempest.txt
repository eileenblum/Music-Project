Set sail for land !

A black sky looms above the mast
As piercing winds cleave at my lungs
We push onward against the tempest
Hope lost within this prevailing storm
Crushing waves wash lives away
Forced asunder, cast astray

Ripped from the wheel
I descend into the sea
Strangled by the vice grip
Of hellish black waters

Sifting through a frozen trance
As my body is thrown by torrential waves
And I am left alone upon a shard of my ship
Slipping into an unconscious state

Visions pass before my eyes
Illusions harkening to my past life
My loves' eyes, her warm smile
Far from this drifting hearse

A clear sky welcomes this broken mind
Laying amongst the wreckage
And I dream of seeing your face again
I don't want to die alone

"Hold your tongue, dear captain
Not even your dreams can save you now
I demand your repentance;
For none is a life without sin
And you are no exception
To your wretched kin"

Forgive me father,
But this life has not reached an end
As long as I can draw breath, I will fight on
And I shall see my love again

Neither god, nor the devil
Can cage this longing heart
