When no light remains,
And thoughts are lost upon a blank canvas
We find ourselves drifting
Between shades of black and white.

A hollow shell,
Nothing but vague shadows.

And so night falls,
Like waves crashing upon stone,
Dissolving cascades of memories,
Lost amongst the silence.

Between these dancing figures
Lays the temptation of escape,
Dividing the barrier between flesh and fiction.
