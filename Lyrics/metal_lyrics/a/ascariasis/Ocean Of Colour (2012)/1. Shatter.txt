Shatter under the weight of truth,
Suffocate under the veil
You've blindly cast before your eyes.
Ruin and decay
Are all that remain of a world once pure,
Bury me under the illusion
Of all that you've ever known.

Drown in the river never crossed.
Burn with the kingdom you've created.

From the ashes may you open your eyes,
And see the world that you've left behind.
