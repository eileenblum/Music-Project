Still grey fields, and black vein silhouettes
Idle beneath an auburn sky,
An ominous stage hosting unending tragedy.

When all is buried,
Only then will we lament the faded.

Like shards to sand, and sand to the sea,
We will all fade into eternity,
An endless cycle, until the last tear falls.
And as I stand, between beauty and decay,
I remember not what I have lost,
But what I will be remembered for.

Ruin consuming
Decrepit remains,
A broken landscape stained with pestilence.

Solace bound within reverie,
Above graves of the departed.

When all is buried,
Only then will we lament the faded.

Like shards to sand, and sand to the sea,
We will all fade into eternity
An endless cycle, until the last tear falls.
And as I stand, between beauty and decay,
I remember not what I have lost,
But what I will be remembered for.

When the sun meets the sky,
Where the moon breaks the earth,
You will find me here,
Drifting through an ocean of colour.
