I've lived to see adoration break, and crumble under the plight of adversity;
Vows bound under hollow words.
Foundations, and illusions of hope dissolve amongst a sea of temptation.

Only perseverance remains
On this path I've walked so long.
Through anguish we must rise,
To carve the world before our eyes.

Let valiance grow in the wake of affliction
And silence the deafening resonance of doubt.

I've seen dreams of salvation fall through trembling hands and wither in solitude.

Only perseverance remains
On this path I've walked so long.
Through anguish we must rise,
To carve the world before our eyes.

I've seen the will of the unbreakable decay like fallen leaves.
And the pure corrupted by false convictions.
But I will remain still.

I watched as your shadow faded, your fragrance lingering in idle air.
I watched our words collapse and lay in ruin.

Through anguish we will rise,
To carve the world before our eyes.
