Standing vigil to a concrete pantheon
I count the blessings of a dying generation
And we are broken
Forever cradling wounds beyond counting

There is a cross
Not within my heart
But where our threads entwine
I walk beneath a pagan sky

Below the gaze of the father
Above the heart of the mother
I drink the blood of Gaia
And return my bones to the soil

This is the grace of god
And the embrace of the devil
And it is inescapable
