Prince of Hell sen forth your hordes
Darkness shall engulf the light

Satan's army march on blackest wings
Wrath of hatred spilling christian blood

Lucifer discarded one reap thy vengeance
With the blood of angels

Come to me, o father of fire
Bring forth the winds of war
Raise thyne armies of the dead
The lambs are weak, o dark one

Blood and war, the heavens shall burn
The sky burns red - eternal night

The deserts turn to ice - the seas to fire
The glory of Satan is at hand

Battalions of Hades stand fast
Wash the land with blood

The reaper of souls
Stands over the world
Ready to harvest the dead
Demons celebrate the holocaust

Bloodlust reigns supreme
The ancient prophecy has come to be
The immortal onslaught cannot be stopped
Belial is victorious in armageddon

Dark angels of hell arise
Desecrate the halls of heaven
Behold the recrucifixion of christ
As the king weeps
At the fall of his kingdom

Pagan spirits roam the forest once more
The dead rise from their graves
The time of lust is upon us
Behold the resurrection of Sodom

The raging storm of ice and terror
The angels fall on frozen wings

God is dead, enslave the world
Lucifer reigns in his ebony kingdom
