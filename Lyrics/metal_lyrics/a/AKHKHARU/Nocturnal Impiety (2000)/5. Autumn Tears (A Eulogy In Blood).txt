My bride I bury this day
In a silk litted box my rose withers
I can hear her soul calling to me
Mournful whispers fill the night

By your grave I sit weeping
The dead come to comfort me
In my immortal suffering
Thought, triumphant in evil
I am nothing without my queen

Sheddng the blood from my veins
I summon thee back
To rule in blasphemy at my side
Just one kiss
And we shall ride the blackened winds
For all eternity
