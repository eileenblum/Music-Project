Dark mistress come and caress my weeping soul
Drink of the melancholy of my heart
Enshroud me in your love
End this lonely sorrow
Nights of unrest
Grasping of shadows
But she is not there

Here voice calls out
From the silence
Seductive whispers
For her embrace
The despair of wanting

Come my beloved take my hand
Let us ascend into the night
Drink of my blood let us become as one
We ride the winds of immortality
Existing in shadows

As the sun fades we awaken from our slumber
Rising from the crypt driven by hunger
Hunting my prey of pathetic mortals
Blood to be supped like wine so sweet is their suffering
