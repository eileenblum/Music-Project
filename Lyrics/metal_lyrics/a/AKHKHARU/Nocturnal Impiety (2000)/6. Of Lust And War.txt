Blood stains my sword
As the christian liar
Lay before me
Drowned is his own blood

We seek revenge
For the innocents slaughtered
In the name of christ
Pierce the womb of the hole mother
Of your despicable god

Drain the essence from my broken victims
My gullet full your flesh I now seek
Consummate this evil union
Darkest passion my lust for you

Suckled at my breast
We bathe in the bloodof the fallen
Usurp the throne
This kingdom is yours my love and master

Crush thyne enemy
Death to all who oppose
For you I will conquer the earth
And burn the wretched heavens
