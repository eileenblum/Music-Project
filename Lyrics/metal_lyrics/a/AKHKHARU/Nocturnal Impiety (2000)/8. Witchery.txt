I summon the creature of darkness
By the works of darkness
I summon thee creature of the wastes
By the rites of the wastes
I summon thee creature of pain
By the words of pain

Ceremonial candles burn
The sacrifice upon the altar
She kneels in the circle
To summon th ancient ones
To seek their vengeance
Upon the face of the eaerth
To reclaim th universe
Take back what once was theirs

The blood has been spilt
The incarnation recited
Release the demon
Trapped behind the gate

The darkest whispers
Swirling winds
From the bowels of the earth
Call the unholy trinity

Dance of seduction
My evil queen
Sorceress of my desire
I will do thy bidding

The spirit enters her form
Possession of the soul
Descend to the depths
Journey to ethereal realms

Witchery - cast the spell
Witchery - born of fire
Witchery - weave the magic
Witchery - ending humanity

She calls upon the winds
Harness the power of the beast
Blackened soulless form
Unlock the keys of damnation
