At night she calls to me
The glistening moon reflects
From the misty forest

Blackened realms of majesty
A cry heard in the wind
Beckons me with seduction
Calling me
Haunting me

Come with me to the other side
Leave this foulest earth

Beckon me to the woods at night
A wolf takes human form - It is her
The lips I ache to kiss
The flesh I long to taste
A love once dead lives again
Calling me
Haunting me

Come with me to the other side
Leave this foulest earth
When love is lost
A pain centuries old
Returns once again

Passion burns through my veins like fire
To feel your touch once more my desire

I gaze upon thy beauty
In the pale cemetery night
You are the end to all my pain
Enrapture me with your kiss
This darkened night

Thy haunting spectre
My spirit has come for thee

Hear my unearthly voice
Calling from beyond the grave
I summon you to these woods
So I may taste your lips once more
