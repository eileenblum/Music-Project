New targets burn beneath me
Another missionâs going fine
The A.R.S. still screams

I see people dying
Screaming, bleeding, crying
Begging for a truce

Shootinâ, crushinâ them all
I won't spare anyone
Other flames will rise

Glory will be mine
Nothing will remain

Waste no more
Waste no more
Waste no more
Waste no more

Something is changing
I am the one whoâs hunted
Enemies are closer now

Headquarters are too far
And now that I'm dying
They plan the next attack

Falling, now itâs clear
With the blood on my hands
Iâll just die in vain

Coffins dressed in line
Medals on the graves

Waste no more
Waste no more
Waste no more
No!

No more!

Donât call me hero Iâm just dead in vain
Now someoneâs cryinâ out with pain
Lords of destruction still search for new strength
War will go on without me

And Iâm sure
Tears and pain
Wonât end
No one will fight
For peace
They steal your life
To kill
This is the waste
