Deep in the night
A door at the bottom
Of my mind opens
A deadly secret is set free

I am crushed
By the vision
I am living
Is Madness
Covering me with her black cloak?

I have never lived
This bad experience,
But there are too many
Details to be a dream

Terror grips me
With his iron fingers
As cold as metal
As sharp as razors

Somethingâs coming,
Towards my chained body,
A menacing shape with a... sinister whistling

I have never lived
This bad experience,
But there are too many
Details to be a dream

No escape is
Allowed here
Sweat drops like
Acid rain
Iâm done for

No escape is
Allowed here
Sweat drops like
Acid rain
Iâm done for, no!

Terror grips me
With his iron fingers
As cold as metal
As sharp as razors

No one can help me:
The circular sawâs near
Have I died
Before this life?

I have never lived
This bad experience,
But there are too many
Details to be a dream
