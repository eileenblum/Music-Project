I was the king of peace and people will remind me
In a thousand years from now my laws will be respected

Death
Wonât make
My reign
Fall down

My spirit roams through time to care for what I've left
People without leaders could lose the justiceâs way
And the men who killed me would like to bring the anarchy
My sons need their fatherâs hands to live without fear

Put
The crown
Upon
My skull

So I will come back from my grave
Once again I will lead you

What Iâve been will rule through time
My deeds made me immortal
If you need an icon
Put the crown upon my skull

What Iâve been will rule through time
My deeds made me immortal
If you need an icon
Put the crown upon my skull

What Iâve been will rule through time
My deeds made me immortal
If you need an icon
Put the crown upon my skull
