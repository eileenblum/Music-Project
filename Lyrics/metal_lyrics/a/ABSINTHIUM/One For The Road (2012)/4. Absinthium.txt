Itâs 3 oâ clock in the night.
I canât believe my sight.
Iâm on the wrong side of me.
Nothing's what it used to be.

Help me.

Oh, please help me!

Iâm in a maze of perceptions,
Confused by white noise and visions.
Don't know if my eyes are open,
My linkage to reason is broken

Green fairy's near.

The walls around become softer,
Truth comes with no filter.
Now I begin understanding
While a green light is surrounding me

I see
I'm in the right place to be.
I feel
My only reality's here.
By now
I'm not afraid of being me.
Absinthium
Is making my soul wander free.

Finally free!

The bottle is empty again now
Donât wanna come back to fly low.
Denying this world I will search fast
A glass of hope to kill my past

I see
I'm in the right place to be.
I feel
My only reality's here.
By now
I'm not afraid of being me.
Absinthium
Is making my soul wander free.

"They want me"
Is what the green fairy told me.
They canât see
Realityâs just their illusion.

I wonât tell
The secret of my new dimension.
Itâs a spell,
Take a shot and youâll see.

Absinthium!

The walls around become softer,
Truth comes with no filter
And Iâm proud, understanding
A green light is here to save me

I see
I'm in the right place to be.
I feel
My only reality's here.
By now
I'm not afraid of being me.
Absinthium
Is making my soul wander free.

I see
I'm in the right place to be.
I feel
My only reality's here.
By now
I'm not afraid of being me.
Absinthium
Is making my soul wander free.
