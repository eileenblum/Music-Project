Hey you, hidden behind God
Donât you know that life will end even for you?
Live it, let us live as it comes
Try to forget all those teachings
Hypocrisy, lies, ignorance
Raping brains of the believing people
Nevermore you will judge me
Call me âsinnerâ while I break all your rules now

Stay on your knees and just pray loud
Be sure that so He will be proud
That book has taught you the way to
Do everything in the right way
âDonât look, donât touch, donât desire itâ
And try to keep in control, even your heartbeat
I know why youâve chosen this life
Itâs just the only way to be safe

How much does absolution cost?
How many sinners at your door!
You give me advices I didnât ask
I know thereâs evil under your mask
You stand on the altar with bread and wine
You care âbout Christâs body, why not mine?
âPlease make an offerâ is what you say
Compromise is a price Iâll never pay

Black gown
Is covering your soul
Donât try to freeze my feelings, man

Stay down
Praying to avoid Hell
Save my soul for I have sinned

Good things 
Seem not to be allowed
âBow downâ is your approach to life

How much does absolution cost?
How many sinners at your door!
You give me advices I didnât ask
I know thereâs evil under your mask
You stand on the altar with bread and wine
You care âbout Christâs body, why not mine?
âPlease make an offer â is what you say
Compromise is a price Iâll never pay

Hey you, hidden behind God
Donât you know that life will end even for you?
Nevermore you will judge me
Call me âsinnerâ âcos Iâll break all your rules soon
Educate, teach, wash brains
Even lie, but just give an answer
Faithfuls bring your daily bread
Bigots will sit at your banquet
