What have you done in this life?
Time is gone now
Torturing thoughts and regrets
No more chances

Nightmares are keeping you awake
While you cry your lifeâs a joke
Nobody there, nobody cares youâre alone!

...Againâ¦

She heard your call now sheâs here
âLetâs make a dealâ
Give her your soul, sheâs the cure
Pull the trigger

Suicide will end all the pain
And will make you start again
To revenge, to rearrange or just to hate!

Hail to a new life in death youâre reborn
She takes your soul
Kills your grief
Eats your feelings
Feeds your hate

Hate everything
Hate everyone
Youâve just one precept:
Hate always in life!

Hail
Hail
Hail
Hail

Spirits of your past life disappear
Emptiness replacing every fear
Living just to hate thatâs why youâre here
Make them feel how bitter are their tearsâ¦

Now that youâre born once again
Enjoy new life
No wars to fight, no more pain
Nothing but hate

Nightmares wonât keep you awake
And your life is still a joke
Nobody there, nobody cares youâre alone!

Hail to a new life in death youâre reborn
She takes your soul
Kills your grief
Eats your feelings
Feeds your hate

Hate everything
Hate everyone
Still just one precept:
Hate always in life!

Hail
Hail
Hail
Hail
