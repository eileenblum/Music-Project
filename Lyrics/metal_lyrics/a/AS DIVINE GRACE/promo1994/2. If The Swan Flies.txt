Like the evening sun I die
But I remember smile
As I writhe-I laugh

Come fly with me and nourish the wind
Fly as the swan and sylph esteem you

Lie there my heart
I walk bleak path
I veil another time with tears

I hear nightingale's song from eternity
It sear my soul

Come...
Fly...

The beauty of this dawn
Her unfading glow enshare me
I soar into her arms
She dress me with kisses

The frail wind swings my blue cradle
I bask in there

Come...
Fly...

I utter my farewell
...if the swan fly...
