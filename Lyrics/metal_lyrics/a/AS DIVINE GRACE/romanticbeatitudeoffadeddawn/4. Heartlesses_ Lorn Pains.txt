Dark swallows my soul
oh dark my heartless friend
You gave me dead memories
I hear voice as old as time

Listen my rhapsody
You relief my feels
Ipour my lorn pain
Bless me that I gain

When I was young
my eyes were as bright
as stars of northern sky

I glide
I slumber in vast meadow
I slumber
I glide slowly to mirage

Soulless person is evil
And evil person is beast
I have been forgotten my fathers face
You made me for yourself heartless person
