They are roaming in graceful dreams
Until they find the twisted mind
And they give the power
change nightmare to be real

You don't know where you came from
but I know where you will come
I am your memory
Dreams are forever
I burn the past

Eternal life where souls release
spread your wings beauty fades
Who am I my wings are screaming
I pleasant plight I am dead
