All those Gods my heavenly friens how I adore them
I'm walking from past As shades show the way In my dark...
My falling tears are eyes of God
Those sinless eyes see trough my dreams

Because the ground gives away under me
to the very toes I am terrified
Oh god wake me from this dream which you see

I am dancing again in endless rain from wells of souls
Shapes of God Enthral my falling soul
Dreams are dark and deep
but I have promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep
