Take what I take.
Get what I've got too.
There's no one
Had done what I can do.

Make what I've made.
I cannot sing
And bring myself
To do something.

I press my old brain
Through a sieve.
World needs the brainmash
Going to achieve.

I'm friend o mine
You're just a foe.
There's no one
There's no.

Why do I trust you, foe.
It was just a fake.
Watching for another brake
Choose another way
I know you're just a foe.
Get yourself away, my own.
