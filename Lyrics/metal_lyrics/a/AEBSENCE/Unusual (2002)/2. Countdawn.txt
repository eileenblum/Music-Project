I won't sleep, I won't lie
Down on my bed, I have to try
To wait up for coming dawn
'Til sorrow leaves me alone

My weak knees bend under the burden
I collapsed for no apparent reason.
Your sacrifice is not enough,
To forbidden god I'm praying tough

I help myself with countdawn
Keep me away the evil until dawn
One is doubt, two is fear
Three...my shock will not disappear
