Legalize, liberate.
Suffered feelings, suffocate.
Winter's dancing in your garden
Round and round and round.

Solitude is prostitute,
Rejectable attitude.
Neverending timeless life
Is it sign me, form me ?

Never talk about it.
Chance zero terrifies your life.
Domestic orders only
Why do you hurt me? why...terrify me?

Summer it makes me hollow.
Winter fill my soul with sorrow.
Spring, it kills me.
But fall brings the darkest times.
