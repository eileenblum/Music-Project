Not the moon, not the sun,
Not the sorrow has just begun,
Not the sorrow, not the hollow,
Maybe it'll change I'll wait tomorrow.

Take a look for better times.
Weeping shakes your belly.
I hear, I feel, I see you cry.
Get at least a smile...

Not the moon, not the sun,
Not the sorrow's just begun,
Not the sorrow, not the hollow,
Maybe it'll change I'll wait tomorrow.

Take a look for better...
