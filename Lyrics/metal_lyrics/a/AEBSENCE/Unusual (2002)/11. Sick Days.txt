Sick days have gone away
But I can't to hate so much these days.
Little electric sparks i think
They turned dead in your soul.

I never can to find, never can to lie,
never can to hate, never can to leave
I never can to find your love babe.

Call my name, drive away,
That's beyond me what you say.
Sounds of your tiny sighs are
Chasing in my ears.

I don't want to find, don't want to lie,
Don't want to hate, don't want to leave
I don't want to find your love babe.
