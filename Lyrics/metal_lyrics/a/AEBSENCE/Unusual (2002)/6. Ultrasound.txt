So coward I am
In my world
Many gorgeous men
Courageous hearts
With stolen coats
And frozen hands
And stingers
'Mong them fingers.

What do you want for me.
I'm not a hero.
Just a cero-plastic puppet.
A stain on a carpet.
I cannot kill.
This is my will.

"No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity,
But I know none, therefore I'm no beast."
That's all what I know.
I cannot see the end of the road.
It's surrounded by haze.
The consequence is clear: my mind
Is settled down by daze.

Every little voice I hear
Must be ultrasound
Everything I managed to clear
Will be all over (with) mud
I cannot see the end of the road.
It's surrounded by haze.
The consequence is clear: my mind
Is settled down by daze.

This could be the human race.
I can't see your pretty face.
I can't kiss you, I won't kill.
This is my will.
You know, I know I'm no beast.
It's not a gun I'm holding my fist.
But you my friend has no bounds.
