I locked my door to be alone
And cleaned my soul.but
I can't understand, why do the
Negative thoughts come again.

I sell my soul, i sell my thoughts.
Restless feeling never goes.
Bad remains, they come again
And spoil my blood, dust my vein.

Nothin' to say, can't find the words.
Hey, stop the rain !
I can't understand, why do the
Negative thoughts come again.

I sell my...
Such a sorrow in my heart...

I've slept before, you close your eyes.
Escape, because
I can't understand, why do the
Negative thoughts come again.

I sell my...
