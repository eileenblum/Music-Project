She haunts me in dreams
I see her silhouette dance across landscapes
Of golden light and autumn
In my dreams...

Her soft eyes see (The thing I'd give...)
Through my tortured soul (...to prove myself to her...)
Vanishing (...to make her see)
Any hope for fantasy

Jaded eyes awake as her selfish words rain from such placid lips
Still I kiss her silken flesh

Frigid air leaves me breathless
Frigid air leaves me breathless
Foolish agony fills my lungs as I try to scream for her
I confess... I scare myself
Through the howling wind, on my knees, I cry
Listen to me...

I'm broken by her silence to a love unseen
Blood soaked feathers rained down
My wingless angel so broken falls gracefully from the sky
To waiting arms...
To waiting arms...

Frigid air leaves me breathless
Frigid air leaves me breathless
Foolish agony fills my lungs as I try to scream for her
I confess... I scare myself

Frigid air leaves me breathless
Frigid air leaves me breathless
Foolish agony fills my lungs as I try to scream for her
I confess... I scare myself
Through the howling wind, on my knees, I cry
Listen to me...

Such foolish agony fills my lungs as I try to scream for her
Jaded eyes wake to the sounds of my voice as I scream to her
In dreams I've seen her silhouette dance across golden light
And autumn...In my dreams...

In my dreams skies so burdened let her go
As cold rain falls, so does she
My desires whither, broken once more
Soft hands take one so fair she haunts me
