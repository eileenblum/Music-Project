You've taken the last...of me

The guise of your innocence shall not protect you from the wake of my wrath
You've taken the last of me, blame the end on yourself
You deserve each tear that falls
Scratch out your eyes and the blood will drown you in red
And I will leave you for dead
A lovely evening draped in regret

The shadow of justice now engulfs you as cold hands reap the pain they've sewn
You've taken the last of me, blame the end on yourself
You deserve each tear that falls
Scratch out your eyes and the blood will drown you in red
And I will leave you for dead
A lovely evening draped in regret...forever gone...

The taste of your death replaced the smell of your breath
A lovely evening draped in regret
Suffocate your will to...live with my pain
You were so easily seduced by greed
You could never feel my calloused hands closing around your throat

Wake into the nightmare that has become our love, may
Your screams never cease
You've taken the last of me

(Not all knights in shining armor can make your dreams come true)
