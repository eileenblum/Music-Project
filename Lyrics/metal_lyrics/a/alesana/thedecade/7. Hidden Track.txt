Dear love, I'm honestly scared. Your voice is everywhere. Are you there? Oh, I am not ready for this. There's so much about you, love, I miss.

Do you know that I'm lost? And you left me here on my own. Songs live on but I'm dancing alone. Where is my lullaby?

Sometimes I forget you're gone. You're all I have, known for so long.

Do you know that I'm lost? And you left me here on my own. Songs live on but I'm dancing alone. Where is my lullaby?

(It seems so unfair but the sun still shines and the waves still crash and the wind still blows) (I'll never let go, love. Tonight, I say goodbye) I'm closing my eyes! (I will carry on, what choice do I have. But without your love, smiles are meaningless) I'm closing my eyes! (I'll never let go, love. Tonight, I say goodbye)

(It seems so unfair but the sun still shines and the waves still crash and the wind still blows) (I'll never let go, love. Tonight, I say goodbye) I'm closing my eyes! (I will carry on, what choice do I have. But without your love, smiles are meaningless) (I'll never let go, love. Tonight, I say goodbye)

Do you know that I'm lost? And you left me here on my own. Songs live on but I'm dancing alone.

My hand is lost without yours to hold in mine.

And tonight I will say goodbye.
