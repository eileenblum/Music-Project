Stay to the path
Trust only your faith, to falter is to hasten your doom
I dare not say my hope is slipping away
Such gleaming fangs mock the gilded gates
The way of the true
Tell me what to do sweet spirit

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Your wildest dreams have come true!
Welcome to what I call hell!
Help me!

Infatuation has strangled me again
There's no resisting the tangled web of your secret fantasy
A strange sensation is falling over me
I may be blind but I can see your kiss will punish me
Your kiss will ruin me

Well, here we go!
I tear myself from the beaten path never to look back
And still I glance, the lure of a forbidden dance
I'm hypnotized by the sordid nymph who races from me
Suddenly, my eyes see clearly

Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Your wildest dreams have come true!
Welcome to what I call hell!
Help me!

Infatuation has strangled me again
There's no resisting the tangled web of your secret fantasy
A strange sensation is falling over me
I may be blind but I can see your kiss will punish me
Your kiss will ruin me

I fall down on my knees in anticipation of the dawning
Curiosity is laughing
I decide that if I'm to die here I will not go calmly
I will not go down without a fight
Help me!

Infatuation has strangled me again
There's no resisting the tangled web of your secret fantasy
A strange sensation is falling over me
I may be blind but I can see your kiss will punish me
Your kiss will ruin me

Your wildest dreams have come true
