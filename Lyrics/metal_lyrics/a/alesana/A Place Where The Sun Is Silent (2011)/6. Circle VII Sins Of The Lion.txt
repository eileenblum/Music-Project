Oh, the violence.

The ocean beckons with its gaze
Pulling me beneath the waves
Their fury is second to none!

Oh the violence.

Itâs clawing at my burning skin
Filling my heart with its sin,
human reason is washed away!

Am I the first to be fooled by your dirty little trick?
I guess I should have seen this coming,
I will not forget
I will not forget
(Is washed away)

Iâm the one who has to swallow water,
thatâs what I get for chasing after you!
You should be hanging by your neck,
swinging there silently!

I canât stop the bleeding
Tell me that you want me if you need me.
Tell me that you love me if you want me.
Your dying eyes tell a story of poisonous passion
Tell me you want me, do you want me?
Tell me you want me, do you love me?

It is quite clear you despise me by showing your face here
And you never even told me why you disappeared!
why you disappeared!
(Is washed away)

Iâm the one who has to swallow water,
thatâs what I get for chasing after you!
You should be hanging by your neck,
swinging there silently!

I canât stop the bleeding
Tell me that you want me if you need me.
Tell me that you love me if you want me.
Your dying eyes tell a story of poisonous passion
Tell me you want me, do you want me?
Tell me you want me, do you love me?

A bone-chilling cry erupts!
A bone-chilling cry erupts!

(Iâve seen those eyes but not that smile)
A bone-chilling cry erupts!
(Iâve seen those eyes but not that blank stare)
A bone-chilling cry erupts!
(Iâve seen those eyes but not that blank stare)
A bone-chilling cry erupts!
(Iâve seen those eyes but not that stare)
The tides of sin are stained with blood!

I canât stop the bleeding
Tell me that you want me if you need me.
Tell me that you love me if you want me.
Your dying eyes tell a story of poisonous passion
Tell me you want me, do you want me?
Tell me you want me, do you love me?

You will be sorry when
He spills the blood from your throat!
Youâll be torn limb from limb, tramp!

There will be hell to pay, hell to pay!
