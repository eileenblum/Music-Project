Washed on a shore of enchanted lies and I am breathless
Struggling for reason
How could it be such a wondrous place is trapped in silence?
Give them redemption

Time is melting away. I can't explain. But my eyes are begging to stay
I must say a sunny day helps to push the memories away

âI can't imagine my leaving hereâ
âIt sounds so peaceful. Living in solaceâ
âA perfect vision of ecstasy, a dreamy palace, home to the soullessâ

Time is melting away. I can't explain. But my eyes are begging to stay
I must say a sunny day helps to push the memories away

Walk along a shore of an ocean of rage
Gazing in amazement at each screaming wave
Everywhere I look there's agony and pain
What's the point of fighting when there's nothing to save?

Time is melting away. I can't explain. But my eyes are begging to stay
I must say a sunny day helps to push the memories away

Caution must be obeyedâ¦on an island of the decayed
