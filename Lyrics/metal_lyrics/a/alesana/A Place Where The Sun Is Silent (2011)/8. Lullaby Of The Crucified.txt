My angel close your eyes,
I'll be your lover tonight.
Pitiful lullaby,
I'll be your lover tonight.

My own misery is taunting me.
The air stings my lungs, I can barely see.
Wicked eyes surrounding me, the trees are watching silently.
I could try to run but baby what's the point?

I may never know
(I don't see the point.)
Why I let you go.

My body is aching.
I'm losing my mind!
There's nothing to hold onto.
My angel close your eyes, I'll be your lover tonight.
I'm tired of trying.
I'm sick of waiting!
If there's nothing that I can do.
A pitiful lullaby to sing the tortured to sleep

We could settle down and change the end.
Nothing but time, start over again.
All the little things you do that make me fall in love with you.
Have led me to this, a bittersweet abyss.

I may never know
(a vexatious kiss.)
Why I let you go.

My body is aching.
I'm losing my mind!
There's nothing to hold onto.
My angel close your eyes, I'll be your lover tonight.
I'm tired of trying.
I'm sick of waiting!
If there's nothing that I can do.
A pitiful lullaby to sing the tortured to sleep

I will follow you into the night my darling eyes.
I would do anything to be lying with you as I watch you dream.

Mel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita
Mi ritrovai per una selva oscura,
ChÃ© la diritta via era smarrita.
Esta selva selvaggia e aspra e forte
Che nel pensier rinova la paura!
Lo non so ben ridir com' i' v'intrai,
Tant'era pien di sonno a quel punto
Che la verace via abbandonai
Guardai in alto e vidi le sue spalle
Vestite giÃ  de' raggi del pianeta
Che mena dritto altrui per ogne calle
CosÃ¬ l'animo mio, ch'ancor fuggiva,
Si volse a retro a rimirar lo passo
Che non lasciÃ² giÃ  mai persona viva.

I have been reborn.
Darling, tonight we say goodbye.
Sing a touching lullaby and weâll watch the angels cry.
I have broken free!
Iâm free, Iâm free!
You canât deny me, do not defy me.
Darling, tonight we say goodbye.
Sing a touching lullaby and weâll watch the angels cry.
Iâm drunk on lust and sovereignty.
Abandon all hope for beyond time I stand.
Darling, tonight we say goodbye.
Sing a touching lullaby and weâll watch the angels cry.
I have been reborn.
Darling, tonight we say goodbye.
Sing a touching lullaby and weâll watch the angels cry.
Darling, tonight we say goodbye.
Sing a touching lullaby and weâll watch the angels cry.
