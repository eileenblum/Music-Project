A few prisms of glass offer little comfort in the blackness.
The desolate emptiness drinking every last drop of life thatâs left in me.
I pray for absolution, let me return to the path of a tempting lie.
Lead me towards the light.
Truly, Iâve run awry, my compass is spinning in the shadows.
Itâs funny how we believe the things that we tell ourselves to and our hearts simply follow.
I pray for absolution, let me return to the path of a tempting lie.
Lead me towards the light.
I pray for absolution, let me return to the path of a tempting lie.
Lead me towards the light.
