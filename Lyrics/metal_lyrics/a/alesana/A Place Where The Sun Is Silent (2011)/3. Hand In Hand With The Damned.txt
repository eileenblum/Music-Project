I don't trust myself
I'm trapped drowning in despair, I'm poisonous
I slammed the door and locked it shut and now disaster plagues my thoughts
Let's drink to the dead, "cheers to what's ahead"
I'm poisonous

Sweet temptress, I can see it in your eyes
You're moving on without me
So it ends tonight, I guess this is goodbye
Selfishly you say you're better off without me
And it ends tonight...well baby save your breath

Won't you please have mercy?
Before you push me away let me try to change your mind
Oh wanderer,
If you think this is fun, just you wait 'til I'm done!

Blessed fortune screams,
"Why have you forsaken me?" there's no escape
I never should have lost my way
And now I'm stranded out at sea chasing a lie?
There's no escape, I'm losing the sky

Sweet temptress, I can see it in your eyes
You're moving on without me
So it ends tonight, I guess this is goodbye
Selfishly you say you're better off without me
And it ends tonight...well baby save your breath

Imprisoned soul seized in a chamber of feculent horror
Suffer all you must but suffer silently
Still your cursed tongue, stay your blighted abandon
In your eternal death you hunger for rotten mire
For in your mortal life it was this which was your gift to man
Prepare to walk hand in hand with the damned

God can't help you and angels won't save you
Your unrequited prayers will be the bane of your existence
Prepare to walk hand in hand with the damned

I am poisonous
Is there a way for me to say that you should stay?
I need to know you'll miss me when I'm gone
I'll cherish you until the day I die, a twisted way to make you mine

I can see it in your eyes, you're moving on without me
So it ends tonight, I guess this is goodbye
Selfishly you say you're better off without me
And it ends tonight...well baby save your breath

Won't you please have mercy?
Before you push me away let me try to change your mind
Oh wanderer, if you think this is fun, just you wait 'til I am done!
