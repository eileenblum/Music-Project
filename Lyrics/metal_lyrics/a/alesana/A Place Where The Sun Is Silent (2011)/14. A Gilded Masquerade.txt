As the water drips from the sky
I start to wonder if Iâm still alive
Then I have to find the answer
could it be that it was a dream
and Iâm still beside her?
Right before my eyes
a tragic surprise
the water stops.

Wickedness will rain
and drown us in her sorrow (sorrow and her thirst)
If I hope to survive
I must think faster
I'm losing ground (Iâm losing ground)

Should I pull back her veil?
You had the best of me (the best of me)
as I live is just not wrong.
I may be wrong but your brilliance is my darkness.
You had me convinced.
That together we could fly.
Until I started scratching at the surface (and I saw beyond your masquerade)
Your body is an illness

Temples crashing down all around me
panic chokes the streets
The golden city falls
And with it our lives go up in flames

Should I pull back her veil?
You had the best of me (the best of me)
as I live is just not wrong
I may be wrong but your brilliance is my darkness
You had me convinced
That together we could fly
Until I started scratching at the surface (and I saw beyond your masquerade)
Your body is an illness.

All shall be made clear.
He is watching me under
my blood runs cold.
Thereâs no need to run farther.
I fear I know the truth.
Come into our arms, brother.
I tear back the cowl and stare into my own eyes.
Now we can be one forever.

Who are you, who are you, who are you?
Yeah!

Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

I pull back her veil
You had the best of me (the best of me)
As I live is just not wrong
I may be wrong but your brilliance is my darkness
You had me convinced
that together we could fly
Until I started scratching at the surface (and I saw beyond your masquerade)
Your body is an illness
(I may never be the same again)
I may never be the same again.
