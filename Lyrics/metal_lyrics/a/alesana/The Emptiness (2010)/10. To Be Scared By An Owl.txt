Look at the sky
As the night descends
The rain is crashing down,
I've hit another dead end
Just before I let hope slip away
A shadow is revealed, the devil shows his face

I'm scared to death and have myself to blame,
(I'm to blame)
How did we end up fighting anyway?

You know, I used to search the sky
And dream of where you were
I need you by my side,
We can end this together
I know I promised you the world
And still I let you down
I need you by my side
And together we'll end this now

Look in my eyes! Am I shaking now?
I am all you fear, have I made myself clear?

Shut your mouth and finish what you've started
Boy, you haven't got the slightest idea
Just who I am and what I do for you
Don't you see that I am trying to save you?
Shut your mouth and finish what you've started

I'm scared to death and have myself to blame,
(No one else)
How did we end up fighting anyway?

You know, I used to search the sky
And dream of where you were
I need you by my side,
We can end this together
I know I promised you the world
And still I let you down
I need you by my side
And together we'll end this now

[Speaking:]
As the last rays of sunlight fade,
One killer chases another
Through the tangled madness of the city
A flash of steel announces the presence of his quarry
The stage is set, the night explodes...

You killed her, you murderer
You have stripped me of the one that I love
Annabel, our Annabel
You have no clue what she's capable of...

I'm scared to death and have myself to blame
(I'm scared to death and have myself to blame)
How did we end up fighting anyway?

You know, I used to search the sky
And dream of where you were
I need you by my side,
We can end this together
I know I promised you the world
And still I let you down
I need you by my side
And together we'll end this now

You'd better look behind you...

"Her youthful flush color had drained from her much like the very blood from her veins upon the bedding on which she lied.
Such a foul image for one to behold, but in some twisted way it only seemed to enhance her exquisite beauty, like a lily on a grave.
I have failed.
Once again I have let her down.
My poor, sweet Annabel.
You trusted me; you gave me your love, your soul.
Now I fall to my knees in front of the man who took you from me.
I fall pathetic, defeated.
I will be with you again so soon, my love. So very soon.
The eyes of an angel await me and Iâll be damned if he thinks he can stop me now..."

'Sweetheart? Darling? Turn around.
Itâs me. Follow my voice.
Everything is going to be okay, my love.
Everything will be fine. Itâs all over now..."
