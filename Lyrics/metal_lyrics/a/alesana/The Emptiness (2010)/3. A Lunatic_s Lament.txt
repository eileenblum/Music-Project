If only you could see
If only you could see
You're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
If only you could see
If only you could see...

Should I apologize to such pathetic eyes
Just the sight of you has made me sick tonight (tonight)
It was your poison kiss that turned me into this
Then again there is a chance you could be mine tonight

Darling, will you please take a walk with me?
We can count the stars that disappear...(I wish you could see)
I wish you could see, you're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
Are you satisfied?

(Are you satisfied?)
(Are you satisfied?)

What fate has led me here?.. Oh please forgive me dear
I don't know if I could survive on my own (my own)
I could have married you instead I buried you
Now we'll see if I can fall asleep alone (alone)

Darling, will you please take a walk with me?
We can count the stars that disappear...(I wish you could see)
I wish you could see, you're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
Are you satisfied?

(Are you satisfied?)
The nightmare's coming true
(Are you satisfied?)
Girl it's only you
(Are you satisfied?)
I did it all for you...
(Are you satisfied?)

I wish you could see, you're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
Darling, will you please take a walk with me?
We can count the stars that disappear...(I wish you could see)
I wish you could see, you're the only girl I've ever dreamed of
Are you satisfied?

Are you satisfied?

[Spoken:]
The depths of a man's soul cannot be measured in a manner of meters and fathoms; but rather, it is in my opinion, only quantified by his proximity to heaven and hell.
It was in such a state that I ushered myself past the town tavern, bursting at the seams with the sounds of laughter and drunken piano playing.
Had it only been a different night, a different place, a different kind of man passing by the threshold of that innocent pub, the events that transpired at that point would have undoubtedly been drastically different.
I can only guess if anyone outside that place had a clue when those exclamations of mirth became the desperate screams of the helpless begging for their very lives.
