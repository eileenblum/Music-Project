Here I stand in the cemetery of my dreams
haunted by the torturous reflections of my past memories
Falling tears .. like the forlorn leaves of autumn
a withering ..flower awaiting the spring

Falling tears like forlorn leaves
of a.. neverending autumn
a withering ..flower awaiting the spring

After the shinedown of your sun's light
I no longer fear my departure, I see it joyous, I see it bright

I swear .. I can feel the end coming closer
this misery will soon have a demise

Shallow breaths in a dawnless night
a cut wide open.. a blood-stained ground
red purity soiled by tears..

and as I slowly fade, I feel your presence growing stronger
I see the light from afar , at the end of my dark path
where I'll finally reach my sweet long-awaited end

death is the onely true thing.. 
Grinned I depart.. And it will be soon
the sun will set as I shed my last tear..
and my name will finally be carved .. in stone
