Overwhelming sadness, erases the ecstacy that once dwelled within
my days turned to years..
as I walk whats left of my tragic path 
streams of painful emptiness, hit me again and again

Im hopelessly longing for you to embrace this apethetic living form
save me from the cruelty of reality

I feel your presence everywhere, in every path I take
like a cloud of fog, depression makes its way

Endlessly I drown in my sea of grief
no reason to live, nothing left to believe
oh sweet death, come hold me and take me there
Ease the pain of my everbleeding wound
wash away my despair..

Apathy of life growing deep inside
as I drift away to those old times..
They draw a smile on my face, yet hurt..
Depression takes over, haunts me down, it doesnt seem to end

Days gone forever, but in my heart you are alive
I see you through my tears
I dream of you, Long for you
and still deeply in love with you...
Yet still, another painful tomorrow will start without you..
