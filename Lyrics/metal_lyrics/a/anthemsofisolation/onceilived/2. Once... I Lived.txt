I still recall that day..
When the sun, shined upon my life
the joy, the ease, and the long forgotten feeling of peace
but now, as u walked the path of heaven
i mourn in my mortal existence
wondering everyday, asking the same question: why!

The dawn of a new day, is nothing but a step closer to death
desperately I talk to you in my reverie
with my dying hopes of your return
my scar is an ocean deep,
oh, how i long for my forever sleep
I want to follow you, I choose to die
will this ever end? Will i stop wondering why?

the sun now has shed it's last rays on my life

Farewell, my darling... Till the day i live again
when everything will be well
yes..we'll meet , with stories to tell
you have been rested from this life , so cruel and cold
you were just too innoncent, to live in such world..
