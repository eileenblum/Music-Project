As a tear drops off on his wrinkled face
looming visions of the past are passing, recalling his old days
Deep inside the lingering memories, long way back in time
Lies the smile that once was drawn on the face of an angel
He moans for the heaven that died, many years ago..
Starless nights.. never to dawn again
As he stares at the empty chair..
Living an undying delusion, the fulfilment of his past
Missing what he once had

the fulfillment of the past
a void cursed to last
In the ever darkened prison of present...
Desperation overcame..
The pain became part of him
A life spent trying to forget
A scar so deep that time couldnt heal..
With a heart filled with scorn upon this empty life
and the repeating echos of her angelic hymn
Nothing left to feel but the tormenting echos of the fallen heaven
He lies in silence
Vanishing..
Waiting for his days to end
