Behind walls of silence
and a self-sustaining delusion
lies an embodiment of a deep sorrow

Suffocating the will of survival
A sunlight that blinds
A lie beneath dying worlds

Invisibly killing you from the inside
Silence, darkness.. and hidden fears
A smell of failure.. and rotting dreams

Under the creation of your fake reality
Your blue skies are fading to grey
Like a God-pleading prayer
Your attempt to escape the unescapable
