To the land of deceptive joy I escape
chased by the past's haunting shadows
Intentionally I fall into the beauty of a fake world
In a nostalgia-like state, I long for... a torment
that lies beneath a shroud of delusions

My haunting shadows...
In you I seek a trace
For Im deluded by my own sanity
Yesterday's realities are the imaginations of tomorrow

In a lies-filled emptiness..
Under the dominion of hopelessness..
Drifting to the day the light shivered
Living the denial, resisting the acceptance

[spoken]
the land of joyous deception

My haunting shadows...
In you I seek a trace
Decept me
Drown me in lies
Take me away ..where I belong
away to that land.

[spoken]
But.. still I wonder, over again..

Should I stay there and bear that pain ?
Or should I run away from my own escapism ?

Have you ever felt you can escape yet still imprisoned ??
Have you ever been aware something's poisoned yet still want to taste it ??

A life is lost..
A future.. foretold and dead
The daylight will not return
No.. will not return
And the kingdom of the past shall reign forever..
