What if love still lingers in flames?
Even if you walk away
It canât let you free
Suddenly I own all that you gave
Overdose I ran insane
I canât let you free

Our dreams still burn, but you want to die and I want to die

I need you
cause I breath you
You are my happiness oh my babe
If love seems to hurt
Iâm the witness of the hurt

Iâm hanging on this lost love
You are hanging on this lost love

Iâll be your witness

Come to love like Romeo and Juliet
Burn your love like Romeo and Juliet
Come to love like Romeo and Juliet
Kill yourself like Romeo and Juliet
Iâll be your witness
