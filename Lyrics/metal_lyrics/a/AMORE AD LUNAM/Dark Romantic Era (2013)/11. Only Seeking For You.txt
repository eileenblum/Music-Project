She dress in black
Her razor smile
Her kiss of wild
Again she rage against me

Breath, my love
Understand that Iâm yours I swear that I am
Calm, donât you hurt yourself
My sentimental girl

She starts again
Her dark distrust
And once again
Again she rage against me

You donât know
The places I have been
The demons we shared
Only seeking for you

Donât you know you are my sentimental girl?
