Precious death lies in you
With the coldest of love
Precious death lies in you
When the wind blows grief

(The first rock is falling)
(The death clock is calling)

Agony said to you
That we have no future
Evil rules in this world
Only pain and sorrow

Open arms
Wait for your child

If only I could breathe the fragrance of the wind
Lost ship to oblivion
If only I could break the clouds of bitter rain
Lost ship to oblivion

So I mourn, your cross, this life belongs to death

Emptiness and loneliness
Wine and bread of everyday
