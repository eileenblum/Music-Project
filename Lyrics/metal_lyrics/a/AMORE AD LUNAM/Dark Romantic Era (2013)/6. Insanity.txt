We wear the mask of lies
The one to cheat our hearts
Made with the empty smile, that caresses me all the time
We wander through the night
This emptiness will die?
But our grief itâs all we have

The world has sealed sanity
In the deepest of our hearts
The world has sealed insanity
Over and over in our hearts

In these wounds I recollect
All the memories of her
In this vault fed with despair
I erase my anger
With the sentiment of lost
I regain a garden rot
Wither from the core
A faithless rose

Blood, it feels so cold

It's over
