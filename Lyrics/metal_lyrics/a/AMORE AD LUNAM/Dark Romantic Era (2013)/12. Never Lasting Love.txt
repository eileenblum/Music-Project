Tonight Iâm here
Bringing my secrets to life
Donât be afraid
Tonight Iâm here
Singing a song from the heart
A natural instinct

When I was with you it was life
When I was in you I never lied

My heart speaks the language of solitude I never lied to you
My heart speaks the language of death and love
My never lasting girl

Tonight Iâm here
Giving myself to the faith
I hope that he guides me
Tonight Iâm here
Killing again for the flame
The one that turns me down

I donât want to say goodbye, never want to lose you in life

The cold thatâs in your lips, reminds me of the sin
The sin that haunts me deep, in never lasting love
Oh I donât know why me, I wish that I could be
A kiss to never fall, in never lasting love
