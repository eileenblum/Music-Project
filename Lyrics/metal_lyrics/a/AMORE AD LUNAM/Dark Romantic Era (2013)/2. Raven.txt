It was a night, another night
It was a rain another rain
It was a dream you played with sin
It was a demon girl

Yeah I can feel it in your veins and I can feel it once again
I can see it in your lips, wanting to taste them in the flames, burning in flames

Your raven
Youâre ravenous

It was a girl, another girl
It was a boy, another boy
It was a dream, another sin
It was the secret in your bed

What are you waiting for?
You canât sing alone
I want you to kiss on and on

Let me touch you raven
Let me take you darling
Let me kiss you raven
Let me taste your sweetest
