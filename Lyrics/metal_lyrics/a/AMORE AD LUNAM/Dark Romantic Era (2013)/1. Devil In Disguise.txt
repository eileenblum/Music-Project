By the art of lies we are cursed
Baby I know a did it wrong
But the sentiment feels strong
You are all I ever want

I need your substance
I met your sin
I tasted you wild
Oh my God
You are the devil in disguise

And all I did I did it for you
Baby you know this is the truth
But for all the things youâre pushing through
Now my heart wants to escape from you

You are the devil lying baby
You are the devil lying here

You are you are my devil girl
I lay my heart inside you
I bled your emptiness
And that soâ¦
