As the sun,sheâs here to burn, the faith of your eyes
Melodic moans oh vampire touch, caress my bloody ice

Oh scary girl my sweet girls, when youâll be satisfy? Will you embrace your fate tonight?

I will rise in your heart
To embrace you with the cold and caress you with the frozen touch of love
She will rise in my heart
To become in my last hope and to become a love who never reach his end

As the moon, she dress in white, the pale of her back
Her tongue begin so delicate but then become so wild
