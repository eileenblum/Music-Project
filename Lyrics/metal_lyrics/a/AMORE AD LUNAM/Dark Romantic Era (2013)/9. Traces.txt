I take you for a ride
On a big machine
To seduce the traces
Between you and me

Waking from despair
All this pain to heal
To embrace the fire of the seventh seal

I can ease your burning, just close your eyes

Warm me in your crimson flames
Freeze me in inferno
Fuel me with venom today
Lead me to your traces of love

Give me all the time
All the time to sleep
In a bed of feathers
Only you and me
