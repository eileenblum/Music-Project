Iâm on your blackest dream
Where everything itâs lost
Why donât you tell me?
Oh help me understand it?

Baby you have your heaven
But itâs not forever
You have to keep on crying
A thousand angels dying

The game you need to play
Youâll find it down
The game you need to win
Itâs down here

DespiÃ©rtame esta vez, donde el sol caliente tu piel
DespiÃ©rtame esta vez, los Ã¡ngeles volverÃ¡n
