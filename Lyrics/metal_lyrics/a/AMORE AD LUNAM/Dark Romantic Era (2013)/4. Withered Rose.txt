As you lay in the soil
As you bend your knees to dust
You are craving for tomorrow
In your sadness, Amor

As I crawl into your heavens
In your midnight sun I shine
Where the darkness fell to love you
I shall give you my heart

In this road to nowhere
We are cursed to fall
Maybe savings in somewhere
Ease your sadness, Amor

Darling donât you go away
Darling donât you turn away
Darling donât you be astray
