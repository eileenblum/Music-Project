Inside my heart itâs buried
A cross fueled with poison
And that cross fueled with poison
Gives life to this bitter soul

Sheâs in love as darkness sings her song

In your arms, I can lose and follow your sweet
In your dims, I can bliss tomorrow in your fantasy
In your dreams, I can feel the sorrow deep inside
In your flesh, I can ease tomorrow oh my love

Thereâs no turning back
