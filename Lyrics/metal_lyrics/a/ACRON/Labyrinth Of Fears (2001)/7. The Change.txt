I've made many mistakes, I've lied many times
hoping to change my life
living without be able to show
what I really am
only empty eyes follow my pain
I've denied God many times
father of my loneliness

oh, divine source of my tears
now I'm in front of you
I don't need your forgiveness
but give me another chance

kill me, gobble me
feed yourselves on my life
quench your thirst with my blood
there's no meaning at all, anymore
when there's no time for a change

you took off my breath
but not my life
it's written in our destiny
that evil never dies
I've denied God many times
creator of my agony
all the evil I've done

all that I'd like now
is to start all over again

kill me, gobble me
feed yourselves on my life
quench your thirst with my blood
there's no use in asking God's help
now that I don't want to change
