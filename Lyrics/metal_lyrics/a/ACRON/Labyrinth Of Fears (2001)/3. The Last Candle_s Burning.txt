someone is calling me
breaking the walls of my mind
known voices invoke me
it's time to open the gates
reflected on the mirror
the eyes of the damned
no one can sentence me

your screams in my nightmares
your stare in my eyes
your innocence in my soul
the last candle's burning

the eyes of truth in the mirror
your hot blood slowed down its flow
yourbreath has stopped
your dream is broken
the last candle's burning

let me guide another victim in my mournful world
let me hear her screams
let me devour her flesh
reflected on the mirror
the eyes of the damned
no one can sentence me
