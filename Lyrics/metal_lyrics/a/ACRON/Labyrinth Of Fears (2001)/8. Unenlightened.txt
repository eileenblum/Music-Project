it's me, something that doesn't exist anymore
just the shadow of what I was - a human being
I remember the life I lived, now so far away
memories are preserving my human part

I want a crystal heart
to not feel this cries

the beast is a part of me, I need it
that's why I'll always have to fight it
inviting power and desire
it wants to take away the light of my soul

it's me, forced to eat those I once belonged to
at every drop I fall down,  more and more
a long night that will never end
the only dawn I see comes from my mind
