lost in the land of nowhere
floating in a misty cloud of wonder
the quest has just began
through this dreamland I will travel
knowing just what I don't need to be
I'll start the search for the unknown
but all this seems so strange to me
like a race against a backward flowing time

timeless clocks unticking
I hear my lost voice calling from where I've never been
time - look the sand as it falls up
killing future, breeding past, annihilating memory

so here I wander, I'm looking for the path
lost between signs of time and ghosts of a truth supposed to be
so here I wander, I'll keep my eyes closed to foresee
where this dream will take me, when I will be free to live again
passing through the portals of mortal life

deep inside unreality
still roaming through this land of nowhere
echoes of a future that existed in the past
instantaneous feelings strike me
I hear voices from unborn existences
and see shadows of what shall be
suspended in a backward flowing time

a dream from which you can't awake
a life from which you aren't able to escape
no means to comprehend
the ultimate collapse of universe
a secret has still to be unveiled
the mistery of the sacred harmony
which lies beneath the twisting
of this backward flowing time
