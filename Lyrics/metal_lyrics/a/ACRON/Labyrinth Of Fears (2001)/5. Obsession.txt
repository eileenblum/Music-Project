millions of images are growing in my eyes
as they vortically twist
a state of confusion absorbs my sight

feelings of claustrophobia dwell inside my shadow
hitting every obstacle
I'm breathlessly dragging myself to the goal
faded vision confuse my path
suspended in a supernatural dimension
I try to resist

paralyzed by obsession

strange eyes, unknown faces
surrounded by fears I try to escape
drowning in a sea of terror
I try to escape

by the light of just one candle
I walk through this dark dead end
symbols and screams follow my steps
while the cold wind of tragedy cuts my skin
