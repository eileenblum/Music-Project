The night has decreed,
the wretched born of her pale breast
shall purge their thirst upon the throats of you vermin.
The dread of mankind
has too long plagued my ancient race.
My shadow shall endlessly stretch across the land.

The streets shall run red by dawn in silence;
taking the form of my prey at daybreak.
Kingdoms shall kneel at my feet by the thousands,
fearing the sound of my voice forever.

I'm envenomed with this avarice,
plagued by thirst as old as man.
My wings of doubt, unhinged;
cry to the empty skies.
Your enemies may have come upon
the backs of their horses,
but it is upon wings that your miseries have come.

Cry to the empty skies.
What hath God wrought?

The warmth within your veins
shall burn the darkness in my heart.

My form once seen before
in the nightmares of children and cowards.

I, that of a world beyond the stars
have brought from the crypt, eternal life.

"He came with the sunset,
disguised with the face of a man."

Your suffering shall be legendary.

I'm envenomed with this avarice,
plagued by thirst as old as man.
My wings of doubt, unhinged;
cry to the empty skies.
Your enemies may have come upon
the backs of their horses,
but it is upon wings that your miseries have come.

Cry to the empty skies.
What hath God wrought?

The warmth within your veins
shall burn the darkness in my heart.

My form once seen before
in the nightmares of children and cowards.

My brethren of the night come forth!
