Through your teeth will my desire give life to this sickening perversion, this distortion of passion.
Oh how this infernal evening hath surrendered the beat of my heart.
With every lacerating breath do my veins swell in eager await.
"Devour me," I beg of you in quickened breath.
My flesh enveloped in this most disgusting forms of mortal indulgence.
Do not deny me pleasure, for we now unabridged will be complete as I shall rest inside of you forevermore.
In orgasmic captivation am I pleased with such voracity.
Let go your moral anchor and descend beside me.
Our hands, in flesh made metaphor, entwined forever.
This love I have offered in banquet, be yours.
The entombment within, my only desire; the beating of your frail heart to serenade the sleepless nights.
My hands around your throat, your teeth embedded in my flesh.
I am enthralled in vile lust.
Let your desire consume me.
