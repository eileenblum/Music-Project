My veins begin to freeze
As I adapt to cryogenic sleep
Slowly losing consciousness
In the grasp of high-technology

I'm falling through the scrying window
Spinning, through a spheric world
Confluent, psychedelic
Flashing visions clear

Holographic, schematic
Molecular reversal
Transmutation, acceleration
Access to myself

[Verse:]
I am on journey through the sanctum of myself
I am searching for the secrets of my soul
I am experiencing the depths of my mind
I'll find entrance to inner dominnon

[Chorus:]
I chase myself through the maze
Just to find what's in it
Facing the mirror of emotions
The spectrum of my spirit

Revive memories, impale oblivion
I am present, in my own mind

[Verse:]
I am on journey through the sanctum of myself
I am searching for the secrets of my soul
I am experiencing the depths of my mind
I'll find entrance to inner dominnon

[Chorus:]
I chase myself through the maze
Just to find what's in it
Facing the mirror of emotions
The spectrum of my spirit

Second freeze, vacuum time... reality denied
Collapsing mind, trapped inside...
Forever I will die!

I am running mindless through the maze
As I face entrance to the gate
Behind that gate there's just another maze
This is eternity, I am forced to face
I see the image of my spirit's spectrum
Every color has turned black or grey
There are no limits to how much the soul can suffer
I will experience for an eternity...
