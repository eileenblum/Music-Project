Cleansing my soul in temples of light
Reborn with god's love, delivered from the night
Given a second chance with a new life in sight
But after a day there's always a night...

Travelling through this life
To attain the unknown goal
The quest of putting an end to the strife
That binds one to ones toll
Altering, adjusting the ways
To find the golden path
Attempting to master the maze
Mitigating the inevitable aftermath

Roaming between religions
Between different ways of thought
Seeking for the meaning of life
Is something every man has sought

Grasping for the truths of life
And what we're living for
Without the capacity to solve the riddle
We wonder 'til we are no more

[Bridge:]
Outdistancing the suns of the past
Leaving them all behind
Looking yonder at what's ahead
Hiding the dark thoughts in the haze of your mind
Following guides and signs
Utilizing the different charts
Studying the sciences
Desiring to master the arts

Roaming between religions
Between different ways of thought
Seeking for the meaning of life
Is something every man has sought

Seeking for the answers untold
Collection knowledge to forsee what'll be
After this death... shall it all unfold?
After this life... is there nothing but eternity?

[Bridge:]
Outdistancing the suns of the past
Leaving them all behind
Looking yonder at what's ahead
Hiding the dark thoughts in the haze of your mind
Following guides and signs
Utilizing the different charts
Studying the sciences
Desiring to master the arts
