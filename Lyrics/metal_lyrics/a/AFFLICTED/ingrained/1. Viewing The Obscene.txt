Blood spilled laces the ground
Congregation to the demise
Not to help, just to see
Subconscious lust attract the flies

Tragic visions fill their eyes
As the soul slowly dies
Dark attraction, glimpsing interest
What you enjoy - you detest

What's forbidden to see
Interests me
Still it's frightening
To stare at the injuries
The blood on the ground
Beholders surround
Thier absorbing eyes
And the victims helpless cries...

What scares us, we wish to see
Nauseating visions of anatomy

The darkside of reality
Is the blood of the casualty

"The sight of the obscene
Visualized on the silver screen
Beheaviour primitive
Fascination of the repulsive
Wreck of human being
Stiffening meat they're seeing
Lingering, stopping, staring
Views of death are scaring"

What's forbidden to see
Interests me
Still it's fightening
To stare at the injuries
The blood on the gorund
Beholders surround
Their absorbing eyes
And the victims helpless cries...

The fear to step in a prevent
A persons death
You would rather let him die
Than waste your time and save his life...
