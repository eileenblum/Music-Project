Realized the meaning of the empy word humanity
Affected with the sights of our insane reality

Build up your aggression
Reliase your frustration
Despite the ingorance
Of our passive lives...

You keep on complaining
With an aggresive verbal rage
Reform your mentality
React with more than words
You know what they have done
Deeds beyond all measures
Thier insanity increases
I realize that: LIFE IS EXTREME

Days pass by
Before your T.V. eyes
Your ingnorance
Leaves me just frustration

Daily visions fill their eyes
Where reality inereases to the extreme
The world begins to boil over
Awating just to... cease to be

Our heritage, an unfertile world
Diseased by greed and passivity
The major threat is yourself
Your senseless mind and lack of consciousness...

Daily visions fill their eyes
Where reality inereases to the extreme
The world begins to boil over
Awating just to... cease to be

I have realized the meaning
Of the empty word humanity
I've been affected with the insight
Of an even worse reality...

Our heritage
Is an unfertile world
Diseased by greed
And passivity
The major threat
Is really yourself
Your senseless mind
And lack of consciousness...
