I'm the one to be there
I'm the one who doesn't care
I'm what you've feared all the time
I am the end
I'm the eyes in the night
i hide from the burning light
I'm what you've feared all the time
I am vengeance

I rage for revenge...

I explose in your face
I avenge my murdered race
I release my anger now
I am the end
I've ridden across the forzen plains
And the eternal sand wastes
Wherever you journey, so do I
For I am vengeance

I rage for revenge...

I fly like the eagle
I run like a wolf
I hide out of sight
Until it is time
When the stars grow pale
And the sun slowly rises
I will not fall
I leave my disguise

I rage and run beserk
Your bodies fall to earth

I rage for revenge

In blood and ashes I stand
In your ravaged camp
My sacred promises now fulfilled
I became your end
And as the day grows warm
I mount my steed and leave
The taste of victory in my mouth
I am vengeance...

I rage for revenge!
