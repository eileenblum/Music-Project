Ignorance, intolerance
The fuel to your hate
A lie repeated is believed
And minds so weak will follow
Sickening mass ecstasy
Minds, empty and hollow
You've built yourself a throne too high
Cross my heart and you will die

A darkended epoch of the past
Its hate recycled and reporn
It grows in strength, it's growing fast
And now it must be torn
The thought of you, a taste so sour
Your mind is fucked by lies
Your head is swimming form the power
Cross my heart and you will die

Cross my heart, you will die
Cross my heart, you will die
Cross my heart, you will die
Cross my heart, you will die

Cross my heart, you will die
Cross my heart, you will die
Cross my heart, you will die
Cross my heart, you will die

Mind-fucked beyond recognition
Blinded by hate, a blurred vision

Hybris man who aren't on high
Self-proclaimed divinity
Hubris man, you live a lie
Cross my heart and you will die
Hybris man who aren't on high
You'll end in dark infinity
Hybris man, you live a lie
Cross my heart and you will die

Cross my heart, you will die
Cross my heart, you will die
Cross my heart, you will die
Cross my heart, you will die
