The catch will end the chase
Show the way out of this maze
The catch will end this phase
Lead to be a better place
The catch will end the chase
To fall from grace
Repeating words I praise
Upon your picture I gaze

Rid me of this guilt
Help tear down these walls that I've built
Once again, change my ways
Gone from evil day

The catch will end the chase
To fall from grace
Repeating words I praise
Upon your picture I gaze

Rid me of this guilt
Help tear down these walls that I've built
Once again, change my ways
Gone from evil day

In my last reincarnation
Form the ancient to reformation
Same of soul, body left behind
New appearance of another kind
New form, new shape, new size
Out of this ashes I will rise
Memories, they will always last
In the records, karma of my past

The catch will end the chase
Show the way out of this maze
The catch will end this phase
Lead to be a better place
The catch will end the chase
To fall from grace
Repeating words I praise
Upon your picture I gaze

Rid me of this guilt
Help tear down these walls that I've built
Once again, change my ways
Gone from evil day

Here I am to suffer once again
Leading a life, never ending strain
Gone from Sodom, now I'm coming through
And Gomorrah, been there too
End it all, no way won't do
Way of life, will have to renew
Only way to stay clean
Right rack, strike the olden mean
