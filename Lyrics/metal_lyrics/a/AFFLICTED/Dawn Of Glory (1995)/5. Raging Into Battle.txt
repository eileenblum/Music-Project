Few in number but strong in heart
We may not live to see the night
But have not fear, into battle we ride
The moon is gone, the day now dawns
We crush the stillness and charge through the woods
The day of the battle is born

Horses scream, arrows fly
Crows circle the sky
We clash with our enemies onto the field
We're not afraid to die
Fallen men litter the ground
More fall, onto the mounds
So if we fall, we will be reborn
We can never die

We drive on our horses with madness and fury
Defending our land with sword and bow
The heat of the battle, melting the snow
Now we fall, line by line
But we charge onward, a bloody tide
There is no fear, into battle we ride

Horses scream, arrows fly
Crows circle the sky
We clash with our enemies onto the field
We're not afraid to die
Fallen men litter the ground
More fall, onto the mounds
So if we fall, we will be reborn
We can never die

Horses scream, arrows fly
Crows circle the sky
We clash with our enemies onto the field
We're not afraid to die
Fallen men litter the ground
More fall, onto the mounds
So if we fall, we will be reborn
We can never die!
