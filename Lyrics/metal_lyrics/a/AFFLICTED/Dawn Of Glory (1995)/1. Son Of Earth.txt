Hard and furious
With death defying grace
I ride the universe
And rage through time and space
My chariot rips the air
Like an arrow in flight
Thunder roar and lightning glare
As the skyline is set alight

I ride the winds of glory
My heroic deeds are untold
I am the son of Mother Earth
In my chariot of gold

Thunderbolts I scatter
As I plunge into my fate
Bucks black in front of me
Breathing brimstone, fire and hate
But now I am forsaken
Tell me how could this be
Lightning walks with thunder
And thunder walks with me

I ride the winds of glory
My heroic deeds are untold
I am the son of Mother Earth
In my chariot of gold

I am the thunderer
I penetrate the northern night
I rule the seasons four
With overwhelming might

I will kill!!!
