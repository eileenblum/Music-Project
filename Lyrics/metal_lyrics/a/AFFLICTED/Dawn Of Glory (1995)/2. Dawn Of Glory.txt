Morning light beams
Reflections in sword and shield
For the ones who are born of leather
And the ones who are forged in steel

Marching under blood red skies
All of us too young to die
In our wake scavengers fly
Drawn by our battle cry

Fallen heroes on the field
Killed in battle orgy
All reborn in the sky
Dawn of glory

Arrows thirty pierce my side
Nailed into the ground
Now let death be my bride
For Valhalla I am bound
Valkyries descend from the clouds
Severing our earthly ties
Carry us to kingdom come
Left behind, my body lies

Fallen heroes on the field
Killed in battle orgy
All reborn in the sky
Dawn of glory

I am searching through
the highland of my past
The riddle of steel
will be mine at last

Ride the winds of thunder
Through the worlds of nine
Borne through crystal air
Onto the plain of the divine
Today we lost our battle
Yet we won a greater victory
Region of the gods
Dawn of glory

Fallen heroes on the field
Killed in battle orgy
All reborn in the sky
Dawn of glory

Fallen heroes on the field
Killed in battle orgy
All reborn in the sky
Dawn of glory
