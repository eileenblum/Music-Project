Blinded by the light that I can't see
claimed to rescue me
deafening the sounds I cannot hear
for some obvious speeches-for others not as clear
not as clear

Serpent I am of thee... prodigal son
striving to win that which... cannot be won
seeking a faith in which I... can believe
scrutinizing the messages I receive

Won't you make me see (come alive)
come awaken me (come alive)
won't you make me be (come alive)
to it instantly

Won't you make me see (come alive)
arouse me (come alive)
show me on my way (come alive)
to it and seize the day]
