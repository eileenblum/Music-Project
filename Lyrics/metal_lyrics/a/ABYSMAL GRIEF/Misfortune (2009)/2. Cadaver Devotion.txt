Lost among a thousand of grey solemn tombs
find shelter through the field of corpses now exhumed
Smell the earth, witness of this slow return to life
Our existence ruins down into these graves

Cadaver Devotion

Failure through damnation
Grimness breaths that make them crawl
Celebrate this great tragedy
By evoking desperate souls
Walk the way without lights
Mourning clothes for the Quest
Touch the corpse, feel its charm
Prepare the rite...

Cadaver Devotion
