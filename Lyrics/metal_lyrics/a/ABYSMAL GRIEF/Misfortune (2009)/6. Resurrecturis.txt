The cold embrace of Death
Reveals us the Gate
We're entering the Reign of Gloom
Through the violet veil
But the ones who still lie dead
Know the way to come back
They're waiting for the black moon night
In their charming graves

The closing sound of the grim bell's toll
Scans the gait of the funeral march
They proceed slowly towards us
With outstretched cold arms
Our existence can turn at last
To an eternal All Soul's Day
Whispering they'll return to life
While our goal in life is Death!
