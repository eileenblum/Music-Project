ItÂ´s the night with no moonAnd I am lostThis wood is shrouded in mistColdÂ´s breaking my bonesBut what is happening?Faint lights coming over thereIt is the noise of the hoofsSomeone is coming... Hearse, a hearse is now arrivingHearse, a violet-draped black hearse Nobody is drivingThe horse seems knowing the streetI think IÂ´m going crazyI canÂ´t believe my eyesAnd the hearse is ladenA coffin lies insideBlack cats are its trainI follow them apart Hearse, a hearse is now arrivingHearse, a violet-draped black hearse I am terrorized by this silent feretroA funeral is sign of death!
