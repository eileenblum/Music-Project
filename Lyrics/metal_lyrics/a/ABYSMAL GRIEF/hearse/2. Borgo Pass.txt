The snow now is falling slow
Grim howlings resounding nearer
Black clouds passed across the moon face
So that weÂ´re again in the dark
The dark brings us a frightful stare
In black and the crucifix is still around my neck...

Towards the borgo pass
Towards the borgo pass

In carpathian light
The coach proceeds among the trees
As it sank in the darkness
Lonely feeling all over me
Hear the howlings
Closing me from every side
The children of the night
Grim presage of evil rising

Towards the borgo pass
Towards the borgo pass

"Denn die Toten reiten schnell..."

[Translation from German:]
"Because the dead are riding fast..."
