The time has come
Some shapes loom up in the Darkness
The graveyard rises again...
The dirges of the wolves resound so sinister
A mystic fog awakes the Dead
The stillness of the tombstones
Is broken by a breath
The night of the resurrected Dead

Oh no, no, don't try to escape your ruthless Fate
They are the obscure silent grim
Creatures from the Grave

I hear They're coming to get you
Blind eyes that point at you!
They're rising to get you
Look out, 'cause They'll come very soon...

The moon is quickly faded
The earth now smells of Death
The tombstones move, grim creatures live again...

I hear They're coming to get you
Blind eyes that point at you!
They're rising to get you
Look out, 'cause They'll come very soon...

Oh no, no, don't try to escape your ruthless Fate
They are the obscure silent grim
Creatures from the Grave
