Grey fumes of blood fill up this wooden dark
In static rest eternal life

Mortuary silence of a resurrecting world
Faint languid eyes that look at us

Hallucinating stares that gaze at you
Hypnotic words of pain of a tuneless renew

Requies Aeterna
Requies Aeterna

Wreaths and dirges, eternal drowsiness
A cadaverical symbiosis with gloom

The praying knell will rise high from the church
They'll send us flowers from their graves

Requies Aeterna
Requies Aeterna
