When the moon gets a silvery violet light
We use to meet in this old abandoned house
Among cold ancient walls and baroque drapes
To establish link between Life and Death

We proclaim the presence of a spirit light
In relation with the living before us
Their words are subject for the study on life
Consider the Funeral as a new birth rite

A new birth rite...The Necromass
