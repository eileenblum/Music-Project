Wrapped in my sudarium
I'm waitin' for the unburial rite
Praying for Those who observe us
From the Silent Place

I adore the Mother Death
I evoke the Great Misfortune
Rain and tombs and faded flowers
Delight for my eyes

Cultus Lugubris

I hear voices from the corpes
Their grim breathe is callin' me
All around hear the sound of Darkness
An invisible veil...
Cultus Lugubris

They await in silence
They await in silence
I can feel their silent stare
