ItÂ´s still night in the graveyardIn the vault something strange nowWickness, DarknessEverything is in the breeze of DeathNow burning candles circleUndead body, his return for us... Evil, MadnessFeelings of the UndeadSepulchre of MisfortuneDancing bats in the vault Mystic vision of occult forcesItÂ´s the time for revengeAll the past lies far away fromThe present Darkness and possessionDark...NecromancerDark...Awake Evil, MadnessFeelings of the UndeadSepulchre of MisfortuneDancing bats in the vaultIn the vault of bad luck
