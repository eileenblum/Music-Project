"Midnight has come and we are all here in front of the chosen tomb,for giving new life to the dead body of this damned aoul.The magician is receiling the prayers for the deceased, wearingclothes stolen from the graves and sorrounded by the breeze of Misfortune.Unile we drink the GoatÂ´s hot blood and four black raths have been impaledaround the magic circle of evocation, as an evil sign of protection.Hemlock and Mandrake are burning while the coffin is brought to lightand carried into the crypt for the necromantical ritual. ItÂ´s beginning toknell and nobody saw us venturing in this garden of Death..." Lying inside the grave this nightAnother victim is preparing his soul unawarefor the burial riteSome hooded men are carrying the open coffinTo the resting place where he will await Exsequita occultaExsequita occulta They are magicians in NecromancyThey are preparing a corpse for the knowledge ritesUnscarred by the hazard of the evil streamsNow will start for them the preparation seance Exsequita occultaExsequita occulta "Ex Sancta Resurrectione et supplicii impiorum nomine, tivi praecipioSpirite Defuncti ut respondas quod rogo. Obtempera istae sarraecerimoniae si spes habes in Salvatione, et surge in nomine Christi" Now all is finished inside the cryptEntombed in the dark, left aloneAn unpractised cremation is a bad presageNow the worms will come into the grave Exsequita occultaExsequita occulta
