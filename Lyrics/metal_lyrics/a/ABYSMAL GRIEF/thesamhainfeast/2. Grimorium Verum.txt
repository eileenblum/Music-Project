Use the ancient black book to evoke supernatural entitiesSacre your soul to four high elemental spiritsThe three powers that reign on the Magic Circle you had erectedControl the Constellation of Saturnalia Dies Mies JeschetBoenedoesefDouvema Enitemaus In the mirror you can see all your secret desiresAnd your hand must be steady in front of Evil's liegesYuor earhy fears disappear at the come of the Black Archangels Dies Mies JeschetBoenedoesefDouvema Enitemaus For the Book of SingambuthGrimorium VerumWith the steals of WarsI'll receive rebirth
