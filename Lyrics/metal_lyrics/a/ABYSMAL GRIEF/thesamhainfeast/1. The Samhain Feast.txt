This night the light of the fire will reach the skyThe roven is devoted to Witchcraft and Consecration to the christ DenierNovember is the month of those who diedDirges echoes resound in the skyThe rite is about to begin nowThe Goat's among His queens of Samhain Meeting of Mitches, SamhainPraying the DevilHell in the sky, the spirits arrive! He'll rise, He'll rise out from the fireThe Goat and His brides at His feet seem so insaneThe moon now is obscured by evilStorm clouds of wrathThis is again the night of black massesI fill the cup with my blood Meeting of Witches, SamhainPraying the DevilHell in th sky, the spirits arrive!
