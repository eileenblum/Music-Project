Loaded
Exploded
Drone
Far gone

A groke obscure
Forevermore
A vortex
Black hole

A ghost ship glide with the city tide
Twisted drifting shell
With strung out sail I leave no trail
Live to fail

Out of luck
I don't give a fuck
Beam me up or suck my cock

I can't remember the downfall
King turning slave first foot in the grave
White faces round me whisper again
This is permanent
Permanent

I fed desire a mind burning fire
Now nothing can put it to rest
Storm seeking on the dead die alone
All my connections
Blown
