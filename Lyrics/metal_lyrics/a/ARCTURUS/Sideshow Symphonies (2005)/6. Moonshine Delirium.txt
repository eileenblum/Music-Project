Third night in flight
My body says no but my mind says go
Moonshine delirium what is that lurking behind the curtain
There at an instant then gone with a flash
Defeating all resistance something there I can not grasp
There is no tomorrow gone beyond sorrow under a sheltering mask
Hail to you thousand faced all trapped in the haze
Dandies bandits tramps and champs
Beloved freaks and cheeky sneaks
Homeless heroes without dineros
Vampire-fools and exotic ghouls
Mongoshitfacedtabletwisters salut!
And open chure
