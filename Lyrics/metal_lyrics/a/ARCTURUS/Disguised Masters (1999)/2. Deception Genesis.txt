Unfortunate the hoax
that you are not immune
For if beauty was hurt
Like children naked and misused
We would aspire towards
States of disturbed emotions
And never need to mirror off
Like shadows of a greater joy
While moralist angels repare
Their heavenly cocktail lounge

In darker institutions
They are beyond discipline
And repentance is no option

But do not despair
I know of an exit
Destruction thinkers travel
The other way around
Where directions are none
And the ground is gone
Such treacherous gates to enter
Even bigger doubts inside
Doors shut from the outsid
And you hear the sound
Of someone walking away

You just disappeared
In a backsweep
Of darkness and stars
