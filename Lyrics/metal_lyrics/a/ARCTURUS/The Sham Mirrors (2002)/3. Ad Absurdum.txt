This dead orchestra
Play on instruments
Strung with the fibres
Of my mind

And skeletons dance
They have no voice
And no complaint

But I am still flesh
And will not serve
You vampire fools
Bringing you life
By invoking dead

I'm tired of telling stories
With this ghostvoice of mine
So you can say you don't
Believe in ghosts

You drink me animal
Wasted on my madness
Leaving me blank and empty

But tonight
I'm Houdini
Gonna kill my shadow
Penetrate your sanctum

See your loss
Through your eyes
And laugh as two
You not knowing why
And wanting to die
