"Welcome
This transmission
From a fallen star
Otherwise known as Arcturus"

Light has departed
From this black sun
But please put us on
To bring darkness down
From your head and home

Our enterprise a success
As return is no option
Our eyes were removed
For our own safety

The distance too great
For you to hear our cries
Never mind take this lamp
We are also beyond light

We learned so little
Of inhuman culture
Before disappearance
Went right through us

The mother ship
Boarded by fools
We escape space
In order to reach
Our destination

And if you are listening
Please tell us about the time
Where and when we exist
No more

For when you go
We go with you
Via wormholes
