O evil spirits of the beast, roaming over this snowy field.
L'EML K'AML H'AML
O evil spirits of the beast, roaming over this snowy field.

He shall soon lose his human tounge,
just like the most primitive ones.
With his bones crushed,
and by spending his final energy,
he shall hang himself.
In this land covered with ice
and darkness, the death is his fate.
He and all his blood relation
shall be finally exterminated.

L'EML K'AML H'AML
L'EML K'AML H'AML
O spirits of the freezing curse,
extend to the end of his death.

L'EML K'AML H'AML
O evil spirits of the beast, roaming over this snowy field.
L'EML K'AML H'AML
O spirits of the freezing curse, extend to the end of his death.

You put the bones of the revengeful beasts,
into the shape of him.
Deeply on the doll of him, you engrave his name.

You tie the neck up thirteen times,
with his own hairr.
On the blazing hellfire,
the winding corpse of a snake leads him to ruin.

O evil spirits of the beast,
roaming over this snowy field.
O spirits of the freezing curse,
extend to the end of his death.

You throw the head down
into the blazing hellfire.
You grind the beheaded body
and you burn them all into ashes.

At dusk, the ashes of the revengeful curse
of the beasts fall on his mansion
within the freezing snowstorm.
He is the buried dead
under the eternal blizzard
summoned for your endless infernal vengeance.
