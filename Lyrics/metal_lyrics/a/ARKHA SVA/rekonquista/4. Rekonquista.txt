ROMUS THARIS ORDA ANNOS BALSA PHAMUS OBES BETHES ATHES ...
Engrave this crest, behind your eyelids.
You all are blessed by the grand spirit.
No need to fear ...
Soon, they all shall be exterminated from here.

With the ancient arts that only the chosen may practice,
eradicate him and his people from this land.

HORUS ORDA REDON ILLUS UTHES PHALES PHOYS ORDA HAPUS ...

Remember all his face, and features.
You all are blessed by the grand spirit.
Look at the six piles of divine punishments,
driven in his eyes, nipples and waist.

Wrest the noses away.
Drink the spinal fruid.
Lay the limbs exposed.
And devour the viscera of all his people.

(MANUS MITHOS DIAS PATHOS SENUS ORDA...)

Eighty-one repetitions of the prayer incarnates you immortal.

No place for his blood and relation...
Arrest them all.
Scoop their skulls out.
Crush their backbones.
And hang all their bodies inverted.

ROMUS THARIS ORDA ANNOS BALSA PHAMUS OBES BETHES
ATHES HORUS ORDA REDON ILLUS UTHES PHALES PHOYS ORDA HAPUS
MANUS MITHOS DIAS PATHOS SENUS ORDA.

You are the chosen ones by Romus' spirit.
This crest of Romus deifies your triumphant return.
