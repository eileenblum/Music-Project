O CORAXO DAS ZODIRADALE RAASYO.
OD VABEZODIRE CAMELIASA OD BAHALA.
He's for sure to come to your grave,
driven by his excruciating fear and nightmare,
in order to get your death assured.

NIISO! SALAMANU TELOCAHE.
You are the Eternal---ride on the nightwind, and wring his physical blood.

The soil of your graveyard sprays his dwellings.
The ivy coiling around your tomb takes root in his site.
His body, in that the same blood as yours streams, begins to rot down,
instead of your dead corpse.

Your corpse, physically dead, desires his blood.
Your absence is just his plot to steal all your rights and inheritance.
The soil of your graveyard storms in his territory.
The ivy coiling around your tomb strangles his mansion.

NIISA! BAGILE ABERAMEJI NONUCAPE.
Five lightnings in the east, with his deadly screams, are the requiem on your grave.

CASAREMANU HOEL-QO, OD TI TA ZOD CAHISA SOBA COREMEFA I GA.
His frightened mind, under your invisible shadow,
descends his future to where no salvation is given.

Your corpse shall soon overcome the physical life and death,
by drinking the same blood as yours up from his body.
You accomplish your own return.
His remains are dissolved rotting in the soil of your graveyard.
His spirit is strangled with the ivy from your tomb.

NIISO! SALAMANU TELOCAHE.
You are the Eternal---ride on the nightwind, and wander for more blood.

All those who've had any relations with him are exterminated.
You are the predator--the undead god of this world.

NIISA! BAGILE ABERAMEJI NONUCAPE.
Five lightnings in the east, with the victims' deadly screams,
are the requiem on their graveth.
