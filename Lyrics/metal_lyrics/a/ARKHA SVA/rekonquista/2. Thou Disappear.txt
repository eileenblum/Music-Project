TE E LO O KE E HAA AA BA A II MAA LE E PEE LE E GEE.
Without nocturnal quietude, nor slumber, you flow within a daydream-like dimension.
You victimize anything for your hatred.
Your impulse to destroy and erase him...

To destroy him, you stand above mortality.
You've got the immortal spirit.
He's beaten in the agony, thousands more times than you.

Nusiate name of him, engraved on a black candle, abominable as his existence...
Yet then you carve "him" into millions, without such a shape, into shapeless invisibility.

TE E LO O KE E HAA AA BA A II MAA LE E PEE LE E GEE.
Thus you watch him down, ground into rot.
Thus you watch him down, melting down in nothingness.

Thus you watch him down, ground into rot.
Thus you watch him down, melting down in nothingness.

TE E LO O KE E HAA AA BA A II MAA LE E PEE LE E GEE.
Three needles, spears, blessed in your hatred, arrest all his spirit, soul, and corpse.
No light's in your blackened chamber underground, except for the dying light of his soul.

(Be eroded and decaying in the total darkness)

TE E LO O KE E HAA AA BA A II MAA LE E PEE LE E GEE.
Thus you watch him down, ground into rot.
Thus you watch him down, melting down in nothingness.

Thus you watch him down, ground into rot.
Thus you watch him down, melting down in nothingness.
