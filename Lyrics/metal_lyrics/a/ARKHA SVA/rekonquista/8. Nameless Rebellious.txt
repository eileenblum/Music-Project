ILASA MICALAZODA OLAPIRETA IALPEREJI BELIORE DAS ODO BUSADIRE O' IAD, O' IAD OUOARESA CAOSAGO.
No strength to die...
Your past has been series of loss.
Yet you' d courage to sell your soul, though that might be a shame.
Though that might be a fatal shame...

O du machtiges Licht und brennende Flamme des Trostes.
Die du den Ruhm SATANS , SATANS dem Mittelpunkt der Erde enthullst.

No freedom given, even to remain among the mass...
Original sin, and expectation of unreason at excess...
You slaughtered them all.

(CASAREMEJI LAIADA ERANU BERINUTASA CAFAFAME)
DAS IVEMEDA AQOSO ADOHO MOZ, OD MAOF-FASA.

Portraits in fire, contorted faces, and wretched limbs...
Throw your memories down in ashes.
The end is just the beginning.
Now, the fallen one, rise from the ashes.
The fallen one, rise from "......" .

Torments on you were all their innocent eyes.
So you dared to choose the " shame" , rather than that hell of unreason.
Now you dwell in the darkness.
You gaze into the black sky, sitting in your vacant grave.
Thus become the nameless rebellious.

(The mirror of the sky reflects you.
There you find the essence "......")
In this labyrinth of perversion, you now see even a light.
The truth, you met because of your fall ...
The truth, you' d never reached, never in the past, never in that blinding daylight ...

Portraits in fire, contorted faces, and wretched limbs...
Throw your memories down in ashes.
You begin with this end.
Now, the nameless daemon, rise from nothingness.
The nameless daemon, rise from hell.

(In dem grosen Geheimnisse der Wahrheit bestandig sind die du in deinem Konigreich)
"Starke durch Freude."
Genannt wirst und unermeslich bist.

You are the fallen.
You are the chosen.
You are the daemon.
You worship Satan.

(Sei du mir ein Fenster des Trostes. BOLAPE COMO BELIORETA PAMEBETA)
