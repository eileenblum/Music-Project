Darkness, darkly yet transparent.
Darkness so clean, able to be seen through all.
Why are they afraid of such darkness?
In the Darkness, they can clearly see the figure of their masters.
Light, white and muddy.
Light so unclean, to paint all white over.
Why aren't they afraid of such light?
In the Light, they can clearly see nothing of their predators.
Casting Down Dark Heavens.
Time flows from the future to the past.
What was the future once, comes to present and will become the past.
You among distortion.
Voices to undermine you who cannot be dead.
What colours are they?
And what taste do they have?
