NOSTIKR FELCA DUPÃM
O thy denial of death.
Death, a state without future.
You deny to live without future.
And at the same moment, you are enslaved by the future:
Chained by time in order not to smell death.
And at the same moment, you use the illusion named time,
in order to flee from the illusion named death.
You know it very well, that by dying before death, one never dies.
And that the closest to the God is the one completely dead.
NOSTIKR FELCA DUPÃM.
You have neither birth, nor death.
NOSTIKR FELCA DUPÃM.
You have neither creation, nor destruction.
NOSTIKR FELCA DUPÃM.
You have neither fate, nor free will.
NOSTIKR FELCA DUPÃM.
You have neither way, nor achievement.
Nothing else than them are the ultimate truth.
Nothing else than them are the ultimate truth.
