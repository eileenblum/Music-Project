Dark Day,
You have desperately anticipated the day.
O, AGIOS O APEP.
Your words of curse that you kept throwing
to the direction of his mansion in every sunset.

AGIOS O APEP.
Now in this graveyard,
what you longed for finally comes true.

âO, Apep the evil spirit,
come to this world and cast curse on him.â

In the sunset, at the midnight,
and in the dawn of this Dark Day,
The scream of your soul echoes three times over this land of the dead.

âThrust his head, cut and tear his face
then cut again his skull in two.â

Pieces of the nails, Bundle of the hair
and the semen of the humans...

In the center of the magic circle,
a black altar tempts him for seven days.

âIn order to crush his body,
pulverize all his bones,
and cut off all his limbs.â

A doll shaped like him,
made of wax of the corpse of humans,
is limitlessly pierced with your solid stone spear.

âStab the heart of the cursed
With the power of the evil spirit Apep,
at the night of the Dark Day,
arrest him and destroy him!â

Now your prayer serves.
Head, face, limbs, and heartâ¦
In this order, you slowly stab them again and again.

In this way you destroy all his hope, present and future existence.

âO, Apep the evil spirit,
come to this world and cast curse on him.
Thrust his head, cut and tear his face,
Then cut again his skull in two.
In order to crush his body,
pulverize all his bones,
and cut off all his limbs.
Stab the heart of the cursed.
With the evil spirit Apep,
at the night of this Dark Day,
arrest him and destroy him!â

Your prayer doesnât end until you look over his miserable corpse.

His decayed corpse just like the melted wax of the doll...
So that he can never come back here again,

O, AGIOS O APEP,
you continue your prayer and cast curse on him from the magic circle.

O, AGIOS O APEP,
You continue your prayer until you look over his miserable corpse.

O, AGIOS O APEP,
You continue your prayer and cast curse on him from this blessed graveyard.
