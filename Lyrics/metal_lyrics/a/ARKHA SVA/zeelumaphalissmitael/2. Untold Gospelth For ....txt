You dismiss any worldly thoughts.
You now stand as a purely sinful lust.
NEZ IAZ ZTER NYT HIAR HAYS OOT HOPP NYR.

You are the active providence of Satan lord.
You were born to ascend the apex of this world.
NEZ IAZ ZTER NYT HIAR HAYS OOT HOPP NYR.

Engrave your incantation and enemy's name on the octah
Then a sprig of a dead tree from that glen deprives
him of all his limbs, and stabs piercing his future
to his own, enternal death.

RAAKH VIVANDA PHALITHA DEOSH KAALA SYAHRAH MANNUSHA.
RAAKH VIVANDA PHALITHA DEOSH KAALA SYAHRAH MANNUSHA.

O Satan lord, cast obstacle to the rival competing
with you close in upon.
NEZ IAZ ZTER NYT HIAR HAYS OOT HOPP NYR.

Thus you just begin from here.
All his might and influence are withering pathetically
in somewhere unknown.

Thus you just begin from here, O thou inverse divine.
Now you are the ruler of this cursed kingdom.

RAAKH VIVANDA PHALITHA DEOSH KAALA SYAHRAH MANNUSHA.
RAAKH VIVANDA PHALITHA DEOSH KAALA SYAHRAH MANNUSHA.

Time is come to manifest your providence,
might, his loss, your domination, 
and the proxy of malice.

The hypocrites start killing one another.
Hunt the preachers and all their relations.
Expose all their heads piled up to the sky.

Again you dismiss all the worldly thoughts,
and become the undefiled wisdom.
The false messiah is torn into shreds,
burnt down and forgotten somewhere ending.

Thus you just begin from here,
Broken are the might of the false messiah
and the balance of unreason.
And now the world begins searching how to be.

O Satan lord, provide death to the false prophet.
Now the world begins searching how to be.
