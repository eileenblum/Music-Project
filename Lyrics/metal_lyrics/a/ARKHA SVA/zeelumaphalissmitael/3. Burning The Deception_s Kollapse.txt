ZEELUM APHALIS SMITAEL.
O spirits dwelling within these thorny pine leaves.
ZEELUM APHALIS SMITAEL.
O disaster on those deceptive lambs.

At midnight you cover the floor of the
deceptive's stronghold with salt.

You set fire on its pillars and walls.
Burn them all into ashes with these thorny pine leaves.

An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.
The rancorous grudge of your blood relatives is what
only the pitiful death of those deceptive can compensate.

ZEELUM APHALIS SMITAEL.
O spirits dwelling within these thorny pine leaves.
ZEELUM APHALIS SMITAEL.
O disaster on those deceptive lambs.

Pray strong and tough.
Your earnest will shall at last come true
after the years.

You bind the thirteen pieces of these leaves
up with your own hairs.
And dace ...

The salt is to purify their pollution
Their un-cleanliness will be dried up and disappear.

The ancient shamans bless your prayer.

Burn it down, burn it down!
The swarm of maggots altogether with their nest church.

Burn it down, burn it down!
The swarm of maggots altogether with their nest church.

ZEELUM APHALIS SMITAEL.
O spirits dwelling within these thorny pine leaves.

ZEELUM APHALIS SMITAEL.
O disaster on those deceptive lambs.

Hellfire to their collapse.
Wring all their blood out, that smells like a rotten fish.

Bury them all in a filthy swamp, and burn them all again.

Burn them all again and again, the swarm of maggots altogether with their nest church.

ZEELUM APHALIS SMITAEL.
O spirits dwelling within these thorny pine leaves.
ZEELUM APHALIS SMITAEL.
O disaster on those deceptive lambs.

ZEELUM APHALIS SMITAEL.
O spirits dwelling within these thorny pine leaves.
ZEELUM APHALIS SMITAEL.
All their existence will be dried up and disappear.

ZEELUM APHALIS SMITAEL.
O spirits dwelling within these thorny pine leaves.
ZEELUM APHALIS SMITAEL.
All their existence will be dried up and disappear.
