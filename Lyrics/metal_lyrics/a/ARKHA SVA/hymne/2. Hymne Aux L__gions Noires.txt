HABIATAV, HABIATAV.
HABIATAV, HABIATAV.

The legend was just the prologue
HABIATAV.
Thou, kneel down to "it" in awe.
The blackest legions of darkness returns...

The black flame of Hell covers and blackenes the sky.
Only the choses awake, reign, oppress and enslave the mass.

...in triumphe from Hell...

HABIATAV, HABIATAV.
The bloodthirsty undeads come to spill the life of the enslaved.

Infernal epidemic clearifies over this world.
At the night, when the sun sets down and places himself at the imum coeli,
they wretch the gats of Hell opened.

Cleargymen fall under the venomous rain.
Immitators notice their overreaching vanity.
And they all kneel down in asking...
And they all kneel down in asking...

...salvation...

The legend was just the prologue
HABIATAV.
Thou, kneel down to "it" in awe.
The immortal legions of the night returns...

The legend was just the prologue
HABIATAV.
Thou, kneel down to "it" in awe.
The blackest legions of darkness returns...

...in triumphe from Hell!
