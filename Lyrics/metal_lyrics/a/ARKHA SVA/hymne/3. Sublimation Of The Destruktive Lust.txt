O Glory to SATOR.

From the top-left, to the right and below,
From the lower-right, to the left and above,

Your seven repetitions of murderous intent gnaw at his mind and corpse.

O Glory to SATOR.

In this square, upon the name of the undefiled, SATOR,

From the top-left, to the right in repetition,

The unbaptized Latin in your bosom destroys him into nothingness.

O Curse to the Hated.
In this square, upon the name of the undefiled SATOR,
his abominable name crawls without space.

The first day, he' ll find his foot unwalkable.
The Second day, he' ll notice his eyes losing sight.
The third day, he' ll notice his tongue loosing words.

O Glory to SATOR.

Under your cold glance, he collapses down in losing human shape.

O Glory to SATOR.
The unbaptized latin buened in wind,
and its ashes destroy and drag him into chaos,
gradually within the seven days...
O Glory to SATOR.
