from above by being caught in your rope,

Eternal is her slavery to you
Every night you desecrate, rape and discard
you desecrate, rape and discard
this miserable yet beautiful doll of flesh

Eternal is their slavery to you
Every night you desecrate, rape and discard,
you desecrate, rape and discard
these miserable yet beautiful dolls of flesh
