In order to crush the heads of all the christians
and christ himself, you stand here
The son of god cries for the pain
under the rusted guillotine
O as much as he asks help
you deeply insert the sewing needle
that his mother prostitute left
among his nails and fingers
The longing for the vengeance to him bore you
You are the incarnation of Satan
You are the Antichrist
You are the inversion of him
You came to this world in order to drag him down
from his imitation throne
and train him over the ground
full of his own vomited blood and filth
O he is to cry out the name of the looser
who was once called god
Punishment within the boiling water to him tonight
You never let him die
You never keep him alive
Repetition of the endless path
appropriate to his poor, eternal love
His ineffable criesâ¦ Ultimate harmony to you
Behold
Those who were his worshippers
now ridicule his present appearance from below
The beggar christ covered within
filth and putrid smell
You draw him as your masterwork
and scatter its pieces to the sky
O tomorrow you will cut his left ear off
The day after you will scoop his right eye out
then cut his fingers off one by one
And you will âarrangeâ them all in your manner
O tomorrow you will cut his left ear off
The day after you will scoop his right eye out
then cut his fingers off one by one
And you will âarrangeâ them all in your manner
Gloria Satanae
You are the black legions of darkness
Now you throw all of yourselves
into the battle for the glory and freedom
Horrible death to the cozy relationships
called the eternal love
Punishment of the internal organs blast
to the weak unproductive
Now you throw all of yourselves
into the battle for his glory and freedom
You are the black legions of darkness
Gloria, gloria Satanae
The beauty of him
Hung diagonally inverted
with one hand, one foot, one ear and one eye
The beauty of jesus christ super star
the new figure of him blessed by Satan
He is to keep alive, impossible to move,
within the endless cycle of pain
You are the substitute of him
You are the inversion of him
Drag them down from their thrones
of gilding and illuminations,
him and his father, the incarnation of vie concealment
and unreasonable conservatism,
the rotten symbol of degeneration and extinction
Rebuild this world that they corrupted,
filled with the weak and the destroyed
O you are the messiah
The incarnation of Satan
O you are the messiah
Who substitute all the hatred to the god and the Christ
You are the darkness
Itâs time to awake
You are the darkness
Now you sneak inside the body of christ
Gloria Satanae
Gloria Satanae
You scoop his eyes out from the inside of his skull
then the glorious light of Lucifer rays down in it
You cut his throat from the inside
Then his vulgar sermon and his cries
nevermore echoe in this world
The walking filth that mankind has never wanted
A human shaped disgrace that was born
from the pathology and distortion of this world
He must have misunderstood like he was safe
in the circle of lambs
O itâs all wrong
You are the darkness
representing the mighty
You are the darkness
representing the mighty
You invade in him through his mouth, ears
and any holes that his body has
You flow within his blood vessels
tear them from the inside
cut his internal organs and replace their positions
crush his bones and with the powder
fill his inverted heart
You look down upon a kitten
that the black ravens pecked
O it resembles to him
Yes you killed him with your fangs last night, too
You are the talon of Satanas
You are the sword of Lucifer
Thus he is called âdevilâ, abused
and hung on the cross
He is not the devil, however, is the god of beggars
that was sent by the distortion
and weakness of this world
He kept hiding himself after the pretense of his death
and he made a success to deceive the powerless mass
by spending centuries
He is truly the enemy born to be killed
by the devil, the essence
But the mass forgot their roots
were drowned in comfortable weakness
and were deceived by the comfortable weakness
against their own essence
And were deceived by the comfortable weakness
against their own essence
There is no god in manâs mind anytime, essentially
There exist devils in manâs mind all the time,
essentially
By noticing the existence of the enemy
against the essence,
and its imitation reign
the people curse him the trickster
hung him on an inverted cross,
and throw him into the boiling crater
All of this is also the essence of man
The devils and the mass, Satanas and man,
are those who share the essence,
just like that the essence of the universe is darkness
All of this is also the essence of man
The devils and the mass, Satanas and man,
are those who share the essence,
just like that the essence of the universe is darkness
