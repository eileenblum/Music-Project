I can try to be more polite, but that won't stop the karma.
This. The behaviour of silence, it's gone.
Even if I try to change, everything remains the same
Even if I keep living, I'll be alone
I can't decide, who is the one
I can't decide, who is the one
That I chosed to be
Then I meet you, then I love you
Eyes become my lie
Then I meet you, then I love you
Then you become a part of me
I won't be the tears that you cry
I will be strong, I'll be there for you
Dysthymia
