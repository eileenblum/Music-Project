Constant change, constant fear.

Maybe this would be an easier way to go,
Without these tuns, just going towards light.
But we can't choose their course,
Cause this is how we built us.
I know for sure that time is a mirror itself,
Somewhere along our lives, everything comes to an end.

But well, you're stronger than me
You can take, the bullet and keep yourself alive
Otherwise, I am weak so the moment
Is now, I chose death
Outside these walls I can see how night divides the day,
And as the dawn falls I feel sorrow and pain
Outside these walls I can see how night divides the day
And as the down falls I chose my death
