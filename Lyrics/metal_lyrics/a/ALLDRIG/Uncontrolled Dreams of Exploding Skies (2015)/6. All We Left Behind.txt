At this cold winter, lies are the sun
And our demise is this soft breeze
All the things that make us, apart
All the things that make me away, from your side
When you feel so warm, I feel so cold
When you search for lies, I find the truth
When you hear a laugh, I hear a scream
When you tough the light, I touch the dark
When you see life, I see death
When you find your path, I'm still lost
At this point of life, I reach my end
Thanks for those moment, thanks.
Always, never
I'll always be with you!
