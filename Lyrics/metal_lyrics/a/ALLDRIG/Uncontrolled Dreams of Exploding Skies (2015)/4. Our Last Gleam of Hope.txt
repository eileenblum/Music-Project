I felt a dying embrace, a soft touch of weary winds
Singing silent, a tragedy untold
Kneel down in solitude, again
Drowning silent, a confession untold
Take a look at nature, it's dead
And my last gleam of hope, stares into the forever night
And my last gleam of hope, stares into the forever night
In this crestfall orchard
The birds fly away
As everything lies down, the grown forest is screaming your name
As everything lies down, my last chance is to stare the forever night
Where are you, where is your love?
Is this time worth?
We are all blind
No one, no one...
