Our past sufferings were lessons,
and for every lesson we took our will got only stronger.
These decades of misery were a lesson,
and for each minute that passed our goal got only closer.

And the final lesson, and it's final assignment, we give you this day.
Take whatever you have at hand and turn it into a weapon.
Take whatever feelings you have left and turn them into hatred.

For there are no losers in our war.
It brings glory to the victors, it edifies the character of the noble defeated.
And it makes extinct what should not exist in the first.
And when our day comes...

All field lie fallow.
All grounds are ripe with blood.
Words echo hollow.
When every ploughshare's made a sword.

Comfort is the most dangerous enemy faced today.
It lingers and renders you incapable of any action worthwhile.

Serenity a poison made as deadly as any other.
It pacifies you and induces a state of mind.
In which you do not even recognize the most essential
Tributes of your existence

Our war is a wakeup call
It will bring us back where we belong
It will provide for us  a reason for our existence
This is not the war to end all wars
This is the war that will never end...

All field lie fallow.
All grounds are ripe with blood.
Words echo hollow.
When every ploughshare's made a sword.
