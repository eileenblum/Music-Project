The world is a sinking ship
Sunk by the weight of six billion people
We were sentenced to this fate
By those tho preached that they all
are as good as you and I
That they all should decide our destination
Though none of them has found a meaningful
Direction for themselves

Now everthing we loved will die
Unless get another go at steering

So here we stand,
On the summit of the aft,
Hurling defiance at those who are our misortune
