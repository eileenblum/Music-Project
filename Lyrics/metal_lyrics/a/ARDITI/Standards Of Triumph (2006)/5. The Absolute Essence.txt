No disease has never been cured
Unless it's cause is known
This is equally true medicine as in politics
And on our way to find the reason we are ill
This is the absolute essence:

Let the word Discrete be replaced by DECISIVE
Let the word Fair be replaced by GREAT
Let the word Freedom be replaced by UNITY
And let the word Community be replaced by BLOOD
