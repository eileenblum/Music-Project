From the earth and toward the skyâ¦
Heal me!
Touch of goddess is pure incantation.
Admired by her statureâ¦
As act of valor.
Condemned by sin and violation!
It comes from dark, and constantly retention.
"This is not your blameâ¦", with forced revelations she tell.
With the pure soul gathered by the desert,
As the children of wind consonance.
Without my soul, gathered storms,
Listen the voice of the place of arcane.
Without my soul, gathered storms,
I will draw my sword as the price of warden!
Will of thy Deprival!
Years of doom inside of the place of arcane.
Made a sworn with the Deprivalâ¦
â¦with the Deprival!
In sculpted face all my essence will be unseen.
Santuary of black and white, gold and silver
Will not accept you, until you break the chains.

Skinless weak bodies and bones stuck in mud,
Those was deprived, now â prepared for revive.
Living because she wants, fighting in the name of the act of valor
Befouled gardens will bloom
In sculpted face all my essence will be unseen.
â¦hallow, revere the touch of God hands...
Shiver and tremble in front of my face!
Live with the memories of that meeting day.
Obsession. I will listen to my heart... with this rude ailing tension I fell.
