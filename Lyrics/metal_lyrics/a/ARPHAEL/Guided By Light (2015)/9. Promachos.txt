Walking in the garden between trees, breathing air with the scent of olive, touching the flowers and sing.
Images of pastâ¦ you fall asleep.
Running through the endless fields of gore and flesh. Run in agony, hopeless and desperation. Throe become your mate. You overreact, but it is only a dream.
Promachos!
Thy glory become lethal sin.
Mighty and strong, hope for a thousands. Tender and gentle creation. But once was foregone to choose the one and bless her for leading a battle and to become a primordial form and symbol of courage and wisdom.
Wake up and stand! Legion in front of you waiting for command to be set before mist will come and force us beg for deathâ¦
Set us free!
Almighty wounded us - thou set colossal abomination of men.
Glaukopis! Goddess â Parthenos. You bringer of light!
Mighty and strong, hope for a thousands. Tender and gentle creation. But once was foregone...
Era of dreadful gigantomachy ends. Evil was slain.
Darkness was dispelled.
...to choose the one and bless her for leading a battle and to become a primordial form and symbol of courage and wisdom.
Nameless becomes a living divine, Olympians call her a goddess and name her â Athena!
From now her heart was broke. Her beloved, she was fighting for, disappears foreverâ¦
