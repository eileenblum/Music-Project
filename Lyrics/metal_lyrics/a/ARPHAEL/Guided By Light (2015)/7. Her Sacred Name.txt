Father of all please consider end of this warâ¦
The ground I stand is full of lies, so I looked in to the skies through the stars!
Reading crests of constellations, reading through asterisms. Believing that once I will stop this war, stop this fighting, stop this battle against the world.
Gathered by the star in heaven, principal of equity. She is hope of men!
I am guardian of order, and so I am the justice. I am the great reliance for those whom I inspiring.
Gladness of my adherents is reason to throw away the swords. Brighter time. Only this can force me smile and laugh while I was led by stars, I was led to the sun - to the coordination sign.
Her way was always consecrated to not get lost within the sands and to open eyes to see the truth, to realize the meaning of words, said by tongues of repulsed. Lady becomes a messenger of faith.
So they call it, serve it, chanting at the twilight.
With cult of hope they came.
They build a temple to perpetuate her name. To kindle fire and set a first flame. The sacred fire that will always warm their hearts as memory of one, who came as human and who became a god. Released for the living. The stone altar becomes behest â âthis is sacred for the endâ.
As of devastated lands.. they prayed for her sacred name.
Will my tears fall down? What in my heart now?
I will repent! For my all sins!..
...repent! For my all sins!..
Do I really sinned for this anguish? Crying for him, my only feel, answer to me, what is real meaning of this?
Kneeled in despair, alone under the rays.
Followed by winds and sun. Declared as redemption. Legends will declaim her sacred name!
