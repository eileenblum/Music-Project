Strand of good brakes once the evil force upset the balance.
It cannot accept that the reign of welfare begins.
All over the world, creeping shadows begin to prowl.
As the evil gods will quench their thirst.
As scum of night, as waste of mire, keeps to victimize, and persecute to Lethe.
Crying for the Nameless savior!
Open your arms â perfect creation!
Gods of the underworld destroying all in what we believe.
The council of Olympian deities decided to bring back the peaceâ¦
From the Asphodel Meadows, from the depths of Acheron, vicious spirits flies outside their caves and prisons, to dwell between the nations, and seed the chaos.
Bloated wrath, his highness â Erebus.
He will immerse world into night.
Nothing will hide from his cosmic sight.
Tormentor of dark, torturer of cosmos.
Swallow and devour, waste consuming insatiate god.
Ruthlessly impaling, without remorse,
Rotten despot will be someday gone!..
With might of right she will stop the fight.
Once again a shining lady steps on to the groundâ¦
Be blessedâ¦
