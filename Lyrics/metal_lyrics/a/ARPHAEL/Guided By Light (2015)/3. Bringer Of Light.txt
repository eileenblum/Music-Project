"Messenger of bliss, heal us from this burning wounds we have received in the war against the sacred vow in the name of welfare, in name of prosperity".

Breeze brings her back to the ground. Shine in her eyes only intensified with a new glow. Nameless walks toward those, who managed to survive.
Staying between what is turn to ash, look around â the piles of flesh.
She vowed revenge, travels through the ruins.
Guided by shine, living in my heart.
Guided by sun â eternal light.
Darkest doom revealed through the evil thoughts.
Laying on the top of the veracity, the truth and verity will clean out the filth and muck of arrival gloom.
Glaring shine, that was never seen,
Radiant aura, that was never felt.
Crestfallen follows nameless redeemer.
Skyborn leads the army of united unbroken men.
All who can handle swords and spears, all who want to resist the invaders,
in favor of bright future, the future of generations.
From days to weeks, from weeks to months nations expels the spawns of dark. Nameless rejoiced victory and success that accrue with an effort of thousands.
...
But a strange heartache leads her to miseryâ¦
Pain in her heart and anxiety deprives her spirit.
Seek for your eyes throughout a time!
Searching through emptiness, living in void.
Fire transformed into Light
Darkness dissected my heart
Guided by shine, living in my heart.
Guided by sun â eternal light.
Seek for your eyes throughout a time!
Searching through emptiness, living in void.
Lead us through night â bringer of light!
