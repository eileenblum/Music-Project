Decimated god, have all sins of men. Breeding a sore and sow the tears of plague. Paid his bloodshed life for the mistakes, and he said: "I possess my crown of evil", and vanishes away!
Based react under you sin is a portion of wine on your tongue as on my hand going to be paid for boiling my blood â delicacy that going to save your life. You should do this â annihilate this world without me.
That was my fault, I lead you to nowhere. Called by god, and obsessed by loss.
Desecrated and disgusted devil within. Praise my world of darkness and become a form of shadowed horde.
Evil force of doom, tells the truth of your suffocation being.
Hope on your mighty wisdom.
Help us all â mighty wisdom.
Profaned dead isolated for decade. Killed for abhorred life of fallen god, from the heaven.
Pay for the sins of your fathers!
My hating bleeding soul!.. hating soul.
Troops of goodness intersect with hordes of the underdark side. They fight as thousands and stand as one. They fights a days until the sun was raised.
Dark attempt was defeated.
â¦
Fight for freedom and seek of truth is the way to victory.
I am not afraid of darkness!
I search for love for decades, and now will live suffocated!
