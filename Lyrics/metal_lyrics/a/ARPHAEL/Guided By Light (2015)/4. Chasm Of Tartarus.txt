Supported by cruel and fierce consort, depraved tyrant invades and shows ferocity.
Nyx was her name, mother of dark, hidden under the black veil.
Black mask â immoral fetter. Dark eyes, radiating anger.
Shawled by fog, wrapped in clouds.
Was created a maze of delusion, states of decay.
Blazing abyss in vehement wail, blatant insomniac hell.
Place that ruled by the kings of night. Essential part of Hades.
Sending storms, sending swarms, reapers and butchers to demolish existence.
I look at prisoned gods through the sea, from the skies.
And nothing can hold me from my harm.
Deep in Tartarus fallen was caged.
I see those fallen but fallen will never see.
In the pits of torment they were gathered together.
Slaughter!.. ground will bathe in blood, we will haunt up everyone, pursue and torment.
Symbolic mourn with vicious thorns.
As of betrayer - chase him down.
Haunt up my desperate son and tore him apart.
Mired in vices, Tantalus - traitor king. Full of scorn and neglect despot.
Below the Hades, caged in chasm, worshiped to Tartarus, ominous prisoners.
Ave, Thanatos! Ave, Hypnos! Acolytes of chaos, servants of vast.
Strengthens and waiting for moment to be released and bring the vengeance to upper worldâ¦
