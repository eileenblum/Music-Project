The last days were so shy
We know, the war is near
Our wives cried every night
War can't wait, war is here

Father's son is not king any more
His brave uncle took the throne
Tonight is the night of the great decision the biggest one since we were born

We have chosen the war of cries,
The bloodiest way to the fame,
Foe the freedom we will die 
For our families and Serbia name

Can you hear? 
The war song by church's bells
In few days 
We'll know heaven or hell!

My mother, my family wish me luck
Friends and swords are waiting for me
Mother please don't you cry,
What's going to be it will be

When I go, I won't come back
My trip is long without the end
Maybe, I'll be back with the glory
Or I will leave this famous land 

We have chosen the war of cries,
The bloodiest way to the fame,
Foe the freedom we will die 
For our families and Serbia name

Can you hear? 
The war song by church's bells
In few days 
We'll know heaven or hell!
