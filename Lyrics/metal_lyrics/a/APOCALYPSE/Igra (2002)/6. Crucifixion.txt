Crucifixion wasn't for Jesus,
Always the same Dying,
Follow into the night we go,
Instead gregarious killers lying.

Hands which are full of promises
Bring just death, angel's pain
In the darkness of the day's light 
Pilats have right others are insane

Pilats are looking good with the mission
Hands on the wall crucifixion 
Take my hand you'll understand
Always the same the world stands

Crucifixion wasn't for Jesus,
Always the same Dying,
Follow into the night we go,
Instead gregarious killers lying.

Close your eyes for one second
Thousands of crosses wait 
More someone's satisfaction
More someone's crucifixion 

Pilats are looking good with the mission
Hands on the wall crucifixion 
Take my hand you'll understand
Always the same the world stands
