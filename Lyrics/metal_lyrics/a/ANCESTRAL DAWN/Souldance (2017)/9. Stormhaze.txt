[Music and lyrics: Higginson]

[The Haze:] 
You think you are divine Lucidity 
But I'm the one to fill your grief 
This burning hearts are now a memory, a lie 
They keep on sailing through the dark! 

[Bastian:] 
I can feel their call, 
They are now ready to become the new angels 

[The Haze:] 
Corruption is my name 

[Bastian:] 
Life is fighting stronger 
And her soul is igniting my way 

[The Haze:] 
There's no scapeâ¦ no! 

[Bastian:] 
Is time to set them free! 

[The Haze:] 
For I'm the one inside your dreams 

[Bastian:]
I'm the one inside your dreams 

[The Haze:] 
Gaining power from a lake of tears 
Dare no longer to believe 

[Bastian:]
Dare no longer to believe

[The Haze:] 
The end has come a grey new sun! 

[Bastian:] 
Prisoners went blind 
They were hidden from the light, now awaken 
A flame is burning bright 
Talismans blow out 
By the force of a great new dawn 
My great new sun 

I can feel their call, 
They are now ready to become 
The new angels 

[The Haze:] 
There's no scapeâ¦ no!

[Bastian:] 
Is time to set them free! 

[The Haze:] 
For I'm the one inside your dreams 

[Bastian:]
I'm the one inside your dreams

[The Haze:] 
Gaining power from a lake of tears 
Dare no longer to believe 

[Bastian:]
Dare no longer to believe

[The Haze:] 
The end has come a grey new sun 
Kneel before the Haze! 

[Solos: Castro]

[Bastian:] 
I can feel their call
They are now ready to become the new angels 

[The Haze:] 
Corruption is my name! 

[Bastian:] 
Life is fighting stronger 
And her soul is igniting my way 

[The Haze:] 
There's no scapeâ¦ no! 

[Bastian:] 
Is time to set them free! 

[The Haze:] 
For I'm the one inside your dreams 

[Bastian:]
I'm the one inside your dreams 

[The Haze:] 
Gaining power from a lake of tears 
Dare no longer to believe 

[Bastian:] Dare no longer to believe 

[The Haze:] 
The end has come a grey new sun 

[Bastian:] 
For I'm the one inside your dreams 

[The Haze:]
I'm the one inside your dreams

[Bastian:]
Bringing life and burning from within 
This hearts are ready to believe 
Your time has come, a great new sun!
