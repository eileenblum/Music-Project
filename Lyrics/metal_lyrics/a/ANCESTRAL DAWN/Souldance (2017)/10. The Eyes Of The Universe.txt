[Wayla Wisha:]
You've travelled far away
Into this land of magic a story was foretold
Now gather and behold!

[Virakocha:]
I still remember 
Frozen lives caught in the rain of fallen pride
We beat the night!

[Voice of the souls:]
I can feel, the time is getting near,
Desolation leaves my eyes
All despair, the haze that blinds the way,
Shatters now! Riding high we go!

[Bastian:]
Flying, hold on to me
Gliding through the sky
No one can tear us apart from our dreams
Don't be afraid, don't you dare to give up!

[Bastian:]
Brave hearts are back
The spell has been undone
For you have helped me stand my ground
[Virakocha:]
When humans learn
Despite the dark over the mountains and the clouds
Prevails the dawn!

[Voice of the souls:]
Drawn the line
A devil is left behind,
When you looked him in the eye
No more grey, new colors light the way
No more tears! Riding high we go!

[Bastian:]
Flying, hold on to me
Gliding through the sky

[Wayla Wisha:]
No one can tear us apart from our dreams
Don't be afraid,

[Bastian:]
Don't you dare to give up!

[Solos: Castro-Bello]

[Jessica:]
Ascension

[Bastian:]
Redemption

[Together:]
Flows across the wind, forevermore

[Bastian:]
Ascension

[Jessica:]
Redemption

[Together:]
Don't keep standing still, waiting for me, my heaven is where you are!

[Bastian-Virakocha-Wayla Wisha:]
Flying, hold on to me
Gliding through the sky
No one can tear us apart from our dreams
Don't be afraid, don't you dare to give up!
