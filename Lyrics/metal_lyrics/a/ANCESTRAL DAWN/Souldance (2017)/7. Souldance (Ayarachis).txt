[Music and lyrics: Higginson]

[Voice of the souls:] 
Blazing tears on my heart
Show me where to go, tell me how to find (Show me a sign)
Oh, tell me!
Who can release me from the pain? Our pain
There's a place to go...

Who holds this new power?

[Bastian:]
Ancient gods, they lead my way!

[Voice of the souls:] 
Myth and legend, a tale!
Our banal desire...
I'll show you a brighter side!

[Voice of the souls:]
Mist through the sand

[Bastian:]
All souls, before...

[Voice of the souls:]
Steals our calm,

[Bastian:] ...a great, new force...

[Bastian:] 
Oh, tell me!
Are her eyes crying by your side?
Is her hope still alive? For I'm on the run, 
To find our way out!

[Voice of the souls:] 
A spark in the shadows...
Love's a flame that can remain
Let us show you the way!
Freedom's now calling

[Bastian:]
So guide me through her eyes!

[Together:]
Why, oh tell me why
Beyond the sorrow of all twisted men
A light ignites within to free their...

Minds, release your minds
Burn all the fear invading you now 
As the core inside the soul dance is raised again

[Solos: Grapow-Bello]
