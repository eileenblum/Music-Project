[Music: Higginson]
[Lyrics: Higginson]

[Wayla Wisha:]
Are your eyes, so bright,
Allowed to see our fallen paradise?
The leaves and a prophecy
Had granted power through the mist, oooh oh

Yeah, right! Hundreds of years went by,
For a man to poke around
Yeah, right, this shaman's eyes are awake
And's never too late

[Together:]
Holy one, shall we bow to the march of time?
Holy one, or is this the omen?,
Your voices have drawn the way

[Bastian:]
Millions falling, by their own clouds, 
Visions of children in black and white 
Don't leave behind the promises you made...
Now they are one with the empty grey lord!

[Wayla Wisha:]
Yeah, right, hundreds of years passing by,
So there's no time to fall apart
Yeah, right, a painful story must end,
I must find her ...

[Together:]
Holy one, shall we bow to the march of time?
Holy one, or is this the omen?
Your voices have drawn the way

[Solos: Bello-Castro-Rengifo]

[Bastian:]
You are the knowledge I'm the key

[Wayla Wisha:]
Let's break down the seal,
Let's break down the seal, ooh!

[Bastian:]
Tell me the way to reach a god

[Rick-Wayla Wisha:]
Fire and blood foretold,
Fire and blood foretold!

[Bastian:]
Follow the voice to some place...

[Together:]
Holy one, shall we bow to the march of time?
Holy one, or is this the omen?
Your voices have drawn the way

Holy one, shall we bow to the march of time?
Holy one, or is this the omen?
Your voices have drawn the way
Follow the voices on the fire!
