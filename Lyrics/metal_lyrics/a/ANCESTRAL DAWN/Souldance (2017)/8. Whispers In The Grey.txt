[Lyrics: Higginson]

[Bastian:]
Grey new dawn, this day belongs to my dreams...
To light them once again
Can my eyes foretell her fate before the haze
Reaps my fears from this agony? 

[Jessica:]
These ties won't fade
But my soul will take you with the flow 
In your hands, the key to set us free, ohâ¦
For now I roamâ¦

[Together:]
Someone can tell
If she's fighting from the other side of pain?
If I could get back my faith
I'll guide you through the way
For this void inside is calling out your name

[Bastian:]
Somehow I know that I can feel her call
Like in a song 

[Jessica:]
Hand in hand we are gonna break the mirror
To keep our hope

[Solos: C.Cuadros]

[Together:]
Someone can tell
If she's fighting from the other side of pain?
If I could get back my faith
I'll guide you through the way
For this void inside is calling out your name
