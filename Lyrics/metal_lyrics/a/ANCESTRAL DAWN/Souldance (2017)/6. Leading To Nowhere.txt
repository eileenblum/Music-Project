[Music and lyrics: Higginson]

[Ancient Voice:]
Nebula Omnipresens ducit 
Lucet, in tenebris magnis

[Bastian:] 
Walking in this empty room, falling in despair,
Whispering her voices down, within my head

[Mistress of illusion:]
Shout aloud!
The lord of this lands, is here to grant you life!

[Bastian:]
Give in to you? A demon in disguise!

[Mistress of illusion:]
Joyful tears and love await
I've seen the maiden, crying out your name

[Bastian:]
Just leave my mind, my fears are left behind!

[Ancient Voice:]
Serving the fog, Warlock! Making it talk, Tupaj!
Serving the fog, Warlock! Twisting his fate! 

[Sairi Tupaj:]
Hold on to me, lay your soul on the coven!

[Mistress of illusion:]
Born before the lights of dawn
Mist and fire, black as night, my lord!

[Sairi Tupaj:]
Don't you see? His power is so clear, look around!

[Mistress of illusion:]
Make the binds and she will live,
Set the bounds and you won't see her smile

[Bastian:]
Just leave my mind, my fears are now undone!

[Sairi Tupaj:]
Hold on to me, lay your soul on the coven
Join our realm, join her love and become one

[Bastian:]
I hear the voice beyond illusions to remind me who I am,
Deep inside I know the truth is there, out there!

[Sairi Tupaj and the Mistress:]
From mist and fire, black as night, our lord was born 
Now join us, for you have seen the signs!

[Bastian:]
No!

[Solos: Rengifo-Castro-Bello]

[Bastian:]
I hear the voice beyond illusions, to remind me who I am
Deep inside I know the truth is there, out there!
