[Lyrics: Higginson]

[Bastian:]
How can I hear the ancient voice?

[Ancient Voice:] 
Bring him to life!

[Bastian:]
A fallen sky beneath is growing on and on
Now we must prevent the sun!

[Ancient voice:]
Fight the haze!
Is not too late!

[Bastian:]
Oh, the spirit is so close to me! 

[Wayla Wisha:]
Take me where fire remains

[Bastian:] 
Where's the creator of the earth?

[Wayla Wisha:]
Follow your sight, the temple awaits
"A ritual must ignite the flame"
The time is getting closer, my dreams had predicted the call!

[Ancient voice:]
Fight the haze!
Is not too late!
Light the flame!
Once again!

[Bastian:]
Will I find a way to get over the rain?
Fly and shine through the sky?
Now I feel the day cries for a ghost in the haze
Or am I going insane?

[Together:]
Find a way!

[Solos: Ch.Parra- Bello- Castro]

[Bastian:]
Finally, the ancient temple rises before my eyesâ¦

[Wayla Wisha:]
Creator of the universe, ignite the flame just one more time and save us from this madnessâ¦

[Bastian:]
Dispel the haze!

[Virakocha:]
I can recall the holy high priests
Falling asleep as darkness rises, oh no!
Now follow your eyes and bring back the sun
You will find a way to get over the rain,
Fly and shine through the sky
Now you feel the day cries for a ghost in the haze
And you aren't going insane

[Bastian:]
Will I find a way to get over the rain?
Fly and shine through the sky? 
Now I feel the day cries for a ghost in the haze
Or am I going insane?

[Virakocha:]
Find a way!
