[Bastian:]
No prayer to the rain
Nor "power that remains inside unknown"
Can heal the pain of this believer
"Wait for an angel's dawn"
The answer that could light my hope...
Wake up her soul from this nightmare, find her!

[Sairi Tupaj:]
Woe to you, let me show you the key!
Whispers in the wind they tell me,
There's more than just a strange disease to fearâ¦
Drink from the light now, oh!

[Together:]
Welcome to a new beginning
Across the dark you can't deny it, no...
We must ride on the storm!
Travelling beyond what's real
You'll find the light you won't deny for long
Can't you feel what's into you?

[Bastian:]
The city among the haze,
The gods fallen from grace are now
Blinding the path of this believer
Or is it a new hope?
There's nowhere I can go, so now
Grant me the power to find her, guide me!

[Sairi Tupaj:] 
Woe to you, let me show you the key!

[Together:]
Welcome to a new beginning
Across the dark you can't deny it, no...
We must ride on the storm!
Travelling beyond what's real
You'll find the light you won't deny for long

Now, let's see what's into you!!!

[Solos: Romero]

[Sairi Tupaj:]
Come to me and free your mind,
And leave your sorrows behind.
Believe in thee
Fly, fly... go!

[Together:]
Welcome to a new beginning
Across the dark you can't deny it, no...
We must ride on the storm!
Travelling beyond what's real
You'll find the light you won't deny for long
Can you feel what's into you?

Welcome to a new beginning
Across the dark you can't deny it, no...
We must ride on the storm!
Travelling beyond what's real
You'll find the light you won't deny for long

[Bastian:]
Now I feel it too!
Now I feel it too!
