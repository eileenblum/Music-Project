Into the moist corridors
Onward to dungeons of death
Through the final gate of decomposition

Chalice of blood, in ancient temple of abhorrence
Ritual blade, in chamber of conjuring transformation

Kill yourself, bleed and die
The Blood Sacrifice allows you to discover
New meaning of death and life
Kill yourself, bleed and die
Let Them consume your mortal soul
And enjoy in eternal dying in pain

Into the moist corridors
Onward to dungeons of death
Through the final gate of decomposition.
