I am the fecal daemon
Summon me, and you'll never forget
Just like it's your primal time
Take me to your mouth
You whore, you slut
It's something more than just a lust

I am the abomination
I'm the repugnance and the doubt
So suck my sinew
Lick the brown cream up
Bite and swallow it
It's so soft
Sooner or later I shall get there
To all of your holy holes

I am the Fecal Daemon
Summon me, and you'll never forget
I am the succulent repugnance
That creeps between your legs
Every time they shall lick me
Thinking it's a sweet, smelling honey

The nearest cock will spread a piece of me
It will press me off again to the daylight
I'll be back into your mouth
Through the oesophagus, stomach to the guts again
And now you know how the hell tastes
Once you've tried and you won't escape

Oh' what a fool he thinks it's the host
The priest licking you swallows me without a grief
He drinks with a wine and ... yet
And then he makes his hands together thinking that he's just purified.
