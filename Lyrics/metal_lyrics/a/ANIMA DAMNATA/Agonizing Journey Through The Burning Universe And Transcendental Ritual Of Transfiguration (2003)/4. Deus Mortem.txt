I will go down to the altars in hell
To Satan, giver of life

Diabolus!
Diabolus rise!

Rise in the circle of this bloody oath
Come forth Horned Lord I summon Thee
I'm ready to die and to kill my doom
I summon Thee from Your underworld tomb

Diabolus!
Diabolus rise!

Rise Goat and rape all fucking virginity
Make holy figures bow to the Evil One
Shit on the holy altar, let them eat
I summon Thee in the name of hate and death

Diabolus!
Diabolus rise!

Rise Great Snake and bite pathetic holiness
Lead to eternal decay and altars of hell
Suffocate all those weak heavenly lambs
I summon Thee from abysmal darkness

Diabolus!
Diabolus rise!

Rise Sathanas, Master of slow agony
Give her Thy unholy semen and blood
I'm ready to die and to cut myself
I summon Thee from the underworld

Diabolus!
Diabolus rise!

Veni, omnipotens aeternae Diabolus!

Agios o Satanas!
Agios o Baphomet!
Agios o Atazoth!
Agios o Atazoth!
