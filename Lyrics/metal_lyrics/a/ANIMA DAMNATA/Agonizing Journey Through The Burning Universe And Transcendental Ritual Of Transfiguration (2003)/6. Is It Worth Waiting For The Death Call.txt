There are no promises, what are you waiting for?
Faeces everywhere, faeces of your morbid god
Let me feed on your guts, become my lust

Pain is a lair of my dreams and nothing more
Faeces everywhere, faeces of your morbid god
Is it worth waiting for the death call?

Blood from wounds - Satan is Lord
Breath from mouth - Satan is Lord
Birth from cunt - Satan is Lord
Life is nothing worth
Laugh and die in flames
Spit and rise on pyre
Dance and masturbate
No more life - Satan is Lord

Come with me to the Suicidal Church of Hell
I want to see you eating your own skin
Hear your nocturnal sluts are calling loud

Evoke the ethereal demons and spin around with them
End your life as you always want, punish your soul
Is it worth waiting for the death call?

Blood from wounds - Satan is Lord
Breath from mouth - Satan is Lord
Birth from cunt - Satan is Lord
Life is nothing worth

Through the stench of desecrated graves
Towards inhumanity, terror and death
I love decadence...
