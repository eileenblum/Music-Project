Satan!, Hail Satan!

Suicidal copulation with infernal whore
Bestial penetration of rotting vagina
Tortured flesh is a source of sadistic lust
Deep in vulgar violence love is the final torment

In the name of Satan, I take your breath
Rebirth in sodomy, rebirth in suffering
Bleed and breed the night, bleed and breed the night
In the name of Satan, I take your sin

Satan!, Hail Satan!, Satan! Hail Satan!

Devoured by pain seduced by death
In ritual chambers drink the blood
From suffering there is no way out

Suffocated in a dead womb
Stillborn god imprisoned in oblivion
From suffering there is no way out

Obscure form from black emptiness
Embodiment of hate and wrath
From suffering there is no way out

Emaciated angels struggle in their cages
of divine lies and obscenity
Wormy corpse nailed to cross,
serpents spawned in holy mouth
Blissful pain embraces mind
Rebirth in sodomy, rebirth in suffering!

In the name of Satan, I take your breath
Rebirth in sodomy, rebirth in suffering
Bleed and breed the night, bleed and breed the night
In the name of Satan, I take your sin.
