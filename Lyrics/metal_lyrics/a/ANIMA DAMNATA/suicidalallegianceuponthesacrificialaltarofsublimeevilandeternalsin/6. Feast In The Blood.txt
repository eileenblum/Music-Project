Little corpses mutilated
Torn to pieces bodies
Bleeding veins and crushed bones
Children killed for a pleasure
Ripped out from mother's womb

Feast in their blood
Ritual death

Little heads nailed to walls
Entrails slashed by the steel
Gore and vomits on our hands
In a chalice deformed brain
Eat their bodies, drink their blood

Feast in their blood
Ritual death

Morbid priests dance in fire
Fulfill their desire
Feast in the blood.
