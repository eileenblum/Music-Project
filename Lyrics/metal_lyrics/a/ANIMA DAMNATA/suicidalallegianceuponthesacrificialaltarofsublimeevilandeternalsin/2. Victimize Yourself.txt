Victimize yourself
It is time for you to die
Close your eyes and say goodbye
Devil waits for sacrifice
Open veins, praise his name

Victimize yourself
Free your soul by the blade

Suicidal ceremony
Declaration of agony

Agony, agony, agony, agony

Enter into the infernal fire of self-destruction
Behold the seven eternal thrones of abomination
Life it is only the flagellation of the unclean soul
Victimize yourself and crush carnal cradle of condemnation

Enter into the infernal fire of self-destruction
Hear the deathlike calling of the gods hungry for your weak flesh
Impious rituals in pentagram will open gate for you
Victimize yourself and crush carnal cradle of condemnation.
