Die.
You are the sacred whore
Possessing human's soul
You are the fading light
Dying with your faith
Die.
You are demented shepherd
Leading into rood's fetter
You are the twisting path
For sacrificial goats
Die.
I'm killing you inside of me
I'm killing you inside of me
I'm killing you inside of me
In my life there is no place for you

You are the sacred whore
Possessing human's soul
You are demented shepherd
Leading into rood's fetter

Die in your own mercy
Let demons eat your heart
I want to burn in hell
So don't worry about my soul
DIE!!!
I'm killing you inside of me
I'm killing you inside of me
I'm killing you inside of me
I'm killing you inside of me
I'm killing you inside of me
In my life there is no place for you.
