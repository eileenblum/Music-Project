Because I'm the last one of the damned

Any god can't bite my soul
Any faith can't broke my faith
There is nothing to confess
Mortal sins in corpse they left
Dead in time alive in hate
Black and evil without mercy
Just creation of deranged god

Crypt of soul is open wide
Tears of blood run from veins
Now the flesh turns to flesh
Soul unpure and infected mind
Are against all human kind
burnt by sun and covered by dust
The last one of the damned.

ANIMA
DAMNATA
ANIMA
DAMNATA

Fading lights
Damned lies
Jesus died.
