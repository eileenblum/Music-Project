Disturbed by solar wind
Night's sky abides
Contemplating the silver light
As a matter of iniquity

Natural distress / A sudden flame
Stirs down to the unknown
Unblessed by the flame / A natural distress
A goddess illuminates the realm

Aurora
Set to march its soil
Aurora
Ready to twirl the foil

Come forth, arise
Queen of silver light
Goddess of fire!
Disturb the solar wind
Abide the night's sky
Stir the unknown
Goddess of fire!
Illuminate the realm

Natural distress / A sudden flame
Stirs down to the unknown
Unblessed by the flame / A natural distress
A goddess illuminates the realm

Aurora
Set to march its soil
Aurora
Ready to twirl the foil
