A try to embrace the new. A struggle to find the path,
That leads us away from ourselves.

May the stench of failure bring clarity.
May shoulders heal from the weight of burden.
May the sun be forgiving.
May the son be forgiving.

I can not reach the fire that falls behind.
A growing shadow within fades what once was close.
A worn and bleached out mind that failed to hold on.
By the flame of the son gives the strength to carry on.

A vision of what to come remains in blur. Delusion marks the end,
Making our lifelines uncrossed.
