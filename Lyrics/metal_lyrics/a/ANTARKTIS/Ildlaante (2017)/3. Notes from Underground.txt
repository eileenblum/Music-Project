Amending a tidal bore
Diminishing a leap of faith
Beneath a swelling shore
Diving deep, a rebirth of hate

Sinister, truthfully
A path, a way for seldom translation
Irony, mystically
Internal barriers, forging migration

Contemplation of a just remorse
Desperately trying to drown aphasia
Doubt lives through, diagnosis: hoarse
A coup d'etat of Austrasia

Notes from the underground
Cried truth from blood
Shackled walls are closing in
Feels like coming home
