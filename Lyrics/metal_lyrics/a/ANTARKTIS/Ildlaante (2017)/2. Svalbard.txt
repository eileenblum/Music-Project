Hollow bones are marching further
Tired eyes set to reach the old sun
Roots are crawling deeper
Digging tunnels for the mind
Our souls returning home

The rivers run through frozen land
Break the stone with shattered hand
Our time is now, let the monuments fall
Let us become the end

These walls are coming down
Abandoning flesh and bone
The world is falling down
Our souls returning home

Onward march through frozen lands
Tired eyes set to reach the oldest of suns
Crawling back into the soil
Broken nails will never rest
