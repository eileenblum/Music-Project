A vast distance beneath the shore
An entrance to the unknown
Alone we stare into the cold
The vast weld it's grasp

Ash arise, ash define

Beyond shores, a trail of screaming echoes
A silent tide is moving
Behind walls, we walk a thousand miles
A silent storm is roaring

Ash arise, ash define, ash divide, ash divine

One thousand miles at glacial pace
Let us run forever at the speed of light

Beyond shores, a trail of screaming echoes
A silent tide is moving
Behind walls, we walk a thousand miles
A silent storm is roaring

Beyond shores. Ash arise, ash define
Behind walls. Ash divide, ash divine
