Gather 'round 
Faceless bidders 
As sickening grins 
Flood the room 
Cheque books 
At the ready 
We'd like to present to you 

A deadly cocktail of mind control and 
Psychological warfare 
Chemicals shoved down the throat 
And sleeping into the skin 
Psychological inceptions 
Misrepresentations 
Overthrown nations 
Oppressive creations 
With the blood of the innocent dashed on top all 
Sold to the highest bidder 
To be enjoyed 
Under the illusion of grandeur 
Just keep on buzzing 
Hive 
Blind in your ignorance 
Just keep on chasing paper 
We're enthroned as kings under the light 

Of an entire population's ignorance 
What are you blind? 
You pathetic cunts 

Next up for auction is a machine race with depraved minds 
Unknowingly enslaved our methods ensure their mass distraction while we're 
Retching heaving promises 
Painting a portrait for the public 
Can I start the bidding at a price tag worthy of a carefully thought out termination of a healthy portion of their un...
Awakened lives 
That we may reign as gods 

Forever more 

Listen up now 
We have spent years dominating 
Over humanity 
So get back to finacing the dying economy 
Take a look at this celebrity 
Isn't she pretty 
As she smiles with grill 
Don't look at this auction of depravity 
With the buying and selling 
Of humanity 
Alright 
Take a look at humanity 
Aren't we clever 
As we shun each other for a system 
Cast your unscathed eyes aside 
Why not just carve them out because we have our first bid 
Critical structures fall clinically 
The second bid 
Unspoken numbers surely die 
Upon the third bid 
Their souls are callously fed to the jaws of the beast 
As religios belief controls the weak 
Under a polluted skyline insufficient 
Awoken minds get ridiculed and branded with insanity 
While most behave like sheep 
Running circles in the street saying work work work 
All whilst we accept our fourth bid 
Force feeding you war and famine and disease and 
Detrimental in conclusions 
Sparking riots hailing mass 
Public disorder 
All whilst we commence this auction 
In the confines of conspiracy 

And it's all sold to the men who print the money 
Along with all the requirements of life 
Control the money 
Control the people
