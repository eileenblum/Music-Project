Gagged with propaganda
Blindfold removed, time to wake the fuck up
You little fucking piece of filth
You need to sit the fuck down
Quivering, hyperventilating
As the residuum of a disemboweled monarch
Slowly coils around your closed mind
And un-awakened, brain dead form
Skull removed, exposing the brain to the world
Now you're open-minded, bitch
Removed, exposing the brain to the world
Now you're open-minded
Conforming slut
Oh, let us scrape the residuum inside
You'll gain a new appreciation for disembowelment
Inciting devourment
Of this putrid system that's infected with false hope
False dreams, false beliefs, false systems
All of this falseness; work 8 hours, sleep 8 hours
Coward!
Do this, do that
Do not question authority
Breed, misconceive
Choke on the disinformation that they feed
In a glorified planet-wide lab
Hold still society, it's just a quick jab
Strapped down with the cranium exposed
Now you're open-minded, bitch
Plastic gloves and a surgeon's mask
Blood dripping down your forehead
Reminiscing of a third eye
Now you're fucking open-minded, bitch
Your detachment from reality
Obscured by the residual leftovers of a greedy infestation
A swarm, swarming the world like a disease
Infecting every putrid sect with isolation
Manipulation on a planet-wide scale
Like some sickening legion of disgusting parasites
