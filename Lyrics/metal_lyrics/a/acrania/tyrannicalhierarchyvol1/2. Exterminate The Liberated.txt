Today we'll discuss economic perversion for profit and for domination
Leaders chuckle with a hideous glee
Pen in hand, please sign here, right here in blood

(I want the truth.)
You can't handle the truth!

On the dotted line, your people one step closer to becoming free
We'll sell you all these fucking weapons
Just take a look

Automatic rifles, tanks and some explosives too
Amongst the poverty, we'll hide
Seeds for atrocities, dismemberment and mutilation
Destructive solutions, a common strategy in our business
Insolvency issues and a stack debt of manufactured
We know you're fucking hungry but you better take a bullet for the rich
Don't worry, we insist

Your people will be liberated
No more inconsideration
Insufficient education shall enforce the legitimation of our deal
Trust

Here, it's a good price
Buy these instruments of destruction
Fuck it
We'll even show you how to use them
Detrimental training tearing up consensus on a peaceful situation
Inhaling violence like your conscience has eroded
Into an infectious dust thrust into the winds of time
Contagiously scraping lungs further down the line
We'll take it back, everything and more
Everything and more

Oh, we're selling missiles by the fucking truckload
We make our profits selling death
So back the fuck down and shut your mouths
We don't need to listen
Our media will brand you as a bunch of terrorists

The news anchor speaks as if she tells the truth
Insurgents breached the peace
And leaders turned their backs on their people
Slaughtering the innocent
Where did they get the capabilities or the know how?
We have reason to believe
They're harbouring weapons of mass destruction
Oh and some oil too

Fucking terrorist scum
The perfect alibi for repetitive propaganda
Hate
The news anchor squirms
The concept for religion is the perfect influence for hate
Speaking scripted words
One system of control supporting another
A political use of religion works perfect when you create racism

They're using biological warfare
The sky rains down a cloud of an infectious gas
Searing skies and attacking nervous systems
Sickening as vital organs dissolve
It's sickening as we dupe the public
Sickening as we invade their land
Causing devastation, death and destruction
Sick

Oh wait, they're retaliating
Obviously with the goal of sending a message to the powers of the west
It's retaliation through more fucking death
An endless murderous cycle
Perpetuated by religious and political systems
Genius really
They've got us fighting with each other and it makes them richer
The best solution to lowering the population
Is to turn us against one another
There is no fucking war, only terrorism
There is no fucking war, only terrorism
An endless cycle of manufactured violence
Where world leaders kill more than any so-called terror ever will
