A spectacle in vain of fictional entertainment
Nothing more than a distraction
With the characters created 
By such influential men behind the scenes

Camera, action
Make up, action
Lies, snap
Fucking action!

Lightning, action
Lines at the ready
Lies, snap
Fucking action!

Creatively designing the illusion of choice
Intrinsically sculpting 
At the aura of democracy
Oh, this suit makes you look so honest

A certain type of lightning gives a warm glow
Now take your fucking scripts!

Personalities
Quirks and trivialities
Spring from scriptwriters tongues
So trivially

Building a theatrical mass distraction
That these puppets stand for

Radically different
Political philosophies
Misrepresenting cleverly
Like some cheap reality TV show

Increased surveillance
Tax and more control
We'll try to lower taxes
But we'll take more from the poor

Like a sacrificial ritual
To monetary systems
The stars of the show fake a smile and
Take their seats upon the glutinous wings of arrogance

Watch
Follow the script
If you think that it will make the slightest difference
Vote
Waste your time on a fictional debate

Pertaining to a legion of lies
Obey this puppet
Show stuck on repeat
The illusion of choice

Eat up
You pigs

Gorging yourself upon their fucking lies

Infatuated with 
Opposing parties quarreling for inconsistent reasons
Competing superficially 
Festering with dishonesty
Shaking hands behind the scenes

Entertaining the blind 
Pay close attention
Charismatic tyranny!
Do you have no memory?

You're dancing with hypocrisy
Part of the system
Everybody's fast asleep

Time to realize
That whoever you'll vote for
It'll make no difference
They are one and the same!

How could you think their one to trust?
Glorifying the pursuit of greed and lust
These streets were never paved in gold
They're littered with the bodies of the ones who said no

Vote for Corruption
