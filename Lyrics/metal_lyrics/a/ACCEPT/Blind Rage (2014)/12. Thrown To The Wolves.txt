She had an endless hunger, had evil in her eyes
She had a bite like an alligator, eat a man alive
Just a face of innocence, with a heart full of sin
Came a'knocking upon my door and said, "Little pig, let me in!"

She was dressed like a angel, in a sheep white wool
I didn't see the danger, I'd been thrown to the wolves
(To the wolves!)
I'd been thrown to the wolves
(To the wolves!)

I've heard all the stories about a she-wolf pack
Didn't believe a word they said, 'til her claws were in my back
She stared at me like some wild bitch, and howled at the moon
I knew right there I was too far gone, I was soon to be consumed

She had a halo above her, but she had no soul
I was about to discover, I'd been thrown to the wolves
(To the wolves!)
I'd been thrown to the wolves
(To the wolves!)
