Crash bars out the door, stomping on through the town
Crowd crush beyond control, this body's gonna take you down
Bulldozer chew you up, the bucket will spit you out
Steam roll you in the mud, I'll tell you what it's all about
It's your time ...

Flash mob, run away, feet flying through the air
No time, no escape, caught within the snare
Stump grinder punish you, drag you in the dirt
I'll plant you in the soil and serve your just deserts

So now - It's the end of the line, you plead your crimes
But you're wasting your breath, you're never gonna get away

Stampede ... Trampled to the ground
Stampede ... Flattened by the sound ... Hit you like a
Stampede ... Grind you in the stones
Stampede ... I'll pulverize your bones

You're gonna disappear into the bloody swell
Drag you round and down to a mosh pit straight from hell
Knock you off your throne, rearrange your face
And when you bottom out, it's a long way down from grace

So now - It's the end of the line, you plead your crimes
But don't waste your breath, you're never gonna get away

Stampede ... Trampled to the ground
Stampede ... Flattened by the sound ... Hit you like a
Stampede ... Grind you in the stones
Stampede ... I'll pulverize your bones
