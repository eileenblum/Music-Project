Lights out forever, After the final war
Cities reduced to rubble as plant lipe settles the score
Bridges and tunnels collapsing, Towers no longer stand
A post traumatic Eden where roaches rule the land

No more civilization, Only shadows remain
No more death or pollution... Population zero

Welcome to the stone age, 200 Years after mankind
Welcome to the silent scream, The Earth has been reclaimed
Welcome to the stone age, 200 Years after mankind
A paradise for no one , And no one left to blame

Gone are the seven wonders, Pyramids only survive 
Paradise has been erased, Earth again will thrive
Continental glaciers scrape the planet clean
Removing any remnants of society

No more traffic and madness, No more nuclear power
No more new technology... Population zero

Welcome to the stone age, 200 Years after mankind
Welcome to the silent scream, The Earth has been reclaimed
Welcome to the wasteland, 200 Years after mankind
A paradise for no one , And no one left to blame
