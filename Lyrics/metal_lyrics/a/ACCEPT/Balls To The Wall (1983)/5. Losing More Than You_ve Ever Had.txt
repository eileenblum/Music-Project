Man - I know that you're out in the crowd
And I feel how you burn your hate in my soul
Itâs like Iâd have my hand in your coat
And feel the stainless steel of a sword

Years have gone by I know that she's left you
Before I passed by
I was collecting the dreams of her heart
And then she was reborn in my arms

Canât you see that you've lost her soul?
Sheâs been gone a long time ago

Man - it's been a long time since you've lost her heart
Yes - it's been a long time since you've lost her heart

Man you're dying
For what you've lost but never had
'Cause you've been losing
More than you have ever had

Man stop longing
For the girl you made so sad
Always losing for so long, so long

Man - why are you running blind for the past?
Why don't you try to understand?
When I found her she was dying
Trying to kill herself

Maybe you didn't know what you've done
But all you wanna do is wrong

Man - you came to kill, for someone who's gone
Man - it's been a long time since you've lost her heart

Man you're dying
For what you've lost but never had
'Cause you've been losing
More than you have ever had

Man stop longing
For the girl you made so sad
Always losing for so long

Man you're dying
For what you've lost but never had
'Cause you've been losing
More than you have ever had

Man stop longing
For the girl you made so sad
Always losing for so long
