Take the heat, stand the pressure, bearing a load beyond measure
Hold fast, and fight with fire, always walking the wire
Wake up, that's not the answer, it eats at your ilfe like a cancer
You want it all, can't fight the feeling
You'll never win 'cause the devil's dealing

Don't let it control you, It's dragging you down
Can't let them control you...

Don't carry the weight of the world on you shoulders
Carry the weight of the world all alone
Don't carry the weight of the world on you shoulders
Don't carry that weight, it will turn your heart to stone

On the news, another bombing, the feds can't stop global warming
Give now! Or children will die, more planes fall from the sky
Look out, floods and earthquakes, big corporations get tax breaks
The euro's down, and now there's brexit
The world is broke, and you can't fix it

Don't let it control you, It's dragging you down
Can't let them control you...

Don't carry the weight of the world on you shoulders
Carry the weight of the world all alone
Don't carry the weight of the world on you shoulders
Don't carry that weight, it will turn your heart to stone

There will be trails in your life, things you cannot control
There will be heartache and strife, don't let it tear out your soul

Don't carry the weight of the world on you shoulders
Carry the weight of the world all alone
Don't carry the weight of the world on you shoulders
Don't carry that weight, it will turn your heart to stone
