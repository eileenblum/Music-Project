Everybody's out to get me
This new world's trying to take me down
Break free but it won't let me
Right now there's only one way out

All fight for survival
In this apocalyptic maze
Caught in a downward spiral
Right through a cataclysmic blaze

All hell around you
Just a continual descent
Bedlam sorrounds you
It's the beginning of the end

It's the rise of chaos
The rats will rule this sinking ship
The rise of chaos
Surrender your souls and come to grips

No rules, laws or borders
Killing for guns and gasoline
This is the new world order
A blackened future unforeseen

All hell around you
Just a continual descent
Bedlam sorrounds you
It's the beginning of the end

It's the rise of chaos
The rats will rule this sinking ship
The rise of chaos
Surrender your souls and come to grips
