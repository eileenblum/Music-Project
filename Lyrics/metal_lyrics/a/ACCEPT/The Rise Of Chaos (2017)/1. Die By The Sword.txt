The world around us, frozen in terror
The balance of power, a thing of the past
Anything human has been abandoned
We're just drowning souls in a river of blood

What was built up in thousands of years
In just a moment is destroyed
Have we lost all compassion and love
Cast our souls into the void

If you live by the sword - you will die by the sword
If you live by the sword - you will die by the sword

We're sinking deeper in a world of darkness
It's kill or be killed from the day we are born
We're an evil seed from the soul of a serpent
An evil breed in a valley of thorns

What was built up in thousands of years
In just a moment is destroyed
Have we lost all compassion and love
Cast our souls into the void

If you live by the sword - you will die by the sword
If you live by the sword - you will die by the sword

Blood and vengeance, iron and bone
Fallen warriors, carved in stone

Crush this mindless desire for blood
And stop this endless crusade
Sonquer our instincts and lay down the steel
Save our children from the blade

If you live by the sword - you will die by the sword
If you live by the sword - you will die by the sword
