I need you like a prison term, likea a ball and chain
like a spike into my brain, you're a rope around my neck
You're a leech that won't let go, a bitch that just says no
And you leave me only wanting more

I've tried so hard to quit you, you're the monkey on my back
A life controlling money pit, you turn my whole world black

I need you... like a hole in the head
I need you... like a hole in the head

I need you like a rotting core, like a crippling disease
Like a whore that does not please, you're an evil parasite
You're a dog who's had his day, I've got to walk away
Before it all comes crashing down

You're a handfull of addiction, my antagonistic sin
You take it all, give nothing back, I can't let you win

I need you... like a hole in the head
I need you... like a hole in the head

You seduced me like a vampire, you're a curse to all mankind
A self-inflicted kiss of death, how could I be so blind

I need you... like a hole in the head
I need you... like a hole in the head
I need you... like a hole in the head
I need you... like a hole in the head
