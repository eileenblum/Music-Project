Here it comen straight down the barrel
Thru the bone right to the metal
I can feel it pierce my very soul
Who is the slave, who is the master
You'll never get what you're after
It'll steal your will and leave a burning hole

Who is the man in the mirror, bringer of pain tempting and terror
Sometimes he'll rock you to the core
Wanting to do just the right thing, all alone constantly fightingt
This is it, my internal war

There's two worlds colliding, right inside of me
Two worlds colliding, I'm my own worst enemy
There's two worlds colliding, and I'm watching helplessly
How two worlds colliding, collide inside of me

Same song, another rendition
Round the bend, head on collision
Give and take, endless compromise
Run away from the temptation
Straight ahead into frustration
Like a shot right between the eyes

There's two worlds colliding, right inside of me
Two worlds colliding, I'm my own worst enemy
There's two worlds colliding, and I'm watching helplessly
How two worlds colliding, collide inside of me

Am I going crazy, have I lost my mind
Insanity enslaves me, I'm starting to unwind

It's two worlds colliding, right inside of me
Two worlds colliding, I'm my own worst enemy
There's two worlds colliding, and I'm watching helplessly
How two worlds coulliding, collide inside of me
I'ts two worlds colliding, and I'm watching helplessly
Two worlds colliding, collide inside of me
