I've loved and lost and I've fought and won
Taken my time, been under the gun
I've come up short, taken too long
I've made mistakes, but I've never been wrong

Sometimes the pleasure isn't worth the pain it brings
But in the end l wouldn't change a thing

I've got no regrets ... No regrets

I've been at war and I've prayed for peace
I've done my time and I've been released
I've walked the line, been out on a ledge
I've hugged the curves and gone over the edge

I've seen fame, misfortune, love and pain
But one thing still remains the same

Nothing to forget ... no regrets
I'd do it all again

Sometimes the pleasure isn't worth the pain it brings
But in the end l wouldn't change a thing

I've got no regrets ... No regrets
Nothing to forget ... I've got no regrets
I'd do it all again, no regrets
