The time has come to visualize our greatest fears
Closer than we realize the end is near

The endangered flee from their homes you've seen the signs
Caring only for ourselves as the planet dies

Will we chance direction, will we become aware
And cure our own infection, or else beware

Is this the race to extinction... a race to the end
The race to extinction... the race to the end

Feeding greed our conservation's gone off track
Species die once they're gone they're not coming back

We can change this story, adapt and compromise
Balance is mandatory, open your eyes

Is this the race to extinction... a race to the end
The race to extinction... the race to the end

We can change this story, adapt and compromise
Balance is mandatory, open your eyes

This is the race to extinction... a race to the end
The race to extinction... the race to the end
