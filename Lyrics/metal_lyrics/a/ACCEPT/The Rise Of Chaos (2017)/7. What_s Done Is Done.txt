So you gave it all you had, things just didn't turn out
Like you thought they would
Yes you wanted it so bad, you'd do things different next time
If you only could

Don't look back it's just a shadow
Don't look back it's in the past

What is done is done... the bullet's left the gun
What is done is done when the bullet's left the gun
What is done is done, it's over, you can't unring the bell

You know the past is just a tale
Gone beneath the bridge but still you live in chains
Yes you've hammered out the nail
Now you've come to find that still the hole remains

Don't look back it's in the shadows
Don't look back just let it go

What is done is done... the bullet's left the gun
What is done is done when the bullet's left the gun
What is done is done, it's over, you can't unring the bell

What is done is done... the bullet's left the gun
What is done is done when the bullet's left the gun
What is done is done, it's over, you can't unring the bell

What is done is done... and now it's over
What's done is done, no you can't unring the bell
When the bullet's left the gun
