Running through the jungle
Way back in '78
Here's the story of the people's temple
And my great escape

Communing with a madman
The promise of Utopia
White nights suicide drills
Shades of things to come

He said,
"We're gonna mix it up.
Add the cyanide.
Then we'll drink it up.
You're gonna feel so fine."

I said,
"Don't drink the koolaid.
Don't taste the holy water.
Don't drink the koolaid.
No matter what the preacher, what the preacher says!"

The day of disaster struck
The murders did begin
His sheep drank it willingly
While mothers force fed their kin

33 escaped this hell
Some would call it fate
That's how i lived to tell the tale
About the day he mixed the grape

He said,
"We're gonna mix it up.
Add the cyanide.
You better drink it up.
You're gonna get so high."

Don't drink the koolaid.
Don't taste the holy water.
Don't drink the koolaid.
No matter what the preacher says!

Don't drink the koolaid.
Don't you down the holy water
Don't drink the koolaid.
Don't believe a word he say

Most of the congregation
900 dead
Jones found his own way out
A bullet to the head

Don't drink the koolaid.
Don't taste the holy water.
Don't drink the koolaid.
No matter what the preacher says!

Don't drink the koolaid.
I won't down your holy water
Don't drink the koolaid.
No matter what the preacher, what the preacher says!"
