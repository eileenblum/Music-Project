I was born in a cave, when stereo was all the rage
Gatefold vinyl and eight tracks ruled the world
Now there's flat screens in 3D
My cell phone's smanter than me
I can't keep up, my brains are beginning to burn

Update and download
There's no winning, just insanity
Update and download
The wheel keeps spinning, just set me free

I'm an analog man... analog man
I'm an analog man, trapped in a digital world
I am an analog man... analog man
An analog man, in a digital world

I keep surfing with the crowd, my information's on a cloud
My profile gets hacked almost everyday

Update and download
There's no winning, just insanity
Update and download
The wheel's still spinning, just let me be

I'm an analog man... analog man
I'm an analog man, trapped in a digital world
I am an analog man... analog man
just an old school son of a bitch... in this digital hell

Don't need no wifi, just want my hi-fi
Don't need no data plan
Computers crashing, I want to smash 'em
I just don' t understand

Update and download
There's no winning, just insanity
Update and download
Damn wheels still spinning, somebody set me free

Analog man... analog man
i'm an analog man, in a digital world
Analog man... analog man
I'm an analog man, dying in a digital world
