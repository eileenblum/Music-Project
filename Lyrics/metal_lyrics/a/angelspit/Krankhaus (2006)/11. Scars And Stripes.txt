Glass man strides over skulls
Ruins from the might
[indistinct mumbling]
Bones trampled under foot
Plots the counter strike

[2x]
No thanks for the gift
I blow back your shit
More violation and
I give you Scars and Stripes

Flesh stitched onto a frame
Makes the perfect suit
[indistinct mumbling]
Bomb strapped on Johnny's Back
Changes points of view

[CHORUS 2x]

[indistinct mumbling]
Blood in the sand
The roaches lay dead in the sand
The way in the sand is pathed with blood
I lied to you cause they told me too

[CHORUS 3x]
