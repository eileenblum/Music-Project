With this bass, I thee shake
Fingers to bow, manipulate
Stroke the string, I seduce
Blocking ears has no use
Twist the knob, turn up the pain
Sensual, to the extreme
carnal pleasure that will ring
here is the beat that will make you sin

Music to Ears (Bullet in cradle)
Chaos to Mind (Fingers on String)
Disease to Body (Lips on Barrel)
---BANG! (Make you Sin)

KRANK IT UP.

shaking walls, you feel ill
doing things against your will
Angel of light gave me a ring
now comes the noise that will make you sin

Wave my wand, Heaven breaks
A thousand groins, Loins to shake
carnal pleasure that will ring
here is the beat that will make you sin
