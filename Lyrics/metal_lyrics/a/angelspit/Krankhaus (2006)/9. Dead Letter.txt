Bless Jessica her tempest
I wheel a cage around you
they only see emptiness
in rot decay and horror
trash goddess soil your beauty
a foul embracing thumb screw
her fingers gouge divinely
as the old poisons the new

Nothing more to bleed
Nothing more to sow
Nothing more take
Nothing more will grow

A hangman's rope to bind you
their stories to deceive
One golden cloth to blind you
Served up for the naive

I spoke genius
I wrote a bible
dead white men could not have done it better
paint over it in black
Wrap it up in red tape
Address it to no-one and send it off as aâ¦

Dead letter I got a Dead letter

Sedit takes his crystal tool (hammer)
Drives the nail into skull
menstrual Roses field of Harlots
ripens the pleasure dolls
milk opiate enigma
Most vicious animal
Seed Lilith and her Dogma
The grafted cannibal

Nothing more to bleed
Nothing more to sow
Nothing more take
Nothing more will grow

A hangman's rope to bind you
their stories to deceive
One golden cloth to blind you
Served up for the naÃ¯ve
