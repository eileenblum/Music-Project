Brutal acts of sapiens leave Jehovah in disgust
creative acts of clever monkeys leaves the devil envious
Add up all of Hades' blessings Total all of heavens' curse
Let you know we've done it better Horrifically we did it worse

I am the 6th son of the 6th son of the 6th son I am the borged again son of war
Technology's child, daughter of rebellion, son of a bitch blossom of a whore
I am a god-killing virus, destruction with 8 arms, monster with seven severed heads
I am the son of mars, cleansed with infected blood, vile disease walking on 2 legs

The devil made me do it

Wreak Havoc (Right now right now RIOT NOW / Unleash hell)

dirty human gone insane Outshadows any part of Hell
Hope and horror mixed in blood a seething mass out of control
Our shining future in revolt while senile gods are in retreat
Left right wrong right Makes the heavens obsolete

I am beyond god I am human I am the razor blade on the communion tray
I am a freak in control not a control freak, I am the sheep that got away,
I am burning but never consumed, determined with nothing to lose
I am who I am who I am who I am who am I?

pretty girl pretty boy pretty insane pretty fucked up

Made real put into action, surgically atoned to perfection
Made flesh, son of bland, fuck your plans for redemption
