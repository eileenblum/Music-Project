[VERSE 1]
Ripe for the slaughter hiding in the naive
Meat racked on crucifix for the slaves
Drunk on the blood from a random Christ
House of the Skulls and the Church of Ice

[BUILD UP 1]
Pious vermin
Incarceration
Spineless minions
Flesh for the lions

[CHORUS]
Head Kult
Pigs revolt
Can't stop them groveling, let them rot

[VERSE 2]
Mind of a martyr, body of a child
Insane hallucinate suicide
Delusional salvation a pathetic farce
A higher seat in heaven closer to God's arse

[BUILD UP 2]
Mindless, hunger
Abide in rancor
The sheep confide
Heathen pesticide

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]
Nail one more angel head to your door
Pin another demon's arm to the wall
Death and knowledge versus bliss and bland
Which part of fuck off don't you understand?

[BUILD UP 3]
Pious vermin
Incarceration
Spineless minions
Flesh for the lions

[BUILD UP 4]
Mindless, hunger
Abide in rancor
The sheep confide
Heathen pesticide

[CHORUS]
