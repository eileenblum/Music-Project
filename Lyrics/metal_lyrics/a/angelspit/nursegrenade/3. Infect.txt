Teeth nailing
Their own tongues
Anger rising up in torn lungs
Rack, shackled
In torture
Severed veins reach up in rapture

Crawl into 
Nightfall
Foetuses in 
Plastic walls
Black tempest
The snake
Madly scraping 
Back the fake

Rip skin
Bind fist
Infect the mother
Flick the switch
Grind skull
Godâs shit
Infect the mother
Flick the switch

Slash, pretty
When she dreams
Stalking breath as leather screaming
Hail Mary
Horror beads
Eyes that cut through shadows seething

Choke frantic
Constrain
Manically scratch off the stain
Virgin daughters
In line
Marching off to matricide

Rip skin
Bind fist
Infect the mother
Flick the switch
Grind skull
Godâs shit
Infect the mother
Flick the switch

Choke frantic
Constrain
Manically scratch off the stain
Virgin daughters
In line
Marching off to matricide

Rip skin
Bind fist
Infect the mother
Flick the switch
Grind skull
Godâs shit
Infect the mother
Flick the switch
