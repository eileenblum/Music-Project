[VERSE 1]
I watch you liquid watching me
I smell you breathing heresy 
Your lucid semblance my deceit
Filled with disease I want your meat

[CHORUS]
I want your meat
(terror-murder-trouble-grinding-heathen-venom)

[VERSE 2]
Slip me inside you inside me
Grinding bone friction potency
Take me in under disappear
Tongue into skin I want your meat

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]
Push me down harder past my lips
Thrust the blade deeper through the rip
Tear off the crimson flow red wine
Teeth stained from you I want your meat

[CHORUS]

[CHANT]
I want
Your meat
Inside 
Make
Me complete

[VERSE 4]
I want you got me salivate
Inside your hard head on a plate
Meant to belong so sickly sweet
Knives and fuck you I want your meat

[CHORUS]
