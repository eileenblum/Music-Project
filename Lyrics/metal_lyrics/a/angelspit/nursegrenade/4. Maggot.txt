[VERSE 1]
Black office, dead paper
Sacrificial sky scraper
Gestate incubate dig your own grave
Grinding groveling you won't be saved

[VERSE 2]
No surname
Serial number
Bred to succeed and plunder
Cult of the worker bee deceived
Brainwash Karoshi breed

[CHORUS]
Eat it maggot

[VERSE 3]
Head devil, slave temple
Stuck inside the hate vessel
Mutate deviate churning bitter
Nitrate flagellate hell igniter
Pact writer, rank pity
Reaping execution money
Feasting at the boardroom alter
Carving up the slaughter

[CHORUS]

[CHANT]
Want it
Buy it
Use it
Fuck it

[CHORUS]
