For what we are about to do, may the Lord make us truly spiteful...

On a train, going down
Donât care if you go up in smoke
You think youâre better, prove it now
Trading currency for your ghost

Power of berserk compels you
Time for fraud and ruin

If God is money, I am the Devi, I am the Devil
If God is money, I am counterfeit, Youâve been had

Ever get the feeling youâve been ripped-off...how about right now?
Bite sizes oblivion, gorge yourself
Self imposed slavery, toss away the key, burn that tie
Annihilation, spoon fed, prescribed, amplified

Power of berserk compels you
Time for fraud and ruin

If God is money, I am the Devi, I am the Devil
If God is money, I am counterfeit, Youâve been had

Scapegoat, Strung up, Bankrupt, Forgotten

They say you burn plastic baby
But where do you cut the line
Itâs so hard to stand up baby
When you ainât got a spine

If God is money, I am the Devi, I am the Devil
If God is money, I am counterfeit, Youâve been had

The Great wrought, Youâve been swindled
you bought it, Lift up your scars !
