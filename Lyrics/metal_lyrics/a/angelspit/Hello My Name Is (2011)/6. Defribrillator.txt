Crystalline bunnies
Celebrity fixation
On the tiles of the girls' room
A furry crucifixion
Trivial play thing
And he likes your implants
Makinâ his moves
While holding your hair back

Smear it on; dance with fear
Charge it up; defibrillator...clear

Pop lolly spite dust
Defibrillator...clear!

Sweet chemical boy
Cold, stiff and jaded
Mad scientist joy
Made another belated
Our grand palace
Filled with all the pretties pretties pretties pretties
Where the most beautiful rooms
Are the most vacant

Let's go to la la la la; and get naked 
Buy me a diamond ponyÂ ; then get uncensored

Now all my bunny friends
Are pregnant or in prison
Dead or wearing suits
In rehabilitation
Kept some in deep freeze
Or buried in the garden
I like the road kill near
defibrillator...clear!

Smear it on; dance with fear
Charge it up; defibrillator...clear

Pop lolly spite dust
Defibrillator...clear!
