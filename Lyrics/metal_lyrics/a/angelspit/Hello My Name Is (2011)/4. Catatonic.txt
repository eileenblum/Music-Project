Full throttle to boredom; procrastination all the way
Very blasÃ©; so cute, indoctrinated and tame
All the Kingâs horse tranquiliser; and all the Kingâs shiny MDMA
Wonât put the thrill back in your life ; Oh the monotony

You make me numb, sliding down the throat of tiresome
Heartbeat synced to routine, you are catatonic

Better living through chemicals; Better living through fear
Better living through tattoos and amyl nitrate; Better living through a fringe and black hair
Frightened by shadows; lethargic dog turns the other cheek
Just give up...so bland; donât speak

You can not fly, sold your wings to cover rent
I watch you fall from that tiny box, you are catatonic

Oh, Sweet boy Iâm gunna let them eat you
Oh, sweet girl the routineâs gunna kill you

Voodoo lethargy, endless droning; Trading noise for perfection
Five empty chambers, one risk junky; my self distraction

You make me numb, sliding down the throat of tiresome
Heartbeat synced to routine, you are catatonic
You can not fly, sold your wings to cover rent
I watch you fall from that tiny box, you are catatonic

Oh, Sweet boy Iâm gunna let them eat you (Catatonic!)
Oh, sweet girl the routineâs gunna kill you (Catatonic!)
