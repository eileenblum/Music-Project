Locust, with name tags
This is US, verses YOU
No saliva, only spit
Now holy men worship mud

Corrosion is justice; suicide entertaining
Choose the option least painless; are you ready...?
BULLET PROOF BABY!

HELL YEAH! BULLET PROOF BABY!
HELL YEAH! BULLET PROOF BABY!

My repugnance, is my rite
âGood peopleâ kill, so they can survive
Welcome to Earth, turning paradise to hell
You're smashed to pieces held together with lies

What's on your mind; won't be your salvation
It's what you're lusting after; that's gunna make you...
...yeah it's gunna make you...; BULLET PROOF BABY!

HELL YEAH! BULLET PROOF BABY!
HELL YEAH! BULLET PROOF BABY!

Bullet proof, baby baby baby baby!

HELL YEAH! BULLET PROOF BABY!
HELL YEAH! BULLET PROOF BABY!

Dancing like fools as we go to Hell
But at least we're getting herded together
BULLET PROOF BABY!
