My ghost with a knife; gets the job done rightâ¦

I do not want make friends
I only want to make corpses
So fast on your silky toes
So hard to catch little muses
Keep biting your pillow
Soon you're gunna be a shining star
Just think about the money
You're only doing it for exposure

JailBait; Hey Hey Hey!
I got your scalpel; Givin' you a new look
JailBait; Hey Hey Hey!
Dissection Party; Swallow my hook

Your curse becomes apathy
The quiet and deadliest virus
My curse is coveting
Mortal sin gets between us
Don't let it stand in our way
The suicidal brush stroke cross seals the lie
Coax out the killer in you
You're only honest, when you're about to die

JailBait; Hey Hey Hey!
I got your scalpel; Givin' you a new look
JailBait; Hey Hey Hey!
Dissection Party; Swallow my hook

I know, you want it
By the way you're playing
But are you begging?
Or are you preying?

My ghost with a knife.....
My ghost with a knife; gets the job done right
My ghost with a knife; gets the job done right

JailBait; Hey Hey Hey!
I got your scalpel; Givin' you a new look
JailBait; Hey Hey Hey!
Dissection Party; Swallow my hook

You know you're gunna get it
by the way I'm playing
there's not use in begging
no hope in praying
