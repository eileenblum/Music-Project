When the servers have haemorrhaged
And the bandwidth is slashed
And the screaming binary is reduced to ash
You will know us

When the skyscrapers smoulder
And the lore is in smoke
And we're bathing in ruin 'coz it's your right not to vote
You will know us

Daddy buy me...

Where the code becomes curses
And systems become blasphemy
And the bit horses of troy unite on some dead guy's birthday
You will know us

You will know us
You will know us
You will know us
You will know us by our trail of static
Daddy buy me a pixel pony

Community becomes commodity
Agitate and add technology
Smashed surveillance 'coz I kicked in the lenses

Daddy buy me...

You will know us
You will know us
You will know us
You will know us by our trail of static
Daddy buy me a pixel pony
