Some will be drawn to violence
Others will swarm like bees
Weave in her hair
Like wolves to the bride
Wear her like clothes
Stitch closed their eyes
The hounds are closing in...she is open wide

Say ahhhh -- all my dreams have fire
Say ahhhh -- all my dreams have fire

Amour I forgive you
Amour let me kiss you
Amour let me place you
In my mouth piece by piece

Riding on high my stallion
Carving up clouds with his hooves
I hunt the wolves
Filled up with you
I spill them all
'Til dawn wash anew
Leaves glowing red in the first light (i smell you as you burn)

Say ahhhh -- all my dreams have fire (and iâm watching you burn)
Say ahhhh -- all my dreams have fire (paint my face black with your ash)

Amour i forgive you
Amour let me kiss you
Amour let me place you
In my mouth piece by piece
