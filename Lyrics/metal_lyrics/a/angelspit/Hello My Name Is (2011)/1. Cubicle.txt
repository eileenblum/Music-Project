This is where youâre conceived
This is where you are born
Here is where you will fail
You can build your box here
Hereâs your mind numbing job
This is where you will fall
This is the poison that you put into the water cooler
The shredder helps you dispose of their corpses

I love my cubicle, my little beige cubicle
I love my cubicle, my little padded cubicle
I love my cubicle, my little prison cubicle
Escalate and execute your brutal demise

Love you in your emails
Love you in your memorandums
Love you in your meetings
Loving your strategic plans
Love you in projected sales
Love you 'til your suit bleeds
Love you as you fall from the 83rd floor
and Love the shareholders who piss on your carnage

I love my cubicle, my little beige cubicle
I love my cubicle, my little padded cubicle
I love my cubicle, my little prison cubicle
Escalate and execute your brutal demise

No point, no desire
No choice, but to riot
No life, no hope
No vision, for the future
No sex, no parachutes
No escape, at least for you
No sharp instruments, no fun
No control, no fucking way

I love my cubicle, my little beige cubicle
I love my cubicle, my little padded cubicle
I love my cubicle, my little prison cubicle
Escalate and execute your brutal demise
