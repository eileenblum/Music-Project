Lair queen likes to prey
On lolly boys in their cage
Empress tease, pink and rats
Breaking hearts to the bank

Keep the car running
The only thing you're wanting, is
Cold hard cash 

Kaltes hartes bargeld 

Lynch mob love, broken dolls
Float to the top, of the bowel 
Taste in girls, young and smashed 
Perversion lies, dormant

Mother dear mother, gotta keep gunning for
Cold hard cash

Alice in vulgar land
Make the mascara bleed
Cry victim cry victim cry
God knows it sells CDs

All dancing, loud singing
Not realize they're just play things
Split open laid to waste
Sprayed across your rock star face

Glamour glamour road kill, all you want is... Cold hard cash
