I crushed up Ergot and made it a paste,
I spread it on the dollar bills.
Everyone who touched it,
Caught the disease,
fulluscious bits of landfill.
Its such an epidemic, 
Of self hate,
They wanted it so bad they could kill.
Everyone believing everything aint enough,
Trapping bodies on the treadmill.

Making Money,
All Things Shinny.
(If you do not spend, you are spent)
Bullet into Gun,
Barrell,
Lips Pout,
Finger in the ring,
Money into mouth.

The fist letter in Sydney is a dollar sign,
The fist symbol in London in a Pound.
Life aint yours till you fucked it away,
The dream aint yours till it burnt to the ground.
The city of Beauty is built on the dead,
The temple of Wealth is built on the poor.
Spent life just passing away,
Till you get off your belly and crawl.

Making Money,
All Things Shinny.
(If you do not spend, you are spent)
Bullet into Gun,
Barrell,
Lips Pout,
Finger in the ring,
Money into mouth.
Bullet into Gun,
Barrell,
Lips Pout,
Finger in the ring,
Money into mouth.

You are allowed to burn books, 
Hope can rot
Dreams go up in flames, 
That's okay.
We'll turn a blind eye if you burn a poor man,
But if you burn money,
Your gonna pay.
Anger is a currency,
Its sinicly mad,
Hatred's the new economy.
I am the inspiration of every wicked women,
Viciously corrupt,
Greed is monogamy.

All power, All truce, 
All knowing, All destroying,
All dying.
Not caring.

Making Money,
All Things Shinny.
Making Money,
All Things Shinny.
If you do not spend, you are spent.
Bullet into Gun,
Barrel,
Lips Pout,
Finger in the ring,
Money into mouth.
Bullet into Gun,
Barrell,
Lips Pout,
Finger in the ring,
Money into mouth.

Bullet into gun,
You are spent.
Barrel lips pout,
You are spent.
Finger in the ring,
If you do not spend, you are spent.
Money into mouth.
If you do not spend, you are spent.
