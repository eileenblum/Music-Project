He comes with wire, spikes and electrodes 
Tongs and speculum, hammer illegitimate
If he can not deflower in her cage
Then he's having her on a white plate

Devil eyes
Rakehell child
Rapscallion smile
Thief 

Fink, liar, heart manipulator
Bankrupt the boy just to soil the girl
Suave villain, sophisticated
Swindling miscreant malefactor

He could buy anything with his wallet
But his hunger can only be snatched
By unblessed hands
All that communion with cowards rubbed off

Snort deep and cut me a line of credit
Now you've got me playing your undignified stupid game

Fink, liar, heart manipulator
