The TV burned, nobody watched
The ratings sucked, so it got axed
We keep screaming, you ain't listening 
Take your chainsaw, wield it recklessly 

Crash made, built to fade, fuck the revolution! 
The money's real but the blood is fake, fuck the revolution!

The glossy mag, full of beauty
Story got cut, 'cos they were ugly
Martyrs of change, do not fight back
Round and a round, Martyrs of the new black

Crash made, built to fade, fuck the revolution! 
The money's real but the blood is fake, fuck the revolution!
Mediocre, bored to death, fuck the revolution!
The brave new apathy, fuck the revolution!

Then it got streamed, but some college kid
Sued the ISP, for breach of copyright
We keep screaming, you ain't listening 
Take your chainsaw, wield it recklessly
