My friends used to show off their tatts
Now they talk about filling their bank vault
Mellow is the new fad
Your life is fucked and it's all your fault
You used to be dangerous and fun
Before you got that mortgage
Killed by mediocrity, procrastination, blah blah...
Now you vote conservative

The people of influence are cynical and jaded
What hope for the new blood?
Habitat destruction, fake terrorism
We're all imploding under mass boredom
Sleeping generation can't embrace this shock
There's nothing left to embrace
I needed motivation
You sent a postcard that said "punk rock"
Well fuck you too

This is a marketing ploy
This is the new black
It's a publicity stunt
Relax kick back...

Tune in turn up recline practice being dead
This is channel hell

I hope this sledge hammer reminds you who you are
What the fuck happened?
Angry youth reduced to ultra-conservative nervous frightened children
It was supposed to be dangerous
It was supposed to be risque
Now it's cheap and mass produced
Now it's in a bargain bin... on sale

This is a marketing ploy
This is the new black
It's a publicity stunt
Relax kick back...

Tune in turn up recline practice being dead
This is channel hell

You only see the filth when you look for it
The scene sucks because you suck 
You killed it
You stood back and let it die...[5 times]
You stood back

This is a marketing ploy
This is the new black
It's a publicity stunt
Relax kick back...

Tune in turn up recline practice being dead
This is channel hell
