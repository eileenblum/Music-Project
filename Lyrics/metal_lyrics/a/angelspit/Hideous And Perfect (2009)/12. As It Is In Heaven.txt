The evil in these paws starts only when sung
Innocent, lifeless, hides the black intent
The panic of knowing you cannot run
My children cannot sleep
through the constant alarms of industry and machines
and constant toil of men...
The host and I are going insane
We're going insane

Pearls look best when soiled in cream and mud
Pretty things are there to be abused
Look their best when skinned and flayed alive
All those perfect perfect teeth removed

You said... a hole, that's what you is
You said... a figment of your expectations
What is heaven without the sabbath? 
I say
What is heaven without the sabbath?
What is heaven without the sabbath?
What is heaven without the sabbath? 
I say
What is heaven without the sabbath?
What is heaven without the sabbath?

Oh my children can't sleep
Through the night
Bodies burnt
Hair is singed, kissing flame
Healing hands sweat and oil never mix
The host and I sleep deprived and deranged

You said... don't blame him for all the slaughter he brings
You said... it's not his fault, even Jesus needs to sleep
