I don't know you, and I don't really care
Fixate on you, perfection, ideal
I'm so sorry, this is my guarantee
This will happen, worse and repeatedly

Sport for crows, patronize you for your own protection
Narrow-minded, redneck breeding program
Drown in her milk, waiting to be replaced
Years made vapor, lost and blown away

Fear of the dark
My mouth is full of ruin, I breathe it into you
Princess Chaos
I'll set the world on fire, I'm gunna start with you

(One) Spoilt child, alienation seeking missile
(More) Abuse, amends and back again
(Black) See life, through the eyes of a psycho
(Heart) I know where you live

(Casting darkness)
Deep inside your mind
(Screaming razors)
Resonating down your spine
(Wearing you down)
I'll haunt you where you sleep
(Vulnerable)
I'll make the guilt sting

Fear of the dark
I bathe the world in spite, it keeps you in your place
Growing nervous
Abused, humiliated, naked and ashamed
I will find you
My mouth is full of ruin, I breathe it into you
Princess Chaos
I'll set the world on fire, I'm gunna start with you

(One more breath for my last black heart)

I will not succumb to fear
I won't be intimidated
