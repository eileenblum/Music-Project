[VERSE 1]
I love the way you sweat when you lie
Hearing you beg always makes me smile
It turns me on when your honey starts to drip
As I put on the thumbscrews and tighten their grip

[BRIDGE 1]
Slip a little bamboo under your fingernails
One wrong answer and I send in the girl

[VERSE 2]
I say alien, you say salvation
I say government, you say Free Mason

White House clients come back for more and more and more

[CHORUS]
Kill kitty kill kitty kill claw up to the top hell born animal
Kill kitty kill kitty kill if you wanna see your pretty face on a dollar bill

You love my punishment, I love the glamour

My cup is full with sweet iniquity
And you thought I was a lady

[BRIDGE 4]
I am the fire, you need me to light the gas
You are the paper, I use you to wipe my

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 4]
Revenge bent psychos, senile and dangerous (Kill kitty)
Iâm on a mission, to be malicious (Kill kitty)
In God we trust, shit ainât fair (Kill kitty)
Itâs all a fraud, I donât care, I don't care
