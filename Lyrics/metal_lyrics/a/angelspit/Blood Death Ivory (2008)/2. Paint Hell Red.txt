[VERSE 1]
Come on pretty, play with me
Burn your hood, lay with me
My what big, teeth I have
Better to mix, fluids with

[VERSE 2]
Take the path of needles to him
Dirty girl feelinâ playful
Road to ruin pathed with pins
Hurried clumsy unstable

[CHORUS]
Beat at the head âtil you run red girl (pretty cannibal girl)
Wake Shieva, Iâm gunna paint hell red (little miss vex girl)
Beat at the head âtil you run red girl (night working blade girl)
Raise Hades, Iâm gunna paint hell red (razor lolly-pop girl)

[VERSE 3]
And the cat said
A slut is she, who eats the flesh
Drinks the blood, kaka in bed
Her play thing, soiled mess
Come on puppy, letâs play dead

[VERSE 4]
Smashed beauty tied up with rope
Nailed to the bed, beast seduced
Axe girl summons flies and maggots
And if youâre lucky, sheâll slash you

[CHORUS]

[CHANT]
Run red run red, run red run...

[VERSE 5]
I am horror that you warned of
I bring ruin face to face
Like Iâm not a child of God
I breathe revenge in this place

[CHORUS]
