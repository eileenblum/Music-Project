I'm a nice boy, a nice girl-next-door with a weapon
I am not human anymore
I traded my attitude and I traded my spine
Placid, weak as piss, wanna fuck in my car?
Start begging or you can scream, big shot - the choice is yours
Office carnage painted in bloody fright 
I'm a rabid rat in a salary-sacrificed convertible
Paint my boss in tar and set him alight

Grind, head down, tail up, define your purpose
Slave 'til you bleed and you are raw to the bone
Grind, head down, tail up, define your status
Slave 'til your wallet is full and your soul is gone

I'm Satan's secretary, I've covered my pen with chilli
I am gonna jam it up your colon
Turn me into a psycho time-bomb in a three-piece
Qu'est-ce que c'est with a nasty surprise, piss in your coffee

Don't call the help desk, 'cause they've got some big problems
Get up off your knees, God can't save you 'cause she's shopping
You can suck my cock, 'cause I'm tired of sucking yours
Ticking boxes, sting you up with your heels clicking
Burn like all the books in the town square
I donât care

Grind, head down, tail up, define your purpose
Slave 'til you bleed and you are raw to the bone
Grind, head down, tail up, define your status
Slave 'til your wallet is full and your soul is gone

Sheep like you need a slaughterhouse to go to
Just another micro-penis in a sports car

Breakfast becomes morning tea becomes lunch becomes 
Light snack becomes dinner time becomes dessert becomes
Midnight snack becomes five AM dump
One more day wasted, one more day closer to death

Grind, head down, tail up, define your purpose
Slave 'til you bleed and you are raw to the bone
Grind, head down, tail up, define your status
Slave 'til your wallet is full and your soul is gone

Sheep like you need a slaughterhouse to go to
Just another micro-penis in a sports car
