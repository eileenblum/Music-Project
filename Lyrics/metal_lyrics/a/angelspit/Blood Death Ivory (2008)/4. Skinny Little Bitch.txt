I overcame my bone structure and metabolism
I made myself engage in mind-numbing conversation
A fad diet left me with skin, bone and bitterness
Starved myself to a petite listening to repetitive electro shit

Prey to the fairies
She got her wish
Tied up and vacuous
She made the switch
Step into her carriage
Put on the ritz
Saliva laced malicious
Skinny little bitch singinâ
La la la la la

Hey, like my tats? Full sleeve, black and white
Two toned, no-onesâ home, in today, out tonight
Shiny happy die alone, vicious girls, plastic guys
You keep on scratching my back and Iâll scratch out your eyes

Membrane of bitterness
Words that rip
Topped off with a tongue with your name on itâs tip
Hatred for a skeleton
Ugly and rich
All wrapped up in a skinny little bitch singin'
La la la la la

He is the home coming queen, hip new breed of clichÃ©
Wears a tiara made of daggers and is in the top eight
You throw him a kiss he throws hi-voltage bouquets
If he canât have your affection then heâll thrive on your 

Hate to the fairies
he got his wish
Tied up and vacuous
He made the switch
Step into his carriage
Put on the ritz
Saliva laced malicious
Skinny little bitch singinâ
La la la la la
