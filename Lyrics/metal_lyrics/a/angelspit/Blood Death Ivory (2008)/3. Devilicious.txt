[VERSE 1]
In the name of addiction, cadaver love song
If your needin' a villain, baby Iâm your blonde
I either sour upon wings of light or slither down low
I am all things to all men, as long as you got the dough
Lets make a new myth out of you
Lets keep a souvenir, like your tattoo
My hands are heading south, getting vicious

[CHORUS]
Your body in my mouth
Devilicious

[VERSE 2]
In the name of the flesh, name of debauchery
Twisted majik and black lace tied all over me
Tonightâs menu covers a multitude of sin
Donât think I am an angel, just because I have wings
L-l-loving that organ baby, and not you
Watching your black lips turn pale blue
Paint on lacquer slide feeling ambitious

[CHORUS]

[CHANT 1]
Evil evil evil evil
I need a villain (a-ha)

[VERSE 3]
For love and devour, I want your sleaze
You bring out the self-loathing, in me
Sexual digestion runth into thine cup
Thereâs a God in us all, and sheâs so fucked up
Donât think with your head, think with your meat
I like to get naked before I eat
Using your flesh to make your faÃ§ade pure malicious

[CHORUS]

[CHANT 2]
Evil evil evil evil
I need a villain (a-ha)
