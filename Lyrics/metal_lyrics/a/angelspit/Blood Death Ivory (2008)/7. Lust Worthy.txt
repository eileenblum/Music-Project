[VERSE 1]
High school popularity, rears up itâs ugly head again but with
Pseudo-intellectual, degrees in, politics and wanking
Jet black, matching uniforms, personality, image is everything
Reinforce, gender stereotypes, in the new, hip alternative setting

[CHORUS]
Beautiful, dead attack, all that glitters, is just black
Crash Dolly burn with me
Like on TV
Get dirty, boy on me
So lust worthy

[VERSE 2]
Lip gloss, all she wears, false lashes, straight red hair
Short skirt, very short skirt, her thoughts count, only when she canât fight back
Pervert, self inflicted rash, while you are, masturbating with your tongue
You are, only listening, âcause of all the hype she attracts

[CHORUS]

[CHANT]
Fuck them for selling it
Fuck you for buying it
Fuck me for making it
Fuck it all

[VERSE 3]
I hate, therefore I ainât, I am nothing but my own disease
Expired, used-by-date gone, rotten core, but I am still for sale
Disgrace tragedy breeds the best trashy magazine success
You will watch me fall, the truth is you are next

[CHORUS]
