[VERSE 1]
I love my employment, and I love my picket fence
Love my little car, and I love the repayments
I pray this every night, give myself as sacrifice
Brand me as a liar, donât believe a word I say
Where thereâs a need thereâll be greed, prolls are gunna bleed
Blood death donât forget the ivory
Company used and abused, puppies on a lead
We are homo-machinery

[BRIDGE 1]
Red hands burn the Reichstag again
Choice of the new European centurion

[CHORUS]
The machine, we build high
Keeps you fed, keeps you dry
The machine, sponsored lie
Youâre misled, eat shit die

[VERSE 2]
Piglet in a suit, tolerate worker abuse
Corporate backed research, sponsored facts on news reports
Donât do delegate, union or confederate
Money for misery, global market slavery
Fist-full of bills buying pills, got to stay alert
Grey suits as far as the eye can see
Mind full of greed he will cheat
Lost all sense of self worth
He becomes homo-machinery

[BRIDGE 2]
Ease the discomfort of a suicidal grind
Choice of the new American centurian

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 3]
White collar virgin whores, lubricate with sweat and oil
Big green Trojan horse, lures them in and keeps them fake
Money is evilâs root, so is corporate personhood
Evilâs temple has a name, calls itself the world bank
Cogs grind the land in, demand âcause our wants are high
Chew up all of the greenery
Crush up another white, collar thereâs a hundred more inline
Theyâre just homo-machinery

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 4]
Red hands burn the Reichstag again
Choice of the new European centurian
Ease the discomfort of a suicidal grind
Choice of the new American centurion
