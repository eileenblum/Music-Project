[VERSE 1]
Angry, very motherfucking angry
Over and over and over and over again 
Same set list, same beat, same tempo,
Same 1980's compilation

[VERSE 2]
No play unless I get it for free
Vixens in black by the dozen lining up to see me
Donât need mixing gotta keep my right hand free
Love this club spread simplex 1, 2, 3

[VERSE 3]
Lift up your bony little fists on high!
Scratch my anger into your eyes
Wake the dead, itâs time to die!
Bang bang silver hammer

[CHORUS]
Go for the
Jugular! (teeth sinking into throat)

[VERSE 4]
Deal me a card in the suicide club
Falls from grace with a wallet full of hate
Disease of the soul called apathy
Revolt! Hereâs your change, have a nice day

[VERSE 5]
Daddy gave you twin-decks for your birthday
Hands clapping, cameras snapping spin that wheel DJ
No skill, dance a little, just press play
Spit venom, talk much, loves to complain

[VERSE 6]
Dish up a 3 course fuck you platter
Faster, harder, louder, motherfucker
Placebo more effective when they taste bitter
When diplomacy fails

[CHORUS]

[VERSE 7]
Back then when you would pretend to care
Popping pills, hitting eject, sucking lots ofâ¦yeah
Glamour junky and a shiny affair
Sucked down the vortex leaving a smear of hair

[VERSE 8]
Lift up your bony little fists on high!
Scratch my anger into your eyes
Wake the dead, itâs time to die!
Bang bang silver hammer go for the
Dish up a 3 course fuck you platter
Faster, harder, louder, motherfucker
Placebos more effective when they taste bitter
When diplomacy fails

[CHORUS]
