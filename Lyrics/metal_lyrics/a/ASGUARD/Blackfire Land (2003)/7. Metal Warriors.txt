[Music &amp; Lyrics by Manowar)

Every one of us has heard the call
Brothers of true metal proud and standing tall
We know the power within us has brought us to this hall
there's magic in the metal there's magic in us all
Heavy metal
Or no metal at all
Whimps and posers.
Leave the hall.
Heavy metal
Or no metal at all
Whimps and posers
Go on get out Leave the hall.
Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please.
Got to make it louder. all men play on ten
If you're not in to metal, you are not my friend.
Heavy metal
Or no metal at all
Whimps and posers.
Leave the hall.
Heavy metal or no metal at all
Whimps and posers
I said Leave the hall.
Now the world must listen to our decree
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please.
Got to make it louder. all men play on ten
If you're not in to metal, you are not my friend.
There's metal in the air, tonite can you hear it Call?
If you ain't got the the balls, to take
If you can Leave the hall.
Heavy metal
Or no metal at all
Whimps and posers. Leave the hall.
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers I said leave the hall.
