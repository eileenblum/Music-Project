[Music by A. Afonchenko &amp; A. Tselobenok, Lyrics by A. Afonchenko]

Doors for you were closed.
The darkness
Has shrouded consciousness.
There is no sense in the real world
All has died around
Already for a long time
That no sense in those dreams.

But how many time you were
At the purpose and each time was
Time was broken downwards.
Time was broken downwards.

My hate and sorrow
Today and tomorrow
Will grow every day
All is stronger and stronger
Fury will become blind,
And with blood
Will fill my eyes
There, where there is a hatred
- there there is no
Place for mind

Who thought about spiritual much,
Eventually was mad.
Sing to me about hot breath
Of death of the forgotten tombs.

My hate and sorrow
Today and tomorrow
Will grow every day
All is stronger and stronger
Fury will become blind,
And with blood
Will fill my eyes
There, where there is a hatred
- there there is no
Place for mind

Ideas drill from within.
Him to not
Find my name in a succession
Of necrologies.

Time is pulled together
In a spiral of my dreams.
All this truly was.
All this will be again.

My sight - my message of hatred
My life - my immortality

My truth - my temple of freedom
My death - a seal of my dreams

Fury, anger, ruthlessness - my rescue
Belief in rescue and the truth - my death

The closed doors - a way to reflection
Clearness of mind will replace dreams.

Blood, the flesh, the dismembered bodies
To not throw out realities from dreams

Who saw
Who saw though time,

Will remember
Remember always

Who already
Already died
- will not
Die never

Who was
Not born yet
Will be
Dead always

You will not recollect death, not life, it is not angry
Dream replaces a reality, but only the death will replace dream.

My hate and sorrow
Today and tomorrow
Will grow every day
All is stronger and stronger
Fury will become blind,
And with blood
Will fill my eyes
There, where there is a hatred
- there there is no
Place for mind.
