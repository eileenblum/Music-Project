[Music by A. Afonchenko &amp; A. Tselobenok, Lyrics by A. Afonchenko]

My sight is shrouded in death.
All shadows of the last years.
I see them,
I wait for them.
I do not have return to the past

My visions are gloomy
My eyes are empty. My world
Behind a shadow of death,
Me in him to not rescue

I was given birth here,
But now I the prisoner.
Here all is destroyed
That hundreds years created.
On revival there is no
On revival there is no hope.

From ashes
In ashes
All life
All life was scattered.
This land
Is empty,
Everywhere only fire.

And souls of dead dreams.
BLACK FIRE LAND - my old land.
Everything,
That remained
Everything, that remained to us.

BLACK FIRE LAND - My pain
BLACK FIRE LAND - My fear
BLACK FIRE LAND - My Grief
BLACK FIRE LAND - My death
BLACK FIRE LAND - My dream
BLACK FIRE LAND - My sorrow
