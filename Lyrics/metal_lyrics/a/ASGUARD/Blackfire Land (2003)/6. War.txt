[Music by A. Krotov &amp; A. Tselobenok, Lyrics by A. Krotov &amp; A. Afonchenko]

The fever affects each mind,
Evil breaks into the souls
War reign in the world
No place for peace now
Give me shield and sword
I will burn them in the fire
No more war.
We shall not have been waiting long
We shall clean the world of all
Of all unauthorized wretched person
Peace is that a main off all reasons.

Give me shield and sword
I will burn them in the fire
No more war.
Darkness and blackness is over the world
I don't know, what's happening to it
And so as to take care of the earth
Burn you sword in the fire
Give me shield and sword
I will burn them in the fire
No more war.
