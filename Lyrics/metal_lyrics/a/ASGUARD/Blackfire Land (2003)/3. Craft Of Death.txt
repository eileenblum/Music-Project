[Music by A. Afonchenko &amp; A. Tselobenok, Lyrics by A. Afonchenko]

The night has come.
I close my eyes again.
My fear
I was overcome my fear of death.

Night has come.
I close my eyes again.
I was overcome my fear of death.
My fear

The life has gone.
I see the same dream
My fear
I was overcome my fear of death.
Night has come.
I close my eyes again.
I was overcome my fear of death.
My fear
Learn to die and you will know how correctly to live
Not having learned to live, you will not learn to die.
