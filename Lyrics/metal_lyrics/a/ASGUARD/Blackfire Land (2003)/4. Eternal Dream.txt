[Music by A. Afonchenko &amp; A. Tselobenok, Lyrics by A. Afonchenko]

It's again a dream. It's again a life.
But is it life. Or is it fantasy,
Wish to turn desirable in to reality?
There is no that night, wonderful
Night which I idolized so much,
I see only thickening of the darkness
Of gloom which is approaching.

Oh, what is it?
That is it goes to
Take me forever, because I'm not
The first and far from the last
Who has believed in all this.
It has come. It enjoins me.
I collected my thoughts, wishes, dream
For the first time in my life
And the voice of my...

The voice of my internal being,
The voice of my soul,
The splash of emotions
Thoughts prayed for mercy, rest.
All my being resisted, saying him...

But I Can't I don't want. I won't.
But nobody heard my entreaty
The voice of my soul sank into the night
And The answer was only a terrible
Cold roar of dark silent, ruthless night,
The roar of an alien mind
YOU MUST.
