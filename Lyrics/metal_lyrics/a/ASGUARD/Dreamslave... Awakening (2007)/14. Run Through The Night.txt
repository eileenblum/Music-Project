[originally by Accept]After all we've done - our past is gone
Future is no more what it used to be
When we have been more sensible
And our world was safe
I'm living in this empty room
A room without a door

I run through the night
I can't handle my fears
I run through the night
Cannot hide my tears
I run through the night

I'm longing for a smile - dying for a little hope
Can't you see my pain
I'm with you but - still alone

At times when we're more sensible
I need you more and more
I am living in this empty room
A room without a door

I run through the night
I can't handle my fears
I run through the night
Cannot hide my tears
I run through the night - I run through the night
