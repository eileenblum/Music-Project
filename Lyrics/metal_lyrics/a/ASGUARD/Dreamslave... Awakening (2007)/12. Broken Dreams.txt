Some years passed after his birth.
But he remembered everything.
The baby couldn't forget anything.
He remember cicadas chirping
that moonlight night,
he remembered the moon road
in the darkness,
he remembered the alluring light,
which didn't leave his soul in peace,
which was calling, attracting him.

He remembered everything,
he kept in mind even that was just going to happen.
He couldn't have forgotten that!
he would remember it forever he would never forget the charm of that night,
of the moon, of the dream.
Everything had gone.
Everything was over.
but once he would probably see that moonlight again,
that moon road, that illusion, that life, that DREAM.
