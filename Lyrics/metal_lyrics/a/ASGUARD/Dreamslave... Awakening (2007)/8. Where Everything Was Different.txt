He heard someone was fracturing the boards...
He couldn't remember for how long he hadn't seen it.
It was light! Nobody but him
could realize what that light meant
It was Light. And there was some figure there.
It was him! He came to save him.
It was him. It was a stranger!
The stranger didn't say a word,
but his motions produced some sound.

He had been lying so many years
in cold and damp ground, foreign ground,
which had almost swallowed him alive
just like those miserable slaves of their own dreams.
They were still lying in the ground,
greedy, insatiable of new lives.

But now he is free,
as has never been in his life.
He is free.
But it was so difficult to become free.
But where is he? Where is the stranger?
He has disappeared.
He said only one phrase and vanished.
Now it's high time to go where everything began,
where everything was different.
