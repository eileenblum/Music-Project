Don't be a slave.
Only this way
You will be able
To put an end
To the sufferings
Throw down the chain of birth
And death.
But pain penetrated into me
While I was thinking, retired into myself.
How little I was left to live...

Hurry up before this body
Perishes and disappears,
Before diseases and old age
Fall upon me,
Hurry up,
There is no time
For inaction.

And thinking
Over the nature
Of transient
Forms of being.
I achieved my liberation
As the words
Of Creator
Sounded for me.
