Under the mask of death
Is the mask of dream
Under the mask of dream
Is the mask of lie
Under the mask of lie
Is the mask of death

Dream is after life.
Lie comes after dream
Death comes after lie
Dark is after death
Fear's after dark
And it's just the beginning...
NO!...

The truth is that...
You thought you had won and remained alone, and were the master of everything
But there isn't a place for the good in the world.
Evil and hell is here.

They all have betrayed you.
Why save them from crucifixion?
Hammer in a nail into consciousness of their mind.
By pushing them into the abyss
Of death, evil and misery
