All my life has passed before my eyes.
All disappointments,
Mistakes and all,
That will never come true.
I am going away forever,
All is left behind,
All that occurred,
All that was supposed to have happened
But will never be.

Oh, if someone had only known
How painfully and offensively
Was leaving something that hadn't been finished,
Something that you had left inside of yourself
Something that could have been realized but will never happen
And will leave with you forever.

But every man has a hope,
Light which glimmers,
On which you lay all
That you didn't manage
Or didn't have time to do

But if you are deprived of the last hope,
Last desire, last request,
That is what death is -
Failure of hope, thoughts, ideas
Failure of the last that you have -
Belief in hopeful future,
In a happy life.
