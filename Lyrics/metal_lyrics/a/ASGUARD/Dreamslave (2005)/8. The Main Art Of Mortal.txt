Isn't it the main art
Of mortal - being the master
And ruling everything,
You see...

It is managing destinies,
Taking lives,
And giving existence
Which depends
Only on you!
Breaking your laws in any way
Must result in punishment of death!

As only you are the master,
And power - the greatest thing
In this world - belongs just to you.
There is only you!
And this is the way it must be,
Only this way!

Only you send death,
Only you leave life,
Only you pass
A final verdict,
Only you decide,
How many items there should
Be on the debtor list.
