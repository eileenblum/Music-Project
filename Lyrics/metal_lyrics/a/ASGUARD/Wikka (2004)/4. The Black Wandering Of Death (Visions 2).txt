[Music by A. Afonchenko&amp; A. Tselobenok, lyrics by A. Afonchenko]

Fear stay in your eyes
You was unhappy, fighting with death.
And what Fear No! Death No!
Will I die But why

To leave everything,
That was closed to you.
Now everything will be stoped.
I am not afraid of coming of the night,
But I wish the day will stay.

Eyes pray for escape
Why are these tears?
They will never be seen.
But there is no you, already.
Is it all beauty of life?
But now you are free.
Will be life. You can't.
Make or steal spaces.
They are in you.

You are that person here,
Who don t exist anywhere.

You are the master in the power of life,
In your power. Didn t you dream about it?
You was banished by those,
For whom you believed, for whom you count to be
On your side.
