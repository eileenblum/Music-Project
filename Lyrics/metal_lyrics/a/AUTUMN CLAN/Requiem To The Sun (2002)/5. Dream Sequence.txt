Yeah! You can change your twisted mind
and you can change it all the time
Please don't touch my face
Don't let me dream again

Your darkest nightmare's coming true
and everything you see is blue
I can touch your skin
and let you dream again

I try to take you higher
I try to touch the flame
There's only one desire that let me live and live again
Don't let it go on and on and on - just let me dream again

You can wash your sins away
You can change your evil ways

Your soul is dark, your eyes are blue
Your mind's still seeking for the truth
