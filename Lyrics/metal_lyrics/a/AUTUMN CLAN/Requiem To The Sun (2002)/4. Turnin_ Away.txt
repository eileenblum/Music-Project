Love is like a dream
you fall asleep and then you scream
I am switched on, I feel alive
but it's like love - unsatisfied

Roses turn black
I'm turnin' away in my bed

Life is like a dream
it explodes - it's never seen
I'm feeling high just like a god
and in my head - it's all messed up

I'm turnin' away
I'm blowin' away
I'm fadin' away
