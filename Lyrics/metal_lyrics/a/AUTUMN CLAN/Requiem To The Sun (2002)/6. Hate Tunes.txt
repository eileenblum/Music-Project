There is a wish deep in my mind
burning like a flame so high
the fire in my soul will degenerate me

You make me hate myself
loving me, hating me
get in to see my world
I'm loving her, hating her

The dark emotions within me
burning in my soul so deep
the fire in my soul will degenerate me

I'm trying to embrace you
but you're so far away
I'm trying to caress you
no, there's nothing left to say
