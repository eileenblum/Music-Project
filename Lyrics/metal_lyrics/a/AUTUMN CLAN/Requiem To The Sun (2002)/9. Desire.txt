I come inside, turn off the light
give me your hands, I'll hold you tight
and now it's time to make you mine
I want you - I'm haunting you

The feelings you know, are feelings to grow
decide - desire
there's a feeling inside of me, I can't hide within me
decide - desire

The moon shines bright, the night's alive
still enter the room, you sleep inside
I create your dreams, I erase your mind
I want you - I'm haunting you

I haunt you here in the night, and I want to hold you tight
I roam around here without light, but you don't let me inside
I fly above you in the night, and I want to bring you light
I roam around here without light, but you don't let me inside
