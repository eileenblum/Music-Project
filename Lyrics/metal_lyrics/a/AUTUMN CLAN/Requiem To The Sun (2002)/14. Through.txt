There's a time beyond the time,
a place beyond a place
I fall asleep, I'm in too deep
and I feel nothing

I surrender all the feelings
and all things above
I remember - saved by sex
and punished with love

... but nothing gets me through and through
just like you
I wanna come and play my part
loving starts, loving stops

My heart is broken, all things are spoken
nothing satisfies me
I try to run, I try to stop it
I try to believe

I look at the cross, I see your skin
I feel your suffering
I look in your eyes, I'm watching your tears
would you cry again?
