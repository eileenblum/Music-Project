I don't believe in love
and you are the reason
I'm alone to resign
love's only a season

What doesn't kill me, makes me stronger
you're not the woman, to invent love with

Life is the search for the truth
will love be the answer?
The womens' heart is the sea
and I am the cancer

Some words should remain unspoken
once used they do more harm than good
