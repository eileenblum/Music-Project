Cold wind blows through the snow
ice is freezin' there - so cold
when I look into your eyes
darkness I can find

When I watch the time passing by
I know you're here, I know you're mine
try to believe, I try to create
but I can't understand ...

... your symphony of sadness

Restless I roam through the night
try to find a place to die
I will never love someone
my heart is gone

I fly above myself watching me
from a distant place deep within me
try to believe, I try to create
but I can't understand ...
