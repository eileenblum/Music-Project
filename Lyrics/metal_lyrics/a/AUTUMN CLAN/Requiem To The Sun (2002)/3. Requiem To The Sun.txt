Now it's 6. 66 a. m.
I wanna gettin' me out of this place
before I'm going insane

I will turn my head aside the sun
let the darkness in ... (and overcome)
I will turn my eyes away from you
never gonna change my point of view

Holding me, corroding me, changing me, re-arranging me

You can bring me guitars, you can bring me a bottle of wine
You can bring me some cigarrettes but I won't smoke this time
