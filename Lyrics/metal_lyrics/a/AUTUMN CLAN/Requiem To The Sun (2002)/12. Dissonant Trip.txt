Change your visions, throw the old away
leave me in silence
trip away and take me now

it's down below

Change your feelings, don't fool yourself
feel the desire
and turn away, so take me now

you feel so down - low

Another push now, I try to keep control
I won't sleep tonight
and turn away, so take me now
