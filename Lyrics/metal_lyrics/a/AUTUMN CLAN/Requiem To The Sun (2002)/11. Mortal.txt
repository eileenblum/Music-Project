I feel so old and I'm afraid that noone will save me
I feel so cold and I'm alone and noone can help me
I feel so hollow I'm alone - my angel is crying
I feel so stoned, I'm still alive - but you make me sober

would you ever go away
would you ever let me stay
would you go away

I am so mortal, I'm alone - my angel is dying
I feel so stoned, now I'm alive - but you make sober

If you ever go away
In my dreams I'll wait and pray
Turn my night into a day
