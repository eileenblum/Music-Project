You come to me
crucify, whatever I will be
and your soul is filled with darkness
and your face is filled with hate
you try to punish me
stop it, you're killing me

I'm going deeper

Your smile is gone
your lips so cold
and you fill the air with blackness
and you fill my soul with grief
your eyes are cutting like two knives
your look is killing me

I'm roaming through the mist in the night
searching for a place to hide
I fall into this hollow
but you will never follow ... oh no
