In the garden of Eden, I try to search for you
In the garden of Eden, I am loving you - forever in love with you

Still searching around, I can't hear any sound
silence ist the loudest tone
Your eyes are dark and cold, your face looks white and old
your heart is made of stone

I try to run, I have to crawl, I search for love

I wanna hold your hand, I don't want to pretend
Life is like a game
All day long I think of things like love and passion
Love's the brightest flame

I can't escape
but it's been to late
