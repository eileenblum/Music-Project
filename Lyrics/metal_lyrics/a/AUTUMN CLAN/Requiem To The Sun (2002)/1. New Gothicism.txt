You're the one I adore
but I can't find you anymore
I'm hunting you there in the night
in the forrest you will hide

I wanna find you sleepin'
my search will never end
I wanna join you dreamin'
come on and take my hand

In the misty morning
I'm waitin' at your door
under the moonlight
gothic dreams you adore

Runnin' deeper in the night
behind a wall of dreams you hide
I find the place where you sleep
I am inside you and you weep

In the misty morning
I want you to be my whore
under the moonlight
gothic dreams you adore
