As you close your eyes
(I die a little more inside)
This time a second chance is out of reach
(You're lying through your teeth)
The flood has rinsed us
clean for the last time. Farewell my mistress
Bless your heart, I'm no cut throat
Get down for the firing squad
Has the antidote
If God will rip you from my hands
I'd never let go. Am I to follow this path
I know so little about?
Or should I risk it all? Bearing open arms
Is this the end or is this where it all begins?
I've found myself trembling
