Savor this before it turns into a nightmare
keep the lights off incase we see too much
(I'm dying here)
the mirror image of your face
is just a dying smile
Cupid must have hit me right on target
Swallow your emotions
they mean nothing to me
(nothing at all)
Wake up were gonna party tonight
wake up
Yeah shes with me
yeah shes with me
(yeah shes with me)
the only thing that looks better
than that dress on you is me
Savor this before it turns into a nightmare
keep the lights off incase we see too much
(I'm dying here)
the mirror image of your face
is just a dying smile
Cupid must have hit me right on target
She talks like angel
but she dances like the plauge
Suddenly my ears start to ring
the sound of nothing kills me
your screaming starts to all drown out
you should have seen the mess we made
Tell the town I'm coming home
warn the town I'm coming home
