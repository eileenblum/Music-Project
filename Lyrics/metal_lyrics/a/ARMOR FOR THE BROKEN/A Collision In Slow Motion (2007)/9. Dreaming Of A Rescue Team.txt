This was all an act
A poor example of deception
Now Iâm falling backwards
Off this bridge you built

The clocks are all telling us itâs our time
(Itâs our time)
Itâs our time to shine
To face these fears with our
Heads against the walls
(Were all vultures)

Now as the blood pumps
Through your veins
We sit silently alone for an awhile
Before it become contagious

Come on baby Iâm like a disease

Were sleeping under burning skies
Just to pass the time
Now youâve got me in a chokehold
And you wonât let go

(Let go)
Steady now, Iâll hold you hand
Keep you head above the water
(Consuming)
Its consuming, itâs over
Weâve lost all hope, I can see halos

Weâll dance to the sound of
One thousand sirens to put us too sleep

Were sleeping under burning skies
Just to pass the time
