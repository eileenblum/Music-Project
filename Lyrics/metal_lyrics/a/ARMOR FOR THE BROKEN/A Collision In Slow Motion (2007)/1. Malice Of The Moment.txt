I've withered away to these gray skies
a smile held captive for too long
I'm forever searching
for the words that neglect me
will you neglect me? fight the image
this is the march of the fallen
the serpents can't even touch us now
we've lost all sight of direction
we're reaching relief
while asperation crowds our thoughts
crawl out of the shadows
you coward show us the image
you've tried to create
your voice drowned out, it's gone
you were so contridicting
this is the march of the fallen
the serpents can't even touch us now
we've lost all sight of direction
we're reaching relief
while asperation crowds our thoughts
(I'll carry it out, we'll take this day by day)
the light starts to tremble
and I'm growing weary
I'll reach imperfection
I'll reach imperfection
we've opened up inside, it's not too late
we'll let our mind take us to a better place
and when we arrive it will be
The Malice Of The Moment
the end of the road is a vague
distance away
you may find this overwhelming
we all get lost sometimes
there is no easier way out
with no end in mind, take this all
take this day by day
oh, please don't loose sight of direction
you'll see the light one day
resist the hopeless
we've fallen asleep this time
the light starts to tremble
and I'm growing weary
I'll reach imperfection
I'll reach imperfection Right Now...
