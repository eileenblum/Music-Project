There's nothing left of me
So come on in and enjoy the party
There's nothing left of me so Iâll exit quietly
We've been treading along this beaten path
For far too long, Itâs not our first time
singing this nauseous song
Last chance to shoot him. First impressions
are always second guessed
But Iâd march towards that romantic tune
Playing in the background of the gun fire
Letâs start with anxiety on our mind
Hide your guns and knifes
Tell the orchestra to keep on playing
We're inhaling smoke with an iron lung
Sing this requiem
as if it was to be the last song
Sung by man, until birthed again
I think I know you all to well
Looks like Iâm in line for the guillotine
At least I look rather charming this time
This accident has left me reckless
And now I'm holding on breathless
Three doctors next to me
The syringes can call this a party
Three doctors next to me
Iâll go out silently, You fled the scene
with guilt breathing on your neck
The witches watched you from every angle
Where do you go when
Everyone knows your name
Where do you go when everyone knows
Thereâs a hungry wolf in the crowd
and heâs looking at you
