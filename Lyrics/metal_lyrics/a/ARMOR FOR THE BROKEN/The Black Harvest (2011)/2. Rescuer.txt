Tear me down, stimulate my mind
Wake me up from this motionless sleep

The passion has died
But the pain still remains
To push it's way through these veins
Kicked down to the lowest point

I feel the dirt beneath my teeth
A pile of blood, sweat, tears and grief

I've seen all I can see
You're eyes they beg me not too leave
Not quite a standstill 
But we're moving slowly

There is no love
No shame 
To reap your name
These idle hands will keep me still

I feel the dirt beneath my teeth
A pile of blood, sweat, tears and grief

I've seen all I can see
You're eyes they beg me not too leave
Not quite a standstill 
But we're moving slowly
Towards the end
Sink into me
Learn to love what we've lost
Sink into me

After all is said and done
These scars were never meant to heal
There's no hope for us

We've all seen the coldest suns
The ending scene
I pace circles around this hole
Your eyes they beg me not to leave
We're not quiet at a standstill
We're not quiet anything
We're moving slowly towards the end
Sink into me

Learn to love 
Learn to love what we've lost
Sink into me
