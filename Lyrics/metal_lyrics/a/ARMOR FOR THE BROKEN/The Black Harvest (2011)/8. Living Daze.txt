When will the warmth comfort me and pull me in
The past two years I've felt so cold in this place

I'm shooting glances sharp as glass as I retrace all my steps There's nowhere left to go from this just blank stares and emptiness

I swore I'd never look back I held my head up high and looked away From all the hate you caused from all the pain you brought and left to stay

The rain is beating down on us as I retrace all my thoughts Oh I've seen this once before I've see you come undone

Our voices are slowly drowing out by the sounds of misdirection we've been let down Call out for saviors there's no hope for the lost Our heroes have failed us now we've all been let down
