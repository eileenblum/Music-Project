[feat. Trevor Wentworth (OUR LAST NIGHT)]

I feel tortured I feel worn down 
through these dark days 
by every breath I take by every footstep
I'm losing sight these night grow longer and longer 
as shame fills my lungs

And I feel so close
I think I'll dive right in
I don't feel close to home
I'm about too
Dive right in, dive right in

To everything you said you'd never come back
After all these years
You still will disappoint me

I clench my fucking teeth when you call my name
Oh, you can't destroy me
I'm everything you couldn't fucking be

I've never felt so empty and alone
With you standing by my side
As my shadow grows larger my guts begin to rot
I'm becoming nothing

And I feel so close
I think I'll dive right in
I don't feel close to home
I'm about too
Dive right in, dive right in
