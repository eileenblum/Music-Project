Take these hands that you call pain
but don't show your teeth
breathe mankind breathe
cover up your eyes so the sun won't burn them up
hit the deck the water is seeping through the floor
I think We've lost our touch
promise me you'll make it out alive
if lying is choking then they've choked us from the start
breathe mankind breathe
