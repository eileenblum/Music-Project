I'll stretch my arms as far as it takes
To take you back
I know you're out there
Waiting for me to disappear
to disintegrate
I take it back to get this through to you
This is my last chance
I know you're out there
wait for me to disappear
to disintegrate
with your guts spilled out
you look more beautiful than I ever expected
