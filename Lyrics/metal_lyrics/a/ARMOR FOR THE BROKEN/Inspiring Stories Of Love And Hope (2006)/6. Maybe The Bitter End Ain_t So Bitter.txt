So what are the last words you will say
and will it have any meaning
can I tear you to pieces now
can I strip you of the truth
so what are the last words you will say
did they mean anything at all
so I scratch at the open wounds
I practically tear my skin off
but only to be more open to you
I see your not hiding anymore
from what consumes you

Inspiring Stories Of Hope And Love
what they hid us
from where's her pulse
where's her pulse
all we need is a miracle

so I scratch at the open wounds
I practically tear my skin off
but only to be more open to you
I see your not hiding anymore
from what consumes you

these arms pull her closer
maybe the bitter end
ain't so bitter

so I scratch at the open wounds
I practically tear my skin off
but only to be more open to you
I see your not hiding anymore
from what consumes you
