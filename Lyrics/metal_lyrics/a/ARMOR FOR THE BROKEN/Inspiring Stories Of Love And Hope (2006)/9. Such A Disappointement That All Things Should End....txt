As the director
castes his crew
I can finally see you here
all lights out
man your stations
the curtains fold
don't forget your lines
I can't breathe with you so close to me
I can't breathe with you so close to me

as we hit the stage lights are dim
the audience mutters
under their breath
all lights out man your stations
the curtains fold
don't forget your lines

man the lights
the cast are in our hands
where's the noose
where's the hangman
the greatest actor of them all
has taken a fall he's taken a...
OH MY GOD!
the show must go on
where's the lovers line of lies

get off the stage
this is an embarrassment to you
and all the good people
