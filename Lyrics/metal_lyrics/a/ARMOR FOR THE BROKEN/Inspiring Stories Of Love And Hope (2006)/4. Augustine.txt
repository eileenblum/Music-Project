The queen begs
to still be appreciated
while the empire
stabs her in the back
everybody just relax
blood drips off her dress
onto the ballroom floor
where people dance

I spill out upon the floor
as the walls are closing in
Augustine
we're at our necks again
Augustine
we're next again
Augustine... Augustine... Augustine... [X3]

out in the court yard
the dead roses seem to
bleed and whisper [X2]

I spill out upon the floor
as the walls are closing in
Augustine
we're at our necks again
Augustine
we're next again
Augustine... Augustine... Augustine...
