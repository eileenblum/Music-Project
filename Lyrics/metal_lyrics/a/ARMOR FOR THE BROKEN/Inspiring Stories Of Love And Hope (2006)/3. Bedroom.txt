Let's take this up a notch
real-life miracles
i know it's not the worst day of our lives
am I charming
I really need to know
a gentleman always show up a little late
is this worth it
my conscious is screaming no
it's my choice to decide I just hope its the right one

your subtle story
ends with a dagger in my heart
your pinned up smile never fooled me from the start

am I charming
I really need to know

is this worth it
my conscious is screaming no
