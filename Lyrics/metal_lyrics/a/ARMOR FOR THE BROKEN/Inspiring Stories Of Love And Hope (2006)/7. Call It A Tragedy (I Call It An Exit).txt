Wait with me
down by the lake
the water's so beautiful
and so is her face
kill this trend
baby we'll play pretend we're invisible again your word cut like broken glass
the pain it hurts
but it doesn't last
I'll bottle it up
and save it for the next one

Wait with me
down by the lake
the water's so beautiful
and so is her face
kill this trend
baby we'll play pretend we're invisible again

don't worry nothing's safe
just try your hardest not to scream
don't worry nothing's safe
just try your hardest not to scream too loud

Wait with me
down by the lake
the water's so beautiful
and so is her face
kill this trend
baby we'll play pretend we're invisible again [X2]
