Goodbyes don't last forever
goodnights are so much better
if I can't explain these things to her will you be my words
if I loose my balance can you be my feet
don't let me fall
while the blood rushes to my head

I'm unconscious take my hand
and take me away
now as my body grows weak and cold
white lights up ahead
white lights
its our escape
we're leaving with or without you
if you hold us down
we'll cut the rope

while the blood rushes to my head
I'm unconscious take my hand
and take me away
now as my body grows weak and cold
white lights up ahead
white lights
its our escape

its our escape we're leaving with or without you
its our escape
goodbye
