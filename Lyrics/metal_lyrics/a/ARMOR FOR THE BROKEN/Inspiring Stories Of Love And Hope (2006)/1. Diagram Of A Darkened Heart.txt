We'll dance like the night is endless
(and these days are forever)
Our shadows we've chased to this corner
(have dripped dry tonight)

I don't know how to say this
I think I'm suffocating
I don't know how to say this
I think I'm finally failing

Love is more my job than it is your business
We'll keep this tied up girl
We won't discuss this

We'll keep this tied up girl

We'll dance like the night is endless
(and these days are forever)
Our shadows we've chased to this corner
(have dripped dry tonight)

I don't know how to say this
I think I'm suffocating
I don't know how to say this
I think I'm finally failing

This is the diagram
(of a darkened heart)

All I see is white
What is this mess?
Where am I?
what have you done?
