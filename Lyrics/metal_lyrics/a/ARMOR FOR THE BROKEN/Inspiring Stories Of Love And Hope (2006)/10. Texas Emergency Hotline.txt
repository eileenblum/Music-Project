Pull the covers back over our heads
the sun is shining through
blaring down on you
at this rate we're better off dead
at this rate we're better off dead
take it slow while breathing in
don't gasp they'll probably hear you
the air here is much too thin
run faster they're right behind us
run faster they're right behind us
as we douse our selves
until we light up in fire
I hope it fits your desire
we'll scratch these walls
until they hit the floor
this place looks the same
as when I left it before

we got you down to a basic
we got you down to a basic
pardon me good sir
while I gouge out my eyes
nothing against her
but I can't stand her smile
as the blood drips off my cheek
tell your wife please do not shriek
I'm sorry for the trouble
I won't stay

as we douse our selves
until we light up in fire
I hope it fits your desire
we'll scratch these walls
until they hit the floor
this place looks the same
as when I left it before
