Turning night into day, day into night
Drifting in floods, no bottom beneath

Sinister the waves arround extend
Shatter on black rocks of neverland

Initiating the fusion of sun and moon
Snow falls in summer, dry rain on my skin

Sinister the waves arround extend
Shatter on black rocks of neverland

Strange are the times
When shadows haunt my mind
Total Soul Eclipse
I've lost myself again... and again...

Confusing emotions inside my head
All life's seems to be born dead
