Seperate
Affiliate
Integrate into mind's reformation
Dominate
Manipulate
And create a new age of innocence

Infiltrate
Elaborate
Build a state for a lost generation
Last Decade
Soon to Fade
All seems desperate, but it's never too late

Out of the ashes of heaven and hell
we stand close, side by side.
From the deepest depths we shall
rise into the blazing light.

Liberate
Evaluate
Deprecate all the rules of the father
Regenerate
All once made
And degrade the leaders of ascendence

Concentrate
Associate
Interpret metaphors and stigmata
Call of fate
Love &amp; Hate
Celebrate the new beginning

Integrate into mind's reformation
Create a new age of innocence
Build a state for a lost generation
All seems desperate, but it's never too late
Deprecate all the rules of the father
Degrade leaders of ascendence
Interpret metaphors and stigmata
Celebrate the new beginning.

All we see, when barriers fade away: yet unseen territory
All we know: the rising from below leads us into infinity
