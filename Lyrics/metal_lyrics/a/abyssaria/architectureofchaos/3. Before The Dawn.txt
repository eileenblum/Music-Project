"We all are just moments dissolving in the dust
and we all shall be prepared for the time before the dawn..."

Creations of sickness, insane crowd of fools
Lack of conscience, defiled at heart
Emptiness and madness - unborn child will die
Hopelessness and sadness - humankind's decay

And when the wind blows stronger than before
And rain swamps the saving shore
We fall asleep for the last time since we've been born
A final breath before the dawn

Dominant leaders absorbing human minds,
Terrified failures are made to obey blind
Lifelessness and badness - in the eyes of death
Defencelessness and deadness - mankind's final breath
