The treasure of life is so hard to find
Scores of decades filled with grief
Hear the elegies of humankind
Years of pain, an exhausting decease

Crawling in filth and contamination
Earth's entity a poetry
written with words of deepest grey
Drowning in tears caused by soul's desperation
Life means death means charity
in this world of depravity

Nature's virginity has been taken
The storm blows us away

A ruined world we leave behind
All life will soon decay
The incessant fall of mankind
This is judgement day

After our last breathe on earth
In floods we'll fade away

Now we'll die the hardest death,
now we will surrender,
suffer for our sins,
bleed for our deeds,
die for retaliation
