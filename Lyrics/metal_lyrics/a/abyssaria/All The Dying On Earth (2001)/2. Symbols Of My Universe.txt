The infinite ways of my universe
It took me time to interpret the

Signs, symbols and signs, the meaning of the

Stars will guide me through the depth's of live
Until the end I will follow the

Signs, symbols and signs, evolving my mind

Millions of paths to my universe
have to be passed by choosing the

Signs, symbols and signs, the meaning of the

Ways I have chosen to exist my live
Until death I am guided by the

Signs, symbols and signs, evolving my mind

"On my spiritual journey during thousand of years
I have passed the darkest ages.
Centuries ruled by sick minds, the withering of humankind.
But sometimes I saw the shimmer of salvation.
I have seen both - the beauty and the cruelty, the darkness...
...and the light!"
