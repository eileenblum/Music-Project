There's no difference between night and day
Without sun or moon I move
The only candles that enlight my way
Are the blazing flames of you

You are the flames of the everlasting fire
You are the wings, the wings that take me higher
You are the fire, you are the light
You are the key to my salvation
The final day of this sorrow inside
This is the way to my last destination

All insanity that led me astray
My deepest darkest thoughts came true
The only hope that enlights my way
My last believe are you
