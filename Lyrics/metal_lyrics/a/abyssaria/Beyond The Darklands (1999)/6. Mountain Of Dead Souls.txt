As I wander through the night
In shelter of the nocturnal sphere
Full moon shines on my pale skin
Surrounded by the Immortal's screams

Virgin of the night
Under your spell I crawl
Craving for liberation
Longing for eternal darkness

Shine on me, star of the damned
And light my path to find my inner self
Beyond the mortal existence
My body - dead, my soul - alive

Voices of the night
They will guide my way
Through this mystic atmosphere
I feel the spirit of immortality

"And he went to the mountain of dead souls
where he could rest and find new strength
where he could die in peace
die in peace apart the world of fools

He raised his head up to the sky
the cold wind caresses his face
and he thought about the time
when freedom ruled this world..."

Oh great beloved mother
They took your grace away
They snatch away your heart
Slowly they drown your life's light

I tried to keep them away from you
I tried to defend your kingdom
I tried to fight against their vanity
But I failed...
