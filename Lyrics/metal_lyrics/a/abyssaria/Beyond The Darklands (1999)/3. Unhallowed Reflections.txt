The prophecy of their tongues
The announcement of their words
Break away from their embrace

Follow you, follow not them
Follow the way of your mind and soul

Threatened by their believe
Manipulated by their lies
Stop their longing to enslave

I left everything behind
I created my own kingdom
I am the force from below

Follow you and follow not them
Break away from their embrace

Follow the way of your mind and soul
Stop their longing to enslace

Unhallowed Reflections
leading me through the night
Their hateful rejection
show the darkness in their "light"
