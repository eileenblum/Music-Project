Pain - all I feel is burning pain
I raise from the clear snowy ground
Slowly the dense fog is dissolving
Reeling I see a vast scenery of ice
and snow

All I see is dark
Dead landscapes
Befrosted paths

This cold ominous place seems timeless
The icy winds are carrying howling screams
There's no daylight - only moon shines on the surface
My pale body is sinking back into the snow

And all I see is dark
Dead landscapes
Befrosted paths
I see no light

Captured in this fields of death
Alone in snowy mountain glens
Grey threatening clouds cover the sky
Above my head the ravens fly

Captured in this fields of death
Alone in snowy mountain glens
There's no way out of this gloomy land
My life seems coming to its end...

The spirits will guide me
To eternal life and might
To the kingdom of fire
To my yearned salvation

And I raise my hands
Like burning wings
I will leave this world
I will fly

And I fly...
