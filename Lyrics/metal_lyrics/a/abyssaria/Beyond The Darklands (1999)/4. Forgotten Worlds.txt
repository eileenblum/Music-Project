Coldness let me perceive my breath
I look around but norhing is here
Nothing but extensive blackfields
A threatened atmosphere lies over the land
where am I?

I awake in forgotten worlds
In which I walked in every dream
And I walk through silent fields
There is no hope - there is no fear

I only hear the ground grating under me
I run - but where? There - a light
I see the angel of death is saving me
But I know I will never come back
this is my world!
