Our paradise has turned to hell
The gods have forsaken us
The end has come Indeed it has
Lay down with death our time has passed

Eruption has begun
Swiftly the blue is lost
The sky is dark Forever dark
Unending night the seas shall part

With floods of ore poured down on the land
Escape is gone as there grows a

Tree of fire with limbs of flame
Poison vapor suffocating
Falling pumice from above
cast down by the lord of fire Vulcan

Vulcan

Black snow falling down Buried in ashes now
Black snow coming down lament those from the towns

one time, two times, we will suffer
and those that last stone forever more

three times, the last we will suffer
and those that last stone forever more

Don't Look into my eyes, you will see the hope that died
Don't look into our eyes we cast back our demise

Eruption is Complete
Slowly the blue returns
Sky still dark but lighter now
Looming clouds unhurriedly part
