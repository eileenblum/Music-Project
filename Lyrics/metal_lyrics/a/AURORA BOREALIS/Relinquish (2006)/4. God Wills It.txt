Rise, Knights
Cut down all before us, Leave no one alive
Unto the holy city we all shall ride

The vow we have spoken, retake the sacred land
Our sins will be forgiven by gods command

Christ, Our lord and savior
Christ, For him we kill
Christ, Lead us to him In the name of
Christ, Denounce the Muslim
Christ, Its him we kill
Christ, Make a covenant and the blood will spill

God wills it, God wills it

We don't need a crown of gold upon the head
We adopt the crown made from thorns embedded
through the skin thus we will fulfill
The changing of the guard let the siege impel

The trebuchet breaches holes throughout the wall
The Christian army is in before nightfall

The funeral pyres resemble pyramids
made from countless dead as their marching
Ankle deep in blood beheading all the ones
on the path that leads to the temple of Solomon

A war of the cross, many there will be
A war of the cross never ending
