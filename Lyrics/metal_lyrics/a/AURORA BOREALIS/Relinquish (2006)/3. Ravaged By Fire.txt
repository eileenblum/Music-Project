Circus Maximus must go down first
While I feel a bliss as flames scorch the earth
From my own hands I cast the blaze
and make the Christians take the blame

Atop my throne I bid you all farewell
Now prepare yourselves for ten days of hell

Watch me feed the fire, for my desire
Watch me feed the fire, Blazing higher

I justify the lives, my legacy will survive
Advocate the lies, and watch religion die

They say, With joy I, They say, I played as it burned
With flame, With flame I, With flame, I burned it to the ground
For greed, For greed I, For greed, I blame the ones of faith
They say, With joy I, They say, I played as it burned

My own palace must go down next
So that a golden one can resurrect
A city of magnificence
Will be built the blood the cost

I control the death like a god
No, no mercy Felt, the ungod
Feel the power held, A demigod
Look up to me, the Pa god

Help me feed the fire, For my desire
Help me feed the fire, Blazing higher

The destruction is now complete
Looking down at the Misery
Would I do it all again?
Just pass my Bow and listen in
