The slaughter has released the sacrificial offering to
Appease the appetite of the one that will bring the light

This Dedication of Tenochtitlan will
Be a gift up to the gods, a gift of twenty two thousand hearts

Bring up victim one, tie him down here, this day has just begun
Sharpen up the blade, with scriptures near, the priest will now convey a

prayer up to his god and ask favor upon his
Clergy and his lands with a beating heart in hand

Plunging the dagger deep, A body falls
Another up the steps to heed the call

Ten thousand carcasses, the bodies fall
Our day is but half done, decimate the thrall

Prepare out kettle for the many deceased
Oh come all ye faithful, tonight we feast

We Offer blood to the idols
If not diseased the rest we eat

Reserve three limbs of the captor's victims
Display the heads at the temple pyramids

We offer blood to the idols
our lord is pleased thus now we eat

The battlefield is where these poor souls come from
The altar is where they will be forgotten

Another Falls, Another Falls, Another Falls, they fall

Covered in blood all now are in eternal sleep
Cadaverous depths now reaching twenty thousand deep

Another Falls, Another Falls, Another Falls, they fall
