This Day, Will be a day of great judgment
This Day will be a day of, Holy Bloodshed
This day, Will be a day of Mortal Combat
This day I say to all who come to view internecine

Let the games begin, let the games begin

Welcome all My faction fill this coliseum

Let the games begin, let the games begin

Anticipation builds challenger unknown
Will our paladin meet his fate and be dethroned
When this great engagement is finally said and done
One man will walk mighty the other lies in blood

Call on the slaves event one is done
So that we may continue the celebration
Make ready at once prepare the stadium
Erect the crosses for the executions

Crucifixion is the punishment
Through the wrists and feet the nails went
These men are dead now each and every one
To the next event Bring in the Christians

Once let free from the holding cage
They all gather to kneel down and pray
At once the prayers become quickly ceased
A cry is heard, the lions have been released

Claws tear through bone, Excoriation
Appetites Grow, Mutilation

This Day, has been a day of great judgment
This Day has been day of, Holy Bloodshed
This day, has been a day of Mortal Combat
This day I say to all who witness the internecine

This days at end, to all I extend
Invitation in, to make sure you attend

When the games begin, when the games begin
Well meet again when the games begin, let the games begin
