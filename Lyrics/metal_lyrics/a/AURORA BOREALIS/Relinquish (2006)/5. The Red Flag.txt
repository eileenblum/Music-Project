Mired craft is now in sight
With hunted ones
The treasure that it yields
Will be ours by the first streaks of dawn

The Flag in which we fly
It shows no threat
Allies on the sea
clandestine, deception is kept

The battle soon to be

Windswept oceans guide the way
Riches and ancient gold await
Close the division once again
The distance between us and them

Prepare the cannons, ready the men
Leave no survivors, my last command

Up, raise the red flag
The signal for a massacre
Now, split the silence
Explosion of the blast is heard from artillery

Fires raging on all decks
From the torch
Fitful glow of burning ships
and singeing flesh fill the gusting air

Closer drop the planks
Prepare to board
Ransack that you will
Bloodthirsty, No mercy they kill

Let the battle rage

Windswept oceans guide the way
Riches and ancient gold await
Savage we take what is ours
Bodies will wash to the shore

Asphyxiation from the waves, Welcome to your wet grave

Windswept oceans guide the way
Riches and ancient gold await
No man shall be left alive
Allow none to survive

This flag means malice, this flag brings pain
This flag means horror it will remain
A flag of loathing, a flag of hate
Meet your Kreator it seals your fate

Up, raise the red flag
The signal for a massacre
Now, another in sight
Cast up the sail to conquer another enemy
