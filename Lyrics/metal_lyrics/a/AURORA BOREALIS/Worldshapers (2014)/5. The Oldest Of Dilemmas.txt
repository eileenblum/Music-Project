Deep within the human consciousness lies a need for a deeper meaning
Existence we live, relinquish then we die
Succumb to the darkness and eventual demise

Why do we worship the ones?
Is this a passage to a true heaven?
This is the oldest of dilemmas,
This is the only one dilemma

If this is a second consciousness, will there exist a second soul for
Existence to live, relinquish and die
Transverse dimensions and then live eternal lives
Mortal desires
All things expire
Continuation of false religion
Existence to live, relinquish and die
Transverse dimensions and then live eternal lives

Why do we worship the ones?
Is this a passage to a true heaven?
This is the oldest of dilemmas,
This is the only one dilemma

They are only the ones that made you, not to be called by invocation
If the mandate differed at all or simply changed just one percent
We would not be, would not exist
We would not breathe, would not persist
Do not confuse your makers for gods
The blue prints were clearly already laid
The laws insist that a creator sculpted this and all with divineness
Do not confuse your makers for gods
The blue prints were clearly already laid
Mortal desires
All things expire
Continuation of false religion
Can they be blamed for not knowing this?
If there does lie a soul within them
Forgiveness it shall live, no mercy it shall die
Succumb to the darkness and perpetual demise

Why do we worship the ones?
Is this a passage to a true heaven?
This is the oldest of dilemmas,
This is the only one dilemma

Deep within the human consciousness lies a need for a deeper meaning
