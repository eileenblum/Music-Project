Silent war from afar, merciless primordial
Unaware of origin, veiled assaults commence
Fighting to hold on to some life
Clandestine shadowed ones engineer and carry on
With all existence hanging in the balance of their hopeless cries

Ailing effects scattered all across the globe
Unburied bodies lying by the millions
Revocation of the human race is looming
Lachrymosial inclinations now they care
Clinging to any hope sanguine they persist and resist 
Bathed in ruination, determined to go on as they mourn
Face to face with this elimination for ordained,
Now mankind align bringing their great minds together
Unyielding, unrelenting
For every cure humans create
The ancients deliver a new strain
DNA is rapid changing cancer stricken with decay 
Now without an atmosphere nothing to repel UV rays
After just a generation mostly gone and now breathless
The few that continue on will none too soon cease to exist

Silent war from afar, merciless primordial
Unaware of origin, veiled assaults commence
Fighting to hold on to some life
Clandestine shadowed ones engineer and carry on
With all existence hanging in the balance of their hopeless cries

All the years passing on unaware, oblivious
The judgment handed down from the Creator
Who gave life this time, this place in this dimension
The successful termination now is over
Children of the stars dwell alone once more
A new project now is devised, redesign and revise 
Change the DNA encoding this attempt, try again
Extract the genes vital for hatred and acrimony,
Persecute many to ascertain the knowledge ones seek
Unyielding, unrelenting 
All that remains is the emptiness of
Judgment handed down from the creators

Silent war, merciless killing 
Silent war, exterminating 
Clandestine shadowed ones engineer and carry on
