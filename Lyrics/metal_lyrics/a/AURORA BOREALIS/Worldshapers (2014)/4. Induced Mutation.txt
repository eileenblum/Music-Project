With this new life, some were removed, experiments on extracted few
Far away from the new Eden, deep in shadows horror begins

Genetic mutation, they alter DNA
Genetic evolution is underway

With cruel intentions malformities, the creation of monstrosities

Captives - No where to run, Enslaved they shall become
Captives - Extreme conditions, Enslaved for observation

Induced mutation the suffering echoes, Cellular radiation altering genetic code

With cruel intentions malformities, the creation of monstrosities

Just like humans the conscience is thin, malefic nature comes from within
Far so far beyond the stars, the omnipotent one watches on
We are the products of replication, revised from total devastation
Saviors to some, others not, some live their lives void of thought
Some live in bliss while others grieve, some are complete while others need
We are the products of replication, revised from total devastation

Captives - No where to run, Enslaved they shall become

Induced mutation the suffering echoes, Cellular radiation altering genetic code
Just like humans the conscience is thin, malefic nature comes from within
With cruel intentions malformities the creation of monstrosities

Deep so deep beyond the depths, elsewhere in this multiverse
Far so far beyond the stars the omnipotent one watches on
