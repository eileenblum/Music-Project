This is the way they choose to live
Gluttons for for wealth and greed, this they won't forgive
This is the way they choose to die
Further continuance will be denied

Life is a test that we all must go through
Years that go by we cannot just undo
Everyday is one day you're closer to your last
With your first breath the decay commences
Arrows of time they run only one way
Moments that pass used to evaluate
They have given thousands of years to right the wrong
Yet the annihilation continues on and on

Mining the planet to its very core
Polluting oceans across every shore
No respect for the life that you have 
Suicidal tendencies abound

The resources once plentiful are depleted
She has nothing left to give

This is the way they choose to live
Gluttons for for wealth and greed, this they won't forgive
This is the way they choose to die
Further continuance will be denied

Into the night sky potential awaits
Technology leading the search to locate
A new planet to exploit
A new race to consume and destroy
Genomic seti now brings them the proof, 
DNA message encoded is true
This could have been welcome knowledge
Instead it seals their fate
This can no longer continue now
Only death just awaits

Mining the planet to its very core
Polluting oceans across every shore
No respect for the life that you have 
Elimination own your own behalf.
