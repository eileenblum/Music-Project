On beams of light we can look into the past
But we cannot see the inexorable future that lies ahead
Mankind cannot escape their predetermined destiny
Migration, annihilation as they move
Devastation, ravenous and more profuse
Culmination, war is in them like they breathe
Confirmation, that they see us just as disease
They see a plague and disease
Analysis of synthesis knowledge; we can not coexist
This is what they, what they call human nature?
Knowledge; we can not coexist
Watching from above,
They're watching from above
Watching from above
They lie in wait for centuries as millennia pass holding destinies
They're watching from above,
Watching from above.
We war, we lie, we kill for greed
We lust, envy feel wrath and breed
Anathema of the multiverse, condemnation is what is deserved
Proficient in destruction
The instinct of aggression runs through your core extolling the eminence of these
Savage impulses, the dispositions for cruelty are innate
These traits they do abhor

Acclimation, adaptation as they move
Temptation, cravings cannot be defused

Conformation, war is in them like they breathe
Denunciation from the ones who oversee
From the ones who oversee

When the emotions overcome reason, instincts we act upon

This is what they, what they call human nature?
Knowledge; we can not coexist
Watching from Above,
They're watching from above
Watching from above,
They're watching from above
They lie in wait for centuries as millennia pass holding destinies
They're watching from above
We war, we lie, we kill for greed
We lust, envy feel wrath and breed
Anathema of the multiverse, condemnation is what is deserved
Proficient in destruction
Watching from above
