Seers of time, primordial lives
Hypocrites are the archaic killing when it is deemed right to
So much just like the humans, justified by ignorance of all 
Indefectible, not so; flawed are the ones that should know 
We live, we breathe, we exist, not forever
We die, we fade, we perish, cease so quickly
There is one watching over, 
Designer of everything in this universe and the next one
Their existence shall be judged as well
Reverence was lost crowning themselves while condemning others
Even they cannot escape the decay and entropy that come
To everything over time, nothing is ever immune
Time is not on your side and time is not your friend
Time will catch and devour you, it will always win
A star cannot shine forever, it ends and fades into obscurity
The laws of the universe can, can only be changed by the one true Creator 
Consciousness will slip away
There will be no more yesterdays
We live, we breathe, we exist, not forever
We die, we fade, we perish, cease so quickly
We are all just stargazers mesmerized by the clockworks
Of the heavens and the universe that we are a part of
Under a dimming sun waiting to be judged, we will be judged
This may not be your last day but it will surely come
We can never go back or undo what has been done
We will be judged, born of the stars and to the stars returned
