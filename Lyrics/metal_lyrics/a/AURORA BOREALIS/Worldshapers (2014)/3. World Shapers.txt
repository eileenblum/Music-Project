Over seers directive evolution, what once took us millions of years
Accelerated they aid our growth, facilitated now they evoke

World Shapers, Terraform 
A virgin planet transformed
World Shapers, 
A new home uncontaminated like our own

Untainted world here we all shall dwell untrodden lands unseen they impel
Contrived convent fabricated for constituents they will restore

A fertile laboratory made for life to excel but most will still fail

Over Seers observing this afar will watch the primitives from a distant star
Accelerated aided our growth, facilitated but not provoke

World Shapers, Terraform 
A virgin planet transformed
World Shapers, 
A new home uncontaminated like our own

Untainted world here we all shall dwell untrodden lands unseen they impel
Contrived convent fabricated for constituents they will restore

Lifespans last thousands of years ageless time seems infinite,
but their demise is imminent

From ghost hearts they made our flesh 
With flesh reawoke us 
They awoke us.

Over seers directive evolution, what once took us millions of years
Accelerated they aid our growth, facilitated now they evoke

World Shapers, Terraform 
A virgin planet transformed
World Shapers, 
A new home uncontaminated like our own

Derivatives of our ancestors a new chapter in the annals of time
Unknowing of what was our old lives, endure again yet few shall survive, 
A few shall survive
