Transmission neglection 
They would not have been brought back if it was not for the failure to disclose the truth
In their final masterwork they chose to be perceived differently
In their final conveyance they chose to deceive again, omit their sins
No species would breathe life or to revitalize 
No species would restore the vermin of the universe
It was this final guise that justified their lives
Unveiled now, exposed, unhidden by their unjust ways

Exterminate them skillfully 
A baneful plan is then conceived
No need for weaponry or war, just deracinate them gracefully 
The archaic ones are agreed
Disease carried from microorganisms from beyond the deepest realms of the cold dark endless black
Air borne infection, highly contagious for there is no cure
Contaminate the vital needs for precious life
For their own good all must die,
Like a plague, no reluctance, none defy
Epidemic from the skies
Pestilential they all will die

Every last one, eradication of all humanity in its entirety
All will fall
The Termination 
This is the end of
Every last one, eradication of all humanity in its entirety
All will fall

Transmission neglection 
They would not have been brought back if it was not for the failure to disclose the truth
In one final death design the choice to remove the heliosheath
In one motion open up the heavens to send the solar winds
With no magnetic field, photons destroy at will, altering and mutating all the lifeforms' DNA
Bring forth a climate change drastic and so extreme, no species could survive the coalescing of these things

Exterminate them skillfully 
A baneful plan is then conceived
No need for weaponry or war, just deracinate them gracefully 
The archaic ones are agreed
None worth saving, their hearts are black
Every good deed followed by atrocious acts
The ancient ones end their lives,
It is best that they all should die

Every last one, eradication of all humanity in its entirety
All will fall
They all will fall
