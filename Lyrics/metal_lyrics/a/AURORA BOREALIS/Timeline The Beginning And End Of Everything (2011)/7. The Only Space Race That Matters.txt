You think there's nothing bigger than you, just look up
Your fate is in the hands of something from above

Your frail existence subsists, you live on borrowed time 
Science can only save you, sustain you for a while

You think there's nothing bigger than you, just look up
Live your whole life inspired, soon it will be done
There are so many ways in which Earth can meet its end
The inevitable end

Tectonic plate shifts, apophis messenger of death
Overpopulation, volcanic eruptions

Your frail existence subsists, you live on borrowed time 
Science can only save you, sustain you for a while
The only hope you have is far, far from this Earth
The journey treacherous but much deeper in worth

Will there be another Chicxulub, the end comes quick and swift
One million near Earth objects orbiting adrift
Will disease be carried back from the deepest realms of space
Or a gamma ray burst sent to erase your human race

Do humans even deserve to live?
Where they go, destruction follows with them

Ata carini, a supernova with extinction in mind
Coronal mass ejection, legal clouds of gas that leave Earth barren

Do humans even deserve to live?
Where they go, destruction follows with them

Earth's axis shifts, catastrophic climate change
The ice age begins
History shows every hundred million years, extinctions bestowed

Your frail existence subsists, you live on borrowed time 
Science can only save you, sustain you for a while

You think there's nothing bigger than you, just look up
Your fate is in the hands of something from above
These things won't be the Earth's end, it comes more gradual
Over myriads of years, and so much more vital

The thin blue line that is essential to your world
Is slowly crumbling, the atmosphere won't hold
The Earth's core is cooling faster than imagined
So much faster than they fathomed

This in turn exposes you, no more magnetic field
Assaulted by the neos, opened up to solar flares

The only space race that matters is on
To leave this planet will ensure existence
Do humans even deserve to live?
Where they go, destruction follows with them
