One billion years after these holes in space
Once magnificent stars begin to form and shape things
They are the heart
Dense gas and dust collect and pull together
The galaxy is molded, gravity its measure
New stars are formed, smaller in mass

Planets follow, then their moons
Materializing, elements consumed

All across the macrocosm this is taking place
One that you evolved within became the Milky Way

Abiogenesis, not the way it was
Creationism fused with evolution
This is a glimpse - This is the way

You're not the first, you will not be the last
Other creatures elsewhere, other beings else when
You're not the first, you will not be the last

This is a planned progression envisioned from the start
This is our first beginnings, a cosmic work of art

One billion years after these origins
Microscopic molecules begin to shift and move again
They'll be human
This is a slow process that to this day continues
Evolution on a scale seen through a deeper view
You are now formed, the mortal flesh

The breath of life follows on partrurition 
This is the soul breathed into you

All across the macrocosm, this is taking place
Multiplying frequently, this is the human race

We are not alone, discoveries will be made
Though unique, we are in a universal array

All across the macrocosm this is taking place
Multiplying frequently, this is the human race

We are not alone, discoveries will be made
Though unique, we are in a universal array
