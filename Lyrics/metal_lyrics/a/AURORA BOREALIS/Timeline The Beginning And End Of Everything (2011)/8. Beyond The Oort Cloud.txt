Somehow, the human race managed escape
With science helping, universes reshaped
Man's fingerprint reaching out far and wide
The species learning and enduring through time
Pushing on

Millions of generations, the quest for immortality

With help of DNA mapping, you can't cheat death
Regenerations and clones, you can't cheat death
Just elude it for a while, you can't cheat death
Circumvent it and beguile, you can't cheat your death

Billions of years pass, vast distance made near
Through use of wormholes transversing light years

Somehow the human race keeps moving on
Through physics, everything is understood
Pioneers
The blueprints of demise are clearly laid
The species can no longer try and evade their fate

Can you feel the extinction? As space continues its expansion
All the while inevitable, witness the end of all things
Suns continue to burn out, everything is losing heat
Energy is being consumed as the universe continues to freeze
Feel the cold freeze
Feel the cold freeze

The conclusion is, all things must die
Science cannot bring eternal life
All things end
Accept the fate, do not breathe in vain
There is a chance you could live again
We are the same

The sands of the hour glass run
Preserve the human race, can it be done?

With help of DNA mapping, you can't cheat death
Regenerations and clones, you can't cheat death
Just elude it for a while, you can't cheat death
Circumvent it and beguile, you can't cheat your death

A flicker was once given to you
The candle grows dim, perpetuate and ensue

There is still yet hope, just not in our universe
This is not the end, just the end of you
