Before the last of the humans passed
Before their end, a project was devised
Before they went into nothingness
Its course was then set before the demise

To live again another day, to live again another way
Their hope rests in a master plan
Set in motion starting when
The realized there's no escape
Preserve and keep the human race
The universe still growing cold
The fabric of time, they must fold

Space and time are curved in the presence of matter
String theory was proven true
There are eleven dimensions
Worlds within many worlds
A never ending multiverse
Do you exist there now? the chance cannot be taken
Proceed

Harness the power of black energy
Burning a hole in the fabric of time
Tearing and stretching again and again
Over and over, billions of times

This message they send encoded within
The foundation for life, will it suffice?

DNA mapping and human genome
Knowledge and wisdom they also encode
Cell and microorganisms as well
The chance they shall live and will somehow excel
Perhaps even the data is found
Another species reconstructs it somehow

Did it end with success? That's a different story
For a different time. This is still yours.

Life will still go on until the end
Fused with your species although not human
They are half machine and half human being
Though no longer birthed, still with flesh and blood

Other lifeforms continue as well
Amalgamate but perish they shall

The death throes approaching and even for them
The end is still coming, yes they too condemned
Life is now lingering, not much is left
Expansion is quickening and not repressed
