The reason your heart beats lies from within the stars
The building blocks of being transferred from afar

The life, the death hypernova
The life, the death, its time is over

Trillions form, set afire
Burning fuel, they expire

The most massive of these die a beautiful death
Metamorphosis complete behold the stygian depths

All things that drift too close meet their invisible end
Tremendous force displayed pulls deep in the chasm

Event horizon the point of no return
Destroy of worlds, not even light escapes

A place where time stops, another dimension
Some call this Heaven; others have no faith

This paradox unfolds in a universal guise
These things which bring destruction also bring new life

This is the storm in a sea of space
This is a storm, one that cannot be erased

A singularity like the one that started it all

The deepest black, a hole in time
A one-way exit where dimensions are defined

Gone forever, vanished in the void

The reason your heart betas lies from within the stars
The building blocks of being transferred from afar

This paradox unfolds in a universal guise
These things which bring destruction also bring new life

The life, the death hypernova
The life, the death, its time is over

Derived from this, galaxies form
Pulled together, thus conformed

The planets shifting, turning slowly, taking shape
Extraordinary species will inhabit this new landscape
