Before the stars ever burned, before the existence ever churned
Billions of years in the past saw an ever expanding blast

From a singularity comes all that will ever be

Crucible of creation, there was nothing and then there was
Crucible of Creation power to cast the formation

From that singularity emanates a violent heat
Beyond mortal agility burning at trillions of degrees

Crucible of creation, there was nothing and then there was
Crucible of creation power to cast the formation

Before the light, it's makers plan precise
Pure energy into matter, not truly infinite
With a finite beginning and a cold black frozen end

From nothing comes everything, out of nothing

Before the stars ever burned, before the existence ever churned
Billions of years in the past saw an ever expanding blast

From a singularity comes all that will ever be

Crucible of creation, there was nothing and then there was
Crucible of creation power to cast the formation

Matter time and space created all at once
Welcome to the darkest age, the time before the suns

Crucible of creation, there was nothing and then there was
Crucible of creation power to cast the formation

This is the finger of god bringing pure perfection
Emergence of everything the universe has begun
