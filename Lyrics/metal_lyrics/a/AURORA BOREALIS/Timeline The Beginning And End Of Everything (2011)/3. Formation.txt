Faster than the speed of light matter time and space flow
Accelerating coalescing shifting as it grows
A battle is underway two forces collide
Explosions of behemoth force logic is defied

Antimatter loses in this war
The fate of all future life is locked forever more
One part per millionth somehow survives
Billions of years from now this leads to your life

The architecture of the universe
The formation light years transversed

Behold
This is the timeline of creation what's begun is the foundation
This is the timeline of everything the massive cosmic fury rages
This is the timeline of creation what's begun cannot be undone
This is the timeline of everything and it will not cease

Two hundred million years after the war ends
Peerless clouds of heated dust force space time to bend
Submerged in the deepest heart a protostar is trapped
Turbulence moves from within gives rise to a slow collapse

Nuclear fusion fuels this growing force
Hydrogen forms helium at the very core
From the mass these elements suddenly ignite
The creator then spoke the words let there be light

The architecture of the universe
The formation light years transversed

Behold
This is the timeline of creation what's begun is the foundation
This is the timeline of everything the massive cosmic fury rages
This is the timeline of creation what's begun cannot be undone
This is the timeline of everything and it will not cease
