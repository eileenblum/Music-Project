It is true that every beginning has an end
This is that end, the universe will cease to exist

Light absorbed by darkness, an interweaving plexus

The big rip is tearing even quarks apart
Everything apart with an ever pulling massive force

Forty billion A.D. expansion is now slowing
Without heat, nothing can be moving
The big freeze, dark matter is done pulling
Now it all stops

In the vast emptiness of space
A grand power is consolidating
Greater than even this dark matter
Their inner hearts are not done churning

Gravity gives all things order
It was thought to have disappeared
The black holes pull to each other
Over billions of years

They become one colossal titan
Their reach grasping at the furthest depths
Everything that was pulled apart begin now to coalesce

Dancing headlong in slow motion
A recension underway
Suspended animation moving forward in reverse

The breathtaking beauty that once shown
In every corner of the universe
Its script is still being written
As it nears its rebirth
One hundred million A.D. back to singularity
The one that started it all erupts in a new beginning

Just like leaves upon a tree each spring, they are anew
We are too just like those leaves endlessly existing and renewed

Did you live for a reason? Or was it all for nothing?
As you ponder this question, don't forget to look up.
