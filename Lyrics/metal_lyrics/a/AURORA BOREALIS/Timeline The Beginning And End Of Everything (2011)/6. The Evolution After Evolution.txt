Ultimately at the mercy of powers you can't comprehend
The journey is just beginning but one day it must end

Five hundred thousand B.C. man sparks a flame
This discovery will forever change them
Mass migrations follow moving freely
The world is now populated advancements move quickly

As early as can be seen laborers are in need
Man starts his wicked reign with slavery
Fifty five hundred B.C. man is evolving
Irrigation, cultivation averts starving

The evolution after evolution
The evolution after evolution

Thirty one hundred B.C. a dynasty
Egypt was the first but there will soon be many
Each stronger, unrelenting, greater than before

Never ending, never changing human nature extremes
Far in the future humanity will unite
The population will undergo a struggle for their lives

Bring forth the information age

Begin the study of what's now known as the Earth
Which sparks the exploration of our universe

Great minds entwine together
Principa Mathematica

These are the ones

Copernicus, Aristotle, Galileo, Einstein and Ptolemy

The ultimate goal persists - escape the bounds of the Earth
Inspiration allows space travel, its birth
Tsiolkovsky, Goddard and Von Braun
Oberth, the pioneers to help with the unbound

Ion thrusters, the evolution after evolution
Super colliders, the evolution after evolution

Fast forward five thousand years, meager problems are replaced
With more significant issues thus begins the colossal space race
