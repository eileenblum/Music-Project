Limping through recess with my pulse unrecognized
These are her dizzy thoughts hospitalized
Sex offenders seek salvation in batting practice
Hunting size madness for a death certificate
I an punished by her sober etiquette
Pill poppers seek salvation in spectator sports
Breathing in ghosts of stiff paranoia
I would mistake her for a whistle blower
I love her, I love her, only a stool pigeon understands why
I love her, I love her, but promiscuity is sandpaper dry
