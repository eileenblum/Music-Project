Getting numb always spoils the fun
He don't realize she has sterilized
His dendrites with dental floss and he, he don't realize
He has chastised the platoon with his silly harpoon and grief
I'm about to excommunicate you
The lousy diapers I gotta suffocate you
He don't believe she can conceive a home wrecker with birth control blues
He don't believe she could be received as a temporary muse
