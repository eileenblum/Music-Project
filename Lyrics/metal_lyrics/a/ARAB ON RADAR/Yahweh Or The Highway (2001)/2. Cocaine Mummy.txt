Numbing the effects of that heart-cart truck stop
Spreading rumors around the Mexican border
I've longed to smuggle my sperm across that border
I've grown to take precaution with your daughter
They blamed me for eating the dirt
I just lack the nutrients found in the American meals
Sneak in the garage with that first time smell
Filling her belly button up with my purpose
He cloned a deviant to rape her
He portrayed a listener to bang her
They claimed I blew the neighborhood bully
I just wanted to compare his leg to mine
