She don't mind where my dirty mouth has been
She'll just wash it out with soap again
I asked her why was she slummin' with me
She said, "just to have you in my pussy"
She don't mind if my brain don't work too good
I'm missing some parts under the hood
I told her I don't like the way her pussy tastes
She said, "why?" and she sat on my face
I only get her on the egg hunting days
Her other lovers get her on the hairy dessert days
She'll stand at my working class slut event
She'll just improve before it began
I asked her why am I slithering with her skin
She said, "you better get first aid for that thing"
I only get her on the egg hunting days
Her other lovers get her on the hairy dessert days
