And this plumber goes into a bowling alley looking for trouble
He does not go anywhere without his plunger and pocketknife
He spots his first opponent and calls him a greasy worm
And without warning whacks him in the mouth with the plunger
"Hey, start picking your teeth"
And the plumber follows his opponent out into the parking lot
Where the greasy worm intends on getting his tire iron
The plumber repeats "hey, start picking your teeth"
And the plumber starts stabbing him in the leg with his pocketknife
And starts picking up his teeth and starts throwing them at the other bowlers
