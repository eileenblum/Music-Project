I Have Decided To Curse The World, Zeus And My Voice Shall Be Heard.
Lies And Treason Fills The Sky
Cry For Me Pandora, Cry.
Don't Dare Open The Box
Or The World Shall Be Cursed
Take Me Through The Shades Of Evil
I Am Losing My Mind
Save Me From The Blackness
I Can't Believe I Was So Blind
Grey Sun Like No One Seen
Bleeding With The Color Of Madness
Innocence Stained With A Touch Of Darkness
Burning Hearts And The Tongues Shall Be Poisoned Of Lie
All The Sinners Be Masters And Righteous All Die
Should I Leave It Open? Should I Close It Back?
And The World Is Turning Round And Round
Can You Hear The Voices Of The Torn Souls Inside?
And The World Is Turning Round And Round Upside Down.
Hope Is Lost Forever
And No One Shall Be Saved.
