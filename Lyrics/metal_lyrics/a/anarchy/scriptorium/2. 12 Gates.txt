Through The Gates He Must Pass, Through The Gates He Pass.

Candlelight Light Stairs Well Down The Stairs We Go.
And The Sound Of Screams In Each That Blow
Take My Hand My Child, Come On Let's Go.
I Will Show You The Secrets Of The World.
Just Follow Me, Hail To The Mighty Pharaoh
He Has Passed Through The Firing Lakes.
He Shall Defeat The Snake Apophis.
Faces Do Come By. 
Full Of Screams And Cry.
Give Me One More Chance.
Give Me One More Chance
To Purify My Soul.
I Have Lost My Crown, No Longer In Control.
Will I Be United? No You're Not. 
Ra Has Decided, To Change The Plot.
Vengeance Of Legends.
Of Kings And Queens.
Once You Were Mighty.
Now On Your Knees
