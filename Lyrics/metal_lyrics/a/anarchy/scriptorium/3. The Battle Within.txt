Once Upon A Time
A Story Has Been Said
About The Man In Your Head.
The Eternal Battle Between Evil And Divine
Shall Go Until The End Of Time
I Am The Shadow, That Dwells Within.
I Said I Am The Shadow, I Feed On Sins.
I Am The Shadow, At The Back Of Your Mind.
I Am The Shadow, And I Will Keep You Blind.
Can You Hear Me? Calling Out Your Name.
I Said Can You Hear Me. No I Got No Shame.
Have You Seen This Face In Your Dreams Before ?
Have You Looked For The Answer Behind Each Door ?
I Can Feel The Light, Shining Through From Deep Within.
And I Am Getting Tired Of The Demons And The Sin.
Can You Hear Me? Yes I Do, And You Will Never Take Me Alive.
I Shall Win And Pass Through.
Yes I Will And I Will Survive Day And Night
I Am Here Battling Deep Within.
