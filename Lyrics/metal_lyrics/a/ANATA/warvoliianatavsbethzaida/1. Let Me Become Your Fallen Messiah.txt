I am amused, your mind is seduced
Desire profane
Open to me, let your mind fly free
Put all your confidence in me
Come to me
Just let me in, you'll carry me deep within

Child of broken wings, I bring you down
I show you the world in my eyes
I become an obsession in your mind
You cannot escape from me

I am your savior
Come to me
Let me become your fallen Messiah
Behold what my powers hold
Bow deep before me
Let me receive your loyalty
Learn to serve and deserve me
You sold your soul and your flesh is mine
So bow deep before me

I stand watching the tide as it washes away
Last trace of innocence
Of lost virginity
Meet and join beyond realms of reality
I swear I'll never let you go

I take your soul, surrender to me
Wounded from the inside
You shall bleed
Open mouth, suffocating
All you ever wanted is here
I set you free
I have nestled into your body and soul

I pleased you in every way
My will burns in your flesh
Return the favor, please me now
Orgasmic paroxysm
As you die

Eternally breeding me
Give birth to creations to live in me
The seeds are sown
The crop I reap
Join with the harvested souls I keep
