[Lead: Schalin/Allenmark]

Torment, hatred, calamity
I've strived to overcome, for years
A recollection, I would like to believe
As a faded water-mark
Is The only thing that remains
Instead of deep imprints of pain

Human brain, what a powerful device
Capacity we can't believe, can't conceieve
What's erased can always be retrieved

All the pain drained from my mind
In violent streams ran underground
Where it arrived it putrefied
Sewerages
Rotted for life
Sewerages

Human brain, what a powerful device
Capacity we can't believe, can't conceive
What's erased will always be

Years have passed and rivers of hate
I have tried to dam
But the way you treated me
Made me who I am
My hands were clean
But you pissed upon my soul
Before I can be born again
I will have to explode

Vermin, bacteria, putrefaction
The sewege of the mind shall prevail
Because every cesspool needs an outflow
And if it should be blocked
the sewage finds new ways

Now the time has finally arrives
Erupted
Pipes are goping to blow
Get in the way and you'll be crushed
Drown and become one
With the sewage of the mind

All the pain drained from mind...
