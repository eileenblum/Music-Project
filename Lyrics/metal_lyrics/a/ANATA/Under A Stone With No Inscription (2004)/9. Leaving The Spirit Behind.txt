Did you ever feel
it's like you're hanging over an abyss
Your hands are tied,
you can't break loose
You're still hanging
only because your teeth
Have grasped the outermost twig of life

The only that keeps you from falling
Is that you keep your teeth clenched
Your body can struggle
But you just can't scream
You know you'd be crushed
Hitting the floor of reality
You suffer on and feel
Soon you're about to give in

Do you assume a reality
Existing without our perception
I don't believe it is so
The notion of reality is just a conception
Created by senses and mind
Leaving the spirits behind

If you view reality
As existing without the persistence
of minds
Then keeping teeth clenched
may be what is right
But if reality is created by you
Realize
This image can also be modified

I'm speaking of bringing the ground
Closer to your feet
Reducing the distance between
You and reality perceived
Let go and land in this image
of your consciousness
Ready to reconstruct

Do you assume a reality...
