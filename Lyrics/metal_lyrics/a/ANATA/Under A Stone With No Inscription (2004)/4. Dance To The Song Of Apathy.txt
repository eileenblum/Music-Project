Let's walk in a line
Let's do what the person in front of us does
Believ in what he believes
Let's forget our identity
So that we can assume no responsibility
For our lives
And the choices that we make
Or never make

Let us become one
With the bloodless crowds
Consequently, let us throw away our lives

[Q:] "Where are you leading me?"
[A:] "Where are you leading me?"

The leader you follow is a follower too
In a round dance gone astray!
There's no beginning and there is no end to it
Join the round dance to the song of apathy
(Not fully awake... sleepwalk hand in hand)

You could have been a god
But we are keeping each other in place
Cling to the hand in front of us
To the submissive we submit
And we assume no responsibility
For our lives
And the choices that we make
Or never make

Let us become on...

Your future os dpp,ed
If you only do what you're expected to
Depart from the beaten track
Maybe the blind will see
But follow neither you nor me
They'll refuse to dance to the song of apathy

So, where are you leading me?

The leader you follow is a follower too...
