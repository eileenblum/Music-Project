I feel like I'm about to drown
It feels like I have sunk too deep
The mask of water over me,
pushing me down
Has now become too burdensome
to overcome

I'm trying hard to see the sun
But from this angle
The surface reflects only
the bottom of the sea

At times, I feel I'd like to stop
Holding my breath and just exhale
And let the water fill my lungs
To drown is said to be
a pleasant way to die
Maybe if I just let go
Of my burden I'll eventually
Approach the surface
and drift downstream
And once again see
the fire of the sun

Again I try to see the sun
But from this angle
The surface reflects only
the bottom of the sea

Oxygen fails me but I hold my breath
I swim and try to reach the shore
Swim under water, maybe in vain
For I have almost lost my will to live

When I have lost my will to live
And my body is weak
Then carry me, please carry me
When my eyes are tired
Be my star
Shine for me
Shine for me my precious sun
