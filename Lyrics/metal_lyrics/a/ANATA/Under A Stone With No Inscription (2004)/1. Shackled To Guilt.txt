All was settled from the start
Immaculate and pure
I invited chaos to stain, defile
And purity was no more
Demise of the crown, hereditary prince
I stand by the gate of what is not
The castle now has turned
to a hole in the ground
Free fall

Bad gods glare at me
From the horizon line
These gods are for real
But maybe not omniscient creators

I live in a fantasy
And when I dream, let me dream
And never wake me up again

Choke on guilt
Near death experience
And I can not see
The light at the end of the tunnel

Al that was is again
Those I let down have forgiven me
Once more they have faith in me
All I was I am again
Reborn, I am a child
It's but a dream and I hate myself

All was settled from the start...

There's a future looking bright
There's hope, I've got the strength
I've go a life
And a talent for irony

All is dead
All is over
Bury me under a stone
with no inscription!
