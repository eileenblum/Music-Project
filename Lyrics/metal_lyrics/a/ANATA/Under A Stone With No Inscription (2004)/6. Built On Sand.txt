Diagrams, blueprints, sketches are drawn
Infinite calculations so accurate
Lines, circles, angles, images are linked
To perfection be combined!
Feverish movements to fulfill the plan
Frantic operation, sweat breaks on your brow
Foundations of a new world are soon to be seen
As soon as the old one has been crushed

Castles, built in the air

Powered by merely strength fo will
Bulldozers follow pulling down machines
Any remnant of the obsolete
Is soon to be crushed into dust
A new civilization is to be built upon
The steaming tombs of forefathers
Silent, choked, they are meant to be
In their coffins for eternity

Castles, built on sand

[Lead: Allenmark, Schalin]

Oh you dream, oh your dream!
Valid are no scientific rules
The undead will take revenge
Coffins will arise, buildings fall to the ground
The new vilization is now to decay
Blueprints to scorn your defeat will remain
Learn that inside is where to excavate
Or anything you build will be burnt down by hate
