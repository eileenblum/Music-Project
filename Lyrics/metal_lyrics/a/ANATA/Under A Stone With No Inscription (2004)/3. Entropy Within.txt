Under fire, we're at war!
Information is colliding
With our great intentions
And distracting our flow of energy
We are enslaved
By fear, rage, pain and jealousy
Incarnations of chaos
Rule our mind, kill our aspirations

Let's not fight ourselves!
But the entropy ruling our minds
It's a fight for our lives
A strife to take control of our perception
Fight!
Keep fighting the enemies within,
Fighting the entrop within

[Lead: Schalin]

Key to unlock the treasury:
Concentratrion undisturbed
State where body and mind unite
Time fades and we're filled with euphoria

Fight!
Keep fighting the enemies within,
Fighting the entropy within
