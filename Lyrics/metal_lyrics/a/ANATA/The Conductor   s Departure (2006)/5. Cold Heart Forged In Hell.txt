Searching everywhere
But always in the wrong places
For something
Anything to make me whole
These open wounds donât seem to heal

Something is missing
Probably just the love for myself
Iâm trying to compensate it with yours
So iâm just fucking you over
Thereâs no way to win this heart of mine

Cold heart forged in hell
My hell
Against my will

The more I give the less I have left
My body is on fire but my heart is cold
Company is just physical
Inside iâm alone

Take me, iâm all yours, yours and yours !
I give it all
My affection, my body, my services
Exclusively, but just for a while

To put it simple :
I can be the one, you can only be one
No matter how hard I try
Itâs been so long since I cared
Iâve almost forgotten how it feels

Cold heartâ¦

Inside iâm always alone
Someone, please break this heart of stone !
