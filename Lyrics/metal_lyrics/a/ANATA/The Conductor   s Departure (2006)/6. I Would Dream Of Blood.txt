Rain falls on sunny memories
In this trampled heart of mine
I feel sick and my knuckles bleed

I was sold by the goddess
Whom iâd worship and adore
But the price was mine to pay
Left burning at the stake
With hands tied
And the battle raging within

Whorse
I worshipped you for long and prayed
For a quick death of my heart
Before the fire would unite my hands

Yet at the same time
For long, I would dream of blood
And that the blood on my knuckles
Next time, will not be my own
