Manifestations of eternal spirits
Confused souls of murdered people
Infesting our bodies
Yet so bizarre
You dedicate your lives to exorcism
Indeed, youâre the chosen elite
Of this universe

A vicious and dangerous cult
Thrives by exploiting its victims
Enslaved by mind control techniques
And with a mission to sweep aside opposition

You wish to achieve total freedom
Freed from aberrations
But the delusional contents
Of the subconscious mind
Are instead brought to the surface
And presented to you as truth
So your state of Â« total freedom Â»
Is nothing but a state of mass paranoia

A vicious and dangerous cult
Thrives by exploiting its victims
Enslaved by mind control techniques
Downward spiral into madness

Defectors are hunted down
By any means rendered harmless

Enslaved by mind control techniques
Downward spiral into madness
