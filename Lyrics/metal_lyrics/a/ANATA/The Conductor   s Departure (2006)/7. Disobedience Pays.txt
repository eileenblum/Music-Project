Manacled into submission
Youâve let go of control
The rules are mine in this game of ours
Face down, down look at me !
All you feel is my smell
And the steel impossible to wear out
Iâm your god, your heaven and hell

Know me, your master
Learn my rules by trial and error
What is accepted
And for what you will be corrected
Disobedience pays

Now submit to my will !
I am mercy, I am pain
Your sovereign, your carer and cane
Let go of all your guilt
I forgive you, my slave
The sound of your cured defiance
Liberates the both of us

Know meâ¦

Lessons in obedience
Cures your unbridled behaviour
Disobedience pays

A moment of absolute power
Stuns my feeling of insufficiency
