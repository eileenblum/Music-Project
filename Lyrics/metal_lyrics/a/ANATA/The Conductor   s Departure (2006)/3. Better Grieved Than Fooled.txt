Tempted to believe ?
Even I, in my solitude
Cried for help and wished for
That someone would be there for me
Better grieved than fooled
And iâm prepared to accept my suffering
To live with pain
In the price for a life in truth

Me being the only lord
Iâm the only one who can forgive
And the only one to create
A future worth believing in
But I live a bitter life in truth
And curse its powerless god

I can deeply regret
My clarity of vision
Life had been much easier
To live, getting high on faith
Get a reason to live
Have a blind faith in the future
Forever stoned
Forever blessed in cowardice

Me being the only lord
Iâm the only one who can forgive

Better grieved than fooled
So I live a bitter life in truth
And curse its powerless god
