What was meant to sleep
Is now awakening
In a second you crush
All that iâve tried to rebuild

Insult to injury, time and time again
You play to the gallery
As you act the victim
Self-righteous, self-appointed
Yes I believe
That you believe youâre god

So let those without sin
Be the first ones to be crucified
Then let it be known
That youâre the one to pity
Instead of those who died

So hear my renunciations of faith

Through all my life
I have crawled on a leash
Never to follow my heart
Or become what I was born to be

A scornful smile
When I found my own way home
Forever criticised
When I failed to achieve your goals
Always too sure of my ground
But am I not
The very image of my god ?

Never again shall I drop to my knees
My god owes me an apology

[lead : SchÃ¤lin]

So let those without sinâ¦

Yes, let it be known !
That youâre the one to pity
Instead of those who died
