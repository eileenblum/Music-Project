Anger seeds sown once in not buried past
Hatred grows
With the thoughts of a liberation
See my eyes and you shall see
They're deeper than the blackest sea
Emancipation - serenity to be received

Release me

My mind all serene
My consciousness relieved
This is the only confession that I need

Enemies of mine
You shall be condemned
Imprisoned spirit of hate
Released when you're dead
Dare me now
I'll feel relief when you're dead
Satisfaction, retribution
I shall smile when you're dead

How many saw the pain I'd feel
No one saw
What could not be for real
I laugh in the face of humanity
Every oppression shall be scorned

Without you my mind would be free
Or I wish it would be
For every day in my life
Another dream to come true
And so many things to fulfill
And so much life and pain
And remorse to kill

Pain can be so sweet
Pain can be the sincerest thing
But in my heart the hatred grows
And crushes beauty viciously
As death can be so beautiful
But also insignificant
As in the most precious things
I writhe in disgust

(A revered prism I am...)

My eyes gather colors
And form it into total darkness
Inverted, twisted - like me
As bright as the sun may shine
As black shines my mind

Enemies of mine
You shall be condemned
Imprisoned spirit of hate
Released when you're dead
Dare me now
I'll feel relief when you're dead
Satisfaction, retribution
Maybe smile when you're dead
