Deep inside a black heart
A mourning shadow grows
Wolves in their chains growl
Moaning at the azure skies
Dreaming of a dark past
When the strong would reign in savagery
Let us burn our Christian ties
Let us arise again
Let the heavens hate!

Let us chant in blasphemy
Let us sing our heathen hymns
Join me in unholy dance
Let the heavens hate

Under the calm rages a mighty storm
My oceans are waiting to break free
God take thy face away from me
My oceans are
Thrown against the walls I did not choose
And the tide is the pulse
Of my bleeding heart
Soon to drown the land
Of the lord of light
...And the depth of the sea remains

Skies shall break, angels shall fall
Tumbling into swirling dust
Glaring teeth, fastidious tongue
Wolves unleashed hail the new time to come
My heart overflows
Pulsating with the pulse of the moon
And my oceans will crush their walls
Now waiting to break free
God take thy face away from me

Deep inside a black heart
A mourning shadow grows
Wolves in their chains growl
Moaning at the azure skies
Dreaming of a dark past
When the strong would reign in savagery
Let us burn our Christian ties
Let us arise again
Let the heavens hate!

Let us gather our thoughts
Let us use our strength in mind
Join me in the ritual
Let the heavens hate
