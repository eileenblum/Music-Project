Despise the lie!
What makes you strong is what I hate
The plague that heals your wounds
All you believe makes you sane, strong
Immune

Truth would destroy you
You would wish for death
If you saw what I see
And you would die, but I would see
You while you would fall
Before me

Fall before me
Soon you will be
Under my feet
And left behind like all conquered lies

If you could cleanse your soul
And leave deception far behind
We would never be equal
Because free I stand, rid of lies
But without lies you would be no more

I do not envy you
I do not want what you have got
I only wish to see you die
By your own hand
Deprived of all that made you live

Tough fuck, sad but true
Your vision... a reflection of you
Without substance
No reason

[Lead: Schalin]

Yes, I want to spread the truth
To all of you who were seeking truth
But reality behind your veils
Is far beyond your frame of mind

Drained of what you thought was life
You would be like an empty shell
Hollow, used and thrown away
Fragile as crystal in my hand

[Lead: Schalin]

Broken shell, empty and small
What will become of you?
Your life is worth less
Than sand under my feet

Leave deception far behind!
We will never be equal
Because free I stand, rid of lies
But without lies you'd be no more
Can I ever make you see
Or even think like me?
No, you will always feel
Safe like the child
Not knowing his father won't be back

For fire... burn with me
Know me deep inside
For truth... see what I see
Take my hand or fall before me
