My powers are running low
My strength is about to die
My soul needs to be fortified

Drain of blood
Powers flood

How divine
I feel your heartbeat next to mine
My soothing hand along your spine
The way to end my inner strife
Goes through your blood
I need your life

I admit my mind is sick
Obviously my strength's anemic
Your death is the antidote
Now your blood runs down my throat
Drained of blood
Rivers flood

How divine
Another heartbeats next to mine
My soothing hand along her spine
The way to end my inner strife
Goes through her blood
I need her life

This last injection
Exceeds all expectations

[Lead: Schalin]

Once again my rivers flood
As you were drained of blood
