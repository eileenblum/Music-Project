A haunting ghoul
I am the demon who rapes your soul
Raping your mind I take control

I am the one visiting your dream
I am the one with the vilest scheme
I see you in your dreams every night
I make your body convulse in fright

Twisting your hands to masturbate
With sinful thoughts I thee saturate
Bride of the beast groom I create

I soak the rag in chloroform
You breathe the mighty winds of the storm
As soon as you've anaesthetized
I do everything I've fantasized

This never was a dream
But you'll never realize

Don't be afraid, you will not die
As long as you keep me satisfied
