Too long on the throne, no resistance
You try to own me, possess my mind
Believing you can control my existence
Indoctrination, brainwash by lies

A nation I am
Sovereignty belongs to me
Deep inside infantry
Gather for attack

Prepare for war
All armies unite for the battle
I'm in command
We march to the front
To recapture our land

Attack/Insurrection
Nothing may stand in our path
No prisoners shall we take
Annihilate
No enemy shall ever rise again

Nightfall
And twilight is followed by stillness of death
Count your dead
I let all grievance be branded
Into your mind

[Lead: Schalin, Allenmark]

Gather hate, dominate
Enemies brought to account
If we shall meet any life...
Exterminate, eradicate!
No allowances we make

We've slain your nation...
Leveled with the ground
Lesson you have learned
Antagonists kneel or burn

We claim the highest throne
Our name is legion
The future is ours
My destiny is now in my control
