Left by dawn
Determined mind
The final way out
My bridges were burned
One last path to justify life...
To follow this crazy dream

Heading for the woods
To places I had been before
But in my dreams
They were altered
I just had to see
But the deeper I walked
Confusion emerged
Paths unknown?
I was astray

And though it was day
The sun shone no more
But as I despaired
Certain to be lost
I suddenly stood
By a temple

The temple in my dreams
With a thousand steps
My journey was complete
The source of essence
Of which I had been foretold
Climbing up the stairs
Hewn in stone
Stained with generations blood
Thorn, like poison snakes
Entangles me, severs my skin

Helped by the wind
At last at the top
A mysterious sight reaches my eyes
For on the very highest step
A gigantic mirror was placed
Unseen in my dream
I was dismayed

With fear I faced the mirror
And to my great surprise
My reflection...
The image of the devil
And behind...
At the very foot of the stairs
I could see clouds
And heaven from above

Through the mirror
I could see heaven's gate
Forever closed for me
All of a sudden
A stormwind came
And put the mirror in spin

Got hold of the thorn
Of the highest step
I see the mirror stop
Yet the wind blows
My image... I am Messiah
Hanging down the stairs
In the reflection a chasm
And the gate in front of me
Was the back of the gate to hell

I was sure to fall
A question of seconds
But once again
The wind came to my help
And saved me from the flames
But trapped in the grasp of the wind
I was violently thrown
Towards the spinning mirror
And I got caught in the spin
New dimensions I saw
But I never say the mirror again

My last way to redemption
Turned out to be a fatal delusion
I'm condemned
To eternal emptiness
Condemned to play roles
In a thousand worlds
I'm never to be myself again
