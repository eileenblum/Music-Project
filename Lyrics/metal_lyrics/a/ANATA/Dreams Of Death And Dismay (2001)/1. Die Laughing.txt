I realize as I awake
Life's to be taken to a new level
Belief is not the way
Dogma will dispirit your soul

The only road to mastery of life
Is to determine it's extremity
When it shall expire

[Lead: Schalin]

Choosing victim is easy
Enemies are first in line
You are the sworn
Targets for my crime
Expectations are growing fast
Stronger as I plan
Life's to get new dimensions
Mercy denied, I celebrate

Only road to mastery
Determine life's extremity
Someone's gonna die

Moment of death I release the blood
Awaiting thrills but I'm still cold
Instead of the power I'd possess
Reinjected emptiness

A belief in something
That couldn't fulfill my needs
I feel nausea
With myself, not with my deeds

So I'm back where I begun
But the only way out is another one

[Lead: Schalin]

Tired, confused, exhausted
I stab the dagger to my chest
My strength is not enough
Enough to penetrate
Pitiful I am
And despite the pain
Laughter from my throat
I just can't restrain

I vomit, I laugh, I suffocate
Ironic no one can deny
Beside my victim I laugh to death
Oh what a funny way to die
