Forsaken son
Kneel down with me
Entrust the father your agony
In house of god
The place of peace
Where in your demons'll find release

[Chorus:]
We will require blind faith
Devotion to our cause
We cannot lose control

Forsaken son, give into me
The holy father will set you free
You'll be at peace, if you obey
Out to reach paradise you must stay

[Chorus]

If you betray our secret
If you betray our cause
Hell awaits your soul

Forsaken son, you're now my slave
Give me the pleasures I'll crave
The house of god, the place of lust
This is the place where you placed your trust
