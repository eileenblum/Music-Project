The begging eyes of a dying priest
The red tears from the dead believers
The burning temple of the god that died
The beautiful sight of the slaughtered god

[Chorus:]
Revel in desecration
On your knees
Now pray to your fuckin' lord!

Blind eyes staring towards the sky
Searching for their tethered king
The vision of heaven a divine mirage
The beautiful sight of a slaughtered god!

[Chorus]

Now we are standing in
The remains of a slaughtered god

[Chorus]
