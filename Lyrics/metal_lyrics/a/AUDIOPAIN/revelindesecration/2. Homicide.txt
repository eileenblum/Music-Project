Slaughter awaiting, lust in my veins
Adrenaline pushing me on
A being supreme, need no motive to kill
Just flesh to fulfill my desire

[Chorus:]
Wielder of death, set on to kill
Enforcing the laws of my will
Ruthlessly killing, my next victim dies
The fires of hell in my eyes
Give into lust, blood must be shed

Seething with lust, going in for the kill
Harvest the innocents life
Mankind diminished to kettle to me
Reaping I'll take what is mine

[Chorus]

A lunatic's ways I've embraced with my heart
Homicides guiding my path
No longer human, a killing machine
Equipped with the will to succeed

[Chorus]
