I will force you to kill your brother
I'll ruin your sense of love
You'll never see smiles again
Never feel comfort in lie

The losers you see in your friends
The mirrors barely alive
That join forces
To make lower levels of life

Cause I'm your new god
You sold your soul to me
Your hour in heaven is over
Your lifetime in hell is to come

[Chorus:]
The dealers provide you my soul
You pay for my visit with time
I smile at you when we're together
And laugh at you when you're gone

I love to see you struggle
You parasite of the streets
Modern leper of decay
I laugh as I weed out the weak!

[Chorus]

Death camouflaged as freedom
To much is the way it will be
When I rule you through that needle
You know I destroyed you indeed!
