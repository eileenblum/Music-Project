Attention
Child of delight
Children of fright
Children of light

Traumatize
And dehumanize
Kept confined
To be at hand

[Chorus:]
Leave you bleeding
To my delight
Meet my lust
Now, give me all the pleasure I crave
Give me your flesh, your soul and your life

Terrorized
Into obedience
Subservient
To stay with me

[Repeat chorus]

There's no passion
Without pain
I'll do you good
And show you heaven
If you pray
IF YOU PRAY

In enslavement
Wrapped in chains
Pain without end
I'll show you heaven
Through the pain
THROUGH THE PAIN

THE TRAUMATIZER!!!
