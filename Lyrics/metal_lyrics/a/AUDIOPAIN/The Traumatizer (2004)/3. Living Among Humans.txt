Crawling slowly into life
Rotten teeth, smiling faces
Guided by commanding light
Guided well to mental hell

[Chorus:]
Constructed love injected
Licking their frozen guts
Again and again
No vision, no life
A ghost of it I am
Living among humans

Still crawling through broken glass
Chewing nails from a dead man
Sperm-vomiting virginity
Crucified fucking whore

[Repeat chorus]

Prison, walls of iron
Rats eating human hair
Chainsaw, raping enemies
Stench of my disgusting perfection

Electric brain, mirror-like eyes
Fiction-blood always pumping
Surviving filth machines
Finally we crucified death

Constructed love injected
Licking their frozen guts
Again and again
No vision, no life
A ghost of it I am
LIVING AMONG HUMANS
DYING AMONG WORMS
