Those that differ from what's normal
Non-compliance equals wrong
They get excited by the unlife
They see it all from above

[Chorus:]
Society of lunacy
They cracked the code, they're insane
Bonded by the truth they all have seen
Life is nothing but a game

Find the edge and make it yours
Go ahead and cross the line
And if you fail, you die, a shortcut ride
Death is death either way

[Repeat chorus]

Realize, we belong to death
And fear" will hold your hand
While pain will remind you of life
Feel the fire, and see death in its eyes
I live" for the thrill of the unknown

Religion of reality

[Repeat chorus]

Life is wrapped in sweet death
Once in a while you will see its smile
And in the end you will get the kiss
THEN NOTHING MATTERS ANYWAY
