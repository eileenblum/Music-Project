[performed by Audiopain]PAIN

to search for shelter endlessly
denial gives recovery
or temporary solace

DEATH

the end of hopes, the end of dreams
the end of pain or so it seems
when noone seems to care

It's the habit of fear
It's the habit of fear

LIES

To support and to sustain
words that take away the pain
like a serpents smile

FEAR

keep your thoughts inside your mind
paralyzed and turning blind
to keep yourself in line

It's the habit of fear
It's the habit of fear

FATE

pre-determined destiny
to search for shelter endlessly
or recuperate

HOPE 

the writings in the mind maintained
to strive towards the unattained
from a prison without walls

It's the habit of fear
It's the habit of fear
