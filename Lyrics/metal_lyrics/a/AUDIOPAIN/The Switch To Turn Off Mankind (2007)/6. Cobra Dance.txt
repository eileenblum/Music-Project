She gave birth to sin, obeying the snake instinctive lust like the serpent she was.
Greed over trust, when given a choice she chose the forbidden, blaming the snake.
Master evil, Mistress Eve.

Like the cobra's smile, haunting your soul, paralyzing malice, she is the snake.
Power abundant, beauty flavoured death, primitive lust and man lost control.
Master evil, Mistress Eve.
Venom disarms the man servant under Eve's command.
Like a serpent she bit injecting passion, the serpent has won.
She controls the dance with her flute, she's in charge, she controls the man as she controls the snake.
Domination the Master's hand, evil Command.
Damnation close at hand the final stand.

And the almighty god regrets the day, when evil took shape in so many ways.

She holds the key, the serpent in charge made a god in its image and savaged our minds.
Mistress of snakes arose from hell, root of all evil she gave birth to sin...
Master evil, Mistress Eve.
