Hellbound, the fight is on summoned to answer the call eager, to prove a point no confrontation too small.
All resistance of the soul giving in hellbound we're going down with a grin.
Storming, to the front virtues decaying inside relish, the taste of blood gleefully taking that ride.
All resistance of the soul giving in hellbound we're going down with a grin.
Nowhere to hide more guts more pride street justice martial law every nerve rubbed raw.
Conviction, at point blank the law of the victor is might morals, caving in brutal force making it right.
All resistance of the soul giving in hellbound we're going down with a grin.

Blur of faces more life wasted.
No compassion to be found we are hellbound.
