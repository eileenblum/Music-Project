Manipulation of itself, a truth creation of man, the weak.

Source of mass-enslavement, holy toxic, it doesn't have a reason, it's dead.
And still they gather, the heard to worship and pray obsessed.
Source of mass-enslavement, holy toxic, it doesn't have a reason, it's dead.
Source of mass-enslavement, holy toxic, it doesn't have a reason, it's dead.
It's the truth, it's written, it's the law, no doubt, no questions, sacred law.
Righteous needs no proof, on his knees, serve to please a traitor, an insurgent of the mind I am.
Source of mass-enslavement, holy toxic, it doesn't have a reason, it's dead.
