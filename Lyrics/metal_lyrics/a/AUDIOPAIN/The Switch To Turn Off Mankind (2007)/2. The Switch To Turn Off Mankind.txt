Mental bulldozers let loose cruising towards life a trail of, human Mud I shall bring peace.
Mankind on its knees before a power too strong , helplessly accepting their god proven wrong, panic releases the evergrowing fright, while sanity dies as there's no cure in sight.
Hope crushed on display, screams breed like flies, you envy the dying in the mirror, where I bring peace...
Faster to death with throttle at max, As I introduce Mr neck to Mr axe self-righteous ethics forced down your throat, no room for morals in this sinking boat.
Penetrating sirens howling, mankind has lost the monument of society is falling, as I bring peace.
Burning the rest in the fire with god, leftover faith sunken in blood, far beyond terrifying closer to hell and yet another train of believers derails.
Ruins, landscape of death, history's over and gone, silence like never before as I brought peace.

Geniously evil forcing you down, total destruction you're loosing your ground, I'm in command, I give the sign , I rule the switch to turn off mankind.
