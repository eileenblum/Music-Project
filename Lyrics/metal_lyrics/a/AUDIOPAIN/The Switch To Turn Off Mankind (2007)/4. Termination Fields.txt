Termination destined, I will give in almighty no one I will obey.

I must get out of here, avoiding that path, the way they run in circles, a way to flee down.
Arise, to descend, arise.
Source of all salvation, it's you and me again, core of abstinences to keep me down.

Arise, to descend, arise.
No limitations, only time is a threat, no regret or worries, I'll do my needs in hell.
Our own circles, our own reasons, our own pace.
We aim downwards, we run slower, we mute life.
Condemnation of ideals, termination fields.
Another dawn in hell, resume that circle race, almighty no one I will obey.
