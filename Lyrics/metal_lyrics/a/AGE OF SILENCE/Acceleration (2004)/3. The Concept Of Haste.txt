The cycle of life speeds up like a rabid biker
Getting narrower for every turn
Its silver tail not as shiny as it was
The colossal width only paper thin
Acceleration beyond light and darkness
Welcome to the modern museum of life
A strobe-like feeling of universal consequence

The rate of change of velocity
Merely a tool to make us see
That no one can stand as still
In such a speed as we always will

Warm relations turn down the heat
Dust is everywhere, all mouths are dry
This is my nest - I'll defend it with my life

Cosmological consequences of not relating
Connections cut, no restrictions necessary
Yesterday, today, tomorrow
