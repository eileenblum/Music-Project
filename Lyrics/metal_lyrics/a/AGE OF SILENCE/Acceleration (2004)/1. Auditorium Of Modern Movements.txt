This is the auditorium of modern movements
A breeding ground for light speed profit thinking
Where a biting shine exposes the possibilities of the flesh
And the direction of the green flow

This is the city of Soma - an idea brought to life
And carefully designed by George Reed

Founding member of Modern Architects Deluxe

So you're climbing upwards through structures of metal and glass
Subconsciously trying to reach the roof, but somehow there's always one more floor
It's a strange mixture of soft thinking and hard work
Or was it the other way around?
The ground for comparison was trampled a long time ago,
So no one really knows anymore
Amidst this aimless craving for matter
