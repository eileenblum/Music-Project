Coloured flashes never burned my eyes
The way the dirty sun does
On my way from the office,
Through streets of bleached light,
It came to me that what I had to do was
To find the main flow and obstruct it
It came to me that what I had to do was
To find the main flow and obstruct it

So I went to the cathedral.
Nick-A was at the turntables as always
The fans were already dancing like madmen

So I went to the cathedral.
Nick-A was at the turntables as always
The fans were already dancing like madmen
To the pulsating beat.
It had a cashier-like quality

A soundtrack working in verdant direction
Mr. A kept chasing the flow with an ever-increasing BPM
As the audience exchanged movements
- bargaining for moves and grooves
until power restrictions were enforced
and the BPM sunk like a stone

Coloured flashes never burned my eyes
The way the dirty sun does
On my way from the office,
Through streets of bleached light,
It came to me that what I had to do was
To find the main flow and obstruct it
It came to me that what I had to do was
To find the main flow and obstruct it

So I went to the cathedral.
Nick-A was at the turntables
The dancers were left in despair - discontented
It was rumoured that some of them chose the red exit
