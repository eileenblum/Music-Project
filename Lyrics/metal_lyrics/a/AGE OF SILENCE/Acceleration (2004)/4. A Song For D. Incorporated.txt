They sent me an invoice
- "P&amp;S to be returned to D. Incorporated within the date of _."
So I gave them a call. An angry one.

9-113-451208

I said: "Why are you invoicing me?"
I heard whispers and slow breathing
"I never made a purchase from you, so stop bothering me"
The whispering stopped. The sound of hot air sustained
"I demand an explanation"
All went silent, and the phone seemed to get heavier
A deep voice in the other end of the line:

They sent me an invoice
- "P&amp;S to be returned to D. Incorporated within the date of _."
So I gave them a call. An angry one.

"It's not yours, you lease it
It's not yours, you lease it"

"Please be kind and return it to us
Within the date stated on the invoice,
Or we will have to come and claim it by force."

"It's not yours, you lease it
It's not yours, you lease it"
