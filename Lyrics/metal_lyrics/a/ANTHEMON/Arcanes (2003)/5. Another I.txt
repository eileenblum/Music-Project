Another I is dead
Another I is born from somewhere
I'm looking for this place where I'd got no face
Who am I? Where was I?

I woke up in the middle of this land
I couldn't feel my hands
Behind me, Future disppeared in the fog
I casted a glance over this place.

It was desolate, gloomy and odourless
Through fields, I walked to find a shelter
I was half way up of an hil when I looms a river

Who am I? Who was I?
I'm looking for a place where I recognize myself

Another I is dead, Another I is born from somewhere
I was looking for this place where I'd got this face
Who was he? Was he dead?

Suddenly I heard a voice
Coming from nowhere
Who said "Come, cross the river, you will know who you are"
So I crossed, I was fascinated
