Scared to death at this new dawn
You have to endure new pains now
Another of your weaknesses to hide
Haunting your days, killing your pride
Find the force to stand what's around you
Face with strength everyday Life's aggressions

There is no secret garden to go to
Every hour of light is a million redemptions

Feel with courage the humiliation
Walk straight with an aim to get
Open your conscience to your condition
And think about happiness you never met
And when darkness leaves its den
Far from the stench of men

Most of your fears disintegrate...
But tomorrow is running, running faster than you...
