Infinity lying in its own ethereal beauty
Universes defying the passage of time
Suns that set with millions years of history
Planets and astral dust at the top of their fame

Earths welcoming all lowest forms of life
Oceans eternally feeding their children with tide
Skies contemplating with serenity the crawling down
Fire remains the fear of ones to keep its crown

Trees teaching the meaning of patience and wisdom
Lakes sharing its goodness with the lucky ones
Mountains holding the secrets of the beginning
Diseases executing the will of nature's kingdom

Abysses revealing the depths of their ages
Rain falling to wash the soils away
Clouds floating in their celestial cages
Sparks at the edge of an alternative way.
