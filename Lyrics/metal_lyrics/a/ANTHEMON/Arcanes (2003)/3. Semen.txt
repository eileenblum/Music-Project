At dusk shall start this sensual ceremony
Two shapes melt in fast synchronized breaths
United by flesh but still quite lonely
When blows the old friendly smell of death

Pact signed for a short flee to ecstasy
Warm embraces and long voluptuous kisses
United by flesh in all serenity
Hypnotising eyes on their smileless faces

For years nature has given birth to millions trees
For years rivers has driven their content peacefully
Tonight two shapes quietly stand on their knees
Ready to a fusion in a wished flesh harmony
No need yet to release the lifefull seeds

It's time to lose control in absolute euphory
Drink at the organic well with lust and greed
And drown with thirst in celestial perversity

Timeless erotic behaviour teasing
The ageless craft of limbs excitation

Two shapes melt in synchronized breaths
Reaching together the gapes of their little death

In warm and wetness lives their passion
When every sigh has its own meaning

At dawn shall stop this sensual ceremony
That moments of grace raised to heavenly

Sweat and Semen soiled, Sigh and Semen united...
