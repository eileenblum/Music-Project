I can feel what you feel and hear all these lies
I don't want to live your sufferings... outside
Pain, fear and despair don't exist here... inside
Your womb, the best place where to grow and die...

Why would you love me, why would you cherish me?
Why would you give birth to me, to this freak?

Your womb as a cage, freedom will be death.
I just want to live inside you... forever.

In my dreams, you life, that's why
I want to give birth to you.
You're the jewel of my life.

The jewel won't shine anymore, I'm death
I don't want to see your smiles and feel your kisses.

I just want to die.

In my dreams, you're life, that's why
I want to give birth to you
In my dreams, you're hope, that's why
I want to give birth to you.
You're the jewel of my life.
