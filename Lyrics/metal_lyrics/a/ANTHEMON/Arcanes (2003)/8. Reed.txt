These days, I tried, I tried, I tried
But life kept me next to her, why?

Like a reed, I fold but don't break
Since these moments, nothing distresses me.
Behind my misanthropic and insensitive wall,
My love is a so beautiful corpse.

Rain and wind remind me your death
But like a reed, I fold but don't break
The river that feeds me is only silence and scorn
That's why I'm so black...

Since these moments nothing distresses me
But like a reed, I fold but don't break

So nobody cares of...
My doubts... My cries... My fears... My pain... My dreams... Me

Yet I realize that, like an oak, I'm tough.
