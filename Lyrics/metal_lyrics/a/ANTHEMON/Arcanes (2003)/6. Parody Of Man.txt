Even the dead are more alive than me
I'm no human being.

I'm glowing with Lifesickness
Becoming a parody of myself
I'm turning into Meaningless
Slowly, I'm laughing at myself

Even your smiles and kisses can't help me
Past killed me, Future will raise me from the dead
But I don't have present anymore.
Why am I like that?
Why these sorrows, these tears?
