A new plant takes birth in vitro
In this clinic, greenhouse of souls, she gets form
You're not the embryo of the Earth neither loves

The evolution of the foetus will be strange
Symbol of this experimental garden

Enter this cold era
Where the best can meet the worse
Flower from nowhere takes root, manifold of...

A frigid present, future in a capsule
The laws of nature are changed
The limits will be passed
This new creature blooms in this icy cradle

Manifold

A frigid present, future in a capsule
The laws of nature are changed
The limits will be passed
This new creature blooms in this icy cradle

This new creature blooms in this icy cradle
The limits will be passed
The laws of nature are changed
A frigid present, future in a capsule.
