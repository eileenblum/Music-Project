The dim woods, the snowy fields,
The deep lakes - It's my land!
The great warriors, the pagan rituals,
The ancient gods - It's my land!
On my land I stand and I admire It's beauty
It's dim forests and It has dark oakgroves
It has endless fields and It has snowy fields
It has transparent lakes and It has deeply rivers
It's a country of my ancestors'
It's my ancestors land!
Many years ago on that ancient land
Lived, fought and died great warriors
Clanged steel of swords and flew blood of enemies
Many great battles took place in that country
But my ancestors have never kneeled the ground
And they always defeated their adversories.
Once upon a time there worshipped great gods
For true ancient pagan deities
People made sacrifice and prayed them
And now true belief returns
Altars again are standing in the forests
Now we can again come unite with nature.
We again hear call of forests
Blood of ancestors is flowing in our veins
Their voices sounding in our brains
And we sharpen our swords
Great war has just begun
We'll protect our ancient land!
