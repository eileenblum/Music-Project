I'm blackraven
I'm a woodchild
I'm bird of gods
I'm a wild warrior
Spirit of ancestors
Wind in your hair
And I fly to you
I'm darkness
I'm sorrow
I'm a cry
I'm a call
I'm a voice
The voice of old times
Your lost wisdom
And I fly to you
I'm woodchild
I am you
I'm your freedom
I'm your belief
I'm your true way
Way in the darkside
Road in the eternity
And you fly with me
