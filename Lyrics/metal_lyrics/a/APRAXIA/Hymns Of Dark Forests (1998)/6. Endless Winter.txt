Cold wind is singing a song to me
About a great snowy land
It revealed me saga about a fairy place
On that huge Earth
I often dream magic dreams of that
By winter enchanted land
And I wanna tell this tale about
The snowly land of the endless winter.
Obeying to the ancient gods' pledge covered
The snows this land throughout for ever
And in rivers, lakes and seas beneath the ice
Flows blue water no more.
Mountains and woods, fields and oakgroves
Are carpented eternally with sparkling cover
Within endless winter's power the whole world sleeps
Eternal fairy dream.
Every thing around keeps silent, no sound is heard
Every single thing is bound by magic silence
And at once dies down into the night
Every thing is white thoroughout,
and there's no life
Which used to be, seen beneath snow
But the bright sun hot arrow will
Never melt the snow
Nothern wizards covered all skies
Through with huge magic black coat
And at the sun dungeon guard stands
Faithful guardsman with sword
Black ravens fly over land
And search for prey among the snows
No one will ever save this land from
Eternal sparkling snowy fetters
And every thing's gonna remain as before
Through years pass by swiftly
Fly with me into this nameless land
Where eternal darkness will rule forever!
