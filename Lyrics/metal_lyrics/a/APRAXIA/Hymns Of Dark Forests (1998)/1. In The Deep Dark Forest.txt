In The Deep Dark Forest
Elders sit by the fire
They are praying for pagan deities
And saying the incantation:

Perun - great god of thunder
Dazhbog - great god of Sun
Chernobog - god of darkness

We're asking for your help for us!
Priests make sacrifice
And idols again in blood
Ancient pagan rituals
Open doors to other world

Svarog - great god of skyfire
Yarilo - god of fertility
Kharachun - god of death!
