On ancient slavonic land
Among woods and swamps
His birth was prophesied by volhvs
He's gonna lead the people
And grand duke was born in a dim forest
By valkiria-maiden
And rix Veselinov gave his son
Great name - Bozh
Hey, Slavs, let's sacrifice to Perun
And rush into the fight again
Bozh will lead us to fight
Against cruel enemies
The troops of our native land brave sons
Ride under the flag of hate
We're gonna bring back our ancient gods
In sacred groves of our great motherland
We are the warriors of winner's race
We carry war to our enemies
And Bozh will lead us like our
Ancestors in bygone days
