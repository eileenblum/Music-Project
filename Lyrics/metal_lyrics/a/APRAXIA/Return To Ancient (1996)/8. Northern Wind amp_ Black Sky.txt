My Name Is Sigurd "The Bloody Axe"
I Am A Northerner And Take Pride That
I Am A Viking I Pray For Odyn And Thor
I Am A Warrior, Northern Winds Calls Me To War
Northern Wind Help Me Sweep Unbelievers Out Of Existence
And He Sing Me Batlle Song For My Great War Dance

Churches Of My Enemies Burning, Smoke Of
Conflagration Turned Sky Into Black Colour
Black Sky - It's A Great Symbol Of True War
And Until Black Sky Over My Head, Until
Northern Wind Filled Out Drakkar Salls
I Be Contined My Fight, I Be Continued My Fight
