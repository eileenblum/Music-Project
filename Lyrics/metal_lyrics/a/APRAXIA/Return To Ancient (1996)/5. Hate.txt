All World Is Damned Place
Dark Fury In My Face
My Eyes Are Burning Hate
Now It's My Normal State
I Want, I Want To Kill
All People, Who Now Live
I Need To Kill Human Race
Because They Want My Death

All Friends Betrayed Me
They Didn't Want Me To Live
I Want To Revenge For All
"Dogs, die!" - Now I Call
And Take In My Hand Knife
To Deprive Them Of Their Life

Jesus Betrayed Me
He Can See Nothing
My God Leaves Me ALone
My Heart Turns Into Stone
Now Satan Is My God
And Now I Want Blood
I Nedd To Kill Human Race
Because They Want My Death
