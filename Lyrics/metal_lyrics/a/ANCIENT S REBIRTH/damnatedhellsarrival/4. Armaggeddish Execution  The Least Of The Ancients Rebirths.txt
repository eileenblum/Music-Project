A diabolic howling breaks the peaceful silence
Here the blood freezing sound form out there in the voids,
Form the eternally shadowed dominions of the night, night
Doomed sounds of the night, youâll wish you were dead tonight
Cause this eve is raised by thee,
Whose willâs to aggravate your destiny!
And gathered are now his knights,
Upon the ancient battlefield

The memorial mark of history
To celebrate the arrival of his greatest victory
This is the least of the ancientâs rebirth!

Wizards are chanting in circles to evoke all the fallen angels
Their brothers form a past time, brothers in magic and faith!

In a dark and nasty sphere
A small stream of light found its fate
The whore of Nazareth wandered
Or she walked towards the battlefield
From the darkness came a voice

Doomed sounds of the night, you'll wish you were dead tonight
Cause this eve is raised by thee,
Whose will's to aggravate your destiny!

I welcome thee disgusting whore, to taste the fruit of sin
To watch the final scene for the spirit of your son

Do you possess the power to fight the animal?
Do you possess the pride to ignore the one with horns?
Do you possess the art to kill your enemy?
No!

And gathered are now his knights,
Upon the ancient battle field
The memorial mark of history
To celebrate the arrival of his greatest victory
This is the last of the ancient's rebirth!

Oh, she burned, that night, in mighty flames of lust
The holy ghost was gone within the smoke of
burning blasphemy!
Burning blasphemy!
