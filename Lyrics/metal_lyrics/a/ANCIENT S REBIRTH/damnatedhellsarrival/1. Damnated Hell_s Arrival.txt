Let loose they Satanic forces
From the fiery dominions of hell
Let flames and thunder roar
Let lightning strike from the midnight skies
Gather thy servants of darkness
Until all the forces of evil
Since ages ago weâve been waiting for the fall of the pearly gates
The ravens are singing a song
About adventures... in ancient times

Times of grief from the trees at... the hillside horizon
Oh, their song is enchanting
Like a spell the damnationâs on
Have evoked the wrath of the ancient ones

Damnated hell's arrival
Damnated hell's arrival
The fiery kingdom is rising
Damnated hell's arrival
Damnated hell's arrival
Suffer beneath the masters whip!

Ages once great seem forgotten
Now engraved by the time
No one hears the choirs in the wind
The ancients breath so frozen
But now the time is yours
Youâre foolish and youâre weak and your divine moment of lies
Nothing has been forgotten
Open your eyes and see...

Damnated... damnated hell's arrival
Damnated... damnated hell's arrival
Damnated hell's arrival
Damnated hell's arrival

Damnated hell's arrival
Damnated hell's arrival
The fiery kingdom is rising
Damnated hell's arrival
Damnated hell's arrival
Suffer beneath the masters whip!

Hell's raging liers are sown
Where the forces infernal cross
The true divine will come forth with seemingly endless wrath
Angelwings I see the burn in the red and fiery skies
And on the ground below, I behold the shadows... of Satan!
Impressed by this order of chaos
I scream out a laughter so mean
No, no one's have, never ever
A such great and full scene

Open up the gates of hell

Damnated hell's arrival
Damnated hell's arrival
The fiery kingdom is rising
Damnated hell's arrival
Damnated hell's arrival
Suffer beneath the masters whip!

Open up the gates of hell
