Mother nature explode in colors
It is the gruesome season to come
The darkness grows in my mind
As the tress fade to die
Oh, I feel so strange, the wind blows so cold
It feels like someone else reign the time to come
May this, my subconcious prophecy turn out to be real
As autumn turns to winter...
Then winter will turn to death

Times to come are frozen
I feel it in the air
Times to come are evil

Oh, what a lovely feeling to wake up to a choir of witches
Those grey infernal creatures
As they lurk in the obscure morning light, morning light
Snow has covered the ground
The wolves must be a sign, a sign, a confirmation of whatâs left to come

I release my spirit of hate, as I enter the circle of wolves
They, brothers from the dark past, shall tear the lambs apart

Times to come are frozen

Times to come are frozen
I feel it in the air
Times to come are evil
