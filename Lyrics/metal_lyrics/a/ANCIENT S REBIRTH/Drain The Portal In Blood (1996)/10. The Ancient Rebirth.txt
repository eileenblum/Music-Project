Shadows of the twilight
Suffocate the light of day
Fog rise in the forest
The breath of lucifer
The moon shines on the holes
Of evil entities
Soon they will awake
Hail to their return

100's of years asleep
Suddenly they're here
Killing all of light
They will bring us to the dark
Evil rides the earth
The ancients are reborn

Lucifer we greet you now
We'll serve you as your slaves
No one can stop thy unknown hordes
In this mess of obscurity
We'll join you in the evening
As the twilight rapes the day
We've been waiting for you
Ancient ones
To avenge your destiny

We'll evoke the darken centuries and kill the holy light
We'll stay here for all eternities to crush the name of delight
We'll turn into demonic shapes and take away some lives
Rape the mortal human race the eternal sacrifice
