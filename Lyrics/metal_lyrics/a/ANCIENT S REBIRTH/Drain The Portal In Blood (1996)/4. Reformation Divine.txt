Wrath of evil is mighty
Wrath of evil is strong
All evil shall crush (god) the almighty
Blood shall cover his throne
At last our forces are faced
To crush the weak by hate

We are the bringers of evil
We are the bringers of war
We are the children of darkness
And darkness was here before god

1000's of demons are howling
Waiting for sign to break free
Face the swords of immortals
Face the hate in their eyes
There's no return for jehovah
There's no return from this night

...The human soul is a beast
Fed on hatred and lust
So serve your infernal soul
Follow all urges from hell
