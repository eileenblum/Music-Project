In a long lost forgotten place in the forest
The trace of his castle is rised like a monument
An ancient building of stone points to the sky
The remnant of the northern tower of withcraft

In which he used to spend the darken fullmoon nights
Committing bloody rites to serve the mighty master
But a great infernal storm the moisty ground
With water from the sky the rain seemed eternal

The mighty castle sank with him - the blackest wizard
Down into the jaws of an unknown destiny
Centuries have passed since the tragedy
But demons haunt the place to guard their servants home

The long lost forgotten place in the forest
A trace of ancient evil
A trace from the past
