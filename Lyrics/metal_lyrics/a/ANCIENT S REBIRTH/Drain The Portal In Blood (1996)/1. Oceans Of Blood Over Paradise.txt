Once the sun was shining over his kingdom
The god from the cast - the bringer of love
People there lived happy the people lived in peace
The birds were singing a song and the sun shined in the fields

Till that day when the wizard arrived
The wizard from the woods
The wizard he was evil
Evil damned and mean
And he cast his spell
Upon this godly kingdom
Black clouds filled the sky
And blood was falling downwards

Blasphemed the heavenly scene
The kingdom was caught in damnation
The wizard so evil and mean
Destroyed this once heavenly kingdom

Once the sun was shining over his kingdom
The god from the cast - the bringer of love
The sun drowned in clouds and the kingdom was burned to ashes
The god was impaled and his love turned to lust
