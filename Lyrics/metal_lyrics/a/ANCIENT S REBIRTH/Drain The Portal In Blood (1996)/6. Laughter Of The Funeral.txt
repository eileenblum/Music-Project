The sound of cries in agony
Awakes my sleeping demon
The mood of grief excites me
The mood invert my grief to joy

The demon makes me laugh a demonic silent laughter
My tears are filled with joy cause I enjoy the death

Laughter of the funeral...

This ceremony is boring
Have no understanding
May my feelings are gone
And may my soul is cold

The hymns are raping the souls
Of the ones which I hate
I feel their anger against me
I feel their anger against me
But I laugh a their fault cause I'm stronger

Laughter of the funeral...
