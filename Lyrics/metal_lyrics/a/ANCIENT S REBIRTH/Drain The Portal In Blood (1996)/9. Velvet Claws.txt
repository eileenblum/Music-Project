Watch the ravens in the sky prepare for my return
Greet my arrival with knowledge
And on the wings of the storm
I come riding in the dark
On the back of my great black horse
Followed by wolves and entities
All of the darkest breed

Come to me so that we through magic can unite
Unite and haunt as one
Together reach the highest level tear down and break the stones
Come to me you whos blood run in my veins
Who in fire the flame
Come caress me with your velvet chains

So in the morning mist we hide
As lovers we embrace earch other fiercely
Generating powers and so my pale enchantress dance for me
Dance with blasphemous grace - snare my flesh

Drain the portal in blood
Snatch the treasures of eden
Shred them crush them
Render their bones to dust

In our unity we'll abolish the denial and the sin
Tear down and break the stones
Come to me you whos blood runs in my veins
Who is fire the flame
Come caress me with your velvet claws
