Iâm tired of getting shit on, pissed on
Iâm feeling like a loaded gun - Yeah
Iâve been smacked down, thrown round
Iâm feeling like a bastard son - Yeah

Tell me what you want
What would you want to hear
Give me four shots give and me four bears
Take me to a knockdown drag out
Rock and roll show right now - Yeah

So turn up them lights
Weâre all here tonight
We came to throw down
Yeah the mobâs back in town - Oh yeah

Iâm working all day shit
Pay busting it from nine to five - Yeah
Iâm getting no sleep
Six feet under feeling buried alive - Yeah

What do you want to do
What do you want to say
I want to quit my job and just walk away
Iâm going to a knockdown drag out
Rock and roll show right now

So turn up them lights
Weâre all here tonight
We came to throw down
Yea the mobâs back in town - Oh yeah

So turn up them lights
