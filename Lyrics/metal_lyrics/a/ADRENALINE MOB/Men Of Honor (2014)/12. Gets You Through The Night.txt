[Bonus Track]Youâre running round like a big shot
Canât fit your big head through the door
It isnât anything I havenât seen a thousand times beforeâ¦ yeah
I heard youâre running off your big mouth
Wanna lay it all out on the floor
You wanna play with the big dice better think twice before you throw
Oh.. I hear you, I guess Iâm just not fit to understand, oh noâ¦
Say what.. I canât hear you, I guess Iâm just a fool who donât understand

Whatever makes you feel alright
Whatever gets you through the night baby
Whatever makes you feel alright
Whatever gets you, gets you through the night alright alright

I hear you knocking at my back door, wanna give it one more time around
Iâm hearinâ rumors that your spreading shit all over townâ¦ yeah
Thatâs what theyâre saying, you know them crooked vultures never lie
Oh you know they never lie hahaâ¦

Whatever makes you feel alright
Whatever gets you through the night
Whatever makes you feel alright
Whatever gets you, gets you through the night alright alright

[Solo]

Whatever makes you feel alright
Whatever gets you through the night
Whatever makes you feel alright, whatever whatever

Youâre running round like a big shot
Couldnât get your big head through the door
It isnât anything we havenât seen 10,000 times before.

Whatever makes you feel alright
Whatever gets you through the night baby
Whatever makes you feel alright
Whatever gets you, gets you through the night alright alright
