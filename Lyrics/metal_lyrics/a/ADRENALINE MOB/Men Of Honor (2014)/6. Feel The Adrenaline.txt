Black as night
And bad as hell
Light the tires up
I love that burning smell
I drop that clutch
Just to hear her scream
All the lights turn green
For my illegal street machine

Are you ready for the ride
Grab the wheel and hold on tight
Hit that nitrous suicide
Oh yeah
Feel the rhythm of the road
Let it penetrate your soul
Turn it up
And rock that radio
Now your feeling the adrenaline
Feel the adrenaline
Come on
Can you feel the adrenaline
Are you feeling the adrenaline

Sheâs running hot
Iâve lost control
Cranking ZZ Top
On the radio
I love that rock and roll

Are you ready for the ride
Grab the wheel and hold on tight
Hit that nitrous suicide
Oh yeah
Feel the rhythm of the road
Let it penetrate your soul
Turn it up
And rock that radio
Now your feeling the adrenaline
Feel the adrenaline
Come on
Can you feel the adrenaline
Are you feeling the adrenaline

[solo]

Ghost flames running down her sides
Tuned up lean and mean
She looks so fine in her chrome shine
Sipping on gasoline
Sheâs just a
Show stopping
Jaw dropping
Purring as she rolls on by
She looks so good with her top rolled down
Oh my, my
I canât get enough
I
Wanna take her for a ride
Oh I canât get enough
I
Wanna take her for a ride
Oh I canât get enough
Oh heah
You know I canât get enough
Oh yeah
You know I canât get enough

Are you ready for the ride
Grab the wheel and hold on tight
Hit that nitrous suicide
Oh yeah
Feel the rhythm of the road
Let it penetrate your soul
Turn it up
And crank that radio
Now your feeling the adrenaline
Come on
Are you feeling the adrenaline
Come on
Are you feeling the adrenaline
Come on
Are you feeling the adrenaline
