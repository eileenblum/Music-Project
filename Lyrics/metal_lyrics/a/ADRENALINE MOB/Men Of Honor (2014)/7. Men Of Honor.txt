How dare you
Turn on me turn on me
I know you
Turn on me donât turn on me
I won you
Tread on me donât tread on me
Now let me blow your figgin mind

Do you remember
Whatcha said whatch said to me
Do you remember
Let me refresh your fuckin memory
You took an oath
Are you insane can you explain
Or have you lost your goddamn mind

Blood is burning
The saints are crying
Have you forgot who and what you are
You gave me your word
We swore allegiance
Donât turn your back on who and what we are

Let it burn let it burn
Itâs on your soul
Let it burn just let it burn
Cause they control
Feel the heat youâll feel the heat
Yeah, like a dog theyâll hunt you down

Do you remember
What was said what was breed in you
Do you remember
You signed the line so give the devil his due
You took an oath
Nowhere to run nowhere to hide
Theyâre gonna take you down

Blood is burning
The saints are crying
Have you forgot who and what you are
You gave me your word
We swore allegiance
Donât turn your back on who and what we are

Blood is burning
The saints are crying
Have you forgot who and what you are
You gave me your word
We swore allegiance
Donât turn your back on who and what we are
