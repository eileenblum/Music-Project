Why canât you ever just let anything go
Donât you know that the past is the past
You fight your feeling you heat your blood up
Donât you know that you canât go back

So just take all your demons
Donât give them a reason
Donât let them control your mind
Cause they are the problem
So what will it take
What will it take for you to just let it go

The past is the past
Let it go
The past is the past
Let it go

Why canât you ever just let sleeping dogs lie
You donât want to wake up the pack
Theyâll eat your heart out
Theyâll lick your blood up
If you feed them theyâll keep coming back

So just take all your demons
Donât give them a reason
Donât let them control your mind
Cause they are the problem
So what will it take
What will it take for you to just let it go

Let it go

So just take all your demons
Donât give them a reason
Donât let them control your mind
Cause they are the problem
So what will it take
What will it take for you to just let it go

The past is the past
Let it go
The past is the past
Let it go
The past is the past
Let it go
The past is the past
Let it go
