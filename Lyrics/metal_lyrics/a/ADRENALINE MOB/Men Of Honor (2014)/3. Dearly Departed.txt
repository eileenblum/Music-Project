I gave you everything
Took you under my wing
With open arms brought you in the family
You took the life from me
Now youâre my enemy
Soon to be a member of the dearly departed

We were the best of friends
Thought it would never end
I curse the day they said youâre selling me out
Now everybodyâs heard
Youâre singing like a bird
Spilling all your guts like a dirty rat

When itâs time to die
You can cry your heart out when youâre lying face down
The cards they never lie, donât tell me that youâre sorry
Cause no one else is sorrier than me

Whatever happens to the person that I once knew
You always had my back when all the bullets were flying
You know we had it all but I wonât take the fall
Iâll never turn my back on the ones who love me

When itâs time to die
You can cry your heart out when youâre lying face down
The cards they never lie, donât tell me that youâre sorry
Cause no one else is sorrier than me

When itâs time to die
You can cry your heart out when youâre lying face down
The cards they never lie, donât tell me that youâre sorry
Cause no one else is sorrier than me
No oneâs sorrier than me
No oneâs sorrier than me
No oneâs sorrier than me
