I heard you took one in the face
In your face
I heard you took one in the face (come on get up)
Come on get up
In your face (come on get up)
Come on, stand up!

There you lie, crucified
Now you're looking like the hulk
Just knocked you out
You're torn up, you're beat down
Damn, you're looking like the dog just dragged you out

So you took one in the face (come on get up)
And get your ass back in the game
So you took one in the face
Stop acting like the world owes you
Cause it don't owe you a thing

This is the bed you made
You got one foot in the grave
And you're slowly dying
Now here's where you make your stand
Cause your life is in your hands
And there's no denying
So quit your crying

I heard you took one in the face (come on get up)
Come on get up
In your face (come on get up)
Come on, man up!

Take a shot, whatcha got
Stop reaching for the sky
And hit the wall
Get in the ring, take a swing
Stop acting like a bitch
And grow some balls

This is the bed you made
You got one foot in the grave
And you're slowly dying
Now here's where you make your stand
Cause your life is in your hands
And there's no denying
Now quit your crying

So you took one in the face (come on get up)
Come on get up
In your face (come on get up)
Come on, stand up!

Get up!
Get up!
Get up!
Come, stand up!

This is the bed you made
You got one foot in the grave
And you're slowly dying
Now here's where you make your stand
Cause your life is in your hands
And there's no denying
You gotta keep on trying

Your life is what's at stake
You got one more chance to make or break
And there's no denying
You gotta keep on fighting

I heard you took one in the face (come on get up)
Come on get up
In your face (come on get up)
Come on, man up!
