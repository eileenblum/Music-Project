Say goodbye to yesterday
What doesnât matter anyway
All I had was washed away but thatâs the way it goes
Spend my time building walls just to sit around and watch them fall
So damn hard when you lose it all but thatâs the way it goes
Deep in a hole and Iâm so far down and heaven is just so far away
Iâm reaching out can you hear me shout
Here I am come and take me away

Sometimes you want to go
Sometimes you gotta fly
Sometimes you want to just lay down and die
When it feels like your lifeâs fallinâ to pieces
All alone, lost in time, there you sit and slowly lose your mind
And it feels like your lifeâs fallinâ to pieces
Wo yeah

People spend when money flows
Easy come and easy go
Now how the hell was I supposed to know but thatâs the way it goes
Now people think Iâm out of touch, huh
I hear they say I drink and smoke too much
Well I donât care cause I donât judge and thatâs the way I roll
You spend your whole life building dreams
Just to have it taken away
You build your castle brick by brick just to watch it crumble away

Sometimes you wanna go
Sometimes you gotta fly
Sometimes you want to just lay down and die
When it feels like your lifeâs fallinâ to pieces
All alone, lost in time, there you sit and slowly lose your mind
And it feels like your lifeâs fallinâ to pieces
Wo yeah

Sometimes you wanna go
Sometimes you wanna fly
Sometimes you want to just lay down and die
When it feels like your lifeâs fallinâ to pieces
All alone, lost in time, there you sit and slowly lose your mind
And it feels like your lifeâs fallinâ to pieces
Wo yeah
Wo yeah

Feels like Iâm fallinâ
Feels like Iâm fallinâ
Feels like Iâm fallinâ
Feels like Iâm fallinâ, fallinâ
Iâm feeling like Iâm fallinâ to pieces
It feels like Iâm fallinâ, fallinâ
Iâm feeling like Iâm fallinâ to pieces
