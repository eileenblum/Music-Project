Iâm burning on fire
Feeding on my desire
I wanna know every way
You make love
Excite me invite me
Your moves they hypnotize me
I wanna fuck you till you scream
My name out loud â Out loud!

Come on baby drive me crazy
Take me for a ride

Iâm burning get me moving
Letâs get that body grooving
The way you shake
Youâre blowing my mind
You scratch me Iâm bleeding
You got my demon screaming
You can tie me up all night and torture me â Torture me!

Come on baby drive me crazy
Take me for a ride

Here Iâm waiting
In your house of lies
The games youâre playing
You got me hypnotized

Here Iâm waiting
In your house of lies
The games youâre playing
You got me hypnotized

Here Iâm waiting
Waiting for the show
Anticipating waiting to explode
