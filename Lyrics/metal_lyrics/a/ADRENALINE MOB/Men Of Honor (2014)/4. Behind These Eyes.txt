You ever feel like youâve lost yourself
Hiding behind a lie theyâll never find you
Youâve always lived your life just like you were someone else
You never gave what you had to give
And love was like a drug and you refused to take it
I believe that itâs time for me to let it show

Hiding behind these eyes
Lies the soul of a broken man
And now I realize
And I finally understand
Oh can you save me
Iâm begging tonight cause Iâm losing this fight
Can you save me
Cause I donât want to be
Just a memory

I never needed anybody else
I never needed anyone to tell me
I believed I could bide my time by never letting go
So many years filled with lonely days
Way down the line I feel my heart is breaking
And I believe itâs time for me to let you know

Hiding behind these eyes
Lies the soul of a broken man
And now I realize
I finally understand
Oh can you save me
Iâm begging tonight cause Iâm losing this fight
Can you save me
Cause I donât want to be
Just a memory

You are the one you are my one and only
Never alone you know youâre always with me
Iâm falling harder every time Iâm with you
When weâre apart youâre on my mind I miss you
Want you to know that I would never hurt you
Want you to know that I will not desert you
Iâll say it time and again

Hiding behind these eyes
Lies the soul of a broken man
And now I realize
And I finally understand
Oh can you save me
Iâm begging tonight cause Iâm losing this fight
Can you save me
Cause I donât want to be
Just a memory

Hiding behind these eyes
Lies the soul of a broken man
And now I realize
And I finally understand
Oh can you save me
Iâm down on my knees Iâm begging you please
Wonât you save me
Cause I donât want to be
Just a memory
