Give to me
What I want
I want to hear you say
What I need
This is a last chance circumstance
Time to pay the big advance
So while youâre down on your knees

Now you better listen up
What I say you better give it up
Time to pay
Youâre gonna bite the bullet feel the bat
Be begging for a heart attack
Youâre borrowed now you canât repay
Collection on your judgment day

No one can save you
Now youâre gonna pay
Collection on your judgment day

You took from me - Yeah
Youâre gonna give me everything that I need
You took a last chance circumstance
You went and blew youâre your big advance
And now youâre down on your knees

You better listen up
What I say you went and lived it up
Now ya pay
Youâre gonna bite the bullet feel the bat
Be begging for a heart attack
Youâre borrowed now you canât repay
Collection on your judgment day

No one can save you
Now youâre gonna die
Itâs time to make your last wish
Itâs time to say goodbye

âForgive you notâ¦ Yea youâve sinned.
The time has come now get in.
You couldnât pay I bought your debt.
And Iâm taking you to your grave.â

No one can save you
Now youâre gonna die
Itâs time to make your last wish
Itâs time to say goodbye
No one can save you
Now youâre gonna pay
Collection on your judgment day
Collection on your judgment day
