I watch the waves upon the water, searching for a reason
But I know it isn't there (Know it isn't there, know it isn't there)
And so I struggle with the meaning, despite of all this feelings
I know it isn't fair (Know it isn't fair, know it isn't fair)

So I lay awake, hope and pray
The emptiness I feel inside would just go away
But it's plain to see, what's killing me
I realised that I not afraid to love you

Despite of all the reasons, despite of all the pain
I know you were always there
Through all the changing seasons, through all the good and bad
I know you were always there
I just couldn't see it, now it's crystal clear
Where do I go from here?

I hear it echoing like thunder
Blanking my memories, of all my yesterdays
And still I struggle with the meaning, despite of all this feelings
To tell who's to blame

So I lay awake, hope and pray
The emptiness I feel inside would just go away
But it's plain to see, what's killing me
I realised how much I really need you

Despite of all the reasons, despite of all the pain
I know you were always there
Through all the changing seasons, through all the good and bad
I know you were always there
I just couldn't see it, now it's crystal clear
Where do I go from here?
Where do I go from here?

I'm standing out here in the rain, feeling like a fool again
Stuck in the life I'm leading, feeling like a love life beaten
Don't leave me out here in the cold, don't make me walk alone a lonely road

So I lay awake, hope and pray
The emptiness I feel inside would just go away
But it's plain to see, what's killing me
I realised how much I really miss you

Despite of all the reasons, despite of all the pain
I know you were always there
Through all the changing seasons, through all the good and bad
I know you were always there
I just couldn't see it, now it's crystal clear
Where do I go from here?
Where do I go from here?
