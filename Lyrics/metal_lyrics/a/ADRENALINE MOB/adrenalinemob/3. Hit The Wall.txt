Heavy is my heart but it's alright
We all know you're never wrong
It's always the same and i'm so tired
Living the life for too long

Tired, frustrated
This life is overrated
I think i'm hitting the wall
Tired, can't take it
Full speed, i think i'll make it
I think i'm hitting the wall

Line after line, it just drags on
Why can't you leave it alone?
Blistering tongues, blood in my ears
Drowning in your sticks and stones

Tired, frustrated
This life is overrated
I think i'm hitting the wall
Tired, can't take it
Full speed, i think i'll make it
I think i'm hitting the wall

I see the river running red
Inside my head through bloodshot eyes
And comes the thunder
Running through the metal madness

Tired, frustrated
This life is overrated
I think i'm hitting the wall
Tired, can't take it
Full speed, i think i'll make it
I think i'm hitting the wall

I'm looking down upon his wreck of a life
The voice of angels whispered, "leave it all behind"
I'm stepping through the door
No going back
Can't take it anymore
Memories fade into black
Memories fade to black
Fade to black
