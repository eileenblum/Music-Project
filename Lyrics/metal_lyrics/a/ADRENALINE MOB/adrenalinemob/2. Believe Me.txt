Oh, come on
You can't undo what is done
Can't live your life on the run
There is no turning back
You can't rescind it

You know you strayed from the path
You lost control of your raft
This time you can't take back the things that you've said

Believe me
You know i've been down this road before
Believe me
It hurts me to tear you up
To bring you down to the floor

Take a good look around
You are the man with the crown
The righteous self-appointed king of nothing

Have you lost your self respect?
Your demon to resurrect
It happens every time
You just don't get it

Believe me
You know i've been down this road before
Believe me
It hurts me to tear you up
To bring you down to the floor
Believe me
Oh, to you i'd never lie
Believe me
You only get one more chance
Don't let it pass you by

Oh can you hear my words?
I'm just trying to help you find your way

Believe me
You know i've been down this road before
Believe me
It hurts me to tear you up
To bring you down to the floor
Believe me
Oh, to you i'd never lie
Believe me
You only get one more chance
Don't let it pass you by
