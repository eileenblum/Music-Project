You're the one who made up my mind
I've searched for an answer that's so hard to find
Those lonely long nights left me feeling so empty inside
And you're the one who burned me time and again
I sat back and watched all the damage you did
Resurrected stolen memories you've taken from my life

I wish I could see through your eyes
Fly through the angel sky
Fly so high spread your wings and try
Fly away to a different place in time,
Won't you fly away

Take this weight from these sad wings of flight
Soaring through the heavens looking down on my life
So empty, painful, misery, take it all away from me

I wish I could see through your eyes
Fly through the angel sky
Fly so high spread your wings and try
Fly away to a different place in time,
Won't you fly away

I'd never leave you lonely,
Cause in my heart you've owned me
You were the one, the only one
The one who really knows me
It's not the lies you're saying, 
It's not the games you're playing
It's that you said you loved me then you up and walked away
It's that you said you loved me then you up and walked away

So you could...

Fly high to the angel sky
Fly so high spread your wings to try
Fly away to a different place in time,
Won't you fly away

Fly high to the angel sky
Fly so high spread your wings to try
Fly away to a different place in time,
Won't you fly away

Fly away!
