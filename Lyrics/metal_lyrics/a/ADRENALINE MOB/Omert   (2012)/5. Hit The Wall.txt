Heavy is my heart but it's alright
We all know you're never wrong
It's always the same and I'm so tired
Living the lie far too long

Tired, frustrated
This life is overrated
I think I'm hitting the wall
Tired, can't take it
Full speed, I think I'll make it
I think I'm hitting the wall

Line after line, it just drags on
Why can't you leave it alone?
Blistering tongues burning my ears
Drowning in your sticks and stones

Tired, frustrated
This life is overrated
I think I'm hitting the wall
Tired, can't take it
Full speed, I think I'll make it
I think I'm hitting the wall

Go!

I see the river running red inside my head through bloodshot eyes
Echoes of thunder running through the metal madness as I ride

[Solo]

Tired, frustrated
This life is overrated
I think I'm hitting the wall
Tired, can't take it
Full speed, I think I'll make it
I think I'm hitting the wall

I'm looking down upon this wreck of a life
The voice of angels whisper, "Leave it all behind"
I'm stepping through the door
No going back
Can't take it anymore
Memories fade to black
Memories fade to black.
Fade to black
All my memories fade to black

All my sorrows
My tomorrows
Fade to black
Fade to black
