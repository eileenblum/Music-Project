Top fuel, reckless drivin'
Non-stop, methane flyin'
Revved and ready to go

I purge the nitrous, gears rippin'
Steel fist, power trippin'
I'm ready to explode
Stage, Light, Tree jumpin'
Hearts race, fist pumpin'
Revved and ready to go

White knuckles, brow beatin'
Knees buckle, crowd screamin'
I'm ready to explode

One, Stage, Two, Set, Three, Lights, Four

I feel the wind breakin', tires shakin'
I feel the earth quakin'
Come on give it some more

I got the line lock in, tires rockin'
I hear your motor knockin'
I'll take you down, down to the floor

Straight line, tunnel-vision
Prime-time television
Revved and ready to go

I bleed the brake line, hands shakin'
Red light, sweat breakin'
I'm ready to explode

One, Stage, Two, Set, Three, Lights, Four

I feel the wind breakin', tires shakin'
I feel the earth quakin'
Come on give it some more

I got the line lock in, tires rockin'
I hear your motor knockin'
I'll take you down

I feel the wind breakin', tires shakin'
I feel the earth quakin'
Come on give it some more, more, more

I got the line lock in, tires rockin'
I hear your motor knockin'
I'll take you down, down to the floor

[Solo]

Pure adrenaline pumpin' through my veins
I can't slow down, out of my way
Fuel injection is burnin' 108
You drop the flag, I hammer down
I'm on my way

Pure adrenaline pumpin' through my veins
I can't slow down, out of my way
Fuel injection is burnin' 108
You drop the flag, I hammer down
Down to the floor

[Outro]
