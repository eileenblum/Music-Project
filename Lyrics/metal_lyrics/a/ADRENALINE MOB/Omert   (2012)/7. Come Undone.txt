[originally by Duran Duran][Russell]
Mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin
I've been waiting for you
Signed, with a home tattoo,
Happy birthday to you was created for you

[Lzzy]
Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams
Can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces

[Russell]
Oh, it'll take a little time,
Might take a little crime
To come undone now

[Russell]
We'll try to stay blind
[Lzzy]
To the hope and fear outside
[Russell]
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into cry

[Both]
Who do you need, who do you love
[Russell]
When you come undone?
[Both]
Who do you need, who do you love
[Russell]
When you come undone?

[Russell]
Words, playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune I swear I've heard before
Chill, is it something real
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers?

[Lzzy]
Can not keep from falling apart at the seams
Can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces

[Russell]
Lost, in a snow filled sky,
We'll make it alright
To come undone now

[Russell]
We'll try to stay blind
[Lzzy]
To the hope and fear outside
[Russell]
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into cry

[Both]
Who do you need, who do you love
[Russell]
When you come undone?
[Both]
Who do you need, who do you love
[Russell]
When you come undone?

[Both]
Who do you need, who do you love
[Russell]
When you come undone?
[Lzzy]
Can not keep from falling apart
[Both]
Who do you need, who do you love
[Russell]
When you come undone?
[Lzzy]
Can not believe you're taking my heart
[Both]
When you come undone
[Lzzy]
Can not keep from falling apart
[Russell]
When you come undone?
[Lzzy]
Can not believe you're taking my heart
[Russell]
When you come undone?
When you come undone?
