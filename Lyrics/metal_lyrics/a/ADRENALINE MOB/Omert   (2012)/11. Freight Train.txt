Rollin' down the line
Heavy is the load
Engine hissin' steam
Lord I'm two miles long
Oh yeah!

Mountain in my way
Sparks are flyin' high
Into the darkness I go
Holding my head high
Oh yeah!

Freight train rollin'
Ya keep on rollin'
Freight train goin'
All night
Freight train rollin'
Ya keep on goin'
Rollin' down the line

Freight train rollin'
Ya keep on rollin'
Freight train rollin'
All night
Freight train rollin'
Ya keep on goin'
Rollin' down the line

[Solo]

Engine 'bout to blow
I'm in overdrive
Straight down the barrel I go
Lord I see the light

Freight train rollin'
Ya keep on rollin'
Freight train goin'
All night
Freight train rollin'
Ya keep on goin'
Rollin' down the line

Freight train rollin'
Ya keep on rollin'
Freight train rollin'
All night
Freight train rollin'
Ya keep on goin'
Rollin' down the line
