Looking back on my life
It doesn't seem to be very clear
When I lost my fear
I live my life
Taking my chances

Staring down at my reflection
Sometimes I feel like I lost my mind
It's a waste of time
I'm asking you
But I never get an answer

I'm falling in
I'm falling out walking the straight and narrow
I'm falling in
I'm falling right out
I'm breaking down again

I never thought you'd hear me say
I'm better now
So I don't need your sympathies
I'm taking this life day by day
To be indifferent,
indifferent

I never thought you'd hear me say
I'm better now
No, I'm nobody's tragedy
I'm taking this life day by day
To be indifferent,
I'm indifferent

As I turn to look to the future
I see my life in a different way
It's a brand new day
A stretch of road
Unscathed and untaken

The only thing on my mind
is leaving this place so far behind
'cause it's my time
I'll find a better way
to keep myself from breaking

I'm falling in
I'm falling out walking the straight and narrow
I'm falling in
Then I'm falling right out
I'm breaking down again

I never thought you'd hear me say
I'm better now
So I don't need your sympathies
I'm taking this life day by day
To be indifferent,
indifferent

I never thought you'd hear me say
I'm better now
No I'm nobody's tragedy
I'm taking this life day by day
To be indifferent,
I'm indifferent

[Solo]

I never thought you'd hear me say
I'm better now
So I don't need your sympathies
I'm taking this life day by day
To be indifferent,
indifferent

I never thought you'd hear me say
I'm better now
No, I'm nobody's tragedy
I'm taking this life day by day
To be indifferent,
I'm indifferent

I'm indifferent
I'm indifferent
