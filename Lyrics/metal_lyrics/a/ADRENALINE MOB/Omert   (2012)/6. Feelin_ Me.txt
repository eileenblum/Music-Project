They're killin' me slow
All the lies they're feedin'
The system's breakin' me down

It seems like everyday
Another life lies bleedin'
While you're just standing around

Oh what would you do
When it all falls down on you
And you can't walk away

I'm gonna stand up and fight
Gonna knockout the sky
Cause I don't give a shit
You mother fuckers feelin' me?

Are you mother fuckers feelin' me?

They know the games you playin'
Every word you're sayin'
They always know where you are

They gotcha locked down
Watchin' every goddamn move you're makin'
They got you right by the balls

You're all lined up
Spoon fed
Wound up
Walking dead
You're just a leaf on a tree

I'm gonna stand up and fight
Gonna knockout the sky
Cause I don't give a shit
You mother fuckers feelin' me?

Are you mother fuckers feelin' me?
Come on!
Are you mother fuckers feelin' me?
You fucking feelin' me?

You have been foresaken
I have been foresaken
We have been foresaken

[solo]

Are you mother fuckers feelin' me?
Are you mother fuckers feelin' me?
Come on!
Are you mother fuckers feelin' me?
You fucking feelin' me?

You have been foresaken
I have been foresaken
We have been foresaken
