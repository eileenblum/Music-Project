You're all up in my face.
You think this is your place.
You wannabe!

You're running your big mouth.
You're gonna get knocked out.
You wannabe!

You're stepping on my line
And I rock it big time
You wannabe!

Don't think you can beat me
You'll never defeat me
You're pushing me!

You wannabe!
I stand undaunted.
You're gonna see
I am undaunted.

Yeah!

Don't think you can shake me
'cause you'll never break me
You wannabe!

You only get one round
It's time for the takedown
You wannabe!

You're talking the big talk
But I walk the big walk
You wannabe!

You'll never forget me
You'll live to regret me
You're pushing me!

You wannabe!
I stand undaunted.
You're gonna see
I am undaunted.

Just walk away
Don't you look at me
Listen what I say
You're just a wannabe!

Just walk away
Don't you look at me
Listen what I say
No fear inside of me!

[Mike Orlano's solo]

I stand undaunted
You're gonna see
I am undaunted
Don't look back, just walk away

I stand undaunted
You wannabe
I am undaunted.
