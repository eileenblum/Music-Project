I feel I'm not the same
I'm alive but something's changed
Like every leaf that is falling to the ground
It's still alive but not the same

These are the times we all feel pain
A helping hand would be nice to feel again
For a simple man who's down on his knees
I'm begging you please
Won't you help me understand

Come on and shine your light on me
I need a friend to help me see

Cause everytime I open my eyes
I know I don't want to wake up and make the same mistakes
It happens to me all the time
If I lie I lose it all
If I stand or if I fall
I've got to lay it all on the line

I see a child at play
I feel her stuggle through each and everyday
Even though I know that you're miles away
I'm just dying to hear you say "hello"

I get so lost in my disease
I'm missing precious memories

Every time I open my eyes
I know I don't want to wake up and make the same mistakes
It happens to me all the time
If I lie I lose it all
If I stand or if I fall
I've got to lay it all on the line

And I swear this time I'll get it right
And I swear this time I'm gonna lay 
it all out on the line, on the line

[Solo]

Oh we get so lost
In what to be's
We live and die
We try to please

But everytime I open my eyes
I know I don't want to wake up and make the same mistakes
It happens to me all the time
If I lie I lose it all
If I stand or if I fall
I've got to lay it all on the line
