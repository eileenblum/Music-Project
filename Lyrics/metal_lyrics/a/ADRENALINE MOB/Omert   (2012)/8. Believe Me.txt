Oh, come on

You can't undo what is done
Can't live your life on the run
There is no turning back
You can't raise the dead

You know you strayed from the path
You lost control of your wrath
This time you can't take back the things that you said

Believe me
You know I've been down this road before
Believe me
It hurts me to tear you up
To bring you down to the core

Take a good look around
You are the man with the crown
A righteous, self-appointed, king of nothing

Have you lost your self-respect?
Your demons you resurrect
It happens every time
You just don't get it

Believe me
You know I've been down this road before
Believe me
It hurts me to tear you up
To bring you down to the core
Believe me,
Oh, to you I'd never lie
Believe me
You only get one more chance
Don't let it pass you by

[Solo]

Oh can you hear my words?
I'm just trying to help you find your way

Believe me
You know I've been down this road before
Believe me
It hurts me to tear you up
To bring you down to the core
Believe me,
Oh, to you I'd never lie
Believe me
You only get one more chance
Don't let it pass you by
