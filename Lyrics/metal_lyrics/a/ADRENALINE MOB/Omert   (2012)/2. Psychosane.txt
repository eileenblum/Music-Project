Open wide and welcome in the storm
We've arrived to lay it down in stone
Here we stand, our blood's on fire

Let the river flow out of control
Into a twisted state of mind
Put you six feet down and watch you drown
As we bury you alive

Heavy thunder blows my mind
Knocks me senseless all the time
The sound, the lights, the screams
I hear them melt my brain
Lord I'm going psychosane

Open wide and let the thunder roll
La famiglia feel it in your soul
As soldiers we stand
We'll walk the wire

Let the river flow out of control
Into a twisted state of mind
Put you six feet down and watch you drown
As we bury you alive

Heavy thunder blows my mind
Knocks me senseless all the time
The sound, the lights, the screams
I hear them melt my brain
Lord I'm going psychosane

Going psychosane motherfucking psychosane
Going psychosane motherfucking psychosane
Going psychosane motherfucking psychosane
Going psychosane motherfucking psychosane

[Solo]

Let the river flow out of control
Into a twisted state of mind
Put you six feet down and watch you drown
As we bury you alive

Heavy thunder blows my mind
Knocks me senseless all the time
The sound, the lights, the screams
I hear them melt my brain
Lord I'm going psychosane

Psychosane
Lord I'm going psychosane
