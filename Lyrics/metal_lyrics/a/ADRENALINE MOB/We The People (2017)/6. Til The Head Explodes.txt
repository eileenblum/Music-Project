You're moving mountains
I better step aside
You're like a crazy train
You're running out of control
Your mind's in overdrive
Those gears are turning
They're working overtime
It never stops

[2x]
All the fear â all the hate â all the lies
It will eat you alive!

You've gotta take time to realize
That life's just a game
You better slow down and turn around
You're gonna keep on pushing yourself to the limit
And drive it 'til the head explodes!

The cracks are showing
Your engines losing steam
You're running way too hard
You're running way too fast
You're losing gasoline
Big heart is racing
You're gonna flat line
You're gonna hit the wall
You're gonna lose it all
You can't chase the storm or it will eat you alive!
No you can't chase the storm or it will eat you alive!

You've gotta take time to realize
That life's just a game
You better slow down and turn around
You're gonna keep on pushing yourself to the limit
And drive it 'til the head explodes!

And drive it 'til the head explodes!

[Solo: Mike Orlando]

Take time to realize
That life's just a game
You better slow down and turn around
You're gonna keep on pushing yourself to the limit...
And drive it 'til the head explodes!

And drive it 'til the head explodes!
You're gonna drive it 'til the head explodes!
