[Backing vocals: Mike Orlando]

In a land of thieves and liars
In a land of dead empires
In a land of seeded greed
In a land where everyone's consuming
And the leaders are choking
Evil words are spoken
What is this world coming to

It feels like we're falling again
Against them there's no way to win...
No!

We the people in the herd
We the people believe every word
We the people, why can't you see
We the people, media democracy sensationalized
Then the bullets fly
Then so somebody dies
Why can't we just get along

It feels like we're falling again
Against them there's no way to win...
No!

[Solo: Mike Orlando]

It feels like we're falling again
We the people [2x]
Against them there's no way to win
We the people [2x]
It feels like we're falling again
We the people [2x]
Against them there's no way to win
No!

We the people [4x]
