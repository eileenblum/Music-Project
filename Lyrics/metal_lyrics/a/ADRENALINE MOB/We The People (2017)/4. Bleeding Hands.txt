I've traveled along this highway
I've been running for so long
Looking back is not my way
But I've been thinking about my home...
About my home.

All of the places that I've been to
All of the people I knew so well
They dwell in the shadows of my past life
Their faces I see through my bleeding hands

I never thought of slowing down
Till life just passed me by
Riding high and then I hit the ground
And shattered to pieces

I turn around
And deal with the pain
From the years that I've locked deep in my mind
I turn around and see all the places
And faces that I've left behind
All the things that I've done wrong
I have to let go...
I have to let go...

I had a good life in my hometown
Yea it was back in the good old days
All of the places that I'd run to
Now only memories remain
Lost in the ashes all around me
Watching it all go up in flames

I never thought of slowing down
Till life just passed me by
Riding high and then I hit the ground
And shattered to pieces

I turn around
And deal with the pain
From the years that I've locked deep in my mind
I turn around and see all the places
And faces that I've left behind
All the things that I've done wrong
I have to let go...
I have to let go...

[Solo: Mike Orlando]

Flying high and then I realized
How far I am from home
Flying high I almost touched the sky...

And shattered to pieces

I turn around
And deal with the pain
From the years that I've locked deep in my mind
I turn around and see all the places
And faces that I've left behind
All the things that I've done wrong
I have to let go...
I have to let go...
