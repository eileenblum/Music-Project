[Instrumental intro]

Walking the streets in the dead of night
Under a moonlit sky
Hungry for blood to feed his appetite
He's got the look of death in his eyes
He sees his victims as a parasite
Something he must remove
He likes to serve them up the devils dish
Leading his prey to the killing room

Nobody's safe when darkness falls
As the city sleeps...

There's a killer running wild
Lurking in the shadows - creeping past your window
He's sharpening the knife
In his dark twisted mind

There's a killer running wild
Waiting for his moment - watching every movement
You're paralyzed with fright
And there's no where to hide, hide, hide
The killer's inside

He's undeniable a superstar
He's on the evening news
They try to figure out what makes him tick
He's sitting there plotting his next move
Wrapping his fingers tight around their throats
Nobody hears the screams
Removing pieces for his trophy room
His work of art making history

Nobody's safe when darkness falls
As the city sleeps...

There's a killer running wild
Lurking in the shadows - creeping past your window
He's sharpening the knife
In his dark twisted mind

[Solo: Mike Orlando]

Nobody's safe when darkness falls
As the city sleeps...

There's a killer running wild
Lurking in the shadows - creeping past your window
He's sharpening the knife
In his dark twisted mind

The killers inside - whoa ohoh - the killers inside [2x]
