Look at yourself 
Face to face
Through the cracks
And you want to chase the dragon
Want to taste that drug
And feel that rush again

Wide awake
Staring at the ceiling
Anther drink should get you through the night
And you're praying for a savior
And I'm knocking, I'm knocking at your door

You look surprised as hell
To see this ugly face
Well, did you think that I would greet you with a smile?
Now tell me, friend, did you think I wouldn't find you?
Oh, and by the way, I've been here all the while

So here we are
You and I
The time has come to say goodbye
So you wound up chasing dragons
Over mountains flying high
But they left you, they left you here to die

Promises, well, you know they never keep them
So you just pretend that everything's alright
Was it childhood or the never-ending screaming?or the hurtful lies told by friends you never had?

So here we are
You and I
The time has come to say goodbye
So you wound up chasing dragons
Over mountains flying high
But they left you, they left you here to die

So here we are
You and I
The time has come to say goodbye
So you wound up chasing dragons
Over mountains flying high
But they left you, they left you here to die

They left you here to die
They left you here to die, whoa
They left you here to die
