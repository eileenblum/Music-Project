Walking tall towards the ring tell yourself to get ready
Clinch your fists take a breath shits about to get heavy
Keep running your mouth
Keep running your mouth
You don't know what you just started
Keep running your mouth
Keep running your mouth
You don't know just what you're in for

I am king of these roped walls and in this ring of fire you will burn
Feel the wrath the hate the weight my world upon your shoulders
You will feel the hurt
I will make you crawl

Here we go blow by blow
Get 'em up and get ready
Feel the sting hit by hit
Throwing punches so deadly

Keep running your mouth
Keep running your mouth
I'm gonna finish what you started
Stop moving around
Stop moving around
Toe to toe and face to face now

I am king of these roped walls and in this ring of fire you will burn
Feel the wrath the hate the weight my world upon your shoulders
You will feel the hurt
I will make you crawl

Look where I stand don't you know who I am
I'm the good I'm the bad
I'm the champion
I am the fight
I am wrong I am right
I'm the fear I'm the hate
I'm a friend I'm a foe

I am king of these roped walls and in this ring of fire you will burn
Feel the wrath the hate the weight my world upon your shoulders
You will feel the hurt
I will make you crawl
