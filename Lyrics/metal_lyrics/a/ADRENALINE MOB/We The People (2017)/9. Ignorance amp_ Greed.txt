[Backing vocals: Mike Orlando]

Heavy tides upon me
Calm before the storm
Sixty feet above me
Do ya hear the sound all around

Everyone down below
You know when the shit starts to rise
We feed their worthless needs
The murders and thieves
They got us down on our knees... Yeah!

All these chains that bind us
Given to us long ago
If you want to find the dirty players
Just look in their eyes see all the lies

And it's driving me insane
This dog and pony show yeah
Feels the need for greed
They're out to make us bleed
They're all rotten to the core!

Ignorance and greed
Oh give me what I need
Today's society
Breeds ignorance and greed

All the kings are burning
Country's lit up we're on fire
One by one ten by ten we fall
Just crucify me crucify me

[Solo: Mike Orlando]

Ignorance and greed
Oh give me what I need
Today's society
Breeds ignorance and greed

What will you do
What will you do
When they come they come for you [6x]
