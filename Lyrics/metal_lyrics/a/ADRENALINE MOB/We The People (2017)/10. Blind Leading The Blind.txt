[Russell Allen and Mike Orlando:]
Is this the blind leading the blind
Hand and hand to paradise
I see right through their thin disguise
Believe the truth that they deny
It's the blind leading the blind

We all eat the lies that have been fed
We don't see the scripts that have been read
They don't think we know what's wrong or right
No one can say what's on their minds
They're the blind leading the blind

I fear the visions that they preach
I hear no wisdom in their speech
We are the fools who sympathize
Constantly craving paradise
We're the blind leading the blind

We all share the feelings of despair
Do you see the smoke rise through the air
The world is running out of time
We all think we know what's wrong or right
It's the blind leading the blind

I see it all go up in flames
I hear a world cry out in pain
We are the fools who sympathize
Constantly craving paradise
We're the blind leading the blind

[Solo: Mike Orlando]

I fear the visions that they preach
I hear no wisdom in their speech
We are the fools who sympathize
Constantly craving paradise
We're the blind leading the blind

The blind leading the blind
We all think we know
We all think we know
We're just the blind leading the blind

They're all reaching for that golden ring
And we're just puppets on a string
We all think we know
We all think we know
But nobody knows!
