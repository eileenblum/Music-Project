We all wanna live the life
Live free to do what we like
Now take me up to the sky
And give me my slice of the pie

Everybody raise your hands in the air
Raise em up like you just don't care
Everybody raise your hands in the air
Get em up throw em in the air
And wave em around like you just don't care

We all wanna be a star
And drive big fancy cars... Yeah
It's time we all get our turn
Now give us more money to
Burning it up and we're taking it all
Burning it up and we're having a ball

Everybody raise your hands in the air
Raise em up like you just don't care
Everybody raise your hands in the air
Get em up throw em in the air
And wave em around like you just don't care

And wave em around like you just don't care [2x]

[Solo: Mike Orlando]

Everybody raise your hands in the air
Raise em up like you just don't care
Everybody raise your hands in the air
Get em up throw em in the air

Everybody raise your hands in the air
Raise em up like you just don't care
Everybody raise your hands in the air
Get em up throw em in the air
And wave em around like you just don't care

Burning it up and we're taking it all
Burning it up and we're having a ball
