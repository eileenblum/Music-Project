[Orchestrated intro: Russell Allen]

The chase is on across the midnight blue
She's running hard and fast and bearing down on you
Got you dead in my sights and there's nowhere left to run
Prepare for a fight raise your swords and load the guns

Surrender now no quarter we'll give
And no quarter we desire
Prepare to open fire

All hail the lords of thunder
On the wind of the gods
All hail the lords of thunder
We take what we want

Life's a game of chance so what's it going to be
You can die today or you can join with me
Son let your voice be heard and tell us where you stand
We value the word of each and every man

So make your mark
And take what you can
In this short but merry life
Sing until the day we die... Yeah

[2x]
All hail the lords of thunder
On the wind of the gods
All hail the lords of thunder
We take what we want

And we want it all

Oh hit me - light em up - yeah

Oh we are the lords of thunder
We are the lords of thunder
And forever we ride

[Solo: Mike Orlando]

All hail the lords of thunder
On the winds of the gods
All hail the lords of thunder
We take what we want... Yeah

All hail the lords of thunder
On the winds of the gods
All hail the lords of thunder
We take what we want
And we want it all
