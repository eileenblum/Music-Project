[Backing vocals: Mike Orlando]

You tell me to walk then you tell me to run
You tell me to swallow and follow everyone
You give me a choice but you won't let me choose
You won't let me win but you'll never let me lose

And I am done trying to get through to you
I have turned to a violent state of mind
Come on and tell me

What more do you really want (What more)
What more do you want from me
Tell me what you really want (Tell me)
My head is spinning and you're driving me crazy

You tell me to walk when I just hit the ground
You tell me to stand up then you sit me down
You're trying to teach but you don't understand
I'm trying to reach you give your hand cause

I am done lying to myself
Time to turn the pages of my life
Come on and tell me

[2x]
What more do you really want (What more)
What more do you want from me
Tell me what you really want (Tell me)
My head is spinning and you're driving me crazy

[Solo: Mike Orlando]

[2x]
What more do you really want (What more)
What more do you want from me
Tell me what you really want (Tell me)
My head is spinning and you're driving me crazy
