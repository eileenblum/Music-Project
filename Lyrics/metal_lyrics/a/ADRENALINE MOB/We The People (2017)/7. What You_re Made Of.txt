It'll light you up like a firestorm
Burn with rage when you're feeling scorned
They tease they taunt they push you down
They drive you straight to tears

Don't let em fake you shake you
Feel they're gonna break you
Don't let em inside your mind
You need to find your strength
Fight back the fear
You gotta look at em and smile

Stand up and show me what you're made of
And tell em what you need to say
Just stand up and shout it and be all about it
And tell em that you're here to stay

Let them... throw their stones
And their worthless sticks
Hit em back with a ton of bricks
The hurt - the blame - the hate - the shame
It's driving you insane
You gotta keep on swinging
Till the bells are ringing
I wanna hear that sound
You gotta dig down deep inside yourself
Don't let them ever push you around

Stand up and show me what you're made of
And tell em what you need to say
Just stand up and shout it and be all about it
And tell em that you're here to stay

[2x]
Stand up and show me what you're made of
And tell em what you need to say
Just stand up and shout it and be all about it
And tell em that you're here to stay
