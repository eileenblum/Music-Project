Come and join the universe of the Ones
Who create dimensions from emptyness.
They are Spirit when moral standards rule
and Vastness after disillusion.

I am the tragic crying Child who's always been
Plunged in the distress of the world,
Lost in values which are caring the least
About true feelings...

Come into the universe of the ones
who can bring future to a forever lost world
The Symphony's leading us to absolution
for it is oil of Tragedy

They are the foundations
Of every greatness and belief,
Like an eternal torment
leading me far away from you...

I can't believe in your being nothing else
But dullness, naivety and grief.
The Symphony will live in me forever and
Will carry me away from this Chaos.

Come into the universe of the ones who
symbolize the Greatness of a forever lost world
The Symphony will lead us to the Truth
for it is the essence of Tragedy.

Now that everything has turned to ruins
I'm watching you, simple and pathetic man
You are the sun of God's and the Destroyer
and can't make out Reality from Death...

Come into the universe of the Ones who are
nothing but a Requiem to the forever lost world
The Symphony's leading us to Decadence
for it is the Final and Eternal Tragedy

God, Monster, disguised in a true Angel,
You are the drugs, the poison, overcoming me
And controlling the being who lives in despair .
I hate you and will enjoy blasphemy Ad Vitam Eternam !

Let's reject God for he means nothing but Disaster,
Let's reject God for he means nothing but Lie !
Let's feel in ourselves Spirituality at birth
And let's forever hate: Mankind's Shame !
