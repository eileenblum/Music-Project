Your Blood is satisfying the fantasies
Of my impure Soul
Giving birth in my deepest being to
Sensual pleasure and Ultimate Ecstasy...

Watching in your eyes how Life
Is slipping out and so the Hope
of an unlikely and forever
Vanishing Miracle :

Offer me up the sight
Of your Lacerated and Wounded Body and
Let me make my way, invading your Soul, your Heart and let
The shed Blood spoil the last Angels of God
Symbolizing Eternal Triumph for my Vampire Greatness

Taking great delight in each one of your breaths
and in your useless and miserable prayers
To a pathetic God, which I have dethroned for ages
Give up, for resistance is... futile !

Along the Hell of the Night,
I have dragged you, Innocent Soul and
The world of Feelings is now yours
and the Flavour of Blood will be your Guide.

Offer me the Sight
Of your Lacerated and Wounded Body
Let me make my way invading your Soul, your Heart and let
The shed Blood spoil the last Angels of God
Symbolizing Eternal Triumph for my Vampire Greatness

Once mixed the delights of perversion with
The secrets of your sexual insanity
The world will be nothing left but a theater
of your carnal and bloodthirsty Transcendance.

Your Blood is satisfying the fantasies
Of your impure Soul,
Giving birth in my deepest being
To sensual pleasure and Final Ecstasy...
