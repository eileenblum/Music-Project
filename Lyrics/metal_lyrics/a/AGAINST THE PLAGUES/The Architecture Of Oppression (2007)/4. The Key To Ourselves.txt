Vision of a future age
of the world that did not last
Through the global genocide
we release our painful past
Can we breed the world again
on the ashes of our life...?
In the cooling cinder
there appears a virgin tree

(...)

We unite in affinity
We control our own domain
We design our paradise
We avert the prophecies
Tamers of the chaos
Architects of new design
New world weâre forming
as we walk through immortality

The key to ourselves
is to understand the complex
structure of human nature
and desert from the blind

Find the paths through chaos
searching in the world inside!
They will lead you there in depths
insights of your conscious soul

Only those who make themselves free
are the ones who can find the key
to control their own existence

Find the paths through chaos
searching in the world inside!
They will lead you there in depths
insights of your conscious soul

Wisdom of our higher selves!
Guide the way of mind!
Take us to the secret spheres!
Lead us to their shrines!

And the way of the flame is always the same
With its urge and fervor to rise
Progressing, transforming, it flows with a will
Reflects the nature of life

And our future to come is right at our hands
We possess the force to attain
Consider yourself, face all ones more
and conquer the poisons of man!

Find the paths through chaos
searching in the world inside!
They will lead you there in depths
insights of your conscious soul

And then I say onto you
the key will suppress the chaos in oneself
and turn the storm into winds of calmness
