In the age of mind control the eyes are watching you
Utopian measures... Privacy is purged
The New Order's sinister reign - dire force in our sensory realm
Simulating tastes of life they run their master plan

"Dominate the world elite!  Enslave their depthless minds!"
Brain chips implanted, true will is paralyzed
"Transmission complete" - the signal runs through the cortex of life
"We control your thoughts again, this time with straight commands"

Through secret gates to the mystic worlds
they reach for means to refine control
in a race with natures of darkness
By this blinding game for power lose their core
and their future bodes fire

Hey!
Break the spheres and clear your minds led astray!
Are these the words of faith
- "We can't save mankind from grief"?!
Raid the world!!! I say, it's time to toll the bell!
And The Cleansing's wind will fade the waste

I can pierce the vultures' plans
I can read true essence in modeled words
I can sense the foulness of rotten thoughts
I can't wait to summon the allies' force

I can pierce the vultures' plans
I can read true essence in modeled words
I can sense the foulness of rotten thoughts
I can't wait to gather the rebels of the world

We release the global strain, revive the hearts of men
New world awakens, disrupts the kings of pain
Revolution's coming by storm, bringing change to the balance of life
With our wrath and pure will's strength we erase the tyrants' bounds

With this rise of conscious minds the world reforms again
The fall of tyrants, dethroned by overmen
As the mighty renaissance wind brings new hope to the spirits of all
It resounds the twilight chant for the full that screamed for more

They fell once more
