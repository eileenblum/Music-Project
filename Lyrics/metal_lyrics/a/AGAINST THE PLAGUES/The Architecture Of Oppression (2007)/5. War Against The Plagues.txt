See the critical time arena
But soon it will reach our limit inside
I crave for a raze storm to sign its doom
Bring the silence's fall

Breathe!

Raise, form, steer - organic trio
Unfold their dynasty - dark-legacy's blood
That web trap us all
Rape us all

Someone reflects in a sudden recon
The coward turns and says - "Don't blame the rule!"
Robotic mind, formed to spot dissents from power
In programmed structure now auto codes waked

Razing urge with furious strength will swing its sword
Sweep the silt of false honesties
Never deny what you see!

And blinded herd just insist to hail the power
Assign their being to a "higher cause"
An ancient guile to evoke the guilt and morals
The mindless sheep, with abject lies bound

Some evolve, by their lives enlightened
Find own reason
Some reflect, by their pain awaken
Tear the dogmas' maze
Someone shouts - "I'm enchained, release me"
Break the sphere
Someone cries - "I'm a code, decrypt me"

With that - war!

With smiles of joy
The ensign of the rebels streams
And views enlightened inspire us as right
One last reflection of a new, disinfected world
And strong their reign, but they can't flee the flames of the sun
Wrath of the overman will

The winds embrace me
The sun mesmerizes me
A wave of war cries
Unleashed, the eagles fly
An anthem calls me
The song of awakened self
This dawn they witness wrath of the overman will
