Into new world I command my sail
And anguish falls... The bane wears thin...
In beacons' lights see the mystic lands
Against the storms now this mission fulfilled

These views immense... still so hard to see...
For many years in blinding pain...
My rage corrupted and turned on me
Among the clones of the burning zeal drained

Some are raped by the taste for greed
Some are sold into vain of humanity
We are "blessed" by the provident "saviors" feeding our sense
We must break this trance!
Honestly, are we a coward race?
Isn't conscious choice a much better way?
...And the mighty rain of cleansing, healing our minds,
will release the thought from filth

lead the way, o you great mindseye!
I embarked on the course of identity
To regain... when the meaning for me ruined inside...
But the flame unbound!
I awake what the eye can't see
Concentrate on aims, not misery
Elevate through strength
Explore me
Purify view
To perceive new sense in all... this

Into new world I command my sail
And anguish falls... The bane wears thin...
In beacons' lights see the mystic lands
Against the storms now this mission fulfilled
