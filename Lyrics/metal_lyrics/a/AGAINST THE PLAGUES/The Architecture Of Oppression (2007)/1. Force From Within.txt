Here inside acid entity

Here inside acid entity
Burning pain, raging anger
Tearing meâ¦ hate tangled with grief  
When my weakness howlsâ¦

Rain on meâ¦! Flood my sorrowâs denâ¦!
Set me free from miseryâ¦!
Swerve my sight from this horrorâ¦!
I must take a new breathâ¦

âTake this lie, share out for all!â
And our tribe suffersâ¦
That crawling rot disables sincere will
A calculated plot of our life
This is an assay how I trust my self

Strengthen myself
and revive the powers so oppressed
in my struggle finding true will
Can I resist this drift to follow them againâ¦?
Feeling their doctrines run
through channels of my head
âThink our way!â, âLive our way!, âWe decide!â, âYou obey!â
I refuse, never concede!
Insight before me â self-reliance course
These are survival codes lifeâs turning on

Free power
Waste that planted sentence
âworth dying forâ
Free power
Running alive, inside the fire wild

And this is how I ride the entire wave of life
I am the king of myself
and breed own fate to be
âBe a clone" â
is the way blinded kind showed me
And the way I find is in depth of my self

Waken and inspire my zest to live
Secrets of euphoria unfold
Escaping a meaningless form of existence
I depart from the filth

I have the courage to bring forth change
Power to the control weaknessâ strains
Confronting the visage of degenerations
I devise better world

Misled herd crave in ecstasy
Mirrored clones â slaves of systems
Formed to serve â fools ruled with their greed

And my insight grows
They canât tell, what they cannot see
Frozen dreamsâ¦ razed by doctrines
Closed their eyes on this journey
And my wisdom flows

Sense and hope from this waste I pan
Trust my soul, fuse with virtue
Brave it all, stand, strengthened by will
I disdain the old waste

When I go graced by greater aims
Clean my thoughts, tear my fears
Grow with strength as true being
I embrace a new world
