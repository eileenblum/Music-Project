Save me from inside
Force evolves within
Insight floods the sorrow
Well of my desires
Antidote of pain
Overwhelms with power

Plagues of the Earth tearing at me...
Slaves of the tomb... Eagle now flees!
Visions concealed, insights evolved
Under the surface profound, raging thoughts

Slaves of the Frame held on their knees
Bound with their thirsts, cry to receive
Pure I remain, breaking the codes
I am a flame unrestrained
Phoenix source inside

Confront the grave
And I'm not afraid
Gathered, they rise before me
Summoned, they face the inherent will
Trap them inside a morning blaze
The new sun's horizon
I am the sword bringing the dawn

Save the child in your core

Unafraid, awake
By the lessons saved, unseen
Find the golden path

Move in secret shadows
Keep the insights close, inside
With the eyes decrypted
See the maze of system cells!

Senseless followers
Natures molded by the false
Slaves in bio shells
Place a veil on mortal soil
Hide your secret realm
Wisdom be your shield
In this primal war

Save me from inside
Force evolves within
Insight floods the sorrow
I will drain the liars
I shall use the waste
Time to cut the wire

We are the ones always unnamed
Eyes in the crowd, pearls in the herd
Great are the eyed, strain of the prime
Chasing the blights of the worlds
Bane of times
