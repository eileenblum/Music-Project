[By A. Krieg]

When the inner hate quiet forever
When emotions no longer exist
When this world only let you suffer
When the last piece of humanity
Inside of you is dead
When the shadows stop to speak
And your mind drowned in emptiness
When the calling of the full moon
Don't get you anymore
When the night lost all their beauty
When all existence looks senseless to you
When you take the others life
Before you go to the last exit
When the screams of the dying don't excite you
When you just will leave
When the chemicals burn your stomach
When the heroin separate your soul from your body
When you take the last fly
When the knife touch your veins to open them
When the rope takes your last breath
When the warm muzzle give the last kiss to you
And nothing will remain
