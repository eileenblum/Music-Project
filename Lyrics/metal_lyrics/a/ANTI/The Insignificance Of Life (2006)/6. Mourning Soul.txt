[Originally by Absurd]

My days are grey like dead snow
A fire's burning in my soul
Why should I kneel lying in pain
My death is real this day
In solitude I could not tell
Just of my deepest sorrow
All time thats left is freezing me
I'm waiting for tomorrow
The fire in my mourning soul
Burns all my feelings to the ground
And all my hope has gone away
I simply will decay
Of fallen mind I ran away
Decay lies behind me
On desert plains where I can see
The northern light it blinds me
No strength or hope to break the spell
This curse that ties me down
My mortal life runs out of me
I'm dying on my own
The fire in my mourning soul
Burns all my feelings to the ground
And all my hope has gone away
I simply will decay
