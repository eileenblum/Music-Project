[By A. Krieg]

I've nothing in common with you!
My inner self, an emptiness
Nothing is important!
Nothing cares!
I'm alone between the masses
I'm an actor in their world.
I play a role.
For what?
To be?
To be a kind of a human?
I'm leading myself, behind myself
Day by day
No one see, what I see
My face is a mirror
I'm sitting behind
Wearing what you'll see
Behind this grotesque mask of humanity.
Questions without answer
Answers with unreadable questions
The cosmic plan, before my eyes.
Emptiness, Nothing
The ultimate evil
I've nothing in common with you
Do you know what you have to fear?
