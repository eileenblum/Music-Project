[By Anti]

As long as silence fills this woe
As long as sorrow fills this life
As long as darkness fills my thoughts
As long as blackness fills my senses
- I will not longer exist
- I will not longer see this
As long as life needs tears
As long as tears nourish grounds
As long as memories evokes pain
As long as screams comes with longing
- I will not remember
- I will not life this life
