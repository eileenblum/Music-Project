[By Anti]

Silent is the night
Blurred is the sight
Obscure are my thoughts
Red are my hands
I hear the winds that brings the death
I see the darkness that takes the life
The abyss of the mankind feed my lust
The weak beauty of their denied sorrow
Tears of waste drops on my bleeding skin
Colours darkened as I bless my life with wounds
The wounds of yearning
The wounds of end
This insignificance of this life
This dismally world in that we're captured
The meaning of life - futile and indifferent
Finally life gives way the reign of death
