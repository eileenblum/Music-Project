I'm the Lord of these lands of mirrors
I'm the king of your unseen horrors
"Where the full moon lights has no bright"
I'm the one who waits in all dead ends in shadows
I'm the one who stares at you, Man of hollow

I'm your shadow of reflection,
I'm the illustrator of your fears
I'm the desire of destruction,
I'm the creator of your tears
My time has come, To seek this prey of mine
with my ancient unwritten rules, You play last game of your life

You can't hide in sins of crowds
Your blood beats shout so loud

Your illusion of/ getting out of here
Is the delusion / of your own mind
Try to find/ your conscious for real
There's no music of angels/, nor rhymes

My time has come, pray for your divine sign
"I'm vicious voice at your back, I'm the mysterious mirror man"

You/ can't /hide/ in sins of crowds
Your/ blood/ beats /shout so loud
There's/ no heavens,/ nor hell
no/ sound /of/ salvation of bells

All/ attempts / you make/ are gone in void
All/ rusted/ nails/ run in your veins
Lead/ you/ to me/ and choke you more
Bring/ you back/ to me/ is all you gain

You can't beat the king
cause, here I'm everything
You can't seek the lights
In my realms of night times

It's your own encapsulated delusion
Not the inspiration/ of my illusion
Your fate is in my hands
You can hear your last desperate grasps

You/ can't /hide/ in sins of crowds
Your/ blood/ beats /shout so loud

I'm your shadow of reflection,
I'm the illustrator of your fears
I'm the desire of destruction,
I'm the creator of your tears
My time has come, To seek this prey of mine
with my ancient unwritten rules, You play last game of your life
