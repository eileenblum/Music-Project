[clean vocal]
"hen the last remaining light turn to eternal darkness
When the sun and stars fall in the deepest abyss of hell"
"When the dark hours of the longest night of winter come
When the thrones of bitter power turn to ashes and dust
When the night over cast and I walk through dusk
When the corpses of my preys have been seen by your inner eyes"

[Part 1]

"You can hear the infernal cries of your demon
You can realize the horrifying reason
That I have laid deep inside you since your first breath
that you are the ghost of your reflections in mirrors"

[Part 2]

"That you are the blood through the veins of this beast
That you are the lord of bloody sunsets in west and rises in east
You're the curse who brings fears
to these creatures of tears
You're the king of the throne of thorns
You're the father of these undead souls and made them torn"

[Part 3]

"You walk through the alley of doom
but you can't reach the end of gloom

you're the unborn child of my legacy
you're the proof of this bitter prophecy"

games of predestination that lays
in the hands of immortal gods

The un-ruled pages of my covenant
Burn within abyss of ages of odds

the seven deadly sins
are my gifts to your boring life
the rise of my child has been written
in the monuments of heavens on the earth
angels buried the gates of my world
in the graves of holy men

it is rotten at the core
you fell in my growing hole
listen to your victims roars
feel the joys in your growls

the seven deadly sins
are my gifts to your boring life
the rise of my child has been written
in the monuments of heavens on the earth
angels buried the gates of my world
in the graves of holy men

Do you think you can chase the sacred souls
Do you think they exist in this ground of fouls
all the angels are defeated in these lands
all the purity has gone in my rotten hands

Don't be afraid of me my unholy child of sanity
You're just like me, Just wait for your dawns of fatality
We all are the same just face the truth of your reality
release your hunger and show your desire for brutality

This is not the castle for keeping out the evils
But this is the labyrinth for keeping the devils

"When the dark hours of the longest night of winter come
When the thrones of power turn to ashes and dust
When the night over cast and I walk through dusk
When the corpses of my preys have been seen by your inner eyes''

And I'm the one who rise and shine
To get the curse and carry on
And all the men who fall are gone
It's me the one who sets all dawns
