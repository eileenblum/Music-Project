Into the labyrinth of secret path of my destiny
Through nighttime growls for my liberty

Seeking the shiny stars inside the mystic myth on the furious waves of oceans
Staring at the lights of full moon of long nights of November

Shivering because of this unwritten fate which leads me to my past memories
and shouts to remember.
escaping from the falling shades of angels who doomed to hunt down my emotions

The living souls chase every moments of truth in the maze
None can hide his wicked chests of rage

The games of predestination that lays in the hands of immortal gods
The un-ruled pages of my covenant
Burn within the abyss of ages of odds

Why there's always have to be a journey
Why do I have to be a traveler in insanity
Why do I have to seek in dark shades
to feel secure against the savage raids

Why do I have to be stranger in my universe
Why do I have to be ranger of my own place
Why do I have to be shadow of my own voice
To forget the deeds of frustrating noise

escaping from the falling shades of angels who doomed to hunt down my emotions
The living souls chase every moments of truth in the maze
None can hide his wicked chests of rage

another sleepless night, creatures come crawl out to sight
Grabbing the gem inside, chasing me with their hunger for desire

Why do I have to be stranger in my universe
Why do I have to be ranger of my own place
Why do I have to be shadow of my own voice
To forget the deeds of frustrating noise
