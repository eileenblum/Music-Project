Mirrors mirrors on the wall
What can I do about my desire
Do I have to shoot right at my head
To avoid dreaming at nights
Do I have to carve my name on this bullet
To start playing this Russian roulette
How can I leave the realm of mirrors
How can I win game of horrors

Silent screams begin the holy war
In my roars at the other side
Looking for a place to hide
To snatch peace in my eyes
Seeking the sights of fears
To see the normal life for real
How can I leave the realm of mirrors
How can I win game of horrors

In my broken pale face
something gets near from distance
Appears the reflections of my own shade
Tries to grab me into his own tale
How can I breakdown the fortress
While I'm a prisoner of this blaze
Ages ago in his wicked bloodshed
How can I come out from this deep dale

Long times ago,Longer than it seems
In a place perhaps I seen in my dreams
The weird ages of my faded needs
Chasing me with their increasing greeds

This shapeless being of tears
throws out to me his claws
Still spreads his own fears
In his territories of growls

And he's the one who rise and shine
To take the curse and carry on
And all the men who fall are gone
It's him the one who sets all dawns

To steal/ my spirit /and doom /my destiny
unchangeable/ rules/ of his/ insanity
Should I /listen to his vicious/ cries to/ infinity
Should I/ witness this/ massacre for eternity

I need to find source of this sensation
Need to release the screams of this rusted salvation

Gone

Fears
run
escape
tear

To reach the borders of nights
I must chase the last remaining light
Arriving to a deserted cursed room
filled with wanderers roaming strangers of gloom

Attracted by the ultimate power of this castle
All defeated in their ancient savage battles
With spells on their shattered souls
All wait for the corridor to get out
Burn/ the past/ memories/ of your bleeding life
Wait/ for your/ new blaze/ of dawns and rise
