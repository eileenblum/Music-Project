A breeze of Darkness blessed my Soul as I rise at Armageddon

In ancient Times I was born
Son of Darkness, King of the Night
Baptized with holy Blood
I was blessed with Immortality

I am the bringer of your Death - the Fourth Horsemen of Doom
I'm the one you'll never see, look at me and you know my Name
My Eyes tell you the Truth, I laughed by the Cross as your Mother cried

For I'm the one in your Dreams, I am the Phantom in the Night
I am the Shade behind the Light, I'm the Master of the Unlight

Armageddon, Days of Darkness, Holy War, I am your Son

I rip the Sky and burn their Souls, I rise the Flame of endless Hate

For I'm the one in your Dreams, I am the Phantom in the Night
I am the Shade behind the Light, I'm the Master of the Unlight
