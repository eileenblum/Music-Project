I'm falling deep in Sphere beyond
In bloodred Nights I make my Way

I am fading away from this Life
Alone I'm standing, God has lied to me

My Soul is not sleeping, I'm finding no Peace
I will rise against you all and your Fear is my Pride

Alone I stand beneath the Gates, to destroy Heaven to destroy the Light
As the Fire burns around me and I laugh as the Angels die
Now their Wings have turned to Ash and my Eyes are burning bright

I'm full of Hate, I'm full of Blood
I slay the Christians and enslave their Souls

Now I - I know who I am
I'm the chosen one from Hell
I have slaughtered the holy ones

I am the Rebirth of the Night, I'm the chosen one from Hell
I'm the one who controls your Fear, mightier than Death
And no one knows my Name, cause I live behind the Light
