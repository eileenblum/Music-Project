As I walk to the Gates of Eternity
I see the Spirits who dance for me
A thousand whispers of endless Pain
A Dream of Sorrow of blackend Souls
A soft Embrace of blackend Wings
I kiss the Darkness - my Destiny
The Graveyard shines in moonlight's Shine
The Dead are singing to welcome me
The cold Winds of Eternity blow
They carry me into my Grave
I lie on Roses and feel the End
My Lips are kissed tenderly by Death
Oh, how sweet does this Silence taste
Only Shadows and Moonlight's Shine
I feel my Soul will leave my Grave
I feel my Body will fade away
