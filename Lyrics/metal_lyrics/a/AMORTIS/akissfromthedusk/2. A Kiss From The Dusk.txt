I rise into the endless Time
A Face of Death stares into my Mind
Storming Wind and Dusk remain
The Dawn will never rise again
A Requiem of decent Fear
The Sky is burning, the End is near, die!

Fight against Christian Blasphemy
In the Firestrom the Demon will awake
Hate is burning throughout my blackened Wrath
The Light will fall and the Gates are open-wide

We are marching through the Night...
