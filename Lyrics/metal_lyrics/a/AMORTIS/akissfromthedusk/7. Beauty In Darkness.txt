Beyond the Sky, far away from the Sun
I am with her, my Beauty in Darkness
Through Love and Pain
Through Life and Death
I am with her, eternal(ly)

Suffering - the only Solution, for I am dead in my Dreams
(...)

I'll be with her, where cold Winds blow
And Frost embraces the Earth, forever
I'll be with her, my Beauty in Darkness
When Darkness embraces the Earth

Suicide - the only Solution, for I am dead in my Dreams

I can't bear the Silence that is around me
When I'm alone
I can't bear the Silence that is around me
I cannot breath

The Light of Christ took her away
I screamed through the Night as she died
Her body fades away, as I stay immortal
(...)

Suicide - the only Solution, for I am dead in my Dreams
