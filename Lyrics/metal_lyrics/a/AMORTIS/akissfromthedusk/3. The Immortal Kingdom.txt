Into the Darkness, away from the Light
Nocturnal Desires are leading my way
(...)
Worship the Day when the sun's setting black
And now Devil Troops are preparing for War

Across the Seas of Hate
We rise in Storms of Fate
(...)

On blackened Wings my Soul shall fly
Into the Kingdom of the Unlight
Forever banned in eternal Frost
We rise, into the Northern Light

Under the Moonlight

She embraces the Moonlight
Searching for the Light
Searching forever...

Under the Moonlight
Life is not the same

Temples of Glory
Heaven is bleeding
The Light of the Fullmoon
Refers to the Night
Hate is just Harmony
Heaven burns
We rise!

Under the Moonlight
Life is not the same
