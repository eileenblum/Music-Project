I'm having you in my backsight today
The perfect zombie after a long delay
You are an object of important function
Enabling me a harmless junction

I'll be the one controlling you
Commanding what you have to do
You'll be begging to be my slave
To lick my toes in a crimson wave
My word are the truth, this truth lies in you
Of what your brain refuses yet to know

They treat me as a disabled person
Of inferior mind and without own will
Now I strike back in revolt of pure conscience
Pounded by adrenaline, lead by scientific essence

And I will increase â and spread my disease
By making you bow up to me... forever!!!

Shutting the door in front of your eyes
Letting you feel the edge of despise
Your mindloss is vengeance and vengeance is fear
Your memories shall be dismally clear

You are a zombie, my personal servant
A dysfunctional unit trapped in a cage
A disfigured person of self-immolation
Remotely guided to execute my rage

I don't need â your genes involved
The human puzzle â has been solved

Transorbital lobotomy the key to my dream
The sponge in your mouth is drowning your screams
Conservation works have eventually begun
For you it might be a painful dead-end-run
As I am raising your eyelid to lead in my icepick
You have already fainted â unconsciously sick

Your basic instinct â is all that remains
That's what mankind â deserves in my aims
There'll be no more â dreams you dread
Your blood flows blue â instead of red

Relieving remembrance from truth and superstition
Some inner shades of you believer bad condition
When my work's done you'll miss all individuality
Creating a monster, a ticket to eternity?

Stay alive or you'll be useless
Obey, betray, decay, deny
Abandon all arbitrary actions
Erase, eclipse, erect, estrange

No reaction in your eyes
Just dedication to your god

Do bones swim?
In the underworld...
Do bones swim
In the water deep...

Healed from all your anxiety
Forgotten all your severed pain

Believe, relieve, retrieve, deceive
The circus of confusion has stopped its weird show
Operation failed, patient is dead
Look for a new proband instead
