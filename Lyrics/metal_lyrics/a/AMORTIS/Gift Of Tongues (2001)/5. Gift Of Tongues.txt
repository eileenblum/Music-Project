You want a god, a new messiah?
An object of virtue, of deep desire?
Your miseries shall all be broken
I'll heal you without words being spoken...

Death â the only path to reach you
Pain â the only way to teach you
Of what you missed 2000 years
But craved for in your fears

I'll lead your souls to the promised land
Where glory reigns and our lives extend
A new epoch without false behaviour
A new millennium without...

I â have chosen 12 of you
To fulfil the work I've been elected to
As descendants of prophets you shall deal
Proclaimed by the wounds that will never heal

You'll be the martyrs of a failed generation
Your aches will drown all false temptation

One being hanged, one beaten to death
One skinned alive, one killed with a lance
Everyone gets his own part
To participate in my divine art

'cause I had died and started to live
Decapitate â illuminate
But you used to judge and not to give
Mutilate â degenerate
Take the silver spoon as a sign for my rules
Sown in two â I stand over you
You can't disturb me, you stupid fools

Dance the silver court of life
Your tongues shall speak my words â be strong
You're gonna slightly breath
You're gonna lose your faith

You have forgot about the aim of life
You shall believe, not just survive
I want you to think about your inner perspective
Don't look back in anger but in a poison-reactive

Perfection â my weapon
Illusion â my secret
Deception â my disguise
Believe in my... eyes!

Following the voice of blood
I take your tongues before you start
To lose the frame called body
To lose the shadow called soul
I will speak through your remained tongues
Showing us the newly-entered path
