Brain-storming myself in self-affliction
Engulfment of thoughts, without addiction
Teaching you nothing, revealing your mind
The constitutional race of superlative kind

Seek the powers enshrines in you
Even less than you thoughts to do
No-one knows, but all believe
No-one cares, but all relieve

Scars...

Six bullets â likelihood turns into guarantee
Catch sight of the one who will set you free
The nucleus of rage implanted into your brain
Aggression is heritage, a blood-red rain

I'll liberate mankind from all multi-overload
All criminal potentials on this open road
Each person that might cause disorder
I take them with me around the corner

Escalation â of world unknown
A kingdom of wisdom â I hold the crown

Killing by day, killing amongst others
A new experience I may discover
You force me to a bigger challenge
All routine is raised to riskier heights

I'm the master of puppets, your decline
Hidden the truth, psychotic, endocrine
Believe me, I know that you are willed
You are glad to see all potential killers killed

Scars...
Enigmatic â my thoughts
Scars...
Confusion â my denial of you
Control â the survival kit I need

Poetry, beauty, words of no presence
Life and death the only long lasting sequence
Great expectation but nothing for real
I am the one who likely holds the seal
My gas-gun the weapon that sentences you
This wounded world lies upon you

Obediently, fearless, not without courage
You great your own death, an interesting carnage
Life's an unnatural shimmer â on the screen of eternity
Just a metaphoric glimmer â the system of anomaly

Bleed for me
Destroy god â in your head
A change of seasons
Is all you will ever dread

I kill, therefore I am
Take these words into your grave
You read black, where white I read
Bloody wishes, nothing is real
