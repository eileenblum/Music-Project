Unscathed...

What is it, making people slightly different one another?
At best their decent smell, a thing I have no bother
Why can't I be like anybody else out there
Distinguished by an own scent, characterising my hair
I search for you, a beauty of imminent smile
To create the human perfume â of a perfect style

Odour â purely erotic
Aura â indeed exotic
Fragnance â almost narcotic
Perfection the only way

Odour â purely erotic
Aura â indeed exotic
Redolence â almost narcotic
Blend of prominent day

Your velvet skin, the shining eyes
You seem to be the devil in disguise
Breath-taking, heart-breaking
The fulfilment of dreams
Uniting everything
Your beauty floats in streams

...but you don't care
To even reciprocate my glance
...or you didn't dare
To ask me for a hellish dance

Follow me to experience what is agony
Heart-pounding treasures, a cause for conflict measures
Wisdom as knowledge, atrocities enchanneled
Killing god would be much easier to handle
Wonders, miracles, adoring you in sympathy
Inside of me there's too much hidden jealousy
Feel my hands on your skin, feel my dagger by your side
Forever you'll remain as my dying bride

The obscure dance of distress

Beware of darkness
Surrounding your hybrid coat
The essence of the I
A thing that will always float

Challenging my power
To gratify the urge
Animalistic instincts
Cold-blooded dirge

See me crave for your genetic tunes
See me crave for your love

Now we are gathered, where no-one knows
Where the good seed of mankind never grows
Never have I been closer to you

I want to love you, like a never did
I have to kill you, without you I'll be sick
All the tears you shed I wanna lick

Your immortality â is gonna comfort me
As our feelings collide â you'll be by my side
