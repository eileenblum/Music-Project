They stare at you â my sweet heart, know, you are the one
But you only belong to me like you have always done
They can feel your power, they crave for your love
But you are my goddess, my gorgeous white dove

Confusion, fear, detestation
An immense work of god's creation

The only taste I perceive is desire
Strangulating me like rusty barbed-wire
You cause arousal inside my head
Your fucking lovers, I wish them dead

There is a connection between pain and lust
It is my obsession to watch you around dusk

The border-line between love and hate
Is paper-thin, sealing our fate
Condemned to agony from early past
My senses have never been made to lust

An empty canvas
A purely white screen
This hellish life
Things you have not seen

A darkly portrait
A purely black heart
This black illusion
Real blaspheming art

Who wants to feel secure, does well, not to be seen or heard
Who wants to catch interest, does well, to dig in the dirt

Detect, select, next victim is in sight
Tasteless, caress, anger and hate collide
Fear is, horrific, at same time turning on
Distinguish me from all others you have known

Eyes... tell everything of you
Sin of lust... a joyful mist to do
Do you think, forgiveness is existing?
The irretrievable of time â something I am missing

Control and distance â the magic words
Disconnected from the rest of the world
I am yearning for a breath of normality
Like a vampire I dwell, distracted from reality

This world is teeming of perverts unknown
I do not point at them, I judge on my own
Strangle them â a chain around their neck
They deserve to suffer, I spit on their wreck

I thought you'd trust me, but that's not enough
Your mental disorder, it's breaking you in half
I'll deliver you from this morbid game
My godless queen of love, the seed of all pain!
