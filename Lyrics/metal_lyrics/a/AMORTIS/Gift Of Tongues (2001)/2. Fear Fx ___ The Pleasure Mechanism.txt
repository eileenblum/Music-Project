It's a rude awakening at night
My thoughts almost ignite
When I see myself inside

Violence â the only joy
Pleasure â the only aim
The drown symphony â my senseless game

Silent screams dreadfully I hear
Empty veins, my look too much to bear
My heart is lost, in chains enshrined
Catatonia in my eyes, all memories entwined

What is the sense of life â the ritual of the knife?
Bored to the shores of time â killing is no crime
I am creating radically different styles of now
To erase unworthy people better dead, already now

My world is free of sense, seeing life through a bleak lens
LSD â the illusion I need to float from the sickness I feed
Chainsaw dismemberment â what a pathetic word
My execution routine â screams no unheard

I'm killing, unwilling, murdering with style
Dissecting, liquidating, torturing once a while
What was set to be the rules, I break it down again
There are no upper bounds for me, no ethnic claim

Distortion of a paradigm
You never know what a clamp can do (to you)
When the night is long
Revealed by ecstasy
Nails and matches are useful tools
Scrambled â the human sense

Maybe I am a monster, a schizoid man
But there is nothing preventing me from torturing again
Perhaps I am the devil â in a human frame
'cause I got no soul, everything's a morbid game

Drown!!!

Stare into my eyes, the truth behind all lies
Tears are mixed with blood, madness never dies
Feel the pure horror running down your fucking spine
These voltage-gated cabled â your destined decline

Cocaine dreams of murder
Blood spilling orgies further
Temptation: joyful slaughter

I am the shadow behind your back
I am the one putting a rope around your neck

Knife and death, mood and evil
Experience nihilism on a higher level
No exit, no hope, no future, no fear
Your destiny, my dignity, the end is near
