In eternal Silence we are drawn 
Buried in Stone 
Dust on my Hands 
One hundred Years 
In the pale Shine of a dying Sun 
I fly beneath the Clouds 
Like Ravens through midnight Skies 
My Shade is like a Veil 
That sips Life from this Earth 
Into the Abyss I fall 
My Soul will hunt through the Night 
As a Phantom I arise 
Blackwinged like a Demon I fly 

Beyond the Gates of mystical Paths 
Where the Bringers 
Of the forthcoming Chaos gather 
Under a Moon that buries all Life 
Beneath a Veil of velvet Light 

When Shadows dance 
To Night's Symphonies 
And the Graves are trembling once again 
When the Grim of haunted Souls 
Grasps for a dying Age 
And Winds are summoned 
By some ancient Gods 
When Blood of Mankind flows 
Above the Sins of Man 
And Demons rise in bloodred Nights 
To hunt the puny rest 
And I, the Demon, 
Wait for the day of Wrath 
Preparing for the End 
Armageddon comes to pass 

I fly above the Graveyard 
And hear her cry for me 
Her dying Soul will grasp 
The last Time for me 
I remember the Day 
When they buried her in Stone 

Her Eyes still not closed 
She's waiting for me 
Dust on her Hands, Blood in her face 
Tears in her Eyes 
Visions that I will never forget 
As I saw her Body lying old and grey 
I felt the Hate arise 
That was tearing up my Soul 
All I have loved died in my Hand 
I walk the Path alone 
That leads me to the End 
When the Sunshine fades away 
And all remains is Dust 
Then I, the Demon, 
Come to rule this Earth 

Like Ravens through this Midnightsky 
We spread our Wings to fly again 

Above the Ruins of a martyred World 
Where Shadows wake the Dead to rise 
And the Smell of Blood fulfils the air 
The Angles weep upon their Clouds 
Till the Sun will fall and burn their Wings 
And total Chaos will remain 
So my Throne may rise - forever! 
Silently the Demon gets stronger, Emotions die 
Power that commands the Darkness and you 
Oh I, I feel I get stronger, I will become God 
I will fly blackwinged 
As a Demon for the last Time 
Like Ravens through the Nightskies 
I spread my Wings to fly once again 
Through Stormclouds and Darkness 
Towards my Throne 
Which still gleams through the Night 

Like Demons through Nightskies 
I spread my wings to fly once again 
Through Fire and Darkness 
My Wings keep strong and I feel 

I am GOD!
