As the Nightside called for my Name 
From the Land of Snow and Ice 
For the Spirits are dancing with me 
At the Path to the Unlight 
I will never again see the Light 
That has once cursed my mortal Soul 
Great black Goddess I'm searching 
For you to fulfil your Soul with mine 
I have heard your Call in the Night 
As I was standing about to fall 
I have felt your Hand touching me 
As I was falling so silently 
Like a drunken Angel I fly 
And my Eyes are burning bright 
Towards the Land of Snow and Ice 
Where all dead Angels lie

For this Night I've waited long 
When I take your golden Crown 
The Dust will take my flesh away 
But I remain in Clouds of Dust 
Towards the Unlight I will rise 
Where only Dust and Darkness lies 
Where my Soul will reign in Blood 
And the Demons praise my Soul 

I'm falling into a Shade of Grey 
That carries my dying Soul away 
Silently the Wind embraces me 
And kisses me in Shades of Grey 
Frozen Rivers all around 
And the Forest grasps for me again 

She kissed my Neck 
And sipped my Blood 
Touched me tenderly as I felt 
Immortal I remain with her 
No Light shall ever reach my Eye 
The Night became a Part of me 
Secret Voices call for me 
Whispering Shadows carry me 
Night's Embrace will make me free 

Im dunklen Samt der Nacht 
Wenn alles fort schlÃ¤ft und ruht 
Durch Begierde vom Schlaf erwacht 
Zu suchen nach frischem Blut 
Dein KÃ¶rper blaÃ im Mondschein glÃ¤nzt 
Mein Sein geprÃ¤gt von Dunkelheit 
Dein Blut ist fÃ¼r mich wie Wein 
ZÃ¤rtlich der KuÃ zur Ewigkeit 

The Shine of the Moon 
So clear and bright 
The Snow on my Hands 
The Frost in my Heart 
This never ending Flame in me 
Like a Dagger that carves in my Flesh 
A Symphony composed by the Wind 
How sweet does it sound 
What am I now 

A Dream of endless Silence 
Of Life that will fall down to Dust 
A Dream of endless Darkness 
A Dream where I kiss the Unlight 
A Dream of dancing Shadows 
Of Shadows that carry my Soul 
A Dream of endless Frost 
Of Frost that will grasp for my Soul 

I hear the Shadows scream 
Calling for my Soul 
They will ride with me 
On the Wings of Damnation 
Together with my Goddess 
We're restless in the Woods 
Screaming with the Shadows 
Who are fading all away 
And as the Sun arose 
Above the snow-covered Hills 
I was staring at my Queen 
I will kiss her the last Time 
To Dust we will fall 
Together we are now 
Ashes to Ashes 
And Dust to Dust
