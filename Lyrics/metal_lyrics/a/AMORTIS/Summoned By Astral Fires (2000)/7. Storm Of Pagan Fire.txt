Fire burns bright 
Through dark and cold Nights 
Stormwinds arise, the Sun slowly dies 
Pagan Winds blow, the Fire burns bright 
Stormwinds above, Storm in my Heart 

In the darkest of the Night 
I can feel the Demons cry 
In black Corners of my Soul 
I can feel the Fire burn 
In my Dreams I've seen the King 
And the fallen Angel cry 
In my Dreams I've seen me lough 
As I stand above them all 

Let the evil Spirit fly 
Break the Walls that capture me 
Free my Soul so it can rise 
Lead me through the endless Ice 

The Wolves carry my Name 
Through their Midnight-Howling 
And this silent whispering Voice 
Calls for me from far away 

And my Soul shall fly 
Together with the Flames 
The Thorns will tear my Flesh 
As the Forest sips my Blood 
And the Sun will never shine 
When we are gathered in Moonlight 
I will cry in Moonlight's Shine 
As I become a Part of Night 

Let me fly above the Seals of Sorrow 
Through the seven Gates 
I fly like once in my Dreams 
I've dreamed of burning Wings 
And Thunderstorms above 
I've dreamed of my last Way 
And my eternal Sleep 
I'm old 

Ancient Memories lie 
Beyond the seven Gates 
A Breeze of Frost will blow 
Beyond the Path of Ninib's Gate 
The Seal will gleam in Hate 
As it burns into my Flesh 
As I fall into endless Pain 
I can hear pagan Winds blow 
I see Spirits fly as I sleep in Thorns 
I hear Spirits call as I close my Eyes 
Oh, Lord Ninib, God of Darkness, 
Hear my Screams and feel my Pain 
Let my Soul fly to sleep in your Land of Shades
