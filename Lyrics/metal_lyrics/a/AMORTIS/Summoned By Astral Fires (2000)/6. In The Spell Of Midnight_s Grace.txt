I hear the Call of the ancient Forest 
A thousand Whispers embrace my Mind 

I am the ancient One 
Called from the Unlight 
Cursed by the Might 
Of the ancient Forest 
His call, so clear and near 
Burns in my Heart so bright 
Burns like an endless Flame 
In darkest Night 
I see the Moon arise 
Feel how he looks at me 
Oh, how sweet does this Silence taste 

I have fallen in the Spell of this endless Night 
I fell asleep and I'll never awake again 
Shadows are dancing above my closed Eyes 
As I am buried in a Cloud of Dust 
My Body fades away but I still remain 
Endless Darkness 
Only Moonlight's Shine 

And I walk upon the Shadows 
Beyond forgotten Woods I dance 
My Eyes are like a Mirror 
I'm searching for the Stars 
Alone I stand on the Path to Eternity 
Only the Moon shows me the Way 

Slowly I walk the Stairs 
Of the Moonlight 
And the Raven flies with me again 
Spirits dance on Shadows 
As I grasp for frozen Stars 
I have fallen 
In the Spell of the Moonlight 
Its Shine embraces me again 
Blinded by this Light 
I'm falling carefully 
Down into a Mirror 
In another World 

I will fly again above the frozen River 
My Blood has fallen deep 
Into this endless Field of Snow 
My Heart is frozen 
As I'm caught in a Dream 
Endless Memories are flying beside me 
I will die in this Dream 

See me cry at the Gate 
I am lost in this Dream 
And my Wings turned to dust 
Never ending Pain I feel 
See my Tears fall like Rain 
Creating a River which carries my Pain 
Where are the Shadows 
Which once carried me? 
Where is the Stair To the Moonlight 
I have walked? 

I am falling to vanish 
In the darkness I love 
And the Grace of Night 
Sends for me out again 
Look, the Mirror shines bright, 
I can see it with my Eyes 
Oh, great Goddess, 
Your own Words 
Turned to Lies 

In the Spell of Midnight's Grace 
My Soul's embraced 
By Moonlight's Shine 
In the Spell of Midnight's Grace 
My Soul's embraced 
By Demon's Cries 

See the Stormwind rising higher 
See the Mirror in my Eyes 
See the Dance of cursed Shadows 
See me die in my own Dream 

Wake me up from endless Suffer 
I'm in the Spell of Midnight's Grace
