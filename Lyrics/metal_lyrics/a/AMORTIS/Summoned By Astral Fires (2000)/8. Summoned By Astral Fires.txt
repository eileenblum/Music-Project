I've walked alone for Centuries 
Beneath the Moon 
Alone so cold out in the Dark 
I've searched so long for you 
Whose Blood's the same as I've inside 
You are my Breed 
Listen to this ancient Tale 
Of Fathers long ago 
As Clouds of endless Suffer 
Buried the Moon beneath 
On glorious Fields of frozen Lands 
He's lying still 
In the pale Face 
Of a dying King a Legend's told 
Of Tears which ran so bloodred 
Out of empty Eyes 
In the Time of Unlight 
Before Life and Time had begun 
When the Moon arose 
And gave birth to me in darkest Night 

Upon the Shades a Whisper 
Cries out an ancient Tale 
Of cruel Beings 
In the Woods of Loneliness 
It foretells a hundred Murders 
That lead through ancient Times 
Of mysterious Deaths of thousands 
Of Humans in darkest Nights 
The Ground has sipped all their Blood 
And grasps for dying Mortals 
Who are reaching for the Stars 
And cry loudly as they die .. 
Lycanthrope has begun 

Dust and Fog has lead them 
Through eternal Night 
Golden Stars will shine up high 
Through Midnight's Face 

Out of the Forest so clear 
Hear the dreadful Screams 
Like immortal Hunger 
Of ancient Beasts 

Fear spreads its Wings 
And falls onto the Humans 
When the Moon, their Father, 
Shows them the Way 
Dark Impulses inside their Veins 
Lead them onward to kill again and again 

Into the Forest 
Where the Wolf awakes at Night 
And the greatest Beast of all 
Starts its Hunt for human Flesh 
I'm the great Father 
The Wolf, the ancient Blood 
Whose Bite is the gift 
Of a painful endless Life 

As the Moon shone high upon 
Showing me the Way 
Towards the mortal Bodies 
Of those I love by Day 
The Greed for Flesh of Humans 
Makes me hunt this Night 
Silently I may crawl nearer to my Victims 
So I arise my Claws and tear their Flesh away 
And mutilated Faces begin to stare at me 
Their Eyes are as cold as mine 
Staring at the Sky 
Where the Moon, my Father, 
Is waiting for their Souls 

Blood is flowing out of the Veins 
Of impaled Bodies lying in Shades 
And every Night when I awake 
Oh, weak Humans, prepare to die - DIE
