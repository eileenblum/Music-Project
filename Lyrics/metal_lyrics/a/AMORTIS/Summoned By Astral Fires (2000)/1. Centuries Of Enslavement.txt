As Father Death came to me 
And took my mortal Frame 
My Flesh forever adorns the Graveyard 
And slowly fades away 
But my Soul will return 
My Spells hunt through the Night 
Master of Witchcraft I am called 
Cruelty is my Sin 

When Father Moon will gather 
Upon with Mother Sun 

And great Light rises up so clear 
For the last Time 
A Veil of Darkness' falling 
And Spirits I summon 
The unseen Poet I am called 
In Fire I'll be born 
I call my Soul to free my Bones 
Out of eternal Fire 
Enslavement has begun 
No longer captured in my mortal Grave 
My Soul returned and kissed my Bones 
Reincarnation at the Portals of Fire 
My Coffin is filled with immortal Blood 
Flesh and Soul became one again 
Stormclouds above the Cemetary 
Hungry the Demons wait for my Return 
And I spread my Wings and fly upon 

The Beat of my Heart 
Like Thunder in the Night 
I live again 

No longer captured in my mortal Grave 
My Soul returned and kissed my Bones 
Reincarnation at the Portals of Fire 
My Coffin is filled with immortal Blood 
Flesh and Soul became one again 
Stormclouds above the Cemetary 
Hungry the Demons wait for my Return 
And I spread my Wings and fly upon 
I feel the Arrival of my blackened Kingdom 
The eternal Darkness, when will it arise? 
This Waiting for Silence 
Take me away from here.. 
Nightside embrace me and hold me so close! 
I will not forsake you, my Time has come 
I shall arise now and enslave the Earth 
And rule the Humans 
As they did with me 

Fire shall arise and prepare for my Arrival 
When I walk the Earth - immortal as their God 
My wings will lay down and spread eternal Pain 
Mankind be prepared - Enslavement has begun
