The Shade of an whispering Spirit 
Came crying to my Bed 
Its cold dead Lips have cursed me 
And brought me endless Pain 
My Flesh is getting colder 
Years passed in just one Night 
Restlessly I'm wandering 
As a Phantom preparing for my Death 

Blood is Life 

Dark Visions - so clear in Candlelight 
My Dreams hunt me again this Night 
Empty Eyes, so cold like frozen Stars 
My Body's touched 
By your Immortal Kiss 
Desires make me fly to you 
Oh, Darkness, my velvet Destiny 
Hold me close 
Your Embrace makes me strong 

I kissed her Neck and she grasped for me 
Her Face so pale as she looked at me 
Her Blood in me, she's a Part of me 
A Dance in Shades and she embraced me 
How sweet she was while I sipped her Blood 
How loud she cried as she fell down to Dust 

In the Bright Shine of the Moonlight I fly 
Above the Ocean that will capture her Soul 

Towards the Place where her Destiny lies 
Where her Body will remain
