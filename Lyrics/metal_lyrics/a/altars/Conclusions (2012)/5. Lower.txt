The struggles in my life have brought me to where I am now
Iâve been put here in this place
Itâs in my nature to dwell on the circumstantial flaws
I want to change everything
Iâve walked the line between the strong in faith and weak in doubt
My thoughts have raced, theyâve fought and theyâve tried to figure out
What purpose is, what purpose does, where does my life fit in?
The questions that I thought would fade away they have no end
I cannot seem to find my place
Can I embrace this low?
Iâve lost the path, it seems that if I found it I wouldnât even know
All I want is to understand
And now I find myself here. Through all the choices Iâve made
And now we find ourselves here, through all these choices we have made
Iâm too content with watching my life fade away
Iâll take advantage of this gift of âgraceâ day-by-day
It is apparent that I am the root of all my flaws
But trust that I will point my finger at every wrong cause
Pull me out of myself
Oh God I'm calling to you
Pull my out of myself
