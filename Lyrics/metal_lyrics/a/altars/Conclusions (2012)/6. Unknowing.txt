I can't find my way home
I can't find my way
It seems my mind in mourning
A part of me that's dead
It's trying to come back
The answers that I'm looking for are always just beyond my reach
I'm a drowning man that's reaching out to you
I'm tired of losing sleep
I am my own demise
This is the turning point
This is the turning point
The answers that I'm looking for are always just beyond my reach
I'm a drowning man that's reaching out to you
I'm tired of losing sleep
This is the turning point
I'm no longer standing by
This is my turning point
God thank you for giving me another try
Get out of my head
Get out of my head
I can't live with these regrets
I can't find the end
The answers that I'm looking for are always just beyond my reach
I'm a drowning man that's reaching out to you
I'm tired of losing sleep
I can't find the end
