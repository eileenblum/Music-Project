Look at me
I can not seem
To hold my own
Now let's watch me fall apart
Turn me around
Turn me around
I feel my own mind breaking down
I'm looking back and behind me
It's normal to be scared of what the future holds
But it's the past that's keeping me from letting go
I'm terrified of the things I could have changed
And the words I never said
Sometimes I think and wonder why regretful scenes
Constantly run through my head
I'm terrified
My mind is taking me back
To how it all used to be
And all I want
And all I wanted from this
Is for my mind to be free
I've been running and hiding from what I used to be
What am I to do with this shame and guilt
God am I diseased?
I've been running and hiding from what I used to be
I have no way of going back to change
If only I had seen
Turn me around turn me around
I feel my own mind breaking down
I'm looking back and behind me
It's normal to be scared of what the future holds
But it's the past that's keeping me from letting go
I'm terrified of the things I could have changed
And the words I never said
Sometimes I think and wonder why regretful scenes
Constantly run through my head
It's not the end
