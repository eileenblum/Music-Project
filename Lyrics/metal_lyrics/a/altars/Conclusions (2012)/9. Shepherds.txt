All my life I looked up to you
Because I saw you were strong in the faith
I saw you were strong in a unique way
But now I see that things are never as they seem
Even the strongest mind can fall to be weak
Where is your heart this isn't what you used to stand for
Your actions are so very contradicting
We walk the path of the true
There is no compromising
Everything that you stood for
Now lies in the dust
Your fame has brought you weakness
Your fame has brought you weakness
Don't lead the sheep astray
Don't lead the sheep astray
I'll draw the line
I'll draw the line
So take your teachings elsewhere
Somewhere my eyes can't see
I'll tell the world of your false prophecy
Because I see straight through your schemes
Now everything that I was searching for is gone
