I fear I fear I fear
That I forget to set myself apart
I fear I fear I fear
That I'm caught up in what is seen of us
And now I will bury the notion
That I am not who I claim to be
If seeing is believing then watch me soar from here
Fly fly away
If seeing is believing then watch me soar from here
Fly fly away
And feel free to watch me stop at nothing
Think what you want of us
And what we choose to be
And we are not afraid to
Be what we're meant to be
I fear I fear I fear
That I forget to set myself apart
I fear I fear I fear
That I'm caught up in what is seen of us
My faith has nothing to do with the eyes that look upon me
My faith has nothing to do with you or what you see of it
My faith has little to do with the voice that controls the armies
My faith has little to do with what surrounds me
'Cause I believe
Yes I believe in hope for man
'Cause I believe
'Cause I believe in it
Yes I believe
Yes I believe in hope for man
Yes I believe
Yes I believe in hope again
I fear I fear I fear
That I forget to set myself apart
I fear I fear I fear
That I'm caught up in what is seen of us
And now I will bury the notion
That I am not who I claim to be
