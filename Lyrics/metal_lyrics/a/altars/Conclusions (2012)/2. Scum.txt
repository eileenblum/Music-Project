I have been brought to understand the concept of right and wrong
My actions have betrayed me
I have been brought to overcome the desire to sink myself
My own thoughts have condemned me
My own thoughts have condemned me
And I have fought against my thoughts my needs my wants
And I have fought against my thoughts my needs my wants
My hands are wringing my neck
I am sick of the finger being pointed at the world
This constant fight is not with You
But with the body I'm in
And this body is fighting back
And surfacing from within
We will never find some peace of mind through the perfection that we seek
This grace shines brightest
When I'm on my knees and at my weakest point
I am the scum of the Earth
And I am redeemed
Good God I deserve nothing
I am the scum of the Earth
I deserve nothing
I am nothing
