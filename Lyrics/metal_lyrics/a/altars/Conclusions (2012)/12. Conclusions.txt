Don't call me pleasant
For I am bitter
To this broken world
The world around me
I've fallen to the ways of man
I've walked the easy path
I have not loved the ones around me
I'll blame it on this world
The one that's turned it's back on you
But that's exactly what I'm doing
For far too long
I've only opened my eyes to the dark
For far too long
I've chosen to live outside your grace
I've walked the easy path
I have not loved the ones around me
I'll blame it on this world
The one that's turned it's back on you
But that's exactly what I'm doing
And the only one to blame is me
Luminous beings are we
Not this crude matter
God I know my body's weak
But make my soul strong again
My body is bruised, but my soul is redeemed
Stand with me now
Against a world of filth and greed
Stand with me now
Stand with me and the one who can redeem
You are the answer, you're just within my reach
You are the answer, you're everything I need (Unknowing)
You're everything that I was searching for (Shepherds)
I am the scum of the Earth, and I am redeemed (Scum)
Feel free to watch me stop at nothing (The Coward)
Pull me out of myself (Flaws)
The light is all I see (Revelation)
I've been running and hiding from what I used to be (Montreal)
We are the Red Brick Army (Red Brick Army)
