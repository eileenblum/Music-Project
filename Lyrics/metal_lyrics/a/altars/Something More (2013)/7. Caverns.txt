Trapped in a vicious cycle
Heartbroken by this world of struggle
To escape I sink to the depths of my mind
Not realizing the loneliness I will find

All that awaits me is a place of fear
A place of despair where it used to be clear
God I'm begging you to show me out
This is my prayer to You

I'm so lost
In a world where there is no love
In a world where you can not trust the ones you look up to
God I'm so alone
In these thoughts I call my home
In these lies that I have grown
These lies are all I've known

Trapped in a vicious cycle
Heartbroken by this world of struggle
To escape I sink to the depths of my mind
Not realizing the loneliness I will find

Why am I lost inside the caverns of my mind?
Oh God please tell me why

Trapped in a vicious cycle
Heartbroken by this world of struggle
To escape I sink to the depths of my mind
Not realizing the loneliness I will find

All that awaits me is a place of fear
A place of despair where things used to be clear
God I'm begging you to show me out
This is my prayer to you
