Are you tired of seeing the world collapse all around you?
I can't imagine standing still
Sometimes the thought of action might seem so beyond us
What's the point?
It's not enough?
What can I do?

I just can't believe the world around me turns so aimlessly
Open eyes can see that revolution is just what we need

We all wonder what it means
To be a part of something
A revolution is just what we need

The union of the sick and tired is within reach
Stand together to incite the change you'd like to see
The coalition of open minds will move and speak
A better world
Is what we seek
What can I do?

I just can't believe the world around me turns so aimlessly
Open eyes can see that revolution is just what we need

We all wonder what it means
To be a part of something
A revolution is just what we need

So be a part of something

I just can't believe the world around me turns so aimlessly
Open eyes can see that revolution is just what we need
