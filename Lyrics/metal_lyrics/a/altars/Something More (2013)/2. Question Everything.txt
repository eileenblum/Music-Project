Only you can free yourself

When the lies that surround you
Have brought you to your knees
When the darkness engulfs you
I know just what you need
In a world divided
It seems there's no single truth
That couldn't be more misguided
Hope is the absolute

There's a darkness growing
I see it in the streets
Don't let them tell you it's wrong to
Question everything

Question everything
Seek truth
Spread Hope

Red Brick Army
Seek truth
Spread hope
