The story has changed
The meaning's been lost from page to page
How did we let it get this way?
How can something so simple and pure
Be turned into something so sinister?

Where is the hope, where is the love?
Without these your system will self destruct
Where is the hope, where is the love?
Without these your system will self destruct

My eyes see differently
The parts of the world you choose not to see
The people living in misery
Are the people you write off so blindly

Where is the hope, where is the love?
Without these your system will self destruct
Where is the hope, where is the love?
Without these your system will self destruct

Pray for me
Because we don't see eye to eye
The word has promised life
Yet you condemn billions
Billions to die

You're committing religious mass genocide

Where is the hope, where is the love?
Without these your system will self destruct
Where is the hope, where is the love?
Without these your system will self destruct

You can't change our place in eternity
You won't change my place in eternity
