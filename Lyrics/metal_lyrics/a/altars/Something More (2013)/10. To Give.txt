Take a look at the world around you
Tell me is it beauty that you see?
Because everywhere I look I see suffering
And that pain has corrupted everything

This is the end

We can no longer stand by and watch the world
Fall apart right before our very eyes
Take my hand and join the fight
To improve all of this Earth's life

Take a look at the world around you
Tell me is it beauty that you see?
Because it's beauty that we need

I'll never stop
Until I leave this place
Better than when I first came

We all need to realize the beauty that's meant for our lives
See yourself through our father's eyes
I see it plain and clear
Our beauty is what we need to share

Take a look at the world around you
Tell me is it beauty that you see?
Because it's beauty that we need

The driving force that gets me through everyday
Is that there's something more to give
And myself is all that's in my way
