More care
Less greed

I'm buried in my own head
I've got these walls around me
I peek outside now and then
Look at the bleak surroundings

Our kind is so diseased
Closed eyes closed minds hypocrisy
Just look around and see
Torn souls the pain and suffering
I think that what we need
A little more care a lot less greed
I think that what we need
Is more care less greed

More care
Less greed

Every time I sit and think about the world around me
Conviction swells in my mind and I know
Something must be done
I've got to escape my head
Won't let these walls confine me
Action is what's needed
I'm sick of all this hiding

Our kind is so diseased
Closed eyes closed minds hypocrisy
Just look around and see
Torn souls the pain and suffering
I think that what we need
A little more care a lot less greed
I think that what we need
Is more care less greed

More care
Less greed

I won't stay here forever I'll break free
