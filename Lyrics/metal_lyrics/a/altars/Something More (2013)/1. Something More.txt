The answers that I've asked for over the past few years
Have been revealed to me through my friends and my enemy (My enemy is me)
I can never repay you for what you gave me
I can never repay you for saving me but I do the best I can
To tell my heart to forget the ways of man
(Forget the ways of man)

I'm still searching for something more

The answers that I've asked for over the past few years

Take my voice, take my voice
Take my voice, take my voice
Take my voice, take my voice
Take my voice, take my voice
Take my voice, take my voice

Take my voice and use it for something more!
