You may hate me, but I've got something to say to you
You can attack me all you like because I hold these words so true
I am called to live like a single man lived before me
And that one single man He wouldn't like what He sees
I'm not here to say you're wrong even though I know it's true
Westboro you may hate me, but I will always love you

I will always love you

You can hate me
It won't change me
I will choose to love

A loving family is what we're meant to be
He took the fall for humanity and this is how you see things?
Your hatred sickens me
Oh I wish I could make you see
That love is stronger than hate
And His love has set me free

I will choose to love
