You file in week by week
Sit back and shut your mouth and hear the preacher preach
They say that this is for you
Don't listen to what they told you
This is so wrong
There's so much more
Why don't you take the time to examine what you're living for?
They say that this is for you
Don't listen to what they told you

All my life it's the same thing
I've seen it time and time again
Sheep aren't herded by the truth
Instead they're lost by the lies of man
If you feel how I feel and see we need a change
I encourage you to take action or things will stay the same

Could it be that everything we've built
Is what we're sent here to destroy
Sent to destroy

You file in week by week
Sit back and shut your mouth and hear the preacher preach
They say that this is for you
Don't listen to what they told you
This is so wrong
There's so much more
Why don't you take the time to examine what you're living for?
They say that this is for you
Don't listen to what they told you

Something is terribly wrong
In a world where a man of religious influence
Is given the right to control the lives of others around him
Something is terribly wrong
In a world where a text can be manipulated for one groups favor
While leaving others in the dark
Something is terribly wrong
In a world where a church can tell you how to use your voice
for their gain
Something is terribly wrong

I am sent to destroy

You file in week by week
Sit back and shut your mouth and hear the preacher preach
They say that this is for you
Don't listen to what they told you
This is so wrong
There's so much more
Why don't you take the time to examine what you're living for?
They say that this is for you
Don't listen to what they told you
