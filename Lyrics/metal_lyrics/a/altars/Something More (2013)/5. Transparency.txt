Why should I try to hide what's held inside?
Why should we be afraid of each other's beliefs?
It's been so long and it's taking its toll
The fear of judgement has caused us to lose control
Why should you be above somebody else?
I wonder if you're even being honest with yourself
It's been so long and your lies have taken hold
The fear of losing your power is in control

And I wonder what this world could be
If we all lived transparently
Like a window for the world to see
That deep down we are all the same breed

A need for life
A need for love
A need to wake up and see the sun above
Why can't this world see?
There's nothing different between you and me

Transparency
So the world can see
We are all the same breed

Why should I try to hide what's held inside?
Why should we be afraid of each other's beliefs?
It's been so long and it's taking its toll
The fear of judgement has caused us to lose control
Why should you be above somebody else?
I wonder if you're even being honest with yourself
It's been so long and your lies have taken hold
The fear of losing your power is in control

And I wonder what this world could be
If we all lived transparently
Like a window for the world to see
That deep down we are all the same breed
