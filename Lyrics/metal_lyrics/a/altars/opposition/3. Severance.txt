Sever the ties.
There are things in life that hold us back.
"It's not in me. It's not in me."
If you don't look, you'll fall off the track.
"I can't let it go. I can't let it go."
It is up to you to look away.
"I'll just stay here. I'll just stay safe."
There is an answer.
There is a way.
"I need an answer. I need a way. I cannot stay in this godforsaken place."
Can you not see the hope that lies ahead?
Your sight is stick in the here and now.
There are things in life that hold us back.
You will never learn until you let go.
You only held me back.
Now it's time to let go.
