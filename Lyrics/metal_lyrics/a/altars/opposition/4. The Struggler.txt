Look around!
We're tearing each other apart.
Look around as this world fades away.
Look up!
Look down!
Hope does not paint this picture.
Look around; life dies a little every day.
It seems that we've passed the point of no return.
Should I sit idly by?
We cannot stand for this.
This is a red brick war.
I'm done trying to be what you want me to be.
No longer will I see what you want me to see.
