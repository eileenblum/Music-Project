[feat. Chad Ruhlig of For the Fallen Dreams]Who do you think you are?
I've built my life on belief.
How could I let it slip away, much less without skipping a beat?
I choose to live my life this way.
Some make it look so easy to forget just who who you are, so who wants responsibility?
Just who do you think you are?
You think this holds me back.
You think you know much more.
The things you say hold me back are exactly what make me soar.
Your words are getting old to me.
Build yourself up!
You should just let me be.
This is my hands of hope, and I won't let go.
This is a lamp to my feet.
This is all I know.
You can live your life and let me live mine.
This life is my battle cry.
This is my way, my why.
This hate means nothing to me.
Just pure negativity.
The Grace is all I need.
