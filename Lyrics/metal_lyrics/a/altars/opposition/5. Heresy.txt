Let's put ourselves here, here in this world, trying to prove someone wrong.
With reason and doubt, you'll figure out.
You'll find just what you seek.
It's not that easy.
Stop thinking it out.
There's not a way to fathom the world.
As of right now, I am what I am.
I stand where I stand.
When faith is what finds us, our minds are at ease.
My own over-thinking us just my disease.
We search and we search for the cause and result, and with what we'll find are no feelings of hope.
The answer is not in the books.
The answer is in the faith we hold.
