Your rhetoric will bring our souls back from the dead,
Your choice of words won't change what yours said,
Whispers with forked tongues become swan songs.

The stars and stripes will soak up the blood,
oh great deceiver, why have you betrayed us.

Abandoned your people and left us for the dead our
great misleader, why have you left us a broken
blueprint of what we once were.
We can never forget, we can't accept lies and we can
never forget the truth lives inside our hearts and minds.
You can't erase us, we've already opened our eyes. Your
rhetoric won't bring our sons back from the dead.

Your choice of words won't change what you've said
whispers with forked tongues became swan songs. The
stars and stripes will soak up the blood.

Oh great deceiver we knew you've betrayed us.

We the people will not lie down and die. Our greatest
achievement is not cast in stone. An unbroken blueprint
wakes in the hearts of men when the monuments become
tombstones and your empire is burning to the ground.
You will know that you are to blame when this great
nation is crawling on its belly, bleeding to death in
this life or in the next.

THIS GHOST WILL COME BACK AND HAUNT YOU.
