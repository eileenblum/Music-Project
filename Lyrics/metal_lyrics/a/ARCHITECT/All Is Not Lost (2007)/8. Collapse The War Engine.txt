The gears of the war machine spin.
Always forward endlessly driving forever onward.
Never slowing down.
History repeats over and over.
Explode.
Implode.
Faulting.
Failing.
From tooth and nail to nuclear arms the results are all the same.
Explode.
Implode.
Faulting.
Failing.
The reminders are the trademarks.
The accounts of being dragged through unescorted hell.
Told by the innocent passerby that did not embrace the great machine.
The destroyer of human understanding.
Feeds on complacent ignorance.
We will no longer pimp fuel to the flame.
But at what price.
I beg the question.
What purpose does drive this engine.
When will this machine collapse.
Never.
