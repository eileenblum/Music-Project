What have you done to make this world nothing but a better place.
Nothing but lies deception broken promises and disgrace.
I curse your name I cast you down.
I cast you down and burn your throne.
This time the screams will be your own.
So many live in this hell you have made.
I curse you to suffer their same fate.
Live your last days dying slow cold and alone with flies on your face.
When your on your knees praying to whatever god you think you might believe in.
I will have the last laugh.
Your god does not come to this place never has and never will.
You'll pray for life.
You'll beg for life.
You'll beg for death.
When your on your deathbed begging your savior to let you live.
I'll give you what you have coming.
Salvation.
When your last breath is all that you have left.
I'll have your body lay broken on the ground before me...
