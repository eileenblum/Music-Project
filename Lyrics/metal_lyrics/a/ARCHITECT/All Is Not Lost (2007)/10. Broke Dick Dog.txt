You won't make it.
Why do you deny yourself life for a chance to live forever.
You ran that great race in exchange for eternal life.
Abandoned your hopes and dreams held on to a lie.
Sacrificed today with tomorrow on your mind.
But heavens closed its doors and you got left behind.
You got left behind.
Just because your breathing doesn't mean your alive.
Just because your breathing doesn't mean your not a ghost.
You are not going to make it.
You ran that great race in exchange for eternal life.
Abandoned your hopes and dreams.
Held on to a lie.
Sacrificed today with tomorrow on your mind.
But heavens closed its doors and you got left behind.
You are not going to make it.
