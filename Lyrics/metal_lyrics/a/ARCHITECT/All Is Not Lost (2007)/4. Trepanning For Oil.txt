Every single day I wage war upon everything that you are.
While you sleep at night.
I am wide awake.
Plotting my revenge in my fathers name.
What was it worth.
Was it worth that every drop of blood.
The American dream has become a living nightmare.
All is not lost.
Whats it worth when a pound of flesh is worth its weight in gold.
The American dream has become a living nightmare.
While you sleep at night.
I am wide awake.
All is not lost.
