What in your gods name will you do next.
A final solution is all that left to complete your birthright.
A god complex.
How can you live with yourself.
Your blue blood is turning black.
"For if it propers none dare call it treason".
The every man's will is bound and broken.
While you pave a road to Zion on the backs on millions.
Its all over now.
When i drag you into the night.
Erect a cross and crucify.
Then carve traitor into your chest.
Put a bullet in your head.
Strike a match and set ablaze.
Piss on your ashes and walk away.
Do you think you will ever stop me.
Over my dead body.
