[Far away lost in the years of ancient history, in the twilight of time stands Tuan McCarel an archetype of Celtic heroic fantasy. Through his continuous metamorphosis, he gives us the story of the invaders of Ireland and the epic of Tuatha De Dannan.]

I belong to the Golden Age
When the gods blessed the human race
I remember well in my time shining eyes in prosperous faces

Was a King through graceful days
Now these years belong to the past
Golden cities became memories lost beneath the depths of ancient seas

Dark prevailed upon the light
Storm of fire and steel provoke rain of blood
Sorcery covered the land
Thrashing our souls with hate from caves of Crom

I hearkened to dark whispers of the ancient craft
To learn the secrets all through the time
I have witnessed what the wisest had never seen
I've walked in ways beyond your fantasy
I am Tuan, my name belongs to the myth, Guardian of the Ancient Deeds
Mine is the voice that's coming to you, penetrates within your dreams
Tribe of my own does no longer exist, Guardian of the Ancient Deeds
Dust in the wind is what they became, whispers in my ears

I am the great ancient white, the man beyond the myth
Guardian of the Ancient Deeds
They exist in my memories.
Only I remain the same
Through the path of the centuries
Growing old in different shapes
To bring you the truth that resists

I belong to the Golden Age
When the gods blessed the human race
I remember well in my time shining eyes in prosperous faces

Was a King through graceful days
Now these years belong to the past
Golden cities became memories lost beneath the depths of ancient seas

And as the sun appeared on the other side of the hill
The tribe of Tuan was vanished
Alone he walks in the fields of death
Blood-covered now stands...

Dark prevailed upon the light
Storm of fire and steel provoke rain of blood
Sorcery covered the land
Thrashing our souls with hate from caves of Crom
Taste the cauldron of my blood
Sky chariots appeared from another world

I hearkened to dark whispers of the ancient craft
To learn the secrets all through the time
I have witnessed what the wisest had never seen
I've walked in ways beyond your fantasy
I am Tuan, my name belongs to the myth, Guardian of the Ancient Deeds
Mine is the voice that's coming to you, penetrates within your dreams
Tribe of my own does no longer exist, Guardian of the Ancient Deeds
Dust in the wind is what they became, whispers in my ears

I am the great ancient white, the man beyond the myth
Guardian of the Ancient Deeds
They exist in my memories.
Only I remain the same
Through the path of the centuries
Growing old in different shapes
To bring you the truth that resists

Ancient Deeds
