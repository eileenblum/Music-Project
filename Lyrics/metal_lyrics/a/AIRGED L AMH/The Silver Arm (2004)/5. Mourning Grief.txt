[King Nuada was rooted from Tuatha De Dannan and Breas The Beautiful, The bravest warrior in battle with Fir-Bolg, took his place.]

Facing the nightmare in me dreams of emptiness
Dark clouds spit fire and ice all across the land

Tide of forgotten times in nameless shape arise as I had fallen into shadow
Gazing these purple skies I travel through the stars fever passed through me like an arrow

While I endure in soaring pain
Shall I condemn the greatest shame?
Shall I reign?

Under a mourning grief the darkest void
I bear the agony of homeland soil
I bear the agony in painful dreaming
Under a mourning grief I am still alive...

In a delirium a farewell to my grief regaining pride that I once lost
After the raging storm of times I calmly sigh
Shadows still linger in the air
