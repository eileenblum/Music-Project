[A year after these these events armies of the two opponents started to gather in Moy-Tura for the final battle. Eighteen thousands Tuatha De Dannan Warriors gathered. They had four secret weapons, gifts of Goddess Mother Earth, with them. First The Spear of Lugh, Second Nuada's sword, Third The Stone of Fal and Fourth The Kettle of Dagdu. On the other side one hundred eighty thousand Fomorians assembled with Balor Of The Evil Eye as their leader.]
