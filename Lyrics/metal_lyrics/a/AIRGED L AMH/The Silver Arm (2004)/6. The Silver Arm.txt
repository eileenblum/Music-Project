[Nuada's soul takes its trip to space and time. His spirit is almost on the other side. Dian Cencht, the healer and the Druids try to help and heal their beloved king, with their spirit. The magic "CLAIMH SOLAIS" is back in his arm, and his arm in his shoulder, an arm that shines, a "SILVER ARM". Nuada is the real king he is the one that comes in harmony with mother earth and the great goddess regains her pride and honor. Nuada the king the new horned god can bring peace to his people.]

I hear the chant of three spells
War witches ease my pain
The sword of light will lead the way
Eyes cold and cruel I am dreaming
Far out of space and time
The Mochin' word shaking my mind

I am in trance
Three days and nights in secret pain
A great palace on the hill...

Helpless and bathed in starlight
I am like a little child
Another part of me is dead and gone
The elements assemble
A mixture out of sand
The cloak of starlight fades away

Master of healing I praise Dian-Cecht
Soil of Eireann I grasp once again
I am he of the silver arm
Master of healing I praise Dian-Cecht
Soil of Eireann I grasp once again
I am he of the silver arm

Sword of light shall guide me through the dark
Long is my journey to the other world
I return now in painful everlasting
I am he of the silver arm

Men of Eireann speak of
Nuada Airged L'amh for days and nights I hung close
I am the son of the Sun
He of the silver arm
My name is carved forever

Battle cry echoed across the hills

Spells of three witches
Bad's prayer to Dian-Cecht
Tuan my companion
Shared and awaited my pain
L'amh, L'Aidir, Abu cried to the echoing hills
Grateful to the sunrise
Rode the high gold of the clouds

Call, call of Danu, call of Danu, call of Danu hear the calling of... [x4]

Master of healing I praise Dian-Cecht
Soil of Eireann I grasp once again
I am he of the silver arm
Master of healing I praise Dian-Cecht
Soil of Eireann I grasp once again
I am he of the silver arm

I am he of the silver arm
