[King is back on his throne and he organizes a big celebration. While the warriors celebrate along with the king, in the great hall, a glowing warrior appeared on his white horse, outside of the walls. He is Lugh, the incarnation of the God Of The Sun, and asks to enter the brotherhood of Tuatha De Dannan. The arrival of Lugh encourages Tuatha De Dannan, and they accept to be trained for battle, while strong Fomorians army is disembarking on shore.]

Through a great celebration on the crest of the hill
Though my coming's a vision revealed
Facing warriors riding with power across
Aonvarr oh my great white horse

Though a man of science and talents I fear
It will take more than knowledge and spears

Dishonor has lasted long enough...

By the Gods I feel a great desire to kill these savages
By the Gods I will kill them myself no one now will be spared

Deep into the palace
Seeing all within the crystal ball
He's your own grandson
And his coming today has been long foretold
Druids and sorcerers of the Fommor gathered all around
Summoning battalions
Made an army of power invincible
Hoisting their sails went away across the distant shore
There was only one man who
Could stand up against the Fommorians
Hoisting their sails went away across the distant shore
There was only one man who
Could stand up against the Fommorians

Deep into the palace

He's your own grandson
And his coming today has been long foretold
Druids and sorcerers of the Fommor gathered all around
Summoning battalions
Made an army of power invincible
Hoisting their sails went away across the distant shore
There was only one man who
Could stand up against the Fommorians
Hoisting their sails went away across the distant shore
There was only one man who
Could stand up against the Fommorians
