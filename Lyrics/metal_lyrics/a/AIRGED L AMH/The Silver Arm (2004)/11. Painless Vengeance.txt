[In the mist of war Nuada was dominated by the mania of battle. He killed hundreds of enemies and reached in front of Balor. The great king sacrificed himself for glory and freedom of Tuath De Dannan, which caused Lugh to rush screaming into the battle seeking vengeance for the death of his king.]

High over plains and mountains
With riders by my side
Too late now for the summons
Must pay a higher price

The stormy clouds I scatter
Draw powers from the Sun
A single star now shinning
Above the clearing sky

Charging into the spiral mist
Fires of human flesh
It's too late for the rescue of my friend

In the cold nights of loneliness
A lifeless broken shadow
Saw Nuada in the coils of demon
Rest in peace my hero king
I burst in anger
Meet your equal Balor wizard

Cold nights of loneliness
A lifeless broken shadow
Saw Nuada in the coils of demon

So free the land from strangers
So free the land from foe
I circle precious shadow
I see so far below

Farewell my friend in honor I will avenge your death
The solar powers is with me until the end

In the cold nights of loneliness
A lifeless broken shadow
Saw Nuada in the coils of demon
Rest in peace my hero king
I burst in anger
Meet your equal Balor wizard

Cold nights of loneliness
A lifeless broken shadow
Saw Nuada in the coils of demon
