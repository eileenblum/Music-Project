[Great fires in battleships gave the impression that Duatha De Dannan arrived in clouds of mist. Tuan the Great Seahawk glorifies the liveness of the invaders and their king Nuada. But the nightmares foretell the destruction of Eochai McErk, King of Fir-Bolg. The fate of the king is already sealed and his death sure, in the forthcoming battle. And era ends and another one, heroic comes.]

King of the Eireann Eochai Mac-Erc why are you fading away?
Soon you will be falling dead
Visions you saw you don't understand standing again on the edge

You walk through the path of your future calling
For you death has been cast
Towards your fate now you are standing
Your reign belongs to the past

Mountains of skulls ravens are rising brothers are turning to dust
Sacred island constantly bleeding creation of your arrogance

You walk through the path of your future calling
For you death has been cast
Towards your fate useless you are standing
Your reign belongs to the past

It is the fate of the king
To face always the steel
It is the fate of the king
Found glorious death by his will

Fear of the one standing before
You walks in the shadow of death
Into his eyes hatred and anguish
Standing forever again

You walk through the path of your future calling
For you death has been cast
Towards your fate useless you are standing
Your reign belongs to the past

It is the fate of the king
To face always the steel
It is the fate of the king
Found glorious death by his will

Crom!
