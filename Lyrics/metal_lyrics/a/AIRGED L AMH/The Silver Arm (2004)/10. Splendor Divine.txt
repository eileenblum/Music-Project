[Nuada with the sword of light at hand, rushed into the opponents and shed disaster and devastation. Fomorians reacted fast and the battle started to become extremely lethal for both sides. Many great warriors fell on that day.]

Dazzling battalions move across the white dew
Three separate smaller squares multiplying
Leaders of three raging groups
Standing in the center
Fires gashing out of hills Balor is waiting

Evil and darkness I feel hung in the air
Pounding in everyone's heart all creatures hiding
Endless destruction I fear Battle of Moy-Tura
Suffer the testing of time shadows of worm-god

Help me put an end to this slaughter
I cry out to you for the shake of our youth
Sword of light shall I bear to the last of my breath
Through the eye of the Balor I stare
Sword of light shall I bear to the last of my breath
The decision is mine now to take

As I watched I saw the shadow grouching closer
Crimson light infused his silver arm
And gave him magic strength
All the splendor of his father
God of shining glows eternal
Balor's demon God awaited
Him to take his life away

Help me put an end to this slaughter
I cry out to you for the shake of our youth
Sword of light shall I bear to the last of my breath
Through the eye of the Balor I stare
Sword of light shall I bear to the last of my breath
The decision is mine now to take

To destroy the demon's an obscene reality
For the demon's changed it's shape and living form
Though I know that there's no hope for me him to defeat
May the hearts of my people
Enlightened in their homeland
