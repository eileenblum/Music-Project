[Red mist sticks king's Nuada mind, when he loses his two sons in the battlefield. The beonze smell of blood awakens the power of the Goddess within the king's muscles. Battle frenzy turns to epilepsy, a state called "War Spasm". His body took a really strange shape. He bends and his body forms a rainbow, so strange and so strong. But the price is high, Nuada loses his arm and the supreme victory brings his decline too. The mutilated king couldn't rule the land because of his wounds. He couldn't be married to Goddess Mother Earth so there was war and desolation.]

Battle frenzy my body shakes the Earth
Mists of poison spiral around me
As the dawn of battle rages on and on
The stench of death has filled the evening

Fearsome warriors ride in silence

Strong the great champion of Fir-Bolg stood firm
As the armies of Nuada
Were slaughtered and butchered to death

I am determined to banish the evil's domain
Power, fierce and hatred are my only faithful friends

Battle frenzy the Earth my body shakes
Restless spirits gather around me
Feel the anguish of that long day never fades
For power and glory the harvest of bloodshed

I am determined to banish the evil's domain
Power, fierce and hatred are my only faithful friends
