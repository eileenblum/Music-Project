[God of the sun was facing the total darkness of Balor's eye. The armies of Tuatha De Dannan destroyed the  Fomrians who were scattered defeated. Lugh exterminated the Evil Eye and ended Balor's domain. The battle ended in glory but the cost was high.]

The eye of the myth has opened wide
Like a path of terror straight to the tower
Vengeance now is all I seek
In the circle of this strange machine
Fires rising from below
As I gaze in wonder the evil throne of
Balor of the evil eye
Signaled to the Druids and to his wife

March on to battle for it's time to fight
Spears of lightning aiming high
Blazing comets through the sky
Wizard fear my great war cry
I shall end your time

With a stroke I take the bastards head
Evil eye is sealed in death
Loch na Suil a lake of icy streams
The remains of end domain

Wasted in this holy war
And so many brave have fallen into
Shadow-valley of the dead
Hope remains alive instead
Voices linger in the air
And a mist of blood has taken over
Ghostly figures in pain
For the prophecy came true that day

March on to battle for it's time to fight
Spears of lightning aiming high
Blazing comets through the sky
Wizard fear my great war cry
I shall end your time
I shall end your time
