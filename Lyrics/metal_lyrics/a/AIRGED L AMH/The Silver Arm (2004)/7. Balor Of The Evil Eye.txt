[Nuada's return to the throne, marks the end of Brea's ruling and without his will he is enforced to compromise everything that he had gained with Tuatha De Dannan. So Breas describes the facts to his father Elatha ruler of the Foworians and he with his turn sends the Balor Of The Evil Eye , King Of The Demons. He had the eye of destruction. The eye would be opened only in the battlefield and it was able to destroy an army even if it was consisting of ten thousand warriors.]

In the dark forest
Of his mind and soul
I follow the path the greed of the king
Deep and frozen seas
Sights of wounded souls
Leading him to the land of lord of Seathroll

Oh, cursed land of Fomorians
Lay your hands on this king

I've seen the Balor smile
I've seen the Runes
Fomorians run like dogs
Thirsty for blood
The Oghams shape in great standing stones
A gory treason a mighty contract
Enslave the tribes of famous Mother Earth

Lugh
God of the Sun
Embrace the Tuatha De Dannan
Nuada of the Silver Arm
Will claim his rightful place as king

I am the Balor of the Evil Eye
The great sorcerer, a mind of evil
The art of magic handed to me from
Ancient chronicles of lost Atlantis
I am the one who'll rape your land
Your Godless womb, I'll saw the black seed

Lugh
God of the Sun
Embrace the Tuatha De Dannan
Nuada of the Silver Arm
Will claim his rightful place as king
