It was an outbreak of evil, chant of a spell over the raging sea
Has taken over, spreading darkness

Town of a god that has fallen, people so desperate losing belief
Another symbol now arises

[Chorus:]
Kneel to the one, out of the depths of hell
A grusom god will soon become a nightmare
In this ritual lair
Eternal one, out of the deepest ark
A grusom god will soon become a nightmare
In this ritual lair

One with a curse that was spoken, out of the abyss and breaching within
Crawling their way on to salvation

Inter the sign of the deep ones, ruins of life made of power and greed
Sinking below towards the altar

[Chorus:]
Kneel to the one, out of the depths of hell
A grusom god will soon become a nightmare
In this ritual lair
Eternal one, out of the deepest ark
A grusom god will soon become a nightmare
In this ritual lair
