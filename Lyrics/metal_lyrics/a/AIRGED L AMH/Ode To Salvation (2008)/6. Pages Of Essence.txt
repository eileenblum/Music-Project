As silence was breathing, the taste of blood they've shared
Staring in shadows and watching..

In sight of you, they'll set it free
Pages of essence and bloodshed

Inside this shallow place cold darkness now surrounding
As wolves and vampires gathering
War made for dominance took part that raging winter
Silent screaming in the air..

[Chorus:]
Solemnly crawl, bloodshed will purify
Their evil
Onwards they'll go, power and greed taken control

No place for inner peace and mercy for the living
The seed of life is shattering
Beneath this masquerade, the war for dominance reigns
Shall live forever through blood and our veins...

[Chorus:]
Solemnly crawl, bloodshed will purify
Their evil
Onwards they'll go, power and greed taken control...
