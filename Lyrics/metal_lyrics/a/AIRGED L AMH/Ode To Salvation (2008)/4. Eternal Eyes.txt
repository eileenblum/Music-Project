There can be, only one survivor
He who'll stand, this final hour
A conflict of immortals-The call of the quickening

Our sleepless eyes are watching you
Disguised-The ones that fallen
With swords in hand they're lingering onwards the final path

[Chorus:]
So fight on, throughout the ages,
You have entered the hall of the damned
Fight on, breathe the wind of the end [x2]

Headless their souls are taken all
An honoured death forsaken
The price of eternity, it's the final showdown

In times of darkness and of light
A sign-Struck of thunder
Reminding destiny to all, it's the call..

[Chorus:]
So fight on, throughout the ages,
You have entered the hall of the damned
Fight on, breathe the wind of the end [x2]

Breathe the wind of the end...
