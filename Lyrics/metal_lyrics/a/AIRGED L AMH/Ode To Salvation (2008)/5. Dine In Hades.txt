Sunrise-is spreading across the dying land
No escaping for those who bare the oath
Betrayed-forgotten shall gather all their strength
For the Persian army draws near

Rise-your banners, march through the fields
For your fate as defenders is sealed
Hold on-my brothers, on to your ground
To the last man, together shall wither

[Chorus:]
Lead us all the way, Endeavour, fight for freedom
Through the flaming gates, it's time to make a stand
For eternity, legendary shall live on
All three hundred ones , honoured they fall

Soul-salvation, blessed holy cause
As the chapter of ignorance closed
You'll be-remembered on forevermore
For devotion and pledge to your sword

[Chorus:]
Lead us all the way, Endeavour, fight for freedom
Through the flaming gates, it's time to make a stand
All three hundred Spartans
REMEMBER US
