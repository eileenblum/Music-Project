Behold of the mighty one, ruler of souls
On with houndogs and riders
Infidels hide-a houl in the night
Path of leader's rising

[Bridge:]
Known As Wild hunter
Through the waves of the rune sound the horn
The Brave shall perish
To the field of the battle

Turning of time through witching midnight
Crows are guarding the skies
Wings of the storm, carrying out souls
Those of the dead and faithfull

[Bridge:]
Known As Wild hunter
Through the waves of the rune sound the horn
The Brave shall perish
To the field of the battle

[Chorus:]
It's the coming of the storm
For the wild hunt is on
And the rage of winds shall now be heard
Again throughout the land(x2)
Turning of time, breaching daylight
Path of leader unfolds
The Brave have perished
to the field of the conflict-No!!!

[Chorus:]
It's the coming of the storm
For the wild hunt is on
And the rage of winds shall now be heard
Again throughout the land [x2]

On through the land...
