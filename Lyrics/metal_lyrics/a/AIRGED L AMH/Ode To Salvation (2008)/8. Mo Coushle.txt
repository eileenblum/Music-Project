Now i shall gaze upon a star,
Inside me struggling on, forevermore
I know that i can't hold on to your shade
Wandering alone until it fades

Will i ever see your face again??
In pain and anguish i am living every day
On the fields that I've grown i heard you say,
You'd never go away....

[Chorus:]
In mists of afterlife appear
And by the sense of your presence
No hesitation, doubt or fear, another life soon to reveal
And as the sunlight fills the sky, tonight arise and hide
Forever here in mists of afterlife.

Where solitude embraces me,
I'll hold upon the dark eternity
By the winter's march, slowly i decay
Wandering alone so far away..

[Chorus:]
In mists of afterlife appear
And by the sense of your presence
No hesitation, doubt or fear, another life soon to reveal
And as the sunlight fills the sky, tonight arise and hide
Forever here in mists of afterlife..

I see my life that passes by
A touch before my weary eyes
And on this night all are fading away
Feeling my heart's growing cold
I know I've got to carry on
Inside my dreams try to hold you
