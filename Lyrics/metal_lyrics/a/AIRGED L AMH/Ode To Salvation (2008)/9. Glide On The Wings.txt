I've fought the battle to survive, the winds of war kept me alive
another voice's calling, so far and high above
thy destiny it lingers on, waves me to hold and follow on
The quest for grace is calling, valkyrie take me on

[Chorus:]
Flyin'away, forever far away
Seeking for your embrace
Through death and fire's your grace
Take me high, over the burning sky
Seeking for your embrace
Through death and fire's your grace

The clouds of grey shall carry me, on to your arms I'll be set free
Another chapter's closing, one with my precious one
Towards the light I'm reaching on, the path of life will now unfold
the wrath of war has ended with fatal cost..

[Bridge:]
Through the winds i shall call your name
'till the neverending dawn
where the eagles cross the sky, I duel forevermore

[Chorus:]
Flyin'away, forever far away
Seeking for your embrace
Through death and fire's your grace
Take me high, over the burning sky
Seeking for your embrace
Through death and fire's your grace
