Among the clans raised a searching unity
Opposing to all so strong and brave
Onwards goddodin ride legions under oath
Travelled for miles across the land

[Chorus:]
Poet an eirin-sorrow, shall live through me and follow
Injustice/cruelty sealed away
Oh, only soul survivor so deep in wounds devoured
Knowledge of truth in a night of ache

In desperation bounded by gatraeth
Argoiled the faithfull, my best friend
Around this silence the dark nymph whispering
Sowing the seeds of decadence

Ode to salvation, hold within and take my pain away
Sunlight decades and wearing thin
The field of darkness rises high and covers all the land
Purification withering...

Solitude wanders as death grows stronger
By the hour that slips within my grasp
A touch of freedom spared for the chosen few
A song full of grief and ignorance

[Chorus:]
Poet an eirin-sorrow, shall live through me and follow
Injustice/cruelty sealed away
Oh, only soul survivor so deep in wounds devoured
Knowledge of truth in a night of ache

Around this silence, the dark nymph whispering
Sowing the seeds of decadence
