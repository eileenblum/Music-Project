I'm alone in this field of death, as the gods are laughing with me
My men are heading to Valhalla and I am looking for the heart of my kingdom
My sword is filled with blood searching for a lost victory
Flags are waving on top of me, estruction all around me
Never ending race, created just for me
Enormous clouds up in eternal skies
The rage of gods have in target always me
Cause I never bow down to them
Heart of my kingdom where have you been
I've been bleeding so much
Heart of my kingdom you couldn't see
I've been fighting for so long
Surrounded by traitors I couldn't see, but now I understand
My sword was my only friend they'll taste, now my revenge
I see death flying over my head
This rotten world is driving me insane
I don't know for what I am fighting anymore
I've lost my way in your damned land
Heart of my kingdom where have you been
I've been bleeding so much
Heart of my kingdom you couldn't see
I've been fighting for so long
Last king in the last battle Thor I beg you give me your hammer
Odin help me give me your strength
Valhalla is calling me to fight again bristling spears leading a slaughter
My last battle has finally come Niord give me your waves of rage
Stand by my side as I fight for my soul
My glory weird now it's calling
Fields of glory are filled by my dreams twilight of the gods I feel it coming
Ragnarok seems quite bizarre
Odin lord of Nordic skies Zeus master of the south
All you gods in ancient Europe in their intolerance
Gods, demons laughing with me my blood is running down my land
Valkyries are waiting as my soul is flying away my time has come to die
Now that I am an einherjer and my heart is burning in flames of Midgard
In the land that you are calling heaven
I spit your values adoring my ancient world
