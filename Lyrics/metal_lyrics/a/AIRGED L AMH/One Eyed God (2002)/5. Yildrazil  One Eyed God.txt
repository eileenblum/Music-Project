God of gods you one eyed god Odin is your eternal name
Master of our world ruler of our lives
God of Runes and of the magic you are the one who live up in the skies
You have drunk from the source of wisdom so you obtain your knowledge
Ride the Sleipner and come to me tell me what is coming up
Send your raven's all around the world learn the rage of the giants
Prepare for them a great battle
One eyed god you mighty one I am calling you eternal one
You're the first who fall and last you always knew what we become
Far beyond the godly rainbow your armies suddenly appeared
Defending our proud values of a glorious ancient world
Giants, demons and the dragons they are threaten still our dreams
But they will not survive to see the godly reborn
Ride the Sleipner and come to me tell me what is coming up
Send your raven's all around the world learn the rage of the giants
Prepare for them a great battle
One eyed god you mighty one I am calling you eternal one

You're the first who fall and last you always knew what we become
