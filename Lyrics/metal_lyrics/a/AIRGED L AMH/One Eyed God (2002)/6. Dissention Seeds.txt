I will remember the civil war, when brothers' blood run down the plain
Misshaped specters march the sky, winged warriors touched the land from high

The use of witchcraft burned the sky, horror appears in Fir-Bolg's eyes
Sessair calls the great Crom, a creature beyond ancient times

Carnun sawed the dissention seeds, ever since watched my nation fade

These were the first Dissention seeds, harvest of the beast

And as the battles have begun the plain seem like a bloody veil
A nameless hero falling dead between so many other brave

Carnun sawed the dissention seeds, ever since watched my nation fade

Graves and Pillars now they rise, illusions of a haunted land
They died in vain and endless pain but in our minds they still remain

Grief in the hearts of men sighed, even for Tuatha De Dannan

Carnun sawed the dissention seeds, ever since watched my nation fade
