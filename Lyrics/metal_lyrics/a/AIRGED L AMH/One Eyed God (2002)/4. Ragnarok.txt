Look over there where the lightning strike higher from all the skies
Vanir and Aesir are trying to avoid the final fall of the gods
Thunders are rolling Thor's hammer is falling
The greatest of battles has begun
Odin is calling the armies of the world einherjer fight against the wolf
Valkyries flying all over Midgard einherjer hail in Odin's name
Thunders are rolling Thor's hammer is falling
As einherjer are dying by demon's swords a new beginning is coming from above
Thor's tears will never be forgotten as Ragnarok is calling on and on

Soul of the Ragnarok will never be forgotten cause it was the twilight of the gods
Battlecries will keep on riding the sky as long the guardians of the past
Thunders are rolling Thor's hammer is falling
The greatest of battles has begun
