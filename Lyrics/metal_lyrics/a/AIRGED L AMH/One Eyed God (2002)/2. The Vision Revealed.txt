Weird Nordic veil of snow side by side it covers the Midgard of the past
Forbidden omen has been forgotten now it is time for the gods to pay the price
We should have listened to Voluspa's words, ow we will fight with broken swords
Road to Valhalla has been vanished
Hell is drinking some wine in Youletide's day at Nifelheim
Gates of Asgard will be closed, and we the people put the blame to the gods
We should have listened to Voluspa's words, ow we will fight with broken swords
Proud and glory have gone they are only visions, respect and passion are not real, hey have disappeared
Weakness and sickness around us they have rotten our dreams
Death, sorrow, madness images of twilight
Gods embrace me with all your love Freya send me Valkyries to take my soul
Brothers, einherjer don't cry we'll fight side by side
Proceed my friend stand by the fire
That was the story don't call me liar, raven's will have a feast tonight
But we'll be in the great halls of Valhalla
We should have listened to Voluspa's words, ow look towards to Nihelheim darkest halls
