[Dream:]
In the world of my subconscious, a realm of the unknown
a vision is carved by the almighty hand
The agony of a thousand souls supressed by life itself
released unto the lord by his command.
My hands are covered with the blood, the blood of his salvation.
His spirit will live eternally

Take his life, by your command.
A sacrifice, by your command.

As I rise from my troubled sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep
wondering if he has chosen me to do his work, I speak no blasphemy
Do I confess? I am terrified, I cannot run, there is no place to hide
I search for help, but there's nobody there for my dream is now a recurring
...Nightmare

Brother of the holy order, I seek your help
Understand my plight, help me fight this curse that bestows me
My son you must not fight, for this is no cure
but a mission you should undertake
to free a soul from the grasp of
...Satan

So that night I did dream of mysteries untold
In the presence of the heavens was I
I could see for myself all the evils of the world
in all their morbid glory
Men took part in rites to praise the black messiah
the beast they call "The Evil One"
As voices in my head did tell me of my task
To release the soul of my only son

[Spirit voices:]
Take his life, by your command.
A sacrifice, by your command.
Fill the chalice, cleanse the soul
Save him now, in the chapel of salvation
[repeat]

[Possession:]
Insanity dwells in the mind of a man who will take the life of his only son
Screaming and pounding inside his head as voices whisper... It must be done
