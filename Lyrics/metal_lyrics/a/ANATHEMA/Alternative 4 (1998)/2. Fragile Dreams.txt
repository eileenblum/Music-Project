Countless times I trusted you,
I let you back in,
Knowing... Yearning... you know
I should have run... but I stayed

Maybe I always knew
My fragile dreams would be broken... for you

Today I introduced myself
To my own feelings
In silent agony, after all these years
They spoke to me... after all these years

Maybe I always knew
My fragile dreams would be broken... for you
