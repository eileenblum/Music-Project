My paralyzed heart
Is bleeding...
My love's torn apart
Desire to be free

A bleak garden to cry
When my inamorato died

Loveless so real
Lifeline of mortality
Condemned to misery
Restless oblivion forever

A bleak garden to cry
When my inamorato died

My visionary dreams are vanquished
Aspirations fade away
Reverence dies within

A bleak garden to cry
When my inamorato died
