There is a whole mountain
And a river runs through it
If you split my mountain wide
You would find many rivers

Among flocks of non-white doves
And non-temptable mortals
The kingdom is much more real
And the beauty is endless

Only when tightened beyond recall
Is your necklace a blessing
Leave your pearls in the sea
You undeserved bitch
You are not worthy of such a treasure

My hand on your heart, I know there is a beating
In this oh so bleak landscape
There are many mountains
...but not so much water.

My Kingdom
