Be smothered in life
Listen, listen, listen
The written word will devour you
And burn your mind
I'm burning your mind
I am entering your soul
My promise to love and caress you
Mirrors destiny and breathes the universe

Before Tomb ........
(Regression)

Taste me
Let the angels wings close
And shield you
I bleed for you

In the shadows and the recesses
You'll find dark
Yearn (me)
From the dark all is revealed
Light sheds through

Bleed with me
We will share the light and dark
Together and more
