My life's minds plagued by lyssophobia
In a cage solitude locks me in
As the dar blackened walls close in on me
Dementia strikes, there's no turning back

Drowning in the stygian sea
As those voices repeat to me my malediction
Memento Mori
Remember you must die

A gratuitous wraith of violence
Blots out the light of my mind
For on this night someone must pay
For the cost of my life

For me to escape the curse of perdition
This poor, weaker being must receive pain
As you wince at the actions of my sadist ways
And cry at the throes of your moribund state

A Daemon issues your last rites
Pater Noster Upto In Terra
I break, I twist, I burn, I destroy
Memento Mori

As the candle of life, that burned in your heart
Is doused by the grip of death's hand
Asmodeus, the spirit of lust
Bears his necrophile ways
For the wishes of the demon in black
My largesse in life should be immortality
Dislike the weak, mortal humans

But in life there's always death
A multitude are born to be damned
His perdisized body will burn forever
In the scorching flames of Gehenna.
