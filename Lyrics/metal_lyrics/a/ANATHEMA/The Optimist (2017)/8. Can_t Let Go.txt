On and on [3x]
I can't let go on and on I can't let go

If you are not there
Coming down this road again
If you are love, where are you
Coming down and down again
'Cause I can't let go on and on can't let go on and on

If you are not there
Coming down this road again
If you are love then where are you
Coming down and down again
If you are love then where are you

Something wrong is wrong again
I can't let go on and on I just can't let go
