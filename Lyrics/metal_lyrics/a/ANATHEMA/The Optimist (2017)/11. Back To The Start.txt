You don't understand
We don't understand [3x]
All I need is you
I just know all I need is you

'Cause they don't understand
'Cause they don't talk for me
There ain't no master plan
I came in to make peace
The more we're made to suffer
The more we're made to care
And all the time in the world
Gonna wish until it hurts
'Cause they don't understand

And all I need is you
But you believe it's true
And all I need is you
But you believe it's true
It's impossible
Unbelievable
Do you see it now?
Do you see it now?
And our lives comin' back to the start
