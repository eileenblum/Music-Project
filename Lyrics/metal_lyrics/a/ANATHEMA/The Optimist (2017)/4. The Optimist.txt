Drive at night in the slow lane
Rabbit in the headlights
Run away, run away
(I know, I know, I know, I know)
The great escape in the slow lane
Before it's too late to
Run away, run away
(I know, I know, I know, I know)

The life we left behind
Sleeping all our lives
The life we left behind
Dreaming all our lives

In moonlight
We ride on heart's design
I won't let go of you and I
Run for our lives
Don't look behind
