Hold on, hold on
For dear life
And run, and run
All night
For you are loved in endless ways

Stay with me
Please believe
I can be your memory

My world will never be the same
And my heart is never going to break
For you are loved in endless ways
Are loved in endless ways

Hold on, hold on
For dear life
And run, and run
All night
For you are loved in endless ways
Are loved in endless ways

There's no way of knowing
What will be waiting
There's no way of knowing
The dream I'm creating
There's no way of knowing

The dream I'm creating
[10x]
