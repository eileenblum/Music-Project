Tonight, let go
Let go of everything
Inside
'Cause I said so
We'll make everything inside all right

'Cause I ... I'm leaving it behind
Stop feeling dead inside tonight
'Cause I ... am leaving it behind
Start feeling satisfied inside

The lies they know
They know every little thing inside
But I said no
And I'll make everything inside all right
'Cause I ... I'm leaving it behind
Stop feeling dead inside

Tonight
'Cause I ... am leaving it behind
Start feeling satisfied
Inside

Tonight let go
Let go of everything inside
'Cause I said so
We'll make everything inside all right
'Cause I ... I'm leaving it behind
Stop feeling dead inside
Tonight

'Cause I ... I'm leaving it behind
Start feeling satisfied
Inside
