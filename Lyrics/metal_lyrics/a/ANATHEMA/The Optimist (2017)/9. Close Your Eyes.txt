Close your eyes, sleep tonight
And dream on, just dream on
Through dark roads
Through dark roads
For you and I, yes you and I
Which way to go?

All that you need is inside
And all that you need is inside
And what do you see when you turn out the lights?

It's OK, it's OK, it's just a dream, go back to sleep.
