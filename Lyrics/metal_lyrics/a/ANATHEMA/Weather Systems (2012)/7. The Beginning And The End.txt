Inside this cold heart is a dream
That's locked in a box that I keep
Buried a hundred miles deep
Deep in my soul in a place that's surrounded by aeons of silence

And somewhere inside is the key
To everything I want to feel
But the dark summer dawns of my memory
Are lost in a place that can never be

Can someone please show me the way?
Can someone please help me?
Because I cannot see
The silence is raging!
Silence is raging

Silence, silence
Fade into silence
Silence, silence
Fade into silence

Memory, memory
Inside is the key to
Memory, memory
Inside is the key to memory
