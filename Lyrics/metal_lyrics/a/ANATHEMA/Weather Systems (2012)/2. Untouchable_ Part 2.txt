Why I should feel this way [2x]
Why I should feel the same

Something I cannot say [2x]
Something I can't explain

I feel you outside
At the edge of my life

I see you walk by
At the edge of my sight

Why I should follow my heart [2x]
Why I should fall apart

Why I should follow my dreams [2x]
Why I should be at peace

I feel you outside
At the edge of my life

I see you.. walk by
At the edge of my sight

I had to let you go
To the setting sun

I had to let you go
And find a way back home

I had to let you go
To the setting sun

I had to let you go
And find a way back home

(When I dream, I see you) [2x]

I've never seen a light that's so bright [3x]

Blinded by the light that's inside [2x]

Blinded by the light that's inside you

I had to let you go
To the setting sun

I had to let you go
And find a way back home
