Sunlight failed but only for a while
In the moonlight pale someone made me smile
The shining almost took me but I made it through that night
And in the morning life it graced me and I ran for miles

Sunlight in a billion dreams that are lost and won
Moonlight in spite of all you've seen there's only one way out

Say you will love me until I leave the world
