[Music &amp; lyrics by John Douglas]

Never, never, never, never ever, never leave you
I will, I will always, always be here for you
Found you, found you
I will, never ever leave you
Never
I will always be here with you
Getting better, better, better, better

It's getting colder, I'm getting colder, colder, it's getting colder
Let it get colder until I can't feel anything at all
It's getting colder,
It's getting colder, colder

Come on, on me
Touching, laughing, ha ha
Love me, love me for me
Holding, watching, loving
Getting better better better better

It's getting colder, I'm getting colder, colder, it's getting colder
Let it get colder until I can't feel anything at all
It's getting colder, it's getting colder, colder, I'm getting colder
Let it get colder until I can't feel anything at all

The shadows, the shadows

It ebbs and flows
And comes and goes
And rips you up and lets you go
It eats inside and splits your mind
As you search around for others kind
To gather strength from the depth
To fight the fight from day 'til night, 'til night, 'til night, 'til night, 'til night, 'til night

This beautiful feeling soars over the skies
Moving through my body out my mind
It rises up and floods my brain
This is fucking insane, this is fucking insane

Am I still here?
This wonderful feeling
Am I still alive?
This wonderful feeling
Am I still here?
This wonderful feeling
Am I still alive?
This wonderful feeling
