[Spoken:]
And I felt myself going. I was in a great deal of pain. It was a very frightening experience I began to slip. I just started to feel myself going, and I remember trying to hold on âI'll be ok, I'll be okâ and it got to a point where I just couldn't.
And everything began to just become very quiet and I can remember with every ounce of strength I had, I wanted to say goodbye to my wife. It was important to me.
And I did, I remember just turning my head and looking at her and saying: âI'm gonna dieâ âGoodbye Joanâ, and I didâ¦
It was then that I experienced... experienced what we call a near death experience, for me there was nothing near about it, it was there.
It was a total immersion in light, brightness, warmth, peace, security.
I did not have an out-of-body-experience, I did not see my body or anyone about meâ¦ I just immediately went into this beautiful bright light.
It's difficult to describe, as a matter of fact it's impossible to describe, verbally it cannot be expressed, itâs something which becomes you and you become it.
I could say that I was peace, I was love, I was the brightness, it was part of me.

Goodbye my friend, life will never end.
And I feel like youâ¦
And I breath on truth.

Love is the life breath of all I see.
Love is true life inside of me.
And I know you somehow as I hold you in my heart, in my heart.

Thereâs a fire in the sky, and I know itâs youâ¦
There`s a light, it`s all around, and I know it`s you, I know it`s you
And I dream like you
âcause I believe in truth.

For I was always thereâ¦
I will always be there...

[Spoken:]
It's just so beautiful.
It was eternity, it's like I was always there, and I will always be there, that my existence on earth was just a very brief, instant...
I could say that I was peace, I was love, I was the brightness, it was part of me.
