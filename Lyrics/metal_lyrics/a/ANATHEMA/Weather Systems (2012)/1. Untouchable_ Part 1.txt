and I feel like I knew you before
and I guess that you can hear me through this song

and my love will never die
and my feelings will always shine
and my love will never die
and my feelings will always shine

and I know that you just want me to belong to someone
and I guess that now I`ll just be moving on to someone

and my love will never die
and my feelings will always shine
and my love will never die
and my feelings will always shine

I`ve never betrayed your trust
I`ve never betrayed your faith
I`ll never forsake your heart
I`ll never forget your face

there`s a feeling that I can`t describe
there`s a reason that I cannot hide
`cause I`ve never seen a light that`s so bright
the light that shines behind your eyes

I`ve never betrayed your trust
I`ve never betrayed your faith
I`ll never forsake your heart
I`ll never forget your face

there`s feeling that I can`t describe
a reason that I cannot hide
I`ve never seen a light that`s so bright
the light that shines behind your eyes

I can see this life and what you mean to me
and when I dreamed, I dreamed of you
then I wake, tell me what I do

I had to let you go
to the setting sun
I had to let you go
to find your way back home
I had to let you go
to the setting sun
I had to let you go
to find your way back home
