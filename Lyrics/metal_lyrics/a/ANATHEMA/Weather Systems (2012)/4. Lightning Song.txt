Lightning splits the sky.
Shining blinding white
And here I lie almost asleep
Reckoning in a place of peace

And I feel,
I found my place
In time and space
In hope and faith
And love I give
My mind is clear
I have no fear
I shed no tears
For you my dear

This world is wonderful, so beautiful,
If only you can open up your mind and see

Your world is everything you ever dreamed of
If only you can open up your mind and see.

This world is wonderful, so beautiful,
If only you can open up your mind and see

Your world is everything you ever dreamed of
If only you can open up your mind and see.

The beauty that is here
Beauty that is here.
