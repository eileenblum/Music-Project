It's been a long, cold winter
without you
I've been crying on the inside
Over you
You've just slipped through my fingers
So life turned away
It's been a long, cold winter
Since that day..
And it's hard to find, hard to find, hard to find the strength now but I try
And I don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna, don't wanna to speak now of what's gone by

Cause no matter what I say, no matter what I do
I can't change what happened, can't change what happened
No matter what I say, no matter what I do
Can't change what happened, can't change what happened
no matter what I say, no matter what I do
Can't change what happened, can't change what happened
No, no, can't change
You've just slipped through my fingers
And now I feel so ashamed
You've just slipped through my fingers
and I've paid
