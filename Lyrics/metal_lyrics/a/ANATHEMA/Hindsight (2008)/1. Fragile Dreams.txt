"Tonight your soul sleeps, but one day you will feel real pain,
maybe then you will see me as I am,
A fragile wreck on a storm of emotion"

Countless times I trusted you,
I let you back in,
Knowing... Yearning... you know
I should have run... but I stayed

Maybe I always knew,
My fragile dreams would be broken for you.

Today I introduced myself,
To my own feelings,
In silent ceremony, after all these years,
They spoke to me... after all these years

Maybe I always knew...
