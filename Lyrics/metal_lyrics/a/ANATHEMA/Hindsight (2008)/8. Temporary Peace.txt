Deep inside the silence
Staring out upon the sea
The waves are washing over
Half forgotten memory

Deep within the moment
Laughter floats upon the breeze
Rising and falling dying down within me
And I swear I never knew how it could be
And all this time all I had inside was what I couldn't see
I swear I never knew how it couldn't be
All the waves are washing over all that hurts inside of me

Beyond this beautiful horizon lies a dream for you and I
This tranquil scene is still unbroken by the rumours in the sky
But there's a storm closing in voices crying on the wind
The serenade is growing colder breaks my soul that tries to sing
And there's so many many thoughts when I try to go to sleep
But with you I start to feel a sort of temporary peace

There's a drift in and out
