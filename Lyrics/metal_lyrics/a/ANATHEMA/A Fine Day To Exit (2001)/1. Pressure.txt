As the pressure grows and these feelings flow
Trample on bodies, bodies in holes of faith
Times I've asked the lord for forgiveness
While kept under a spell of a sweating locust's breath
No need to tell me 'cause it's written on your face
Sliding down now with the black lights shining

I don't care where you go you won't get away from me
Black as the night is day filled with no sympathy
Marching down the hall for a misery
I don't care where you go, you won't get away from me

Mouth tastes of sick, stomach twist inside
Everything's wrong and I can't get away
The gravity of fear you can feel it coming near
It's coming straight for you, it'll twist and drag you down

I don't care where you go, you won't get away from me
