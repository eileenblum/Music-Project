Floating with nowhere to hide
Unspoken twist back inside

How did we get here?
Life don't belong here

Feel like I just never tried
To find a way back to the outside
It stops me from breathing
Kills all the dreaming

Talking to you from the other side of a wall in my mind
And it's clear that you're near to me
I think I found a way to understand why I couldn't see what was happening
The fear overcame me
Took a trip on the inside, I took a trip on the inside
I try to hold on until this feeling is gone
Break through to the other side, I need to break through to the other side
Of everything that is hurting you

I just can't lay down and die
It takes a lifetime to understand why
It seems that you're near me
But you don't seem to hear me
