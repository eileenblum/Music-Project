Seeing is believing but I don't want to know
Walk on through the wasteland I just can't let go
Face down I just break down when I see you cry
All the time

Hold on
Please
Hold on
To me
Tempt fate
Release
Escape

Someone now is screaming as the flames fly high
Think now that we're lost here and we don't know why
Face down I just break down when I see you cry
All the time

Hold on
Please
Hold on
To me
Tempt fate
Release
Escape

Behind those grey and lonely eyes
Unforgotten by time
Reality is dawning
Our spirit is awakening
And somewhere in the hurricane
Hope is waiting
Crying in the distance
And calling out your name
