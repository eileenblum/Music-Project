There's always something
You won't dare to say
Your good intentions
Are boring take me away
If it keeps you sane, then it's okay
If I played it safe, would it save me?

I'd like to get some rest now
If I could just ignore the truth
Scratching at the window
This time I've got to make a move
Ego obliteration
Stand back and watch me melt away
Dissolve all recognition

I've got to burn this weight out of my mind
Running through my veins until I disappear

This feeling is over
This feeling is over me

Climbing up the wall
Going to creep between the cracks
Get out of my skull
Tie the rope around my neck
Destroy all emotion
Going to rip me face to shreds
Cut my eyeballs open

I've got to burn this wait out of my mind
Running through my veins until I disappear

This feeling is over
This feeling is over me
