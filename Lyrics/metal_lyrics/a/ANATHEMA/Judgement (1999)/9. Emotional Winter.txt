Speak to me
For I have seen
Your waning smile
Your scars concealed
So far from home, do you know you're not alone
Sleep tonight
Sweet summer light
Scattered yesterdays, the past is far away

How fast time passed by
The transience of life

Wasted moments won't return
And we will never feel again

Beyond my dreams
Ever with me
You flash before my eyes, a final fading sigh
But the sun will rise
And tears will dry
Of all that is to come, the dream has just begun

And time is speeding by
The transience of life

Wasted moments wont return
And we will never feel again

[Lyrics: V. Cavanagh, Music: D. Cavanagh]
