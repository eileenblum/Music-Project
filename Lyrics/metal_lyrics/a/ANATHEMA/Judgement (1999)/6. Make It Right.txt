I know that I want you
I know that I need you
But I can't pretend that
This'll make it right

You whisper your name
But I can't hear you
Don't leave me behind
Lend me your hand

I can feel them
I think they're closing in
Don't leave me behind
Lend me your hand

Let me feel you
By my side
Be where I can hear you
I long to feel

[Lyrics &amp; Music: J. Douglas]
