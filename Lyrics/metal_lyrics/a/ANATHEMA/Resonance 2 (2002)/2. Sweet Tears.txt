In each others arms
We cried together
And your tears tasted sweet

All is not lost
And never to be forgotten

Like a shiver down my spine
The lonely nights keep falling
And I still want you

All is not lost
And never to be forgotten

She's passed away but dreaming
Her soul's awake and screaming
The weeping willow is weeping
And beneath our hearts...
.. all joy is sleeping
our bliss is carried away... sweet tears
