An unstoppable end
The world turns every day
An ending with no end

So, for this time of morning
I can no longer cry
Even though the story goes on

The script is being written
Start shape our destiny
We are the bible...

Believe in angels, they believe in you
Oh, spread your wings, there is more than this darkness
Open your eyes, the horizon has no end
You can see forever, you can know all time
You can live forever...

Every dusk can blind, as a sunrise on a day
Every sunset there is, lifts the eternal sunrise
And the sunrise ends when the sun dies...
And every ending has an eternal beginning...
We are the bible...
