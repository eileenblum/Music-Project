Now that I've found you
I'm not going to leave you
The world keeps on turning
Spirits reflecting
My heart beats for you

Outside my body
Tonight, in my mind's eye
I need you to hold on

A promise of future
Dreaming in colour
Being together
Spirits reflecting
The feelings is so real
The beauty is endless
For tonight, in my mind's eye
I need you to hold on

Fire
At night
And souls
In flight
And time
Can heal
All scars
Concealed

Because love
Is what we are
How near
Or how far
And life
Will bring
The truth
In dream
