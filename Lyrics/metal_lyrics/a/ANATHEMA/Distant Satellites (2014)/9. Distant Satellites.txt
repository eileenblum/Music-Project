[D. Cavanagh, Douglas]

You sold yourself away
You told yourself it's OK
States creating states
Flowing over the high line

And it makes me wanna cry
Caught you as I floated by
And it makes me wanna cry
Just another distant satellite

So let it take me away
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive inside of here

So let it take me away
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive these dreams

These isolated paths
Is all that I can see?
My faith in gravity
Just about has a hold on me

And it makes me wanna cry
Caught you as I floated by
And it makes me wanna cry
We're just distant satellites

So let it take me away
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive inside of here

So let it take me away
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive inside these dreams
