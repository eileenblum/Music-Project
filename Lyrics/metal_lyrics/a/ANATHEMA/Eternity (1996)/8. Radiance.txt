Inside...
The dark is fading away
I don't want to be alone anymore

Inside...
The light of dawn is here once more

The light...
Darkness is slipping away

Of dawn...
I don't want to be alone

Is here...
Won't you stay?

Not a word passed your lips
Just a golden kiss
As I whispered silently
"Help me through this"
