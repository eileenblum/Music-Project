So little time
Your crystal eyes gaze into mine
A burning flame
Forever dreaming, dreaming a lie

Trapped inside internal eyes
Caressed by innocence, a sanctuary for your mind
Born alone beneath pale sardonic skies
One love, one life, one sorrow

I won't reproach myself this time
A condemned man, granted a sweet reprieve
A turn of fate, a genial twist of the knife
Undying affection for life

[Lyrics &amp; Music: D.Patterson]
