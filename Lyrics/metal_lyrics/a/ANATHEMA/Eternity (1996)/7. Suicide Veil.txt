A sacrifice in the flight of dawn
The beauty of twisted reality
In my heart, my dreams

A sacrifice for freedom
Alone in the grace of the dark
The pains of a failed generation

I longed for the death of the sun
Another glorious revelation
Destiny's plan for ruin

I danced with the shadows
In tranquil chaos, I lay naked in the rain
An interception of light
A disturbing memory
This suicide veil I wear in shame
