Think for yourself you know what you need in this life
See for yourself and feel your soul come alive tonight
Here in the moment we share, trembling between the worlds we stare
Out at starlight enshrined, veiled like diamonds in...

...time can be the answer, take a chance or lose it all
It's a simple mistake to make to create love and to fall
So rise, be your master, you don't need to be a slave
Of memory ensnared in a web, in a cage

I have found my way to fly free from constraints of time
I have soared through the sky seen life far below in mind
Breathed in truth, love, serene, sailed on OCEANS OF BELIEF
Searched and found life inside, we're not just a moment in...

...time can be the answer, take a chance or lose it all
It's a simple mistake to make to create love and to fall
So rise and be your master, you don't need to be a slave
Of memory ensnared in a web, in a cage
In a web, in a cage
In a web, in a cage
In a web, in a cage

It's never too late [repeat]

[Spoken words from "Defending Middle-Earth Tolkien: Myth and Modernity" by Patrick Curry:]
Despair is for people who know, beyond any doubt, what the future is going to bring.
Nobody is in that position.
So despair is not only a kind of sin, theologically, but also a simple mistake, because nobody actually knows.
In that sense there always is hope.
