Needed time to clear my mind
And breathe the free air find some peace there
I used to keep my heart in jail
But the choice was love or fear of pain and

I...
Chose...
Love...
Cos everything is energy and energy is you and me...

Light shines in through an open window
Shines inside your heart and soul and
Light will guide your way through time
And love will help you heal your mind and

Life...
Will...
Be..

Cos everything is energy and energy is you and me...
