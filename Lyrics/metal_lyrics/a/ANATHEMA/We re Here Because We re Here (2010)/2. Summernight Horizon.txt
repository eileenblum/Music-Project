In the moonlight
In the moonlight's pale embrace
We come to know the space between us
The space between us

Dreamlight
Dreamlight comes in waves
(the waves within us)
Starlight
Starlight, silent brakes
(It brakes between us)
To know the space within us
The space within us

In blood red skies
Mind takes flight (the sky is falling)
Oceans rise
Worlds collide
To know the space between us
The space between us

Fly
In a dream so high
Feel so alive
The world is like a jewel in your eyes
One life
Feel it

In the moonlight
The moonlight's pale embrace
(embrace the feeling)
There is no space between us
No space between us

In blood red skies
Tears run dry (the sky is falling)
There is no space between us
