Suddenly... life has new meaning
Suddenly... feeling is being
Suddenly... I don't have to be afraid
Suddenly... All falls into place

And you shine inside
And love stills my mind like the sunrise
Dreaming light of the sunrise

And you shine inside
And love stills my mind like the sunrise
Dreaming light of the sunrise
Dreaming light and ...

I feel you but I don't really know you
I dreamed of you from the moment I saw you
And I've seen the sunrise in your eyes
The sky... the sea... the light

So live your dream beneath the northern horizon
Be at peace, set your heart in flight again
For the light is truth...
The light is you...
