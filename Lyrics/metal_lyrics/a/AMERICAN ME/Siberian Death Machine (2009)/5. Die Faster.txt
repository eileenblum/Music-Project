[Music: Brian, Lyrics: Tony]

Lies, lies. Everything was lies...
Not one truth, everything was a disguise from the start to the end.
You were killing me from the inside out...

Clenched fist over my eyes, I'm still suffering.

This is not the way to fucking live. Suffocate your helpless fucking life away.
Listen. It's the sound of your head exploding. Die faster die... Die

No one will miss you when you're dead and long forgotten. You're fucking dead.
Your cries will go unheard... buried deep in concrete pillars.
Life will go on with no one to remember your name.
Who will remember you? Who will carry your name? ...Suffering
