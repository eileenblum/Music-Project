[Music: Brian, Lyrics: Tony/Cam/Brian]

Hey thanks for listening were American Me!
Tell all your friends to buy our brand new CD!
Let's get some beers and blunts and party in our big blue Chevy!
I promise I won't give you a disease

Living off $5 dollars every single day...
It's hard to pay the bills when you wanna stay away.
5 dudes in a van with a plan....
...Keep the bitches inside cause we wanna bang what we can YEAH!

My friends are your friends. Can we all just get along???

Rollin through In N'Out, Whataburger, Taco Bell, Waffle House, Chick Fillet and don' forget about... the COOKOUT!!!!

Hey thanks for listening were American Me!
Tell all your friends to buy our brand new CD!
Let's get some beers and blunts and party in our big blue Chevy!
I promise you I won't give you a disease, NO!
Lets pack a bong and get this party started!

KITCHEN PARTY SQUAD... OH! Suck my balls!!!
