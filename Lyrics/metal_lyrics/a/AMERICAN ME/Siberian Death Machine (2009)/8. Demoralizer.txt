[Music: Brian/Cam, Lyrics: Tony]

Your life...
You tried to word with poetic phrases but pronounced with decaying tongues...
If anything you're a first class failure... But after all, I am your son.

No, I will not live my life through yours. I will not see through those eyes.
Everything I've heard from your lies reeks of rigor mortis.
Stricken,
Demoralized...

Accentuated songs from your preaching choir days...
How much left do you have to fucking say?

You are the father, I am the son.
Leave me nothing more, I am fucking done.

YOU WERE NEVER THERE, I AM FUCKING DONE.

Walk away... Never man enough to say this is real. You were wrong.

Emaciated times I need you more than ever.
When it's time to die, me and you will be together.
Let's go. Whose to know?
Hand in hand we will find a way to make it through another day...

Another day is another chance to reclaim my place in your heart.
Like father like son.

This is it. You're the only one.
Fuck You. I'm the only one true.
Help me up... Live long demoralizer
