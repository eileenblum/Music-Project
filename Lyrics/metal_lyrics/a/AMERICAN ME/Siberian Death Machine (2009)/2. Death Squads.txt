[Music: Brian, Lyrics: Tony]

Lights are shining at their brightest to take my life away.
Pull me further in. Will I see another day? Pull me in...
Killing is my fucking name... Killing is my name
Don't wake up. Don't wake up.
Feeling is the same when you're dead, locked up, gone...
I know I'm wrong for what I did. I can feel you in my skin

Death squads coming, riots brewing...

Angels falling from the sky bringing plague with blood red eyes.
Fight the fire, blazing battles, double clip loaded. I am animal...
Crash down barriers. Emptiness is filling up. Terror fueled hysteria...

Death squads coming, riots brewing...
