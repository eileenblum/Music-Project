[Music: Brian, Lyrics: Tony]

Slave to your master-keeper...
Your rights have been revoked for the enterprise.
How do you remain alive?
Sever your emotions and say your goodbyes...
This will the last day you will be seen alive.
Alive and confined. Kiss your life away... Goodbye

Dead and gone
You're dead to everyone

You ask me, will I ever see my family again? (Never)
Your answer lies inside that box.
Get inside, close your eyes, kiss your life away... Goodbye
