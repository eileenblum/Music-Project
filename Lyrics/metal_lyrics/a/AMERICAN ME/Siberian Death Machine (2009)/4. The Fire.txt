[Music: Brian/Cam, Lyrics: Tony]

Come back to me. I was your everything... Everything plus more I could ever ask for.
No way out from this. I lied, I fucked up, I needed you from the deep inside.
I knew I needed you. Help me through this. I'm on my my knees dying to hold you.
Break me down. You're my weakness. Spare a chance, I'll tell you the truth...

Everyday is the same mistake. It won't be long before I'm gone.
I know you can't hold on and act like nothings wrong.

This story has been played so many times before...

You can't walk away from me, but you live in my dreams.
In this sad long story, ruined by the greed in me.
Real life face to face, I'm a jack of dirty queens.
Dead lock in life, hopeless and never to be seen.

YOU'RE THE FIRE THAT BURNS DEEP INSIDE OF ME

This cant be really fucking happening.
Into deep, Nothing worth salvaging.
