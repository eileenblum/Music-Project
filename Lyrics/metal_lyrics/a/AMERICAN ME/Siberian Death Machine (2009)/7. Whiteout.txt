[Music, Lyrics, Vocals: Brian]

So many times have I asked myself have before...
Time and time again I walk this path of indifference.
My mind is corrupt, I puke when I wake up.
I'll rest in piss one day from this life of sickness.

I'm lost right now, over-and-out.
I'm lost right now with a gun to the temple.

A real heartless mother-fucking son-of-a-bitch...
Born to kill and maim, apathetic, without a conscience...
With total disregard for human life.
I'll burn your house down with everyone of you in it
...cause I don't give a fuck.

I'm lost right now, over-and-out.
I'm lost right now with a gun to the temple... It's a whiteout

Life is a threat. Threat is in every turn.
Every turn you take you're gonna die from a freezer burn.
I'll take my cross-fired mind...
Too much emotion, when all I want to do is hate
