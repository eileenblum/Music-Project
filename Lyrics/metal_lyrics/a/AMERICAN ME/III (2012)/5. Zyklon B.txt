One life to live
This is a clean shot
Fortify my answer
This is how I really feel,
For myself no one else
To turn to

Undo my life reassess
My point of view
Bring me back
To something new
I will take my chances

This is not the way
We were meant to live
By the skin of our teeth
This shit will never end

Born and bred to obey
A half-life of constant
Stress and pain
A long, slow death in
A lifetime of suffering
