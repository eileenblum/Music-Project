Your in my control, forced and submitted.Had you from the back you lost my respect this will never be forgiven. Submissioner forced and submitted you never would of thought of this I'm coming from the front and if you practice way you preach you'll know that fire can't be beat in the end.Not in the end. Your past life never showed you about the hell that will control you just face the fact that strength is what you lack when your forced into submission.Forced into submission.
This is insanity a world of pain motherfucker I just might let you breathe again.You lay to waste in the wake of my path I watch your life slip away as you crumble to dust.
Submissioner forced and submitted
I just might let you breathe again.
