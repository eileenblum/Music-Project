I came I saw I conquered
All my life I been stepped on and ruined
Warpath pave my way engage the enslavement,
reckoning set this place fucking ablaze, 
Hostility from the depths of aversion falling on the sword,
Warpath pave my way engage the enslavement.
Dance with me dance with the devil motherfucking soul taker street justice.
I cannot die because I live inside you this is something you can't deny.
Welcome to street justice.
