Why don't you point the finger at yourself for awhile.Substance you need is nothing to me.This song is not what you think it may be.
This is world we work live and deal with just to get by.not 9 to 5.bars and bars strip clubs and drag queens to the suit and ties.
Everyday is something new to the begger, gold digger, drug dealer,and prostitute this is the night life.
Scumbag,millionaire,righteous man,con man this is the night life
Pour yourself another drink you might need it reality set in when is of an essence. No one to blame when time turns back, life turns black this is the night life.
