For the shit you love
For the shit you hate
Will you do what it takes
Inseparable times,Indescribable lies
I fucking hate myself, I know I died a little inside.
But it wasn't all me it took two to fight the burning pain that we suffered inside.
We can now learn from our past mistakes and forget the times that we have made. Inseparable times,indescribable lies.
