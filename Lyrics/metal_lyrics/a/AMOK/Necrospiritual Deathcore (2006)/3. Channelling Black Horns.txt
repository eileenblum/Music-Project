Channelling black horns
Channelling black horns
Electrify the medium
Channelling black horns

Standing knee deep in blood
Electric wires whip the walls
Skull of goat in hand
Needles pierce the veins and break
Abstinence -- human flesh
Cannibalism as satanic praise

Channelling black horns
Channelling black horns
Electrify the medium
Channelling black horns

Standing knee deep in blood
Electric wires whip the walls
Skull of goat in hand
Channelling black horns

Electrify the medium

Spikes pierce both skin and flesh
Channelling -- divine death
Crucifixion as satanic praise
Blood congeals, graves calling
Folded hands nailed to the walls
Electric wires, pain makes one higher

Channelling black horns
