Abrupt chronological shift
In technology combined with
A tenuous but carefully
Balanced subsistence lifestyle.
Loss of confusion of identity,
Lack of purpose
And awareness of redundancy.
Significantly eroding
The personal desire to continue living.
Collective awareness of unsustainability.
Extreme despair and imminent endangerment
Facing eradication either
Of the physical life or the way of life.
Ghastly, high-powered,
Amoral pressure closing in from the outside.
Whatever you face,
Whatever you perceive what you are facing,
Whatever threats have been made;
Whatever threats you believe
Will be carried out... pre-empt fate's hand.
