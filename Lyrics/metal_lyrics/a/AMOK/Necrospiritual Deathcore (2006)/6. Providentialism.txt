We must never weaken in performing God's work

Black oceans fill the land
No hope, just faith
And holy water pours from the sky
No hope, just faith

We must never weaken in performing God's work

A halo calms us with blinding fear
No hope, just faith
Crucifix sensation, salvation through damnation
No hope, just faith

Chosen by God

Black oceans fill the land
No hope, just faith
And holy water pours from the sky
No hope, just faith

Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord
Hallelujah
Kill yourself

A halo calms us with blinding fear
No hope, just faith
Crucifix sensation, salvation through damnation
No hope, just faith

God's chosen
Must never weaken
Kill for God
Kill yourself

Mountains of horns
River of venom
Pavements of landmines
All in the shadow of the cross of Peter
We have arrived
We are home
