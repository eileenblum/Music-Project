Extinction sublime, controlling your mind
No thoughts to call our own, decisions pre-made
Call this a life, pathetic we will die
One race that we fear, or end is so near

Dictators will rise if we let them go,
We must stand and be counted
It is time to KILL THE GESTAPO!
Fight this is a war that we must take
It is time to stand and be counted, lay down or be extinct
Fear, to overcome, suppressed by your ways
Let us fight, it is a war, we must take or we will die

What can we say? When we are not heard
Awaiting our fate, humanity won't wait
The fight of our lives, this is not a game
We must stand as one, conquer the Aryan race

Bombing and gassing their way to power
Brainwashing, suppressing their nation
The master race we know, they will never be
Unity they lack, and that is where we will strive
We now know, it is time to stand up now, and fight them take them from our lives
We must stand up it is time to fight this war
And take it back we have to fight the Nazi oppression kill them or we will all die!
