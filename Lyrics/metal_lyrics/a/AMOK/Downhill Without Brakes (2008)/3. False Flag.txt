The earth was rumbling, America was crumbling
When the money changed hands from the left to the right
People for the people? Does not mean we are equal
When they pull the pin you had better get out of sight

Fuck that government, do not believe their lies
All their secret documents and all their secret spies
Protestant, Catholic, Atheist or Jew
Do not care about religion because they will do the same to you
False flag operations, no questions asked due to reparations
False flag operations, northwood to the fucking Reichstag
False flag operations, no questions asked due to reparations
False flag operations now, we are under attack!

The bombs were dropped, and your politics flopped
Did you care about the ones that you sent into the war?
No excuses, what a bunch of pussies
I do not give a fuck I do not want to listen!

Take away your freedom, that is what they will do
Do not care about me and do not care about you
People for the people, does not mean were equal
They have already pulled the pin and now they are out of sight
