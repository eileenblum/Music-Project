The time comes, in every day to try and waste, the time away
To numb the pain, of all mundane office hours are all the same
After two, it's me and you after four, the world's with you
Nothing left for us to do, so what the hell we going to do?!
TOO TIRED! NO MORE! Can't take this
TOO TIRED! NO MORE! Can't take this

Escape to nothing, isn't much at all
Escape to something, you are surely going to are you sure you want to
Spiral to the bottom of the ladder to the gutter and go!
Of all things to do to make it better I just drink some more!
I don't care this is what I got nothing more, nothing worth a shot
You don't care, why should I I'd rather drink until I die
This is wrong, will never be right I'll be a man, stand up a fight
Pull myself back in line stop being blind to all the signs
DOWNHILL WITHOUT BRAKES!
Soul is dying body is crying
This is it no more it is over
DOWNHILL WITHOUT BRAKES!

I wake up dead, I'm full of dread I wonder what, I might have said
Or who I hit, in a fit or who I landed in the shit
I need some money, to buy my way out
Because there's never happy endings for a down and out
So I get drunk and wake up at ten
I'm sick five times, saying never again!
TOO TIRED! NO MORE! Can't take this
TOO TIRED! NO MORE! Can't take this

I need to feel something, TO FEEL REAL
You don't even know me, DON'T JUDGE ME
I can't turn back time, IT'S TOO LATE
I'm already done for, LIFE OVER
Pissing myself soaking, I FEEL GRIM
Walking, roaming, sleeping, IN THE STREETS
Bodies on the way out, DYING INSIDE
Shaking, spewing, bleeding, IT'S NOT GOOD!
