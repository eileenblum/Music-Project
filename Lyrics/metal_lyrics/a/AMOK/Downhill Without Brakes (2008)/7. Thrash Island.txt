We know where we stand in the thrash hierarchy,
We are at the top with the rest playing catchy,
Hanneman and Holt are the leaders of the tribe,
Hetfield and Hammet they will be on the other side

So we come to a place because thrashers are our race!
Fed up with the rest as they couldn't take the pace!
Fed up with them poseurs and that filthy emo scum!
If you are with me then you know where to come!
Thrash Island! We are Thrash Island!
Thrash Island! We are Thrash Island!

Drink or you die! This is what our people do,
Ten pints for you or you will end up in my stew,
Poseurs on my menu

We gathered here today, cause we like to shred and slay,
To you bangers down the front,
Get to the island and we will thrash another day
