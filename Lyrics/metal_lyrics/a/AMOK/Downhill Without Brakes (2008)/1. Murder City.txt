A fistful of smack, and a few hits more
Rent is not paid I have been shown the door
Body knows just what I need drink drink drink until I bleed, 
See my prey and I hunt them down hit him hard, and he smacked the ground
I told him once told him twice I am the one that you want to fight.

Beware of the murder city beware
The injustice in the world, is so fucking wrong, 
The violence in the streets, that is still going strong, 
Gun violence grows, stabbings still remains, 
What did we ever gain?

There is a boy at the bar, looking down and out, 
He drinks himself into an early grave, 
His life who will save it? He lives waiting to die
Kicks off at three and the war begins, 
Who is going to die? It depends who wins, 

Ignorant masses united by hate, 
Preaching to, their god of hate, 
Kids on the street, ready to fight, 
Death rings out to the dark of night, 
Green and blue it is all we see which are you? It does not matter to me!
Descending back down the streets of rage!
Dying at an early age on the streets! Ready to fight!
What is wrong? I do not know what is right!
Ready to fight! No what is right ready to fight!
