The animals rule, the humans were fools
They could not survive, even with all their tools
The world is hurt, but it will come back
For it has survived an even worse attack
Gone never to return it is now someone else's turn
The arrogance that we once had
Destroyed and sent the world mad

Global hangover, on an epic scale
Burned out exhausted, our destiny to fail
We never listened, we never asked
All of the answers said, we had never last
The truth is, the world is better off
Reclaiming the balance, it temporarily lost
The natural cycle, ran its due course
And ended when it began to fail
We're suffering, a disease
A world left, on it's knees
But it will come back
The time is now, to act
Let's look at the facts
We won't last, that long
We're suffering from a global hangover

Here we go, said with distaste
Lecturing you with nothing that is new
These are the facts you know they are right
But it won't affect you so you will never fight
Gone never to return it is now someone else's turn
The arrogance that we once had
Destroyed and sent the world mad

Feeling helpless to change the time-scale I find it so strange
We destroy our bodies and the world as well turning its beauty into hell
No way back, no way back there is no time to set it things right,
It's gone, too late, our end we will duly wait
We hate our fate, yet it is all of our faults
No one, to save, us from what we've become
Our actions are sealing our fate there's no longer time to debate
Our people always just take destroying all that's in our wake
No way back, no way back there is no time to set it things right,
It's gone, too late, our end we'll duly wait
We hate our fate, yet it is all of our faults
No one, to save, us from what we've been reduced to
