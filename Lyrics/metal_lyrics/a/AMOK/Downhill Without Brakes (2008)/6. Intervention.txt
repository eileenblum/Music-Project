You're so good at being an ass, and playing silly games
Dressing like your girlfriend does, you think you are better than me
Well come over here my friend and say that too my face!
You're so good at being the fool, but you ain't fooling me
Hide behind that fake faÃ§ade, is what you wannabe?
Well come over here my friend and say that too my face!

It's just a matter of time, ain't too far down the line
Before I stick your head in your ass
It's just a matter of time, ain't too far down the line
Before I go and hold an intervention, a friendly intervention
To tell you no-one like you, go on get out my life!

You're so good at being a dick, you fucking make me sick
Splashing all your cash around, your daddy's little prick
Well come over here my friend and say that to my face!
You're so good at being around, when no one wants you there
Stupid to the fact that no one calls you friend
Well come over here my friend and say that to my face!
