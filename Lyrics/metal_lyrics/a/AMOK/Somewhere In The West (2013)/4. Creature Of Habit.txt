You mean nothing to me 
You mean nothing to all 
My ear can't hear what you say to me 
You stand, I fall - I feel strange 
Things don't seem right 
Reality, fading away 
I'm usually here - But not today 

Purple haze - Disassociate 
Gone for days - Fuck that - Who's to say? 

Creature of habit - Fuck right 
Day by day, it doesn't pay 
I'm just feeding the addict - Mind split 
Night by night I feed my appetite 
Self destruction now 
There is nothing, all is lost 
I'm a creature of habit 
Lost somewhere, in the west 
This shit make me stronger 

Things falling apart - Mind split in change 
Too much is never enough - My loss is my gain 
I feel sick - Things don't seem right 
Sanity slipping away - I can't refuse 
'Cause I'd hate to stay 

Bloodshot eyes, I cannot see - My blood, my enemy 
Outcast society - Victim of empathy 

Somewhere I hope to find 
A little strength and peace of mind 
Reality fades away from me 
Am I my only hope? 
Drifting father, splitting another 
Floating somewhere, across the nerve 
Endlessly in search to discover 
Trapped inside this shell

Make time to kill time - I'm doing well 
All's fine, As far as you can tell 
Transfixed. Addict - I need a hit 
To wash away this shit - I reap, 'cause I seek 
The benefits of this chemical lust - Unjust, blood thirst 
Quick to abuse your senseless trust - Hypnotic. 
Quixotic - Unstoppable force to unknown strength 
Unreal, I yield - My life a distant memory 

Hello, can you see me? 
Mirror images staring back at me 
Do you see what I see? 
A shattered life of broken memories 
Reach deep within me 
Come and fix my split reality 
Something is missing 
What it is, is still unknown to me 

Something is missing - Endless, always 
Drifting further round the bend 
Mind constantly on the mend 
No more the body can defend 
Repeat,  repeat, repeat again 
Fuck you all and nine to five 
Open your mind, step inside 
Buckle up and let me drive 
The only way to feel alive 

What it is - Is still unknown 
People, places - I've been shown 
Help me, help me - Help me please 
I'm losing grip on sanity - Walls around me closing in 
God forgive me I have sinned 
Help me, help me - Help me please 
Help me regain sanity
