Carelessness has destroyed you 
But you don't even know 
You anger me, pick at me 
Yet I don't do a thing 
I'd rather not see those things 
That you seem to enjoy 
You lost a lot of friends you had 
Now I'm no longer there 

My once good friend has no idea 
What he has done to me 
And what he's gonna do to you 
He'll play the fool for sympathy 
Then throw it in your face 
Hate him now, as he won't change 
No guilt his man will feel 

Why don't he just go away? 
Don't you have somewhere to be? 
Back among the dirt of society 
The place that he fits right inside 

Sometimes when I look at him 
it's me I see staring back at me 
And then I ask him - Why don't you do this to me? 
He stands staring - Blind to the world around him 
Hate and disappointment 

Cover your tracks, cover your tracks 
Always look behind your back 
Cover your tracks, cover your tracks 
'Cause I can take them away 

The deeds you've done, Caught up with you 
The lies you made, the things you said 
It's time to pay your dues 
Reflect upon your pointless life 
And want to make the change 
Do it now, to right you'll bow 
It's time that you save face 

Run away from the cold truth 
Wish you'd never seen the proof 
Don't look back or you will see 
What it is you don't want to 

Some things in life are better kept inside 
Someone high, reduced to some thing lower 

It seem to me you'll never change 
I stare at you and I can hide my inner rage 
I wish that you'd do real talk - And downright honesty 
A fake you are - you've done too far 
Get away from me
