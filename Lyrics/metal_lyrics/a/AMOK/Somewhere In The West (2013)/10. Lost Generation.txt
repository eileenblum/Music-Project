You get nothing in life for free - Not even your civil 
Liberty - Trapped inside you're looking out 
Sit and watch your life go by 
While friends all judge and say you don't try 

Try not to look at me - Why don't you just go away? 
Try not to feel disgust - Why don't you just give up? 

Feel the rage inside of you 
'Cause no-one ever listen to you - Call this life? 
More like death - The more they'll send 
So you stand, get in line - Now you see, 
your life is mine- Searching for a purpose 
When your purpose is to be no more 
This life, fading from a shadow - I am gone 

We are the generation - The one's you left behind 
We will not be forgotten - We're etched upon your mind 
Look to the skies, you see them turning grey 
This isn't over, we'll return another day 
No-one cares, but you feel ashamed 
Your head goes down, You feel not worthy
Further sinking, turning black - You're not part of humanity 

You're so far down you're almost dead 
Drink to numb the pain - Sickness 
You try to hate yourself - Punish, filthy, weak 
Rid yourself of dignity - Don't you see it's not your fault? 
Don't you see you're one of millions? 
Never be a victim to the failures of a generation 
This life yours, never be theirs 

End the struggle, release you strength - Fight the people 
who took you there, Torn between what is right and wrong 
It's never going to be fair - War of power we've got to win 
Or we face the blackness again - Endless struggle but
it must end - Let it know how much we care 

Lost somewhere in some town 
Born into his where and when - He feels cheated by face 
But where he is he has grown to love - Somewhere in the 
west - A man faces his own dark shadow 
What it is he does not know - But it draws him closer 
A horrible temptation - Somewhere in the west 
He steps towards the darkness 
All around him the light is fading 
Retreating from the violence and degradation 

Retreating also from the mans mind - Somewhere in the west - Darkness consumes his thoughts 
Drowning all hope and replacing it with unease 
What was he drawn to this place? - Somewhere in the west - Sixty-eight time he wanted to run 
Another body dumped next to the tracks 
Another demon who covered his tracks - Lost somewhere 
in some town - He leaves his where and when 
Somewhere in the west
