Citizens you sit and wait 
I'll terrify and devastate - You're all fools 
And I will use you for my own gain 
Tough shit, that's the way it is 
Always was and always will be 
Terrify - You will stay down there forever 

Out of the darkness violence creeps 
Stirring up inside - Memories repeat 
themselves - Welcome to the uprise

Something isn't right - What I see 
I don't believe in - Do as I say, not as I do 

Walking through the joyless city - I'm holding 
on to what I once had - Got nothing more 
Nothing more, that I believe in 
Everybody's turned to using 
Wishing that they bought some more 
Everybody's turned to nothing 
Sitting down they wait, for the uprise 

Citizen Look at the state of you - I'm not gonna lie 
They will use you, they will take you 
Do you think that they care for you? 
You're just an animal 
Their society don't want folk like you 

Smoke leads the way - Debt you must repay 
Lead a call to arms - Split the mirror strike 
Rage fuels this fight - The end is in sight 
This is devastation - Mass retardation 

Hey, I see your eyes on me 
I wonder what you see - I believe that you 
Do not, will not. cannot - Respond the truth 
You struggle and you fall - You cannot have it all 
I see that you - Deny, the lies that you believe 

Running further, try to escape 
Falling into, what you create 
Terminally, falling further 
Trying to feel, sense of sanity again 
Burning madness - Blinding fires 
Shocking movement - Taking its hold 
Feel the uprise, feel the reprise
