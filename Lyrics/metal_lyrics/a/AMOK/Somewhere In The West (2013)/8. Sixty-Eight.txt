Going down to the underground 
World spinning upside down 
Sick of all the city sounds 
Eyes of killers all around 
Reading in the papers of the sickness in the streets 
Feeling ill from vomit, hate and everyone I meet 

Why do you react? - When I look at you
Is your brain so small? - That you hate us all 

Oh this is good from you 
Sitting there with your point of view 
It's not my fault I am this way 
It's all that shot before this day 
You look at me like you know me 
You look through me, but you don't know me 
I've risked my life for you my friend 
And you really couldn't care 

I'm gonna tell you a story 
You'll sit there and hold my beer 
If you try and stop me 
I'll make you wish you'd never met me 
I'm gonna tell you a story 
You'll sit there and hold my beer 
Don't even try and stop me 
I'll make you wish you'd never met me 

When I was locked in jail my old man was sick 
And I hoped to get home but he died Alone 
Lay in my bed, memories tortured my head 
And I lost grip on reality 

So what point am I trying to make? 
Not quite sure, but it's mine to make 
Tired of haters all around 
Want to drag them underground 
Reporters on the TV, showing violence in the streets 
Fuelling further hatred for the people that I meet 

I tell you what my friend - My dignity is mine to defend 
I have a reason for being this way 
It's all that shit before this day 

I drink because I have to - It's not because I want to 
I live this way 'cause I need to 
I wouldn't want it any other way 
When I got back from war all my best friends were dead 
And the wife left me too and I knew I was through 
Left with no home, on the streets all alone 
I was falling into obscurity 

No war ever made any sense 
A plague that takes every cent 
We make laws on ways to kill 
Our condition will never relent 
You see everyone that you love 
They walk evento though you won't let them go 
Not only do they not understand 
They wouldn't go if they had the chance 
Destroy you will. Destroy 
They can't see you but they drag you down 
They come crawling but they take you out 
Take your chances then just walk away 
You walk alone it isn't what they say 
No country wants you; they just look the other way 
Come on down, and take a look and see 
I want you to see what you could be 
Lying beneath you're surrounded in shame 
None of them will understand 
You got out, you come back 
You're always judged, under attack 
You think you're safe, until you're home 
Where you're ripped into by them all 

The time has come for you to go 
But let me tell you before you're home 
Makes no sense, don't get involved 
Futile we murder and kill - No more Sixty-Eight
