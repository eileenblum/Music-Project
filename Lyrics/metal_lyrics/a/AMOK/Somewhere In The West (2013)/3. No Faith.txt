On his knees every single day 
Desperation, he begins to pray 
 A life once lost all he seems to be 
Hoping religion will set him free 
A broken life, a tortured head 
A blackened soul that's completely dead 
Choices made, result clear to see 
Another waste of humanity 

Looking up to the darkness skies 
The broken man starts to cry 
Ties the noose around his neck 
Preparation for his doom 
He's looking for some faith 
Something to confide in 
He's searching for this path - But he can't find it 

His last wish was that new found faith 
Would take him from torment to another place 
A reality that he would never see 
Suicide for set him free 
A broken life, a tortured head 
A blackened soul that's completely dead 
One cannot judge another's destiny 
This man will never, ever be free 

Cutting him down from the swinging rope 
His family's eyes they cry again
Thoughts of his depression 
Haunting, they are consumed
