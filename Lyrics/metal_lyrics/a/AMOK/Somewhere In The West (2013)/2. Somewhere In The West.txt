Gun in hand, death on demand 
I'm a villain on the loose 
Killing just a way to make a loving 
This is my way 
How much do you think I'm worth? 
When a bounty rests on my neck 
For crimes against the murder city 
I stand by me, no-one else 

Welcome to my situation 
Something serious is going down 
One man, two guns and a lonely street 
No law, no rules, I can take a heat 
The sweat drips down and my fingers shakes 
Ease on the trigger 
Then walk away from this town 

Do you see me? I can see you 
payment means I have to kill you 
I'm good yet bad, but keep my honour 
You say I'm wrong but I must kill 
Shoot my gun, you're gone forever 
Couldn't care less, see you in hell 

From shadows I steal the night 
Sleep under sunrise 
Moving in, creeping closer still 
Must keep out of sight 
Through desolate wasteland 
The place I call home 
I'm wanted dead or alive 
I am the outlaw - kill them all 

Humans come and humans go 
I decide which way they go 
I intend to be the one to take 
them on at their own game 
When you have bounty on your head 
You cannot tell whose friend or foe 
Keep on turning, time to go 

Terrify across the nation 
One man trail of devastation 
To the case for my gun. but the gun ain't there 
What can do? Cut and run? - Throw a knife through the air 
Target moves quick, got to make the choice 
End it now; he can't walk away from this town 

OUTLAW! NO MORE TIME! 
Here we are in a desolate town 
All alone, out of law - it's between you and I 
The winds blows a chill down the spine of the guilty 
Who is guilty? - The man on the run or the man on the hunt? 

No sooner that I got here it all ends 
He hits the ground, I shot him dead 
The shock it worries his top men 
trying to chase me out of town 
Never trust the well dressed man 

Now guns are blazing in the street
I cannot breathe with all this heat 
Their two best buddies down 
Time to test this ducking town I say 
I am the army who's on call 
Dropping the tyrants who stand tall 
I make them suffer. Pay - Time to take the power back 

In the end they fall - running cowards yell
No more running - But I'll always know who the fuck I am 
I am the outlaw, look into my eyes 
I am the outlaw, there's death upon my mind
