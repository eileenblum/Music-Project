Planet of the I'll conceived - language of the dumb 
Country socially diseased - Humanity the numb

You stand in line and hope we'll follow 
But we never give in 
We wanna live in a better tomorrow 
And we never give in - This is wrong, never right 
Living dead, stand and fight 

Time to use time, not to kill time 
Time to make those hours count 
Time to face the world again 
Time to make it ours again 

Terminally doomed to fail - United treachery 
Turning on the small and weak - it's high hypocrisy 

You stand in line and hope we'll follow 
But we never give in 
We wanna change for a better tomorrow 
And we never give in 
This is wrong, never right 
Living dead, stand and fight 
Stand and fight - Make this your time 

Kill it before it gets to late - End it 

Telling you I'm all out of energy 
And I am going nowhere 
Telling you I'm all out of energy 
And I am going nowhere 
When the gap grows ever wider 
When the rich start war on the poor 
Scapegoat for all your Crimes 
You used to fear, not anymore 
When you bellies full your eyes are blind 
When you have it all - You leave humanity behind 
Make time to kill time - Never let them win 

Make time to kill time - Make time to kill time 

Time has taken a toll on you 
Nobody can save you now 
It's a death grip - Time to feel alive again 
Mortality take you down - Ticking time bomb 
No-one really care for you - A walking dollar sing 
Good for nothing - Poisoning you inner self 
It corroded you away - Never to return
