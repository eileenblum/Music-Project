Lawbreaker - Causing ultimate destruction 
Killing in the name of nothing in particular 
Crimes is his life - All that is, all that ever was 
Taking care of his own - He's the underbelly 

Take him down, take him out - Take his rights away 
Lock him up, break him down - Take his life away 
Let him suffer 'til his dying day 
Take a step through the door - its a step away 
Break and enter - I'll defend my own 
Give me a reason to reply - Defend my home 
Give me a reason to defy - This impulse to kill 

The doors unlocked - Come inside 
Steal from me - You'll surely die 
The desperation makes me sick 
Stealing from me to get his sick 
On the street corner - Selling your life away 
Ten years for a buck - Was it worth it? 
And you fear nothing 'cause nothing matters to you 
Piss your life against the wall 
Sitting at home with the wife and baby 
When the window crashes in - And this desperate man 
Who wants to take my livelihood - And everything else 
But I warned him once - It's wasting time 

But this country has to be literal - Give them everything 
Rent paid for the underbelly 
The law should stand firm against the perpetrator 
Crimes is his law, but it's me who's in jail 
If there's a law, I'll break it - If there's a life, I'll take it 
I am the lawbreaker - Defend 
I am the lawbreaker - My rights, my home 
If there's a law, I'll break it - if there's a life, I'll take it 
I am the lawbreaker - I am lawbreaker 

So you entered my life - And I took yours away 
Now it's me on the run - I'll never be free 
A life or retreat each day I live 
End of the line, got nothing to give 
What's old to you is new to me 
A criminal by default all I'll ever be
I took the law in my hands for what I believe 
But you entered my house - And you planted the seed
