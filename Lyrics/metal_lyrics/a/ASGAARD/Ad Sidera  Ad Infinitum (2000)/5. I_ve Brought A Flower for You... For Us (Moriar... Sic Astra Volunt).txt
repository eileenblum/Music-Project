The memory bore a tear; the stars have faded, the dreams got quiet...
only the faith in eternity full of passion,
unmufled flickered a little with a pale,
shivering flame...
A small part of You I passes in me,
a bit of Your dreams, which You didn't happen to tell me about,
a bit of a felling that this damn time has taken away from Us...
Remember me...
Remember painlessly
full of ecstasy and sweetness of those moments,
culmination of time which has passed...
We are so far away from each other,
parted by the void between two worlds, chated by time...
I depart...
I will lie beside You...
