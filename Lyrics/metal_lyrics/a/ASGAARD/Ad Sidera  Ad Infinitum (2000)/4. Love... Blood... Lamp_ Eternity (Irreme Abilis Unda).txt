Every single moment I dream about our extasy...
In the time... and out of time...
In the time... and out of time...
Love... Blood... &amp; Eternity
Passion... some secret force
a scream or horror like a wild flower in a hoodwinked Devil's hand...
The breath of wind chasing o being of original love, of original faith in the immortality of human soul and its infiteness.
Passion... the last proof of the truth in the hand of an imprisoned man.
Just only a while... the last breath...
I've heard!
The heavenly moan groans with the echo of delighted hearts, the nocturnal suffering tornished with disappointed madman's blood
Then there was only silence...
...and sadness of the stony faith pierced with the TREASON dagger
and only the time did stop for a while, a little stupefied and dumbly ravished blew another candle...
