Each night
When the moon is his full
I set free from my body
Which is nearly sleeping then

With womanly incantation I call
The Blue Unicorn
Who Will carry me
To you

I am penetrating through the window â pane...
I am penetrating through the white bedding...
I am Sailing round your body
I am calling and You
Liberate from it

Permeated by ourselves we walk
By the sleeping world

When the compulsory sun-rise comes
We magically get back to our bodies
And wake up kindly
Not to irritate the world

That morning long time we nestle our
Eyelashes to the pillons
