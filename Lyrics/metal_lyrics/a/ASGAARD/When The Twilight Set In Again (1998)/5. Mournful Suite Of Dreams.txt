Lord of the far horizons
Give the eyes to sea
Over the verge of the sundawn
The beauty that's to be

All sunset at the seaside coast
I have seen his majesty
Standing in mysterious circle
In glove of many candles

When the temple was burn
Our souls asked for peace
And he coming on the white horse
Forgotten Slavonic God Lord...
