Nameless land of streams strike me with
The glance of heart
It must exist on the edge of our memories

Misguided in our fives we approach the
Valley of shadows not looking behind
The passing clouds refler what I'm feeling

There's a flowing stream in my heart
It's stream of my conscience
I'm lost in my life.
I'm lost in the land of streams
A transparent spirit moved in the forset
Of my unlimited feelings

Severing like an advent flame
Like a drop of water
I'm flowing down the eyes of my soul

The world of colours foresight and
Anxiety is sinking
Time of belief and hope is ending
Only love is joined like two streams

And we are looking on your direction
And we don't see anything
Our heart trembles and the prayer
Cries For full happines

Time of belief and hope is ending
Only love is joining like two streams
Which establish the river
