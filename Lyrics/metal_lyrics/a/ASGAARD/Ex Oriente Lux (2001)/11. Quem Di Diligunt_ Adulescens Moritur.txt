Perhaps, you will find me there
I will stand alone waiting for the shine
Of my star in the planetarium of the
Eternal dreams you will approach me
And silently you will present me with yourself...
In the mirror of your soul, there is heart of
A woman without name

And finally time had come
To fulfil the curse with wind
My body fell down unconsciously
Into the abyss of love madness

Suddenly, world stopped
Staggered by the majesty of a moment
Which were dying in slow agony
Like a haggard flame
Fighting for its life with an arm
Of vanishing faith
