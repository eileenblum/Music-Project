Here the sky is shedding mournful tears
Bedewing the blades of remembrance
With the scarlet of my crime
You still wait by the window
Looking out for flame...
I want to kiss the silver
Moon sprinkled you with

These are my dreams constellations
Enveloped in a veil of Darkness!
I sail on wings of imagination
Towards the New Spaces
I am so close...
How sweet fragrance has Those Flowers
What a wonderful colours have their crowns
That night I saw the New Shines
I would like to give you
One of them, so much...

...Feel the stridently cold breath of surrounding Darkness
Shining star of a dying mankind fall asleep in its embrace
Fear...
