Silence...I rub my eyes and scream
To kill the fear
Somewhere in the distance here the moan of bells
Angel song of love
Sounds the echo of thousand hearts
Loneliness...
Mad dreams about the shine
Revive in her embrace
Like insane wanderers
We create the landscapes of our bliss
Bathed in the ocean of sin
Damned forever
We die...
