Take a deep breath
The sun is going down
You will see the stars in a while
You will hear how they are telling nightmares
Are you scared? Come on...

It is just an illusion
You have never existed, indeed
As well as words that we are using to describe feelings

Open Your eyes
Everything has changed
Even the colours of sun, stars, nightmares and feelings
Indefinable forms of an existence
Became destructive flames of the Death

Theatre of shadows which are growing bigger and bigger
You are dancing with them transforming dimensions
Closed in a broken mirror

But You have opened the gates...
Somebody is watching You now
