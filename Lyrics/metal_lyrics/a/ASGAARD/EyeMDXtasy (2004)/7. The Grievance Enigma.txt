Flowers withering away as the time passes by;
It is just the time advancing on everyone of us
These minor beings, rotting...
Sweet warm feeling just as You feel

The light of day; a day? Where?
In this profound abyss of my intimate I could not fulfill
The pain I feel is growing like a black cancer inside my soul

There is no escape! The roads are closed...
Once beautiful and fair, surrounded by infinite gardens of hope

But killed by the wrath of Gods
Now left behind, the most disgraceful
A worm crawling for one last chance
In this no man's land

Tired I started to give up
No more emotions, nothing inside
Why this pain will not go away?
Why so much pressure is imposed on me?
I can not bear this anymore;
Please leave... go far... I just want...
No...

The tears from my eyes and red blood filled with poison
The hate inside is no longer powerful
Energy of my inner self is fading fast
I desire for the last breath
Which will save me forever
