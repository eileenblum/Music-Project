Somebody will cry
Somebody will hate
Somebody will love
Somebody will curse his lot
Demigods will raise to cut off the Hydra's head
But they will die by the sword, sword of their friends
Burning sails on the horizons of the seas,
Unceasing gale from the land
Herald of Era not able to become;
Billions of people on the shore like a wall
Blow into water
Sadness and bitterness, hope fell,
The dreams of Brilliance trammeled in chains
Devilish giggle's echo rocks the clouds,
Wakes up the thunders in heavens

Faith, destruction, dream and storm,
Bestial slaughters, admiration and oblivion,
Ghastly crowds, old man at the cross-roads,
Bleeding doll frightens ravens away
Gazing at her eyes greedily
Gardens in bloom, magic of the stars
They are coming...

Rainbow bridge erecting over the world
In golden carriage â The Pictures of Angels...
Thousands of mirrors broken into atoms
Thousands of children with bleeding hands
It's mosaic of capricious Fortune caressing
The birds nesting in the eye-sockets
Beseeching moan â Wake up her!
Give her a new life!!! To let her suffer again...
Bleeding doll with a new eyes

Fire and water, air and earth, human,
Gods, love and treason, war, hate, tears, sin... and revenge
Beauty with ugliness like handful of ashes
Need only to blow, to sow the seeds again...
