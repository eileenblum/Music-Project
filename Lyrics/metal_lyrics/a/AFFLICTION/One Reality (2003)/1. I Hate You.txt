I hate you What you've got
How I wish that all of them will turn to dust

You don't deserve anything you don't even deserve to be alive

I hate you What you've got
How I wish that all of them will turn to dust

I couldn't hold my vomit when I look in to your face

I hate you What you've got
How I wish that all of them will turn to dust

I'm disgusted with everything what you appreciate

Die, Die, Die, Die
