Give me the key, the secret that opens the gates
Of heaven
There's a leopard, a lion and a she-wolf before the gates
Either open the gates and show me the way
Then let me in
Cause I have sinned
Please let me in ...

The time runs against me
The end is getting nearer
I'm stuck, imprisoned. I'm petrified in this darkest hour
If I kill myself it would be my salvation
Torture my eyes the crimson skies
Guilt is flowing my veins

I'll walk in your dreams
When you set me free
I'll whisper in your ears
Please please forgive me

Give me the clue, the word that opens the heart
Of this sinner
There's a leopard, a lion and a she-wolf before the gates
Either open the gates and show me the way
Then let me in ...
