We are waiting for the end of the line
We know that nothing will be the same again
And we live with smiles on our faces in a fake happiness
While the sun of darkness shining above us

Temple of tranquillity behind the mountain

Which we are never able to climb
We try to reach again and again and again
But our hopes always turn to dust
