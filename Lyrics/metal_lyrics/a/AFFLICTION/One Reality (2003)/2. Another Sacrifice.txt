In the middle of darkness
Can you give me a reason
To struggle one more day
Stop lying to me, no matter how far it is
There is only one reality
I'm at my end

Tried to terrorize
And didn't realize
But now it's too late
I'm another sacrifice

Wipe your mendacious tears
You don't have to act
I don't believe in anything
Hope is almost gone
Unavoidable bitter truth is coming fast
I hate what I felt there is no escape

Tried to terrorize
And didn't realize
But now it's too late
I'm another sacrifice

There's no future no hope no salvation
My end is getting nearer
I lost my faith so many years ago
I don't believe in anything no more
