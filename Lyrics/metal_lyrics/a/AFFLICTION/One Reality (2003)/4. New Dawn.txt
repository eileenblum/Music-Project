The world is in my hand. My time is soon
Whatever makes me insane wait the coming is my noon

I can see the faces which were laughing at me
To them I will show no mercy just as they had to me
Sleepless nights meaningless thoughts they will be my guide
I will unchain feelings that are wild

Rain of my hate, seeds of my rage, plaints will be grown
I feed my anger through their core

With the new dawn justice is gone
Don't pray no more he can't rescue you
