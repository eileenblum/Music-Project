A new birth has come to the earth
His destiny chosen from the start
Cursed by the cursed never to be undone
He brought the twilight I saw the earth getting darker

Can't you see the world is dying
Don't you understand why we are crying
Living under the dark sun, strolling among
us the chosen one

Open your eyes you have to realize
That people will die with the dusk
And the earth won't see the dawn again
Mother nature will turn to dust

Damnation of the new birth will reign over our fate
Our blood will turn into a crimson lake
Slaughter and death will enhance the power of the chosen one
Than he will form his dark kingdom
