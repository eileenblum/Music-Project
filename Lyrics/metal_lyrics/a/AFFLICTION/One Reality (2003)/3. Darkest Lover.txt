My lips like a venom make you suffer when we kiss
Then makes you happy you feel pleasure
As you wanna be

Heals the sore you wanna leave behind
But you have to resist the pain that I give

Don't you want it to give the pain
If you desire me so hard
You have to endure this cause you'll obtain what you wish
As for me, I will give what I want

Just wish for me that's enough
I'm here where you want me to be
Surrender yourself to me
You'll be seeing my mystery

Don't you want it to give the pain
If you desire me so hard
You have to endure this cause you'll obtain what you wish
As for me, I will give what I want
