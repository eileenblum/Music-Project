Runaway from their gaze you are afraid
You are afraid of what lies beneath
You are not able to ask them you can not interrogate
Suspicion and distrust make you insane

They cause you feel the pain the thoughts make you sad
You can't talk so you hate the people nourish a hatred to them

Maybe pain would not make you feel better
Or maybe you have to face yourself
Facing the truth facing yourself are your biggest fears

Don't runaway don't hideaway
These will not help to you
Your silence, hatred and fear will become your misery
