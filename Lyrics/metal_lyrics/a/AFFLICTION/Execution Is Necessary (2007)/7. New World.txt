The gate of hell is opening
With every single sin that's committed
The Road to perdition is getting longer
With exclamations from the shelters

I feel tired
I See hopes are nearly lost
I'm about to be exhausted

Everlasting greed and cupidity
Inhumanity reign in the cities
Innocent lives are taken by dirty hands
Crimson rivers are flowing on the streets

Babies are born marked by the guilty past
Open their eyes in irresistible agony
Crying out what is our sin?

The brand new world is rising
There is no dream and no feelings

Serenity has almost died out

Eras of breed of loathing
