How many dreams you've shattered
How many lives you've ruined
Now it's time for vengeance
You will drown in your sin

Echoes from the past
Chasing you through the nightmares
You are the demise of your own
Prayers are useless

Your soul shall find itself alone and desperate
Prepare yourself to that cruel solitude
Which is not as loneliness, ca use their red orbs
Will burn and scorch your soul forever

Would that god I could awaken
For I dream I know not how
And my soul is sorely shaken
Lest en evil step be taken

Would that god I could awaken
For nightmares I've been crawling
And my soul is sorely shaken
It's been a long time, I've been forsaken
