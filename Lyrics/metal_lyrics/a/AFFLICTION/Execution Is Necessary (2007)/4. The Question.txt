I'm acting like everything is alright
But deep inside, storms are breaking

In my mind, always the same question
But still I have no answer
Time of elegies for me are coming
Every passing day is getting worse

Dawn to dusk, dusk to dawn years were passed by
The time has come, time for my mourning
Wasted my life, while I've been searching
But still there is no answer

Misery is growing, it will be my hearse
But still I have no answer

Tell me who am I?
Tell me who I used to be?
What is the purpose of my own existence?

Tell me who am I?
Tell me who I used to be?
In the end, I'm the end my persistence is useless
