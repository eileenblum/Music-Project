You will stuck
And suffocate in the cruelty you've made
Offspring's blood spilled
Orders of greed are fulfilled

Mourning grief and sadness turn into
Wrath and madness
God bless you. Cause no one will

Black tears of the souls
As the oil for the hole
Will become the furnace of your sin

You shall alone
Against the whole world which you've left in the mess
Can you hear the sound?
It's the sound of the anger you surrounded

Tyrant of the jaded earth
Lust for blood, quench your thirst
Never-ending hypocrisy
Are the lands now free?

World Wide Wrath
Is growing with the every chaos you've just sown
The path you've followed
Will lead you to the end, your grave now.
