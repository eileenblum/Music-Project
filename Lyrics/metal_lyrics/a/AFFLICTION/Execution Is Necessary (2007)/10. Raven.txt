I wish my footsteps would suddenly fall silent
My shadow will lead me to another street
May I forget everything all about me
And wandering to uncertainty

There is a certain way which could set me free
But I'm a coward, I have no courage

Another painful reminisce
Every privilege has a consequence
As my soul is intoxicated
Drifting dragging to the unknown

How I wish that I could be a child again
The time of innocence, no sorrow no pain
How I wish to break the hourglass
Stop the world and freeze the space

My past as a raven, flying over my head
Dark alloy is on its wing and on its tail
An essence fall as it fluttered
Powerful to destroy, annihilate my soul
