I hate the world but you defend them and be aegis for all
I shut the door but you make hole on the their wall
All I want to do is make you to see what they are trying to be
The awful truth behind what you call it reality

You hate the world and I will, I will kill them all
You shut the door and I w ill burn down the hall
All I want to do is make you to see what they are trying to be
The awful truth behind what you call it reality

I'd serve the order of grace
I'd serve the chaos of their flames
They both the same, no differences at all
And there's no promised land, no promised land to go

No turning back without an explanation
Stop violating creation
Who keep the will to kill inside
Who's left the tragedy behind
