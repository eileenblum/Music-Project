The words are losing their meanings
Statements are changed, fixed or denied
They are covered up and disguised
With or without awareness

Fools, pursuing uncertainty
They don' t know the reason why
Nothing satisfying anymore
Like it used to be

The reality is scary
Delusion is playing the role of truth
No one is brave any more
No one knows which one is pure

We are on a road
Which is enlightened by the dark
We are numb we are deaf we are blind
Everything is as we want, HOLLOW
