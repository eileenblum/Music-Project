Why hold their ears
Why make them deaf
If there is something that they wouldn't hear
Or (they've) heard already

Why blacken their eyes Why make them blind
If there is something that they wouldn't see
Or seen already

Veins of existence are getting choked
Strings of time start to tear apart

Stars are getting disappear
The moon is beginning to fade
A black curtain has been drawn
The story is over

Why all these punishment
Why make them suffer
If they deserve all that
What would be their sin so great

Mankind will be sentenced dreadfully
It's the beginning of a miserable journey

Stars are getting disappear
The moon is beginning to fade
A black curtain has been drawn
The story is over
