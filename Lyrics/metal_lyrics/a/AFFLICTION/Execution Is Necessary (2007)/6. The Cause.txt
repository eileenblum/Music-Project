In the far city of madness
Desperately seeking for quite and calm safe house Nothing but dire ruins
Am I lost in the darkened fallen city's veins?

I thought I was an armored saint
I thought I could help them all
The gate to bliss sealed by demons
The seal from memories I recall

The causeless blood on my hands
Nameless feeling burns my soul, cursed and damned heart
Is a mirror what it shows,
Is a misery or I am the cause in the city's veins

Brings all memories back
Which I've just left behind
Grinning demons on every corner
Looking through me to see my past
