I'm going to deeper end, deeper of hell
No fear, going to face my sweet darkness
There'll be no regret when I kill him
He'll feel the pain of many years

He had always made me fall down
From the highs of the mountain I've climbed
My every trial of resisting his fires
Was resulted with burns on my

Now days of enlightenment are coming
I'm not going to feel this pain anymore
This bittersweet darkness is about to collapse
I'll gain my self esteem and destroy

My sweet darkness, go back to hell
I don't want to feel your pain anymore

I'll bury you deep with a plastic bag
This will your final judgment, your end.

My sweet darkness, the nausea, the sickness
Will ceased with the fever that maddened my brain
This torture, the worst, will be abated
I won't let you flow any more in my

I'm going to deeper end, deeper of hell
No fear, going to face my sweet darkness
I'm not going to feel this pain anymore
I'll gain my self esteem and destroy
