[Lyric: Carmine Filizzola, music: Alessandro Chiappetta &amp; Carmine Filizzola]

For too long through my eyes
I could not see reality.
I could see everyone and everything
That was around me.

But with my own eyes
I could not see myself.
Only now I realize
They have always lied to me.

Black veil of ignorance
Surrounds us unconsciously.
Doomed from the cradle
Wandering like blind.

Infinite rays of Light
Coming through my retina
Illuminating the perception
Of unknown Worlds.

Too much blind to can see (Too much blind to can see)
There's no more time to play with dreams,
But now I'm awake and I know (I'm awake and I know).
I no longer need eyes to can see.

Now the Sun has risen
And everything is clearer.

The dreadful fears fade away
Showing me the true horizons.

Black veil of ignorance
Surrounds us unconsciously.
Doomed from the cradle
Wandering like blind.

Past and future
Were just fragile illusions.
Like a glass they are breaking while
I calm my thirst in the spring of Now.

Too much blind to can see (Too much blind to can see)
There's no more time to play with dreams,
But now I'm awake and I know (I'm awake and I know).
I no longer need eyes to can see.

Too much blind to can see
Too much blind to can see
Too much blind to can see (Too much blind to can see)
Too much blind to can see (I'm awake and I know)
Too much blind to can see (Too much blind to can see)
Too much blind to can see (I'm awake and I know)
