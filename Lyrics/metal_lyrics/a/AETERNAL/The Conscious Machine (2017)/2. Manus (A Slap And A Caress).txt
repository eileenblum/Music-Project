[Lyric: Carmine Filizzola &amp; Alessandro Chiappetta, music: Alessandro Chiappetta &amp; Carmine Filizzola]

My hands are the prime tool
That allows me to interact in the system.

As if they were the mirror of my soul
I realize my integrity watching them.

I can't know when fate will break my lonely way
But I'll have less fear if we walk holding our hands.
I will take you to a safe place
And I'll show you the distance that exists,
Since the dawn of the humanity,
Between the intentions and the actions.

With a slap and a caress
To help myself and the other minds.
I'll close my fists to defend myself from the ruthless rage of my enemies.
I'll caress your cheeks to wipe away the tears that slip down from your
Eyes.
My hands to change my destiny, many joined hands to change the world.

Through prehensile upper limbs
We've imposed our greedy species.

Our acts are conditioned
By animal compulsions.

I can't know if my actions will be understood,
But I am sure with my hands I can kill or heal.
We'll be together in the same place
Understanding the distance that exists,
From here to Eternity,
Between the intentions and the actions.

With a slap and a caress
To help myself and the other minds.
I'll close my fists to defend myself from the ruthless rage of my enemies.
I'll caress your cheeks to wipe away the tears that slip down from your eyes.
My hands to change my destiny, many joined hands to change the world.
