[Lyric: Carmine Filizzola &amp; Alessandro Chiappetta, music: Alessandro Chiappetta &amp; Carmine Filizzola]

In a sordid world emotional dependence
It's a way to make it seem innocent.
I shaped my life in search of deep emotions.
My body is dragged by strongest attractions.

How can you understand the importance of an impression
If you don't know where it's generated?
Sometimes you can't appraise your experiences.
The heart can't be broken in a thousands pieces.

Until you feel the anger in your veins
Or the happiness is gone away,
Until the shivers of fear run down your spine
Or the remorse wakes you up at night,
Until the shame makes your face blush
Or you never want the joy to end
You'll remain a slave of these chains.

The heart is not the source of the feelings.
This seems eternal illusion to me.
I hoped to find in others the warmth I was looking for,
But I have found it in the depth of myself.

How can you appraise the essence of a feeling
Only by the pleasure that it can give to you?
When you loose everything and everyone is gone away
You will realize that the bitterness still remains.

Until you feel the anger in your veins
Or the happiness is gone away,
Until the shivers of fear run down your spine
Or the remorse wakes you up at night,
Until the shame makes your face blush
Or you never want the joy to end
You'll remain a slave of these chains.

Don't ask me, don't ask me why
These illusions seem so real.
Perhaps randomness, perhaps fate
But it means that you're still alive.
