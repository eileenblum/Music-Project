[Lyric: Carmine Filizzola &amp; Alessandro Chiappetta, music: Alessandro Chiappetta &amp; Carmine Filizzola]

I shape the air and through vibrations
I form my voice and so the words.

Sometimes they are inopportune
To explain my mood to you.

Thousands of people have died for modified words
Of which they never caught their value.
I thought I knew the true weight of these sounds.
Deep in the silence I realized their danger.

I will support you or I'll let you fall down.
I will destroy you or I will extol you.
You will hate me or you will love me.
Whether my words will be rash or not.

Misunderstandings and prejudices
Come down from the sky like vultures.

The speech can bring the cruel judgments.
They come from behind like shadows.

I will be free from the demons in my mind,
If I'm able to talk to you without walls.
What I think dies when I turn it into words.
Truth is bad for those who don't want to listen to it.

I will support you or I'll let you fall down.
I will destroy you or I will extol you.
You will hate me or you will love me.
Whether my words will be rash or not.
