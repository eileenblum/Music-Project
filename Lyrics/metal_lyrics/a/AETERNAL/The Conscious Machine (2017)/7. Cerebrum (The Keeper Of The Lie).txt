[Lyric: Carmine Filizzola &amp; Alessandro Chiappetta, music: Alessandro Chiappetta &amp; Carmine Filizzola]

The keeper of the lie
Steadily affects your actions.
Shielded inside a skull
It generates sly enemies.

How many times have you been the master of your will?
Unaware of the actions you have done.
A thousand thoughts overlap strongly inside your brain.
You're deceived and out of your control.

Hush up the tricky voices
And fight the false ideas imposed.
Blast away the rooted dogma
Living your life with an open mind.
Your conscience is your only strength.
The means to realize your dreams
To give meaning to randomness.
Our only hope for a better world.

The neuronal chaos
It's the dimming of reason.
Synapses of societies
Compromised by misinformation.

How many times have you tried to seek truthful answers?
Untrained to know the right questions.
You are the hub between sanity and insanity.
The showdown with your instinct has begun.

Hush up the tricky voices
And fight the false ideas imposed.
Blast away the rooted dogma
Living your life with an open mind.
Your conscience is your only strength.
The means to realize your dreams
To give meaning to randomness.
Our only hope for a better world.
