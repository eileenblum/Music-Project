[Lyric: Carmine Filizzola &amp; Alessandro Chiappetta, music: Alessandro Chiappetta &amp; Carmine Filizzola]

My ears perceive the noise
That fill the squares and streets.
Between tears and laughters
I hear...

As rivers of sound waves,
Heavy words and empty speeches
Attempting to chew my conscience.
I listen...

Who understands the voice of the wise?
No one is listening.
I look at myself lonely in the crowd.
Did you belong to them?
In the confusion I've lost the direction.
Are you conscious like me?
How can I escape from this infernal noise?
Follow me and you'll find out.

Just close your eyes for a moment
And hear the sound of your breath.
Listen to the pulse of your heart
And you'll be out of the herd.
Now it's the moment to react to the apathy.
I'll be able to fly again beyond this silent noise.
Let it rise!

You hear the requests for help,
But for you they are just mute sounds.
Exiled in your selfishness
You sink.

Discerning the truth from the lies
The deafening buzz will end.
A new voice is rising.
You'll know.

Now I understand the voice of the wise.
Someone is listening.
I'm not alone in the crowd anymore.
So you're part of them too.
I'm not afraid of being misunderstood.
Now you're conscious like me.
I'll find serenity through secret spells.
You found out how to do it.

Just close your eyes for a moment
And hear the sound of your breath.
Listen to the pulse of your heart
And you'll be out of the herd.
Now it's the moment to react to the apathy.
I'll be able to fly again beyond this silent noise.
Let it rise!
