[music: Dennis, Costas lyrics: Jake]

"Sanity and insanity come together-don`t forget
Here we found the way to get it"

Welcome to the Model Death`s High-school
You speak with its General Director
It`s our pleasure to have you here in our favorite Killer Family

Justice means death of body and soul
You will surly learn it here
We`ll make you comprehend it for sure
To practice it perfectly

You`ll see a lot-you will hear a lot more
You have to believe them all-so simply
But it will cost your life if you try to convert`em
To convert`em out there

Your actual thoughts? Just hide`em inside you
Sense of love has no place in here
Everything that`s lovely has to die now
And this is your own duty.

[chorus]
Sanity and insanity come together-don`t forget
Here we found the way to get it
You`ll get it too and you`ll love it!

Don`t hesitate to practice even here 
Everything you`ve taught
Just try to make some practice on me
But remember I`ll survive!!!

With these few words I welcome you
I discriminate the terror in your eyes-but you`ve already got in

The doors behind you closed hermetically
Opened when you will become our own perfection:
