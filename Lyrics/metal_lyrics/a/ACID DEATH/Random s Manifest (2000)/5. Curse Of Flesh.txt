Deep in red I see unveiled things gather
The broken masks fall down, the blood withers the rose
The game just started

Carnage severed my limbs
Her lips destroyed my wings
And I see mirrors in black 
So I throw the dice again

Lost feeling of beauty or maybe positive act of wish
The matters totally confused but the fate so provocative

Lovelorn eyes emptiness
Desire erased my dreams in paint

The curse is what I feel
The inner fading away of love
Curse of flesh eternal domination facing to spirit
Eternal oh, Eternal cries, merciless mental stress
The passion for flesh strongly captures my thoughts 

Dark desire or sacred lust
Almost touching symmetry 
Including love and hate balanced
Iâd like to betray my heart but symmetry keeps me away from it
Till fading awayâ¦

Sleepless I wander in nights but deep within the lies
Drifting into your gray thoughts astray an seducible

I cryâ¦
Passion for flesh againâ¦
Her shadow charms me
And hypnotized I walk
I see her figure in white

Carnage severed my limbs
Her lips destroyed my wings
And I see mirrors in black 
So I throw the dice again

Itâs our flesh that is the greater trator
The betrayer who corrupts and weaken us 
More than any other foe
Passage to post-mortem deliverance
I quench my thirst, you will be mine
Crawling on your skin-I pay
You body with my tears
