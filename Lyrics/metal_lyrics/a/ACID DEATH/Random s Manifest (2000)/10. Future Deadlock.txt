[music: Dennis lyrics: Nick, Jake]

Eternal vivid dreams of past, now nightmares construct
A new empire of headless puppets, industry of materialized madness

Horror in cyber, panic and viruses, flesh and steel now collided

Man-machine is tomorrow`s generation 
Myths of past now stand alive
Mechanical slaves and lords, darkness covers all like alons before

[chorus]
Abominations are dancing in a static rhythm
Their hypnotic eyes tell how life fades
Crawling in the ground they`re dying full of filth and innocence
The numbers are lost, orders are confused, disorder is defused

Frantic scientists enhance the human body
Interstellar communication brings colonists from far beyond
Alienation causes the crossiny of breeds
Mutants are born and rule the world
Capacity is exhausted and explosion is expected

Disintegration of my soul I liquify my flesh and bones
Colors tip my eyes, blood dripping from my ears-formless and faceless
I travel trough cables and cords loosing my share
I ejaculate in a sea of webs filled with eyes and senses
And I feel that time and space has no meaning here:
