We are born into this world
Covered in blood, kicking and screaming
With a lonely path ahead of us
We march on the road of inevitability

All so very differentâ¦
Like snowflakes on the mountain topsâ¦

Striving to find someone
We act like just been born
We bleed, we kick, we scream, we fight
We dieâ¦

Always cherish the ones around you
Friendship taken in strides these days
Appreciate the ones who understand you
Because in the end this is all that matters

[Chorus]
Screamingâ¦Fightingâ¦
Dying Alone
A perfect life-circle that never endsâ¦
A flight to the unknown
Accepting fate that always leads
To Eternityâs Highwayâ¦

Relationships are all but easy
Some claim they are facile
But you know better than to falter
Its not all just bread and butter

No matter how you see it
Social being we all are
Keep your loved ones with you
Cause truth lies at the endâ¦

We bleedâ¦We Kickâ¦
We screamâ¦We fightâ¦
And die alone

Relationships are all but easy- Some claim they are facile
No matter how you see it- Keep your loved ones with you
We die aloneâ¦
