A strong dose of venom running in your veins
Thatâs my naked truth I offer to you
âHumanâ was your naming but this was just a lie
Now youâre my cruelest nightmareâs deed.

7 bullets-itâs all over!

[Chorus]
Odious Maggots-My truth inside your flesh
Odious Maggots-Always crawling in my remains

Corruption, decay, unfairness
Everything I saw you to create
Maybe sometime I could be more generous with you
But âNoâ you donât deserve to die as angels!

Strong pleasure â My hate for you is true!

[Repeat chorus]

Odious Maggots-My truth inside your flesh
Odious Maggots-your breath-a pure mess on my face
âHumanâ-a big lie â you donât deserve to hold
Odious Maggots-Always crawling in my remains
