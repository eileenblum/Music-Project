â¦Strongest sonsâ¦
Of his father strongest sons
Very few like him; his only peer his brothers
Sent out by Him to conquer the stars
With his mighty legion he sets his goals

â¦Striving for fullness
â¦Always nothing else
â¦His army now comes-comes and follows suit

In his mighty ship an army aside of his
Artist from across the universe
All document his feats

With sculpture and quill
Music and paint
They are here to immortalize perfection

[Chorus]
Eidolon! Your legion here for you!
A perfect Persona idolized!
Eidolon! Perfection is our guide!
Follow in your footsteps- perfection is achieved!

After all this time
And from within countless battles
Vision of true goal twisted
Corrupted from inside
And from his favorite brother

With blade of malice in his hand
Sets out to destroy

The Father that has so loved him
Of his legion some try to fight the corruption
Most die, few succeed but alas
His sons will follow
Through corruption, misconception, Heresy!

All Follow!

[Chorus]
Eidolon! Your legion here for you!
A perfect Persona idolized!
Eidolon! Perfection is our guide!
Follow in your footsteps- perfection is achieved!
