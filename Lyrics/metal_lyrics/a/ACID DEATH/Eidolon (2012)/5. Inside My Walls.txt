A colourful world spins around me
As I close my eyes and dive
Deep into my subconscious
A swirl of colours
Closed eye vision never betrays

What I see within me
Where I am inside me
I am timeless, void and vast
Darkness envelops but I welcome it

My mind opens doors to other dimensions
See places and events unfold
Things unheard of
To the human mind

Inside my walls
There is a place
Between Yin and Yang
(Inside my walls)
A place of solidarity
Where nothing touches me

Inside my walls
The future in unveiled
I sink deep within it
(Inside my walls)
And find all that might could be

My body transcends above
Naked but dressed in blinding light
Hands extend and touch the threads of fate
Fate of millions in the tips of fingers
The power of the mind in motion.

Inside my wallsâ¦
My mind opens doorsâ¦
To other dimensionsâ¦
