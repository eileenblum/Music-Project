Passion for life, passion for love
Clear feelings without compromise
No one would ever imagine the outcome
Nor himself or others or his safe placeâ¦

Madness is sanityâs sister
Without warnings and so simply
He was damaged inside his spirit
And died inside his environment

âYouâre searching for nothing!!â was crowdâs shout
But he was different, so unfamiliar with all
Helpless to some, Demon to others
Now heâs just a memory of shadow left behind him

Crossing the line he flew away
No one would ever learn or care
Even he had no knowledge of the limits
That tried -tried to â surpass in one spell

Naked thoughtsâ¦
Broken dreamsâ¦
Damaged soulâ¦
Suicideâ¦
Matterâ¦Crossing The Lineâ¦

âYou are God!â would got shouted if he was God
Truth was the only matter in his life
But this rope is betraying his deed

How easy you can fall down
Really, is there any possibility of return?
Near to all but so far away from them
Being a real Punk to their imaginary wishes

Let me now free your neck
This rope now belongs to me
I wasnât yours but you touched me
Wishing to meet you againâ¦
