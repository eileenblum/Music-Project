Lost in-in a maze
So alone and outcast
Hate is just the only friend
In his red and tired eyes
With a knife in his hand
That put his fear away

He wanders alone
Dressed in rags trying to survive
Becoming scorn in the eyes of his world
That stayed away from him like a real foe
And rejecting him with no-with no remorse

[Chorus]
Once he used to be someoneâ¦
A notable and strong man
Offering everything around him
Acceptable and popular
Now totally deserted
Having no sky aboveâ¦

Lifeâs irony personalized
His God betrayed his ambitions and desires
He lived in luxury; you still can see the love in eyes
But now he only tries to hide his tears

[Repeat chorus]

A notable and strong man
Offering everything around him
Always acceptable and popular
Now totally deserted
With No Skyâ¦Aboveâ¦
