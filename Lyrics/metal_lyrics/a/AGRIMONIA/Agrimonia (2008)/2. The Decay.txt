Your fingers reaching out 
Your eyes telling me 
Your body giving up 
Me without power 

My tears all I can give 
My anger my despise 
The poison eats you alive 
I can see every bite 

Speechless 
Not strong enough 
To help 
To give you life back 

Every word you say 
Someone else's voice 
Every word I say 
Won't reach you 

Every breath is like 
The last one 
I stand helpless 
Watching th decay 

Speechless 
Not strong enough 
To help 
To give you life back 

Your thoughts no longer here 
Alone you stand with freezing mind 
The step I take where it will end 
When all there is 
Is the decay of a friend
