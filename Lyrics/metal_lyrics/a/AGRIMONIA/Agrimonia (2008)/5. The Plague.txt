Living dead 
Cold heart 
Cold blood 
Once was alive 

These gates have infected my mind 
And now your words are mine 
Stagger around in silence 
Afraid to open my mouth 

Buried alive 
In the grip of this plague 
Deeds of darkness in my mind 
The walls and the bars 
Smother me and paralyse 
My body a hollow shell 
Can't leave this devastating state 

I am living dead shattered dreams 
Without hope the truth lies buried 
Zero on the dice 
When the battle finally sets 

You clip my wings 
Sew my lips together 
Fill me up with lies 
Too weak to say no 
I accept the leash around my neck 
Like a plague that takes our lives 
A knife stabbing our brains 
The nightmare never ends 
When I close my eyes I see the plague 

Living dead 
Cold heart 
Cold blood 
Once was alive
