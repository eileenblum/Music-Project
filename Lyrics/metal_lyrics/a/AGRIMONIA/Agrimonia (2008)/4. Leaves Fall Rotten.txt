Walking side by side 
Towards the end 
You take me to 
Where life meets death 

Where shadows beome real 
I can feel their breath 
Buried emotions 

Once forgotten 
Now again they rise 
Black clouds 
All over the sky 
Once faded 
Now they are shining bright 
A blinding storm 
A crumbling past 

Gathering up smothering life 
Leaves fall rotten my life runs through 
Like birds leaving ground 
Flying fast never to turn around 

Like fire in my heart my freedom burns 
Free again my luck has turned 
Hate or love - What did I choose 
Hate or love - What did I lose
