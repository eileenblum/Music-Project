Wounds make scars 
Scars make life 
My life 
My war 

Life goes on 
Time heals wounds 
My wounds 
My war 

Woken by grief 
Grasping life 
Holding on 
Remove myself 
From the story 
That I wrote 
It is too late and it hurts 

The past is burning with pure hate 
The chains are broken 
The tidal waves will turn and change 
Demons' tongues have spoken 

You live in my heart 
Like a spreading disease 
You live in my heart 
Soon comes the final release 

Time fought the pain 
Flesh and blood gone bad 
The story is written 
My ink is dry 
I have endured hell
