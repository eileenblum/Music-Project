I hide 
Beneath 
The wind 
Above raging high 

I hide 
Beneath 
The wind 
Above raging high 

Wings spread out 
Screams cut the night 
The storm has passed 
All crumbled up 
Wings spread out 

Like a foetus 
My skin is transparent 
Thoughts shine through 
You read my mind 
My eyes are open yet I am blind 

Fear 
I'm fearing life itself 
The sorrow I once felt 
A shadow that used to be me 
Used by you to weaken me 
Sentenced to living 
In the unknown that buries me
