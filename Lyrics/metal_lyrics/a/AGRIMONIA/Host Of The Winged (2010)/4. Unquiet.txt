Through fog and frozen grounds
The flames of passing time
has burned the ruins down
A place of many places
The waking hour is here
Unquiet he calls
When his soul is left behind

Moving cold - until the anger is drained
Walk the path â until the birds are silent
Fuel the match â until the fire is gone
Forever roam â in a frozen world

Dead waters hit the shore
Ripples in the sand
Echoes from a grim past
Our destiny to come
Worship the wasted years
A grainy image
Birds in the shape of the raging sea
