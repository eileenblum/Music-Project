Forsake the abandoned ones
Hear the silence ringing in your ears
Weeping with no tears
Insulin in the blood again released

Sent to a gruesome place
Stripped to the bone
Detested like poison then pest you became
The stench of betrayal lays thick

Wading in the glow 
Of the ashes burnt
Where both moths and rust consume us
And destroy what is left

Beasts of prey
Ripping their enemies to bits
Harvest their discontent
Shatter their dreams 
The day has come now 
To reap what they sow
To stand trial for corrupted ideas

Time for the last sleep 
The eternal rest is here
Never to wake again
Your curse, your fatal mistake

Haunting memories
Your ignorance darken my door
Hidden in the gloom
Damnation of the soul
Whispers of liars in disguise
Vowed to never forget till the day of doom

Time for the last sleep 
The eternal rest is here
Never to wake again
Your curse, your fatal mistake

A song of love and hate
In the shadows a foul play
Marionettes by their hands
Our wires pulled tight 

Desolated souls of evil
Pawns of this battle
Rivals until the last drop
A dispute that never stops
