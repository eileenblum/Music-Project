Run aground
In scars it's written
Stare blind
The serum injected 
Time is my antidote
A sigh â I suffer
Bare are the lines in my face
Furrowed

Tears will flow
To see something further
Here I am
So torn
Famine of my heart
A whisper â I drown
Holes gaping of inner rage
My last will
