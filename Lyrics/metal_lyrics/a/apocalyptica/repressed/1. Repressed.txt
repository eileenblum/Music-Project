[Feat. Max Cavalera &amp; Matt Tuck]

I traveled the way that you showed me
Left all my sorrows behind
"I'm leaving", which grows your own starving
Expecting myself to be fine

So why don't fuck out
My loneliness grows
And shut up the door
To get all the fights is awarded
The watching strength you want for

I left my sorrow behind
VocÃª precisa proteÃ§Ã£o! [Portuguese]

Your words that gave me direction
Helped me turn into what I thought I wanted
Fists that gave me direction.
Helped me deal with you.
So for now our days are through.

Nothing left
Nothing rests
Nothing grasp

You declared what your faith is.
But you still have the fear.
The way you've left your life open.
will not bring your destiny here.
Do I continue my journey.
confusion is wrapped in my mind.
so when you're gone with your martyr.
you can continue your lies.

Your words that gave me direction
Helped me turn into what I thought I wanted
Fists that gave me direction.
Helped me deal with you.
So for now our days are through.

I left my sorrows behind, I left my sorrows behind.
Warning not to give up the fight,
Warning not to give up the fight.
You declared what your faith is.
but you still have the fear.
I will continue my journey.
I need your lies no more.

Your words that gave me direction
Helped me turn into what I thought I wanted
Fists that gave me direction.
Helped me deal with you.
So for now our days are through.

DireÃ§Ã£o
ProteÃ§Ã£o
So for now our days are through.
Me diga a verdade.
DireÃ§Ã£o
ProteÃ§Ã£o
So for now our days are through
Nothing left.
Nothing rests.
Nothing grasps.
Never underate the man with nothing left inside.
Never underate the man with nothing left inside.
