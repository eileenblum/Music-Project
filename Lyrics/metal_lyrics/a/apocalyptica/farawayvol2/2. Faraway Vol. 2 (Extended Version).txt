[Featuring Linda Sunblad]

There's something in the way you always somewhere else
Feelings have deserted me to a point of no return
I don't believe in God but I pray for you

Don't you slip away from me, it's you I live for don't you leave
Don't you slip away from me, I'm vulnerable to your love

Don't let them get you, stay away from the sun
It's too bright for you
Your eyes getting blurry - stay, I'm crying your name
I don't believe in God but I pray for you

Don't you slip away from me, it's you I live for don't you leave
No, don't you slip away from me, I'm vulnerable to your love

There is something in the way you're always somewhere else
Feelings have deserted me to a point of no return
So the light fades out and you're so close to losing

Don't you slip away from me, it's you I live for don't you leave
No, don't you slip away from me, I'm vulnerable to your love
Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live my life for
No don't leave

Don't you slip away from me, I'm vulnerable to your love
Don't you slip away
