[feat. Cristina Scabbia &amp; Mats Leven]

Bound to your side and trapped in silence
Just a possession
Is the sex or only violence
That feeds your obsession

You send me to a broken state
Where I can take the pain
Just long enough
That I am numb
That I just disappear

So go on and fight me
Go on and scare me to death
Tell me I asked for it
Tell me I'll never forget
You could give me anything but love
Anything but love

Does it feel good tonight
Hurt me with nothing
Some sort of sick satisfaction
You Get from mind fucking

Oh stripped down to my naked core
The darkest corners of my mind are yours
That's where you live
That's where you breathe

So go on and fight me
Go on and scare me to death
Dare me to leave you
Tell me I'd never forget
You could give me anything but love
Anything but love

Without any faith
Without any light
Condemn me to live
Condemn me to lie
Inside I am dead

So go on and fight me
Go on and scare me to death
I'll be the victim
You'll be the voice in my head
You could give me anything but love
Anything but love
Anything but love
Anything but love
Anything but love
Anything but love
