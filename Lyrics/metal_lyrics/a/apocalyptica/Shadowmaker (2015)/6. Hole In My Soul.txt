Itâs getting dark and Iâm lost in the woods
Iâd find a way out if I knew where to look
If I could, Iâd rip this page out of my book
Confused and misguided, my faith is beside me

Iâve got a hole in my soul where you use to be
Thereâs a thorn in my heart and itâs killing me
I wish I could go back and do it all differently
âCause now thereâs a hole in my soul where you use to be

A fire inside but my bloods turning cold
Iâm walking alone down this desolate road
Yesterday feels like a life time ago
The memories are fading, my dreams are all changing

Thereâs a hole in my heart in my life in my way
And itâs filled with regret and all I did, to push you away
If thereâs still a place in your life in your heart for me
I would do anything, so donât ask me to leave

Iâve got a hole in my soul where you use to be
You're the thorn in my heart and you're killing me
I wish I could go back and do it all differently
I wish that Iâd treated you differently
âCause now thereâs a hole in my soul where you use to be
