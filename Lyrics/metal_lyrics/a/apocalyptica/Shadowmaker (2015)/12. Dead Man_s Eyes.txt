A narrow path through hallowed grounds
A silent walk among the clouds
A pile of stones hidden in the pine
Only seen through dead manâs eyesâ¦

Autumn leaves turn brandy wine
Fall and dance in the wind outside
A shadow wanders though the fog
Searching for the light it lost

Iâm not afraid
Because Iâm not alone
Sheâs waiting there
To carry me home

A lifetime written in his weathered red face
Every triumph, every fall from grace
Another winters come and gone
It wonât be longâ¦

Iâm not afraid
Because Iâm not alone
Sheâs waiting there
To carry me home

Iâm coming home,
Iâm coming home!
