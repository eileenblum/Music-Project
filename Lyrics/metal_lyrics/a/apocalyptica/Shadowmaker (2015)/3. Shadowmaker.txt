[feat. Franky Perez]Reach through my window and pull the shades
No shine, no sunlight, just cold and grey
Thereâs no way to rise from beneath your wings
Chained to your side, I can never leave

[Chorus:]
You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me
Shadow maker,
Youâre dragging me down with your suicidal symphony
Shadow maker, over my head, over my head

Everything is so empty, no glass half full
How can someone so beautiful be so miserable?
Iâd follow you down to the edges of earth
Just to hear you say that your life is cursed

[Chorus:]
You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me
Shadow maker,
Youâre dragging me down with your suicidal symphony
Shadow maker over my head, over my head

You wonât let me leave, I donât wanna stay
But the price on my head is weighing me down
And it feels like Iâm dying inside
But you donât care, we carry on

You wonât let me leave, I donât wanna stay
But the price on my head is weighing me down
And it feels like Iâm dying inside
But you donât care, we carry on

You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me
Youâre dragging me down with your suicidal symphony
Shadow maker

[Chorus:]
You choke out the light like a cloud hanging over me
Shadow maker
Youâre dragging me down with your suicidal symphony
Shadow maker over my head, over my head

Back the f*ck up
Back the f*ck up
Back the f*ck up
