When you speak my name it donât matter to me
Where you place your blame it donât matter to me
Oh where could you be walking to it donât matter to me
Where do you go to?

You waded out, you waded out. The sea calls back to you

Take my wicked heart it donât matter to me
Turn my twisted words it donât matter to me
Oh what are you here waiting for it donât matter to me

Where do you go to you donât matter to me
You waded out, you waded out. The sea calls back to you
