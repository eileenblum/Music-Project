I am standing like a road block
Buried in the side walk
I need something more than nothing
Something make me feel alive, alive

I would die to feel alive
Hang me high and bleed me dry

Cause every door you closed
Every debt you owe
Is waiting there when you...
Come back down

The pain and suffering
The ones you couldnât face
Are waiting there when you...
Come back down

I am standing at a crossroad
Staring down the barrel of a loaded gun
I am breathing under water
In case my demons drag me down

I would die to feel alive
Hang me high and bleed me dry

Cause every door you closed,
Every debt you owe
Is waiting there when you...
Come back down

The pain and suffering
The child you couldnât save
Is waiting there when you...
Come back down

Take me back to where Iâm from

My blackened fingertips
Push the judge and jury in
Let the iron spin one last time
I laid down in my bed
To dye the pillow crimson red
Turn my head inside out
I couldnât stand myself, but God
I was so eager to please
I gave away everything to make room for my disease
Lace your hands around my neck
Make a fist and steal my breath
Iâll praise your name and sign my name
One last time
Leave my skin on the floor
Kick the chair, stretch the cord
Till that part of me is gone for good
Itâs gone for good...

Bring me back to life!

Cause every door you closed
Every debt you owed
Is waiting there when you
Come back down

The pain and suffering
The truth you couldnât face
Is waiting there when you
Come back
Come back
Come back down.
