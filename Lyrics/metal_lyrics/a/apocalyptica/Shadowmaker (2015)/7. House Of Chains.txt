Pitch black, no light
No day, no night
Iâm trapped inside your broken house of chains

When you invited me into your majesty
I was so eager to please I treated you like a temple
Didnât take long to find your kind it preys on my kind
Getting in was so easy, getting out not so simple

You keep me underneath your angel wings
Iâm tied to you (in your house of chains)
Iâm locked inside you know Iâll never leave
Iâm yours to use (in your house of chains)

Rooms full of trophies of all the victims before me
Nothing left but the bones stacked up like a collection
You got me smothered in bliss you suffocate with a kiss
You take away all the fight then bring me down to submission

You keep me underneath your angel wings
Iâm tied to you (in your house of chains)
Iâm locked inside you know Iâll never leave
Iâm yours to use (in your house of chains)

Iâm trapped inside your cold embrace (in your house of chains)
Iâm locked inside you know Iâll never leave
Iâm yours to use (in your house of chains)
