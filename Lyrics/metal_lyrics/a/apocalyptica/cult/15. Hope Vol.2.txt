[Special Edition track]

[Featuring Matthias Sayer]

Hope is beauty,
Personified,
At her feet, the world,
Hypnotized.

A million flashes,
A million smiles,
And on the catwalk,
She flats in style

But in this heart of darkness
Our hope lies lost and torn;
All flame like love is fleeting
When there's no hope anymore

Pain and glory,
Hand in hand,
A sacrifice,
The highest price;

Like the poison in her arm
Like a whisper she was gone...
Like when angels fall.

And in this heart of darkness
All hope lies on the floor;
All love like fame is fleeting
When there's no hope anymore

Like the poison in her arm
Like a whisper, she was gone
Like an angel,
And Angels fall

Like the poison in her arm
Like a whisper, she was gone
Like an angel,
And Angels fall

Like the poison in her arm
Like a whisper, she was gone
Like an angel,
And Angels fall
