[Featuring Ville Valo &amp; Lauri YlÃ¶nen]

[Ville]
I'm giving up the ghost of love
And a shadow is cast on devotion

[Lauri]
She is the one that I adore
Queen of my silent suffocation

[Both]
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny

[Ville]
Bittersweet

[Lauri]
I won't give up
I'm possessed by her

[Ville]
I'm bearing a cross
She's turned into my curse

[Both]
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny

[Lauri]
Bittersweet

I want you

[Ville]
Oh how I wanted you

[Lauri]
And I need you

[Ville]
Oh how I needed you

[Both]
Break this bittersweet spell on me
Lost in the arms of destiny

Bittersweet
