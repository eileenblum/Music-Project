[limited edition track]

[lyrics and vocals by Marta JandovÃ¡]

My life is a circle
No beginning and no end
It's always repeating
A trail I defend to the time

A misunderstanding
That can't be erased like a file
I've got all I wanted
But still I'm not satisfied

How far will I go to and search my respect and my pride
How long will I lie to myself about the privilege of my life
That turns around
'Till I die
And take the dark
With me

Why am I sad
Why am I sad when I have more that I ever had

My life is too stable
I get no air
My jail is my skin
I'm false like a fable
That is being praised
For its sin

Once I am trying
To follow the light then
The bitch grips my feet
Pulls me down, underneath

How far will I go to and search my respect and my pride
How long will I lie to myself about the privilege of my life
How deep will I have to fall before I find the will again
It's always repeating
The earth turns around and around
'Till I die
Take the time
Missing me
With me
