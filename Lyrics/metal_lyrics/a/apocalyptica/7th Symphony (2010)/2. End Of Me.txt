[Feat. Gavin Rossdale]

Rosaries left under the mattress of the memories who could bear the witness

As you slip into oblivion, use it like a weapon
Am I left to bleed waiting for the moment when you've had your fun
A loaded gun

Take away your broken misery, I can't wait to erase your memory
This love, this love is gonna be the end of me
Everything I gave is wasted, I'm the one who suffocated
This love, this love is gonna be the end of

Can't resist poisoning the message
Just a narcissist trapped inside the wreckage
And the sympathy I had is gone deadened by the ceremony
Drama queen stand behind your empire as your kingdom falls all because

Take away your broken misery, I can't wait to erase your memory
This love, this love is gonna be the end of me.
Everything I gave is wasted, I'm the one who suffocated
This love, this love is gonna be the end of me

Your rescue, my undo
I'm not the one to save you
I'm empty completely
I'm drowning in your shadow

Take away your broken misery, I can't wait to erase your memory
This love, this love is gonna be the end of me.
Everything I gave is wasted, I'm the one who suffocated
This love, this love is gonna be the end of

Can't chase away your ghost, inside it only grows
Nothing left but misery
This will be the end of me
All the shit that you created, all the scars you celebrated
Couldn't take away your pain
Couldn't resurrect your gain
This love will be the end of me, this love will be the end.
