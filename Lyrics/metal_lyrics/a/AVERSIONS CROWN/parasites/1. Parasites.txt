Humanity will bleed under my hateful wrath
Weeping as I crush your species
Such a malignant reign will be removed from history
Purged from the earth
Extinction of man

Branding their planets with fluorescent light structures of malicious design
Infecting the living with prodromal blight
Seeping poison into the night
Observing as they bathe in greed
Raping the land to feed their needs
A vermin complex will forever corrode
The universe before their throne

Parasites
Spreading like cancer
Parasites
They must be erased

I was born to cleanse the ominverse of malevolent species
Forged within the stasis of the void
The extinction being
My colossal shadow overrides the sun
Culling vermin one by one
Siphoning bodies into the sky
Stealing the last breath of humankind
Into the night
Where the darkness eats everything it hides
Mass genocide
The only solution for this human disease

The end of man at the grasp of my hands
Cleansing the universe
Exonerate the earth from human scum

Parasites
Spreading like cancer
Parasites
They must be erased

I am the extinction being
I am death, destroyer of man
Cleanser of worlds
I am the god of extinction
I am your god [7x]
