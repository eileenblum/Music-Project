Feel the tremors
The orbital disruptors
The machine tearing open the gateway
Crippling fluctuations and anomalies
Your ideologies have failed you

The alignment is almost complete
Subspace arteries are bringing me back
It's this place, the gravity here
Tectonically unstable
The alignment is almost complete
Subspace arteries bringing me back
Feel the tremors, the gravity here
The machine tearing open the gateway

A scion of our former species
Are descending from the other realm
Shape-shifting and manipulating
Preparations for the ultimate collapse

An explicit and exact region
A catalyst for the final convergence
This is the time when our worlds coalesce
An explicit and exact region
A catalyst for the final convergence
This is the time all human thought will collapse

The universe is resonating
Bringing these two worlds together
Fighting the demons above to find the devil within
The phantoms within your mind transcend the barrier into the physical realm
You are the father of the illusion

Fighting the demons above to find the devil within
