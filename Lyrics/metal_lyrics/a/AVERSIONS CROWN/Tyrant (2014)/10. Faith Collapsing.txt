It was a precursor, the true form will not reveal itself
It has paralyzed, death will come slowly
This is the cleansing

A dark cloud fills the atmosphere, overwhelmed humanity's pulse is weakening
Aftershocks continue to split the world apart, the attack has recoiled
But the machine cradles the planet, watching the earth being brought to its knees
Spilling forth from its blackened heart

Now it's in your veins and it's beneath your feet
And your surroundings are not what they seem
From the depths of the warp, its crawled into my mind
Now it's in your veins and it's beneath your feet
And your surroundings are not what they seem
The true form will not reveal itself, I will reveal them

A dark cloud fills the atmosphere overwhelmed earth's pulse is depleted
Watching the earth being brought to its knees
This is the cleansing, death will come slowly
Unworthy of what has been given, it will all be erased
Every breath will be taken, mankind will be replaced
Shackled to the idea of liberation
Clutching to the idea of heaven
Slaving to a false idol
Serving a false idol
Blindly feeding the monster
That will one day devour you

Into the earth, I return to the blackened heart, I am the monster
Into the earth, I return to the blackened heart, we are the legion
