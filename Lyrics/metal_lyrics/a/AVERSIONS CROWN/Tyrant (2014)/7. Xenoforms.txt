(It's speaking to me, it's speaking to all of us
It's controlling me, it's controlling all of us)

Once a masterpiece of civilization, broken scattered and in ruin
Once a masterpiece of civilization, broken scattered and in fucking ruin
This is where the epicenter of the empire was sucked into the warp
This is where they lost their faith in us
Intense complexity falling into corruption and transcending time
It became consumed by the single idea of ending all of the life
It has twisted them it created the one true nemesis of everything
Eternally thirsting for the anguish of every living thing
The redemption machine, the engine that crafted our world
A construct that spans the dimensions
Intertwining with thought and existence
Past present and parallel
It waits for you on the other side of the veil [2x]
Once a masterpiece of civilization, broken scattered and in ruin
Once a masterpiece of civilization, broken scattered and in fucking ruin
It will end all life
It will end the cancer of this world
It will end all of your fucking lives

The rift is open

It's controlling me
It's controlling all of us
It's speaking to me
It's speaking to all of us
The oculus breathes once more and the hive world has slipped through
This is now reality, fuck

Deceiver, the man of many faces [2x]
