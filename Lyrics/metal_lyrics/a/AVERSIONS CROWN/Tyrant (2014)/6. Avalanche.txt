As the new world is ushered in
Sold out one by one with a stroke on your forehead
He's marked you for death
Your protector, your leader - a calloused man in sheep's clothing
Your saviour, the deceiver - serpentine in the form of a man

This is the foundation of your demise
The serpent has cast its spell
Razor wire tongues and hollowed out eyes
Crafted the ultimate lie
The question still beckoning an answer
Your latest technologies proved futile and the resistance crushed under foot

Their bodies were pulled into the sky [2x]

As the new world is ushered in
Sold out one by one with a stroke on your forehead
He marked you for death
Your protector, your leader - a calloused man in sheep's clothing
Your saviour, the deceiver - serpentine in the form of a man

Every loophole exploited
Every security network shutdown
Cast out from your own fucking planet
As the new world is ushered in
You have all been sold out one by one with a stroke on your forehead
You have been marked for death

Deceiver, the man of many faces [2x]
