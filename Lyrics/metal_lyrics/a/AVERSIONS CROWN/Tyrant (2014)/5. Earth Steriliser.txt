Sculpting the throne of the wraith being
From the burnt and crushed landscapes of a thousand conquered worlds
Bastardizing the human form

Transfixing existence and freezing time
Leaving a barren lifeless planet
The strongest minds diminished and broken
Causing the world to shift its pole's
Unhinging the fabric that separates dimensional gateways opening
This is planetary exile

[2x]
I've never known that the warp could be so cold
Euphoria overcomes me as the world slips into darkness

Connecting direct to our leader
Pulling harder on the strings of the vessel
The sequence decodes ruptures the ground
Sculpting the throne of the wraith being
From the burnt and crushed landscapes of a thousand conquered worlds
Bastardizing the human form

The leeches of the rift world have their teeth in me
Transfixing existence and freezing time
Leaving a barren planet
Crushed landscapes, conquered worlds
I have never known that the warp could be so cold

The world slips into darkness [4x]
