Discharging from the blackest abyss
Feeding off the resources

Choking the atmosphere with their descent
Pushing the fringe of existence
Wormholes open and stabilize
A pervasive anxiety strangles the Earth
A species native only to the foulest womb that bears it
Every movement is calculated against the last
Bound in strict union by a single unfathomable intelligence
It's in consciousness

These are the forerunners of your apocalypse
Seamlessly designed to fulfill their roles
Drain the life from your world

From the blackest abyss, native only to the womb
An avalanche of destruction
Engines of malevolence draining the blood from the world
I felt my life leave this vessel, collapsing in despair
This is the last time I will see the stars

Choking the atmosphere with their descent
Feeding off the resources
Pushing the fringe of existence
Punish the world

The planet is collapsing
Punish the world

Legions will bow to the sentinel of this foulest fucking warp
Discharging from the blackest abyss
Feeding off the resources
Choking the atmosphere with their descent
Pushing the fringe of existence
Wormholes open and stabilize
A pervasive anxiety strangles the Earth
A species native only to the foulest womb that bares it
Bound in strict union

From the blackest abyss
Native only to the womb
An avalanche of destruction
Engines of malevolence draining the blood from the world
I felt my life leave this vessel, collapsing in despair
This is the last time I will see the stars

I gave my soul for this dying world
Earth will mourn
