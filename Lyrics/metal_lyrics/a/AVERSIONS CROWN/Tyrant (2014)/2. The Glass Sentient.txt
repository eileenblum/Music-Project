The earth stands still
As the blastwave hits
Enveloping the ocean and the sky
The labyrinth ceases to breathe
All humankind will weep

Transfixed and crystallized
When the earth recoils and it slips from its axis
The ocean devours the land

A dying existence
Empty and built on the greed of a vermin species
Kneel and beg before me
Foundations of your beliefs have been disproven and crushed before your fucking eyes

A misplaced faith in the harbinger of your annihilation
You can offer nothing to me but your fucking lives

Nothing can save you, shield from this desolation
This is your resting place

The earth stands still
As the blastwave hits
Enveloping the ocean and the sky
The labyrinth ceases to breathe
All humankind will weep

This is your resting place
Humanity's frozen tomb
Nothing can save you, shield from this desolation
You will come to know it well

What you believe
God and the devil to be
They exist in a single entity
They exist in me

[2x]
What you believe
God and the devil to be
They exist in a single entity

They exist in me
