Origins of man
Synthesized in the pools of creation
Procreated synthetically
Conceived into reality
Strands of DNA
Formulated the human form initiated
Cast down upon the earth
To harvest
Light

Born to harvest light
Under the guidance of my
Imperial guardians
Enslaved by minions
Forging structures
Triangular pyramids of fruition

Planetary energies
Immaculate synergies
Siphoning, gathering, conjuring my sacrifice
Consumed by rage
Our creation was led astray
Injecting insanity into their damaged veins

Chaos unleashed upon the will of man
As their predatory instincts awakened
Screaming into the empty sky
Burning the earth that gave them life
Savages crawling through the thickness of mud
Dwelling within sadistic lust
Crucified vessels of our guardians
Defiled in odium

Watching as humanity bathes
In the blood of purity
Witness creation
Deformed of belief
Living and breathing
For their own fate
Cannibalizing
Thinning their herds
Absent a conscious of moral standards

Send forth the shadow of death
Cleanse this world of human stench
Let them burn
Let them cry
Let them feel demise

Chaos unleashed upon this will of man
As their predatory instincts awakened
Screaming into the empty sky
Burning the earth that gave them life
Savages crawling through the mud thickness of mud
Dwelling within sadistic lust
Crucified vessels of our guardians
Defiled in odium

Extinctions descends
Tearing apart Pangaea
The continents shift
Volcanic fissures
Drown the masses
Ugly deformed listen as they sing to this wallowing tune
Screaming crying
Burning dying
Disfigured beneath extinctions shadow
Melting flesh covers the earth in smoke
Inhale the stench of purification
