Upon the cortex of the omniverse
A portal tears through the fabrics of time
Bleeding darkness from its eye
Vomiting gravity

Moulding the pulse of eternity
Gateways of singularity
Submerged within obscurity
Invaded by an entity

Dimensional planes disfiguring
Polarized and slowly shifting
Equilibrium now redefined
Eternity has been redesigned

Human life ever so mundane
Resurrected unto this plane
Cries of eternal pain
Drowning out the light of day
Savages excreted from time
Reborn into a malevolent life
Savages spliced with DNA
The human gene perpetuates

Time has relapsed
Moulded through a change in the past
Impulsions are tainted
Time has relapsed
From the apex in which we stand
Reality has turned dystopian
Pulses of sempiternity converged
The omniverse burns

Watching as our worlds collapse
Beneath the human grasp
Hybrids of reptilian DNA
Breathing a seething hate
From within this ominous rift
Something exists
Forging a reality defined
By its vision of lies

Observing the past and present
Re-sync pulses relapse
Observing the past and present
Re-sync pulses relapse

Reconstructing the divine
From within the divide
Within its depths hatred awaits
Smothering life with pain

The omniverse reborn, forevermore
Extinction was branded upon the flesh
Condemning those of human descent
Aeons have passed since the offset of humanity
The mass extermination of the origins
That I conceived
Beneath our feet suffering
Dissolves reality
A dystopia of impurity
I turn my back on the omniverse
In a stance of utter shame
Only to look upon
My brethren disintegrate

Savages excreted from time
Reborn into a malevolent life
Savages spliced with DNA
The human gene perpetuates
