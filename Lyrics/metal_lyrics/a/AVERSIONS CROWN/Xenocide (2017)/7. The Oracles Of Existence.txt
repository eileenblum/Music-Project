We, the oracles of existence
Watching over the planets
To restore balance
Solar systems cleansed
Advocated at the signal from our brethren

Sickened by human existence
Stimulated through their extinction
Star maps marked with infestations
Bring forth dehumanization

Our presence will be felt
As we shade your world
With the shadow of death
The horror released to drain
The life from this putrid race

Plagues of death seep through their homes
Devouring human flesh
Plagues of death feast on their bones
Devouring human flesh

Masses cry and beg for death
As the acidic venom
Spreads through their veins
Paralyzed as my insects feed
Weaponized to cure this human disease

The universal human swarm
Corroding planets and breathing havoc
Dragging their bones over the ashes of atomic bombs

We, the oracles of existence
Watching over the planets
To restore balance
Solar systems cleansed
Advocated at the signal from our brethren

Our presence will be felt
As we shade your world
With the shadow of death
The horror released to drain
The blood from this putrid race

The plagues are released

Plagues of death upon the world
Cured of humanity
Plagues of death upon the world
Cured of humanity

Massacre of the human flesh
Bodies festering with death
Another planetary system cleansed
Now we move onto the next
