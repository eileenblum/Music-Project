That sweet scent of divinity
Guides me through this prismatic maze
Such paradoxical abstractions
Won't conceal you from my infinite reach

I have done such horrible things
Danced on the skin of my infant kin
Disemboweled them
And pleasured myself with their severed limbs

We are nothing
Walking through this path of oblivion
Followed by the tortured souls
Our nefarious ideal have consumed

We shall walk this path alone
Facing the pain we have induced
The state of nature can be so cruel
What you deal unto others
Shall be dealt upon you

Child of nocturnal metamorphosis
Possessed by a vengeful rage
Embodied sewn within
Your brothers carcasses

I fear not your name
Nor your arrogance
Your clouded vision can't see
You are no different than the
Human virus you once conceived.

Ceremonial symbolism
Carved within my elegant scale
Into this pit of thorn and nail
I am impaled and eviscerated

Bleeding primordial ooze
All consuming black hole
Erasing everything
Swallowing the fabrics of reality
All that's left is a cold blackness
Compressed by the tension of dark matter

We are nothing
Walking through this path of oblivion
Followed by the tortured souls
Our nefarious ideal have consumed

Nexus father
I have come to ease your suffering
Everything I touch slowly dies
Embrace your child one last time

Stare within my reptilian eyes
And fear the hate that lurks behind
The moment our fates collide
The gift of life will be denied
