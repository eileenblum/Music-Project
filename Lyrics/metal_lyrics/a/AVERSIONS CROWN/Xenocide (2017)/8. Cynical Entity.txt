Beneath the veil
A morbid voice emerges
Telling of a world enslaved
By its hateful reign

'Watch closely,' it tells me,
'Gaze into the rift, watch me embody.'
Stricken with fear
I tremble
This blackened figure
Assembles
Crawling forth unto this plane
Fear its unsympathetic bane

So I stood dormant burning alight
Etched within the cortex of your suns
The seething agony that I once felt has returned
To rape this world

Dragging a flail of severed skulls
Trophies of sadism
Raising forth its monument
The infant skulls of my brethren

I can feel the seething hate
Projecting from its vile presence
As it stares into my eyes
I hear a voice repeat the verse

I am the filth you welcomed into your righteous being
I corrupted divinity and freed your soul from agony

Now I've returned to inflict genocide
Drenched in the blood of your brethren
For I am the evil within you
The hatred you once embodied

So I stood dormant burning alight
Etched within the cortex of your suns
The seething agony that I once felt has returned
To rape this world

Slowly the suns have died
In a reality far from thy (far from thy)
I was reformulated
Reborn, emancipated
Gifted life through certain death

I am the filth you welcomed into your righteous being
I corrupted divinity and freed your soul from agony

We are one of the same
Infused anomalies

Once again you've turned back
On the hatred you conceived
You created me
The cynical entity
The shadow of your mistakes
