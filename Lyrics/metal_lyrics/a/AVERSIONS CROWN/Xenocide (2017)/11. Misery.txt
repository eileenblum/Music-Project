Placed within the harvest floor
Blending into my synthesis
Immerse within stasis wombs
The siphoning tombs
Trapped inside the shadow of famine
Humanity slipped into oblivion
Stolen from the vile throne
That they call their home

Processing the souls of man to deny access to their reanimation
Spectral life embedded inside the anatomy of metaphysical minds
Dissecting these entities
Transfused anatomies
Ingesting their memories
Feeding off anomalies

Absorbing the anguish
The misery feast
Stimulated off such agony
Drinking the blood from these beasts
Saving some for future feasts

Placed within the harvest floor
Blending into my synthesis
Immersed within stasis wombs
The siphoning tombs
Bleeding, crying, prevented from dying
Circulating a venomous mass
Immortalized in the depths of suffering
Demoralized of their human presence
Behold coalescence
Quenching my thirst with their human essence

Processing the souls of man to deny access to their reanimation
Spectral life embedded inside the anomaly of metaphysical minds
Dissecting these entities
Transfused anatomies
Ingesting their memories
Feeding off anomalies

This is my design
The harvesting fields of humanity
Siphoning the agony
These organisms
A collective mass of misery
Breathing in the pain they leak through the gills of my deformity
Feeding off their pain
Feeding off their misery
Defiled of their purity as they drown in the sorrow of our unity

Enigmatic woes
Stimulate me
I am the beast from the depths
The disgusting consequence
Reborn into life from death
To feed upon the woes of man
