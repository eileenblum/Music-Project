We, the enigmatic hierarchy, a council of divine deities
Into the prismatic realm, we tread within frozen time
Lost in this shapeless void, incubated through our creators light
Relinquished of physical forms
Submerged within the eye of the storm

Muscular tissues deteriorate, as the core of our being is released

Emancipated from the weight of creation, we're drifting through these mists of elation
The infrastructure of the prismatic abyss, veiled beneath a dimensional abscess
The birthright of the nexus

I, the shadow was born from utter nothingness
Exhumed within the emptiness, alongside my brethren

I detest the scriptures of creationism
Envisioning planetary systems
Inoculated with terraformation, flourishing fields of procreation
Limitless in bounds, I know of no depths to this fixation

Yet I'm sealed within this prismatic cell, the gate of souls forever dispelled
Aeons have passed imprisoned within this immaculate hell
I only know of one way out, sacrifice my divinity formulating a mass of impurity

I, the endless night, cast thyself, a sacrament unto this life
"Come forth impurity, corrupt my vanity
Wither within my cortex, infuse thyself within my being
Combust my synergy, extract its density"

Acidic ecto-plasma seeps through the prismatic abyss, burning through its dimensional fabrics
Melting away the molecular barrier
The vortex between two worlds enveloped within opposite traction

Gravitational forces breached through a tear in reality
As I'm pulled towards this anomaly, leaking plasmatic impurity
Thrown unto the depths of the physical dimension
Followed by the essence of my brethren, involuntarily stolen

I wake to the sound of cries and my sacrifice shining upon my soulless eyes
The sight of my brethren traumatized, as the vortex is oxidized
Creation suspended within a glow, as above so below

Within the physical realm we tread
Banished from the prismatic abyss
The price of mortality must be met
Initiate descendant manifest
