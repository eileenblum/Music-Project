Subservient to the nexus
I am soulless redefined
I am night, absent light
The soulless acolyte
Isolated for eternity

The nocturnal obscurity
Infused with shame
Bear witness to my eternity
Forever ingrained unto this plane
Dimensionality surrounds me
I am now a slave to reality
The reptilian overlord surveying humanity

Humans rape all life indifferent to their kind

The key, the key
To unravelling
Exists within my being
I release the demons unto this plane
To remove the footprints of humanity

Time stands still as the gate invokes
The process of opening the rift world
Time stands still as the gate invokes
Wardens of crystallized flesh

Humans rape all life

Creatures of savage design
Sterilizing habitats while they laugh with pessimism
My creation has imprisoned me
For immortal eternity

Humans rape all life indifferent to their kind
