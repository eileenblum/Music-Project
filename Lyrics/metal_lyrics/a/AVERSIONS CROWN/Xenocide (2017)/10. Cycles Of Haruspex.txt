Creeping, crawling, slowly devolving
We are devoid
We are non-being
Cast from Erebus
Condemned to cycles of virulence

Creeping, crawling, slowly devolving
We are devoid
We are non-being
Wandering through the absence of light
Torn apart and victimized

We are bound to the omens of this afterlife
Welcome to the depths of oblivion
Mortified by the souls we have sacrificed
It is time for our souls to pay the price
We are bound to the omens of this afterlife
Immersed in the depths of oblivion
Crucified by the souls we have sacrificed
Sent to death, reanimated, ritualized

Behold the crucible of opposition
Contrary yet interconnected
The resting place of ethereal bodies
Shadow, is this not what you wanted?

We are forever entwined
Powerless and futile
Surpassing surveyor realms
Centered within what we know as hell

Creeping, crawling, slowly devolving
We are devoid
We are non-being
Bring forth the Haruspex
Send us unto the depths

Creeping, crawling, slowly devolving
We are devoid
We are non-being
Feel the presence fade away
Drifting into ineffectual graves

Doomed to repeat these cycles
Of this torturous afterlife
Dwelling within the darkness
Looking for light
Looking for something

We are forever entwined
Powerless and futile
Surpassing surveyor realms
Centered within what we know as hell
Nothing will ever bring us back
We've ventured into the abyss
Chained together, father and son
Slithering through otherworldly sludge

Darkness shall devour
Our presence, our being
We have fallen, we are tainted
We are once again united

Crawl with me son unto atonement
Accept the mistakes we made
Punishment patiently awaits
