No silence will be found here, only vengeance overwhelming
Honesty as hollow as the foundations of our past
The strain to breathe, more than you can bear
Animosity suffocates your lungs

Wading through the bodies, seeking refuge from this rain
Can you rise to your feet? Can you bear the weight of this failure?
I'm prepared for what's to come
This is what I want, This is who I am now
The whole truth proved more constricting
Condemned and force-fed all these years, controlled
Breaking free of this corruption, reveal your true face

Compassion, another Virtue of a crippled existence
Lungs collapsing as you cling to that final breath
The enslavement Of my future belief, compounded by the falsehood
You traded me for fulfillment, will you trade your death for forgiveness?

No silence will be found here, only vengeance overwhelming
Honesty as hollow as the foundations of our past
The strain to breathe, more than you can bear
Animosity suffocates your lungs

This is where you fall; you kneel and beg for salvation
where, you fall, you kneel, and beg for salvation
