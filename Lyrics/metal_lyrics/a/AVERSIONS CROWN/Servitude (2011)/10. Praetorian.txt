Exalted, their commanding body addresses our governments
âWE ARE LEGION, NO BEGINNING, NO END.â
There is no justification or evident reasoning
Behind the genocide of your species
There is no remorse

Total fucking decimation of our cities is inevitable, as we're wiped from the earth
The unknown technology renders our computer systems completely redundant
And our skies without the light of the sun
Returning to their archaic holy ground, rapidly reactivating a network of defense systems
Separating and colonizing us within hours, effortless and relentlessly
Their numbers blacken the sky of our world
The reality of total world domination is descending upon us
And so fast, the entourage, delegated to destabilize and seize our population centers
Hopelessly we cling to these moments

There is no justification or evident reasoning
Behind the genocide of our species
There is no remorse
Total fucking decimation of our cities is inevitable, as we're wiped from the Earth
The unknown technology renders our computer systems completely redundant
And our skies without the light of the sun
