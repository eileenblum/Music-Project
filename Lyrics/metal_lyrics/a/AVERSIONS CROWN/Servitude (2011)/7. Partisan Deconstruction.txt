Dismemberment of collective cohesion, the vital organs of this machine
exposed and subject to torment, exposed and leaderless we deconstruct
Prophecies washed then rebuilt, spill from your dreams
Putrid fucking vermin, decay the weakest resolve
Destroyed all resolve, this is your last breath
Deconstruction in the service of the venerated overlord
Your frail body twisted and redesigned
The downfall bringing the birth of the New World
Society's infrastructure crushed and pulled the fuck apart
I'm burning every fucking bridge

The crown from your head forever buried in the sands
Marvel at the creation of this instrument of torment
Born and sculpted from the upheaval of a dying existence
You're drowning in the mess you have made for yourself
The final paradise of man's collective enslavement
Entombed at the bottom of this wasteland
The final paradise of man's collective enslavement

Dismemberment of our collective cohesion, the vital organ of this machine
Exposed and subject to torment, exposed and leaderless we deconstruct
Inch by inch it will claim you, day by day dissolve your strength
You've dug this grave, you've dug this fucking grave
Welcome to our wasteland
