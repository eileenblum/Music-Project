Legions of soulless bodies roaming aimlessly
Blood-soaked and coughing disease
Death is the only escape from this plague, death is the only exit
Death is the only escape from this plague, death is the only answer

We're not safe, we're not fucking safe
But even when this death grips lifeless vessels
Swarming plagues reign great pestilence

What have we done to deserve a wrath so unforgiving?
Fuck, what have we done to deserve a wrath so ruthless?
Bane my savior, join me on this hour, give me the strength you behold
Presaging the baneful storm, compassion and mercy they do not know
We're not safe
