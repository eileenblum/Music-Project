Sentinel of our last exile, guide our hands and behold
This final paradise, belay our sacrifice
Charlatans of faith and mercy, your god is but a vessel
A tool of malice and enslavement
This is the pulse of the awakened
A singular consciousness to control, manipulate and deceive
Incorruptible and exact in its execution
Can you feel the pulse of the awakening?
Advocator of man's genocide I bow to thee, reprogrammed
You choose your own demise
