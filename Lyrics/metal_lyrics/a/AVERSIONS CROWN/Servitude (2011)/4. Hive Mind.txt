Searing vengeful genocide planted in this system
This structure flawless and proficient
Beneath the subsurface of this metropolis
Waits the harbinger of this false perfection
False perfection

You will never be free of this anguish
And the failure of your race will come slowly
A collective pain washes over the species
And so begins the harvest

Transfixed in torment and endless suffering
The resistance spread so thin and overwhelmed
Leaving literally nothing to stop the possession of the entire world
From the skies they spill forth, from the skies they spill forth
Advancing and calculating your every thought
Technology of an unimaginable beauty
Swiftly exacting and exploiting every weakness
Every fucking weakness

Searing vengeful creation planted in this system
Disgusting, flawless and proficient
Beneath the subsurface of this metropolis
Waits the harbinger of your downfall
Advancing and calculating your every thought
Swiftly exacting and exploiting, every weakness
Humankind's last stand is mortifying, mortifying
There will be no fucking resistance

Transfixed in torment and endless suffering
The resistance spread so thin and overwhelmed
