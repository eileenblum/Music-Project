Descending from the clouds, your repulsive beast awakes
Shall we never blossom, with his design
The being he creates so redundant in my eyes
Eliminate my sins, forever I carry the burden

Recreating an image
Exposing your progeny's fucking flaws
To recreate a being so perfect in my eyes

Imperfect design in need of these changes
Imperfect design I carry this burden

Recreating from the mangled bodies
Recreating I carry this burden

Exposing your progeny's fucking flaws

Descending from the clouds, your repulsive beast awaits
Shall we never blossom with his design?
