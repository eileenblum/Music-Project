Looking up, to the sky, for a sign,
In retrospect, all visions failed, time after time.
Behind the mask, inside the mind, another martyr crucified.
Walls of endless mystery, in the labyrinth, of real life's fantasies.

Fight fire with fire!
And magic will resurrect,
The sacred desire, eternally.

Frozen hearts, in a house of cards,
A game of pale illusions.
Lonely souls, left out in the cold,
Salvation feeding flames of retribution.

Moving on, towards the end, of the line,
Unholy creatures, kneeling by, the liquid shrine.
White visionaries, die one by one, another lost prodigal son.
Miles of endless misery, on the highway, for tomorrow's broken dream

Fight fire with fire!
And magic will resurrect,
The sacred desire, eternally.

Frozen hearts, in a house of cards,
A game of pale illusions.
Lonely souls, left out in the cold,
Salvation feeding flames...

Frozen hearts, in a house of cards,
A game of pale illusions.
Lonely souls, left out in the cold,
Salvation feeding flames of retribution.

[Solo]

Frozen hearts, in a house of cards,
A game of pale illusions.
Lonely souls, left out in the cold,
Salvation feeding flames...

Frozen hearts, in a house of cards,
A game of pale illusions.
Lonely souls, left out in the cold,
Salvation feeding flames of retribution.

Frozen hearts [Repeat 'til fade]
