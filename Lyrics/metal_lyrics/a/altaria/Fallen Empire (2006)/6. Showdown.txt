Another shade of grey,
And the one I hate.
Another pain faced man,
Lost in the dream land.

Another spiteful soul,
Seeks, destroys.
Another two faced man,
Embracing the last straws.

A figure in black is standing there,
On the edge of sanity.
Holding onto the dawn of creation,
While the world is ruled by greed.

Emeralds fall, like rain from the sky,
The free fight for freedom,
While a forgotten angel cries.

Showdown, victims of fate,
Soldiers in agony still asking "Why?".
Spell bound, under the blade,
Hatred of lordship reflected by innocent eyes.

Another fading flame,
In a private hell,
Another desperate man,
Leaving his dark cell.

A creature of war is standing there,
On the burning battle field,
Holding onto the glory of nations,
While the heart strives to break free.

Emeralds fall, like rain from the sky,
The free fight for freedom,
While a forgotten angel cries.

Showdown, victims of fate,
Soldiers in agony still asking "Why?".
Spell bound, under the blade,
Hatred of lordship reflected by innocent eyes.

[Solo]

Showdown, victims of fate,
Soldiers in agony still asking "Why?".
Spell bound, under the blade,
Hatred of lordship reflected by innocent.

Showdown, victims of fate,
Soldiers in agony still asking "Why?".
Spell bound, under the blade,
Hatred of lordship reflected by innocent eyes.

Showdown.
