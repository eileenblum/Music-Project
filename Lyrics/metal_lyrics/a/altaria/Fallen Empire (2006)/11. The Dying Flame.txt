[European Bonus]

I'm like an angel with broken wings,
Someday I'll fly,
But tonight I keep spinning around,
In a circle.

And as the old, I am lost in time,
The years go by,
And somehow I keep holding on,
To this burden.

Sunlight in my eyes, daggers in my head,
Tomorrow I will shake this feeling,
Bullet in the brain,
The world has gone insane,
We're all waiting for some healing.

I still know that you and I,
Were meant to walk the path alive,
Side-by-side,
Towards the order of our days.

But first I need to figure out,
The source that brings me darkened skies,
Grab the bull right by the horns, release the hate,
So my thoughts are running wild.

The falling tears of a child,
Turns the eyes in the light,
Don't let fear control the action,
Just like in... [?] it seems,
In the game no one wins,
The dying flame brings a chain reaction.

Chain, chain, chain reaction.
Control, control, control the action.
Chain, chain, chain reaction.

Children raised on lies,
Controlled by selfish threats,
Time to leave this place behind me.

Nothing there to find,
No where left to hide,
Will there be a happy ending?

Walking lone through desert plains,
Waiting desperately for rain,
To come and wash away,
The sins of days gone by.

Suddenly, I see your face,
Before me in the blurry haze,
Without warning I just know we'll be alright,
Though my thoughts are running wild.

The falling tears of a child,
Turns the eyes in the light,
Don't let fear control the action,
Just like in... [?] it seems,
In the game no one wins,
The dying flame brings a chain reaction.

Warhead lost in the dark,
With a cold, beating heart,
Don't let fear control the action,
And as the story unfolds,
All the dark whispers call,
The dying flame brings a chain reaction.

Chain, chain, chain reaction.
Control, control, control the action.

[Spoken:]
Journey through the wasteland,
Where misery, is glory,
Warriors keep fists held high,
For the empire, of the fallen.

Warhead lost in the dark,

Don't let fear control the action,
And as the story unfolds,
All the dark... [?],
The dying flame brings a chain reaction.

Don't let fear control the action,
The dying flame brings a chain reaction,
Don't let fear control the action,
The dying flame brings a chain reaction.

[Whispered:]
The dying flame.
The dying flame.
