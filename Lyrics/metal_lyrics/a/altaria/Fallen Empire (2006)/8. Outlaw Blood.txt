Gazing out, through the bars of your window,
At the world that's passing you by.
You used to be, the one with all the answers,
And now, you're the mighty king of fools.

You had the crowd inside you hand,
You lead them to the promised land.
But it was only a matter of time,
Until they saw your wicked ways.
Confrontation face to face,
Demanding answers and no more lies.

Just a thief in the night,
Soldier without a fight.
In the shadows you stand, ready.

Outlaw blood.
Boiling in your veins, outlaw blood.
Strike without a warning, outlaw blood.

Outnumbered, you lay down your arms,
Stranger hiding in the dark,
Soon you were back on the streets again.

And when it all came to an end,
Big tears of shame ran down your face.
From above, you fell into hell.

Dreams of fortune and fame,
You played and lost your own game.
Through the flames you will walk, crying:

Outlaw blood.
Boiling in your veins, outlaw blood.
Strike without a warning, outlaw blood.
To you it's just a game, outlaw blood.
Misery is calling, outlaw blood.

[Solo]

Outlaw blood.
Boiling in your veins, outlaw blood.
Strike without a warning, outlaw blood.
To you it's just a game, outlaw blood.
Misery is calling, outlaw blood.
