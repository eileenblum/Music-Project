When we reach our destination,
Time has come for us to rule.
Like the place below the surface,
We will de-throne all the fools.

As we sail towards horizons,
With blood upon our hands.
Taking on the stormy waters,
Building castles in the sand.

Running away with the winds of change,
And fears of childhood years.

Storm warning,
On the ocean of the free.
I'm falling,
In the abyss of twilight, stars are incomplete.

On a glorious arrival,
We will rise and conquer, then,
Our quest will be victorious,
As we fight until the end.

When the lightening strikes the tower,
And the clouds, they promise rain.
Our future comes before us,
And all we see is pain.

Running away with the winds of change,
And fears of childhood years.

Storm warning,
On the ocean of the free.
I'm falling,
In the abyss of twilight, destiny!
Storm warning,
In the abyss of twilight, stars are incomplete.

[Solo]

When we reach our destination,
Time has come to say goodbye,
To the Gods and the immortals,
While the fire burns inside.

Running away with the winds of change,
And fears of childhood years.

Storm warning,
On the ocean of the free.
I'm falling,
In the abyss of twilight, destiny!

Storm warning,
On the ocean of the free.
I'm falling,
In the abyss of twilight, stars are incomplete.
