These landscapes of beauty,
Hold more than meets the eye.
Darkness comes early,
And the night controls the mind.

Look into the future,
Gaze into the crystal ball.
Release all your sorrows,
Let the new beginning dawn.

I've been waiting for you,
Down by the shoreline.
Towards the shadows we walk,
Without fear in our hearts.

Can you feel the hunger, of the chosen one?
Growing stronger, out on the run,
Chosen one.

The snow keeps falling,
In a cold and darkened world,
And no sight of daylight,
Makes the place on Earth feel cursed.

Get out of your nightmare,
Find a reason to go on.
Just wait for tomorrow,
You see a new beginning dawn.

I've been searching for you,
Over the rainbow.
Up from the ashes we rise,
Just to face a better day.

Can you feel the hunger, of the chosen one?
Growing stronger, out on the run.

Can you feel the power, of the chosen one?
Take you higher, touch the sun.

[Solo]

Can you feel the power, of the chosen one?
Take you higher, touch the sun.

Can you feel the hunger, of the chosen one?
Growing stronger, out on the run.
Chosen one!
