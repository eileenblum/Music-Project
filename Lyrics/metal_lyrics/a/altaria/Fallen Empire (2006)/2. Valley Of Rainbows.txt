Fallen angel, out of danger give me a sign,
When the holy nation finds the ancient wisdom,
And eternal peace of mind.

Night after night, it's all the same,
Fear returning again from yesterday,
Like a stranger I'll roam the streets alone,
Waiting for justice where heads will roll.

Manipulation, manipulation of lies,
Annihilation, some how in the face of mankind.

I feel the sun in my eyes,
Pulling my head high 'cause I got so far,
When all injustice is torn apart.

Fallen angel, out of danger give me a sign,
When the holy nation finds the ancient wisdom,
And eternal peace of mind,
In the valley of rainbows, in the valley of rainbows.

Day after day I look for truth,
Reasons for hatred and wasted youth,
Like a gambler I'm walking off in nights.

Time has come for me to make things right,
Forever and ever, forever and reach for the sky,
Never say never, leave the body preachers behind.

I feel the sun in my eyes,
Pulling my head high 'cause I got so far,
When all injustice is torn apart.

Fallen angel, out of danger give me a sign,
When the holy nation finds the ancient wisdom,
And eternal peace of mind,

Fallen angel, out of danger, kill all* on the run,
When the holy nation finds the ancient wisdom,
Tell me I'm the wanted one,
In the valley of rainbows, in the valley of rainbows.
In the valley of rainbows, in the valley of rainbows.

[Solo]

Fallen angel, out of danger give me a sign.
[Music stops then begins again]
Fallen angel, out of danger give me a sign,
When the holy nation finds the ancient wisdom,
And eternal peace of mind,

Fallen angel, out of danger, kill all* on the run,
When the holy nation finds the ancient wisdom,
Tell me I'm the wanted one,
In the valley of rainbows, in the valley of rainbows.
In the valley of rainbows, in the valley of rainbows.

[Music stops]
In the valley of rainbows.
