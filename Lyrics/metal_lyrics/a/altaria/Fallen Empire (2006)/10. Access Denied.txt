The painting on the wall used to be my portrait,
But now it seems I've been replaced,
All doors are locked around me,
There's no way in or out,
Times, they changed, love turned to hate.

Yesterday, I walk through the halls of power,
My head held high, proud as a king.

This once was my temple,
A vision that came true,
And I had wind beneath my wings.

Mighty mean in suits create the future,
With dotted signs on their twisted minds,
This time their was no part in it for me.

I hear tomorrow screaming my name,
And the call is heard all around the world,
I guess I was just far too blind to see.

So when the curtain falls,
There is no seat saved,
For the broken hero.

Access, access denied,
To the fortress of my heart,
Access, access denied.

Youth has past me by,
And I was a just a puppet,
Controlled by masters without soul.
Mr. Know-It-Alls got the better of me,
Next time I won't take the fall.

Like a homeless child, I walk through alleys,
And I still can't find any peace of mind,
So hard to recall if I felt it before.

When I grab my pillow, made of granite,
Thinking back a while to the restless times,
My mind's made up, I will strike back by dawn.

But when the crowds are gone,
There is no one there for the fallen hero.

Access, access denied,
To the fortress of my heart,
Access, access denied.

Access, access denied,
To the kingdom of the Gods,
Access, access denied.

I've been thrown to the dogs,
The one's just picking on my bones,
With my voice still loud and clear,
Some day I will return once more.

[Solo]

Access, access denied,
To the fortress of my heart,
Access, access denied.

Access, access denied,
To the kingdom of the Gods,
Access, access denied.

The painting on the wall, used to my portrait,
And now I know I've been replaced.
