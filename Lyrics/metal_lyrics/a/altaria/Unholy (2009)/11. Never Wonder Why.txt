Feel the fire in forbidden places.
Feel the hate that you hold inside.
See the madness of crumbling ages,
When the time has come to rise.

You can't have it all.
Freedom and security.
You head to the dawn,
To be set free.

[Chorus]
Life is tough,
Life great,
Life is full,
Of love and hate.

Take a ride, to the sky.
Don't you ever wonder why,
Life is bright, as a flame.
In the shadows.

Face to face.
See the signs,
In my eyes,
And never wonder why.

Running wild at the heart of chaos,
Reach tomorrow without a scar.
Living life, in a web of fortune.
Wish upon a falling star.

That the lonely can face a new day,
Without fear when the cold winds blow.
In a world where it all is perfect,
But no one will ever know.

You can't have it all,
Madness and eternity.
You head for the dawn,
Your destiny.

[Chorus]
Life is tough,
Life great,
Life is full,
Of love and hate.

Take a ride, to the sky.
Don't you ever wonder why,
Life is bright, as a flame,
In the shadows.

Face to face.
See the signs,
In my eyes,
And never wonder why.

[Solo]

Hysteria will spread across the nation.
Like a disease of main intoxication.
Your voice is heard,
But there is nothing left to say.

[Chorus]
Life is tough,
Life great,
Life is full,
Of love and hate.

Take a ride, to the sky.
Don't you ever wonder why,
Life is bright, as a flame,
In the shadows.

Face to face.
See the signs,
In my eyes,
And never wonder why.

Life is tough,
Life great,
Life is full,
Of love and hate.

Take a ride, to the sky.
Don't you ever wonder why,
Life is bright, as a flame,
In the shadows.

Face to face.
See the signs,
In my eyes,
And never wonder why
