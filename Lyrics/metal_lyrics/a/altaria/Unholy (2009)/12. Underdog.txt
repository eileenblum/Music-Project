In the underworld I've ruled,
Unable to find inner peace.
Reflecting over futuristic visions,
Just like memories.

Now I have the courage too,
Stand up and set my spirit free.
Walk alone the silver line,
Where legends meet their destiny.

By my sword, I'll never bleed,
Bravely play the dead man's hand.
There's no faith, but what we make.
If you believe that, you will stand...

[Chorus]
Stronger than ever.
Challenge the gods.
I'll fight forever.
Beating all odds.

Raise your hands for the underdog,
The throne belongs to the chosen one.
Prepare yourself for a future shock,
The revolution has begun.

Heed the call, and spread the word.
Face your fear and don't run away.
Beneath the ground an unknown force,
Is growing stronger day by day.

Time has come for me to rise,
With the crowd of ancient kings.
By the moment I will live,
Not knowing what tomorrow brings.

[Chorus]
Stronger than ever.
Challenge the gods.
I'll fight forever.
Beating all odds.

Raise your hands for the underdog,
The throne belongs to the chosen one.
Prepare yourself for a future shock,
The revolution has begun.

[Solo]

Raise your hands for the underdog,
The throne belongs to the chosen one.
Prepare yourself for a future shock,
The revolution has begun.

Raise your hands for the underdog,
The throne belongs to the chosen one.
Prepare yourself for a future shock,
The revolution has begun.

Home is where the heart is.
That I am quite sure by now.
Nothing's ever granted,
But you only reap the seed you sow.
