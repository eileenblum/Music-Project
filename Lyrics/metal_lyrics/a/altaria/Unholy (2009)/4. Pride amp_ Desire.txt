We walk towards the fire,
And souls will feel the flames,
We are heading for the twilight.
Ready or not!

Our children find the future,
And the traitors go insane.
We are heading for the lime light,
Ready or not!

[Chorus]
We've come a long way,
And nothing's what it seems,
But still,
We hold onto the dream.

With pride and desire,
Our sacred destiny.
Eternal fire,
Burning for the guardians of steel.

Took a while before we realised,
Everything was just a game,
Now we're heading for the night time,
Ready or not!

[Chorus]
We've come a long way,
And this is how it feels.
Our nation,
Will never grow weak.

With pride and desire,
Our sacred destiny.
Eternal fire,
Raging for the steel.

Pride and desire,
In perfect harmony.
Eternal fire,
Burning for the guardians of steel.

[Solo]

[Chorus]
We've come a long way,
And this is how it feels,
Our nation will never grow weak.

With pride and desire,
Our sacred destiny.
Eternal fire,
Raging for the steel.

Pride and desire,
In perfect harmony.
Eternal fire,
Burning for the guardians of steel.

With pride!
And desire!
Yeah!
Yeah yeah!
