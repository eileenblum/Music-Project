Loud guitars break the silence.
It's time again,
To set the night on fire.
We'll turn you upside down.

[Chorus]
Ready, get ready.
We will dominate,
And take it all.
My set of rock and roll.

Ready, get ready.
We will dominate,
And shake your soul.
Prepare for rock and roll.

Burning hearts,
Feel the power, ride the sky.
When lightning strikes the tower.
We'll turn you inside out.

[Chorus]
Ready, get ready.
We will dominate,
And take it all.
My set of rock and roll.

Ready, get ready.
We will dominate,
And shake your soul.
Prepare for rock and roll.

[Solo]

Hear the call,
Of the only night sensation.
(Night sensation)
We'll spin your head around.

[Chorus]
Ready, get ready.
We will dominate,
And take it all.
My set of rock and roll.

Ready, get ready.
We will dominate,
And shake your soul.
Prepare for rock and roll.

Ready, get ready.
We will dominate,
And take it all.
My set of rock and roll.

Ready, get ready.
We will dominate,
And shake your soul.
Prepare for rock and roll!
