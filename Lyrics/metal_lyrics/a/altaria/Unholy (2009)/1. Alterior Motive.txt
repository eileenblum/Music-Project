Between the truth and what we know.
A force is trying to make us blind, yeah.
Dreaming 'bout power and control,
Manipulating all mankind.

Behind the curtains stand the kings,
Cursed by the oath they swore.

[Chorus]
Alterior motive,
The words we never speak,
The names of traitors,
Carved into our spines.

Alterior motive,
Eternally, we seek,
For answers,
From the same corrupted minds.

Children brought into this world,
Are guided by the books of light, yeah.
A future mapped out in advance,
Using freedom as disguise.

Behind the curtains stand the gods,
Prepare for the final call.

[Chorus]
Alterior motive,
The words we never speak,
The names of traitors,
Carved into our spines.

Alterior motive,
Eternally, we seek,
For answers,
From the same corrupted minds.

Corrupted minds, yeah.

[Solo]

Alterior! Motive!
Alterior! Motive!
Alterior! Motive!
Alterior! Motive!

[Chorus]
Alterior motive,
The words we never speak,
The names of traitors,
Carved into our spines.

Alterior motive,
Eternally, we seek,
For answers,
From the same corrupted minds.

Alterior motive,
The words we never speak,
The names of traitors,
Carved into our spines.

Alterior motive,
Eternally, we seek,
For answers,
From the same corrupted minds.

Corrupted minds!
