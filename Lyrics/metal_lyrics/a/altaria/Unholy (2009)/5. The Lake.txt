La, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

The trees are whispering,
I hear them calling for me.
Is this a nightmare,
Or reality?

Oh, I wanna go home,
This is more than I can take.

We hold each other's hand,
We know we won't survive,
This haunted place,
Won't just let us get out alive.

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna go home,
We never should have come to the lake.

Can you feel,
Death's dark embrace?
In the water,
Shines a pale white face.

When you go down,
You'll never come back up again, no, no.

The children were buried,
In this cold, black grave.
Too young to be forgotten,
To dead to be saved.

In the silent night,
I feel that evil is awake.

This night will be my last,
I now know it for sure.
Hope is lost,
I've never felt this way before.

Oh, I wanna go home,
This is more than I can take.

I scream out for my mum,
But she's not here for me,
These twisted spirits,
Lead me to insanity.

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna go home,
We never should have come to the lake.

Can you feel,
Death's dark embrace?
In the water,
Shines a pale white face.

When you go down,
You'll never come back up again, yeah, yeah.

The children were buried,
In this cold, black grave.
Too young to be forgotten,
To dead to be saved.

In the silent night,
I feel that evil is awake, yeah.

There's something hiding,
In the woods I know,
It's coming closer,
As the wild winds blow.

Please don't let me,
Drown here, in this lake.

[Solo]

Deep beneath the surface,
Gather the stolen souls.
Restless shadows,
From the beds.

I'm drawn towards the water,
Fear has abandoned me.
As I'm invited,
Too their mass.

The children were buried,
In this cold, black grave.
The children were buried,
In this cold, black grave.

Too young to be forgotten,
To dead to be saved.
In the silent night,
I feel that evil is awake, yeah.

There's something hiding,
In the woods I know,
It's coming closer,
As the wild winds blow.

Please don't let me,
Drown here, in this lake, again.
Please don't let me,
Drown here, in this lake.

Don't let me drown here,
In this lake.

(Whoa, whoa, whoa!)
Yeah! Don't let me drown here,
In this lake!
