The world has gone crazy,
The twilight conquer our visions and dreams.
We just have to face it, our sacred illusions have brought misery.
Day by day, I see, my paradise in flames.

[Chorus]
Walking in the dead of night,
Eternally it seems.
I've been taken prisoner,
And I'm striving to break free.

Surrounded by the darkness,
I am longing for the sun.
When will my time come,
To feel the wind beneath my wings?

The dawn of a new day,
Will come,
Though the sunlight,
Has been led astray.

All resources wasted,
With vanity guided by fortune and fame.
Every night, I'm crying,
I realise it's all the same.

[Chorus]
Walking in the dead of night,
Eternally it seems.
I've been taken prisoner,
And I'm striving to break free.

Surrounded by the darkness,
I am longing for the sun.
When will my time come,
To feel the wind beneath my wings?

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Walking in the dead of night,
Eternally it seems.
I've been taken prisoner,
And I'm striving to break free.

Surrounded by the darkness,
I am longing for the sun.
When will my time come,
To feel the wind beneath my wings?

Walking in the dead of night,
Eternally it seems.
I've been taken prisoner,
And I'm striving to break free.

Surrounded by the darkness,
I am longing for the sun.
When will my time come,
To feel the wind beneath my wings?
