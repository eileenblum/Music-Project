Back at the place where it all begun.
I don't expect you to understand my calling.

It's crystal clear, now I'm running free.
I used to stand by your side just to see you falling.

Down into, a bottomless pit.

[Chorus]
Clowns of the circus are standing by,
To collect the glory of nations.

Running around in a circle, telling lie after lie.
To protect the unholy invasion.

My mind's made up, I will face my fears.
Betrayal's present, but no one hears my warning.

So feel the love, into this kiss.

[Chorus]
Clowns of the circus are standing by,
To collect the glory of nations.

Running around in a circle, telling lie after lie.
To protect the unholy invasion.

To protect the unholy invasion!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Clowns of the circus are standing by,
To collect the glory of nations.

Running around in a circle, telling lie after lie.
To protect the unholy invasion.

Clowns of the circus are standing by,
To collect the glory of nations.

Running around in a circle, telling lie after lie.
To protect the unholy invasion.

(Clowns of the circus)
[Repeat until fade]
