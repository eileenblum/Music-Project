Taking off the broken wings,
The sands of time are running low.
Leaving all the fears behind,
It's ready, set and go.

[Chorus]
Screams of anger are slowly fading away.
Mighty voices calling, time and time again.

I'm gonna steal your thunder.
(Steal your thunder!)
Things will never be the same,
When I steal your thunder.
(Steal your thunder!)
From the cradle, to the grave.

Kings have fallen,
Empires will claim the throne this time.
The visions of the crystal ball,
Guiding creatures of the night.

[Chorus]
Screams of anger are slowly fading away.
Mighty voices calling, time and time again.

I'm gonna steal your thunder.
(Steal your thunder!)
Things will never be the same,
When I steal your thunder.
(Steal your thunder!)
From the cradle, to the grave.

[Solo]

Taking off the broken wings,
New stars adores the skies.
The visions of the crystal ball,
Guiding creatures of the night.

I'm gonna steal your thunder, yeah.
Things will never be the same,
When I steal your thunder.
From the cradle, to the grave.

I'm gonna steal your thunder.
(Steal your thunder!)
Things will never be the same,
When I steal your thunder.
(Steal your thunder!)
From the cradle, to the grave.

I'm gonna steal your thunder.
(Steal your thunder!)
Things will never be the same,
When I steal your thunder.
(Steal your thunder!)
From the cradle, to the grave.
