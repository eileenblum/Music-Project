Walking a thin line,
Between having it all,
And taking a fall.

Remember yesterday?
A future so bright,
A shooting star.

Now I'm ready to face,
New beginnings.

[Chorus]
Take me to the danger zone.
Like a war lord, addicted to power.

I will rise and conquer it.
Legions far away from home.

The beauty of sorrow,
Is part of the game,
The pleasure and pain.

Beyond the icy core,
A river of tears,
A bleeding heart.

Time has come to collect,
All my winnings.

[Chorus]
Take me to the danger zone.
Like a war lord, addicted to power.

I will rise and conquer it.
Legions far away from home.

Take me to the danger zone.
I have travelled through lightning and thunder.

See the footprints in the sand.
Legions far away from home.

Take me to, take me to, take me to.
Take me to, take me to, take me to.
Take me to, take me to, take me to.
Take me to, take me to, take me to.
The danger zone!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Take me to the danger zone.
Like a war lord, addicted to power.

I will rise and conquer it.
Legions far away from home.

Take me to the danger zone.
I have travelled through lightning and thunder.

See the footprints in the sand.
Legions far away from home.
