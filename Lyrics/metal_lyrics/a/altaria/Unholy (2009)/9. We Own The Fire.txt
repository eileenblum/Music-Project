We are the night, the wicked few,
Thieves, whores and liars.
We all take pride in what we do.
Sin for desire.

Can't turn this back from us,
Therefore we are free (therefore we are free)
Our souls have died,
Now we're tormented in eternity.

[Chorus]
We own the fire.
When darkness falls, we set the world in flames.
Unholy choir.
Hell on earth will be a testament of rage.

Our eyes are blind,
Our voices cold.
Hearts filled with fury,
Innocent blood has stained our souls.

All dreams are buried.
We set the demons out to steal your hope away (steal your hope away)
Our frozen shadows fall across the land.
Now hear us say:

[Chorus]
We own the fire.
When darkness falls, we set the world in flames.
Unholy choir.
Hell on earth will be a testament of rage.

World in flames.
Testament of rage.

[Solo]

We set the demons out to steal your hope away (steal your hope away)
Our frozen shadows fall across the land.
Now hear us say:

[Chorus]
We own the fire.
When darkness falls, we set the world in flames.
Unholy choir.
Hell on earth will be a testament of rage.

We own the fire.
When darkness falls, we set the world in flames.
Unholy choir.
Hell on earth will be a testament of rage.
