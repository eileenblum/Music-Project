Bring the skeletons out of the closet,
And the warrior into the light.
As the new day will dawn,
For the ones who stand tall.

The smell of combat fills the air,
No retreat for the unholy forces.
In a world where two wrongs make a right.
When the creatures of war re-appear for us all,

The souls so black will face the fear.
Into the future, I see the signs,
Into the future, time after time.
We're calling out for a...

[Chorus]
Warrior, you cheated destiny,
Now you're running free.
Warrior, I hear you calling me,
From the battle field, Warrior!

Bring the skeletons out of the closet,
And the warrior into the sun.
Now the darkness will fall,
And the legend is born, beyond the octagon of light.

Like lambs being sent to the slaughter,
Elimination of truth has begun.
Hear the answers just call,
And the empires fall,

Into the shadows of the night.
Into the future, I see the signs,
Into the future, time after time.
We're calling out for a...

[Chorus]
Warrior, you cheated destiny,
Now you're running free.
Warrior, I hear you calling me,
From the battle field.

Warrior, you cheated destiny,
Always running free.
Warrior, I hear you calling me,
To the battle field, yeah.

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Warrior, you cheated destiny,
Now you're running free.
Warrior, I hear you calling me,
From the battle field.

Warrior, you cheated destiny,
Always running free.
Warrior, I hear you calling me,
To the battle field.

Warrior! Warrior!
