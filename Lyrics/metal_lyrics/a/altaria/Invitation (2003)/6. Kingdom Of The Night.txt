I'm closing the door behind me
With an image of you before my eyes
Taking the road to nowhere
Heading for distant neon lights

I'm leaving the lies behind me
Now that my broken wings are healed
Returning with signs of danger
Fighting for pride and glory

Yesterday's gone
Miles dividing
So many years have passed my friend
The road back home remains

In the kingdom of the night

I'm racing the streets of freedom
In a world where power rules the mind
Invading the heart of millions
Building a brave new nation

The roses have thorns
Like eyes of fire
So many tears we cried my friend
The dreams of youth remain
