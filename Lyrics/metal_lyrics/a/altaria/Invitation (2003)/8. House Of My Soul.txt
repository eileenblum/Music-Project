As we stop one moment
To think about our lives
The melody keeps changing
But the song remains the same

What's our destination
What are we heading for
Actions of tomorrow
Depend on yesterday

In the house of my soul
I feel a fire burning
In the heart of the young
The road to freedom's turning

As the storm keeps raging
In a distant world
I hear the violent thunder
But still escape the rain

I feel a fire burning - in the house of my soul
I feel a fire burning - in the house of my soul
