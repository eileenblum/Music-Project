Remember that what you give is,
Is what you get returned.
And the ancient legend,
Repeats itself once more.

More and more you want,
Nothing else will do.
And the fairytales,
Goes on and on and on.

[Chorus:]
We will haunt you forever,
We will find you wherever,
Wherever you may go.
The gates of hell call all the pagans,
Chosen by the universe.
With power of a rising legion,
Fronted by the unicorn.

One last lime - eye to eye.

Disciples and lonely hearts,
They roam the city streets.
While soldiers fall,
In battles faraway.

Wait just a little while,
The walls come tumbling down.
A house of cards won't stand,
On shaky ground.

[Chorus]

Unbelievers fear the symbol,
Created by the universe.
And sacred thoughts manipulating,
Children of the Unicorn.

[Solo]

The gates of hell call all the pagans,
Chosen by the universe.
With power of a rising legion,
Fronted by the unicorn.

Unbelievers fear the symbol,
Created by the universe.
And sacred thoughts manipulating,
Children of the Unicorn.

One last lime - eye to eye.
