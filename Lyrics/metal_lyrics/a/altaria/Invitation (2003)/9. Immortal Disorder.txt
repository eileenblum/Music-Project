Listen up, listen to me
Hear my warning
Look around, rise and feel
Another dawning

When winds carry pieces of love

Play the game but play it safe
Stay forever
Find a way, march in pain
Through this jungle

Where winds carry pieces of love

In a dream I'm immortal
I never gave a thought for tomorrow disorder
Yesterday brought me a dark trail of sorrow

A life of chaos passes by before my eyes
While silent dreams are coming closer, look out!
An evil virus took my soul on a rainy night
Symbolic thoughts of destiny

Immortal, disorder, immortal
Feels like I'm slippin' away to a world of disorder
