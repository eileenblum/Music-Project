As the sun sets down in the west
Another sleepless night comes her way
Working late for the ruler of the street

Finding her way trough hard times
Trying to make a good life
Selling her body to strangers in the night

Emerald eye - hold on to the signs
of a distant thunder roaring in the sky

As the sun rises up in the east
Another tyrann adores his world
Diamond rings and a monument of gold

Born to take over the throne
A creature without heart
Feeding a violent legacy of lies

Emerald eye - hold on to the signs
Of a distant thunder roaring in the sky
Emerald eye - gaze into the light
Hear the distant thunder roaring across the sky
