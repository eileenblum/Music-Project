Working hard all day
To control the final dream
Side by side we walk
Towards a blinding arctic storm

I head your voice on the line
Struggling to find the words
So let me tell you something
I knew right from the beginning

There won't be a next time
No more lies

A new day's dawning
You turn and walk away
The night is falling
You turn and walk away

But when the spotlight hits the stage
The time has come to say
Here I am
Here I am

Working hard all night
As the world's forever turning
Between two fires sleeping
On the outside looking in

I hear your voice on the line
Struggling to find the words
Now let me tell you something
We agreed on from the beginning
