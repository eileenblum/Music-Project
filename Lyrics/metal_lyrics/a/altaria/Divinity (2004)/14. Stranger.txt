[Japanese bonus track]

Flash striking fears, so hard to see.
Yeah, the monsters without mind, hiding from the truth.

There's a stranger in your dreams,
Like a shadow in the night.
I'm a stranger in your dreams (Stranger, stranger)
And there's no where you can hide.

I can't get out, nowhere to go.
Nothing to fear, a heart of stone.

There's a stranger in your dreams (Stranger)
Like a shadow in the night (Shadow in the night)
I'm a stranger in your dreams,
And there's no where you can hide (Nowhere you can hide)

[Solo]

You lie awake, no sleep, no dream.
There's no escape, away from me.

Stranger in your dreams (Stranger)
Like a shadow in the night
I'm a stranger in your dreams (Stranger, stranger)
And there's no where you can hide.

There's a stranger in your dreams (Stranger)
Like a shadow in the night (Shadow in the night)
I'm a stranger in your dreams (Stranger)
And there's no where you can hide (Nowhere you can hide)

[Fading out]
There's a stranger in your dreams (Stranger)
Like a shadow in the night (Shadow in the night)
I'm a stranger in your dreams (Stranger)
And there's no where you can hide (Nowhere you can hide)
