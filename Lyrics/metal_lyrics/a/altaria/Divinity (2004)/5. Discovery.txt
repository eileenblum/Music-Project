[Pukkila / Smedjebacka / Liimatainen]

Time - never enough in my life
Chasing my tail
So scared to fail
That it's eating me up from inside

Eyes - following me all around
Watching my moves
Making me lose
All the dignity from distant skies

Climbing the stairway of steel

Discovery
There's magic inside to be found
Discovery
The power hides deep in the night

Signs - telling a story of might
All the stars in the sky
Asking me why
Did you bury yourself in the sand

Fight - through thunder and lightning again
Conquer the world
Make your voice heard
Reach out and abandon your den

Climbing the stairway of steel

Discovery
There's magic inside to be found
Discovery
The power hides deep in the night

Discovery
There's magic inside to be found
Discovery
Discover the power tonight

[solo]

Discovery
There's magic inside to be found
Discovery
The power hides deep in the night

Discovery
There's magic inside to be found
Discovery
Discover the power tonight
