[Pukkila / Smedjebacka]

Before the dawn I awake
Morning came to paradise
There beside me in peaceful sleep
A princess hiding from the night

You know they say
That nothing lasts forever
And memories will fade away

Together in perfect harmony
Forever escaping destiny
Gathering thoughts in the haven of the lost
The wilderness surrounds our souls

The taste of freedom all around
I hear the water hit the shore
The concrete jungle so far away
A peaceful soldier will return

You know they say
Some things can last forever
And memories don't fade away

Together in perfect harmony
Forever escaping destiny
An angel in perfect harmony
With a stranger escaping destiny
Gathering thoughts in the haven of the lost
The wilderness surrounds our souls

Across the sky like an eagle I spread my wings
Now my heart is finally free, so free

[solo]

Together in perfect harmony
Forever escaping destiny
An angel in perfect harmony
With a stranger escaping destiny
Gathering thoughts in the haven of the lost
The wilderness surrounds our souls
