[European bonus track]

Too many slaves in this world
One by torture and pain
Too many people do not see
They're killing themselves - going insane
Too many people do not know
Bondage in over the human race
They believe slaves always lose
And this fear keeps them down

Watch the damned (god bless ya!)
They're gonna break their chains
You can't stop them (god bless ya!)
They're coming to get you and then

You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall, balls to the wall!

You may screw their brains
You may sacrifice them, too
You may mortify their flesh
You may rape them all
One day the tortured stand up
And revolt against the evil
They make you drink you blood
And tear yourself to pieces

Watch the damned (god bless ya!)
They're gonna break their chains
You can't stop them (god bless ya!)
They're coming to get you and then

You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall, balls to the wall!

Watch the damned (god bless ya!)
They're gonna break their chains
You can't stop them (god bless ya!)
They're coming to get you and then

You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
Balls to the wall
You'll get your balls to the wall, man
