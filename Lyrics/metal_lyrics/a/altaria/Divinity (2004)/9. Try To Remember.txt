[Pukkila / Smedjebacka]

Another young and restless soul
Trapped in a world of shattered dreams
Craving for shelter to stay warm
But there's no one there for me

Chains of the past still hold me down
Though my heart wants to break free
I try to hold on to a flame
That once again will slip away

Feels like I'm drowning in tears
Drifting away with the stream
I hear them calling my name
I'm fading away

Send me down an angel
From the heavens above the earth
And I'll try to remember
How this life under dark skies used to be

Beyond the solid walls of stone
The fields of green so wide
Climbing a stairway made of stars
Leaving sorrows far behind

Feels like I'm drowning in tears
Drifting away with the stream
I hear them calling my name
I'm fading away

Send me down an angel
From the heavens above the earth
And I'll try to remember
How this life under dark skies used to be

Send me down an angel
From the heavens above the earth
And I'll try to remember
How this life under dark skies used to be

[solo]

Send me down an angel
From the heavens above the earth
And I'll try to remember
How this life under dark skies used to be
