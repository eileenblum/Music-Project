[Pukkila / Smedjebacka / Liimatainen]

I take a look into
Your tearfilled lying eyes
I see a glimpse of goodness
But the anger holds my mind

I know that you and I
We could have worked things out
But it's too late by now
We're at the point of no return

This pilot will crash and burn

Into the final warning
In the jaws of danger
On a misty morning
And I'll show no mercy
When I call out the warning of love

You've made an enemy
Of the one you used to want
And I can't turn around
To take you back into my arms

I hear your desperate cry
And I'm almost there again
But it's too late by now
'Cause it seems you never learn

This pilot will crash and burn

Into the final warning
In the jaws of danger
On a misty morning
And I'll show no mercy
When I call out the warning

It's the final dawning
When the gates are open
And the tears are falling
And I'll show no mercy
When I call out the warning of love
Warning of love

[solo]

Final warning
In the jaws of danger
On a misty morning
And I'll show no mercy
When I call out the warning

It's the final dawning
When the gates are open
And the tears are falling
Yeah I'll show no mercy
When I call out the warning of love

(Final warning)
In the jaws of danger
On a misty morning
And I'll show no mercy
When I call out the warning
It's the final dawning
