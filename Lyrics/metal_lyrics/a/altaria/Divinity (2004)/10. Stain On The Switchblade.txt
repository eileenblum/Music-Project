[Wik / Smedjebacka / Pukkila]

You wanna raise a fortune
And still be free
You wanna touch the limelight
But you can't take the heat

You look for victims
With stardust in your eyes
Hold on like a parasite
With your rehearsed lies

I hear you talking
Still I'm not listening

You're telling me stories of lost innocence
Forgetting the stain on your switchblade is red
The stain on your switchblade

Behind the mask of anger
A lonely child
Beyond the heart of darkness
Just a face in the crowd

Inside the castle
You feel you somehow count
Remember the broken hearts
Can you hear their sound

I hear you talking
Still I'm not listening

You're telling me stories of lost innocence
Forgetting the stain on your switchblade is red
You're telling me stories of lost innocence
Forgetting the stain on your switchblade is red

[solo]

You're telling me stories of lost innocence
Forgetting the stain on your switchblade is red
You're telling me stories so bent out of shape
Forgetting the stain on your switchblade is red
The stain of your switchblade
Switchblade
Switchblade
