[Pukkila / Smedjebacka / Liimatainen]

Symbols of forgotten times
Spinning around and around and around in my mind
Changes taking place inside
While the body sleeps

Methods of an ancient ritual
Calling me back, calling back to the game
Mutations taking place tonight
Through the hunger and need

Get down - take cover
See me prowling in the moonlight
Reach out - discover
Truth in the lies

Signs made of fire
In the dead of the night when we return
Higher and higher
The flames will fade and die
When we are divine

Creatures of a lower lifeform
They're always out for flesh, they're out for blood
Extinction makes them walk alone
Through a firestorm

Get down - take cover
Hear me howling in the twilight
Reach out - discover
Sign of the times

Signs made of fire
In the dead of the night when we return
Higher and higher
The flames will fade and die
When we are divine

Words of a liar
On the holy cross the bodies burn
A perfect desire
Flames will fade and die
When we are divine

So many questions have been asked
So many lies been told
So many dreams forsaken
In the name of divinity

[solo]

Signs made of fire
In the dead of the night when we return
Higher and higher
The flames will fade and die
When we are divine

Words of a liar
On the holy cross the bodies burn
A perfect desire
Flames will fade and die
When we are divine
