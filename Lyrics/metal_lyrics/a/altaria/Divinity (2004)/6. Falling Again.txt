[Liimatainen]

You are the fallen angel
Far from grace and on your way down
Standing in the cool night air
Don't feel the rain

Another night to wear you down
Another thorn into my crown
You are so far from reach and I'm in need

I am not your savior
So why I feel this guilty?
You are just a stranger
... but when we touch, I share your lust ...

You hear the beating of my heart
I see your eyes they're filled with scars
For you I'm one of many, you are my first

And as I take the streets again
I still remember the fire we shared
I know this was our moment and never again

Tell me who was using who?
Is there nothing left to do?
Can I fight that destiny
... bring the light into your night ...

I cast my shadow over thee
You let yours fall all over me
I'll be your night and you're my shining star
Out of the ashes we are born
The lost and damned with hope long gone
We're reaching out for light but falling again

[solo]

I can not hear no soothing song
I see no star to wish upon
No beacon in the night to guide my way

But I've been searching for so long
And you're the flame worth dying for
Your breath awakens me and makes me real

I swear I will make you mine
Cross my heart and hope to die
To eternity we'll fly
... side by side we will lie ...

I cast my shadow over thee
You let yours fall all over me
I'll be your night and you're my shining star
Out of the ashes we are born
The lost and damned with hope long gone
We're reaching out for light but falling again

I cast my shadow over thee
You let yours fall all over me
I'll be your night and you're my shining star
Out of the ashes we are born
The lost and damned with hope long gone
We're reaching out for love but falling again...
