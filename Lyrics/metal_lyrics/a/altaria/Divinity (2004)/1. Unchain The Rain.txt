[Liimatainen]

We've tread these paths of night so long
I'm right beside you just like thousand times before

I'm dark as dark can be
I'm face of tragedy
That feeling, deceiving
That burn in your soul

My kingdom come
My will be done
So join me fallen one

We'll drown our sorrow to this endless sea
Together we'll unchain the rain
Escape the world into our sanctuary
There in my arms you'll be free

Your guilt I will justify, I'll make you mine
To have, to hold and embrace

A spark of mystery
The dark discovery
In your loss my
Greatest victory

Closer apart
Two of a heart
Let us share the scars

Drown your sorrow to my endless sea
Together we'll unchain the rain
Escape the light into my sanctuary
There in my arms you'll be free

So many times we have been falling
So many times I've heard you swearing that we're through
As many times you have come crawling
'Cause no one else can ease your pain the way I do

We'll drown our sorrow to this endless sea
Together we'll unchain the rain
Escape the light into our sanctuary
There in my arms you'll be free

We'll drown our sorrow to this endless sea
Together we'll unchain the rain
And share our secret nighttime fantasy
Together in forever sleep...
