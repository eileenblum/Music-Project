[Pukkila / Smedjebacka]

"You ask me if I have a God complex
Let me tell you something
I am God"

From out of nowhere
Like a newborn child he comes
With wisdom greater than the world

Some need to belong
So the weak will follow
This false messiah made of lies

He says "Come with me into eternity
Share everything with me"

Prophet of pestilence
Holding on to the souls of the weak
Without forces of tyranny
In the night, in their dreams
He will rise by dawn

The angels calling
With burning eyes of lust
They will fall down on their knees

The sign of the cross
Gives him power
To manipulate the holy ones

He says "Ride the sky into oblivion
Leave all you had behind"

Prophet of pestilence
Holding on to the souls of the weak
Without forces of tyranny
In the night, in their dreams
He will rise by dawn

Prophet of pestilence
A decease in the real world with no one
Around and around they go
Carousel of emotions and thoughts betrayed

Prophet of pestilence
Holding on to the souls of the weak
Without forces of tyranny
In the night, in their dreams
He will rise by dawn

Prophet of pestilence
A decease in the real world with no one
Around and around they go
Carousel of emotions and thoughts betrayed

Without a warning he's gone
