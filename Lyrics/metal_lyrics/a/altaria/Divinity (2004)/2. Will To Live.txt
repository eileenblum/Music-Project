[Pukkila / Smedjebacka / Liimatainen]

I am too young to die
Yet I seem to be too frightened to live

Is this my destiny
To dwell in this cave of misery
My body's filled with scars
From the battles of my past

Voices are calling me
But still I cannot seem to move
Towards the bright white light
Where my wings will learn to fly

So I raise my head and await
What tomorrow holds for me

When your will to live is gone
And the child of love is lost
Time is your only friend and hope

When your will to live is gone
And a shadow carries on
Time will bring back the joy
And the will to live

Why is my day so dark
And when I climb I fall back down
Into the big black hole
Created by my soul

So I raise my head and await
What the future holds for me

When your will to live is gone
And the child of love is lost
Time is your only friend and hope

When your will to live is gone
And the shadow carries on
Time will bring back the joy
And the will to live

[solo]

When your will to live is gone
And the child of love is lost
Time is your only friend and hope

When your will to live is gone
And the shadow carries on
Time will bring back the joy

When your will to live is gone
And the child of love is lost
Time is your only friend and hope

When your will to live is gone
And the shadow carries on
Time will bring back the joy
And the will to live
