[Pukkila / Smedjebacka]

Hungry wolves are howling
In the forest of moonlight
A fallen hero looking for
The reason to some lies

And the lightning sets the universe aflame

At the rainbow's end we find
The treasure of our dreams
A soul survivor getting closer
To the secret of the key

To live forever more...

Fading lights remind me of the misery
And the darkened highlight
Painted skies resolve the ancient mystery
And the darkened highlight finds a way to shine

Taunted souls are calling
From the dungeons of the night
A dreamer realize too late
The race has just begun

And the thunder warns the earth the rain awaits

Destination no one knows
With a voice inside screams go
Pack your bags and leave again
The altar's calling you

To live forever more...

Fading lights remind me of the misery
And the darkened highlight
Painted skies resolve the ancient mystery
And the darkened highlight finds a way to shine

Face of evil laughing at the destiny
Of the darkened highlight
While the night gives birth to dreadful fantasies
And the darkened highlight finds a way to shine
Finds a way to shine

[solo]

Fading lights remind me of the misery
And the darkened highlight
Painted skies resolve the ancient mystery
And the darkened highlight finds a way to shine

Face of evil laughing out the destiny
Of the darkened highlight
While the night gives birth to dreadful fantasies
And the darkened highlight finds a way to shine
