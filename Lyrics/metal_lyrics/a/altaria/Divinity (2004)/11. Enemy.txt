[Pukkila / Smedjebacka]

Leave me alone
Are you friend or enemy
Leave me alone
Nothing's ever what it seems
Leave me alone - enemy

I knew right from the start
That I would not be free
Just by leaving all behind
But I just had to try
And spread my wings again
Recalling kings of times gone by

Can you see the flame has died
Do you ever wonder why
Take a hard look at me now

Leave me alone
Reflections of a stormy sea
Leave me alone
Affection slowly sets me free
Leave me alone - enemy

Remember yesterday
When skies were always blue
And no mountain was too high
Day by day I am
Returning with desire
Recalling gods of times gone by

Can you see the flame has died
Do you ever wonder why
Take a hard look at me now

Leave me alone
Reflections of stormy sea
Leave me alone
Affection slowly sets me free
Leave me alone
Are you friend or enemy
Leave me alone
Nothing's ever what is seems
Leave me alone - enemy

Leave me alone
Reflections of stormy sea
Leave me alone
Affection slowly sets me free
Leave me alone
Are you friend or enemy
Leave me alone
Nothing's ever what is seems
Leave me alone - enemy
