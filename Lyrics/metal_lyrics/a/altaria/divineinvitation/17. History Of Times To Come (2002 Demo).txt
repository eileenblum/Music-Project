History of times to come.

Dreaming of a different light,
And the people feed the fire.
An experiment that failed,
Created virtual royal-blood.

Facing the enemy,
In a kind of war where the,
Only ones to carry on,
Are made of stone cold steel.

Iron claws of terror,
Penetrate our hearts.
Mankind invented evil,
Then set it free.

History of times to come.
Where's the paradise?
Guardians of night still call,
From the other side.

"Pull the plug!", you say,
And the hero saves the day.
When nightmares and reality,
Unite and become one.

A brainwashed society,
Where the leaders cannot see.
The visions of an alien,
Until all dreams are gone.

Iron claws of terror,
Infiltrate our minds.
Mankind brought out the evil,
Then set it free.

History of times to come.
Where's the paradise?
Guardians of night still call,
From the other side.

History of times to come.
Where's the paradise?
Guardians of night still call,
From the other side.

History of times to come.
Where's the paradise?
Guardians of night still call,
From the other side.

History of times to come.
Where's the paradise?
Guardians of night still call,
From the other side.

History of times to come.
Where's the paradise?
Soldiers without face invade,
The temple of mankind.
