How he was a howling in the forest of moonlight,
The fallen hero looking for the reason to some lies.
And the lightning sets the universe a flame.
At the rainbows end we find,
The treasure of our dreams.

The soul survivor getting closer to the secret,
I'm thinking "Hey, to live forever more!"

Fading lights remind me of the misery,
And the darkened highlight.
They disguise with all the ancient mystery,
And the darkened highlight finds a way to shine.

Tortured souls are calling,
From the dungeons of the night.
A dreamer realised to late,
The race is just begun.

And the thunder warns the earth the rain awaits.
Destination, no-one knows,
But a voice inside screams "Go!"
Pack your bags and leave again,
The altereds calling out,
To live forever more.

Fading lights remind me of the misery,
And the darkened highlight.
They disguise with all the ancient mystery,
And the darkened highlight finds a way to shine.

Face of evil laughing at the destiny,
Of the darkened highlight.
While the night gives birth to dreadful fantasies.
And the darkened highlight finds a way to shine,
Finds a way to shine.

[Solo]

Fading lights remind me of the misery,
And the darkened highlight.
They disguise with all the ancient mystery,
And the darkened highlight finds a way to shine.

Face of evil laughing at the destiny,
Of the darkened highlight.
While the night gives birth to dreadful fantasies,
And the darkened highlight finds a way to shine.
