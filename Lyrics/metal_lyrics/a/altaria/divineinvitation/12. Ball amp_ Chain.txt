Gettin' ready for the takin',
The body's numb and hands are shakin'.
Stand your ground and prepare to fight.
We are one with the children of the night.

(Break out of your prison)
Leave your ball and chain.
(Chain to a measure)
Leave your ball and chain.

The curtains fall to hell's inferno.
The force unleashed, with no tomorrow.
Stand your ground and prepare to shout.
We are one with the legions of the loud.

(Break out of your prison)
Leave your ball and chain.
(Chain to a measure)
Leave your ball and chain.

[Solo]

(Break out of your prison)
Leave your ball and chain.
(Chain to a measure)
Leave your ball and chain.
