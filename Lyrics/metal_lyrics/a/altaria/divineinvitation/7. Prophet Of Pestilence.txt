"You ask me if I have a God complex? Let me tell you something; I am God."

From out of nowhere,
Like a new born child he comes.
With wisdom greater than the world.
Some need to be lone,
So that we will follow.
This force messiah made of lights,
He says "Come with me, into eternity,
Share a thing with me."

Prophet of Pestilence.
Holding on, to the sounds of the weak without,
Forces of tyranny, in the night,
In the dreams he will rise right on.

The angels calling,
With burning eyes of lust.
And they will fall down on their knees.
The sign of the cross, gives him power,
To manipulate the holy ones.
He says "Ride the sky, into oblivion,
Leave all you heard behind!"

Prophet of Pestilence.
Holding on, to the sounds of the weak without,
Forces of tyranny, in the night,
In the dreams he will rise right on.

Prophet of Pestilence.
A disease, in the railway with no-one.
Around and around they go,
Carousel, of emotions and thoughts betrayed.

Prophet of Pestilence.
Holding on, to the sounds of the weak without,
Forces of tyranny, in the night,
In the dreams he will rise right on.

Prophet of Pestilence.
A disease, in the railway with no-one.
Around and around they go,
Carousel, of emotions and thoughts betrayed.

Without warning, he's gone.
