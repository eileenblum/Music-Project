Listen up, listen to me,
Hear my warning.
Look around, rise and feel,
Another dawning.

Where winds carry hearts of love.

Play a game, but play it safe,
Stay forever.
Find a way, march in pain,
Through this jungle.

Where winds carry hearts of love.

In a dream I'm immortal.
I never gave a thought for tomorrow, disorder.
Yesterday brought me a dark trail of sorrow.

A life of chaos passes by, before my eyes.
While silent dreams are coming closer, look out!
An evil virus took control on a rainy night,
Symbolic thoughts of destiny.

[Solo]

In a dream I'm immortal.
I never gave a thought for tomorrow, disorder.
Yesterday brought me a dark trail of sorrow.

Immortal.
I never gave a thought for tomorrow, disorder.
Yesterday brought me a dark trail of sorrow.

Immortal.
Disorder.
Immortal.

Seems like I'm driftin' away to a world of disorder.
