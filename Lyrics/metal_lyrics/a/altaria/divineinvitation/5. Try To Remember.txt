Another young and restless soul,
Trapped in a world of shattered dreams.
Craving for a shelter to stay warm,
But there is no-one there for me.

Chains of the past still hold me down,
Though my heart wants to break free.
I tried to hold on to that dream,
That once again will slip away.

Feels like I'm drowning in tears,
Drifting away with the stream.
I hear them calling my name,
I'm fading away.

Send me down an angel (Down an angel)
From the heavens above the earth.
And I try to remember (Try to remember)
How this life under dark skies used to be.

Beyond the solid walls of stone,
The fields of green so wide.
Climbing a stairway made of stars,
Leaving the sorrows far behind.

Feels like I'm drowning in tears,
Drifting away with the stream.
I hear them calling my name,
I'm fading away.

Send me down an angel (Down an angel)
From the heavens above the earth.
And I try to remember (Try to remember)
How this life under dark skies.

Send me down an angel (Down an angel)
From the heavens above the earth.
And I try to remember (Try to remember)
How this life under dark skies used to be.

[Solo]

Send me down an angel (Down an angel)
From the heavens above the earth.
And I try to remember (Try to remember)
How this life under dark skies.

Send me down an angel (Down an angel)
From the heavens above the earth.
And I try to remember (Try to remember)
How this life under dark skies used to be.
