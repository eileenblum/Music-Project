We were young and innocent,
Playing with the fire.
One sensation. Honour, might.
Living in desire.

Came to go and come again,
Crossing every border.
Bless your crimes, day and night.
You let temptation lead the way to promise lands.

And the flames are burning higher,
So take my hand.
Just close your eyes,
And feel the fire.

(Calling your name)
Do they see?
(Calling your grace)
The Keeper of Mystique.
You ride the wind, forever free.

New memories, day by day,
Ashes of the fire.
Trying to escape the pain,
Heartbreak of a liar.

Holding onto what I am,
Dreams of lost illusions.
I run away into the haze,
And let my vengeance lead my way to misery.

And the flames are burning higher,
My destiny.
Just close your eyes,
And feel the fire.

(Calling your name)
Do they see?
(Calling your grace)
The Keeper of Mystique.
You ride the wind, forever free.

In the twilight,
Nothing's what it seems.
You feed your secrets to,
The Keeper of Mystique

[Solo]

(Calling your name)
Do they see?
(Calling your grace)
My destiny.

(Calling your name)
Do they see?
(Calling your grace)
The Keeper of Mystique.
Will ride the wind, forever free.
