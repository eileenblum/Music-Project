Look deeper into your eyes,
And tell me what you see.
Misty dreams and false illusions,
In a darkened sea of tears.

Find the meaning and carry on,
Just let the hate surface.
Make your choice, make your decision.
And hide away the fears.

Vengeance is yours to demand,
Though destiny is out of your hands.

Innocent - like a child.
Heaven sent - lost in time.
World crashed down,
Right before your eyes.

Look deeper into your eyes,
And set the demons free.
Shameful lies and raging evil,
Forever choking you.

Vengeance is yours to demand,
Though destiny is out of your hands.

Innocent - like a child.
Heaven sent - lost in time.
World crashed down,
Right before your eyes.

Innocent - like a child.
Heaven sent - lost in time.
Flames of fire,
All die one by one.

[Solo]

Innocent - like a child.
Heaven sent - lost in time.

Innocent - like a child.
Heaven sent - lost in time.
World crashed down,
Right before your eyes.

Innocent - like a child.
Heaven sent - lost in time.
Flames of fire,
All died one by one.
