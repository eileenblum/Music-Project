[Spoken:] "Welcome to the Kingdom of the Night."

Please leave the light on,
I'm on my way, on my way.

Yesterday's gone, miles dividing.
So many years have passed my friend,
The road back home remains.
In the kingdom of the night.

I'm closing the door behind me,
Now that my broken wings are healed.
Returning with signs of danger,
Fighting for pride and glory.

Yesterday's gone, miles dividing.
So many years have passed my friend,
The road back home remains.
In the kingdom of the night.

I'm racing the streets of freedom,
In a world where power rules the mind.
Invading the heart of millions,
Building a great new nation.

Yesterday's gone, miles dividing.
So many years have passed my friend,
The road back home remains.

[Solo]

Yesterday's gone, miles dividing.
So many years have passed my friend,
The road back home remains.

Yesterday's gone, miles dividing.
So many years have passed my friend,
The road back home remains.
In the kingdom of the night.

In the kingdom of the night.
