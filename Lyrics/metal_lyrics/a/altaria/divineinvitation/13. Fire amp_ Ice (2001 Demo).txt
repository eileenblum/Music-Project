Like a whirlwind of neon through empty streets,
The crusader forever rages.
A message he brings to the chosen one,
On the wings of a fire-spitting dragon, yeah.

Remember his name you'll hear it again,
As the clouds of the tempest gather.
From the skies he'll return, with the speed of light,
And the sword of vengeance higher.

See the calm before the storm.

Fire and Ice,
Sleeping visions come to life again.
Fire and Ice,
Out of the night.

Nation by nation he'll conquer the world,
A warrior shows no mercy.
From the arctic cold to the tropical night,
Far and wide goes the glorious journey.

See the calm before the storm.

Fire and Ice,
Sleeping visions come to life again.
Fire and Ice,
Out of the night.

Fire and Ice,
Sleeping visions come to life again.
Fire and Ice,
Out of the night.

Yeah.

[Solo]

Fire and Ice,
Sleeping visions come to life again.
Fire and Ice,
Out of the night.

Fire and Ice,
Sleeping visions come to life again.
Fire and Ice,
Out of the night.
