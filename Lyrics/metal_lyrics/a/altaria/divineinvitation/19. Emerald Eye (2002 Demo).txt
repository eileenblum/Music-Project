As the sun sets down in the west,
Another sleepless night comes her way.
Working late for the ruler of the street.

Finding her way through hard times,
Trying to make a good life,
Selling her body to strangers in the night.

Oh, emerald eye - hold on to the signs,
Of a distant thunder roaring in the sky.

As the sun rises up in the east,
Another tyrant adores his world,
Diamond rings and a monument of gold.

Born to take over the throne,
A creature without heart,
Feeding a violent legacy of lies.

Oh, emerald eye - hold on to the signs,
Of a distant thunder roaring in the sky.

Oh, emerald eye - gaze into the light,
Hear the distant thunder roaring across the sky.

[Solo]

Oh, emerald eye - hold on to the signs,
Of a distant thunder roaring in the sky.

Oh, emerald eye - gaze into the light,
Hear the distant thunder roaring across the sky.

Hear the distant thunder roaring across the sky.
