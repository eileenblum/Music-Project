I take a look into your tear-filled lying eyes,
I see a glimpse of goodness, but the anger holds my mind.
I know that you and I, we could have worked things out,
But it's too late by now, we're at the point of no return.

This pilot will crash and burn into the final warning.
In the jaws of danger, on a misty morning.
And I show no mercy when I call off the warning of love.

You made an enemy,
Of the one you use to want.
And I can turn around,
To take you back into my arms.

I hear your desperate cry,
And I'm almost there again.
But it's too late by now,
Cause it seems you'll never learn.

This pilot will crash and burn into the final warning.
In the jaws of danger, on a misty morning.
And I show no mercy when I call off the warning.

It's the final dawning.
When the gates are open,
And the tears are falling.
Yet I show no mercy when I call off the warning of love,
Warning of love.

[Solo]

Final warning.
In the jaws of danger, on a misty morning.
And I show no mercy when I call off the warning.

It's the final dawning.
When the gates are open,
And the tears are falling.
Yet I show no mercy when I call off the warning of love,

[Fade out]
(Final warning)
In the jaws of danger, on a misty morning.
And I show no mercy when I call off the warning.
It's the final dawning.
