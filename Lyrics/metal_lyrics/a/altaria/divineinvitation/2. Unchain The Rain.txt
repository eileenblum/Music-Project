We tread these paths of light so long
I'm right beside you just like thousand times before
I'm knocked at agony, I face a tragedy
That feeling, deceiving, that burning your soul
My kingdom come, my will be done
So join me fallen one

We'll drown our sorrow to this endless sea
Together we'll unchain the rain
Escape the world into our sanctuary
There in my arms you'll be free

Your guilt I will justify
I'll make you mine
To have, to hold and embrace
A spark of mystery
The dark discovery
In your laws my greatest victory

Closer a part, to offer hearts
Let us share the stars

Drown your sorrow to my endless sea
Together we'll unchain the rain
Escape the light into our sanctuary
There in my arms you'll be free

So may times we have been fallen
So many times I've heard you swearing that we're through
As many times you have come crawling
Cause no-one else can ease your pain the way I do

We'll drown our sorrow to this endless sea
Together we'll unchain the rain
Escape the light into our sanctuary
There in my arms you'll be free

We'll drown our sorrow to this endless sea
Together we'll unchain the rain
And share our secret night-time fantasy
Together in forever sleep
