Over the mountains across the sea,
Come the men of eternal night.
Hooded disciples of misery,
Leading the evil crusade.

Through forests of darkness in faraway lands,
Obeying the spell of the priest.
With hearts made of iron and bullets of steel,
Delievering goods to be seen.

Winds of winter still blow,
Through the trees.
Wounded warriors fall,
On their knees.

Before the ravenwing,
Faces from the past return with dreams.
Rise ravenwing,
High above the holy battlefield.

Beyond the rainbow in no mans land,
Where armies prepare for the fight.
The chains of a savage from caves in the north,
Break as the dawn fades to black.

Chaos and mayhem in wastelands of hate,
And storms turning cities to dust.
The men of the night standing by for the pain,
With fear in the hearts of the damned.

Winds of winter still blow,
Through the trees.
Wounded warriors fall,
On their knees.

Before the ravenwing,
Faces from the past return with dreams.
Rise ravenwing,
High above the holy battlefield.

Ravenwing!
Faces from the past return with dreams.
Rise ravenwing,
High above the holy battlefield.

And into the stargate we raised,
On a solid foundation.

[Solo]

Before the ravenwing,
Faces from the past return with dreams.
Rise ravenwing,
High above the holy battlefield.

Ravenwing!
Faces from the past return with dreams.
Rise ravenwing,
High above the holy battlefield.

Ravenwing!
