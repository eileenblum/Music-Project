Inner darkness consumes the mind
countless visions awakened eyes
all I feel is empty faith
no one can save us
from our fates

Hell its immortal
Do what thou wilt!
Hell its eternal!
Do what thou wilt!
then die

Avenge the throne
and save the soul

This world will end in agony
so find the light, mind, soul and body
redeem your immortality
create your destiny

This world was born to die
your mind was forged to disappear
our souls shall endure forever
bringers of light
we shall never surrender

One of these days
we'll rise from beyond the grave
with the dawning of a new age
the light of the shadows
illuminates he vision of the son
the apex of the capstone
shall be made one with sun
