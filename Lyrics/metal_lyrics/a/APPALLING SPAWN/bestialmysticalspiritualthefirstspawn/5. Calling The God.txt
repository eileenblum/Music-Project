Night descends gently into my mind,
sublime castles disappears,
aggressive even submissive wind
moaning calm changes.
Solitude once so elating, now swallowing me.
Do you hide from me or my sight
perhaps obscured your light does not see?
It is so long time ago
when veiled to vesture of pain I beheld you
FOR THE FIRST TIME
My hands silently fumbling only a cold strike.
My longing calling you stays unheard.
My belief then born however unweakened stays.
You are luring me through
the hearts of those you dwell inside
and I as a bee sitting from flower to flower
pollen from these hearts
I GATHER...
