I used to walk there too my dear friend.
I used to walk there so often.
I used to pick up those beautiful flowers.
I used to pick bunches of them up,
such a pleasure and such a pain...
I could not learn how to fight that temptation...
Then came a day and I could not see
their beauty anymore.
I have begun to feel compassion,
I have to feel begun to feel deep love.
Love that you can not feel NOW...
