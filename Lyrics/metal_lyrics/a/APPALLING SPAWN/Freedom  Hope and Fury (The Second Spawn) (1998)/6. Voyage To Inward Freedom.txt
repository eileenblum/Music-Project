FREEDOM !!!
Fear enlaces the mighty pinions swelling in the chest
You can feel it...obey that call...kill fear...grind chains
Wing on that mighty pinions unto the freedom and announce others about your victory
Take them with you, tell them about freedom, dry them tears and show them way...
A way to inland a way to heart, there you will enter the Christ's kingdom
Only the strong ones will reach the end of ... VOYAGE

Everyone is desirable who winged on that pinions and was trusted with sword of HOPE

The burden of responsibility will elate you,
Remember the silent wish in their eyes,
Let it always be the solder between inexhaustible power of your inland and consciousness...
