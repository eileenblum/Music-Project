In fight there reveals a power ...blood ...sickly dies...withering away falls off...with sword in hand
Power is a principle...it goes on...weakness is a sign...OF DECAY

Suddenly I fly above that stream,
Somebody's holding my hand &amp; my heart,
With shame I throw away my sword,
TEARS FLOW FROM MY HEART...

With pain I return ...back to stream...bu I don't know WHY

Perhaps to tell about the place beyond the stream,
Perhaps to know how to take by the hand &amp; heart as I was taken,
Perhaps to cleanse and elate the power reigning in the stream....
