Opened eyes...opened arms...opened heart - it will make you happy man
Life's beautiful....if you want
Worship freedom....don't loose hope
Say your wishes....make them happen
REMEMBER YOUR HEART IS FREE !!!
Let yourself walk uprightly your way consequently free,
Let the stones that you'll be rumbling over lesson for you...
However you must discern the ones that laid earthly dark
From those that disseminated Celestian the God.

Not until then your spirit shall uprise from the couch and enter the AURA...
Not until then your shoulders will be burdened by the MISSION...
Let your yearning interrupt that, lowering SYMBIOSIS...
OH CELESTIAN...let your voice feeds their starving soul soon...and they will take the air...
