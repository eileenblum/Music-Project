I will never forget their faces
I will never forget what I felt
I will remember touching their auras FOREVER...
They were life and they still are...
I touched their souls and
I want to touch again forever.
They tought to me to love and they still do.
Our hearts were beating together in understanding - the deepest one.
We walked and did not have to speak.
Tear caress my face
And I let them.
But I hear them saying:
"hold on and fight we will meet soon again dear brother".
I know I have continue and spread their heritage until that time when heart will not beat for my soul
ANYMORE...
