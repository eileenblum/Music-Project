Those are the whiles when my heart is slowly beating,
Where my words aren't able to fly to,
My heaven I call them but often I let myself descend down to the Earth...
Where battles are raging,
What do I fight for,
I fight to know,
To realize the magnificence of my heaven,
To stay there forever even when I leave... to stay there
forever even when I leave

MY HEAVEN

Yours is the heaven,
Yours is the hell,
But remember... YOURS IS THE CHOICE....
