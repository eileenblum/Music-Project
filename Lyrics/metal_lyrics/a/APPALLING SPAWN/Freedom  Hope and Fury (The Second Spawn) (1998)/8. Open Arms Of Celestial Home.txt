Did I really forget such a beauty to love without fear and live my life with hope?
With hope and without fear that by time I expire at last I'll return home....
...home to that most precious embrace...

Therefore the fear grips me because life seems to be the only form of perceiving my entity.
I pray to realize that elating certainty...
Sometimes I feel like a child taken away from its mother...
Sometimes I feel like a child torn from mother's womb...

OPEN ARMS OF CELESTIAL HOME WILL WELCOME ME,
I'M LONGING SO MUCH.......
