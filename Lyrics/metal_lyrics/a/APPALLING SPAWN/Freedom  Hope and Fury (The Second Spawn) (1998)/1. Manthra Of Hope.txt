With hope live, with hope love,
With hope suffer and with hope ... die
We all know pain,
Sometimes we all weep,
You are god don't weep...
With hope wake, with hope fall asleep
You are God so please don't weep...

MANTHRA - MANTHRA - MANTHRA
MANTHRA OF HOPE

Kill sadness - kill sadness - kill sadness - kill sadness
Kill sadness - kill sadness - kill sadness - kill sadness
