I destroy the dark light and the slime and celebrate blissful victory
I am disembowelling the fear my light is swallowing all its
DARKNESS
I paralyze that crying little submission as I turn my fear to dust
My spirit is pervaded by the godness I am entering the EARTH...
On the ashes of the once strong gripping anxieties I paint my picture a vision of unlimited touch
SELFMONARCH
I - GOD
Psychical weakness - sickness
Invisible will - not ruins...
