The cleansing stream, killing with love,
The last but one step to celestial home,
SWORD OF FURY .... SUBLIME HEART
There is always dolphin swimming by your side and
There is always bird of prey running by the other one,
Bird of prey leaves the tears of those who don't cope his ferocity and pace behind but dolphin weeps with them.

SUBLIME FURY - SUBLIME FURY

Let the animals talk to each other,
Then you will fight with ...SUBLIME FURY
Then you will fight with ...PRIDE
Then you will fight with ...FURY IN EYES
Then you will fight with ...TEARS IN HEART....
