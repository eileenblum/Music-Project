Mal'ak, Mal'ak
- Come from the shadows
Send light into
All parts of the world
Mal'ak, Mal'ak
- Emerge from the shadows
Carry the fire
Of dead souls to serve

Mal'ak, Mal'ak
- Come from the shadows
Send fear into all parts of the earth
Mal'ak, Mal'ak
- Emerge from the shadows
Carry the hearts
Of dead children to serve

Between two worlds
Oh tongue of the lord
Oh angel with the cold blade

Between two worlds
Oh demon in trance
Between two worlds
Oh cursed beholder

Feared by the living
Who so blindly walk on
Paths of no grace
Feared by the living
Who so blindly dance in joy
Into their graves

Break the hands you shake
Burn the skin you touch
Blind the eyes
That behold your beauty
Crush the hearts
That beat for you in love
Paths lie ahead of which
No human could ever tell
Passages lie ahead through which
No human would ever dare to follow
Paths so dark, gateways to hell
Paths so vast, paths so hollow

Mal'ak, Mal'ak
- Come from the shadows
Send death into all parts of the world
Mal'ak, Mal'ak
- Emerge from the shadows
Carry the fire of dead souls to serve
[repeat]
