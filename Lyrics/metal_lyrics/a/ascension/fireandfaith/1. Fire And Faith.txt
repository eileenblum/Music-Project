As fire arises
Illuminating the end
Death's hammer pounding
Flesh to ascend

Ashes rise
Into the night
Blessed wraiths
Perdition
Fire &amp; faith

Flames now embrace
The children of Night
Judged by the guilty
Marching with pride

Kiss the lips of judas
Let him hang from this tree
Averse the adversary
Celebrate divine faith on your knees
Gaze into your heart
And you will have a glance at death
Gaze into their hearts
And you shall behold
An abyss so cold and dark

So dance, my child
Dance with fiery breath
Dance, my child
Dance towards death
Ratio trembles in uncontrolled fear
As we utter our words from
The seven mountains
The heaven's burst
As we arise from death's fountain
So dance, my child
Dance with wrath and pride
Dance, my child
Towards his eternal light

As fire arises
Illuminating the end
Death's hammer pounding
Flesh to ascent

Ashes rise
Into the night
Blessed wraiths
Damnation
Fire &amp; faith
Ashes rise
Into the night
Blessed wraiths
Convictions
Fire &amp; faith
