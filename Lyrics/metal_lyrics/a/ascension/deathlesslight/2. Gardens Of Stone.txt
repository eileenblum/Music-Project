Why is this doubt lingering?
When all I see is stone
Why is this heart still beating?
When all I touch is gone

The gods have laughed
The gods have raped
The gods have forsaken
The grace of growth

The gods have laughed
The gods have raped
The gods have given
The gods have bestowed
The grace of emptiness
Unto a crown of snakes

You shall not see
You shall not hear
A single sound
A single tear

Why is this doubt lingering?
When all I see is stone
Why is this heart still beating?
When all I touch is gone
