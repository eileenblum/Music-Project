Idpa Namtar Utuk Alal
Bursting forth through the gate
Sleepless formless heartless ageless
Enter - tear down
Feast on hearts
And bury from inside

Uruku Gigin Telal
Storming through the gateways
Of starless darkness
And hallways of
Sleepless formless heartless faceless and shapeless
Boundless nameless ageless horror

Hail - sleeper in Nar Mattaru
Mankind trembles in fear
As dark waters stir
Awake - sleeper in Nar Mattaru
Lying in wait
Dreaming in death

You will not know them
You will not see them
There will be no sign
You will not hear them
You will not feel them
But there will be a time

You will not hear them
You will not feel them
Roaring in outer space
You will not know them
You will not see them
But there will be a place

Seven steps below
Seven gates await

Hail - sleeper in Nar Mattaru
Mankind trembles in fear
As dark waters stir
Awake - sleeper in Nar Mattaru
Lying in wait
For too long
Dreaming in death
