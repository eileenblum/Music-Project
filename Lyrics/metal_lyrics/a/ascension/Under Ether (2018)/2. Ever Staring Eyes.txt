Ten thousand tentacles
Embrace the heart at night
Where pitch black skies below the earth
Are enlightened with rays of future yesteryears light
Slowly torn from sense and from sanity
Voices from beyond the raging tides
Morning whispers inside darkness undead
Chanting choirs - madness nights

Ten thousand scoffing throats
Engulf the heart at night
Beyond approaching dark clouds
Formless shades fly out of sight
These walls they speak, they haunt and they unfold
Under crumbling clay - a stench so fowl and old
Hypnotized by the terror that meets the eye
Maddening glare - maddening gaze
Fever pitch - black star blaze

Necronaut koma
Hovering above the center of light
Dweller on the threshold
Underneath ever staring eyes

Evil gods on madness feeding
Blinded sight - the mind left bleeding
Things unseen forever fleeting
Under a dead sun's merciless glance

Dark creatures on hearts feeding
Thresholds burning - ever breeding
Things unseen forever fleeting
Under ether let us dance

Necronaut koma
Dragged into the core of frenzy
Guardian on the threshold
Underneath ever staring...

Necronaut koma
Hovering above the center of light
Dweller on the threshold
Undernearth ever staring eyes
