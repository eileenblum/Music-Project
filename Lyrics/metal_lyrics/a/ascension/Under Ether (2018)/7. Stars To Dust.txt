Earth dissolves into water
Illusions conflagrate behind the eye
The liars last stand has begun

In the vessel lies broken and dry in front of you
Will you take a hammer
Or will you renew?

Smoke rises underneath your feet
Suffocating the ties to life
Time has stopped to crawl
Mind confused, getting weak
As water transforms into fire

Flying sparks ascend to hell
Falling from the ground
It has grown cold now
As fire dissolves into air

Visions of future past
Fall to the ground and rise again
Absence takes control
As air dissolves into nothing

Red and white
Above and below
Colliding
Amidst the heart

Will you take a hammer
Or will you renew?

A burning candle may lead the way
Or will you be lead astray?
A burning candle may lead...
Astray
