Seven candles burn at the rail
The winds have grown silent
The sea no longer is in turmoil
And a pale moon has risen high
As we lay on our vessel
In the midst of dark waters
Frozen in time

Staring into the pitch black night
The lights that shine in the distance of the havens
Grow dimmer and dimmer, fading

You will not sway or lure us aside
For our only way is down
Our blood is the blood of vengeance
Our spirit the spirit of vengeance

Like an old memory, eradicated from the world
There we have lain
On grey grass
Amidst flowers without a scent
Below skies without fire
Standing still
Illuminating... nothing
Where would we go from there
But nowhere?

7 candles
Extinguished one by one
As the cere grows hard and cold
The abyss opens up for us

Lightning strikes the sky
Furious tempest, roaring thunder
Clear light of death - shine unto us

Sanity and madness embrace in agony
Blood rushes inside and outside
In an eternal dance between presence and emptiness
White clear blue skies
Turn to pitch black holes

A solicitation answered
A call finally heard
We can no longer see
What binds our world and the three

Towards the end
Don't try to sway or lure us aside
For our only way is down
The maelstrom awaits
Unbound from anyone
Where do we go from here
But anywhere?
