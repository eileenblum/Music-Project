The sound of the bell
Transforms the nature of the heart
Wanderers in twilight
Where the trails of life and death vanish

This is our church
This is our temple
Were we called out of the world?
Or did we leave ourselves?
This is our oath
This is our burden

It is hard to see the rotten body
Underneath the golden armour
And it is hard to see the scaffold
When the lights blind you from all sights
Abandon Hope

All ye who enter here
For this is our church
This is our temple
This is our blessing
This is our curse

As dark stars have risen high
And the moon brightens the way
Forever under the rose
Towards redemption day
This is our nature
This is our heart

As dark stars have risen high
And the moon brightens the way
Forever under the rose
Towards redemption day

This is our church
This is our temple
This is our blessing
This is our curse
