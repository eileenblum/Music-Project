Close your eyes
And cease to dream
For what you thought
You could and could not see
Will no longer be your reality
Beneath the visible world
The restraints become clear
In a chasm where life should not exist
You will vanish in fear

Under the surface
True horrors await
Ineffable abominations of aeons passed
And all the dangers that are concealed by dark
Under the surface
Lingers the unspeakable

Close your eyes
And abandon all hope
For what you thought
What could or could not be
All along has been a reverie
There are but terrors
On the way to the self
Despair and lunacy
Will stay with you
And they will carry the sound of your voice
Only deafened by silently roaring noise

Under the surface
True horrors await
Ineffable abominations of aeons passed
And all the dangers that are concealed by dark
Under the surface
Lingers the unspeakable

Time and time again
You told the world
That darkness is your element
And that you begged the I to fade
But when I dragged you under water
Your eyes would tell
That you were afraid
