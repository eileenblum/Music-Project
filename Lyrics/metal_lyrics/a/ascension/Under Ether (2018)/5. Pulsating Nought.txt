As all these patterns fade
And colors merge into grey
I reach the portal bizarre
Step into me while I pass!

Rancid grey light
Evaporates my eyes
Radiant night
Takes clearest sight
Wounded summer sky
Pour down
Pulsating nought, ravage me
A soul must die

As all these patterns fade
And colors die into grey
When all these walls collide
I pass... and disintegrate

Lucid visions of repugnant fume
Materialize in shapes forbidden
The obscene scent of a blazing noise
You fill and fulfill me now

Trapped in the nought
Roamingg above the valley of death
Fiery pit
Loosing my grip
Falling....
Down the bottomless well
The gatesways through your rotten heart
Tumble down and lick the poison crown
And drown...
Forever

Rancid grey light
Evaporates my eyes
Radiant night
Takes clearest sight
Wounded summer sky
Pour down
Pulsating nought, ravage me
A soul must die

Fragile are the threads, I know
And yet I need to tear
For once I'll leave my flesh behind
I must return in fear...
...To disintegrate again and become
