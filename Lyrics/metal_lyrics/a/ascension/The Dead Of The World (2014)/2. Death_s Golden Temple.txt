Death by death
stone by stone
drop on drop
bone on bone

The epitome of suffering and punishment
there is no heaven beyond this hell
but the burning furnace of immaculate nothingness
foreboded by the sound of 13 bells

COME, from flaming skies
COME, with wings unfold
COME, from roaring depths
COME, let the word of truth be told
COME
now COME!
COME
now COME!

step by step
a path on the dead
beneath the soil
lies the rotten core of reason
fumes twist the mind
voices torment the soul
the filth shall turn to gold

For in this temple sinfully
it is not love that I can see
it is the pain
it is the grief
the devilÂ´s kiss eternally
trumpets roar, the angels sing
with scarlet blades and liquid fire
transformation, burning cinder
at the feet of the devilÂ´s pyre

silence!

in this blessed waking hour
his light will burn the heart of men
piercing gaze of sulphur fire
deceived and poisoned, twisted tongues
into the void
into the void
into the void
into the void
gracefallen sons and daughters
wounds fertile with locusts and maggots
giving birth to flesh, devoured by kin
Unbound are the seas
and hungry the deserts
overflown with blood they shall sleep in the hour
when the stars will flee the light of the lord

temple of purest gold
tower of madness
encircled by flies
forever laying in perfection
for no beauty can die when death is the only beauty
on sacred paths
over the fields of war and disease
four riders lead the way

with broken bones
and burning flesh
onwards to the gallows
there is no place to hide
a burning sea awaits thee
towards deathÂ´s golden temple
in everlasting fear you stride

as torches you shall light the hallway
where the one will enter his domain
COME, from flaming skies
COME, with wings unfold
COME, from roaring depths
COME, let the word be told
COME
now COME

For in this temple sinfully
it is not hope that you will see
for it is death
it is defeat
the devil's kiss eternally
