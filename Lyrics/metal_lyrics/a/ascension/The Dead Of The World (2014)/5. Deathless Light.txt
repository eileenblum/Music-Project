Dark god, timeless reign, ever, before, ever, after
Silent, unchallenged, dark are the roots on which the prison was built
The walls crumble, the smiles fade, no one shall dare to speak thy name
Cruesome wanderer, holy king, spiritual father of ages and destroyer of aeons

Wrathful god, cruesome reign, before everything, inside anyone
Unsilent, awake, fading the sand on which the prison was build
The hour draws near, petrified pride, no one dares to speak thy name
Cruel overlord of ages, bearer of deathless light

For thee we hang the infants on the highest tree so that from afar they all shall see
That this is not the land of god, but the temple of the adversary

Bow down and embrace the lord ascending the throne
His blade we lead, his scythe we swing, his fire we shall bring

Al-la Xul, tempter of the night, slayer of men, deathless light
In every heart, in every breath lies the lie and the stench of death

Our veins are opened for thee, our hearts are growning cold
Shall we murder, shall we slay, before our flesh is growing old?
For behind the eyes they speak to us in cruesome ancient tongues
Within us, outside us, around us, the serpents crawl in furious fire

Al-la Xul, tempter of the night, slayer of men, deathless light
In every heart, in every breath, lies the lie and the stench of death

Alla Xul, destiny-devilry, on dark tombs where nothing resounded
Where we have dreamed, where we have lain, where we have awaited the night, where we have forged this chain
Alla Xul, shadow of death, anoint our heads and tear our souls apart
Alla Xul, we are thy breed and forever shall we crawl

Hang the infants on the highest tree so that from afar they all shall see
That this is not the land of god, but the temple of the adversary
See now the infants in the highest trees, unsilently haunted sleep
Shine now on us, tempter of the night, shine now through us, deathless light
