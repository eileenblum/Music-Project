Deeper and deeper
as the moon rose
as the wind blows
as the blood flows

On fire and abscent
in feverish sleep
inside of you lurks the fire
i long to be burned by

by thy sulphur breath
Embers Aflame
by thy cursed name
in the dead of night
Embers Aflame
The fires
The fires
that drive me insane

from the mountains and valleys
in the sound of the waves
i hear the voices sing
from the blessed earth of a new tomb
from the laughing scaffolds
i hear the song of a king

Darker and darker
as the heart chose
as the wind blows
as the sun froze

Envenomed and longing
in feverish sleep
restless wanderer on the threshold
forever striding towards you
into you into you
And inside of you lurks the water
i long to drown in

the rain may wash away the blood and the stench
but my heart can never be cleansed
there is a splinter in itÂ´s core
deeper and colder than a blade can be

by thy sulphur breath
Embers Aflame
by thy cursed name
in the dead of night
Embers Aflame
The fires
The fires
that drive me insane

It is the pain and the fever and the freedom
Thy sparks blind my eyes
yet i see clearer then ever before
desires run red
In this blessed darkness
Take me to the valley
where life is but a shadow
Unbound from anyone to deceive
My grave is my castle
and i never want to leave

As darkness lays itÂ´s grip
around the heart of the world
and fears enter the dreams of the infants
with dragonfire in my heart
i start my path
into the night
