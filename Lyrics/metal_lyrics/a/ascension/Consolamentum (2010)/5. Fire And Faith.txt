As fire arisesIlluminating the endDeath's hammer poundingFlesh to ascend Ashes riseInto the nightBlessed wraithsPerditionFire &amp; faith Flames now embraceThe children of NightJudged by the guiltyMarching with pride Kiss the lips of judasLet him hang from this treeAverse the adversaryCelebrate divine faith on your kneesGaze into your heartAnd you will have a glance at deathGaze into their heartsAnd you shall beholdAn abyss so cold and dark So dance, my childDance with fiery breathDance, my childDance towards deathRatio trembles in uncontrolled fearAs we utter our words fromThe seven mountainsThe heaven's burstAs we arise from death's fountainSo dance, my childDance with wrath and prideDance, my childTowards his eternal light As fire arisesIlluminating the endDeath's hammer poundingFlesh to ascent Ashes riseInto the nightBlessed wraithsDamnationFire &amp;faithAshes riseInto the nightBlessed wraithsConvictionFire &amp; faith
