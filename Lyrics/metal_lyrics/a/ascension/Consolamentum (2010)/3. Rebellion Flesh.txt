In the nighttimeIn irately sleepShadows hauntDemons come to reapBeneath the pillarsA new built pyreRebellion flesh movesSkin burnsThe dragon breaths fire In the nighttimeEntering silent sleepA shadow risesA demon has come to reapTwisting, turningStained with bloodLike an infected wormCrawling into the temple of god I deny theeMy heart was never yoursI refuse the gift of lifeAs divine mysteries call for my strife The walls of confinement are crumblingRelentless paths to walk onA thousand years to sufferA thousand poisons to choose fromLucifer guards!The stony path to storm onA thousand years to starveA thousand years to nourish from In the nighttimeIn irately sleepShadows hauntDemons come to reapIn the nighttimeHolding it's breathIn the nighttimeA soul is longing for death
