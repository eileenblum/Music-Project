Born of fireThrown into dustBound to the will of thy terrestrial flesh and bloodThe womb of nothingnessHas set you freeAnd no birthmarks you shall seeSerpent and seraphim erect in silenceBetween the One and the threeYou must fill the emptinessUntil the day that your mind will caressThe darkness that embraces your soulAnd into dreadful dreams you will fallFor you shall bear the torch of love and faithAnd you will wish to dieFor blood you will drinkAnd hearts you will eatAnd you shall raise the body of the Lord!
