Enshrined in darkened labyrinthsSurrounded by lethal lightDreaming, undead, seeing noneBlindly moving towards a fixed sunPoisoned by the love of godIn his golden cellars you rotThe dreamwinds of an apparent edenCall for no resistance You have learned how to breathNow learn how to lieYou can not as you want?You will not as you could!The chains that lay around your neckAre too heavy to resistResist to struggleThe chains of lifeWill you do as you believe?When flesh swallows dreamsWhen the lie suffocates your breathYou manifest I reveal youI welcome youFrom the depths of my heart I detest youOh aplha almightyA thousand wounds to healAlpha almightyA thousand hearts to steal Grey light surrounds your mundane haloNo fire to be seenSacred keeper of the kosmik orderBow your head in shameYour tongue tells no truthYour skin never touched fireYour ears never heard the voiceOf the One to aspire I reveal youI welcome youFrom the depths of my heart I despise youGuardian of their prisonsSeven skies so blueI reveal youI welcome youIn grey mirrorsI am you
