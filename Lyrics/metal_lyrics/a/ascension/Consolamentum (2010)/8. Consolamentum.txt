1. Asleep...Awake, my heart 2. Reflection, aware of the necessity to slay the sibling. Teach me the failure of lower two.Sow and reap unity in my heart. As I shall become one in thee. 3. Rebellion, no heart beats in my chest. Rise above earthly contraries and broken mirrors.Rod of equilibrium, born of yourself. Suspended in chains. Conjunction, a heart beats not in my chest. 4. As the wise mistaker spoke. There is only light in darkness. As I wander down the darkest valleys,no shadow may cast on me. A world released of vileness and compassion, down in the core of light.A word released of chains and contradiction, down in the core of light. 5. As the serpent passed the chalice of faith, I may be released from starvation.As I wandered along the rivers of truth, I distinguished they never could stay still. 6. And god never spoke of peace (but the double-edged blade), knight under the banner of mixed blessing, march, stumble, release yourself from this soul. O Heroine, dressed in white and red, O Heroine, slay the unjudged. 7. O angel of the burning sun. In maternal love. Lactating, spilleth simmering tardrops down on me.Searing, sealing my lips and aflameth my tongue. Thou art sky, concede me to ascend.I cut this silent oath of love out of trembling flesh. 8. Consolamentum, nourished by fire a heart is pure. Sired of ash a soul will live.Let me see what they see not, visions clearly while eyes rot. A gracious star fell burning from the sky, O timeless king, you teached me how to die.
