A thorn without a roseAn apparition from the hungry voidA world to opposeA dream to become destroyed Let me sleep hereBetween skulls, skin and boneLet me dream hereAmidst my sacred throne Earth and flesh I shall devourPain and bliss I shall make oneAnd above my scarlet towerThere shall never ever rise thy sun Let me dream hereAmidst my sacred throneLet me inhale fearAnd feast on your holy flesh and bone A glaring darkness has possessed my heartA venomous tongue has learned to killA temple has been torn apartIt's destiny to fulfill RandomSparing noneCruesomeBlinded by no sun A thorn without a roseAn apparition from the hungry voidA world to opposeA dream to become destroyed Let me sleep hereBetween skulls, skin and boneLet me dream hereAmidst my sacred throneLet me dream hereAmidst my sacred throneLet me inhale your fearLet me feast on your sacred flesh and bone
