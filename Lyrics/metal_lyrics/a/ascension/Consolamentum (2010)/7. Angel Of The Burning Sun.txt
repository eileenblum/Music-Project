A fire was falling from heaven, enlightening the skies of night.Where serpents winds storm and dark waters form a maelstorm he,crowned with halo of death and the scepter of damnation erected his temple of heresy.And he bears the torch of salvation. Lucifer - LightbearerLucifer - King divineEosphoros - LightbearerEosphoros - Prince of mine Unto my spirit send thy flame now as I follow thee into the night.In the absence of all senses the circle shall crack under the weight of thy light and pride.Under thy wings I shall walk from life and I shall see truth.The darkness of thy flaming fall, the mark of rebellion I shall carry through aeons to come. Lucifer - LightbearerLucifer - King divineEosphoros - LightbearerEosphoros - Prince of mine I believe now. I am free of life. I pound myself to dust again, so grant me thy pestle.Rise and raise the merciless claw, to crush this earthly vessel. Lucifer - LightbearerLucifer - King divineEosphoros - LightbearerEosphoros - Prince of mine Lucifer - LightbearerLucifer - shining oneEosphoros - LightbearerAngel of the burning sun
