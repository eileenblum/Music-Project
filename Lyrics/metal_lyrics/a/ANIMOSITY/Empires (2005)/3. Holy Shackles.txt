How can we grow if we are living in the past?
Where progression is condemned and life is only just a path
To an unknown unreal existence
Better yet how can anyone believe it?
You told me that Jesus loves us all but you sleep on the streets
You pray to god every night but your family can't eat.
I know you aren't stupid, so what are you doing?
It is not just yourself its the fucking world that it's screwing
His eternal love has bred an epidemic of hate
Killed off our free will and replaced it with fate
Until our seeds are born unpoisoned and uncontaminated
Future generations will only know miseducation
It's a scary situation when it's captured most of the entire fucking nation
I wish more than anything for society to change. Stop killing!
Stop dying over religion an relying on a god to feed their children
Living life without feeling
It's a degradation to humanity, to believe that we all subserviently accept a life of disease and wage slavery and they continue to teach kids their lives are out of their reach
The cyclical onslaught leaves a bloody red chord in the name of the imaginary almighty lord
Everyone is killing each other because god loves us all
There's no hope for change unless this bullshit falls
There can be no peace until we murder the lord
Religion is a drain on society, and has held us back for centuries
Countless acts of violence and atrocities
Committed in the name of a supreme being
Evolution means anti-religion, and until we get there society is living in a fucking prison
Because of an unsightly regressive history decorated with war
There can be no peace until we murder the lord
