Everything is fine did you really believe it
Sold to the nation. But just simply repeated
Could not imagine it was all their imagination
Indoctrination of a mere creation
Towering over the world
It's all for the safety of your family
But any further questions
Render you the new enemy
Its like war is peace
And freedom is slavery
Ignorance is strength and is treated as bravery
Payback for daddy
And all your buddies are happy
I won't believe the fucking lies
An Orwellian nightmare seem to be the times
I was marching in the streets because I saw the fucking signs
Of a worldwide onslaught to feed the giant
I will not believe the fucking lies
I can't take anymore news selling a product
Try to keep me quiet, I won't be silent
They told me to soak it up fast and join the national brainwash hastily
Pop back your prescription and god bless us all as the world goes fucking crazy
Pledge allegiance to the lies, and to the disguise
So we can dampen out the cries and let the bombs fly
To what ends must we contend?
Overpower, control in the name of defense
I don't know how the world is going to deal with it
Since we're stuck with another four years of this shit
Now they found your man but when will we see the final cost
And in the end, how many lives were lost
Not yours, or any of your peers
Tear our fucking families apart, and now for over a year
I would rather die, than to kill for you.
You fucking scumbag, FUCK YOU!!!
Sell it to the nation like it's the fucking superbowl
But I know not to play their role
I can't stomach another dose of their lies
Kill for this! Die for this! Even though the truth is right in front of your eyes
Lies
