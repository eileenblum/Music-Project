Wake up, Fight back, open your eyes and see that we are under attack
Take it for granted and they will take it all right back
Right back is where we are going, regression to the Dark Age
Open up our present lives and it's another fucking black page
Read between the lines and it's another black page
Prepare for the oncoming storm, the shadows will plagues this world for years
Social apocalypse from fucked up politics, prepare to be ruled
Welcome to the hell you have created, not even your lord approves
I hope you are all happy, but I want change or I want out
The association with this addiction is far too shameful for me to just smile
Acceptance is castration
Apathy is too difficult when disgust boils my blood
Welcome to a world eradicated of love
Soon I am going to explode
The cultural divide breeds believers of the lies
No solution on either side, just waiting for a change of tide
Chaos, all I see is madness, how the hell could anyone let this happen?
Cause when it's all fucked up, maybe they will realize that they're all stuck
Soon we're going to crawl back to living in a cave
Face the consequences because you dug your own grave
The setback and atrocities will be the markers of our age
The next chapter of our lives is just another black page
So here I am screaming, tired and ugly
Get the fuck off me, you can't fucking touch me
Wake up, Fight back, open your eyes and see we that we are under attack
Take it for granted and they will take it all right back
