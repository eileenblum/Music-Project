Pressure is building I'm gonna explode
I can't escape this self destructive mode
Hang in there it will be OK
I promise there will be a better day
I won't let you turn your back
We will struggle through the days
I cant watch you check out
On all the promises that you've made
I'm there for you all the time
I wish I could stop you from this better Crime
(Suicide)
I forced myself in, I locked myself out
Now I'm just another face in the crowd
That's not true you're one of a kind
Don't let this world pull you behind
Time are rough
I think I had enough
I've got to break from from the world's hand cuffs
I want wait until the fucking end
If you wont do it, I'll put a bullet in my head
Grab my hand for my last breath
As my tortured soul creates death
Hang in there it will be OK
I promise there will be a better day
The tears in my eyes wont me see what my own fucking mind is doing to me
I wish i could save you this needs to stop right now but all I can do is ask myself HOW
