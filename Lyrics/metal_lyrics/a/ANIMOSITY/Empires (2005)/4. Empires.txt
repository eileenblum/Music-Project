What the fuck
Petrified frozen
I can't believe it
I was wrong but what the fuck are they?
All 60 million of them
Remove my blindfold of optimism so I can feel the ignorance come alive
What is the appeal of deception and ignorance?
This is bigger than your front door, your gun
I cry for the work and every Fallujah that will ever happen in our future
To the rest of the work just know that we are sorry and that we care whether you live or die
Feels like I'm fighting against a brick wall and I can't help but feel like giving up
Come on... Wake up and see that there's some other shit going on!
It goes far beyond and unfortunately I learn that in this war I am just a pawn
There is no hope, seems like my only option is to not give a fuck an cope
Because when ignorance reigns it really rains blood in the rest of the world and at home we're still all fucked
Just take a look around, look at what we have become
I can't lie to myself I boil in disgust when confronted with what's real
And this time it was, but what about the rest of us, and those whole will die all because
So give in to the empire, let the bombs fly
I pledge allegiance to nothing
What is left to hope for?
When things continually get worse
And what is there to love, when I despise what I see happening I can't lie
To myself I can't love what I hate
I am sorry but you are failing me and you failed the entire fucking world
United they stand but divided we are
All spit on your name until the day that you fucking fall
