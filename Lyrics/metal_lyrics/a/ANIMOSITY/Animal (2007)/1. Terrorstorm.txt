There were lots of warnings, but somehow they couldn't see it.
The facts don't add up and I'll never believe in the spout of lies and deception.
Now we hand in our freedom for what they are calling protection.
A terrorized population and then look what happens to our administration.
Who benefits? Who benefits? Who really benefits from the world ablaze?
Welcome to the new American century where pearl harbor is right around the corner.
Even when airplanes are falling from the sky they are counting on the fact that we will never ask why.
Ask why it has come to this. So many lost.
Where was the most advanced line of defense in the world before the nation crashed down to the ground?
The war on terror is a hoax and we are all being lied to.
Act courageously. Fight the real enemy.
The greatest threat to our freedom is not terrorism, but what our government does to counter it and cover it up.
The inhumanity is repulsive.
Go beyond the sound bytes and oversimplified official report and open your eyes to a profit driven massacre.
Terrorstorm. It has happened all through out history.
Cover-ups and false flags used to deceive and mangle our hearts and minds into supporting war.
The time has come to stop using the flag as a blindfold, to stop waving our guns and our gods at the world.
We must seek truth and justice.
Take a close look and see that we the people are the victims of a violent terrorstorm.
Fight the real enemy.
