Today I dreamt of life on earth and I boarded a train ready for the world.
Descending on the streets where the sky is scraped and the crowds collect.
Confused and alone I try to find my way.
My heart beat as I chased my life through the street.
Walk with me.
Cold world, embrace me because I am lost in the chaos and I feel all alone.
Nothing to call my own.
I fell in love today and it was the best thing I ever felt.
No more confusion about who I am because this is who I want to be.
I woke up with a purpose and I laughed back at the crowds drowning in modern bullshit.
I planted a tree in front of my home and I can no longer see out of my window but it makes me smile just to watch it grow.
And I opened my eyes to the beautiful things that make my world spin around.
Today I heard that another hundred men were killed.
Many people joined me in dismay and we crowded the streets.
Today everything was taken from me, stripped down to nothing but a bag of bones.
Today I ripped out my heart out of my chest and I stamped it into the earth.
My face turned to raw bone and I danced with the stars.
And the pages stopped turning in my passionate journey.
They just couldn't tame him.
