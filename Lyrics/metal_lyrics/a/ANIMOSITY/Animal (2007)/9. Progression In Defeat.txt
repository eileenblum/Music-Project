Where are we now?
And where are we going?
In an era of seeming defeat, how do we find the strength to get back on our feet.
Because I know that we are never yet truly beat.
There has got to be hope.
Standing in the witch graveyard I have seen movement.
In the eye of a crumbling world where trust is nothing.
I search for hope for the ones that I love.
It's hard to look forward with each day collapsing.
I dig deep for the triumphant achievements in our history.
Or simply for the fact that no one in Salem was crushed to death with rocks today or burned alive.
Sometime, I have to ask where is the light in this world of darkness?
Progress is hiding in the cracks even when looking ahead seems like a series of mistakes.
I can see the beauty of failure in that we have got a second chance.
Standing over the witch's grave, I can see a change.
We have seen change.
In the eye of a crumbling world where trust is nothing.
It's hard to look forward with each day collapsing.
Hopelessness is getting tired and I want to come alive.
So I am going to strive for the best because dreams are what makes this world turn around.
Sometime, I have to ask where is the light in this world of darkness?
Progress is hiding in the cracks even when looking ahead seems like a series of mistakes.
I can see the beauty of failure in that we have got a second chance.
Standing over the witch's grave, I can see... Where are we now?
And where are we going?
In an era of seeming defeat, we look ahead for change to get back on our feet.
