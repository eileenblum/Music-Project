And on the day that I die, should it be soon...take this from me for clarification.
And when I come crashing, and it could be too soon, just know that I lived for change.
Don't take this the wrong way.
Sell all my shit and give the money to my brother.
Make sure Milo has a good home and a hill to run.
For now I know, that I could be next.
Just don't take this the wrong way.
I have not a deathwish but rather a less inaccurate understanding of what it means to be alive.
