Your temporal passion
With your plastic reaction
Make me reconsider
My feelings for you
A heart made of gold
But obviously cold
It's all been sold
And there are more than just a few
So excited to see me
But I know the truth
Your phony behavior
Has no use
Materials are what your made of
It flows in your fake blood
As your Styrofoam heart
Pumps greed through your veins
Real people live in pain
Buried in the remains
Of a society with built on fame
I know it will never be the same
Fake blood
It is so fucking fake
If only you could take
A look at who you are
From a new point of view
I am not deceived
The beauty I believed was within a kind heart
Has no place in you
