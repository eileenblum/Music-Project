Every day
I fall
Through the cracks
Deeper and deeper
Slipping
Straying to obliteration
(Please help me)
Self Destructive
Gray skies
Only one thing
To look for hope
From a state of confusion
To a reminiscent lonely depression
I fall
Like a bullet to the head
Thoughts shot full force
Overcoming, excluding
Existence frozen
Left searching for sanctity
Or at least a moment of truth
I can't clear my mind
I can't take a look inside
I don't know what the fuck to do
This could happen to you
Attempted Exodus
Nowhere to run
Come on!!
