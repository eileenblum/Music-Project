Endless waste
Seething pain
Brought by greed
From the virtues of mans reign
Counting minutes to seconds
From the fingertips of the slain
Born to death, soldiers of pain
Soon will become now
As time disappears
No words left to be spoken
Just a planet of tears
We no longer wait for our pleasures to gain
But rather to be saved
What have we done
To deserve this cold and bleak domain
Instead of life we are born not to live
But for slavery
Born for slavery
Follow my path
Follow my path to the decline of humanity
Counting minutes to seconds as we loose our sanity
