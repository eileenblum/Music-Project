Straight from my heart
I will never believe in you
Believe in what you say
Everything that comes
Out of your mouth
Is forced upon
Forced upon my name
I will never trust you
I will never have faith in you
I will never love you
Until I'm standing over your grave
I can't be saved
I cannot be saved
How can you give a fuck about me
But you don't know what I've been through
You don't know ten minutes of my life
So I wont waste my time with you
Your ways are too corrupt
A fucking book cannot break us
We don't want your afterlife
So stay the fuck away from us
