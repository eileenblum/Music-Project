It takes two thousand years
To prove to ourselves we can
We can handle
But some things we just can't make
When will this hatred overcome
Every three billion souls
It counts on all of us
But it's not fair
Its just not fair
To the world and her innocence
We tear each other into pieces
One by one we fall
Bound back by leashes
How many thousand years will it take
To replace earths gift of life
I only think we have to win and we have to sacrifice
Innocence shed her blood for the evil to drink
We stand upon the brink
