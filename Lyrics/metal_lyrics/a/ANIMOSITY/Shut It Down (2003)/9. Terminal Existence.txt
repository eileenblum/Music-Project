Drown me in your misery
Don't shroud your problems over me
I watched your presence fade away
Now you're gone and that's OK
False friendship never seems to stay
But true brotherhood always remains
Worthless life
Better off dead
Accusation lost
Hatred fed
I was down for you and you were down for me
I watched our friendship die, so clear to see
But for those of you who still remain
Our friendship will be unslain
Worthless life, better off dead
