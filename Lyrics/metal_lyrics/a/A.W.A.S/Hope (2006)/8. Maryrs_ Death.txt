[lyrics: martin, music: martin, a.w.a.s.]

Are you ready â¦
ready to be cast out
ready to be beaten
ready to be in pain
ready to be killed
are you ready to be martyrized

or would you turn - would you mourn?
there is one thing you have to learn!

He was readyâ¦
ready to be cast out
ready to be beaten
ready to be tortured
ready to be butchered
he was ready to be sacrificed

Behold; to live is Christ,
and to die is gain!
[(Mat.19,21-22) (Phil.1,21)]
