[lyrics: ruben wedel, martin, music: a.w.a.s.]

Don't know what I was asking for so long.
Don't know were I was running so fast.
I heard the answers but I hadn't listen to.
Trying to be apart and playing at two sides.

Hold me up, when all seems to break.
Give me peace, when my life is a war.
Your love never fails me, you're true to the end.
Saved by Jesus, my loving best friend.

Living with him is like a journey home.
The Lord carries me out of this lives darkness,
and washes my sins away.
He loves me even if turn away.

Keep me warm, when my love grows cold.
Stand by me, when I feel alone.
Your love never fails me, you're true to the end.
Saved by Jesus, my loving best friend.
