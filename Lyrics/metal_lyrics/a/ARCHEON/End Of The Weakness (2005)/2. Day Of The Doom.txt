The day will split with the night
Heavy fog will cover them tight
Sinister moonlight will be bright again....
Northern wind will overblow the land
Like a fucking wave from hell
And the angels will fall down
To the ground, unholy ground...

Day of the doom,
will destroy me and you
And all the lives on earth...
Day of the doom
Apocalypse

Screams of millions
of suffering souls
And laughter of all those
Who began that years ago...
Then there will begin
something strange
That will touch us and lands
Leaving everything lifeless...

Day of the doom,
will destroy me and you
And all the lives on earth...
Day of the doom
Apocalypse
