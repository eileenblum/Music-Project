In the night she comes to me,
when I dream about her
Beauty angel in the black coat
is taking my last breath
Then I'm feeling like I'm falling down
to the grave of my world
There is almost everything
But I can see nothing!!!

Queen of the Night
Queen of the Life

Then I'm walking in her arms,
and I can't see her smile
Her deadly-white skin is touching mine,
I know... end is near
Something cold from her eyes
is freezing me inside
Then she' telling me: "Taste My Scythe..."
Oh, yeah, I will

Queen of the Night
Queen of the Life
