The death was there across the sky
Heavy rain in the darkest night
I saw desire in her eye's
So I left the place
Where she kept on calling me..
....just me

Had to stop covered tight
Looking back upon the fields
Her eyes are again on me..

I am scared
But I have to stay...and fight

I will take the steel
Somehow I will win
With you...you whore!

The death was there across the sky
Heavy rain in the darkest night
I saw desire in her eyes

I am scared
But I have to stay...and fight

I will take the steel
Somehow I will win
With you...you whore!

Tough to win  But mustn't die
Calling for you  Stand up and fight
Take you steel, let's fight for all
With this attitude we shouldn't fall
