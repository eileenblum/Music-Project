I cannot fight without sacrifice
My mission is to be...just be...just to be...
I am walking through the path with pain
But for me It's too late.. to surrender... to fail

I'm on my way to my final glory
Polyrhytmia Please send me gods!

Hundreds of shadows and ghosts
Have been trying to push me down...
to the ground... into my grave
But still I stand I am stronger and stronger
Than them, the enemies will be slain!!
