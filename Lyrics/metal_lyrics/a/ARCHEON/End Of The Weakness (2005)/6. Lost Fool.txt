Day by day and night after night
I've tried to get into your heart...
Your shelter is hate for other lives
Now I'm sure that you're the one!!!

You (!) are made by the damned
By The Kingdom of the damned
And now You will die..die..die..die
by my hand!!

You didn't think about that all
When They were spoiling your soul
You were so proud, but you've had to know
You've signed the deal of your death!!!
So...die now!

You (!) are made by the damned
By The Kingdom of the damned
And now You will die..die..die..die
by my hand!!
