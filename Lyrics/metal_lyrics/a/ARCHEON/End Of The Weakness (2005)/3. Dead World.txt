Years of thinking have passed by
But now I know what is wrong
Human - Machine

The people are in coma since their were born
Fatal power has taken their souls away
And the world is blind for the human fate

All I see it's dead world
And I know that's our fault
Living Absent minded

I know the final countdown has begun
And the human race is going to die
But we have to fight for our life

So get your sword and shield as well
Arm to arm we will fight for our lives
Don't you know we've got to win

All I see it's dead world
And I know that's our fault
Living Absent minded
