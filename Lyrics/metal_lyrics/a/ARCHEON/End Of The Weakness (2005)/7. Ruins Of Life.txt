Awakened in the darkest night
I'm waiting for the Light
Nightly colours slowly fading out

Searching for the strings of light
Coming from the bloody skies
Elusive need of mind

Awakened in the darkest night
With death by my side

Ruins of life
Gather your might
Ruins of the life!!!

And in this eternal fight
When the reaper tears me apart
Have to catch the glimpse of light

Walking through the ruins of live
I must find the endless might
'Cause I don't want to die...

And in this eternal fight
Only strong will survive

Ruins of life
Gather your might
Ruins of the life!!!
