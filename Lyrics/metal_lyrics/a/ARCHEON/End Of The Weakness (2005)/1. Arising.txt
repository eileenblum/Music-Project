Magic mirror on the wall please tell me now Why we fall?
Looking back upon a time human race has fallen down
To destruction, chaos and hate - we can change it, it's not too late
We just must gather all, standing up, we shouldn't fall

So gather now
We are going to fight
In the name of our...Arising!

Sadness and darkness that is all I can see
Arising that is all for we should believe
So crush your fright I'll be with you
Using our wisdom we are ready to do (it)
You must know it so I also say enough victim enough pain
We just must gather all, standing up, we shouldn't fall

So gather now
We are going to fight
In the name of our...Arising
