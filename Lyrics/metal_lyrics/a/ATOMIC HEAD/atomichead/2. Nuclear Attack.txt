Nuclear Attack
Comes from the sky!
The iron birds
Drop seeds of death

Bombs of Napalm
Are coming down!!
Your evil soul
Wonât stop the madness

[CORO:]
All dead!
Victimized by violence
All dead!
Spilling blood of innocents
All dead!
Victimized by ignorance
All dead!
Victimsâ¦ of hate!

Bombs of Napalm
Are coming down
When you less expect
They`ll bomb your town

Supremacy
Of killer lies
And they donât care
When a man dies!!

[CORO]

Now there`s all done
Many people died
He pulled the plug
But he`s safe and warm

They`ll live in fear
They`ll live in pain
When a man is killed
Everyone are raped!!

[CORO:]
All dead!
Victimized by violence
All dead!
Spilling blood of innocents
All dead!
Victimized by ignorance
All dead!
Victimsâ¦

All dead!
Victimized by violence
All dead!
Spilling blood of innocents
All dead!
Victimized by ignorance
All dead!
Victimsâ¦ of hate
