In this days of anger and hate
When no one is really safe
There`s a man who can change your fate
No matter what you say

He don`t care of soiling his hands with your blood
He don`t care if you`re living your hell
He`s the sinner. He`s the sinner

The final doom is coming soon
It`s closer than you`ve ever thought
There`s a man who can kill us all
Just by dicting his command

I won`t tell you his name but he`s right after you
If you turn you can see his face
He`s the sinner. He`s the sinner

So you`re the man who everyone talks
Why should I be scared?
You have your people on tenterhooks
but not me, no sir!

When you came, you`ll hear the screamin` of hate
With angerâ¦ I will rip your face
You`re the sinner. You`re the sinner

Do you think you can save your soul
when you hit a man against the wall?
When you hold your fist up to the sky
then you know that someone`s gonna dieâ¦

Now you`re through in a wheelchair
With a breathing machine
You look old, so sad and undone
No one will fear you now!

I won`t tell you his name but he`s close enough
If you turn you`ll see his ugly face, a sinner who`s living his hell
He`s the sinner. He`s the sinner
