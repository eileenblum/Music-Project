In a war you are
Sentenced to die
By a bullet of a gun
Menaced by the knife
of your enemy
trying to kill... you!!

Here comes the pain
your chest turns to red
now say goodbye
Your last breath
is your last hope
to live

Why you think you're going to survive?
don't you know you're destiny is to die?

Sentenced you are
Sentenced to die

Now you remember
your better times
of your life
The smile of your child
the love of your wife
come back to your mind.

Why you think you're going to survive?
don't you know you're destiny is to die?

Sentenced you are
Sentenced to die

Here comes the pain
your chest turns to red
now say goodbye
Your last breath
is your last hope
to live
