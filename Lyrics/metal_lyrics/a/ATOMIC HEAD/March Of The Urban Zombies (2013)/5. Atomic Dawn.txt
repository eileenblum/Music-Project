Earth's last day / I wake up by / some serious shit outside
Noise of bombs / skinless ones / this ain't a nightmare
I can't believe / too loud for me / the screams, the suffering, the heat
Zero time / the final day / the devil shows his head

Tomorrow will be atomic dawn
Forever ATOMIC DAWN
Victory's now just a joke
Forever it's ATOMIC DAWN

Earth's last day / I don't know / if I'll live to see dawn again
Cannot die / can't wake up / from this nightmare
Hiroshima / Chernobyl / now for world is the turn to blast
Say your prayers / kiss your kids / there's no tomorrow again

Tomorrow will be atomic dawn
Forever ATOMIC DAWN
Tomorrow's just a strange word
Forever it's ATOMIC DAWN

[Solo: SEb]

Earth's last day / zero time / look at what we've done
On the streets / skinless ones / troops of hatred
666 / on their brows / the reign of evil has now begun
Hate led us / to our own / self destruction

Tomorrow will be atomic dawn
Forever ATOMIC DAWN
We slept at the swing of the bomb
Forever... ATOMIC DAWN!!
