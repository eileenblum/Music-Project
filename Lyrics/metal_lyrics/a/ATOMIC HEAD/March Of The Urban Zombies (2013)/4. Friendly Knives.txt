Bottles of pills appear before my eyes
Vodka and cigarettes were my last lunch
I can't remember what I did last night
I only know I just wanted to die

[Chorus]
Will my life end this way?
In disgrace I made myself
Is this world enough for me?
Friendly knives all I see

Broken bottles tried to cut my flesh
On my wrists there's blood, but I feel no pain
Everywhere I see there's something red
I'm so doped I can feel no shit

[Chorus]

[Solo: Luis / SEb]

Every night is the same old shit
My body died but my spirit's still awake
I should have known I wouldn't go to hell
Eternal wander... it's my fate.

How did my life end this way?
This disgrace I made myself
Was this world a bitch to me?
Friendly knives... all I need!!
