Harder than everything
Crushing your brain with your skull
Causing your inner pain
Like a cancer in your bones
Faster than ever now
If you try to escape, then you're done.

Poison us, strangle us
Break our bones, we'll be back for more!

[Solo: Luis]

Now! it's payback time for me
No one's gonna hear you scream
Liar! you said your love was real
Cut it out!!!

[Solo: SEb]

HATE invades my mind
And the crap you made me believe
ANGER possessed my heart
So full of hatred and greed
FEAR, the beginning of pain
And the way you have for success
A BULLET to your head
Will finally put you to rest
