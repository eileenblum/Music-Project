They're just like cattle, watch them march
Home to work, work to home, without a life
No joy in their faces, no hope or fate
Trapped in the rat race, there's no escape

URBAN ZOMBIES!! They're everywhere
Don't let your life end that way
Ignorance is their ally
URBAN ZOMBIES!! Watch them march

You live your life ruled by a boss
He chose your fate, your time, your home
The best wife his money could buy
No bright in your eyes, just a scary stare

URBAN ZOMBIES!! They're everywhere
They'll feed your mind with emptiness
And on the news, they'll eat your brain
URBAN ZOMBIES!! Watch them march

Don't watch the T.V. or they'll suck your soul
Propaganda - Mind Control
Urban zombies, watch them march
I've seen puppets more alive
