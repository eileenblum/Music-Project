Nuclear attack comes from the sky!
The iron birds drop seeds of death
Bombs of Napalm are coming down!!
Your evil soul won't stop the madness

[Chorus:]
ALL DEAD!!
Victimized by violence
Spilling blood of innocents
Victimized by ignorance
Victims... of hate!

Bombs of Napalm are coming down
When you least expect they'll bomb your town
Supremacy of killer lies
And they don't care when a man dies!!

[Chorus]

[Solos: Luis / SEb]

Now there's all done, many people died
He pulled the plug but he's safe and warm
They live in fear, they live in pain
When a man is killed everyone is raped!!

[Chorus x2]
