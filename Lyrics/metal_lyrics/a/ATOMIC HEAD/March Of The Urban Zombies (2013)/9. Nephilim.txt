Secret society - the ruler of mankind
Is now deciding your fate
Day by day

Reduct the population
Mankind must come to an end
They're exterminating the people
One by one

[Chorus:]
Now that the day has come
Evil now rules the world
Cruel and slow ways of death
Taking your life...

Chemtrails, pestilence, figures in the sky
Taking away your chance
To survive

And the politicians
The people that we chose
They lie and betray and deceive
And stab your back!!!

[Chorus]

Taking your life... away!!!

[Solo: Luis P]

Nephilim - Ruler of mankind
ID Chip - The way to control your life
Hypocrats - Their words are only lies
Antichrist - The king of Greece shall rise
[Daniel 8:21]
