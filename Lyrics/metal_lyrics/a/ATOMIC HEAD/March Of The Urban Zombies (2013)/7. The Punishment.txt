Welcome to the slaughterhouse
Why don't you come through?
Here sinners are punished
And innocents, too

They will twist your neck
They will burn your flesh
They will rip your face
And they... will kick your ass!

Welcome to my fairytale
Where you are a character more
Axes, chains, knives and thorns
And your body, of course, are my toys

I will stretch your arms
I will break your legs
I will smash your back
I will crush your head

[Solo: SEb]
[Fills: SEb / Luis / SEb / Luis]

I hope you had fun
I'm glad you liked my games
Now your blood is starting to dry
Game over!! Let's start again

I will open your head
I will split your brains
I will drink your blood
The punishment... is done!!

[Solo: Luis]
