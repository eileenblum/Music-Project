Get ready for war
Daddy's proud, your mother weeps
just sixteen years old
you live or die, I just don't care

You're just another sword
defend your land, give us your life
the nicest sacrifice
your virgin body is dying now

I WANT YOU
Kill the enemy or he'll kill you
When you die, your family gets a flag

Your country needs you, boy
Duty calls, the honor codes
you're falling in disgrace
I don't give a shit, you're just a slave

You're military now
you look so cool in your uniform
stop wasting your life
books are for the weak, and you're a man

I WANT YOU
Hate the other, kill the rest
Your country is proud
you gave us your blood
When you die...
you just fuckin' die

[Solos: Seb / Luis]

I want you
