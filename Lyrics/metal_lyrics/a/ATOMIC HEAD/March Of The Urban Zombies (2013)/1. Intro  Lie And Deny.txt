[Intro]

Each and every morning, millions of urban zombies invade the streets all over the world, struggling to make it through another day.
They lie and deny about their pathetic excuse for a life.
While some of them see friendly knives as the end of the path, others see an atomic dawn as the definite solutionâ¦
The ruler of mankind thinks of the option of a nuclear attack to release them from their daily punishment.
They want you to be a part of the mind slavery, but there's another way, it's time to get the arms... it's payback time!!

[LIE AND DENY]

Pay your deeds on earth, the people you stabbed
And the children you raped
They tasted the blade of your knife, you ate them alive
But now it's your time

[Chorus:]
Every word you say
Every tear you sweat
Anything you pray
Is a walking step to the chair
LIE AND DENY!! LIE AND DENY!!

They're stretching the rope, they're loading the chair
Let your neck be prepared
They sharpen the axe as you lie and deny
But your death is a fact

Every word you say
Every lie you swear
Anything you pray
Is a walking step to your death

[Solos: Luis /  SEb / Luis / SEb]

[Chorus]

LIE AND DENY!!

[Ending solo: Luis]
