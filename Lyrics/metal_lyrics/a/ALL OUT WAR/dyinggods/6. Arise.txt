[originally by Amebix]Well, we've all heard the sermon
Seen the preachers or worshipped the stage
Heard the new manifesto? It's all questions, no solutions at all
Well, you're out on your own now
Always have been, just look at your "friends"
Break the surface to daylight
Strength will flow through our unity

There is a traitor in our midst
And when we rise we will be betrayed
They are the wolves in sheeps clothing
Taking place at the back of the flock
All this talk about freedom, will be tainted with blood (it's your life)
Put this cross on your back, child
Tread the long weary trail to the top of the hill

Arise!
Get off your knees
Arise!
Get off your knees, get off, your knees

There's some hard times coming down
There is the smell of revolution on the wind
Well, we're grinding our axes
Telling tales around the bonfire at night
We will set out with a fire in our hearts
When this darkness gives way to the dawn
In the light we united as one
For the kingdom of heaven must be taken by storm

Arise!
Get off your knees
Arise!
Get off your knees, get off, your knees

Arise! [4x]
