Pray for salvation. The end of time is now at hand. War machines devour the masses. The human race shall now be damned. Fall of the self righteous. They shall drown in filth. Drenched in the blood of the innocent. Victims of our own free will. Legions of sinners bathe in the blood of the weak. Worship the dollar - creation lies in defeat. The world is falling. Victims of liars and thieves. Take for their own ends and bow at the altar of greed. Welcome to the end. I embrace the coming of damnation. The fall of Babylon, and the end of a worthless creation. Extermination - destroyed the world by our own hands. Coming of the fires, and the fall of modern man. I await the flames of hell to consume the earth. The beast is loose upon the earth. The cleansing of the human birth. Destroy the cancer - the cancer of the human race. A disease that feeds on the weak and exploits religious faith. Unleash Armageddon, and the prophecies of fire. Vengeance from the heavens. Final days of the liars. Witness Armageddon, witness the fall of man. Cleansing fires from the heavens. Humanity's final stand. I'll watch this world fall, and I'll bask in its defeat. I'll shed not one tear. Punishment for all the greed.
