Our world is burning as demons control the earth. Political killers, they strip us of all we are worth. Condemned us to fire, the masses are thrown into the flames. Apathy has destroyed us, but we search for someone else to blame. The beast is upon us. The final days in the age of lies. Witness to apocalypse as the blood falls. The blood of heaven. The blood of angels fall. The kings of the earth, in their quest for power have condemned us all.
