"Death be not proud
Though some have called thee Mighty and dreadfull
For, thou art not so
Though soonest our best men with thee goe
Rest of their bones, and soules deliverie
For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow
Die not, poore death,
Nor canst thou kill me"

Immolation
An immoral sacrifice
Martyrs of deception
The cross of the crucified
Seeking out the truth of forever
And drowning in the flames of lies
Embrace the prophets of deception
And watch the innocent die
Suffering
And die for your lord
Martyrs still feel the pain
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
Infidels are to blame
Fire meets fire
As war is waged
Where is your God as you burn?
Paradise fades to black
No rewards now you learn
Slaves to devotion
Their faith makes them blind
Purify the sinner
The servants to the kingdom of lives
Bow to your savior
But your savior was born in lies
Faith has been corrupted
To kill for God is not divine
The slaughter of the innocent
And the rape of the weak
Is this divinity?
Is this the kingdom you seek?
Faith has been afflicted
The righteous have been deceived
They shall find
There is nothing but enemies
And on their alters
The weak shall bleed
Their Gods they have fallen
Their martyrs have gone in vain
These are the children of deception
They are lost
Condemned and shamed
Bow to your savior
But your savior was born in lies
Faith has been corrupted
To kill for God is not divine
The slaughter of the innocent
And the rape of the weak
Is this divinity?
Is this the kingdom you seek?
