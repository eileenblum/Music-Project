At the gates of Babylon
The tyrant has returned
Rising from the depths
Through blood he is reborn
Feasting on sin
He bathes in desease
The son of perdition
Is he who decieves
To the gates of Babylon
He has returned
Monuments will fall
As he takes his throne
He is the man of sin
And under him
Nations will fall
He is the father of lies
And at his feet
Kings shall crawl
Ten nations will serve his greed
And he will be glorified in his deceit
Ruling through deception
He feeds on arrogance
The deceived will fall in line
For they are victims
In deceit he is glorified
