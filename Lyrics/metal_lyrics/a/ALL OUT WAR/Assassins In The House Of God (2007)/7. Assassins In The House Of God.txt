"I am the devil
And I am here to the devils work"

Bow to those who destroy
As they preach salvation
Condemn the weak to burn
In the flames of nations
Born into fire and a legacy of lies
These are men of murder
And the prophets of demise
Demonic priests
These are devils of the cloth
Which holds salvation
The crescent or the cross?
Assassins in the house of God
Are slaughtering the weak
Two thousand years of suffering
The masses lie in defeat
It's the dawn of a new apocalypse
And the fields of Meggido will burn
Holy men are preaching murder
How well their children have learned
In the name of God
They destroy the weak
In the name of God
They destroy the weak
Unleash the war machines
In the name of God
Burning of nations
For the crescent and the cross
Holy Wars for vengeance
And we all shall feel the loss
Hideous behavior
And no one wins when all is lost
Everyone is a victim
When we are all to blame
There is no comfort
There is we're all to blame
Bow to those who destroy
As they preach salvation
Condemn the weak to burn
In the flames of nations
In the name of vengeance
And in the name of God
The world's cities are burning
And what once was
Now is gone
Assassins have conquered nations
And set the world ablaze
Conspiracies and treason
Have created victims
Of our own blind faith
There shall be no redemption
As armies of the righteous have failed
Tyranny of religious zealots
On their holy cross we are nailed
