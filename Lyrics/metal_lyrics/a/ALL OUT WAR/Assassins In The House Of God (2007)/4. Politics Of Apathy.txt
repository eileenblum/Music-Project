Wage war for vengeance
Decieve
Control through fear
Subdue the massases
And convince them the end is near
Destroy the innocent
And all will hail deception's hand
Silence is deafening
And the weak shall be damned
Empower those who deceive
And watch them rise
From thieves to kings
As they ascend
We crumble and fall
We are powerless
Against the coming new dawn
How many victims shall die for peace?
Seeking salvation but drown in apathy
Thousands of corpses shall rot in vain
The casaualties
They fall for corporate gains
Wage war for vengeance
Decieve
Control through fear
Subdue the massases
And convince them the end is near
Destroy the innocent
And all will hail deception's hand
Silence is deafening
And the weak shall be damned
