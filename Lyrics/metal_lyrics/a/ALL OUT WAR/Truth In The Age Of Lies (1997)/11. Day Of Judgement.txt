There shall come a time when this earth shall cease, the end of mankind, this world will be at peace, brought on by greed, this day will soon be here, from this hatred we're free, the hand of doom is now near, great wall of fire, who shall live, who shall die, no escape from the fire, our existance is a lie, point out who's to blame, no answer, it's too late, man's destiny up in flames, look around, we are all blame.
