In the beginning we tried but nothin turned out right, fall victim each time to man's nature of brutal fight, Through the years we've learned, expect the worse, you'll be safe, ma's destined to burn in this land of hate, Live life in a rage, that's what life's all about, this world is a cage and noone hears your shouts, Destined to Burn, As I stare down into this mass grave of humanity, I never knew I'd end up this way, I'll try to shed a tear from my eyes but I can't because my mind is filled with hate.
