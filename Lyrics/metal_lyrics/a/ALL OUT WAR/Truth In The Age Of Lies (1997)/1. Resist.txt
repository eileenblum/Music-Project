Resist the temptation of power that can only keep you down. Greed- the chains that we are bound. Neglect- we fail to see what's lost. Extinction- is the final cost. Greed- a disease of man, bring us down to our knees. Armageddon- thrust upon us, but we're too blind to see. Senseless- quest for power, only a quest in lies. Feeding- off eachother's misery, how many have to die? Searching, for salvation, it's right before our eyes. Drowning, in a sea of neglect, stocked with countless lies. Realized, if we faced demise, it's all by our own hand. Power, lies inside, rise up and take a stand. Take and take, never give until there's nothing left. Innocent, their suffering, declining but no one seems to care. Greed- the path leads nowhere. Falling as, we tear this world apart, innocence lost, corrupted from the start. Losing time, until there's nothing left, take and take, with no regret, who's to blame? Who takes the fall? Greed of man- it effects us all. Searching, for salvation, it's right before our eyes. Drowning, in a sea of neglect, stocked with countless lies. Realized, if we faced demise, it's all by our own hand. Power, lies inside, rise up, and take a stand.
