Angel, why do you suffer?
Are they worthy of your pain?
Angel, Why give comfort?
When time and again you have been betrayed
Compassion has been wasted
Why show concern for their fate?
Serving you enemies, you serve and you grieve
Salvation, you grant them peace
Yet they will watch you bleed
Why bless you enemies?
These are enemies of faith
They are not worthy
Damn them in disgrace
Angel, why must you suffer?
Why show devotion to thieves?
Cast them in fire and watch these demons as they bleed
