Fear through divinity, from a blood red throne
Faith based manipulation, sinners throwing stones
Blinded obedience in a age of distrust
Suffer the children, these are victims of the unjust
Claiming divinity
Claiming to serve the Lord
Claiming the crown of the righteous
Preaching peace
Yet bringing war
In our time of need they will exploit and they will deceive
They leave us to suffer as they bathe in our defeat
We are blinded by deception
We are abandoned and crucified
Through empty promises they will hide their lies
On my knees I pray to my God to strike them down
Divine retribution, burn their idols to the ground
Annihilation will bring solace and peace
Send a destroyer to let the torment cease
