Have we not yet reached the point of defiance?
Or are we just blind to what lies ahead?
A race to extinction and we've been conditioned to trust
the deceit we have been fed
Without hesitation we are lost in acceptance
The truth is only to fear
A dead revolution wrapped in confusion
Can't we see that the end time grow near
Polluting our minds while corrupting the masses 
As we accept injustice and all that it brings
With no solutions we sit back and feed our delusions
By seeking material things
Seek out the righteous before we fall to all this greed
We are lost in compliance and neglect brings us to our knees
There is no one innocent
We all must seek truth
We must reject this system and push away the lies of our youth
