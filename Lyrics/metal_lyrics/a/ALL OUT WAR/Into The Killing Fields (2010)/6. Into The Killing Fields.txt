Defiance be thy name
An enemy of the state
Standing in resistance
Seeing through the charade
Why must we always fall in line
Assimilate to fit the mold
Patriotic under class
To a revolution that grows cold
Why race to sacrifice
Why feed on a web of lies
Death based addictions
Resistance will not be televised
Humanity - enslaved, drenched in lies
Degeneration - prayers to an empty sky
Materialistic - choking on all this filth
Contamination - products of our own free will
Exalted images, we love ourselves more than our gods
Bow down to progress, in our own filth we'll rot
Into the killing fields, silence fuels the war machines
End game solution, killing time, killing dreams
Bow down to progress
Conform and stand in line
Servants to our demigods
Choking on their lies
Means of deception, blindly follow state sponsored suicide
Never to consider the ones who are left behind
