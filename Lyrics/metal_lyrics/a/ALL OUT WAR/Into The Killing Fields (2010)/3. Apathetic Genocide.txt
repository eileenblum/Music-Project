Slaves to the self-righteous
The ones who we place in control
Those who we follow in blind sacrifice
The tyranny in which we uphold
Force fed illusions, poisoned tongues that poison minds
Rotting from the bottom and we the fools follow blind
On the wings of damnation the fools follow blind
Onward strait towards extinction
Empty promises will bring our demise
The system it has failed
It rots and it erodes
Burning through mass corruption our silence always answers the cold
With our kings we shall falter
We are to lost to fear
They feed of our silence
The end time is growing near
Tools of aggression, apathetic genocide
Like lambs to the slaughter
What once was is now left behind
Consumers who are death addicted
Servants to our kingdom of lies
Architects of our own destruction
Always searching but we never can find
With our blind allegiance we follow the regime
Their empty promises give us comfort
In submission we bow on our knees
Slaughter of the innocent ones, we watch them as they burn
Blinded by our own consumption
Apathetic we show no concern
We ignore them as they suffer
We live content in shallow lives
Propaganda reassures us
We hide their cries
