Send us an angel of mercy to destroy and devour, to cleanse and to purify and rid us of corrupt power
Send us a mercy killer now, to feed upon disgrace
Send us a mercy killer now to bring down the human race
Killing in an act of cleansing, in the name of mercy, destroying human envy
Enemies, burn with me, suffer with me, in apathy
