Gaze to the lost forgotten eyes, of those lost in man's demise, innocent but still they fall, condemned by us all. Sometimes the means isn't justified, by the ends of those that we crucify, we pray to God with blood on our hands, when we live by the laws of modern man. For those who were crucifed, we shall drown in flames, all their pain and suffering, and we're all to blame. For those we crucify, this world is lost, innocent and future children, will pay the final cost. In fear we pray to the higher force, while we lived our lifes with no remorse. In the fear and mercy in which we seek, but was mercy on the soft and weak, our lives now fade to the past, but our influence will always last. For those who were crucifed, we shall drown in flames, all their pain and suffering, and we're all to blame. For those we crucify, this world is lost, innocent and future children, will pay the final cost.
