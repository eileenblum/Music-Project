Searching, for the truth, dismissing, dismissing these lies of my youth. It's time, to get 'em back, this ways ain't working and that's a fact. This world, has lost its way, lost its mind- in disarray. I'm trapped in disbelief, of a modern world, in misery. Searching for the truth, in the age of lies. Searching for the truth, in the age of lies. Progression, regression, it's all the same, if our progress is done in vain. We're living and dying in an age of doubt, and there's not much time to figure it out. And we can't give in. Bow down- humanity. Gotta find a way, or face insanity. Searching for the t ruth, in the age of lies. Searching for the truth, in the age of lies. Searching, for the truth, dismissing, dismissing these lies of my youth. It's time, we get 'em back, this ways ain't working and that's a fact
