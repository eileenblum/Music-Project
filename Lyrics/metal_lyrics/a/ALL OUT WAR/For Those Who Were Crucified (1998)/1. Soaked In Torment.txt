Soaked in torment, victim of lies, materialistic, lost in demise. I reject your values, I have my own faith, I have no trust, in the human race. Seek the truth, ignore all the ignorance, that they shove down your throats. This world serves to corrupt, and to poison your soul. My strength and my honor, lies within my faith. I can find no acceptance, for the human race, show me your solutions, and you'll prove you wrong. These lies, greed, and corruption have gone on too long.

I can find no acceptance, for the human race, show me your solutions, and you'll prove you wrong. These lies, greed, and corruption have gone on too long. Can't stop the pain!
