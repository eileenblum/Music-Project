Seasons in decay, ambassadors of filth, mourn the fallen angels, victims of free will. Can you feel the torment deep within your heart? Can you feel the torment as we tear this world apart? Seasons burn in the flames of neglect, as we feed our desires. Embracing a false sense of hope, placing faith in the liars. Annihilation is freedom, from the lies and deceit, salvation lies far behind, the answers we seek. Eradicate the cancer that infects the Earth. A poisoned creation to relive a worthless birth. Set free the beasts that we hide inside, annihilation, freedom is demise. We were the chosen, but we chose to neglect, apocalyptic visions, nothing more to infect. Seasons in decay, ambassadors of filth, mourn the fallen angels, victims of free will.
