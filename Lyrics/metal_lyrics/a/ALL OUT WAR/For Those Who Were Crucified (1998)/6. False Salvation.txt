I will not suffer, bound by these chains. To quest for posessions, that can never be obtained. Ignorance won't conquer me, I won't be a slave. Can't hide the torment within your gains. I see this world, for what it is. You, live, your life, trapped in constant suffering, to acheive perfection, bound by desire's chains. Entombed in torturous envy, lost for material gains. Seeking a false salvation, empty promises fill your find. Striving, but never acheiving, the life you'd thought you'd find: suffocation, ignorant lust, a false salvation, that turns to dust. I will not suffer, bound by these chains. To quest for posessions, that can never be obtained. Ignorance won't conquer me, I won't be a slave. Can't hide the torment within your gains. I pledge no allegiance, to the lies of humanity. I won't be a victim, to your pitiful destiny. Lost in the search for salvation, and a false sense of worth. Seek to acheive wor ldly desires, to be the kings, the kings of this Earth. Self righteous, selfish creation, imprisoned in greed. Arrogance the key to your suffering, to obtain worthlessness
