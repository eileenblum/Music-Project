embodiment of dreams
desire of weak and strong
enslaved y the holy
decepted by ourselves
thanksgiving to master of sin
and foreverbliss...
thanksgiving to master of sin
and foreverbliss...

[lead: D.]

negation of holiness
crouching maggots of sin
pleasure brings their touch
fulfilment means their presence

purity becomes filth
meaning is lost somewhere
nothing can destroy sinful ecstasy

[lead: Bart]

and gift of sin from the abyss
thanksgiving to master of sin
and foreverbliss...
thanksgiving to master of sin
and foreverbliss...

thank Satan for this unholy gift
spit in face of holy fools
strong will means your power
armed with sin we will never fall !
