stand the existence pain
watch the demise...
of god's son long time slain
nothingness is the aim...
all hope becomes sorrow
silence falls like fog...
a promise of grim tomorrow

lost is meaning of your life
it is time to sharpen knife
feel the joy of mutilation
sacred laws' desecration

[lead: D.]

blood dripping from a blade
painting all red...
the beast picture ever made
lost are feelings...
of compassion and tolerance
but fuck it !!!
pain is your deliverance
