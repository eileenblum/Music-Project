Armageddon is now at sight
horned lord casts his spell
cover world with the endless night
from the open gates of Hell

[lead: D.]

dead rise from the ground
to show devil's unholy might
unchain Hell's black hound
in last rays of the dying light

it's final hour of humanity
Christian faith crushed to dust
dead &amp; forgotten for eternity
Hell's reign will forevelast

[lead: Bart]

rule of pain, blood &amp; death
flock of god serve Satan well
torment in his fiery breath
forever suffer damned to Hell !

damned to Hell !!!
