newborn life-
first scream for air
putrid stench of decay
condemned to die-
to finish mortal existence
and rot without end

[lead: Bart]

into mortal world
you were born
left for death
it's sharpest thorn
feel the reaper
his steps so near
hear his whisper
into your ear

tormented to death
destiny means decay
born to rot
left for worms

sick fate's smile-
bringer of your lives
tormentor of our souls
we are born to rot
from the cradle to the grave
our safe heaven
to the grave...
to meet the master
to the grave...
to the worms !!!
