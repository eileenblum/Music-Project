Screams of blood,
Morbid lust
Stench of death
In rotting tombs
Floating shadows
Born of fire
Lead the devil's
Hand of doom
Paralyzed
Dead and cold
Soulless corpses
Sent to hell
Shattered bones,
Broken hopes...
Praise the world's fucking end!

Drink the sabbath's wine
Angels chanting their last psalm
Dancing on the graves I fall
Into the trance of death

See the sacred whore
Blessing all the abomination
Fires of her filthy cunt
Brightens the night

Bestial orgies
Upon the altars.
Sodomy,
Blood and sperm.
Bleeding count
Dressed in red
Rides the beast
With seven heads.
Drops of life
Kiss the gold
In the cup of fornication
Inner self
Sacrificed
Body is rotting in decay

Spill the blood of saints
In each corner of the earth
Dazed by the power of small deaths
I lost my path

Oh scarlet whore!
Your love is my death
Destroy my thoughts
At one with all
Oh the great sea!
Let me understand

The wilderness of the spirit I must cross...
The wilderness of the spirit I must cross...
