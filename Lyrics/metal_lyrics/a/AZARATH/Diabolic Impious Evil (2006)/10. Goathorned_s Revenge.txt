Out of the abyss
Marching proud
Hell's legions
Lucifer's hounds

No more
Centuries of tyranny!
No more

A call to arms
Gather for war
On his command
Bringing the storm

No more
Centuries of tyranny!
No more
Myth of bastard Christ!

Storm of vengeance
for the fucking god of lies
Storm of war
for the fucking Christian hypocrites

No time to repent
Hate is unbound
Horns mark our way
Death is all around

This is vengeance
for the fucking god of lies
This is war
for the fucking Christian hypocrites

No more
Centuries of tyranny!
No more
Myth of bastard Christ!
No more
Centuries of tyranny!

A sign of the horns
is our battle sign
By seven deadly storms
the victory is regained

Forever bliss
to the holy scum!
Eternal slavery
for god and his lambs!
