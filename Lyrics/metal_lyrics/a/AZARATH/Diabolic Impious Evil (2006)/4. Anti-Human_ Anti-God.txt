From behind the crucifix invert the holy sign
I am Blasphemer, the one of the unlight

Face the new-age messiah
Anti-Human, Anti-God

Skies cry fucking blood when you see me fly
From the heart of darkness on a width of fire

Nuclear holocaust
Blasting storm of Evil
Anti-Human, Anti-God
Anti-Human, Anti-God

Bestial force unleashed onto the lack eart
Blast of desecration storms the holy church
Without a warning, without a single sign
Armageddon comes and everybody dies

Weapons of mass destruction I possess
and countless armies await my command
Hell spits out Daemons and roaring flames
Where's fuckin' Christ when you meet the end
