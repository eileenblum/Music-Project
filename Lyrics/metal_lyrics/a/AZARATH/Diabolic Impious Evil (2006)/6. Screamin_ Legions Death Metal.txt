High on aggression, full force
Blasts of electric Hellthunder
Filled with smoke stage explodes
and Evil hits the frenzied crowds

Razorsharp noise from Hell
The work of apocalypse is done

We're antichristian crusaders
we're the hammer of desecration
We bring you the metal of death
We bring the only true law!
Fuck with us and you're dead
Unholy death metal commando

We're in league with Lucifer
We're in league with Satan

We're in league with Lucifer
We're in league with Satan
Screamin' legions death metal
Screamin' legions death metal

We ate the law!!!
