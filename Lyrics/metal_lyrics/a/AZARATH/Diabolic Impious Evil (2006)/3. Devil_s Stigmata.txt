Deep in the heart
A Pentagram sign
Carved in flesh
Painted in blood

Stigmatized by the Devil
Born of the whore
Stigmatized by the Devil
Marked to be dead!

Devil's stigmata
Sign of the chosen
Devil's stigmata
Sign of the fallen

Across the soul
Six, six, six mark
Burning so bright
As dark as night

Stigmatized by the Devil
Born of the whore
Stigmatized by the Devil
Marked to be dead!

Devil's stigmata
Sign of the chosen
Devil's stigmata
Sign of the fallen
