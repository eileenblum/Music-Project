Hail to Thee, bringer of light, praised be Thy name
No entity greater than Thou, ruler of the earth.

Glory to Thee, almighty one, grand eternal snake
None shall stand before Thee, highest Lord of Hell.

Praise the Beast!

Thou who rules the elements and the force within
No light brighter than Thou, master of all sins.

Thy words speak the truth, Prince of all arts
Daemons guard Thy throne of angels' skulls.

Hail to thee, dark conqueror
Thou art Lord!
Ride the flames of Inferno
Satan, come forth!

Praise the Beast!
Rise up in infernal glory
Praise the Beast!
Usurper of the thrones.

Bless thou thy children, pride of the earth
Save thy faithful legions from eternal death.

Praise the Beast!
Rise up in infernal glory
Praise the Beast!
Usurper of the thrones.
