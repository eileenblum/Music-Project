Malicious entity
Inside my head, inside my mind
It's devouring me, it's changing me
It drives me insane
I'm but your host, I'm but your shrine.

Ancient spirit, so sinister, so old
Azazel, you are me
Lost is now my soul.

Unholy One, Evil One
Elder Daemon
Unholy One, Vicious One
Ancient Serpent!
Unholy One, Dark One
Desert Daemon!

With you inside I am god
Your words I shall speak
The Daemon's inside of me
Evil's inside of me.
