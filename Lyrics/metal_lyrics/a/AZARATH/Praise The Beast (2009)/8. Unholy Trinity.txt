My hand moves, it draws the sygils
It seems to live by its own
There's no question, I am possessed
A vessel of the unholy legion
Daemons inside my head they roar
The seals must open this night
My magick shall become the key
I'll be the guiding light.

Lucifer, the light of the east
Beelzebub, lord of the flies
Astaroth, riding the dragon
To Thee I've devoted my life.

This is the dawn of the infernal reign
The rise of unpurity
This is the dawn of the infernal reign
The Unholy Trinity!

Superior spirits in number of three
Emperor, prince and grand duke
Ancient spirits, lords of this world
The time is now for you to rule
Satanic rites I perform in a trance
My lips open to free the spells
I have sacrificed my body and mind
To the ones emerging from Hell.

This is the dawn of the infernal reign
The rise of unpurity
This is the dawn of the infernal reign
The Unholy Trinity!

I witness no longer this glory
My life has come to an end
Thousands of Daemons set free
As I now welcome my death
The final gaze at the open gate
Blasting with pure energy
The work of my life is complete
The rise of the Dark Trinity.

Lucifer, the light of the east
Beelzebub, lord of the flies
Astaroth, riding the dragon
To Thee I've devoted my life.
