Spawn of chaos, spawn of hell
Abomination of the earth razorblades
Whips and blood
This is what I am

I am strong with your weakness
I'm strong with my sins
The triumph of mind and flesh
The legacy of Kane.

I'll watch you crawl like a worm
I'll bleed you to the end
I'll watch you scream and die in agonizing pain.

I hate your kind, I hate you!
In the name of Satan I shall kill!
I hate your kind, I hate you!
For the Dark Ones you will bleed!

I follow the one with horns
No to god, no to Christ
I'm what you fear and desire
But never shall become.

I am strong with your weakness
I'm strong with my sins
I am strong with the darkness
Standing behind me.

I hate your kind, I hate you!
In the name of Satan I shall kill!
I hate your kind, I hate you!
For the Dark Ones you will bleed!

Take this death, take this pain
Scream mercy, again and again!

No to god... No to Christ...
Deny the cross...
Bleed and die!
