I worship hell, I worship death
Not your messiah, not your Christ
I'm into sadism, into perversion
I'm no creation of your god.

Hunger of the flesh I feed
The lust I obey like a lam
Devour my sins one by one
And drink to Dark Gods below.

Obey the flesh
Follow the flesh
Flesh is the lam
Flesh is the key to Satan.

I am involved with black magick
I'm the master of forbidden arts
I don't fear eternal damnation
For I am all free from your god.

I live to the code of the earth
I live to the natural lam
I am the Beast of prey
A shot in the head of your god.

Flesh is the lam, the vessel of evil
Sacred shrine of Satan himself
Flesh is the only lam of the earth
I am so under it's sinister spell.

I live to the code of the earth
I live to the natural lam
I am the Beast of prey
A shot in the head of your god.

Obey the flesh!
