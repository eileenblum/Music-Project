The earth it turns, and you're still no closer today
Your time flitters away until nothing remains
And as the encroaching darkness comes, what will your servitude bring?
The very thing that brings you hope, is what you should most fear
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, save us is your prayer
You're all gonna die, all gonna die as mortal men
And as the encroaching darkness comes, no-one is exempt
No outstretched hand of god you extolled in your daily prayers
No outstretched hand of god
You greet each day with faith and little more
A constant hope that something better will be your reward
And as the encroaching darkness comes, what will your servitude bring?
Yes as the encroaching darkness comes, what will your subservience bring?
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, save us is your prayer
You're all gonna die, all gonna die as mortal men
And as the encroaching darkness comes, no-one is exempt
As the encroaching darkness comes yes, no-one will be spared
While we hail the glory of blackness absolute and you fear the on set of blackness absolute
No amount of faith will dull this razor truth when we're all engulfed in blackness absolute
While we hail the glory of blackness absolute
And subservience has yielded you with nothing
And you fear the onset of blackness absolute
And you won't even be aware until you're too dead to realise
No amount of faith will dull this razor truth, your life is yours and there is but one
We're one and all engulfed in blackness absolute
I pity those who live it bound in the shackles of blind faith
