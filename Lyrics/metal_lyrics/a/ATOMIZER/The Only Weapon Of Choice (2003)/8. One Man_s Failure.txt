Paranoia filled his heart
It was the prophecy that stood to tear his world apart
The wise foresaw the birth of a son
Who would teach of a life beyond this mortal one
Through arrogance and a desire to remain you know
It's like a beast that rises across the sky
Paranoia declared that child must die
Slay all the sons that are less than two
And thus the cruelest campaign did ensue
It did, despite his arrogance and a desire to remain well you know
This was the moment in time, when all could have been reversed
When those who did stand by, who allowed the ensuing madness to reign
One moment in time, when all could have been reversed
When paranoia's throne was usurped, when the flesh of your saviour should have burned
Like a star, like that beacon in the night
But paranoia was betrayed by the enlightened that lead the way
And despite all the steel that carved through the young flesh
Paranoia's authority was trampled on
The flesh of your saviour should burn
And from the day we're born until the day we die
The shackles that bind us men and women of the west
That would never have been, oh a fucking nightmare
Nightmare, the nightmare cometh, paranoia's failure set that faith aflame
