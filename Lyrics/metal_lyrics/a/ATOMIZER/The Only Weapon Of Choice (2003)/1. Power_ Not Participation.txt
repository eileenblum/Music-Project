Power, not participation, the wise rule the strong, the strong rule the weak and so on
Power, not participation, if we rule their thinking, our dominant quest can begin
Subservience or death
Since the very dawning of time, people have needed to be led
Subservience or death
Those that can't do as I will may not live to regret
The smarter we get, the crueler we are, and logic depicts a survival of fittest be law
Those that can't abide this belief, will join us or perish for this will become the new faith
It's more than desire, it's knowledge that will set the world right
For nothing else matters than enforcing the word and the law
By strength and by deed, we'll show them who's really in charge
For a malleable mind is a malleable will to control
Our morals are fading away, at least that's what men of the cloth would wish to convey
An uprising is for what I pray, a death to those fading religions that starts here today
