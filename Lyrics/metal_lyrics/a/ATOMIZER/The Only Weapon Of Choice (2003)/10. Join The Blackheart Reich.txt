Right now's the time to see those illusions you've conceived
The ones that furnish your dreams, it's time to suspend belief
For yes, I am the fucking way
Deep in the depths of your mind you know that to be right
Come join the blackheart reich
Deep in the depths of your mind you know that to be right!
And some, some are born to lead, and others born to bleed
And some will taste the whip for I am, I am, I am
We're beyond, beyond salvation with no belief in that myth creation
No mortal fear of any false damnation, join the blackheart reich
Our blackheart reich, we're beyond!
No submissive faith binds me, no crucifix holds me
No crown of thorns shames me, no martyr's legacy
