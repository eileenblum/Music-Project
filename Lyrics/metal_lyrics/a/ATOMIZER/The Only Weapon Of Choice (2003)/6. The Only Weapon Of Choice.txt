It's light as a feather, snaps right together, it's the one
It weathers the storm and the grimness of war, it's the one
It clears out the trenches with power and vengeance, it's the one
It lays waste to the temples and all those that dwell, it's the one
As a defoliant there is no accident, it's the one
It cuts down defences like razors through flesh, it's the one
Easy to conceal until death is revealed, it's the one
Structure, bone and plant, it lays everything flat out, it's the one
It's the only weapon of choice
It's the only weapon you'll need
It's the ultimate tool of destruction
It's the only weapon of choice
It discharges with ease and reloading's a breeze, it's the one
It will never jam it will never melt down, it's the one
It razes flesh from bone and mortar from stone, it's the one
It rolls through the town and lays everything flat out, it's the one
It never kicks back so precise its attack, it's the one
No pin is required no trigger desired, it's the one
Discharges with a thrust, turns matter to dust, it's the one
The kill rate's supreme and the death counts a dream, it's the one
