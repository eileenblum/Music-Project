I'm a selfish fiend
Yeah and I lust for me
And I wanna see
The world coming to an end

Some call it blasphemy, others treachery
But i've no, i've no pity
The walls coming down
In a foreign town, in your yard

And across the way
Gonna suck the light out of your day
And i'm just right
I'm just waiting for the bang tonight

Give it all i've got
Drive it home don't ever stop
Fight it tooth and nail
Humanitarian disintegration

An all conquering will
And a lust to kill kill kill
And you will know the motherfuckers
Gonna blow, oh what a sight!

The end the end the end allright!
