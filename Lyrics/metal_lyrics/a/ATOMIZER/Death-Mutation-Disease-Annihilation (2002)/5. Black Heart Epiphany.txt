Sometimes the simple sounds of suffering
Are enough
Sometimes the sweet sounds of suffering
Are more than enough
And sometimes enlightening those believers
Could seem like enough
And sometimes sadistic soul stripping
Is just what I want

The day turns to dusk and the predators
Creep into the night
Sometimes a simple revelation
Is enough
And sometimes a simple transformation
Is more than enough
And sometimes a violent confrontation
Might get the results
And sometimes extended bouts of torment
Are just what I want

No shining white light
No freedom call to pierce the night
No shining white light
No saviour man to put things 'right'
No shining white light
For mortal man to be blinded by
No shining white light
No freedom call

Cause i've entered into the fires of eternity
No turning back
I've had a black heart epiphany
I found a place to spend whatever's eternity
And all it will cost is my soul

Sometimes being pushed to the edge
Is not what you want
And sometimes being taken to the limit
That is what I want
And sometimes the comfort of the end
Will suit my resolve
And sometimes the desire to transcend
Is just what I want

I've had a black heart epiphany
