Shadenfreude
Remember me
Remember me through your life of misery
Remember me
Remember me through death and eternity

Damage, joy
A continuum of grief and despair
Devastation and harm
A death to the peace in your world

Extract, delight
From you and your suffering
Your pain, it's my pleasure
To choke all the life out of
I was put on this earth to relish in the suffering of fools
Yes, people like you

The reason I exist is to ridicule and torment
People like you
It is my raison d'etre
I exist for no other reason
