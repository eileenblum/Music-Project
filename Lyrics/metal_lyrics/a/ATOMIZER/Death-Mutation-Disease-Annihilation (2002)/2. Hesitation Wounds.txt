Plan A: Take, knife, cut deep
Plan B: Take gun, blow off your skull

Hesitation wounds
No you couldn't follow through

Plan C: Take rope place around your neck
Suspended from something strong
Now leap to your death

Hesitation wounds
No you couldn't follow through
Hesitation wounds
Your neck bears the scars of failure
Hesitation wounds
Although you've no will to live
Hesitation wounds
No you couldn't follow through

You just couldn't follow through
You've not got the will to commit
Plunge deep into the unknown
What lays beyond the mortal realm
What dwells beyond your final breath
What lies beyond life as you know it?
Death!

You've no reason to live no purpose to serve
Go forth and discover what shall unfold
What lays beyond the mortal realm?
The unknown

Do it!
Kill yourself
Commit thy will

Plan D: Switch on gas, go to sleep
Plan E: Down pills straight out of the bottle

Hesitation wounds
No you couldn't follow through

Plan F: Get in car, run a hose
Hit ignition, breathe in deep
Let the toxins engulf you

Hesitation wounds
No you couldn't follow through
Hesitation wounds
You panicked and sent an alarm
Hesitation wounds
Although you've no will no live
Hesitation wounds
You're too weak to follow through
Plunge deep into the unknown
