Yeah I know what you are
Just an icon for fools to succumb to
Yeah I know what you are
A false deity, imposter
Yeah I know what you are
Sacrificed by those you were sent to save
Yeah I know what you are
The last prayer for the dying

The image of your god
Nailed to a cross
Was that his greatest feat?
His most important task?

Yeah I know what you are
Just an icon for fools to succumb to
Yeah I know what you are
A false deity, imposter
Yeah I know what you are
The last hope for the dying

The image of your god
Nailed to a cross
Was that his greatest feat?
His most important task?

What of the lepers healed
The prophecies foretold
Why not immortalise these
You aren't entirely sold
Your magnanimous god
Bait for the vultures
Can't you tell he's merely a mortal
Yet you wait and you wait
For 2000 years you wait
And still there's no one to save you!

See your saviour hang
See him wither and die
Without an ounce of resistance
As the nails drive in
Thinks his father'll save him
And the nails drive in, there he is
Your Jesus Christ on the cross
The great martyr
Who gave his life for your salvation
And where's he now
For 2000 years you have waited
He couldn't save himself
How do you think he can save you?
