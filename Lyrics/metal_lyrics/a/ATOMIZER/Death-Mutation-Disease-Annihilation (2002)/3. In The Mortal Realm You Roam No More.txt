...And you're bound to hell as all good sinners are
The reaper will take you he'll show you the path
Recanting your sins, no that won't get you far
The devil awaits you he'll personally greet you in hell

Why wish to retire in some paradise
Where everything's wholesome yes everything's right
When the blistering rivers of hell do await
And Satan himself, is there by the gate to greet you

A knock
Upon your door
Snatch your soul
In the mortal realm you roam no more
And his grip
Cold as ice
Eclipse your soul
In the mortal realm you roam no more

It's only for the proud and only for the few
And only for those whose spirit be true
You've led the right life and survived it too
And here is the day, you've now paid your dues
You're in hell

A knock
Upon your door
Snatch your soul
In the mortal realm you roam no more
His presence
Fills you with fear
Just let go
In the mortal realm you roam no more

When he raps on your door
With his crooked bone claw
Not a word does he speak
He clutches your arm
Got a grip on your soul
And he ain't leaving without you
And he'll take you to hell
Which is all fine and well
As far as he sees
It's the endtimes for you
You know that it's true
You don't wanna let go - of your life

A knock
Upon your door
Snatch your soul
In the mortal realm you roam no more
Face of death
Want to repel
Relinquish your soul
Nothing to do but follow
