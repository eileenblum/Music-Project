Rain pours down on everglades
To engulf the remembrance
Of a past era like a
Shroud embeds the stagnation.

From severe wounds blood gushes
Forth to get white-washed
In the rising seas of
Untarnished requital.
To relinquish intentions of the renegades
Is its uppermost command to be enforced.

Elegies are droning through deepest dungeons
To die away unheard on decayed walls
Which are stained by rotten entrails,
Taunting the creatures in their despair

Wolves and rats are gutting
Their effete corpses.
Worms are devouring
Flesh and desiccated skin.

Those who will survive the bestial torture
Are doomed to serve in everlasting slavery
To obey the dominance of the divine right of kings.

Doomed to slavery!
Serve in slavery!
Obey me!
