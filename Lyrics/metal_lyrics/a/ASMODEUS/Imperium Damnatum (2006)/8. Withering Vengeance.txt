Swords are glistening in the winter sun
Which were forged on the anvil of spite.

Turbid reflections are craving for vengeance.
An idyllic shroud of snow is trampled
Down by scorching hooves.

Behind visors there are
Glowing resolved eyes.
Screams are hurtling
Through the fields,
On which they are embattling
For the slaughter.
The horde is poised
For the final assault.

Horns are announcing
The declaration
Of a war which should
Last until all is erased.
Banners of the only true
Dark force should waft
On the lances on which the
Impaled fallen surrender.

Fight for your kingdom.
Fight for your dominion.
Subdue those undeserving ones
To relieve from the chains of slavery.
