Emblazoned by thorns I scorn in the sun,
Impaled by a miscreant folk
On the pillory of derisiveness.

Their derision clangs in my ears
Like the bell

Which tolls for my execution.
Their incomparable hypocrisy
Whips my senses,
When they acclaim me
Like a martyr.

The insight overtakes me
That I waste away and suffer
For a pride they
Do no deserve.

My blood and sweat shall meld into
A wrenching stream to drown them
And to demonstrate them my everlasting dignity
Which is even now able to let them perish
At any time.
