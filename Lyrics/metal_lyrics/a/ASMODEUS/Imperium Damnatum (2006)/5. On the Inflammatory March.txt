Those who succeeded in abscondence, regather now in secret vaults.
To conjure this new revolt, they defile the holy shrine.
Burning down the elder teasures would help them to forget.
Only in their nightmares, they will be reminded

Of their atrocious past
In sovereign contempt.

Perhaps this was all on purpose
To form the best combatants -
The unconquerable army.

Rearmed and steeled they march up to the once lost soil
To fetch back what should belong to them.
All over the years they had this dream
To re-enter their promised land

Which was trespassed and occupied.

Finally they are guided and hailed as heroes -
On the inflammatory march.
