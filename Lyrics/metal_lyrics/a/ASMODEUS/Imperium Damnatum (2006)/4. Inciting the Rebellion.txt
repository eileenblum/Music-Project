I am gasping and panting in dark clouds of smoke.
My neck is enclosed by a collar of steel
And as my feet and hands chained up to the
Ruins of this doleful sepulchre.

Numb with grief a final yell suffocates in a seared throat
And flagging limbs are hanging maltreated in chains.
A dozing redeeming salaciousness pounces on me
And tempts me not to endure this slavery for longer.

My blinded eyes will behold the sun nevermore.
My once incisive scent wouldn't feast on winter air.
My pale tattered lips would remain silence,
When the blather is spoken by fatuous ones.

In my mind, through my head, thoughts are hunting me.
In my soul, in my heart, embers engenders an
Longed for, ever suspected awakening will to fight.

On a stone in the wall, there are engraved
Dozens of hateful words - spurred by Odium -
Etching an evident determination
In my strait, resurrecting, gleaming pupils.

Tearing on the chains of my confinement
I declare - inflated with self-confidence -

To incite all prisoners to a rebellion
To disentangle them from this doom.
Now it should be done.
All pain should elapse.
