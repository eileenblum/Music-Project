The sun red glowing climbs down into the far frothing silver glancing sea.
My mind is filled with corruption and my heart reveals his disharmony.

From autumnal dawning cloudveils a sorrowfully death pale countenance breaks forth, followed by the delightful breath of night.
The pictures of past are not effaced.
The spirit of shivers is still burning in my heart.

The manifestation of truth enriches yester forces.
Is this my hell which prevails over bitterness?

Once they shone at my heaven, adorned by my light of yesterdays fight,
Purely united in profound veracity. There has never been a doubt on their existence but they were consigned to oblivion.

Is this my hell which prevails over bitterness?

Now the roaring of the sparkling waves derides the nostalgia for tranquillity.
Only the raffling of the froth is spread like cloak of silence.

At night, when the sea rocks the splendour of the stars,
I spread my wings, awaiting the ascent of my demise.
I spread my wings, awaiting the ascent of my demise.
