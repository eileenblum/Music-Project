Standing on a cliff, I face the decisive battle.
Streams of blood merging with the water in this malicious ambush.

Eviscerated carcasses of my ancestors
Float on the waves of transitoriness,
Should I share this fate?

It's just one step into another world to reach the verdict to enter a new mortal life.
Or is this only a wandering through some nightmares which haunt me at night?
Is this the moment to get the chance to guide my race out of this agony?
Should I take them under my aegis and doom them to a uncertain destiny?

I have ever been afraid of this moment.

An inner voice screams:
Plunge into salvation!

I will follow, I will do it, no leave off!

The cadaverous smell of this carnage,
Corrodes my face and burns its way to the secret region of my mind,
I fight the war with sanity and it turns out that there is only one decision:

It's just one step into another world to reach the verdict to enter a new mortal live.
Or is this only a wandering through some nightmars which haunt me at night?
Is this the moment to get the chance to guide my race out of this agony?
Should I take them under my aegis and doom them to a uncertain destiny...

Which has arrived.
