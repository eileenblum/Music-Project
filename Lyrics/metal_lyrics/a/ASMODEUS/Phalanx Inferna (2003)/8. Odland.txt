The wind streaks the
Last green and the
Summer days have
Passed. Fog engulfs
The forest, in odor and
Twilight world descends.

A last ray of the old bliss
Trickles over the valley
And scathes the darkened site,
Forest and heath shine.

Like a spring days reflection
Glistens on the skin of winter.
Why should this all fade away?

Wandering through a deep glen,
Where no rememberance
Of bright days is left.

Leaves are melting the
Moisture of the air, languishing
For the last elixir of life.

Soon only drought boughs will rise

To the welkin at dusk,
To demant a ray of dying life.

Shadows, who have been holding their protecting hands over this idyll,
Grow pale in this embrace of final salvation.

While this evening is dazing,
I bestow my favour on the discord of this ambience.

The autumnal wind endresses
The universe in shroud
And his moaning dies
Away in eternity.

Coldness enthrones the warming fulfillment, which spoiled me
And draws the veil of oblivion over the scene.

A last breath is being exhausted to bottomless abyss,
And the land drowns down in everlasting dust.
