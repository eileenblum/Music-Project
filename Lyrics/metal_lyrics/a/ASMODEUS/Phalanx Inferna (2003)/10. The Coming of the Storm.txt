A cruel night surrounds me.
Cold and sombre shines my grave.

Winds, torn off, are wailing the tales of
My death. Snow smooths down the land
Vanishing the vestige of forgotten wars.

Under a shroud of winter all life oozed away.
A starless sky stares down with empty eyes on
Glancing fields. A last rebellion of the light is
Devoured by bottomless abyss. A book of reign is
Closed by terror and disobedient force. Where once
My power ruled, now my estate withers. Doubtlessly
This season will extricate of this entwining skin
But my welking face will tyrannize your frozen
Mind, unable to believe, how all this
Splendour could grow pale.

You enchanted me as I ruled undefeated,
You invaded me, I thought to have no
Feebleness. You tried to subjugate me
But I am the eternal goddess. My wrath
Is your ruin, mould in damnation!

Wintry silence covers this violence
But resurrection is awaiting me,
Yearning for me.

Winds, torn off, are rushing
Through the land of my hate.
Icy calls die away blasting down
The hope of eternal peace.

Your descendants will be slaughtered
And all remembrance erased. Your lifework
Will be destroyed and never to be built up again.

Wintry violence drowns out the silence,
Renascented bondage is spread by me.

Under a shroud of winter all life oozed away.
A starlit sky stares down with burning eyes on glancing fields.
A new rebellion of the light forges ahead to bottomless abyss.
A book of reign is opened by terror and disobedient force.
Where once thy power ruled, now thy estate withers.
Doubtlessly this season will extricate of this entwining skin
But my laughing mug will tyrannize your frozen mind,
Unable to believe, how all this splendour could ever grow pale.
