As stormclouds gather and thunders shatter the hopes of the ancient,
Stormtroops are marching under the banner of hate and revenge.
They are massacring, guided by voices of darkness.

Darkness

This is the hour of truth and new power,
Enthralling the warriors, alliance of evil.
Hoof beat promulgates the law of the future fate.
Bend down before the master in everlasting slavery.

Summon the horde,
Die for your lord.

Summon the horde,
Heal with your sword

The wounds of the past and cast a shadow of mercilessness and eternal darkness.
