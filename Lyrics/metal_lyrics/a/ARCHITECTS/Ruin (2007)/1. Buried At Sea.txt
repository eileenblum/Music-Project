Send my regards to you and yours
I'm not coming back for you
And I'll hold onto the last memory of you
I'll hold onto you and bury you at sea
How can you watch me split in two?
You've done this before, you know me oh too well
Send my regards to you and yours
And no hope will come from this
So turn around and run
How can you smile when you see me crumbling?
And we all stood back and watched the waves crash down on you
Send my regards to you and yours
And there's no hope for someone as cold as you
You made me sink into the coldest of waves
I watch you sink into lies that you created
