The sun was so low that day
Staring into burning eyes
Watch as I walk away from you
From the lies that you made my life
Making me feel so lost and helpless
Running won't help me
Now it's too late
Closing my eyes to the skies makes it worse
Look down and I've been here for far too long
Too long to contemplate
The was so low that day
Staring into burning eyes
But it's far too late to contemplate leaving you alone against your will
Running won't help you now
Look down and try to forget me
Staring into your burning eyes
All that is left is the sound of your fragile voice
Echoing in my wondering mind
The sun was so low that day
I had to turn from your gaze
Only to reassure
Running won't help
