I don't feel homesick, I'm just so sick of home
It's here that reminds me of everything we've been through
And it tears me down
It makes me sick of being who I am, of who I cannot be
A constant reminder
I don't feel homesick, I'm just so sick of home
It's here that reminds me of everything we've been through
Cold nights, again left alone
Wandering streets all on my own
And all of this for you
It's time that I went back for just even an hour
To talk to you to make things fine again
Again and again I will run from you
