[2008 Re-release Bonus Track]Falling into stringencies
I never thought that I would be here
Dependence on, the evenings
I'm out of touch

It's too late to hide what you kept hid
What explains with words were crooks
I'm falling out,
I'm falling out,
Of touch, with myself

I felt like this since forever
(this is killing me)
I felt like this since forever
(this is killing, me)

What escaped
Was what I dreamt then
Blurry eyes
Said the stories
I'm broke apart
Fading hours
Empty dreams

Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends
Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends

I wore the same routines over every fucking night
I'm beginning to lose faith in friendships, I...

I've felt like this since forever
(this is killing me)
I felt like this since forever
This is killing me

Lift me up from this
Never ending fear of myself
Dependence on the evenings
To get me through
Show me the line
I can't just walk away

How much longer
Can I break the same routines
Blurry eyes
(Broken clocks)
Fading hours

How much longer
Can I break the same routines
Blurry eyes
(Broken Clocks)
Fading hours

Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends
Addiction has stolen the hearts of all my friends
