Find comfort in yourself
Begin to believe, before it's over
Lift your head up
Everybody's talking
Prove them wrong
Before your time is up
You keep it all in, and you never find a release
Take comfort in yourself
And only know how to find safety in yourself
Find your faith and find your hope
You'll find safety
I know it's hard to look up when everything's falling down on you
It's hard, but you can make it
Begin to believe
I know it's hard to look up when everything's falling down
