Hunt them down before it's too late
Now is the times to make the most of their pain
They deserve it for all that they have ruined for you
Don't think or say anything
Don't hold back, you'll regret this night
It's all over
Don't make the same mistake twice
Finish them now
Push them down
Face first to the ground
They deserve it for all they have done to you
