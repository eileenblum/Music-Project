How can you stand there and look me in the eye?
Tell me that you knew it was coming for us
I know that you said I was all you ever wanted
But you pushed me overboard
Into knee deep water
And you didn't throw the anchor of hope
You pushed me overboard
Without concern for what I was feeling inside
Heartless intentions
Your favorite game to play
I knew that I was never good enough to make you smile
Still you play these games, you ruin me from the inside
Tearing me down
I can't hide
I can't not act torn about this
What can I do to make you see?
How it affects me, so deeply still
I'm untouched from your point of view
