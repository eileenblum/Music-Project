When In Troy
Do as the Greeks do
This is treacherous
This is cold hearted betrayal
Move in for the kill
And youâre all traitors
Weâll fight them to the death
Burn down the houses
Loot all the churches
And we found the time to pray
Pray that our justice be done
Pray by the light of the moon
That weâre not here
