Been searching all day
For the answers
Do you remember when
Life was so simple?
They were shooting at us
After all this time
Shooting at us
Killing us all
And weâre all numb
Numb with the sound
Sound of our fears
Weâre all numb
And just before you die
Take a look up at the sky
Tell them it was all worth it
Theyâll Be Hanging Us Tonight
Raid all the liquor stores
Kidnap the kids
This night is not over yet
Burning on Luciferâs blood
Weâre trashed in the back of your car
A cheap lay in the parking lot
A shot for afterwards
As I watched you slaying behind the wheel
Theyâre gaining on us
A sharp turn left
Running out of time
Theyâre gaining on us
The lights flashed by
As we sped towards our escape
Nothing else mattered
Nobody else cared
Theyâll be hanging us tonight
This was our masterpiece
