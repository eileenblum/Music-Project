Weâll fight this cause
Even if it kills us
The temperature is rising
But our lungs will not collapse
Here in the desert
Thereâs nothing to run from
Nothing to hide from
So lets rock the casbah
Take it by the scruff of the neck
And if youâve got the time, baby Iâve got the money
And Iâd give anything to see her smile again
And Iâd do anything for one last smile
She had a love like nobody else
Unrivalled beauty wanted them to love her back
When they didnât she shed a tear
A piece of us all died that day
We all died that day
