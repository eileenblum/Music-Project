Piano wire strangling our necks
We are both silenced
And weâre sure this does not add up
Still we try and place our bets
Weâre sure this does not add up
Still weâre dying
To make that call
Our people versus yours
Never did make sense
Your people versus mine
Light me up itâs all too much for me
Never did make sense, come dance with me
Weâll go out the sea, the sky was blood read
Images of people dead
Stained with the shadows
Of our past victims, weâre out at sea
Then come and drown with me
Weâll float away, drift away
Our corpses lifeless
Then somehow tell me we made sense
