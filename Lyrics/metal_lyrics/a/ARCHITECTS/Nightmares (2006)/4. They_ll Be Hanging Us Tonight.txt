Raid all the liquor stores
Kidnap the kids

This night's not over yet
Running on Lucifer's blood

We're trashed in the back of your car
A cheap lay in the parking lot
A shot for afters

Trashed in the back of your car
In the parking lot
Shot for afters

As I watched you slaying behind the wheel

They're gaining on us
A sharp turn left
Running out of time
They're gaining on us

This night's not over yet
Running on Lucifer's blood

The lights flashed by as we sped towards our escape
Nothing else mattered
Nobody else cared

They'll be hanging us tonight
This was our masterpiece
