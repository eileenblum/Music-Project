Itâs getting hard to breathe in here
What I would give to be set free
This darkness surrounding me
Theyâre coming for us
Theyâre closing in
Take careful aim
I know you wonât miss
Avoid eye contact
Shoot the messenger
Pools of blood surround
Donât run and hide this time
But weâve made a mistake
A glaring error
Weâre adrift
Nearly gone
And if you knew
Youâd get away with it all what would you do?
In my darkened tomb, I am laid to waste


Thanks to mashaunix for sending track #4 lyrics.
