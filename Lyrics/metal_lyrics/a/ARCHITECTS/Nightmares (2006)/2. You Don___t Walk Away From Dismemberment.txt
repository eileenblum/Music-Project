I will spill blood
On your filthy princess whites
Come home tonight
So I can slit your throat
Every time you discard my heart
Your ships sinking fast
The colours are fading
Save me again tonight, you know Iâll make it count
Princess, thereâs more to life than robbing banks
You wonât walk away from this broken heart
Slash my arms
Tear off my limbs
I will never back down
To your sin
