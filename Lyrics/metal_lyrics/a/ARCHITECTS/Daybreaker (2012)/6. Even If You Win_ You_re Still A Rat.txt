Your life is ending one minute at a time
Check the clock and stand in line.
Hibernate, till your life's passed you by.
Please stop living like you're waiting to die.

Keep up, keep up,
Don't get left behind
Don't slip up, slip up
Chase that finish line
They don't want you believing 
that your life deserves a meaning.

Weary souls, trying to forget.
That we're all puppets with a lifetime debt.

What a feeling, built to break,
Happiness with an expiry date.
Please stop living like you're waiting to die.

Stitched into our lives
Drained until we expire.
Weary soul's trying to forget
That we're all puppets with a lifetime debt.

Keep two eyes on that intangible finish line.
In this race we're all reduced to vermin.
