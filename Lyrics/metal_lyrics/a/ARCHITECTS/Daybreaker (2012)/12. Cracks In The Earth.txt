[Japanese/US Re-issue Bonus Track]In the bigger picture I've been painted out
Cracks in the earth blacken the sea
No canvas is reserved for me
Look up close and try to see
In every stroke lies past alone

Too close to home
Cutting too close to bone
The ink has dried and words reveal
Too close to home
Cutting too close to the bone
It's too easy to admit defeat

You aren't a child fighting in a war
Son please don't tell me that this is bored
Tear your things out from the earth
Long departed we're so short sighted

Too close to home
Cutting too close to bone
The ink has dried and words reveal
Too close to home
Cutting too close to the bone
It's too easy to admit defeat

Too close to home
Cutting too close to bone
The ink has dried and words reveal
Too close to home
Cutting too close to the bone
It's too easy to admit defeat
