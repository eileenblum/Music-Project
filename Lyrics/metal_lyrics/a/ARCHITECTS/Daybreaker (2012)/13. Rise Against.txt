[iTunes UK/Japanese Bonus Track]Resist, rise against
Tuning out the message they sent
Waking up, things never felt so clear
All of it ceased, I want it to pass

Armed to the teeth
With words that give me some meaning

Cover up the mistakes that you made
You better believe this feeling won't fade
Digging deep, there's a long way to go
But there's some things that we want you to know
These pills must be bitter to swallow
What despair waits for us tomorrow?
This is only a matter of time
One day you're gonna pay for your crime

Armed to the teeth
With words that give me some meaning
Oh, I'm wide awake, but I'm still dreaming
I'm still dreaming

I'll clinch my name, I'm fading now
But we're not ready just to lay down and die
The clouds are smoke signals, so you'll find your way
Spread the word of the mess that we're in
This is a chance to live through my end

I'm wide awake, but I still hear you

Armed to the teeth
With words that give me some meaning
Oh, I'm wide awake, but I'm still dreaming
I'm still dreaming
