Sowing the seeds.
Roots dig deep, whilst we sleep.
Snakes in veins, valves decay.
All of the meaningless words we say.
Cast the first stone, from behind the throne.
Crown of thorns, now overgrown.
All our wants and needs, bring us to our knees.
Canât turn back now the seeds are sown.
Seven billion, one of a kind.
Collide together, intertwined.
National lines used to define,
where we draw the enemy lines.
Weapons arenât used in this war.
Wait for the fallout from this absence of thought.
All the things we canât afford to ignore.
The sun doesnât shine anymore.
