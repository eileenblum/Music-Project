[US Re-issue Bonus Track]We're found a taste for selfdestruction
A blind eye for blatant disfunction
We're found a taste for selfdestruction
We're born in black blood

There's an imminence stirring like a siren singing
There's a debt to pay but they keep on drilling
Why simple truth so hard to tell
We had an Eden and turned it into hell

Born in black blood

Because this distance in our minds
Is the distance that we're behind
I can't forgive we won't forget
I can't forgive we won't forget

The lonely sound of the final drip
Like the starting gun marking the end of it
On the shoulders of forever it's a long way to fall
Black gold will be the death of us all
Black drought, word will spread
Of the time we found what the earth bled

Born in black blood!

Because this distance in our minds
Is the distance that we're behind
I can't forgive we won't forget
I can't forgive we won't forget
[x2]

BRAH!

Black drought, word will spread
Of the time we found what the earth bled
We've found the cancer inside of our heads
There's no turning back now, we're good as dead

When the well dried up no one cared
But when the hell shows up, they'll all stop and stare
[x2]

We've found the cancer inside of our heads
There's no turning back now, we're good as dead
[x2]

I can't forgive we won't forget
[x4]
