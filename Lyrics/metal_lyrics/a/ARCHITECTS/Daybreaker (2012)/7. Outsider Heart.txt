I close my eyes and take a deep breath,
try to find my place in this.
Digging teeth into the hand that feeds,
so inhuman, Iâm surprised you bleed.
Cutting teeth, fading belief.
Flip the switch and drag me in.
When theyâve had their way,
I doubt Iâll even dream.
Stray from the path and youâre on your own.
Lightening strikes in the unknown.
The view from here, even the blind would see,
that none of us were ever free.
Iâll be the lines in-between,
the ones that tell you what you want and need.
I am only rust on the machine,
amber corrosion.
The loudest truth you never heard,
a silent explosion.
Take my head from the clouds,
lift my feet from the ground,
Last note dies, they donât make a sound.
