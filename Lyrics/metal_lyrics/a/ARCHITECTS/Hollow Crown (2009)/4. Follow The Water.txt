Can I blame it on you?
I just can't win

Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds
Can't seem to find a good excuse this time, for me and for this to fall apart
Shall I blame it on myself, or this routine that I've been stuck in?

I've lost count of how many times I've tried to get out of this routine
But it's holding so tight

I just can't handle another day of this
I just can't win

Get me out alive

Oh God, I mean it
These are violent days for you and me
I just can't handle another day of this routine

Two years spent wondering through the loneliest of minds
I've found my excuse this time
Your words are wearing me down
A constant frown upon my back

Follow the water
Drain the lake and bring it back to me
