take your time to find me
I can't promise where I'll be
these nights I felt so restless
tonight I feel useless

take your time to find me
I can't promise where I'll be
these nights I feel so restless
tonight I'm useless

blaming myself
for every woman
I should have thought this through
before I hold you down with me
motionless I lay
when your words could save me from
this situation

I've been laying here for what seems
like days
and it was my mistake from the start

take your time to find me
I can't promise where I'll be
it was my mistake from the start

take your time to find me
I can't promise where I'll be
it was my mistake from the start

motionless I lay
when the words that saved me
staring back into
dead sunk eyes?

I need the right words to come...
I need the the right words
but I just can't find it
I just can't find it

I'll spend years
making you believe
I was just a bad dream
just a bad dream

and it was my mistake from the start
I've been laying here for what seems
like days

take your time to find me
I can't promise where I'll be
it was my mistake from the start

take your time to find me
I can't promise where I'll be
it was my mistake from the start

I'm determined
to find a way, out
to disconnect myself
from you, again

how can I
have shattered
my one chance
ooow, to you
how can I
feel like I'm
shattered my
ooohooo

to me
I'll spend years
making you believe
that I was only a bad dream

I'm determined
to find a way, out
to disconnect myself
from you, again

how can I
have shattered
my one chance
ooow, to you
how can I
feel like I'm
shattered my
once chance tonight
