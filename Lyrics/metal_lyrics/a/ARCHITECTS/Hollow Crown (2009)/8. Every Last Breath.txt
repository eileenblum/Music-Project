After all is said and done
I'm left with reflections of your eyes haunting my mind
So dead inside, what good came out of this?
I was the one that tore you down
I'm down yet oh so guilty
Every last breath I have is yours to keep
This constant cloud is watching over me
I wish I had the time to make you see this through
We've been here too many times
I've felt like this too many times
Oh god, I am this I'm dead inside, looking out for you
And your final words I was the one that tore you down
