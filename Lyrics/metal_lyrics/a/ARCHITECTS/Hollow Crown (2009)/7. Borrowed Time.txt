I'm looking back on a time when I could say I actually thought I cared about you
But after everything I've been put though
I realise that I've been living with false hope
It's drowning out my senses
It's drowning out my thoughts
This has got oh so confusing
And I've only got myself to blame
I can't believe...oh what was I thinking
I've only got my self to blame
You mean nothing to me
And you never fucking did
I can't stand to listen to your excuses anymore
I can only pray that you feel so alone
A guilty conscience hangs over your head
I can't believe...oh what was I thinking
I've only got myself to blame
But maybe I'm the only one to blame in all of this
I've got nothing to depend on anymore
