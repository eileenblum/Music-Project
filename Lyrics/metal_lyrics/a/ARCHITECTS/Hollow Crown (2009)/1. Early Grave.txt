I've been out for so long, the days slipped by again
And I can't sleep since I stopped caring [x2]
I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
And I can't tell daylight from streetlights any-fucking-more
As he cast his shadow

I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't look back
And I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't, I'm not looking back

This is so unfamiliar; death is no man's friend
And I'll stay here until I hear him roar
Death is screaming my name yet
I refuse to listen to him [x2]

I refuse, I refuse, I refuse
To listen

I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
And I can't tell daylight from streetlights any-fucking-more
As he cast his shadow

I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't look back
And I've seen this road a thousand times and I can't, I'm not looking back

I can't sit here forever
Watch me rise again
Watch me rise back up
Forever would just be so easy to fall into [x2]
Yet I'll stay out until my lungs bleed
Forever is the easy option but I won't take it
I won't take it, no

The choices I've made will lead me to an early fucking grave

Death is screaming,
Death is screaming,
Death is screaming, my fucking name
