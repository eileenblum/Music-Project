It feels like someone is following my every footstep around every corner,
And there are times when I know I've felt someone else with me.

I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.
I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.

I'm never giving up till I find you.
I'll never rest until I find you.

I refuse to rest and I refuse to sleep until I have you in my sights.
It's gone too far.
A few steps behind.
Where are you now?

What is the meaning, why are you doing this to me?
What is the meaning, why are you doing this to me?

How can you do this?
I'll never sleep until I find you.

I swear I've felt your presence once before,
Or has my paranoia gone far too far?

I can't close my eyes without thinking that I'm losing control!
I can't close my eyes without thinking that I'm losing control!

I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.
I swear I've felt your breath down the back of my neck once before.

I'm never giving up till I find you.
I'll never rest until I find you.
I'll never rest and I'll never sleep till I get my hands around your neck.
It's gone too far. A few steps behind. I'm coming for you now.

All I seem to hear in my head is your voice on repeat,
I close my eyes and I still fucking see you.
All I seem to hear in my head is your voice on repeat,
I close my eyes and I still fucking see you there!
