[Bonus Track]Fuck
Happiness or a broken bottle
This is all that we'll want to see tomorrow
You'll never know, what comes next
Still we'll never trust
Hands around our necks
Around our necks
Blegh

Cross your fingers and hope for the best
Count the lights on the wall, try to get some rest

Everyone feels like they carry a curse
If we lose control, we wont be the first

The road is lost and you start to slip
When you hit the edge, the scales chip
The world might turn, upside down
The night my passion finds another town

We count on lucky stars, one day they'll open up
We live day by day in a shadow of doubt
While the motion slows, as we collide
While I see my life...
Flash before my eyes

You'll never know, what comes next
Still we'll never trust
Hands around our necks
