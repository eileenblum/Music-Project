Hey, hey... They live this day and night.
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise.
Hey, hey... They have the heart to resist.
While the hunters hunt, they will persist.

This is where tragedy is bought and sold.
It seems their pain is worth it's weight in gold.
You know they're here when the water is red.
Our fading life support is hanging by a thread.

A message etched on broken ships.

Hey, hey... They live this day and night.
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise.
Hey, hey... They have the heart to resist.
While the hunters hunt, they will persist.

And you can hear them cry, they're calling out,
to their mother lost, she's bleeding out.
...she's bleeding out.

Their innocence is heaven sent.
Their malevolence, it will not relent.
A graveyard sits upon the shore.
They won't swim together anymore.

The tide will rush with waves of fear.
Selling souls, the devil is near.
The tide will rush in waves of fear.
Selling souls, the devil is near.
...the devil is near.

"If we're gonna survive on this planet, we have to
respect the rights of all those species to survive.
Cause we need them more than they need us."

A message etched on broken ships.
We'll be here til corruption quits.
There is a voice, though they cannot speak.
Not yet ready to admit defeat.

You can hear them cry, they're calling out,
to their mother lost, she's bleeding out.
You can hear them cry, they're calling out,
to their mother lost, she's bleeding out.

Their tragedy is bought and sold.
It seems their pain is worth it's weight in gold.
