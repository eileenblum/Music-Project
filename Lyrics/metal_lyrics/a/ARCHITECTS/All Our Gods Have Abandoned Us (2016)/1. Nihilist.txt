We are beggars. We are so fucking weak.
And once upon a time, we had the world at our feet.
Well, we're all dying to meet our maker,
But all our Gods have abandoned us.

But all our Gods have abandoned us.
This is the great esoteric depression.
We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation.

We are all the shades of misery.
The reigning champions of tragedy.
They use their faith as a weapon,
They count our sins by the seven.
Black water at the gates of heaven.

All hail the corporatocracy.
The word of God is written in binary.
All hail our apostasy,
The dying notes in an unholy symphony.

But all our Gods have abandoned us.
This is the great esoteric depression.
We sold our souls but couldn't buy salvation.

I found God clutching a razor blade.
He said, "Look at the fucking mess they've made."
Theyâd trade their hearts if they were made of gold

We are beggars. We are so fucking weak.
And once upon a time, we had the world at our feet.
Well, we're all dying to meet our maker,
But all our Gods have abandoned us.

All our Gods have abandoned us. [2x]

I found God clutching a razor blade.
He said, "Look at the fucking mess they've made.
They'd trade their hearts if they were made of gold,
But they're as worthless as the souls they sold."
