There was a time for change, I fear it came and went.
Who's gonna pick up the pieces?
Who will be left to repent?
The sun is burnt out black.
Now there's no turning back.
Now there's no turning back.

Yeah, I know you know, we've been living a lie.
Turn a blind eye, until the day we die.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
Maybe we just want to watch the world burn.
We just want to watch the world burn.

Our collapse will be remission.
A planet scarred beyond all recognition.
Suicide in slow motion,
Is this the path that we've chosen?
Too cowardly to face this,
We've got a fucking death wish.

You want to play with fire?
Don't cry when you get burnt.
You gave us life, we gave back death in return.
The sun is burnt out black. Now there's no turning back.

We will consume until there's nothing left.
Remember us as a waste of breath.

Yeah, I know you know, we've been living a lie.
Turn a blind eye, until the day we die.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
Maybe we just want to watch the world burn.
We just want to watch the world burn.

I know you know, we've been living a lie.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
We just want to watch the world burn.

I want to believe that it all counts for something.
The writings on the wall.
It's hard to accept that it was all for nothing.
All for nothing.

Yeah, I know you know, we've been living a lie.
Turn a blind eye, until the day we die.
Maybe we've passed the point of no return.
Maybe we just want to watch the world burn.
We just want to watch the world burn.
