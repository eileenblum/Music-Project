There is no endgame,
So whisper the truth and pass on the blame.
Just put us out of our misery.
This defeat is a victory.
We're burning out, we're fading away.
A failed evolution. Is the problem the solution
That they've been searching for?

We're waiting for the world to save itself.
`Cause nothing is built to last.
We're writing our epitaph.
So reset and start again.
'Cause we all know how this ends,
Before long we'll be dead and gone.

A thorn in the side of the earth.
Where do you draw the line?
A flaw in the design. The rest is history.
This defeat is a victory.
We're burning out, we're fading away.

[Excerpt by Michael Ruppert]

We're all guilty as sin. I feel it under my skin.
Always up in arms, without lifting a finger.

We may be infinite, but this world is not.
Something that we once knew, that we long forgot.

We're waiting for the world to save itself.
`Cause nothing is built to last.
We're writing our epitaph.
So reset and start again.
'Cause we all know how this ends,
Before long we'll be dead and gone.

We're all guilty as sin. I feel it under my skin.
Always up in arms, without lifting a finger.

We may be infinite, but this world is not.
Something that we once knew, that we long forgot.
