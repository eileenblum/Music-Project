As above, so below.
Dismantled piece by piece,
What's left will not decease.
As within, so without.
The seasons bring relief.
Just let me live and die in peace.

I will be consumed, returned into the earth.
Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to.
Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow.
Cut the chord and cast me out.

It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Death is an open door.
It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Decay is the only law.

As above, so below.
Dismantled piece by piece,
What's left will not decease.
As within, so without.
The seasons bring relief.
Just let me live and die in peace.

[Excerpt]
"Change, and everything is change, nothing can be held onto.
To the degree that you go with a stream, you see, you are still.
You are floating with it. But to the degree that you resist the stream,
Then you notice that the current is rushing past you and fighting you.
So swim with it. Go with it. And you're there. You're at rest."

It'll wear you down, through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of it's own, has a mind of its own.
It'll wear you down, through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of it's own, has a mind of its own.

When my heart skips two beats, I am hidden deep, Fast asleep.
The sea will part, where the oceans meet. Finally complete.
It's a promise that you cannot break.

It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Death is an open door.
It's a promise that you cannot break.
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take.
Decay is the only law.

Swan song.
A declaration of endlessness.
I swear I will not look back,
As I return into the black.
When the veil lifts, how will I know?
Will I see God?

As above, so below.
Dismantled piece by piece,
What's left will not decease.
As within, so without.
The seasons bring relief.
Just let me live and die in peace.

[Excerpt]
"You can't hang onto yourself. You don't have to try not to hang onto yourself.
It can't be done, and that is salvation.
Memento Mori; be mindful of death."
