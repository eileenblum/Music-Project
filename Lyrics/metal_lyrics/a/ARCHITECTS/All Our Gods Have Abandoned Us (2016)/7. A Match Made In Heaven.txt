Tell me was it all worth it, to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean havenât sunk this low.

So whoâs left to count the cost?
Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost.
Now weâre gone, left without a trace.
But we took something they cannot replace.

A match made in heaven, paved the road to hell.
Weâve been down this path before.
Cold blooded retribution. So fuck your revolution.

You chew up peace and spit it out as war.
Youâve been feeding the wolf thatâs waiting at the door.

You are rotten to the core.

We found your fingerprints all over the trigger.
If youâre looking for tyrants, take a look in the mirror.

You knew all along, that the cancer would spread.
So donât be surprised to find a price on your head.

Sorry son, but we destroyed your home,
We murdered your family, now youâre on your own.
Collateral damage, face down in the sand.
Watch the dominoes fall, itâs all just part of the plan.

A match made in heaven. Paved the road to hell.
Weâve been down this path before.
Cold blooded retribution. So fuck your revolution.
And every execution, the price of your collusion.

You are rotten to the core.
