Itâs run down
The back of my head
The back of my mind
About a hundred thousand times
And I canât
Seem to shake it
Seem to shake it
Addiction's tying me down

Pull me under
I canât take it much longer
Pull me under
And it will never stop

Youâve got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
Iâve been through this patch before
Youâve got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
Iâve been through this patch before
Iâve been through this patch before

Iâm lost and alone in my head
And I canât make sense of myself
I need to find a simple away
To make this pain just disappear
I know I'll never feel
Safe in my own skin

Pull me under
I canât take it much longer
Pull me under
And it will never stop

Youâve got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
Iâve been through this patch before

Youâve got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
Iâve been through this patch before

No matter how long Iâm gone for
Itâs at the back of my mind
Another sleepless night
Somebody get me home

Iâm so far down
And thereâs anyone can say to me
Iâm so down, Iâm so down

Youâve got a hold on me
Like a constant need inside for nicotine
Iâve been through this patch before
