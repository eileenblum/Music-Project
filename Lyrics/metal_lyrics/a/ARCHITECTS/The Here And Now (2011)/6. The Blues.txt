Never, never lose sight
Of what you started it for
No matter what comes in between

And I used to think
That I knew better than those around me
But something changed along the way
And youâre the reason Iâm wanting to stay

I used to sink and now I swim
Iâve had to work for everything

When will you recognize your it, youâre the reason I feel so alive
And none else comes in between

I used to think
That I knew better than those around me
But something changed along the way
And youâre the reason Iâm wanting to stay

I canât turn my back and leave you
After all youâve done for me
I canât turn my back and leave you
After all youâve done for me

The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me and I canât make sense of it
The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me
I wish it was you instead
The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me and I canât make sense of it
The blues have wrapped their arms
Around me

Oh how I wish it was you instead

I never knew I could feel like this

The blues have wrapped their arms
Oh how I wish it was you instead
The blues have wrapped their arms
Oh how I wish it was you instead
The blues have wrapped their arms
Oh how I wish it was you instead
