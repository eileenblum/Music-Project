Burn everything you have
And leave it all behind
Lose all your inhibitions
I'll take the mess you made
And I'll make it beautiful
Oh if time only stood still for ever

Ohhh

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again

This moment that we're in
Is slow and disappointing
Time will never stand still for ever
If you take this chance we've got
We can make it beautiful
If you'd take my word
I'd be your saviour

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile
Hold out your hands
And lean upon me
I'll be the one to make you smile again

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me

Hold out your hands
And lean upon me

Ohhhhhhhh

Burn everything you have
And leave it all behind
Lose all your inhibitions
I took the mess you made
And made it beautiful
Oh if time only stood still for ever
For ever
