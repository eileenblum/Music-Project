[featuring Greg Puciato of The Dillinger Escape Plan]

Iâm astounded Iâm looking for a reason to leave
Iâm astounded Iâm looking for a reason to leave
The years Iâve put into everything I have
Everything I am

Iâm needing to find some peace of mind
To stop me leaving it all behind
These eyes have seen everything
But Iâll keep looking

Itâs time to realise that my head
Is trying to take me down
Itâs time to realise that my head
Is trying to push
Trying to push me out

Iâm screaming out for help
Months
Years
Nobody hears
Iâm screaming out, Iâm screaming out
Itâs time to realise that my head
Is trying to take me down
Iâm screaming out to no-one


Iâm astounded still looking for a reason to leave
Iâm astounded still looking for a reason to leave

The years Iâve put into everything I have now
The years that Iâve put into I am now

Iâm needing to find some peace of mind
To stop me leaving it all behind
These eyes have seen everything
But Iâll keep looking

Itâs time to take a step back
Look at my life and
Find a stable place to hide
Itâs time to take a step back
Look at my life and find
A stable place to hide
Itâs time to take a step back
Look at my life and
Find a stable place to hide
Stable place to hide

Live everyday like your last
And take nothing for granted
Iâll live everyday like my last
And Iâll take none of this for granted 

Love as you want to be loved
And live the way that you know you should
Keep the good ones by your side
You never know when they might fly up and away

Forever in mind, my mind
Iâll be by your, your side
Forever in my mind, youâll be there
