Maybe we'll never learn
The fire at the gates is our saving grace
Remember, we were born to burn
There is a holy hell where can we save ourselves

There is a holy Hell
Where we can save ourselves

We will be cast out of paradise
It's a long ascent out of the black
But we all have to sacrifice
Hang the iconoclast
And kiss the feet of the amnesiac
'Cause the moment is dead when I'm lost in the past

Maybe we'll never learn
The fire at the gates is our saving grace
Remember, we were born to burn
There is a holy hell where can we save ourselves

But now the rivers are running red
And the skies have been set ablaze
I've been feeling the worst again
Heavenly terrorist, have you been mourning over yesterday
Don't forget to breathe when the knife begins to twist

Fuck this self pity, it's not that hard to see
We get one chance, these wounds will set me free
There's poison on the key, it brings you to your knees
But even the mountains erode in the rain

A single spark can start a forest fire
Light one match and burn down the empire
There's gold buried in the blue
Uh!
There's gold buried in the blue

Holy Hell, I've got nothing left to lose
And I can't tell there's gold buried in the blue

Maybe we'll never learn
The fire at the gates is our saving grace
Remember, we were born to burn
There is a holy hell where can we save ourselves

Holy Hell, I've got nothing left to lose
And I can't tell there's gold buried in the blue

But even the mountains erode in the rain

A single spark can start a forest fire
Light one match and burn down the empire
There's gold buried in the blue
There's gold buried in the blue
