We suffer to survive
Are we desperate creatures crawling in the dirt?
Or are we lonely preachers
Hiding our beating hearts?
We sow the wind and reap the storm
Don't say you haven't been warned
No future's written
There's endless possibility
We suffer to survive
If hope is a prison
Then maybe faith will set me free
We suffer to survive
Am I just a victim?
Drifting in the raging sea
We suffer to survive
If a kingdom resides
Behind my own eyes
I've got to catch the stone and cradle the wave
Damnation is just a daydream away
But still we carry on
If I'm God in disguise
Praying for the rain
And if our demons decide
Then is this all in vain?
It's time to confess
I haunt this flesh
I answer my own prayers
I bid my own despair
There's a lesson in this
What I resist persists
And damnation, is just a daydream away
