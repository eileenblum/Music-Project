When I leave this skin and bone
Beyond my final heartbeat
I'll dismantle piece by piece
And I will know that death is not defeat
Holding on tight to what's left of our time
We've hidden away
But it's in the design
Why do we fight what we can't define?
Don't be afraid, we all cross the same line
Into the night we burn and rage
In death we repay for time on this stage
The lights are bright but don't lose your way
'Cause once it ignites
The flame must decay
Now you're finally complete
I will see you where oceans meet
Past and present merge
Light and dark will converge
Time will overthrow our reign on this throne
The everlasting sleep
Returning through the veil
Far beneath the deep
Another soul sets sail
