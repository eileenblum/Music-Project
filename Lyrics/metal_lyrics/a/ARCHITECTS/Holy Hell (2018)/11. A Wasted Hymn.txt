(All is not lost)
(All is not lost)
(All is not lost)
(All is not lost)

(All is not lost)
(All is not lost)
(All is not lost)
(All is not lost)

Waited for a sign
Washed up on the shoreline
I'll always carry the cross
But all is not lost

(All is not lost)
I just can't relate
(All is not lost)
A crack the floodgate
(All is not lost)
Life comes at a cost
(All is not lost)
But all is not lost

Is this penance for my sins
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy ghost
Nothing lasts forever
Now it's time to sink or swim
I've got nothing except this wasted hymn
Holy ghost
Nothing lasts forever

Taking back what's mine
But it's lost to the skyline
A bridge I cannot cross
But all is not lost

(All is not lost)
Now there's no escape
(All is not lost)
God, what a sorry state
(All is not lost)
Love comes at a cost
(All is not lost)
But all is not lost

Is this penance for my sins
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy ghost
Nothing lasts forever
Now it's time to sink or swim
I've got nothing except this wasted hymn
Holy ghost
Nothing lasts forever

Can you feel the empty space
Can you feel the fire at the gates
Can you live a life worth dying for

Can you feel the empty space
Can you feel the fire at the gates
Can you live a life worth dying for

Can you feel the empty space
Can you feel the fire at the gates
Can you live a life worth dying for

Is this penance for my sins
I gave everything for this phantom limb
Holy ghost
Nothing lasts forever

Now it's time to sink or swim
I've got nothing except this wasted hymn
Holy ghost
Nothing lasts forever
