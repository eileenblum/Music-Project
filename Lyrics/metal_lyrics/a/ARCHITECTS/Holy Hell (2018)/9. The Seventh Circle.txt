Bleh!

I don't wanna dream anymore
I've buried it all too deep
Ah!
Every waking moment is war
This is the seventh circle
Bleh!

I'm stepping off the edge
I think I'd prefer oblivion
I feel the blood drain from my face
Maybe it's better to never have been

Too afraid to connect
What can I do to repent
I've got to settle my regrets
But first I've gotta accept
Some of us burn too bright
I'm holding on too tight
I think I'm done with reality

I don't wanna dream anymore
I've buried it all too deep
Every waking moment is war
This is the seventh circle
I don't wanna dream anymore
I've buried it all too deep
Every waking moment is war
This is the seventh circle
I don't wanna dream anymore
I've buried it all too deep
Every waking moment is war
This is the seventh circle
