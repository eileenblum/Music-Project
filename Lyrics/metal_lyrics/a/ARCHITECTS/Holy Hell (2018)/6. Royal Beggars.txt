Royal beggars
Royal beggars
Do you
Do you
Do you wanna
Live forever
Live forever
Alone
Alone
Alone

'Cause we're broken
All hope is dead but we're coping (coping)
Somebody save our souls

Like a bird in a cage
Trying to fly away
Is this the price that we have to pay
Overflowing with rage
Yet we still obey
'Cause we're asleep in a hurricane

Bitter lovers
Bitter lovers
Let go
Let go
Let go 'cause it's
Now or never
Now or never
Breathe in
Breathe out
Breathe in

'Cause we're choking
And left for dead but we're coping (coping)
Somebody save our souls

Like a bird in a cage
Trying to fly away
Is this the price that we have to pay
Overflowing with rage
Yet we still obey
'Cause we're asleep in a hurricane

Are you listening, you may not have noticed
We have totally lost our way
Are you lost in the clouds or can you hold your focus
It's ourselves that we will betray

Are you listening, you may not have noticed
We have totally lost our way
Are you lost in the clouds or can you hold your focus
It's ourselves that we will betray

Like a bird in a cage
Trying to fly away
Is this the price that we have to pay
Overflowing with rage
Yet we still obey
'Cause we're asleep in a hurricane

We sit on a throne waiting for god to bend the knee
But we're nothing more than royal beggars

Yeah!

Uh, blegh!

But I'm as guilty as the next man
Our eyes are open but we're not listening
