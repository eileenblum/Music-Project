[Oria: Candice Night]

[Oria:]
Rest your mind, Silver Maiden
Don't fear
The things that happen to you now can't be helped
Be strong and think of your love, your strength
Beauty and purity hold the spirit where it can never be tarnished

Sleep, sleep
Dream, dream
Don't fear, don't fear
Remember love
Remember love...
