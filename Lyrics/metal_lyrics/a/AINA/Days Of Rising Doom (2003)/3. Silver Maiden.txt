[Storyteller:]
The streets were never more grateful
To be walked upon until she was born
And when she's finished bathing
How her absence water mourns
The sky would blush in the setting sun
underneath her lovely gaze
and that her eyes should come to rest
upon the moon, it stays

[translation:]
(The Silver Maiden walks
forever will her beauty shine
The Silver Maiden)

[Narrator:]
Oria Allyahan, her name the heavens sing
And to her all the wonders it can bear
The world will bring
Fair Silver Maiden of Aindahaj,
May you remain so pure
For joy itself was never so bright as you,
You may be sure

[Chorus:]
In the Eve of Evermore she walks
The Silver Maiden
Her beauty and her innocence
Perfume the air like sweet incense
In the Eve of Evermore she walks
The Silver Maiden

Oria Allyahan, her name rings out renown
And every soul is certain
She is destined for the crown
The sons of King Taetius
Have long held her in praise
And one will surely win her hand
To rule throughout the days

[Chorus]
