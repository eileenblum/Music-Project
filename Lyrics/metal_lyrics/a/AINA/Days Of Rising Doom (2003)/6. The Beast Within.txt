[Torek &amp; Sorvahr: Thomas Rettke]

[Torek &amp; Sorvahr:]
Pulse and rage within my veins
Oh, Mother Night, fulfil me
Thick and black my will remains
Oh, Mother Night, come thrill me
The foulest deeds no man can think
Oh, Mother Night, you teach me
The darkness calls and breeds the stink
Oh, Mother Night, you reach me

[Chorus:]
Then heed the calling of the dark
And feed the Beast within
Your willingness will leave its mark
And then the Beast will win
Horrid beings worship me
Oh, Mother Night, I love them
They give me power that I need
Oh, Mother Night above them
My strength is growing here within
Oh, Mother Night, you read me
And Sorvahr brims beneath my skin
Oh, Mother Night, they need me

[Chorus]

[Krakhon Choir:]
Naschtok brutah'k goh sha turh
Trahol Sorvahr kop da furh! [2x]

[translation:]
(All bow down to Naschtok
hail to Sorvahr, to imminent destruction!)

[Torek &amp; Sorvahr:]
I feel the change
It's taking place
No one shall dare
To challenge me!

Pulse and rage within my veins
Oh, Mother Night, fulfil me
Thick and black my will remains
Oh, Mother Night, come thrill me

[Chorus]
