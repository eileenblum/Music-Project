[Narrator: Michael Kiske]

[Narrator:]
Blessed land, the shining star
Once again in light you are
Broken lives are mended
Though minds never forget their scars

[Angelic Ainae Choir:]
Aindahaj, etinae shalae outhaed infinisme
Aindahaj, yathe jebri swrutaen caore shawrtoumisme

[translation:]
(Aina, your infinite beauty restored
Aina, perhaps this time it will remain always)

[Narrator:]
Blessed land, your Queen's returned
The fires purging Naschtok burn
Broken hearts are tended
Though lonely lovers will always yearn

[Angelic Ainae Choir:]
Detha ritou jaeneb Ainaen 
Esswr xoujaen hemaldath
Lem shawretou d'elaewr enon
Valaewrth ritanwr lordath

[translation:]
(Light shines again
in the House of Ainaen 
Forever is a long time 
Better to be cautious)
