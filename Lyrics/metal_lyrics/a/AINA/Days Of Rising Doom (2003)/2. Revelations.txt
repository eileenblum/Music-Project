[Narrator:]
Blessed land, the shining star
In the west she rests in light
Dark skies, hard times kept afar
But in time she'll find her sight

[Angelic Ainae Choir:]
Aindahaj etin shalae infinisme ebrony

[Narrator:]
To the sun she turns her head
Unknown in her home steals fate
And to the King there come the Prophets
But he hears without fear what they state

[Angelic Ainae Choir:]
Aindahaj etin shalae infinisme ebrony
Touay soltn etinae bonitri d'esrony
Shawr ousmi Cessnella adouthe yaemr
Thnaton gliu swrutaena jewri outhe taemr

[translation:]
(Aina, your beauty seems so infinite
and trust in it though you may
don't turn your ears from the Holy Voice
for darkness comes your way)

[The Prophets:]
Demons of wrath creep up behind us
Fingers of steel reach out to bind us
Sorrow and despair can we foresee
In the Oracles
The Holy Voice calls down its warning
Don't turn your back on what he's warning!

Darkness and death will swarm around us
The dark won't relent until it's found us
Horror and despair can we foresee
In the Oracles
The Holy Voice calls down its warning
Don't turn your back on what he's warning!

[King Taetius:]
Look around this land, you fools!
No devilry resides here
Away with thy malignant thoughts
Rejoice in light tat shines here

Look into your hearts, you fools!
What ill could here befall us?
For centuries we've known no war
No weapons shall recall us
