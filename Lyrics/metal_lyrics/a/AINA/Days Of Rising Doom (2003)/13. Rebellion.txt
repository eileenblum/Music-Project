[Backing vox: Tobias Sammet]

[Talon:]
The mountains are calling
The heavens, they beckon her home
Our sadness is falling
We'll take back our fate on our own

So hear what I tell you
It's time we strengthen our land
It's true, He can smell you
But let them come, this time we'll stand
Up and fight!

[Chorus:]
We'll take back our land
Take all the fret they've made
Take back he Hand
Make them regret that they
Ever turned their sights on Aina!

It's time Oriana
Was restored her rightful place
It's now going on a
Long time we've been running the race

We've been lost without her
No more confusion will reign
Te future's about her
Out liberty we will reclaim
Once again!

[Chorus]

No more disparity
Out with insanity
Peace for eternity
We'll drive out the Demons
And make sure they never return!

So hear what I tell you
It's time we strengthen our land
It's true, He can smell you
But let them come, this time we'll stand
Up and fight!

[Chorus]
