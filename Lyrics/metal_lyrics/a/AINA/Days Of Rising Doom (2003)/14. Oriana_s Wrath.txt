[Sorvahr: Thomas Rettke]

[Chorus]
[Oriana &amp; Aina Choir:]
Today we ride!
Today all wrath abides!
We ride to win!
We won't give in 
We'll define the meaning of victory!

[Syrius &amp; Krakhon Choir:]
Today we ride!
Today all wrath abides!
We ride to win!
We won't give in 
We'll define the meaning of victory!

[Syrius:]
Halt! My fighters,
But who is that there?
At the defensive line rides 
A maiden so fair
But, no, it can't be!
Oh, yes, it is she!
Do not charge ahead
There rides my love Nali! 

[Oriana:]
Halt! My people,
But what is this now?
At the offensive line rides 
A face that I know
But, no, it can't be!
Oh, yes, it is he!
He holds up his hand
He calls my name: "Nali!"

Oh, yes, it is Syrius
The Son of the wicked Sorvahr
But soon you will see
Soon you'll agree
He's not as you would think 
Him to be

[Chorus]

Sorvahr:
My son, how dare you disobey me!
I sent you to destroy
Not to make peace!
I cast you down from the throne
Renounce your name as my own
You're truly a son of a bitch
I've no use for you
Now die!

[Chorus]

[Oriana:]
Oh, no
Please, no...

This has gone too far
I have had enough!
You have made us bleed
All our world a ruin 
I will not stand anymore!
Now see how it feels

I cast you down from your throne
Renounce your name ever known
You nasty, sick son of a bitch
I've no use for you
No pity for you
Your reigning is through
Now DIE!!!

[Chorus]
