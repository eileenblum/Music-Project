[Sorvahr: Thomas Rettke]

[Krakhon Choir:]
Syrius! [3x]

[Sorvahr:]
All behold- my masterpiece shines
He'll take control and blur all the lines

All bow down - he plan is complete
He'll wear the crown and taste of the sweet
Our wondrous dawning is nigh
Now sing out his song to the sky!

[Chorus:]
Praise unto the Child of Darkness
Soon the Hand will strike out again
Praise unto the Son of Sorvahr
Destiny's spoken
We'll ride out to rule again

[Krakhon Choir:]
Syrius! [3x]

[Sorvahr:]
Hear me now, his name rings out proud
And Syrius will shake all the ground

Reign supreme, will our little Master
Lead the team to crush all the bastards
Our wondrous dawning is nigh
Now sing out his song to the sky!

[Chorus]

All behold- my masterpiece shines!

[Chorus]
