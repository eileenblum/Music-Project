[Talon: Glenn Hughes]
[Tyran: Andre Matos]

[Talon(with Aina Choir*):]
My heart has left my chest
My life, my love is gone
I've failed my land, my Lady
Now everything is wrong

I should have stood my ground
I should have made them fall
I feel I've failed *Aina
I couldn't stop them all

[Tyran:]
But Sire, don't lose hope
Look to the rising sun
You still have Oriana
And she has everyone

The seed of your true love
Lies in this shining gem
Her powers are the greatest
We've seen in all the land

There can be no more doubt
That evil will be back
And without some defences
Our empire will crack

[Talon(with Aina Choir*):]
But how can I go on
And how will we survive?
I'm only left to hope that
Our love will stay alive

We don't know where they are
We don't know what he's done
She's out there *all alone
*And he's already won

[Tyran:]
But Sire, keep your faith
Look to the rising sun
You still have Oriana
And she has everyone

The seed of your true love
Lies in this shining gem
Her powers are the greatest
We've seen in all the land

There can be no more doubt
That evil will be back
And without some defences
Our empire will crack

[Talon:]
Then take her far from here
That is the only way
Our star will be protected
Until that fated day

Then fight she must beside us
And pray must we to win
For with our Oriana
There can be peace again
