All the hurtful words you preach
Based on fear disguised as love
Claim your god all powerful
Why do you feel the need
To spin propaganda in his name
Your words speak for yourself
Quoting phrases that work for you
Leaving out those that don't
Twisting what you say is his truth
Into the lies you create
Saying that humanity rightly deserves
Hell for being created in his image
Fear of change
Lack of faith
There is none righteous
Not even one
Your desires are not heaven
But earthly recognition
For all your selfless work
Forcing others to be scared
And look outside themselves for answers
Answers that have been reworked
Edited by frightened ones like you
Your life will be seen for what it is
A sham frozen in the past
