Beaten
Bloody
Bruised
Flesh barely holding you together
Pelvis shattered
Bone splinters
Broken ribs
Labored breathing
Useless limbs
Riddled with unnatural bends
Deep crimson ribbons mark your disrespect
Gravel
Scraping away at your wounds
Road full of teeth
Mouth full of pavement
Looking up with your skidmark grin
Ground beneath my heal
Feel the extent of my fury
