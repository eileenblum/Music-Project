Embracing the Pain
Tongues of acid licking hungrily
Every nerve's anguish
Bursting forth hot cinders
Reward gasps of thirst
Choking down poison of despair
Sorrow dispersing through the soul
Existence becoming rhythm of agony
Pain sweeping over in agry waves
Swallowed ever deeper and darker
Beneath the roar of torment
Misery fills every tortured pore
The suffering has a beginning
Does not imply there is an ending
Shadows murmuring of pleasure
Now only excruciating demons
Inflicted upon hurtful memories
Embrace the pain
