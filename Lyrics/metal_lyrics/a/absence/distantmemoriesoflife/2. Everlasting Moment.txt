[Music by Absence, Lyrics by Timo Lehtonen]

Someone once said
"Have hope and have no fear"
I had only one of them
Couldn't make it disappear
I tried to break the cycle
I tried to release myself
But now because of you
I'm tied to this hell

Stuck into this void
Here is no time
Every second feels like forever

Why don't you
Let me go
As we all
I'm alone

Take away my pain
This is not your struggle
All your efforts in vain
I've already lost this battle

A prison without escape
There's only one way out
But no one can hear
When I scream and shout
Can't you see I suffer
Take a look in my eye
And see my last request
I wish to die

What have I done to deserve fate like this?

What have I done to deserve fate like this... far worse than death?

Why don't you
Let me go
As we all
I'm alone

Take away my pain
This is not your struggle
All your efforts in vain
I've already lost this battle

On this everlasting moment I curse the day I was born
