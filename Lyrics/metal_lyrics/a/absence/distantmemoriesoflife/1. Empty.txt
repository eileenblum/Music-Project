[Music by Absence, Lyrics by Timo Lehtonen]

Snow covers the earth
It's winter once again
There's no rebirth
This time dark will reign

Nothing feels the same anymore
All colours faded away

Old thoughts returning to me
And it's hard to deny them
Towards the pitch-black sea
Drawn away from false haven

This festering wound
In my mind is taking over
Forgetting so soon
How it was to hold her
Distant memories of life
A faint, dying whisper

The icy water cast my reflection
I can't recognize myself
This is only a shell
'Cos I am empty inside

Nothing left to offer
Nothing left to say
It would be a torture
To live one more day
