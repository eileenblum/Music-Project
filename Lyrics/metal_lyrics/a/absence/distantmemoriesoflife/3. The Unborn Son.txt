[Music by Absence, Lyrics by Timo Lehtonen]

This can't be true
All I see is ruins
I close my eyes
And hope this could be undone
The further I go
Less human I feel
This tragic scene
Is now reality

No one else did survive
No one else left alive

This innocent one
Doesn't even get a tomb
'Cos the unborn son
Dies into mother's womb

Eerie silence
Has filled the air
Something so precious
Is now forever lost
How can they be so blind
This way reaching the light
Priviledge of misunderstanding
Key to their anger never ending
