[ Lyrics: Ashkan Hadavand ]

Why canât I find a clue to answer this question?
That why I feel this is another deception
Yes I have to suffocate this inside me
A holy love or just a mind's desire

All my life I tried to be a believer
And every tread Iâve stepped my eyes went darker
Just like a carter drives to love and hate
A horse beheaded and the other one inroad

When the love comes out of mind walls
The curtains fall: eclipse appears
All the beauty youâve drawn in the sky
Is whole-covered by the clouds of truth

You believe that the truth lies
In the heart of hesitation
I can see your awakened eyes
Dream, no cancellation

When the love comes out of mind walls
The curtains fall: eclipse appears
All the beauty youâve drawn in the sky
Is whole-covered by the clouds of truth
