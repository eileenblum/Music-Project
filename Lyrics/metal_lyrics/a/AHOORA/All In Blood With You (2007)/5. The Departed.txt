[ Lyrics: Milad Tangshir ]

Midnight again, pale moon is posing
Crawling in veins, hard times of choosing
Reinventing my broken dreams
Sacrifice
He buries it, my poor dream
He is coming to take it away
He comes to burn my sight
Like every day and every other nights
I should sit here in the dark
And watch him fades,
With my bleeding eyes

Midnight again, waking in an electric vision
Running in woods, from inner damnation
These last of dreams, oh no please
Feed them worms
Can't let him burn, my poor dream
Hidden be thy name
That's the deal with the devil, Yeah!

He comes to burn my sight
Like every day and every other nights
I should sit here in the dark
And watch him fades,
With my bleeding eyes
