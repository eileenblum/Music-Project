[ Lyrics: Milad Tangshir ]

Where are you? Where?
I hear your breath
I am melting inside a frozen dream
Release the beast, how could you avoid it from me?

All the signs lead to me
You could read all the walls
They're all covered by my name: the bloody fame
Speak carefully my friend
My passion may hear you!

Push your sting in, feed me once more
Take me under, to the heart of darkness

No, don't get me wrong
They're all so tempting
And all I have got:
Inactive resistance

Conceal, condone
Convict, confess

Forced visions reborn to me
I hate to guess what will be
Glittering rays in my sky
That's the script for the new found rage

Push your sting in, feed me once more
Take me under, to the heart of darkness
