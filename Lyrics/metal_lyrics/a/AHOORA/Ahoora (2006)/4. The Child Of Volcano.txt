[Lyrics: K. KIA &amp; M. TANGSHIR]

Somewhere we don't know where
Sometime, when there was no time
The mountain grumbled, water run dry
Seventh year of drought, now was gone

Then an old man had a dream
Saw a boy, where the water begins
He was told: "He is the one to save you
The magic key that turns the voodoo"

"Take him to the depth of stones
Where the earth is fiery and torn
Beware no one should get there
And he shouldn't leave forever"

Midnight visions all around him, in the dark the snow is glowing
He'll be singing all the night long, and break the spell singing this song
Moon is shining stars are falling, cold and gently wind is blowing
As he sings alone in darkness, veins of life are full of water

Days and years all passed by
No one moved and no one died
It was just another night
He looked up into the sky

Midnight visions all around him, in the dark the snow is glowing
He'll be singing all the night long, and break the spell singing this song
His mind's flying over sadness, before his eyes loneliness dies

What's the most beautiful thing you've seen?
Do you believe ancient stars have gone by?
You believe heavier than rocks I've felt
The universe, after these clouds, will it end

Everyday I close my eyes
So I can gaze at midnight
Silent and pure, she stands above me
I call her through the dark

Betrayed words, echoed in vain
The stones replied, so she couldn't hear
I'm climbing up with the fear inside
Take it anymore, I couldn't bear

As he was climbing up, volcano screamed the first fire
Mother didn't want to lose her own child

As I'm climbing up, the mountain is angry
Fiery stones, filling the hole
This is the last chance, waiting for me
To get back to my home
People will die, drought will come
Mother is coming, like the eyes

What should I do?
Who should I run to?
Ways, that I chose none

Choose to find myself
Choose to ride in my way
Now, I go nowhere
