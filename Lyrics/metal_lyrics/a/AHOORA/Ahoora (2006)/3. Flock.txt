[Lyrics: K. KIA &amp; M. TANGSHIR]

Confess now, I chose this fate
Colors change, thousand faces
Kind faces, all in disguise
Abandon all the lies
Join, here we rise
Higher steps wait for me
I will ride in path of glory

A perfect pattern, not lower
No will, but with power
A sacred lie leads to control
Pulling down my own strings
Someone shake my wooden wings
It's true, I'm just a toy but I'm so skilled in my role

Remember it well, they taught me with insist
Blindness is the best heaven's gift
From then, in truth I'm blind
So stronger in will and mind
Truth is kind of contrast
Not myself, taught me just to be
The matter: to be or not to be
From then, I'm not on my own
Buy nothing sold my soul
Man needs to deal for existence

Dance with us, dolls are dancing in selfdom funeral
Mirrors all lying, inside and outside antithetical
Here is battlefield, fight until selfdom will be fallen
Controls denied, well done all you pretty dolls

I don't know, what happens at the end of the day
Maybe someday earth throws us away
Instinct, God's true mistake
They are all a bunch of suckers
Lost and trapped, a few clockers
We will scream with agony
No one doubts in your victory
(Kill our enemy)

Dance with us, dolls are dancing in selfdom funeral
Mirrors all lying, inside and outside antithetical
Here is battlefield, fight until selfdom will be fallen
Controls denied, well done all you pretty dolls

If earth bears them more
