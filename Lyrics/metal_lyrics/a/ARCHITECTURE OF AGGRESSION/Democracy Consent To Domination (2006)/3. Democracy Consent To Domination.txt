An innocent seed was sown
Humanity's big white hope was grown
But what would've been pure
Was poisoned, turned obscure
By it's own gardeners
By human weakness
By greed, for power

This was our hope
This is democracy
Where everyone has their say
Where freedom abounds
What gentle lies, what sweet fallacies
Freedom has a price
And you have to be rich to afford it!
Education only stupifies

[Chorus 1:]
Democracy was a good idea
That was brutalised
Into Servitutde
Like a child lying in its own
Blood and faeces
Soiled beyond all redemption

[Chorus 2:]
DEMOCRACY
CONSENT TO
DOMINATION

Control of its population
Is the major task of any state
It is a dictatorship
With and ever-changing face

Presidents are but puppets
Of the global corporations
The banks, the shadowy bloodlines
The rich, the powerful
Democracy's about choice
When last were we allowed to make one?
Politicians are civil servants
Yet they tell us what to do

The police operate through fear
If we live in a free society
Why do we need clandestine
Intelligence agencies?

We are a race of sheep
Enslaved by democracy
That is the truth behind the truth

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

Now the fruit is ripe
Beautiful on the outside
Bu maggot infested
Rotten to the core
Corruption is everywhere
What can we do
To combat this plague
That is slowly killing us?!!

This was our hope
This is democracy
Where everyone has their say
Where freedom abounds
What gentle lies, what sweet fallacies
Freedom has a price
And you have to be rich to afford it!
Education only stupifies

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
