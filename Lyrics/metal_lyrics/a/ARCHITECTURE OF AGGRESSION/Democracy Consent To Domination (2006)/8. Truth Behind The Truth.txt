I do not believe in your democracy
Your enslavement of the masses
It sickens me

I hate your religions, your weapons of control
Misinformation for global domination

You make us believe in choice
Yet you limit our choices
It does not matter what we choose
For the outcome is always the same

[Chorus:]
Truth behind the truth
Lie behind the lie
Truth behind the truth

You make us believe in education
Yet you limit our education
Twist the truth
Distort the past
To enslave our future

Through mas media you subjugate the world
How quickly you distort the truth
Truth becomes false
False becomes truth
Fiction becomes reality
Reality becomes fiction
Misinformation rules our arguments
Creates our wars, our heroes, our beliefs

I do not believe in your democracy
Your enslavement of the masses
It sickens me

[Chorus]

I hate your religions, your weapons of control
Misinformation for global domination
