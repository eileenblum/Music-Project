See
The golden smile
Ingesting all your money

[Chorus 1:]
Deceiver
Coaxial cable Christ, fool us
With the images you send
Demonise free thinking
Believer
We'll buy it wholesale, only $19.99
But wait there is more!
You feed us our opinions
Receiver
Blasting us with the images
We're too enthralled to look away

[Chorus 2:]
God can see you
He's everywhere
On every channel, watching you
With and unblinking eye
He never sleeps
Crucified on all frequencies
On a cross of microwaves
Plug and pray
God is coming this summer
To own on video and DVD

All bow down before the almighty
Networks
Obey
We humbly grovel before you
Master
And sell ourselves into servitude
Utter our devotion everyday
It is you we obey
In our living room shrines

Your service all day, every day
Entertaining, educating
Indoctrinating
Just tune in and tune out
Your light upon us shine
Feed us your images
Feed us your bullshit

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

Our father in the living room
Hallowed be thy name
Thy endorsement come, thy will be done
No questions, no exceptions
Entertain us please, on a daily basis
Warp our minds, steal our thoughts
Spit out drivel and keep us occupied
Lead us into temptation
And deliver us to enslavement
For ours is your kingdom
And your power and your glory
FOREVER
AND EVER
THE END!
