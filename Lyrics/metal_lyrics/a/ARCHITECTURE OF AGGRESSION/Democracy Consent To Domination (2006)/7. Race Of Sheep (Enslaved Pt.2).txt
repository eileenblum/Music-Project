Groping blindly for answers unseen
Making true life seem so obscene
Blindness infecting, cover the world
Accepting all that you have been told

Pawns, just cogs of a bigger machine
Parts you can't see
Willing automations

Race of sheep give away their own free will
Global conscience imprisons itself
You are the ones who hold their own keys
But would sell it to be so naive

Pawns, just cogs of a bigger machine
Parts you can't see
Willing automations
In a bid for global domination

[Chorus:]
The choice to be stupid is no choice at all
Watching and laughing as you are enthralled

Pacify you with "eternal life"
Symbolically setting you up for the fall
When you realise there is no god at all
Selling the lie just to keep you blind
Embrace the truth and free your mind!

Groping blindly for answers unseen
Making true life seem so obscene
Blindness infecting, cover the world
Accepting all that you have been told

Pawns, just cogs of a bigger machine
Parts you can't see
Willing automations

[Chorus]
