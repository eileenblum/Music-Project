The machinery turns
the cogs are interconnected
the safeguards against
free thought are in place
the systems of control are everywhere
perfect little systems
that keep us occupied
keeps us distracted

From an early age they whip into us
the litany of subservience
the cruel masters force down
religion on us
sinking in its twin fangs and fear and guilt

enforcing the fact that
being human is wrong
being different is dangerous
that choice is bad

the cogs move, the clock ticks
everything is in its place
keep them docile
keep them stupid
schools are indoctrination camps

learn our ways
they're the truth
do not question, do not ask
just trust in us
conform, be a good little sheep

welcome to our new age
where slavery is still alive
economic bondage keeps us in check
don't pursue your dreams
work hard for a living
pay your bills, pay your tax
money is status, status is power
work harder, earn more
be blind, be a slave
work harder, you'll like it!

systems of control
assuring docility
through fear and guilt
breaking down reality
infusing superstition

systems of control
breeding ignorance
education is conditioning
producing mindless drones

systems of control
domination our feelings
through the media
half-formed images
blind us to reality

systems of control
are everywhere
open your eyes
before it's too late!
