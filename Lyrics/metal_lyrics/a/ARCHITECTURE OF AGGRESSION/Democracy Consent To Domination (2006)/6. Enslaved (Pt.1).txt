Entrapped in an illusion
Conform to their confusion
Lies in the form of "truth"

Accept or be cast out
Your belief makes you blind
Obey your god who never existed

Loopholes in his story
But believe for his glory
Focusing the mind. Making it blind
Trusting the words of the dead

Enslaved: Destroy the mind
Engraved: Their belief

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Watch their lies steal your trust

Entrapped in an illusion
Conform to their confusion
Lies in the form of "truth"

Enslaved: Destroy the mind
Engraved: Their belief
