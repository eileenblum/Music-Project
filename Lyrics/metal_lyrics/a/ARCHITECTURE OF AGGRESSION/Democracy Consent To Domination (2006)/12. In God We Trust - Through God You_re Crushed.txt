[I: In God We Trust]

[Chorus 1:]
In god we trust, through god you're crushed
Dominate! Dominate! The creed of Rome
Feed them hate! Feed them hate!
Sin is to procreate!
In god we trust, through god you're crushed!

[Chorus 2:]
Use the might of god, beat them into submission
Dominate! Feed lies
Those they don't understand
Make them hate
Defend your lies
Change the truth
God is infallible
Translation errors
Willful omissions
Censorship

If god is so great, why change his fucking words?
Because it erodes your base of power
Power for the sake of power
Monotheism equals a religious dictatorship

Message of a messiah who wasn't a god
Corrupted further by a disciple of power
Break their spirit
Sell them lies of when they die
Offer them heaven
In exchange for suffering!!

[Chorus 1]

[II: Parasitic Gospels]

Acquiescence
Sheep need a shepherd
A religion of peace?
A religion of love?
By blood, to thy holy throne ascend!
Religions are a cancer
It preys on the weak
It devours the feeble-minded in our society

[Chorus 2]

Discriminate
Destroy
Despoil
In the name of your saviour
Who comes bearing a message of peace?!

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

Message of a messiah who wasn't a god
Corrupted further by a disciple of power
Break their spirit
Sell them lies of when they die
Offer them heaven
In exchange for suffering!!

Parasitic gospels that preach
Total and utter dominance
Give up free thought
We will guide you
Trust in us
Pray for your sins
Glaring contradictions
Outright lies
It strives to conquer
Decrepit institution
Hypocrisy be thy name
Death is your reward

[III: Conquered By The Cross]

Conquered by the cross:
Vacant eyes
Mind devoid of thought

Conquered by the cross:
Meek little lamb
Too afraid of life

Conquered by the cross:
Hatemonger
Ignorance assured

Conquered by the cross:
Mindless drone
Without free thought

Bathed in blood
Clad in hate
Fuelled by power
Ignorance its sword
Knowledge its enemy
That which it cannot
Assimilate
It seeks to destroy
A blood thirsty

Conquered by the cross:
Armies under god
Fight for him

Conquered by the cross:
You raped, plundered
Violated

Conquered by the cross:
Slaughtered innocents
Killed for his glory

Conquered by the cross:
Cultures destroyed
Knowledge is lost!

Power hungry deathcult
Preaching love!
The velvet gauntlet,
Relentless war machine
Crushes all within its grip
Destroying free thought
Civilisations wiped out
Knowledge burned

[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
