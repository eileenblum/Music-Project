I looked for river
Ancestors who gave birth to us
Man fish, woman bird
Sleeping on the river bed.
I put memories on water
And my lips touched the sky
Water took my name away
And join it with ashes
I looked for river
Ancestors who gave birth to us
Man fish, woman bird
Sleeping on the river bed.
My words will ripple the surface
And bones will move the land.
River bed give birth to life
For there is not the end
that would not be
The beginning
