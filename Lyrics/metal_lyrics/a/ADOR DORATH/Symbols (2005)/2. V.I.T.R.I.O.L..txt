Build a temple from the white stone
Let it not have neither end nor the beginning
Take a sword to your hands
And in this way look for the entrance
There you will find the snake
And grasping it sacrifice it
And enter
Sun is hidden in a star
East in the west
Artist in a masterpiece
With a contribution of grace
You will be returned and led back
To your native land
You will find yourself
When heaven sun
And Luna descend
Joining the opposites
Worship the gold
