I have entered the Universe
Its silence goes to all directions
Endlessly far
I am alone at the zero point
My salvation from chaos of the other worlds
Worlds without stars, galaxies and beings
Space where there is nothing only"myself"
My faith is my truth
And then I can savor
Sunshine and the blue sky
Savor the reality of being the man
Of this planet
The journey to the depths of my own knowledge
Wandering among atoms, cells and organs
That make what I call "myself"
I have been wandering in my brain
And I have been watching neurons
With my heart
I have been watching its pulse
With my blood I have perceived its movement
I have realized how much emptiness
There exist in me
How vast are the energies
Of my own body
I have felt deep respect to
What I bear
And I am
