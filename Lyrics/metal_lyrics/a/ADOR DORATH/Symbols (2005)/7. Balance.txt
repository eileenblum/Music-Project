Alone in the captivity of my thoughts
I search what I may have not lost
Hidden knowledge blown by time
That would give me hope
Loneliness does not give only sadness
Sadness could become a key
The key to lost innocence
The way to find the blown rest
Blind mind led me astray
The scales fell from my eyes
And I search for the cause
Life in memories sidetracks
The dream became a silent movie
The dream that used to live wanted to survive
But I woke up
Morning haze got into my eyes
Numbness at down of a new day
How should I give things their order
How to find the meaning
I would give everything for that grains of sand...
I stand in vacuum waiting
For arrival
Slowly, as slow as the water flows
I look truth in the face
Reverse the faith
Wipe off the hatred
I want to wake up
I do not want to dream any more
The creator hands over
And I add my print
We have life we deserve
We perceive it in the same way
As we think about it
We predetermine its shape
