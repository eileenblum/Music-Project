The one who once have learnt how to read Words
Mustn't think of going back
The one who cast away all the memories
Must forget the return
The one who once have set for a journey
Mustn't think of going back
The one who once have seen the mystery
Mustn't think of return
Even if all the creatures bow in front of you
You can't stop you must continue
Even if you think that you have seen the end
You can't stop
You must go on
Even if you are called by my embrace
Even if my lips beg you stay
Forget the return
Even if you are called by my embrace
Even if my heart come to dust
I'll stay in breeze that touch your face
I'll stay in cloud that gives you shade
I'll stay in water that brings new life
I'll stay in sand of the desert
