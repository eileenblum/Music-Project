When I was looking at the laid sky
I was overcome by Inevitable feeling
That eternity and bird's feathers
Are two aspects
Of the unseizeable whirl
Passing sentence over everything
That won't square up
And in this moment I have realized
That every stone seems to be ambiguous in some way
And that it is waiting a lifetime
Hoping that at least a moment
Will show the miracle
That gives lifeless light confidence
To stay in darkness
