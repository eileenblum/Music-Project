She concealed you from herself
When wells opened their arms
And water flooded the world
Firmament trembled
And she was waiting
For the right time to come
You have inherited ties
And when the sky turn red by blood
You will come down to her
There is lust circulating in your veins
Embrace her
She is the Earth
Death is seed for her
Mihi mori lucrum
