Serpent made bed on Crystal Hill
Apparition of Finalty took centuries
When Sinner screamed
Luna had a Laugh and urged the horses
Why should she care about people
Such a beauty has not been seen for ages
Heart was written all over by book till it went black
Nothing left here
But bare consonance
Of Creator
With forked tongue
