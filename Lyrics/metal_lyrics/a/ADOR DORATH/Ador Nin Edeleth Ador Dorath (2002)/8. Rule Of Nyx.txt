Beautiful Night
Your attire covered the countryside and gave it shadows
Only a few sparkling tears stayed on the sky
You sing a silent song
With bat's scream as refrain
Beautiful Night
Silver streams run to the empire
Of wishes an ancient lusts
Where sleeping wait for their time to come
Voices of thousands of wishes are your crown
Beautiful Night
So charming for thousands of years
I am closing my eyes and let
Twilight of feelings
Take me to the times when god in man
Wooed the passions
