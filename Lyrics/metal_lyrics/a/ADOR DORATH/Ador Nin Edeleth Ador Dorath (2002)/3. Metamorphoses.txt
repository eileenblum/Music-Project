Here is a shrine at the end of the earth
It is a heart a hidden cave
It is an anger of metamorphosis
A Snake is born in an oval cave
Embryo of oaths thrust in blood
He started to grow
Till he saturated all prayers
In the rising tide of the Moon
He gave birth to the Last
Without body and breath
He wounded fatally
The body of the shrine
He ended the birth
By consuming himself
