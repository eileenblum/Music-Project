SOMEWHERE FAR AWAY FROM THE MATRIX OF LIFE, I'VE FELT A PRESENCE OF A MYSTICAL POWER. IT SEEMS THAT I'M AWAKE. BUT I DON'T RECOGNIZE ANYTHING. OH PLEASE GIVE ME THE STRENGTH TO ESCAPE THIS FUCKING NIGHTMARE. I WAS AWARE OF THE INFINITE GREATNESS OF THE UNIVERSE. INTO THE MATRIX OF LIFE, I FOUND EVERY PART OF ME. INTO THE MATRIX OF LIFE, I FOUND EVERY PART OF ME, SOMEWHERE YOU CAN'T BRING ME BACK ON THE EDGE OF IGNORANCE. JUST ABOVE A GIANT CIRCLE OF STARS, I SAW THE TRUTH RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR OF MY WILL. JUST ABOVE A CIRCLE OF STARS, I SAW THE TRUTH. CAN YOU SEE THE TRUTH? BEYOND EVERYTHING WE KNOW FROM OURSELVES, THERE IS A FUCKING BEAST INSIDE US ALL. WE MUST FACE IT AND DO NOT FEAR. WHEN THE ILLUSION ENDS THERE IS NOTHING BUT REALITY. WE MUST FACE IT... REALITY.
