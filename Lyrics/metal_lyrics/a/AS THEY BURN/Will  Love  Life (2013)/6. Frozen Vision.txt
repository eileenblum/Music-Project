ALL THOSE DAYS I SPENT BEGGING FOR SOMETHING MEANINGLESS. ALL THOSE DAYS I SPENT COMPLAINING ABOUT MY PROBLEMS WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING. [TO CHANGE THIS] I QUIT THAT SHIT BEFORE MY HEAD EXPLODES. MY FROZEN VISION MAKES ME WANNA DIE. [AND I'M STARTING TO FEEL WORRIED] AND I HATE YOU. I'D RATHER HATE YOU FOR THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE MESSED. WAKE UP, SPEAK UP, AND FIGHT FOR YOUR OWN MIND. STOP PRAYING TO GODS THEY WON'T HELP YOU. WHAT ARE YOU BEGGING FOR? TO CHANGE THIS, I QUIT THAT SHIT BEFORE MY HEAD EXPLODES. I'M SO TIRED OF TRYING TO SEE WHEN THERE AIN'T NOTHING INSIDE. OPEN YOUR HEART AND CLOSE YOUR EYES. MY FROZEN VISION MAKES ME WANNA DIE. [AND I'M STARTING TO FEEL WORRIED] AND I HATE YOU. I'D RATHER HATE YOU FOR THE THINGS THAT YOU'VE MESSED. LIARS BACK OFF! THIS WORLD WILL FIGHT!
