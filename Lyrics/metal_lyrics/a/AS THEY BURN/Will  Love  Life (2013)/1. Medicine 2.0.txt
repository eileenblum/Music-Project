LIGHTS ON, I REMEMBER THAT YOU WERE SO STRONG, BUT NOW YOU'RE GONE. YOU WANT TO CONTROL EVERYTHIN, WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? FLASHBACKS. HOW CAN YOU FEEL SO RELAXED? NOW YOU BETTER DIE. YOU BETRAYED ME BEHIND MY BACK, WHO THE FUCK YOU'RE THINKING YOU ARE? IT WILL BE FOREVER IN YOUR MIND, THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES YOU FEEL, MAKES YOU FEEL THIS WAY IS ALMOST GONE. FORGET THE MAN YOU WERE. NEVER FOLLOW THE DECEIVERS.IF YOU WANNA FAIL YOU'LL BE THE FIRST. THEY WANT TO CONTROL EVERYTHING. FUCKING WASTE OF TIME. THE MEDICINE IS GONE NOW I SEE THESE THINGS THAT YOU REFUSED TO REALIZE. I FOUND THE HIDDEN KEYS OF MY INNER SELF, NOW I WANT TO FLY AWAY. THE MEDICINE IS GONE, NOW I SEE THESE THINGS AND I STILL WANT TO FLY, TO FLY AWAY. IT WILL BE FOREVER IN YOUR MIND. THE ONLY THING THAT MAKES YOU FEEL. MAKES YOU FEEL THIS WAY IS ALMOST GONE. IT'S ALMOST.
