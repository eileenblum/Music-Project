FORGOTTEN, YOU'RE TURNING INTO DUST. YOU GAVE UP WHEN IT SUITED YOU THE BEST. HANDS TIED TO A CHAIR, I THINK OF YOU. YOU LAID ME HERE ROTTING ON THE SHELF. YOU LOST THE URGE AND I M REACHING OUT FOR YOU. YOU ACT LIKE YOU SEE NOTHING. WITHOUT ME YOU RE SUCH A FUCKING MESS. WHEN EVERYTHING FALLS APART ANYTHING CAN STILL BE DONE. STICK TO YOUR FAITH OR GET AWAY, YOU SELFISH COWARD. EVERY MINUTE IS A CHANCE YOU COULD HAVE WON. WHEN EVERYTHING FALLS APART, ANYTHING CAN STILL BE DONE. EVERY MINUTE IS A CHANCE YOU COULD HAVE WON, PLEASE DONT HIDE YOUR FACE INTO YOUR HANDS, WHEN EVERYTHING FALLS APPART, ANYTHING CAN STILL BE DONE, I GAVE EVERYTHING I HAD TO RESCUE YOU, AND EVEN AFTER ALL THE THINGS WE'VE BEEN THROUGH, YOU STILL ACT LIKE YOU SEE NOTHING, SOMEWHERE THERE'S SOMETHING INSIDE OF YOU, YOU'VE LOST, NOTHING, NOTHING INSIDE. NOTHING, NOTHING.
