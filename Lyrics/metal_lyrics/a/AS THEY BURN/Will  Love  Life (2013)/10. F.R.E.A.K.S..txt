COME CLOSER, I GOT A SECRET. WEâRE ALL FUCKED UP, YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS. PUT A GUN TO MY TEMPLE SO I CAN MOVE THROUGH IT. LIKE IN THE OLD TIMES. LOCKED IN LINES YET CHAINLESS. A NEW CONCEPT OF MODERN FREEDOM. DONâT YOU GET IT? WHEN DID YOU MISS THE POINT? HAVE EVER TAKE PSYCHEDELICS? DO NOT TOUCH THIS DO NOT EAT THIS YOUâLL SEE THE WORLD SO WELL THAT YOU WILL HATE. MAN, I WONâT BE SCARED, I CAN EVEN DROP A BULLET IN YOUR HEAD. PULL THE TRIGGER AND RELEASE THE FREAKS. EAT THIS! (I SWEAR I WILL DONâT SHOOT ME). FEEL THIS! (EVERYTHING IS SO CLEAR) LETâ SEE THE SKIMMERS BURN. SHOW ME WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNED. LIKE ANGRY SADIC MONSTERS, WEâLL WATCH YOUR BURN LIKE PAPERDOLLS. WE COME FROM HERE AND FROM NOWHERE. WE DWELL WHERE YOU SCARED. FOLLOW THE WHITE RABBIT STRAIGHT TO THE OVERDOSE. BUT YOU SEEM TO FEEL SO GOOD, I HATE TO SEE YOU LIKE THIS. EAT THE PILL. LIVE TO KILL. FACE THE FREAKS.
