EVERYDAY I WANT TO BE THE SAME MAN TO ALWAYS REMEMBER HOW GOOD I FEEL. SADNESS, PAIN AND HAPINESS, THESE SACRED FEELINGS THAT MADE ME WHAT I AM. AFTER ALL I HAVE NO REGRETS, THEY'RE PIECES OF ECSTASY AND KNOWLEDGE. MY HOME IS IN EVERYPLACE WHERE LIFE IS BREATHING. THESE ENERGIES ARE SO POWERFUL. THEY CAN BUILD A WORLD AND DESTROY EVERYTHING. LOVE IS THE LAW, LOVE IS UNDERWILL. IT CONTROLS YOUR DESIRES AND MAKES MY FUTURE. FREE YOUR MIND FROM IMPRISONMENT, THE CONSCIOUS MAN HAS NO LIMITS BURN YOUR EGO AND RISE YOURSELF. DO NOT FEAR, DO NOT EVER LOOK DOWN. YOUR HOME IS IN EVERYPLACE WHERE LIFE IS BREATHING. THESE ENERGIES ARE SO POWERFUL. THEY CAN BUILD A WORLD AND DESTROY EVERYTHING. DO NOT DWELL IN THE PAST. DO NOT DREAM OF THE FUTURE. FOCUS YOUR MIND ON EACH DAY YOU LIVE. THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE. CAN YOU GET THIS? YOUR SOUL IS A WATERFALL WHERE LIFE IS FLOWING DOWN. SWIMMING UP THE STREAM OF THE PAST TO LEAVE YOUR DEMONS BEHIND YOU. WE CAN BUILD A WORLD AND DESTROY EVERYTHING (EVERYTHING IS FADING SO FAST) BURN YOUR EGO AND RISE YOURSELF. DON'T FEAR, DON'T FEAR, DON'T FEAR, DO NOT EVER LOOK DOWN. LOVE IS THE LAW, LOVE IS UNDERWILL. IT CONTROLS YOUR DESIRES AND MAKES MY FUTURE. FREE YOUR MIND FROM IMPRISONMENT, THE CONSCIOUS MAN HAS NO LIMITS.
