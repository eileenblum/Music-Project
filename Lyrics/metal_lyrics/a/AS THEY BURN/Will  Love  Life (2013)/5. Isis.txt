CURSED FOR THE FIRST TIME YOU ARE MY BURNING DESIRE. IN YOUR EYES I SAW THE MISSING PIECES I'VE BEEN SEARCHING FOR. BUT NOW MY HEART IS NOTHING MORE THAN A COLD ROCK. YOUR EYES ARE MADE OF FIRE AND ICE. QUEEN ILLUMINATED I WANNA FEEL YOU INSIDE ME SO NOW I CAN BE MYSELF FOR REAL I CAN BE MYSELF FOR REAL YOUR SKIN IS SWEETER THAN THE WINDS YOUR BLACK AND BEWITCHING HAIRS MADE ME GO OUT OF MY MIND. OUT OF MY MIND. YOUR BEAUTY WILL NEVER STOP HAUNTING ME I NEED YOUR FACE TO GET OUT OF MY HEAD. LET ME GO THIS POISON FILLS MY BODY. IT CONQUERS ME AND DESTROYS MY REMORSE. I WANDER INTO MY THOUGHTS. I JUST WANT TO MAKE IT STOP. LET ME GO. ISIS. YOUR EYES ARE MADE OF FIRE AND ICE. QUEEN ILLUMINATED. I WANNA FEEL YOU INSIDE ME. SO NOW I CAN BE MYSELF FOR REAL. I CAN BE MYSELF FOR REAL.
