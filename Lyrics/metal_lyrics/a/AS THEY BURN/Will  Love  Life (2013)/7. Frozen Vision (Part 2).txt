I FOUND YOU (FIND ME!) FROZEN IN THE NIGHT. YOU TOUCHED MY HEART (YOU HURT ME!) WITH ICY FINGERS (I'M SO COLD) YOU TOUCHED ME (TOUCH ME!) FOR A LIFETIME (FOR A LIFETIME). YOU FOUND ME BROKEN ON THE INSIDE (THE INSIDE), DEEP IN THE NIGHT I FOUND YOU FROZEN AND COLD. I FELT YOUR HEART BEATING, YOU COULD SEE THAT I WAS BLEEDING FROM THE INSIDE. DEEP IN A STORM WHERE THE ROADS NEED TO BE TAKEN, THERE'S NO WAY TO STOP ME FALLING, WHEN DESTINY IS CALLING YOUR NAME. MY NAME IS NOTHING, NOTHING AT ALL WITHOUT YOU HERE. WITHOUT YOU HERE!
