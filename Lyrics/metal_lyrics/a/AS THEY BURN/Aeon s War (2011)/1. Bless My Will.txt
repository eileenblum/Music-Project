Door open for a new utopia more unhealthy
Than periods when we were decimated.
A new awareness.
New goals as useless as each other.
Nobody is able to see your face in hell.
Your fingerprints are under control.
The end will be the same for all.
This is a new day,
Where your thoughts will be built on dogma,
Hopes will be more than dreams.
Your faith will become so goddamn hopeless.
I know youâre scared of your imaginary god.
Pray for your soul and fight for the new trial
Donât be afraid of the profanes
And the misfortunes of the damned queen.
You deserve this pain, did you think before you acted ?
Now you look so blind. I want the universe to rise.
This is the darkest war born from tragedy.
All my soldiers are blessed by your fears,
Beyond this suffering a new world is coming.
Our life will be (in)control.
âDo what thou wilt shall be the whole of the lawâ.
