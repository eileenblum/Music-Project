I am the natural coming from the energy,
Issued by the will of god for the new aeonâs glory.
Both we will rise for the new age of man.
We still want to explore and destroy the pillars
Of our existence.
Thatâs why I choose you, to progress
And to build a cult for all those with no conscience.
They forget the notion of time,
We must destroy this fuckin area.
Aeonâs war.
There is no providence but a destiny that concerns us all
Beyond this black veil I see the shadow of Babalonâ sword
Nothing is in control of their mind
Under the influence of madness, of fury.
Nothing is under control.
I am the natural coming from the energy
Issued by the will of god, for the new aeonâs rebirth.
