Damned here I am to stay maybe
Another day still waiting for the end.
I guess you bet with death.
Here I am.
This is a plague that you donât care
About you even lost your convictions.
Nothing will survive next, here I am coward.
This is a plague,
This is a blame for your lovers for all the earth.
And I pray for your soul and
I pray for you deep in the ashes.
It is so impure to stay right here, we need to be pure.
We need to exist, we need to be what we were.
Can this beauty change you all.
A damned nation brought to sacrifice.
God... Lies... God...
