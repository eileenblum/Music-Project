I am the dead holy guardian angel master
Of my divine nature, counselor of my will
I tasted pleasure and enjoyed it.
I enjoyed what you banned.
I enjoyed your restrictions.
Your ego, your blasphemies are so low
And my soul is so pure.
Choronzon doesnât forgive me again.
Through this hood I am born again.
City of the pyramids, I am the newly elected.
Your gates will be open for me whore of Babylon.
Exalt me.
My visions do not come from the sky.
I wanna pray straight from the ashes of hell.
Youâve gotta know my vision is not yours.
So fuck you all, I donât care about your business.
You are dust and will become dust again.
My mortal mind does not want to help you.
âOnly the gods will pervert your mind,
Only profanes will pervert your mindâ.
