Imagine a society, where nothing is ruled by your mind
Hope is a limit for the stronger.
I want the treasure the weak.
I am here to honor the sin and to extol my faith.
Blow your head for the great master.
Life is a sin full of compromise,
Life is a lust full of differences.
Life is so vicious but this is what
We are my chemical imagination is full,
My left hand holds the creation of my spirit
And all diseases I love.
I love.
