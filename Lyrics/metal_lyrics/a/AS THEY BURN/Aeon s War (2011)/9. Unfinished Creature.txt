Youthfulness satisfied by the risk.
A drug that runs through each of your veins,
A life more utopian than ever.
Follow me and have a good time.
God is not alive to punish you.
Your will is here to satisfy you.
Follow the wave, the same that guides
Your missteps since the beginning.
We are alone and misunderstood.
This world has everything to give you
And to take from you a dream so alive, nature so dead
Madness to trust in the evolution of your species.
We are alone.
