This is a state where everything is possible.
All your dreams all your nightmares are turning real
And all your fears disappear.
Confusion is everywhere.
I am the infinite which destroys reality.
I am the new idol for the nihilists.
All my visions are turning real.
Those energies become too powerful.
My mind has gone away joined my bipolar gods.
Again Iâm lost with the masterpiece of weakness and blasphemy
So you know what ?
Baby come on, baby come on, donât be shy, baby swallow.
