[feat. Junior Rodriguez]Sheâs shadowed the circle of stars
And was covered by the morning clouds.
Her feet are swifter than the winds,
Her hands are swifter than the morning dew.
Her garments are still the same.
Her dwelling is in herself.
The lions donât know where she walks,
And neither do the beasts of the fields.
She is deflowered, still a virgin.
Cast your old bitches and burn your clothes.
Abstain yourself from the company of other women
That are defiled and sluttish.
She is a virgin.
She will open her legs and stay naked before you.
Scarlet woman, Scarlet goddess.
