Once again I've woken up with you in my head,
I guess it's fine 'cause you never really left.
I'm sorry for being the way I am,
I'm just a work in progress.
A fucking work in progress.
I lose myself in the pictures of me and you,
maybe in another life...
Maybe in another light...
Maybe in another life...
I'll be what you need.
I can't bear to be a memory.
Seasons changed and so did we. [3x]
Please come back.
