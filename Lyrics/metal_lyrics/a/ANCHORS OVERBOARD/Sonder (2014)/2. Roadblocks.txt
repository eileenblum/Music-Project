I've hit a roadblock,
I'm a wreck and its all my fault.

I'm at a loss for words;
everything's coming up short.
Never had a chance to live the dream,
so many years passed where I couldn't sleep.

Let me close my eyes and drift away,
my minds a fucking mess;
I'm gonna set things straight. [2x]

I need to come to terms,
with how things needs to be.
I'll learn to hope again,
I'll find the light in me.
I'll find the point to me.

This will not define me,
I refuse to live with my eyes closed. [2x]

I won't just be a waste of space,
forever searching for better days.

I am not my mistakes,
I'll keep in mind I'm only human.
I am not my mistakes,
I'm not a failure unless I accept it.

You are not your mistakes,
keep in mind you're only human.
You are not your mistakes,
not a failure unless you accept it.

Not your mistakes. [2x]

I'll leave a mark somehow,
I'll make it work somehow.
A whisper at the start,
but a bang when I go out.

I'll leave a mark somehow,
I'll make it work somehow.
The only thing that's stopping me is my self doubt.
The only thing stopping me. [2x]
