Gone before my eyes,
but not forgotten;
you still have a friend in me.
I can't believe that you're gone now,
it all seemed to go so quickly.

Where are you now,
you were the light that never went out.
Where are you now,
are you looking down on and smiling?

Please don't go where I can't follow,
its selfish I know but come back home.
Please don't go where I cant follow,
I'll see you soon at the crossroads.
See you soon at the crossroads. [2x]

This world has taken so much away,
with no intention to give it back. [2x]

I'll be seeing you soon,
shine your light on me. [2x]

Everyone that I'll ever know
will follow the reaper home.
I'll be doomed to be six feet deep and cold.
Six feet deep and cold.
