Tried to put my finger on my problems,
it took my whole arm; still haven't solved them.
Take me overboard,
I'll walk the plank.
This life isn't meant for me.

Tried to put my finger on my problems,
it took my whole arm; I still haven't solved them.
Take me overboard,
I'll walk the plank.

This life was never meant for me.
Never meant for me.
But I'll keep on trying,
I'll get it right just watch me.
The world keeps spinning in the darkest of times.
