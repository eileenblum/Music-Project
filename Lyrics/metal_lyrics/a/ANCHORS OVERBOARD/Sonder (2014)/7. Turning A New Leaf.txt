[feat. Leland Miller of Genocide District]These hands haven't made their last mistakes,
I'll either make it or lose it all someday.
And there's nowhere to turn to,
when your thoughts have it out for you.

I can't move forward if I always step back,
I can't burn brighter if I'm scared of a match.
How can I change the outcome if I never try?

I can't bear to take another day for granted,
I know my next breath could be my last.
I'm only one man doing the best I can.
The world won't break me,
I won't fall to my knees.

I will break the world,
before the world breaks me.
Despite everything stacked against me,
I'm not giving up, I'm not giving in.

For a beginning to start,
an end must begin. [2x]

Turning a new leaf has done nothing for me,
so now I'm uprooting trees.
Turning a new leaf has done nothing for me,
all in hopes to fix me.
