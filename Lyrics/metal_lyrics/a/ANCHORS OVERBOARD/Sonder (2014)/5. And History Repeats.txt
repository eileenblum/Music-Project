All the skeletons I try to hide,
pick my brain at the worst of times.
Like rainy days when I'm tired of gray,
this buzzing never meets an end.

I swear its not just in my head.
And so I guess it's fine,
dealing with the downside.
Even though my sighs have sighed,
I'm still trying to make it right.

I can't apologize for all the times,
I didn't do what was right.
I got so caught up in smaller things
the bigger picture passed me by.

Some say my broken thoughts can't be fixed,
and they're a bit more cracked than when I last checked.

I swear its not just in my head.
And so I guess it's fine,
dealing with the downside.
Even though my sighs have sighed,
I'm still trying to make it right.

But "that's life",
"Oh that thats life".
I find myself in disbelief of all that I'm told. [2x]

I guess it's fine,
dealing with the downside.
Even though my sighs have sighed,
I'm still trying to make it right.

Like rainy days when you're tired of gray,
this buzzing never end,
It never ends.

Should I give up,
should I give in?
Am I a waste of life,
am I a waste of skin? [2x]
