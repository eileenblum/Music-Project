Out of deep space light-years from home
someday we'll see
they're not alone

They fall from a universe not made for this land
We've lost the only word they do understand
they think we're the aliens invented on Mars

In their science fiction books
they call us - the
planet with the cold and lonely heart

Sail on the river of a starry night
From the Milky Way to another day

I'm waiting out somewhere at the borderline
I don't want to stay - take me far away

They listen "Radio Earth" every night and day
This unspecific art in the words we say
They wander through the tides from a parallel world

And found with decipher codes
The thing we've lost

To send us an invasion of the love

Radio
Earth
Radio Earth

Sail on the river of a starry night
From the Milky Way to another day
I'm waiting out somewhere at the borderline
