Yesterday we built another bridge
A way to other spaces of (in) the sciences
Where all the seasons we'll try to find
The reason and the merit for the measure of the time

We found a back street of the cemetery
And felt the lie of hagiology
'cause words are not enough for
what we want to say

We have to flee
And many seas
We have to cross
To Abydos

He lives under the sea
Is the wind in the trees
He's the wisdom of the world

If it's God building our street
It's not a way you go by feet

Hyperion sunset
The end is defined
But beautiful poems
Preserving an illusion for
the one and only life in our lie

We have to flee

We have to cross
To Abydos

He lives under the sea
Is the wind in the trees
He's the wisdom of the world
On the wings of the wild
In the arms of a child
Lies the wisdom of the world

He lives under the sea
Is the wind in the trees
Find the wisdom of the world
He's the kind of a man
You describe as a friend
For the wisdom of the world
