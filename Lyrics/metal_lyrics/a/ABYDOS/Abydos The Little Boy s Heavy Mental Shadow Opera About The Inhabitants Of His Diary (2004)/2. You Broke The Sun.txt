Tell me where do you go
Is it like we think we know
Are the lights in the sky
All just alleviations to say goodbye

Tell me what do you see
Is all worth our fantasy
Can you show me your star
So I believe you find a way to tell me where you are

You broke the sun
And painted me a universe called new life
You broke the sun
am I just standing too close to see your satellite?

And I thought he could hear my words
When I told him goodbye
'Cause I saw how the world has changed
In the blink of an eye

But I don't want to know all that
But I don't want to know it all

Can you sing another song
Let me hear again your voice
Can you send another sign
Can you send it to me
You can climb up to the stars
Mr. Saint Exupery
Can you write another tale
To make him coming back to me

Sorry I have to go

Again so good to talk to you
I know there will be a time
For your pictures in the stairway don't see me cry

You broke the sun
You broke the sun
You broke the sun
You broke the sun

You broke the sun
And painted me a universe called new life
You broke the sun
Are we just standing too close to see the whole bright
