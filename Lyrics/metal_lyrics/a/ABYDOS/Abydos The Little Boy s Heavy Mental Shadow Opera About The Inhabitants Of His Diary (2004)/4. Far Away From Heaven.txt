I'm still searching, I can't define my religion
On a Sunday April the 21st I will understand that
I've waited to long.

All these little things I try to tell you in a song
In Paris we can meet for the show,
My birthday present you'll now never know.

Sometimes it's hard to explain
These words for the end of the lane.

So far away from heaven
I'm standing here so far away
you found the island to escape beside a three
Dry my tears wile you sleep.

When your brother died,
Thirty seven days ago
A fail that took a part of you,
You where so afraid then to leave him alone

In dreams you can reach for your hand
You follow the way to the end.

So far away from heaven
I'm standing here so far away
You found the island to escape beside a tree
Dry my tears...

I'm so alone in this beautiful mind
So anodyne these tears in my eyes,
Initial greatness
And the spirit is gone
Replaced by the burden
In this quite contrived version of what we call life
...but we have to carry on

So far away from heaven
I'm standing here so far away
you found the island to escape beside a tree
dry my tears, dry my tears dry my tears

So far away from heaven
I'm standing here so far away
you found the island to escape beside a tree
dry my tears while you sleep
