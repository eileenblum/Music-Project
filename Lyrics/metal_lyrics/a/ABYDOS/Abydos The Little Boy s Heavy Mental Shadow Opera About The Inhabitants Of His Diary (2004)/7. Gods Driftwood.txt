The waves are falling out of the virid sea
And paint me in the sands where no one waits for me
My destiny written from old Father Time
A long time ago between all the lines

I find the desert rose and swim in a crystal sea
I will walk through Wonderland my daddy said to me
Now I swim in a sea of tears and rose a desert heart
And if this is Wonderland it seems too cold for me

Under the rising star
Just too small for the sky above
Asking for what we are - why we're a part of the universe

If we misunderstood
That God made us drifting wood
Then how can we know before we are there

When the angel sings to wake up the light of the day
Then I can hear the world tell me where I have to stay
My destiny is written from old Father Time
A long time ago, between all the lines

And a blind man living deep inside of me
He's afraid to live and not disposed to see
He was paralyzed just by the beauty of life
To keep it in mind he just closed his eyes

Under the rising star
Just too small for the sky above
Asking for what we are - why we're a part of the universe

Under the rising star
Just too small for the sky above
Asking for what we are - why we're a part of the universe

If we misunderstood
That god made us drifting wood
Then how can we know before we are there
