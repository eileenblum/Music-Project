Like Tim Burton colours
When the eve is coming down
We live in Coppermoon a dreamy little town
Where rusty lamplights longing to replace the day
And trying to enchant the impure on our way

But demons are shining brighter
And (A) swear it's my only moon
I stare in the Visionlighter
A liquid of the sun

In our dreams they create new realities
The relations of vision and life
The other side ...other side.... other side

They say this town belongs to "Green" the Scarecrow Man
A thin illusion with no face and many hands
A skinny spider made of blood and dirt and bones
Injected with a curse inside the pavement stones

The demons are shining brighter
And swear it's my only moon
I stare at the Visionlighter
A liquid of the sun

In a dream they create new realities
The relations of vision and life
The other side ....other side...... other side

And the vision is Morro Jable
Is a portrait of Coppermoon
Now I just have to find a ladder
To climb up to the sun

In our dreams they create new realities
The relations of vision and life
And we try to amend -
These chains of evidence

And still searching for the other side
The other side.... other side..... other side
