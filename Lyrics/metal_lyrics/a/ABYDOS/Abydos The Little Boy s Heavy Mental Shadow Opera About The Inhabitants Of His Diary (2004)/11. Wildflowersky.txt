And he's a shade in the shelter of the twilight
Alone he lives inside the stone old temple plants
He stores the phials with a truth finding elixir
On his kiblah to a flower of fifth essence
Then he learned to fly

A peripheral feature creature

He's a god in the wine fields of Byzantium
He's a filter among the soulbazaar and Zion
Is reserved in a game board to evolve the PS 5
Before he gains a cutaway of butterflies

Then he learned to fly
A limited edition creature
So you wonder why
With a self-increasing feature is his mind

There's a sign in the sky
And the world open wide
And I want to know
where the wildflowers grow
....These are the days
Learning to fly
You will live forever if you try

Ha ha,
Oui pour vous mes enfants, pour vous mesdames et messieurs.
J'ai le grand honeur j'ai une grande surprise
Le triste clown

While the audience is listening to me
I will suddenly turn into a child again
All the characters allegorized
So we are free to play our cast

Even Samuel comforts your fears
'Cause you can be what you want to be inside
And now everything's coming more clear
In a story extra ordinary

Then he learned to fly
A limited edition creature
So you wonder why
With a peripheral feature in his..
m e m o r y c a r d

There's a sign in the sky
And the world open wide
And I want to know
where the wildflowers grow
....These are the days
Learning to fly
You will live forever if you try

There's a sign in the sky
Under clouds' canopy
And I want to know
where the wildflowers grow
In a garden so high
There are no more goodbyes
Find freedom again
Over wildflower skies
These are the days
Learning to fly
You can live forever if you try
