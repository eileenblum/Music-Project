Secret is our symbol
Silent our scream
And in my vision blessed by the elder gods
I am one with the spirits of earth
I am one with the spirits of air

And my soul is black,
black as my mind
But with thousand shades
I was born to reign!

Unknown is our origin
Our destination unseen
And in my vision blest by the elder gods
I am one with the spirits of fire
I am one with the spirits of water

I evoke thee spirits of earth
I evoke thee spirits of air
I evoke thee spirits of fire
I evoke thee spirits of water

Manifest thy power unto me!

An my heart is black
black as my mind
But with thousand shades
I was born to reign!
