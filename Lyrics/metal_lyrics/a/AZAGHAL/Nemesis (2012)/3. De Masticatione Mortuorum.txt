I, as Lazarus, decomposing nephilim
Risen from my tomb in blasphemy
No stone nor coin in my mouth
No graveyard dirt can prevent
My revenge from beyond the grave

Exhumed chewing cadavers
Severe their heads
Stakes driven into the earth
The pestilential venom spreads

Black Terror of the Undead
For Satan your soul and for me your flesh

Unholy desecration ritual
Necromantic rites
De Masticatione Mortuorum
The pestilential venom spreads
