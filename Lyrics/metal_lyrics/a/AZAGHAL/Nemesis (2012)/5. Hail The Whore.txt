Fields of serpents, rivers of venom
Screams of dying celestial flesh
Hail the whore, embodiment of falsehood
Behind your icons, only emptiness
Behind your masks, only hypocrisy
Hail the whore, Hail the desolation of god

Spreading the black art of blasphemy
In it's purest and filthiest form
The wolves have returned
To slaughter the shepherd and his herd

To drive angels to madness 
By the shadows in their souls
Sending them to eternal sleep of oblivion

From spirit to flesh
From flesh to ash
From ash to oblivion
Spreading the Satanic plague

Fuck the virgin on the desecrated altar of god
Proceeding to ultimate sin
I hail only death
Satan! Live through me!
