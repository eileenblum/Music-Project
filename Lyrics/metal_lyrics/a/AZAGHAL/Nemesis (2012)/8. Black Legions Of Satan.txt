Rusty nails tear open
The very flesh of life
Torturous screams
Pain beyond the grasp of mind
Jesus Christ! I despise your sickening light
Rusty nails tear open
The very flesh of life

Black legions of Satan are marching
Death's vermin are spreading the plague
Archaic fires are burning black with hate
Behold! Death, destruction and decay

Clad in black armour
Sword stained with blood
Black wings of armageddon
Spread over mankind
Piles of burning bodies
Their smoke eclipses the sun
