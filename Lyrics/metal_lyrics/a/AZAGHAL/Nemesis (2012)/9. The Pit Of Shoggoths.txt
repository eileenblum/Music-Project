The abomination of abominations
The goat with a thousand young
Black flame rises 
beyond body, beyond life

The unholy pit where the black realm begins
And the watcher guards the gate
The pit of shoggoths
Place of utter blasphemy

Down the six thousand steps
To the abyss unknown
Nameless rites in nameless places 
The black flame burns darker

The shape rose up from the altar
And there were 500 that howled
Desecration and sodomy
Perversion and blasphemy

Chanting grows louder
And the trance deepens still
Behold the arrival
Of the ancient ones

Naked bodies, wrapped in lust
Beyond pleasure, beyond pain
Behold the arrival
Of the ancient ones
