From the vast emptiness spawn
The eternal, chaos born
The origin, Satan, god of all
The destroyer, the rise and the fall

The original
The eternal
The undying
The nemesis

Without father
Without descent
Without beginning
Without end

I am the vanguished kings of Sodom and Gomorrah
I am Longinus, wielding the spear
I am the elder ones hiding beyond the stars
I am god of the godless, I bear the stigmata scars

But donât call me the adversary
For I cannot be defeated
Immortal I stand
As above, so below
