Azaghal Terror Cult

Death worship, the ultimatum
Fist of iron in the face of god
I mock everything you love
Your morals mean nothing to me

Proudly I wear
My scars of self-mutilation
Blood spilt for the master
Each cut in my flesh is a
Scar in the face of god
In the face of gods creation

Satanic - Misanthropic - Nihilistic
Azaghal Terror Cult

Black metal is the weapon of Satan
For controlling the feeble and weak
I am his herald, wielder of his sword

Black flames of hate scorching my soul
The ultimate pleasure is found in pain
The fire inside will never fade
My satanic terror will forever reign!

Satanic - Misanthropic - Nihilistic
Azaghal Terror Cult

Piss on the cross
Desecrate the altar
Blasphemy in the name of Satan
