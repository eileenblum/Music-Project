The day to day minutiae
details of tonightâs tedium
fed to us by the rave particle
glow sticks and fourier transforms
moving in unison
algorhythmic oscillations
of membranes and strings
an overseeing eye in all places at once
vision spread out among the bodies
rippling through a sea of tired souls
targets locked onto those who cannot continue
the neon paint covers the walls, floors, limbs, faces
waste of a perfectly good drink
their bodies become one with infinity
but we do not dare stop to grieve
the rave particle will always be watching
the sinister dance modulator
donât anger the rave particle
Iâm free.
