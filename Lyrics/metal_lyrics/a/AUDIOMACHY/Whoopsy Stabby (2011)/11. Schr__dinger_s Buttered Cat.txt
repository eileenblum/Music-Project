The last lyric in this song is true
I tear my mind apart
and if I put it back together right
I'll have someone else to tear my mind apart for
I am the liar I am the urge
I am the loop I am the beginning and the end
Chronal signatures linger from the inevitable place in space
Linking the present and future in so indelible a way as a
means to encase the advancement of plans to enhance once upon a time
A circular system inverted from outer elements to fold the line
Holding the light for the hole in the night that closes wide
I crossed the seven bridges
so you'd be tempted to follow
The world flipped inside out
A creaseless blue green orb
Inside and out
Alive and dead
Black and white
Yet to be observed
All and nothing
The Lightless One bares everything and nonexistence
He looks up to the sky, he has completed his task
Finally a journey of a thousand suns has come to an end
The Lightless One has enlightened all he could
to continue his existence
until the next hunger
The first lyric in this song is false.
