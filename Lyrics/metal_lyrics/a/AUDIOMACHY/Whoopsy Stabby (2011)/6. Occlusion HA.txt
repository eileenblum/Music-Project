Who is this?
Every few days I sit and wonder
Who is this?
When it happens everything stops
Who is this?
I've never seen you before
Why is this happening now?
leave me alone
when it happens just stop
I can't tell whose hands these are
How did I get in this body?
Why is it moving on its own?
Whose body is this?
Like staring at the back
of your own head
watch the automation
I'm just staring at my stare
Like a puppet
but the strings aren't visible
Puppeteer caught inside
the strings seep inward
like an exoskeletal pilot
the aircraft trapped
as malleable core
bending to the external will
Outside looking in.
