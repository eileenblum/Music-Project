Some days, the weather is so nice, you just want to take a walk
Take to your footpaths and go for a picnic
While you're out there why not mercilessly grill some unsuspecting animal
The shade cast from the trees
like a weave pattern on the ground
Take a stroll, perceive
the various floral sequences littering the beauteous courtyard square
My heliophilia radiates as the geographical mirror clones the prime star
Causing increased levels of halcyonic excitation
Engaging in such events will fulfill your vitamin d quota
A twitch
A hint
The light begins to fade
You can't expect everything so perfect to last forever
Magnified, the thunderous roar of a legion
Stampeding towards the purified light
A twitch
A hint
The light begins to fade
You can't expect everything so perfect to last forever
Oh no I think that they finally found us
The swarm is consuming the harvest
Insects relentlessly chew at the raw flesh
Unable to cease the destruction
The once peaceful elysium slaughtered by the base instinct of the hexapedal
army
Will our souls ever be complete after the war?
Will we ever reclaim all that was lost today?
Yeah, just go to the store.
