Various things were said but I don't think they'll regain consciousness
after that veritable bubble bath of mind games
Regaling in light of the events that transpired
think not of the grenade that affected our fiscal stability
those things are expensive you know
Unable to break free of the iron clad carapace dependency
I may be experiencing a seizure
Oh a free jacket why do the sleeves have locks?
Resulting in my eventual desire
to startup a interperceptually challenged arboretum clause
Forged from the charred remains of that
ludicrously oversized golden ethereal foam finger
And now ladies and gentlemen we present a breakdown with the wrong instrument
Ahh, it followed me home
the black and white dentigerous wooden frame
Haunts my discordant disarray
with its hidden organized melodic string accumulation
Aww, youâre such a di -.. .. -.-. -.-
The lobotomy had better come quickly
I canât stand the sight of needy eyes
I need to hide the mind intestine
Seriously it looks like an organised intestine
Iâve seen how they look at me
Jealous of protection against the mindreading thieves
Be wary of any lurking genies
and various other precious common thoughts.
