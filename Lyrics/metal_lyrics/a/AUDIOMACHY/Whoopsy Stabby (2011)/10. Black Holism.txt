Black.
He walks but no-one sees him.
He is all, he is nothing.
The lightless one shall soon be present.
Excaecat ut videamus. (he blinds so that we may see)
He has come.
You sense his lifeless aura.
The sensation you experience is the osmosis affecting your physical form.
Deconstructing you atom by atom by atom.
Unwillingly joining his cause.
Yet the exempt few,
rejoice the union.
No-one sees because the light has been stolen from the world.
Compressing the lives closest to him compressing to a singularity.
The lightless one has granted true believers the chance to see.
