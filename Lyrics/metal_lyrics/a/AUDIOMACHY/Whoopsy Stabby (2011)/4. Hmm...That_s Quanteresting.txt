Aim:
To analyze second hand data
to see if boyleâs law and charles' law hold true for hydrogen and carbon
dioxide under certain conditions
therefore we are looking to see if the pressure and volume of these gasses is
inversely
proportional at a fixed temperature and if the mass of these
gasses increases and decreases by the same amount as its temperature on the
kelvin scale
the mathematical relationship for boyleâs law is p1 v1 = p2 v2
the mathematical relationship for charlesâ law is v1 / t1 = v2 / t2
the pressure of hydrogen gas does increase proportionally with volume therefore
following boyleâs law
the volume of hydrogen increased proportionally with temperature therefore
following charlesâ law
the gas laws apply better to hydrogen
i suggest this because the results for hydrogen increased
in a more regular manner than those of carbon dioxide.
