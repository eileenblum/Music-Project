The flesh has been prepared,
aware of the horrific
punishment for its existence.
To receive ingestive union.
Soon to assimilate
into the murderer.
Soon to assimilate
into the murderer.
Deprivation. Incineration. Polychotomy. Mastication.
The particles separate
unable to defend against
the uniform identical teeth
dissected for sustenance.
Swimming in blood.
The desiccated flesh
begins to disintegrate,
accepting the symbiosis.
The onslaught continues as another round begins.
The flesh enters the murderer's mouth, crushed and torn apart.
Carelessly removing the victim from existence.
No remorse as the next piece is aligned for obliteration.
The particles separate,
unable to defend against
the uniform identical teeth.
Dissected for sustenance.
The flesh has been prepared,
aware of the horrific
punishment for its existence.
To receive ingestive union.
Soon to assimilate
into the murderer.
Soon to assimilate
into the murderer.
