In the silence I hear the prayer
of the children in my mind
I've tried for centuries
to guard you from darkness
My voices were lost in the night

There was the place I believed
Now I see the result
The nightmare's becoming too real
A dream disappears...

This is a time of reflection
I feel the tears of Mother Nature
Once there was love
Once there was light
Now all I can see is that the sorrow's here

For many years the sun is rising
For many days the sun is shining
Centuries were lost
But we'll heal with love
The whispers and pain of Mother Nature

I'm flying so high
with the birds in the sky
I feel that the end is so near
I see the mankind
They don't hear my cry
My tears are being lost in this rain

There was the place I believed
Now I see the result
All innocence turns into fear
The childhood is gone

This is a time of reflection
I feel the tears of Mother Nature
Once there was love
Once there was light
Now all I can see is that the sorrow's here

For many years the sun is rising
For many days the sun is shining
Centuries were lost
But we'll heal with love
The whispers and pain of Mother Nature.
