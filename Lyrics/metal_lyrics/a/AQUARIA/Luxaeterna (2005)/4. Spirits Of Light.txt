I look to the sky, so bright!
Mountains and hills are being touched by the morning light
The season of cold is gone
Now feel the warmth
Sent by the heart of the sun

The trees are the source of life
Risen so high, the defenders of our kind
The empire has begun
Guardians of home gather the fortress of dawn

Someday I'll be waiting for
The perfect creation that Gaia has told
That will end the cycle with its birth

I'm here to protect and guard
The throne of the queen that will rise in the stars
The heaven is not so far as you see

The spirits of light arise
To fly in the sky so high
I believe in creation now
Till eternity I'll defend the life

The spirits of light arise
To fly in the sky so high
I believe in creation now
'Till eternity I'll defend the life

The spirits of light arise
To fly in the sky so high
I believe in creation now
For the glory I'll keep the flame
May her guidance and love remain
May her choice be the wisest
For the reign.
