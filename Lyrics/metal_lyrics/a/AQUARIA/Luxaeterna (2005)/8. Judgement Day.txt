And now the court is here
to judge this case
-The future of our lives depends on this-
Blood shed to glorify all this revenge
-The fragile fate remains in battlefield-

No, I have my appeal
None of this is real
Hear my defense - Right now!

You broke the code of life and harmony
Your sacred heart is not pure anymore
The law of universe writes destiny
Now you have no more time to fear me, so...

No, I have my appeal
None of this is real
Hear my defense
Before my sentence

My serenity thought mankind was free
Maybe I failed this time
And goodness still beats my heart

A child in my womb
Guardian of innocence
Harmless, Naive
A seed of beauty rising from the storm

I'll go as far as you go
The light is back, I'm free again
Allies gave back my soul
The future now is safe again
Spirits of light have defeated The rottenning of life
Humans and nature can now
Walk together in light
The battle is over And the sky lives no more into darkness
Now it's the time to defend and protect the success
Away I'll go
Away I'll be free again
This time you'll have my goal
Unite, it's in your own hands

Oh, I had my appeal
Look, oh it's so real
Hear my sentence
You're my holy friend

Destiny was sealed
Look, oh it's so real
I believed in fate
And goodness still beats my heart

Someday We'll fly
Through sea And sky
Now I'll go, I will leave you
But if you need, I'll come.
