Between the shadows of the dark
Far away a morning star
Is rising with the light

Cities now won't be the same
There's no reason for the pain
Please evolute your mind

The story is like a miracle
The love is back again
To unite the men and bring serenity

Son of the Sky
We are brothers of the earth
warriors of light are here
We'll spread our wings and touch the sky

There is a lesson for each day
Only fools can't see the way
And they fall from side to side

A new era came to stay
And the old will fade away
Now the young at heart will rise

The story is like a miracle
The wisdom is back again
To unite the man and bring serenity

Son of the Sky
We are brothers of the earth
warriors of light are here
We'll spread our wings and touch the sky

And I hear the wind
Whispers of our souls
Together will find our way back home

The story is like a miracle
The love is back again
We'll live tomorrow with peace and harmony

Alone you'll never reach the sky
The union makes the power
I'll be there to help you when you need me

Son of the Sky
We are brothers of the earth
warriors of light are here
We'll spread our wings and touch the sky

Son of the Sky
We are brothers of the earth
warriors of light are here
We'll spread our wings fly
Spread our wings and touch the sky.
