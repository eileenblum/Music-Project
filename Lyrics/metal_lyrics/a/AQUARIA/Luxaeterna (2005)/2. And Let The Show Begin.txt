A big flame crossed the sky
Creation's now divine
The astral's law's conducting
A dance of stars

The sunrise came to stay
Command and build our place
We're sons of light and justice
Our dream will start

"All the beginning was a chaos"
-A poetry said-
The golden tale became real
-Now it's clear-
The time is coming for the end to disappear
The planet's ready to begin

In this show I really pray
-for the force of love and might-
The sun is rising to the eternity
In this show will keep the flame
-From the heart of the sun and light-
A new star rise to shine us all
And Let The Show Begin

My son raise your voice
Spread the seeds through the land
-Now it's time for the land to shine
With the star of an eternal light-
"All the beginning was a chaos"
-A poetry said-
The golden tale became real
-Now it's clear-
The time is coming for the end to disappear

In this show will keep the flame
-from the heart of the sun and light-
The curtain falls and we'll create the show of a new world

Angels arrived from the sky
To spread the seeds through all the night
To seed the hope and bring the light
To burn the heart of sun and shine
The land's divine tonight
With the luxaeterna (in the luxaeterna)
Our heart is burning bright
With the luxaeterna (in the luxaeterna)
And now here comes the life
With the luxaeterna.
