In this show we came to stay
In a world of fantasy
And gather stars to shine for the glory
In this show we light the way
Peace will reign eternally

'Till the last sunrise of our time
And the rise of the sea

From now on no more falls
No sadness, no more walls
Into my heart I see
Together we'll rise in one dream

Wings of love
Now fly through seven seas
To rise a new life of liberty
Wings of love
Fulfill our destiny
Forever this time
Forever this time
We're free.
