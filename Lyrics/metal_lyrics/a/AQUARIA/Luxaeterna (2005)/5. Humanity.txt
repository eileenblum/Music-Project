In a morning a thunder light
Shock the land, I heard a cry
Is there anybody
Lost in this woods?

Did I hear this cry at night?
-Save our souls-
I was astonished by its bright
-Save our souls-
New creation born by
Mother Light

How could be this child alive?
-Save our souls-
Will the planet's balance die?
-Save our souls-
It is not so perfect
Hear now my

Warnings and visions
My forecasts and reasons
You profaned my kingdom
Went against my principles

Don't despair I'll be your guide
-Save our souls-
Your defender your allied
-Save our souls-
I will always be there
Where sunlight shines

In the world's life
Rise a new kind
Nature is crying with the bless of Mother's love
-Now it's time to hold or hands-
Harmless, feeble
Soul of eagle
Mankind is born to be the keeper of the earth

It's humanity, born to be free
With sacred paths unknown

In the world's life
Rise a new kind
Nature is crying with the bless of Mother's love
-Now it's time to hold or hands-
Harmless, feeble
-Love our friends-
Soul of eagle
-All as one-
Mankind is born to be the keeper of the earth
-We'll go on-
