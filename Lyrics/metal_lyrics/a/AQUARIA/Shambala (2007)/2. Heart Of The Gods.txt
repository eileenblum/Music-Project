All hands on deck
Sails up! Move!
Now we'll fly by night
Luck keeps the wind blowing

Moving fast now
Bless the windfall
Reach the starlight

Hero's days
Danger's on the way
Quest of fate
Made by gold and flame

WE ARE CROSSING THE HEART OF THE GODS
NOW WE CAN SEE THE LIGHT OF THE SUN
TO THE LAND OF THE FORTUNE OUR SHIPS WILL GO
WE'LL BE KINGS IN THIS NEW WORLD

Beware the storm that rises soon will turn the tide
But we are brave enough to fight and stay alive

In my dreams I can see my end is near

My ship will beat the rain and the currents of the night
I've sailed the seven seas and now's my time to rise

Hero's days
Danger's on the way
Quest of fate
Made by gold and flame

WE ARE CROSSING THE HEART OF THE GODS
NOW WE CAN SEE THE LIGHT OF THE SUN
TO THE LAND OF THE FORTUNE OUR SHIPS WILL GO
WE'LL BE KINGS IN THIS NEW WORLD
