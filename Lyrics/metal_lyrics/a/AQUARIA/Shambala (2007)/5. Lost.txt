[John]
Memories hold the distance of my heart
To the ocean I reveal my life
In a bottle all my story goes by
To reach the sky
You gave me the keys to heaven's door
But I had to run away to find my paradise
I can't go back to you this time
But you were the only one I gave my heart to

[Captain]
"Find the way out to the light
We lost horizon's sight
There's a mystery behind
The darkness of the night"
"Look! There's light somewhere inside
I hope it is our guide
Move! We're running out of time
We have to stay alive"

[John]
I LOST MY WAY BUT FOUND MY TRUTH
NOW MY HEART BELONGS TO THESE LANDS
- TO THE LAND I CALL HOME -
I HAD IT ALL BUT NEVER COULD SEE THE LIGHT
BUT NOW I TRANSCEND

[Curupira]
"I'm the beast that rules the night
The devil in disguise
You can't run away or hide
I never lose my sight"
"Leave your weapons in my arms
And you shall stay alive
If you try to take my life
I'll burn you with my eyes"

[John]
I LOST MY WAY BUT FOUND MY TRUTH
NOW MY HEART BELONGS TO THESE LANDS
- TO THE LAND I CALL HOME -
I HAD IT ALL BUT NEVER COULD SEE THE LIGHT
BUT NOW I TRANSCEND

[Speech - Curupira]

[John]
Memories hold the distance of my heart
Through the ocean I have changed my life
In the forest all my life goes by
Alone I cry

I LOST MY WAY BUT FOUND MY TRUTH
NOW MY HEART BELONGS TO THE LANDS
TO THE LAND I CALL HOME
You gave me the reason I looked for
You gave me the chance to find the way to paradise
I know that I owe you a promise to fulfill
In the river I will give you my soul
