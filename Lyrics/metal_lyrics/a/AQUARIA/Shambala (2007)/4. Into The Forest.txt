[John]
I crossed the borders of the night
Where the sun can never shine
Now, I am leaving all behind
There's no turning back this time

They dance around the fire
They come in my dreams
I hear them cry

I saw the mistress of the night
It's a fairy in disguise
She has the aura of moonlight
And her beauty makes me cry

They sing around the fire
And they dance with the wind
They come in my dreams
I see them die

I see these creatures passing by
Never saw them in my life
I lost my trail by the time
And my group left me behind

We dance around the fire
And we sing at the wind
The ritual begins
Our souls unite tonight

IN THE LAND WE RISE, IN THE LAND WE SHINE
THE OLD SPIRITS GUIDE US INTO THE FOREST
FOR THE LAND WE FIGHT, FOR THE LAND WE DIE
WE'RE THE ANCIENT CRY INTO THE FOREST

My dreams told this story a long ago
My dreams told that I am gonna die soon
I live what no one could ever live
I see what no one could ever see

Crossing rivers
Running deep in these woods
Away from my sins
I look for answers
I look for my fairy tonight
Is she just a dream?

Her trail of light
Guides me though darkness at night
I can hear her voice
I still don't know
If she is my salvation or doom
Do I have a choice?

Alone, I am alone
Away from my past
Please just love me tonight
I need to find a reason to my life

I crossed the borders of the night
Where the sun can never shine
I left my memories behind
There's no turning back this time

She's my mistress in the night
She's a fairy in disguise
She has the aura of moonlight
I will love her, my whole life
My whole life!

IN THE LAND WE RISE, IN THE LAND WE SHINE
THE OLD SPIRITS GUIDE US INTO THE FOREST
FOR THE LAND WE FIGHT, FOR THE LAND WE DIE
WE'RE THE ANCIENT CRY INTO THE FOREST
