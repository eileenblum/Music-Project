Now comes the expedition
They'll find mysteries no one else knows
Now whatever that shines in the woods
Will be taken by empire rules

-Para Nara NauÃª Pa Ra Na-
Oh, we live to protect our home
-Para Nara NauÃª Pa Ra Na-
Oh, the balance fulfill our souls
-Para Nara NauÃª Pa Ra Na-
Oh, we were the first in these sacred lands
-Para Nara NauÃª Pa Ra Na-
Oh, we won't let them take our gold

OH I KNOW THE PARADISE
I WILL LEAVE MY GOLD TO LIVE IN THESE LANDS FOREVER
AND NOW MY DARK SOUL CAN SHINE
I CAN LOOK THE SKY AND CRY: "NOW I'M FREE!"

[Solo]

OH I KNOW THE PARADISE
I WILL LEAVE MY GOLD TO LIVE IN THESE LANDS FOREVER
AND NOW MY DARK SOUL CAN SHINE
I CAN LOOK THE SKY AND CRY: "NOW I'M FREE!"
