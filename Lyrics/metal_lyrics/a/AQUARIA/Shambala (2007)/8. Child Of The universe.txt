(...The resurrection...)

[Tribe Old Shaman]
Now open your eyes, breathe the air tonight
In the river you were reborn, a miracle of life
In the secret place, you crossed the doors of light
Guided by the stars in the night, you found the way back
Mother Moon and Father Sea
Purified you, set your spirit free
You found the reason for your dreams
But the missions hides within

[Bird Indian John]
Long ago, my heart was petrified
Now I can hear it pulse beating so fast!
Born again I am a child of light
I'm leaping with the wind like a feather fall

[Tribe Old Shaman]
Close your eyes and hear the nature whisper in your ears
It says: "You were blessed by the miracle of life!"
Now more lies, no more disguise, no secrets with your life
From now on you're in paradise, now you are a
CHILD OF THE UNIVERSE
FREE TO LIVE, LIVE TO FREE
CHILD OF THE UNIVERSE
TOUCHED BY THE HEART OF SUNRISE, YOU'RE A FLAME IN THE NIGHT
BORN TO GUIDE US IN LIGHT, YOU'RE THE STAR IN OUR WAY HEARTH

CHILD OF THE UNIVERSE [3X]
FREE TO LIVE, LIVE TO FREE
CHILD OF THE UNIVERSE
UNITE THE SKY WITH THE SEA
CHILD OF THE UNIVERSE [3X]
TOUCHED BY THE HEART OF SUNRISE, YOU'RE A FLAME IN THE NIGHT
BORN TO GUIDE US IN LIGHT, YOU'RE THE STAR IN OUR WAY
YOU'RE THE STAR IN OUR WAY IN THE NIGHT

YOU'RE THE NEW IN THE OLD, FREE OUR MIND, GIVE US LOVE

[Indian Tribe]
Don't be afraid, you still have time

Turn the last page, live without fear
We are together as one... in Hearth
