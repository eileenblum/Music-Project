[John]
The nature calls, I hear the sound of cries
The river flows, my journey ends tonight
My lady waits for me to close my eyes
I'm on my way, it's time to say goodbye

[Storyteller]
Walking through the forest in the night
She's the dancer, daughter of moonlight
Long black hair, the lady dressed in white
On the riverside she cries

[John]
TAKE MY HAND SHOW ME WHERE THE RIVER ENDS
I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES AND SEE WHAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN
HOLD ME NOW AND LOVE ME 'TILL THE END OF DAWN
I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES AND FEEL I'M LIVING IN A DREAM IARA...

[John]
In the water I wash away my sins
Pay for my past, my chance to break free
Now I see the doors of paradise
On the riverside I cry
TAKE MY HAND SHOW ME WHERE THE RIVER ENDS
I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES AND SEE WHAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN
HOLD ME NOW AND LOVE ME 'TILL THE END OF DAWN
I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES AND FEEL I'M LIVING IN A DREAM
The nature calls me, I hear the echo of cries
The river takes me, my spirit rises tonight
TAKE MY HAND SHOW ME WHERE THE RIVER ENDS
I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES AND SEE WHAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN
HOLD ME NOW AND LOVE ME 'TILL THE END OF DAWN
I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES AND FEEL I'M LIVING IN A DREAM
TAKE MY HAND SHOW ME WHERE THE RIVER ENDS
I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES AND SEE WHAT I HAVE NEVER SEEN
