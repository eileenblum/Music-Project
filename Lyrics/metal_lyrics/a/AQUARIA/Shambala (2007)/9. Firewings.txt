[Bird Indian John]
In the deep of the river
I was given a chance
To remain in the darkness
Or to see the light, find what I've lost
In the deep of the river
I was given a chance
To see my love again
She's the one that made me what I am
The nature calls, I have to go - It's time
I WILL FLY THROUGH THE SKY
REACH THE HIGHEST STAR BEYOND MOONLIGHT
NOW I RISE FROM THE ASHES
SHADOW TO LIGHT
LIKE A ROSE I HAVE DIED
AND THE WATER GAVE ME A NEW LIFE
NOW I SHINE WITH THE SUNLIGHT
SHADOW TO LIGHT
Once I had stones in my way
Couldn't face them ahead
I ran away from my burden
But you can't run away from your past
The nature calls, I have to go - It's time
I WILL FLY THROUGH THE SKY
REACH THE HIGHEST STAR BEYOND MOONLIGHT
NOW I RISE FROM THE ASHES
SHADOW TO LIGHT
LIKE A ROSE I HAVE DIED
AND THE WATER GAVE ME A NEW LIFE
NOW I SHINE WITH THE SUNLIGHT
SHADOW TO LIGHT
Oh, I've waited for you for so long
I was so afraid that I couldn't hear my own voice
This time I don't live my life in fear
I could see my way through the pain of my rebirth
I WILL FLY THROUGH THE SKY
REACH THE HIGHEST STAR BEYOND MOONLIGHT
NOW I RISE FROM THE ASHES
SHADOW TO LIGHT
LIKE A ROSE I HAVE DIED
AND THE WATER GAVE ME A NEW LIFE
NOW I SHINE WITH THE SUNLIGHT
SHADOW TO LIGHT
Like firewings rising from the stars
From the stars, from the stars, rise through the sky
