Terra, fogo na Ã¡gua renascerÃ¡
Vento sopra a luz da nova vida

(...after human death...)
Long ago
I was light in darkness
Long ago
I could see before your eyes
Long ago
I was sound in silence
Long ago
I could hear before your mind
In the end no one will die
From the ashes we will rise
SHAMBALA, I WILL HOLD THE KEY
I WILL GUIDE THE SACRED PATH OF MANKIND
SHAMBALA, GIVE YOUR POWER TO ME
I WILL FIGHT UNTIL THE LAST ONE ARISE
I AM SHAMBALA
SHAMBALA, I WILL HOLD THE KEY
I WILL GUIDE THE SACRED PATH OF MANKIND
SHAMBALA, GIVE YOUR POWER TO ME
I WILL FIGHT UNTIL THE LAST ONE ARISE
I AM SHAMBALA

I AM SHAMBALA...

Terra, fogo na Ã¡gua renascerÃ¡
Vento sopra a luz da nova vida
