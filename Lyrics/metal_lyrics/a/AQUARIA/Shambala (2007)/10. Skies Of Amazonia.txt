[Captain]
"We have to get in this village,
It's said that they have what we need
Take the gold! Kill the tribe! No mercy!
There is a leader, they say
It's a birdman no army can capture or kill
Beware! No mercy!

[Bird Indian John]
"I will defend my new mother land day and night
You shall never fear
Once in my life I was one of them
But today, my future is here"

[Frightened Pirate]
"During this journey we've seen
What no one would believe
We have lost half of the crew! It's real!
Fate was decided much sooner
Than our decisions we should stop
Now and leave! It's real!"

[Bird Indian Tribe]
"You gave me a chance; I can see the sunlight again
Now I comprehend
My time has come, a mission I have to fulfill
To protect these lands"

[Indian Tribe]
"Run away, the strangers came to take
The fortunes of our tribe
No mercy in their eyes! No mercy!
Run away, there's no chance to survive
We have to save our lives
Into the woods we hide! No mercy!"

[Bird Indian John]
Don't be afraid, they won't change
The course of our home, no!
FLY, FLYING HIGH

FOREVER SHINE
I AM FINALLY FREE
FLY, FLYING HIGH
I BELIEVE THE SKIES OF AMAZONIA
CAN CHANGE MY LIFE
ONCE I WAS ONE OF THEM, NOW I'M FREE
FLY, FLYING HIGH
I CAN TOUCH THE SKIES OF AMAZONIA
FOREVER SHINE
I AM FINALLY FREE
FLY, FLYING HIGH
I BELIEVE THE SKIES OF AMAZONIA
CAN CHANGE MY LIFE
ONCE I WAS ONE OF THEM, NOW I'M FREE
