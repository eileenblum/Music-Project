[Bird Indian John]
Once upon a time
When I traveled to this land
No money in my pocket
No weapon in my hand
A new land full of secrets
Where once I feared to cross
I don't hide anymore
I found what I have lost
The seagulls in the sky
The music of the sea
They blend a mystic chant
To reach infinity
The rain fall in the woods
I stare at mother moon
My soul will meet you soon
Forever in deep blue
Into that black old ship I wondered: "Who am I?"
I realized, now I could find my mother land, I had my chance
So many miles away I crossed to find myself
But still I don't know why I was given a chance
I found my way back home when Iara took my life
The reason I won't find
In my dreams, I couldn't see
My way to light, my heart was blind
All my life was do or die
But I could learn that time washes away your past
So many miles away I crossed to lose my pride
I gave my life away and found my paradise
Sometimes you need to trust in destiny to rise
And reasons you will never find
In my dreams I couldn't see
My way to light, my heart was blind
I don't know what future holds
But I can wait for my time
You have been blessed by the miracle of nature
LIBERTY - SET ME FREE
IN THE RIVER I'M GOING TO DARKNESS
TO FIND MY WAY TO THE LIGHT
DON'T REGRET - FLAWS OF PAST
TAKE THE CHANCE TO RESTART
AND BE TRUE TO YOUR HEART
AND AGAIN YOU'LL HAVE... LIBERTY
All I have lived it seems to be only a dream
And now I found a reason to believe
Once I had my doubts, but I let my river flow
In my heart I believed - Now it's real!
I had my secrets but I couldn't save myself
Love is the key to find what you have lost in your life
You have been blessed by the miracle of nature

LIBERTY - SET ME FREE
IN THE RIVER I'M GOING TO DARKNESS
TO FIND MY WAY TO THE LIGHT
DON'T REGRET - FLAWS OF PAST
TAKE THE CHANCE TO RESTART
AND BE TRUE TO YOUR HEART
AND AGAIN YOU'LL HAVE...

LIBERTY - SET ME FREE
IN THE RIVER I'M GOING TO DARKNESS
TO FIND MY WAY TO THE LIGHT
DON'T REGRET - FLAWS OF PAST
TAKE THE CHANCE TO RESTART
AND BE TRUE TO YOUR HEART
AND AGAIN YOU'LL HAVE... LIBERTY
Liberty - Set me free
To my paradise I go
Liberty - Set me free
I will meet you now my love - I'm with you
