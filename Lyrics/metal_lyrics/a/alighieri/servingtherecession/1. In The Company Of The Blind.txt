Tonight
as the stars shine
To frown upon me
I have been left to be condemned
At
passions hand

Intoxicated down to the last shred
Of self control
I have
seen your face through a 
A poisoned mask of debauchery

Have I lost my
vision?

Iâve sold myself to this vile obsession
In succumbing to these
inner demons

How tragic, yet so beautiful it is
With a mind and body
harmonized
Achieving through one maniacal movement 
The grace of a god
But
no sooner than the plight of man
The warning lights have begun to bear the
flame

And with a snake of June writhing
Through my veins
There is nothing
left for me to love

For love it dies around 
The serpents bite
When my
mind is forged to this violent motion
All actions are wrapped so tightly
Into
a devilâs angst that my iron will is transparent

There is nothing left to
respect
I am past the point of regret
(For this passion has blinded
me)
There is nothing left to respect
I am past the point of regret
(For
blind passion has guided me)
