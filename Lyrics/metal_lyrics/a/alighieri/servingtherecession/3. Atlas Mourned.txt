Beyond the wreckage//where a century of hope is found//one man is left underneath//the weight of a fallen empire//to rot with the seeds of lust//could the sun rise and shed some light?//the sun wonât rise (âoh, shed some light!â)//to mend those wounds formed by the darkness//of a nations loathsome hands that had//held him down under a city of sin//when the foundation crumbled and the light caved in//even the greatest skyline did collapse//in the presence of a dream//that dream called hope//yet somewhere beyond the wreckage//there once died a man//amongst the remnants of his//failures//the horror rebuilds over these salvaged lands//and it industrialized fear//the horror rebuilds over to start again//to start again//the nation that portrayed hope//as a perishable resource//is lost within itself.
