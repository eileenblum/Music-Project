There you were so relaxed in an offering gown
It was over when I caught your scent
Like heroine you exploded all through my senses
I began to notice right when I met
Your eyes that I'm somehow pressed to lay claim
In the swelling of your neck
I was hellishly set to weave my way in
With my hands aiming for your throat
I took hold with intentions to invade
Arms wrapped around at the outskirts of your waist
We'd been linked by something so perverse, so profound
Don't worry this is all not a dream
You'll wake up very soon
To wish that you were still asleep
(You'll wake up very soon)
There you are so relaxed in an offering pose
It was over when I won your trust
Like heroine I explore much more than your senses
Euphoria then blurs into despair
Like the calm of water, tainted by an inks intrusion
All is stillâ¦
Pray for this body, It's prey for the animals we've become
Present in this motion; writhing emotionless energy
We've been linked by something so perverse, so profound
Don't worry this is all not a dream
You'll wish that you were still asleep
Like the calm of water, tainted by an inks intrusion
All was stillâ¦then I took control!
You didn't cry, you didn't beg, it never seemed to the world you were suffering.
No you didn't cry, you didn't beg NO! It never seemed to the world you were suffering
LET IT GO!
I've never dreamt that life could have so much pleasure, but in a moments time you will open your eyes to a whole new world of pain.
