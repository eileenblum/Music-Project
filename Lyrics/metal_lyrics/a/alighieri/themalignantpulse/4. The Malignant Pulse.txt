"He's been very patient
And would love to attack her,
But there ain't a chance that he would,
Allow her to suffer
Not a single moment's discomfort!
By the might of a bludgeon
Or the sweep of a blade, for another single weapon
Can be used to a great effect,
Something much more personal
(An item with a pulse).
"Oh baby please
Don't fall victim to hope,
For he is a cowardâ¦
...But I am no coward...
And I can not be
Be forced to suppress, each thought that can only be so vile,
So dark, so grim and also beautiful!â
Not within himself, he can only find comfort in the form of another
To find fulfillment
He preaches this:
âPure suffering is realâ
There is not a chance anything will defer the event at hand
A lifelong, suffering wait has bred this
The heavens above cannot foresee what it is that he
Intends to do, itâs his night and He...is king...
Of. This. Hell.
