"Oh, what pretty light that you have there
What wonderful shine
If I could just bathe in you for awhile
I might feel alive"
(Now just for a moment there
He thought that he had sensed
A hint of that old tingle in the back of the throat)
âThis moment I stare in pure amazement
A beautiful jewel that I wish
To smash to pieces
(I'll tell her just how I feel!)"
And his voice does creep upon her
Like a whisper on the side of the neck
"I am not just a ghost; I am a slave to lust"
These words will make her tremble
(That voice of the dead!)
This heavenly pleasure damns him to an earthen hell!
And his voice pains deep within her
Like a sharp edge through the skins surface
"I am not just a ghost; I am a slave to lust!"
These words will make her tremble
(That voice of the dead!)
âThat voice of glass! Those thighs of iron! That skin of gold!â
In the company of the blind, the deaf will tear her light apart
"I am not just a ghost; I am a slave to lust!â
These words will make her tremble
(That voice of the dead!)
"I am not just a ghost; I am a SLAVE TO LUST!â
I am a slave to lust
