This is the one kiss that you've been waiting for!
Oh dear the anticipation, Oh god the intimidation!
Now what if, this is it?
Now what if, feels like it!
What is it now?
Now as you start, the blood rushes the eyes now bulge
The pulse amok, the tear ducts work, do tell...
What did you do (right there just now) with your hands?
Do you really think that that touch was good enough?
You rock back, back back and forth, how violent this sort of is!
As you progress, the blood rushes, the eyes are bulged
The pulse amok, the tear ducts drained do tellâ¦
What did you do (right there just now) with your hands?
Did you really think that that touch was good enough?
You rock back, back, back and forth, how violent this sort of is!
Obscured emotion on your face,
You are stuck to an appetite for pleasing
What thoughtful insecurity!
You are doing just fine, as you perspire!
The sweat is sweet! The sweat is rain on your windshield, watch it slowly bead and fall off! And there it comes, approaching NOW!!
Your love as a cinder block comes crashing through!
THE GLASS IT BREAKS IT HITS YOUR CHEST!
THE RAIN POURS IN AND YOU ARE WET!
YOU ARE WET!
