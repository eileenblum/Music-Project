Sprawled across the sign//like limbs deadened and decayed//were letters that spelled the harsh reality//of what my future held//just beyond those lead lined doors//its been days since the elders cast me out//theyâd said I had forgotten//what it was to feel//all alone am banished// to the black house where the light of that day//repeats//that day when I saw a man clutching on to his son//with a look of confusion//scribed across his face//he had explained to me//(with such conviction)//the fraudulence of my work//and disguised his fears//with a sharpened tongue (then I quickly took//control of THAT situation)//there standing at the top of the stairs was//the architect that brought death//to the oncoming herd//to the oncoming herd//I never heard the warning//that was never//meant to be heard//ill fate was wished upon he who had power to draw the world//but exhaustion plagues the strength of this fallen angels hands//my intentions were never to appease the gods!//I solely wished to make a//a mockery of what they protect//now all alone in my//my dark corner of the world//I fly towards the light of that day
