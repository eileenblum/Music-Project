It was quite magnificent//through the exchange of blood torrents//was painted an array of floor tiles//and with a disregard for symmetry//the lines blurred//to a dull representation//of functionality and control//I was bound to a dim fate//what an unfortunate occasion//when one could become victim//to the dusk of his//of his understanding//there was a reason for the imperfections at hand//standing in the mirror enfrente de mi horror//and it bore the basis for this concept of parallels//then with the utmost//precision nailed me to an idea//betrayal underneath the skin//underneath the skin//a betrayal!//now inside this reflection lies what a//tormented man is made of//how absurd//to believe that what gives life//could be poison//then there was one line to destroy the outcome of this//y despues era una linea mala no hay parallels!//yet in spite of this confusion//I see life escape me//at the cessation of parallels I feel my pulse retreat//but these line are NOT parallel//and they never will be!//now through an ever present manipulation lies a newly found truth//I was bound to a grim fate//and was coalesced by deceptionâs calloused hands Iâve been crucified by internal war and left to die alone//left to die alone//and with a disregard for symmetry//the lines blurred//to a dull representation//of functionality and control//I was bound to this fate//what an unfortunate occasion//when one could become victim//to the dusk of his//of his understanding//in this moment//of my demise//my heart collapses//in this final breath//my eternity//forever free!//from these calloused hands//forever free!//I do believe//I am saved//from eternity//forever free!
