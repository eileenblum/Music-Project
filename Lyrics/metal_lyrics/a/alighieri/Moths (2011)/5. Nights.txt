Night! that wretched event//where heaven earth and hell will//harmonize//on this current setting I find myself lying in my vast//my vast sanctuary of self reflection//(my anger is a house)//I will bed with destruction//and in that romanticism//will be born//a rather interesting proposition//and when I sing my son to sleep//I'll plant my nightmares into his head//my horrible visions complete//I cannot wait for those nights!//I now bed with destruction//and in this romanticism//is nowÂ born a rather interesting specimen//Night! This wretched event//where heaven earth and hell collide//my wonderful plan to//plant the seeds//of my resentment //takes shape//I only live to savour the pain of existence//so I can wade in its shallow pool//my wonderful plan!//I am a deceiver//you were a fool//I do represent//all that I hate in this life//I am a deceiver//not just a fool//this (child) will represent//all that I hate in this life//your sole purpose was to be a shell//for when my dark present to the world is conceived I will often//look back and smile//oh it was I!// with mal intentions at night!
