Iâm asleep assuming the role of victim//I feel something//Iâm awake assuming the role of a stranger//something cold surrounds (me)//all through the dark//I open my eyes to a//contorted pale frame//her eyes staring out to//nowhere at all//she moves so gracefully in spite of me//dancing unlawfully transparent and white//belligerent I respond to a distorted sense of volume//with ears hearing nothing//I start to fear my own fate//before I even begin//belligerent I remove the covers//to reveal a//much darker incarnation of fear//and I fear my own fate//will mirror that of this wretch!//I pretend there was life//at the//bedside I will believe//I believe in this life//I can see I am graced by//graced by the in-disposable presence of death at my place of rest//the apparition, transparent and white.
