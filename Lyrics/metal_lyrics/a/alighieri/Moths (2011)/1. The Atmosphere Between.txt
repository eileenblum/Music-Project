As the sands of time blend with//that of this dead manâs valley//the hallucinationâs puddle deepens//while I draw closer//to the center of madness//what is this//what is this torture?//In a secluded raving for peace//I am now one with the deadened//aspirations of youth//what form of torture//has been bestowed upon me?//when the very surface of which I wish//to be devoured//will not accept my donations//I have failed//I find myself nonsensical; ânothing is never enough as we wither with the sands of timeâ//I am lost in the atmosphere between//sanity and my mindâs corruption//I was dragged to the lands that bleed forever//and I returned to nothing//I have searched through the inner workings//there was nothing left//I escaped from the lands that grieve forever//and I returned to nothing//I have searched through the inner workings//there was (nothing)//there was built a perception of life//beyond the borders of death//there was built a perspective of life//at the borders of death//I am lost in the atmosphere between.
