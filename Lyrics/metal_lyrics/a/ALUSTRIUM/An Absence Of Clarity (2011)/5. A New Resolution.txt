Pain
Driven to point of madness
Breathe
The smell of sweet destruction
Changed
Once innocent, now tainted
Graves
Shallow and made impromptu

To the sun
I say goodbye
The things I'll do
Shift paradigms
The one you know
Is dead and gone
Through changing eyes
I see the moon

Leave the day
Bring me into night
My change accomplished
Feel the wrath
I'm destroying

Destroyed
My life and love and family
Ablaze
My home and my belongings
Life
Became too much to handle
So I
Resolved to turn to blackness

To the sun
I say goodbye
The things I'll do
Shift paradigms
The one you know
Is dead and gone
Through changing eyes
I see the moon

Leave the day
Bring me into night
My change accomplished
Feel the wrath
I'm destroying myself

The fall of order by my hand
Astonished all across the land
With failing hearts and frail bodies
The ones I loves fell to their knees
Running wild, flee the scene
I've left behind a trail obscene
With failing hearts and frail bodies
The ones I loved fell to their knees
