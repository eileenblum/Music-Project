I, a slave unto the moon
I bow my head to the floor and pray for black
I am buried among the stars
The speak to me, tell me the words of a new god

I worship the night
My goddess
I am one with the dark
Nocturnal
Lucifer calls my name

Years and years pass until I awake
The sun has abandoned me and I mourn my soul

I worship the night, my goddess
I am one with the dark, nocturnal
Lucifer calls my name

I must repent for whats been done
for i wish
for i need, to see the sun

Now this cloak doesn't feel right
Now reborn is my sight
I am regretting my choice
Consciousness, conscience now voiced

Regret this path

As twilight dwindles I await the sun

I do not wish to again be
tempted by the lies beckoning
me to close my eyes forever

It is now that i make amends
for all the wrongs I did commit
during the blackness that blinded
these now open eyes

welcome back into the light
