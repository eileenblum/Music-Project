Deep within the confines
A cage, a prison cell
Locked tight, without the possibility'
No holes for escape
One light shining through the cell
Unknown source, questionable direction
Dead silence, all alone
Concrete separating from reality

What is and what could be done held back by one layer
The power to create and destroy held back only by bone
There must be a way to break this barrier without ascending
to the next world

The soul, a man's personal god
Channeled and put to work
Let loose from within its cage
Could tear the world in two

What is and what could be done held back by one layer
The power to create and destroy held back only by bone
There must be a way to break this barrier without ascending
to the next world

With death as a deterrent from setting our souls free
We are trapped without the abilities
That are caged within our minds
Creation, destruction. to make physics dysfunction
All is kept hidden by only one layer of bone

Damn the greater ones for locking it up
Cursed this damned body for holding it back

All the potential of mankind held back
Painting words within with no exterior outlet
Conjuring up fantasies which should
Be realized but never can nor will

Crack the skull
Shed the skin
Stay on this plane
Use your potential

With death as a deterrent from setting our souls free
We are trapped without the abilities
That are caged within our minds
Creation, destruction. to make physics dysfunction
All is kept hidden by only one layer of bone
