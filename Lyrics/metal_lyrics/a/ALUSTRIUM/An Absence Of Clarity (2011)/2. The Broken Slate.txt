Shunned and tossed away
Ugly, pitiful trash
Atrophy, decay
Bitter blood and bile
Stripped and skinned and hung
Minimal remorse
Praying for a savior
Mouth and mind of empty hope
Left to die

Coward - Callous
Victim - Butcher
Bloody hooks and blades
Anger - restraints
All forces and traces of will
Denied - Hate
Aimed at a beloved killer
Who can only smile

Clawing whilst tumbling down
Screaming at the pain

Like a callous
One becomes used to the pain
And aching, throbbing and eventually

Bleeding - Breaking
Tearing
Associated with joy
And love - Pleasure
Centers tingling at the thought of
Torture - Salivating
Blood becomes the bane of your existence

Docile whilst tumbling down
Laughing at the pain
Another killer made
Through Stockholm Syndrome

Set free
Kept alive
The victim becomes the butcher
The parasite becomes the host

Hatred begets hatred just as pain begets pain
In the end we all become the way we were raised
A blank slate written on by hand with omnipotency
Shall crave more stimulation of the same
good or bad

Humans fall in love with whatever creates a pattern
Adapting to the form of stimulant regardless of source
The beauty of our species is the ability to change
Minds and thoughts and bodies may be crushed and rearranged
The cycle repeats itself

Shunned and tossed away
Ugly, pitiful trash
Atrophy, decay
Bitter blood and bile
Stripped and skinned and hung
Minimal remorse
Praying for a savior
Mouth and mind of empty hope
Left to die
