Floating up high
Above the world
She sees all and knows
Nothing can touch
No one can feel
The nothing that she is
What is her life?
She needs to know
Or else it could be extinguished
How can nothing be effected by nothing?
She sings all alone

Butterfly wings
No one can see

She will never feel again

Out of body
Detached from the world
She neither loves nor hates
There is no joy
No regret
Nothing can have no emotion

Killed by her thoughts
Dead on the inside

She exists only in her mind

When the sense of self is lost a new self must be born
So what will you do when the inevitable comes
and your wings are torn?

Floating up high
Above the world
She sees all and knows
Nothing can touch
No one can feel
The nothing that she is
What is her life?
She needs to know
Or else it could be extinguished
How can nothing be effected by nothing?
She sings all alone

Butterfly wings
No one can see
Killed by her thoughts
Dead on the inside
