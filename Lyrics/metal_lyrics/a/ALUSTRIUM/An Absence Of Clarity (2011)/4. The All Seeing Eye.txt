In dark places
In this world
There lurks spectators
Following always
Omnipresent
Ever watching

We are all watched by the eye

Just a minion
Just a pawn
For our leaders
Our betters
For our own good, they observe
Omnipresent
Ever watching

We are all watched by the eye

Do not speak for the walls have ears
Keep your head down, stay away from sight
Do not speak for the walls have ears
Keep your head down, stay away from sight

I refused to be watched anymore
I think its time for a change

Take me away
Kill me now
I refuse to comply

Are you watching me now?
Look closely
Watch me tear down the walls of this world

Eye
Blind the eye

Blind the eye
