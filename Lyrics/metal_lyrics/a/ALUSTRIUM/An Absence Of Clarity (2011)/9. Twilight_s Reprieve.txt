Within the light, hidden shadows
Desolate one, take control
Conquer them all, through mind corruption
They'll take the bait
Throw the bone

When the light rises, I remember
To forget the dark
The shadows of the night surrender
Surrender yourself
This protection can only last so long
How long?
What will be of the ever after?

Pray for your sins
This is the end

Carry the torch, ever burning
We'll light the way
To your demise
Their enemies lay in pieces
All that remains
Up in flames

When the light rises, I remember
To forget the dark
The shadows of the night surrender
Surrender yourself
This protection can only last so long
How long?
What will be of the ever after?

These are your fears

Pray for forgiveness, for your time has come
The first ones to flal are the fortunate ones
Trample the weak and hurdle the dead
Paving the streets with the blood of the innocent

Sink into your ever after

(Twilight's Reprieve)

Pray to your god, for the hour is now
Your soul will be taken, your flesh hits the ground
The dead will be eating your rotting remains
The story has changed, but the ending's the same

Pushing the fire

This deserves to explanation
One solution, extermination
No Mercy

Nothing to lose
Nothing to gain
Twilight's reprieve will join you in your grave
