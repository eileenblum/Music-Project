Clones of clones
All common enemies
Working against one another for a common goal
A race enslaved, institutionalized
Held down by the iron chains
they forged with their own hands

Blind all their eyes
And teach them to
Do as they're told
Do not ask why
Mute all their thoughts
And quiet their wills
Increase the damage
Kill what makes humans animals
There is no room for instinct

Bred to follow years of tradition
Meant to excel, but never to exceed

Blind all their eyes
And teach them to
Do as they're told
Do not ask why
Mute all their thoughts
And quiet their wills
Increase the damage
Kill what makes humans animals
There is no room for instinct

Further the degradation to our minds
All in the effort of advancing mankind

Listen to the words
Pay attention
Be all you can be
Within the limits
Follow all the rules
Disobey them,
Live your life in captivity

The world is getting smaller
Its every man for himself
Carry with you a blade and a smile
And only strike when the back is turned

Only strike when the back is turned
Such are the rules for success

The world is getting smaller
Its every man for himself
Carry with you a smile and a dagger
And only strike when the back is turned

Only strike when the back is turned
Such are the rules for success

When a man is asked to abandon
All that he was given from birth
There can only be one result
And that is total conformity of the soul
