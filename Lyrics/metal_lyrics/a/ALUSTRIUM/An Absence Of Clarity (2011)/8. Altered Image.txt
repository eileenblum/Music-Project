Brother, my brother
Untimely ripped from this world
Swallowed by earth, my soul left to bleed
An act of conviction
And as we stand two worlds apart
My life force drained, my slowing heart
Plagued with the thoughts of retribution

Tears fall in the presence of rain
Awake or dreaming, we can no longer tell
Our world has flooded
Solace only in a final farewell

Longing for solace
A prayer for reprieve
Six feet never felt so deep
I raise my hands to blackened skies
But you hear not my tortured cries
Your story forever left untold

Tears fall in the presence of rain
Awake or dreaming, we can no longer tell
Our world has flooded
Solace only in a final farewell

Only reflections
The mirror holds the portrait of a memory
An altered image
Now holds the remnants of what used to be

To live in the hearts of those we leave behind
is not to die.
