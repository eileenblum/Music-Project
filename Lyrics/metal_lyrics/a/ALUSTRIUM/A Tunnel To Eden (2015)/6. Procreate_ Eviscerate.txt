Love seems so sweet, so important
Necessary to survival?
I think so
Procreate
Form a perfect life, forge a perfect world
Then cut it in half and throw it away
Eviscerate
She meets your desires
She is all you need
And so you work
To try to impress
Because you donât know
If you can keep living alone
She doesnât like it
So live a lie
And wear a smile
Donât pretend that you donât know
The stone drags down as dead weight
You cannot claw your way back to the top
The air flows from within as drowning screams
And is replaced by years of suffering
Love seems so vile, unimportant
Necessary to survival?
I think not
Procreated
Set off with good intentions, came back with only regret
And now you want a bullet in a brain
Hers or yours?
You stick around
Itâs what you know
You can be happy
Donât pretend that you donât know
Youâre dying inside
But thereâs no escape
Just keep on acting
One of you will surely break
The stone drags down as dead weight
You cannot claw your way back to the top
The air flows from within as drowning screams
And is replaced by years of suffering
Better or worse
Its always worse
Maddening Disdain
Suffering
Chained together by promises and deceit
And all the while you keep feigning your smile
The stone drags down as dead weight
You cannot claw your way back to the top
The air flows from within as drowning screams
And is replaced by years of suffering
Forever is a long time to spend with your own bane
Love fleets so fast, time does not
And now you just want it to waste away
