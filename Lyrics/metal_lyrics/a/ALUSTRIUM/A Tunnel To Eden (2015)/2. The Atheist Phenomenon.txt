They try to dominate
Tell us what to think
But you believe differently so you are the devil
Spreading their white wings to envelope us all
Hoping to illuminate
Forward their agenda
They dismiss what you know intrinsically
All you know is a lie
Wrong
They offer their false proof to everyone
All while keeping closed minds
Wrong
Shouting words of disapproval to those who are content as is
Wrong
Forcing their precious books straight down your throat and who are you
to deny?
What kind of fool are you?
Itâs plain to see
You have no proof otherwise
Give up your beliefs
Widely accepted prophecies
Laws to live your life by
They were once prosecuted, yet they do the same despite
This is a fact, you see
Itâs objective truth
All that you know is faith
Why do you blindly accept it as fact?
Confirm all the evidence that applies
But dare not determine for yourself
Condemned by all who disagree
You must constantly try
Try to back up your beliefs as they repeatedly pry
All that you know is faith
Why do you blindly accept it as fact?
Confirm all the evidence that applies
But dare not determine for yourself
You are equally as blind as you think I am
All your facts are just blind faith
Hidden, disguised as truth
The blind lead the blind
The deaf hear the dumb
The dumb smite the deaf
The blind shout what they see
The deaf hear what they wish
The dumb speak no words
Hatred has always been directed at those deemed ânon-believersâ
The court may have changed, the audience new, but the rules and bloodshed remain
The atheist phenomenon, a church of defiance
The new worlds own crusade
Hatred will always be the antithesis of tradition and the pastâs truth
But thesis and antithesis come together
Synthesis; born from hate
Humans seek their own truth
Disagreeing and denying
Science and religion function through the same means
Hard to accept that what you know is not knowing
Itâs faith
Show us all some proof that is something you have found
Words of another do not count as evidence towards objective truth
What you believe is all written in some book
Just some book
Act as though you just know centuries of discoveries
These are not your own thoughts
Just the ones you believe
Force others to explain why they hold their values
Object, mock them, hate them
Pray upon their faith
These are not your own thoughts
Just the ones you believe
