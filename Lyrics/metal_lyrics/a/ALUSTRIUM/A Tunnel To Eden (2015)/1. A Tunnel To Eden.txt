Always overlooked
Exists behind the scenes of my world
A hunger deep within
My perfect self dwells in my shadow
Reality goes black as tides of pain recede
Thoughts of my daily stressors dissolve from consciousness
Take hold of all that matters, a burning light within
Dispel all false illusions
Return to my perfection
Just out of consciousness to hide me from you, hide from all
Dig down away from earth
I enter a realm of peace
I retreat from this existence to embrace a greater form
Stripped away from mind and body
Endure only as sensation
Euphoric, delightful feelings stimulate my useless arms
Ripped away from mortal coil to a heaven free from toil
This, my end result
The justifying of my means
Self mutilation, poison is the final cure
Reality goes black as tides of pain recede
Dispel all false illusions
Return to my perfection
My shell, my useless corpse of dust
Silently, gracelessly crawls over blood and needles
A draining pulls from below
A haunting, dreading want
A terrible need for substance
A cry for more
The story begins anew
The quest for an escape
The charred remains of what was once a life exist only to taunt me
I retreat from this existence to embrace a greater form
Stripped away from mind and body
Endure only as sensation
Euphoric, delightful feelings stimulate my useless arms
Ripped away from mortal coil to a heaven free from toil
This, my end result
The justifying of my means
Self mutilation, poison is the final cure
Reality goes black as tides of pain recede
Dispel all false illusions
Return to my perfection
Just out of this, my world exists only pain
Iâve been hurt
Free from all weaknesses
I say my last farewell to you
I slip from my shell
I move into euphoria
A shapeless world with no bounds
Never mind the physical and never mind the consequence
Just keep on digging further down, and digging and dig
Layers of skin just melt away
Fall away at a touch, peel away as scabs
Sensitivity decreases as the world who never understood
Can never understand, will never understand why I dig
