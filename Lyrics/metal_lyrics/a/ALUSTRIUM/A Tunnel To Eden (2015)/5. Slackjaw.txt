In a world based on social norms, there are those who donât fit the mold These people... are called insane
The machines work feverishly throughout night
Never ceasing, always driving
Working to keep up the pace, continue producing
Dangerous, overheating
The surveyors pick those who underperform, the stupid to hold them back, to replace their parts
Make them fit in, fix all their problems
The slow undergo a furious process to make them right
Never ceasing, always changing
Working to become the best, to get back in line
Constantly made to appease
The elites are well versed in machinery
Built to coerce the ones who are broken to make them function
Why is it that you refuse to stay in the lines?
I am asking you please just shut up and give in
I know it doesnât make any sense to you now, but I promise by the end that you wonât even care
Weâll medicate, put him under
Get the restraints, tie him to the bed
Now behave, be one of us
Why are you screaming?
He resisting, heâs so sick
Just listen to us, we know whatâs right
Why is it that you refuse to make up your mind?
I am asking you please just shut up and give in
I know it doesnât make any sense to you now, but I promise by the end you wonât even exist
Weâll medicate, put him under
Get the restraints, tie him to the bed
Now behave, be one of us
Why are you screaming?
Heâs resisting, heâs so sick
Just listen to us, we know whatâs right
Crash, burn, now learn
This will not work
In our world of social norms, this one does not fit the mold
This boy has gone insane
Now, tie him down nice and tight, this is not going to go very smoothly
Iâm going to shove this long metal rod into his eye and fix his brain
Good boy, now hold still
I would not want to slip up and destroy your mind
Good boy, now hold still
I would not want to slip up and destroy your mind
You have been fixed
The empty shell is all that remains
The person before now is dead
Staring slack-jawed at the wall
Heâs now much less of a burden
Weâll parade him around, a triumph for science
Once guilty, now innocent
A sweet little angel, heâs helpless now but surely itâs an improvement
You have been fixed
Now offering a one time solution
A cure for mental illness
A crude, bloody, but easy trick capable of bringing them into the flock
