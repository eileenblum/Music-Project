Now with all the knowledge
And skills gained in life
I move into exile
Iâve said my goodbyes
Iâve conquered every plain
My body is satisfied
Created, destroyed, questioned
I need only to die
As Iâve continued to grow Iâve noticed
With one blink of an eye
What was abundant now absent
And itâs impossible to stay in one state
With each passing second
The present problems become the past
Grow no more
Terminate
A concept debated for years
So final, so solid, so absolute
A word feared by every soul
Each heart beats frantically in cowardice
As Iâve continued to grow Iâve noticed
With one blink of an eye
What was abundant now absent
And itâs impossible to stay in one state
With each passing second
This generation becomes the past
It is time
Initiate
I came with nothing
Iâll leave with knowledge
Iâm at my end
I embrace for the final moments
With everyone grasping for straws
Trying to explain
The meaning of it all, and how to die
The message is repeated by billions
We donât know, we just donât know
And Iâm just trying to explain
Trying to move on
Trying to accept my age
With my head tilted back
My throat open, I scream to the gods
With such intensity my throat fills with blood
I tell the sky, Iâm ready to die
A gasp for air, I fall to the ground
Once body, now merely a corpse
My skin shreds, my bones go to dust
My blood boils and seeps through the soil
Whatâs left, a soul left unbound
Now begins a sought after passage
Dark encompassed, I search for a light
The smoke and fog engulf all around
Terrified shrieks turn to laughs
I cannot feel but am filled with sensation
Come below the world and find
Punishment for all your crimes
A river of tortured souls
Flows forth to a mouth of enormous size
Swallowed, cleansed in acid
Surrounded by prying eyes
Join us as we all sit here for all of time and repent our past mistakes, and curse the god who breathed our breath into our lungs in the first place
Cut the thread
I have felt so certain
But now Iâm not sure that Iâm ready to leave
I have yet to even consider the possibility of oblivion
Or if itâs Hell that awaits me at the light
Feel the drain
Feel no pain
What of the end?
What will I become?
Where will I go?
Why did I live?
What was the point?
What did I gain?
Did I ask for this life?
When itâs your time to go, itâs your time to go
I never asked for this
I feel this is unfair
Ready
I need more time
Or
I am so afraid
Not
I lied to myself
Die
I donât want to die
As Iâve continued to grow Iâve noticed
With one blink of an eye
What was abundant now absent
And itâs impossible to stay in one state
With each passing second
The present era the past
Grow no more
Terminate
It is time
Begin decay
This is the end
Pack all your things
Say your goodbyes
And evacuate
