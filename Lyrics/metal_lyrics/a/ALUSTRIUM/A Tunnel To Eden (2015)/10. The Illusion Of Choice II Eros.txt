Self-awareness finally
Iâm no longer puzzled
By what I am now
I am a child
So much expected of me
Grow up, obey, learn
I know what I must do
Grow strong, be a man
Subservient to my masters
Everyone is above me
I will learn who I am
Mother
Nurse me, clean me, and teach how I am to act
To young as yet to write the rules
Maybe some day that will change
I will be what I wish
Learning
Language, faces and shapes
Societyâs rule over me
Strangers are in charge
Schooling followed by work
Life goes on and I grow and things change
Then things change and I grow, life goes on
I am getting sick of this
Being under your foot
Life goes on and I grow and things change
Then things change and I grow, life goes on
Forge an identity other than somebodyâs slave
I will work to free myself from societyâs evil grip, its hatred of the individual I will break the bonds that were forced on me at birth
âMan is born free but everywhere is in chainsâ -Rousseau
I am forced to work, to learn a trade, to earn my keep
I am told to slow, settle and find another
I have become what I have feared most, a spouse, a dad, Iâm chained
Iâm no longer free to pursue my dreams, my destiny has run its course
Born into this world I was free of sins, but not without a path carved in stone by generations of the same men
Iâm trapped and I cannot get out!
I struggle with the chains on my feet but the harder at them that I pull, the links become more entangled and ensnared
Iâm tired
I give in I will conform
If I must Iâll play by the rules
And I do and when I do
I succeed
Now Iâm getting old
I prepare for my rest
I look back at what Iâve done, at what Iâve created
Maybe my kin can break the chains that have bound me from first light
Maybe the new generation can fix the problems that have plagued mine
