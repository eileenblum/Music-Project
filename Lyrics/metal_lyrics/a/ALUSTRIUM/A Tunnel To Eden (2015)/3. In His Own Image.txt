Four point six billion years
Crafting, shaping, molding
The final inheritors of Godâs land poised to bring it to an end
The extinct and the living and all to come bow in the wake of the new gods
With a hunger billions strong they spread out and conquer
And no other species is safe
The prophecy comes true, made in Godâs image
The perfect race perfected at last
The planet now is doomed
As they feed, expand, and they wreck
Lets celebrate because evolution has worked
The final form has come to be
Fill the lands from end to end
Kill everything and drain the sea
Plague runs rampant through populations but constantly defeated by their science
The heavens send disasters, viruses and cancer
But no amount of rain could douse this fire
The blinded masses wonder of the apocalypse
But they do not realize their power end
Without regard for natural cycles or gradual depletion weâre bleeding the
planet dry
Plague runs rampant through populations but constantly defeated by their science
The heavens send disasters viruses and cancer
But no amount of rain could douse this fire
Lets celebrate because evolution has worked
The final form has come to be
Fill the lands from end to end
Kill everything and drain the sea
A culmination of liars and cut throats rule the world as masses of morons grow fat and tired
Without regard for natural cycles or gradual depletion weâre bleeding the planet dry
Bear upon your back responsibility for this devastation
Created in your image?
A little too well, too precise
Survival of the fittest is no more
Only the fit are alive
Witness perfection, masters of famine, pestilence and science
Go forth my sons
Put this world out of its misery
Tear it down
Wear down the mountains and build up the valleys
Push your boundaries further and further and further; end to end
Then build up
Grow tall and expand into heaven
Dominate that too
Strip it all away
Leave it bare
Leave this world hollow
Expand and then do it again
