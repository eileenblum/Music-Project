The beast feeds within
Feasting on my blood
With malicious intent
Teeth that rip
I feel it tearing organs
And shredding hope
Itâs clawing at my stomach
With claws that burn
I cannot shake this
This feeling of self-loathing
I cannot take this
This gradual suicide
Something or someone eats away at the back of my mind, my identity
Scouring my every thought and notion
Turning pure thoughts into murder
The beast takes control of our shared body
Doing as I only watch
Spectate helplessly
I feel it slowly take all I am
Waves overflowing
Our consciousness
I cannot shake this
This feeling of self-loathing
I cannot take this
This gradual suicide
Something or someone eats away at the back of my mind, my identity
Scouring my every thought and notion
Turning pure thoughts into murder
I must fight the black that has now appeared
Within my veins
Inch by inch Iâll take control
Relearn how to stay my hand
My mind is torn apart
Ripped in two
Consciousness ripped in twain
Looking to find the root
Cut the head off this, my possessor
So a war rages in my head
I fight with all
My strength is not enough to fight
I lose track of the defining seam
We begin to meld
We begin to mesh
I will tolerate no more of this behavior from you
I have worked to raise us up, and I have worked to drag you down
I have worked raise me up, I have worked to pull you down
I have worked to make me great; I have worked to make you small
I will work to dominate; I will work to possess all
I will soon exterminate whatever piece of you remains
I accept this offering
Itâs all for me
Itâs always been for me
This is no longer yours
As we are now only one
As we go forward
Take comfort
I will bring us to an end
