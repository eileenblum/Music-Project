I shall scream in silence
I'll cry but not shed a tear
I shall speak with no sound
I shall hurt with no pain
Your heart's as black as the night
On my death bed I'll crawl
You hold the breath to my life
Something dies within
My soul whispers your name
Are you there?
Ocean of my fears
I shall drown for you
Inhibitions die, with your blinding light
I yearn for you now
Taste me, bleed me dry
Time cire slow like mourning
Without you in my sight
Something burns within me
Deep within my eyes
