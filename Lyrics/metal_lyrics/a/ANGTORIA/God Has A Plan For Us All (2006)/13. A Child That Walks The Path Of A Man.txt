[Bonus track]

A face that stuns me
Sends my soul into shock
A voice that numbs me
Re-directs my destiny

Did I try to run before I could walk?
Seems you place the blame on our demise
Did my emotions cloud my judgement?
Your world of lies, I knew the truth!

So you think you know whatÂ´s good for me?
That's why you turned your back?
I hope you die, internally
For every tear I cry, I cried alone

This lame excuse, you give me
Am I expected to except this?
I hear you say "You donÂ´t need me!
Move on, your better off without me"!

Did you try to run before you could walk?
I shall place the blame on our demise
Did your emotions cloud my judgement?
I lived a lie, You knew the truth!

So you think you know,whats good for me?
That's why you closed that door?
I hope you live, Regretfully!
Knowing what you lost, You lost me

I brought you heaven, You gave me hell
Your anger shut me out
I know you wont forget, that final kiss
I hope it burns inside
