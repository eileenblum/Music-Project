I wish you could be
All you ever dreamed
Move on, no regrets
Try to be the absolute best
Stand on your own
You can make it, be someone
With the war in your head
That's what the wise lady said!
There'll be times, when you can't face
The weary lights of the day
But be strong and believe
You can be anything you wish to be
Don't let your fears hold you back
Life isn't meant to be easy
Find justice for what you lack
Time will heal the scar
Be proud of who you are
Taste the fantasies that you dread
That's what the wise Lasy said!
I came from nothing, here I am!
I won the war in my head!
