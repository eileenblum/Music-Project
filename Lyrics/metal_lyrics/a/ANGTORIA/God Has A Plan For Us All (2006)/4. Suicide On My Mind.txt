Did I want to live
Within the empty space
My sleep numbed my pain
Now I'm awake
My sanity has gone
Little girl screams
For life's release
Don't hold me back I want to fall
Little girl pleads
For life's disease
To mourn away my soul
Did I want to die
Pain consumed me inside
Heaven on my tongue
Drunk down with suicide
Beyond self control
My urge has gone
Little girl screams
For life's release
Don't hold me back I want to fall
Little girl pleads
For life's disease
To mourn away my soul
Time does not heal
A shame so surreal
Little girl screams
For life's release
Don't hold me back I want to fall
Little girl pleads
For life's disease
To mourn away my soul
