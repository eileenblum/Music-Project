Each morning I prayed
My mirror displayed my disgrace
From the anger, bruised upon my face
Dragged through the halls
Your cycle reborn
Lose your grip on life
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Relive your nightmares through us
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Unleash your pain and punish us
Reach out to you, you raise your iron fist
Betrayed, not raised, dismissed!
Your loveless life, no heart warming twist
Neglect, your deflect! Forced to shy away
Dragged, we will fall
Corruption reborn
Lost your grip on life
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Relive your nightmares through us
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Unleash your pain and punish us
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Dismantle what's laid before you
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned
Drive us insane and banish us
