Glass eyes stare, when tempted by
A smile for the unknown, headrush
Like the river wild
I see in your eyes a reflection of
Something forbidden
Unleashed by a lie you inspired
I live in your shadow, your secret
Betrayal I clutch in my hand
Deception was not your intention
Deity of disgust
I was destined to take plague to my grave
Dug by my self pity
Captured by the thrill of my prey
Young skin so addictive
Falling faster than rain
Can't control this craving
Not that I feel the need to
I live in your shadow, your secret
Betrayal I clutch in my hand
Deception was not intention
Deity of disgust
