Everything happens for a reason
Everything you love turns to dust
Everything you touch yearns for poison
Your eyes lust too much
I tried so hard to control my mind
To remain true to you
Thrashing the waints of innocence inside
But no desire to restrain myself
I hate to love but love to hate
What did I do to deserve all this from you?
I can't believe you turned us into this!
It's far from beauty and the beast, our saga ends
Disgust! I trust you will burn in hell!
Acquiescence, my gift to you
But on my knees, I'll never do
Take your path hand in hand
Like a fool, I follow you
Bleak I seem, now to you
Within your eyes, I am nothing new
Your heinous crime, watch my decline
Your vicious lips revolt me
What did I do to deserve all this from you?
I can't believe you turned us into this
It's far from beauty and the beast, our saga ends
Disgust! I trust you will burn in hell!
