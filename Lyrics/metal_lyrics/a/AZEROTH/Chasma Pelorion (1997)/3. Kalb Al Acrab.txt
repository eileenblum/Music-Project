Great Kalb al acrab feeding of supreme hate
Powerful red scorpion burning your impetus
Madim delights of Kalb al Acrab

[Chorus:]
Defeat fear of everything living
Lit star of worse radiance
And we'll cheer up in ecstasy of deliver

Madim! Lord of brutality rules on the other side
Majestic spiritual betrayer your government is closing.
Open the terrible mysteries
Blind by red light those who are deserving to rise to your throne

[Repeat chorus]
