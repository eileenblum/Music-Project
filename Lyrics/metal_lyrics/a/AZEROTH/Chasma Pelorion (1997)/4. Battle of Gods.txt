I have seen agitation in the depth of created
Irate whirl wind goes from the depths of universe
Abyss genius will opened the gates of time and
Elements entered in moon force
It has thundered the great darkness is awakening!

The Great battle immortal sons flaming abyss with
Power of light sons of being...
Eternal and irreparable, beginningless

Darkness has mixed with light
There is no creation any more, perfectly wild and ugly.
Existence melts under great sons swords
