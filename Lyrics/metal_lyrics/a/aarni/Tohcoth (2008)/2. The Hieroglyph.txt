From the Crown, out of Wisdom
Thou, oh Understanding, art Mercy
Queen of Severity, now the perfect Beauty.

The One becomes Two by the law of polarity
revealed within the Three essentials
that will be found within the Four elements
wherein is to be found the Quintessence
which is not of the Four, but One of the Three.

In the Victory of all Splendour
for the Foundation of the Ages of the Universe.
