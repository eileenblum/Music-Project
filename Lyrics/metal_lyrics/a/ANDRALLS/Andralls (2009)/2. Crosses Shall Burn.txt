Vanished tomorrow
Fire in the sky
I feel the pain
This pain shall last
Corrupted Gods
Crosses will burn
Divine mistake
A dead mankind

Crosses will burn
Burn

Every corner I see
Betrayal, disrespect
Envy, corruption
Unexpected punishment
Our lost souls
Outside our bodies
Without a fate
In the fucking darkness

Wars and conflict
Pestilence, disease
Infesting the Earth
Crosses shall burn

Vanished tomorrow
Fire in the sky
I feel the pain
This pain shall last
Corrupted Gods
Crosses will burn
Divine mistake
A dead mankind

Wars and conflict
Pestilence, disease
Infesting the Earth
Crosses shall burn

"A dead mankind
Infesting the Earth
Divine mistake
Crosses shall burn"
