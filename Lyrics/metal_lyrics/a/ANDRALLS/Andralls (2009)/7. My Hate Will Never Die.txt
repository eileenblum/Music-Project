I'm gonna destroy your life
Your soul, your body, your mind
You are a motherfucker and ignorant
I've got the power in my hands

Now it's time for war, not time for peace
Now it's time for war, not time for peace

I'm gonna look in your eyes
Before you fall at my side
You are a loser and coward
Don't try to escape from your life
This is your reality

My hate
Your fear
My hate

My words against your lies
Your lies against my mind
My hate against your pride
My hate will never die

I'm gonna destroy your life
Your soul, your body, your mind
You are a motherfucker and ignorant
I've got the power in my hands

Now it's time for war, not time for peace
Now it's time for war, not time for peace

I'm gonna look in your eyes
Before you fall at my side
You are a loser and coward
Don't try to escape from your life

My words against your lies
Your lies against my mind
My hate against your pride
My hate will never die

This is your reality!!
