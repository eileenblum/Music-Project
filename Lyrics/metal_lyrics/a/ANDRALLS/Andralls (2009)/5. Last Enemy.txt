Revolt inside the walls
Revolt with no end
I must kill them all
No one shall stand
Unleashing all anger
Unleashing all pain
I'm the coldest murder
He escapes in vain

This time there's no choice
This time there's no escape for them
This time we win and celebrate
This time the last enemy won't stand

Die, die
I'll watch you bleeding
Die, die
I'll watch you begging
Die, die
I'll watch you suffering
Die, die
Yes, I'll watch you dying

[lead]

So long we've waited
To take this power
So long we've watched
This rising empire
This time for revolt
This time for war
They beg for mercy
We claim for more

This time there's no choice
This time there's no escape for them
This time we win and celebrate
This time the last enemy won't stand

Die, die
I'll watch you bleeding
Die, die
I'll watch you begging
Die, die
I'll watch you suffering
Die, die
Yes, I'll watch you dying

Revolt inside the walls
Revolt with no end
I must kill them all
No one shall stand
Unleashing all anger
Unleashing all pain
The killing is complete
Even you won't stand

This time there's no choice
This time there's no escape for them
This time we win and celebrate
This time the last enemy won't stand
