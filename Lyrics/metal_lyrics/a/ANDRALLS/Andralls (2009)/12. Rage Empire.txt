Behind these walls
Rottenness reigns unique
The seeds of hate
Arise all the time
Hostility
Reigns more and more
This is a cancer
With no cure

The machine
Commands poverty
In a dead
And archaic world
Ignorance
Got spread in the masses
As the flames
Burn in the ashes

Behind these walls
Rottenness reigns unique
The seeds of hate
Arise all the time
Hostility
Reigns more and more
This is a cancer
With no cure

Rage empire
