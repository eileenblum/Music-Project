In the eyes of the killer they stand
In the vision of the murderer they shall die
Insane dreams, fucking nightmare of thousand deaths
In the eyes of the killer they stand

In his plains, in his aim, they stand
They become these new victims of his madness
Psychotic eyes of the one who shall kill
Every one who believes in a god

In the eyes of the killer!!

In his life there has left a pleasure to kill
In their life death becomes the next door
Eyes of fire, certain strength made of steel
And they become only victims of his will

In the eyes of the killer!!
