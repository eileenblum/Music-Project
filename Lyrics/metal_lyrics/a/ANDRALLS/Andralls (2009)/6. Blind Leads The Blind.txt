Blind
Blind but not dead
Blind but still breathing
Blind but alive
Blinder
Those one already dead
When strength is over
Blind leads the blind

Dead
This time they're all dead
For I am the one who leads the blind

When strength is over
Blind leads the blind

Corruption
Poison of mankind
Endless corruption
Kingdom of the blind
Lambs with no sight
Kingdom of the blind
Lambs with no sight
Blind leads the blind
God's creation
Lambs with no sight
Kingdom of the blind
Blind leads the blind
Ways of perversion
Ways of death and crime
Blind leads the blind
Blind leads the blind

Dead
This time they're all dead
For I am the one who leads the blind

When strength is over
Blind leads the blind
