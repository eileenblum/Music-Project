No fate, no fear, no hope
From pain, from dust, from blood
No chance, no fake, no lie
From dark, from hate, from fight

No trust, no judge, no fuck
From crime, from rage, from force
No shame, no pride, no rise
From Evil, from fire, from high

Let's kill again
Let's kill them all

Chaos and riot
Down the liars
Chaos and riot
Down the liars

Betrayer, full of lies
Betrayer, I see your fucking life

No fate, no fear, no hope
From pain, from dust, from blood
No chance, no fake, no lie
From dark, from hate, from fight

No trust, no judge, no fuck
From crime, from rage, from force
No shame, no pride, no rise
From Evil, from fire, from high

Let's kill again
Let's kill them all

Chaos and riot
Down the liars
Chaos and riot
Down the liars

Betrayer, full of lies
Betrayer, I see your fucking life
