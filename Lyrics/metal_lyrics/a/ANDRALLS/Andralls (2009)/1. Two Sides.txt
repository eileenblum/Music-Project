People can't predict which one to stand out
If it's hell or if it's heaven it's up to you to pick
All in all, different poles, go with the crowd
Heavenly, hypocrisy, what you gonna swing?

Many of them make it big out of cheating
Humiliate, cannot wait, cut in your turn
In cahoots with others, stick the boot in
But quickly to misery they can return

Easy comes you have a boost
But the chickens come home to roost
For your behavior you have to account

You reap what you sow!

Day by day more make believe they can't see clearly
That what they have can get lost completely
Even then stubborn men keep up this line
Choice been made, who to blame, this is the line

Easy comes you have a boost
But the chickens come home to roost
For your behavior you have to account

You reap what you sow!
