You may think you already killed me
You take care with these things that you think
You should look at your back sometimes
You will find all those ones your left behind
You forgot that you left me bleeding to death
You forgot that you shoot me a hundred times
But you should have waited longer to see
That death didn't want to bring me

Not dead yet
Not dead yet

Your should start to think about running away
You should keep your eyes opened night and day
Now it's time for me to be the hunter
Now it's time for me to be the killer
Should I call you now a victim
Should I call you now a prey
There's no turning point this time, my friend
You are a dead man anyway

Not dead yet
Not dead yet
