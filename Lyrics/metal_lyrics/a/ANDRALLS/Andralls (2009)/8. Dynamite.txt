Born in an age of war
Raised just to kill
Born in a an age of fear
Raised just to die

Hate invades our veins
Just like a poison invades your mouth
Hate invades our brains
Just like a poison invades your body

No compromise
No compromise

Born in an age of terror
Raised just to win
Born in an age of panic
Raised just to suffer

We are dynamite
We are dynamite
Dynamite, dynamite

Hate invades our veins
Just like a poison invades your mouth
Hate invades our brains
Just like a poison invades your body

No compromise
No compromise

We are dynamite
We are dynamite
Dynamite, dynamite
