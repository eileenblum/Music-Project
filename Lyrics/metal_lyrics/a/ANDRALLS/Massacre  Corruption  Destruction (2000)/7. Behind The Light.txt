Maybe my hope is over
It's far away again from me
Destruction around the world
I'm dying of the same way

See it in the loneliness
Sadness brings the tears
Without another choice
Scared by my fears

Turn off the lights
When you ask the time
You don't wanna know
What the evil has to show

Behind the light

In the night shadows I see
Ghost stories become true
Spirits flying around me
Caution is the word for you
