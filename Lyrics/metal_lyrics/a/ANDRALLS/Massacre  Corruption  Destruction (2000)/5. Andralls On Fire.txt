When you think about the past
Salvation had been burned
Remember you were not fast
To get death's overcome

Endless pain, collective suicide
Fire in me, fire in my life
Realize you were not blind
Weep and wait for your rite

In the middle of disgrace
Run away, save your side
Helpless, let's make our trace
Blood, salvation my mind

Andralls - Burning Tower
Andralls - Flames devour

This pain was a fact of time
In my heart I have no pride
To live here I'd rather die
And the worst, it was my life

Nothing to pray, nothing to trust
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Hear the screams
There's no more dreams
I will not win
