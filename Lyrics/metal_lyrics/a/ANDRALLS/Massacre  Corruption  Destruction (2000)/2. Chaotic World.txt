Open your eyes
Look at the chaotic world
That is spinning around you
War grows all over the world

Massacre, Corruption, Destruction

Dont be quiet, fight !
What do you expect from your future?

Men and women are been killed
Children dying of hunger
And people are watching this
without doing anything like
nothing is going on

Justice for all

Nuclear weapons
are destroying animals
This is a perfect destruction
