Nothing else, what I feel
By the fire of the sunset
Life is between ground and sky
The solution, I can't find

It's fading like closing my eyes
I pray before I die
An exit is not to cry
When my time to arrive

The moon at midnight
Reflect on my sight

Duel and get the heaven
I have no chance to escape

My soul dominated for fools
Don't push, don't break the rules

One star will born this night
What's the secret of the life
It's fading like closing my eyes
I pray before I die

Run away and find the infinite
The believers may achieve
