I am the frontman
I am the death angel
I come from apocalyptic past
I come back, so it was written

I come bringing my silver bird
and when I fly down
I pour out bombs on you
Good and Bad - Dying
Fuck off - This is my mission

Fire in hell, fire in the sky
Fire in your mind, fury in your eyes

I was the envoy of God
to destroy this shit at all
You had another chance
And they wasted again

Now you're stupid humans
I pour out the fury on you
Their advanced technology
Their guns, their shields, nothing

I come from apocalyptic past
I come back, so it was written
