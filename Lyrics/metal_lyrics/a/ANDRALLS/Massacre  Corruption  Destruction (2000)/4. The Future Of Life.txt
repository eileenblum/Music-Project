Live in constant alert
Feel the fear to every moment
Try to escape from total destruction
It's up to you, to find the solution

Try to smile even with sadness
To fight without knowing who attack
As we dive deep into the madness
Our minds and souls
They're getting black

And you must decide
How is the future of life?
Don't cry, you have to try
Remain your soul being divine
And you must decide

If people have some time
To be hide or get arise
If not, you will die
