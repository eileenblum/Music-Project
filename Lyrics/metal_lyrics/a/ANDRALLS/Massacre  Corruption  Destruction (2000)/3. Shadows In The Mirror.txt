Look into the mirror
There's another world
Pass through the window
Tell me which way to go

You can never stop it
Got a a way to top it
No more mystery

Show me your aggression
Afraid to learn the lesson
The guide you'll need

Run to the holy place
You won't see disgrace
But shadows in the sky

Play, together to the end
Life is just a game
Never fear to die

Back to where you live
There you'll be alone
What a waste of shit
They that could be wrong
