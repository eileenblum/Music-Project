Our tomorrow's day 
What are we gonna say? 
Learning with mistakes 
It can be late 

We don't realize 
The hard way of life 
Revolution's deal 
Destruction is real 

We see crime 
We can't fight 

The return to the fury, overtime 
The return to the thrash blood's mine 

See what you're looking for 
Where is brutality? 
Peace in a dead world 
Win all your enemies
