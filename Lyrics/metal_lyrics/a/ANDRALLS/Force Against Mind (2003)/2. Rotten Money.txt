Final countdown 
Coming near 
Greed in world hands 
Increases on you 

Laws by power 
Their dome 
Faking as a man 
I am this one 

Rotten money 
The jail test 

Politicians 
Poor ideas 
Think about these lies 
Force against mind 

Evident riot 
More and more 
Corruption fails 
Face up, we have the force
