Your life is lost 
You could deny the death 
The mind scares 
You think you are the best 

Pray for your soul 
Blood purify 
The whishing course is always  
at your side 
Live the immortal life 
Deep to glorify 

There's not a salvation, false pray 
Another hard crucifixon, dead faith 
This is the last temptation, awake 
Suffering the pressure 

Feel ending sigh 
Agony is mine 
Cremating all ideas you will die 
Mist eternity 
Faith oppression 
Now way to escape from condemnation
