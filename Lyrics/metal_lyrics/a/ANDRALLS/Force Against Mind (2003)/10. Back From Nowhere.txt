Old spirits have met again 
The presage brings the whole will 
for winning 
Happiness and violence 
Side by side 
Terrible battles 
Another city to destroy 

A mission to be done 
Now glorification 
A long way to run 
For another new hurt battle 

Reunion, terror flash-back 
A lot of critical mass 
Waiting for massacre 
We're here for "fasthrash" 

Back from nowhere 
We have never gone out there 

Screams and tension 
and desire to win 
General violence 
Helping spirits around 

Never think in the end 
Think twice when you say 
Your mind commands your soul 
Don't let your body feel it's alone
