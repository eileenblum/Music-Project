Who has never felt fear in the life overcoming what's near? 
Fight for your dreams 
The solution is to face and speed up the evolution

Destroy the scar 
Taste of sorrow attacks 

Dark pale shade 
You can see nothing 
Death is calling 

Last warning safe exposed 
And the guilt can belong to the force 
Life, very short 
You have never been late to fuck all around
