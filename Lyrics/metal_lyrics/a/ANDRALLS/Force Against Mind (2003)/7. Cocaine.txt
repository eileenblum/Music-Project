Children asking for money 
Being out of control 
Forget the suffering pain 
And killing visions they feel everyday 

Dispersed on the ground 
They can see bodies dying all around 
It's turning day into night 
And preserving sickness in this end of times 

Cocaine, I wanna sniff, I wanna kill 
I want the hell, the blood spills 
The drug is my only deal
