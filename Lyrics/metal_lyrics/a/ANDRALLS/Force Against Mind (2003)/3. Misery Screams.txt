How can you see? 
You don't agree, reality 
How can you dream for a peace  
in human minds? 
How can you die? 
A dead heart, it's fucking time 
How can you be in liberty 
and keep on alive? 

Scenes of misery are put in your eyes 
What's the price of burning in rage time? 
Lucky is a part of keeping alive 
No difference between shit and mankind 

Scream, the agony of the end 
Save the demise of sick bodies 
They don't wanna rest in grave 
Unhappy soul salvation 

Death increase 
My mind decays 
No way to escape 
Don't be afraid 
What a shame!
