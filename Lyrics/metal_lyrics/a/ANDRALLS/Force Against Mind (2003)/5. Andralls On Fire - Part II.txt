Echoes you listen and your eyes can see nobody 
Angels and devils are telling the sad story 
Desperate prayer for staying in purgatory 
No matter how was your life of  
fucking glory 

There's no sight, darkest night 
Eyes are blind 
Kill the beast, my legs will slack 
I kneew down 

Andralls - Burning Tower 
Andralls - Flames Devour 

You rest on a bed 
Your mind is not in peace 
Sins in discussion 
You are feeling sick 

Dead souls are laughing and you cannot touch their skin 
Eternal suferring hoping for pardon of sins 
Questions of living are asked  
to be kept alive 
The chance was given 
Now you can open your eyes
