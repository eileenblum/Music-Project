In the year of a new century and nine months 
From the sky will come a great king of terror 
The sky will burn at forty-five degrees 
Fire approaches the great new city 
In the city of God there will be a great thunder 

Two brothers torn apart by chaos 
While the fortress endures 
The great leader will succumb 

The third big war will begin when the big city is burning 
(Nostradamus 1654) 

This desire in order to deny the pain 
The will for destruction no more in vain 
In the new century, peace season 
Not war even with a reason 
Mind is weak and force makes death 

This land is living on the edge 
Against myself war in my head 
To organize all this mess 
We hope the leader will succumb for stop using the shot gun 
The time, only when you want
