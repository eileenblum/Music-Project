Death became a past way 
A dead world has gone away 
My eyes can bring the real pain 
This fever blocks my way to say 

In memory of creation 
For all a survival subject 
My soul as condemnation 
Internal conflict as a crime 

I decided to resist 
Please man don't spit on me 
I can suffer living here 
In this fucking misery 

Beyond the chaos 
The peace for chaos 

Fear, pain, scream 
Fire, terror, chaos, destruction
