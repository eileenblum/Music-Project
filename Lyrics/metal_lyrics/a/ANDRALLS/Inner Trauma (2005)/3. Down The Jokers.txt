The human instinct says to kill innocents
In the middle of hell
Everybody remains
Shoot against the wall
Non-expression power
From world's TV
Come up faking cowards
Down the jokers
Fun is mike a mess
When involves misconception
Masters of politics
were born through deceptions
Through the lying fact
my eyes get blind
Revenge, destruction, fucking suicide
Money moves the world
The unfair competition
I'm searching - It's disgusting
War downtown
Kill the ancient lying at all
Trust in a worth future
Calm down the cursed culture
Shocked crowd - Manipulation
Distorted visions of hunger in this land
Revolt myself to take jokers away
Don't feed my hope
Forget conditions
Rebellion will come
It's up to the people
