Countries government speak
about the arsenal
Taking fear and provoking the start
of a new big war
Eliminating rates of charges
and leader marks
Discussion forces showing
the conditions to decide
Fighting words - toleration
Fatal words - negotiation
Non-shooting war
Curiosity, invisible bombs of cruelty
Technology towards your head, look up
your eyes I cannot see
guns are under masks, attack
Increasing economy, kill or not
It doesn't matter
I'm sacred by this shit
Every moment the aim
selects a great alarm
The army is waiting for permission
to depart
The legend of pressing buttom
to destroy'em all
Silly demagogy
A bitter taste in my mouth
Cold memories...
