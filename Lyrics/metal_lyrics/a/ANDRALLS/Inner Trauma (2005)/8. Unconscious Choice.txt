Why? I can feel someone is
following me
Why? I can see the thin line
of panic and sanity
Out of my head, I wake up in desperation
From outside, certain death is a destination
There are shadows in my soul
Madness I cannot control
My body like time-bomb
A ll my forces fucking strong
Look at my face, mess the war,
Make your choice
Let me see, your free hands, the agony
My decision even right is crucified
My only world is a night to satisfy
Why? Everytime I need to kill I wanna die?
Inside the room, four walls
the only friends of mine
