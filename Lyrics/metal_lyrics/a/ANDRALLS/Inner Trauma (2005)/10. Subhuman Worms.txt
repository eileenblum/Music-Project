War against the power domination
My country is a future salvation
Patriarchs don't bleed anymore
See what we could offer to all
Total respect - Protectionism
T he trading market
S.O.B.
We don't live in a jungle
This world's doesn't means Holocaust
If you want my name is worm
If you need I say fuck off
Chaos, a civil war
No timeline anymore
Promise, action done
Solution, dollars burn
Rise up the flag, united nation
Bastards, forever abomination
Illusions, believing in equality
Elimination of humanity
