I am coming fast to face up, kill !
Reviving confusion on past days
In front of my eyes, time stands still
Envy, you will lose the human race
Cells are dead and your brain
needs a morgue
Try to innovate, damage and enslave
All your traps are premeditated
Even the worst, it wont be enough
A tied straitjacket, rush!
In vain, the hate in vain, invades,,,
Remind the last time I stopped your rage
Trembling legs, I'll defeat you again
This is the proof I bother you
Stabbing when I turn back
makes you a fool
