Earth is rotten - inside its own beliefs
Imprisoned - rules control, bullshit
Brainwashing - no more euphoria
Obsolete Life - panic and phobia
The age of rage
Smell of red - ideas left
Still surviving - comes infected
Hostage - future's guessing
Haggard - the fire's blessing
Follow all kind of hate in you
Massacre from now
I'm an outlaw
Don't try to scream
They can't hear you
See that image again,
So I say fuck you
We will do the invasion
for the lord of desperation
Surrounded by ignorance
Missing a chance
