Rests of chemical trash - boiling shit
Leading population to insanity
Gutter exceeds all capacity
Wasting food - my reality
Piles of dead bodies below my steps
Pure disgrace, evil comes fast
What can I do, what can I see
I just wanna breathe
Society decays
Where are the opportunities?
Everlasting rain - apocalypse
Heavy traffic, crash - no surgery
Assault, education - disparity
The developed underground is rich
Dirty black light, scream of silent night
Corruption faces,
No more patience
