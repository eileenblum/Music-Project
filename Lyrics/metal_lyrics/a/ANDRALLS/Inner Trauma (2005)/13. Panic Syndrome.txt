Claustrophobia,
walls coming to crush you
Innovation, fear
tendencies to disappear
height, many floors, the hallucination
Psychology, I need your dedication
Shiver, crowd, changes, outside
Depression, the blood starts to flow
Panic syndrome never know
Remove a nail from my soul
I cant's stand this pain again
My only game got a checkmate
Skeleton warms up
and bones start to break
You faint and fall
Evoke spirits to conquer the new level
Forget the law
