[Originally performed by Black Sabbath]

Alright now!
Won't you listen?
When I first met you didn't realize
I can't forget you or your surprise
You introduced me to my mind
And left me wanting you and your kind
I love you. Oh you know it
My life was empty forever on a down
Until you took me showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you sweet leaf - though you can't hear
Come on now - try it out
Straight people don't know what you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world will love you sweet leaf
