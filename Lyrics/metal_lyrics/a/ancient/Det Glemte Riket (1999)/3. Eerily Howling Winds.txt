Eerily howling winds
Hear the wolves cry
Cries of hunger
Cries of hate
The ruler in the forest
Below the red moon
Hiding in shadows
Under the golden forest crown
Eerily howling winds
In the deep darkwoods of norway
They're nowhere to be found
The ancient wolfspirit gathered and howled
We are the true pagans, we shall always be
From our day forward, to eternity
Forward in the forest
The old man laughed and grinned
Bringing forth agony
The red full moon
This is my ode to thee
Ancient ruler of my land
Eerily howling winds
Hear the wolves cry
Cries of hunger
Cries of hate
In the old norwegian moon
I will see their red eyes
And I shall greet them
And listen to their beauty songs
Eerily howling winds
