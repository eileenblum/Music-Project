Death herself had chosen me
To let me watch that gruesome scene
And she held me in her daunting hand
Amazed by that macabre view,
My heart begun to pulse
Galvanized by horrors that I saw
The battle was butchering and
The hordes were rising against each other
Saving nothing but death
The dust was rising up in the sky,
Dead bodies were lying on the ground,
A deadly mass of fierce warriors fighting
While the demons were prevailing
On the sons of god
They were tuning dirges saying: "DIE!!!
Meaningless creatures, slaves of the light
I will triumph for the the evil lives in me!"
A veil of flames war covering the field
The bloody battle reached its end
The ancient warriors got victory in hand
The Battle of battles was won!
Her Majesty, the wicked one, was staring at her enemy
Thunderstrucks resounding once again
The seven angels holding trumpets disappeared
god left the field beaten as the earth started to shake...
It was my dream!!!
