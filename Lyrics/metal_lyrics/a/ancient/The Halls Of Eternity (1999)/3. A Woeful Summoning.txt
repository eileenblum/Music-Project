Crestfallen voices from the past,
haunting me
She calls me from the land of the dead,
in twisted tongues
The bells I hear are so cold,
and so woeful
Still I start heading for the graves,
beyond the hills
"I've been waiting for you to come
I am dead to the world, but you know I am here"
At last I realize I can't evade her powers
She's got me mesmerized by her cries
"I want you to come to me!"
"I've been waiting for ages!"
From the land of the dead,
I've been summoned
Her voices telling me,
to join the other side
And as my sense fades away,
my visions transcend
Now I realize,
where I am going
At last I hear, the bells are calling for ME!
