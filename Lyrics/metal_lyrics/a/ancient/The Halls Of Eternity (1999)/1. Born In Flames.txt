I was born in the sign of Racea
From lakes of fire I rose
Born in flames to unleash Armageddon
The powers of Hades are in my command
In this grisly night
I ride the realm of Erebus and Sheol
Across the skies my mark will be known
And the seven seas
Will turn to rabid fire beneath my feet
As the blackened worlds above are shrieking
"By destruction he will build his reign
For he is the one who was born in flames"
Through this stormy night
And over these blazing skies
I reign in genocide from my thrones above
I conflagration of cosmic dimensions
Will flare up the lands in apocalyptic rage
"The time has come, the earth is burning
Embrace the new domain!"
