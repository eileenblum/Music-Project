Watching the universe evaporate into aloof depths
As the realm of desolation unfolds itself to me
My existence now is mercurial
And my fate depends on the astral gods
"A place of loneliness and despair
Far away from the sun
Is where now you belong forever..."
The final doom still awaits me
And my future seems dreadfully dark
The storms from lower cosmos are rising
As the astral gods are awakening
Night after night I find myself
Trapped and lost in a world of solitude
Will I ever see another view?
Or will my essence be forever trapped?
In this corner of universe,
my little goes on unknown!
