Walking in the dark
Not caring where it leads
It begins to rain
Drenched in cold (I madman)
I see a girl
The feeling of alone
I am drawn to her
She is shy and I become alive
The game
She smiles and my blood begins to flow
I madman
"Take my hand and walk with me
Beforewarned I am mad
Laughing now she follows me
What a bad day she has had
I, a madman walking in the rain
A rotting corpse that feels no pain
Upset and angry for feeling so alone
I wish to find a pretty face
And make her all my own"
Pretty pretty silent one
Standing all alone
Come a little closer
So I can hear your moan
Pretty pretty silly girl
I take your hand in mine
I promise that everything
Is just like wine
A bit afraid but still so brave
I madman
I think I love you
I madman
"A crazy violent stormy man
Hidden in a cloak
Walks now with a woman
Whose throat he'd like to choke
I madman who holds your hand
Like the calming of the sea
Watch me as your life unfolds
And your soul is given to me"
Many times I'll see your face
Damn you madman
You haunt me every night
Without a trace
I madman go to happy place
Promises, charm and smiling eyes
I madman
Always kind and always nice
I think you love my grace
"The game is dead you want me
Remember I am mad
Question after question
Takes her by surprise
I tell her I am wicked
And she is not wise
So take the hand of a stranger
You not a madman"
Silly silly little girl
I am having so much fun
So deep you cannot run
Pretty pretty stupid girl... Stay!
There is something I will teach you
Before you go away
"A crazy violent stormy man
Hidden in a cloak
Lies now on the corpse
Of a girl he used to choke
Laughing as he looks at her
With a smile on his face
Grins while he talks to her
And heads off to the special place"
I madman...
