Look at you, fastened by sheltering blanket. Did you think I'd forget how
sweet you taste, nay my umbrageous heart still yearns for you, and still to
peruse your love is such a waste.

You lie there a vision of immaculate purity, yet your eyes reveal the
insatiable whore and now I'll love sucking your vitality with you, my
pretty. I just want more.

First, I'll tear asunder thy mortal garments, unmasking your pale delicate
flesh, then, I shall ravage your lovebroken body. Sinking my teeth upon
your tender breast.

Violently, I'll fuck your pernicious cunt, while consuming the precious
life-force, thoroughly enjoying the sweet flavor. I'll vampirize you,
Natasha, with no remorse.

Until you shrivel into your casket, I shall continue to vampirize Natasha...
