Oh, thou enlightened lover, come roll with me. Oh my fiercest lover, come
roll with me.

All my life I've searched for thee. The wonders you hold are pure ecstasy.
The greatest pleasures you give are most divine. I shall love you 'til the
end of time.

The sensations I feel when you touch me burn stronger than that of the ones
before thee. The volcanic shivers you give when we fuck, reminds me that
mandane females do suck.

Through you, I have found the philosopher's stone. In you my penumbral
heart has found a home. And as you whisper sweet wisdoms into my ears, the
power of cunnilingus brings you to tears.

I smell your hair, red as the brightest rose. Intorication sets in and my
desire grows. We dance until the moon bids farewell. Never shall we sleep
into the fires of hell.

I'll build you a throne in the heart of my mind, where everlasting love ye
always shall find.

Thy temple adorned with fidelity, where I'll worship thy essence eternally.

Oh thou enlightened lover, Come roll with me. Oh my fiercest lover, come
roll with me. Oh my denoted lover, come roll with me. Oh my faithful lover,
come roll with me.

[Solo : Aphazel]

Thou art the answer to all my dreams. Thou art the bringer of orgasms
supreme. And I shall shout to the false god above, Hecate, thou art the one
that I love.

I love you!!
