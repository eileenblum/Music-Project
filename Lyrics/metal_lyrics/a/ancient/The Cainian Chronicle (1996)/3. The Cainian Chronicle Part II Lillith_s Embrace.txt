[Caine:]
'Alone in the darkness I can hear
The sweetest voice
Whispering words of surcease
And I rejoiced!

Who would dare speak to one so
Condemned as I?
Do you know of my most wicked crime?'

[Lilith:]
'I'm known as Lilith, your father's first bride
Like you I'm cursed to dwell in the shadows of night.'

[Caine:]
'How can one survive here in the dark groves forlorn?
Without a sole compainion of a friend of some form?'

[Lilith:]
'But there are many compainions in my infinite kingdom.
Through magick and sorcery I've found my freedom.'

[Caine:]
'I was cold and she clothed me, I starved
And she fed me, I was mournful yet she loved me.

I shed bloody tears and she made them dissapear
She kissed away my tears
Her powers I could see would forever set me free

I begged her to awake me
Her blood, sweet as wine, as I drank she would sigh
Then I closed my eyes

Into the dark I fell and fell
A deepest abyss
Surrounded by obscurity
A price for her gift

Out from the frigid blackness
Came a radiant glimmering light
Revealing the flaming archangel
Known as Michael'

[Michael:]
'Cursed son of Adam
Indeed his mercy is great
Bow thy head and repent thine sins now
Before it's too late.'

[Caine:]
'Not by his grace but my own,
I choose to live with pride
Your 'merciful' god disgusts me
His kingdom infested with lies.'

[Michael:]
'You sad irrelevant fool
Have thy no shame?
You shall forever fear the light
Of the living flame.'

[Caine:]
'On the mornign by silver wing
Raphael came to me and said
Abel did forgive me
Not by his (forgiveness) but mine own
For darkness is my home

I walk alone
My skin would burn by the sun's rays I learned
And the dawn had returned to earth below
I did run seeking shelter from the sun
The endless night of Caine had begun

When I awoke, Uriel appeared
The reaper with black wings
But thrice denied his grace
Hence, my blood-curse begins...'
