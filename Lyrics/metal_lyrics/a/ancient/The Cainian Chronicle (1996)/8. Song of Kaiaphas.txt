I slept in the fires of Hades
But did not burn
I breathed in sulphorous vapors
To reach the astral plane

I tamed the three-headed Cerberus
Then devoured his flesh
I stared deep at the face of the Gorgon
And made her turn to stone

I made love to Prosperine
To taste its bitter venom
I shot an arrow into the eye of the Cyclops
The earth shook as he fell

I called the mighty Kraken
And watched him rise to do my bidding
I soared on the wings of the great dragon
To feel the infernal wind

I hunted the enchanted unicorn
To obtain its horn of power
I entered the labyrinth of Daedalus
And slayed the ferocious Minotaur

I came as the great star
To ignite the blaze of the Phoenix
I'll come to you in the shape of Incubus
And plant my deadly seed
