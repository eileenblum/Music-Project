[music by Aphazel, Lyrics by Grimm]

Reveal to me, let me see, the precious face of yours. In darkness, where I'm alone, come forth with your wars. You, forever my lord. You, forever my lord, I always deny jesus, son of god. Creation, never done by god, salvations, I find in the goat, Lucifer, brand me with your mark, Lord of darkness, come out from the dark ! Red morningstar, watch me attack, I shall reveal, weak son of god, forever the human lies spreading all wrong, (crushed by) all his evil arts, evil arts of war! Creation, never done by god, salvations, I find in the goat, Lucifer, brand me with your mark, Lord of darkness, come out from the dark!
