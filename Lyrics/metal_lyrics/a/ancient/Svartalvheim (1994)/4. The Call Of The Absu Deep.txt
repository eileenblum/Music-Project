[music by Aphazel, Lyrics by Grimm]

You lie still, forever dreaming. Belior, thy serpent calls to thee. Hear me, mighty Cthulu, living on a dream. Cthulu, Lord of dreams. Tiamat, Lord of Seas. Ariel, City of sleep. Cthulu, Lord of the Absu deep. In his arms made of yearn, dead Cthulu waits but dreaming, the enemy rose, Hades, be the kingdom, to cover the earth. Cthulu, Lord of dreams. Tiamat, Lord of Seas. Ariel, City of sleep. Cthulu, Lord of the Absu deep. Hades shall come, back to the earth. In sleep, death's son, unifies. Belfritz, here she unfolds, the secrets of the dead ! Cthulu, Lord of dreams, Tiamat, Lord of Seas, Ariel, City of sleep. Cthulu, Lord of the Absu deep
