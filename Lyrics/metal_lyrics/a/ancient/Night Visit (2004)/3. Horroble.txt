Hunting for pleasures
Feeding from angels
Smelling salts from godbies
Hell no hell no

Living like a devil
Casted far in shadow
All I see is windows
I'm waiting waiting

Look in to the moon do you see in the sky,
the devils ride tonight
When you live by their rules and die like the rest,
this we Never Never
A wink from the crow when you walk on by,
a connection to the horroble
A kiss from the Tongue of a full fledged zombie,
horror it's horroble

When you give in
Your eyes start to lie
Live like the tortured
Babies don't lie screams are horror

When all is lost
And you feel only pain
Live like a stupid king
In swamp full of shame

Horroble [x7]
How do you! live the lies?
Horroble [x7]
How do you refuse the wise?
Horroble [x7]
Do I have to speak in tongues?
Horroble [x7]

Look in to the moon do you see in the sky,
the devils ride tonight
When you live by their rules and die like the rest,
this we Never Never
A wink from the crow when you walk on by,
connection to the horroble
A kiss from the Tongue of a full fledged zombie,
horror its horroble

When you wake
Things will have changed
I will have died
Only to be reborn

Embraced by the dark
And in league with the sign.
