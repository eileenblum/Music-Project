(breathing) the cold air
(haunting) like nightmare
(feeding) frenzy bloodbath

(lurking) in shadows
(loving) a heartbeat
(quenching) a long lost lovely

Let me loose, I can't stop me
(lycanthropy)
Need to feed, so hungry
(lycanthropy)
Feels so good, but so thirsty
(lycanthropy)
Hurts so bad, in my blood
(lycanthropy)

(surrounded) by nightmare
(haunted) by night air
(feeding) frenzy blood bath

(lusting) hot pulse
(loving) the shadows
(teasing) a well known fever
