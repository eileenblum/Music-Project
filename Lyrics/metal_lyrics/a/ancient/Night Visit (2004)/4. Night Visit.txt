Alone and freezing
Another bleak and rainy night
holds you captured here
Pondering and searching for sense
Why he left for the other side

Eyes, now from the past
Burn your mind, so fast

That which is somewhat dead
May still reach out
Scared, and assailed by the dead,
The spirit of the one, appears again

I am still bleeding!
The sands of time, are killing me again

Night visit!
From far beyond
Tonight he will visit!
And turn your life around

"Unwake, you will meet me again"
"I will go through the tunnel"
"If u let me enter, I will return"
"But shut me out in fear,
and your soul will BURN!"

I am still bleeding!
My soul is still alive!

Night visit!
From far beyond
Tonight he will visit!
And there's no way around

Tonight he will visit
He'll leave his hole,
In the ground.
