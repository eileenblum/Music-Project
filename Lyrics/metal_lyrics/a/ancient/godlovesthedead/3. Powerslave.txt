[Iron Maiden cover]

Into the abyss I'll fall - the eye of Horus
Into the eyes of the night - watching me go
Green is the cat's eye that glows - in this temple
Enter the risen Osiris - risen again

Tell me why I had to be a powerslave
I don't wanna die, I'm a god,
why can't I live on?
When the Life Giver dies,
All around is laid to waste
And in my last hour,
I'm a slave to the power of death

When I was living this lie - fear was my game
People would worship and fall-drop to their knees
So bring me the blood and red wine
For the one to succeed me
For he is a man and a god
And he will die too.

Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins
Silent the terror that reigned - marbled in stone
Shell of a man God preserved - a thousand ages
But open the gates of my hell
I will strike from the grave
