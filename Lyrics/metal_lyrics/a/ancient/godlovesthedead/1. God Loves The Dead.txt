Black Face, White hands, Bloody Tears
White Face, Bloody Hands, Holy Eyes

Die Die Die Die Die Die Die Die

I'll Rape Your Thoughtless Mind
I'll Taste Your Bleached White Soul
Bleed, You Foolish Heart
And Sterilize Your Tainted Seed

Help To Die The Plague Is You
Time, Time Join Me And Tear Them All To Shreds

You're Gone Dead But Still Here
A Lifeless Stare That No One Can Save
I Am God, God Of Your World
Holy Hell, You'd Better Obey

Hail Furor Hail
Their Life Bewilders Me
Hail Furor Hail
Only Once Make Them Think Like Me

Die Bastard Die
You Fucked Up Yourself, Stay Away From Me
Die Fucker Die
You Gave Up Your Life, Don't Cry To Me

Die Die Die Die Die Die Die Die

I'll Rape Your Thoughtless Mind
I'll Taste Your Bleached White Soul
Bleed, You Foolish Heart
And Sterilize Your Tainted Seed

Kill For Me
Bleed For Me
Suffer For Me
Worship Me
Die For Me, Die For Me, Die For Me, Die For Me
