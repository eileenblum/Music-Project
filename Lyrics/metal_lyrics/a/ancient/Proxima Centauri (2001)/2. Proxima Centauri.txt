[Music: Aphazel - Lyrics: GroM]

by foreign shores we tread our way
no clue of what's beyond
a lurking threat unknown to man
an ancient force of prey

through time and space we travel on
our curious natures grow
an evil dark and frightening place
where no man should dare to go

ave aquevale for the neptune towers subside

we unlock doors unprepared
to face the horrors far beyond
as feeble speaks of dust
we boldly linger on and on

our souls will burn with flames so high
and vanquished we will be
for we are merely strangers
in this void of misery

cruched and butchered drained and slayed
our souls forever scream
engulfed and severed, tortured and maimed
with no hope to be free

anghuishly crying no able of dying
a curse no one can tell
forever standed and abandoned
our souls will burn in hell

liberate tute meex infernis

we hear our cries we know our lies
the punishment is due

beware and fear that which is near
and face the world's demise demise

so far yet close this hidden evil
a scythe reaping souls
a breading unportrayable death
will swallow all mankind

we have not seen the face of death
and hell is just a word
the truth is far much worse and vile
our existence too absurd

the fatal verge of no return
now breached beyond restraint

how many times must our souls cry
before we finally learn
we face what power is out of reach
until we crash and burn

a warning's given us
remain on our home soil
for furious proxima centauri
will shred this mortal coil

shred this coil

shred this coil
