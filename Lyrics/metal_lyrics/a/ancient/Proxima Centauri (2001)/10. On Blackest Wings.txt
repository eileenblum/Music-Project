[Music: Aphazel - Lyrics: Deadly Kristin]

I saw your face one thousand times in my dreams
his mark clearly shown with eyes like burning coals

like the demon goat
on blackest wings

oh your sight pierces me
oh your sight is fire on my skin

like the demon goat
on blackest wings

evil doll you're the one to be chosen
thy master awaits thee
and will crown you with needles in blood

like a devil whore
my body was oiled with fresh blood
a penetrating stench drying sticky on me
before my eyes he appeared
his head covered with a real goat mask

evil your presence excites me
evil your body enlusts me

evil your presence excites me
evil your body enlusts me

my horns dominate this realm of bags of flesh
my body is ready to fuck the demon goat

the sky turned black and the came
on blackest wings
