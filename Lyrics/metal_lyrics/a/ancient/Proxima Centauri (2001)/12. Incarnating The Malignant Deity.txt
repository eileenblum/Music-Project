[Music &amp; Lyrics: Aphazel]

prodigious forces of rage and entropy
buried in golden seas under lost horizons
a black hearted creature has now awakened
and begins to claim his ground

from the borden of the earth
secrets cames and rising

with dragon eyes of the deepest red
the patron deity on the fated land
reveals a hunger for vengeance and command
the lord of the northern sky regains control

god of storms hail
the ceaseless one hail
god of war hail
the final one hail

the gruesome creature was rising from the horizon
bringing forth his winds

nineteenth dynasty a roaring sky in fury
the storms now sing his name

the thunder god is back bringing forth
a vast force of ancient plagues
and pandemonium
