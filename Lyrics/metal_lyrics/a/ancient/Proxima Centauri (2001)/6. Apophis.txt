[Music: Aphazel / GroM - Lyrics: Aphazel]

another perilous ride through the underworld
another fiery night in the heart of hell

another battle against the blinding light
another chance to slay and burn
the weak defender of the sun

you weak defender

out of the darkness perpetual
the serpent god threatens
the cosmic order

you ride through my lands
unaware of the powers here within
I tell you beware
cause a gruesome doom awaits you

one dreary night with universe in hand
you'll see me strike and swallow
you ghastly light

light you ghastly light
