[Music &amp; Lyrics : Jesus Christ !]

up from grave
I come to break the spell

slept with corpses scraped
dry blood from veins

dark clouds above shadow hallow
deranged insane my hate my pain
her my footsteps taking your breath
feel my fingers gripping your neck

taste my fury dead and bury
don't you worry you're so pretty

the witch my love I come again to take you home
the witch that I care it's time again that we go home

draped in sheets of blood
so beautiful so beautiful my love

together again forever again
together again forever again

the witch you raised me from the dead
the witch that gave me blood again
the witch we are one again

together we begin again

the witch you raised me from the dead
the witch that gave me blood again
the witch we are one again
the witch again
we again
