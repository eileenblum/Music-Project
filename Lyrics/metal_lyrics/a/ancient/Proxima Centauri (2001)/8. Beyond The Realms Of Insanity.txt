[Music &amp; Lyrics : Aphazel]

awakening in another realm
in a distant time and place
beyond the known world

shricking voices calling out
to the neverending emptiness

a shining figure is coming out
of the sea of mist that now surrounds me

reveals a woman pale
yet blacker than the darkest night
with eyes of diamonds piercing through my soul

i'm your saving angel in black
surrender to my force
cause I am the only one
who hold they keys to your mind

the journey to the realm
of the mentally dead begins

in a twisted dimension
where the sky is forever bleeding
and the seas are burning with fury

like a dragons wrath

you're in the claws of death
sucking out your every force
your heart and soul have died
you now belong to my realm

beyond the realms of insanity
she rules the realm of the raptured minds

beyond the realms of insanity
she rules the realm of the raptured minds
