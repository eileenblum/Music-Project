[performed by Altars of Grief]Open yourself to me
Consumed by my misery
Your blackened wings unfurled
And the ashes fell like snow
The ghosts that reside in this place
A reminder of the life that we shared
In you, I saw reflections of a cold, winter day
Where the sun refused to shine

These years have stolen everything from me
But, time can not claim your memory

Time can't take your memory from me

In dying light
I'll carry this weight
In dying light
I'll see your ghost again

The future holds nothing for me
Trapped in the darkness, alone
Tired eyes, cursed to wake to another day
Slipping further down into despair
