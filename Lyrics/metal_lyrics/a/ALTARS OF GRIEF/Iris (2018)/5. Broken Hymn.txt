With every passing day
I've endured my mistakes
And cursed the failing light
That is should forever fade
I stand now in the ashes
Of a world become a tomb
Every thought, another grave
Interred with memories of you

Bury me in my agony
Drown me underneath all that I've lost

I've grown tired of the light
Of holding on to ghosts
And longing for lost days
I'm faced with my failures
When I close my eyes
I'll pray for all of this to end

Lowered down
Into the waiting Earth
A veil of soil
Concealing your pain
One day
I can only pray
That time corrodes
This memory of you

Cast away
From this grey world
Into oblivion
And constellations
Take this Earth
From beneath me
"Iris!"
"Please, come back to me!"

"Come back to me!"

I've grown tired of the light
Of holding on to ghosts
And, longing for lost days
I'm faced with my failures
When I close my eyes
I'll pray for all of this to end
