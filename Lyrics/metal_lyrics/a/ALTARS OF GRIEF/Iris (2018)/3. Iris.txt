Here I stand, head in hands
Questions unanswered
Do you hear my words?
This altar, veiled in dust
So long I've poured my faith
Still, you have failed her

Or, am I just blind and powerless?
Cursed with this need to escape my reality
I fall to my knees as she appears
Iris, stained with blood

Fall
(No life left in her eyes)
Close your eyes
(Nothing I could do)
Nothing inside
(How could you turn away?)
Turn away
(Embrace this)
Embrace finality

"My God!
I'll see the Heaven's burn!
I'll never forgive you for this!"

As her cries subside
No sound broke the still
Silence is all that remains
Within these walls
I now see clear
I was always alone

Am I just blind and powerless?
Cursed with this need to escape my reality
Forgotten, as I've forgotten you
I'll never let you take from me again
