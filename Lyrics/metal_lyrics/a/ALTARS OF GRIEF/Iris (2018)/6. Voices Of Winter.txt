Years have gone
I hide behind a face
That's not my own
Can no one hear me?
The night is long
It mocks my weary faith
I am alone
My god, why have you gone?

Voices of winter
Beckon me forward
Your words are ghosts
That haunt the frozen air
A fragile beacon that shines
Through this bleak nightmare

Restless hours
In tranquil decay
I wander the desolation
Where only ashes remain
This place once familiar
Is now long forgotten
Derelict arms reach out
In desperation

Buried alive
In the graves I have made
All that I know
Is this reverie

A vision of pale limbs
Frozen forever
Statuesque, as you
A monument to failure

This gathering darkness
Shall never depart
The misery of bereavement
Consuming my thoughts
This bitter season
Becomes my prison
Rending my heart
All hope departs

Buried alive
In the graves I have made
All that I knowâ¦
