Crestfallen
Two souls became one
A vestige of serenity
Grasping your cross
Reaching out
With your final breath
A life departed
Frozen and still

In this silence, I know
That you have found your peace
The embrace of falling snow
I brush the tears from your face
I no longer remember
When the world didn't feel so cold
I lift my arms for the sky
And await this coming storm

Empyreal flames
Of my own creation
I will wait forever
For my salvation
Before I surrender
My faith unto you
You who has taken
Everything from me

Winter descends
Like ashes from the divine
Breathe in the fire
Let it swallow you whole
Close your eyes
I know I have failed you
Child of light
Go now, your heaven awaits

Empyreal flames
Of my own creation
I will wait forever
For my salvation

Before I surrender

My faith unto you

You who has taken

Everything
