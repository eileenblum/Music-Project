Waiting for the end again
The time has come to pass, my friend
Waiting for this final judgement
Iâve never felt this close to God

I can barely see the sun
I guess this path was truly flawed
Judgement comes with revelation
And, Iâve never felt so close to God

Waiting for the end again
Waiting for the end again
Waiting for the end again
Waiting for the end

Waiting for the end again

The time has come to pass, my friend

Judgement comes with revelation

Iâve never felt this close to God
