I opened my eyes
To the night sky
The unending storm
Revealed itself before me
Weightless in my resolve
But, still a burden remains
With this final breath
"Please, forgive me"

With every wasted prayer
I've watched your body wither
I've seen what you've become
As you pushed me away

Consumed by my pride
I fled from your side
And tried to understand
Your faith in this wretched world
That has condemned you
The lights of home have faded
Into desolation
I gave you all that I had
Your faith in this godless world
Has lead you astray

I opened my eyes
To a sky in flames
A cold wind lamenting
Through the unending plains
Within the frozen wreckage
Is where I shall remain
But, with this departure
I'll be with you once again

I opened my eyes!
I opened my eyes!
I opened my eyes!
I opened my eyes!
