You arrive with grace
To quell the distance
Pull me into your ethereal skin
In your arms the world will fall away

As if I alone could carry this weight

In your eyes
I burn in my reflection
You move through my veins
And light the cold, endless night

Sightless, I cry out for you to carry me back

In your eyes
I burn in my reflection
In your arms
I stand alone in ruin

Amidst the ashes of my thoughts
And the silence of my decay

I alone cannot bear the weight of my own imminent collapse

I alone cannot bear the weight of my own failure
