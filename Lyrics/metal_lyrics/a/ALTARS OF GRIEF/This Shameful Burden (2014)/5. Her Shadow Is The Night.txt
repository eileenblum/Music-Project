Your death-white face haunts me still
In these endless nights where no dreams dwell
Held down beneath the surface, I watched the light leave your eyes
Fading, further down, into the gloom

I will drown in my grief, as you did
In these deathless nights my torment brings
I have lost my faith in these cold skies above
What God could ever forgive what I've done to you?

I am disgraced
Broken and wretched
Unable to face
What I have become
Hours in silence
Pry open old wounds

Her breathless body
Pale flesh
In the depths of a memory
Where she met with death
Please help me, oh Lord
Help me carry this weight
I see her face when I close my eyes
Her shadow is the night
Please God, don't leave me
Don't leave me alone
Cold, dead hands
Pry open old wounds
The blackness buries me
As time depletes
Oh God, what have I done?
What have I done?
