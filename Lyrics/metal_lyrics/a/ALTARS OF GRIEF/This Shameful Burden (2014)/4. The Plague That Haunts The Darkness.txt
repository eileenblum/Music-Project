I hide my body away from the day
Flesh and bone scattered on the frozen wind
Desperate to hold every piece in place
As the sunlight consumes me

Awoken by a voice
Scraping at my skin
A storm of hunger and ecstasy
Awaiting the nights cold embrace
The moon hangs silent, shrouded in mist
Carrier of pestilence, harbinger of dread
I arrive in a haze of bloody delirium
I am the plague that haunts the darkness

Into the vastness of the abyss
Free from the weight of your suffering
Swallowed up by my hatred and the blood-stained earth
The silence is broken
Crawl out from the void
That has stripped you of your faith
Your god has abandoned you, my child
In blackness, forever
Never again
Never again to feel the sun
Cursed to exist in isolation
A deathless disgrace
Within your loathsome tomb
In the throes of solitude
Withered from famine
This night, gods children will suffer

She lay still
Naked in death, for all to behold
When all hope disappears
The light won't find her here

Awoken by a voice
Scraping at my skin
A storm of hunger and ecstasy
Awaiting the nights cold embrace
The moon hangs silent, shrouded in mist
Carrier of pestilence, harbinger of dread
I arrive in a haze of bloody delirium
I am the plague that haunts the darkness
