Far...
Far from here is all you said
There is nothing left inside
Nothing left alive
There is no fucking hope

I sit and stare
As these grey walls close in
Endlessly suffer
To merely exist

There is nothing else here
But, lost words left to decay
As another grain falls
We latch on desperately
All of our dreams, all we hold dear
It all goes away
We carry only our scars
Alone, to our graves

In our most broken days
Will we find the strength to stand
Or take the path of finality
To lay beneath the altars of our grief

I sit and stare
As these grey walls close in
Endlessly suffer
To merely exist
