A dim light peers in
Illuminating
The bruises that you hide
I've chosen not to see
You crawl to me
Eyes bearing distant fire
I feel my world collapse with every exhale

Your skin is cold
Scarred, but perfect
This shameful burden
Is mine alone
Your stare burns right through me
Revealing every lie
Your fragile beauty hides such a callous smile

What have I become?
Entombed within myself
The wreckage of our hearts
Is tearing me down

As you stand before me
I see what we've become
The wreckage of our hearts
And all the lies undone
A dim light peers in
Illuminating
My hands around your throat
This burden is mine alone

What have I become?
Entombed within myself
The wreckage of our hearts
Is forcing me...

The light is fading
The walls are closing in
This burden is mine alone!
Your stare burns right through me
Until your dying breath
This shameful burden is mine alone!
