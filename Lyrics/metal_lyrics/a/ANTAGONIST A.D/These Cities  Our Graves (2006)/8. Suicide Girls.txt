Cold skin to shaking lip.
She is a shell for you.
To be beautiful is to be raped... By love?
Just a lifeless longing for touch.
Screaming and clawing for more.
With those 523940 eyes.
She thinks its love.
And in those m12 amethyst lips.
She thinks its love.
As you caress her cold body.
Shes shaking.
Shes empty.
Just another shell for you.
Fucking magician.
Fucking mind control.
Cold skin.
In all its beautiful lust.
Cold skin.
You stole her innocence.
You stole her beauty.
She is empty.
You clawed out her eyes
