Hollywood is the rotting heart of a decaying nation.
And this heart wont stop beating until we burn it down.
Silhouettes, streetlights your selling yourself.
Just distractions.
You weak motherfuckers your living your life on your knees.
You weak motherfuckers.
Modern culture is a disease.
You ain't living your just killing.
You ain't living your just consuming.
Hollywood is the rotting heart of a diseased population.
And this heart wont stop infecting until we burn it down.
And this heart wont stop beating until we burn this city to the ground
