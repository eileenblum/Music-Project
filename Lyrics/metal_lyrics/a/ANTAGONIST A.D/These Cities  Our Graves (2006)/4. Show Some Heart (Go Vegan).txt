The weak are getting weaker.
And the youth are dead or pacified.
Your living your tv dream.
While the innocent are bred to die...
I'll take a stand for those who cant.
I'll scream for those who cant speak.
Caged and slaughtered.
A life of misery.
Just to line the pockets of rich companies.
While we suck at the hand of media and corporations.
We grow fat and sedated.
We kill and destroy...
Our life is over consumption.
Go vegan
