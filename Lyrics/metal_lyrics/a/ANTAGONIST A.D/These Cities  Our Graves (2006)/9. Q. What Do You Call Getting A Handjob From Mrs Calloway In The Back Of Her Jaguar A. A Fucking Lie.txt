All innocence is dead...
You can't lift your head.
Don't act so proud.
With your forked tongue spitting out my life.
A sitcom vulture.
Preying on peoples lives.
Like you had the higher ground?
Your life is a soap opera praising apathy.
Masturbating over fantasies.
Not one word.
We'll tear your throat out.
Cut you open to find there is nothing left inside.
Your empty.
No more words.
We'll tear your throat out.
Leave you speechless forever
