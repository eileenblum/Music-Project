No real love to be felt, no true romance can be held,
when a life is measured in the accumulation of wealth!
I HAVE LEARNT!
A cold heart cannot emit warmth and a poisened mind cannot be cured!

What glory will you hold? When these lies are exposed?
Nothing gold will stay - we must find a better way!

So why won't you learn your lessons and teach them to your sons and daughters?
So this societal cancer, these poisened minds don't move further!
Why is it unreasonable to suggest an alternative sustainable future?
Where the lives we live are stronger!

What glory will you hold? When these lies are exposed?
Nothing gold will stay - we must find a better way!

Because the vultures still live!
Because the ignorant still teach!
Because the blind man still claims he sees!

Nothing gold will stay! We find a better way!
Nothing gold will stay! We find a better way!
