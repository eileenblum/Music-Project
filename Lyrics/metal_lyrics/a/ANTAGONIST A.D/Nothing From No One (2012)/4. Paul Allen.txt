I feel nothing from no one, share no empathy!
But I got some problems, eating away at my sanity!
I feel nothing from no one, share no empathy!
But I got some problems, eating away at my sanity!

Just another lost soul, spinning out of control.
Don't tell me what I already know!
An endless cycle, a downward spiral!
An endless cycle, a downward spiral!

Don't stop to think, we're out of control..
You feel hollow, a hunger that just won't see an end,
no amount of water will quench..
You feel hollow, a hunter that just won't see an end,
no amount of money that you can spend..

The failings of our social environment, becoming all to apparent..
These foundations that house our sanity, will shake and..
SPLIT! SPLIT! SPLIT! SPLIT!
And I think my mask is about to..
SLIP! SLIP! SLIP! SLIP!
Don't tell me..

I'm just another lost soul, spinning out of control.
Don't tell me what I already know!
An endless cycle, a downward spiral!
An endless cycle, a downward spiral!

Can't tell you how to untangle a web..
Spun so well! Spun so well!
Can't tell you how!
