I stand here, not one but with the strength of a million,
hear their voices echo every word!
We need the world to see themselves through our eyes,
to see the poison, to see through the lies.

And I said it before - and I'll scream it again,
and I said it before - and I'll scream it again!
I'll take a stand for those who can't,
and I'll scream for those who can't speak!
I'll take a stand for those who can't,
and I'll scream for those who can't speak!
Can you hear me?
Can you feel me?

I stand here not one but with the strength of a million,
hear their voices echo every word.
We need the world to see themselves through our eyes,
to see the poison, to see through the lies.

Do you feel the guilt? Do you?
Do you feel the guilt? Do you?

Show.. Show some heart!
Show.. Show some heart!

And I said it before - and I'll scream it again,
I'll take a stand for those who can't,
and I'll scream for those who can't speak!
