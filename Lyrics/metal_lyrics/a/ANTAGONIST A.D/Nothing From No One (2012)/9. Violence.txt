I wonder how we can not react with violence and pure hate,
when that's all we've ever been shown, when it's all we have ever known?
And I wonder if one day when the shackles are broken,
if the masters will see mercy, when mercy is unknown?

How?
When no mercy has been shown..
HOW DO I SEE?
With this black cloud surrounding me!
HOW CAN I FEEL?
Love when it's drowned in misery..

To awake a mind that's only been taught to sleep? - Give me relief!
And I fucking hate this negative shit!
Possessed and consumed by every thought unsavory. - Show me clarity!
And I fucking hate this negative shit!

And I'm sick of staring at the tongues in your fucking cheeks,
and I'm sick of everyday being so god damned fucking grey!

Come at me! Come at me! Come at me!
I'll open a mind blinded by negativity!
Show me release, to awake a mind that's only been taught to sleep? - Give me relief!
And I fucking hate this negative shit!
Possessed and consumed by every thought unsavory. - Show me clarity!
And I fucking hate this negative shit!

HOW DO I SEE?
With this black cloud surrounding me!
HOW CAN I FEEL?
Love when it's drowned in misery..

And I wonder if one day when shackles are broken,
if the masters will see mercy - when mercy is unknown.
