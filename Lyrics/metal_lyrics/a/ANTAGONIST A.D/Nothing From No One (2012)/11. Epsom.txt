I live a life of spite!

We are all diseased, a cancer, rotting in these concrete tombs!
We built the cages, we joined the chains!
Now we lie motionless..
THESE CITIES - OUR GRAVES!

Like the crosses cemented to the hillside,
still dated but here after all this time.
A reminder of a disease that still flows like blood through these streets!

Please believe you're apart of this, we can make a difference!
I don't blame the symptoms, I blame the cause!
And it's in our foundations, in lines these halls!
I don't blame the symptoms, I blame the disease!
It's blinding, it's deafening! APATHY!

Murderer, how can you sleep?
Parasite, dancing on our asphalt graves..
Blind eye turn black, taste burnt away, no sour taste in..
THESE CITIES, OUR GRAVES!

Like the crosses cemented to the hillside,
still dated but here after all this time.
A reminder of a disease that still flows like blood through these streets!

Please believe you're apart of this, we can make a difference!
I don't blame the symptoms, I blame the cause!
And it's in our foundations, in lines these halls!
I don't blame the symptoms, I blame the disease!
It's blinding, it's deafening! APATHY!

I'm not looking for a scapegoat, I'm as guilty as anyone else,
but at least I'm fucking trying..
"At least I'm fucking trying!"
I made my choices and I still believe in a life lived standing..

I live a life of spite!
So let it rain on me!
So let it rain on me!

So let it rain on me!
