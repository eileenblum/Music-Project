This is where my mind escapes - to you I can't relate!
This is where my mind escapes - to you I can't relate!
I can't relate!

Blind eyes burnt black, taste torn away!
A bitter taste? Oh how I pray..
To mask that stench you create.
That black hole! The weight of it's gravity.

This is where my mind escapes - to you I can't relate!

The slow burn, the pull of negativity.
I stare through you, so paper thin, with your paper skin!
Whispered words only fall on deaf ears,
sticks and stones, I'm at peace with all my fears!

This is where my mind escapes - to you I can't relate!

Blind eyes burnt black, taste torn away!
Old friend, how did we get to this day?
Hater tell me, what the fuck do you have left?
Skin and bones - where is all your flesh?

Where is all your flesh?!
Where is all your flesh?!

Trust me as I swear, black and blue, that this song is about you!

Where is all your flesh?!
