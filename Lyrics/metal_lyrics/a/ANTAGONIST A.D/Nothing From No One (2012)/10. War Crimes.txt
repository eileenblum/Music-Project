Speak to me kid - tell me what you see.
The reflection of this worlds pain &amp; misery?
Look into these eyes - tell me what you see.
Can you feel the pain?
Can you feel the gravity?

Look into yourself - tell me what you see.
Are you the answer?
Are you the problem?

Every single one of you, is fucking guilty!

For crimes against this world!
Can you taste it? Can you taste it?
The blood in your fucking mouth!
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
The weight of a thousand lifes!
What can you tell me to justify?

I can see your weak, you need to lie to yourself.
The tongue in your cheek, I'll make a martyr of you!
I see your weak!
Can you tell me why thousands die? I see your weak!
To satisfy an unwarranted way of life? I see your weak!
Can you tell me why? Can you tell me why?

Speak to me kid - tell me what you see.

Can you taste it? Can you taste it?
The blood in your fucking mouth!
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
The weight of a thousand lifes!
What can you tell me to justify?
