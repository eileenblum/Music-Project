I feel your eyes on me!
Hear your voices speaking my name - DOUBT!
Sinks in those daggers dig so deep man,
so deep, I can't explain!
What happened to that thick skin? That kept my sanity in..
Now I'm just wasting away, bright eyes fading fast!
I am always at my ends, always at my ends!

So when did I make the time to dig a ditch so big that oceans surround me?
That's how far I feel from reality..
You might look at me and think:
He's just not there!

He's just not there! He's just not there!
He's just not there! He's just not there!

And I stare at myself, staring at you, and I just don't care,
because I'm not there.. no!

I'm miles away, an ocean away!
For all of those lost inside,
you know the true power of your mind!

That the nightmare is when you're awake,
and sleep is the only escape - the world is cold and every crowded street you are alone,
blinded by eyes and judging thoughts, silenced by others words..
The world is cold and every crowded street you are alone.

Whiles others fight for attention, and fight for the centre stage,
we slip back, we fade away.

And so we fight - and we win!
