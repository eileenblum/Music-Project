It's funny to think, I penned such sweet words for you,
that I shed tears and felt real pain for you!
It's funny to think that I felt anything at all..
Now I only see a rusted anchor, you've got no soul!

And I need to tell you that, I wasted some good years under your spell!
And I need to tell you that, I was living hell!
And I'd be lying if I said, I could EVER miss you!

I swore that night you'd always be in my heart - nothing could ever tear us apart.. nothing!

And I saved you once, and I saved you twice,
stitched sliced wrists, picked you up off the floor!
Smashed that bottle that I told you to ignore..
I told you to ignore!

BROKEN EVERY VOW THAT YOU SAID TO ME!
LOVESICK!
BROKEN EVERY VOW THAT YOU SAID TO ME!
LOVESICK!

And now you wonder why I can't look you in the eye?
Because I know what I don't wanna know..
And I don't wanna know! And I don't wanna know!
How many beds you've warmed, how much flesh you've turned..
And I don't wanna know! And I don't wanna know!
How many sheets you've crawled, how many lives you've soiled..
And I don't wanna know! And I don't wanna know!

And it's funny to think, I shared anything with you!
And I regret every second I wasted on you!
And I wish for nothing, but desert and walls between us!
It's not that I hate you - I've just lost all respect..
LOVESICK!

And now you wonder why I can't look you in the eye?
LOVESICK!
And now you wonder why I can't look you in the eye?
LOVESICK!
