I see your mind is sick and your body is slow!
Friend tell me now - where do we go?
I just don't know! I just don't know!

Am I the only one who doesn't share the disease?
Am I the only man who hasn't drowned in apathy?

And I feel fucked up - feel like everyone's shouting!
No home for the homesick man. I've got nowhere to go!
I'm trapped by these fucking walls..
If I didn't burn these bridges - I'd cross them all!
This will mean nothing to any of you..

AND I DON'T GIVE A FUCK!
I just want to see it all burn!

"We are the lost children of a lost generation",
because it sounds so fucking cool,
to say "WE ARE NOTHING FROM NO ONE"!
The apathetic wastes,
who care more for labels than faces - fucking disgraces!

So where do you turn, when the lights are getting low?
I sing this from the heart and you would never know,
and I don't want you too..
Because I DON'T GIVE A FUCK, ANYMORE!
I just want to watch it burn!
Let's see the world burn..
Let's see the world burn!
Let's see the world burn
