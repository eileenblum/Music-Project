I used to be a better man, 
But these years have seen me fall.
I held the taste of glory and pride. 
But that life has gone, sour in the sun.
Days are shorter, nights are too damn long.
Now the bitter taste of failure sits on my tongue, 
Full of cliches, full of shit.
But I like the way the sky shines, 
When you look it through open eyes.
I like the wya the city burns, 
When you see the flames of freedom spark.
I still am, that better man 
And these years have seen me tested,
I still hold the taste of floury and pride, 
My beliefs are strong
They shine with the sun, 
Still full of cliches, still full of shit.
I know now, the colour of regret, 
Its blood red (I'm blood red), 
I guess I'm better for it.
