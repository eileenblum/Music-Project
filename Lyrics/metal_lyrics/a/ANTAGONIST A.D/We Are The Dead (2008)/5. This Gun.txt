This gun is resting against my head, 
I'd sooner pull the trigger than hear your voice again, 
I'd rather be dead.
You talk, you fucking scream right through me. 
Nothing but fear and silence is all I hear. 
Its all I hear, its all I fucking hear.
One thousand cliches could never describe your ignorance. 
You ain't fighting for difference, 
You're just clinging to an old tradition, 
That you don't even understand.
You are scared of change.
