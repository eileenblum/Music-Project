As innocent life is born. 
Behind locked foors and concrete walls.
It's injected with poisons. 
Eyes melt, skin burns.
It cries and it bleeds. 
Until finally, finally it breaks. 
I can feel the misery, 
I can feel the cold in your heart
No compassion, no love. 
You're stunning, you're beautiful
You would kill for attention
What will it take to cure your apathy? 
500 deaths a day for your beauty.
Where is the science? 
There is no benefit, 
Only fraud and mass murder.
It's blood is statistics, 
But smells of burning flesh.
Just a haze of blood and shit. 
I will stop at nothing to make this right.
Got to find a way to set this world free.
To set their world free.
