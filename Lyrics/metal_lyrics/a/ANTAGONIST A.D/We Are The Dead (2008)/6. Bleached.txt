Living with the feeling that you are never good enough, 
Haunted by your mistakes,
No substance can erase that bitter taste (although we try)
Never feeling, that what you have is enough. 
Stuck in the heart of this parasite,
As it pushes the sides out to die. 
Concrete falls apart &amp; cultures are left to rot on the outside.
Always wanting something more, always asking why, 
The powers that be are trying to create a one world homogenized society.
The constant removal of variety in other cultures &amp; people.
I feel like I don't belong, constantly fighting demons on the inside.
Constantly fighting the self doubt this culture grew inside of me.
Life is nothing I saw on tv, I don't see the happy ending.
