I've watched the sunset on this western paradise.
I've seen the faded edges, witnessed the lights burn out.
Now the world is freezing, and it is fucking dark
The blood red tide is rising and there's no high ground.
Arms bound and legs shaking, we can't kick to save ourselves.
The faint flow of burning flags sends shivers down our spines, 
This is what we fought for?
A desolate wasteland, raped and scorched.
The waters will rise, to wash away the filth, 
But the blood they spill will never match their guilt.
Once stood a shimmering city, full of soulless sheep, 
Under mountains of concrete that pierced the sky.
The privileged kissed the stars and we kissed their feet, 
But now this city build on sand has finally sunk beneath 
And now we swim like sharks through the roughest of seas,
Trying to salvage the shipwreck of humanity
