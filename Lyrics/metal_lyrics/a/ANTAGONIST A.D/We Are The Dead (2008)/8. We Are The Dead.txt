A world built on fear and flesh. 
With x's on eyes, we sit complacent.
These burning lights they blind our eyes. 
Thirsts are quenched from our veins turned rivers.
I beg to question, what makes you different?
I beg to question, what you do for difference?
You are alive, open your eyes. 
You are alive, open you eyes.
So who wants to be so pathetic 
That they spend their final days 
Bathing in their own self pity?
Now's the time for our actions 
To speak louder than our words. 
Let the silence end, here and now.
We are alive.
