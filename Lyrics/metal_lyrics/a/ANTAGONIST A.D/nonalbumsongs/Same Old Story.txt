Keep talking that same old shit,
Keep talking that same old, same old
Keep talking that same old shit,
We pray you will never get over it.

I look around &amp; only see weak &amp; awkward.
Those foals those prey struggling to stand on their own feet
&amp; we the predators we don't fucking eat don't fucking drink
from the well we dug &amp; the crops we seed

The maimed &amp; ailing drink our wealth
No trophy fucks no reprieve from this hell
Burning passion &amp; sincere intention - now we too must suffer?

We dragged, we dug, we fucking forged.
this is nothing i wanted, nothing worth fighting for!!

this roof will rust, this floor will sink
praise defeat, just praise defeat
bridges buckled, there tongues will dry
praise defeat, you just praise defeat
we are so fucking hungry, we are so unfed
praise defeat you just praise defeat

you just praise defeat

Keep talking that same old shit,
Keep talking that same old, same old
Keep talking that same old shit,
We pray you will never get over it.

One day this will all be yours, infertile lands &amp; crumbling walls.
