No home for the homesick.
No home, no home

Machinery is not complete - 
no more sparks, no more heat
Rotting with the dead trees, 
cash flows spike with no bodies to freeze.
Wills that spin factory cogs are no more true - 
only rusted, only broken, only few.
Stained stainless steel no longer reflects -
no self, no home, just a place I left.. no home, no home.
