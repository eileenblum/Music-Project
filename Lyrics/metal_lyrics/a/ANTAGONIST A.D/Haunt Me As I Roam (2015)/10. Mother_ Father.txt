Mother, father what have I done? Where is your quiet son? what has he become?
Stuck inside these walls
Stare through the windows into my soul
Just tell it where to go.
It's got no hope - it's got no home.
I've made some mistakes and I've burnt all of you
I've made some poor decisions and I've hurt all of you
I am I am I am - the same inside but those actions will haunt me until i die
Not afraid to say I lost my way. Walked this path for too long. Am I better off? Am I worse? No regrets just some sad fucking songs.
I'm afraid. I lost. I am worse
No regret. No cure. I accept this curse

Mother, father what have I done?
Where is your quiet son? what has he become? Mother? Father?

(Explanation - We all make mistakes. The only real mistake you can make is not learning and growing from what you have experienced.)
