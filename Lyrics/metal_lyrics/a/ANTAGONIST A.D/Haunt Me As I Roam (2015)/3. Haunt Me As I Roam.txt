[feat. Ahren Stringer]I saw your ghost it was calling out for me. Do you know where it goes at night because it always come to me

I saw your ghost it was calling out for me. Do you know where it goes at night

Because it always comes to me
The world turns and I'll forever mourn

And I'm sorry that I wasn't the closest
And I'm sorry but I always cared
I could see this coming a mile away
Didn't do enough to show you another way

I loved you before
I love you still
I always will
Haunt me as I roam

And I can't sleep some nights when I see your face
Just to know a life can be lost and just slip away

You were fucked up when I saw you and I don't know if you ever knew
You were fucked up when I saw you but my words to you forever ring true

I loved you before
I love you still
I always will
Haunt me as I roam

Sometimes those feelings affect me. Like I never could grasp the reality of when you left me and that's selfish to say because you left us all when you took your life away.

Haunt me as I roam

You needed something to something to hold on to
