I can give and I can run until there is nothing left and then at my end what solace will appear? What should I expect? Broken and a mess. Cliche words but fit my profile best.
I feel sorry for those who have wrung these words so there's no colours left because you can't climb the mountain when the truth comes crashing down on you.
I can live and I can love until there is nothing left and then at my end I wonder if my solace will appear.
I hate this world that I see today.
But I still know it can be beautiful in every way
We all have ugly days
I hate this world that I see today
But I still know it can be beautiful in every way
Do you know what it's like to be bested
Have you lost have you fought &amp; not won
Do you know what it's like to be tested
Do you know what it's like to overcome
I can fake and I can hate until there is nothing left and then at my end what solace will appear?
What should I expect? Broken and a mess. Cliche words that crush my fucking chest.
I hate this world that I see today.
But I still know it can beautiful in every way.
We all have ugly days.
I hate this world that I see today
But I still know it can be beautiful in every way.
We all have ugly days.
