You dig a hole. 5 days a week.
So you can sleep at night, So you can sleep?
Carry the burden, carry the weight
It will drown you one day
And then you'll sleep forever
And your body will rot
The years will bury your name and over time you'll be forgotten
Carry the burden, carry the weight
It will drown you one day
Oh it's hard to see a good hearted kid running scared
Running scared with a tail between their legs going back
Going back on every single thing that they ever said
Fuck that I'd rather be dead
Than be afraid to live
Than to be a coward going back on every single thing that they ever said
I'd rather be dead.
You dig a hole.
5 days a week.
so you can sleep at night, So you can sleep?
Carry the burden, carry the weight

Oh it's hard to see a good hearted kid running scared
Running scared with a tail between their legs going back
Going back on every single thing that they ever said
Fuck that I'd rather be dead
You won't get to quench the greed
You won't get to justify the want with the need
You won't get to live beyond your means
Six feet deep
Your body will rot
Coffin keeper
No one will remember your name

(Explanation-
Life is so short. If working an office job or the counter at some fast food place makes you happy then you're doing it right. You shouldn't have to count down the hours waiting to die behind a desk or a power tool if you don't want to be there. Find something you love, be the best you can be at it and most of all be happy.)
