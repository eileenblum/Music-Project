I guess theres too much of you in my veins &amp; it's slowly starting to shut me down.
Give me a reason to breath
Give me a reason to think clearly
Tell me why I shouldn't leave
Tell me why I shouldn't wander endlessly
&amp; it's slowly starting to shut me down.
Ive been thinking I've been thinking about this too long and I've been going about this all too wrong.
Never knew what to say or what to do to voice these thoughts the best to you.
When I wake up I feel sick.
There is no end to this. There is no end.
I guess theres too much of you in my veins &amp; it's slowly starting to shut me down.
Give me a reason to breathe
Give me a reason to think clearly
Tell me why I shouldn't leave tell me why I shouldn't wander endlessly
Nothing worth keeping comes that easy,
This pain this world won't defeat me
Never knew what to say or what to do
To voice these thoughts the best to you.
When I wake up I feel sick.
There is no end to this.
I guess theres too much of you in my veins &amp; it's slowly starting to shut me down.
Give me a reason to breathe
Give me a reason to think clearly
Tell me why I shouldn't leave tell me why I shouldn't wander endlessly
When I Wake I feel sick
There Is No End to this
