The sun is shining but your blood runs cold, there is a chill in your bones.
And you would swear there is a hole where your heart is meant to be
Not sure why, but your inside is hollow and empty.
And you're thinking some dark dark thoughts, but you can push them right out of your mind if you try. I swear.
"Trust me"

Things are gonna be different
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better
And everything will change
Say so long, say farewell
live and let die
It is cliche but every word I truly mean.
there is so much beauty to be seen.
And you're beautiful too kid.
You will be loved, you will be warm.
And these paths in life are meant to be walked.
"Believe me"

Things are gonna be different
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better
And everything will change
Say so long, say farewell
live and let die

Just don't give up.
Just don't let go.
I know you won't.

Just spend a little less time chasing those thoughts in your mind and just let them go...

Things are gonna be different kid.
Nothing will stay the same
It will get better and everything will change.

It will get better and everything will change.

Things are gonna be different kid, and everything will change.
