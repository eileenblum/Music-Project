[feat. Sam Carter of Architects]And forgive my sin but then I prayed for the day the rains come and wash you away. All the deceit, all the abuse, all the disease. To cleanse the wound, to end the curse. So I can heal, be free of your disease. I pray
For the end of days
For the rains to fall
For the rains to come and wash you away
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
and forgive my sin but then I prayed for the rains to come and wash you away.
How many years have I known you?
How much time have we shared?
How many lies have you spilled into the air?
And after all this time I've seen so many leave your side you will never realise -
you will never know why.
I pray
For the end of days
For the rains to fall
For the rains to come and wash you away
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
and forgive my sin but then I prayed for the rains to come and wash you away.
I know why your life is so empty
I know why you're always in pain
