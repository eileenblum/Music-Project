[feat. Andrew Neufeld of Comeback Kid]I'm staring at the sun, screaming out my lungs. I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind. I've got so much trouble on my mind, I can't describe.
No words to hide the pain behind my eyes
So where do we go from here??
give me heaven, give me hell, give me an answer
ARE WE LOST? WANDERLUST.
Still searching all these years gone by and still no end in sight.
I'm still staring at the sun,
screaming out my lungs
Ive sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
I'm staring at the sun, screaming out my lungs
I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
When did the compass break?
when did we lose our way?
give me heaven, give me hell, give me an answer
ARE WE LOST? WANDERLUST
Still searching all these years gone by and still no end in sight.
I'm still staring at the sun, screaming out my lungs
I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
I'm staring at the sun, screaming out my lungs
I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind
I swear with myself as my witness
that I, I'll get through anything.
I can get through this.
I swear with myself as my witness
that I'm still staring at the sun, screaming out my lungs
I've sang a hundred words to chase a hundred problems right out of my mind

(Explanation - I discovered hardcore, hip hop and punk music when I was about 12 years old courtesy of older siblings. At the time of writing this I am 29 years old. That's almost 20 years later I'm still coming back to this music to escape. To help me heal. To hype me up. To put me to sleep. To wake me up. To connect. To disconnect. To reminisce and to daydream of what could be.)
