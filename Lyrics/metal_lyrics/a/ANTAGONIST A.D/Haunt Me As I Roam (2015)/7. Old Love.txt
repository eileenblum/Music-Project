I used to see the world in your eyes All its beauty and its pain
And we felt the same
Now I only see the darkness inside
Only sorrow remains
And I drown in the shame
That I feel better for it
Yet I wonder if I should discard this success and share the pain as penance
For every wrong that I've done, It's wrong that you suffer, For I was your lover
If you're in my heart then you're in my veins and I didn't think that'd go away
But something cut so deep and you bled out of me
And she said "I hope you die, I hope you rot in a loveless grave. Just pain all love forgotten," and she said, "I hope you choke."
"You will beg for my forgiveness, you will beg for my sympathy, and I'll say no. I'll say nothing."
Fuck it's so damn hard... Fuck it.
I was the blood in your veins you flowed through me one and the same but the knife cut so deep and you bled out of me.
And I drown in the shame that I feel better for it
For every wrong that I've done, it's wrong that you suffer, For I was your lover
If you're in my heart then you're in my veins and I didn't think that would go away but something cut so deep and you bled out of me
A house that used to be a home
Now stands empty &amp; the bodies that grew within now walk alone
And she said, "you will wake up one day and realise that everything you hated
was just you reflected and on that discovery self loathing and misery will drown you unequivocally."
Go figure.
(Explanation- From my experience love is the worst / best thing you can ever be lucky enough to share. It never runs out but sometimes it can breed bitterness and spite. People do and say horrible things when they're hurt and then those words are stuck with the other forever. It's fucking hard.)
