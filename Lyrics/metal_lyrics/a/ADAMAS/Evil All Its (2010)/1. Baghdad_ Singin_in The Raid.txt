Waves of glowin metal
rise like a convoy
to the ripped dark by bellows
of sacrificial sirens

With self-abnegation
of nitwit rabid hounds
they go to root out
shadows in the night

The majestic mushroom-clouds
of the blasts raise
strange towers
lost cores of
faded buildingsâ frames.
His pains are nothing before the distruction hate
His voice doesnât compete against overkillinâ noice

There isnât human trace
in this apocalypse
There isnât human face,
Bagdad, singinâ in the raid

There isnât human face,
Bagdad, singinâ in the raid,
then a car slinks
like the dashinâ insect to the lair
The morrow the shaken Earth
will already have drank
his blood remains.
