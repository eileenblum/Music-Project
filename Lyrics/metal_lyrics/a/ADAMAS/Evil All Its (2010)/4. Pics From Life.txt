Not dark, nor clear, only grey; this day
Not cold, nor warm, just mild; this air
Not steady, nor fast, quite slow; this time
No problems and feelings, so light my mind.

into this grey you can see the difference
from holding one hand and tying one soul,
from noting pains, once more, on the sands,
and writing joys, only once, in the stone

[Ref:]
On the world I will stay tonight
waiting for another grey
cause it brings me next pic from life
greyness slides me over again

browsing my album again
how many, where are those days
fill up the life leaving no trace
no, no memories

[Ref:]
On the world I will stay tonight
waiting for another grey
cause it brings me next pic from life
greyness slides me over again
