Youâve no escaping route from this material world
donât believe in what men are making you do
Take heart, set you free from these chains of rules
grown on you doinâ what believe makes you a man too

long for freedom, youâre still in prison
run through the doom, give yourself room
and do not forget: you man just human
so do not forget: human just you

divest time of its value, give evil its right due
Gods will be envious of your truth
their twisted wings angels will follow you on this land
by then really tired of heaven too

[Chorus:]
weâre going to break all!
weâre going to break you all
