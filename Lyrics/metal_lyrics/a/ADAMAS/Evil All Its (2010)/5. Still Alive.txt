Now the night survives to the sun, you confuse it
all the things are shadinâ in this dark one by one
have you ever tried to think of not to be?
to think you canât say it anymore: time will come..
..so the life will leave you

Here I am in this night,
between your love and hate Iâm still alive
Here I am in this fight,
between the night and day Iâm still alive

have you ever done it or do it again?
The howl of this silence is growing more and more
so you have starting to dance your last dance
âcause time will be short and the music will end.

Stop to think, donât breath anymore rust and dust
now you know how it works, wasted life
close your mind, see out there is shining sun
far from goinâ out of your way, still a lie...
...then the life will leave you

Here I am in this night,
between your love and hate Iâm still alive
Here I am in this fight,
between good and evil Iâm still alive
Here I am in this life,
however warts and all Iâm still alive
Here I am, Iâm still alive
