Haring again the voice makes the ripper appear
Only I can stop this plaint of peace so real
It echoes in my mind as in the empty valley before
from reason to region where nothing is forgotten anymore

I let you watch, you might speculate on my painful life
I feel soulsâ breath that passed away to the night

[Bridge:]
bloody bridge, dive to live or die

[Ref:]
for a moment on the edge,
dressed in cold, when Iâm dead,
they wonât cry for me

over the dark sound of the bell
giving news of my escape
from this hypocrisy

[Solo]

diving, piercing this air where I don't belong
feeding the red of the bitchy grumble of the world

[Bridge:]
bloody bridge, dive to live or die

[Ref:]
for a moment on the edge,
dressed in cold, when Iâm dead,
they wonât cry for me

over the dark sound of the bell
giving news of my escape
from this hypocrisy

[Bridge:]
bloody bridge, dive to live or die
