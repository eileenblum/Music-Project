People we hate, people we love
Are fighting themselves
Only within us and just for a joke
Weâre killers and saints.
Chess is what we are playing.

I claim youâre my peer, my words are gold
Iâm lending a mask
My soul ainât already sold.

People we hate... ârevengeâ
People we love... ârevengeâ
Whisper ârevengeâ
Hold for revenge

People we hate, people we love
Are fighting themselves
Patience be my guide, disguise my weapon
Making out my way
A net of false silence and smiles

Why should I treasure useless creations?
Nothingâs going stronger
Than my need of destruction

Outside the wall people carve only injuries
But the briks will thin out
and when finally break down
They will find me on the other side,
ready to hit

People we hate... ârevengeâ
People we love... ârevengeâ
Whisper ârevengeâ.
Hold for revenge
