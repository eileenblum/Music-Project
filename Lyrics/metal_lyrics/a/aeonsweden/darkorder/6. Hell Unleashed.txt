Hell unleashed now we dominate
Years of darkness demons full of hate
Angels die they suffer the lambs of god
Darkness forever our time has just begun

Hell unleashed

Christians run evil dominant
Meet your end feeble flesh of god
He turn his back the holy god is dead
Swallowed by darkness never to return

Helpless Christians run
Waiting to be saved
No hands of god you see
Tortured souls you'll be

Beaten by the dark
You coughing up your blood
Sick of suffering
Your faith in god is dead

Hell unleashed
Through the gates we walk
Hell unleashed
We are Satan's children
Hell unleashed
No stoping us now
Hell unleashed
We are eternal

Welcome goat shaped lord
Take this key
To a world ruled by your hands
Rebuild your mighty throne
Upon your world
Hell unleashed evil is free
Baptized in flames
The world is Satan's
Only his

Hell unleashed
Hell
Hell unleashed
Hell

Hell unleashed now we dominate
Years of darkness demons full of hate
Angels die they suffer the lambs of god
Darkness forever our time has just begun

Helpless Christians run
Waiting to be saved
No hands of god you see
Tortured souls you'll be
Beaten by the dark
You coughing up your blood
Sick of suffering
Your faith in god is dead

Hell unleashed
Through the gates we walk
Hell unleashed
We are Satan's children
Hell unleashed
No stoping us now
Hell unleashed
We are eternal
