Father walk this earth I invoke you lord
Rise to rule once more
Create reality
As it was always meant to be

Enslave the week crush all the enemies
Crawl obey the new dark order

Enslave the ones who disbelieved
Kneel obey the new dark order

Soon you walk the earth the awakening
The awakening

The new dark order is complete
The crucifix of holy forever bleed
Pentagram circle has been sealed
Conquer the world we have achived

Father walk this earth I invoke you lord
Rise to rule once more
Create reality
As it was always meant to be

Enslave the week crush all the enemies
Crawl obey the new dark order

Enslave the ones who disbelieved
Kneel obey the new dark order

Soon you walk the earth the awakening
The awakening

Lord below

Soon you walk the earth the awakening
The awakening

The new dark order is complete
The crucifix of holy forever bleed
Pentagram circle has been sealed
Conquer the world we have achived
