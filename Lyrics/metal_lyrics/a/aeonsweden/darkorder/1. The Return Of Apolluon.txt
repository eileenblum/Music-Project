Dark ones rise above ground
To destroy what god create
Landscape after landscape
They march fast full of hate

Apolluon lord of destruction
We summon you o mighty one
Apolluon lord of destruction
Return o mighty one

Corpse covers the ground
Bodies ripped in two
Christians failed to defend
What god has built for them

Come fourth
Demon lord
Rebirth
Return of Apolluon

Harnartano, Hepta, Echo, Eschatos, Plege
Oxus Drepanon
Shed, Rasha, Rasha'yad, Ruwash'ra, Sheger
Heylel ben shacher they rise

Dark ones rise above ground
To destroy what god create
Landscape after ladscape
They march fast full of hate

Corpse covers the ground
Bodies ripped in two
Christians failed to defend
What god has built for them

The return of Apolluon
The return of Apolluon

Harnartano, Hepta, Echo, Eschatos, Plege
Oxus Drepanon
Shed, Rasha, Rasha'yad, Ruwash'ra, Sheger
Heylel ben shacher they rise

Dark ones rise above ground
