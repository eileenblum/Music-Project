Born to hate
Living my life ending yours
Love to hate
Utilized the light with lies

I breed hate
suffer
I am reality I am the bringer of eternal hate
I bring hate
Upon your church upon your cross
Eternal hate

You're heavenly children
You raised to be week as you
Brain washed Christians
In the bible they live
My hate against your children
Is what I live for
To give them misery
That's what I am here for

I breed hate
I am reality I am the bringer of eternal hate
I bring hate
Upon your church upon your cross
Eternal hate

The light will soon be dead
Darkness prevails
Fire walk this way
The armies of hate
God won't save you now
No answer you get
Your prayers a waste of time
Heaven is dead

Now I bring down god
With sin after sin
Dismember his children
Killing all of his love
My armies of hatred
Will forever stand tall
I breed hate eternal hate

Born to hate
Living my life ending yours
Love to hate
Utilized the light with lies

I breed hate
Suffer
