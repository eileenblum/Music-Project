Show no mercy kill them all
Standing at our doors
They try to turn our minds
Jehovah people they will burn
Lies after lies they try to feed us with
?The ending is now near
For all Jehovah life
Jehovah people they will die
Satan your enemies is under your control
We will kill sacrifice them all
Show no mercy to our enemies
We will make jehovah fall
In your kingdome hall
We will rape your women
Fill them with our seed
So our unholy race continues to grow
You hide from us
We are stronger we rise
No more knocking doors
Die with your lies
Jehovah sluts
Stands on their knees
Waiting to be doomed
Bloodbath we execute
Every single one of them
Make them feel when death araise
Nail them hard to the ground
Laughter from our lord satan
When they die
Suicide the only way out
For the Jehovah sluts
There is no escape from our kind
We celebrate our victory
Satanic rites
Show no mercy kill them all
Standing at our doors
They try to turn our minds
jehovah people they will burn
Lies after lies they try to feed us with
?The ending is now near
For all Jehovah life
Jehovah people they will die
You hide from us
We are stronger we rise
No more knocking doors
Die with your lies
Jehovah sluts
Stands on their knees
Waiting to be doomed
Pay me with blood
Until your body is dry
Pay me with blood
On your knees you will die
Pay me with blood
Empty your flesh
Jehovah
With blood the pay
Bloodbath we execute
Every single one of them
Make them feel when death araise
Nail them hard to the ground
Laughter from our lord satan
When they die
Suicide the only way out
For the Jehovah sluts
There is no escape from our kind
We celebrate our victory
Satanic rites
You hide from us
We are stronger we rise
No more knocking doors
Die with your lies
Jehovah sluts
Stands on their knees
Waiting to be doomed
Pay me with blood
Until your body is dry
Pay me with blood
On your knees you will die
Pay me with blood
Empty your flesh
Jehovah
With blood they pay
