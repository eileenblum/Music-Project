Bloodlust drink I feed my thirst
Warm blood food makes me strong

Father of sin I am the one you call son of night
Let me feed on your mortals
Bloodlust
Father of sin let me reign over blood
So I can be the blood god you need

Bloodlust - Immortal rites
Bloodlust - Thirst grows in me
Bloodlust - Warm sweet blood
The thirts has overtaken my body

Bloodlust drink I feed my thirst
Warm blood food makes me strong

Father of sin I am the one you call son of night
Let me feed on your mortals
Bloodlust
Father of sin let me reign over blood
So I can be the blood god you need

Bloodlust - Immortal rites
Bloodlust - Thirst grows in me
Bloodlust - Warm sweet blood
The thirts has overtaken my body

I have bloodlust - Immortal rites
Bloodlust - Thirst grows in me
Bloodlust - Warm sweet blood
The thirts has overtaken my body

Bite them drink I feed my thirst
Warm blood all over the neck

The warm blood inside of you
Will soon belong to me
You are my next target
Blood you will give me
My jaw around your neck
Punctured vein
Food starts to flow
Bleed for me

Look behind you I'm coming for more
Blood to feed my thirst
Eternal existing thirst
I kill to feed my thirst

Father of sin I am the one you call son of night
Let me feed on your mortals
Bloodlust
Father of sin let me reign over blood
So I can be the blood god you need

Bloodlust - Immortal rites
Bloodlust - Thirst grows in me
Bloodlust - Warm sweet blood
The thirts has overtaken my body

I have bloodlust - Immortal rites
Bloodlust - Thirst grows in me
