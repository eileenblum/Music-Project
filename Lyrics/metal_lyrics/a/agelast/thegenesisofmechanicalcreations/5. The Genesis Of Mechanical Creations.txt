This land was made of ashes, guilt, blood and bones,
Altars of hatred masses who were once brothers
Creating children with seed made of greediness,
Inserting mechanism in brain to hate.

Then giving to it a generic name,
You're labelled and born to rage.
It's all fucked up, you can't deny
Enthusiasm is based on despise

Psychotic prison and forced to continue the cold war
Mind atrophy and corruption here is the law
All the plans have been set for future generations
This is the genesis of mechanical creations.

This land was made of ashes, guilt, blood and bones,
Altars of hatred masses who were once brothers
Creating children with seed made of greediness,

For no reason we hate each other
but we're all stuck in this shit.
It's all fucked up, you can't deny
Enthusiasm is based on despise

Psychotic prison and forced to continue the cold war
Mind atrophy and corruption here is the law
All the plans have been set for future generations
This is the genesis of mechanical creations.
