(So fragile and scared. So young and unprepared.)

Absence of colors will always be, what I see
'cause after all, darkness is what consumes me
I lost myself in the dreams, that never came true
We're all defined by what us has consumed

You're my reflection in the mirror
An unerasable part of me
And in your everlasting sleep
I hope you dream of me

It's been years and time is only salting wounds
fearful and broken inside, but I know there's more than this..
I know there's more than this!
I've lost my way to our old home
Somewhere between life and your tombstone.
If breathing keeps me in this life,
then why with every breath I inhale I feel less alive?

You're my reflection in the mirror
An unerasable part of me
And in your everlasting sleep
I hope you dream of me
