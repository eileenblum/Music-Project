But I have promises to keep 
and miles to go before I sleep,
so in the name of these promises 
don't let my ghosts get me away.

why do I have to run thousand miles just get back home,
and why do I need to meet thousand people just to be alone again?
There must me more than stones I keep carrying in my pockets 
Because my fingers are outnumbered by the counting of the losses..

But I have promises to keep 
and miles to go before I sleep,
so in the name of these promises 
don't let my ghosts get me away.

who are we when we see ourselves in the mirror,
just a shade of our inner darkness or discomposure for others ego?
Have you ever been stuck on the highway,staring at some cityligths, 
wondering how they will never stare back at you?

But I have promises to keep 
and miles to go before I sleep,
so in the name of these promises 
don't let my ghosts get me away.

(Abandonment of your soul.)
