I will not let my children see this world,full of disguise
Keep asking myself - how can we even sleep at night?
bruises of eating own flesh for a piece of benefaction
My stomach can't digest this, we're left with no solutions

With our incorrigibly actions
we're leading to desolation
Gambling every chance of survival
how can we still live in denial?

Working bees are lost and horsemen are riding on our way
Masses wont awake because their minds are full of shit
Our youth is dying breed, slowly rotting to decay
We have everything sculptured with our fingers of despair

With our incorrigibly actions
we're leading to desolation
Gambling every chance of survival
how can we still live in denial?

Our world is falling apart!
