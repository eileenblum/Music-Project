Embrace of cold pretentious love, that seals the night
Rejection of your words above, soon gone, the light

I never wanted what I saw, you gave to me and nothing more
Your empty arms and hollow eyes, have left me broken

Echoing, are the screams, from my cries, lost in dreams
Through darkness I know that the truth won't be mine
Why try?

A burdened heart you cared for then, no more, a lie
A reason for the face of dead
You wore, still might

Again with tears of solitude
When nothing harming, hurting you
A word too far, a cut too deep
Will never heal again

Echoing, are the screams
From my cries, lost in dreams
Through darkness I know that the truth won't be mine
Why try?

Why try, you lie, I die, why try?

Echoing, are the screams
From my cries, lost in dreams
Through darkness I know that the truth won't be mine
Why try?
