You turned around to see I was dying
Once was thought that I was hiding
Pulled away from what I knew I'd do
Salvaged loss, reminds me of you

Nothing left for you to die for
Seeing myself without what you've taken from me
You've taken from me

A glance at my day has left me inside
Waiting for you to free me from crying (from crying)
Bringing this down is my own illusion (illusion's gone)
Rancid hope, it drives me through (drives me through)

Nothing left for you to die for
Seeing myself without what you've taken from me
Nothing left for you to die for
Seeing myself without what you've taken from me
You've taken from me

My fear dissipating, I've always longed to watch you fade

Nothing left for you to die for
Seeing myself without what you've taken from me (close my eyes)
Nothing left for you to die for
Seeing myself without what you've taken from me
You've taken from me
