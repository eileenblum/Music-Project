I never knew your love was just a love impure, disguised by lust
The bitter thought you led to die would never stay untrue, a lie

Forgiving self to you was less
This child, this time, this life, this mess
When giving up held so much pain

I see the world you're seeing, I feel the pain your feeling
Never thrown, never owned, never leave me, kill me, heal me
I can't see past what's haunting me, scared my eyes refuse to see
Fear it grows and I know, the face that stares through fabled truth won't show

Falling from a time to be, awaiting stares from you to me
Flinch at every move you make, my trust was never yours to take

The wasted time you spent with me
My only childhood memories
Stained with blood my scars won't lie
Within my soul.. Within my mind

I see the world you're seeing, I feel the pain your feeling
Never thrown, never owned, never leave me, kill me, heal me
I can't see past what's haunting me, scared my eyes refuse to see
Fear it grows and I know, the face that stares through fabled truth

Your jaded eyes, inside my mind

You seem to think you're overreacting
I'm seeking attention you don't know a thing about me
Hate to compare your care with abuse
Emotions defused, let me see if you can judge me

I see the world you're seeing, I feel the pain your feeling
Never thrown, never owned, never leave my, kill me, heal me
I can't see past what's haunting me, scared my eyes refuse to see
Fear it grows and I know, the face that stares through fabled truth won't show
