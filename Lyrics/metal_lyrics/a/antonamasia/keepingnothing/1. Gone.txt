I stand stagnant and alone, bitter to the bone
Dismay is my own friend, I carry home again

Flee me, love me, abandon what it is you gave me
Hate me, let me, never knowing what you saw in me

Impossible to live within this mind of shattered dreams
Impossible to love when I can't see past my scene
Plays again in my own head, story's left inside me said
(Cut you down but you won't hurt, crush the crave I'm drawn to)

Flee me, (kill me), love me, (leave me), take my woeful heart and bleed me
Hate me, (need me), let me, (be me), bring this sorrow home and give me peace

At first, the thought to end invites it's only friend
The sickness of a heart that tears this life apart

Impossible to live within this mind of shattered dreams
Impossible to love when I can't see past my scene
Plays again in my own head, story's left inside me said
(Cut you down but you won't hurt, crush the crave I'm gone)

I find I do not know you or even know myself
Nothing I've kept sacred has helped me fight this hell
I wanna feel you inside, I want to keep you (I want to hide)

Impossible to live within this mind of shattered dreams
Impossible to love when I can't see past my scene
Plays again in my own head, story's left inside me
(Cut you down but you won't hurt, crush the crave I'm gone)
