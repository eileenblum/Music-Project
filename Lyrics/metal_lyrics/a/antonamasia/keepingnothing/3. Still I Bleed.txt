My thoughts of you have broke my mind, a soul inside of me to find
Give to you was all of me, hidden from you is all I'll be

I've watched my life go by, nothing's faded faster than you
You'll never see me cry, this worth is not for you
Is this my suffering, the bitter cost of letting you see me?
This vacant life you bring to me won't be the reason that I

Glance into a place once knew, now estranged and darkened to me
A place that changed by all too few
Why is this real?

The dreamt despair I find within, delivered by your eyes
An empty stare I welcome you, my own mind I defy

I've watched my life go by, nothing's faded faster than you
You'll never see me cry, this worth is not for you
Is this my suffering, the bitter cost of letting you see me?
This vacant life you bring to me won't be the reason that I bleed

Following hollow dreams that lead me to you
Breaking through I see
Following hollow dreams that lead me to you
Breaking through I see

I've watched my life go by, nothing faded faster than you
You'll never see me cry, this worth is not for you
Is this my suffering, the bitter cost of letting you see me?
This vacant life you bring to me won't be the reason that I bleed
