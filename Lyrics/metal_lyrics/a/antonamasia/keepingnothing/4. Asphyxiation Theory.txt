What happens now the man's not here, and he's not coming is he?
He's never coming, now the white coat's missing
Now there's two sides to everything, everything except you and everybody knows
You never said I was there, never showed your face, always stayed inside

Go (needing, leaving), lies and deception, they build your pretension
Low (terror's waiting), taking for granted, you hide heavy handed
(Not just for me, everyone sees)

Suffering, wasting jealousy
You scream out your fears, it falls on deaf ears
Crimson tears from your tainted eyes
You fall from you feet, alive when you meet with the end

(Never made anyone believe in what you thought I'd done)
Trying to lose all your hidden agenda's
(I'll take my place in front of you, leaving you far behind)
Lost in your shadow, you craved for the sorrow
(Die by my eyes, no more disguise)

Suffering, wasting jealousy, you scream out your fears, it falls on deaf ears
Crimson tears from your tainted eyes
You fall from you feet, alive when you meet with the

End of you, pray for the darkness born inside of you
Destroy you, suffering what you deserve to lose

Slit your wrist for one first time, bleed not breathe you dirty whore

Suffering, wasting jealousy, scream out your fears, it falls on deaf ears
Crimson tears from you tainted eyes
You fall from you feet, alive when you meet with the end
