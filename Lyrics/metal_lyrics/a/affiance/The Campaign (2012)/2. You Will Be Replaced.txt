It seems the walls are closing in. The clock defeats another day. With
each step we're pushing forth. This is the only way. Your taunts have only
increased our pace. You sad men, it's time to be replaced and discarded.
Until we collapse or breathe our last.

We're fighting as hard as we can to not be forgotten. We're running as
fast as we can. To the front lines we live on forever.

We've been dismissed and disgraced. Our hands are fit to be tied. Mark my
words: I've faced my fears, and now these fists are free to fight. I know
the way to freedom, my faults will not defeat me. We know the path to
justice, and these walls cannot contain us or persuade us. Until I
collapse or breathe my last.

We're fighting as hard as we can to not be forgotten. We're running as
fast as we can. To the front lines we live on forever.

You will be replaced.

We're fighting as hard as we can to not be forgotten. We're running as
fast as we can. To the front lines we live on forever. We will never be
forgotten. Forever. We will never be forgotten.
