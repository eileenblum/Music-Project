The time is here
that we all knew and feared.
Are we strong enough
to endure this stand?

For the time has come
to choose your stance.
Will I become another
suppressor of man?

Am I the same as them?
Is it just human instinct to survive
and protect what's ours?

Is this a vicious cycle,
will I become another suppressor some day?

Manipulate the people.

History is only written
by those who win the war.

I need to know if I die right here
it will not be in vain.

Chin up with my heart crying out to the crowd,
I fear failure.
Gear up for the battle the time is now,
I fear failure.

Ignorance is bliss.
But now I'm more than conscious
of the truth at hand.

We are no longer prisoners to regret.
We have towed this burden far.
And the absolute has set us free.
There is no turning back.
And now we get up off the ground.
Stand tall with resolve.

We have marched to the beat of a new drum.
I now choose to fulfill my destiny.

Go and call upon warriors.
Do not let this movement die.
My final request
is to remember that I tried.

God forgive me.
Don't let me die in vain.
