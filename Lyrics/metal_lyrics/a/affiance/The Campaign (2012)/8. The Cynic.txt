You defend yourself
but you refuse to listen.
You won't be spared the conflict
and you can't run forever.

I won't allow your apathy
to cradle you securely.
Are you weathered enough to survive
the trials of life?

Your lips are sealed,
your eyes are blind.
It's clear you've made up your mind.
Like pearls to swine, you are a waste of my time.

You can't hide forever.

What made you so afraid
to seek the truth?
Living in denial
with your head in the ground.

Your lips are sealed,
your eyes are blind.
It's clear you've made up your mind.
Like pearls to swine, you are a waste of my time.

You can't challenge others
before you challenge yourself.

Open your heart and
and tear down the self made walls
you've trapped yourself inside.
