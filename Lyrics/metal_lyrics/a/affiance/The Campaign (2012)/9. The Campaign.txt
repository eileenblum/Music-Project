Welcome!
How nice of you to finally join us.
Once more you proven my point ever so clearly
It's time to think and get this straight to plan your move strategically
We are more than pawns
We are more rooks and queens
A new kind of loyalty

We are more than light passing through the void of our mind.
For it's worth the fight to save the soul of man before it dies.

Doubts hand over your head feeding the madness
But who will stand with me if you're too scared, too scared to stand at all?
Just know that we will never stop until every man is rebuilt
Erase the stories we were told

We are more than light passing through the void of our mind.
For it's worth the fight to save the soul of man before it dies.

Welcome!
Just know that we will never stop until every man is rebuilt
Erase the stories we were told
It's time we write them ourselves!
Just know that we will never stop until our warrior are avenged
Erase the stories we were told
It's time we write them ourselves!
