Building the god of technology,
Our evolution grants us
Passage to a higher plain.

A war is waging against humanity.
Can we fight them off
Or will we forever be

Changed, by our own invention
Have we gone too far?
Is this our best intention?
Have we forgotten what we
Who we are?

What makes us human 
If not the soul?

You set these gears in motion
With no hesitation
And this time they won't
Grind to a halt.

This machine that you've created
Will be the one that slays you.
We will forever be

Changed, by our own invention
Have we gone too far?
Is this our best intention?
Have we forgotten what we
Who we are?
Have we forgotten who we are?

Our frail bodies were programmed to die.
We were destined to decay.
So let my body rot away.
Lest my soul never takes flight.
