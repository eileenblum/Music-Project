[feat. Ricky Armellino Of Century]My righteous anger will set us free.
I was taught to love but vengeance has found me
I gave you the power you have,
and now I take it away.

Fists clenched and voices raised,
we'll bring an end to your reign.

If you want it, you can have it.
A war is about to begin
If you strike me, I will strike back.
And this time I will win.

So now your days are numbered.
And this has come to pass.
This can't be real.
This time it's real.

Face in the dirt
with your hands bound behind you.
What a fitting end for a coward.
What a fitting end for a coward.

If I can't rewrite the past
then I will erase your future!
If I can't rewrite the past
then I will erase your future!

Fists clenched and voices raised,
we are the end of your reign.

If you want it, you can have it.
A war is about to begin
If you strike me, I will strike back.
And this time I will win.

So now your days are numbered.
And this has come to pass.
This can't be real.
This time it's real.

You only have what power you were given.
So now I take it away.

I can't let you lie.
Now I watch you die!
