Watch the infection spread.
What will cease the senseless end
to thought provoking reason.

They stood in line for you,
now they're breaking down your door.
This is the cost of treason.

We are the smoking gun.
Speak now or forever hold your peace.
We know who you really are.
We've come to collect what's rightfully ours.

The judge's hammer falls
heavy on those who blaspheme his seat.

You are one of those
Your heavy head cannot save
your ever so shallow heart

They stood in line for you,
now they're breaking down your door.
This is the cost of treason.

We are the smoking gun.
Speak now or forever hold your peace.
We know who you really are.
We've come to collect what's rightfully ours.

We are the smoking gun.
Speak now or forever hold your peace.
We know who you really are.
We've come to collect what's rightfully ours.

We know who you really are
