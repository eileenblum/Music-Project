[feat. Dustin Davidson Of August Burns Red]Life, keeps moving on as if nothing happened.
With questions we have failed to ask.
Convince ourselves that these questions matter,
But when we ask they remain unanswered.

We all watch in suspense
Waiting for the climax,
But we've been waiting too long.

Our kingdom overthrown and a king,
Our king dethroned
By the kings of deceit.

Reciting out lines made up of lies.
Reading the script thinking we're wise.
Deep inside the roles you'll find
The plot to conquer all mankind.

Power doesn't come from the barrel of a gun.

A shift that defines our strength,
To defy your crushing weight
Where justice seeks corruption,
And freedom saves the weak.

We all watch in suspense
Waiting for the climax,
But we've been waiting too long.

Our kingdom overthrown and a king,
Our king dethroned
By the kings of deceit.

Reciting out lines made up of lies.
Reading the script thinking we're wise.
Deep inside the roles you'll find
The plot to conquer all mankind.

And when we ask, they remain unanswered!

I'm done reciting your lies.
I won't stop until I find the truth.
This time I will dethrone you.

Power doesn't come form the barrel of a gun.
It comes from truth,
And we will seek out justice.
Your death will not be in vain.
