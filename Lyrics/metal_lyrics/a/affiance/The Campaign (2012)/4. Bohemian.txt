[feat. Matty Mullins Of Memphis May Fire]You stood before me with empty promises,
offering what I don't need.
There is no beating heart, just breaking inhibitions.
She'll chew you up and spit you out.

You say you wear your heart on your sleeve,
but you mean only to decieve.
You have become my disease.

I want back my innocence,
but here's reality

All the things you've said,
the words that plague my mind.
All the skin you bare,
burns my eyes.

I know all about you,
I can see right through you.
I've been here before,
it will never be over.

All you ever brought was pain.
Now I'm ashamed to know your name.
But never again.

Her eyes were locked on mine.
And I hate every memory
of crossing that line.

So now I'll live with this regret
hanging over my head.
But never again.

All the things you've said,
the words that plague my mind.
All the skin you bare,
burns my eyes.

I know all about you,
I can see right through you.
I've been here before,
it will never be over.

Never again.
Never again.
I regret of every memory of ever crossing that line
Never again.

All the things you've said,
the words that plague my mind.
All the skin you bare,
burns my eyes.

I know all about you,
I can see right through you.
I've been here before,
it will never be over.

I know all about you,
I can see right through you.
I've been here before.

I know all about you,
I can see right through you.
I've been here before.
