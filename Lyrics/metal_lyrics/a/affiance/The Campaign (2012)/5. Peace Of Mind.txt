Trust me on this one
I would not steer you wrong
Even if I do not heed my own suggestion
Before you take flight and soar through the sky
Be sure you've learned how to land

Who is pleading for our peace of mind?
Why do we complicate instead of simplify?
So loosen the noose around your neck

We held you so high
But we were crushed beneath the weight
Expectations
It's the human condition to always lust, to always lust for more
Searching in the dark
It's time to tame your wandering

Who is pleading for our peace of mind?
Why do we complicate instead of simplify?
So loosen the noose around your neck

We held you so high

If you're struggling with breathing
Can't find your way back home
If you find your passions fleeting
Look to the truth you hold

Who is pleading for our peace of mind?
Why do we complicate instead of simplify?
So loosen the noose around your neck
