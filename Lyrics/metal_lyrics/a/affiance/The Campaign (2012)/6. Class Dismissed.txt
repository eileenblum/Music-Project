Broke and burdened
by the debt you persuaded us to bear.
Hard and calloused,
there's nothing left but animosity.

We're slipping through the crack.
Our time has passed us,
and we will be forgotten if we
give up hope.

I'm finished
being your puppet.
I will not take your orders
anymore.

You'll never know what it's like
to labor as we have.
It's only a matter of time
before we toss you off our backs.

I've earned the right to speak and say
what I mean.
We pave your roads. We haul your trash.
We fight your wars. Show some respect.

You are nothing without me.

You'll never know what it's like
to labor as we have.
It's only a matter of time
before we toss you off our backs.

You need to need to know what it's like
to labor as we have.
It's only a matter of time.
It's time to knock you on your ass.

When the weight of the world is on your back,
feels like your spine could snap.

When you fight so hard
to stay afloat.
Just stay afloat.
Don't give up hope!
Just stay afloat.
Don't give up hope!

I'm finished
being your puppet.
