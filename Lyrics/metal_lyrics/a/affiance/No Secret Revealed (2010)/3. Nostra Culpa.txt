In the age of reason equations will be used to conclude that we don't need our
souls anymore. We mourn humanity in the name of progression. We cling to
answers and abandon the questions. We stand tall, with our heels to the neck of
creation. A conquest to conquer as we destroy ourselves. A conquest to conquer
as we destroy ourselves. If we believe the sun is our design, if we believe we
put the clouds up in the sky, if we believe that God's eyes are blind, if we
believe, this is deicide. We are cold steel machinery. We stand tall, with our
heels to the neck of creation. A conquest to conquer as we destroy ourselves. A
conquest to conquer as we destroy ourselves. We've sacrificed purity to create
a machine that breaths.
