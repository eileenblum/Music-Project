Headlines light like flares and they fly like moths to the flame. A
generation's will, traded in for chains. Terror is a messenger, a catalyst for
change. Terror is a messenger, they will take the bait. It's the formula for
utopia. To calculate and control. The sirens will sing in time with the mortars
and we will usher in the new world order. The pages of these books will burn.
And these hands will wash each other. We chose the truth that will make our
history. When men speak in slogans, we will speak in bullets, 'cause truth is
treason in an empire of lies. They will bow at our feet. We will become their
gods. It's the formula for utopia. To calculate and control. The sirens will
sing in time with the mortars and we will usher in the new world order. Must we
constantly forget our history repeats itself? Open up your eyes and see, by the
stroke of a pen our world will end.

[John F Kennedy speaking:]
"For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy
that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence. It
is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the
building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military,
diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its
preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not
headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is
questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed."
