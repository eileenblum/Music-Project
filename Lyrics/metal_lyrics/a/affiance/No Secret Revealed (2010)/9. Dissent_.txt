The earth won't rest beneath your thumb. The earth won't rest beneath your
thumb. No! The ends don't justify the means. We caught you sowing seeds of
destruction, nursing your dream. Silence is not the answer, and we won't sit
idly by. It's time we stand to fight. By the passion of our hearts our fists
will be raised. Stare into the eyes of the giant. Arrogance has no memory. And
you will hang your head in defeat as you hang from above the streets. By the
passion of our hearts our fists will be raised. Stare into the eyes of the
giant. By the passion of our hearts our fists will be raised. And your kingdom
of cards will fall. Like hell tyranny isn't easily conquered. By the passion of
our hearts our fists will be raised. Stare into the eyes of the giant. By the
passion of our hearts our fists will be raised. And your kingdom of cards will
fall. By the passion of our hearts our fists will be raised. Stare into the
eyes of the giant.
