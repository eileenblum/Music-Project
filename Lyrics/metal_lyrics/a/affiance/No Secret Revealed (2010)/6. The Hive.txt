We are the blow that buckles your knees. Your eyes aren't open.You'll never be
set free. And every line we fear to cross will begin to blur. And if you live
by the pen, you will die by the sword. Your voice is unwelcome here. You will
be silenced by the horde. Ties that bind us, keeping us secure. Lies to hide
us, deep inside your haven, your hive. We are the words that are lodged in the
back of your throat, waiting to break through your teeth. Stand convinced with
no conviction that we are cursed beyond a cure. Your voice is unwelcome here.
You will be silenced by the horde. Ties that bind us, keeping us secure. Lies
to hide us, deep inside your haven, your hive. So drink, drink deep, and die in
the hive. It's so hard to find the truth in silence. Untie your tongue and
clear the air that pollutes your ears. Ties that bind us, keeping us secure.
Lies to hide us, deep inside your haven, your hive. This place you've chosen to
hide, your haven, your hive. This place we've come to destroy, the haven, the
hive.
