What shield guards the heart is not estranged to hate. What armor shields the
arms that aren't ashamed to take. Once you let greed inside you push virtue
aside. Cause everything has a price and there is nothing they can't buy. Still
you raise your cup and drink to the blood on the market. And if a beast shows
his teeth, he will feast on the weak. Clever men hack at the trunk with brides
and ploys. To sever men at the stem, to destroy them. Still you raise your cup
and drink to the blood on the market. And if a beast shows his teeth, he will
feast on the weak. Your charade is a patriot's campaign. You distract men with
crusades. You persuade us with parades. Only war is your gain. You were
supposed to lead us. Why did you lead us astray? Was this in your design, to
lead us to the mass grave?
