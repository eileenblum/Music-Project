Hunger, unsatisfied. Thirst, unquenchable. I pour like an empty glass. As you
over power me. It says it's hungry. 'Cause a monster fed is a monster that's
happy. It says it's hungry. 'Cause a monster fed is a monster that's happy. How
could I have known I would reach the bottom? A fall that I would fall for
years. How could I have known, you'd leave me stranded? You would abandon me.
It says it's hungry. 'Cause a monster fed is a monster that's happy. It says
it's hungry. 'Cause a monster fed is a monster that's happy. Oh, we will feed
until... We will feed until we are full and over flowing.
