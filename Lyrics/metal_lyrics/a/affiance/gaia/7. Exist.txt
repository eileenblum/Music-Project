I stare into the mirror,
Revealing blood shot eyes,
Examining the beast withing!

I no longer believe my lies!

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders,
I cannot breathe!
I can't carry much longer...

Contemplating my existence,
Been out of touch out of my mind
In time our memories will fade
Who will be left, what will remain!

We spend our lives, trampling the earth
Until the day we die!
We are kicking up dirt
I can feel it rise, take back control
Who will remember you?
Are we really along?

Will I lose it.
FUCKING LOSE IT ALL?!

Followed my instincts, until I lost
Who I was, where I'm going.
I dug a grave, a grave for hope!
I must rebuild with my two hands...

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders,
I cannot breathe!
I can't carry much longer
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulders!!
I cannot breathe!
I can't carry much longer!

I must rebuild!

"There comes the times in everyone's life
Where we must question
everything we think we know, and understand
about ourselves and the world around us.
To truly discover one's self, one's purpose.
We are at the precipice of change.
The entire human race, an awakening!
'Cause if there is no fate,
Is there not even more meaning.
In whatever we decide
Our purpose should be?!"

We spend our lives, trampling the earth
Until the day we die!
We are kicking up dirt
I can feel it rise, take back control
Who will remember you?
Are we really along?

Will I lose it all?!
(Lose it all...)
I must rebuild with my own hands!
