I no longer believe we are in control of this
The machine calculating our death
This wasn't built to last !
Our entire system dissolving fast
Resolve will be our only escape

As this virus spreads, we lose more love
If we are to survive, rewrite history, reboot our minds.
We are taught to fear the unknown
Regard each other as a foreign threat
We have all been programmed, now we all must press reset. Reboot !

They've hijacked our minds
Lay waste to innovation, they've squashed our imagination
Trade human life for profit margins as we stand back and observe

As this virus spreads, we lose more love
If we are to survive, rewrite history, reboot our minds.
We are taught to fear the unknown
Regard each other as a foreign threat
We have all been programmed, now we all must press reset.
We are taught to fear the unknown
Regard each other as a foreign threat
We have all been programmed, now we all must press reset.

The solution is not in the sky
The apathetic cannot hide
There is no satisfaction, no cure for this disease
Set fire to what you think you know
Understand, it's only your belief
You think this wasn't in "their" plan?
This was not built to last, it was designed to collapse!
