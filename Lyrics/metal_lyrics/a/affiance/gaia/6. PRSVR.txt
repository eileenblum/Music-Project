Losing endurance, testing my patience
resisting the temptation to walk away and forget about tomorrow
You'll never get this far unless you fight, and if you are broken, start picking up your pieces
and rebuild again
You haven't come this far without a fight, and if you falter, don't listen to your demons Persevere!

My anger is a parasite
My heart will never justify
Until the record is set right, don't stop now!

In my sleep I dream of sinking
there is no one near to hear my cries
watching my dreams go up in flames
before I fade away and die
The odds are stacked against us!

Persevere, like cancer inside me
Satiate it's hunger
Prophecies are beckoning my soul
I need this, I can't stop now!

You'll never get this far unless you fight, and if you are broken, start picking up your pieces
and rebuild again
You haven't come this far without a fight, and if you falter, don't listen to your demons
Donât listen to your demons !

Drag the anchor holding you down
break the line and pull yourself out
fight your demons, get up off the ground
Persevere and save yourself.

Persevere, like cancer inside me
Satiate the hunger !

Persevere, like cancer inside me
Satiate this hunger
Prophecies are beckoning my soul
I need this, I can't stop now!
Persevere, like cancer inside me
Satiate this hunger
Prophecies are beckoning my soul
I need this, I can't stop NOW!
