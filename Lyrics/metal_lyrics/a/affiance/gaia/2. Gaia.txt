Listen while she's still speaking !
Will we only learn our lesson when our desires have eclipse the earth
Where will you hide ?
And when the veil is stripped away from her, there will be nothing left to consume
And time you can't take back
We cannot begin again !

We are one, this is our broken home
Our mother she weeps tonight
Are we lost and running out of time
How can we live if she dies

Listen while she's still speaking
Fix your eyes on the horizon and walk to the edge of the earth
Should a child pay for their father's sins or is it to late to save you
And time you can't take back, we cannot begin again

We are one, this is our broken home
Our mother she weeps tonight
Are we lost and running out of time
How can we live if she dies

Fix your eyes on the horizon and walk to the edge of the earth
Listen while she's still speaking

We are one, this is our broken home
Our mother she weeps tonight
Are we lost and running out of time
How can we live if she dies

We will reap what we sow
Listen while she's still speaking
We cannot begin again.
We will reap what we sow
Listen while she's still speaking
We cannot begin again.
We will reap what we sow
Listen while she's still speaking
We cannot begin again.
We will reap what we sow
Listen while she's still speaking
We cannot begin again.

We will reap what we sow !
