Thinking, desperate for answers
A mind that never stops
All alone the nights are cold,
Distance grows greater to a place
I've never seen!

I've been wandering how did I get here
I'm so far away from who you thought I'd be
Always trying to be myself
Because knowing who I am
Afraid of who I'm not!

Grieving a loss of certainty
In following one path!
Break the mold
Be whoever whatever I need to be
But I can count on one hand
The times I felt you'd understand me!

I've been wandering how did I get here
I'm so far away from who you thought I'd be
Always trying to be myself
Because knowing who I am
Afraid of who I'm not!

...Wandering how did I get here
I'm so far away from who you thought I'd be!
Always trying to be myself
Because knowing who I am
Afraid of who I'm not!
(Far away...)
(Always...)
