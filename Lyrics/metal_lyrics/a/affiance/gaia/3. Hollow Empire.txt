Your life casts a long shadow
A jaded legacy,
The world you leave behind
Will be a barren wasteland

You said you did this all for me
Thought only of yourself
These habits can't sustain our lives !

CONSUME ! DIVIDE !
Rewind and start again
CONSUME ! DIVIDE !
Rewind and start again !

All as one blindly working
To build another Hollow Empire !
Everyone slowly losing ambition
To become...

CONSUME ! DIVIDE !
Rewind and start again
CONSUME ! DIVIDE !
Rewind and start again

...Violence !

Fills my mind,
These days are so misleading
Tear out my throat,
Because our voices have no meaning !

The cross you made
Is too heavy to carry !
The burden you left
Will end up leaving us buried !

Start again !
All as one blindly working
To build another Hollow Empire !
Everyone slowly losing ambition
To become...

There's no future here !
(No future here)
These lies will stand no longer !

It's time to bring it,
Bring the fucking justice !
Bring the fucking justice !!

All as one...
All as one !

(We will)
CONSUME ! DIVIDE !

It's a vicious circle

CONSUME ! DIVIDE !

When will it end ?!

CONSUME ! DIVIDE !

Rewind and start...
AGAIN !
