So take your flame,
And watch your bridges BURN!!

I'm so sick and tired
Of your endless preaching,
But the certainty of your divinity
Is about a stable as quicksand!

You manipulate a story of grace
Fear becomes your god,
Turning servants to slaves!
It was never your right
To tell me how to live my life!
I'm not yours to rule
Interpret for myself now
I'm not your god damned fool!

You claim the promise of love
Offering inner peace!
But instead of quenching ones thirst for water
You justify hatred by breathing fire!

I cannot take anymore
Of your small mindeness!
So take your flame,
And watch your bridges BURN!!

You manipulate a story of grace
Fear becomes your god,
Turning servants to slaves!
It was never your right
To tell me how to live my life!
I'm not yours to rule
Interpret for myself now
I'm not your god damned fool!

If humanity is god's most precious creation,
Why do you condemn it to damnation?

So take your flame,
And watch your bridges burn!
'Cause who needs bridges
When you can walk on water?!
