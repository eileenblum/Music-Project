Here we are barking up a storm
About what will be and what will come
But nothing ever advances
In result of all our hatred

Now the harvest is at hand
Diplomacy can't save this land
It's never enough until we've gone too far

STIR THE LAKE OF FIRE
LET THE SKY FALL
FEAR WILL FEND THEM OFF
SO BOMBS AWAY

It's life for life
It's blood for blood
Hatred perpetuated

History repeats
And the tradition lives on
To give the enemy a face
Other than our own

STIR THE LAKE OF FIRE
LET THE SKY FALL
FEAR WILL FEND THEM OFF
DEATH COMES FOR YOU ALL

STIR THE LAKE OF FIRE
WATCH YOUR CITY BURN
CRUSHING THEIR RESOLVE
SO BOMBS AWAY
