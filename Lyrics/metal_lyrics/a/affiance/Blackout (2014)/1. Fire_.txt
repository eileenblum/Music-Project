Fire!

This place scorched beyond recognition
Chaos reigns
See the ruin around us
Feel confusion within

THEY CAME FOR US
SET OUR WORLD ABLAZE
ONE MILLION DEAD
IS THIS THE PRICE WE PAY?
UP FROM THE ASHES
WE WILL APPEAR
REPAY THE FAVOR
THE WAR YOU WANT IS HERE

If you rule the air
We will take the ground
Pull you down and strip you off your precious crown
How does it feel to know
The power has its limits?
Your kingdom has an end

No reason for life
Slaves set free

THEY CAME FOR US
SET OUR WORLD ABLAZE
ONE MILLION DAYS
IS THIS THE PRICE WE PAY?
UP FROM THE ASHES
WE WILL APPEAR
REPAY THE FAVOR
THE WAR YOU WANT IS HERE

Fire!

THEY CAME FOR US
SET OUR WORLD ABLAZE
ONE MILLION DAYS
IS THIS THE PRICE WE PAY?
UP FROM THE ASHES
WE WILL APPEAR
REPAY THE FAVOR
THE WAR YOU WANT IS HERE
