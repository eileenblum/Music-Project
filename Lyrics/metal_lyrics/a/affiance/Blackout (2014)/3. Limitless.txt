Time and time again
I see myself through the naked eye
I've walked to the edge of myself
Screaming to this empty space

Am I giving up?

JUMP
TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH FOR ME (JUMP)
SEARCH WITHIN AND YOU WILL SEE (JUMP)
THAT THIS PATH IS DESTINY (JUMP)
AND THE TRUTH THAT SETS YOU FREE

Easy to say the faith will not fray
But I'm hanging on by a thread
Fears from which I cannot hide
The dead parts inside I can't revive

I've got nothing left
But I'm not giving up

JUMP
TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH FOR ME (JUMP)
SEARCH WITHIN AND YOU WILL SEE (JUMP)
THAT THIS PATH IS DESTINY (JUMP)
AND THE TRUTH THAT SETS YOU FREE

When it's all said and done
You are the only one
Holding you back

JUMP
TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH FOR ME (JUMP)
SEARCH WITHIN AND YOU WILL SEE (JUMP)
THAT THIS PATH IS DESTINY (JUMP)
AND THE TRUTH THAT SETS YOU FREE
