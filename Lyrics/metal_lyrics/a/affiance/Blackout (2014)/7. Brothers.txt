Looking back I remember feeling stronger
We must have been invincible
Join the war for integrity's sake
Hoping our presence would be enough

Take to the air
The siren sounds and duty is calling
Meet our enemies there
Praying we will make it back alive

As we soar across the sky
I can't help but wonder why
As our enemies draw near
Our hearts are void of all fear

Memories flash before our eyes
Our last thoughts before we die
Recalling what had brought us here
As you plummet out of sight

I WATCHED YOU FALL TO YOUR GRAVE
I'D FIGHT BY YOUR SIDE IN HELL
TO BRING YOU BACK
BROTHER!

Smoldering wreckage is all that's left
Is this your reward?
I never thought we would kill for our beliefs
I never thought we would have to pay with our lives

As we soar across the sky
I can't help but wonder why
As our enemies draw near
Our hearts are void of all fear

Memories flash before our eyes
Our last thoughts before we die
Recalling what had brought us here
As you plummet out of sight

I WATCHED YOU FALL TO YOUR GRAVE
I'D FIGHT BY YOUR SIDE IN HELL
TO BRING YOU BACK
BROTHER!

Freedom comes at a price
Your life now part of the debt
Brother give me the strength to fly on
When the air raid sirens blare

BROTHER!
