Please take me back to the start
Young with hopes and dreams
That supersede the impossible
Suspending fear and doubt
For a chance to feel

Alive
We live and die by our convictions
Our dreams achieved through sacrifice

I KNOW I CAN'T GO BACK
I'M TOO FAR AWAY TO FEEL
TRAPPED IN AN HOURGLASS
NOW THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO FEEL

Please bring me back to the heart
This distance numbing me
I am becoming a shell
Of who I was meant to be

I KNOW I CAN'T GO BACK
I'M TOO FAR AWAY TO FEEL
TRAPPED IN AN HOURGLASS
NOW THERE IS NOTHING LEFT TO FEEL

Alive
We live and die by our convictions
Our dreams achieved through sacrifice
