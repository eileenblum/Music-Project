Towers all around us crumbling
They're the monuments we once built
Finding it harder to believe in something greater
Greater than ourselves

Dig deep and you will find it in your soul
The darkness lives within us all
Do you even recognize yourself

IGNORING THE PATH THEY PAVED
OUR FALLEN HEROES
DESTROYING THEIR LIFE IN DAYS
THAT TOOK A LIFETIME
WHEN HEROES DIE

Dig deep and you will find it in your soul
The temptation calls to us all
I saw myself in you
Do I even recognize myself

IGNORING THE PATH THEY PAVED
OUR FALLEN HEROES
DESTROYING THEIR LIFE IN DAYS
THAT TOOK A LIFETIME
WHEN HEROES DIE

The messenger may fall
Their legacy must live on for all to hear
Let it make you strong
Because even our idols fall

IGNORING THE PATH THEY PAVED
OUR FALLEN HEROES
DESTROYING THEIR LIFE IN DAYS
THAT TOOK A LIFETIME
SO LET YOUR HEROES DIE
