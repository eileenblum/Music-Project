Hey!

Let's go!

Bite your tongue and seize your thoughts
This will not end well for you

Imply innocence
Defy righteousness
Define arrogance

YOU HIDE BEHIND YOUR SELFISH LIES,
COVER UP YOUR HEINOUS CRIMES
YOU CAN'T RUN FROM ME

Now I ask and you will answer
I will not concede
Who are you to play god
Dispose of who you please

Imply innocence
Defy righteousness
Define arrogance

YOU HIDE BEHIND YOUR SELFISH LIES,
COVER UP YOUR HEINOUS CRIMES
YOU CAN'T RUN FROM ME

I LIVE A LIFE WITH ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE
IT IS JUSTICE THAT I CRAVE
YOU CAN'T RUN FROM ME

Justice comes for you

YOU HIDE BEHIND YOUR SELFISH LIES,
COVER UP YOUR HEINOUS CRIMES
YOU CAN'T RUN FROM ME

I LIVE A LIFE WITH ONE FOOT IN THE GRAVE
IT IS JUSTICE THAT I CRAVE
YOU CAN'T RUN FROM ME

Hey!
