Where am I?
Who am I?
Trade me for apathy

My flame is fading away
My fear is increasing
My patience fleeting from me
Faith is far out of my reach

I'm losing hope
My peace is gone
Where am I?
I've lost my home

On the front lines I've seen
No end in sight
Just a wounded soldier
Waiting to die

I am not your hero
I will let you down
I can't save you
And you can't save me

I'm a fallen fighter
With nothing left
My beliefs are dying
I am not your hero
So save yourself
I have let you down
