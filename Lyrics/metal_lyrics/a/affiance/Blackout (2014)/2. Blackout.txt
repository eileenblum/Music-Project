How can you heart what you need to hear
When you have never been told you're wrong?
You see the world in black and white
Blind to all color

YOU ARE LOST INSIDE YOUR MIND
THE WALLS YOU BUILD TO CONFINE MUST RECONCILE
BLACKOUT. AWAKEN IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
I'M CAUGHT BETWEEN WHO THEY EXPECT ME TO BE
THE HEART OF AN ANIMAL OR THE MIND OF A MACHINE

How can you see what you want to see
If your eyes haven't been opened at all
I don't have the answers
I just know it's not as simple as right or wrong

YOU ARE LOST INSIDE YOUR MIND
THE WALLS YOU BUILD TO CONFINE MUST RECONCILE
BLACKOUT. AWAKEN IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY
I'M CAUGHT BETWEEN WHO THEY EXPECT ME TO BE
THE HEART OF AN ANIMAL OR THE MIND OF A MACHINE

No room for maybe
Afraid of the unknown
So we rank and file
To rationalize our existence

Blackout
Awaken
