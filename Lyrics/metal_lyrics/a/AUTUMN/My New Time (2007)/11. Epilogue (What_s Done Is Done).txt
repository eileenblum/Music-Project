In this cascade of memories I wonder what
could have changed, had I changed
Questioning what and why canât undo the day
Yes, I realize...
Whatâs done is done, but the night time raised
the mist to another day in shame

Can I only look back and wonder what
could have changed, had I changed?
Time is ebbing away, but it's in no rush today
Whatâs done is done but the migraine still
persists and the autumn rain remains

Show me the nearest well to drown my discomfort
A shallow pool
A shallow pool of hope will do
Show me the nearest well to wash my tears away
A shallow pool
A shallow pool of hope will do

Can I only look back and wonder
What could have changed, had Iâ¦?
