Many went to the shimmering land of make-believe
and ventured the farthest corners of the mindscape
Merely testing the ice, I never went too far from the safe and solid ground
Afraid of the darkness I might find (underneath)

Exploring the mind to escape from your daily lives,
where you become the head of a state in a state of mind
All links to reality fading
Pandora's box lies waiting
Instead of the roof of the world it becomes a nightmare

We expect perpetual motion, a chain effects
The newfound land out to be a grain of sand (ever volatile)
Searching the edge of consciousness for insights in the outside world
Well conceived, but such rules only apply in this state of mind

The key lies in knowledge, temperance
No magical answers or escapes from reality,
but a marvellous break for a visitor passing through
