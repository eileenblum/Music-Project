A twist, a turn, been lost
more than once too many already
A hit and a run, kicked in too late
to be kicked to the curb again
regardless of the consequences

You have had me
seen me falter, felt me shiver
You have had me
right where you wanted me

You have twisted and turned my life
upside down (and right side up!),
right when all I remained was a footprint
in melting snow
You have seen me slowly disappearing
and yet, here I still remain for all to see
yet I've still not had it
Doesnât it make you wonder how
exactly youâve been playing me?

You have had me
seen me falter, felt me shiver
You think you have had me
right where you wanted me

It turns out
You have had me
seen me falter, felt me shiver
You have had me
right where I wanted me
