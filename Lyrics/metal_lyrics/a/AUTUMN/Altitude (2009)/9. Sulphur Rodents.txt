Trembling, tried and terrified
spell cast with open eyes
to greet and feed me
with a smile you mean and a poison you surely don't
Rushing like rats through my wretched veins
ever faster, promise racing
to bring some foul salvation
to my weakening carnal cage

Skinned by a sulphurous jealousy
spit into wounds that would burn, had I know

Burns of misplaced ill affection
such a sweet addiction
Disintergrating grace
Eating through my weakening carnal cage

Skinned by a sulphurous jealousy
spit into wounds that would burn, had I know

If I could pinpoint a place where I can still feel you
Would you cut it out of me?
Would you please just cut it out of me?

Deny me, get it over with
Do us all a favor, see if I care
Misplace me and I'll grow a shadow
in someone else's life, for all I care

Skinned by a sulphurous jealousy
spit into wounds that would burn, had I know

I fall back in line
pushed, pulled
and await my time
