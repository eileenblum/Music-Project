The streets are silent
A spokesman of the devil waves a hand written letter
Another twist of fate
Shadow by the lamp post
a trench coat in the corner of the eye
Confessions far too late

When the shoulder you cried on collapsed
under weight
did you walk away indifferent?
Hearts and spades know the diamond
cannot be replaced
by the clovers insignificance

My song is silent
The letter shed a new light upon the answers
never questioned
your absences of late
I left the room as the fires rages
erasing words in the fireplace
The streets provide more shelter
when a sacrifice is made

When the shoulder you cried on collapsed
under weight
did you walk away indifferent?
Hearts and spades know the diamond
cannot be replaced
by the clovers insignificance
