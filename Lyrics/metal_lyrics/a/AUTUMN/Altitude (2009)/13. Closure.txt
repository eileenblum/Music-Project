[Bonus track]

[In loving memory of KG and AvdV]

The book was closed so suddenly
and I still don't get the end
A blank page is all that remains
... There should have been much more to come

... Hollow words, too late to share
Looking back, now you're not here
... I will remember you
Guiding me throughout my life
while sacrificing precious time
... I will remember you

While reading back, page by page,
I feel you lived it all
It makes me sad, but deep inside
... It fills me up with endless pride

... Hollow words, too late to share
Looking back, now you're not here
... I will remember you
Guiding me throughout my life
while sacrificing precious time
... I will remember you

I turn the page and start to write
to pick up where you left
And while I write I hope the end
... will fill you up with endless pride

I close the book and turn away
for life's too short, or so you taught me
I know that you will find your way
and closure overcomes the pain

... Hollow words, too late to share
Looking back, now you're not here
... I will remember you
Guiding me throughout my life
while sacrificing precious time
... I will remember you

Closure overtakes the pain
... I will remember you
