Outside the wind is roaring, beyond control or melody
A frantic composition, void of vision, harmony
Pick a leaf to lead the dance to higher skies.
Perceive perfection. Chain reaction. Trigger Me

Break free from gravity. Soar away to mountains and the sea
I adjust to trust in my ability to dance among the clouds.
(and feel complete)

Imagination needs no eyes. Shut your eyes to look inside.
Carried by the wind to spin within the symphony
Reborn to the sky, over clouds of gold I glide
Just one reflection, the last connection. Symmetry.

Break free from gravity. Soar away to mountains and the sea
I adjust to trust in my ability to dance among the clouds.
(and feel complete)

There is no symmetry, no time for tomorrow
There's just me in my skyscraping dream

Break free from gravity. Soar away to mountains and the sea
I adjust to trust in my ability to dance among the clouds.
(and feel complete)
