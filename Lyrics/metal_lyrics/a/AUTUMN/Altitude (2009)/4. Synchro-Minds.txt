The fabric of a dream dissolved, or so it seemed
in the waking light
Exchangeable goodbye
Go on, catch your flight
It's been a privilege
Did we shake hands?

Well, mine were shaking still with the passing
of the last cars of the train
And then the lesser half remained
I surely hope we forged a lasting chain...

That simple, sober style...
Be careful of that smile cause you might hurt someone
And it can't be made undone
Like snow before the sun, or backspace in a message
if you will
The pain residing still
We are so much alike, you and I

Do you know that you radiate like in real life
when visualised by my third eye?
Or even more so

And though we live in different time zones
There is no doubt we are somehow synchronised
Like synchronised minds
Shall we keep this pure and mutual, and ban amorous
spoilers from the game?
'Cause It'd be such a shame...

The tragedy of synchro-minds
may amplify a thousand times
I want to see this through
You know as I do that the unity of synchro-minds
stretches over a thousand miles
don't you feel blue?
I'll be joining you so soon
