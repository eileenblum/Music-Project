Unreal, unravelled
we travelled light
Our minds a vacuum
as time went blank and moved aside
We stepped out of line and changed our bearings
all and everything by the wayside
and all the while chasing our dreams into a new unknown

Sky and limit intertwined
Let's lie with Pan tonight
to rise on phoenix' ashes
we'll cloud a new horizon line

Unreal, unravelled
We've shown ourselves out and take to the back roads
with pillars of dust in our fiery trail
Four eyes fixed on a new horizon
a common dream, or so it would seem
Yet all the while chasing our tails into a new unknown

Sky and limit intertwined
Let's lie with Pan tonight
to rise on phoenix' ashes
we'll cloud a new horizon line

I expected no less, yet so much more
You expected the same, I'm sure
Let's hope tomorrow proves both of us wrong

Sky and limit intertwined
Let's lie with Pan tonight
to rise on phoenix' ashes
we'll cloud a new horizon line

Through clouded covered judgement
into denial of cause
and effect takes a turn
for better or for worse

Sky and limit intertwined
Let's lie with Pan tonight
Sky and limit intertwined
