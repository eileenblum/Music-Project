[Bonus track]

It's on my lips, right there,
on the tip of my tongue
Struck deaf to wiser words
but one word from you
one word will do

Just fine
Just fine
Just speak and I will be just fine
Just fine
One word and I will be just fine

Your words move and mend
make me mind myself
a little more, maybe
We're as right as we are wrong
and I understand

Just fine
Just fine
Just speak and I will be just fine
Just fine
One word and I will be just fine

Focus on your pause between words for a change
Shed light on breaths taken between phrases
before the changes take effect

Watched pity from our balcony
Washed envy down with wine
Talkative, so far from sober
-bless the wine-
I, we feel fine

Just fine
Just speak and we will be just fine
Just fine
One word and we will be just fine

This is all you mean to me
This is all you matter
Remind me to mind myself
just that little more
