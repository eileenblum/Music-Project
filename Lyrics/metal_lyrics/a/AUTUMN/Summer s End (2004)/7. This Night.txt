I see the sky when the clouds move aside

Here I stand in the circle
So quiet and bland
Delegate of the great Goddess
Seducing the pain,
My flesh demands

By flickering flames the witches undress
The touches, the kisses, the astral caress
I see the sky when the clouds move aside

I see the sky when the clouds move aside
I see the stars
Blink in a green light that awakes in me
The witch queen this night

I made love to witches so divine
They let me forget the hurt
When I found the missing link
Between death and rebirth

The power of an enormous might
Struck down on holy ground
Where I made it mine
Trough making love

I see the sky when the clouds move aside
