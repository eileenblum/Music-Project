Flickering flames,
My luscious soul divest
The bitter kisses
In a deep astral caress
Lost in rapture, enigmas revealed
On the edge where reason fades
A martyr of spheres
That take me out of sight

A silent madness grabs me
When I fall in love with shades
Hoping they will dispose me
But they guide me trough my Hades

All my daemons came by
To visit my paradise
At the flood of Chaos
Unleashed my last sight
Lost in a rapture, enigmas revealed
On the edge where reason fades
A martyr of spheres
That take me out of sight

The one who inspires the pain
To the phantasmagoria in my head
