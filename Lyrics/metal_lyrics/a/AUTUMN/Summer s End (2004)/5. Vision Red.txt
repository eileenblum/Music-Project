My eyes slowly close
The light shimmers away
It's the beginning of the journey
Myriads of roads for my sins to pave

The lust has fled into my dreams
As a wayward storm
It's the dawn of a new night
Will it pass without harm

The road runs like a river beneath my feet
Although I am not moving an inch
Only the thoughts, They dance like the tides
A red looking glass unfolds fragments of life
And how I became your willing wife

The ghosts of my future, all answered red
The moment the ring was on my finger
And when you found me in an other man's bed
Did they foretell you about my knight
When the key turned my chastity
Or was it my life destined to be dead

Far away battles
beneath a cloak of red satin
The yearning of lust,
a smouldering fire

All can be dealt with, if I only wake up
The night drops over the shire
The ghosts of my past
are carved in my sight
Wolves howl to the blue moon

Did I deserve this past year
A lone and longing fresh bride
Taking comfort with willing men
When you were gone
Was it your life or death I feared

Do they know the end of my dreams is near
Enforced by the hand of a bearded knight
An answer to the sins of the bed
A short thrust, the dreams fade away,
The knife on the floor has turned deep red,
In the light of the dawn this day
