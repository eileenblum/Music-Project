The temperature sank below zero
And the seas became giant mirrors
And trees formed a crystal splendour
The world is frozen to the core

Take my hand and walk with me
Through the corridors of snow and ice
Through a gallery of reality
History unfolds before your eyes

There, between the exhibited bodies
Framed by frozen blood
Her skin scabrous, once so soft
That must be the one, the one I once loved
