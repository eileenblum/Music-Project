Myths, legends, untold stories
Pass by like successive seasons
Mythical oaths, forgotten glories
They don't happen without reason

Whispering secrets

Thoughts, they seem so common
To me they don't make any sense
Where the essence was undone
Revealed now like celestial winds

About my hope, my life, my agony and strife
The joy and faults, my feelings and thoughts

Whispering secrets exclude that it's just fantasy
Uncommitted to a language is talking without words to me
About my hope, my life my agony and strife
The joy and faults, my feelings and thoughts

The message is easy to hear
Like the call of a goose
Even the invisible signs
Are like water, crystal clear

Whispering secrets
