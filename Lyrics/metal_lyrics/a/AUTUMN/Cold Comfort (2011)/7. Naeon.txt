A Micro-kaleidoscope to take a closer look at the fabric of life.
Crushing depth for all that's familiar.

I've seen time under a different light
And aeons passed without a single sound I liked.

A seashell stethoscope to localize the pulse of all matter
(And all that matters)... Not that it matters.

I've seen time under a different light
And aeons passed without a single sound I liked.
All of my thoughts just seemed to pass me by
When liquid colours and yet another
Changed to change my mind.

Five senses amplified and well in overdrive.
The fourth Dimension,
The slowing down of light.
Event horizon.

Veils of light and dark alike
Lower mine.
Just... stay alive.
