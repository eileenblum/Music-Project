It took heart to stay and share a life.
In return I pledged to keep an eye
On the ravens on the wire,
On the serpents in the mire.

We were lovers you and I.
We loved and time went by.
Eyes are beads and feet are clay.
You would not be scared away.

Fireflies and satellites
In the dead of night
When you warned me:
"There's a snake nearby."
Arms like sticks and hands of hay
Failed us when you slipped away.

Now I'm sad to be alive
And I urge the sands of time:
Send your last remaining grains
Bleeding from my strawy veins.
