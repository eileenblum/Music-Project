A new summer is secretly enchanting
All beings into a slumber
And wild flowers are blooming in abundance
With a vast amount of colour

I'll breathe and I'll be right at your doorstep.
A flower bed will save me if I fall...

The cool shadow is stretching from the hillside
and sliding to the meadows.
Where I'll follow under clouds of sparrows,
My mind fixed on tomorrow.
I foretell the end of sorrow.

I breathe and I am right at your doorstep.
Thoughts are drifting to another time.
I dream we are the last couple dancing.
Let me be the one to hold your hand.
You'll see that I will hold on forever.
Nothing can convince me otherwise.

It's about as much as I can take
Beside the toughts that I can't shake.
Return me to the life that came before this bitter end.

Can't wait to mend our lives,
Extend my time here by your side.
Relieved and unashamed,
Our eyes will find a new horizon.

I breathe and I am right at your doorstep.
Thoughts are drifting to another time.
I dream we are the last couple dancing.
Let me be the one to hold your hand.
You'll see that I will hold on forever.
...Or at least I'll try.
