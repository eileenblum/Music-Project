Grey painted clouds usher in
The dawn of a new day
Lighted a shade floating in sin
A shade that follows one way

Tidings echo through the streets
When minstrels prefer silence
An echo calling from the wharfs
Make the knights stop their feasts

Down by the riverside
Things have become clearer
The master
Of her dreams

Her pale white body wrapped in a web of tales
Laying in a hazy gleam
This beauty brought by 's lands many gales
Died in a chase
In a chase for a dream
And now she floated
Behind the walls of her desires
In a shallop where in life is shed
Her coffin...
