Tiredness and sleep we expound
As a natural urgency to redeem
From the flesh to dwell 'round
And project experiences in a dream

Climb into the astral tree step by step
Meet all the angels and see your God
Rise along ethereal paths, fly into the web
Filled with symbols, representing your lot

See, hear, ethereal levels
Touch, feel, ethereal levels

See, hear, ethereal levels
Touch, feel, ethereal levels

While you move in a deep trance
Stepping out of your earthly shell
Filled with divinity so immense
You're visiting heaven, while you saw hell

Reach the last chakra at the top of the tree
This divine feeling that seizes your soul
In a deep meditation it could happen to me
In a boundless light, you approach the goal

See, hear, ethereal levels
Touch, feel, ethereal levels

Along ethereal levels
