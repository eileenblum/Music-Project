Like the clouds that sail along the endless sky
And roses give out their colour to the air
Like swans that start to sing before they die
I comfort you, surrounding you with care

You bear the cross of guild and of regret
While my fingers seize your pale arms
"Hold me for the last time", I believe you said
Freezing thoughts won't stop me from keeping you warm

The pulsating of the heart goes on and on and on and on...
Weakness becomes the king of thy being
When cathedrals of hope collapse
Pictures of thy life pass by in the last seconds
Never have known the meaning of life
Until it ends...

I sit alone, your head upon my hands
I cry over you while you are feeling free
Cause now you are, you are in the revealing lands
Passed away taking along a part of me

It is hard for me, for me to see you die
Through all the tears, tears that make me blind
It is hard for you, for you to see me cry
And you won't forget those who are left behind...
