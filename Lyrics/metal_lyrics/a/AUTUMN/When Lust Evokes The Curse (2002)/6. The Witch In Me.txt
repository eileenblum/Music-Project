Dans la forÃªt, si noire que la nuit peut Ãªtre, respirÃ©e

In the forest, so black that you inhale the night
Echo transmitted tales of an ancient might
Standing in the circle, surrounded by candlelight
Listening while I'm blindfolded, naked and tied

Praise the seasons, praise the night
Witches teach me how to see
This initiation enlarged my sight
I now found the witch in me

Through the lucid eyes of witches you'll see
The things that man can't see anymore
The origin of life still lives in every tree
That in the witchcraft lies the source of all the lore

Praise the seasons, praise the night
Witches teach me how to see
This initiation enlarged my sight
I now found the witch in me

The salty lips, the fivefold kiss
On my whole body there's no spot they miss
These words, a vow of secrecy
A flagellation, forty times, sealing this

Receive the atheme, its effects will make me rich
Because the seeds of fertility I now sow
I stand the invocation of witch
For complete wisdom there are two more to go

Praise the seasons, praise the night
Witches teach me how to see
This initiation enlarged my sight
I now found the witch in me
