Rush to paint the sea,
Paint a world with me
Unveil the stars tonight
And brush the clouds aside
Oceans waxed and waned,
Still coursing through my veins
Years have come to pass
Since I saw you last
On stranger tides

Gently blowing my way
Shift to silence
Storm of the I
Thunderous crashing waves
Fall on deaf ears
The turning of the tides is a rush of blood away
And raising new questions
Fury upon me
Wasted Enmity
Frozen to the sea
