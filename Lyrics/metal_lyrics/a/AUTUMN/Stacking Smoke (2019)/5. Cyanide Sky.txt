The two of us might
Agree to stay alive
When blue acid skies
Turn green to blight, we might as well

Someone like you might think about it
A sacrifice too great to hold me, dear

Cool down once per fume to a liquid state
(Worth its weight in gold)
Blue and innocent, it meets the eye
(But I won't shed a tear)
Stir it up enough to break the vial
(Pour it far and wide)
Cold and blistering by design,
She'll show her true face

Who'd share a dream so bleak?
Millions of eyes slam shut for an instant dreamless sleep
By ruse, dark drones revealed a cyanide sky,
But why? Have my agents turned on me?

If time would tell? Hell. They might as well.

Scentless vapor trails, the bitter sweet (memory of it all)
Breathe the aerosol, blue and light

When rogue components start taking life
And my chemical agents quadruply
A simple vial contains the beast inside
She'll show her true face

Call off your vessels, dear
Abort your fatal run on our hemispheres
Stand down,
Surrender your arms to mine
And in time, you'll see our industries don't need a helping hand

Who'd share a dream so bleak?
Millions of eyes slam shut for an instant dreamless sleep
By ruse, dark drones revealed a cyanide sky,
But why have my agents turned on me?
