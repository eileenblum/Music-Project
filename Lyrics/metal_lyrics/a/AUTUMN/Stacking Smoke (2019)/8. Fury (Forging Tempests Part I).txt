Shadows to the north
Something's stirring
Clouds amass over unsettling horizons
A new breed of storm heralding
A rainy season,
Raising questions, raising Cain

So cold here, in the eye of the storm
Fury upon me, frozen to the sea
An entity taking shape,
I'm falling prey to solemn waves
Fury upon me, frozen to the sea

I've tried to taken no notice,
But it's edging closer now
Ever closer to awareness,
Seems just a rush of blood away

So cold here, in the eye of the storm
Fury upon me, frozen to the sea
An entity taking shape,
I'm falling prey to solemn waves
Fury upon me, frozen to the sea\

So cold here, in the eye of the storm
Fury upon me, frozen to the sea
Hold on for dear life, our stronghold,
For the storm in my eyes is growing cold
