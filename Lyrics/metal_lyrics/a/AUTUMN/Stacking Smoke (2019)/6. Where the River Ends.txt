Find where the river ends
Linger and make amends
Wash it away in murky waters

Wade in. Sinking. Lonely. You're afraid and
Truly, madly, deeply
Sadly gone

If you value life,
Find where the river ends
Linger and make amends
Wash it away in murky waters
Down by the river's end
We can stop pretending
Or simply wait till life blows over

Wade in. Sinking. Lonely. You're afraid and
Truly, madly, deeply
Sadly gone

If you value life,
Find where the river ends
Linger and make amends
Wash it away in murky waters
Down by the river's end
We can stop pretending
Or simply wait till life blows over

Show me a way to rise above this
Sing me a song that fills the air
Down and away into the water
Sing me a song that fills the air
