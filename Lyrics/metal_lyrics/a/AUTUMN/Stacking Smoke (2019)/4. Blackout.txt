Through blue wine
A thousand days to wither
Tricked by time, we never rest
Promise me that we'll escape together
Thick as thieves in the dead of night

Choose your battles wisely
Pick a fight if all else fails
Trust your instincts, strive to prevail
This blackout is the break that we need
And I will follow to whatever end

Moving in stealthy silence
Muted in our secrecy
Lag behind and we might miss
Our window of opportunity

Dogs and floodlight
We've been made
Aware
Stop right there!

Hide now or make a run for your freedom
Yeild? No. I'll fight until the end
And when it ends I want you gone

Tried ânot hard enough- to save your skin
It's way to much to hide within
You sold your hide to force a truce
I think it's time to start anew
