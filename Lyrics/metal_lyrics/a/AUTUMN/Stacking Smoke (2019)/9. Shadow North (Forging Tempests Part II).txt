Shadow North,
Mark a path for me to steer clear of
If peril had a shape, it would be yours
Shaped only spite and strain
So stake your claim
You've forged confusion,
You've fed me well

Unnerving to leave port,
Venture out in gale force winds
I look to stern and waver
Yet set final sail for the clouds
That shake the old horizon

Shadow North,
Chart a course for me, straight and narrow
For searing tempests charge and lash out at my sight
And howling currents tear at the marrow
You've forged a broken blade,
You've fed me well

Unnerving to leave port,
Venture out in gale force winds
I look to stern and waver
Yet set final sail for the clouds
That shake the old horizon

Spoils of lawless lands lie squandered, given to the sea
Wasted enmity
Given up the ghost that rendered me spineless, willfully
Wasted enmity
Fury upon me, frozen to the sea
Woe is me

Unnerving to leave port,
Venture out in gale force winds
I look to stern and waver
Yet set final sail for the clouds
That shake the old horizon

Unyielding, unwavering,
Headstrong in gale force winds
I look to stern no more
And find my white whale shaped in the clouds
Of my new horizon
