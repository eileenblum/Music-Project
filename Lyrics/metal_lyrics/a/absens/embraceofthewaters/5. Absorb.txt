Life is a river 
And through its course, we flow
Streaming across the edge of time
And then we fade into the sea
But can we stand the turbulence?
Water rages against us

Absorb the impacts of life

Design your way
Stand against the watercourse

Absorb the impacts of life

Realize the pain you feel can make you stronger

Find in your weakness, paths for your own strength
Deconstruct your fears, overcome
Heal the scars, face the rough embrace of existence

Find in your weakness, paths for your own strength

Life is like a river that flows eternally
Streaming across the edge of time
We fade into the sea
Overcome the waves you face
Overcome the pain you feel

Find in your weakness, paths for your own strength

Absorb
Absorb the impacts of life
