Inhumanity still persists
Despite of all disasters we've passed through
The anger surrounds the hearts of men
Lost in time!

Time is changing and so is society
Ignorance among us
Blinding the masses, obscuring their minds
Keeping the violence, setting us apart

Hypocrisy and Fear
Are these the values of our developed society?

Fear is growing, infecting our kind
Hate among us
Blinding the masses, obscuring their minds
Keeping the violence, setting us apart

We kill in the name of god
We kill in search of power
We die for our ideologies are vain

Lack of empathy blind us from
Reality, preventing us from seeing
The suffering of humanity

Chaos above us, darkening our skies
Violence below us
Blinding the masses, obscuring their minds
Keeping the violence, setting us apart

Divided and disgraced
Is this how we will find peace after all?

We are fading in eternal war
Hell among us
Blinding the masses, obscuring their minds
Keeping the violence, tearing us apart
