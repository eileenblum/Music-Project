Searching for a key
I realize there is no way
And now I stand
Here in this hell without hope!

Numbed by regret, it's my own fault,
Look what I've done!
My hands are trembling,
Her body fell and now she's gone

All the pain that I left behind
Is coming after me
I beg for your forgiveness
I've become an aberration

All the pain that I left behind
Is coming after me
I beg for your forgiveness
I've become an aberration

Now I face my test
Now I search for peace

So dark outside,
I'm so afraid to die
Pleasant times and dreams forever gone
The water is dragging me
To the deepest part of the sea
I'm beneath the weight of the ocean

Now I lay to rest
Now I rest in peace
