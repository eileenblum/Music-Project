It's just a matter of time 'till my mind starts tricking me

It's dark outside and I'm so afraid of my own mind
Pleasant times and dreams are gone.
Life slips through my fingers
And time is not passing anymore.

The battle against desires is unfair, the forces of addiction will always be stronger.
Darkness seems deeper, while brightness fades away.

No!

All I want now
Is to finish
With this life
Unbearable pain
Crossing my body
And my mind

Suffer, sorrow
Agony
I don't want this lies
Desolation and despair
Without end

After the storm
A brief moment of clarity
Is there hope in me?
I need to break free from this burden

Is there a way
To get out of
This god damn misery?
I long for an end
A new beginning

What is this?
All this fire
All this chaos
Why does she seems so afraid of me?
Feel my fury
The disgrace, this hell
Surrounding me
Oh my memories

All I want now
Is to finish 
With your life
Unbearable pain 
Crossing your body 
And your mind
