Where the fuck do you get off?
You don't know what the fuck I've been through.
Please try and tell me what I should feel.
Am I supposed to take back every word I said?
Everything he's told you is a lie.

I could tell you about all those times I spent all night crying alone and scared.
You would never believe me anyways because I could never think for myself.
Take a good look a the big picture. Take a good fucking look.

You all think that I was brainwashed.
Every thought and action was not my own.
And you ask why I'm so fucking angry.

"You don't understand. You were too young to comprehend."
How the fuck can you say that to my face?
I'm the one who lived through it all.
