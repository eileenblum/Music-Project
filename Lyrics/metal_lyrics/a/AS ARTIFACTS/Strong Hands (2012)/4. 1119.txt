A wolf in sheep's skin preying on the innocent.
I should have listened when you told me, "You will end up like him."
I won't hang from the ceiling or put a bullet in my brain.
I can't wait to see what happens when I tear your world to shreds.

I know you lie awake possessed by your decisions.
Your mistakes, they will haunt you for the rest of your days.
You swear to yourself that you don't hear a sound
but tonight is not a night that you'll soon forget.

Everything that you say I am you soon became yourself.
At least that's how it seems to me, and how it has since the beginning.
You're a liar, your a cheat, and a fucking fake.

He's got his gun pointed at you tonight.
He's back from the grave to make everything right.
Aren't you glad you left off the light?
A choice so simple could have cost you your life.

Think of the past. Remember the last thing you said to him before he passed.
You fucking show that nobody knows truth lies with him. Secrets decompose.
