Iâve paid my dues and Iâve had enough.
I tried so hard, never getting anything in return.
And I wish, I wish I could change this.
What is it that Iâm doing wrong?

There are so many things that Iâve wanted to say,
And I wonât stop until youâve heard it all.
Nothing held back, nothing in reserve.
I swear that I wonât stop until youâve heard it all.

Systematically decrypting your mind.
I canât keep fighting to keep this alive
When itâs been dead since the start.
Nothing left, itâs all falling apart.
I canât keep fighting to keep this alive.
I canât keep fighting to keep this alive.
I canât keep fighting to keep this alive.
I canât keep fighting this now.

Thereâs only so much I can take before
Iâll realize this will never happen.
Maybe one day youâll see what youâre missing,
Youâre missing in me.

Maybe one day youâll open your eyes
And see just what youâve thrown away.
Tossed aside like a piece of trash,
A relic you donât need anymore.

Save me!
Break free!

Thereâs only so much I can take before
Iâll realize this will never happen.
Maybe one day youâll see what youâre missing,
Youâre missing in me, you're missing in me.

Open the door and let me see your face.
Iâve been around for so long
But I still feel out of place.
And it seems like the harder I try,
The further I fall,
And the longer I sit here
The harder it is to wait for you to call.

Open the door and let me see your face.
Iâve been around for so long
But I still feel out of place.

I canât keep fighting.
I canât keep fighting.
I canât keep fighting.
I canât keep fighting.
I wonât fight this anymore.
