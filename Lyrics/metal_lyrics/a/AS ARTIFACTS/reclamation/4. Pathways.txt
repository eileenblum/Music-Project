When I was young you told me that
Iâd never be what you wanted me to become.
I had my own ambitions and you saw from the start,
You saw that I would never be what you had hoped for.

Iâve always wanted to be someone you could be proud of.
You saw that I would never be what you had hoped for.
Well, thatâs what Iâve become.

As I turn the pages of my memories,
I remember all the things you told me.
You told me to change my ways
Or you wouldnât pleased with me.

Kicking and screaming, I cried out,
"Why wonât you let me be who I really am?"
Iâve got myself figured out inside,
But how do I tell you without you losing faith in me?

As I turn the pages of my memories,
I remember all the things you told me.
You told me to change my ways
Or you wouldnât pleased with me.

I cried out to you in the middle of the night.
Where were you to make me feel all right?
You said to me youâd always be there,
But you were never there for me.

The pathways that I have to choose from
Wonât work for the both of us.
One to suit you, one to suit myself.
The pathway that I choose is my own.

As I turn the pages of my memories,
I remember all the things you told me.
You told me to change my ways
Or you wouldnât pleased with me.
