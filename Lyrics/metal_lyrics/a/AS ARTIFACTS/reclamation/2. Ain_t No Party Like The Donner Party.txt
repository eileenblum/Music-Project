I needed time to think things through.
You took my heart and ripped it in two.
Youâre only human for a while,
So why spend it in denial?

Itâs not that I only loved her face,
I needed her to be a bit deeper.
With that I knew she was worth the chase,
But in the end all she was was a blur.

I needed time to think things through.
You took my heart and ripped it in two.
But youâre only human for a while,
So why spend it in denial?

You took my head and you turned it into rust.
Mislead the pure; all I ever did was help you.
Now all thatâs done, and my heart returns to dust.
Itâs all because you do what you do.

But youâre only human for a while,
So why spend it in denial?

I thought I had it figured out this time,
But it seems like I never really knew at all.
I thought I had it figured out this time,
But I guess I never really knew at all.

I spotted you from across the room.
Our eyes locked and I had to talk to you.
I made my way across the floor,
But by the time I got there youâd started to dance.
You started to dance, so I took your hand.
I led you down a road youâd never forget.
It seems so right but it looks like I played the fool,
And that Iâll always regret.
