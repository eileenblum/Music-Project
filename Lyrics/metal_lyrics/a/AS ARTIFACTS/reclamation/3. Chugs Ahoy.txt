Iâm done with you now.
Canât you see that Iâm all worn out?
Itâs never too late to turn back.

Why canât you see
(This bitter existence, just throw it all away.)
What youâre doing to me?
(Why canât you see what youâre doing to me?)

Iâm done with you now.
Canât you see that Iâm all worn out?
Itâs never too late to
Turn back and let this all fall through,
Because you never knew
How much I wanted to believe in you, believe in you.

I wonât let you hold me back anymore.
I canât let you hold me back anymore.

Iâm done with you now.
Canât you see that Iâm all worn out?
Itâs never too late to
Turn back and let this all fall through,
Because you never knew
How much I wanted to believe in you, believe in you, believe in you.

I see you destroying my self-confidence
With a single glance,
But this was not my intention and I never imagined
That itâd come to this.

You canât go through life
Trying to change the past.
You have to move forward
And see whatâs in front of you.

Sinking ships and burning bridges,
This is dead to me.
Sinking ships and burning bridges,
This is dead to me.
