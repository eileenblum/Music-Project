Iâve been driving for hours now.
I never once thought to turn around.
Iâll drive as long as it takes
To see your darling face.
You are the one Iâve searched for,
The one Iâll beg for more.

Big hearts and teen smarts
Can make you do things youâll regret,
But the time I spent with you
Iâll never forget.

You make me feel some sort of extraordinary.
The thought of weeks without you just seems scary.

Say it like you mean it and Iâll believe it.
I can see it your eyes, girl, how youâre feeling.
Just take my hand and never let go, let go,
And thatâs how Iâll know.

You've got me but do I have you?
I wanna hear you tell me that I do.
You've got me but do I have you?
I wanna hear you tell me that I do.

So run away with me, girl, now never look back.
Just run away with me, girl.
Just take my hand and never let go,
And that's how I'll know.

Itâs the little things you say and do
That make me want to be with you.
Itâs the way you dance and hold me tight,
Itâs the way you kiss and say goodnight.
It just makes me feel like everythingâs all right.
It just makes me feel like everythingâs all right.

Say it like you mean it and Iâll believe it.
I can see it your eyes, girl, how youâre feeling.
Just take my hand and never let go, let go.
And thatâs how Iâll know.
