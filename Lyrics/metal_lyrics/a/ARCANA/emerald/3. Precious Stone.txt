Like the Emerald; defender of chastity
Like the Adamant; hard and unbreakable
Like the Ruby; burning with intensely red
Like the Coral; undestroyable in fire

Like the Sapphir; of celestial nature
Like the Jacinth; a hero divine
Like the Carbuncle; shining like the sun
Like the Topaz; glowing by night

Adorable precious stone of mine
Beautiful eternal, token sublime
Treasured heavenly jewel of mine
Beloved shrine, independent of time
