In the darkest point of life
When all hopes are gone
What used to be so colorful
Is now grey

At night the sky used to be
So full of stars
What used to be so colorful
Is now grey

It's so hard to get out of this cage
When the outside is so much worse
It's so hard to get rid of these chains
As there's nothing left to fight for
