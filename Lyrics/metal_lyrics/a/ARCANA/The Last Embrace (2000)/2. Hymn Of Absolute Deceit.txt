I had a taste of your blood, you had mine
I knew your pain, you knew mine

we were the beauty in all
The growing death inside of me
the knowledge of one
the growing death inside of me
the knowledge of one

I had a taste of your blood, you had mine
I knew your pain, you knew mine

we were the beauty in all
Please let me come in your arms, let me inside
Why punish me, why bring me sorrow
you angel of grief

The growing death inside of me
the knowledge of one
the growing death inside of me
the knowledge of one

Please God let me rest
Please God let me sleep
