The wings of power
spread out in full splendour
I hear your voice alarm
The coming of a new dawn

I see you descend from the sky
Pale face and a sharpened sword

And those who liveth the eternal lie
Shall forever mourn

I see you descend from the sky
Pale face and a sharpened sword

And those who liveth the eternal lie
Shall forever mourn
