Through your veins the blood of mine.
You came with me, we became like one.
You took my hand and followed me,
to the lands of eternity.

The love we had will never die.
"Never fade and become a lie."
You came with me into my realm.
"Into your shadow land."
You are no longer with me here.
"In your land of no despair."
You broke your oath and left me here.
"Without my love and filled with fear."
