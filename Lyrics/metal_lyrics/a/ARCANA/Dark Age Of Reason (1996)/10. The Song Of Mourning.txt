Once again a soul has left us,
Left us with disappointment and questions.

Is this really the solution to all our problems?
Just letting your soul depart from this world!?

I've seen this all before.
It's too late, it's too late now.
There's nothing more to do,

We'll all reunite one day... but until then...

Good-bye.
