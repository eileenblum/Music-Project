We gazed at the sun
one last time
As ashes fell down to earth
Could we see all the signs
Or did we just close our eyes

We watched the stars
just one last time
As our bodies fell
to the ground
Could we have done more
Or were we committed
Limited by greed

Well, now it's too late for our sons and daughters
Can we look upon ourselves with pride
Now it's too late for the earth to recover
Our guilt we can no longer hide
