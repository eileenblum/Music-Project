The memory of a long life
The aching of a love one
The reminiscence of what's been
The feeling of hurting
In Sadness
In Memoriam

The recall of compassion
The longing of your warm embrace
The fear of being left alone
The feeling of sorrow
In sadness
In memoriam

The remembrance of a dark time
The emotions of profound grief
The fear of falling down to deep
The feeling of mourning
In sadness
In memoriam
