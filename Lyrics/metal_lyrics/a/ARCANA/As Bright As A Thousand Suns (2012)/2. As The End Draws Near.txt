It's so hard to believe, that is the end
The end of our journey
But I think it's time to move on
We need something that wakes us up
Something that makes us whole
So it's time to close the door, and leave all behind

Looking back is like staring into the sun
Our paths might cross, but not for long

It's so painful that the fire is almost gone
That we're gasping for air
And we've done this for too long
Perhaps we need to get rid of this weight for a while
Then we might remember how the glow used to feel

Looking back is like staring into the sun
Our paths might cross, but not for long
