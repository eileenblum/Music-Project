Where did the lust for life go?
You have always had it with you
You always held it so close to your heart
Did you lose it somewhere on your way?
You always showed us how it worked with
your smiling face and glimmering eyes
Now there is just a shell left of you and a voice that calls
Leave me be!

Where did the lust for life go?
You have always had it with you
You always held it so close to your heart
Did you lose it somewhere on your way?
- I will never, leave you be!
