You sever all the ties between whatâs right and wrong
You push the blame away because itâs just so hard to bear.
Still you canât admit your pain.
Looking for something new.
Something new to claim and call your own.
Take a look in the fucking mirror, before you cast your guilt.
Before you judge me, take a look inside yourself.
Still youâre to sacred, to take a fucking stand.
Who would have thought after all these years that things would be this way.
I guess you canât expect it to stay the fucking same.
Now weÂ´ re all here and we are staring in fear.
Afraid to make a move.
To scared to fucking breathe.
We werenât meant to be like this x2.
