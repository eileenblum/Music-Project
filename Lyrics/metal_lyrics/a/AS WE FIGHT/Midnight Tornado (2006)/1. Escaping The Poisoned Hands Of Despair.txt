Trapped inside myself and I just cant escape the feeling.
Like someone got me by the throat.
Give me some room to breathe.
Let me be a human being.
Trying to break down the barriers! [x2]
Sometimes I just wanna sit back and learn to live with the pain.
Losing you all is my nightmares.
But we all die alone!
WE ALL DIE ALONE! (kor)
Years down the road weâre still here.
Looking back at all the times we shared.
Seeing how mistakes became lessons.
Counting all the memories.
I know by now that some things have changed.
But in my heart Iâm still feel the fucking same.
