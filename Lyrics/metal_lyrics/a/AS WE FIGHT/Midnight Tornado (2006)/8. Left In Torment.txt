In the wake of hellfire.
Angels will be crucified.
Burning our fucking paradise.
They shall pay the price at the gates of hell.
You never took the time to see things our way.
Now youâre trying to put us down.
Abandoned and neglected, its all so clear to see.
That weâre soaked in the tears of the innocent.
While death is raging through the streets.
Preying on the poor and the weak.
No more will you tell me how to think or act.
Where will run when darkness falls?
Will you kneel and pray for someone to save your soul?
With every breath its Life and death and Nothing less!
Iâll always do my best and Iâll never turn my head away.
