It feels like I'm on a race against time.
Cause there is so many things being shoved down our throats.
Drowning in expectations.
A Prewritten existence.
You canât judge my heart.
When youâre standing from a far.
You got it all it wrong, thinking that you had it all.
cause youâre no different, no different then the rest.
What the fuck do you want from me?
What did you expect us to be?
After all that you pushed us through.
I will never shed a tear for you.
Not a single tear for you.
So save your breath.
Cold hearted.
(pick it up)
Iâm not buying into this shit anymore
So save you breath and kill the lies.
