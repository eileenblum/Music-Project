Rise of rebellion, raising fists, angers ignition
A violent reason, marching forward has begun

What we have seen is the black of our eye
What's endured by the hope in the sky
Bending us backward for the will to break
Nothing is left to lose, everything at stake

Rise of rebellion, raising fists, angers ignition
A violent reason, marching forward has begun

Our self worth, find the will to resist
Something felt, down so deep, can't dismiss
Strength of allegiance, we shall stand and defeat
Pushing them back again, they're forced to retreat

No way out, tyranny's doubt
Run you down, steal your crown

Rise of rebellion, raising fists, angers ignition
A violent reason, marching forward has begun

Absence of state, no fortune, time to rise
Down on our knees, nothing left but to despise
The entitled take control of majority
Penance has come, deprive all authority

Rise of rebellion, raising fists, angers ignition
A violent reason, marching forward has begun

Rise of rebellion, raising fists, angers ignition
A violent reason, marching forward has begun
