Life will flash before thine eyes, the fear will start to grow
It should come as no surprise, the darkness always knows
Ancient shrines inscribed in stone, the powers are bestowed
The dagger points to the black sun, spirits to behold

The blood of the sacred, the tears of a fool
Night of the wolf, a world of skin and bones
We are the mark of the hand of our maker
Night of the wolf, break the spell from the left hand path
The poison tongue of our lord's command

Whispers from the underworld, beneath the forest floor
Protected by the talisman, legend and folklore

The blood of the sacred, the tears of a fool
Night of the wolf, a world of skin and bones
We are the mark of the hand of our maker
Night of the wolf, break the spell from the left hand path
The poison tongue of our lord's command

Sky will turn to black, rain will turn to blood
Night will bury your children, plague of one and all

Beast of man transformed as one, scars carved into souls
The scourge of demons has begun, under a full moon

The blood of the sacred, the tears of a fool
Night of the wolf, a world of skin and bones
We are the mark of the hand of our maker
Night of the wolf, break the spell from the left hand path
The poison tongue of our lord's command
