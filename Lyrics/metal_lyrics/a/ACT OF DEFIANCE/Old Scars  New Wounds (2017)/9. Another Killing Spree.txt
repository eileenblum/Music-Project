What blind eyes see, a fake reality
Awakened from another killing spree

What blind eyes see, a fake reality
Awakened from another killing spree

Your path to hell is led with grave intentions
You're selfish in your ways without redemption
Detached from what is real, a vague existence
Unhallowed fall from grace, a frail man broken

Can't you see what you've become
Can't repair your mangled world

What blind eyes see, a fake reality
Awakened from another killing spree

Living out your last days, the mind of the insane
You pull the trigger yet, you never take the blame
Compelled by your sick rage, the flood gates open...
And much to your dismay, you are forgotten

Can't you see what you've become
Can't repair your mangled world

What blind eyes see, a fake reality
Awakened from another killing spree

What blind eyes see, a fake reality
Awakened from another killing spree

Can't we see what we've become

What blind eyes see, a fake reality
Awakened from another killing spree

What blind eyes see, a fake reality
Awakened from another killing spree
