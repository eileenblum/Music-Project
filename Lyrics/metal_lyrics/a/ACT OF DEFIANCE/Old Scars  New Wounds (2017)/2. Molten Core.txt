Destruction of the planet to gain control
The greed of a corporate nation
Rise to power, bring the change. Create milestones
Fuel for contamination
Speculation of ideas across the globe
We're due for annihilation
Technological command, there's still no growth
Modern day excavation, to the molten core

Catastrophic consequence, put your trust in what you know
Politics protect their interests, so quick to bury their own

Disenchanted and divided, we're at a loss
Emissions in escalation
Media feeds on the weak and the uninformed
Heinous humiliation
Radiation on the rise, there is no hope
Millions of dollars wasted
Contribution from a government, our downfall
Humanity restricted, to the molten core

Catastrophic consequence, put your trust in what you know
Politics protect their interests, so quick to bury their own

To rubble from root, this is our realization
Too rich and too dumb to care
With our bellies full, keep us uneducated
The divisions of disrepair

Eradication of the sun, it's a vast black hole
Demise of the population
Suffer the plague, an age of millennials
The mindless generation
Ignoring all the signs, we take the fall
Ignorant and misguided
Living in a world of oblivion
Arrogant and entitled, to the molten core

Catastrophic consequence, put your trust in what you know
Politics protect their interests, so quick to bury their own
