Erupt like a fire, leave your legacy
To ensure you will live forever more
Death may devour your identity
To me you'll always be an immortal soul
Circle of ashes and smoke

Burn the candle at both ends and live for yourself
Stand up for something
Burn the brightest of embers up to your last breath
The fragments you laves us are transcendent

Preserve the inferno, in a sea of flames
Remember who you are and reveal yourself

Circle of ashes and smoke
Burn the candle at both ends and live for yourself
Stand up for something
Burn the brightest of embers up to your last breath
The fragments you laves us are transcendent

Light the darkness...

A signal in the noise, kindle the coals.
Dignity 'til death, calm before the storm

Circle of ashes and smoke
Burn the candle at both ends and live for yourself
Stand up for something
Burn the brightest of embers up to your last breath
The fragments you laves us are transcendent

Burn the candle at both ends and live for yourself
Stand up for something
Burn!
The fragments you laves us are transcendent
