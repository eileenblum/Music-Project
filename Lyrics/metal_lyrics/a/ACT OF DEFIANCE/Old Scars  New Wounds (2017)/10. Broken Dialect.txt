Foregone conclusion, arguments intrusion
Hatred builds ferocity, impose your views of animosity

Screaming at deaf ears, shouting all our fear
On our shoulders, no burden of proof
A puppet recites their version of truth
Scheming within our spheres, a view that no one hears
Afraid to face, your thoughts are mistaken
Deny the facts our culture's forsaken. Broken Dialect

Culture crippled, unity stifled
Listen to your contending view, letting go, your need to subdue

Screaming at deaf ears, shouting all our fear
On our shoulders, no burden of proof
A puppet recites their version of truth
Scheming within our spheres, a view that no one hears
Afraid to face, your thoughts are mistaken
Deny the facts our culture's forsaken. Broken Dialect

We are strong, undivided. On our own, we're misguided

Integrity in all replete. Corruption, preys on sole deceit

Point of tension, forming aggression
We don't see reality, as we run from uncertainty

Screaming at deaf ears, shouting all our fear
On our shoulders, no burden of proof
A puppet recites their version of truth
Scheming within our spheres, a view that no one hears
Afraid to face, your thoughts are mistaken
Deny the facts our culture's forsaken. Broken dialect
