Kneel before your father, profane hypocrisy
Steal to serve your savior, falling prey to the machine

Sworn to secrecy, a new sovereign nation
Independence becomes world domination

Conspiracy of the Gods
Old scars, new wounds
They're playing you like the pawn
Neglect and misuse

Now no one can save you, cast down from the elite
Heed the cryptic warning, just a cog in the deceit

Sworn to secrecy, a new sovereign nation
Independence becomes world domination

Conspiracy of the Gods
Old scars, new wounds
They're playing you like the pawn
Neglect and misuse

Conspiracy of the Gods
Surveillance of truth
Conspiracy of the Gods
You're left without a clue
Conspiracy of the Gods
Bind and control your world view

Your chalice of faith has betrayed
The cross of illusion is fading away
Now cast aside, left to burn
Lies they've been feeding you - over and over again
Hands to the sky
Seeking the answers yet always denied
No one will hear fading cries
Lies they been feeding you over and over again
