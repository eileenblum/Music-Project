Wait for the camera to roll, you put yourself on trial
You keep on digging a hole, to make your headline
Just when the story unfolds, your status is denial
The weight is taking a toll, just to undermine

We won't be sold - and it's overexposure - no
It won't be long before we pay the price, open your eyes

Selling your soul every day, the curtain starts to rise
Your shallow words are in vain, hide behind the lies
A talking head on a screen, with nothing left to say
To play out the final scene, you've led yourself astray

We won't be sold - and it's overexposure - no
It won't be long before we pay the price, open your eyes

Open your eyes...

Open your eyes...

You prey upon the sheep, all by design you thrive on your...
And with no spine, you thrive on your celebrity

We won't be sold - and it's overexposure - no
It won't be long before we pay the price, open your eyes

We won't be sold - and it's overexposure - no
It won't be long before we pay the price, open your eyes
