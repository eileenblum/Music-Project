Stuck, amidst another illusion, becomes so great that you cannot perceive
See, beyond the hallucinations, you only hear just what you want to believe
Your delusions lead to stark conclusions, enforce more confusion - prophecy
Old convictions create new restrictions, slave to your addiction - the disease

Reborn - beneath the remains you cannot see, the curse is written in blood
Descendant of all iniquity, an omen - our family tree

To learn their true motivation, you pierce the skin for they want you to bleed
Fear, in the throes of isolation, your only haven is the comfort of sleep
Your psychosis is the diagnosis for a higher dosage, that's the key
Thee prescription is the real redemption, from your past afflictions, that you seek

Reborn - beneath the remains you cannot see, the curse is written in blood
Descendant of all iniquity, an omen - our family tree

You channel the fear, enter the unknown
Summon the beast, now you play the role
The pain that you hide, it's slow suicide
The cross you bear is not your own

Reborn - beneath the remains you cannot see, the curse is written in blood
Descendant of all iniquity, an omen - our family tree

You channel the fear, enter the unknown
Summon the beast, now you play the role
The pain that you hide, it's slow suicide
The cross you bear is not your own
