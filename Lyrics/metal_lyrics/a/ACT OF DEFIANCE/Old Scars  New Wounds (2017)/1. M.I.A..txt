Propaganda's the wolf, in shepherd's clothing, lie imposing
Fold your hand for their bluff, conceal the motive, self devoted

Overwhelmed by the noise, of people yelling, falsely telling
The confusion destroys, voices of fact, suicide pact

What do you want from me? Time to stand and voice our rage
Why do you make this decree? In this misinformation age

Playing on your emotions, doctrines standard, leaves us scarred
The gospel to the flock, no contradiction, adoring fiction

What do you want from me? Time to stand and voice our rage
Why do you make this decree? In this misinformation age

Deceit of a fact comes from anywhere
Preying on the want to accept is the snare
Search of principal is not always kind
A loss of its presence and all are in the blind

We fight in a sea of treachery
Our thoughts are poisoned in bias
The plight, seeking truth among perjury
Is cursed by deceit believed

Draw the line in the sand, accepting nothing, never trusting
Origin of wisdom, dissecting sources, one endorses

What do you want from me? Time to stand and voice our rage
Why do you make this decree? In this misinformation age

What do you want from me? Time to stand and voice our rage
Why do you make this decree? In this misinformation age
