A song of daggers, a song of knives.
State what matters, bold faced lies
Psalm of revenge, psalm of wrath.
Sing your motive, lunatic psychopath

Lost in a lullaby of vengeance, no other soul to be found
Cost of yourself condemning penance, no congregation around

Chant of hatred, chant of contempt.
Your stab at friendship, a failed attempt
A hymn of folly, a hymn of spite.
Your lunacy, harbor your ruthless plight

Lost in a lullaby of vengeance, no other soul to be found
Cost of yourself condemning penance, no congregation around

Chorus of your indignation,
In the depths your thoughts dwell
A chanting voice of resentment,
The flawed conclusion of your hell

Can't you listen to all around.
Thought remission, but disdain found
You only see reasons to hate.
Actions define your loathing traits

Anthem's anger, anthem's fight.
Can you feel it? A stinging slight
Air of closure, air of the end.
The final cadence, nothing to condescend

Lost in a lullaby of vengeance, no other soul to be found
Cost of yourself condemning penance, no congregation around

Chorus of your indignation,
In the depths your thoughts dwell
A chanting voice of resentment,
The flawed conclusion of your hell
Choir sings contempt and loathing,
The stifled words you cannot tell
Ballad of emphatic voices, the barren soul of the impaled
