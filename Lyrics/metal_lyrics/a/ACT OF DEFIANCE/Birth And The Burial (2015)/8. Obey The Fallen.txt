There's no resolve - revenge for blood
Bravery becomes your disguise for war
Freedom is forced - What is it worth?
Wear the scars with pride, disregard the hurt
Into the fold - been through the worst
Society just throws you away like dirt
The banner is torn - This land is not yours
They've come to take everything you are

Struck by aggression, you're not real
Just an illusion - Exit here
Obey the fallen, fight and kill
Your execution - line starts here

Do what you're told - Torn from your home
Withstand all the suffering that you've caused
Have no remorse - Feel nothing more
Hide your pain, prepare for the final course
Waiting your turn - No matter the cost
You give your life, admit to yourself you've lost
Watch the fields burn - Forget who you are
Reveal all your hopes and dreams are gone

Is this retaliation? Another soldier is scorned
Bow your head, ask forgiveness
The inevitable - Your exit here
Fail to follow - heart so hollow - heartless
Fail to follow - heart so hollow - exit here

They take control - Bound by the law
Traded in your family for a gun
Damage is done - Hell here on earth
Sworn to die with honor, hero to all
