Choice made to step on backs, to stop at nothing, until the spine cracks
Ground laid forsaking all, sneaking in the shadows, emerge, standing tall
No thoughts of effect, the cause is always greed the rest you neglect
Say goodnight to the world, the problems you caused unravel unfurl

To stop at nothing
Fulfilling hope
And those once thursting against the ropes
To kill the empathy
Devise your scheme
You're burning anyone, for your poison dream

Decimate!
Escalate!
Your thoughts and goals would have everyone filled with hate
Designate!
Devastate!
The sign of damage not seen until it's too late

The crime, when it's all said and done who's at fault?
Your right like a victim condemned, an assault
Your dark thoughts of victory, we are all scarred
Forgot, those so simple for you to discard

[Solo]

To take and deceive
An act of kindness, is more than you conceive
Dry lake of emotion
Sympathy for others is a foreign notion

To stop at nothing
Fulfilling hope
And those once thursting against the ropes
To kill the empathy
Devise your scheme
You're burning anyone, for your poison dream

Relegate
Delegate
Putting goals over other others, in extreme

Desecrate
Total hate
A forewarning  for the poison dream!
