Vengeance, strike you down with no apology
Penance, for the depth of my psychology
Reaching out, trying to find a place to exist
Presence, the moment's struggle slowly consuming me

[Solo]

Silence, buried inside the secrets we all hide
Essence, all the good within but can't abide
The light once had, crushed under black skies
Remnants, hopes and dreams ignite, come alive!

Legacy, what would you have me to be?
Jealousy, the shell is all that's left to see
Heresy, leave me to my misery
Remedy, confront my pain peacefully

Legacy, what would you have me to be?
Jealousy, the shell is all that's left to see
Heresy, leave me to my misery
Remedy, confront my pain peacefully

I see myself

Falling, into a dead stare
The mirror's grimace is more than I can bear
Calling, out in the cold dark air
Does anybody hear me? Like I'm not there!

[Solo]

Falling, into a dead stare
The mirror's grimace is more than I can bear
Crawling, out of the dark despair
Rising from the ashes sinister ensnare

Legacy, what would you have me to be?
Jealousy, the shell is all that's left to see
Heresy, leave me to my misery
Remedy, confront my pain peacefully

[Solo]

Acceptance, for regrets that past cannot be changed
Riddance, shed the skin of thoughts once deranged
Through the dark, shards of light pierce the cloud
Reverence, avoid the mirrors glances and the shame

Crawling from a dead stare
Forestalling a dead stare
