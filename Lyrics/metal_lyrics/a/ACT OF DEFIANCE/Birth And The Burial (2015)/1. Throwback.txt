Stuck, a relic in time
Dated, erase from my mind
Your words have no merit
Whisper from the past, grin and bear it

Actions, horrid things you do
Court jester playing the fool
Hypocrite in your belief
To all you're nothing but a thief!

But a thief!

Time has come
Penance for things you've done
Lies spilling from your teeth
Spewing up from beneath
You're a throwback!
Nothing but a throwback!

Winding back the hands of time
Taking back what is mine
Life no longer will I give
Another sucker to help you live

Your presence makes me sick
Spreading lies, think it makes you slick
On the table, nothing to offer
Morally bankrupt, empty the coffer

Casting out the line
Friendship torn, we pay the fine
Put us all on the hook
For the lives that you took
You're a throwback!
Nothing but a throwback!

THROWBACK!
THROWBACK!
THROWBACK!
THROWBACK!

Bad blood, on the wall
Shouts echo through the hall
And though, you can't see
Your absence I decree

Dagger, in the back
Cold blood, soul of black
Live and learn, we're all heard
On your own, the absurd

[Solo]

Cockroach under my foot
Scurrying away with what you took
Back from the filth, which you came
Stealing ideas for your acclaim

Parasite bleeding out my vein
Diminishing the soul as you drain
Weakened will, you're left with doubt
It's at this time I cast you out

Talking behind our backs
Making allies with false facts
The circles that you spin
Confusion, chaos, you can't win
You're a throwback!
Nothing but a throwback!

Vulture picking through the scraps
Rummage around your hopes collapse
Picked to the bone no more to swallow
Retribution soon to follow

Virus spreading though the human race
Disguised as a friend as you dry to save face
The fever runs its frantic course
Rooting you out at the source

Hourglass of fate
Falling sands as you berate
Kinship only as it serves
Wretched friendship no one deserves
You're a throwback!
Nothing but a throwback!

Bad blood, on the wall
Shouts echo through the hall
And though, you can't see
Your absence I decree

Dagger, in the back
Cold blood, soul of black
Live and learn, we're all heard
On your own, the absurd

THROWBACK!
