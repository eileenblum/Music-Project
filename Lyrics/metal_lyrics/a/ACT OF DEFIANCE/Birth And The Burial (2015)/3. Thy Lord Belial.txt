Forcing out the lies upon those believers seek the truth
Banished by the blood that now flows
Chosen are the few that make the rules
Justify in denial, disguising all the clues
Enter the place of no return
Sacred scars thy lord Belial

Strike me down, evil unseen. Renounce the crown
Buried beneath. Strike me down, death of a dream
Nothing to redeem (Falsehood of Hope)

Remain in the darkness, one knows there's nothing to see
Sinking from below corruption, souls converge
Sinful supremacy
The Masters heard through thunder, Altar of deceit
Relics of our final rapture, Sacred scars thy lord Belial

Immaculate, the infernal son, Throne of the adversary
Infliction, the iniquities, Abomination &amp; decay
The innocent immoral one, Damned in th court of the king
Dissension &amp; impurity, False deity
