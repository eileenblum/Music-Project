Sound of th psalm, light before dawn
Born into a symphony of snakes
Nothing beyond, the cold winter's spawn
Our enemy approaching closer

One kneads earth &amp; clay, blessing made of dust
Flowers wilt, only left with the thorns
The ravage sky shakes, falling leaves of rust
Crimson word we sing is our only (broken) song

War between worlds, the right side of wrong
We are the atrocities unnamed
United by arms, dagger &amp; sword
Years will never bring us closure
Souls slain under the crimson psalm
The darkest hour is ours

The cleansing of mankind is past due
Ten thousand horns are overheard
The scene of destruction is all we knew
Our broken bloodline says it all
Extinction of our time, the only truth
The cries of rebellion and shattered youth
Rise from the fog and save us all

The killing floor, bonded by blood
Lost beyond the reverie and pain
Fight for the cause, we've come so far
We shall never be forsaken
