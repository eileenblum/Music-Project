So we are born to devolve
Conceived to abide the deceiver
Abhorrent oppressor you are
Condemning them all, fake redeemer
Descendant of fire
The rebel angels: they bear witness
Brace for destruction
The human spiral commences now

The inconceivable dream
The hope, it fades from your eyes
Humanity is degraded... by a legion of lies

We are no slaves to resistance
Leads you to the fading light
No man's land where the human vice turns
Lost and there's no end in sight

Cleansing our wounds in the blood
Advocates of utmost evil
Speak of a savior in tongues
Banish him with your betrayal
Command the disciples
The remnants of all bastard children
Punish and prosper, initiation starts now

A moral and all-knowing God
Born to lead us to damnation
Condemned to the afterworld
Disgraced by the congregation
Vile in his sermon, principle of his existence
Fed by corruption, forbid the profane
We're your flesh now
