Silently it came, as from the embers a flame...

Devoid of vital light
Never-ending northern night
Embraces our sails
As we're crushing the waves

And inner flame of hope
Falters with each flow
Yet with each ebb it grows
Shall it burst out, if not - we're lost!

In every storm there's a light to behold
A sign of hope as the story unfolds
As every night has to give in to day
All that we fear will soon fade away!

And as our bodies perish in flames
Valhalla opens its gates...

And as night draws its veil
O'er the way, leaving fear
Neither hearts will tremble
Nor shall break the will!

Lest inner flame of hope
Turn to embers gold
And never cease to guide
Our sullen hearts to Valhalla's Fire!

All I see is darkness
And all I feel is pain
Oh Gods, am I dead or am I insane?

[Finale]
With embers our story ends
The Tale of Fire and its undying breath
All sorrow and pain we didn't suffer in vain
For in the scorching of pyre brighter future unveils

At Valhalla's mighty gates!
