Years I've walked beyond the horizon
And suddenly I had a dream
A dream of the fallen and future king
No crown, no land in his power
And nothing left for him to be
In voice full of sorrow
He spoke to me

Open your eyes, what do you see?
Only way out is through window of dreams!

So he spoke and so I have followed
My heart on a journey afar
Through oceans of sorrow and sands of time
Forlorn is path that I wander
But shadows won't poison my eyes
For each time I falter
I shall arise!

Fear not my child, embrace what you see
Only way out is through window of dreams!

Run through the forest, so silent at night
Give way to your sorrow for freedom's divine
Cherish each moment of life that you have
And when darkness comes for you, leave the forest your breath!
