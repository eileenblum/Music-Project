Arise! My blood, Children of Fire
Let your fury breathe, awaken desire
Scent your prey in the dead of night
Still is time just before the strike

Silence arose in fear
Justice falls in the name of the divine!

The night has come
Swallowed the sun
Enfolding hearts in fear
Wildfire Within

Led by Fire burning deep inside
Fight the guardians of the dying light
For nothing shall forever last
But this Fire in our unsullied hearts

The night has come
Swallowed the sun
Enfolding hearts in fear
Wildfire Within

We'll light the flame
Through hate and pain
The beacon of our will
Wildfire Within our spirits enthean!

Come, guide the way
Through the days of dismay
Let the darkness be torn asunder
And new dawn appear from the night!
