Fallow plains embraced in snow
Ancient fields where cold winds blow
Ne'er before witnessed the scent of blood spilled on the ground

But its innocence now fades
Slashed with northern blades
To the symphony of vicious howls and battle cries

Slay them with a thunder
Throw into the sea
Sacrifice your enemies' blood
Odin it's all for Thee!

Slay them with a thunder
Throw into the sea
Sons of Thor into battle we ride
Valhalla awaits for me!

As the prophecies foretold
By the hammer they will fall
In blazing fire they're burning still in throes of death

But the bloodshed's never o'er
Which is what we're craving for
For heathen lands shall always stay in righteous hands

Fight! For their demise!

I am the light which from dark skies descends
To tear fallen 'way from the night
For fate of the Nords carries burial in flames
A prelude to eternal fight
Fear neither damnation nor blade of your foe
For none shall evade hand of gods
Embrace in your heart there is truth to behold
I tell you the pagans will fall!

They will fall!
