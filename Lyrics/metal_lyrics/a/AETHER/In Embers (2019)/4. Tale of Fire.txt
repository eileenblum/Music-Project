For years we've fought
With foes of our Lord
They fell one by one, all glory was ours
No one withstood our sacred willpower

Those times are but gone
Our magic we've lost
As traitor turned his back on the light
Thus broke our vow to serve the fire

Yet from the shade
A hero emerged
He hit the trail and gathered the grails
And all of a sudden our blessing returned

Now reunite
The warriors of light
Those who have crossed frail border of death
The sons of fire, descendants of flame

Fire, light in the mountains and ocean depths
Fill our hearts with your fiery breath
Ravage our fears and bless us with strength
So we'll light up the darkness, oh

Fire, blood of the warriors, seal of their fate
Be our guide in the days of dismay
Carve our paths and straighten our ways
And we'll light up the darkness again!
