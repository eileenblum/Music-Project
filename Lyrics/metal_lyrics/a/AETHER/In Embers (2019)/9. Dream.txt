In world of dreams we wander
Mere shadows in the night
Bereft of any guidance
Our journey's undefined

In fear of true deception
We slowly drift away
From stillness of the river
To shadow of the flame

As words have lost their meaning
Our feet will lose the way
And hope begins to wither
Like dreams of yesterday!

Now my spirit, arise!
From this slumber of lies
May your soul never bide
Leave the shadows behind!

In world of dreams we wander
In shadow of the light
We shed all our defences
To leave our lives behind

"Come, walk with me in silence"
A whisper calls my name
And distant echo voices
Lost dreams of yesterday!

Now my spirit, arise!
From this slumber of lies
May your soul never bide
Leave the shadows behind

Drift away with the flame
Embers guiding the way
May your soul never bide
Break the circle of life!

"Birds are silent for the night
Dreams turn in as daylight dies
But one soul lies anxious, eyes wide, awake
Bright embers in the rain..."

[Dream and the Waking]

I open my eyes
A flash of light pierces through my thoughts
Never-ending night surrounds my heart
As I emerge from the dark

Fear of oblivion returns
In chaos of thoughts insanity reigns
Oh, lost I am in this etherial realm
Alone between Heaven and Earth
Where traces of past erase
Starlit skies, guide my way!

[Journey of Creation]

I see the light and fall...
Oh Creation, we'll bring a new dawn!

From darkness arise winds of fire and ice
With your veil embrace the Earth
And the navy blue skies cover all mountainsides
Guardians of ocean's domain
Let the forests and trees shadow rivers and seas
Let the spirit prevail the soil
And the essence of life fulfill this World!

[Aeons dreamt away]

As time spun the circle of life
Aeons have passed, stars fell from the sky
The vision fades in the blissful embrace
Of fire burning my veins
These eyes won't see you again
'Cause the Dream I live must end!

Time fades away
And I'm still unaware
If I'll ever be awake...
