In world of dreams we wander
Mere shadows in the night
Bereft of any guidance
Our journey's undefined

In fear of true deception
We slowly drift away
From stillness of the river
To shadow of the flame

As words have lost their meaning
Our feet will lose the way
And hope begins to wither
Like dreams of yesterday!

Now my spirit, arise!
From this slumber of lies
May your soul never bide
Leave the shadows behind!

In world of dreams we wander
In shadow of the light
We shed all our defences
To leave our lives behind

"Come, walk with me in silence"
A whisper calls my name
And distant echo voices
Lost dreams of yesterday!

Now my spirit, arise!
From this slumber of lies
May your soul never bide
Leave the shadows behind

Drift away with the flame
Embers guiding the way
May your soul never bide
Break the circle of life!

"Birds are silent for the night
Dreams turn in as daylight dies
But one soul lies anxious, eyes wide, awake
Bright embers in the rain..."
