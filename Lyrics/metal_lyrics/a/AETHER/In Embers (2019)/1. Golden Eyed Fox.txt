Arose from embers to the fire
My soul as oak shall never break

Storms surrounding lonely pyre
All life should fall to my command

For I am a whisper in the silent dawn
A light in eye of fiercest of the storms
A gift from the gods!

I am breath, a promise of life
And I am a cloud in the starlit sky

In flames of sorrow I'll bind your spirit to my soul
Here in my hands you'll face the fiercest of the storms

My Golden Eyed Fox!

Surrender to fire
May forgotten embers give in to the night
In flames bathe innocence's pyre
Leave dust to the ashes and follow the light!

Tears of the son, his softly whispered words
Somewhere in time, the fire ceased to burn
And as aeons pass by fade his softly whispered words
Somewhere in time
I'm alive!

I am the Storm
The fiercest of them all!
