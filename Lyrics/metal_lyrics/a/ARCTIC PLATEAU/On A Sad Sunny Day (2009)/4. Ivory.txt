Other worlds I have seen indeed
And a shiver in a breeze
Has made me fall asleep
On a fresh evening of spring
Your life has been as ivory
And your shoulders now have big free wings
In my life...
Your shoulders now have big free
Is there someone who still understands a moving soul?

...And that left soon...
