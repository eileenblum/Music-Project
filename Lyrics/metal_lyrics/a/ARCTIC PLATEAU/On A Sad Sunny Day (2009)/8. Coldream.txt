Why do you not remember who you are?
Why do you not have your old watches anymore?
You have lost the road and your car
Now it's too cold to get back without dying
I am waiting for the afternoon
By now, it's true
Without dying
And I will leave soon
By now, it's true
Coldream
And I will leave soon
By now, it's true
Coldream... Coldream...

L'amore Ã¨ altrove,
Risoluto e distinto,
Dentro un sogno di ghiaccio,
Spoglio dell'immemore ricordo
Di quando ti gettasti via dalle mie braccia,
Impetuoso ed ineluttabile,
Come impetuoso ed ineluttabile fu il divenire,
Quando questo prese forma
Dissolse le nostre anime,
E pose fine a noi stessi,
Ridefinendoci,
Nel tempo... Nel tempo...

I am waiting for the afternoon
By now, it's true
Without dying
And I will leave soon
By now, it's true
Coldream...Coldream...
And I am still dreaming of us, Coldream.
