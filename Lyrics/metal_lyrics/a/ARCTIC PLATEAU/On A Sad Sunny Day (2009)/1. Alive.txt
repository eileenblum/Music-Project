I am so inspired by the sadness that I feel I have found the joy
Would you like to be able to dream what I dream?
Are you crying?
As if this sky could dry the sun from its rays
Ask me if I'm a liar
Did you think I was dead?
It's time not to cry anymore!
Didn't tell you a lie
When I told you that I am still alive.
... Still alive.
