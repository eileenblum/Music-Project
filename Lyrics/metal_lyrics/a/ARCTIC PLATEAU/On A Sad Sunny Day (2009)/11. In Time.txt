Today I clearly see
What we are
And what we'll be.

But I don't forget that dream of love
But I don't forget his words.

Dying
What is your wrong?
I am trying to call
Is there anyone
Who will throw you down?

I am not scared of the sun
I am not afraid to die
But I listen
All around.

And my strange pleasure
The way of seeing things
He doesn't make me feel
So alone
Alone.

Today I clearly see
What we are
And what we'll be
I'm trying to heal your memories
I'm trying with the water of the sea.

In time...
I'm waiting for you
And on this sea we will love ourselves
As if nothing was
Finally far.

And you will come with me
And you will be with me.
