On a sad sunny day
And drops of time could rain
Drops of time could make us blind
We shouldn't give up on our lives
We could cope even with a sad sunny day inside
We should never have met
We should never have lived together.

No more shadows on your sorrow
Setting us free.

Inside your smiles, once again
Inside your eyes when you used to look at me.
