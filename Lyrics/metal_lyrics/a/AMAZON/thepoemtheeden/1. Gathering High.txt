Strong energy surrounds the claring
Gathering bests from the coldest seeking
Faries fly around the claring
Where all creatures shall be meeting

[Bridge:]
Movements are shadows at the moonlight
Forces bound to prevent the fight

[Chorus:]
Dancing, cheerful faries
On the rainy bright night
Telling old scary stories
Of the world's gathering high

The Gathering on the highest mountain
Followed by a deep blue sea
Creatures looking for the fountain
So dark and light they may again see

[Bridge:]
Let the magic take place tonight
Let the shadows appear at the moonlight

[Chorus:]
Dancing, cheerful faries
On the rainy bright night
Telling old scary stories
Of the world's gathering high
