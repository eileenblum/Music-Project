A bright day, a cold river's flow
A red twilight over ripples alive
A perfect time, with no time at all
Feelings still in an unheard sigh

The hills aside watch the crystal shore
The waves that fondle my bare feet
A lonely heart within an endless world
Where only the purest beauty belongs

The place all go, the hideaway all will return to
The virgin and the filthy just follow the one path
To the only home they know

Now all I crave is to be here a little longer
Just to hear the air weeping the enchanted song
The Poem And The Eden

And with a little sorrow
Beneath all my dreams above
My spirit wanders free
