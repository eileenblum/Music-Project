Waiting in despair to feel alive
Emptiness is a riot of feelings
Rising among stars to survive
To replace what dies in the circle of life

[Bridge:]
Planets frozen for a moment in time
Showing the system the perfect line

[Chorus:]
Starts the quarrel for light
All you feel is eternity
Stars can't shine, it swallows the light
Trapped in this extreme gravity

Despite all the mass inside
Nothing can be changed just stay alive
Feeds itself like a parasite
To fulfill what dies in the circle of life

[Bridge:]
Planets frozen for a moment in time
Showing the system the perfect line

[Chorus:]
Starts the quarrel for light
All you feel is eternity
Stars can't shine, it swallows the light
Trapped in this extreme gravity
