A little Manchild crawling
With his mother beside him
Conducting the innocence
Through the beginning

A little note for our hope
Not Ashes of our destruction

Finally trusting his blinded mind
Counting the days of his life

The little manchild turns into a man
And his mother is no longer there
To conduct his innocence
Through the beginning

A little note for our hope
Not Ashes of our destruction

Finally trusting his blinded mind
Counting the days of his life

So I sing this song
For the meaning of his life
So I play my life
Just how the song must be

Finally trusting his blinded mind
Counting the days of his life
Finally trusting his blinded mind
Counting the days of his life
