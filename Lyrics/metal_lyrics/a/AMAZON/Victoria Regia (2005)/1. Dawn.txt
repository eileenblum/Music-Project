Arriving is my destiny
In a white horse I ride
Hoping Faithfully
With the sun by my side
The wind is blowing strangely
The night becoming bluer
Signs of an amazing storm
Coming fast

Oh white and shiny riders
Save the city from the fire
Pray to the child to become
My blood rose desire

Oh fight till death
Save the princess from the fire
Oh pray to the child
Cause you are my blood rose desire

The colors in the sky
Are disappearing as I ride
Creatures appearing
With wings to fly
A battle in the dawn
With dragons in black
Riders with swords
Colored in red

Oh white and shiny riders
Save the city from the fire
Pray to the child to become
My blood rose desire

Oh fight till death
Save the princess from the fire
Oh pray to the child
Cause you are my blood rose desire

Oh fight till death
Save the princess from the fire
Oh pray to the child
Cause you are my blood dark desire
