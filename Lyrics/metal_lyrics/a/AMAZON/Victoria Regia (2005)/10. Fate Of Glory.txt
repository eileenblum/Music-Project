In the victory's day
The queen dances
Through the night
Singing to the stars

[Bridge:]
Oh, file of wonders
Sigh through path
Free tou story
This unwished vain glory

Proclaiming god a simple rain
She gave her folks
A little of her bitter pain

[Chorus:]
Life's up to the shore
Unseen madness come around
Bring hope into her lore
Such idol will be found

Despair showed again
Tears fell on the floor
Like the rainbow knocking on my door

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
