Fighting for the truth
Is a heart in despair
Proclaiming Through the air
Is a soul crying in vain

Murdered by a knife
In my own bedroom
It's a lonely life
With blood on the floor

Surrender to my heart
Surrender to my soul
Surrender to the world
Just Surrender

Heaven is full of angels
And hell don't even exist
Where is justice
There is no notice

Scream to be fair
Proclaiming rain
For no more pain
Just face it

Surrender to my heart
Surrender to my soul
Surrender to the world
Just Surrender
Surrender to my heart
Surrender to my soul
Surrender to the world
Just Surrender
Just Surrender
Just Surrender...
