Observing religiously his moves
Dark shadow swallows the night
Blood melt the coldest ice
During the endless fight
Children and women cried
Shedding their tears on the earth
Crosses and music on air
Scene seems not fair

[Bridge:]
See all the flags
On the stormy day
The rain washed
All moonlights ashamed

[Chorus:]
Sometimes he comes
To save your dreams
Sometimes he goes away
You'll see

Almost blind
He edges to the spark of time
Almost blind
He edge to the end
Darkest eyes so full of hate
Some say he is the angel
Among the dead

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
