Sadness rain in the forest
Like flowers in the field
Where the beauty filled
A castle with happiness

The rain came furious and fearless
Because the beauty ran the night before
Leaving all her love behind
In a suspicious madness

[Bridge]

By the window stood a mirror
By the mirror a red rose
What turn in into a black one
Nobody Knows
His souls is still there
Naked in a storm web
Restless since the day she left
Trapped for eternity

[Chorus]

No love or battle
Can make knight come out the mirror
No blood or flowers
Can make him live again
