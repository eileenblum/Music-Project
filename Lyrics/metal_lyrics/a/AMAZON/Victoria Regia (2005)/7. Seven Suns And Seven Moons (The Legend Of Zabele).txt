Oh, sad and true love
Forever spellbound to fly
Day and night, night and day
Singing this pain lullaby

Born as our quest
To play and lay in the forest
Walking hand in hand
Living in tenderness

But our love was torn apart
(Cursed by everyone)
After so much slaughter and war

Seven suns went by
And so did seven moons
Not even the raindrops could wash off
The betrayal scars carved in my heart

Eternity comes to show
Love can betray and die
Through the woods, now and forever
Three broken hearts wander by

Singing this pain like deadly enemies
Are the wonderful birds and all the brave animal
Showing that love can be cruel and kill
Singing that love can forever last
