I remember all the things we went through
The laughing and the fights
We were one
We were all

Lately I cried alone
No one could make em at home
Lately I realized
How fragile was your life

Nothing will take your remembrance
No one is going to replace you
Embrace me
Make me go on once more

I remember the first kiss
And the tender time we made love
We were one
We were all

Lately I realized
How much you loved me
When you didn't want me near
Near the end

Nothing will take your remembrance
No one is going to replace you
Embrace me
Make me go on

Everything I did was for you
But now is gone forever
Embrace me
Make me go on... once more
