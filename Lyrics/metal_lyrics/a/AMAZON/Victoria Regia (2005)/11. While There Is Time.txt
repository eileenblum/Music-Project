Walking down the street
Hearing only the beast
Of a confusing night
Where right and wrong turns up fight

Nothing else in mind
Seeing all the people like blind
To the final line

Prayers pray to be saved
While there is time
Sinner show the prayer how to win life
While there is time

The world is ending
And sex is no allowed
Turn this pages, hurry
Screaming loud

Nothing else is taboo
Be yourself in your soul
Because there is where you will hold

Prayers pray to be saved
While there is time
Sinner show the prayers how to win life
While there is time
