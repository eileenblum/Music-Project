Sweet and little girl
What have you done?
Once lost in the beauty of the day
Now found in a dark cage

You planed to kill every one
But something got wrong
You greed was too big
And you love only a excuse

[Chorus:]
The sun is coming up
And the judgment day is near
How can you get loose
If there is no one there?

What have you done for love?
Who are you now?
What have you come for pleasure?
There's nothing more to show?

How could you let your soul die
Don't even try
Your life was just another lie
Don't deny
