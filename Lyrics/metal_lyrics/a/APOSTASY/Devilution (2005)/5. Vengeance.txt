Determined for vengeance he was
Sold to a nation cold!
Raised out of ashes and crime
Stiff-necked and remorseless
Futility's womb bears fruit again
Burning like a cataract in those eyes
Inhaled the strength of evil prevail
A figment of the brain was what you were told
Proclaiming your insanity to carry out the surgery

No feelings left aside there's only life and death
A non existing man that kills for no reason
You makes me fucking sick!

Obtain pure terror for the greater good
Feast of human sorrow and enjoy others suffering
Pretend to be the savior, the holy masquerade, you bathe in others blood

What did you do to me? I don't know who I am and more
We didn't do nothing you were sick and needed help, some serious help
This has gone way out of our hands, we need to end this properly
You can't do like this there and law's and orders to be followed!

Determined for vengeance he was
Sold to a nation cold!
Raised out of ashes and crime
Stiff-necked and remorseless

Futility's womb bears fruit again
Burning like a cataract in those eyes
Inhaled the strength of evil prevail
A figment of the brain was what you were told
Proclaiming your insanity to carry out the surgery
