Day after day my subconscious screams at me
You are a withering god!
A fix for the fun, a fix for the ritle, this feeling it drives me insane
Burning like fire I am empty again how can I leave this hell
How can I leave this hell!

I feed I breed my enemy, I feed I breed my enemy
Bad blood runs in my veins I'm devoted to this killer of pain

I feed I breed my enemy, I feed I breed my enemy
Bad blood runs in my veins I'm devoted to this killer of pain
Mother of malformation would you care turning the table?
Disgust isn't world enough, but still I care for you!

Mother of malformation would you care turning the table?

Look at those empty shells, manufacture by evil nature
Disgust isn't word enough, but still I care for you!
Are you the one that hates yourself, who pulls down the trigger that ends your journey?

Are you the one that hates your self to pull down the trigger to end your life forever?
Forsaken your life for him and nobody wants to feel

Are you the one that hates your self to pull down the trigger that ends your life forever?

Forsaken your life for him
And nobody wants to fell

Are you the one that hates your self to pull down the trigger that ends your journey forever?
Are you the one with the sulphur rain I should have killed you a long ago!

At least you piece of shit you should have killed your self instead of fed on others life
Instead of fed on others life, instead of fed on others life, instead of fed on others life!
