Paint that scornful smile of your fucking face
We are all just numbers to be erased and rewind
An eye for an eye salvation is denied
Defrost your malignant mind and ride the wave of hate

Scatter the trails of the holocaust what a
Creed and for this you bleed
A merciless trigger finger a cosmic guillotine I am
You have never been so manipulated in your god damn life!
Salvation denied!

Acting of lies born in disguise
Hatred breeds hatred
Your first breath an asthmatic inhale of maculated air
The worlds looking glass broken for innumerable times
No bad luck for mankind just Armadeggon!

Acting of lies suck out your eyes
Bloodshed is bloodshed
In whom do you trust? Ashes to ashes dust to dust
Defrost your malignant mind eye for an eye
Salvation denied

Paint that scornful smile of your fucking face
