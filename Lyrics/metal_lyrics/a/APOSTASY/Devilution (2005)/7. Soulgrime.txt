Here everything is nothing, collision of life and death
Beyond and here, far and near everything always ends the same
Another day, you're wishing to die
Another day, of cold inside
Another day, with you're rotten soul
Another day in this spiral down down!
Wake up and paint the gloomy face yet inside you still feel

Falling down in the abyss of pain, were life and death remains the same
Like a ghost you walk the earth and no one notice your presence
This world is dead inside, path that you walk towards lies and hate
Your darkest dream, your won existence
Born into a world of decay!

Woke up this night in sweat and tears
Alone you shall wander!
Screaming out in vain and no one could hear you

Here everything is nothing, collision of life and death
Beyond and here, far and near everything always ends the same
Another day, you're wishing to die
Another day, of cold inside
Another day, with you're rotten soul
Another day in this spiral down down!
Wake up and paint the gloomy face yet inside you still feel

Falling down in the abyss of pain, were life and death remains the same
Like a ghost you walk the earth and no one notice your presence
And no one notice your presence

Embraced my misery you are doomed to a life in the dark

Die die die!
