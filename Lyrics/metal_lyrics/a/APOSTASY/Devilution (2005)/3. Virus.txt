Desperately you accept and inject the virus of truth
The masses seek and swallows lies and saviours
Drowning and dissolving in absolutions
This is our cause of devolution, always working to burn to deform this world
This is our cause and death solution we are praising guns pointed at our heads
Rise above the disease and it's mass, or would you rather crawl in the ashes of time
Do you blindly accept the crown of thorns and your illusions that you call divine
A blessing in the form of a menace injection
Yet whores of this kind they will always thirst for more
A blessing in the form of a menace injection
Yet whores of those kind they will always thirst for more

This world will bless us with the suffering!
From the very root of this sulphur disease

New world order that feeds, and implores death world wide
Your salvation is just lies and fucking chains!

Desperately you accept and inject the virus of truth
The masses seek and swallows lies and saviours
Drowning and dissolving in absolutions

On the brink of extinction bear the burden of my knowing
Light guides the way of our hell bound faith
Omens and signs are everywhere in front of you
The new era rising so prepare for this final battles

This world will bless us with the suffering!
From the very root of it's time
It's the proof that life and death collide

Desperately you accept and inject the virus of truth
The masses seek and swallows lies and saviours
Drowning and dissolving in absolutions
On the brink of extinction bear the burden of my knowing
Light guides the way of our hell bound faith
The new era rising so prepare for this final battles
