Standing in the ashes gazing out, the strength of cold blood reaches my heart
There's nothing left for me to return to my mind is totally torn apart
Indoctrined by a fake society never thought it would end up like this
Hell is everywhere death is by my side, this isn't an ordinary arcade

Stare into cubic dimensions am I alive or dead?
Die for an unknown cause, is this for pleasure or pain?
Hate keeps me alive!

You have to choose a side
Night and day will remain the same there is no one left alive
A carnal lust for killing I am chosen one
The chosen one I am

Show me the strategy to be supreme and to major goals that I need to achieve
Stare into cubic dimensions am I alive or dead?
Die for an unknown cause, is this for pleasure or pain?
Hate keeps me alive!

Hate my concubine since the beginning of time
I killed everyone like you told me to slaughtering souls for serving you
The time is mine when the stars go out!

Standing in the ashes gazing out, the strength of cold blood reaches my heart
There's nothing left for me to return to my mind is totally torn apart
Indoctrined by a fake society never thought it would end up like this
Hell is everywhere death is by my side, this isn't an ordinary arcade

Stare into cubic dimensions am I alive or dead?
Die for an unknown cause, is this for pleasure or pain?
Hate keeps me alive!
