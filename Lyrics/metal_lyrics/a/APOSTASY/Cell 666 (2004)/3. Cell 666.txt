Voices in my head
Telling me my god is dead
This burning hate, the urge to kill
When steel meets flesh the blood will spill

Caged within these walls
Lost among these mazelike halls
I must break out, I have to flee
I'm a prisoner of insanity

The world outside's my hunting ground
The innocent my prey
A game of slaughter, fear and pain
Do you want to come and play?

Charades in blood and lunacy
Give into your desires
Like Manson, Bundy, and Albert Fish
Feast upon a human dish

Bestial desire for human flesh

I'll stab you down and beat you
I'll cut you up and eat you
No remorse for the deeds I have done

A game of slaughter, fear and pain
Do you want to come and play?
Charades in blood and lunacy
Give into your desires

Who says death isn't pleasing

Death wields its scythe
With victorious might
No one escapes this inevitable fate
Not even the bringer of hate
