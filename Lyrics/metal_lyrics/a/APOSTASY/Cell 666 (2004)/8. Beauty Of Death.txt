A seed of evil growing
Within my tortured soul
Becoming disillusioned
Raised with a saving cross
A blurry sight
Intoxicated flesh
The past is haunting me
Unvarnished nature
Emotional depths unite

Starring eyes reflecting disbelief
Loosing faith a messiah no more
A mind infected feeling hatred so strong
Avenging the past, practice sins by the book

My former faith is fading
Belief within me dies
Betraying Jesus Christ
A poor misguided kind
Beings of flesh and blood
Salvation can be yours
Thoughts of a world so pure
Exists on earth no more
Behold the blasphemy
Holding your banner high under sky
Thrust the nails of evil deeper inside

Starring eyes reflecting disbelief
Loosing faith a messiah no more
A mind infected feeling hatred so strong
Avenging the past, practice sins by the book

Come to me and I shall help you escape death
And show you all the ways to pure infinity
Believers faith raped by diabolical intercourse
