Vessels of wrath overflow
A smile of pity for human nature
Defenseless mass psychosis

Thorns of perfidy for your own martyrs crown
An architect of butterfly wings
Needs no storm to fall
Defenseless mass psychosis

Samaritans with poisonous wine
Makes the addiction to a profit
Revelation to some darkness to others
The burdy ground is in mankind's mind

Icon of universal lies

I am an icon of universal lies
I am the burning hate in the beholders eye
I am the mourning prognosis
I am the queen in the serpents nest

Samaritans with poisonous wine
Makes the addiction to a profit
Revelation to some darkness to others
The burdy ground is in mankind's mind

I am all that you want me to be
I am all that you never can see
I am the shadow that stalks the night
I am the star that shines so bright
I am all the answers for the mysteries of earth
