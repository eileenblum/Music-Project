Drink from my tempting chalice and you shall awake
Darkest hatred fills your soul
Rigid father, haunted one
Withering goddess truth am I

Dark desires fill the emptiness
Cleansing your infected flesh
Wear the armor, a hidden truth
Erasing former ethic rules
Millennium kingdom has to come
Enthroned by many but not by me
I'll be the one to set you free
Listen to your inner voice
There's a bran new world: to see

Rigid father, haunted one
Withering goddess truth am I
Dark desire fill the emptiness
Cleansing your infected flesh
Wear the armor, a hidden truth
Erasing former ethic rules
Darkest hatred fills your soul
Millennium kingdom has to come
Enthroned by many but not by me
Listen to your inner voice
There's a bran new world: to see

Downward spiral of never-ending lies
Fool the one who's blind that no one ever dies
Trust is his faith and deceiving is the game
I'll be the one to guide you through cosmic domains
Let me inside you to flow in your veins
Let me inside you to flow in your veins
I'll be the one to guide you through cosmic domains

I am many we are one

Give into your dark desires and release your chains
In the name of Satan I lead you into dimensions
Drink from my tempting chalice and you shall awake
Now you are mine forever caught in the cradle of night

There is no such thing as God
His son and the holy whore
... As God his son and the holy whore
