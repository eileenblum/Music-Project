Cursing the light and the flame burning bright
I descend to eternal darkness
Tearing apart what once was my heart
Entrapped in this hellish domain

Disguised in white with golden wings
An angel only by name
Summoned from a world forgotten
Servant of the dark
A constant state of nothingness
Consuming all humanity
Insinuations of a godsend gift
Has now been put to rest

Cursing the light and the flame burning bright
I descend to eternal darkness
Tearing apart what once was my heart
Entrapped in this hellish domain
Entrusted as a bringer of death
Sent to this world from below
Twisting in pain with fear in your eyes
A smile on my face as I watch you die

As tables turn and joy becomes fear
The end of life is drawing near
A reign of chaos and aeons of pain
Mere tales of this world will remain
My chalice of blood raised to the skies
As grotesquery inherits the earth...
... As grotesquery inherits the earth

I am your eyes and ears
I am your dreams and fears

Mankind scapegoat an excuse for weaken minds
There's no fucking emission for your pity existence
