Now see this empty land
There's only dust and bones
I'm staring at remains
Where once our people roamed
On beating wings of steel
They ripped us all apart
No warning, no remorse
Hell came upon us

Fear in their eyes
Fear in the night

Behold the horsemen from hell
Revenge upon a world that's evil and must die
Your screams no dreams they are for real
Horsemen of death are bearing down upon you

Desolation all around
They're laughing at your cries
You're lying in the sun
With blood stained sightless eyes
Out from the pit of hell
The end of all mankind
The price man has to pay
For treachery and lies

Fear in their eyes
Fear in the night

Behold the horsemen from hell
Revenge upon a world that's evil and must die
Your screams no dreams they are for real
Horsemen of death are bearing down upon you
