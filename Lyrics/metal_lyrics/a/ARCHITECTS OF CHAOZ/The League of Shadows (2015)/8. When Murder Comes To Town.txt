You're hiding in the closet, peering through the cracks
You only see his shape in darkness, only see the axe
Daring not to move or breathe, you choke the terror down
Your paradise now hell on earth, now murder comes to town

Mama's in the bedroom split from head to toe
Father with his head hacked off, but the blood still flows

Lie so still - Fear in the darkness as all are killed
Lie so still - The man with the axe searching out for you

A face looks through the window, noises in the dark
The wind is howling all around, the dogs begin to bark
Feeling that there's something wrong, you pull the curtain back
The Glass explodes into the air now the beast attacks

Slashing blows upon your neck, your torn and bloody gown
Another victim of the night when murder comes to town
Mama's in the bedroom ripped from head to toe
Father's head upon the floor, but the blood still flows

Lie so still - Fear in the darkness as all are killed
Lie so still - The man with the axe searching out for you

Death in the night
When murder comes to town
