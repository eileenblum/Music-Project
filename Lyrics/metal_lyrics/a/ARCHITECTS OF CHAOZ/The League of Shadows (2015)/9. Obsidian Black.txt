It lights the fire within
That sets my demon free
I see the mirror cracked
How I was meant to be
And still the fire burns
Distorts a broken mind
Look into my eyes
And see the hell inside

Down, down, down I'm falling
Obsidian black
Sanity is leaving
There's no coming back

I feel the anger rise
A ball of burning rage
For all the pain you gave me
A thousand times your way
Now watch the beast arise
I see you cover away
This is my gift to you
For all pain you gave

Down, down, down I'm falling
Obsidian black
Sanity is leaving
There's no coming back
