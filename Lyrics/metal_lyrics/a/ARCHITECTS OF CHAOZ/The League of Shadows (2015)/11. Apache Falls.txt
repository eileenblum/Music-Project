The vultures pecking at my eyes
Waiting for death before sunrise
And still I hear the savage cry
As they dance around the fire

Blood all around me
Bodies ripped and torn
Scalps hang from the desert trees
We died at Apache Falls

Now we pay the price - Massacred
No one has survived
Tales now will be told
We died at Apache Falls

Then they came howling in the night
Avenging warriors, claiming back their right
The white eyes never to return
Our people died
A lesson learned

Blood all around me
Bodies ripped and torn
Scalps hang from the desert trees
We died at Apache Falls

Now we pay the price - Massacred
No one has survived
Tales now will be told
We died at Apache Falls

We crossed their sacred lands
Their shamans' blood upon our hands
We killed all in our way
To enslave the savage to our ways
At Apache Falls
