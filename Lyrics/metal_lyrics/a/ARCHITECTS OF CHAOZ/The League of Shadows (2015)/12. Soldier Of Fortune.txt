I have often told you stories
About the way
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand and sing songs
Then maybe you would say
Come lay with me, you love me
And I would surely stay

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound of a windmill going 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

Many times I've been a traveler
I looked for something new
In days of old
When nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

Now I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound of a windmill going 'round
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

I can hear the sound of a windmill going 'round
I guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune
I guess I'll always be a soldier of fortune
