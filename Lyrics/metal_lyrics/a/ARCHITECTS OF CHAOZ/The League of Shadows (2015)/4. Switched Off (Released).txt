My time is here
I close my eyes
Feel my body start to rise
As I head toward the light
Faces I knew go passing by
No more tears, no more pain
I'm dying now to live again

Into the light
Open my mind and see

Keep your hatred and your pain
I rise above it
Leaving to a better place
Where fear means nothing
Dying to live
My only wish
To end this misery
My body's free to rise again
Into eternity

I watch the years
Re-run again
The touch of lovers
The death of friends
All these things
That I held near
They now slowly disappear

Into the light

Keep your hatred and your pain
I rise above it
Leaving to a better place
Where fear means nothing
Dying to live
My only wish
To end this misery
My body's free to rise again
Into eternity

My time is here
I close my eyes
Feel my body start to rise
As I head toward the light
Faces I knew go passing by
No more tears, no more pain
I'm dying now to live again

Into the light

Keep your hatred and your pain
I rise above it
Leaving to a better place
Where fear means nothing
Dying to live
My only wish
To end this misery
My body's free to rise again
Into eternity

Keep your hatred
And keep your pain
I'm leaving to a better place
To live again
No more tears
No more pain
