Don't cross the line with me
Cause you won't live to tell
I know your mind's diseased
Trapped in your private hell
When we come face to face
It's your last day on earth
And when I see your face
You will remember

I am hell's avenger

You've been kissed by the wings of the angel of death
Taking your soul in the night
Kissed by the wings of the angel of death
Seeing your fear as you die

For all your hate and lies
You spread around the world
The childrens' funeral pyre
Built on empty bullet shells
It's time to end your reign
It's time to count the cost
And when you see my face
You will remember

I am hell's avenger

You've been kissed by the wings of the angel of death
Taking your soul in the night
Kissed by the wings of the angel of death
Seeing your fear as you die
