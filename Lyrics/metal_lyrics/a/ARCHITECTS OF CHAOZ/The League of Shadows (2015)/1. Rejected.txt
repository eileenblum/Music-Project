I don't belong in this world
Kicked like a dog in the streets every day
My flag of sorrows unfurled
There's no release from my misery and pain

And so I hide myself away
Searching the shadows to be with my own kind
And all your hatred and your rage
You spit upon me and scream

Rejected - by society
Rejected - we should never be
Rejected - mankind's insanity
Rejected - now we reject you

Like jackals we hide in the night
Slither away when the light falls upon us
Ashamed before your mocking eyes
Your pointed fingers and venomous lies

And so I hide myself away
Searching the shadows to be with my own kind
And all your hatred and your rage
You spit upon me and scream

Rejected - by society
Rejected - we should never be
Rejected - mankind's insanity

Rejected - by society
Rejected - we should never be
Rejected - mankind's insanity
Rejected - now we reject you
