From all around the flames are lighting up the sky
But when I look at you there's nothing in your eyes

This all means nothing to you
So cold you turn away
I'm shattered, cold and bleeding
And so this ends today

Dead eyes - Hide the hate inside your mind
Dead eyes - Another victim of your crimes
Your lies - I look away from your dead eyes
Each night - I see your face and those dead eyes

You tore my world apart with lies built upon lies
You're out there looking good
While thousands more will die

But this means nothing to you so cold you turn away
It's time to pay the piper
A life of hell and pain

Dead eyes - Hide the hate inside your mind
Dead eyes - Another victim of your crimes
Your lies - I look away from your dead eyes
Each night - I see your face and those dead eyes
