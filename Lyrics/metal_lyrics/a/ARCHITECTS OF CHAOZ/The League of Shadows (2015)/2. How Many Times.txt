I move to the left
You run to the right
I try to hold you close
But you just want to fight

Each time I try to get close to you
You leave me flat and busted, feeling used
Tell me what am I supposed to do with you

How many times
Do I sit and wait for you
How many times
Your words of love just don't sound true
How many times
You put me through this misery
How many times
Must I live this tragedy

I look in your eyes
The wall you hide behind
Your poisoned words of love
Just hit the ground and died

No more lies this time
We're really through
My heart tells me what I have to do
Hear these words that I am screaming out to you

How many times
Do I sit and wait for you
How many times
Your words of love just don't sound true
How many times
You put me through this misery
How many times
Must I live this tragedy
