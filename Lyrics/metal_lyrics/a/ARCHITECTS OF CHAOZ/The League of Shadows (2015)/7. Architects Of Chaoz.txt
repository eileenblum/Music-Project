We walk along the road life takes us
Accepting all fates, twists and turns

We stand alone facing the sun
Taking the blows as hard as they come

In our world nothing's ever given
All we have now we've had to earn

We stand alone facing the sun
Taking the blows as hard as they come

We never believed in your way of life
We stand alone
Embrace the chaos, another world
We stand alone

We are the Architects of Chaoz
Building our mayhem around the world

We stand alone facing the sun
Taking the blows as hard as they come

We're on a path that we believe in
Come join us in our shadow world

We stand alone facing the sun
Taking the blows as hard as they come

We never believed in your way of life
We stand alone
Embrace the chaos, another world
We stand alone
The league of shadows guiding us home
We stand alone
True to ourselves, we're trusting no one
We stand alone

We stand alone facing the sun
Taking the blows as hard as they come

We never believed in your way of life
We stand alone
Embrace the chaos, another world
We stand alone
The league of shadows guiding us home
We stand alone
True to ourselves, we're trusting no one
We stand alone
