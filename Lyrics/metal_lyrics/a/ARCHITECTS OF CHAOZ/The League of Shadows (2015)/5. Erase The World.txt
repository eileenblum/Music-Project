A lightning bolt, the crack of doom
Begins to split the earth
The sea begins to pound the shore
The fallen all around, such terrifying screams
It's time for man to rule no more

We watched from far away
Another universe
This gift we gave you long ago

You drained the planet, filled the lands with blood
Death is the only seed you've sown
The sands of time are running low for you
We have no choice
Erase the world

We are the watchers of your world
We see from far away
It's time to break your stranglehold
You drained the planet of its very soul
Now we've returned to take control

We watched from far away
Another universe
This gift we gave you long ago

You drained the planet, filled the lands with blood
Death is the only seed you've sown
The sands of time are running low for you
We have no choice
Erase the world

We gave you life
We gave you freedom

We watched from far away
Another universe
This gift we gave you long ago

You drained the planet, filled the lands with blood
Death is the only seed you've sown
The sands of time are running low for you
We have no choice
Erase the world
