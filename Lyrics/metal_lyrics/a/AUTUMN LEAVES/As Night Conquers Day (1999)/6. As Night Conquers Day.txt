Behold, the strength of mankind
From the shores of Heaven
To the pits of Hell

Behold, the curse of mankind
Nihilistic supremacy

And thus night is coming
No savior is at hand

Shadows engulf the daylight
Withered landscapes prevail
Embraced by darkness

Dead like the hope of our salvation
Descend from life to termination

As night conquers day
The world is lead astray
As night conquers day
The sun will fade away

Behold the hellish terrors inflicted by man

Behold the curse of nature
For itâs plagued by man

Fire reaping the remnants
Existence denied
This is the answer this worldwide damnation
This is whatâs left from thousands of years
Of raping the earth

As night conquers day
The world is lead astray
As night conquers day
The sun will fade away
