All I am is one with me
All there is is selfish deeds
You might say thatâs the price
Of being heathen
I say another day, another demon

I am glowing from the interior of my heart
Iâm falling down
Burning up, ashes, before I hit the ground
Iâm dimming this faithful light
I am eternal and alone
With this comforting night

Embrace the ones that make you sick
Inhale the air even water thick
Deceive the flock to disbelieve
Break the strong (with continuity)
Claim the words that made you say
The destiny was planned from the very first day

Save the tears that could fall from me
Enjoy the presence, be one with me
Hold back the tears that are distorting me
Release your will and set me free
