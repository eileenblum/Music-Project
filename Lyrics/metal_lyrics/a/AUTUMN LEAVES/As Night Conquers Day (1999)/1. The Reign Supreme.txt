Starring with distant eyes into the sky
Thinking wereâs my saviour?
Thinking the answer lies above
Ruined, frustration has prevailed
You stand forsaken on the fields of self-sympathy
Empty the light has disappeared

Restrained â dominated with intents so spiteful
Restrained â and thus I dare you to confront your demons

Treasuring the icons of a bleeding Christ so credolous
Silently you cry His name
Keeping purity of mind

Come stand before me, reveal yourself to me
Religious scriptures non-convicing
They seem surreal
Submit to your god, youâre forced down on your knees
To pray forgiveness â Once again you have failed

Instincts betrayed youâre feeling fear
Manipulated for the sake of salvation
You finally should realize youâre deceived

Father, great one above
Youâll be enthroned from your palace in Heaven
The ceasure of The Reign Supreme

Restrained â dominated with intents so spiteful
Restrained â and thus I dare you to confront your demons

Ending of the human race is nearing
As the days go by
Doomsday sealed by sick religions
This will be your final day
