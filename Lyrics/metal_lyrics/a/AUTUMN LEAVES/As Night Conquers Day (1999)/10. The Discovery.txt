I was created
To walk the soil of the earth
And i will wander
Until the night has swallowed the sun
Then I will enter
A dimension beyond humanity

I am the thunder
The roaring beast of nature
I am the lightning
The one that ignites your every soul
I am all of everything
And everything is to discover...

Thanks to thedeadh for correcting track #10 lyrics.
