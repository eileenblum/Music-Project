See the breeze dancing over shadowland
Watch the darkening storm appear
Feel the power of a million men
Darkskies that embrace your eyemind

Overshadowing your own ability
To see right through misty weather
Inside of this empowering darkness
Suffering is found until you perish

Seek your own visions let them be the truth
To take you high above the wasted wasteland
Laughing as you look down
As you look down upon this phenomenon of chaos

The will exploit you, condemn you
Theyâll haunt you, descent you
Theyâll make you speak their truth
Their life has no essence, so yours they will drain
Eating your precious youth
Take a deep breath blow away all their lies
Youâre the king of your own domain
Gather the strength to conquer your foe
You are the one who will reign

Seek your own visions let them be the truth
To take you high above the wasted wasteland
Laughing as you look down
As you look down upon this phenomenon of chaos
