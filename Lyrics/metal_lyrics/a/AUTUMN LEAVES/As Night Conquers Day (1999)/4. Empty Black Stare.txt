Through the falling skies of heaven
Across the fields of pagan fire
That has burned throughout the virgin years

Red glowing clouds covers the Eden sky
As the fire dries our tears

The slaughtered souls beyond the reach of Godâs faith
Now enchanted by the demon flood
Godless rites on a heathen night
Come taste the purest angel blood

And God started killing in despair
His fall from grace with an empty black stare

With virtues of tempting desire
We crave vengeance for the centuries passed
The cross we kissed no more to deceive
The blackened night inhales the mourning light
Liberated from the thoughts naive
Come forth and with fire raise a battle
Never more to be seen
Set the standards for a New World regime
An embracing fire lifts the spirit higher
Taste the sin so delicate so supreme

And God started killing in despair
His fall from grace with an empty black stare
