Come spread your dreams through golden years
Iâll spread my plague of depressive screams
Go live your life as I leave mine
This autumn fever â a lifeless line

By the glowing that burns out the sun
We will join our eternity
A sign of whatâs to come
Is a sign to leave our depravity

Come lift your wings from the soil of anger

Iâve lost the one with whom I shared my rings
From sadness I will rise
But even the strongest canât fly with a broken wing

Iâve lost my wonder to the ruler of the sky
Bloodred tears spilled for an eternity of time
What once were can never be
And whatâs to come you cannot see

Come lift your wings from the soil of anger
