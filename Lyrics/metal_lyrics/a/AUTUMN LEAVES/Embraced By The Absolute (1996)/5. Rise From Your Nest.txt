In these moments of unlimited grief
There is pain not to be forgotten
Not even joy can throw its light
Over this darkened place
misery gets enjoyable
In this imprisonment of emptiness
Mind exploding visions come to life

Living in a surrounding circle
Of soul poisoned victims of hate

Not knowing a way out of here
Makes you wanna disappear

In to a world beyond all humanity
To breed and unforgettable species

Pain is for the mortal
I only dress myself in flesh

This non-divine world suits me
I'll rise from my nest
May the beginning start
where the end left off
