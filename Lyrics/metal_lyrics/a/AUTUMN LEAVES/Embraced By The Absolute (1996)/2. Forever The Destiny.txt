Is it possible to draw an image
Reflected of your own personality
When the people that affects you
Control your destiny

Take it to the limit
Where the black flowers grow
Where emotions have no power
Over your body mind and soul

the dark side of your soul stirring life
Malcontent with the life you lead
Omit the affection and filtrate the lies
The destiny will forever succeed

Take it to the limit!
