I keep seeing these pictures before my eyes
But every time I watch I can't realize
If it is the beginning of a world divine
Or the final hard stroke that will crush my spine

From my vein it won't stop bleeding
I cannot patch up these wounds
the unknown has taken over
Hopefully not everlasting

If only this pain would disappear
I knew I was going away from here
