Gazing obsessed into the sky
The blue gate turns black
Watching dark clouds float by
As the memory appears
Of the planets so distant and vast

As a sign from those to the earth
An object of once burning stones
Makes us wonder in eternity
Of our mysterious origin

A sight of beauty high above
Merely for us to see
All of it not ever to discover
Only in our imagination

The morning bestial sunlight
Makes my eyes water in blood
Feeling within my systems
The universal flood
