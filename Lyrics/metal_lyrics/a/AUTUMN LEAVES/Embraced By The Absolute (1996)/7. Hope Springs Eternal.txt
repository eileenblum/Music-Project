Hope springs eternal in the human being
confront the truth of life
forever to be living in harmony
is it possible or do I fantasize?

Sense the strength of the mortal man
Beyond corruption power survives

To be free again

To be free again
corruption cease it's end
and the glow of might
Burning in his eyes

The lack of social sympathy
melts down the system and wipes out the weak
beneath the warming sun freedom is still unwon
Dying - so to speak
