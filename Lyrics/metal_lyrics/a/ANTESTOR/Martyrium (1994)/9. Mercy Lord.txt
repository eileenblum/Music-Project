Be gracious to me o God
In Thy true love
In the fullness of Thy mercy
Blot out my misdeeds
Create in me a pure heart o God
Give me a new and steadfast spirit
Do not drive me from Thy presence
Or take Thy Holy Spirit from me
Against Thee I have sinned
And done what displeases Thee
Thou hast hidden the truth in darkness
Through this mystery Thou teach me
Create in me a pure heart o God
Give me a new and steadfast spirit
Do not drive me from Thy presence
Or take Thy Holy Spirit from me
