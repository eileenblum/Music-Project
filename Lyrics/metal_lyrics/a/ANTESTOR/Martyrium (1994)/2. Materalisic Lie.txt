Satisfaction death reaction
Lifeless being life deceiving
Materialistic lie existing till you die
The world cannot give nor let you live
Lustful bodies skinned to the core
still crying out for so much more
Needing eyes filled with desire
made to be just another liar
Turn away it's hell to pay
Not a very nice place to stay
When you die the needing eyes cry
there's nothing left to consume
All that you've worked for falls through the dust
there's only hell left to pay for your lust
Materialistic lie existing till you die
The world cannot give nor let you live
