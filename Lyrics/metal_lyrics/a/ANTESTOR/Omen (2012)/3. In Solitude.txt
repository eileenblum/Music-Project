Frantic I scream in agony of not being
able to reach my goals wars inside
my head

I do my best, I give my all still I'm so far
away trying to keep my hope I stumble
and I fall

As I lay here, waiting for you beside me,
to keep me calm

My head held high, my outside unscathed
no one to ask, no one to help I'm left
here all alone

Battle rages all day long bitterness
seldom comes alone fury becoming my
strength and seems to be the only way
to survive

All pain that I've ever known I reap only
what my past has sown no secrets
are kept from you as you witness my
attempts to ignore

Frantic I scream in agony of not being
able to reach my goals wars inside
my head

I do my best, I give my all still I'm so far
away trying to keep my hope I stumble
and I fall

I ask for forgiveness but my screams
are unheard my claims misunderstood
ignorance has won

As I lay here, waiting for You beside
me, to keep me calm I feel your spirit
comforting me and within me,
I'm saved through grace
