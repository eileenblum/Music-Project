I was an easy prey for you
better believe that those
days are over now

Naivety of the past so sick
of being abused

Forgiving is not forgetting

My revenge boils inside
though I try to oppress it but
I cannot deny my newborn
freedom

Forgiving is not forgetting

A broken heart mended no
more crying in vain regrets
suffer ignorance all feelings
are dead

Some wounds heal with time

I welcome this new reality
and call it my own

Rage, because of you hate,
because of you fallen,
because of you reborn,
because of you

Forgiven and forgotten
