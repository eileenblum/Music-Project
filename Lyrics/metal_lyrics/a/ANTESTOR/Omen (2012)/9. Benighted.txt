Her kisses were like being embraced by life itself
dressed in a funeral gown she was more
beautiful than I ever could remember

The true source overwhelms me
embraced by this entity
the fullness of her beauty
lacks the imperfection of humanity

Like an angel she came
but like a demon she flew away
joy turned to sadness
hope turned to hate

Fooled yet again by the lies of mankind
fooled yet again by the lies

Like an angel she came
but like a demon she flew away
joy turned to sadness
hope turned to hate

All alone I wander in the darkness
lost and dazed I cease to exist
visions of old comes to mind
I've been through this before

Joy turned to sadness
hope turned to hate

Will I ever dare to feel again
or is this my everlasting bitter end
