Self-inflicted mental scars
protected by memories old

Seeing something from a different view
it could not help less

Broken and beaten I face another day
unleashed into this cold world

Mistrust and decay
I couldn't care less

Continuing this seemingly hopeless journey
scars from the past push aside the pain
alive but not living
the life of the undead

Still you remain and maintain your powers
trying my best to neglect your ways

Victory seems so far gone
death just a razors edge away

Mistrust and decay
I couldn't care less

My life is not worth living
how can I stand this pain
there is no reason to exist
I wasn't asked to join this sick game

Self-inflicted mental scars
protected by memories old
seeing something from a different view
it could not help

Praying for no more than hope
is the only light in this darkness
torn apart as I may be

Ready to be rebuilt
