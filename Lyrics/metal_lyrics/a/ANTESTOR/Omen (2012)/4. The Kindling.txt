No chains needed to keep me still
strangulation does not keep me from screaming
no poison can deny the truth
purification has replaced my anger

Outcast, freak
titles made by those who fear the unknown
infectious, leper lack of wisdom overpowers
humanity

Leper in disguise

Injustice has been served for several years
a life ignored by most
never again will I keep to myself
my actions speak louder than words

Outcast, freak
titles made by those who fear the unknown
infectious, leper
lack of wisdom overpowers humanity

No chains needed to keep me still
strangulation does not keep me from screaming
no poison can deny the truth
purification has replaced my anger

My silence has broken
