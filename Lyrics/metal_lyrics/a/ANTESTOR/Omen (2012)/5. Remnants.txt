Stabbed in the back by the most trusted individual leaves
mental scars that time will not heal I will never forget, and
I cannot possibly forgive locked away in the back of my
mind forever it is like a hibernating cancer

Abandoning my name
fleeing from an invisible force
many years have passed
still the daggers are caressing my skin

Breathe, feel, deny, search, find, receive

Animal behavior, these darwinistic thoughts certifies my
human nature forgiving and forgetting can only be done
through divine intervention

Abandoning my name
fleeing from an invisible force
many years have passed
still the daggers are caressing my skin

Breathe, feel, deny, search, find, receive

Doors are closed, I hold the key will they stay like this
for eternity searching for what I don't want to find a
hibernating cancer hibernating cancer

But I don't want to forget and therefore
I cannot ever forgive

Gazing at the mirror trying to find small remnants of my
soul which have been left behind during childhood
the memories and the shame.

All that's left is revenge all that's real is revenge

Breathe, feel, search, find, receive

Doors open by the touch of my hand hibernating cancer
awakens

Euphoria, redemption

Stabbed in the back by the most trusted individual it
leaves mental scars that only God can heal I will never
forget, and I cannot possibly forgive locked away in the
back of my mind forever it is like a hibernating cancer
