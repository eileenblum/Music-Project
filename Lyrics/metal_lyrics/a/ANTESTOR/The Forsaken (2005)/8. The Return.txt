The art of the Y
Is the excellence of X
Corroding is for autumn
Renewing is for spring

The art of the Y
Is the excellence of X
Corroding is for autumn
Renewing is for spring

Recovering of the dead
Impossible for the living
The making of a copy
Is destruction of mankind

The earth is in it's autumn
The leaves have hit the ground
Corroding this earth is dying
Not knowing, you'll face the end

The coming of Christ
Is the return of X
The art of the Y
Is in the new spring
