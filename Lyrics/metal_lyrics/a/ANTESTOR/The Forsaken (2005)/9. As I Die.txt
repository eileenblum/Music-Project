My hands in the open wound
The knife clutches near
The blood of my veins spread out
My flesh become soiled

This desperate act of loss
The pain of knowing why
My mind slips into a blur
Upcoming questions... as I die

Forever in search of the truth
I find myself puzzled

Don't you feel the urge
The passionate flow
The endless collision
Of purity and evil

Since we're of the flesh
We are to realize
That mankind must end
If purity will prevail

Forever in search of the truth
I find myself puzzled
... as I die

Don't you feel the urge
The passionate flow
The endless collision
Of purity and evil

Since we're of the flesh
We are to realize
That mankind must end
If purity will prevail

Death is my goal / Death, set me free
In my living hell, I can no longer be
Please bring me back home
Where I can be free
