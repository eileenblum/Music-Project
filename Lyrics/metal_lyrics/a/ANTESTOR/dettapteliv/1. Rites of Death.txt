Rites of death
Rites of undeath
We're falling
We're falling down

I told you we're into deep

Transfer life into what's dead
The act of humans playing God

Redoing the acts of medieval
Witchcraft and the worship of dead

We're falling, we're falling down
From our throne, so supposedly high
When we confront the power great
The might of our own creator

Transfer life into what's dead
The act of human playing God

Redoing the acts of medieval
Witchcraft and the worship of dead

The rites of undeath
Is the testament of our own death
