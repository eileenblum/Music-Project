A best rose from the sea
it started to blaspheme
You watch out, satan might get you
He will never let you go
Jesus can help, He has won
He is the Messiah
in Him you must belive

Don't let satan treat you as a friend
Satan comes to collect his souls
Jesus saves you if you want to
It's up to you to make the choice
give your life to Jesus Christ

Jesus is the one and only
He was crucified for your life
You got to have faith in the Lord
He'll save you from eternal death
give your life to Jesus Christ

You've got a choice, that you must make
It's up to you, to live or die
