The rulers of the darkness of this world
Unmasked bringing their offers to man
A terrible reality is knocking on your door
Threatening to destroy your lofe forevermore

Personal freedom and independence
Fulfilment of desire, still needing more
Sinning without any feelings of guilt
Emptiness and exhausted soul

Without God there is no life
Man can not survive
Blinded by demonic seduction
Led into destruction

Free people with self-determination
Crimes, suicide and apprehension
Living is worthless, nothing to gain
Denying the truth the truth and satan's existense
