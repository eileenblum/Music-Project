An angel descending from heaven
holding the key to the abyss
he seized the serpent of old
who is the devil and satan
Into the abyss sealed
bound for a thousand years

After that he must be / released for a little while

Out to lead astray the nations
to muster them for battle
up over the breadth of the earth
surrounded the camp of the saints
ready to fight the bloved city

In the end, they will be / Forever in, the lake of fire?

Fire came down from heaven
the devil who deceived them
flung into the lake of fire
to the beast and the false prophet
tortoured day and night forever
