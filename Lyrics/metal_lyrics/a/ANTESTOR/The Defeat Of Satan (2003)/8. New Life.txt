Insanity look for yourself, satan rules this world
destruction he is the source he is after your soul
To save us from the hellish pain, God sent Jesus Christ
Crucified for all our sins, He felt the horror and pain

New life He rose again / New life He came to give
New life to a world of hate / New life you came to receive
New life He sets sinners free / New life he is for us
New life can be born today / New life for you

Condemed burned in holy flames
God you can stand his presence
The law you cannot be saved
Man sin is in your way / Love the holy and pure
Done what man couldn't do
blood  cover your sins/ Jesus offered his life
