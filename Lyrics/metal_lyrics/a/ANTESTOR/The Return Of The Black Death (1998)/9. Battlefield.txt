We Are Godâs Servants
Armed For War
Our Lives Are Sacrified
To Die For The Lord

Mountains Are Shaking
Weâre Marching Ahead
God Uses His Servants
To Help The Mislead

Rejoice In The Lord
Through Him Weâll Fight
Weâll Get Our Reward
When The Time Is Right

/: The Lord Is Our Master
O Lord Make Us Win
The Lord Is Our Master
our strength is from within :/

Godâs Word - Our Sword
The Faith - Our Shield
In Godâs People
Truth Is Revealed

Lift Up His Name
The Battle Has Begun
Listen You Mortal
Obey, No Use To Run

The Almighty Is Here
Calling Your Name

We Are Godâs Servants
Armed For War
Our Lives Are Sacrified
To Die For The Lord

Mountains Are Shaking
Weâre Marching Ahead
God Uses His Servants
To Help The Mislead

Rejoice In The Lord
Through Him Weâll Fight
Weâll Get Our Reward
When The Time Is Right

/: The Lord Is Our Master
O Lord Make Us Win
The Lord Is Our Master
our strength is from within :/
