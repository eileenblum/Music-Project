Never thought I'd pass through this
Now it has become a war
Alone in my confrontation
Everything is at stake

Destiny is being written
The line has been crossed
There are no more limits
A war for life is fought

War is at full fury
No fear, clear mind
Rise up and fight
A warrior is reborn

Battling against myself
Evolving and learning
My will has become my strength
For this, I've been meant to

This inner war, I can't escape
Iâm at the point of no return
Thereâs only one more thing to do
Arise and make my own stand

Rise up and overcome
A warrior is reborn
Rise up and conquer
A warrior is reborn
