Caught in yet another trap, self ambushed
Incarcerated in a hole, your pain is feckless
Tied down to a cycle of grief and torment
The enemy dwells in your shadow, merciless

Becoming nothing but a desert of agony
Your heart looks like a depiction of hell
Sometimes it feels like it's impossible to be
What cannot be changed dries the well

Sacrifice of existence

Surrender is not an option during warfare
Only the sovereign triumph, join the thrills
There is no place for hesitation in bloodshed

Itâs your choiceâ¦ Live or die, win or lose
No one can help you but yourself
