Masked perception
Distorts the face of truth
Subtly corrupting my eyes
Awkwardly blurring reality

The lights which dare to shine upon me
Are mere glimpses of lies
It's twisted to live through fish-eye lenses
What I behold never is what's real
Is our reality really what do we perceive?
A nightmarish depiction of life
Mislead by torn spoken words
Blinded by a childish damned hope
Unable to cut through the mist
Longing to discover a passageway

Inadvertently building up expectations
Enslaved by naive behaviors
Lacking the knowledge of how I imprisoned myself
Incarcerated in a frustrated state of mind

Lost in a desert of desolation
Cheated by manipulated visions
Engulfed in darkness, straying away from the path
Confused by venomous voices
The truth is in fact within myself

So still I crawl in black mud
Drifting away unaware of the facts
Surviving the midnight sun
Sliced by the blade of belief
Throughout the density I pierce

I yearn for wisdom in my illusions
Illusions of a mirage
To comprehend existence
