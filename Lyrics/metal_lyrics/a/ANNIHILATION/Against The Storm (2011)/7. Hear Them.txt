The day has come... I can feel it here
The madness is around me again

It calls me by my name, it makes me fear
Insanity comes back again

Its speech is full of rage
Suppressing all reactions
Invades me, dominates me
Tries to take over my actions

The face I now see in the mirror
I tremble before its gaze
It keeps repeating the same words
and I hear them again and again...

The day has come... I can see it in my eyes
Pulsating inside my brain
It drives me insane, I canât control
I think I'm losing my mind

I must fight back, I can't retreat
Canât let it have me
I have to take control
But I hear them again and again...
