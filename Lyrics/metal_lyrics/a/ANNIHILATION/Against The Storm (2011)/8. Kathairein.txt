Completely frantic and chaotic
Plunged in arrhythmia and despair
Inside this bottomless pit

Still I remain stuck, no air

Iâve been dominated, I've been weak
A mere puppet of my own demons
Drain my energy and possess my mind
They want both body and soul...

Abreaction, purgation
Breaking all delusions
I'm coming back to life
Surviving all around

Trapped within confusion
I refuse to stay beneath
I crawl out of the chaos
Resisting all foes and defeat

It's time to wake up and realize
What my eyes never saw before me
How to leave this misty limbo
And reach out for my way

Abreaction, purgation
Reinventing myself
I am being reborn
Fighting against the storm...
