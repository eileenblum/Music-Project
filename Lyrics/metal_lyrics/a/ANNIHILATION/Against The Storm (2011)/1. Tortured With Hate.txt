Tortured with hate
To exorcise the demons
Purging all the hostiles
Outlasting the suffering
Alone, my stand

Fighting the maggots
Surrounded by fools
Who blindly wander as sheep
I live through the illusion

The beast has been revealed with
all of those damn... Sick plans
The truth has been revealed and
your face is now exposed to the world
Ill intentions that deceive

Your self-conceit...
Your pride... will... be your... ruin...

Hiding behind your masks
Only covering up for a true weakness
Tortured with hate I fight the madness

All souls lost in a storm
Convulsions of agony
There is a price to pay
Taken away to the void
The Law...
