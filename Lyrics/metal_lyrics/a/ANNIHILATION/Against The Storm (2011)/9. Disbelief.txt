I walked away from life
Lost man drifting around
Like an ephemeral nomad

Disconnected from faith

Abandoned by myself
Embracing delusions
Distorted perception
Twisted senseless belief

All around I see envy
All around I hear lies
All around I feel pain
All around, only disbelief...
This sickness infecting me

Crawling as if I'm no more
But still wandering around
Still confused, I now realize
And search for answers to
those unasked questions

Black sun and dry sea
I, corroded man
Banished from the world
Returning from the dead
