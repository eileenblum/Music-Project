As I witness the facts
Can't believe what I see
Blinded by sight, deaf by words
There's only deception in me, frustrated

While losing all control
Youâre drifting desperately
Maybe a selfish reaction
Only fueling your pride

Wasting yourself away
All you find is demise
Ripping everything i believed in
Finally revealing your true face

I am holding nothing but contempt
and all i see is more of the same

Using people with no remorse,
falseâ¦ Manipulate and lie
Dwelling in chaos, youâre foul
Turning your back on others

Another pawn, another piece
Uncontrolled impulses drive you
Youâre just a part of the game
Just another illusion

I am holding nothing but contempt
and all I see is you denying the past
