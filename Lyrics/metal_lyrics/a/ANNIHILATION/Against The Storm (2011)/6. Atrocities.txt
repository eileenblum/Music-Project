Take a glimpse into the other side
And unravel the mysteries of life
As the misdeeds consume the soul

Uneasy your life still goes on

Listen and see the atrocities
Committed in the name of self

Insects crawling devouring the flesh from
Dead bodies forgotten, wasted
The decay, a pile of corpses
Spreading sickness

Listen and see the atrocities
Committed before your very eyes
As mankind kills itself
Abhorrent
The atrocities

The armies of unbalance
Rise to spread chaos
Upon this very world
Apocalypse has begun

Sweeping across the world
Dominating all the blind
