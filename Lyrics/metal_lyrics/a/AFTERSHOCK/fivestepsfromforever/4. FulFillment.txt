And so...it's come to this, wrought with the anguish. Consumed by spite, morphing towards what I despise.
And yet, things continue on, construe my spite to suit me. I see the world through hardened eyes, set free my past,
(for) tomorrow never dies. And so, I reach towards hope once more and yesterday fades away, and I set myself free...again.
Fall down, rise again. Cast shame, shed this skin. Enlighten me with the power to succeed, help me wash away the impurities
that shame me. True strength comes from the empowerment of self fulfillment, and self fulfillment is only achieved by
those who shed bear shame.
