Take from me...take from me...take from me...take from me. Razorblade smile conceals your severed tongue.
A hard lesson once taught now learned, learned through the barrel of a gun. Take from me...black eyes no longer see.
Take from me...black tongue no longer speaks. Take from me...black lungs no longer breathe. Take from me...black heart
no longer beats. Lost...alone...I reach out to grasp hold of nothing. All you control...continually fades to nothing.
Yet still I try...yet still I try...I fight to survive.
