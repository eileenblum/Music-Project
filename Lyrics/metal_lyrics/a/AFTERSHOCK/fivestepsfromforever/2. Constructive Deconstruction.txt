I cannot sacrifice, this gift you've given me. All else just disappears, it's all that I can see.
Sweet laughter beckons me, it heals all that surrounds. Baptize me with your touch, this gift that I have found.
It is in you that I see...all that I could ever need...all that I could become. Close my eyes...see her smile...all my
pain...fades to grey. Soft kisses penetrate me, without a touch from her lips. Shining eyes speak volumes, without
an uttered sound. Her smile overtakes me, silhouettes all my fears. All doubt of divine existence, washed away by
joyful tears. It is in you that I see...all that I could ever need...all that I could become. Close my eyes...see her
smile...all my pain...fades to grey. Now I have something to give. You've shown me all I have to give. Now I have
something to give. We've become all I have to give.
