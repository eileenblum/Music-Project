Progressing away, beneath a red sky. Twilight of day, month of July. Now one of three, thy innocent crown. Anxious in sight, perception, and sound. Timeline...fading. Lifeline...fading. Still she haunts me, still she taunts me. Caught inside...me. Children yet, tale to hear. Eager eye, willing ear. Loving nestle near. In a wonderland they lie. Dreaming as days go by. Dreaming as summer dies. Ever drift down the stream. Lingering in the golden gleam. Innocent child, seen in others eyes. Scepter in hand, she reigns phantomwise. Savior of three, capture the gleam. Essence eternal, live life through a dream. Liffe...what is it...but a dream...
