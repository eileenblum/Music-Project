I'm not just ornamentation. As each step brings me back to start, can I overtake my past tense future? Confront...faces of stone. Deceived...stories untold. Withdrawn...ash searing cold. Arise...ascension alone. Steal rails abscond my travels. Conversations with the dead prevail. Exoskeleton, hollow inside, the lost souls wishing me well. If I fall will their armor protect me? If I fall will the hollow survive? Drifting further...Labored eyesight...Silver laughter..Envied twilight. The scepter shatters, feel the child inside me. Power struggle through that same child's eyes. Divided thoughts cloud innocent minds. Confront...faces of stone. Deceived...stories untold. Withdrawn...ash searing cold. Arise...ascension alone. I'm not just ornamentation. As each step brings me back to start, can I overtake my past tense future? Drifting further...Labored eyesight...Silver laughter..Envied twilight. You cannot chase your future from the past.
