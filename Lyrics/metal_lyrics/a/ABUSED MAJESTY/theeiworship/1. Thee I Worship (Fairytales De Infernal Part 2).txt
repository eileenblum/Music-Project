Black, as the sky above me
My soul wanders into the night
Beneath the shadows of thee almighty
Emperor of darkness
Creeping above the woods
Beneath the moon, together with wolfs,
As one, like a blizzard
Beneath the stars so bright...
Through the forest we run
Dazzled by the shapes
Of mournfull shadows
I gaze into the moonlight
Devrouing the flesh of my enemies
Black, as the darkness surrounding me
My spirit flows above the trees
At last one with thee (I Worship)
Emperor of darkness...
Oo! And thou shall suffer no more
For all of mankind crawl on their knees
Black and white, Christian and muslim
All bow before Thy-Satan!
Satan's domination
Heaven's desolation
Mankind's damnation
End of god's creation!
