Flesh eaten from inside
Juice drank from the soul
Burning filling that
You are not alone
Ancient evil fill my mind...
...In the moonlight

Below the shadow of nocturnal black wings
Lay the path to the temple of sin
Take my hand walk through the light
Let the Devil be your guide!

...Raise hell...
...On earth...

"O saceros Christi, tu scis
me esse daibolum, lur
me derogas?"

"O servent of God, you know
I am the Devil, why do you
Disturb me?"
