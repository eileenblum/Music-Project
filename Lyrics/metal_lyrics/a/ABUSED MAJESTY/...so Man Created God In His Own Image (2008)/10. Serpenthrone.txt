we were the fire, that devoured all
carrions, the brood of man, bended their necks
we were the thunder, unequalled
in our rule life and death (united with the spirits)

Nine spirits of the fourth corner
were mighty inside the trapezoid
a torture for the damned, a wreath for the wicked
walking the Earth with stings of fury

Serpenthrone

enough strength, to burn it all
indivisibly carrying scepter above
enough strength, to destroy it all
dividing cord and the blade between

Serpenthrone

so hearken my voice
as I granted you form and power
and your works shall be a honorable canto
and glory for the Lord in creation

at my throne they crawled like snakes
begging for mercy, vermin of the Earth
(in shadow of his might
will they pray for ages)

Serpenthrone

we were the fire, that devoured all
carrions, the brood of man, bended their necks
many souls followed their own path, (alluring but without return)
others gave away themselves to the Primeval Lord of the Earth.
