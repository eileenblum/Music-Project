they were the blade of heavens
anointed by the Right Hand of the Almighty
in order to liberate the holy land
legion - mallet for the unfaithful

each of them obtained mercy from the Almighty
and among them were also children

so easily they were manipulated
guilty of nothing
giving them faith was enough
the guides have showed them the way

they still dream of paradise
as it was promised to them
forgetting, that they killed their own god
still desiring immortality
will their bloodshed be long remembered by the Holy Church?

these are the words of the Lord:
at first I made you servants

and placed you on the Twelve Capitols of Power
giving each of you the rule
above the nine true ages of time
(that from the greatest vessels and horns of your power
you may rule pouring out the fire of life
and grow on Earth.
and that is how you became
the robe of justice and truth)

they still dream of paradise
as it was promised to them
forgetting, that they killed their own god
still desiring immortality
will their bloodshed be long remembered by the Holy Church?
