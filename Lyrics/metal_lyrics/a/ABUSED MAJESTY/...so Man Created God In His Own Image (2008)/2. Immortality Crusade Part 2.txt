they were the blade of heavens,
god's army, army of all kings
anointed by the Right Hand of the Almighty
in order to liberate the holy land

they fought in each battle to their last breath
strong by the will of the Savior,
leaving behind only fields colored with blood in paradise
were awaited the souls of dead warriors

death was their companion in misery
was an honor, that befell millions
their fate was stronger than it
life everlasting was most important

I am your master, said the Lord of Heavens
the power praised above and below
in which hands the sun is a shining sword
and the moon, a fire stabbing throughout

they left behind only burnt ground
not guilty of anything
they fought under the flags of the Cross
fulfilling the edicts (of fire) and destruction

move and come
open the secrets of creation
be my friends, as I am yours
the true confessor of the highest
and untold king of heaven

each of them obtained mercy
from the Almighty
and among them were also children
winners and losers

I gave you the right to rule the saints
and I gave you the staff with the greatest knowledge
you have raised your voices,
and swear loyalty to the One,
that lasts and triumphs
without beginning and without an end

move and come
open the secrets of creation
be my friends, as I am yours
the true confessor of the highest
and untold king of heaven
