blazing dragon with a fiery sword
set his feet in the west
blessed by his ministers
gathering the moss of Earth
like a rich man his treasures

midget's throne saxatile pillar
ending epoch of a nation
was a throne of giant until
it was shattered by history

Deceased came to pile up
a grave above the father
of world last incarnation
then a rocky crypt was forged
(Inside the ring of time,
in black mountain)

now is the time of resurrection
a tomb has been opened for the light of Moon
to awaken the man called Hamon
that he may come out and stand
in the full light of dead sun

then the fire flared upon the temple's altar
God of world sat down on the throne
the tomb has been sealed
by a stone of future century
when cineritious vestments
where covered by flaming-red royal cloak
then the fire flared upon the temple's altar
God of world sat down on the throne

resumed was power of the dead lord
Har Regina
mountains of world
skull of a giant

at dawn the crescent lord
donned the diadem of Cyclopes
crested by soul of fathers,
eye of providence
then master of the dead
gained power over the whole world

blazing dragon with a fiery sword
set his feet in the west
blessed by his ministers
gathering the moss of Earth
like a rich man his treasures
