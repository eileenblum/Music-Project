There's always a beginning, there's always an end
We build the chain of existance
And even though a lot ends
Every end makes a new beginning
Like a neverending story
Is our huge world
Like a big ring of which we are apart
New age new era new chance
For our existances...
Now we can rise
Into the fire jump into the gulf
And who knows how many stones there are
And who knows how many roads we went along
How many suns we saw and who we were
We are like rain
Falling down to go back up
Fall again return to earth
We are taking part in a vicious circle
There could be someone may be here again
I've already been here and so have you
You don't know who you were know who you are
And know that we can live without you here
Don't be such a fool or soon you will be leaving
Filling empty hole in a vicious circle
