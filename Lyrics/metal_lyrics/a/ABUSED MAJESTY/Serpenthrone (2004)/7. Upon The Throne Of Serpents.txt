At the bottom of serpentine throne
The lords of the whole world went down on their knees
The power of the people of Earth was blooming

A destiny of the great empires was being decided
The mighty of the world were dazzled by power
The lords of the world were carrying out their duty

And when the hard times came
Hunger, plague and death were taking their toll
Powerlessness took their dream away

The great warriors celebrated honour
Traitors conspired betrayal
The deceitful engaged in intrigues
But today the remnants fall, splashed with blood
At the bottom of serpentine throne

U stï¿½p wï¿½owego tronu
Padali na kolana wï¿½adcy caï¿½ego ï¿½wiata
Kwitï¿½a potï¿½ga ludu ziemi
A gdy nastaï¿½y zï¿½e czasy
Gï¿½ï¿½d, zaraza i ï¿½mierï¿½ zbieraï¿½y swe ï¿½niwo
