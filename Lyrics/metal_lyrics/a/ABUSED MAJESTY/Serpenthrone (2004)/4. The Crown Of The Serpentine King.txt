Me, the Moonlit Knight and king's heir
I am giving you all my word
In the face of God, the Father of the World
and the Three immortal old elders
I promise on my sword
and the ancient serpent' soul enchanted in it
To defend the land of our fathers'
- an ancient abode and our nation's graveyard
And if there's such a need to sacrifice my life for them
