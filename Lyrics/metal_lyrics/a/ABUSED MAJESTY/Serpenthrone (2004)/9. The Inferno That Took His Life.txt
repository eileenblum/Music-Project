For the last time corps of the flaming army triumphed outstandingly
The Serpentine King not meeting his death on the battlefield
To keep his promise given the gods
He pointed the blade of his sword towards to his chest

And that's how the last defender of the Temple of Time died
His faithful warriors followed him burning at the stake
To join their master in the flames but this time no one dug their graves
Nor laid them among the ashes for the eternal rest

Their ashes were placed in coffins deep in the Sacred River
And her former course was brought back after the ceremony
When all rituals came to an end and Nida' s waters returned
Flocks of ravens were seen, they flew away from the debris towards the Moon

And that's how the last defender of the Temple of Time died
His faithful warriors followed him burning at the stake
To join their master in the flames but this time no one dug their graves
Nor laid them among the ashes for the eternal rest
