Enough blood sank into our ancestors' land
Let's open the graves, let's awake the dragon of storm
Let the hurricane army led by the ravens' king
Take a heavy toll among the mist

Let every man able to carry a sword
Stand at the bottom of a sacred mountain
To descend to the cave saying prayers
In which the source of living water originates

He will fall asleep there,
It will be a dream of the immortal
And he will wake up after nine days
As flaming Obr, horrendous warrior
A defender of the Earth of a horrifying look

Revived in the flaming dragon from Epireum
Who was sleeping at the roots of the tree of life
He will arise next to his brothers
From the depths of the river of fire, flaming water

A burning army

Wskrzeszony w smoku ognistym z epireum,
Ktï¿½ry spaï¿½ u korzeni drzewa ï¿½ycia
Powstanie u boku swych braci
Z gï¿½ï¿½bin rzeki ognia wï¿½d pï¿½onï¿½cych

Human eyes couldn't perceive a route of the horrifying army
Since at the time storm clouds grabbed the ravens' king
And strode with him across the country
Promising death in pain and torments to the human race's enemies

And he will set off with his secret army
The people of mists turned into the Flaming Serpent
To turn Nida's water red
From the enemies' blood and the ancient law

A burning army
