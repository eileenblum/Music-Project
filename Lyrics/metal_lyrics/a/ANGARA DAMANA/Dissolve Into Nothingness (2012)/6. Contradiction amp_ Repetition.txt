In This Endless Hedge
Where Is The Way Of Salvation?
A Way To Run From Dirt
A way To Run From Oppression
The Last Hatch Of Light In Death Of Dark Eternity
Voided By Hands Of The Hunters Of Due
And No More I See Myself
There Is No One Left With A White Halo Around Him
But Mankind Grows Up In This Chaos And Palms The Life
Like The Worms Torsion Around Themselves
And Make Stairs By Their Corpses
To Keep On Living
But There Is No Return For This Way
And At Last They Will Make A Mountain Of Doubles Facing Them
A Black Mountain That In Top Of It's Peak They Palm The Light
And Heaven,Eternal World,Imaginary World Will Be A Reflection Of Lie
And Will Burn All The Truths
From That Moment God Died In That Paradise
Million Of Unknown Stars Shone
To Tow A Name Like Mankind
To Fierce Life
Were Looking For An Eternal World
Life Should Died In Stone Caves
It Should Ended To Nothing
And Who Am I?
One Of The Million Unknown Stars
My Thought Dry Like A Black

I Dont See The Truth A Dream
I Still Hunt The Blind Dots
And Put Off The Veil Of Mankind From My Face
I Am Deserved To Breath Oxygen
My Inner Thoughts Reveals A Black Future
And The Sun Which Wont Rise Tomorrow
Everything Will Remain In Silence
In A Cold Silence,In Peace
In Darkness,In Nothing
Like Being Born In Deep Vacuum
To Reach Nothing
To Myself,Me And Me
I Still Struggle With Myself
I Will Be Sacrificed For My Thoughts,knotted Thoughts
And Ask My Self?
Where Is The Way Of Freedom?
In A Deep Silence,The Stones Sing
Affection Was A Way For Hatred
In The Night When Salvation Hang
Honesty Was Crying
The Sun Knew That It Could Never rise
The Surging Rivers Stopped
The Clouds Cried,The Earth Devoured It's Self
Like Cosmos Was Dying
The Winds Were Howling
The Color Were Scattering
The red Tears Dropped
Suddenly I Was Facing Darkness
And He Introduced Himself Awareness,A Creature Beyond Good and Bad.
The Son Of Devil.
And Ten Pains Became Visible.
