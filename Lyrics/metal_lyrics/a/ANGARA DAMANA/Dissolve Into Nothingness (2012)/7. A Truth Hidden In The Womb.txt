the troops of darkness fly high in the sky to a dark world where the blood
of the victims is running a spelled an unholy territory and you walk on
the graves of a thousand man from past to now. and you listen to dead
earth's screams fell the darkness, feel the hatred this is a truth from
inside of you this is a truth from within me oh, so dark and hateful so
mighty and able the repeating sentences, repeating poems it is not a
fucking dream this is the reveal of the despise and you feel it when you
are drawn when looking at night's sky and celebrating the birth of
humanity in the black holes of your being. who brings humanity to
perfection? my hands or your will? the silent shouts of the earth's
mothers? or the wondered philosopher of the recent century? or the wet
cheeks of the hungry children? or the feeble screams of the misanthropes?
or the tune of the old, fragile dying man? or this tiredness from the
cruelty of life? who brings humanity to perfection? the civilized material
worshiping man? it is the truth of mankind who lost the humanity and never
comprehended perfection there is never a meaning for human because
salvation is a meaningless phrase.
