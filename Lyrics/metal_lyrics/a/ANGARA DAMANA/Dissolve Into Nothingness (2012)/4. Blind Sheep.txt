Hopeless time Everything Falls Ideas Died One By One When the wounds are
crying And bats are drawn in blood They go to the moon The clouds come and
draw the smiles of the moon in the marsh of lilac Clouds reach from a
still silence of fog And we forget the night by it's dawn The Regret Of
Broken hearts You Trundle In Fucking Pain You couldn't see,you couldn't
feel Like a blinded fold You Bloody whore So shut up and die and Fuck Your
God.
