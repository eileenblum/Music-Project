the cursed nights remember me when the madness of ripping rooted in me the
cursed nights remember me when the branches of hatred surrounded my throat
the cursed nights remember me when the shadow were disgusted of themselves
the cursed nights remember me when the color of white was broken when
lights were dead lights were dead in the lagoons of darkness they were
dying and the scars were crying all were repeating in the isolation of
truth the dirty passages of humanity were destroying and I trundle in my
blood in the midst of the dirts of humanity I rip my body where is hope?
what is beautiful? when everything is stained everything falls when the
human-like pigs butcher everything was dark from the beginning everything
was misfortune and the cursed nights remember me when everything will be
forgotten
