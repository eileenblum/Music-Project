Somewhere Near An Empty Space

Where The Inauspicious Fruit Fell To The Ground
Where The Birth Took Meaning
Where The Beginning Finished To The End
Nothing Began
The Look Of The Yellow leaves
Sleeping In Being Of Annihilation
A Sound Like My Notes
Silent Full Of Ambiguity
Glance Of A Child In Hot Desert
A Cold And Meaningless Calmness
The Voice Of The Hidden Graves
Clapper claw To Reach Death
The Secret Of Neatness And Whiteness Of Time 
The Abstruse And Sick Prism Of Being
Beauty The Abomination Of The Black Lines
The Regret Of The Innocent Walls
Being Under The Burning Flaws Without A Look Proceeding For Being
In a Deep And Human Look Castle,In Remembrance Of Humanity We Swear The Cunning
Adoration's For Existence _ Adoration's To Unfetter
The Battle Of Water And Fire_ The Battle Of Blood And Darkness
Again and again And At The End It Doesn't End Without Good And Bad
To Your Altitude I Fall,Annihilation
Open My Eyes To Your Sky But It Seems Nothing There Again
All Standing In a Deep Castle With Might And Assumption
The Black And Tired Hearts Hail Eternity
Endless Years,Eternal Darkness
A New Age,Age Of No Justice,The Age Of Darkness and Blood
The Age Of Cursed Life,and Empty Age 
As The Darkness Flies In The Sky The Angels Fall
Salvation Dies And Nothing Remains
The Day Of God Death Comes
A Joy Begins With Pain And Suffer
Praying To Anti Christ,Muhammad And Ibrahim
The Lie Dies And Truth Packs
Nothing Begins And Dumb Lands
Then We Bleed,Scream,Tear Ourselves And Experience The Brutality
At Least We Will Love The Darkness
In This Storm Of Blood And Darkness Under The Sand i Will Lay Without A Fire In being and a Whispers At Night.
