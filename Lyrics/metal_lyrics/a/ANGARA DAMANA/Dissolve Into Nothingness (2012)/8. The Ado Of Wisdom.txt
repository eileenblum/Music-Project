I Am Standing In A Bright Circle
I See An Of Reality
A Shadow From Existential Originality
Between Beyond And Truth
Among Protected Minds 

I Can Smell The Dirt 
The Black Lines Of My Mind Are Chained

I Hunt The Empty Spots
And walk Alone
Without Any Plans
Without Any Veils
I Go To No Where
To A Pure Insanity
Where The Evolution Alteration Is Apparent
I Leave Fear To The Dusk
I Merge In Myself
I Banish Myself
In A World Without Actors
I Witness The Crumble Barrier

I Can Smell The Dirt 
The Black Lines Of My Mind Are Chained

A Midst The Arms Of Gods
The Menial Gods 
In Face With Sin
Falling Wait For Me
But I'm Still Standing
In The Bosom Of The Darkness Insanity
Among The Existential Truth Of Mine
In A Battle A Midst The Sick Minds 
I Have Nothing To Show The Beauty
Answer Are Among The Shadows
I'm Standing In a Bright Circle
Between Beyond And Truth
Among Protected Minds
Maybe Should Go Back Wards
