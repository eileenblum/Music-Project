Soy, canola, corn, and cotton.
The food chain's controlled by a syndicate of greed.

Scourging the world with PCB, aspartam and rBST.
Acreages poisoned, dead for years.
Contaminated food causing subconscious fear.

Disposability created by industrialists playing god.

Scourging the world with PCB, aspartam and rBST.
Acreages poisoned, dead for years.
Contaminated food causing subconscious fear.
