Thousands of years ago was thought to civilize
to distinguish from the beasts,
to reign the earth, the seas, the sky.
But as fate would have it, for every step forward,
two have been made back and the world became a wreck.
Superiority and self praise.
Intelligence is a curse, inventing rules.
Finance was installed to enslave the will of man.
Total control of the masses, sick as shit, a master plan.
