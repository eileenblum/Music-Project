Multi billion contracts, manufactures of  death.
Politics and armed forces become linked to commerce.
Shiny trigger and itchy finger.
Unlike men, the bullets linger.
Tool of death, forged from metal.
Mass production, the purpose is lethal.
Detonation-heads added to the hulls,
created to finally intrude enemy skulls.
Bullets are forever.
