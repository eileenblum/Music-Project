Born in crates and mutilated at birth,
45 days of abnormal growth,
feeding on hormones and antibiotics,
constantly living in feces and urine.

Sick and infected, maybe cannibalized.
Never seen the light of day.

Shackled upside down by their legs,
stunned by immersing their heads
in electrically charged water tanks,
then beheaded or killed by bleeding.

Sick and infected, maybe cannibalized.
Never seen the light of day.

The carcass gets soaked in a chlorine bath
to remove the smell and the slime,
dismembered and shipped to the grocery store,
destined for your dinner plate.
this is your fate!
