Living the nightmare of immutable things,
of evanescent dreams.
Lost in time, inside me hell!
I can't relief the tension inside.
I can not stop feeling like...

Living the nightmare, things never change.
Living the nightmare, bound to the same.

Things never change.
The living nightmare falls and rises again,
tortured by thoughts, vacuumed brain.
Endless efforts of living the nightmare
of emotions never felt before.

Living the nightmare, the living nightmare.
