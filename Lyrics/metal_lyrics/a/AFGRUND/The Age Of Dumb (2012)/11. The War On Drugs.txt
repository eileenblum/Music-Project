We call on you to end the war on drugs.
The prohibition regime, a war on us.
This prohibition regime has had its time.
It fuels violent organized crime and devastates lives.

Busted for a roach, it's time for humane approach.
The war on drugs, a war on us.

Powerful lobbies still stand in the way of change.
Prison departments whose budgets are at stake.
Politicians fear the alternative approaches
as they will appear weak on laws and orders.

Busted for a roach, it's time for humane approach.
The war on drugs, a war on us.
