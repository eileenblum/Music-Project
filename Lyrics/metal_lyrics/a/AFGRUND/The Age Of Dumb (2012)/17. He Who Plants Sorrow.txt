When will we ever learn that it's us we destroy?
He who plants sorrow, made to collect our hate.
Chemically enhanced, grows from nothing and
emptiness.
Children scream unheard while we stand quite.
Ten thousand guards stand strong, safety denied.

Destroyers and generals, heroes and gods
they all laugh when this whole circus burns.

Inherited beliefs and thoughts of bloodshed.
Dreamers of the sky lie face down in asphalt.
Risen heads pressed under the surface.
Everyone silenced, ready for the furnace.
If human is the scale, it's the one measuring death.

Heroes and gods,
they all laugh when this whole circus burns
