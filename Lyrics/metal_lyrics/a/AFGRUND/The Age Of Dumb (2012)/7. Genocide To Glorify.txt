For eversince, since men can think, men beat their heads.
Gods, churches and traditions cause millions of dead.
In the name of any dogma, senseless wars are declared.
According to the crusades no one was ever spared.
Genocide to glorify. Your god ain't mine.
A willingness to kill for a doubtful presumption,
to even act out totalitarian and self-righteous.

We all share a single idiocy
and still need different gods,
sticking to all the stale fairytales
and the rotten frauds.

Genocide to glorify. Your god ain't mine.

God, man made bullshit.
Fraud feeding on the stupid.
War, to kill all the infidels.

Choke! Choke on your invented gods.
