Corporations mean hidden phases of production.
Corporations mean total contamination.

Discorporate the corporations.

Free the earth from C.E.O.s.
Rid the capitalist cancer
or wait how far this story goes.

Corporations mean economic power and greed.
Corporations mean a culture of commodification.
Corporations mean bleeding the third world.
Corporation in fact means social control.

Discorporate the corporations,
witness an alternative world.

Think globally, act locally. Break free from the chains.
