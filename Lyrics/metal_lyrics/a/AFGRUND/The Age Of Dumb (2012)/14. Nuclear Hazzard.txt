Leaking containers of toxic waste.
Uranium  and Plutonium polluting this place.
Contaminated radiation leftovers
dumped in soil and waters.
Cursed to behold the atomic menace.
Extinction of the human race.
Sneaky, creepy, crawling death.
Particles even infiltrate by breath.
Infecting blood, affecting the growth of cells.
Cleansed landscapes, a vision of hell.
Even the smallest half-life will outlast us all.
Barrels buried in saline mines
or at wastelands and deserts all over the world.
Left to rot, forever seeping into the ground.
A jurisdiction, so unclear and blurred.
