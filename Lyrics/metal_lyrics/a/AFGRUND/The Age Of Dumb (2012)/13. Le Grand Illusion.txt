24 hours feeding crap.
There's another carnage displayed on the news.
Bloody sensations, cruel indeed.
Millions stick to their screens to catch a view.
The better the more one bleeds.
In need for a master, the guide of the guides,
the screen will tell us how to survive.

Prayers to the altar of frames.
24/7 without a break.

Minds shaded by a never ending rerun.
Beyond intellectual evaluation.
Reduced to a lifeless hull.
Prayers to their evil installations.
Families interchanges,
talk shows to keep the brains in check,
documentary soaps, wrecking of all eloquence.
Trapped in shallow consciousness, forever and a day.
A new star born out of a casting will blow all concerns away.

Prayers to the altar of frames, 24 hours feeding waste.
24 frames the eyes can take. 24/7 withput a break.
