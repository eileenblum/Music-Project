The might of a nation, only laws and restrictions.
The might of a nation is lies and repression.

The might of a nation does not allow rebellion,
it represses and crushes you, denies you your future.

Promises of life, reality of death.
Illusions of progress while millions beg.
Approve their power, approve your death.
No more poor men fighting,
killing and dying in rich men's wars.

The might of a nation.
