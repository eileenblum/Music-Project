The seven signs of war
will soon appear once more
a rise of the damned
will cover the land

a force so dark
it's feared by angels
a wrath beyond
the rage of demons

those ancient signs of war
appear in the blood-red sky
demonic shouts for murder
as they see the signs of pandemonium

a war...declared
upon...the world
the kingdom...of christ
will...fall!

those are the ancient...
demonic...
unholy signs of war!
