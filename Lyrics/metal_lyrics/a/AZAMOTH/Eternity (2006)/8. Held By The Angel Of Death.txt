A pain from deep inside
devouring your soul and making you blind,
your mind can not go free,
a closing feeling, you cannot flee

A fear so strong,
you feel left alone,
a meaningless life
and all you wish is to die

Held and caressed
By The Angel Of Death,
a dark and destroying
feeling of wrath

The mind is covered
by mist and fog,
no thoughts remain,
no self-control

And only one wish remains
within the mind,
a dark and destroying
wish to die
