Within the night's ghastly embrace
they live on flesh of righteous men,
lurking in the darkened woods,
rulers of the nighty domain

Cryptic beasts of an unholy race,
guardians of the unholy light,
a horde of demon troops,
these beasts are the kings of the night

The call of the night
from beyond the grave,
arising from darkness
for the holy blood they crave

Nocturnal demons
of Satanic source,
on human flesh
they feed their force

Sounds of slaughter will spread through the night
as their army marches to fight
Pain and terror as the moon shines in red,
the doom of the world will now spread

A call so dark
from beyond the grave,
arising from the darkness
for the holy blood they crave
