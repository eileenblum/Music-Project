Eternal suffer, 
abandoned soul, 
alone in darkness, 
away from all

A blinding sorrow, 
curse of immortality, 
a burning pain 
for all Eternity

Within the halls of Hell I'm sitting all alone, 
shadows rising by my sides, 
this hall will forever be my throne 
for I am cursed Eternally

A built up anger from beneath the skin, 
a burning lust to kill from deep within, 
a hatred that runs so deep inside, 
a wish to slay the human kind

A tightened grip across the axe, 
charge into war as if possessed, 
to bring the doom upon humanity, 
to crush the world for all Eternity

As night covers the sky 
I will rise and all will die
