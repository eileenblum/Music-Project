A Bloody Dawn slowly eats the night;
we step on the battlefield, ready to fight
Our mighty blades are raised up high,
we shout together: "our foes shall die!"

We charge to war, towards the unknown,
we'll fight all day and then wait for the next Bloody Dawn

Misty frost and crimson sky
will cover all the world tonight,
now will come the judgment day,
Lucifer will rise to reign

The demon army will charge into the night,
until the Dawn they'll stand and fight

We are the troops of Hell,
fighting the unholy war,
we are fighting for the dark lord
and that the angels won't live to see
the next Bloody Dawn

The angelic reign will come to its end;
a Bloody Dawn will rise upon the land
