From the broken battlefield
an undead Horde marches on,
eliminating the souls within,
the corpses of the slaughtered men

An army raised with one single purpose,
demonic power within the rotten troops,
it is the army of the apocalypse,
they have no mercy, they have no remorse

Now they rise to join the Horde,
they shall never lie in the dirt
Indestructible undead Horde,
these walking dead only answer to one lord

The righteous shall fallâ¦
in front of the dark lord's force
The righteous will fallâ¦
in front of the Eternal Horde

Soon this army will charge with another war,
with Satan's power they shall cleanse the world,
destroying every Christian sign,
destroying every Christian life
