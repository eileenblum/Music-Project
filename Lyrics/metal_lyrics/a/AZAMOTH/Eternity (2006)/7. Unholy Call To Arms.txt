A lost soul, forsaken spirit,
born in the eternal flames of Hell,
a warlord arising from below,
the unholy path is his only way

Sons of fire,
creatures of the night,
gather all your strength
and you unholy might

Unholy beings
will rise at night
to join the new cause,
to join the deathknight

The believers
will wake up and take one last breath
but all they'll feel
is the stench of death

The winds of chaos
will blow once more;
a Hellish force
will be unleashed upon the world

The chains of death
will bind the land;
the screams of pain
will never end

The lost signs of Hell,
the rising Call To Arms of the damned
