Black blood
runs in his unholy veins,
a warrior of Hell,
with his mind set to revenge

His mind set to revenge

As ancient as the northern mountains,
a dark strider walking the land

The leader of the Eternal Horde,
walking the land on an unholy crusade

He won't stop until he has his revenge
For he has sold his soul for the chance to avenge

A warrior From The Land Of Ice,
fire burns in his eyes,
his wrath will be unleashed upon the world,
his mighty foes will fall

Black blood
runs in his unholy veins,
he's walking the land
thirsty for his unholy revenge

His saga will never end
