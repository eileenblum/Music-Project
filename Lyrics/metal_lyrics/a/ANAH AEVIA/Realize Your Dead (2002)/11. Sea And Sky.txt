The sky fades away, it all began as smiles and laughter. You fade away into 
my arms. The sky fades away, it all began as smiles and laughter. You fade away 
into my arms. Love lost, the weapon still in my hands. The agony begins. 
Lost, the weapon still in my hands. The agony begins. you fade away. The agony is 
over, the agony begins.
