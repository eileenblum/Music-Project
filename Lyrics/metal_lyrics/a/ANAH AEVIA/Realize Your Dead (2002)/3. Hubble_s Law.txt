For so long I have wished that dreaming would be enough but the reality is 
driven by your tears. Today I was made helpless. His hands struck deep within. 
Tonight the stars wont shine so bright. buried beneath the fallen sky. consumed 
beneath the endless stars. today your quiet voice tore through my heart. 
Today I was made helpless. Your quiet voice tore through my heart. His hands stuck 
deep within. Tonight the stars wont shine as bright.
