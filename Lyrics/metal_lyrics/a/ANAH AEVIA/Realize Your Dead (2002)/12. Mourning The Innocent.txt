The hour is drawing nearer as I approach the room. Now fear will end and my 
life will continue. These memories will fall, I'll never see you cry. All I 
want is to live a normal life. My eyes have yet to open and already I have wounds 
that will never heal, you let my heartbeat fade. I shut my eyes, the light 
fades, as I descend to a perfect state. I shut my eyes, the light fades, as I 
descend to a perfect state. Father embrace in silence. Don't ever climb down to 
face the truth, I try to scream but it is without sound. Heal the scars that 
present themselves, longing for separation from yourself. You murderer. You let 
me bleed. You murder, you have forsaken me. I see through unclouded eyes, I 
see the innocent suffer. My eyes have watched the wounded, begging to touch the 
ground. I would scream but there are no words and they have only silence.
