Eyes locked upon the flesh, staring watching God's plan dismantled. Eyes 
locked upon the flesh, staring watching God's plan dismantled. eyes asphyxiate, 
misery is my consequence. Eyes asphyxiate, misery is my consequence. The eyes 
that burn into the skin. The eyes i should have gouged out one thousand times. 
The eyes that rape God's beauty. Why are you still alive?. Eyes, locked upon 
the flesh staring watching God's plan dismantled.
