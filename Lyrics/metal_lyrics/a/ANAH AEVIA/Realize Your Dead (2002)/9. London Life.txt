Please take this knife from my back so I can drive it through your cold heart 
and let your tears flow like a river racing towards your palms and emptying 
onto the bed on which we laid for years. Its been four years and I still 
haven't forgotten. When will this river wash away the tears. Its been four years 
wash away the tears. Please take this knife from my back so I can drive it 
through your heart.
