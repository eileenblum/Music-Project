Cancer !
My time is short.
Save me !
I can count my days.
My body hurts.
Save me !
When will be the time that I die ?

Hope is fading.
Save me !
Thoughts of suicide.
My mind is dark.
Save me !
Crying day and night.

My loss of life,
is my loss of time !

Your body is filled 
with deadly tumors indeed.
No hope for a cure,
it will only last some days

No way, listen to my words,
you bloody damned disease,
you will never get me down !
There are so many things in life 
I've never have seen before 
and that's why I don't want to die !

My will to live is strong enough -
that is the best medicine.
No chance for the sickness
to steal my power to be alive!

Cancer !
My time is short.
Save me !
I can count my days.
My body hurts.
Save me !
When will be the time that I die ?

Hope is fading.
Save me !
Thoughts of suicide.
My mind is dark.
Save me !
Crying day and night.
