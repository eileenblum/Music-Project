Blind !
I am blind !

Darkness surrounds my eyes -
I feel a never known insecurity !

Panic-
what happened to me ?
Yesterday I still could see !
Stumbling around,
falling again,
bleeding wounds -
crashed onto the ground...

What is the cause,
what have I done?
Can it be a sentence for my sins ?
Not to endure,
I feel sick,
rathert being dead than to live
within corrosive eclipse !

Everlasting darkness -
my own hell became real !

First time that I pray to a god,
of that I know that doesn' t exist.

Darkness surrounds my eyes -
I feel a never known insecurity !

Panic-
what happened to me ?
Yesterday I still could see !
Stumbling around,
falling again,
bleeding wounds -
crashed onto the ground...

Not to endure,
I feel sick,
rathert being dead than to live
within corrosive eclipse !
