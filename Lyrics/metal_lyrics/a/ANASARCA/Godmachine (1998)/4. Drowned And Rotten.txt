I' m walking along a river,
enjoying harmony of nature.
The water' s shining bright, 
suddenly my eyes notice 
human clothing inside.

While I realize
the human corpse of a man,
I try to pull him out,
try to get his arm,
I want to bring him near.

I' m falling back,
in my hands the rotten flesh,
inside a sleeve -
torn of the stinking corpse.

Drowned and Rotten

He must have been inside the water
for more than seven weeks...

Disgusting to see how flesh detaches of the bones.
Terrible smell, my stomach turns around,
vomiting into the water ,
leaving the corpse inside.

Drowned and Rotten
