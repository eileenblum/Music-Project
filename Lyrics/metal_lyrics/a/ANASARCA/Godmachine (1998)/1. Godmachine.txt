They thought to be machines of a god.
Killing, tormenting and nailing to crosses.
Brutality, inhuman violence and hate
their way to teach christianity - 
christianity?

Blood dripped of their armors,
heads they pierced on wooden pales.
"Thou shall not kill!",
was a commandment the heathen should obey.

With a cross on their robe,
the sword in their hand,
they tried to convert the "heathen".
Seven crusades in the name of god,
massacres - to teach them lies.

Hate against all godless creatures - hate

The church of death -
manipulating human behaviour.
The church of lies -
sacrificing living beings.
Church of the sick -
mentally deranged.
Church of the blind -
crowd of weird fanatics,
animals as "godmachines"!

They thought to be machines of a god.
Killing, tormenting and nailing to crosses.
Brutality, inhuman violence and hate
their way to teach christianity.

Ignorance of dogmas .
Just like animals, 
these "godmachines"!
