Suffering -
life is brutal,
my mind is weak.
I can never endure
(the) confusions in my head !

Daily increase of hostility,
may I become mad ?
Resignation -
What can I do ?
This will ever be 
like thorns in my head !

Exploding dreams,
destruction of my own world.
Never to see -
the ending of consuming my soul !

You' re blowing out
the flames of my illusions.

Out of control ...

Conscience is fading,
it is out of control !
My eyes turn black, 
my emotions turn to hate !

Turn to hate ...

Life seems to be like a never ending corridor,
it' s so weird and obscure.

Exploding dreams,
destruction of my own world.
Never to see -
the ending of consuming my soul !
