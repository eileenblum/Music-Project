Pain that grows
No one knows what happens to me
Degenerating body
No one knows what happens to me
Head explodes, my mind collapses
Suffocate, lungs hurt and terribly tear
I'm dying â I'm fucking dying
Head explodes, my mind collapses
Suffocate, lungs hurt and terribly tear
Bones break in simple actions
Arduously dying is what I fear
I'm dying â I'm fucking dying
Head explodes, my mind collapses
Suffocate, lungs hurt and terribly tear
Bones break in simple actions
Arduously dying is what I fear
Who the hell can solve my dying mystery?
Who the hell is able to help me?
I just want to know why I have to die
Head explodes, my mind collapses
Suffocate, lungs hurt and terribly tear
I'm dying â I'm fucking dying
Head explodes, my mind collapses
Suffocate, lungs hurt and terribly tear
Bones break in simple actions
Arduously dying is what I fear
