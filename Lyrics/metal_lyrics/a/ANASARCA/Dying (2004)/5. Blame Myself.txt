Did I mention that I was dying?
Terminal cancer of the lung
Metastasized to my bones and some too my brain
I'm really pretty fucking pissed
Had a really shitty life
And can't really blame anyone but me for that
I can only blame myself
I could blame the tobacco companies
But I'm the one that smoked
They only make a living selling them
I could blame my mom and dad
But they did the best they could do
And so did I, goddamn it
I could blame a god
But I don't believe in that anymore
There's no fucking god
I've got a few months left
They could be the worst months of my life
If I let them try to enjoy them as much as I can
I have no hope
Early on, I hoped to be cured
To be that one in 100
That lung cancer survived
I'm not that lucky though
My luck ran out when my brother gave me the coffin nails
When I was 9
I can only blame myself
I could blame the tobacco companies
But I'm the one that smoked
They only make a living selling them
I can only fucking blame myself
