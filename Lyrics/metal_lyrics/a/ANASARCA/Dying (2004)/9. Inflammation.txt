Extreme fever, pain of the neck
Pain in the head
Awareness disfunction, consciousness
Bleeding of the skin
Bacterias carried by blood
Cause heart malfunction
Regurgitation nausea
Within hours it's possible to die
Germs existing in liquids
Not every affected falls sick
Germs existing in liquids within hours they could die
Blood pressure in the brain grows dangerously
Outer walls of the cells are under attack
Hallucinations, confusedness
Lethargy, irascibility
Apathetic, restlessly
Extreme fever, pain of the neck
Pain in the head
Awareness disfunction, consciousness
Bleeding of the skin
Bacterias carried by blood
Cause heart malfunction
Regurgitation nausea
Within hours it's possible to die
Germs existing in liquids
Not every affected fals sick
Germs existing in liquids
Withon hours they will die
