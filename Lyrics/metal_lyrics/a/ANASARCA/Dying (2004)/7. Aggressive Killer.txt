Smoke hangs in the air of the dying room
In it someone lies dying of cancer
Bald from chemo his head lolls
On a pillow dying of cancer
Eyes are open but he can no longer respond
Dying of cancer
The bones of his cheeks and shoulders
Protrude under taut skin
Cancer's now eating lungs and liver
Thinking of the past, impossible turn back
Cell lung cancer â aggressive killer
Symptoms easily ignored
Cell lung cancer â aggressive killer
Within some weeks it takes a life
Smoke hangs in the air of the dying room
In it someone lies dying of cancer
Cell lung cancer â aggressive killer
Bald from chemo his head lolls
On a pillow dying of cancer
Eyes are open but he can no longer respond
Dying of cancer
Cell lung cancer â aggressive killer
