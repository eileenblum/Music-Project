Just a normal day, I went for dinner
Suddenly it became very cold
Attack of shuddering, pain left side
Laid me down into a bed
Pain became more intense
Coldness grew â unconsciousness
Stood up, walked away, fell down stairs
Infusions of blood were given â no chance for a cure
10 days I spent in a clinic
10 days to know more and more
10 days to realize I'm dying
My thoughts of death became the core
Therapy for the dying
Treatments without a sense
Coldness grew â unconsciousness
Cold communication
No one really cares for me
Insignificant blather
No one calmes me down
10 days I spent in a clinic
10 days to know more and more
10 days to realize I'm dying
My thoughts of death became the core
