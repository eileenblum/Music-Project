Cancer has spread to my entire body
Weakness keeps me in bed most of the time
I'm terrified of losing my mind
Brain cancer steals my ability to think
I fear that I'm soon unable to communicate
I don't want to die after such a long struggle and pain
I don't want to suffer at the end of my life
I just wanna quick death
I'm dying, but death isn't quite imminent
I'm dying and I decide the exact point of time myself
Accumulated drugs
I can hasten death
Before I fall into a coma
Before I will die in pain
Cancer has spread to my entire body
Weakness keeps me in bed most of the time
I'm terrified of losing my mind
Brain cancer steals my ability to think
I fear that I'm soon unable to communicate
