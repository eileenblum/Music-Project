The mortal sick can't ignore the sickness anymore
New surgeries take place new symptoms occur
Becoming wretched and weak no more laughs
Growing feelings of a terrible loss
Numbness, stoicism, anger and wrath soon will move
Enormous pain, preparing the final goodbye
Feelings on guilt, depressions, distress
Desponded questions about a child to care for
No make up for the sickness and approaching death
Trying to imaging everything is solved after one has gone
Trying to release, release the own existence on earth
The loss of a loved one â is an eternal pain
Sick are about to lose everyone they ever loved
Failed in healthy days?
Failed which ignoring the symptoms?
Responsible for the sorrow they feel?
Responsible for my pain?
Becoming wretched and weak, no more laughs
Growing feelings of a terrible loss
Numbness, stoicism, anger and wrath soon will move
Enormous pain, preparing the final goodbye
The loss of a loved one â is an eternal pain
Sick are about to lose everyone they ever loved
