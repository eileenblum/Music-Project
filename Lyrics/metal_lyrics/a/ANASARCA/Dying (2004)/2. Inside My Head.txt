I lost my hair â first round of chemo
As I blew out my candles
I thought about the next year as I always do
Very easy having cancer
Cause you do not know you have it at that time
Very easy having cancer
Until it starts catching up with you
I do not think of myself as a cancer patient everyday
No thoughts of dying
But just enough to bring me down again
I want to talk about the cancer inside my head
The mental disease that I feel
Maybe one day I will have a child and die
If my cancer comes back
Maybe after, when it is older...
No attendance in it's life
If my cancer comes back
No one ever wants to hear it
That any day a bomb will drop again
I'm in war with my own body
This is my personal Vietnam
I lost my hair â first round of chemo
As I blew out my candles
I thought about the next year as I always do
Very easy having cancer
Cause you do not know you have it at that time
Very easy having cancer
Until it starts catching up with you
I do not think of myself as a cancer patient everyday
No thoughts of dying
But just enough to bring me down again
Pain inside my head
