[based on "No More" by Robert Atworth]

Fleeting glory, purgatory
This is not a bedtime story

Holy boat, sink or float
Learn to cope
Or abandon hope

One more tale, one more child
One more mind that's created wild
One more blank stare, one more trauma
One more psycho/socio drama
One more nightmare, one more crime
One more craving, one last time
One more outcast whose blood runs cold
One more victim who won't grow old

No more torture
and no more laws

No more systematic flaws
No more rented empty cell
No more living so:..NO MORE HELL!!!!!

No more ...

One more nightmare, one more crime
One more craving, one last time
One more outcast whose blood runs cold
One more victim who won't grow old

No more torture
and no more laws

No more systematic flaws
No more rented empty cell
No more living so:..NO MORE HELL!!!!!
