[based on "Those Who have Eyes to See Will See" by Willie Christopher Tucker]

Eight months pregnant.
Homeless crack addict
from the south side of town.
Angel All alone.

Can't decide
If to confide.

Caught in a lifestyle
for which she knows no relief. 
Day after day,
Night after night,
utterly impoverished
surrounded by filth. 
Depressed,
and wishing she were dead.

Low self- esteem,
only seventeen.

Been molested,
been raped,
been beaten to the ground 
been molested,
been raped,
by the men that promised 
to keep her safe and sound.

Low self- esteem,
only seventeen.

Forced to sell her body
and tormented soul - 
Depressed,
and wishing she were dead.

Talking to her unborn child -
no one else listens to what she says. 
"How long God must I suffer this way,
Please don't force me to endure another day"

Angel is pregnant -
baby, one month due. 
I remember her say -
those who have eyes to see
Will see.

In what she said
I surmised
That look on her face -
with tears in her eyes.

To escape her pain
she decides life ain't worth livin'.
Angel walks into the path
of the Marta Train,
The nine forty- five.
