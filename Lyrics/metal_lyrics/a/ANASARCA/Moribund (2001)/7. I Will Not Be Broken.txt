[based on "I will not be broken" by Robert Atworth]

Daggers of fear 
brandish my skin
I believe I'm innocent 
Of this sin
The accusation 
of being a coward 
bounces off 
my rubber mask
just a word
They try to get me 
to fall apart 
try to get into my heart.

They circle around me chanting
wild phrases
They mix me up inside
vast mazes
But I am not broken.
words are useless now to me
action are decisions lost at sea.

I fight with the power to heal wounds
I fight with the hope it will be over soon.
I fight with the will that unbroken win.
I fight with the dagger sticking my skin.

But I will not be broken.

Now they try to take my pride
but all my tears have chosen to hide.

I cannot weep, 
I cannot lose hope, 
I must fight.
I must fight through the day
I must fight into the faded night.

Daggers of fear 
brandish my skin
I believe I'm innocent 
Of this sin
The accusation 
of being a coward 
bounces off 
my rubber mask
just a word
They try to get me 
to fall apart 
try to get into my heart.
