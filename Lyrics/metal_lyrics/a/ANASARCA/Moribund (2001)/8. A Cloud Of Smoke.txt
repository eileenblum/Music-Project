[based on "A Cloud of Smoke" by an unknown author]

In the haze of darkness 
I remember it like yesterday 
Someone I once used to be 
And then it fades away 
I feel it around the corner 
A thought I never had 
I see it in the mirror 
And the reflections make me sad 

It's a smoke like no other 
A scent I can not smell 
A story I vaguely remember 
With words I can not tell 

And then like the morning 
When I find myself awake 
A dream that has faded gone 
Was it my mistake? 

But like the ripple of the waves 
It fades away like mist 
And so I keep on searching 
For what I just might be 

Looking under every rock 
Until I finally will see 

And in the darkness there is light 
The truth becomes all clear 
The words of wisdom answer me 
What I seek is near 

In a cave I find it 
Dusty, dark, and old 
The memories returning 
My story can be told 

Reality is fleeting 
My loved ones fade away 
But of that which I have seen 
The memories will stay
