[based on "Signs of Life" by Robert Atworth]

Eyes on the noose- signs of abuse
Cries for help- noone comes
Look to the skies- see only lies
Abandoned soul growing numb

I suffer::
Therefore I am

Try to hold back the flood
Nailed to a cross in the crack
At the base of the dam
How do I know I'm in love?

There's always been only one
Set of footprints in the sand
How do I know I'm alive?
How do I know I'm alone?

Generations of blood on the walls
Nothin' changes but the price
Still they ban all they can
This ain't nothin' nice

Demonic urge- storm waters surge
Buzz getting louder- trail of powder

I suffer::
Therefore I am
