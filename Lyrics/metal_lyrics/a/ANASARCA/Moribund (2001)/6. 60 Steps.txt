[based on "60 Steps" by Carlos Santana]

The man of the struggle, 
In his search for solace, 
He tries to focus on
and rest in the eye of the storm.

He sees no future for himself,
only an endless, empty present, 
Which induces him to cry -
to cry out indignantly

about his terrible loneliness,
about the cruelty of people. 
He cannot understand -
and tries to find shadows to hide his face.

Sister memory is ever present with him, torturing him with the past.
He calls to mind the best moments of his pleasant life.

The horror of such a place. 
There seems to be no hope, 
The pain of losing everything he loves
no death that could relieve his suffering -
Nothing could relieve his suffering

The man of the struggle, 
In his search for solace, 
He tries to focus on
and rest in the eye of the storm.

He sees no future for himself,
only an endless, empty present, 
Which induces him to cry -
to cry out indignantly

about his terrible loneliness,
about the cruelty of people. 
He cannot understand -
and soon his journey will reach the end!
