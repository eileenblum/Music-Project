[based on "I Against I" by Anthony W. Ehlers]

I am the person who haunts your dreams 
I make it so nothing is as it seems 
I am the one who shatters all your illusions 
I'm the one who causes your confusion 
I'm the one who makes you turn on the light 
When I come and scare you late at night
Is the truth finally coming through?
Staring deeper into the mirror
Have you found out that I am you ?....
