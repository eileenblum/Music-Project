[Lyrics by Carlos Garcia]

I've gored my chest
Chucked a bleeding, beating pulp into ice cold waters
Rushing into nothingness
My soul is gone, my body's dead

A limp and lifeless shell, an empty soulless thing
a reptile shedding skin, a brand new side of me
This is my revolution, my conclusion
Of the world, a wicked place
Filled with shallow, selfish creatures
Tearing at my flesh

To whom it may concern
I'd love to watch you burn
A parasitic pandemic
The bane of my existence

No karma for the wicked, Ignorance is bliss
The lucky ones are left digging through the shit
This is my revolution, my conclusion
Of the world, a wicked place
Filled with heartless, evil creatures
Ripping at my flesh
