[Lyrics by Carlos Garcia]

Lights. Camera. Action
A superstar with a fatal attraction
Bare flesh with makeup to hide the scars
You look so glamorous begging from your knees
Doing everything it takes for a life of luxury
(To lose integrity)

X-rated and jaded, your purity is penetrated
You've sold your soul
Congratulations, you've made it
Derailed, for sale, the back of your throat impaled
You love to be on top, but you've failed

Welcome to Hollywood
Where all your dreams come true
Abandon everything
This is the price of fame

Gag on this, it'll take you to the top
