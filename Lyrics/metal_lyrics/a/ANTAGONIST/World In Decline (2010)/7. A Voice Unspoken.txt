27 murdered in the streets
Peace to violence, violence to peace
A public execution becomes reality
Immortalized for the world to see

This is the price of freedom
This is the price she paid
Innocence betrayed
Open your fucking eyes
It's time to realize
This happens every day

Tehran, a place of protest
Ancient necropolis
Images ingrained forever
Angel of Iran, a nightmare that never ends
We raise our fists in your honor

We the people, ice in our veins
Pandemonium, all hope is shot

A voice of a generation
Yet she didn't say a word
A face so unforgettable
Until we meet again

Neda, angel of Iran
Neda, the world won't soon forget
Your face, the cause you died for
