I saw you bleeding on the cross
You didn't die for me, my people did!
Your followers destroyed a culture
You stripped them of their pride, you stripped them of their lives (they bled for me) you just made them bleed
I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees
Mouth of the oppressor speaks the word of god
The speech of ignorance, the grip of fear, the sound of the end
As I pray you'll be more forgiving than the ones who speak your name
With all your love, how could you take someone away?
Don't you know what you've caused?
And as I awaken from this dream, my eyes are open
This nightmare ensues/i remember, you don't exist
You don't exist!
