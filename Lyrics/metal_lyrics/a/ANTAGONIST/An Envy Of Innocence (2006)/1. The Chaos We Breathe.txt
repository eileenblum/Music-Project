Long for a time of purity, a blindfold on to shroud the pain
The child lies deep within, reflections of the past
The truth is sinking in, my dream world fading fast
An envy of the innocence we once possessed
Giving back, a sacrifice, the power to make things right
Through this war, don't let go, an inspiration to us all
A new and harsh reality, this is the chaos that we breathe
A world plagued with a deep insanity, this is the chaos that we breathe
You mean everything to me, don't let go of this
Persistence will light the path, keep reaching for the best
To fall is human, to rise, the strength to carry on
A new and harsh reality, this is the chaos that we breathe
