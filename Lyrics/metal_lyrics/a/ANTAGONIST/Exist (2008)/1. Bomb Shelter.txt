A dialogue, inaudible
Above the ground, nightmares exist
An absolute catastrophe
Our fear, our weakness shining through
We did it to ourselves
Writings no one will read
Sounds no one will hear
Open the door and shield your eyes
Witness the horror you've always denied
A holocaust beyond the walls
But within our hearts, dreams still exist
A fight for humanity
This is the way legends are made
Against all odds, we'll live again
This is the end, a time to begin
Plant the seeds, they'll grow in time
We'll live again
