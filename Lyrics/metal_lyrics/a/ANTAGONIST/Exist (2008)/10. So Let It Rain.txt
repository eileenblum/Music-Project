A cough so dry, it tears flesh away
Brittle nails, I'm biting again
Scratch and burn, old and used
But ready to make anew
Ready for what's coming next
I wouldn't have it any other way
The storm is coming
Dark clouds above
Engulf me, engulf us all
Our throats are dry, renew us
Give us life, give us strength
Mother nature, the almighty, let it rain
Give us life, give us strength, so let it rain
Drown our corpses
Wash us away, sweep us into the gutters
Rebirth of I, a path not made for the weak
But that worth living for
Worth dying for, stays the same
Always, my home, so let it rain
Constant change, forever in motion
