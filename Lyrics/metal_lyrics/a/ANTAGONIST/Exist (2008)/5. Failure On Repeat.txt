Somewhere in my head
Weakness makes me invincible
This place does not exist
Nowhere can I be myself
If only I'd enjoy the suffering
Welcome to reality
A place where weakness is destroyed
Watch it spiral down
Into the darkest hole
I close my eyes
And hope to hit the floor
Watch me spiral down
Repeating all my woes
Hear my failing words
They echo
