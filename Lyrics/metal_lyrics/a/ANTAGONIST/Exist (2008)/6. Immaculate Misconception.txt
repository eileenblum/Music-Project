If I could crush my skull
If I could examine my thoughts
What the fuck would I see?
It's all so different
Life has been raped
Love has been executed
Excreted through bowels of infestation
I always knew love smelled like shit
This force is pulling me away, closer to the dark
Eclipse the light
Now I feel the presence, the power, the darkness
It lives inside
You're not immaculate, just a misconception
Impregnated with animosity
