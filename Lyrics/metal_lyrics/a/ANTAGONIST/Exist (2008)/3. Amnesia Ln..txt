Sometimes you have to
Burn your bridges
And never look back
Cut the ones who never gave back
Bite your tongue
Til it bleeds and writhes
Just to keep this enmity inside
I stop these tears
And hold my head up high
I face my fears
And keep hope alive
A test in solitude
Your face only makes it burn
Feet planted firmly
Fists clenched tightly
Dyslexic messages
Read between the lines
Just let it go, let it die
My silence holds strength
When worlds cannot explain
