You tremble at the thought
A story in your tears
This means so much more
Textbooks cannot explain
The tragic history of man
The innocents, the bloodshed
Don't pray for him
False sermons for the frail
Pray for a change
Pray it's almost over
Familiar faces overhead
Memories fall from sullen eyes
Fallen soldier, hear these words
In your honor, we unite
Fallen friend, hear my cries
In your name, we'll continue to fight
This is all too real, all too familiar
What this generation needs now is a revolution
We'll fight, not in the name of a three-way lie
But in the name of our brothers,
Our sisters, our mothers, and our fathers
With death comes life
