The eyes surrounding
The pressure is mounting
Billions of fingers pointing the blame
Your words are whispered
Your smirks like pistols
Loaded and ready to fire
All alone I'm helpless (so helpless)
But all together we can do this
For each other, for ourselves
Heart is all it takes
Trapped in every direction
As darkness encircles
But I know there's a light
I could feel it inside
Heart is all it takes
