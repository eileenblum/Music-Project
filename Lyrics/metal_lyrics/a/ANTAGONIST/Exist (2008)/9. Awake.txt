I had a dream last night
You were standing at my door
Welcome home, lifeless shadow
To give is to receive
But you've given me nothing
Not even tragedy
Could open my sleeping eyes
The sight of empty space
The fear you'll never return
You'll never return
My greatest fear has come true
Forced to breathe without you
This waking nightmare is realized
Breathing without you
The final chapter, a revelation
I will breathe without you
Awaken
When sleep comes, forget it all
Sleep should be like death
Eyes wide open, I've awoken
I will breathe
