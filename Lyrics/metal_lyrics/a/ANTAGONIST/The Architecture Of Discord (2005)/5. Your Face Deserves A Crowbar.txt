You crossed your fingers when you said forever 
I should have pulled the trigger 
You look much better smashed into the ground 
I hope I'm not a fortune teller 
DEATH IS SERENITY 
Open your eyes for one last sunset 
I'll never have an explanation for your utterly pathetic attempt at love 
Forgive me...
