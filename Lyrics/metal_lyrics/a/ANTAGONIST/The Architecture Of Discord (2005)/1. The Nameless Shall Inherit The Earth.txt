A day of mourning, a small piece of us died (don't hold your breath, we'll rise above). Like the insects you believe us to be, we'll swarm your every move. Push for a change, our path towards unity...Push for a change, louder as the fight lasts longer. Why would I want my leader to be one of us when we're just as clueless as he? The people divided, we must be united. The people divided, we must unite. Oh, the lies, the pain, look into my eyes
