Yes he's selfish
Sold for the crime
Making ways for humankind
And the pain goes
Where he wants to
Making ways for nervous system

Loving love for what she can give but not for her
She says take me where I can shine
Take me anywhere

Burn with me and feel the flames
I'll rise again and penetrate your womb
Burn with me and feel the flames
I'll rise again and penetrate your womb

Now he's standing
Looks for comfort
From walls around him like an animal

Loving love for what she can give but not for her
She says take me where I can shine
Take me anywhere

Burn with me and feel the flames
I'll rise again and penetrate your womb
Burn with me and feel the flames
I'll rise again and penetrate your womb

Loving love for what she can give but not for her
She says take me where I can shine
Take me anywhere
Take me anywhere

Burn with me and feel the flames
I'll rise again and penetrate your womb
Burn with me and feel the flames
I'll rise again and penetrate your womb

And all this nonsense will never get me down
I'll rise again and penetrate your womb

So burn with me and feel the flames
I'll rise again and penetrate your womb
Yes, he's selfish
