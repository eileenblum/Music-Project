I put my mask on for another day again
And step out with a smile on my reaper's face
I keep on pretending that I don't ever bleed
I make myself strong with scars you'll never see

If I take my mask off and let you see me
I'll be weak and you'll be strong enough to leave

I know it won't be so bad
(our selfish set of needs)
Though the mask hurts even more
Even though it makes you so sad
(this selfish set of beings)
Though the mask hurts even more

So I keep this lie on even if you don't
'Cos what is hard on out is soft from the core
Yes it's better to hurt someone that you love
Than to crushed by someone you don't know

If I take my mask off and let you see me
I'll be weak and you'll be strong enough to leave

I know it won't be so bad
(our selfish set of needs)
Though the mask hurts even more
Even though it makes you so sad
(this selfish set of beings)
Though the mask hurts even more

[Solo]

I know it won't be so bad
(our selfish set of needs)
Though the mask hurts even more
Even though it makes you so sad
(this selfish set of beings)
Though the mask hurts even more

I know it won't be so bad
(our selfish set of needs)
Though the mask hurts even more
Even though it makes you so sad
(this selfish set of beings)
Though the mask hurts even more
