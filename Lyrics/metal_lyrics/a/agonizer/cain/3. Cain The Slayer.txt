First of all I never knew it would be so easy (So easy)
Second of all I always knew there's no forgiveness (There's no forgiveness)

After things I've done there's really no option for me
Now I realize my life is gonna change

For those deeds I was crucified and court
there where lies
Maybe devil looked at me and he laughed, ha ha
twisted my mind
But you where always in my way
and denied my life

And the seventh son will never rise upon
I'll never gain the place my brother's gone
Abel I'm praying for you please forgive my sin
I'll never gain the place my brother's gone

Now my master I've made the quest
thy will is glorified
I'm beyond of help

For second I am Cain the Slayer, brother-killer
Now I'm yours to find
And it's so cold in here,
and it's so dark in here

And the seventh son will never rise upon
I'll never gain the place my brother's gone
Abel I'm praying for you please forgive my sin
I'll never gain the place my brother's gone

[Solo]

And the seventh son will never rise upon
I'll never gain the place my brother's gone
Abel I'm praying for you please forgive my sin
I'll never gain the place my brother's gone

And the seventh son will never rise upon
I'll never gain the place my brother's gone
Abel I'm praying for you please forgive my sin
I'll never gain the place my brother's gone

And the seventh son (will never rise upon)
Abel I'm praying for you (please forgive my sin)

And the seventh son (will never rise upon)
Abel I'm praying for you please forgive my sin
Forgive my sin
