Making murder
Is another thing if you're sick as me
But I'm not sick as they can be
But I saw them
Making evil twisted things with the evidence
I swear they ate them

Oh but I did wrong that day
I could be wrong again today

You could have believed in me
Even if I'm crazy as can be
In the world fools
Wisdom is insanity

Please release me
Before they come and get me
Take me away and study me
I have to make these things
So they don't know me
They'll never catch me alive
