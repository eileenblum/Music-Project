Say love, feel the pain
Feel the wings on your heels taking you high
Say love, kill the pain
Kill the last thing you're ever able to feel
and I let you go, why I'll never know
Fool is the man that loosen the grip on you

Say love, feel the pain
The crack in your chest is risk that you take
Say love, see the pain
See the man to be sentenced to the grave
and I let you go, why I'll never know
Fool is the man that loosen the grip on you

Just like water, water
Flowing through my fingers
Everything seems to be in vain for me

Say love, bring the hope
To these pieces of broken heart of mine
Say love, bring it on
use the hammer to kill the last piece of me
and I let you go, why I'll never know
bitch is the word that I'll use when I talk about you.
