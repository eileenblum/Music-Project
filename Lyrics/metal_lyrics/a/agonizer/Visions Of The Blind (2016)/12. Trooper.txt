Dragging myself through this Koljo-river's killing paradise
Now this bullet wound is in me like a parasite
It's the pain that I feel inside

All alone
I pull it by my side

Now that all is ending, blown away
Still I cannot feel
Now I fear I'm losing all my faith
Burned by your grace

Now my vision's turning colors gray and makes me wanna cry
This last breath makes me fade away and see my life
All the way as I raise my head again

All alone
I'll die beneath these waves

Now that all is ending, blown away
Still I cannot feel
Now I fear I'm losing all my faith
Burned by your grace

To the dead
I'll raise my ale again
I realize I have joined my brothers in the end

Now that all is ending, blown away
Still I cannot feel
Now I fear I'm losing all my faith
Burned by this grace

Now that all is ending, blown away
Still I cannot feel
Now I fear I'm losing all my faith
Burned by this grace
