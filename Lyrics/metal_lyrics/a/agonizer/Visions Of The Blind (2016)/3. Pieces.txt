Pick up the pieces of your like
('Cause it's the only one you got)
And how you reap the ones you lied
(Reap the ones you lied)
Your greed will never let you out
('Cause it's the cage that you make)
While the world will pass you by
World will pass you by...

World will pass you by?

Pieces slipping through your fingers
All the while you're on your knees
Try to be the one that everyone want you to be

Don't save me now
Let me fail and fall before
Don't save me now
Let me make it my own

Lift me up when I can't fly
(I have found my kryptonite)
Still I have to take this fight
(I'm the only one I've got)
Foundation has to be on rock
(Find the strength within yourself)
Don't wait until you die
Wait until you die

Wait until you die...

Pieces slipping through your fingers
All the while you're on your knees
Try to be the one that everyone want you to be

Don't save me now
Let me fail and fall before
Don't save me now
Let me make it my own

Don't save me now
Let me fail and fall before
Don't save me now
Let me make it my own

Don't save me now
Let me fail and fall before
Don't save me now
Let me make it my own
