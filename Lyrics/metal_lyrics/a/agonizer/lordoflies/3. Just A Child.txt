"Once you close the door
You know there's no return
You have left your life forever
For thirteen years you've grown
Just to see the end
Shame is just too strong to hold

Don't you know the pain won't fade in rain
Don't you turn your head away

Suck in the red blood
Between your own teeth
Just to stay alive
There is no remorse
Nothing to forgive
Just the will to survive

Now you walk on streets
Walking as a prostitute
And nothing seems to change
You have used the needle
You have killed your heart
But the past is still the same

Don't you know the pain won't fade in rain
Don't you turn your head away

Suck in the red blood
Between your own teeth
Just to stay alive
There is no remorse
Nothing to forgive
Just the will to survive

Still the beating goes on
Still you are molested
Still there's someone else
Who makes the rules
Plays the game

[Solo]

Suck in the red blood
Between your own teeth
Just to stay alive
There is no remorse
Nothing to forgive
Just the will to survive

Suck in the red blood
Between your own teeth
Just to stay alive
There is no remorse
Nothing to forgive
There is just a child"
