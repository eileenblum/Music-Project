"Every night when you close your eyes
Silent whispers fill your empty mind
Can you sense that he is somewhere near?
Soon there will be no fear...

Everytime when the light begins to die
You will find another reason to cry
He can take all the pain away
But remember you will have to repay

If you close your eyes
This is your last night
But only if you sleep
Don't you try to run
The harvest has begun
And live all the way to the End...

Can you feel the fear in your heart?
Can you see his eyes in the dark?
The taste of death is so bitter and so sweet
But the Dream Reaper is all that you need!

If you close your eyes
This is your last night
But only if you sleep
Don't you try to run
The harvest has begun
And live all the way to the End...

[Solo]

If you close your eyes
This is your last night
But only if you sleep
Don't you try to run
The harvest has begun
And live all the way to the End...

And live all the way,
And live all the way to the End...
And live all the way,
And live all the way to the End..."
