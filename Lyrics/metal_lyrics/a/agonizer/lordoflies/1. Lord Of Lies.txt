"As the preacher steps on the shore
Visions of his mind still paint the paradise
Children play with ignorance gained from the god
But the saint has come to take it all away

So from the paradise she falls to the world
SheÂ´s no longer a princess, sheÂ´s just another whore

And now you lay your hands
To bless the children free
To justify the lord of lies
You're just too blind to see
The evil that you seed
At the name of lord of lies

So nothing goes before your everlasting life
Consequenses that you bring doesn't really matter
Just as long no one takes your price
You have nothing to loose and all to gain

So from the paradise she falls to the world
She's no longer a princess, she's just another whore

And now you lay your hands
To bless the children free
To justify the lord of lies
You're just too blind to see
The evil that you seed
At the name lord of lies

[Solo]

And now you lay your hands
To bless the children free
To justify the lord of lies
You're just too blind to see
The evil that you seed
At the name lord of lies

Oh, and now you lay your hands
To bless the children free
To justify the lord of lies
You're just too blind to see
The evil that you seed
At the name lord of lies

Ooh, and now you lay your hands
To bless the children free
To justify the lord of lies
You're just too blind to see
The evil that you seed
At the name lord of lies"
