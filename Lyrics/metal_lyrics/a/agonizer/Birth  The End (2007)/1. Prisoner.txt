I'm a prisoner, prisoner
How I long to be free
How would I know, how this world should be
Outside my mind
I'm an angel, angel
Raised to be a saint
How would I know, how this world should be
Trapped inside these walls

I feel so alone, it's freezing my soul
Come with me to this freak show
I hate everything, it drowns my good will
Come with me and I'll lead you to hell

Can't you hear me
HOLDING ON
Pieces of my sanity
I CAN'T GO ON
I'm fading under
I'M INSANE MY THOUGHTS ARE FADING
MY SWEET SAVIOUR, PROVIDING ME
MY SAFE HAVEN, BRINGING ME DOWN

Am I evil, prisoner
If I'm set to be free
How would I know, how this world would be
If I've never seen anyone
