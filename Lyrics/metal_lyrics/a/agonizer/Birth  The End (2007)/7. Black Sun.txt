Stop that sound
I don't wanna hear it anymore
I should've been there for you
It's just me
I don't wanna see the world in your shoes
I don't wanna hear the call of insanity

BLAME IS MY NAME
After all these years nothing changed
I can't believe the could be more
I HAVE THE STRENGTH
For just one more day to go
Then the black sun comes again

Leave me alone
Don't you call or even ask how I feel
I should've been there for you
(Should've been there for you)
Pain is a lie
That I spread around every day
I dive and let it take away

So you can't find me anymore
So I can leave you all
