That lonely man do you know him
He never stepped outside the door
They found out when he died

He used to live
He used to be the one they adored
I always wanted more

But all, all you are, is never, never ever enough
and all, all you are, is never, never ever enough

I DON'T WANNA BE ANOTHER ONE WHO LOSES
I DON'T WANNA BE LEFT ALONE WITH THE BROKEN HEART
I'M LUCKY THAT I'M GONE
EVERYONE OF US WILL HAVE TO DIE
EVERYONE OF US WILL HAVE TO GIVE AND FADE AWAY
WHY SHOULD I MOURN YOU

Look in the mirror, do you know him
He looks you in the eyes and tells you
I'm lucky I'm not you

You're not the star yet
You're just another wannabe
Waiting for defeat
