Child is born
Making pearls with his smile
When he's grown
All the pearls have been long gone

With you
I can find the pearls again
With you
I'm not different from anyone

Soon they will see
I'm not smart like everyone
For as long as I live
Take the blame for things that I haven't done

Hunting
With the anger of the mob
Hunt me
Like an animal I am

WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE ME DYING?
INDIFFERENT IS YOUR HATE FOR ME
WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE ME DYING?
'COS I'M TO BLAME FOR THE MISTAKES YOU MAKE
