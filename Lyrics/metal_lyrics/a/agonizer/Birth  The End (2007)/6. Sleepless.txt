Sleepless nights
Hours longer than the day
Morning never comes
Can't close my eyes
To fall asleep again

Hours die
Slower than the night
Sleep would be the blessing
And the only friend of mine

'Cos the world may change
While I am away
I just might wake up in the world
Where everything I had is gone

Nightmares come
Twisting my mind
Blind eyes try to see
It's so dark and I'm all alone

Something moves
I'm dying of fear
And you are there
And the world is still the same

'Cos the world may change
While I am away
I just might wake up in the world
Where everything I had is torn

TORN IN TO LITTLE PIECES
RIPPED ALONG THE PATH I WALK IN
AND WHEN I'M THERE
NOTHING MAKES THE DIFFERENCE ANYWAY
