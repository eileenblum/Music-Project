Yes I tortured my love
And faked my believes
At the time I knew I was wrong
Now everything's too late
I've made my own faith
With my other foot in the grave

I have the evidence that the blind can see
I have the knowledge that the deaf can hear
Nothing comes close to the pain I feel
I can't erase the life I failed to live

WE'RE BORN TO DIE
WHAT WE DO IN THE MIDDLE IS THE WASTE OF TIME
IT'S CRUEL I KNOW, BUT THE TRUTH IS NEVER BEAUTIFUL
IT HIDES BENEATH THE LIES

Yes I changed my believes
To the way that they did
At the time shame made me cry
I've lost self-esteem
If it ever was me
That I saved from falling in grave

Don't be so cruel
Hope doesn't know me anymore
Even my own grave
Is where I dig in the hollow ground

How am I supposed to live again?
When I can't even avoid to go in hell

I have the evidence that the blind can see
I have the knowledge that the deaf can hear
Now that the end is near I've made the sins
To send my sorry arse straight to the hell
