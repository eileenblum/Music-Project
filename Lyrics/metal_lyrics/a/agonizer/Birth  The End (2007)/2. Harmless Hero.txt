Yes I've heard, what you've been talking
it ain't the truth, you can't see inside of me
picture something, that come from somewhere dark
was left behind dead and rotten inside of me

I can see myself the harmless hero
It hide somewhere deep inside of me

When it happened
WHAT THE HELL CAME OF ME
I did everything
RIGHT WAY NO ONE NEVER TOLD ME
Why I am
NOT WORTH OF ANYTHING

Yes I hate just about everything
Hate me back if that's the way you wanna feel
(way you wanna feel)
I don't care, I'm suicidal anyway
So leave me here and let me bleed alone

I can see myself the harmless hero
It hide somewhere deep inside of me

When it happened
WHAT THE HELL CAME OF ME
I did everything
RIGHT WAY NO ONE NEVER TOLD ME
Why I am
NOT WORTH OF ANYTHING
