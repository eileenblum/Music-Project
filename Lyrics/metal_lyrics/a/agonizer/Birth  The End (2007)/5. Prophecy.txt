I heard the prophecy
Impossible to break
I told you it's not true
You said many would doubt the truth

I failed to see you way
I can't believe it's true
You can't be talking with god
You said many

Would you believe in me
and fail to see

I can't believe you
I must be going insane
I can't forget those words
You must be screwing me

IF I FOLLOW YOU
From now on
I WILL BE REBORN
I will be reborn
AND THE PROPHECY
DENIES THE TRUTH
AND ME AND YOU

You put the words in my mouth
You told what I should think
Where is the famous free will?
Where are the decisions that I made?

What should I make of this?
Should I hate your god?
You can't be talking with god
You said many
