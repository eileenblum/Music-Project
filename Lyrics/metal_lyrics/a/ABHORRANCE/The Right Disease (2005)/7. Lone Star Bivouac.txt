One passion traded for another
The greenest eyes left behind
Energy spread to the masses
Her glass figure permeates my mind

Counting mile markers
And sets of eighteen wheels
The phrase I love you
Carved in crimson bone

A tear falls from a stern eye
Like blood from a crystal sky
Absence manifests physical pain
Like hearts exploding for the first time

The North Star neglects to lead me
Home from this Texas hell
Your pictures are my only skin
And I die with each goodnight

The sad sound of your voice
The sweetest thing I ever heard
These epic treks define my life
Singing voices as guiding light

[Solo: Brandon]
