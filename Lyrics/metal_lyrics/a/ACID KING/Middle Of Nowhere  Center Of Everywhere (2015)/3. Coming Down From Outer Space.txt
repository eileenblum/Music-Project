Look into the stars
Find every moment, moment on mars
Fly above the earth
Find every moment under the nine
Hey you found your way
You're coming down from outer space
Hey you found your way
You're coming down from outer space

Ride the dark lit skies
Find every moment as you fall to the light
Rise above the world
Find every moment you've left behind
Hey you found your way
You're coming down from outer space
Hey you found your way
You're coming down from outer space

Look into the stars
Find every moment, moment on mars
Fly above the earth
Find every moment under the nine
Hey you found your way
You're coming down from outer space
Hey you found your way
You're coming down from outer space
