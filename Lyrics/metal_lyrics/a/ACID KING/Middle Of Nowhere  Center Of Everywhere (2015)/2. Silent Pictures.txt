Silent pictures
Come to life
Coming at me as I follow the lines
Thru my veins, to my eyes
Coming at me while the lines meet the sky

Thru the walls
Hear the cries
Coming at me as I follow the lines
Thru my veins, to my eyes
Coming at me while the lines meet the sky

Silent pictures
Ray of light
Fills the room with fear and desire
Thru my veins, to my eyes
Coming at me while the lines meet the sky
