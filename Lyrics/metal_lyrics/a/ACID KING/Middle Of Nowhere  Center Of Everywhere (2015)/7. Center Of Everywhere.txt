Standing here
Looking out

Far away from
From the clouds

All alone 
In the crowd

They may say nothing to be found
In the center of everywhere

Cleanse the earth
From your eyes

Miles away
Open wide

They may say nothing to be found
In the center of everywhere

Raise the world
From your sight

Miles away
Open wide

They may say nothing to be found
In the center of everywhere
