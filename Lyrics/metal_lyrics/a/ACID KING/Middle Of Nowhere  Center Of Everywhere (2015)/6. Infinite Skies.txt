Permission to ride
Out of the world
Thru the infinite skies
Bursts of yellow

Bursting with light
To the end of time
Spirits arise
Pray for the blast off

Nothing so high
Can keep us from reach
Thru the infinite skies
Burst of yellow

Bursting with light
To the end of time
Spirits arise
Pray for the blast off

Feel the heat rise
As we enter the burn
Thru the infinite skies
Burst of yellow

Bursting with light
To the end of time
Spirits arise
Pray for the blast off
