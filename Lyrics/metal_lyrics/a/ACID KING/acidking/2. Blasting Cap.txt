Tell me the things that i want to hear
bring me from the things that i fear
open the mask tank and light the match
see the flames rise and let the fun last

great times to blacken it hawk my clear
clouds go away for you're nowhere near
skidding your knee, its only a scratch
look away and turn your head past
