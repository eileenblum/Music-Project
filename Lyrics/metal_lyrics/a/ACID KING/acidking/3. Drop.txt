Traveling through time
My hearts like a pilot
roads lie tough ahead
but the worst is behind

It's of a different sort
mind and twisted hands
Always asking why
Making up my own answers

Its getting heavy now
I'm reaching critical mass
It's reaching up my spine
Blowing my mind!!! Yea!
