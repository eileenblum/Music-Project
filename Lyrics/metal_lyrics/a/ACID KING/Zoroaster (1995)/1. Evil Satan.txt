I know evil
I know nice
I've got both in my head twice
There is no reason that both have to suffer

Bow down evil satan 
You're always right

The ..... happen to you
No explanation
They just do
Tell all the people to deal with the answer
Tear down the wall
The voice tells to

Sit down and watch your life go by
Shoot off a cannon to the sky
There is no reason that both have to suffer

Bow down evil satan
You're always right

Evil!
Evil!
Evil!
Evil!

Evil!
Evil!
Evil!
Evil!
