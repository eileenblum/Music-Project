Ride away from falling ground
Ride away from the big black cloud
Ride away until the day comes
That we all live in a 2 wheel nation

Ride away from noise and sound
Ride away from the life that's now
Ride away until the day comes
That we all live in a 2 wheel nation

Ride away from falling ground
Ride away from the big black cloud
Ride away until the day comes
That we all live in a 2 wheel nation
