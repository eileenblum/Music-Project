Free, free the people
War, war of the mind
Hail, hail you come down
You find every reason
Kneel now to your place
You find any reason

Free, free the people
War, war of the mind
Break down to your knees
You find every reason
Know your place in life
You find any reason

Free, free the people
War, war of the mind
Come by, find your peace
You find every reason
Kneel now to your place
You find any reason
