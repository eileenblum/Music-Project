[performed by Acid King]Come on down from the mountains, come on down to the crowd.
See the millions of people laughing, knowing that they're all wrong.
Run away from nowhere, run away from strong. 
Knowin' you're gonna rise above, and they will all be gone.

Free to live, to rise, to die.
Free to live, to rise, to die.

Had I known that the master, the master told you how to live.
So love makes it seem alright, and you can now forgive.

Free to live, to rise, to die.
Free to live, to rise, to die.

Come on down from the mountains, come on down to the crowd.
See the millions of people laughing, knowing that they're all wrong.
Run away from nowhere, run away from strong. 
Knowin' you're gonna rise above, and they will all be gone.

Free to live, to rise, to die.
Free to live, to rise, to die.
