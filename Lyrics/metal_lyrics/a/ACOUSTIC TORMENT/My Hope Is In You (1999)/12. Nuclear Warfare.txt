A vision in the sky
Casting a shade on mother earth
They know what it will bring
But no belief - denying the truth
Fleeing creatures everywhere
Each possessed by tremendous fear
Crying like tormented souls
Wishing that they were never born
A thud impact
A raising mushroom cloud
High pressure is filling the air
A flash of fire is dragging life away

Nuclear warfare
Nuclear warfare

Sitting here in the cold
Watching the drizzling snow
Benumbed perceiving the fallout
Looking at the wasteland
You cannot see it
You cannot feel it
You cannot touch it
But it could let you die
You watch yourself and scare
The hair is gone
The skin is black
The radiation is a torment
A torture

Nuclear warfare
Nuclear warfare
