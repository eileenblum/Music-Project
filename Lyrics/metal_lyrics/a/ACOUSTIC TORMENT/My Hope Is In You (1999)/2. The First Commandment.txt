i am the lord, i am your god.
i am the lord, the almighty god.
i am the way, i am the truth,
i am the life, i am ...

jesus christ

i am the son, i am the father.
i am your god and there is no other.
i am the son, i am the father.
i am your god and there is no other.
salvation is found in no one else,
for their is no other name
by which you must be saved.
i am the way, the truth and the life;
no one comes to the father except through me.

watch out for false prophets
coming to you in sheep's clothing
but inwardly they are ferocious wolves
teaching things they ought not to teach.

i am the lord, i am your god.
i am the Lord, the only god.
i am the truth, i am the life
i am the way, the only way.

you shall have no other gods before me.

i am the son, i am the father.
i am your god and there is no other.
i am the son, i am the father.
i am your god and there is no other.
salvation is found in no one else,
for their is no other name
by which you must be saves.
i am the way, the truth and the life;
no one comes to the father except through me.

see to it that no one takes you captive
through hollow and deceptive philosophy,
which depends on human tradition
and the basic principles of this world
rather than on christ.

i am the way - follow me.
i am the truth - trust me.
i am the life - love me.
i am the one and only god.
