every day there are dying out 
some species of animals and plants. 
stop the environmental disaster, 
only now we have a chance.

threatened creatures, dirty seas, 
polluted atmosphere, dying trees.

Every day we are destroying 
a part of this beautiful nature.
stop the ecocide now, 
or we will have no future.

we invest millions of dollars 
in science and mars exploration, 
that we can leave this planet 
when it is finally destroyed. 
use the money for saving the environment, 
this would be thousand times more efficient!

threatened creatures, dirty seas, 
polluted atmosphere, dying trees.

stop the insanity! - stop the ecocide! 
stop the indifference! - stop the suicide!
