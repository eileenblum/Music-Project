Then I saw a great white throne
And Him who was seated on it
Earth and sky fled from His presence
And there was no place for them
And I saw the dead 
Great and small
Standing before the throne
And books where opened

Another book was opened
Which is the book of life
Concerning those who feared the LORD
And honoured His name

The dead were judged
According to what they had done
As recorded in the books

The sea gave up the dead
And death and Hades gave up the dead
And each person was judged 
According to what he had done
Then death and Hades were thrown
Into the lake of fire
Which is the second death

If anyone's name was not found
In the book of life
He was thrown into the lake of fire

Judgement day is coming 
Are you ready for being judged?
Judgement day is coming
Will your name be found 
In the book of life?

[Revelation 20,11-15]
[Malachi 3,16]
