The way you walk is broad and plain
From numerous fellows you let yourself float
But with every step you approach eternal pain
Cause hell waits at the end of the road

You despise the orders of the LORD
You want to enjoy your life
And ignore His Holy Word

Turn from your evil ways
Stay righteous in all pain and hate
Leave the road that leads to hell
And enter through the narrow gate

Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial
Because when he has stood the test
He will receive the crown of life
That GOD has promised to those who love Him

Turn from your evil ways
Stay righteous in all pain and hate
Leave the road that leads to hell
And enter through the narrow gate

Wide is the gate and broad is the road
That leads to destruction
And many enter through it
But small is the gate and narrow the road
That leads to life 
And only a few find it

Leave the road that leads to hell
And enter through the narrow gate
JESUS wants to be your saviour
Do not let Him wait

Do not let Him wait

[Zechariah 1,4]
[Matthew 7,13-14]
[James 1,12]
