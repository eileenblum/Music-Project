show me your ways, teach me your paths
guide me in your truth.
don't remember my rebellious ways
and the sins of my youth.

for the sake of your name, o lord,
forgive my iniquity, though it is great.
look upon my affliction and my distress
and tade all my sins away.

to you, o lord, i lift up my soul,
don't let me be put to shame.
my hope is in you all day long,
don't let me alone with my blame.

turn to me and be gracious to me,
for i am afflictes and lonely.
turn to me and be graciout to me,
guard my life and rescue me.

good and upright is the lord;
therefore he instructs sinners in his ways,
which are loving and faithful
for those who keep the demands of his covenant.
my eyes are ever on the lord,
for only he will release my feet from the snare.

show me your ways, teach me your paths
guide me in your truth.
don't remember my rebellious ways
and the sins of my youth.

to you, o lord, i lift up my soul,
don't let me be put to shame.
my hope is in you all day long,
don't let me alone with my blame.

for the sake of your name, o lord,
forgive my iniquity, though it is great.
look upon my affliction and my distress
and tade all my sins away.

turn to me and be gracious to me,
for i am afflictes and lonely.
turn to me and be graciout to me,
guard my life and rescue me.

praise be to the lord,
for he has heard my cry for mercy.
the lord is my strength and my shield;
my heart trusts in him and i am helped.
the lord is the strength of his people,
a fortress of salvation for his anointed one.
save your people and bless your inheritance;
be their shepherd and carry them forever.

guard my life and rescue me
because my hope is in you.
