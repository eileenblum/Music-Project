child abusing. the sick man. his thoughts.
the criminal perverted act. rapes and kills.
no one heard the cry. no one saw the tears.
no one, no one heard ...

the scream, the scream, the scream
the scream in a sick world.
full of violence, full of perversion.
satan goes around
searching for inhuman machines.

everyone is searching for answeres.
answeres from this world
but satan's influence has come
to manipulate the minds,
and no one asks for jesus christ.
that's the problem, that's the truth,
this will be our death.

break down marriges. divorce. lost children
without support, without love, hatred growes.
no one hears the cry. no one sees the tears.
no one hears ...

the scream, the scream, the scream.
the scream in a sick world
full of hate, full of infidelity.
satan goes around
searching for inhuman machines.
