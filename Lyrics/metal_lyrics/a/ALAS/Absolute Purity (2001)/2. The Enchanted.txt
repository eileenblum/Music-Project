It is, I who shall, reclaim prosperity
It is, Thou who must, contemplate vitality
It is, only Thee, who now can redeem Thyself
For it, is he, who hath forsaken destiny

Enchanted, as a promising dream
Enchanted, by the will to achieve my dreams
Enchanted, by the kindling of fate
Enchanted, by the konwledge of fate

It is, I who shall, reclaim my dignity
It is, Thou who must, obtain pure divinity
It is, only Thee, who now can redeem Thyself
For it, is he, who hath forsaken destiny

Enchanted, as a promising dream
Enchanted, by the will to achieve my dreams
Enchanted, by the kindling of fate
Enchanted, by the konwledge of fate
