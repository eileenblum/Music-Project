As I sit here, ann ponder on my life
I look upon my scars that never heal
I keep climbing, the mountain ever so steep
Alwayls wondering what I'll obtain by...

Endlessly searching
for sanctity
for humillity
for faith
I live to fulfill my destiny
endlessly searching
for my fate

Now I consider, all choices of my life
I try to change my shortcomings at hand
I must sustain my, integrity inside
I will continue to strive towards goals by...

Endlessly searching
for sanctity
for humillity
for faith
I live to fulfill my destiny
endlessly searching
for my fate
