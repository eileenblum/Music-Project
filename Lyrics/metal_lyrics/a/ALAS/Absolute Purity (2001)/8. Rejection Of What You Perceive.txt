Why, how can this be, such ignorance and stupidity
I defile, such denial, and rejection of my dejection
You pitiful pions, I shall not reconcile

I denounce your beliefs
I shall not be deceived
Your offerings I shan't receive
Rejection of what you preceive

Why, how dare this be, realize your own, insecurities
My pain, won't be your gain
your false intentions, they have been revealed

I denounce your beliefs
I shall not be deceived
Your offerings I shan't receive
Rejection of what you preceive

i won't cry, I won't lie, i won't cater to your pity
I will shield, the wounds unhealed, your empathy is
not real
Like vultures you fedd, on my implanted seed
Your false pretentions I don't need
I won't give, I will live, your idiocy I shall not
forgive
