Will this pain ever subside, will this grief ever disappear
Can I ever survive, with this loss of a soul
Will this misery ever fade, can I obtain life without pain
Can I ever evade, this tragic loss that died in vain

Loss of a life so dear to me
I bleed with every breath
Loss of a life so clearly, defines the truth of life and death
Loss of a life so painful
I bleed with every moment
Loss of a life so tearful, designs my void of emptiness

Will this death ever pass me by, or effect me eternally
Can I ever escape this force of instability
Will this severance ever falter, or fall from the hands of fate
Can I ever eliminate, remnants of his dying state

Loss of a life so dear to me
I bleed with every breath
Loss of a life so clearly, defines the truth of life and death
Loss of a life so painful
I bleed with every moment
Loss of a life so tearful, designs my void of emptiness

Please forgive me for not being there
I would die to show you, how much I care
Your presence, so very missed, I shall never forget
The bond that we shared, I will never forget

Loss of a life so dear to me
You're now free of misery
Loss of a life so clearly, defines the pain inside of me
Loss of a life so painful
I will always grieve the time we shared
Loss of a life so tearful, in honor I cry to show you I care
