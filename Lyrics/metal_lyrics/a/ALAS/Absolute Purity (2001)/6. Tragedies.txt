I have seen, such angst, and pain ever so deep
I have heard, such cries, that linger on and on
I have had, to witness, fear froma travesty
I need, to express, this unbearable mass of pain

Tragedies
they anger me
they engulf me to no end
I long for the end of this misery
That always breeds within

Must all, this loss, take over my being
Why can't, I free, myself from all this grief
I need, to find my, answer to all this pain
I need, to find my, escape from these winding roads
of...

Tragedies
they anger me
they engulf me to no end
I long for the end of this misery
That always breeds within
Tragedies
they sadden me
They enrage me to no end
I long for the end of this misery
I long for the end!!!
