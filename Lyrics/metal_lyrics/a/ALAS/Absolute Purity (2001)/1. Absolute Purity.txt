Come enter my, realm of emotion
The deepest depths of my solidity
Come swim in my, rumbling ocean
This enormous mass of infinity

Why can't I fade, this pain away
Why can't I fell, strength within myself
How must I live to void away my discontent
What must I give, I shall consent

Absolute Purity
Grant me the clarity, to reign in this reality
Absolute Purity
I am what I'll always be, conquering the enemies

Weep so for my, grief overwhelms me
grievence that lasts an eternity
Weep as you shall, see what i see
the anguish of eternal sea

Why can't I make, my grief escape
Why can't I take, all of my dignity
How must I live to gain back all my stregnth and wit
What must I give I shall grant it

Absolute Purity
Grant me the clarity, to reign in this reality
Absolute Purity
I am what I'll always be, conquering the enemies
