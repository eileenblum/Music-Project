Defeating opression, is my obsession
Deleting the tyranny, erasing the fear in me
Destined to receive, what I conceive
Dishonor the majority, by my authority

I see through the haze
devoid of your daze
your insolent ways
Surmounting the mases
I reject what you cherish
Your fate you shall perish
I rejoice in your pain

Feel all this misery, as you begin to see
pure coal to succeed, which I shall not heed
clear path to victory, defeating the tyranny
erasing the very need, to associate with your breed

I see through the haze
devoid of your daze
your insolent ways
Surmounting the mases
I reject what you cherish
Your fate you shall perish
I rejoice in your pain

Surmounting the masses
The masses

how does it feel to be maimed
by the pain of eroding soul
drown in all your glory!
Drown in all your lies!
