Ease this grieving, so misleading, take away this
flowing stream
Endless mournig, solemn lorning, encompassing my
torrid dreams
Painful weeping, poison seeping, drowning in the
rolling stream

The winds of season turning
Diluted blood churning
The withered soul now yearning
Silencing the Sorrow

The lakes of anguish breeding
Layers of grief now seeding
My destinys now leading me
Silencing the Sorrow

Horrid seething, faintly breathing, must escape this
fleshly pain
Life so dreary, becoming so weary, can't evade the
endless shame
Complicating, now partaking, in the stream which has
no gain

The winds of season turning
Diluted blood churning
The withered soul now yearning
Silencing the Sorrow

The lakes of anguish breeding
Layers of grief now seeding
My destinys now leading me
Silencing the Sorrow

The agony of the force of stream, endlessly flooding I
must heed
The surging waters begin devouring me, I must delete
the pain that i see
I cleanse away all impurities, my pure vision shall
now proceed
I now succed throught the diying breed, silencing the
sorrow and grant my deep
