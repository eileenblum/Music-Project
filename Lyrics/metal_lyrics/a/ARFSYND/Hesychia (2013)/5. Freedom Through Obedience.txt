Caught by the earthly temptations and haunted by the
original sin. Life pulsates through the emptiness, the
emptiness created by God. No matter how I turn to Thee
I see only darkness and guilt Lord, give me a sign
I was born to serve Thee blindly!

By instinct we sin inexorably
And the gap between us is growing
By will we search Hesychia
The freedom earned through obedience

The Elder has spoken:
Thou shall find thyself beyond the material
Search for the spark. Only through prayer can
the Lord meet you. And only through self-sacrifice
thou may receive mercy and live for real

Beyond humansâ doubt the Truth must be reached
We're bound to our senses, but dream of
predetermined freedom. Within each pitiful sinner
glows a shimmering light. If thou, for once, want to live
unite thyself with the Flame - God!
