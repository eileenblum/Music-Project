We, who are stumbling blindly, need a sign from Thee
We have met the light, yet it only betrays us
again and again...
Exalted, we kissed the cross, and faithfully
we sang Thy Psalms.Yet we lack meaning
- God's starving children

In silence we pray for reprieve, yet the Sin
punishes us mercilessly
For he rightfully chooses his prey
and the victim is always due

The temptation burdens our freedom the burden
of human corruption. The hunger dulls the Sin
yet the Sin numbs the urge
again and again...
Hordes of famished ascetics, kneeling in vivid ecstasy
His deceitful calls gave us life
- God's starving offspring

Emaciated corpses shall spawn martyrdom
Where leprosy sprouts, fed by frustration
Let the Savior walk on the ground we plow
Where itâs constantly lush, the Era of Perdition
is starting to blossom
