Far away Far away from their ignorance
Looking beyond all their believes
No regulations took as faith
Showing the way for living free

Why do you need to live under rules?
We are such free spirits
Open your eyes once for all toâ¦

A distinct sight, superior minds, wisdom of Light
We are the chosen ones to deny , to stand up and fight
the fear thatâs in our souls

Feel the Force!  the natural power
The orderâs given by itself
Weâre not sons of God!
Weâre sons of Force!

Itâs enough of mediocrity
Realize all that you can do

Owner of all your acts
Be your own Lord
Open your eyes once for all toâ¦

A distinct sight, superior minds, wisdom of Light
We are the chosen ones to deny , to stand up and fight
the fear thatâs in our souls

Feel the Force!  the natural power
The Order is given by itself
Weâre not sons of God!
Weâre sons of Force!

[Solo: Galiano]

Someday our power, the power of Force,
will rule everything
and you will realize we all are God,
and donât need any kind of government
Then, and only thenâ¦

Weâll live in order,
a natural one;
essence of our might,
which makes us to fight against the ones
who donât realize our own divinity

A distinct sight, superior minds, wisdom of Light
We are the chosen ones to deny , to stand up and fight
the fear thatâs in our souls

Feel the Force!  the natural power
The Orderâs given by ourselves
We are not sons of God!
We are sons of Force!
