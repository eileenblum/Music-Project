Cruel evil in Heaven I feel
I am arriving now, and all I see here is death
Blood, my brothers, taste
In Luciferâs hands is our reign

Is he responsible? That bastardâs senseless revenge
Oh my Lord is gone
My life is now useless again
Useless againâ¦

The wounds in my soul will never heal
I am so weak, canât fight, my wings can no longer breathe
Dark ones force me down
And face the black wizard again
Prisonerâ¦

Lord, embrace my soul
Evil wonât succeed
I am yours forever

The lands where our hopes once had lived
Lie buried beneath our remains
Another race shakes in horror

The Dark One will end with their breed
Deception the humans foresee
They wonât let their brothers give up
...Carry on...

Lord, embrace my soul
Evil wonât succeed
I am yours forever

...Forgive me please my Lord...
