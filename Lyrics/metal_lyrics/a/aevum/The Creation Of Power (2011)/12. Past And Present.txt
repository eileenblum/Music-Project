â...The Divine War had ended, but only the first chapter of our history had been written. The Human being would continue his journey through life and their societies would evolve day by day, populating the whole world, living by themselves and for themselves.

God and his angels would always be part of the humankind, but only in spirit, and it would always represent purity, fidelity and divinity to them, preserved by a collective resonance in the human consciousness.â

The facts prevail beyond time...
...And the cycle continues today
