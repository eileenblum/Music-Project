Underneath his supervision
With the human wizardâs help
The white army starts to shape
Their revenge

But this treason would be unveiled
Lucifer would become aware

Finding out about Andreasâ mistake
A trap the Dark One would set
Now the Queen of humans kept
Prisoner

No one will ever comprehend
The weight of these tears of regret

Until the end of times my fatherâs will iâll keep
And be the Humanâs saviour
And humankind will finally be free to stand
Under no oneâs shadow
Together as one until the end

The white menace marches triumphant
With our blades in hand, and hopes in mind
The unknown awaits but there is no one who can break
Our blades in hand and hopes in mind

Until the end of times my fatherâs will iâll keep
And be the Humanâs saviour
And humankind will finally be free to stand
Under no oneâs shadow
Together as one until the end

Go and seek our future
Under no oneâs shadow
Divine War has started

Maaaaaaaaarchâ¦!
