From ashes and Dust confusion and Treason
A new breath of Life emerges from Evil
No fear in our minds, no more blood in our hands
Together as One, weâll rise our Kingdom

Harmony and tranquility
were spread through the wind
Warriors of peace

â¦ armors of metalâ¦
â¦ Brought our Freedom, Brothers rise againâ¦

[Chorus:]
Earth, sun and fire
Give us freedom
Eternal desire
â¦at the genesis
Precious empire
Thereâs no hero
who can destroy us
â¦at the genesis

Pride traveled through the clouds of Heaven
Seeking the light, their sons always wanted
Fear in our minds, suffering in our souls
destroying our lives, and capturing our freedom

Holy blood remind us they stole
our souls from corpse
Brothers of light

â¦ youâll feel the sorrowâ¦
â¦ running through your veins, you will feel the painâ¦

[Chorus]

â...the young kingdom of darkness would start to take form, silently becoming something no one couldâve ever expectedâ¦â
