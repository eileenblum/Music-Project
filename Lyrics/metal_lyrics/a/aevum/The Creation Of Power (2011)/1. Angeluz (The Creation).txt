Empty blue skies, the moon and the sun
Dimming clouds rise in the horizon
Only one breathing Spirit
His Dreamed creation coming true

New reign of Light, Order divine
Brothers of God at his right hand
Spirits from dust now arising

Angels of Light

Only one voice, white thoughts for all
Harmony and Perfection
The Eye resting on their shoulders
Walking down the Path of Truth

Live to flyâ¦.to fly high

[Chorus: ]
Behold the light above, creationâs glow
The new Empire is Born
Fly celestial Souls made from Stars

Behold the light above, creationâs glow
The new Empire is Born
Fly celestial Souls to the Sky

â...But there was a different one...â
