An unfullfilled Creator grieves, as he witness his kingdomâs decay
Angels were not the brothers that once made him proud
A new beggining in sight, a new race rises
A new chance to establish his thoughts
The humankind, born to redeeme his mistakes...once again

[Chorus:]
Vulnerable, mortal, but with incredibly passioned hearts
Humankind, holders of God's gift of creation and love

As consequence the dark one speaks,
he wonât let God enslave humankind
A call for revenge, to every dark angel, was heard
But opposition was found, towards the war
Because for the elders, their wisdom it defies
The Dark One must find, a new source of loyalty and help...once again

[Chorus:]
Vulnerable, mortal, but with incredibly passioned hearts
Humankind, holders of God's gift of creation and love

Towards Heaven they will march
Now that the alliance is found
They will fight, Humans and dark ones, allied
To cause Godâs empireâs demise
No one, not even the Eye
Will keep them from being united...and there they go...
