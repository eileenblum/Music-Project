Before the rising sun, before the clouds and stormsâ¦it lived.
Within the Human form, an ancient powerâ¦The secrets of Magic
They learned and forged, and this way they became the wisest beings of all
But telling right from wrong, their eternal weakness, would turn it against their own

Two human wizards with powerful might
Now defending the sides of both shadows and light

Fighting for Freedomâ¦

The white wizard was unaware of the betrayal Avathar prepared
And with the help of the three wise men he cast a spell and trapped him in a cell
And so the magic that once set him free was now the accomplice of his capture
But they did not know that the great Origryn could join the energy of Cosmos

One with the essence of Magic
He mastered space and time
Now freedom lights in his soul
He must warn our God the betrayal of all

I feel on my wings the presence of evil
Through Dark and Light Iâll fight no matter what
I donât fear any spell, I am one with God âs Power
Through Dark and Light Iâm Justice!

Darkness fills the skies, Heavenâs desperate criesâ¦I hearâ¦
Evil takes its course, faster I must go; I canât let down my God!

One with the essence of Magic
Now courage burns in his anxious soul
Invoke the spirits above
He must warn our God the betrayal of all

I feel on my wings the presence of evil
Through Dark and Light Iâll fight no matter what
I donât fear any spell, I am one with Godâs Power
Through Dark and Light Iâm Justice!

â...But the white wizard wasnât aware of Godâs fallen kingdom and the now emerged reign of darkness, commanded by Lucifer and his eternal rival Avathar...â
