Far away from their ignorance
Looking beyond all their believes
His regulations they took as faith
Knowing not what would be set free

The new reign of darkness will be their doom
If Humans donât act
Open your eyes once for all toâ¦

A distinct sight, our saviour is now our reason to cry
Now we are the chosen ones to deny , to stand up and fight
The selfishness and maul
Alliance! The born insurrection
To bring back our freedom again
We wonât be controlled
Weâll stand up tall

Itâs enough of mediocrity
The human race wonât be subdued
Weâre owners of all our acts
Be your own voice
Open your eyes once for all toâ¦

A distinct sight, our saviour is now our reason to cry
Now we are the chosen ones to deny , to stand up and fight
The selfishness and maul
Alliance! The born insurrection
To bring back our freedom again
We wonât be controlled
Weâll stand up tall

Today our power, our power and force,
will rule from within
and weâll realize we can go through,
and donât need this kind of government
Then, and only thenâ¦

Weâll live in order,
a natural one;
essence of our might,
which makes us defy the evil ones
who donât realize our own dignity

A distinct sight, our saviour is now our reason to cry
Now we are the chosen ones to deny , to stand up and fight
The selfishness and maul
Alliance! The born insurrection
To bring back our freedom again
We wonât be controlled
Weâll stand up tall
Weâll be our force

â...But the alliance would not be complete without the experience
and power of the white wizard, so they would have to rescue him
from the dungeons of PandÃ¦monium...â
