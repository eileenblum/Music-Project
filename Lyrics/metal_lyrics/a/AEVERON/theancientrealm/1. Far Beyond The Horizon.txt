Cascades of a glaring light
Are dancing in the flood of a river
That forces its way through stone and soil
To lose itself in the vastness of the ocean
The lustre of the waters shining blue
Is reflecting those shapes
Which clouds travelling by
Draw onto the surface

The evening light is colouring the sky deep red
And the day is facing its end
On the slope of the shore he is sitting
Staring at the eternal ocean
The things he is able to see
There in the spectacle of nature
Are almost lost in the vortex
Of the tides.
