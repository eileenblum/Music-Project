Bloodshot eyes, pulsating arteries, boiling blood
My sanity is on the verge of collapse
Since you've come here my world has turned upside down

Upside down!

I bid you welcome to my realm of animosity!
You can be as unforgiving as you want to be!
Join me on quest for my perennial nemesis!

I bid you welcome to my realm of animosity!
You can be as unforgiving as you want to be!
Join me on quest for my perennial nemesis!

Perennial nemesis!

You wrecked it all without even battling an eyelid
You kept me on a short leash so I had to watch you kill
I saw you violate, defile and slaughter
Now it's payback time you wretch!
The tables have turned!
Your black heart belongs to me!
Watch me as I slowly rip it out of your fucking chest!

All ye world observe my bestial vengeance on this bastard son
Bear witness to this act of liberation!

I've bidden you welcome to my dominion of hate!
Avenge yourself before it is too late!
Now I'll join you on the quest for your eternal nemesis!

I've bidden you welcome to my dominion of hate!
Avenge yourself before it is too late!
Now I'll join you on the quest for your eternal nemesis!
