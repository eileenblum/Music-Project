Many fucking disappointments I experienced in my worthless life
Only the dominion of loneliness is inhabiting me, like a curse
So many days without a smile, just distorted grimaces around me
Damned to drag myself on through a desert full of desparation

[2x]
Can somebody please tell me why this is happening to me?!
Please tell me my name! I did forget it forever
Alone and deprived of all my value in this world
Slowly I'm turning my head towards death's door
Â 
Suffering from many sores life has slashed into my heart
Beloved friends died for fucking nothing
Deep wounds I'm licking but they won't heal
Damned to scrape a living of sadness and senselessness

[2x]
Can somebody please tell me why this is happening to me?!
Please tell me my name! I did forget it forever
Alone and deprived of all my value in this world
Slowly I'm turning my head towards death's door
Â 
My soul is black without a candle illuminating the holes in it
Darkness fills my lamed extremities

My heart is bleeding from within, fucking blood!
I'm shedding bloody tears from my pale cold eyes
Â 
My heart is bleeding from within, fucking blood!
I'm shedding bloody tears from my pale cold eyes
Â 
Alone and deprived of all my value in this world
Slowly I'm turning my head towards death's door

Can somebody please tell me why this is happening to me?!
Please tell me my name! I did forget it forever

I wanted to taste the beauty of love and life
But these symbols are vanishing and rotting before me

I'm a failure and will approach the landscape of no hope.
No one has ever cared or even recognized my departure
Â 
I'm a failure and will approach the landscape of no hope
No one has ever cared or even recognized my departure
