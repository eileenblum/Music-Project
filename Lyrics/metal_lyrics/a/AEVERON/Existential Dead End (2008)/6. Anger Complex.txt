you have broken my very confidence.
now I'm cast out, depraved, a hallow shell.
You have raped my innocence and thus
turned my life into a living hell.

You have raped my innocence and thus
turned my life into a living hell.

You have infiltrated my mind,
polluted it with your shameless kind.
You have had me obey your rules
and made me fell like the weakest of fools.

Deep down inside I feel the urge to scream.
Revenge is boiling in my veins. 
Every fiber in my body is illuminated with a deadly gleam.
 I yearn for retaliation of the unbearable pains.

What shall I do with my anger? ANGER!!!
Where is your weak point?
Is there a way to hurt you usefully?
Is homicide the only possible solution?

You can't imagine how truly I despise your ways.
I think it's time ti turn the tables on you.
I will no longer crawl under the yoke of the olden days
but instead destroy all things you held so true.

you held so fucking true!!!

All these pain-ridden years I've been pondering,
torturing my mind to find a suitable punishment.
Still I don't know the answer, I'm wondering
if for you death would be the ultimate end.

Ultimate End!!

Sahall i kill you???!!!
