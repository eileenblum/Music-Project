"But see, amid the mimic rout
A crawling shape intrude!
A blood-red thing that writhes from out
The scenic solitude!
It writhes! â It writhes! â with mortal pangs
The mimes become its food,
And seraphs sob at vermin fangs
In human gore imbued.

Out â out are the lights â out all!
And, over each quivering form,
The curtain, a funeral pall,
Comes down with the rush of a storm,
While the angels all pallid and wan,
Uprising, unveiling, affirm
That the play is the tragedy "Man,"
And its hero the Conqueror Worm." *

Time and space run through my astral veins.
Stars obey my orders.
Planets circulate me in neverending concentric rings.
I am the center of the universe.
I am COSMOS!!!

You think you don't have to worship me.
But your vanity won't be of any use to you.
I'm flowing right through your most secret thoughts.
I know your deepest fears and weaknesses.
I am the owner of your mind and ruler of your fate.

I am the Divinity you've always denied.
I am the Alpha and the Omega.
I was here before time was created.
And Iâll still exist when you've vanished in the vortex
of eternity.

Eternity!!!

You stupid fuck believe you're in control and everything is obeying
your feeble will.
But you're subject to a fatal fallacy.
You're acting the way I want you to.
You're my character in a play of hopes and fears.
You're my Conqueror Worm!
You still believe I'm not there, laughing at my existence,
still denying me.
Youâre denying me!!!

Eternally!!!

Once upon a time I wasnât unlike you.
But I have arisen and made myself a God.
The highest sovereign over your life, liege over your fate.
I transformed into a celestial being to use you as an instrument
to wipe out the entire human RACE!!!
