A look in the dark - nothing - and yet everything, a shadow-world full of veiled silhouettes, 
the nightfall swallows my silent cry.
Within my heart there's a weak rearing
that rages on and on.
I can't resist my own reflections.

Confusion is reigning my mind.
My eyes are open - my mind's closed tight.
The skies will darken.
I raise my arms into the night.

I'm longing for cathartic rain
to wash away this anguish and pain.
The water will fall on me
out of clouds above my misery.

I'm flying cross sphere's through time and space
to drift in the magic of delusion.
Look at me! What do you see?
You're watching the void - only my body is here.
Try to speak but there are no words.

Confusion is reigning my mind.
My eyes are open - my mind' closed tight.
The skies will darken. 
I raise my arms into the night

Into the night!!!

Walked the way that was indicated.
Fortune often lies ahead.
But I felt to lose before
The fight had just
begun!!!

Had just begun!!!
