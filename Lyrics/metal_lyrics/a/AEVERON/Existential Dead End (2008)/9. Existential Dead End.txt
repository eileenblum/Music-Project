Puzzled and confused about this mistery called life.
Can you tell me why all this is happening?
Everything around us is building up.
Just to collapse in half the time it was constructed.

Iâm afraid to be swallowed by the sands of time.
Anxious to be a small part of a fading world.
Can you show me the direction I have to go?
All the things surrounding us are but vain constructions.

The question Iâm pondering about is quickly asked:
âWhy are we here?â- It may sound ridiculous to you.
But it is of concern to me. I want to know my place,
my place in this game, in this jigsaw called existence. 

In this jigsaw called existence!!!

One solid piece of truth Iâve already found for me.
DEATH is undeniable and a fact you wonât be able to escape.
Drown in the blood youâve spilled!
I will hold my head up high until the end arrives.


Your vanity is the free-card to your gruesome end.
Ineffable are the demons that will tear your soul apart.
Turn to your fate that will drown you eternally.
Your reign is at an end. Youâre finished here!

Turn to your fate that will drown you eternally.
Your reign is at an end. Youâre finished here!
Youâre finished here!!!
