[Vinyl, Digipack Bonus Track]When ignorance is bliss
Our voices nothing but a sore hiss
We yearn for redemtion, for an end

Yet we keep heading on
While time`s expanding - running slow
Like streams of molten lead
In this moments of need
our memories will soon be gone

There`ll be no end
There`ll be no end
...
No end
No end
...
No end
No end
...
Father, is this the end?
