I'm Arthur Gordon Pym
Or is he me?
Why is everything so grim?
Distress all I see

I'm not the victim,
I'm just the subconscious creator,
But if that's the truth,
Why is there another hell after every grief?
Why do we always stumble into even deeper chasms,
Further down, further down, Further South?

Whither should I flee from myself?
Further down, further down, Further South?!
Whither should I flee from myself?

Further down, further down, Further South?!
Further down, further down,
Into oblivion ...
