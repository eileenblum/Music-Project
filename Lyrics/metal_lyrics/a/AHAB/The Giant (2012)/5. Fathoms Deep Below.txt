No words to mark my anguish then
Of the most appalling awe
Carried into heart of men

Jane Guy wrecked in bloody blazes
All our gear to pieces torn
Confined we are in bizarre mazes
Lost, forgotten and forlorn

Fathoms deep below cognition
Fathoms deep beyond unknown
Fathoms deep beneath perdition
Our fate is carved in stone

Arcane glyphs from hollow earth
Trace our ways from birth to berth

Pervaded by desire
Soul now longs to fall
Escape the dread so dire
End it in a squall
Phantom voice now whispers
Screams within my ears

In bitter swoon I wish to leave
Rushing from my fears

Fathoms deep below
Doomwards let us row!
