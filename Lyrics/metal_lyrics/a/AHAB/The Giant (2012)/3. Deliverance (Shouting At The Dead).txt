A large brig bearing down upon us
Stout man looking down at us
Leaning over the starboard bow
Smiling brilliantly white teeth glow
Thanks given to the Lord
For the unexpected glorious deliverance
There came wafting over the ocean
From the strange vessel a smell, a stench
Such as the whole world has no name for -
no concept of - hellish - utterly suffocating
Shall I ever forget the horror?
Ever remember the life we had?
Shouted to the dead, to the dead
