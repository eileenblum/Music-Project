Feel decay - Pale as clay
And all washed away
Blackest days

Arcane our way - Gone astray
And all washed away - Blackest days

Shades of grey - Aeons of dismay - Blackest days

Indulgentiam, absolutionem et remissionem
Omnium peccatorum uestrorum
Tribuat uobis omnipotens...
But how could we forgive ourselves?

For all we have done
Redemption Lost: our lay
Through wondrous depths
We've walked our way
Redemption Lost: our lay

No rest for the wretched!
No rest for the wicked!
