Masts are broken
Men will break
Yards are shattered
Bodies shake

Bulkheads battered - Planks are burst
This ship is cursed - And so are we
Where to head for? - Where will salvation lie?
What to salvage? - What to leave behind?
This must be a collective lurid dream
For God's sake, make us awake!

We sold our souls to the divinity of oceans,
Bestowed our fortune to the demons of depth
Thus now we are left stranded,
Shipwrecked and collapsed

Lost in the liquid desert
Thousands of miles off
from the main
Uncertain obscurity underneath
The surface cuts the world atwain

A journey to unscrupulousness
A trip to leery human mind
A passage through ruthlessness of soil
A trek towards ferocity
A voyage into unknown
A leap into the dark

All our hopes are anchored to your mercy,
Ye, almighty sea!
