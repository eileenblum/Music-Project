Our boat lurches through damnation
Utter madness embraces me
Faces drawn my starvation
As we dwindle into misery

For a ray of hope we pray
Yet of ruin we are aware
In ports of doom we lay
So I yield to my despair

I feel the iron surges
Break inside my head
I feel the boiling maelstroms
Tear my mind to shreds

Hence I rue
This oath I swore
As every moment
Last for evermore

This world is turned upside down
By malisons of dire revenge
All fleshly means run aground
Hovering between life and death
All sense fade away

Darkness shall overcome!

Will you sink to ageless gloom!
Will you sigh out your soul!
Will you never find a snug berth!
