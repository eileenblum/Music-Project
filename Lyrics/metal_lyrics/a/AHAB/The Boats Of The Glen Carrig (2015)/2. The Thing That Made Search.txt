We looked at one another
Through the smoke
Through the growing dark
(May) the devil take the hindmost

Aye - an unseen thing stood
And cried upon the decks
Through planks of groaning wood
Right above our heads
And scrubbed at the woodwork

Now take the pipe right from your mouth!
At outmost tension - listen! Crouch!
Be aware of horrid powers!
Few moments seem like endless hours

With sheer destructive urge
A many-flapped thing strives
The thing that made search -
Like raw flesh - but it was alive

Secure the fastening, aye!
Brace yourselves!
There's more to it than meets the eye
