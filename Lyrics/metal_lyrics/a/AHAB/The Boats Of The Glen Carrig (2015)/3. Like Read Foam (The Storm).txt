Call me Winterstraw
Mere passenger of the Glen Carrig
Preparing to meet so great a storm
As might well fill the heart with panic

For now it was being slow and oily black
Against the mighty redness of the sky

One quarter of the sky -
A mighty arc of blood-red fire
Doesn't matter who you are
Within the elements fierce ire

The sun, a great full moon
Pale and slightly monochrome
For it appeared to crest
The black cloud like red foam

The sea was all blown up
Into vast clouds of dust
Like froth and I knew
The storm was upon us

No man heard aught of the thunder
The storm's roar made all else silent
Trying to burst our boats asunder
And my memory recalled the distant island

(May God have mercy)
