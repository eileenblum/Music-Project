[Music by Droste, Lyrics by Herman Melville]

Oh, ye great mysterious - Thousand leagues of blue
No one knows which mysteries are hidden
Beneath your surface

Your awful stirrings seem to speak of some
hidden soul beneath

The waves rise and fall
Millions of mixed shades and shadows
Lie dreaming and silent
All what we call lives and souls
Lie dreaming... Silent... Dreaming...

All what we call lives and souls
The ever rolling waves
Restless one
All what we call lives and souls
Lie dreaming
Oh, restless one
Your tide, the beating beast of earth

Oh, ye great mysterious shepherd of waves
Offer me your secrets
So he shall spout thick blood
