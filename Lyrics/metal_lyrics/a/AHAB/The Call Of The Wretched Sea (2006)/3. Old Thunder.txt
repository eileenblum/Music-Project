[Music by Ahab, Lyrics by Christian Hector]

[Ahab:]
"Look sharp, marines!"
"Dead whale or sunk boat!"
"Hunt him 'til he spouts black blood"
"And rolls fin up!"

Old Thunder ye once was called,
Fulfill the prophecy

All but one shall be entombed
In the deep gulf of doom

Beware the white demon
Beware the blasphemous end

([Ahab:]
"I am Ahab!"
"I am the prophet and the fulfiller!"
"Who's over me?"
"So be it!")
