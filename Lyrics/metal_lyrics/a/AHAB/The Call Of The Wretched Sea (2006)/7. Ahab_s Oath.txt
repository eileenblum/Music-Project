[Music by Ahab, Lyrics by Herman Melville]

Now three to three ye stand
Commend the murderous chalices!
Bestow them, ye who now are made parties to this
indissoluble league
Drink ye harpooners
Drink and swear ye men that man the deathful
whaleboat's bow
Death to Moby Dick
God hunt us all, if we do not hunt Moby Dick to his death
