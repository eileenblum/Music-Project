Forged from the bowels of hell
sentenced to an eternity
of damnation

Condemned to a wreckless world
resurrected to end this all
to wreak havok and plague 
all of humanity 

So many years buried in exile
how much animosity I've bestowed

My patience wears thinner by the minute
just waiting for the perfect moment
to destroy humanity 
because I rule by tyranny 

So easily intriqued by the path to extinction
no hope for the entire human race 
such a waste of time and energy
prepare yourself for this infection 

There is no end to my vengance
no pity for you or your kind
this is the end of humanity
your blood shed begins the revolution 

I will destroy
all of humanity
buried in exile
resurrected to end this all
