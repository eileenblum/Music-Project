No one can hear you scream from this distance
Just pure nothing amoungst you
how sweet the stench is of your demise 

You hear my footsteps closing in more and more
I will find you so theres no point in hiding 

Now that I've found you I shall make it worth your while
dragging you to your shallow grave 
streamline of tears runs down your face
now that I've found you I shall make it worth your while 

Bound and gagged
to keep you silenced
my chainsaw yearns 
to rape your carcass
scalpel gleaming 
in the midst of darkness
urging itself 
to seperate your flesh 

Your eyes are getting heavier with every breath u take
your heart begins to race overrun with fear
my knife carves you from sternum to abdomen
flesh and organs ripped from their origin 

Convulsing from massive trauma to your heart
you feel every inch of the blade as it sears your flesh
hell lies below awaiting your arrival 

Dragging you to your shallow grave 
trails of death lead to your bloody hollow
body getting colder with every second 
that passes 

Beg, cry and plea 
it gets you nowhere
no witnesses 
its like you never existed
