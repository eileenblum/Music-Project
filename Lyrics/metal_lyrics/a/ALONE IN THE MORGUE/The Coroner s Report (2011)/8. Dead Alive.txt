Your so dead but you just dont know it
not breathing but yet still alive
why cant you just fucking die
nothing can satisfy your hunger

Why can't you just fucking die 
endless hordes dropped one by one
I will not become the dead alive
overrunning this hell on earth 

Alive but not really breathing
you are the scum of man
the scent of death overwhelms you
I watch as you rot
you decompose underneath the ground
returning in search of your next feast

I will destroy you and the rest of your kind
back to the depths of hell with you
I watch as you rot
hiding beneath the ground 

How does it feel to be the walking dead
infecting the earth with all your filth
how does it feel to be the walking dead
infecting the earth with all your filth 

I have come to make sure you return in pieces
I will make you remain in dirt
flesh ripped and torn from your escrements
decomposing bodies lying dead everywhere 

Bullet wound penetrating your cerebral cortex
defiling your body dragged straight to hell
how I love this form of torment
ripped and torn limb from limb 

Dead bodies everywhere flooding the streets
fuck everyone they all must die  
shotgun facelift
decapitating all who come forth 

I watch you rot
decomposing where you stand 

How does it feel to be the walking dead
infecting the earth with your filth
shotgun placed to your cranium
brains displaced from the back of your skull 

Baseball bat
Lobotomy  

I will destroy your kind
drag you back to hell
and now you decompose
forever remain in dirt
