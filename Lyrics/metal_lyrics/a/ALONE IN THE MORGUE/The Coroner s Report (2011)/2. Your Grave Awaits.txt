I'm here to rid this world of your putrid filth
just the look of your face disgusts me

I will inflict pain that has yet to be seen
without remorse I will decimate everything 
each and everything you've ever loved
will be a thing of the past

One cut three inches in your artery
I sit back and laugh to your disbelief
now just 2 minutes to live
my smile grows as your pulse declines

Watch her body get hacked into tiny pieces
no facial features, unable to be distinguished
razorblade smile ripped from ear to ear
laying in a pool of gore

Say you prayers tell god your on the way
no one will  know  your resting place
the darkness will be your new home
fuck and left to rot

I watch as your life slowly drains away
am I the last thing u wanted to see
before you leave this place
say your prayers tell god your on the way

Too late for apologizes
no need for tears
such a weak emotion
in your dying breathe

Your grave awaits
bow your head in silence
take your final breathe
and say goodnight
