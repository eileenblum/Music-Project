How much I've been waiting for this evening                         
how nicely your dressed for this occassion
how sweet the scent is of you, I can't wait to get you home

So I can rip you apart

Now is this everything that you've been dreaming of

Tell me everything,you fantasize of
my pulse keeps rising, waiting for this night

Scalpel lodged, in your juggular
your skin so soft and pale, you fuck much better dead

Your blood paints my bedroom, your blood paints my sheets

Why cant you believe, that this could happen to you

How much I've been waiting, for this evening
how nicely your dressed for this occassion

Now sleep an eternal sleep, festering for your loved ones to find
How sweet the scent is of you, I cant wait to get you home,
so I can rip you apart

Now sleep an eternal sleep, festering for your love ones to find
How sweet the scent is of you, I cant wait to get you home,
so I can rip you apart

Your blood paints my bedroom, your blood paints my sheets
Why cant you believe, that this could happen to you
