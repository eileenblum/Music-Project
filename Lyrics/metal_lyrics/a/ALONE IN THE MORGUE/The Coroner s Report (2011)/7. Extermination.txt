We are the last of a dying breed
the lost remains of humanity
we are growing stronger by the hour
everyone else has been devoured  

The world has been fucking quarantined
theres nothing left but ashes and ruins
the human race left exterminated
we are the only ones left  

The world as we know it
has been reduced to mere filth
welcome to hell on earth 
where everyone fends for themselves  

I am the one I am the way
the last of a dying breed
welcome to hell on earth
where only ash and ruins remain  

The world has been fucking quarantined
theres nothing left but ashes and ruins
the human race left exterminated
we are the only ones left  

This is the end of forever
is this the end of mankind
this is the end of forever 
is this the end of mankind  

The world as we know it
has been reduce to mere filth
welcome to hell on earth
the human race left exterminated

This is the end of forever
