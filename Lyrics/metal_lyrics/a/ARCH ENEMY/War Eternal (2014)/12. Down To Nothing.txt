[Lyrics: Michael Amott, Music: Michael Amott/Nick Cordle]

The light dwindles down to nothing
As the candle sputters out
Just beyond the ebb and flow
Of a dark and restless heart

Alone again â facing the demons
In this hell of my own making
I will not let this moment define who I am
Now you see me, now you donât
I am strong, eternal
Now you see me, now you donât

Aching the wound now
I shelter in the melody
My ink runs from black to red
Screaming into the void

Alone again â facing the demons
In this hell of my own making
I will not let this moment define who I am
Now you see me, now you donât
I am strong, eternal
Now you see me, now you donât

Seemingly endless...
Like the wind, the stormy seas
I held the poison, I had the power
I will return...

Seemingly endless...
Like the wind, the stormy seas
I held the poison, I had the power
I will return...
