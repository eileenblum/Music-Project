[Lyrics: Alissa White-Gluz, Music: Michael Amott/Daniel Erlandsson]

From a distance, the truth is so obvious.
Answers are all so clear.
Logic stays at arm's length.
When engulfed in the present, here.
Desperation draws near.
If I could pull the fabric of time
And bring the future near,
The answers wouldn't be so far.
The truth would be so clear.

Time is black!
And nothing will escape.
Nothing will remain.
Nothing.

From a distance time is black.
Tangible and dense.
With each rotation a new day passed
And past, at last, makes sense.
There where past obstacles seem
Just pebbles on your path.
Always just a step ahead
The peace I hope to catch.

Time is black!
And nothing will escape.
Nothing will remain.
Nothing.
