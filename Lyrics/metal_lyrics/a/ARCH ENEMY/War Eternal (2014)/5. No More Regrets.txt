[Lyrics: Alissa White-Gluz, Music: Michael Amott/Nick Cordle]

You choose your path
Don't shift the blame
You ran your course
You lost sight of your aim
Wrong choices linger
Like scars remain
Long after the bleeding stops
There's nowhere left to hide from the shame.

[Chorus:]
Never again.
No! No more regrets.
What's done is done - can't be erased.
Know, know your regrets...savour the bitter aftertaste.

The crippling guilt, how heavy it can be
When searching for the right words
Hoping the truth will bring you peace.
A lesson learned is good company
For the lonely road you walk
Each step forward - agony.

[Chorus:]
Never again.
No! No more regrets.
What's done is done - can't be erased.
Know, know your regrets...savour the bitter aftertaste.

It's hard to breathe!
Thought process is crushing me.
Purge mistakes! Strip the mind of its dignity

Liar
Liar

[Chorus:]
Never again.
No! No more regrets.
What's done is done - can't be erased.
Know, know your regrets...savour the bitter aftertaste.

What's done is done - can't be erased.
All I know is but regret.
I can't shake this bitter aftertaste.
