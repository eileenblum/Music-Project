[Lyrics: Michael Amott,	Music: Michael Amott/Nick Cordle]

See the wolf in sheep's skin
Waiting in the shadows
Watching, learningâ¦
Too bad I did not recognize

The dark undertow
Pulling you away
We've been infiltrated,
In fact violated
Carefully orchestrated

[Chorus 2x:]
Hate springs eternal
In this black heart of mine
Time heals nothing
I'll never forgive

You swallowed the lies
In a search for inner peace
With open ears and eyes
Could you not feel

The dark undertow
Pulling you down
You've been infiltrated,
In fact violated
Ultimately desecrated

[Chorus 2x]

Never forget
Never ever

When the dust has settled
I'll watch you drown, drown, drown in your regret

The dark undertow
Pulling you away
We've been infiltrated,
In fact violated
Carefully orchestrated

[Chorus 2x]

Never forget
Never ever
