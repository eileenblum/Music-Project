[Lyrics: Alissa White-Gluz, Music: Michael Amott/Nick Cordle]

We walk through war in the halls
Of dead protocols
We came so close, demands were met
That's when the rug was ripped out from under our feet
A vicious crime...cold betrayal and deceit.

Then reality hits you like a stab in the back
Just like a slap in the face, a premeditated attack

On and on...
The battle knows no victory...
On and on...
Weapons high - Reject defeat.

Decrepit smiles shine like fire
Lying through their teeth.
It's a memory you want to forget...
From one second to another the whole world went under.
The future cuts so deep tangibility bleeds.

Weapons high!

On and on! Until the victory is dead and gone.
On and on! Kill the history, the wrong side won!

Don't let the history repeat...
