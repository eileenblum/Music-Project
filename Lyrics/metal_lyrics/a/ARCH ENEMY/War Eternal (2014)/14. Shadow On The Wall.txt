[Bonus Track][originally by Mike Oldfield]Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Like a shadow on the wall

Treat me like a prisoner
Treat me like a fool
Treat me like a loser
Use me as a tool
Face me 'til I'm hungry
Push me in the cold
Treat me like a criminal
Just a shadow on the wall

Treat me like I'm evil
Freeze me 'til I'm cold
Beat me 'til I'm feeble
Grab me 'til I'm old
Fry me 'til I'm tired
Push me 'til I fall
Treat me like a criminal
Just a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Like a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Like a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
Like a shadow on the wall

Shadow on the wall
Shadow on the wall
