[Lyrics: Michael Amott, Music: Michael Amott/Nick Cordle]

The judging eyes watching me
Is all I've ever known.
When I try to open up my heart
I am ridiculed and torn apart.
You tell jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back at my expense.

There's something inside me
And I know it's good.
I'm not evil, just misunderstood.

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name!
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name!

Today I break my silence
Strip you of your dignity.
Tear down your perfect world
Your perfect lies!

No more jokes I'll never get to hear
Behind my back at my expense.

There's something inside me
And I know it's good.
I'm not evil, I'm just misunderstood.

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name!
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name!

No longer invisible

You will know my name!

Do you see me now?
Do you hear me now?
You will know my name!
Do you see me now?
Do you fear me now?
You will know my name!

No longer invisible

You will know my name!
