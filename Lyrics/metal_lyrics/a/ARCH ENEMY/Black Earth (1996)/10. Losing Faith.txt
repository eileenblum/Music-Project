[Lead - Christopher]

As I walk alone
Paralysed and frozen
Weakened by the fact
It is the life that I have chosen

[Chorus:]
This is life that I believed in
Sentences me without mercy

Staring down the depths
Of the mind once again
Regret this way of living
Retrospectives in the end
Losing faith in heaven
Now conform to hell
Blindfolds of romance
This pain I can not bear
