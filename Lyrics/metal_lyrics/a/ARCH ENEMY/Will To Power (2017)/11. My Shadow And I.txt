You bathe in sorrow, drowning in hate
You kill tomorrow, fighting against the fates
Raise hell - wipe that smile off your face
Raise hell - fall into place

Pick up your entrails the time has come
Leave the bed of nails, let it all burn
Raise hell - wipe that smile off your face
Raise hell - embrace hell

Nobody drives you down the less traveled road
Me and my shadow - we know the way through

Your face disgusts me, turn it away
You think you know at whom you're staring?
Raise hell - I'll scrape that smile off your face
Raise hell - The end of all days

What is this defense you're drowning in?
Give up the pretense, it's sink or swim
Raise hell - I'll scrape that smile off your face
Raise hell - The end of all days

Nobody drives you down the less traveled road
Me and my shadow - we know the way through

Right behind me matching every stride
Though you're made of darkness
You only appear in the light

You made your bed, now lay

Why die in peace while living in fear?
Didn't you know your heaven was insincere
Raise hell - unite the fire and sky
Raise hell - and bury the lie

Nobody drives you down the less traveled road
Me and my shadow - we know the right way to go
