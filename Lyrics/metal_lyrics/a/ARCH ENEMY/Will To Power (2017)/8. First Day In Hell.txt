Torn from home, sent down death's railroad, are we
When we wake up tomorrow
Will we still be wearing this curse?
Will we wake up tomorrow?
Which punishment is worse?

Day one: no sun
Stripped of our names
Now we are merely numbers
Permanently inked in the flames

Our kind - our existence lights the fire
Igniting hell on earth
Archangels bending crosses, hooked

Innocent men, women, children
Sentenced before conviction
With golden stars to guide them
Their gavel is the end of a gun

Day two: lived through
More culprits arrive
Every cage so crowded
How will we survive through the night?

Our kind - our existence lights the fire
Igniting hell on earth
Archangels bending crosses, hooked

First day in hell

First day in hell
See the terror in abandoned gazes...
Fear sunken eyes
Get the guards and walk a dozen paces, saturnine

Incarcerated without reason
Doomed by blood
Anti-venom for a poisoned nation
Our birth right

Week five: alive
Soon out of time
After all that I've, here, witnessed
There's no value in life

Our kind - our existence lights the fire
Igniting hell on earth
Archangels bending crosses, hooked

First day in hell
First week in hell
See the terror in abandoned gazes
Fear sunken eyes
Get the guards and walk a dozen paces, saturnine

First month in hell
Incarcerated without reason
Doomed by blood
Anti-venom for a poisoned nation
Our birth right

Last day in hell
