Turning a blind eye
Won't make the world disappear
The second sight returns
So, too, does the pain and fear

I'll refuse to acknowledge
I'll refuse to accept
Reality force-feeding me anguish and regret

You... once so close to me
This once-so-sacred place is now a murder scene
Your name? Just a soliloquy, dead to me
Your presence forever will be exposure therapy

There stand strangers where the world used to be
Can't take change or are retinas still not letting me see?

I'll refuse to acknowledge
I'll refuse to accept
Reality force-feeding me anguish and regret

You... once so close to me
This once-so-sacred place is now a murder scene
Your name? Just a soliloquy, dead to me
Your presence forever will be exposure therapy

No "we", no "us"
Two halves un-whole
I'm your sisyphus
You laugh every roll

And you will suffer
And you will drown
You are the victor? How heavy's the crown?

You... once so close to me
This once-so-sacred place is now a murder scene
Your name? Just a soliloquy, dead to me
Your presence will forever be dead to me
