Processed, diluted
Virtually unrecognizable
I was lost there - No direction
A scattered void

No more
It's over
I'm on to you
Your evil game
The tables have turned
I am taking back my soul

Tranquilized, Scrutinized
Hate injected mind
As if internal wounds
Wouldn't bleed, Wouldn't hurt me

I see through your lies
Taking back what's mine
