The human race
Like a chromatic stain
Lost in concrete fields
Hybrids of steel

Mechanic god creation
Enter annihilation

We are rendered obsolete
Just a relic at their feet
Not cold enough - Too human

The doomsday machine
Created by man
Like a black dawn rising
To conquer - Conquer and destroy

Mechanic god creation
Enter annihilation

Climbing the walls
The walls are too high
They swallow the Sun
Ebony sky

We are rendered obsolete
Just a relic at their feet
Not cold enough - Too human
