Disinfected torture chamber
A scientific abattoir
Their death is the price of your progress
If these walls could talk, they'd scream

No empathy
No dignity

Cruelty without beauty
Cruelty without beauty

Archaic rhetoric your weak defense
Your victims have no choice, no voice
Look in their eyes, does it still make sense?
A plastic bag their burial gown

No empathy
No dignity

Cruelty without beauty
Cruelty without beauty

[Solos]

A legacy of evil you preserve
Their blood cannot be washed clean
In my eyes their brutal fate you deserve
In your dreams you will hear them scream
