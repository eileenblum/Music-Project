Gripping the strength of belief
Old tales and lies you trust
In the end there is no relief
A final breath you're breathing dust

[Lead - Christopher]

Get up off your praying knees
The door is about to slam shut
Armageddon, drawing near
As darkness engulfs your soul

All the prayers in this world
Wonât help you now

You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross
You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross

A perverted truth your reality
Forced your beliefs on the weak
Power twisted by years of abuse
The strong shall inherit the meek

Get up off your praying knees
The door is about to slam shut
Armageddon, drawing near
As darkness engulfs your soul

All the prayers in this world
Wonât help you now

You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross
You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross

[Mike solo]

You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross
You deceived, they believed
In your bloodstained cross

[Harmony lead - Michael &amp; Christopher]

[Under solo:]
All the prayers in this world
Won't help you now
