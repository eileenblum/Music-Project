Infestation
Of spirit and flesh

Indignation
Is all you left me with

Domination
Your ultimate goal

Transmigration
You will lose control

[Lead - Christopher]

I will rise up and prove you wrong
I have been waiting in the shadows for too long

[Harmony - Michael &amp; Christopher]

The gates are opening - My true self unleashed

[Lead - Michael / Christopher]

Laceration
Of my mind and soul

Alteration
Your truth is full of lies

Liberation
Sweet revenge is mine

Devastation
You will burn in my hell

[Lead - Christopher]

I will rise up and prove you wrong
I have been waiting in the shadows for too long

[Harmony - Michael &amp; Christopher]

The gates are opening - My true self unleashed

Vengeance is mine!

[Lead - Christopher]

[Harmony - Michael &amp; Christopher]

The gates are opening - My true self unleashed
