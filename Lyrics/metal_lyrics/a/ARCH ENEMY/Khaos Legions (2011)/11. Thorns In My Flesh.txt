[Intro lead - Michael]

Liar, liar
Conceal the truth
Severed tongue
With a serpent's fire
Beggar, pursuer
Master of deceit
With your own interest at heart

When it all came to light
Innocence was lost
How do you sleep at night
Lost trust turned to dust

[Lead - Christopher]

All for one, one for all
Did not apply to you
An intricate web of lies
As the wheels kept on turning

[Melody - Michael]

No more thorns in my flesh
No more chains hold me down
I control my destiny

[Lead - Michael]

Lost trust turned to dust

[Melody - Michael]

No more thorns in my flesh
No more chains hold me down
I control my destiny
