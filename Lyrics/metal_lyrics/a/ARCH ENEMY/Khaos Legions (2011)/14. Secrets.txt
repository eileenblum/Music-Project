[Intro melody - Michael]

I've got a secret - I just can't tell
I have created my own hell
If you knew what I know
It would change your perfect world

Locked the vault - Thrown away the key
My lips are forever sealed
Buried in a place you'll never see
This secret dies with me

Don't ask me - For I cannot tell
Words can kill - Sharp as a blade of steel

Skeletons of the past...

This burden, this pain
Were all these tears in vain?
Memories of the past return
This one is going with me to the grave

It is beating me up inside
To that I must confess
Secret weighing down my soul
Until I draw my very last breath

Don't ask me - For I cannot tell
Words can kill - Sharp as a blade of steel

Skeletons of the past...
Skeletons of the past...

[Lead - Michael]

Skeletons of the past...
Skeletons of the past...

[Lead - Christopher]
[Outro melody - Michael]
