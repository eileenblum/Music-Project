Here I am, back to the wall,
I picked the fight against the time,
Free at last I go my own way,
I will resist them, till the day I die,
I am who I am; my time has come.

I am who I am, take it or leave it,
A rebel at heart,
No gods, no masters,
My time has come.

There is no second place,
No perfect world,
Your head is whole,
Freedom in your heart,
Be strong; take this chance,
Make your way; a better future comes.
I am who I am; my time has come.

I am who I am, take it or leave it,
A rebel at heart,
No gods, no masters,
My time has come.
No gods, no masters.

What doesnât kill us make us stronger.
Locked and loaded ready to strike,
You stand loud and proud, united as one.

I am who I am, take it or leave it,
A rebel at heart,
No gods, no masters,
My time has come.
