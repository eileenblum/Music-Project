[Lyrics: Angela Gossow, Music: Michael Amott / Christopher Amott]

Fearless on my final quest
Find truth beyond the flesh
Fleeting past my dreams of unfulfilled desire
My strength unwavering
My journey just beginning
A desperate race through the corridors of hell

Chaos emerges â Surrender I will not

The Last Enemy Is Falling
Here I am â To Conquer Death Itself
The Last Enemy Is Falling
Here I stand â To Conquer Death Itself

Funeral silence beneath the burning cross
My immortal soul sleeps with the wolves tonight
Shin and bones that rot, my blood runs dry
See me die to rise with the gods again

[Harmony â Michael &amp; Christopher]
[Lead â Christopher]

Defyâ¦ Decay
Arise again

[Harmony â Michael &amp; Christopher]

[Lead â Michael]

Chaos emerges
Surrender I will not

[Melody â Michael]
[Acoustic Outro â Christopher]
