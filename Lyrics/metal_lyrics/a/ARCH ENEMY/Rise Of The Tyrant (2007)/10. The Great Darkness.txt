[Lyrics: Angela Gossow, Music: Michael Amott]

A greater darkness, my mindâs possessed
Disillusioned, numb emptiness
(No hope) I feel a paralyzing fear
(No salvation) faking control
Their coldness hurt me beyond belief

DOMINUS BEO SPIRITUS

Will I burn?
Will I be free?
The great darkness consumed my soul

DIABOLUS LIBERO SPIRITUS

Blind my eyes, I hate the light
Despair, frustration, regret
Fighting â fighting for what?
Lies, your lies â I feel dead inside
My pain is all I leave behind

A shadow â the only light I followed
Transparent I am â like a ghost

[Lead â Michael]

A far cry from whom I wanted to be
I never found my place, my place nor peace

[Lead â Christopher]
