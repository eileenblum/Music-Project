[Lyrics: Angela Gossow / Michael Amott, Music: Michael Amott / Daniel Erlandsson]

[Melody â Michael]

A precious child with innocent mind
Born to suffer, in this life or for another

So hopeless and relentless falls this remorseless day
The dark remains of a violent world

They day you died my tears ran dry
I feel you, I hear you echo in my soul
I failed you, I miss you so
The day you died echoes in my soul

[Melody â Michael]
[Lead â Christopher]

This worldâs on fire â turned its back on us
A lost horizon left behind

So hopeless and relentless falls this remorseless day
The dark reality of a hostile world

[Lead â Christopher]
[Lead â Michael]
[Melody â Michael]
