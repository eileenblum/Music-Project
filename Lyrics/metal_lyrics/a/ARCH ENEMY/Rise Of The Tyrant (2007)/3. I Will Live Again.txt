[Lyrics: Angela Gossow, Music: Michael Amott / Daniel Erlandsson / Christopher Amott]

I donât know
I cannot see
Who we are now
How we used to be

Is it you?
Or is it we?
Look in the mirror
We are a fading memory

Where are we?
We got lost
In the cold

I will live again youâll see â tomorrowâs not scaring me
Far away from yesterday â just take this pain away

Fatal chaos
Hurtful lies
A broken dream
Is all we left behind

Is it you?
Or is it we?
Look in the mirror
Just a fading memory
