[Lyrics: Michael Amott, Music: Michael Amott / Christopher Amott / Daniel Erlandsson]

Who is your god â is he not mine?
Who is your devil â are we the same?
What makes you worse
What makes me better

Never to trust again â how long have I got?

In this darkened maze
They keep me away â they scream at night
Screams at night

Who is your master
In this shallow grave?

Born to die for a lie
I have no soul â I have no pride
Genocide

Where is justice in this hell?
Where is liberty â I paid the price
My life blood runs dry
Slowly drained from me

[Lead â Christopher]
[Harmony â Michael &amp; Christopher]
[Lead â Christopher]
[Lead â Michael]

Screams at night
â¦Alone is this shallow grave I dieâ¦
