[Lyrics: Angela Gossow, Music: Michael Amott / Christopher Amott]

You were born your brotherâs keeper
Why can I see blood on your hands?
How became your brotherâs slayer
Embrace again in death

At the end of all this hatred lies even deeper hate
Their darkness has defeated you â Your lifeline running backwards

Remember â Sins Of Our Fathers
A Requiem â For The Countless Dead

Blood is on your hands â The wages of sin

[Theme â Michael]

Futureâs eyes closing now
Soul eclipse taking place
Laments rise â tears of the dead
From the other side of the grave

You were born your brothers keeper
Why can I see blood on your hands?
Their darkness has defeated you
Your lifeline running backwards

[Theme â Michael]
[Lead â Christopher]
[Lead â Michael]
[Harmony â Michael &amp; Christopher]
