[Lyrics: Angela Gossow, Music: Christopher Amott / Michael Amott]

[Intro â Michael &amp; Christopher]
[Lead â Christopher]

Breathing life into these mares where enemies turn into flesh
This is the abyss I fear the most â I feel their eyes staring at me

Waiting with carnivorous patience, their memory timeless
For all they know I must succumb sometimeâ¦

[Lead â Michael]

A solemn cry rises to the sky as heavy wings blacken out
The morning sun with infinite darkness. Am I dreaming or am I dead?

In search for my heart â Lost in this hell
The vultures are soaring above â Tearing me apart

[Lead â Christopher]

Screaming Voices in my head. A sudden pain then deadly silence
Devouring the remains of my heart â I can feel it dying

[Lead â Christopher]

Picking at the bones of my soul
Left me dead inside
The more I gave the more they took
Left me dead inside

[Lead â Michael]

[Outro â Michael &amp; Christopher]
