[music: Michael Amott, lyrics: Angela Gossow]

The end is near. Panic is closing in. Sick with fear they run
Watch freedomâs fall. What have we become? Cannon foder

[Lead â Christopher]

Reign of terror. Enslave the nations â devastation!
This is war â Pull the trigger. One nation under their control
Rise â The Tyrants rise! The enemy inside â The tyrants rise
The end is here â Feel it closing in
Blood runs red

Watch in horror â Our lives destroyed
We failed

[Lead â Michael]

The final holocaust
Enslave the nations â annihilation!

This is war â Pull the trigger. One nation out of control

[Lead â Christopher] [Lead â Michael]
[Lead â Christopher] [Lead â Michael]

War, pain suffering
The price we pay to stay alive
Blood, fire, death
His Glory come, his kingdom rise
This world will burn!
