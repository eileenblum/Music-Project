[music: M. Amott / C.Amott; lyrics: M. Amott]

Beware the beast of man
For he's the devils pawn
Alone among god's primates
He kills for sport, lust or greed

The sacred scrolls...
The truth unfolds...

Shun him - or become like him
Shun him - the beast of man

Let him not breed in great numbers
For he will make a dessert of his home and yours
Shun him - drive him back into his jungle lair
For he is the harbinger of death
