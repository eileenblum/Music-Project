[music: M. Amott; lyrics: M. Amott]

Hideous crimes, atrocities
The slaughter of millions - beyond belief
Those were dark times, so different from now
The law of evil ruled our fatherland

I was but a pawn in their game
Why should I feel any guilt?
Still when I close, close my eyes
The words unfold, it all comes back

I can't defy it, can't deny it
I know it ot be true
In my sleep - they come to haunt me
They know it to be true
Tears of the dead

We are all on the turning wheel of fate
A young man, standing proud in uniform
I never stopped to hesitate
Until it was far to late

My hands are soiled, covered in blood
Stains that never wash away
Their hollow eyes...
Confronting me - Judging me

Now an old man, at the end of my days
Contemplating - My life of sin
Living is never simple - the rosad is hard
I had no say - just a puppet in a sick play
