[Music: Michael Amott/Christopher Amott]
[Lyrics: Angela Gossow/Michael Amott]

Step inside the circle of fire
Flames of desire enlighten the night
Follow your instinct
Burn and writhe in ecstasy

Love will turn to hate
Heat will turn to ice
There is nothing in between
The first deadly sin

Ancient taboo takes control
The demon eve possesses your soul
Riding high above the flames
You will step into hell

[Lead and slide solo - Christopher]

Dwell in passionate evil
Forbidden fruits of lust
Embrace and kiss the face of death
It's your first deadly sin
