[Lead - Christopher]

At the mercy of our conscience
Confined within our fate
Never really questioned why
We are refugees in a dying world

To become a part of the end

Are we the ones, the ones to blame?
We are mortals of shadows and dust

[Lead melody - Michael]

The sun sets on our sinking ship of fools
On our journey into oblivion
We ask ourselves again and again
Now will we be remembered

[Lead - Michael]

Shadows...
And dust...
