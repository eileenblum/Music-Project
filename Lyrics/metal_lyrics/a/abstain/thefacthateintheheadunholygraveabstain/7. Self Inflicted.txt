[performed by Abstain]We all pass the blame, it's not our fault
Time to accept the blame, deny no more
The truth is we are all a part of the problem
The truth is we need some introspection
We must look within responsibility for all your actions
Look to yourself without misdirection, we must look within
Change yourself and live with no remorse
