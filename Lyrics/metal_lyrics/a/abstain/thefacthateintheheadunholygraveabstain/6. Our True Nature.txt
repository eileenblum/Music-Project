[performed by Abstain]The fields are buried, crosses remind us all of sacrifice
Yet they do not prevent us from making the same mistakes
Fighting the good fight, God is on our side
War without end, relentless bloodshed with noting to defend
Killing and killing and killing again, and then starting all over again
We create suffering, fighting the good fight
God is on our side, may all of their sons lie dead
We are bred to kill, our true nature is to kill
