[performed by Abstain]Get up off your fucking ass and take part in your fate
Take advantage of the system that's got you in a frozen state
Use your voice, fight for your cause, stand your ground against biased laws
Assert your will, don't play dead, affect your world, use your fucking head
If we don't stop them now what will change our tomorrow
Let us kick their elitist ass back to their beloved past
Too easy to play dead, wake up and use your head
Decisions are being made for you, how does that make you feel
