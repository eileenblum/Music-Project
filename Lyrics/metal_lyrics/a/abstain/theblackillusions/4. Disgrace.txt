While the masses are praying, the priests are collecting
This repulsive behaviour is a disgrace for the human race

Religion causes suppression
on those who are are feeble-minded
And for you in need of belief -
I say: Start believe in yourself!

While the masses are in confession for a non-existing god
Another rape is comitted and the victim bares the cross

Religion causes suppression
on those who are are feeble-minded
And for you in need of belief -
I say: Start believe in yourself!
