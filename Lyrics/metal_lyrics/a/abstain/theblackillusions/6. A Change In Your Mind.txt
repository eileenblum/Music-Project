Your ancient morale makes me indignant
Your inherited opinions affect the way you act
Your blurred illusion withholds the revolution!
A change in your mind will strengthen the progression!

Lighten up! Be candid for the actions
Observe - comprehend - control - react!
Your blurred illusion withholds the revolution!
A change in your mind will strengthen the progression!
