Evacuate the earth! What else can we do?
Evacuate the earth! Time is running short...
No time for repentance, no time for regret -
just leave this forsaken ground
The dream about the utopia
is just an inversion of the truth

Succumb - the horror, invoke - the end

Evacuate the earth! End all while you can
Evacuate the earth! Do not postpone your fate
Leave all the chaos, leave all the turmoil -
leave this carcass called earth
When all hope is lost, close your eyes
and fall into the illusion

Succumb - the horror, invoke - the end
