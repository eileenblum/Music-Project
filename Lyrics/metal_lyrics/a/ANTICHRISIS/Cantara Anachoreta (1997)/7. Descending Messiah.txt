Down in the valley on a midwinter's night
walks _The_Crone, unseen by human kind
_Her_ weary heart longing for rest
_Her_ eyes saw too much of sorrow and grief

There was a time when _She_ was adored
and the valley full of bliss and joy
until the day the gaunt one appeared
He never smiled nor shed any fear!

And he raised his voice "Behold I'm Messiah!"
It was then _She_ knew the time had come!
A dream? A dream?
It's only a dream!
A dream? A dream?
_She_ lives in my dream

The man, he spoke of commandments and sin
of wicked wifes, of chaste and virtious men
He'd sown the seed of mischief in their hearts:
Those once proud, now a submissive crowd!

And he raised his voice "Behold I'm Messiah!
I'm the son of god!
I come in fire!
My kingdom come!
My will be done!"
It was the _she_ knew her time had come!
A dream? A dream? It's only a dream!
A dream? A dream? _She_ lives in my dreams...

Now the blind are leading the blind!
Independence and wisdom exchanged
for ignorance and minority
Seizure and oppression amongst the
once born free!

But still no one dared
to raise a hand against _The_Crone_
They were aware - despite his sermons -
that _She_ still held
_The_Strength_ and _The_Power_!

And as _She_ makes her way through centuries and decades
_She_ waits for human kind to awake
to snake off the chains of Messiah!
In patience _She_ walks the world in search
for those who uphold
the memento of the Golden Age!
While in his church, in fitful sleep,
formented by nightmares
lies Messiah in fright of the dark!
The demons he raised to strike the blind with fear
were not just a mirage: They've become
alive - to haunt Messiah!
To end creation's devastation, the senseless sacrifice
_She_, _The_Weaver_, weaves The Veil of Damnation!

And out of the dark, _Valkyries_ and _Erinyes_ rising
Avenging Angels of doom?
Called by _The_Crone_ the wandering ones
seek for vengeance
Awaiting The Last Stand!
The Earth awakes in fire, thunderstorm and lightning
Night calls into being decline!
And up in the skies: The Crone in the midst of silence
Armagideon has now begun!

And out of his dreams Messiah pleas:
"_Goddess_, have mercy upon me!!!"

"Misguided prophet see _My_Scythe_
descending over you!!!"

Down in the valley neath the river of time
sits _The_Crone_ remembering human kind
Now winter's gone and springtime has come
And all the ashes are washed away

and he raised his voice...
