Destiny turned the page to another side in my book of life:
"He who once was artless like a child had
to face the blackest night!"
While I was unaware, _She_ must have
silently faded away:
"Whereas his shadow walks The Earh in
restless search for _The_Queen!"

As the cold begins to bite, in _Nightmare's_
_realm_ I lie awake:
"Fading voices calling back the years into
time's deadly embrace!"
Behind these delusive hills where gales
ensnare a paralyzed sun:
"In sombre distress he's entering the hall
just to find _Her_Orphaned_Throne!"

Broken and desperate before _Her_
_Orphaned_Throne_
Holding a dying sparraw in his hands
His eyes full of tears had seen the wasted land
Will _She_ ever come again?
Ever come again?

Suam sanclam ad sedern liceat me vobis sequi
Si sanum me facere volueritis
Suam sancta ad sedem, ad marin
Si enim hoc loco versatus sim, periturus est
Suam sanctam ad sedem liceat me vobis sequi
Num hoc solo loco me _Dea_ expectat

Passion turned out to be a slip of the pen
amongst the lines of fate:
"All that was left in the end: Forgotten
echoes in a dream!"
For only a fool's solemnity might ignite
the driftwood of my heart:
"Still _My_Life_ shines on every move you make:
Just call _My_Name_ and I'll be there!"

So cranky and blind I did not see, rashness
made me lose my own way:
"Fragments of glass cutting through his veins:
I shall save him from this pain!"

Destiny turned the page to the final
chapter in my book of life:
"Awake see him lie in _Marah's_warm_embrace_
- I'm returning on _My_Throne_!"

Broken and desperate...
