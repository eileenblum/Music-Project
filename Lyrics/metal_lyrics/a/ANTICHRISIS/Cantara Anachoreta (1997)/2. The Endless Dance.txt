[Jehovah:]
Read in my book of lies
of atrocities, blood and sacrifice!
My temples erected in gold and bone
The stupid sheep turn theis head to the blind!

[Priestess:]
And comes the winter of your life
The king of kings - left to your own device
The ones who thought to walk in light
will freeze to death in the endless night!

[The Angels:]
The _Goddess_Of_The_Night_ comes!
3 curses to the holy throne!
No regrets!
It's too late!
The _Goddess_Of_The_Night_ comes!
Will ask for what have you done!
The father, holy ghost and son!
No remand...

[The Witch:]
The sisters murdered king long ago
still sing their songs in my heart
The tunes, the pipes, the words, the rhymes
Still call me through the times!

[Jehovah:]
Your senseless prayers I never hear
The sign of the cross in praise of your fear!
Your little belief is just a crap
on the rotten body of your so-called "Christ"!

[Priestess:]
The blind, the crippled and the lame
still keep the faith in a god of disgrace
But a songless bird will never sing
to the dying glory of a bogous king!

[The Angels:]
The _Goddess_Of_The_Night_ comes...

[The Witch:]
The sisters murdered king ago
still sing their songs in my heart
The tunes, the pipes, the words, the rhymes
Still call me through the times!

"You cut me down and I'll leap high
I am the Life that never dies
So dance where ever you may be
The ruler of the dance is she!"

[The Fool:]
And my elder sister takes me by the hand
And we spiral sideways to a far away land
In the Tempest she sings with the
Ocean's roar
Glowing in the Storm that the Mermaid bore!

Them witches calling
Up from the shore
They walk behind me
Throught the door!

Oh, my youngest sister, oh where haev you been?
Behind the moon on the other side of dream?
Oh, she guides me back sa the raven cries
but we'll meet again for to dance in the skies!

[Jehovah:]
I am the scum of this dark age
I'm your beginning and your end!
Ovlivion takes my place
The frame holds just another face of death!

[Priestess:]
Abd who will count the slaughtered lifes?
The Burned? The Tortured? The Demised?
All The Blood of the Innocent?
The Decline of the stolen Trinity?

[The Angels:]
The _Goddess_Of_The_Night_ comes...

[The Witch:]
The sisters murdered long ago

_The_Endless_Dance_
