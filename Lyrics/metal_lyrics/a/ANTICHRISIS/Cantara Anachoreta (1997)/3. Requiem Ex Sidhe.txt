And wil the vows be heard
Of immortal desire
A breathtaking darkness
Into the abyss we dive
As you were mine

And as memories fade
Just like trails of smoke
On a midwinter's night
You kept holding me tight
As you were mine

On came the nights
When stormclouds veiled the skies
All heavens stood still
And all the worlds did collide
"Forgive me - I failed!"
Lovelorn I will die
Nothing more than a dream
That you were mine

In my cold whilte hands
A lover's bequest
There were stars on our side
Oh Eva - just one last caress
For your were mine

"My friens: The most precious gift",
Said the fool,
"Is a love that follows no rule!
There's no use in turning away!
So why are you turning away?"
