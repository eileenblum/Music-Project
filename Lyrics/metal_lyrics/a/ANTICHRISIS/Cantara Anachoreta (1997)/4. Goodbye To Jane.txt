See the girl on the floor
As she's watching the rain
Like sallow tracks of blood poring down
Scattered over the floor
The sheets painted in black
Showing a fettered mouthless child
Her Mother's gone shopping and she prays
For her Daddy not to come home
But for Jane's prayers no god gives a damn
Her Daddy is back to play with Jane!

She closes her eyes to break away from the girl
Lying raped and abused on the ground
No use to commit herself to anyone
For who's believe Jane
She feels hate for being treated this way
Is it her fault Daddy's playing these games?
She tries in vain to think of something
She might have done wrong

Goodbye to Jane
Goodbye to Jane
Goodbye to Jane

See the girl on the floor
She can't bear it no more:
Lewdy hands defiling her skin!
A life like that means not much to Jane
The belt 'round her neck gently takes her away!
He's closing the door for she seems asleep:
Those sickening games won't be played anymore!
No-one could explain what happend to Jane
She was only one in a million girls

Goodbye to Jane
Goodbye to Jane
Goodbye to Jane
