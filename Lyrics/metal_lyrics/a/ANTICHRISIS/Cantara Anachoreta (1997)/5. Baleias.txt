By the river I sat down one day
Saw my life the other way
All those trials to no avail
Broken dreams was all I bloody gained

Way down,
Carry me down
To the River of Life!
Vindicate!

Remember well when I was a child
They promised me a paradise
But promises turned into lies
All they left us was a world demise!

Way down,
Carry me down
To the River of Life!
Anyhow!

Hold me in your arms
Drown me in sweet moisture
Lascivious fiery breath covering
Your fangs softly penetrate
the pleasure and the pain!
Dissolving I discern:
I'm not dead!

I asked for love, got a golden cage
Plastic emotions in a plastic age
The pain I felt they told me wasn't real
"The Earth!", I cried - my last appeal!

Way down,
Carry me down
To the River of Life!
Come to light!

Now it's my turn to realize
To change the road, to change the side
The past has gone: May it rest in peace
A new dawn fades as She sows the seed

Way down,
Carry me down
To the River of Life!
Recognize!

Hold me in your arms...
Drown me in sweet moisture
Lascivious fiery breath overflow
Your fangs softly penetrate
the pleasure and the pain!
Dissolving I discern:
I'm still alive!

A midnight's dream disclosure
saw momentous desire
My life layed in your hands,
My confidence!
The background of reality
just one step away
Am I to cross the frontier?
Am I to dare?

In dreams I died a thousand times
But then one dream: A golden shrine
Her whispered words did soothe my grief
What a candour in this world of thieves

Way down,
Carry me down
To the River of Life!
Indicate!

I hear the call of the roaring sea
Still a fire's burning inside of me
The wind shall take me to another shore
The Earth I am, for evermore!

Way down,
Carry me down
To the River of Life!
Eternity!

And as I try to stand the trial
Dreams and Memories of You
Come haunting me like demons!

But I won't fail this time
Because my Love had been asleep for much too long!

Oh Eva,
Your Love so previous and pure!
May the Goddess grant me a second miracle
So I may lie in Your arms again!

For You are the Sun,
the Moon and the Stars to me!
You are the only one I desire
from the depths of my heart!

Desperate I walk the blackness of the Maze
Trying to follow the footsteps
of an unforgetable Love
they's bring me back again
to You, Eva, my Beloved!
