By the ocean I sat down one day
Saw my life the other way
All those trials to no avail
Broken dreams was all I gained

Well, when I was a child
They promised me a paradise
Promises turned into lies
leaving us a world demise!

Way down, carry me down
to the ocean of love

I asked for love, a golden cage
No emotions in this age
The pain I felt it wasn't real
"The Earth!", I cried: My last appeal!

It's my turn to realize
To change the road, change the side
Past has gone, rest in peace
Goddess sows the seed

Way down....

Hold me in your arms
Drown me in sweet moisture
Lascivious fiery breath overflow....
Your fangs softly penetrate
the pleasure and the pain
Dissolving I discern:
Im alive!

In dreams I died a thousand times
Then one dream: A golden shrine
Whispered words soothed my grief
Candour in a world of thieves

The call of the roaring sea
Fire burn inside of me
Wind take me to her shore
The Earth I am, for evermore!

Way down.....

I asked for love, a golden cage
No emotions in this age
The pain I felt it wasn't real
The Earth!, I cried: My last appeal!

It's my turn to realize
To change the road, change the side
Past has gone, rest in peace
Goddess sows the seed

Way down....

Hold me in your arms
Drown me in sweet moisture
Lascivious fiery breath covering....
Your fangs softly penetrate
the pleasure and the pain
Dissolving I discern:
Im alive!

A midnight's dream disclosure
saw momentous desire
My life layed in your hands,
My confidence....
The background of reality
just one step away
Am I to cross the frontier?
Am I to dare?

By the ocean I sat down one day
Saw my life the other way
All those trials to no avail
Broken dreams was all I gained

Well, when I was a child
They promised me a paradise
Promises turned into lies
leaving us a world demise!

Way down...

In dreams I died a thousand times
Then one dream: A golden shrine
Whispered words soothed my grief
Candour in a world of thieves

The call of the roaring sea
Fire burn inside of me
Wind take me to her shore
The Earth I am, for evermore!

Way down...

Alone again I cried
amongst the debris of a dream
I had to face once more
the madness of love
But now that my Angel
received my yearning call
her enchanting song
will make my heart dance!
