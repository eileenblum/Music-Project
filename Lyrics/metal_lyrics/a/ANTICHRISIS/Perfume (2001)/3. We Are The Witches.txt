A gathering at night
A knock-knock on the door
Dressed in a red cloak
Her eyes gleaming with delight
The moment she's been waiting for
finally arrived
Sister's waiting for her
While the stars are shining bright

Incubus and succubus
The evil foe has cursed on us
The Demons rise on Hallowmass
Oh, this devilishness...

A plague came over us again
striking down my fellow-men
The priest became a scatterbrain
My word for it, Mister!

The churchyard it came tumbling down
The king of kings: A brainless clown
The prior stuck in the eiderdown
and I had to witness!

The piper played a dancing tune
and all came out on Harvest Moon
Altars staying unillumed
and women sinister!

Now she's awake
Dancing in the firelight
The dragon's call resounds
The serpent's kiss ignites
The fire of love
The dawning of a new day
Oh, sister of the night
You're the light of the world

Spellbound they're screaming in the street
How could we fall? Oh, this defeat...
The ruthless on the losing streak
We are so wasted!

So stupid that we did not see
How all those things should really be
The eyesore of humanity
a flawed mastermind!

What once seemed apprehensible
has turned into dispensible
because of being nonsensical
We should have been basted!

But now we've come to realize
the senselessness of alibis
and squander of self-sacrifice
so deaf, dull and blind!

We are the flow, we are the ebb
We are the weavers, we are the web
We are the flow, we are the ebb
We are the witches back from the dead

See me, I am life
and it's your birthright
to walk proud and strong
Come dance with the tide
We've been there before
And we shall return
for now and evermore
now and evermore...

We are the flow, we are the ebb
We are the weavers, we are the web
We are the flow, we are the ebb
We are the witches back from the dead

Up on the hill she peers
down by the sea she waits
Her sisters gathering by her side
until disturbance dies
It was another case of
self-fulfilling prophecy
Those faithful believers
submerging in their agony

Did they really think their deeds
justified abysmal greed
ignoring all the human needs
A ploy of indulgence!

Insane with egomania
vampires from Transylvania
spiritual pyromania
ashes to ashes...

Obsessed with their morbidity
the morons of stupidity
caused nothing but sheer faggery
A lack of common sense!

Their madness turned to matricide
religious sort of cyanide
We salute your suicide:
Your kingdom crashes!

We are the flow, we are the ebb
We are the weavers, we are the web
We are the flow, we are the ebb
We are the witches back from the dead

We are the flow, we are the ebb
We are the weavers, we are the web
We are the flow, we are the ebb
We are the witches back from the dead
