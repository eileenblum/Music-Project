People who don't know their names
lurking behind window frames
Trying to control our lifes

Envy, spite and jealousy
of all those longing to be free
Stabbing them with hideous knives

Intolerance and arrogance
combined with bloody ignorance
Don't listen to a single word

Tired of their stupid lies
Trickery and alibis
Their issues are just too absurd

Don't you tell me not to grind
But I'm blinded by the thickness of mankind

I got a hole in my head
Seems like we're better off dead
We gotta find a solution
For this bitter contribution

Things are getting serious
small minds become delirious
Don't they see it's so insane

All obsessed with hate and war
what else they think's worth fighting for
Peek-A-Booh: A madman's game!

Pied piper's waiting at the door
to tell them they're superior
Dancing to his lethal tune

Oh, the crown of evolution
needs some kind of revolution
otherwise it's over soon

So you tell me not to blow my fuse
But I'm quite aware of your abuse

I got a hole in my head
Seems like we're better off dead
We gotta find a solution
For this bitter contribution

Find shelter in my arms tonight
There's only you and me
and everything's allright

If there's just one thing that's true
then it's my love for you
I'll never let you go

And I don't care what they say
As long as you stay
in our love's afterglow

Still you believe it'll work out fine
While heading for the ultimate deadline

I got a hole in my head
Seems like we're better off dead
We gotta find a solution
For this bitter contribution
