And still the seagulls fly
under a leaden sky
As if nothing had changed
and my life was still the same

No longer here with me
I watch the roaring sea
I think of times gone by
and how we used to laugh and cry

Now on my own again
A lonesome highway man
throwing stones against the waves of time
and cursing auld lang syne

But once the sun did shine
upon the mountain thyme
The wind caressed your hair
and there was magic everywhere

Then rain came falling down
and the red-painted town
lost its colour and went grey
the day you went away

Something inside
calls me tonight
out on these bare hills again
Something inside
Wish I could hide
from the pain

A lonely seagull flies
as sunset sets the skies
on fire but I don't care no more
since my love went sore

If I had wings to fly
I guess that I would try
flying faster than the speed of light
to leave all this behind

What have I become?
Now the broken one
running through the night
just tryin' to keep the flame alight

Oh, gaels come carry me
far across the sea
where the angels lie
amongst the placid fields of rye

Something inside
calls me tonight
out on these bare hills again
Something inside
Wish I could hide
from the pain

L'amore mia
sempre eÂ´ con te
Nostra eternitaÂ´
Lei ci guarderaÂ´

But once the sun did shine
upon the mountain thyme
The wind caressed your hair
and there was magic everywhere

Then rain came falling down
and the red-painted town
lost its colour and went grey
the day you went away

Something inside
calls me tonight
out on these bare hills again
Something inside
Wish I could hide
from the pain
