[Lyrics by Dragonfly]

Longing for the one
Who's gotta be out there somewhere
Far in Avalon
Where are you that for I dare?

Scratching at doors of hearts
Not even close to what I wish
Too many times torn apart
Like it's so womanish

Waiting for the one and only soulmate
A life of love to create
Thousands of years ago
You were made for me, you know

No damn understanding
Could you save me from this harm?
Sadness' so demanding
All my soul set on alarm

Running over quicksand
Followed by the evil-eyed
But no chance for wasteland
When our stars collide!

Waiting for the one and only soulmate
A life of love to create
Thousands of years ago
You were made for me, you know

Wasteland
Only one key to leave the wasteland
Wasteland
Only one key to leave the wasteland
