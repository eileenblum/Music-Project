So it was late that thursday night you were coming around
His words a thorn in your flesh, your head a merry-go-round
We were talking side by side about the things that come and done
and you began to realize that he was always on the run

In this black bedsit of yours, well it occured to me
that I've known you for years, not just momentarily
And when you said you were tired, and your eyes filled with tears
I looked straight into your heart but where do we go from here?

And as we were stepping out
After midnight
The silver lining of a cloud
Under starlight
For once again I felt alive
Will you stay with me tonight?

Tonight we're falling like the stars
When ever we fade, where ever we are
I spend my last flare up on you
Until these dreams of ours come true
Midnight burning blue....

From the shore the ice cold wind blew hard into my face
rain was beating down, the past beginning to unlace
Inside my soul it felt warm, though the night was wet and cold
And as the storm arose I dreamt of being with you so close

I didn't know what you would do but I believed your aim was true
from the look in your face - some kind of strange witches' brew
Waiting, anticipating your return
Our love feels so strong and in this fire we will burn

A butterfly, fragile and cold
The breath of love
His wings beginning to unfold
Came from above
This time I know it is for real
Let's touch the skies tonight!

Tonight we're falling like the stars
When ever we fade, where ever we are
I spend my last flare up on you
Until these dreams of ours come true
Midnight burning blue....

My Love, Angel and Light of my life
I will stay forever by your side
Come to me when nights are getting cold
I'll be there for you to hold and
Dive with me into the sea
Drown me in the water of love
Sail with me between the stars
And love me, love me, love me till the end...

And as we were stepping out
After midnight
The silver lining of a cloud
Under starlight
For once again I felt alive
Will you stay with me - eternally?

Tonight we're falling like the stars
When ever we fade, where ever we are
I spend my last flare up on you
Until these dreams of ours come true
Midnight burning blue....
