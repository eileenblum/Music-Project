You're still alive, but older
Now the nights are gettin' colder
The jukebox in the corner
still plays the same old song

You've had enough of cryin'
The game's up, love's been dying
Too many times you've tried
once more you're proven wrong

Observing all the rules
broken careless just by fools
but still love's so much more
than a transient caprice

Cause love's an endless flow
that leaves no afterglow
to the beauty of our life
far away where passion's rife
Come stay with me tonight
let us keep the flame alight
Till the morning goes to show
I'll never let you go...

She might come like a shower
or in the wee small hours
Just wait until you've seen
the final curtain fall

No, it's not an illusion
in spite of your confusion
your heart's still beatin' and
one day you'll hear the call

They're playing different games
simply interchanging names
But they will never find
what you bear in your mind

Cause love's an endless flow
that leaves no afterglow
to the beauty of our life
far away where passion's rife
Come stay with me tonight
let us keep the flame alight
Till the morning goes to show
Cause love's an endless flow
that leaves no afterglow
to the beauty of our life
far away where passion's rife
Come stay with me tonight
let us keep the flame alight
Till the morning goes to show
I'll never let you go
(I'll never never never let you go...)
