Just before the rain would fall
I know that we've said it all
We talked and talked
the hours were passing by
but then you went home

And by the river I sat
I was thinking of you
How could I know
that this time it's true?

You dance with the Moon and the Stars
We walk between Venus and Mars
I travel from midnight to noon
to be with you, my love, soon
We're creatures of a jade lagoon
We're creatures of a jade lagoon

And when I walked home that night alone
the wind whispering softly
our fate's still unknown
Under the streetlight I smelled your perfume
just for a second

Oh how I wished you could stay just for a while
to come up to my room and make me smile

You dance with the Moon and the Stars
We walk between Venus and Mars
I travel from midnight to noon
to be with you, my love, soon
We're creatures of a jade lagoon
We're creatures of a jade lagoon

And we danced
Kissed the sun and the moon
