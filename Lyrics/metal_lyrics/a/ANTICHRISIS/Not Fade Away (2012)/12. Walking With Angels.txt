Too many bad days
So many sad ways
This house was not a home
Trying not to surrender
Sometimes she remembers
How sheâs walking all alone

Classroom daydreaming
Words without meaning
Salad days just passing by
But a heart full of sorrow
Hopes for tomorrow
Itâs a case of do or die

Hiding inside
Preparing for fight
Now that she called a spade a spade
Detecting the lies with innocent eyes
Waiting for something in the night

Sheâs walking with Angels
Dancing in rainbows
Talking to the wind, the clouds and the rain
Sheâs fighting the demons
Waiting for nighttime
When the world around her lies quiet
Donât you ever walk away

These sides they were choosing
Were just too confusing
But her dreams they never died
One summer in Norway
She did it her way
Turned into a rider in the sky

Sit down here beside me
The way that it should be
I know it is not easy being free
But the rain will stop falling
And angels are calling
For you to fly across the sea

Pushing your barrow for too many years
So steep the path but still you tried to hide the tears
Youâve had enough of their truth turning into lies
You look through them with your all-detecting eyes
What if this town was built of ruins of the past?
What if these solid walls someday came down?
But now youâve found a way to turn things around
they didnât notice cause youâve left without a sound

Sheâs walking with Angels
Dancing in rainbows
Talking to the wind, the clouds and the rain
Sheâs fighting the demons
Waiting for nighttime
When the world around her lies quiet

No, sheâll never walk away
Forever she will stay
Itâs not easy being free
Talking with the wind, the clouds and the rain
