Somebody's walking the dog like before
The kids outside at the bus stop like in days of yore
A young guy's pulling the cigarette machine
Out there it's business as usual but here just died a dream

Somebody's ringing at the door
Love doesn't live here any more...

Oh, the fire went out
went out so long
Oh, the fire went out
went out so long
Oh, A long time a go
And I didn't know
Oh, A long time a go
And I didn't know

The rooms are empty and I'm on my own
reading your letter the third time turns my heart to stone
The wind's not sounding your chimes anymore
I left my keys on the sill cause I won't return no more

Goodbye my love, I'm leaving
It's gettin' cold in the evening

Oh, the fire went out
went out so long
Oh, the fire went out
went out so long
Oh, I never saw no cloud
Coming up along
So the fire went out
went out so long
Oh, A long time a go
And I didn't know
Oh, No afterglow
so much for our last show
Oh, A long time a go
And I didn't know
Oh, No afterglow
so much for our last show

I will come back
I will come back
I will come back no more

Was it all just lie?
Until we die?
Was it all just a lie?
An illusion divine?
Until we die?
Was it all just a lie? (Was it all just a lie? )
Until we die?
An illusion divine?
Kinda trick of the light?
Was it all just a lie? ( Until we die? )
An illusion divine?...
