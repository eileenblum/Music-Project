[brass, saxophone, piano and organ by Tilo Rockstroh]

Same old stories and the same old song
Iâve been living here for much too long
Small town small minds itâs all so bloody daunting
Sitting round with nothing to do
watching stupid movies chinese kung fu
Bruce Lee, Zombie Trash, forget your dream-hunting

Down on main street thereâs a danger sign
saying âCaution: Dead End Street lies just straight aheadâ
Bored teenagers meet each night at nine
getting soused, pale faces like theyâre back from the dead

Iâll be leaving on a night train
Yeah, thereâs gotta be a better place
Donât wanna be a basket case
No, oh noâ¦

Iâll be leaving on a night train
I donât care and I wonât turn around
Yeah, Iâm gonna break new ground
Hooray, Iâm northern bound

Out of this town right now
Leave on a night train now
Out of this town right now
Leave on a night train now

School work death â nothing else to do
just do the things they expect from you
but deep inside you know thereâs gotta be a better life
somewhere, someplace else
Snowâs falling and my bags are packed
Iâm gonna leave tonight, well thatâs a fact
Cause I ainât gonna wait til the best days of my life
have been washed out

And Iâm walking down main street for one last time
with its houses that look to me like a scene-of-crime
Iâll be trading this life for a real big time
but I donât know where Iâm gonna wake up at dawn

Iâll be leaving on a night train
Yeah, thereâs gotta a better place
Donât wanna be a basket case
No, oh noâ¦

Iâll be leaving on a night train
I donât care and I wonât turn around
Yeah, Iâm gonna break new ground
Hooray, Iâm northern bound

(Leave on a night train now)
Out of this town right now (Out of this town right now )
Leave on a night train now (Leave on a night train now )
Out of this town right now (Out of this town right now )
Leave on a night train now (Leave on a night train now )
Out of this town right now (Out of this town right now )
Leave on a night train now (Leave on a night train now )
Out of this town right now
(Leave on a night train... Leave on a night train now... )
