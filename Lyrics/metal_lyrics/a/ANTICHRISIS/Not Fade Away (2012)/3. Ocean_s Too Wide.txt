Sweet Magnolia
his things are scattered everywhere
Your prince charming
so bloody fine[?], so debonair
The telephone
it rings and rings but no one's there
I ran away
(I ran away
I ran away )

Once I promised you my love
but that was not enough
Tonight down by the street
He's waiting patiently
Wish I'd still love you but I don't
you turned my heart to stone
and though I hate to go
It's only tears you know

My ocean's too wide
You're drowning here tonight
we're floating in a darkness
where the cold begins to bite
There will be no tomorrow
no turning of the tide
a deep blue sea keeps calling
submerging open-eyed

She's calling me
her flowers washed down by the rain
"I'll wait for thee"
no sleep, no rest, no longer sane
but don't you feel
the loss, the pain: it's so inane
No longer mine
(No longer mine
No longer mine)

[Speech:]
My ocean's too wide
You're drowning here tonight
we're floating in a darkness
where the cold begins to bite
There will be no tomorrow
no turning of the tide
a deep blue sea keeps calling
submerging open-eyed

My ocean's too wide
We're drowning here tonight
we're floating in a darkness
where the cold begins to bite
There will be no tomorrow
no turning of the tide
a deep blue sea keeps calling
submerging open-eyed
