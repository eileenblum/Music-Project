Once I dreamt to be home again
even for just now and then
while the rain fell down
waiting for a ray of light
A cold windâs blowing night jessamine
and heather feels like your velvet skin
Youâre embodied in
the gale that reaches our shore

At eventide weâre getting to the core
I see the wilderness and storms in your eyes

And youâve changed my life
with your red-hot fire
youâre my adrenalin
Like a burning sky
you can take me higher
youâre my adrenalin
I see a brand new dawn
Yesterday is gone
Yes, Iâm remembering
And if the stars should fall
I wouldnât care at all
Youâre my adrenalin
(Youâre my adrenalin)

Your candle burns
in the deep dark night
Weâre walking through
the gardens of delight
while this world outside lies quiet
and the things we do feel oh so right
You touch my skin
make me shivering
breathe down your neck
raising trembling and
weâre entangled in lust
the wages of our sin

And weâre drowning
getting down, weâre burning bright
Weâre like two shining spirits in the night

And youâve changed my life
with your red-hot fire
youâre my adrenalin
Like a burning sky
you can take me high
youâre my adrenalin
I see a brand new dawn
Yesterday is gone
Yes, Iâm remembering
And if the stars should fall
I wouldnât care at all
Youâre my adrenalin
Youâre my adrenalin

And we take refuge
with the dawning of the day
and the morning sun shines in your eyes

Oh, youâve changed my life
with your red-hot fire
youâre my adrenalin
Like a burning sky
you can take me high
youâre my adrenalin
I see a brand new dawn
Yesterday is gone
Yes, Iâm remembering
And if the stars should fall
I wouldnât care at all
Youâre my adrenalin

Oh you changed my life
with your red-hot fire
youâre my adrenalin
Like a flaming sun
you got me on the run
youâre my adrenalin
We see a brand new dawn
days of yore have gone
Yes, weâre remembering
Till the end of time
youâre my perfect rhyme
Youâre my adrenalin
My adrenalin
