He waited all these years
Lived in dreams and fears
Hoping for a change that never comes
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Heâd seen nothing at all
An emptiness inside banged the drums

Like a snake shedding its skin
wondering what and where I've been
I was lost among some scriptures written in sand

Searching for the sun
Not knowing what heâd done
A roly-poly toy from pain to joy
A voice inside his head
the last words have been said
He set his sails but never found no Helen of Troy

The bonds that didnât last
turned into ghosts of christmas past
Until the day I woke up to myself again

Tell me, tell me who you are
Youâre only human
Not a superstar

Tell me, tell me who you are
No more running away from the way you are

Tell me, tell me who you are
Youâre only human
Not a superstar

You gotta tell me, tell me who you are
Outside - Inside
Inside - Outside
