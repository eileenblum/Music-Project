When the moon kissed the silent lake
The nightwind called us
A place too crowded, much too full and loud
We better leave now
I saw you standing in the lamplight forlorn
We gotta get away
Desolation is the price they'll pay
Now that we're on our own

They predicted our future but they
turned heaven into hell in no time
by giving us the heebie-jeebies
while they're driving with full headlight

Here comes the night (for running away)
We won't get another chance (for running away)
It's too late to hide (for running away)
Everybody's on the run (out of our way)
Warning Sign - fading into the night

Children starving in their mother's arms
while the disciples pray
in the church of economic growth
But now their god is dead
Cars are crashing, people screaming blue murder
leaders go insane
The light of hope now a black hole sun
A flashing ray that burns

All we have is each other, baby
We hold and kiss as the rain falls down
Smile for me one last time, my darling
You will meet me on the other side

Here comes the night (for running away)
We won't get another chance (for running away)
It's too late to hide (for running away)
Everybody's on the run (out of our way)
Warning Sign - fading into the night

Here comes the night (for running away)
We won't get another chance (for running away)
It's too late to hide (for running away)
Everybody's on the run (out of our way)
Here comes the night (for running away)
We won't get another chance (for running away)
It's too late to hide (for running away)
Everybody's on the run (out of our way)
Warning Sign - fading into the night
