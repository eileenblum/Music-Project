As Iâm walking down yesterdayâs lane
past the houses and homes of my life
deserted and empty no lights
in the windows at night itâs all quiet

Iâve been searching in all of these rooms
rattling at closed doors and cryinâ
but those years have been fading in time
like a book thatâs been never read twice

Goddamn I havenât seen before
call me stupid, call me blind
a prospect of what might have been
unnervingly entering my mind
Listening to Bruce all night long
as heâs driving away in a stolen car
down the road
ride by night
down the highways and byways of time

Strange but I seem to be back again
from these restless years
It may comes as a surprise
but Iâm still here
Different than I thought I am
no more prey to blind fear
Iâm back again
from being departed, my friend
(He's back again)

Wondering why everyone just walked away
left all fucked up and one fine day
acting in very strange ways
I couldnât find the right words to say

But now I see part of it was my fault
each romance coming to a grinding halt
when you lose yourself in someone else
instead of cutting your own path, my friend

Rewrite the story of my life
Forgive and forget if you can
No more dyinâ for you under your balcony blue
been there, done that too many times
Yes, I can live on top of the mountain
Itâs not forsaken at all
there with you
Me and you
Yes weâve opened the door to a new world

Strange but I seem to be back again
from these restless years
It may comes as a surprise
but Iâm still here
Different than I thought I am
no more prey to blind fear
Iâm back again
from being departed, my friend
(He's back again)

Strange but I seem to be back again
from these restless years
It may comes as a surprise
but Iâm still here
Different than I thought I am
no more prey to blind fear
Iâm back again
(He's back again)

Strange but I seem to be back again
from these restless years
Sure it comes as a surprise
Stay here, stay near
Stronger than I thought I am
forget about the tears
Iâm back again no more being departed, my friend
