Like the lark in the morning breeze you fly
with the clouds in the sky
Like the waves rolling in on the shore
from days of yore
You walk amongst stars that are shining
like the light in your eyes
Crowned by sundown
and dressed in the light of the moon

Glittering rainbows
A warmth like the scent of the trees
your song that travels through time
comes like spring rain to me

Your brown eyes they shine
When you smile at me
Your brown eyes they shine
with all the love that I see

All the trials of the past
all the hurt you went through
Made yourself only stronger
Now look at you!

Your silhouette revealing itself
sets heavens afire
The wind keeps caressing your hair
as we're leaving the fair
When nightfall is turning our world
in a void out of sight
You'll be chasing the last rays of light
with your heart opened wide

You're walking this earth
with a passion so fervently
Enchanting my heart and my soul
you're a mystery to me

Your brown eyes they shine
When you smile at me
Your brown eyes they shine
with all the love that I see

See your beauty unequaled
A fire I desire
You're everything to me
My love, my life and my light

Your brown eyes they shine
When you smile at me
Your brown eyes they shine
with all the love that I see

Your brown eyes they shine
When you smile at me
Your brown eyes shine
with all the love that I see

Oh, how they shine
Oh, they shine...
