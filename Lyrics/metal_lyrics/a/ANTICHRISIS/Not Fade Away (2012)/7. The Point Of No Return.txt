Up on the balcony
I watched you walk away but I couldnât see
That this parting kiss was forever
Oh come back to me
Yet another summer without you
Soon fall will be there
But comes winter I guess Iâll be over in Cornwall somewhere

I try walking in our footsteps
These days passing in a time lapse
I went through anger, hate and frustration
searching for some kind of revocation
We couldnât fail?
How did it happen?
For a dare?
Everythingâs shattered
Darkness embrace me
Iâm misplaced here
This is the wrong score
Stranded on a strange shore

The way we were
Our hearts were beating together til something occured
Now youâre up there somewhere in Scotland
Iâm left in midair
Guess Iâm waiting for your return eternally
But comes the end of December
Let it rain down on me

What have we found?
Just a rebound
Was it worth the price we paid?
What have we gained after these strains?
Remember Penzance Promenade?
Whatâs the truth?
The importance of whoâs right or wrong
I donât care
We've been fooling around for too long
Much too long, my Love

The point of no return on our way home

Each day my heart is gettinâ colder
The burdenâs heavy on my shoulder
Over and over I see the same scene
Trapped in a nightmare not just a bad dream
Couldnât run coz I was petrified
Tried to swallow my foolish pride
Cities lost forever so it seems
Missing you so much it makes me wanna scream

Last night I had a dream
Me flying high above the sea in the sky
With my arms wide open dazzling clouds passing by
And the mermaidsâ song guiding me on my way
To the coastline with its white cliffs of chalk and clay

Iâm trying hard to keep my eyes shut
The things I see they are not clear-cut
Tryin' to get you out of my mind
Fuck off, you left me behind
This time thereâll be no substitution
Just like with former dissolutions
Occupying my heart
Now pack your things and run
Because everything's said and done

A saturday back in September
The golden sunlight in your eyes
This day I always will remember
You were the fairest of all brides

(Come to me across the sea)

The sun has gone,
Weâre on our own
Our paradise a fragile dream
A void is calling and Iâm falling
Into timeâs adamant stream
Called your name into the night but youâre gone
All forgone
Not a flame will arise from the embers at dawn
No more dawn, my Love

The point of no return on our way home

(Come to me across the sea)
