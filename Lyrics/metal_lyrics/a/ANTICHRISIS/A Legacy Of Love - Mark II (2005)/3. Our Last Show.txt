And the rear lights of your car
Behind the trees they fade away
Walking inside somnambular
There goes a lovelorn castaway

Does it always have to be like this?
I'll never know
Was it something that I said?
You said: "I gotta go..."
While leaving me back here
With my memories and my tears
You won't reappear

No fire in the lighthouse
To guide me tonight
Don't know if our planet's razed
Torn apart by love's meteorite
I know I will lose you
How can I face another daylight?

And I know
This could ring down the curtain to our last show
No second chance for Juliet and her Romeo
No applause, no ovations, no bravissimo
Please don't go!

Staring at the telephone
Wondering if I'd try
I never knew that nights could be that long
And still I hear your last goodbye

Strange people on the screen
They try to make me laugh
But everywhere I see your face and the photograph
On the wall says that you're gone
And I'm waiting for the sun
Keep dreaming on...

No fire in the lighthouse
To guide me tonight
Don't know if our planet's razed
Torn apart by love's meteorite
I know I will lose you
How can I face another daylight?

And I know
This could ring down the curtain to our last show
No second chance for Juliet and her Romeo
No applause, no ovations, no bravissimo
Please don't go!
