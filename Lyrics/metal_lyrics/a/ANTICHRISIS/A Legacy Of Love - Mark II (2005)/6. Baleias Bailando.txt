By the ocean I sat down one day
Saw my life the other way
All those trials to no avail
Broken dreams was all I bloody gained

Remember well when I was a child
They promised me a paradise
But promises turned into lies
leaving us a world demise!

Hold me in your arms
Drown me in sweet moisture
Lascivious fiery breath covering....
Your fangs softly penetrate
the pleasure and the pain
Dissolving I discern:
I'm not dead!

I asked for love, got a golden cage
Plastic emotions in a plastic age
The pain I felt they told me wasn't real
"The Earth!", I cried: My last appeal!

Now it's my turn to realize
To change the road, to change the side
The past has gone, may it rest in peace
A new dawn fades as She sows the seed

Hold me in your arms
Drown me in sweet moisture
Lascivious fiery breath overflow....
Your fangs softly penetrate
the pleasure and the pain
Dissolving I discern:
I'm alive!

A midnight's dream disclosure
saw momentous desire
My life laid in your hands,
My confidence....
The background of reality
just one step away
Am I to cross the frontier?
Am I to dare?

In dreams I died a thousand times
But then one dream: A golden shrine
Her whispered words did soothe my grief
What a candour in this world of thieves
I hear the call of the roaring sea
Still a fire's burning inside of me
The wind shall take me to another shore
The Earth I am, for evermore!

Way down, carry me down to the ocean of love!

Alone again I stand
amongst the debris of a dream
having to face once more
the madness of love
But I know that the Goddess
will hear my yearning call
and her enchanting song
will make my heart dance
