Farewell, pretty one: It's all over now you've gone
After all that we went through, you left me when I needed you
The times we shared, the good and bad,
were the best I've ever had, the best years of my life....

Farewell, pretty one: I've put all my faith in you
and I can't understand: Did you lie on that night
you said you'd never let me go?
Oh, I believed each word you've said
I believed until the end
It's so hard to realize you never wanted me that close by your side

And the snow falls back in time
down the hillside on our sledge we'd ride
We were laughing in the January sun
And for a moment time stood still as we rode on and on and on....

Still the snow falls on Yule-tide
falls forever on that dreary mountainside
And the ghost of our love stands right above: A monument of your smile
And our laughter that died so long ago lingers on and on and on...

Never will I forget our last winter
Never will I forget the last winter of our love!

Goodbye, pretty one: You broke my heart twice, now I'm done!
You left me like a dream at the break of dawn
and I almost died
And even if you're lying now in someone else's arms
I'm still with you in a dream,
in dreams of days gone by, the best days of my life
Goodnight, my love, goodnight....

For we were dancing in the midnight sun
our love became too wild
I loved you like a child
The fire went out, went out before dawn
and I broke down and cried
and I drowned and died
