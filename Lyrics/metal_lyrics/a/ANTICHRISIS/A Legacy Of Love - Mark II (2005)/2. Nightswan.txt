Linger on, oh waning moon
This midnight hour has come much too soon
By the crystal lake we stand
With our names in the sand

Believe me, my Love
I will wait for you
And I will return
If you still want me, too

With the song of the nightswan
And I'll be in heaven

The lark heralds the break of day
No longer by my side can you stay
In shrouded mists you disappear
Like a ghost bayadere

Where are you, my Love?
I'm calling your name
This spell can be broke
Love's ignited the flame

Like the song of the nightswan
And I'll be in heaven

Oh, believe me, my Love
I will stand, laying siege to this fortress of time
With the glory of you in my heart
Charge before the sun touches the rime

The Beltane fires upon the hill
Your hand in mine by the old water-mill
Fairies sing our wedding song
Now the moon lingers on

Stay with me, my Love
My Angel, my Life
We walked this dark maze
So now we will fly

On the wings of the nightswan
And we'll be in heaven
