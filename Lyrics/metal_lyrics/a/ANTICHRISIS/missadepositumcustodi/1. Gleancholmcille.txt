There's a light in the darkness
Oh, tomorrow
And the wheel keeps turning in the skies
Never close your eyes before tomorrow
A new life, a new love will find its way

So hold on, child, to what you've got:
To your dreams, your visions and your heart
Hold on, child, and wait until dawn
Because tomorrow is the seed of a new life

There's a light in the darkness
Oh, tomorrow
And the wheel of fortune's turning round
Never close your eyes before tomorrow
Because the fire of love is still alight

So hold on, child, to what you've got:
To your dreams, your visions and your heart
Hold on, child, and wait until dawn
Because tomorrow sees the end of your night
