By the ocean I sat down one day
Saw my life the other way
All those trials to no avail
Broken dreams was all I bloody gained

Remember well when I was a child
They promises turned into lies
Leaving us a world dimise!

Hold me in your arms
Drown me in sweet moisture
Lascivious fiery breath covering overflow
Your fangs softly penetrate
the pleasure and the pain
Dissolving I discern:
I'm alive!

I asked for love, got a golden cage
Plastic emotions in a plastic age
The pain I felt they told me wasn't real
"The Earth!", I cried: My last appeal!

Now it's my turn to realize
To change the road, to change the side
The past has gone, may it rest in peace
A new dawn fades as She sows the seed

Hold me in your arms...

A midnight's dream disclosure
saw momentous desire
My life layed in your hands,
My confidence...
The background of reality
just one step away
Am I to cross the frontier?
Am I to dare?

In dreams I died a thousand times
But then one dream: A golden shrine
Her whispered words did soothe my grief
What a candour in this world of thieves

I hear the call of the roaring sea
Still a fire's burning inside of me
The wind shall take me to another shore
The Earth I am, for evermore!

Way down, carry me down to the ocean of love!

Alone again I stand
amongst the debris of a dream
having to face once more
the madness of love
But I know tha the Goddess
will hear my yearning call
and her enchanting song
will make my heart dance
