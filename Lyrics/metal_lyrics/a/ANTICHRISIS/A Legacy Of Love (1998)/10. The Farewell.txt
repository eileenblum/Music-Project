I wanted to live on top of a mountain
but it's cold and forsaken there without you now

I wanted to dive into the ocean of love
but I got shipwrecked on the shores of broken dreams

For you I sang songs of the nightswan
and each line I wrote was a beat of my heart

Forever burning on love's funeral pyre:
Stop beating now, my bleeding heart!
For this knife did cut too deep
so for the last time I'm trying not to breathe

Once there was a fire in the lighthouse of my heart:
I gave you so much more than just my love
and you broke so much more than just a promise

Our planet vanished so devastatingly
amongst the mists of time
There was no treasure to be found at Rainbow's End
somewhere behind Andromeda

I've been waiting till the end of december
but no more will I ride
for the winter solstice's child
will pass away silently on a midsummer's night

So may you come now, my Dead Romantic Angel
serenade Kyrahnean Hymns to me
Hold me in your arms
cover me with elder flowers
and take me down to my beloved sea

I'm so tired, so tremendously tired
Please wait for me  under the midgnight sun
where I will sing and dance again
and my laughter will be heard
echoing down the hillside again...

Oh, how I tried to believe how I loved,
How I tried to hold on to my dream;
How I wanted to live - but now I'm going home
to a place where love is more
than just a four-letter word
and as I kiss the memory of your goodnight
I'm beginning to see the light...
