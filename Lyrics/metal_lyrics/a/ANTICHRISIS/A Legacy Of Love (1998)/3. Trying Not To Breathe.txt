Oh, this void inside tears my soul apart
Why did you lie? I lost my faith in you!
Once there was purity but now only perfidy and pain
because you've been untrue!
You broke al promises and now our love is bound to die
and so am I - I die!

Lost forever within the debris of my dreams
I put my trust in you!
How could you leave me in a lurch after all
that I've gone through
What the hell did you do?
Down on my knees I pray:
Save me, save me, save my, please!
but no hope anymore - I die!

I'm trying now to breathe!
I can't stand this anymore therefore I'll leave
I'm trying not to breathe!
And so I'll leave this world behind
broken by faithlessness of the killng kind
I'm trying not to breathe!

Remember when you called my name?
I've been always there for you!
To me it's more than just a game
I loved you too much, and still I do!

Now your body so close to mine
I kiss your lips goodbye
To lie in your arms for a last time
before I die!

And he dreams of days gone by
floating down to the other side
A thousand Angels cry
firing squad against the walls of light

Not again another day
Now his love has lost the last stand
Oh Angels, hear him pray
As he's passing away into her hands!

I'm trying not to breathe!
I can't stand your loss, your lies:
therefore I'll leave
I'm trying not to breathe!
And so I try leave the pain behind
of treason that became the killing kind
I'm trying not to breathe!

But you swore you'd love me forever
and it was only yesterday
What have I done to deserve this
Am I destiny's fool?
And I hate you,
and I love you for what you've done to me
Oh shit, why did you leave me in such despair?

I'm trying not to breathe
though I try so hard to reach the other
I'm trying not to breathe
No more songs for me to sing because you leave
Now I think I see the light: Goodbye, my love!
Oh, I'm trying not to breathe
