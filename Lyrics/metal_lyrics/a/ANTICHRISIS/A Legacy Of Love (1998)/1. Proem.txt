And as I walked through the garden of love.
I passed the gates of paradise and the gates
of perdition. Maybe the saddest experience
of all is that even the most wonderful and
precious moments don't last forever and
appear like a dream that faded much too
soon when looking back.

But both darkness and light are given to us
to make us prospect and grow: like every living
being needs the interplay of daylight's sweet
kiss and night's gentle embrace. And as
darkness falls while I'm drifting away on
the river of sadness, the remembrance of love's
golden sunlight is my only supply of logs for
the cold and lonely winter of the soul.

This album is a tribute to a love that was so
beautiful as long as it lasted and so bitter
when it ended: hence both love's heavenly
bliss as well as bereavement's abysmal
despair are to be found amongst these 10
songs; songs that are like sears to me now...

But still the dream remains, and yet my love
has not withered nor have my songs faded
away: Though Moonshadow died in the devastation
of declining Planet Kyrah. Sid survived -
but for how much longer?

Goodnight - and may the Goddess bless you all!

SID

"When I'm dead, my Dearest,
sing no sad songs for me,
plant thou no roses at my head,
nor shady cypress tree:
Be the green grass above me
with showers and dewdrops wet;
and if thou wilt, remember,
and if thou wilt, forget."

[Christina Rosetti (1830-1894)]
