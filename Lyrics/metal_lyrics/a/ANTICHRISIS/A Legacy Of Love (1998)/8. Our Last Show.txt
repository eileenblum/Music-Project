And the rear lights of your car behind the
trees they fade away
walking inside somnambular there goes a
lovelorn castaway
Does it always have to be like this? I'll never know...
Was it something that I said?
You said: "I gotta go..."
While leaving me back here
with my memories and my tears
You won't reappear!

Staring at the telephone
Wondering if i'd try?
I never knew that nights
could be that long
And sill I hear your last good-bye
Strange people on the screen,
they try to make me laugh
But everywhere I see your face
and the photograph on the wall
says the you're gone
And I'm waiting for the sun
keep dreaming on...

No fire in the lighthouse
to guide me tonight
Don't know if our planet's razed
torn apart by love's meteorite
I know I will lose you
How can I face another daylight?

And I know this could ring down the curtain
to our last show
No second chance for Juliet and her Romeo
No applause, no ovations, no bravissimo
Please don't go.
