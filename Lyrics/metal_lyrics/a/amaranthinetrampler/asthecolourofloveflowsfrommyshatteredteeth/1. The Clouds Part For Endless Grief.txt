After the rain has gone and the clouds part
The first rays of light mark a fresh start
But I miss the gloom, and the dark solitude
In my blacked-out room, I brood
The sky is crying it's heart out
Endless skies, endless grief
The clouds paint pictures in grey
Great displeasures art mine
Oh, black beauty, tear off my ears
Your incessant boom brings forth memories
