Three foot hole in my heart
I stand at the gate of an unmarked tomb
Infanticidal dorsal wishes
Amputate myself from everything rapturous
The mirage of affections weave in my mind
A long deep slice as a celebration of life
I remove my organs but I still crave the taste of bittersweet epidermis
Semi-self-imposed suffering
The misery and desolation of my paradox reality
