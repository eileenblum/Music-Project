Pass the fallen tapestries, like many before
Navigate the ruins of a fallen world
Break bread with those who broke you
Seek beauty in whores
The land you seek is far from here
Just follow the path
Pass the fallen victims of destinies past
In silent romanticism
Trample the daisies
Leave your nameless mark
The land you seek is far from here
Just follow the path
Everyone you've loved are corpses under the grass
Everything you've known is water under the bridge
Onward evermore...
