Rage and scream the name with strength whom embody my blood
Scream with hate my name!
Enrage the masses who struggle for my existence, I'm the shadow behind the door, I breathe in your face at night,
Tormenting your dreams

And creating your worries, flesh is what I need,
Putrid blood is what I have in my hands,
Using your skin to cover my darkness, y darkness the fear is what I need to create in your life
I rip your skin crossing your bones and eat your entrails!
Satisfy my hunger absorbing your life,
But I'll do it calmly

And I take my time doing with time to feel you suffer
Suffering

Bring me to life,
Call on my being and be a sacrifice, listen the sound from the bell
And realize you are alone

Coward just say my name
I AM FEAR
I'm your nightmare and I'm by your side
Many describe me as a sadistic
I'm a Monster, I'm a butcher
I AM FEAR
