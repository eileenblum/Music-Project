Entrails I'm hungry for them,
Come to death and open your eyes
Look to the future of your nation,
Devastation and kingdom of putrefaction
Purge your rage and I will turn in fear,
You're in front of the King of the humanity
I'm your voice in your mind,
I'm your soul you belong to me

Come to death and open your eyes
Look to the future of your nation,
Devastation and kingdom of putrefaction, purge your rage

I'm soaking in an ocean full of shit, blood and hate

I need to cover you in my poison
I need to feed my hunger with your progenitors
We need your women to create my kingdom, you realize the pact

You invoked me now I need everything from you.

I will turn in fear, you're in front of the King of the humanity
I'm your voice in your mind, I'm your soul you belong to me

Come to death and open your eyes
Look to the future of your nation,
Devastation and kingdom of putrefaction, purge your rage fear.

I need to get in to this world of shit, where they believed in a good based in a picture

Putrid essence
I'm come for them, come to death
