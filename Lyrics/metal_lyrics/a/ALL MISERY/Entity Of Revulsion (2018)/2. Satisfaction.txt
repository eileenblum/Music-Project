Dust, is what I need to incarnated as a human
And to take power of the species I've grown for so long.

Wars torture, abomination, hate
Is what prevail on this planet, turn

On the light that increases your fear of me
You've killed, you've eaten alive creatures
The world is so putrid, the vomit of the universe
Hunter of planets
They call me

I'm your god but I'm more than that, I'm the only one,
Do you hear that? That's the symphony of horror,
Fucking scum I will eat your fucking organs

I will keep you alive and rip off your skin,
Your pain will be my satisfaction, I can't wait
Until the night to stare at you from above your bed

You are fucked up with no way out
Fucking piece of shit
Fucking piece of shit
I hate humanity I'm the master mind behind your cruelty.
