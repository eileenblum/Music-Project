Listen I come to rescue from the filth of this world, I belong to an alternate universe
The chaos is a virtue and it's a pleasure to rip up

We respect our place as species, call me a monster or a demon if you want to
I'm not a number, I'm a energy, I'm not one more of a planet, I'm one more of this universe
Flames and flesh is what you will find, is what you will find
Miserly man are decapitated
We use his bodies to fornication and procreate

His flesh we help us to our species to feed our revulsion I curse your population
I need to hide in the shadows and wait by the night to torture your dreams
While I'm here stuck, get on your knees motherfucker cause l will empty my heart is a fun playing with the body of an innocent child

All right mother fuckers my nails need's rip the flesh of the bones

In your near fucking death! No matter where you are I will always find you

I will bring you the mother fucking death! No matter where you are I will always find you
I will bring you the mother fucking death! No matter where you are I will always find you

The desire of torment you, to play with your lack of common sense
Is as fun playing with the cartilage of an innocent child
Break your hopes.
Miserly man are decapitated
We use his bodies to fornication and procreate

His flesh we help us to our species to feed our revulsion I curse your population
I need to hide in the shadows and wait by the night to torture your dreams
While I'm here stuck, get on your knees motherfucker cause l will empty my heart is a fun playing with the body of an innocent child

I will bring you the mother fucking death! No matter where you are I will always find you
I will bring you the mother fucking death! No matter where you are I will always find you
