Sexual vomit of treachery, ambitious gastric juice, the power of your greed, your grudge keeps me a live, ready to feed me

Bathed in her own orgasm, god damn it you are my own ally and you ignore it it's not a nightmare, it's a revelation open your mind

Your spirit and leave those paper pieces and look at the space, know the reality, know the truth, I'm not something non-existent

Able to hide in the dark to help making better, to dark side, evil abounds on your planet, the belief is something that keeps them standing, like soldiers from a war to the fucking hell awaiting to break free and enter the doors of heaven, my friend, I am the fucking truth

I'm dominate the minds from the leaders, there will be no mercy.

There will be no mercy.

Bow down for me like your ancestors did.
