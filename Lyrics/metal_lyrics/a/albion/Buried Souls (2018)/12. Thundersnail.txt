A streak of lightning is shooting 'cross the ground
Aerodynamic shell that's built to last
All other mollusc racers shaking at the sound
Keep pushing that button, but not too fast

Competitors are left watching its trail
Its training diet's mostly fruit and kale
Thundersnail
Thundersnail

Race after race we're right behind it, screaming high
Drowned out by that weird xylophonic noise
Its fans are fascinated by its secret life
They don't even know if it's a girl or boy

It's on a winning streak, and it's on fire
Not literally though, that would be dire
Just three inches from head down to its tail
Sincere apologies to Mark Reale
Thundersnail Thundersnail
Thundersnail Thundersnail
