Down below the city
Where the light is cold and dim
Creatures without name
Are paying for the sin
Not dead nor alive
In a dark and toxic reign
Amalgamated nightmares
That failed to reach the aim

Damned to walk the night
Access to the world above denied
Lost without a cure
But as long as we are standing
I'll endure

On that very day
God has turned away
Even though I pray
Hear my words

Heal me
Heal my scars
I'm longing for peace
Heal me
Heal my pain
Let me walk the daylight again

She challenged mortal nature
In the hope to reveal
Determination's power
And the force of life to steal
Transformed and fused together
The disfigured subjects crawl
Locked deep beneath the underground
Within the true lab's walls

Locked up in the night
With access to the light above denied
Can't you hear my cry
When you sleep or die
Longing for salvation
Set us free

Heal me
Heal my scars
I'm longing for peace
Heal me
Heal my pain
And let me walk the daylight again

On that very day
God has turned away
Even though I pray
Hear my words

Heal me
Heal my scars
I'm longing for peace
Heal me
Heal my pain
And let me walk the daylight again
Heal me
Heal my pain
And let me walk the daylight again
