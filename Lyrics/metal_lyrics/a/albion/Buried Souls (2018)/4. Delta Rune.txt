Years ago
In forced retreat
We braved the ice and searing heat
'Til we came to the place we now call home

Here below
Away from light
We suffer in eternal night
But we wait for the sign to bring us home

In these halls beneath the earth
We will struggle on and wait for the angel
Signs delivering our fate
When they descend on holy wings

And we live and die under skies of stone
The ruins on to the king's new home
To redeem us all and restore our lives
The prophecy decides
Delta rune

Years went past
Our sadness grew
We saw another meaning, too
That the angel could bring our final day

Living on
With no reply
We're withered by the march of time
And we turn into dust and fade away

In these halls beneath the earth...

And we live and die under skies of stone
The ruins on to the king's new home
To erase the world and to take our lives
The prophecy decides
Delta rune

The one who's seen the surface
Will reappear again
The underground will empty
Silence will remain
Angel of death or justice
Descending down from earth
To free us from our torment
Or from this mortal realm

Live and die under skies of stone
The ruins on to the king's new home
To redeem us all or to take our lives
The prophecy decides
In the end, the toll of the bell will sound
The final flight from the underground
To redeem us all or to take our lives
The prophecy decides
Delta rune

An angel of death or light
To end our eternal night
Rain fire into our tomb
The word of the delta rune
