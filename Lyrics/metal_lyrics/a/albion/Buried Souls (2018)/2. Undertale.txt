Once upon a time
When magic was alive
There were two noble races
That ruled over earth
Coexisting with unease
Divided but at peace
Lay the kingdom of monsters
And kingdom of men

But the humans feared for their own frailty
The power of monsters with a human soul
Their attack was sudden and merciless
Without warning or control - no

Without a single death
The final force was sent
Seven masters of magic
To seal them away
With surrender made at last
The barrier was cast
And the humans rejoiced
For the dawn of the day

When the world they fought
Was gone and buried
The mountain sealing
All their shame away
And as time went past
Human life outlasted
The memory of the war

Our history evolved into legend
The legend evolved into myth
All that was left was the story
Of the monsters
Who once shared the earth
The souls that are
Drawn to the mountain
Climb up there and never return
But one human soul stays
Determined without end

In this world your soul is powerful
As the heart of life or death
Through love and hate
Deciding fate
A power beyond belief
Sing the legend of the undertale
And the child who fell from earth
The mountain and the tale that lies beneath

We were buried
And forgotten
So many lives ago
Climb the mountain
That entraps us
And we'll see the sky once more

They have buried
Not just monsters
But lives and hearts as well
When our time comes
We will take their souls
And make our return

Sing once again
Of the war between monsters and men
Keep belief within your heart
And hold on to your soul

In this world your soul is powerful...
The tale of the hidden hearts
Shining in darkness
Buried souls
The tale that lies beneath
