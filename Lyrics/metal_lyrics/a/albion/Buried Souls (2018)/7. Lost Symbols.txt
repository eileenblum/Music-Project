A monument shining in dusk
Mechanical wonder in neon and steel
A fountain of energy, magic and light
Where silent I disappeared

Beware the broken man
Who speaks in cryptic hands
To those who stare into the code
And understand the signs
The fragments of his soul
Are scattered throughout time
Shining through the fractures left behind

Lost symbols in the underground
They're waiting for those
Who would dare to discover
Lost mysteries that can't be found
Disguise a soul now exchanged for another
Scattered in the threads of time
Torn apart yet still alive
Watching you and speaking through
The symbols left behind

Roll the dice and you'll see the signs
Disappearing souls you almost recognize
As you approach
The missing words you'll hear

Sixty-six is the key to me
So come and open up
The door that few can see
For just a second the fragments show me
Then I disappear

Beware the broken man...

Lost symbols in the underground...

Timelines shifting
Twining, twisting
Ending just to start again
Sins undone
Determination
Saved in time, transcending death

Lost symbols in the underground...
