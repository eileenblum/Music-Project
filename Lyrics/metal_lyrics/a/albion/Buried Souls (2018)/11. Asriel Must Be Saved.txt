[I. Reunion]

[Asriel:]
Here we are
He fell to this place
The human who started
This tale of the cave
Now here I stand
And I will remain
Preventing their heartbreak
All over again

So go now and leave me behind
You reached through the darkness to find

The tale
Concealed by the facade
The story told at last
The truth of it all

All the souls of the mountain
Left from the night
But still you refused to go
You appeared to me here
In the glow of the light
From flowers that caught my soul

[Frisk:]
I followed his heart through the caves
To learn the words of the tale still untold
He fought back the first child who fell
And he learned you'll kill or be killed

But now I see his face
His living form
His true self revealed once again
It hurts
Still even though I know
A child without a soul
Can never be saved

The prince of the underground
Turned me away
And left me no choice but to go
An innocent soul who
Accepted his fate
To vanish in time

But I can't let him fade
Give him up and obey
Release this trace of his soul
Though the tale's at its end
I must walk the path again
It's not enough to save the world

[II. Salvation]

Time has come
The end of darkness
Rising from the underground
War averted, light restored
By the angel of salvation
Now - as I watch
The souls emerging
Climbing back to life again
I remain determined still
That I'll find the chance to save him

Still every timeline
I could see or comprehend
Led me the same way
And to here I would return
But there's no way
That I can let this be the end
It's not enough to save the world

Lost in the night
But still he survives
I'll tear apart time
So his heart never dies
As they cast off their chains
Just one soul remains
Asriel must be saved

Walk against the streams of time
And try to find some other way
Made my choice to start things over
Rending worlds, shattering timelines
Break apart the happy ending
Start the cycle once again
Every path will fade away
But the one that's laid before us

Still every timeline...
Lost in the night...

There is a power
Human hearts hold deep inside
I felt it when I fought him
And my soul refused to die
The will to keep living
The resolve to change fate
The strength to survive
Determination

I will find the final soul
If it takes a million tries
I'll keep on coming back
Exploring the fractures in time
Make my choice, reset the world
Discard the freedom I had earned
To find true endings for us all
For us all

Still every timeline...
It's not enough
It's not enough to save the world
No!

[III. Trepidation]

I've kept them trapped
Inside the cycle kept unseen
I'm losing count of times
I've pushed away their dreams
And as I hesitate
They start to realize
I feel them watching
Accusation in their eyes

As images bleed over timelines
Their hearts plead to stop my pursuit
Accept living on in the light
But I refuse

'Cause in the twilight
I see the cavern where he fell
And I'm determined
To find an ending for us all

Here on the surface
They have the ending that they all deserve
Can my conscience let me walk it back
And steal the sun again

And the buried souls draw me back before
Through the underground I will walk once more
And the dust of time rises up again
Choices realign and the tale begins

Can one last life stolen by golden flowers
Finally return to the light
And his soul emerge on the surface
With us all
With the buried souls

[IV. Determination]

I woke too late to change the course
Of his life and final fate
Need to break through time
Before the cave where I always wake
Draw the power that haunts these halls
Where the broken man once fell
Trust my soul to time
And finally rewrite the tale

Turn the timeline back still further
Take the place of the first child to fall
Every repetition makes me stronger
I will fuel my obsession and follow the call
Break the rules of the timeline and rescue them all

I feel determination
Beating in my soul
Through the impossible
I'll try to break once more
The tale is over
Yet the pages turn again
It's not enough to save the world

Lost in the night...
The prince of the monsters
Remember his name

I won't let time turn
While his soul still burns
Asriel must be saved
