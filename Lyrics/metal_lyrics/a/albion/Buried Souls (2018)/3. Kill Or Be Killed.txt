Child of the kingdom
Prince of the monsters
Raised with the fallen human

Victim of malice
Killed by deception
Walked a false path to freedom

Waking reborn as a flower
Trapped unmoving in the ground
All alone
And he cried out to the darkness
For a sympathetic soul
But nobody came

Brought back to life
But robbed of emotion
Feeling no love
For the ones he once knew

Missing a soul
But strong and determined
He found eternal life

Now he's here
Exploring every timeline
Walking every path
He kills for curiosity

Restoring and repeating
Driven by a force
The child who stole his soul

Kill or be killed
The law of the underground
Fear or be feared
The choice is on you
Kill or be killed
The memories misguiding your soul
With flowers of gold
You'll kill or be killed

Throughout the underground he hides
And in the corner of your eye
You'll see his twisted smile
Hear whispers in your mind
Together you could end it all
Repeat the other human's fall
Another tale from down below
Another flower takes your soul

Determination takes a hold of you
And now the world's no longer
His to command
Through every timeline
Every universe
He's seen it all
Knows how this story must end

Kill or be killed...

Turn them to dust once again
Here there's no trust in a friend
The memories misguiding your soul
With flowers of gold
You'll kill or be killed
