Humans live without
Compassion, love or hope
They'll never know the magic
Buried in our souls
There's weakness in their strength
Their souls' persistence after death
A power we can take from those
Who tread within our home

Without sight of the angel we're lost
We waste in the dark and then crumble to dust
In desperate hope, we all look to the king
To break down the walls from within

Seven human souls
Seven hearts to break against the wall
Force of those who fell
To fuse and free us all

From the underground
We'll rise again
To break down the barrier
And pay back their pain
Finally end these years untold
Return to the light
With seven human souls

Thousands of years ago
We wished upon the stars
They stole the sky from us
And left us in the dark
And we will not forget
We'll strike them down without regret
With seven souls in hand
We will retake what should be ours

Seven human souls...

From the underground...

Just beyond the garden
Where the golden flowers gleam
There behind the barrier
The souls of children dream

Lined up in their chamber
Still persisting after life
Six have been the sacrifice
With one more they'll combine

King Asgore will set us free
King Asgore will give us hope
Light our way from the underground
King Asgore will save us all

From the underground...

The king in the mountain
Holds all but one soul
He carries the weight of his sins on his back
Their lives for the fate of us all
Now the children of monsters are lost
He's reaping revenge for us all
Our years in the darkness
Will come to an end
We wait for the seventh to fall
To restart the war
