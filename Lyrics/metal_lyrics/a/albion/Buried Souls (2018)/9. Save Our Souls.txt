Seeds of madness grow in this void
Chara, chaos, Asriel in soul
Pages gone, realities destroyed
Wall of nightmares rises up
Facing him alone

In his world you'll feel
Determination's influence
In the end you'll see
There is no god but him
Let your soul embrace the void

Here in his world, unearthly void
He is god and you're his toy
And he forms himself from nightmares
More than humans could withstand
Far outside memory's confines
Broken segments out of time
Save the children
Call their hearts back to your hand
Stand to save our souls

No return to rules of the game
Determination now belongs to him alone
Overwrite your chances to be saved
Omega transformation, power from the souls

As you call to the souls
Lost in the darkness
Anger dissolves
They come to your aid
With the strength of the souls
Fighting through madness
Lost hearts could be reclaimed

Here in his world, unearthly void...

And now there's no way out
He'll tear you to pieces
All over again
You'll writhe and shout out loud
You cried to the darkness
But nobody came

A fight to bring back time
The souls of the children
And all that we know
Until you fall and die
You're facing down
The madness of his soul

Here in his world, unearthly void...
