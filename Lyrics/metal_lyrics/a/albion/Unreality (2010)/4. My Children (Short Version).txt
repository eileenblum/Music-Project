In this world exist a million minds and all their children
An unreality we've made
Some become the symbols and the ones who represent us
And some are left to fade away

Cross the world to find the angels
Those abandoned by their makers
Lives deserving more than they have found
I'll seek out the world's forgotten
Find and save them all - My children
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Let them live

I can't give life, but I can save them from the darkness
The souls that don't deserve to die
I see all too many hearts cast out by their creator
And never given names or lives

Cross the world to find the angels
Those abandoned by their makers
Lives deserving more than they have found
I'll seek out the world's forgotten
Find and save them all - My children
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

So let them live
And let them be
The chosen few
To stay forever in sky sanctuary
Above the world
Immortalized
Saved in my memory
And seen through my eyes

You are the thirty-two angels
To guide me through all of my life
I'll never forget you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And I will search on through the valleys of this world
Until I have the perfect lives
It might take eternity, and I may never find them
I'll never know unless I try

Cross the world to find the angels
Those abandoned by their makers
Lives deserving more than they have found
I'll seek out the world's forgotten
Find and save them all - My children
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

So let them live
And let them be
The chosen few
To stay forever in sky sanctuary
Above the world
Immortalized
Through my own eyes

And by my hands
They come to life
My chosen few
The ones I found in the valleys of earth
Now raised above
Immortalized
And given new life as children of mine

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Chosen, immortalized in my eyes
