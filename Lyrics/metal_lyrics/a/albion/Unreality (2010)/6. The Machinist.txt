I am the mastermind
I'm the creator of a dream
I am an angel, and my gift is life

I am a predator
I take delight in all this fear
Unholy poisoner of your innocence

In this prison of metal and glass
A tribute to all that has passed - in life
And I'm writing each word of your fate
Describing your only future now line by line, and...

Here - behind a mask of iron
Here - inside my own temple for you
Here - I'll be the master of your fate
Just for a moment, and

Now - You'll be the one to enter
Now - The focus, the heart, the centre
Now - This is the madness of my heart
I'll make it come true
And I know it must be you

The dream takes hold of me
I'm the reviver of an art
It's a creation never meant to be

And I can't stop myself
This inspiration from inside
The spasming centre of my manic heart

In this fortress of metal and glass
The lives that are called to my world unite
And I'm writing each word of their fate
Describing their only future now line by line, and...

Here - behind a mask of iron
Here - inside my own temple for you
Here - I'll be the master of your fate
Just for a moment, and

Now - You'll be the one to enter
Now - The focus, the heart, the centre
Now - These are the memories gathered here
Of what's come before
And I'll see you in the core

My insanity is laid before me
You're the mirror of it all
Not alone at last, you brought me
Out of hiding where I stayed
If you share this grotesque fascination
Stand up, show yourself to me
All you have to do is say the word
I'll draw you down into the maze

Born from all my twisted love
To you it's just a game
I wake and feel this cold device
Is bolted to my brain
The karma that I spent on you
Has all come back to me
The watching eyes enjoy the cries
This glorious machine

With a love for control of this anarchy
Now there is just one master here
With the plan set in place, come and step towards the door
A whole new cycle has just begun, so...

Now - I'll be the light to guide you through
The temple of rust I built for you
As the designer of your fate
I'll be your angel, and...

Then - I'll be the hand to guide you home
The fantasy ends, your life restored
I will be seeing you again
When I will call on you once more
