I am a writer of this world
And I will shape it in my image
The air, water, fire and the earth
Can all be crafted by my hand
I can take every soul and draw them in
The lives I make become my children
But here in the back of my own mind
I hear a voice that I can't find

Far away, through the sky
I have seen your face
And you are calling out my name
To come through you will try
But you don't yet have a life
Till I draw you here to me

So could I learn to fly
And reach toward the lands beyond this sky
Leave the world I made for them behind
A journey now to find
This life that was not made within my mind
Could I reach out to you

I will find the fragments of your soul
Throughout the universe
To reach and gather them through time
No matter how long the way
I will draw to this world
Any time, anywhere
I will find you

Why do you want to come to me
Where did you come from, what's your story
I feel I could know just who you are
If our two lives could only cross
And I take every moment I can find
Transforming wonder to obsession
To gather the writings of the past
And piece by piece I find the story of your life

I see the past that you've been given
By the god that made your world
The suffering and every aspect of your tragedy
And as I turn each page of life
My mind is made up more and more
I want to be the one to save you from this cruelty

So now I'm going to fly
To reach toward the lands beyond this sky
Leave the world I made for them behind
And now I have to find
This life that was not made within my mind
It's my promise to you

I will find the fragments of your soul
Throughout the universe
To reach and gather them through time - I will fly
No matter how long the way
I will draw to this world
Any time, anywhere
I will find you

Your voice is the first of the pieces that I find
It's carried through the air of unreality
Already in my grasp as it's projected to this world
I only have to follow to its source

Now I can feel your power as I hold
Here in my hands, a fragment of your soul
And hearing your call I look towards the path ahead
Through the skies my search for you goes on

The body is the tie to earth
It's free of this corruption of the world
Unspoiled, untouchable
And flying free until I give you form

Like rivers of the truth
The pieces of the past will flow as one
The waters rise and fall
Converge and drift apart
I take your memories
And strip them of the world you used to know
A new beginning now
The fragments that I leave to form your mind

Always further out, I'm getting further from my home
I'm never looking back, because I'm never on my own
Towards the distant light I'll fly
The fire of your angel eye
The spirit of your soul revealed to me

Just... like the machinist
I... I can command this chaos
Here... taking it into my own hands
Now... all of the fragments
They... centre around your precious heart
And there is just one last piece left
Carry on

I - I've always been denied
But now I'm taking life
Into my own two hands - and all these
Memories of what they did to you
They spur me on - I'm coming for you
My queen

All my children
Left in my world
Now you'll be only mine as well
And here on the shore
At the edge of the universe
Your final gift is life

Now - I hold them in my hands, forever near to me
The precious fragments of your soul
And now my journey is done, I'll return to my world
Through the darkness, you're coming with me

I return, I'm coming from the sky
And the world has decayed without my hand
We're walking through the ruin
But now, it's only you that matters

I walk over the desert
The forest turned to cold dark sand
Then crawl up to the hills
With the fragments glowing in my hand
At the top of the highest mountain
I look out to the blackened sky
You are gone, and I don't know your name to call you back

I build a shrine
The highest point on earth reserved for you
I turn away
And I walk down from the mountain
Towards the remnants of the world
I gave it up for you - but still I
Hope to see you somewhere in the sky

My world has needed me
Without each other there, we cannot live
I'll rebuild it and never leave again
And still I'm waiting here
I'll stay so you can find and come to me
It's my promise to you

From the ground I'm watching over you for all eternity
The precious fragments of your soul
Lying silent and still, till I bring you to life
At the moment you choose to come back to me
So I'll wait for you forever here within this universe
And hope it wasn't just a dream
And though your image is gone
If you wish to return
I'll be here, I will wait
For as long as it takes
In the end, after all
I will find you
