Welcome to this world of unreality
Just look around at our imagined lives
Here we can be anything we want to be
Transcending all the limits of your life

You could be what your own mind would make you
To break your own world's set of rules
To take on another name, a mystery, and be
Whatever you may choose

Emerging from darkness, out of the shadows
Older than all the universe
With the eye of an angel
He sees the world in ways we can't conceive

Raised by the storm, a legend reborn
A fallen angel rose and came to life
The portal to find
The power of his mind
Is his single angel eye

Powerful, a master of all magic
Protected by the mask of his disguise
A sacrifice he made, but he was sent back
You can read him in the changing colours of his eyes

And his enemies will fall behind him
As he wields the underworld's sword
Raining holy fire from the heavens
As he unveils his final form

Raised by the storm, a legend reborn
A fallen angel rose and came to life
The last on the earth
He'll search for those who gave him birth
With his single angel eye

You're dreaming of this power to relieve you of this pain
If everyone is special then you're all the same again
Unbreakable, invincible, but none of this is true
The greatest tale of all of them is you

Immortal, unbroken, stronger than strong
And older than all the universe
With the eye of an angel
He sees the world in ways we can't conceive

Raised by the storm, a legend reborn
A fallen angel rose and came to life
The last on the earth
He'll search for those who gave him birth
With the eye of angels

Master of time, demonic, divine
A fallen angel rose and came to life
The portal to find
The power of his mind
Is his single angel eye
