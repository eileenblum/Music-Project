There's something wrong with how you think
The hate and pettiness you feel
There's something wrong with how you see the world
And all of us

You take delight in every fault
Your mindless empty words assault
To reassure that you're above the rest

You surround yourself with torture and with pain
Fixed on the faults of others, shame and blame
To beat down, to destroy, to tear and desecrate
Its only purpose is to fill you up with hate

Stand above, stand apart
Find the glory of your heart
And the life you hold inside
From this hate break away
Join this unreality
Stay forever by our side

Don't ask why everything is wrong
You would be better off alone
Detach yourself from all the shrines of failure you see

Don't keep your fears within yourself
Stand up and let your words be heard
Or you'll be caught inside the circle

And together we can be a better world
I see the makings of it everywhere
We will give you our hands, together for a time
To join our chorus with the princess of the earth

Stand above, stand apart
Find the glory of your heart
And the life you hold inside
From this hate break away
Join this unreality
Stay forever by our side

You surround yourself with torture and with pain
A false reality that's shown to you
There is good in this world, but you must seek it out
Together we can make it real

Stand above, stand apart
Find the glory of your heart
And the life you hold inside
From this hate break away
Join this unreality
Fly forever now

Running free, you will find
All the glory of your mind
And the life that you can be
Join us now, we can't wait
Stand above the fear and hate
Learn to think and feel
We can make it real
Fly forever free with me
