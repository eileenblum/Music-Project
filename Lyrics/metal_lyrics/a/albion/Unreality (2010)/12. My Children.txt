In this world exist a million minds and all their children
An unreality we've made
Some become the symbols and the ones who represent us
And some are left to fade away

Cross the world to find the angels
Those abandoned by their makers
Lives deserving more than they have found
I'll seek out the world's forgotten
Find and save them all - My children
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Let them live

I can't give life, but I can save them from the darkness
The souls that don't deserve to die
I see all too many hearts cast out by their creator
And never given names or lives

Cross the world to find the angels
Those abandoned by their makers
Lives deserving more than they have found
I'll seek out the world's forgotten
Find and save them all - My children
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

So let them live
And let them be
The chosen few
To stay forever in sky sanctuary
Above the world
Immortalized
Saved in my memory
And seen through my eyes

These are the lives that I have found

The first was my creation
With no name she was born
The first that I have saved
And the mother to them all
Imaginary perfection
Companion in the dark
And the start of the story for me

The second and third came to my sight
Together in form and in name
Each detail of their own lives laid out
For a lord and a master to claim

The fourth I made a promise to
That I'd never let her go
And through the years became a symbol
Of all that was to come for us

The fifth, the sixth, the seventh
In different lights appeared
Their forms and names
Forgotten through the years
The places that I found them
Have all but disappeared
But together they're here in my mind

The next four were bound together
From when all their lives began
Thrown into the maze and led to its core
By my hidden iron hand

Electrical - and beautiful
They fell under your spell
So scared when you appeared, I took your hand
Grew you into what you are today
Your life

I want to save you from the masters
Those who would twist you to their will
I'd take you back before their dreams of you, and
I'd help you both find a better world

Right out of nowhere
You showed the path of life to me
This is a memory
A memory of all you used to be
And I wish I could save your strength from the past
As I remember you

I met you through an enemy and friend
Inside a hidden corner, a life without a name
Inspired me to be the one to save
And I still see your eyes everywhere

So let them live
And let them be
The chosen few
To stay forever in sky sanctuary
Above the world
Immortalized
Saved in my memory
And seen through my eyes

I'm searching on
Throughout this world
To find the lost and deserving of life
One after one
They come to me
And by my own hands
Together they'll be

Unexpectedly, your story I'd find
I watched you fall in front of my eyes
But cheating death, you'd make your return
(Princess of the earth)
...Now

I have seen you through the world
And I followed you through time
All the images of beauty before you disappeared
As invisible as me
Never to be seen again
How I wanted to speak out and then save you
From the voice of the swarm and yourself

Five are the memories of your childhood corrupted
The beauty in this lustfulness
And when you take that first step
Soon it draws you in, and then
You are caught and you'll never be the same

I saw you in another's mind, standing all alone
I took you in and named you, made you one of my own
And the time will pass for you and I
'Til the day will come for you to die
I have seen the moments of your life
And all your future
I will save each minute 'til the end

I had a dream of you, and I had to write it down
You came together at the dawn of a new world
By some kind of magic you lived, but we can never meet
Separated by realities, this song is now for you

Now getting closer to the end
Regressing to the past again
We're walking down into the darkest reach
And only the four keys remain

Guilt and shame, a memory of the past
Still it's there, a feared and treasured twisting of your mind
Don't cling to the past, step away before you're caught
Let go of the things that made your life
You know that you're not what you were any more
But deep down inside you're the same
Because as time moves us all through the path of life
They're trapped, and they still remain
They still remain

The two remaining angels
Not even I can see
Their shapes and names and forms
Are never clear to me
I take them from my memory
And make them of my own
Different worlds I see through their eyes

Oh, oh

You are the thirty-two angels
To guide me through all of my life
I'll never forget you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And I will search on through the valleys of this world
Until I have the perfect lives
It might take eternity, and I may never find them
I'll never know unless I try

Cross the world to find the angels
Those abandoned by their makers
Lives deserving more than they have found
I'll seek out the world's forgotten
Find and save them all - my children
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

So let them live
And let them be
The chosen few
To stay forever in sky sanctuary
Above the world
Immortalized
Through my own eyes

And by my hands
They come to life
My chosen few
The ones I found in the valleys of earth
Now raised above
Immortalized
And given new life as children of mine

Oh-oh-oh-oh
Chosen, immortalized in my eyes

Let them live!
