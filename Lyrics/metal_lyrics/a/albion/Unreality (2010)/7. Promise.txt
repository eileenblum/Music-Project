No matter where
And no matter who
We'll strike out to come and get you
You've watched from afar
The hand of fate moves
The next could be you

No matter when
And no matter how
We'll be there, we'll come and find you
You'll never be safe, there's nowhere to hide
From the unblinking eye

You will learn to love and fear
Cause I know you wanted to be here
And through you, I've found a way
To share my madness with the world
