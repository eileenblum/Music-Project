Nothing here can stop you on your personal crusade
You know well you never will be found
You've made it your task to condemn our shameful ways
And we always hear your furious sound

So why do you keep on coming back to us
You're fooling no one but yourself
Your own obsession gives your mind away
You're just the same as us
You just don't know it yet

Proclaiming your own purity, you build a wall
Scream out loud and let them know it hurts
And through your shuttered mind you'll never realize
You're not the guardian of the world

Let go (let go)
Let go (let go)
Let go of all you used to know
And see the world transform in front of your eyes
Let it enjoy you
Let it destroy you
Until you're one of us

Come give yourself to this corruption
Just let it grow and melt your mind away, now
Remove your fear and open up your heart
Drawing you closer every day
This corruption will be yours to hold

We're the pride of creation, you and I
With all our faults and fantasies
So give up your pretence and join this tragedy
Let the world's corruption spread - fuel me

Let go (let go)
Let go (let go)
Let go of all you used to fear
You'll see the world explode in front of your eyes
Let it enjoy you
Let it destroy you
Until there is no turning back

Come give yourself to this corruption
Just let it grow and melt your mind away, now
Remove your fear and open up your heart
Drawing you closer every day

Come give yourself to this corruption
And then the world will be a better place, now
Cast off your fear and open up your heart
Another new life every day

This corruption will be yours to hold
Let it invade your mind and it will
Set you free
