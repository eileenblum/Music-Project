With his great celestial hand
He paints the world in his own image
The mountains, forest and sea
Are the signs of life
That he spreads across the earth
And he left creation in our hands
The keepers of the earth
Stood and watched the chaos
That we brought to the world
His world

And he said -
Now the time has come to end this world
And the creatures crawling on its earth
For my hands have only made corrupt and evil
But I can't destroy the world I love
Earth below and purest skies above
Without giving all of you one chance
To save yourselves
You've fallen so far now
But you may not yet be past all hope
And to prove yourselves my task is this
Find me one perfect soul (One soul)
And the world will be saved

For so many thousand years we've fought ourselves
All the petty differences and grudges we have held
Chaos has been with us all throughout our time
Those who don't know we exist could fight and end our lives

Could there be a perfect soul
Within this broken world
Among the chaos, would there be
Someone to save this land and all its souls

And across the scattered lands this search goes on
It's so hard now to remember all that we have done
Is there just one soul alive without a flaw
Is there one among our kind worth saving the world for

Could there be a perfect soul
Within this broken world
Among the chaos, would they be
Messiah for us all

Save us from the night
Guide us to the light

From the sound and fury of the world
Comes a time, a purpose that unites us all
Have we ever come so far, forgotten what we are
We're not just another tale of earth
Hold his words forever in your heart
And the world is good as long as you're alive
If we learn from those before, we can be so much more
Find me one perfect soul (One soul)
And the world will be saved

And united as we're searching
We forget the hate that we felt
Don't just wait for your own saviour
We can change this world ourselves
And be one perfect soul

From the sound and fury of the world
Comes a time, a purpose that unites us all
Have we ever come so far, forgotten what we are
We're not just another tale of earth
Hold his words forever in your heart
And the world is good as long as you're alive
If we learn from those before, we can be so much more
We are one perfect soul (One soul)

One voice
One body
One mind
One spirit
One heart
One life
One perfect soul
