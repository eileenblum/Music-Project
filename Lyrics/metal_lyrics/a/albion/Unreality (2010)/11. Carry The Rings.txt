I had a dream, where I was floating
In a dark and rusted sphere
With nowhere left to go
Catching glimpses of
The golden light surrounding me
I couldn't reach the world beyond
Even though it seemed so close to me
With every door just unreachable
I'm chasing unreality

Back down to earth and all the hardships of the world
Driven mad by darkness, sound and blinding light

Make the dream reality
As you carry the rings across the sea
Travel on to find your brave new world
You're so close and still so far

I have found my final angel
A voice beyond the wall
And the sphere of rust will fade
As thirty-two surround us all
At the speed of sound I travel
To reach your sight again
Though I'm leaving all behind
I'm coming home
The last of my angels

Time slows down, and I'm awake again
I could turn my back here and be saved
But now I've come so far
And I can't give up
The end is finally in my sight

And even though I'm still here stranded on the ground
There is someone there who waits for me to fly

Make the dream reality
As you carry the rings across the sea
Travel on to find your brave new world
You're so close and still so far

I have found my final angel
A voice beyond the wall
And the sphere of rust will fade
As thirty-two surround us all
At the speed of sound I travel
To reach your sight again
Though I'm leaving all behind
I'm coming home
The last of my angels

Into silver light I fly away
Break the sphere and see the city of forever
I've chosen you as you chose me
And the rings will carry us both into eternity, oh

Make the dream reality
As you carry the rings across the sea
Travel on to find your brave new world
You're so close and still so far

I have found my final angel
A voice beyond the wall
And the sphere of rust will fade
As thirty-two surround us all
At the speed of sound I travel
To reach your sight again
Though I'm leaving all behind
I'm coming home
And I will find you

And the bond that we created
Extends beyond this life
We will go wherever you believe
Ascending side by side
I have found my final angel
And you have found your own
We'll be leaving all behind
And coming home
The last of my angels

Carry the rings across the sea
And you know just where I'm going
I'll return again some day
Escaping now the unreality
