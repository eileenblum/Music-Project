People will all look to me when the world lies on their shoulders
Throughout all their lives they've known that they can't be open and free
Every last one of these hearts have something they have kept secret
Their minds full of guilt, they'll never be able to know themselves

I can see through your mind if you'll let me
Tell me now the name that you were born
It's the first step to looking through your hidden mind
And the secret to knowing who you are

After you're over your fear and you've learned that you can trust me
The memories pour out, I follow the water of time back again
There is no need to fight back to the world, because I will listen
There's always an origin that we'll find somewhere in the past

I'm just a man - but I have a vision
Something I taught myself through years in darkness
Let me come close - open your mind, receive my own
And I'll dive deep into your scattered, shattered memories

Will you walk with me
Through the corridor of time
To find forgotten pieces in
The corners of your mind
I can see myself in you
I can look out through your eyes
We'll unlock this twisted miracle
Together we'll find the truth

Each mind is a story that I can read through all your memories
Another one starts, another life woven in front of my eyes
With each new mind to explore, I see things that look so familiar
I'm finding myself through you, your desires reflected in me

I can see your evolution
Every joy and fear, each passion and poison
As the past becomes clear again, you'll see it too
And together we'll walk through years of broken memories

Will you walk with me
Through the gallery of time
To find forgotten pieces in
The corners of your mind
I can see myself in you
I can look out through your eyes
We'll unlock this twisted miracle
Together we'll find the truth

Try to remember all that you've heard
Through all your memories I hope to find myself
Don't be afraid now, open your past
Then I can give you peace of mind at last
The answers at last

Will you follow me
Through the labyrinth of time
To find forgotten pieces in
The path that made your life
I can see myself in you
I can look out through your eyes
And I hope you'll do the same for me
Together - forever
I grant you the greatest gift of all
You'll know me when you find the truth
