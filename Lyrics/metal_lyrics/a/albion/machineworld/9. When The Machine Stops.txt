The Machine had ruled our existence
Our minds were bound to its core
Processing a thousand procedures
Had never been like this before

Creating a conscious robot
Was a challenge that they had to face
It was a success, and so was the rest
It seemed like the end of the case

So subtle and silent
The world changed its way
The machine was created
Life stolen away
Now I stand fighting
In lakes of despair
I'd wanted my freedom
The errors appeared

I dreamed of sailing the oceans
Dreamed of clouds in the sky
The looks of nature's creation
The sun would be shining so high

A life made of serene dreams
I was to author my destiny
Every event will be cast in the log
And I will be free for eternity

So subtle and silent
The errors gave way
The machine was dying
Sanity blown away
Now I stand watching
The atomic clock
I will get my freedom
When the machine stops

I have seen them, known them, loved them
There is an outside world that remains
As we lie here beneath the dying machine
The earth will rise again from its chains

Subtle and silent
The world changed its way
The machine was created
Life stolen away
Now I stand fighting
In lakes of despair
I'd wanted my freedom
The errors appeared

So subtle and silent
The errors gave way
The machine was dying
Sanity blown away
Now I stand watching
The atomic clock
I will get my freedom
When the machine stops
