I know there's a place to run to
Somewhere in the earth
Far below my outside form
And hidden from the world
Every detail perfect
But I kept it all from you
And every time you hurt me
I built another room - to keep them

Thirty-two angels in my hands to guide me
Thirty-two rooms with the names carved above
Thirty-one chances to prove you're the right one
An altar of cruelty is built from my love
By my hands

I feel like I'm betraying you
With what my mind creates
But still I will retreat there
When my will begins to break
A hive of guilty pleasure
Sealed outside the world's view
And every time I looked at you
I built another room

Thirty-two angels in my hands to guide me
Thirty-two rooms with the names carved above
Thirty-one chances to prove you're the right one
An altar of cruelty is built from my love

And this temple of rust is a sign of my lust
A place for my shame and my sin
This frustration inside, the emotions I hide
They build up the world within
In the temple of rust

Beautiful corrosion
As more arrive here below
A place you wish to dream for
But can't let anyone know

Harvesting your mind maze
I'm watching what's come before
To find the perfect pieces
The elements for the whole

The key to my kingdom is kept in my hands
Protected from harm and the hate you demand
Always with me, to be lived on command
My dream ends here

With the thirty-two angels in my hands to guide me
Thirty-two rooms with the names carved above
I'll guide you through darkness and reach for the centre
An altar of cruelty is built from my love

And this temple of rust is a sign of my lust
A place for my shame and my sin
This frustration inside, the emotions I hide
They build up the world within
A heart full of anger for no one to see
It's all locked away
In the temple of rust
