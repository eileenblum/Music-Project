It is your life's eternal dream
To run and enter the machine
A second life that's hidden from the world
You take the power that it gives
To realize how you want to live
And build the world as it needs to be

You will know her holy name
She'll fulfil your frozen dream
As she draws you in
Beautiful child of this perfect world
An icon of heavenly sin

The moments of your life for sale
They see the image of themselves
It gives them all a chance to live as you do
You draw them in to your own world
And in return you come to theirs
You build a planet from your hearts and hands

They can see, they can hear
They can join you in your world
I can watch but I can't become
Here I will stand, but without a form
I'll be forever unknown

Perfect beauty, perfect in your mind
I create the same as you, still I am the loneliest king alive
And in this universe I only want one thing
To become a legend everywhere I go

Fly across the world
I see the earth below
No purpose or direction
Though everything I know
And wherever the wind takes me
I see your form appear
But you can never see me
Or know that I am here

I will watch your world
With no form to call my own
Will you hear my whispered voice
And tell me I am not alone
I can never have a heart or life
In this world that we've made
To you I'll be forever
Invisible

For those who use more than their eyes
Give me your hands, fly by my side
You cannot see me, I am void and formless
And if you build me my own heart
And give me one of a thousand lives
I have no heart to give you in return

I know you've touched so many lives
And by your hands, you'll never die
I can see but I cannot feel
I'll be here but can never be real

Perfect beauty, perfect in your mind
I create the same as you, still I am the loneliest king alive
And in this universe I could exist myself
If I could be the hero who could never cry

Fly across the world
I see the earth below
No purpose or direction
Though everything I know
And wherever the wind takes me
I see your form appear
But you can never see me
Or know that I am here

I will watch your world
With no form to call my own
Will you hear my whispered voice
And tell me I am not alone
I can never have a heart or life
In this world that we've made
To you I'll be forever
Invisible

I can see all the world
And the lives that you have made
But I am lost and all alone in a dream
On the outside looking in

And I'll never have a heart or life
In this world that we've made
Invisible forever

I will watch your world
With no form to call my own
Will you hear my whispered voice
And tell me I am not alone
I can never have a heart or life
In this world that we've made
To you, to the world
To the ones I'll never know
To you all I'll be forever
Invisible

Invisible
