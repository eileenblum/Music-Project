Now it's so easy to hate this world
When we see all the damage we've done
We're fighting ourselves, spreading war and hate
And we can't see how far we have come

There is still someone, down here below
Making your dreams come true
Believe in yourself, fly ever higher in your mind
And spread the message

How can you tell me you hate this world
When you see everything we've achieved
Our world built from nothing, our future hopes
Are a symbol of what we can be

We have brought light into the dark
We can mend minds and hearts
If we unite, our only limit is
The power of our dreams

Glorious together we can be again
To cease the war among ourselves
Together we'll be strong
We'll join our hands as one
Forever we will be
A wonder of the world

We have a chance for a better world
And we can't stay unheard anymore
You can't see you could live in paradise
Cause you'd always be searching for more

But if we try, in some hundred years
Maybe the blind shall see again
Forgive and forget, we can be stronger than we know
Yes we can
Pushing together, we can go far
Living the dream of Alexandria
And bring to life the power of our dreams

Glorious together we can be again
To cease the war among ourselves
Together we'll be strong
We'll join our hands as one
Forever we will be
A wonder of the world

[Instrumental: Telstar]

Glorious together we can be again
To cease the war among ourselves
Together we'll be strong
We'll join our hands as one
Forever we will be
A wonder of the world

Glorious together we can be again
To cease the war among ourselves
Together we'll be strong
We'll join our hands as one
Forever we will be
A wonder of the world - now
