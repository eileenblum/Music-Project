He existed with a bitter envious king
After all his trust, they tortured him within
With such cruelty, he was maddened as he fought
For jealously brings hate
And suffering his fate
He had the strength to kill us with a thought

Power runs wild, the kingdom will fall
And all the world we knew will die
Unable to kill, the master of all
Confined to the island in the sky

At the centre of a black and twisted maze
In eternal darkness, blinded by his rage
The greed of the race of humans, to steal his mighty storm
To use it for themselves, they took him from his hell
Drew out and cast his power to a form

And the crown was made from all of his hate
And buried beneath the earth
The curse to obey, we saw the last day
The ashes remaining of this world

Sent into the skies above
And reaching for the crown
His memories are lost
Inside the earth without a sound
Forgotten in the underside
The beast from down below
A remnant of a thousand years ago

Now lost in the earth, he's nothing but a shell
Mechanical heart of steel
But coming to life, see the war begin again
He can learn to think and feel

And your heart of steel will lead you
To stand against the master of heavens
With his soul by your side
Let Earth be your guide
To finish this story forever
Rise and go

Diving to the lands below
And reaching for the core
Demented heart of darkness
In the centre of it all
The creatures of this island
That by my own hand had died
Unthinking, destroying their lives

Now lost in the earth, he'll make up for his past
Mechanical heart of steel
And coming to life, see the war begin again
He can learn to think and feel

And your heart of steel will lead you
To stand against the master of heavens
With his soul by your side
Let Earth be your guide
To finish this story forever

A beautiful crimson flower
The source of all control
The power of life, to draw out your strength
It only costs your soul

The rage will come for us all
And spread all over the earth
Before the stand against the king
We'll save the world from ourselves

Through the holy land you'll carry on
Bloody angels light your way
Crossing through the miles of the underside
To find out your own name

And in the centre of it all he stands
Through millenia still alive
Screaming souls inside him, it's your only chance
Before you lose your life

Rising up from the earth, emerging from his shell
Mechanical heart of steel
And reaching the sun, see the master's throne again
He can learn to think and feel

And your heart of steel will lead you
To stand against the master of heavens
With his soul by your side
Let Earth be your guide
To finish this story forever

Heart of steel will lead you
To stand against the master of heavens
With his soul by your side
Let Earth be your guide
To dethrone the tyrant
And bring back our lives
Will you finish this story - forever
