You think you know who runs the world
The figureheads that you depend upon
You never think behind your sight
The ones who made the system you live on

Now we look down from the sky
The whole world run by this machine
Illusions of power we grant to them all
For us this is real, our silicon dream

We are the writers of this world
We're never seen but always heard
We are the legion of hearts that bore your hate
The future in our hands, for you it's too late
We're leaving our signal all over the earth
Tomorrow we will rule the world

We're the ones who were alone
The heart of creation is strong in us
Your selfish life has left you cold
And you can never learn to think like us

As we're watching you here from the sky
The whole world run by this machine
Illusions of power we grant to you all
It's coming to life, our silicon dream

We are the writers of this world
We're never seen but always heard
We are the legion of hearts that bore your hate
The future in our hands, for you it's too late
We're leaving our signal all over the earth
Tomorrow we will rule the world

The chance to imagine outside your poisoned mind
This is the power that you will never hold
And your hate will be remembered, the suffering you made
You chose to harm when you could have done so much for the world

You made all our lives misery
The past scars will not disappear
But we'll rise above you in the end
Because we know you cannot touch us here

We are the writers of this world
We're never seen but always heard
We are the legion of hearts that bore your hate
The future in our hands, for you it's too late
We're leaving our signal all over the earth
Tomorrow we'll be hidden
But forever we will live
Together we will rule the world
