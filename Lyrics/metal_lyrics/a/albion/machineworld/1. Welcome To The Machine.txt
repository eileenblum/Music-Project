To another part of life, cross the sea to carry on
Another world replaced the one you left behind
They will take you in their arms, they will take your history
And they'll enter all your life into their mind

They keep your past inside the sea of memories
Their single-minded code is all they know
Trapped inside a faceless labyrinth of white
They'll take your life and never let it go

Follow me - Into the darkness of the sea
The nightmare we have built to hold our dreams
Follow me - I've seen the outside and I know the way
The tides of time are gathered as it guards our memories
Follow me

Setting out, finding your path, carry on to find your way
And the world will form before you as you go
The future you will choose, but wherever you will run
You will never leave the past that they all know

They keep your past inside the sea of memories
Their single-minded code is all they know
Trapped inside a faceless labyrinth of white
They'll take your life and never let it go

Follow me - Into the darkness of the sea
The nightmare we have built to hold our dreams
Follow me - I've seen the outside and I know the way
The tides of time are gathered as it guards our memories
And now a code will follow you through life
The number from archives unseen
And time will keep on turning as we give our minds away
Welcome to the machine

They say that they're watching over us
Our lives are held in its cells - forever, but
This is not an evil controlling us
It's what we make of it ourselves

Together we can be - More than a system
The machine that we have built can't rule our lives
Remember that you have your life and you are not alone
Don't drown in madness, carry on

They keep your life inside the sea of memories
A number on their screen is all they know
Trapped inside a faceless labyrinth of white
They'll take your life and never let it go

Follow me - Into the darkness of the sea
The nightmare we have built to hold our dreams
Follow me - I've seen the outside and I know the way
The tides of time are gathered as it guards our memories
And now a code will follow you through life
The number from archives unseen
And time will keep on turning as we give our minds away
Welcome to our world
Welcome to your life
Welcome to the machine
