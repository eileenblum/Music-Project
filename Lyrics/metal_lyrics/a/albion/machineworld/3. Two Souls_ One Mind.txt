I live a perfect life
Free of the chaos in the minds of others
The world before me now
Can be explained in every glyph and number

But sometimes don't you want to see your past revive
And the chance to leave behind your ordered life
You made me to protect another hidden side of you
I've come to life, we are a heart split in two
(Split in my mind)
Two souls combined

They are two souls combined, exist in one mind
Eternally fighting, but carried side by side
With a heart split in two, they'll never be unified
Competing for one life, they'll fight until they die

The time has changed us all
Forgot the promise, put the past behind me
My task throughout my life
To bring an order to the world before me

Inside I long for havoc and the chaos controlled
I'll be your torturer for now and ever more
The gates are open, I will show you, step inside
My invitation, this device against your mind
(Carried side by side)
Fight against your mind

They are two souls combined, exist in one mind
Eternally fighting, but carried side by side
With a heart split in two, they'll never be unified
Competing for one life, they'll fight until they die

Together they would be strong
The fighting sides that make the parts of me
If you cannot see that we are the same
I'll walk inside your shadow for eternity

They are two souls combined, exist in one mind
Eternally fighting, but carried side by side
With a heart split in two, they'll never be unified
Competing for one life, they'll fight forever

Two souls combined, exist in one mind
Eternally fighting, but carried side by side
With a heart split in two, they'll never be unified
Competing for one life, they'll fight until they die

Two souls, one mind
A heart split in two that exists in one life
Eternally fighting, existence entwined
Together they walk side by side
Two souls in one mind
