From an island in the old world, far beyond the sea
Where I thought that life would always be
After all this time I feel my memories fall away
As they go, my old life slowly fades into a dream

And I see through the eyes
Of another place and time
As the pictures slowly vanish into haze
It's so hard to see through
To the Albion I knew
And it doesn't even matter
Now that time has moved us on

There's no way home
To the memories of your life
Seen in a new light
Through the eyes of the world
You can't return, as you live to learn
Wherever you go, there's no way home

Things will never be the same, no matter how you try
Once you've gone, it's only in your mind
Still I'm reaching out to catch the signals from the sky
In the hope that one would lead me back to my own life

And I see through the eyes
Of another place and time
As the pictures slowly vanish into haze
It's so hard to see through
To the Albion I knew
And it doesn't even matter
Now that time has moved us on

There's no way home
To the memories of your life
Seen in a new light
Through the eyes of the world
You can't return, as you live to learn
Wherever you go, there's no way home

When your world is tearing in half
The hands of time destroying the past
A picture of the world - lost in time
That you'll never find again

Oh - oh

There's no way home
To the memories of your life
Seen in a new light
Through the eyes of the world
You can't return, as you live to learn
Wherever you go, there's no way home

There's no way home to the world you remember
Lost forever in time
Wherever you go, there's no way home
