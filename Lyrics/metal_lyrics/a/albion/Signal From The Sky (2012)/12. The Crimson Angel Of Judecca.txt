Prophet of the sky
Red demonic eye
Calling out for the lost ones
The gate to other worlds
The covenant of blood
Apostle of the violet rose

With a bloody crimson eye
Accursed flesh will come alive
And altered minds around him
See the echoes of the eulogy of doom

Choked by demon spores
Read the dark grimoire
The flesh and blood of the innocent
Avatar divine
The cosmic soup of time
The eye of judgement sees us all

Through his bloody crimson eye
He sees the gate is open wide
In fury he will fly
To see the echoes of the end

Chaotic wings of the reaper
Chasing disaster
Painting the skies in flame
Holy angel of fire
Flies ever higher
Screaming his name

And again he'll rise from the cage of ice
The crimson angel of Judecca
On the edge of madness, frozen in time
Awakened by the tree of blight
Summoned again through fire and flame
On his bloody wings he will fly!

Chaotic wings of the reaper
Chasing disaster
Painting the skies in flame
Holy angel of fire
Flies ever higher
Screaming his name

And again he'll rise from the cage of ice
The crimson angel of Judecca
On the edge of madness, frozen in time
Awakened by the tree of blight

On bloody wings of hope
I see salvation is coming
The star of solitude
Rising up in the sky
Like the wings of an angel
So come with me
If we run forever we'll find him
A fallen angel, his mad love
Awakens once more
The world to come
