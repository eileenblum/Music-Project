Despite all human reason
We believe a voice unheard
Look back a thousand years ago
And cling on to those words
Believing all our wonders
Are miracles from god
Now those who only trust the dead
Are holding back the world
With blinded eyes

What used to be our knowledge
Is now a heresy
We're branded all as skeptics
By the ones who don't believe
What happened to the world
And the future we were told
Every time we dare to take a step
A raging storm unfolds

Blindly they look to the sun
There's no chosen one
A star that will never come
Turn your eyes down to your dying world
Over blackened sands
To the boiling sea

Fighting the world forever
Have we seen the apex of our time
We all believed we could change the world
In an age that never came
Sailing the acid ocean
Evolution of our world denied
Just once for them, would you send a sign
A chance for all mankind
A signal from the sky

Father, if you're out there
Would you speak to them again
A voice to find, to free their mind
From confirmation's pain
And save us from delusions
Of the ones who saw the light
Those who see the world
In perfect black and white

Blindly they look to the sun
There's no chosen one
A star that will never come
Turn your eyes down to your dying world
Over blackened sands
To the acid ocean

Fighting the world forever
Have we seen the apex of our time
We all believed we could change the world
In an age that never came
Sailing the acid ocean
Evolution of our world denied
Just once for them, would you send a sign
A chance for all mankind
A signal from the sky

Power, greed, corruption
Hate disguised as love
Leading to temptation
Those we're meant to trust
Righteous persecution
Human rights denied
All for what the ancient madmen
Saw in ghosts up in the sky

Somewhere up through the madness
Hatred and violence
Blinded in misery
Beacons bright in the darkness
Shining in silence
Just for the ones who choose to see

Oh, we're fighting the world forever
Have we seen the apex of our time
We all believed we could change the world
In an age that never came
Sailing the acid ocean
The potential of us all denied
Just once for them, would you send a sign
A chance for all mankind
An answer for the blind
A signal from the sky

A signal from the sky
