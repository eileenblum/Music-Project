We're out on open water, speeding for the distance
Beneath the endless sky, we're carried by the wind
The shining stars will keep us steadfast on our way
While our path is clear, we ride, we're heading straight on to the sun

It's been a long time now, we can't escape forever
We're overtaken by a shadow in the sky
So suddenly the clouds arrive and block the light
And without a guide there's nowhere left to go

As we're wandering, the stars fade away
I need somebody to show me the way

We can make it through the storm
And from the chaos we'll reform
To reach the other side
And see the smile of the sun
But it's got so hard to hide
The cracks appearing in the sky
As the days of our ending have begun

We're lost among the thunder, searching for the way out
This time it isn't clear, there's no true path ahead
We're spinning round, the storm has taken all control
And the way out is forgotten as we hold on for our lives

As we're wandering, the stars fade away
I need somebody to show me the way

We can make it through the storm
And from the chaos we'll reform
To reach the other side
And see the smile of the sun
But it's got so hard to hide
The cracks appearing in the sky
As the days of our ending have begun

Keep watching the sea
Keep watching the sky
It's not in our nature to give up and die
Your eyes on the waves
Your hands on the helm
And you'll guide us through the storm

Keep watching the sea
Keep watching the sky
It's not in our nature to give up and die
Your heart in the past
Your mind on tomorrow
You'll guide us through the storm

The ones beside me in this fight against the ocean
As I depend on them, their lives depend on me
And I'm alive again, my choices now are clear
I can seize a chance and take us out, to navigate the sea

As we're wandering, I'm finding our way
And eventually, each storm fades away

We can make it through the storm
And from the chaos we'll reform
To reach the other side
And see the smile of the sun
But it's got so hard to hide
The cracks appearing in the sky
At the days of our end

We can make it through the storm
And from the chaos we'll reform
To reach the other side
And see the smile of the sun
But it's got so hard to hide
The cracks appearing in the sky
As the days of our ending have begun

As we search for our sky
Escape the storm overhead
Once again see the smile of the sun
