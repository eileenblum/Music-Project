Hie thee to the ocean city
To conquer the shadows of night
To fight against the endless dark
Restore this world's light
Time's end will await you there
And death's demise, it's told
Though you don't yet know what this means
Sail on to Armoroad

Far to the south a pathway leads beneath the silent sea
Leads down through spiral strata formed from chaos and debris
Promise of fame, a truth to seek and fortune for the brave
From near and far they gather here to enter the maze

From the corners of the world
To the centre of the ocean labyrinth
Every single life has a purpose
Drawing them to here
From the weakest sons of earth
To the daughters born of royalty
When the legend reaches distant shores
Throughout the world they hear these words

Hie thee to the ocean city
To conquer the shadows of night
To fight against the endless dark
Restore this world's light
Time's end will await you there
And death's demise, it's told
So journey for the distant shore
Sail on to Armoroad

Far down below, a secret lies beneath the ocean waves
The key to great disaster at the centre of the maze
Open the path, a world lost a century ago
Protected through the ages so the city might live

From the corners of the world
To the centre of the ocean labyrinth
Every single life has a purpose
Drawing them to here
From the weakest sons of earth
To the daughters born of royalty
They will journey through the dark
And find the story to be told

Travel down the nested worlds
Through the forest of eternity
Could you be the ones to find the way
Endure the silence of the sea
A hero's odyssey

Into the void of the dark
From the sky to the sea
There's no true path
As you take your chance
Fighting venom and rage
To find a way through the nested worlds
Through wood, water, fire, stone and light
Down to the black, and deeper still
To a place defying time

[Koshiro Yuzo medley]

Take up the sword and the scroll in hand
This is where your own tale began
A place in your mind
Left so far behind
Can come back to being once more

Crossing the borders of land and sea
Open the path to sanctuary
And then may you find
The song lost to time
And bring back the light to us all

Travel down the nested worlds
Through the forest of eternity
Could you be the ones to find the way
Endure the silence of the sea

Travel down the nested worlds
Through the forest of eternity
Could you be the ones to find the way
Endure the silence of the sea
A hero's odyssey
