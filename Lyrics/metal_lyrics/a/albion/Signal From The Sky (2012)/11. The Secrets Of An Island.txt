Somewhere in the sea of dreams
An island stands alone
The empty walls and rooftops
Are the signs of life now gone
And the waves keep pulsing endlessly
On to its gentle shore
Calling out to all the drifting minds
In rhythm to explore
It draws them here

Awake from the mist
That clouds through my conscious mind
And I can see
Alone on the shore
A road leads to nowhere
Down to the sea

Far up in the sky
The shadows of flying machines
They circle round
Observing the earth
Their eyes always watching
The lifeless ground

And up on the hill I see
The spire of the library
The centre of all the island's world
And with my eyes fixed on the entrance
I find myself drawn to the distance
Feeling underneath my feet
The heartbeat of this universe

I run - up to the library
The centre of this world
Away - and up from the endless sea
To reach for some way out

And inside the walls
Abandoned and desolate
A sense of pain
A wood panelled room
And scattered around my feet
Are burned remains

But up on the altar
A book starts to form from blackened shards
A rough empty cover with no words
And taking a page charred by fire
I reach out and put it in place there
Feeling right behind my head
A shift in dream's reality

Find your fantasy
Decide your destiny
And then the secrets of an island
Will be yours to find
It's your only way
To reach reality
Will you assemble all the pages
And escape from time
And this dream

Turn towards the entrance again
Step outside and see the destruction
All the flying machines are torn from the air
And burn towards the ground
I see disaster coming
A blaze approaching from the sky
And as the first one crashes down
Then it's all that I can think of just to run

Fire and metal rain from the sky
As I run they join the inferno
Their bodies spin like paper through air
And tear their wings apart
And as the island burns in fire
Trapping me in flames, I realize
Now I know the only way
There's one place left to go

I run - back to the library
To reform time again
Return - to alter my destiny
And take another chance
To find the pages of universe
Inside subconscious mind
The world - spiralling down into
Another branch of time

Now the door opens up
Into the centre of a storm
Tornadoes sweep the sea
And the land is scarred and torn
Stepping back from the raging wind
I shut myself inside
Look again to the half-formed book
And search another time

To find each page in the library
A scene from a dream
Describing a nightmare through its words
The fragments of fears
From all the dreamers' minds
Evoking thoughts, lives and images
Throughout time

Find your fantasy
Decide your destiny
And then the secrets of an island
Will be yours to find
It's your only way
To reach reality
Will you assemble all the pages
And escape from time
And this dream will keep you here
And turn through every page
Until you find the way to awake
Open up your eyes

Another page, another landscape forms outside
A desert of dust and sand that stretches far and wide
I leave the shelter of the door and move away
Start walking across the world to find another way

Wherever I walked on this plain
The spire would appear once again
Silent the world reformed
And sent me back towards the library

This time new figures appear
Their spirits emerge from the air
Frozen in time and showing me
The memories left by minds of dreamers here

I see the figures trying each and every page
They step outside, return and try again
The book now is closed, full and complete
Each fate refused, forever they'll stay inside the dream
They touch the book again, they pick it up
And find it's fused to their hands

Fading out, absorbed into time
And with one scream they disappear
Steel my mind, this fate won't be mine
I'll find the way out of here

Stepping out for the last time
The horizon dark again
There's nothing here but the waves of the sea
In this path of existence
The island never formed
But the library still stands eternal
Stoic and silent, the book now complete
Closed upon the altar
And I hear it calling for me

Joining all of the dreamers
I could leave the world behind
Resign to fate, disappear and be gone
Do I dare take a last chance
There's another way I see
But in a dream, what will come when we die

With nothing left that's here for me
I throw myself into the sea
I feel a sudden piercing cold
The water closes over me
Familiar light envelops me
And suddenly I'm flying free
I soar up to the endless sky
And open up my eyes again

Accept your life, and walk the path
That you have chosen for yourself
You can't repeat one chance
Over and over
Keep moving on, make your mistakes
And learn from each and every one
Then you'll return from them
Stronger than ever

Maybe someday I'll be there again
And the way out may not be the same
Not in the dreamscape, but this real world
And this time I'll find my way

If you're there
If other dreamers lose their way
If you hear
The island calling you some day
Then you'll know
Then the library will still be there, you'll see
The secrets of an island revealed
