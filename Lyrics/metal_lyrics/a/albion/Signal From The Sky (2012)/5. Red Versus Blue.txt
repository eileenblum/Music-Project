The country's broken and they know just who to blame
They tell you lies and want a mark next to their name
Trust in your baseless fear and gullibility
To make you see what they tell you to see

The donkey and the elephant
The rose and crayon tree
Choosing which of their lies you will believe

And the race goes on forever
As we try to best ourselves
One side spreads lies and hate and fear
The other wants to save the world
Every time the dance went on
A new face took the stage
But the future refused to change

So grab your flag, we'll march together to the square
No need for reason, cause we all know why we're here
They'll change their minds about us when they see our words
Who cares what all the others say, we'll scream until we're heard

It takes so long to teach them
What they never want to learn
Turn your back on the fire and you'll burn

And the race goes on forever
As we try to best ourselves
One side spreads lies and hate and fear
The other wants to save the world
One will stand above the rest
And promise hope and change
But turn out to be just as strange

Sit back with covered ears
You'll make them king of all the world
Turn your back on the fire and you'll burn

And the race goes on forever
As we try to best ourselves
One side spreads lies and hate and fear
The other wants to save the world
Every time the dance went on
A new face took the stage
But the future refused to change

And steadfast we will stand divided
Cause united we would fall
Still we live, side by side
Just as long as we're alive
And the future will never change
