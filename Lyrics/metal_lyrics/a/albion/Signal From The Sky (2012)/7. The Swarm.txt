Do you see the cloud on the horizon
Have you heard the word upon the wind
It's been building up and we'll be caught inside its eye
A relentless, swirling hurricane of hate

In this place
An electronic world
Their power comes at last
The mind of the hive
As the guilt will cut you up inside
And swallow you alive

We are the swarm
We are the ones you'll fear
We're the only voice of reason that you'll hear
No single one of us
Can think like all of us
We will find the world's wrongs
And we'll eradicate them all
We are the swarm

Underground and hidden from the daylight
It's our place to govern how we may
Show no mercy to the ones we've chosen as the prey
Just as long as something pays

We are one
A legion with no heart
Our faces out of sight
Our names are unknown
And the guilt will strike when you're alone
And turn your heart to stone

We are the swarm
We are the ones you'll fear
We're the only voice of reason that you'll hear
No single one of us
Can think like all of us
We will find the world's wrongs
And we'll eradicate them all
We are the swarm

When there's injustice
Or things that should not be
When word gets out that somewhere
Someone guilty is running free
We'll always find them
Through a million searching eyes
When there's something that we hate
That needs to die

We are one
A legion with no heart
Our faces out of sight
Our names are unknown
And the guilt will strike when you're alone
And turn your heart to stone

We are the swarm
We are the ones you'll fear
We're the only voice of reason that you'll hear
No single one of us
Can think like all of us
We will find the world's wrongs
And by our hands destroy them all

We're the front line
The only hope you have
And the world will change wherever we appear
Because no one of us
Is cruel as all of us
No remorse and no regret
We don't forgive, we don't forget
We are the swarm
We are the swarm
