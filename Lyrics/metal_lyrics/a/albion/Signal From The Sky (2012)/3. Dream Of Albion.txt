Taken far through the stars
For just a moment now
To a place that's better than your life
Ripped back out of that world
Your heart's still set on there
Blind to earth, and staring up to the sky

Wasting time
And missing life
Waiting forever for someone
To save them from all

And we sleep and keep on dreaming
As the world becomes our dying home
Know we have no future
As we sleep and dream of Albion

In the eyes of the world and all their perfect lives
We are death, invaders from the sky
You think that you've found unending paradise
Yet to learn this world was not meant for you

Lost in sleep
Eternally
You can't live your life by borrowing somebody's dream

And we sleep and keep on dreaming
As the world becomes our dying home
Know we have no future
As we sleep and dream of Albion

A false world that you chose
Stumbling through life with eyes closed
Wake up and realize you're alive

Out of the chaos of this world
New life is given birth
And we can build our own Albion
Right here with all the wonder of our earth

But we sleep and keep on dreaming
As the world becomes our dying home
Know we have no future
As we sleep and dream of Albion

We dream of Albion
Lifeless and cold as our world
We're trapped inside this dream forever
This dream of Albion
We dream of Albion
