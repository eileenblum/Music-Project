There was a time when I was scared like you
I clung to memories both bad and good
But then I saw a chance to live again
Born from the ending of a world

Hand in hand we travel on
Because you can't stay here afraid
Never knowing where we're going
On the one galactic train
An adventure through the universe
Beyond the bridge of stars
Till the call of earth
Will bring us back again

On our journey through the silent stars
I'll show you the wonders of the endless universe
We know that in the end
The sun will rise again
And tomorrow will be a good day

All too soon it was my time to leave
I never knew that you could be so hurt
And still you're hiding something deep inside
Beneath your hatred of the world

I have found a memory waiting
At the universe's end
A memento of a life cut short
The time we spent as friends
And now even though you turn your back
Deny I ever was
I remember you
And I'll be back again

On our journey through the silent stars
I'll show you the wonders of the endless universe
We know that in the end
The sun will rise again
And tomorrow will be a good day

This night
One holy night
On the galactic railroad
Only you can decide
When your journey ends

As we make our way
Across the astral plane
All our memories fly away
The sparks we leave behind
Will give the stars their shine
As our pain is washed away
Down the river we flow
Till there's nowhere to go
Then we fall to earth newborn
And live again

On our journey through the silent stars
I'll show you the wonders of the endless universe
We know that in the end
The sun will rise again
And tomorrow will come

Take my hand and then we'll fly away
I'll show you there's nothing left to be afraid of now
Up to the stars ascend
The story finally ends
And tomorrow we'll all meet again
