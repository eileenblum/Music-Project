From the shackles of the earth
We rise up to the realm of dreams
A path awakened in the sleeping sky
Found the keys for the eclipse
And flew away into the black
Past the Swan towards infinity

And while the moon is dark
We travel on hand in hand
Behind us the earth
Fades to black and disappears
Take a ride
And let the stars be your guide
Until the daybreak
We follow the planisphere

Across the bridge of stars
Towards a world never seen
For now you're free
On the wings of a dream
Beyond the borderlines
Ascending over the skies
Like diamonds we'll shine
In the ocean divine
Remember the day the night slept

Walking free again
Outside the tethers tied to you by death
A journey on towards the corners of imagination
Cross the river glowing bright
And as you find your way
Hold on to the map of obsidian

And while the moon is dark
I won't let go of your hand
Behind us the earth
Fades to black and disappears
Take a ride
And let the stars be your guide
Until the daybreak
We follow the planisphere

Across the bridge of stars
Towards a world never seen
For now you're free
On the wings of a dream
Beyond the borderlines
Ascending over the skies
Like diamonds we'll shine
In the ocean divine
Remember the day the night slept

On towards the southern cross
Through mystic constellations
I want this dream to last forever
The pathway down to earth
Will fade away behind us
And we'll be lost inside forever

I never want this night to end
Will we wake if morning comes again

Across the bridge of stars
Towards a world never seen
For now you're free
On the wings of a dream
Beyond the borderlines
Ascending over the skies
Like diamonds we'll shine
In the ocean divine
So remember the day

And while the sunlight sleeps
We can become anything
We're lost in dreams
On a quest for a king
On solar wings ascend
Imagine life without end
For the ghost, for the hunter
The migrant and king
For the sleepers beside us
All sharing the dream
Would you shatter the false star
And live once again
Remember the day the night slept
