Drawn to the false star of illusion
Like travellers before
But now it's time to leave the kingdom
To face the tainted throne

The king's in his palace
Vengeance and malice
Poison his heart and tie him down
We rise from confusion
Fight his delusion
Taking his undeserved crown

We're razing the kingdom
We'll burn down the lighthouse
A beacon of false hope for all
Completing the circle
Escaping the dreamworld
And this heaven shall fall
Tonight
We're sounding the cry
The kingdom will die
We'll pull back the curtain
And see through the lie
I'll burn in the night
I'll light up the sky
You'll see
And I'll be the scorpion's fire

Down in the dark well all alone now
The scorpion would die
No chance to give another creature
Just one more day of life

He prayed for his next birth
To give life to all earth
Lit up the sky in crimson glow
The end of this heaven
Echoes the legend
I am that scorpion now

We're razing the kingdom
We'll burn down the lighthouse
A beacon of false hope for all
Completing the circle
Escaping the dreamworld
And this heaven shall fall
Tonight
We're sounding the cry
The kingdom will die
We'll pull back the curtain
And see through the lie
I'll burn in the night
I'll light up the sky
You'll see
And I'll be the scorpion's fire

"And so the dream of the King
comes to an end with the story he loved,
and the light of the scorpion's fire will guide
those lost in the dark towards the dawn.
Behind him the false star shatters forever,
and the dreamers carry him on through the morning sky."

Welcome to the eclipse of the star
The grand illusion falling so far
On this night we shatter the lie
And we see the dawn again

We're razing the kingdom
We'll burn down the lighthouse
A beacon of hope for the blind
Completing the circle
Escaping the nightmare
And the secret we'd find
At last
The sins of the past
Tonight are unmasked
The haunting inside me
Will always outlast
We're close to the end
I promise, my friend
You'll see me again
I'm coming soon

We're razing the kingdom
We'll burn down the lighthouse
A beacon of false hope for all
Completing the circle
Escaping the dreamworld
And this heaven shall fall
Tonight
We're sounding the cry
The kingdom will die
We'll pull back the curtain
And see through the lie
I'll burn in the night
I'll light up the sky
You'll see
And I'll be the scorpion's fire

And the fire in the lighthouse will burn
And the kingdom of dreams will burn
For my friends once again I will burn
And the scorpion's fire will burn
