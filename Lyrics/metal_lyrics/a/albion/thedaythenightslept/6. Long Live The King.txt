He wished for death to take him
From the world of pain and hatred
And through a dark deception
Someone led him there
His final lie
"It won't be frightening if we go together"
Stayed with him
Even as he watched him steal his life

Woke on the train, afraid and lost
Not knowing where he's going
At light speed through the sky
The earth now out of sight
So at the signal he escaped
And found a room in darkness
A chair and candle in the black
With no one there

Afraid, alone
Betrayed by earth
He lights the flame
For this new world
A star is born
In false disguise
And soon
The kingdom will rise

And the candle turned to a lighthouse
In the heart of the kingdom of dreams
(The king said...)
No one is hurt
With everyone here
And if we all share one mind
There's no need to fear
And the beacon shone through the darkness
And attracted souls to the light
(And he said...)
One will be all
And all will be one
So let their voices in harmony sing
Long live the king

The lonely room became
A grand hall at the dream world's centre
His hurt became a crown
His chair became a throne
He waits to welcome
All the souls that stray from heaven's river
To warmth and safety
The new kings of everyone's home

So the migrants came to the lighthouse
In the heart of the kingdom of dreams
And the lonely king
Would welcome them in
Make them one, and never to leave
And the beacon shone through the darkness
And attracted souls to the light
All who came to his door
Would accept their new form
Join the chorus, and joyfully sing
Long live the king

Back and forth again
The pendulum of time
Keeping the dreamers
Here in their eternal night
Don't you leave me here
You should not fear the sun
Here in my private shell
Now we all are one

And so the star will shine
The candle is burning
Timeless and divine
And we see the light
All over the kingdom
Shining for all time
And the lighthouse
Will call out to guide
New souls towards the star
So they can join with us and sing
Long live the king
Happily ever after

Afraid, alone
Betrayed by earth
He lit the flame
For this new world
A star was born
In false disguise
And now
The kingdom will rise

Now the migrants come to the lighthouse
On their journey from skies afar
And the lonely king
Will welcome them in
And absorb them into the star
And the flame will shine on forever
Drawing souls to the kingdom of dreams
And no one will ever be lonely again
And as one they will joyfully sing
Long live the king
