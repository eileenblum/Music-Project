If you had the chance to reinvent yourself
Let go of the memories that remain
Have you ever wanted for another time
To leave the past behind and start again

If you had the chance to leave behind your life
Break free of your primitive dark shell
Craft your every wish of how you want to be
And take on a new form in a new world

We can make you better
Than you've ever been before
Never question why
You will never want to leave
But to wake up from the dream
You must only open your eyes

Overlook the falsehood that you've heard of us
Even though you've hated for so long
Don't you feel a secret doubt that's pushing you
A fascination telling you you're wrong

They taught you to despise
And told you all their lies
But we're here, we'll never let you go
Forget what you've heard
Unlearn what you have learned
The unreal is closer than you know

We can make you stronger
Than you've ever been before
Never question why
You will never want to leave
But to wake up from the dream
You must only open your eyes

Escape the walls that you built around yourself
The constructs of our normal world
Now you can find who you truly are inside
Don't be afraid to let them know

Open your heart
Open your mind
Spread the wings we've given you
And fly into the dream
Sanctuary you'll find
Your body left behind
Ready for the day you're back
If you return at all

Once you have tasted perfection
You will never want to return
Innocence and inhibition left far behind
You will never be alone

We can make you better
Than you've ever been before
Never question why
You will never want to leave
But to wake up from the dream
You must only open your eyes

We can make you perfect
Like you've never been before
You will never question why
But our world is just a dream
And if you wish for your return
You must only open your eyes
