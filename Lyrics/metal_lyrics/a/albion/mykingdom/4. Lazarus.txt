You are the one who never lived
Although I saw your every minute in my mind
The visions of your life I've seen
But now they're fading, you were never meant to die

The light of my obsession
A victim of oppression
Freedom you have earned
We made the world together
And it should be forever
You must now return

Now these memories won't let me
Live my life alone
This touch will heal your lifeless heart
Revive your broken bones
I will not let you rest in peace
While I have life to give
And through the power I have made
Forever you shall live

You are the one who freed my mind
You made me realize who I was through all this time
An icon of my fantasy
But all this time I didn't know that you could die

In time I heard your calling
And then I saw you falling
Into dreams so deep
And trapped in time I'll keep you
Until the day I reach you
Wake you from your deadly sleep

Now these memories won't let me
Live my life alone
This touch will heal your lifeless heart
Revive your broken bones
I will not let you rest in peace
While I have life to give
And through the power I have made
Forever you shall live

Through worlds divided
We'll be united
Infinity before you, forever in your wake
We shall be together
Still not forever
A fragment of your lifespan
For I am now the one who will die

Memories won't let me
Live my life alone
This touch will heal your lifeless heart
Revive your broken bones
I will not let you rest in peace
While I have life to give
And through the power I have made
Forever

I will reach you from the other side
The world that you have seen
Recognize my voice, open your eyes
And wake up from your dream
Then the fanfare will be heard
To let them know that you're alive
Scream the victory across the world
I brought you back to life
