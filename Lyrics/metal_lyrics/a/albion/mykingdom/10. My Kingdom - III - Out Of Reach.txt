There is a world that I can see
A place where I can never be
It's always near to me but never within reach

It is a world we'll never meet
Born to be perfect, without hate
Your outer form and inner beauty are the same

Rejected by the world
Accepted just in fantasy
A place where no one ever dies
And trapped by who I am
I must remain here on the ground
While my mind soars through the sky

Such a pleasant torture
I am shown it in my dreams
There is a place where I can never be
All the world before me
Seeing through another's eyes
And once again it fades away
I fade away

With no desire to be cruel
Disease and harm left far behind
To be a part of it, this heaven floods my mind

Rejected by the world
Accepted just in fantasy
A place where no one ever dies
And trapped by who I am
I must remain here on the ground
While my mind soars through the sky

Such a pleasant torture
I am shown it in my dreams
There is a place where I can never be
All the world before me
Seeing through another's eyes
And once again it fades away

And we share one eternity
Building the world in our hearts
We can capture infinity
And bring it to ourselves
