Fear is all I see
You were made to be controlled
Can't see the signs
But they're there for us all
Society of blame
We will go to any length
Where empathy is weakness
And cruelty is strength

And we wish for the world we cannot have
Wherever our minds are led
And we search for a way to leave this place
Where trust and truth are dead

You can never change
You were made to hate and fear
Can't see the light
Through your blindfolded eyes
No good deed goes unpunished
By your hatred and your greed
Your selfish way of thinking
Will never be erased

Responsibility is something
That you never had to learn
A world that taught you were a king
Proud of your ignorance
And feeding on the other people's fear
I see there's no place for me here

Rise above your cheating world
Defeat your misery
I will lead you by the hand
And show another way

Pity and sympathy are feelings
That you never had to learn
A world that taught you were a king
Proud of your gluttony
And feeding on the other people's grief
Am I the only one who sees

I will rise above your cheating world
Defeat this misery
And I will lead you by the hand
To show another way

If you can hear these words
Then I am not alone
If you're the same as me
Rise above and let yourself be known
