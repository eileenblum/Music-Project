Painted in my words
I outline their lives
Each one of them unique
A star behind my eyes

The passage to my mind
Locked for eternity
I will give you the key
To the kingdom I see
For if it's never found
Then the world dies with me

We are the leaders of our lives
Together we shall never die

At the end of the passage to my mind
There is a kingdom with an empty throne for years
Somewhere in time there is a place where we can be
Away from pain and fear

And in the end it will appear
The only sacrifice you'll make
A moment of your life
To leave your world behind
And finally you'll find
My kingdom
