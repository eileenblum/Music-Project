I came upon your world alone
The unreal planet that you owned
You taught me everything I know
You showed me life meant so much more
Than I had ever thought before
I saw a place where I belonged

Now we stand together
In the wasteland you have made
Twisted and distorted by your hand
I thought you and I
Our perfect worlds were the same
I thought you and I could understand
We're building a world from our hearts

I never knew of your intent
I followed others that you sent
Gave me the key to who I am
This is what you've made me through your words
You aren't what I thought at first
This tarnished heart of gold I have

Now I see the future
Of the world we had made
Twisted and distorted by your hand
I thought you and I
Our perfect worlds were the same
I thought you and I could understand

Oh, you said forever I'd be
Is this how perfection rewards me
Now the world I was promised
Has gone from my grasp
It fades to the past
Forever doesn't last

Now I'm out on my own
You showed me the way
The path through the endless skies
Now I am the one to find
I'll build my kingdom
In my own paradise

Now - I see the future
Of the world we had made
Twisted and distorted by your hand
I thought you and I
Our perfect worlds were the same
I thought you and I could understand

Oh, you said forever I'd be
Is this how perfection rewards me
Now the world I was promised
Has gone from my grasp
It fades to the past
Forever doesn't last

You said forever I'd be
Is this how perfection rewards me
Now the world I was promised
I've had to let go
I'll let them all know
Forever doesn't last
