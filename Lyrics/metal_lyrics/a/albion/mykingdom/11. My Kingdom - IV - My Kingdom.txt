Now I see I've found the place for me
No longer alone in the universe
Build me a world, so I am not alone

Giving them stories and souls of their own
I have the power to make anything I wish
I built paradise with my voice and my hands
A place that I can never show the world

But every time I am alone
I will return to my own kind
All that matters is my kingdom
And the world I made in my mind

Was I born to be the one I am
Am I a misplaced mind
For all the time I want to leave
My waking world behind

I wake in sunlight from a dream
And suddenly alone
What has happened to my kingdom
Take me back to where I belong
