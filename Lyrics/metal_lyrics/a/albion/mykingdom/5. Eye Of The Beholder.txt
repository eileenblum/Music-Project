Trapped in our corners of the world
And never coming out
We're falling deeper
Hiding behind our secret lives
For fear of them knowing who we are

The beauty of the world
Is not what you can see
But still you will attack what you don't know

I will be there to defend
I will save the others from their shame
To live and let live, in the end
In the eye of the beholder, we are all the same

Spreading their anger everywhere
Ignorance and hate is all I see
From all these places
Never give up, I'll stand forever
To save them from what I used to be

No matter what I do
There'll still be more of you
The ones who would destroy what they don't know
But no one was born to be less than you
Don't attack because of your own fear

I will be there to defend
I will save the others from your blame
To live and let live, in the end
In the eye of the beholder, we are all the same

If you won't stop the war
I'll fight forevermore
My words shall be my sword
As I defend this reality

I will be there to defend
I will save the others from your hate
To live and let live, in the end
In the eye of the beholder

I will always be there to defend
I will save the others from their shame
To live and let live, in the end
In the eye of the beholder, we are all the same

Eye of the beholder
Don't be afraid
Born to be the ones we are
Eye of the beholder
