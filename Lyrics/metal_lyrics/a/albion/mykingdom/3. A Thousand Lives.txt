A thousand lives to choose between
A million worlds in which to be
I watch your life, and though you aren't real
You can come back again and live my dream

You are a mystery - we'll never know where you exist
Such a proud enigma - as you look back at us

I have seen you all my life
Existing there instead of me
With each of you a gateway to a world I want to hide
And you appear again to follow me

As we see the perfect life you lead
You're a king in all the worlds you've seen
And the power of thought that we give you
Sustains your life behind the screen

A million of us watch your life
In your emotion we all share
Sides of good and evil, sides of right and wrong
Life is that simple for you there

You are a mystery - we'll never know where you exist
Such a proud enigma - as you look back at us

Savior of a thousand worlds
You can choose your time
I have seen you disappear and live again
And I see you, want to be you
But I know that in the end
We live a thousand worlds away

I want to be the hero of the hour
To be the star in everybody's eyes
And when they see my image running through the sky
Then they will know that I am still alive

[Instrumental: Canon in D]

Wouldn't you like to live as me
For just a day of your life
I'll let you taste the world you crave
For just a moment in time

I want to be the hero of the hour
To be the star in everybody's eyes
And when they see my image running through the sky
Then they will know that I am still alive

I want to be the hero of the hour
To be the star in everybody's eyes
And when they see my image running through the sky
Then they will know that I am still alive

The hero with a thousand lives
A hero who could never die
I see you running through the sky
But I must remain here
