I am a god in my own world
I am the maker of it all
No evil, no wrong can ever be done
No hatred, no conflict and no war

I have no form, I watch from the sky
Writing the future of your lives
Without my will, the world would die
I have it crafted in my mind

I'm the creator, I'm the one
Bringing to life a perfect dream
Somewhere to go when I'm alone
Somewhere only I can see

I have no form, I watch from the sky
Writing the future of your lives
I cannot join my own paradise
Watching you through my world's eyes

I am the one who gave you life
I have the power to create
You are the ones that I will guide
With my iron hand of fate

I have them all held in my head
People, the places and the time
So let me take you by the hand
Lead you to this world of mine

More than you could ever think to dream
Crafted by my hand
And yet you cannot know who I am
You will never understand

That I am the one who gave you life
I have the power to create
You are the ones that I will guide
With my iron hand...
I am the one who gave you life
I have the power to create
You are the ones that I will guide
With my iron hand of fate
Iron hand of fate
Iron hand of fate
