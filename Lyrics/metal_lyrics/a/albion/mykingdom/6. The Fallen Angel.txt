She came out of nowhere
We found her that day
Defenceless and helpless
On earth where she lay
How were we ever to know
The secret we'd find
Or the life - From the beginning
To be one of a kind

And the glow of the stars upon her skin
The light shining from the heart
A sign of the soul and mind within
Was sent to us from the stars

I am your angel, sent from the sky
Live with your hatred, suffer your lies
Watching your world, fearing your fall
How can I save you all

I have nothing but hatred
For those who destroy
The lives we were given
Our peace and our joy
Why must you hurt a life
That comes only one time
How can you harm a being
Made to be one of a kind

And the glow of the stars upon her skin
The light shining from the heart
A sign of the soul and mind within
Was sent to us from the stars

I am your angel, sent from the sky
Live with your hatred, suffer your lies
Watching your world, fearing your fall
How can I save you all

I will build a home for those rejected by the world
Place of perfect peace and understanding of ourselves
In my realm there will be unending tolerance of all
No matter who or where the pasts we came from were

Beautiful madness
Sign of my sadness
The violence you have known
Poisons your mind
There is a reason
For your rejection
A mind of perfect hatred
Lives and cannot ever be replaced

This world you crave
Perfect and free
Can never become true
For all your race
Jealous, they hate
The spirit lives in you

[Instrumental: Tarantella]

Born from hate, I can never create
A perfect paradise
The love of my mind I'll leave behind
The shell of my disguise
Now I see there can never exist
A perfect way to be
The hate of your kind I'll leave behind
And I will fade away

For no one will know
For no one will hear
I'll rise into darkness
And slowly disappear
And no one will find
And no one will see
The tale of this world
Or what it did to me

I am your angel, sent from the sky
Live with your hatred, suffer your lies
Trapped in your world, watching your fall
I'll never save you all

Dead to the world, I will be free
Gone from this time, returning some day
I will be there, lost and unseen
Hoping again to make a fallen angel's dream
