Time is running short for me
Even though I have so many years to live
I will die before I show
Everything I have to give

I create - while you destroy
And you hate - The life I have
Is it so different to want to let it go
I have a better world than you will ever know

I cannot live in two hearts at a time
This world is stealing my life
I have to choose - my life or the dream
As time goes by

I am trying to live two lives
In between the real and the imagination
I can see I'm out of time
It will never wait for me

I create - but I can never be
More than a ghost to them
To spend my whole life craving somewhere else
It is the greatest waste of all

I cannot live in two hearts at a time
This world is stealing my life
I have to choose - my life or the dream
As time goes by

I have only seen one half of this world
The slices of time that bring perfection to my mind
Will you show me how to live forever, coming back again
Before with the first light of day, I'll fade away

We all move between our different worlds
Perfection and reality
You can always wish to be somewhere else
But the most important time of your life is
Now
