There is good in this world if you know where to look
The wonders that you take for granted every day
So don't waste all your life waiting for this escape
Forever waiting for a world that can't be real

Was I born to be the one I am
Am I a misplaced mind...

We are bound to lead the lives we have
No matter where they are
I will use my time and be thankful now
That I am alive at all

I am no master, I'm no god
I have no power to give life
But power to create
I am the maker, I am here
And I can see my world now
I have to turn away

But in the end it will appear
The world I have seen in my dreams
The power of the mind
Desire of the heart
A place I'll never find
My kingdom
