Crown of the world
In the land of the free
We protect all those worthy
From the evil we see
We're steadfast and strong
With our walls made of gold
An invincible fortress
On the edge of the world

Blinded by freedom
With the world our own
We're standing in unity
The outside unknown
The best in the world
Unashamed of our pride
Ignoring the weak to bring
Perfection inside

We're the light of the world
Outside is a dream
So far from our lives and never seen

The gold of the walls will shut
The world outside
But allied with us
There is no reason to hide

And we don't need protection
We're bound by the light
There's no one that can contest our might

United in arms
How mighty we stand
An invincible fortress
On the edge of the land
There's nothing beyond
The mighty walls made of gold
Cause the edge of our fortress
Is the edge of the world

Let them know what they need
To defend liberty
Decide how they think, we're truly
Land of the free

Blind flags on the edge
To show all the world
The land in the fortress we hold

Proud of our land
With nothing to fear
No reason to venture
Beyond the walls here
There's nothing beyond
The mighty walls made of gold
We're all safe in our fortress
At the edge of the world

We shall come to lead the way
And the world knows we'll never fall
Standing tall above the dark
And we don't care what's beyond our walls

Standing behind
The barricade of gold
The edge of our fortress
Is the edge of our world
So may we live on
Forever we'll stand
An invincible fortress
On the edge of the land

(The edge of the world)
Guarded by light
With pride we all stand (Steadfast and strong)
An invincible fortress
On the edge of the land (Solid walls of gold)
There's nothing beyond
The mighty walls made of gold (Nowhere left to go)
Cause the edge of our fortress
Is the edge of the world (The edge of the world)
