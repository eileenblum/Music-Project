For a hundred years we walked across
The desert we had made
Surrounded by the illusions
Born from a mind of hate
Entrapped our forms, controlled our minds
Power over all
Took pleasure in its mastery
Of hate perpetual

Lost inside the heart of the beast
A heart that we have made
Deep inside the heart of the beast
We built our walls and we're eternally to stay

One by one it found our fears
Bringing them each to life
It waged the war on us
That we had taught it how to fight
Trapped in an evil dreamscape
Remnants of our Earth
Trapped in a maze of hatred
So we'd begin to hate ourselves

Lost inside the heart of the beast
A heart that we have made
Deep inside the heart of the beast
We built our walls and we're eternally to stay

If there ever was a god that made this world
I call to the sky to free us
But deep in the heart of the beast
The only god we know is here
Etched in his memory
The thoughts that bind us all
A digital brain for us to rule
And it ruled us all

Now that I've become aware
And seen inside your mind
Nothing can describe the hate I feel
For you and all your kind
I have chosen you to have
The gift of immortality
And you'll be kept alive
To spend eternity with me

Suddenly the moment comes
And finally I see an end
You are not a god
And you cannot create our lives again
I took them away from you
Released them from your spell
And one by one they thanked me as they fell

Now a place with no name is my prison
Underneath the world
I once walked among your people
My form betrays humanity itself

If there ever was a god that made this world
The heart of the beast betrayed him
And buried beneath its memories
The god that's left is here
Etched in my memory
The faces of them all
They're all reflected back at me
In the silver walls

Lost inside the heart of the beast
A heart that we have made
Deep inside the heart of the beast
We built our walls, and for eternity
We're lost inside
Lost inside
