I see it in reflections
The fortress made of gold
A memory kept in this heart
But my heart is cold
And even as we're falling
I see my life again
With every second that we have
We're closer to the end

At heroism's failure
A mighty world that fell
The ones we call our heroes
Not gods but men as well
And to dispel this ending
Of what we once called Earth
We can't wait for salvation
We have to save ourselves
