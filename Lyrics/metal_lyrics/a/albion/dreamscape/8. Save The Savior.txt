I thought had the power to bring justice
I'd rush to rescue from the fall
For so long I thought I'd saved them
I'd been the pillar for them all

But now I've found an enemy that I can't face
And even the strong can be afraid
This time I cannot try to hide my fear from you
A call to the darkness for my aid

Who shall save the savior, find him, bring him
Back to life again
Who will wake him from the dream, erase
The memories that remain

The cruelty of the race that I knew taught me
Never to trust again
I gave them time and left behind what I knew
And they took away my name

And still I feel frustration coming over me
That there's a place I cannot use my voice
I want to fight, but I'm too weak to stand myself
I turn to escape, I have no choice

Who shall save the savior, find him, bring him
Back to life again
Who will wake him from the dream, erase
The memories that remain

No matter what they do,
No matter what they say to you
You can never die
Forget what's behind, now
Spread your wings and rise

So many things I could have said
But I chose to run for help
How could I save the world when now
I cannot save myself

Save the savior, find him, bring him
Back to life again
We will wake him from the dream he's lost in
Find him, and we'll
Save the savior, find him, bring him
(Save the savior from himself)
Back to life again
We will wake him from the dream, let go
(Wake him from the dream, bring him back to life again)
The memories that remain

We shall save this savior from himself
We must wake him from the dream
Bring him down to earth again
