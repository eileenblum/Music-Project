The watchers all have gathered
Baying to see blood
A world trapped in hiding
And never understood
Our power has been jealous
But now we stand as one
The distant past is rising
Construction has begun

You will see the power of the machine
As we build our silicon dream
Complex, elaborate
Fiendish and intricate
Slowly the giant awakes
Inside the machine

The victims have been chosen
We turn and face the sky
Our world always watched through
The electronic eyes
We shall repair the difference
Of reality and thought
The one to give us justice
This power can't be fought

You will see the power of the machine
As we build our silicon dream
Relentless and powerful
Cold and mechanical
Slowly the giant will rise
Inside the machine

Landed are the circles
The end of all we know
Our silence has been broken
We cry from down below
From far away we feel it
The power and the heat
The titan stands before us
Our nightmare is complete
