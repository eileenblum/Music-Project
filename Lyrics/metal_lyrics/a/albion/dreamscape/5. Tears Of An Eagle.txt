Look up to the fortress that stands on the hill
Walls of gold surrounding the core
On the tower the statue, an eagle, stands tall
The symbol of freedom and justice for all
Its eyes watching over utopian land
The only defence from hostile hands

We walk up the path to the blank golden walls
The city lies in sleep
A robed figure watches, he sees what's to come
And turning away, begins to weep

And as we approach the city of gold
Lightning flashes from on high
We shield our eyes from the blinding light
As the wind howls from the sky
For a moment there's darkness, the city awakes
With a sudden piercing cry
And as we watch the fortress splits apart
Torn by fire from the sky

On the edge of the light we see them
As from the earth they rise
Their metal skin reflects the light
And shows their lifeless eyes
As one by one they take their place
They form a perfect ring
A wall of metal creatures that
Begins to close us in

The beings march towards the light
With no remorse or feel
And in their wake they leave the ground
Cold and hard as steel

The hero who could never cry
The leader of us all
Once proud, the life gone from his eyes
His crown replaced by thorns
The tears of an eagle
Fallen from the sky
A future that we never had
The lives we had will die

The glow fades from the fragments
Scattered all around
The statue of the eagle
Lies shattered on the ground

Oppressors take the people
And they mark them with their seal
Their flesh turned in to silicon
Their skin to lifeless steel

Aged, greyed and broken
His bravery torn down
The future of this world lost
The thorns replace his crown
Our guardian lies sleeping
The fallen fortress torn
The pride that we had in us is gone

Join us now in victory of metal
All shall hail the tyranny of steel
Join us now in victory of metal
All shall hail the tyranny of steel
Join us now and become one of us
Leave your life behind

With the tears of an eagle, guardian of light
We saw the mighty fall from the sky
And yield to the night
Tears of an eagle, guardian of light
We saw the mighty fall from the sky
Give in to the night

I was the eagle, wings torn away
Only able to watch as my people were taken away
Helpless, defenceless, it seemed like the end
But some day I wish to fly again

The hero who could never cry
The leader of us all
Once proud, the life gone from his eyes
His crown replaced by thorns
The tears of an eagle
Fallen from the sky
The pride of all our world is gone
I saw him, he was

Aged, greyed and broken
His bravery torn down
The future of this world lost
The thorns replace his crown
And many people stand by us
The faces that we've seen
Each one of them now marked to be
A part of the machine

I was watching them all leave me
They thought that I had died
Alone and in the darkness now
But I am still alive
And leaving back on the ground
The tears that I've cried
I'll rise to soar high once again
The eagle will fly
