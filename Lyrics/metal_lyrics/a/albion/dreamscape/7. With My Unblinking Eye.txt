Too much injustice in the world
Is there a way to fight it all
Too many times I've been afraid
And let the evil take control

But I don't have the power to see
Watching the world from the ground
And I wish for the courage and strength to heal
The injustice I see all around

With my unblinking eye
I will watch from on high
As long as injustice remains
From the hatred and lies
Of the world I will rise
And give them their lives back again
With my unblinking eye

My eye has seen all of the world
And all the suffering of our race
I'll bring an ending to it all
When in the sky I take my place

And I will have the power to see
Watching over them down on the ground
And I will use the strength I've been given to heal
The injustice I see all around

With my unblinking eye
I will watch from on high
As long as injustice remains
From the hatred and lies
Of the world I will rise
And give them their lives back again

And as long as injustice remains
I'll give them their lives back again
The eye watches over the whole of the world
It sees the injustice and pain

And I'll watch over the world
Setting the innocent free
But after all have been saved
Then who shall save me?

With my unblinking eye
I will watch from on high
As long as injustice remains
From the hatred and lies
Of the world I will rise
And give them their lives back again

Unblinking eye - As long as injustice remains
Unblinking eye - I'll give them their lives back again
Unblinking eye - The eye watching over the world
Unblinking eye
