A cry for help in the darkness
That marks our slow descent
Alone and lost, we're abandoned
Our world near its end

Our will is weak, our strength is gone
Will they hear our call
The hour is near, time is short
Who will save us all

Take me back in time
To the beginning of it all
We can change our history
Save us before the moon falls

Somewhere we saw a sign
Of what our future could have held
But here we stand, not long before
The light fades from our world

Oppression, malevolence
No chance to reply
We turn towards the growing light that
Threatens from the sky

Take me to the sacred place
To the glowing source of all
We can change our history
Save us before the end
Save us before the moon falls

Come and save us
Come and save us all

Come with me through time and space
To the ending of it all
We can change our history
Save us before the moon falls, oh
Come with me through time and space
To the ending of it all
We can change our destiny
Save us before the end
Save us before the moon falls
