Over the horizon we have come
We meet at last, our journey done
We left our legend in our wake
Out of all the worlds around our sun
There was a force that made us one
We had the power to create

For so long I thought I was alone
But together there's no need to hide
I gave them their mind and you gave them their spirit
Together we brought them to life

We are the ones, the world will revive
Follow me and we shall be the leaders of our lives
Reforge the world, united we stand
Created by a worldcrafter's hand

Guarded by our minds, we all had brought
The confidence to share our thoughts
A crafted haven we had made
Others who were hiding heard the sound
To follow us they left the ground
Came to the beacon that we laid

We created a world from the start
From the fire in our thunderous hearts
Only here for a time, but to lengthen our lives
Through our stories, we shall never die

We are the ones, the world will revive
Follow me and we shall be the leaders of our lives
Reforge the world, united we stand
Created by a worldcrafter's hand

Through the darkness our voices will flow
We've the seeds of a world to sow
And holding this power, our hearts and our minds are
The hands of a maker of worlds

We are the ones, the world will revive
Follow me and we shall be the leaders of our lives
Reforge the world, united we stand
Created by a worldcrafter's hand
Soon it will come, the world will revive
Hold your head up proud to be the leader of your life
Reforge the world, together we stand
United by a worldcrafter's hand
