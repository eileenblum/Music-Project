We illumed by light of lore
We search it in the scrolls
Etched by magi of yore
And covered by eternal glory

The ignorance slayeth us rapidly
We obey the mad crowd's desires
And stride like lambs after shepherd
By the direct way toward infernal fires

Oh, ancient spirit of dear mother earth
Dost thou say to resign to this fate?
The day when we born, let woe worth
And love that we properly hate
But we don't want!!!

Supreme power of the wisdom,
Eternal life that praised in tales,
To enlighten our kingdom,
It's our craving arcane grail!

Supreme power of the valour,
Eternal life that praised in tales,
To enlighten our failures,
It's our craving arcane grail!

Gules blood courseth in our flesh
Its incoagulable drops fed by the Sun
When she oozeth from wounds,
And with pacified glee we have sung

Sunlight consoleth our hearts
When the rue overwhelmeth it
Do guard us; demolish,
Ye, the Empyrean Powers,
The ghastful opaque in the wit

Sunlight consoleth our hearts
When the rue overwhelmeth it
Revived be and polish
The christian liars --
The rightful attack on the weak!

We are destined to wield the mighty strength
If we can endure the lures of the seven sins
And pass through the ninth gate of Hell

Pharisees that rule this world
(Whose breath erelong get burned
and whose indwellers' damned by Lord)
Make us to be as everyone
But we obtest that to be like Gods is so much sweet,
(And this) warfare we won!

Because we have a stable right
To militate into the fray of fight!

'Tis our Arcane Grail!
'Tis our Arcane Grail!
'Tis our Arcane Grail!
Arcane
Grail!!!

...to cognize the entity of God
It is our craving Arcane Grail!
