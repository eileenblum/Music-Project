There's a chain that is controlling what you do
There's a sin in the beliefs you love
But again you just see what you want to
Live in a hell, keep it inside
So on one can see it
All the good thoughts don't have sense to a life
In vain
Faith, it can't remember your face

I'm seeking the respect that I never had for myself

Your rise and fall
Is what you deserve
You'll die a liar
Chasing your pathetic truth
Here no one can stand the pride
That you exposed with so much light
You abused it

That's why I'll take mine
You'll find something to say too

So it was proven you're nothing new
Denied by pardon
Taste the weight
Of abandonment
An empty shell renewed
By cursed desires
That will bring it to
Nowhere
You waited 'til the end
Hoping to be absolved

There's no sorrow to feel, to see

I know you said
It was to feel
To see
What was left
Left of my scene
This is my last scene

Waste, waste the promise
Of the pure
Burning remembrance of the gone
Give a motive to the wreck
You've taken the null and braced regress
Waste, waste the promise
Of the pure
Burning remembrance of the gone
Give a motive to the wreck
You've taken the null and braced regress

If I move now
I'll be seen clearly
Starving (all along) enough to remind me
I'm so far, so far away cause I can take all
And burn it with my sins

Bless the livings that have a dream
Souls awakened for the wills, for the purposes
Drop the guilt of all the misdeeds
There's a vision, it's to bear
It's to realize
There's a meaning in the burden
Put commitment in the time that's been gifted you
Ban the languished unconsciousness
Grant the knowledge, it's for them
It's for everyone

Time stands still, while failure rises here
And time killed (we hang on) these unread best intents
