Hate grows
Breaking hearts
Beg and supplicate
But there's no forgiving sins of all the dreams you stole

You're the same old song
Bitter smile in heart
Cause no one can
Let the tidal waves go their way
In this unkind goodbye

Suffering till no emotions
Can sense hope, they gifted you
A black heart
Are they gone to see the end?

These kind of eyes wide move in my way
Somehow you blow all the reasons away
These faults, all these tears
Won't bring me back today
All these lies that I left behind

Time figures that you're wrong
Can't you see?
Bring all your lies to me
Bring them
Why don't you want to put this to an end?
(What of the vow we had?)
Liar

Wait to swear
You don't know a thing about it
I owe you nothing more
Fainted heart

She walks as if the rain proceeds few steps behind her
She moves with all the winds and all the clouds upon her
She beats time to the tidal wave
Choosing moments, rhythm of my breath

Accept the loneliness
Give her a chance
Choosing moments

And she calls me with no name,
And she finds so hard to stay here,
Will all these middle times give us a will?
Cause there's more than a way
But without you there's no other side

Back in her sleepless nightmares
She sucks the pain
When do I make her know that she's rid?
Draw them a portrait of suspicion
For you
If I died would you say what you did for me?
And nothing more, and nothing more
But what rests today makes a follower
They are nothing to me
