Safeguard of saints
It wasn't mentioned
The world today's not the same
Take what you wanted
There won't be anyone complaining today

When all these voices have come to life
And all these voices
They all are lying
They all lied

Whispering shapes of grief
As my faith runs out of me
And you took the weight of centuries
Tear up your grace
Tear up your grace
And stare at eyes of the one that wants to know

But it's something
Lost in nothing
I see the way, I see the way, I see the way she dives in the water
But I'm far from seeing the way she melts in the ocean
(She melts with the oceans)
The lighthouse could lead me where
The faith drowns untouched but
I'm still here
Today, today again
This won't mean anything to me

Now the price of safer ways
I assumed was easy to forget
Is a path made of stones for my knees
If tonight is restless I'll confuse the passing
(Seeing no)
Seeing no seasons
The lowest flight inside the space beneath heaven
Before it crushes me down
All I seek is redemption
For the change
I want to be remembered (for)
