These doubts have come to an end
The past speaks words of your shame, going on
As you were longing to see our fall
The bonds we shared faded in tears
My forgiveness is over
The stab in my back is a gift of trust

We miss the most when everything is lost
(I) Forgot the hide where I used to put all my laws
And I still think you messed up everything
(How could you give
Our dreams to the vultures?)
And I can't go on to be the one who signs seconds to sunrise

Minutes become hours when you wait, hope and regret

And I'm..
The sharpest witness of movements under the new year's sun
(On the day, on the day you neglected us under the sun)
So will I ever have
(So will I have stars on the bottom of a lost universe)
The largest vision of what is changing (what has changed)
And what is done (done for)
So try and hide the sun
(Try to hide it)

Drag your
Conscience down
My forgiveness is over for you, left when I most needed hope.
