Standstill at your tomb
As silence eat your lungs
New life grows into me
Condemning what your love never did
Confessions of dim sounds
Will come surrounding
You and your blank lights
Through black dead dawns
Rivers of true passion will flow in our eyes (now)
Lines of scarlet blood won't control (my) intentions
On this day
But there's no light aligned
To show the heaven
There's no turning back
Burnt lips yell at what you only need
God's last death
And rise again
To embrace the life that flows
(There's no way for you)
Time collapsed in your arms
Before you took this tight will â hanged
On my neck
Reason flows
In your fearless wounds
Ten years passed by
As we spelled words of disbelief
(Gone)
Wait here they'll come
Seeking all the pride you've left
Time erased what I can't forget
Demon's love faded
Through your veins
Stars are God's trophy
Could I ever see his great design
