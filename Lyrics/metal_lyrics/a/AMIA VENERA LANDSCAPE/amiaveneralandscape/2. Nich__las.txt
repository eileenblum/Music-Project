There's a chain that is controlling what you do
There's a sin in the beliefs you love.
But again you just see what you want to
Live in a hell, keep it inside
So no one can see it.
All the good thoughts don't have sense to a life in vain.
Faith, it can't remember your face.

I'm seeking the respect that I never had for myself.

Your rise and fall
Is what you deserve
You'll die a liar
Chasing your pathetic truth
Here no one can stand the pride
That you exposed with so much light.
You abused it.

That's why I'll take mine
You'll find something to say too.

So it was proven your nothing new
Denied by pardon
Taste the weight
Of abandonment
An empty shell renewed
By cursed desires
That will bring it to nowhere.
You waited till the end
Hoping to be absolved.

There's no sorrow to feel, to see.

I know you said
It was to feel
To see
What was left,
Left of my scene.

This is my last scene.

Waste, waste the promise of the pure.
Burning remembrance of the gone
Give a motive to the wreck
You've taken the null and braced regress.

If I
Move now
I'll be
Seen clearly
Starving (all along)
Enough to
Remind me
I'm so far, so far away
'cause I can take all
And burn it with my sins.

Bless the livings that have a dream
Souls awakened for the wills for the purposes
Drop the guilt of all the misdeeds
There's a vision, it's to bear
It's to realize
There's a meaning in the burden
Put commitment in the time that's been gifted you
Ban the languished unconsciousness
Grant the knowledge, it's for them
It's for everyone.

Time stands still while failure rises here
And time killed (we hang on) these unread best intents.
