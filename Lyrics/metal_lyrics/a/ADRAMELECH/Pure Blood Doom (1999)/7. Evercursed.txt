Every cursed night
I dwell beneath the sea...
My mind like clay
in the claws of insanity...

Every cursed night
I share the nightmare
of the Thing that sleeps
so that we may live...

Dreams from beneath the sea
Dreams from under the sand

Every cursed night
I share the nightmare...
Nightmares that bring sickness
and fever that causes dreams...

Every sickly morning
awakened by my own scream
I already dread the dusk
and the call of R'lyeh...
