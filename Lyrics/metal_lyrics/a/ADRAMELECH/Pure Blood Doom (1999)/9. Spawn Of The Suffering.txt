Altars of filth
shrines of sin
the whoring angel
standing tall

With violent craving penetrate the flesh
with urges untold, pierce the soul
driven like a nail through your dreams
where you exist, is where the pain lives

Divine, covetous
deviate being
outrageous, lustful
rise from the shroud

What heaven forbid, is what I claim
unshameful, godless creatures
infiltrate my being
Savage desires burn with strength
unstoppable
Take over my body

My wrath is awakened,
and soon to be killing
hateful seed,
spawn of the suffering
the righteous ones
witness their own torment
as the scythe is wielding
