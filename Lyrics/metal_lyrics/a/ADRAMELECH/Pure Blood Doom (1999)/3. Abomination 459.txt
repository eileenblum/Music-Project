The one of the laughter,
the one of the sign
and the father of all the hornless ones:
The Way, the Key, and the Call...

...They were, they are
they shall be again;
Mankind, their dream
and they shall awake...

Egregore's throne
in the void of black planets:
Flutes of amorphous idiots,
Wailing to the end of time.

The blind mad one,
center of chaos:
Call to the primordial slime
to reach for the stars...

Master of dimensions,
Creation of forbidden union;
gangrenous green terror,
soul-eater abomination

The Unsleeping One,
the black herald of abyss:
Rider of the nightwinds
and messenger of ancient dreams...
