Binded into darkness, the light of night dark,thousand wounds bleeding to the sea below seas,Beyond the gates, dead immortals sleep, scattered dreamless slumber; stalked, torn and slain. Without her powers, powers of upper worlds; victim of dead stare of the faceless gods Beyond the gates the queen of heaven slain by sixty, torn by seven Her sisters death, Ereshkigal rejoicing, the queen of graves in the house of dead Ceasing procreation, as the mortals feel the gods fearÂ as the doors of Ganzir close behind the morning star
