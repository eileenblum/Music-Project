For thc city
And thc greed of the king
Impulse to be supreme
To dominate Sumer

Rivalry of the city-states
Battle hardened veterans
Land between the two rivers
Theatre of war

The kings of Sumer
With their helmeted warriors
Armed with spears
Trampling their enemies

Constant wars
Millenniums of misery
Justified slavery
Gods given victory

See the flash of blade
Grotesque execution
Soldiers bleeding
Lying on the ground
