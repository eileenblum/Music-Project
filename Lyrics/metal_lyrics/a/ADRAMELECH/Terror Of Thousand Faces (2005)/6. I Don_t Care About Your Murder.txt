I don't care if they cut your throat
If you art a victim I don't cart if they rape your soul
If you arc on your own

What a fuck are you thinking of
That you are some kind of God of all
What a fuck are you waiting for
Just spit out your blood

I don't care about your murder

1 don't care if you are tortured
You have deserved this pain
I know your life can't be saved
I am pure insane

Torture
Bloodsed
Killing
Satisfies me

The Death is spreading in your veins
You are out of control
You won't see the sun go down
You are out of control

I don't care about your murder
