Opener of the ways
Snakehair of the warning moon
Queen of thee dead sky,
Earth and underworld

Samhain her power unleashed
Hear the hounds howl
Feel the winds of destruction
As she hunts by night the Triple Goddess
Lycanthropic fangs
Mane flowing in the storm cold reptilian stare

Scream of the hooded crone
Snarling wolfhead bitch
Nightmare illusions as she rides the storm

Where three ways meet the Dark
Goddess worshipped with reddened knife
And soil dog blood for Enodia

She who encounters you
Lady of suicide
Archetypal darkness
Terror of thousand faces

Corpse devourer of the night
Calls to the grave raise,
Spirits of the dead to haunt those left behind.
