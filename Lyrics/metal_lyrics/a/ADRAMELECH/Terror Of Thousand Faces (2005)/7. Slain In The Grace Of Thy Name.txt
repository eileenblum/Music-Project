Hypocrite machine of greed
Healing the leprosy of the south
Tearing souls pure
From the flesh corrupted

Forty days of murder
Salvation with blood
Century of holy flames
Light the path of heresy eraser

Force will prevail
Where blessings failed
Feel the harsh love of god
In flame and blade

Genocide in the name of god
Monopoly of faith protected
Voracious pilgrimage of brutality sanctified
Dissenter extermination
Baptism of fire and blood
Nation put at stake
Return of dark age of Christ

Erecutioners and martyrs
Slaves of the same god
Choose your own from those
Slain in the grace of thy name..
