Moon-god Thoth patron of wisdom
keeper of the records and the spokesman of the gods

Faithful to his master murdered by Set
with incantations contributes to his resurrection

The wizier of Horus successor to the throne
endowed with wisdom - lord of holy words

The earthly ruler ascends to the skies
to weight the hearts of the mortal ones

Arbiter of the divine
in the scenes of coronation
