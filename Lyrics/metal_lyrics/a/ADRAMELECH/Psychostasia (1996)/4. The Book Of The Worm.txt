Say the word that is never spoken
call the Goddess whom none worshipped
lay forth the bread for the Dead One
she that comes in a sunken boat

Read the words that were never written
learn the prayers better not known
know the times when the Fiendslayer sleeps
and call the Abominations from without

Call forth the Thing that cannot be summoned
stir the slumber of the Sleeping Lord
worship the corpse dead but dreaming
and be spared at the time of the Ancient Worm

Find the key to the lockless Gate
hear the echoes of Dog Gods soundless laughter
know the dreams of Those Who Never Sleep
as the world unnatural is finally united.
