Well, driven through the depths of darkness
Travelling the course of 4711

Another age has begun â fleshless soul will overcome
Dead shall be everyone â come and fear our loaded nuclear gun

The shadow troops arrived to bring death â unleashing a furious madness

Another age has begun â fleshless soul will overcome
Dead shall be everyone â come and fear our loaded nuclear gun

Rain of ashes will cover-the last flesh across the bloody fields
Our dying breed will settle down a take the crown
This bleeding ground under the flag of nuclear horizons

Another age has begun â fleshless soul will overcome
Dead shall be everyone â come and fear our loaded nuclear gun

Rain of ashes will cover â the last flesh across the bloody fields
