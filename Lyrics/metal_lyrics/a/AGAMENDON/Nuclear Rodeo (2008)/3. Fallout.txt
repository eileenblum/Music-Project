This is a story of mankind's fall. it came suddenly and was totally unexpected
The end was more grateful than nostradamus could ever predict

The siege has ended nothing is left â the burning horizon reminds at the left
Most life has been taken â dead bodies awaken
Skyline got a radical change â designed by architects of pain
Onslaught at very close range â rang the bells of hell

Mutate to a new type of sick existence
Reproduction of the few â formed zombifield resistance

Gathering forces are boiling the water â mutation and evil now summon the slaughter
Scrutinized, traumatized, realized â splattered guts and rotting hearts
Disevolution continued and brutally speeded up
One hundred thousand years wiped out by
Correlation between elements â and strangers death tech
Mother earth and mankind tortured â by alien's mashinized rapes
Excrescences grew on â bodies changed physical shape

Mutate to a new type of sick existence
Reproduction of the few â formed zombifield resistance
