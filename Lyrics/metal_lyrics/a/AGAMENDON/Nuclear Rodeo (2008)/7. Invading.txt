Turn around and see â what was never meant tob e
Thousand dead man walk â spitting blood out when they talk
Walking line in line â preparing for final decisions
Rotten flesh forms new design â on the edge of madness

I hear their screams â inside my dreams
They've taken my â ability even to cry

Can't you see â attractive for worms you will be
Smell of death is in the air â there was no time to prepare
Walking line in line- preparing for final decisions
Rotten flesh forms new design â surrounded by sadness

I hear their screams â inside my dreams
They've taken my â ability even to cry

Dying line in line â loosing the final decision
Rotten flesh forms new design â on the edge of madness

I hear their screams â inside my dreams
They've taken my â ability even to cry
