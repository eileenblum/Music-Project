Clouds are shattering the sky â a new born chaos rules the earth
One drop, no stop
Open the gates to fallow existence â open the graves to reveal our escape
Last above the surface we're victims â tell me why

As we drown ourselves into the flood it seems so calm inside
The deeper we fall the stronger we grow

Under water

As we drown ourselves into the flood it seems so calm inside
The deeper we fall the stronger we grow

One drop, no stop
Open the gates to fallow existence â open the graves to reveal our escape
