Don't let them ever see the light again
Don't get in touch with this warfilled ground
Don't you hear the signs â they're calling us

Conclusion to send us all down â decisions we're made to conquer the crown
Conclusion to send us all down â decisions we're made to conquer the crown

Step into an unknown future
It won't take long â it won't be far away

Conclusion to send us all down â decisions we're made to conquer the crown

As the last ones follow the way down to their fate
You stand alone â asking yourself how
It feels to stay alive
In a world you can't survive
