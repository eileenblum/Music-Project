Light will spiral
finding pieces in this whole slow-motion plot.

Iâll define time
by the arrangement of dynamic knots,
shriveled eyes.

Feel the surrounding night-veil
conquering the lies within my skin
reaching out,
coming down.

I feel it alive
the fire
the hindsight flowing,
breathing down my neck.

Liquid lies
all boiling down to hate.

I will hide from
this lucid dreaming inside-hope, all motion stops.

Lest we fall down,
imprisoned in circles again
clinging to the past.

Long is the way
but time comes,
building inertia
is breaking down the chains,
clarity ensues.

Light will die.

Leaving the linear times,
discard
and merge with it.
