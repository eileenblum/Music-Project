Dwelling in the outskirts of this grand scheme,
moments of doubt interspersed
by sudden flashes of clarity,
a constant emotional give and take.

Completely cut-off from reality,
tired of the fear caused by routine.

Desperation leaking through soft joint tissues,
thereâs a coward inside this terminal being.

The anguish of admitting I was wrong,
virulent behaviours,
no space between this bars
implosive thoughts will consume everything,
the conquer of negative space.

If every vibration is not unified
the will to go on will slowly fade,
elusive hidden solution
inside this tragedy of logic.
