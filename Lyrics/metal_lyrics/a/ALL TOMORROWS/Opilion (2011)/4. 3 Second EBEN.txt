Theyâve been watching for a long time, I can feel them inside my spine.
Oppressing eyes, oppressing hand, I must get out.

They donât care when, out of nowhere, this has been going on for too long.
Now its my time to see, not to cover my eyes.

No, I wonât fade
No, I canât fade in the process

Behind the cortex, they trick you.

Beside me the maggot-believers,
manipulated lives devoid of thoughts,
deciever, I have outgrown the way
I found my call.
Behind me, the records of the earth stand tall
I feel it
I will confront their minds and call their lies.

No, I wonât fade
No, wonât fade in the process

Behind the cortex, they trick you
but from mind-ashes, my thoughts are reborn.

Beside me the maggot-believers,
manipulated lives devoid of thoughts,
deciever, I have outgrown the way
I found my call.
Behind me, the records of the earth stand tall
I feel it,
I will confront their minds and call their lies.
