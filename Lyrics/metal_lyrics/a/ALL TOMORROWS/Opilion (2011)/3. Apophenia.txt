In this chaotic mess
we are but isolated cells
craving meaning
synesthetic larvaes, searching for control.

Insignificant micro patterns
creating such wide array
of turmoil in our lives
the noise becomes the signal

Our search for answers
will soon enough
find a way out
residual resonance â a trap

Betray

Itself

Strained

Dead-end neuronal interference

Because you were led â far astray
by the nightmare of perception
haunting my eye.

Because if this pain â heightens my sight
Iâll seek the clouds that are in your mind
hiding from the magnetism of the light.
