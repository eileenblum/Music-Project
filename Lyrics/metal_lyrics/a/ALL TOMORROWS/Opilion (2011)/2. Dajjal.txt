I will speak behind the face of god
feed me confrontation and lies,
blind congregation of fear
flow with contradiction this time.

In this chaos I dance and you will see that I will thrive.

Come to disbelief you will never be alone with me, whatever comes, I will seek the sick.
Low enough for me this is what youâve become, Iâll die denying the light.

I am a scream inside imploring pain, override will with every doubt in your mind and I will lie Iâll lie in every tongue known to man, you will never see light as long as I am alive.
You will not see the light, you will never see the light.
With darkness feed me.

Come to disbelief you will never be alone with me, whatever comes, I will seek the sick.
Low enough for me this is what youâve become, Iâll die denying the light.

I will give you the truth first, I will show you the chariots, inside there will be cowards, masquerading messiah.

Growing veil of deception leaking through your decisions, climb you famished truth seekers, and I will slash your hopesâ¦

I will crush your mind.
