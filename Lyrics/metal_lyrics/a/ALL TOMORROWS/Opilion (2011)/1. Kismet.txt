There is and will be,
the net can stretch but it will never budge.
Thoughts are decieving, when reaction and action becomes part of the play.

Moments are pillars
eternal memories.

The language of the acts spits threads.

Waiting to dive in, Iâve been spreading through time beneath the crust of space.

Straight into the silver
array that causes tomorrow,
The way that takes me to intuitive fear.

Waiting waiting to dive inâ¦

Spread into the silver
array that causes tomorrow.

Climbing, reaching ahead thereâs no way to grasp this infinite path laid before me now.
My skin is turning to light, I cannot contain the fact that our life is nothing but exo-esqueleton external consequence of higher densities.

Each utopian step forward opening our eyes.
