It's all
a part of it
we were not born
to see
layering all
the membrane
the tissue
the infinite thought
out of time source
eternal course
of chromatic infinity

I am mapping the unfolded ways
to extend our sight
(all condensed in me)

Searching ever deeper inside
I need to free myself

I find my inner silence
I am at peace
I know that one day
we will tune our lives

I send a message to the stars
waiting for the wave back
our brothers hear us
we're not alone
we're not connected yet
our spirits' net
