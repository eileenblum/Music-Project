Endemic blindness I witness
through out this
our lavish land

In dire need for the wondrous
the fire, fire of life
these candles lack

The time when we walked light
and mapped every star
gone

Living in madness
this cell, our body begins to fade
what we see as decay
is but freedom shining through

As light
intangible
we see
but fail to keep

Our lives
amount to nothing
the downpour of time
wash our wretched skin

Our only goal
building up
to learn how meaningless
fear is.

We fade.
