I am the filter of life
Iam the one that takes the plunge
Eternal giver
Unpinishable
Decider
a cleaner of blight
I forgive you all
Banisher of sins
Saviour

In a plague disguise
it's felt but not understood
they must comprehen in the flesh
it is the shivers you get
the split second of bliss inside
bearing this genocide

For a moment your reflection
in these, my seas of blood
washes away your doubt
what is warmth
lifting me up

It's felt but no understood
they must comprehenin the flesh
it is the shivers you get
the split second of bliss inside
it is the shivers you get
in time 
trough this undying seasons
I'm here for those of you falling apart 

Let me be...
Let me be your hidden helping hand
Let me decide...
Your part in this game

Let me be...
Your hidden helping hand
Let me decide..
Your part in this our blessed 
Game of life!
