Escape from the hurt
and create to destroy
disperse my gleaming scars
so far apart,
their warmth filling the voids
it's all seen, but not felt
I'm just getting delayed stills
of futures not mine.

So much time
unexistent acts
a play deviating my senses
the last chance, my heart above
reaching desperately
balance never attained.

Giving out
each time burning higher
never-lasting
If I cannot have it
by my fire you will all burn.

A faded picture
I never saw;
there it sat,
at the brink of existence,
I fell
on broken days.

Black dew from their lies
gathering a coming storm
the spark
make them cry by my hands

Ghost of marble skin
trick me and shift with colours
leaving my altars
plundered and cracked.

Giving out
each time burning higher
never-lasting
If I cannot have it
by my fire you will all burn.

Unfilled pieces, daydreams
of tired eyes.
slit my mouth,
and fool these plans.

Bring them down.
