The gates are open,
leaving men behind,
seamless,
I'm passing through.

For all the ways,
I have been,
and the glimpses
of this godhead skin,

in the nightmares of kings,
I am free.

Tracing patterns,
to hold the visions of
what defines it all.

False, face to the ground,
I take off the crown,
Pawn, know your place,
You serve the path of the fallen light.

look in the eyes
of every creature,
and the reason of their search.

Introspective ritual,
to unlock the omniscient I.

Fade-eyes-delusion embers
cleansing all the
lies-systemic-doubt

in our deceptive perception.
