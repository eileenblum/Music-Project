Their powers enclose all we know
leaving us in this void
killed by this world as a child

a shell inside, growing then giving out
made of scars I'm reborn
I can finally understand
why the tide pushes back

unending war
breaching our souls
ruptures of God
bleed

in our darkest hours
adversities
will makes us all shine

beyond
free, undetached
I am riding the ophidian vibrations

all the beauty in this world
a reflection
stagnant, pointless without
a reason to fight

the bitter truth of this world
peace is not for us
can't move without thorns
we must ignite our glow
