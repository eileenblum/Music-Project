Fire from dust
Eyes of the many face the light
We sing, we break the laws of time
Riding the wave on our way back/up
We are pulled, ever inward
Into the sun

I saw the symbols
drew them to our core
as our father before us
walk the earth
drink the rain.

Ride the nimbus
Ignite our thoughts
we see the aether again

Echoes will be heard
no longer left in shadows
Left the land but will never be truly gone
Our newborn glow ever reaching those below

We stretch ourselves
We break the cord
The beam above

âAgnates we gaze upwards
Black below we purgeâ
