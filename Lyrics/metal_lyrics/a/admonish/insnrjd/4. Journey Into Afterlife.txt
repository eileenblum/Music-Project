Born into this world
With all of its complexity
The strings of life intertwined
Into braids twisted around my head
Like wriggling snakes of confusion
How I first thought things were
Later I realized it was not
What I once in my youth had been taught

From deep within me
Grows a desperate need for help
I'm trying to put into words
My innermost scream

From high above a mighty voice
Cuts through my darkened sky
Rebuking the winds, bidding my
Roaring waves to be still

[John 3:16]
I am the Way, the Truth
And the Life
No one comes to the Father
Except through me

You looked for guidance, I am the Way
You asked for answers, I am the Truth
You longed for meaning, I am the Life
And the Father is the goal
(For) your journey into afterlife

Leaving my childhood
My journey begins
With my ship I'm forced to set sail
On a sea of swirling chaos
Of thoughts and feelings
An amorphous mess of sadness
Of regrets and anxieties
On an ocean of emotions

Driven forth by stormy winds
That tears my sails asunder
Who can guide me through
This raging storm

From high above a mighty voice
Cuts through my darkened sky
Rebuking the winds, bidding my
Roaring waves to be still

[John 3:16]
I am the Way, the Truth
And the Life
No one comes to the father
Except through me

You looked for guidance, I am the Way
You asked for answers, I am the Truth
You longed for meaning, I am the Life
And the father is the goal
(For) your journey into afterlife

[1 Corinthians 13:11-12]
When I was a child
I talked like a child
I thought like a child
I reasoned like a child
When I became a man
I put childish ways behind
Now we see a poor reflection
As in a mirror
Then we shall see
Face to face, now I know
In part, then I shall know
Fully, even as I am fully known
