Celestial visitation
Of the resurrected incarnation
Lord of the Heavens
To Earth descends
With majesty beyond comprehension
He steps down to the physical dimension
The Son of God undisguised
His glory unveiled to mortal eyes

Lifted out of â time and space
As deadstruck I fall â on my face
Unlimited power â in serene form
I am in the eye â of the storm

Reaching out his arms of grace
My paralysed soul to embrace
I am completely engulfed in peace
My chains are loosened, I'm released

In utmost awe I'm on my knees
before this divine â Epiphany

Like a thousand lightnings had struck this place
The shadows vanish without a trace
I'm melted down by his radiance
And overwhelmed by reverence
I'm caressed by his holy presence
And saturated by this spiritual essence
Blessed are those of pure heart
For they shall see God

Lifted out of â time and space
As deadstruck I fall â on my face
Unlimited power â in serene form
I am in the eye â of the storm

Reaching out his arms of grace
My paralysed soul to embrace
I am completely engulfed in peace
My chains are loosened, I'm released

In utmost awe I'm on my knees
before this divine â Epiphany
