Once when mMastery returned to reside
In Prince Death's darkly curtained halls
Canst thou remember the glorious night
Didst thou not answer Him as He calleth?
Dancing in line, all His acolytes and priests
The One above all dread Grand Archgod of Prey
Hath been conjured to rise in the midnight speeches

So together we "walked"

Walked that nethermost path one that leadeth to the outside
Behynde where monuments of vanished days layeth waste
Through the gateway of shadows, where resistance is in vain
To take Him home,

Ruler fixes His stare so blind,
Painfull to the eye and minde
Conquering the worlds in flight
Plague and madness to Mankind:

The gate to the Outside was open too long
The gate to the Outside was open too long
The gate to the Outside was open too long
The gate to the Outside was open too long
