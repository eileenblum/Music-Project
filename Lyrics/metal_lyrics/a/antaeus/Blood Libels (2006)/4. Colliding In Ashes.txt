Those touch used to be like My sin
Now it's come to unseal you within
Never dealt with anger until the day
You burst in fire
Blessed be thee for all that you may
Offer me, enhance me
Fire it up
And Burn it up
Make it collide in ashes
Seven seals that never made it
Conclusion never was your thing
The path choose always seemed to be what made you
Those touch used to be
Like My Sin
Now it's time
To consume your within
Never felt that complete
Until reunion of you &amp; my breathing
