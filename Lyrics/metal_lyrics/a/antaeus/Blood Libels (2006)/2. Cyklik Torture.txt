Awake me, great father
Bless my throat! Thy wordz are spoken
Denigrate, the life I was given Rebirth of thought, that
Riveting time when All the ideas
I never got Lurk the answerz To force real life into
Making sense in my
Mind numbed by the "dream"... I once lived.
Take Me In, yet it's all Carved in my flesh
The indelible scarves
Of who I was, am and will be Predico incultus per animus qoud cruor
Benis ego vestri hostilitas
