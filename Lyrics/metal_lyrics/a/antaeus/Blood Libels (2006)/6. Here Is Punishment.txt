I'll fade your self away
You're just souvenirs after all
I just can't make you hang in there
I just can't peel you off my skin
You won't remember
All the pain you caused well
Anyway
You were claiming to say
Here is justice, here is punishment, here in me
That never fooled those who listened
Until that day when you prooved us wrong
The wrong matter, the wrong tools
It doesn't matter anymore
It never left our heads, not a word, not a whisper
All kept secret &amp; self deny
We made it sick, we made it wrong
To make it beautiful to go through &amp; so painful for you to breath
