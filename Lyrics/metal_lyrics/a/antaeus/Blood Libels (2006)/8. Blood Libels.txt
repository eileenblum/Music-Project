Desires brought forth, sweet work of torture
Matters not to view pain &amp; suffering as an ending
Feel them as the beginning Prove me that you're more than flesh
Dare to Dare to expose the divine
Moves to call the sins
Sweat dripping, engulfed in streams My life to live again
To see it all through your veins
For days &amp; for days,
Rape you again
Feel you again
What once was shall never be the same
Yet I dream
I dream of those collages of hope
Those I broke
I cherish what I made of you
Crowned &amp; whipped
Blood collecting
For how long will you
Come back to life
I want to end your breath again &amp; again
See me as Saint
Canonize my Name...
Brought back to life, for me to burn all your hopes again - view me as a saint, blood libel
