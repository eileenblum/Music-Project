Words brought back to life
Those meaning and those invective tone we had
What did affect without effect
Took another form one will never neglect
Torments of angels that faded
All those shade I had to sew back making all one
Reaching none while
All those shadows I had to fake
Hiding some form Praying the One...
Trapped in a body
My own betrayer
Not allowing any moves nor excess
An unsharp tool that damage unity
An enemy within that evolves toward statues
Lack of motion, lack of action, Mind overprocessing
For he hath shown the way and put on my path
The pain and the torture of a shattered body
I shall go on, wearing the burden of Pain, turning it
Glorifying it
For it didn't limit the strong For it didn't stop the Evilution
For it just changed the process
And made the whole scheme higher
Battling on different mindfield
Words as weapons
Eyes as judges
Smell the viktory
&amp; sense the defeat
