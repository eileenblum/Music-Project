Swallowing dust that sets cells free
Engulfing one to become the Else Reaching an higher scheme
Dwelling above the mass As the snake did slide
Multiple choices got seen
All in curves
All in lines
All in I
Did you feel like you could handle it all
Did she seem fragile enough
Did we teach what could be done
Did she realize what was on
Did you feel any loss of control
Did she get to comfort you
Did you feel the stream you spawned
Did she made it clean in all she offered
Did it change anything in your eyes
Since
And during
The offering
Once an another
Now obtained
Another tool colliding towards the end
Just shaping it all
Bringing dynamics to the whole
All those breather chained
Mouth as battery, locked on one impulse
Wounds as links
Burns as keys
