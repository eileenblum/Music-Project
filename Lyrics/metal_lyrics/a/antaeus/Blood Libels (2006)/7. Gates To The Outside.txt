Once when Mastery returned to reside
In Prince Death's darkly curtained halls,
Canst thou remember the glorious night?
Didst thou not answer Him as He calleth?
Dancing in line, all His acolytes and priests,
The One above all, dread Grand Archgod of Prey
Hath been conjured to rise in their midnight speeches
So together we walked
Walked that nethermost path, one that leadeth to the outside
Behynde where monuments of vanished days layeth wayste
Through the gateway of shadows, where resistance is in vain,
To take Him home...
Ruler fixes His stare so blind,
Painfull to the eye and mynde,
Conquering the worlds in flight,
Plague and Madness to Mankind...
The Gate to the Outside was open too long [x4]
