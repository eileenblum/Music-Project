"For I know that my redeemer lives
A guarantor upon the dust will stand
Even after my skin is flayed
Without my flesh I shall see him"

Raped, tortured, all experiments
I feel repeatedly attacked
All those sharp razors entering me

Those sounds beneath the skin
Traveling through the veins
Intravenal message

For all to be seen

"For I know that my redeemer lives
A guarantor upon the dust will stand
Even after my skin is flayed
Without my flesh I shall see him"

My sins are moving the sun
Massive pillars will hold the skies
Once empty, my body shall resurrect
A flood of sins
A flood of lies

Another son upon the altar

"For I know that my redeemer lives
A guarantor upon the dust will stand
Even after my skin is flayed
Without my flesh I shall see him"
