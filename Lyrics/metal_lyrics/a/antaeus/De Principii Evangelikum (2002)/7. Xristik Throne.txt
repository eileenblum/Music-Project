Worthless pieces of flesh
So easy to use
A simple tool used and abused
Come over
Time to achieve life

The cyclic twin dance
Those with crystal glances
Mind usurpers of xristik thronez

Injekting khaos - dreams flood

Payment under skin
The cyclic twin dance
Those with crystal glances
Mind usurpers of xristik thronez

Engulf the whole I
Angel becomes sinner

Oak covered
Shine shine oh my tool
Your moves dances with visions
When i'll close my eyes
Eroded statue with no expression
Will wait for 5th apostles awakening

Lit the candles
Kneel to the shrine
Chantz the coming of the new seed
Pray
Pray
Injekt injekt

For there will be no redemption
