Ripping the skies
See them bring darkness
Flying far from hope
A journey without wingz

Unseen yet felt
Nor wishing to been seen
Those illegal angelz

Spreading unlight
Oak covered
Swallowed forgiveness
Sin adorers, icons tied to a konfused past

Angelz of forseen disease
Flying towards faith

Krushing values
Raping idols
Kreating the new world order

Divided soil between the altars
Tomb of the kathedral opens
From this void
An offer to beyond
Kreators/Destroyers

Future sigils of truth
Illegal angelz
