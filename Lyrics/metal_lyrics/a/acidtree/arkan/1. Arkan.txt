Deep in the woods, lost in the gloom
I start to hear a wondrous tune
The earth rumbles with the thundering drums
The night is banished as the logs burn
Spinning and spiraling up to the sky
Fierce and wild
With smiling faces and glittering eyes
I see them singing and circling the fire

Dance, sweet child, and don't be afraid
Remain and be one with the land
Dance, sweet child, and don't be afraid
This is a place of the gods

As I sift through the ashes
I fail to see what lies beyond the door
We're lost in the mist of knowledge
Forgotten and deserted
Round the gleaming flames I'll wait
Round the gleaming flames I'll face you

Dance, sweet child, and don't be afraid
Remain and be one with the land
Dance, sweet child, and don't be afraid
This is a place of the gods
