The rays of early light
Show the way to Aurora
Again she opens wide
The golden gates of dawn

I woke up by your side
Struck by fresh beauty
Crowned by the morning breeze
You hide distant eyes

When a new love awakes
With different smells and tastes
Behind the mask I'm afraid
To see the same face

The new day arrives
Another day, not so bright
I say you're unique
You pretend to believe

I'll tell you lame jokes
New stories, tired lies
Buy you fancy roses
Take you to the same old bar

When a new love awakes
With different smells and tastes
Behind the mask I'm afraid
To see the same face

Deep down I search for you
Not one of them seems true
One by one they leave without a trace
You keep leading me astray

A field of golden flowers
Bending to the placid mirroring lake
Drawn by their own beauty
Lost in themselves
Lonely and sad

When a new love awakes
With different smells and tastes
Behind the mask I'm afraid
To see my own face

So the Goddess of Dawn
Carries out her work and brings light to earth
A new day arrives
Nothing but a dream of another day

When a new love awakes
With different smells and tastes
Behind the mask I'm afraid
To see my own
