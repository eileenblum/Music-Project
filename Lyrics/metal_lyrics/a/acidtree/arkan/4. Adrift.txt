Among sheets and broken glass
Stale drinks and old ash
I lie awake trapped in frozen dreams
Longing for the day that I will find peace

The old portrait stares at me
Cheerful eyes bring emptiness
Round the decay it stands pristine
A time when everything was green
I was strong and whole and bright
Then silently came the night

I canât breathe
You reach your hands to me
A glimmer of hope
A mocking smile
You keep dragging me down

There comes a time
You lived for so long you feel safe
But dreams shatter
By a simple twist of fate
There you stand
A ghost refusing to fade away
Green turned into gray
I'll follow you to the grave

Can we be saved from days long gone?
Can we be saved from innocence lost?

I canât breathe
You reach your hands to me
A glimmer of hope
A mocking smile
You keep dragging me down
