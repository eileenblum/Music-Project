The king is dead!
We have nothing more to fear
His head's claimed by Fortune's wheel
On the mob's death square

Now is the time for renewal
Don't mourn for the ill-fated despot
His very existence was a crime
Against the freedom of mankind

Mercy for the innocent
Mercy for the weak
The tyrant died
So the nation could live

Fine virtues bloom
On the poisonous branches of truth
Again and yet again
Righteous violence reigns absolute

Blessings to the new ruler
He takes the blood of the gentry
That slowly erodes
The rooted tree of liberty

I bring you a realm o virtue and terror
I bring you justice prompt and severe
It's foolish to trust virtue without fear

Mercy for the innocent
Mercy for the weak
The tyrant died
So the nation could live

Fine virtues bloom
On the poisonous branches of truth
Again and yet again
Righteous violence reigns absolute

Down with the tyrant
Enemy of the people
He didn't stem the flow of blood
Now the stream is filled by his own

Who dares accuse me?
I, who served the 'cause of equality,
Betrayed by false patriots
I spurn this senseless riot

Mercy for the innocent
Mercy for the weak
The tyrant died
So the nation could live

Fine virtues bloom
On the poisonous branches of truth
Again and yet again
Righteous violence reigns absolute

The people gather round
I can hear the rabid crowd
I can feel their anxious eyes
Waiting for me on the other side
Time will judge us all
