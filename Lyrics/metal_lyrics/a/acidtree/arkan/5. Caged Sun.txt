The oath must not be broken
The luminous city will stand forever
Built by sacred demand
Granting the wish of the One
River, mountain and sand
Under the watching sun

These are just words
Remnants of shattered dreams
Buried in the dust

One King, one God
He casts His light upon the land
To guide the frail hearts of men
When the disc rests in the distant west
Darkness is a shroud
Everything is still

I can see you
Blessed with the power to lead mankind
They will understand the divine

One folk, one realm
The gift of life in all its forms
Humans, beasts and plants are born

Daybreak fills the earth with life and grace
And we are reborn
Reveling in his warmth

I can see you
Blessed with the power to lead mankind
They will understand the divine

O precious light
Shine bright
The purest gold is sand
Next to your splendor

I was betrayed
The city can't stop its decay
Is it too late?
Will the divine land be destroyed
By the hate of men
Victims of envy and revenge
Witchcraft, credulity
Ignorance and misery

Fear my wrath and despair
I'll erase all your names

Sailing down the Nile
I see a land so pure and serene
Virtuous lore revealed to me
There will be no hunger, war, disease.

Shadows fall to earth
The path to light is lost
Men were left alone in dreamless sleep
Truth stays concealed within our souls
