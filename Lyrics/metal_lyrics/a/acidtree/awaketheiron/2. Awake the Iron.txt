The valley sleeps beneath the morning dew;
The sun is rising, darkness yields to day.
It slowly shows the scorched fields of gray,
The dying flames of fight will wake anew.

The land will tremble - soon the roaring war
Will fall upon the earth with dreadful wrath,
Leaving behind another bloody path,
A crimson mass of ruin, death and gore.

Listen to the east wind blowing
Draw your card and cast the lot
The abyss is always hungry
Ever lurking for its prey

Awake the iron
Time to rise, time to fight
The day of glory has arrived
Awake the iron

Unleash the joy in sin, the lust for hate
Chaos will reign supreme - the vengeful king
Will come to take us under his dark wing.
Today, all will be judged at heaven's gate.

Listen to the east wind blowing
Draw you card and cast the lot
The abyss is always hungry
Ever lurking for its prey

Awake the iron
Time to rise, time to fight
The day of glory has arrived
Awake the iron

Oh memories, your sweet vanishing foam,
Forever lapping on the drifting sand.
I'm cursed, I'm cursed by this forsaken land,
I dream of distant shores, I dream of home.

Although my tattered heart so deeply yearns,
The spring is over, never to return.

Awake the iron
Time to rise, time to fight
The day of glory has arrived
Glory and death
