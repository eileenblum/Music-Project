Goodbye to sorrow
The end, of waiting, miracle, tomorrow
Wait with action, avoid the cries
Advance with patience
The one I seek, can save the heart
Providing me, a brand new start
Search for your will, abstraction
Watch the portrait, your reaction
Power, mere, fractions
Enough, incinerate, distractions
Remember when, remember when
Wondering why they care
Pain that nothing can compare!

Goodbye to sorrow,
The end of waiting for the miracle of tomorrow!
