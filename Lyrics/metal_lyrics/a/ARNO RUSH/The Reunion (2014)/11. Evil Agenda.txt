They say to be tougher, you must first suffer
They say to know joy, is to first know sadness
To say victory is mine, righteous must first shine
Eventually, you must take down, the evil shrine

Weapon of choice is up to you
Work to kill dreams come true
In the distance life and death
must fight til last breath
cost of life often ruthless,
Justification truthless
enemy in disguise, undoubtedly wise
Dreaming of blood, pouring from the skies
Avoiding the rejection, you strive for perfection

Whatever you do, donât lose expectation
see your vision clear and straight
handle the pressure of the weight
Alas the reward for this struggle is great
Seeing all of this, your evil twin sends wrath
Be careful who you choose
Pick the wrong one and you will loose

To humanity, obstacles of death

Enemy in disguise, undoubtedly wise
Dreaming of blood pouring from the skies!
Enemy in disguise, undoubtedly wise
Dreaming of blood pouring from the skies!
