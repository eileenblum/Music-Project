No reason, for the lust, twist into a chaos trap
Tell me you must, violent thoughts, overlap
Arsenal, of hell, confusion overrides
From paradise we fell, the enemy hides
Scarred all over, physicality taking over
No true happiness only pain
Remembering, we once walked in the rain
From this carnal knowledge I will gain
On the sheets the blood will stain!!!!!!!!

Years alone makes sanity suffer,
Filled with mental warfare
Focused on the flesh,
Canât hold on much longer
Unaware of the fiery mesh,
What canât kill you makes you stronger
Youâre close to the final solution,
Destroy this anguish and confusion!

Temporary pleasure, knowledge that lasts forever!

From this carnal knowledge I will gain
On the sheets the blood will stain!

Chaos and satisfaction remain, remarkably insane
Obsessive compulsive, always indecisive, truly repulsive
They laugh and want to cut you in half
Threatening to annihilate
The image of man they desecrate
From this carnal knowledge I will gain On the sheets the blood will stain!
