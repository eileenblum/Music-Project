Hooks attached, to the ends of the chain
Through the air, at the speed of light
Inflicting pain
Provoking all of your instincts, to fight

Dragged through the flames
Tearing away the chains as I walk
Endless mind games as the voices talk
Dragged through barbed wire mesh
Blood drips all around, a new enemy, I have found

The voice Iâve always known
The challenge has now been shown
Choose life over death and you shall see
Your dreams might finally come to be
Divine healing, can set you free
The skies raining down fire
Evermore to extinguish your desire

Temperature rises to the top, chains of sin must stop!
Temperature rises to the top, chains of sin must stop!
