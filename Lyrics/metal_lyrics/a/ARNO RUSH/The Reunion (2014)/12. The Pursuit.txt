Purpose engage the pursuit
Not my will, but yours
What other question is there, but this
What other answer is there, but this
The question, above all questions
The answer, above all answers
Where you fit in, now thereâs a challenge
The clues are scattered about for you to find
Called according to purpose
Let not your heart deceive you,
Guard your heart, with all of your might
Indestructible, with no time to bleed
The conscience speaks
Purpose with pain, the heart still seeks
Be aware
The self you must spare
Voices from every angle
Creating a riddle, for you to untangle

Behind bars, climbing to the stars
Souls strive for evil ways
The coldness of hearts, the last days
Without natural affection
Truce breakers from hell
False accusers
Until death your flesh will command
Repent for the Kingdom is at hand
Indestructible, with no time to bleed
The conscience speaks
Purpose with pain, the heart still seeks
Be aware
The self you must spare
Voices from every angle
Creating a riddle, for you to untangle
