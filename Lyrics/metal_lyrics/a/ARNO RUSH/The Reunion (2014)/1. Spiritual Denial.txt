Darkness falls upon your grace,
Seek the knowledge you must face,
The reaper aims, and starts the chase, sheer mind control, without a trace
Blessings sown into the threads leave you torn and ripped to shreds
All that matters here and now, doing things only you allow

Living in spiritual denial, demons put you on the trial

Terrified, of possession, your own lust the obsession
They tell you the light will shine, you think the illusion was a design
In a world, where priests are pawns, your world free, it suddenly dawns
Asking can this be real, a sense of comfort, you want to feel! That you want to feel!!!!

Resurrection, overdue, reality not so true
What happens in the end if only I knew, ask yourself will I make it through?
Are they lies, or faith working, questions, are always lurking
Dark side of fiery doom, no chance of life inside this tomb!

I can hear the fear of death howling on your breath
Walk through fire with every mile, yet refuse to die,
Your inner being lost and scared,
A shining spirit that one time cared
A lost soul, madness reaching a climax
Is it the search for truth or the fear of death!
FEAR OF DEATH
