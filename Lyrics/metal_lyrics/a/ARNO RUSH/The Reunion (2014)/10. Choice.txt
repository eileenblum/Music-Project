Walking in the dark
A new journey, you must embark
Crush your obstacles distractions to the ground
you are profound, future that is renowned
Realities to face
Evil thoughts you must erase
empty pitfall emotions you embrace
Through time and space, your nemesis made the case

The choice is up to you
What I have in store for thee, if you only knew

A mission in transition
top of chaos another addition
Narcotic induced condition
Take away precious ambition
Tear you into submission
Of love you must find, a true definition

To make a decision, with wisdom, and precision

For without a vision, the people perish
Hold on to dreams you used to cherish

So I walk by faith and not by sight
Guaranteeing the victory in this fight

The realization sinks through the bone
The true enemy is you alone
