Lifelessness of reason, confusion vast worry
No fear, nothingness my enemy
A great delusion, vision's turning blurry
Definitions unclear
Searching for forbidden evidence
The answer within Satanâs residence
Wickedness abound,
Mocking sacred love breaking the rules
Immorality the cure
Find your true reality
Temptations cast the lure
Looking for Satan at the entry gates,
My conscience debates
Through the mud and dirt I must crawl
Virtues within begin to fall!!!!

Stay away, walk away
The blameless walk I canât delay
Challenge rights and wrongs until neither matter,
Shades of gray unfold til sanity will shatter!

Unknowingly no longer sane
Knowledge appears fake yet eventually youâll break
Until today's sunset this inner battle still remains
Subconsciously responsible for many pains
Disbelief, making more grief
Uncertain of the future, you begin to wonder
Striking fear as you hear the thunder
Retched ways sending me under

Remain vanished from youth, No direction, No Change
The answer might be never, but for you this isn't strange
Always asking who, where and why
Fire surrounds my cape, from this prison, I must escape!

Fire surrounds my cape, from this prison, I must escape!

Looking for Satan at the entry gates,
My conscience debates
Through the mud and dirt I must crawl
Virtues within begin to fall!!!!
Fire surrounds my cape, from this prison, I must escape!
