Thoughts of revenge, I bring
The mastery of my perception
Only thoughts of victory ring
I now see through the deception
Seek first, the Kingdom, and the rest, shall arrive

A sense of inner rage, is flowing
Your only chance, to stay alive
Prisoner of your own mind

Self control, I must attain, determine the goal, in peace to remain
Pressure will sustain, intimidation, the demons gain
Many voices but there is only one
The war of words, it has begun!

Mind battleground life or death
Place they seek to devour
Losing heart, false realities, from the start
Voices use the past,
So your future does not last
Fight back Fight back
Relentlessness that you lack
Your mind the battlefield, of life or death
Your mind the battlefield, of life or death

Intrusive voices, compromise your choices
Do the right thing, ask what rewards will this bring?
Thoughts of revenge I bring
The mastery of my perception
Only thoughts of victory should ring
I now see through their deception!
