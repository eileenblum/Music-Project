Spirit of the bottle I can tell
I must confess your straight from hell
When will it be well, my love it never fell
Searching for a place to dwell
Truths unwind then reality I find

Spirit of the bottle I can tell
I must confess your straight from hell
Memories to battle
No skipping a drink
Of the pain I can no longer think

The schedule off track
Disappear for a while
now youâre back
And now your baaaaaaaaack! Repeat times 4

Spirit of the bottle I can tell
I must confess your straight from hell
Straight from heeeeeeeelllllll!!!!!

Are we here, or is it all fake, ask myself, how much can I take?
All about the thrill, straight for the kill
Provide the greet, a special seat
Was this to be only one?
Then one day you decide to run

Reality is lost, magnitude of the cost
Is love dead, or are these just voices in my head?

Hallucinations killing pain

Iâve had this vision, survive the collision
Battleground where spirit meets flesh
(scream)

Always together forever to remember
Chemistry high you wont believe
More trouble you perceive

Canât face the light, forever trapped in the night

Unlike what youâve heard,
Understand perception is blurred,
Ritual abuse satanic rings
Unspeakable pain that it brings

As the results set in,
Pressure, pain, madness sin
Pressure, pain, madness sin
Pressure, pain, madness sin
Pressure, pain, madness sin

Spirit of the bottle I can tell
I must confess your straight from hell
