Genetics loads the gun
Environment pulls the trigger
Genetics loads the gun
Environment pulls the trigger
Welcome to my worst nightmare
Control is the search
Madness
Debilitation
Paralysis, of the Soul
Making me wish, I was never born
My evil twin is raising hell
Compulsive actions for a ritual never solved
Obsessive actions for a ritual never answered
Awaken to the howls and screams of lies every second
A chase from hell with endless traps
They hope to get the trigger
It wants a trigger
Rituals fill the days and nights
Not a moments rest from this hell
Draining my strength
Serotonin Depletion
Brain chemicals rapidly evolve
Into a monster
Dying to eat you alive
Genetics loads the gun
Environment pulls the trigger
Perfectionism
Germafobe rampant stress
Intrusive thoughts
Lies become truth and truth become lies
Feelings the new God
Emotions the new God
Feelings the new God
Emotions the new God
Genetics loads the gun
Environment pulls the trigger

Paralysis, of the Soul
Making me wish, I was never born
My evil twin is raising hell
Compulsive actions for a ritual never solved
Obsessive actions for a ritual never answered
Awaken to the howls and screams of lies every second
They wont leave me alone
like a train headed for the mind
Rituals fill the days and nights
Not a moments rest from this hell
Draining my strength
Serotonin Depletion
Brain chemicals rapidly evolve
Into a monster
Dying to eat you alive

Raised in fear
Only to no longer fear
