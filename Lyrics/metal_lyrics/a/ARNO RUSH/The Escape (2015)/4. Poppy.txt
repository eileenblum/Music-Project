For the pain there is a cure
For the cure there is a pain
For the pain there is a cure
For the cure there is a pain

When all else fails this is the place to be
Opioid here to save the day
Tie off
Intravenous
Injection
Or if you prefer
Off the foil
Bliss is finally here
Escape from the lies
Escape from the pain
Chaos turns to bliss
Bliss turns to HELL
Chaos turns to bliss
Bliss turns to HELL
Alas nothing ever free
Euphoria
leaving the stream
The hell
as it leaves you dead
Realizing
the emptiness
that you dread
Wondering
where it went wrong
Why to quit, why to quit
Thereâs gotta be more!
Thereâs gotta be more!
Into the afterlife I shall go
Higher than the angels ever felt

In a strange land
Find blood on your hand
With this I want to fly
Hoping not to die

Overdose around the corner
Needle and a spoon

A fix to be forgotten
Rips apart your mind

One more time
One more fix

It appears even in dreams
Coming after my soul
For the pain there is a cure
For the cure there is a pain
For the pain there is a cure
For the cure there is a pain
