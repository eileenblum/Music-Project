An eternity of battles

Who or what is
Commander Executioner
Of thoughts and actions

A lifetime of abuse
I dare you to say a word
A lifetime of fear
I dare you to try
Bring me your hate
Add to my strength
Bring me your fear
Add to my faith
Anytime
Anyplace

Destiny
Identity of Self
Mind body Spirit Soul
Forever the enemy
Identity of Self

Falling out with my sins
Drop the weight that so easily kills
Costing me life
Costing me truth
Thou shalt not interfere with Destiny

A lifetime of abuse
I dare you to say a word
A lifetime of fear
I dare you to try
Bring me your hate
Add to my strength
Bring me your fear
Add to my faith
Anytime
Anyplace

Using the material world to keep me down
Iâll reach into your dimension and rip your soul apart!

Make no mistake
Weâre playing the devils blues
Whatever it takes
Kill or be killed
Mind control
Slave training
Depopulation
Poisoning the garden
Yet weâre invincible
Yeah!

Who or what is
Commander Executioner
Of thoughts and actions
Invincible To fear
In the last days
I shall pour my spirit unto all flesh
Eternal peace to remain
Invincible To fear
In the last days
I shall pour my spirit unto all flesh
Eternal peace to remain
