Cast down
From a holy place
Like lightning into the earth
Shockwaves in heaven
After this there is no search

The Pentagram catches a blaze!
(yell)

System sends you to the grave
As the day comes to the end
I wonder what the fate will send
Do what thou wilt
shall be the whole of the law
With this entity
The time stands still!
With this entity
The time stands still!
The time stands still!
(yell)

I have you now it claims
Straight for the heart he aims
Blood Sacrifice
Black Magick Cult
I have you now it claims
Straight for the heart he aims

Deep in meditation
As far as the mind can see
Abandoning frustration
Changing through tribulation
Searching for the sacred place
Survive only âcause of grace

SATAN! (yell)

I have you now it claims
Straight for the heart he aims
Do what thou will
With me the time stands still

Once upon a time, Chastity was law
Lust, one thing no man should trust
Into your heart it thrust,
your own doom sends you back to the dust
For dust you are, and to dust you shall return

Temperance, ability to restrain
Hold back the pain; know that youâll gain
Sheer excess
Atmosphere of hate
Virtuosity the cure

Sacred thoughts are well placed
Thinking about the wars I faced
The treasures that I once chased
The nightmares Iâve embraced

Charity what others need
Opposite of Greed
Sloth taking on diligence
Ambition to live
Ambition to die
Ignorance, stealing from the season
Tears away all the reason

Satan!
Sudden darkness Wrath
Anger in the mindâs path
Patience can save
Evil thoughts I crave
Of the flesh mans a slave
Walking towards the grave!

Pride of the God of this world
Seven Deadly sins got your soul
Sudden darkness Wrath
Anger in the mindâs path
Of the flesh mans a slave
Walking towards the grave!
Satan the Servant
Satan the Test
Satan the Savior
Satan the Killer
Satan The Beast!
