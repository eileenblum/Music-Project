Promise of peace
Fight without cease
Revenge for tortured years
In this darkness
Many fears
The impossible
A way outta no way

Darkness enhancing the light
The light of life
Darkness enhancing the light
The light of life

Through darkness light has shined
Remember when and where
days are passing by faster
When and where shall it arrive

Will this love ever thrive?
Path to travel, you decide
Will this love ever thrive?
Path to travel, you decide

Darkness enhancing the light
The light of life
Darkness enhancing the light
The light of life
(scream)

Here they try again
steal perception
War of words settle the score
Even though illusionâs at the core
War of words settle the score
Even though illusionâs at the core

Rejoice
For this is the day that you have made
Conformed to the world
Transform renew
Guard the heart
Eradication
Destruction
Good and Evil interlock!
Walk in the spirit
Destroy the flesh

With precision, voices seek division
Cast down every false imagination
Begin to walk in revelation

Do what thou wilt, the whole of the law
Your life it will drain, only darkness will remain

Wounded and bruised, determined and alive
The answer is now what I strive
The chemicals collide
A stage of terror they provide
Withdrawal canât hide

The sorrows have fallen
Chaos still exists
They have all disappeared
Madness still persists
The sorrows have fallen
Chaos still exists
They have all disappeared
Madness still persists

Who are you, where are you going?
Without an answer blood will be flowing
Have you known me from the start?

To the pits of darkness
They have retreated
Reality has been defeated
Holy Devil on his way

Through blinding hell
There is a chase
Righteousness
I must embrace!!
Righteousness
I must embrace!!
Satan!
Satan!
Death is life!
Life is Death!
Alpha Omega!
