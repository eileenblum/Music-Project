A sense of strength
Sorrows of reality
Within my arms length
I must be dreaming
With you I find peace
I search for you, without cease
TetraHydro
Cannabinol
Angelic Savior
Madness, approaching insidiously
Tolerance, reaching the limit
Solution, upgrade the high
Upgrade to die
The day you arrive
Life forever change
Happiness we thrive
Perception rearrange
With you I find peace
I search for you without cease
Madness, approaching insidiously
Tolerance, reaching the limit
Solution, upgrade the high
Upgrade to die
Let the angel green take the sorrows away
A sacred connection
Everlasting affection
Indestructible
Love I have to seek
The language we all speak
Pledge to the end
To be your best friend
I will never descend
My help I will lend
You I defend
Until the very end
You I defend
Madness, approaching insidiously
Tolerance, reaching the limit
Solution, upgrade the high
Upgrade to die
