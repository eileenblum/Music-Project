Preference
Line Rock or Needle
Either way itâs time to elevate
Letâs hope this time we arenât tempting fate,
Paranoid delusions
Must serve the flesh
Offering you the world
Only to get closer
Closer to the kill

More pain than pleasure
Only to the veteran
Who struggles daily
To maintain a high
Cost of life
Cost of blood
Cost of life
Cost of blood

Looking for the white leaf to fix the day
If only there was a different way

Got me hooked to hell
Body aches and cries
Yet still the flesh demands
Yet still the flesh commands

Danger from a wandering stranger
For the fix I risk it all
Watch out
Overdose
(yell)

Wreaking havoc on the heart
Locked in a cage
With or without I feel the rage
Soul has been shot
Careful not to get caught

Once again there is an excuse
A simple pain
Turning into hell
A simple dream
When will I be well
A vice of the flesh
Know your eternal self
Ever changing
Eternal self

Paranoid delusions
Must serve the flesh
Offering you the world
Only to get closer
Closer to the kill
Preference
Line Rock or Needle
Either way itâs time to elevate
Letâs hope this time weâre not tempting fate
