Into the cauldron
A lethal dose
Into the system
A cross bearing rose
Into the future
They want to fly again

Abomination of a fallen kind
Free love for us all
Forever after your mind
Donât forget the call

Masters of the Earth
Illuminate the Universe
Mysteries to be solved
Around the light they revolved
Masters of the Earth
Illuminate the Universe
Mysteries to be solved
Around the light they revolved

Alter genes kill you quicker
Sterilized at birth
Ancient war still being fought

Ingredients of despair
Cast down unto conscience

Mysteries to be solved
Around the light they revolved
Gathering the forces
Destruction Imminent
Truth Seeker
Mysteries to be solved
Around the light they revolved

World peace
Or world domination
An order out of chaos
Defining the generations
Bloodlines in control

A subject
of interest
To the seeker
of truth

Secret Council
Finding new ways
To infiltrate
Finding new ways
To make you hesitate
If you dare
Try to touch the sky
Go beyond the sun and moon
Rings of Saturn lighting up
Choosing life over death
Before understanding
Must come acceptance
Before reason
Must come acceptance
