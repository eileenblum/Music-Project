Like creatures within the deepest oceans, you are existing unaware of
worlds outside your own.
Disregard what is believed and fantasy shall enter
Begin to think of concepts that are slightly left of centre
Begin without beginning and conclude eternally
A mass infinite cycle I am in and is in me.

The not yet born and dead may know
where we've been and where we go
what's to come and why where here
but when I look it's most unclear.

At times I'm lost with things I find
Is god creator or image if mind?
A macroscopic universe - a microscopic view
variety of astonishment I can't see thought.

Imagine places I've not been
Picture sights I've never seen
Believe in worlds I cannot see
Those I'm in and those in me
Though life's torment I now find
Life may be a state of mind
Disregarding the impossible
We believe in what is tangible

We feel the warmth of one in a trillion starts

Ethereal continuation - thoughts beyond infinite cycles
are we just a chemical equation that reached consciousness
though evolution?

Earth's nature confines itself. But within cosmology - infinity
