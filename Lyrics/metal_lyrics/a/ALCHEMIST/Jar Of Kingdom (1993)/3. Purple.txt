Looking in the corner of magic round room trying to find
the bottom of the top from the inbetweenal plane.
Ultraviolet craniums glowing with seductive scent
The circus now surrounds me, attractive but obese

I do not understand me!
Could you repeat me please?

A strange and distant melody
Provoking an absurdity
Opaque, my existence from the end to the start
Numbering creation but creatively inspired

I do not understand me!
Could you repeat me please?
Particles of edis saloc
Taste the thought provoking breeze.

An interpretation of creation
Feel the uncontrolled is oscillation
But a vision alienation

Enter into a labyrinth
A new direction to uphold
New inputs accepted
Then as entering the world still turns
and mother nature will never grow old!
PURPLE

Angels found is symmetrical visions - impossibilities come to life
Edis saloc stripped from nature
Severely severed
Placed in a pyramid
