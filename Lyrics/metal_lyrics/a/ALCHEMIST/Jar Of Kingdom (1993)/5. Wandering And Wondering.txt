I feel and I smell and I taste and I see
experiences they dub reality
I'm living life's journey the best that I can
but sometimes I find I don't know where I am
I often perceive the world out of context
The more that I wonder the more I'm perplexed
So I look to balance and self harmony
while I'm in life and wile life is in me

I am being who is unique
what I discover depends what I seek
I wish to travel without to within
to discover existence outside of my skin

I feel and I smell and I taste and I see - understand reality
I'm living life's journey the best that I can -
but often I find I don't know where I am
I often perceive the world out of context
but wondering makes me perplexed
I look to balance and self harmony while I'm in life
and wile life is in me

I feel, smell, taste and I see
experience called reality
and I live the best that I can
