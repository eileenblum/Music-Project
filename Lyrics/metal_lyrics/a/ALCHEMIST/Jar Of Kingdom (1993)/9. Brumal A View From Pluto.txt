Dwell on an eccentric orbit, plutonian hemisphere engaged
in a mutual - eclipse. The sun just a bright star low in the sky.
Rock and ice, the dark world under - 
Charon, where the light succumbs to dark.
Pluto god of the lower meridian. The apparent paths of the sun.

Two nuclei collide and from into a new phase, exploring retina is
locked into zenith gaze.

Far from a common orbit -
I see sights that no man knows!

The picture of our universe, spread infinitely over space, observe
the riddle thatï¿½s entwined - 
beginning yet existed forever. Cold as??
The initial state of the universe is often hard to comprehend, due
to the macrocosm of space.

Alpha Centauri is now clear in view, yet the galaxies still canï¿½t be
seen thought. Light years away from any other being?
Shadows of Charon I am now foreseeing.

Existence within worlds within worlds?
Existence within worlds within worlds!
Existence within worlds within worlds?
Existence within worlds within worlds!

Two nuclei collide and from into a new phase
but now the zenith gaze is just a haze.
