Situated in the present alive in the
moment of now separated from
attachment
- gone but not forgotten what is meant
to be inevitably will be, destiny a force
rather than an outcome of events
my point of change is on the horizon,
what brought it together now took it
away
chapters open, chapters close,
opportunities rise and fall like an
everlasting circle
My memory still plays the events
Affection is a state of mind.
My mind is altered.
Emptiness is eventually filled,
The universe unfolds
- things shall be as they are.
Although I often deviate I always return
to me.
Many paths are marked for us
