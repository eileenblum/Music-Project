Parched, cracked and blistered the land.
Sun bleached bones litter the ground.
Ribs protrude through skins of the beasts.
Lush flora now burnt, deceased.
Solarburn.
Blistered earth.
The sky aghast with windy brown.
The choking storms hurl dust around.
Sun glows red through arid skies.
All life wilts and slowly dies.
No rehydration to be found.
The wilderness is nothingness.
The sun glows red through arid skies.
Desolate country harsh and bare.
All life wilts and slowly dies.
Underneath the solar flare.
Gaunt ruins where a forest stood.
Sporadic stumps of burning wood.
Artesian bores leak sand and dust.
Once flowing pumps decayed with rust.
Last precious drops evaporated, dams now baked and desiccated.
From our star a solar wind, roasts the scars of the continent.
Fragments of what used to be, a wasteland of salinity.
A Mars on Earth all barren ground, nothing living can be found.
