Alpha Capella Nova Vega, do you watch over me?
Do you hear the words I'm speaking?
Do you exist merely in my memory?
Alpha Capella Nova Vega, do you exist anywhere now?
Alpha Capella Nova Vega, you dreamed about looking down on us all.
You reached your goal to perish, left your loved ones in pain.
People fade like memories do, your dreams of dying came true.
Alpha Capella Nova Vega, you dreamed about looking down on us all.
Crying your tears forever, sometimes I think I hear you call.
Time has not stood still for you.
You've missed the life that I live.
Alpha Capella Nova Vega, no one, or nothing, could have saved you.
Alpha Capella Nova Vega.
