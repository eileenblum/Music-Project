Tear me apart.
Underwater brilliance super sensory.
Suddenly gone.
My destruction the consequence of lost clarity.
You wonder why.
You use me as sanctuary.
Blaming nature.
Tourist dollar fades away from your economy.
Praising my beauty.
Tear me apart.
Untouched, unspoiled.
Dominant force.
Taken for granted.
Suddenly gone.
Hole in your world.
And you can tell where I once was.
I'm never coming back into this sick world of apathy.
Although it's never caught, the great reef will never be free.
Only living thing visible from space.
Grief barrier.
To let it fade away, a heritage disgrace.
Praising my beauty.
Tear me apart.
Untouched, unspoiled.
Dominant force.
Alive so long.
Taken for granted, no destroyed.
Suddenly gone.
And now you see.
Hole in your world.
And you can tell where I once was.
I'm never coming back into this sick world of apathy.
Although it's never caught, the great reef will never be free.
Vibrant colours turn grey, beauty fading away.
I'm never coming back.
Crystal waters turn black.
How could something so still be something so alive?
Exploit, export and destroy.
Unnatural claiming of rights.
My destruction the consequence of lost clarity.
Grief barrier.
