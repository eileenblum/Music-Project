Unknown reader, not yet conceived, inherit the world my generation leaves.
I fear for you there will not be, the natural pleasures there are for me.
I can drink the water, can safely swim in the sea.
Eat the fish from the rivers and see the forest of trees.
Slowly yet surely things are starting to change, a world of uncertainty its 
people deranged.
We're so good at killing each other, we churn out war machines.
They spend billions exploring the stars, while home on earth millions 
starve.
I wish I could help but I don't know what to do, with good intentions I'm 
the problem too.
Description of my earth is all that I can give, I can only wonder about the 
world in which you live.
Unknown reader of tomorrow.
I write to you with guilt and sorrow.
I live in a land and time that's free.
I hope it's there for you, what there is for me.
They spend billions exploring the stars, while home on earth millions 
starve.
Unknown reader, not yet conceived, inherit the world my generation leaves.
I fear for you there will not be, the natural pleasures there are for me.
I can drink the water, can safely swim in the sea.
Eat the fish from the rivers and see the forest of trees.
