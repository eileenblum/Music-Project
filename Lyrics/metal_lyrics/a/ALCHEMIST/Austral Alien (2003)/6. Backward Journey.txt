Observe the change.
Australian's thoughts are rearranged into the past.
The populous is telling me, hope you enjoy the backward journey.
Tolerance is only shown when the dollar can be grown.
We're going back to fighting wars for our politician's cause.
With saddened eyes I have observed.
Acceptance fall away to dust.
I'm moving backwards as I take a step forth.
The winds of hate are blowing strong in my world.
It all affects you and I.
Next generation pays the price.
All this hatred is tearing us down, as we ignore our own advice.
Now we're finding as we move into the past.
Who are we fooling?
Good things never last.
Accept the difference, between you and I.
Bring on extinction of the human kind.
The is a backward journey.
