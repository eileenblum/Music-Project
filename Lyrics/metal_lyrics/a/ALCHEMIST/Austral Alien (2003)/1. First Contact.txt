You landed your ships on a foreign land.
Discovered worlds you didn't understand.
A world full of creatures that you've never seen.
Flora and fauna beyond your dreams.
Seeking out a new world, exploit it as your own.
Habitual resources expired.
Choose the land of plenty.
Observe and abduct, apply and extract.
Reacting to different cultural extremities.
Revel in isolation.
Secrets unknown.
Foreign being ritual.
Invading their homes.
You take without asking, you take without reason or consequence.
Imposing cultural belief system, the masses in the palm of your hands.
First contact from a new world, first contact from another life.
First breeding of two worldly minds, first offspring to be left behind.
Who made first contact?
What made first contact?
Where was first contact?
This is first contact.
