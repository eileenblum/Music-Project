Trapped between your faith and your life
Guilty of lenient strides
In the walk you have chosen to take
Do you feel guilty now?

Forceless and shame filled you judge
They are wrong but you can't hold a grudge
Contradictions you swallow each day
You know they're guilty now

Is it true that you can't sleep at night?
They are free now to fulfil their plight
They are wrong but you leave them to fly
Its you that's guilty now

And you're falling
To your calling
Don't judge me

You're caught between your thoughts
And the words from your mouth
You can't judge others, or you will be judged
Can't you see the contradictions?
Your faith that has failed
Let the guilty be free and the innocent jailed

And falling
To your calling
Self-entrapment
Self-important
And you're failing
So they're laughing
