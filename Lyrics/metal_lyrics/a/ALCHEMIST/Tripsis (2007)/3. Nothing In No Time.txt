Try to choose the best path for my life
To have ambition and to strive

Pushing forward driving on
Feeling like you're going nowhere
Feel the pressure self imposed
Feel you're neither here or there
Tame your thoughts to simple goals
Simplicity impossible
Stay on the path no deviation
Fight to reach the destination
Plan, plot, work, strive, bleed, burst
Hope your dreams will stay alive
Black lining, single siding
No false conviction to be hiding
Head down, tales up, reaching goals, no giving up
Push forward, highest gear, only obstacle is fear

Don't give up
Don't give in
You'll have nothing in no time
