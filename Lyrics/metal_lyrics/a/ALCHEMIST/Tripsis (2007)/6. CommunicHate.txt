I feel bound by modern trappings
You can always find me where I'm hiding
We communicate with velocity
Lost on a senseless quest for humanity
So far apart but it's a small world
So close to me yet held away
Communichate no face to face
There has to be a better way
Born to communichate
Our nature seals our fate
Refuse to communichate
A severed line
Try a way to fold life at the seams
Hide from your responsibilities
To talk to people not machines
And find out that we're all discommunicating
Human beings will seal their fate
Unless we can communicate
Man is made of flesh and bone
To speak through lips, put down the phone
