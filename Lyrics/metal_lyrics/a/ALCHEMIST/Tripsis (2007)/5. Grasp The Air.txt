Hear it now, it's nothing new
Challenge awaits, it beckons you
Head above water. Try to survive
Through crashing waves
Battle through life
Bend and suffer for the usurper
The ones you help will help themselves
But you keep on climbing further
Despite the broken higher shelf
Head above water. Try to survive
Through crashing waves. Battle through life
Empty promise, suiting selves - Grasp the air
Work and save, spend on nil - Grasp the air
On the outer not inside all alone
Your closest kindred knock you off your thrown
Do you ever get the feeling that you battle all alone?
For things in life that seem important
Cannot leave the comfort zone
