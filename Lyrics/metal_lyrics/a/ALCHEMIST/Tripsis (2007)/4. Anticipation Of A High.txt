Sweet - Anxious behaviour awaiting your saviour
Time - Expanding contorting all concepts aborted
Wait - for your ticket to escape reality
Lie - to yourself every time you say all is fine
Your life is under scalpel
Slicing carving through your thoughts
Can you bear to live another day?
Social vice, attractive gamble
With your health and sanity
You plan your day to reach your high
Rise - anticipate the high
And fall, to ground
Your saviour, not found
Wasting time, redundant life
Sleep and lie, awake to find, it's gone
You're dependant from now on
And you believe in your own lies
Anticipation of a high
