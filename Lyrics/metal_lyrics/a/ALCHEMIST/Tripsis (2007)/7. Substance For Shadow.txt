Well let's look at the facts
We've got this we've got that
You feel fulfilled, you're satisfied
I highly doubt your truth denied
A leap of faith. A brave new world
To push the boundaries
Will you ever know?
Substance for shadow
I hear you say it's what I know
Totally safe above the board
But what I hear there's something more
Human desire takes control
Take a chance, a new sea change
And you may find fortune favours the brave
But if you don't, then step right up
And come and ride the treadmill of life
Around and round you go
