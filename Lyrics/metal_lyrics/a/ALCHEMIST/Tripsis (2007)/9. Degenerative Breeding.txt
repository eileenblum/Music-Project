Clones abound
Replicas all around
The blind will follow
The minds of the shallow

Masses are telling you
Can't do what you want to
Ignore the blind beliefs
Be a god not a slave

To speak without voice
To choose without choice
To steal without theft
To kill without death

There are many who will try to hold you down
But mediocrity it is the easy ground

Wasted time becomes your history
Invest yourself in your prosperity
Clarity creates a certainty
No matter what you are
Or what you want to be

Self-belief should be your self-release
Strive to advance yourself
Don't live by living deceased

You don't live by living
You don't live by living deceased
