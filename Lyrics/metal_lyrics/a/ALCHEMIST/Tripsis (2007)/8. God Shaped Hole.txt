Desperate and depraved
You've lost your way again
Broken and battered
Towards the face of sin
Demons and thieves
Distract the path you choose
Tunnel vision prevents the world
From ever reaching peace

You know, you know
Been there before
You know, you know
You're not really sure
Your god shaped hole
You know, you know
Within yourself
We're here to help

It's what you want but maybe not
Your quest your curse it can't be stopped
Throw it in. It's where it begins
To take control from your god shaped hole
