Molten rock lays dormant, around a tiny star, 
As microscopic life forms, approaches from afar. 
Traveling infinity, the rock and ice collides,
Hostile possibilities, destruction bringing life. 
Hurling through the cosmos, a frozen world of ice Macro amino acids, 
the building blocks of life, 
Contained in basic compounds. 
The plan for life persists, 
To start the evolution, 
The world where we exist. 

[CHORUS] Build our world, from this dust.

Elements and molecules, why we exist today. 
Speed toward our system, a million miles a day. 
Suspended in a frozen form, macrobiotics sleep.
Colliding with our mother, evolution's free. 
So free your evolution, Is this how we came to be? 
Bio-approach is the only reason we live. 

[CHORUS]
