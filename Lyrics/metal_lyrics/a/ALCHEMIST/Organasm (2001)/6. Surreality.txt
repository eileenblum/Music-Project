I can't believe existence, is confined to this life. 
And I can't tell the difference, between the truth and lies. 

[CHORUS:] Surreality, surreal, reality. 
Is this really me, or just an idea in my mind? 

Sometimes it seems that being, 
Is all within my mind, 
In truth I'm seeking comfort, 
To difficult to find. 
Infernal lobe resistance, fact and fiction are the same.
Please let all the answers be unleashed from my brain. 

Surreality, surreal, reality. 
Is this really me, or just an idea in my mind?
