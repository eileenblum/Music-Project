All that I see, enhanced chemically. 
Watch the sea, and feel your thoughts,
They pass by. 
See the way the sky and sea become one. 
Chemicals within mind and the sea. 
Makes me wonder if this really is me. 

[CHORUS:]
Stare in, reach out, 
Tide in, mind out. 
Reach in, stare out, 
Stare in, reach out.
Tide in, mind out. 

All that I see, enhanced chemically.
Watch the sea, and feel your thoughts, 
They pass by. 
See the way the sky and sea become one.
Chemicals within m mind and the sea. 
Makes me wonder if this really is me.

[Chorus]

Plentiful, awe inspiring. 
Endless energy, never tiring.
