Forced to hear your words, though they might be true. 
Say what you will,
others have different points of view. 
Iâm hearing all that you say. 
You forgot no oneâs the same. 
This cannot be, you rant and rave. 
Open your mind, yourself youâll save. 
There comes a time in everyoneâs life. 
Where we choose to question our times, 
In the end itâs all the same. 
You believe you have certain rights. 
Itâs just a factor of human plight, 
Youâre just one side of the game. 
Donât pretend to hear what I say, 
And itâs not the truth you relay, 
But my mind youâll never change. 
Different thoughts go on in our heads. 
There is truth in all that is said, 
We should be careful where we tread. 

Seek to find the causes that evade you. 
Try to like the people that resent you, 
Clear your mind of fog, 
So you can see through, 
Donât forget that no one is the same.

Seek to find the causes that evade you. 
Try to like the people that resent you, 
Clear your mind of fog, 
So you can see through, 
Donât forget that no one is the same. 

A coin thatâs single sided,
Must have the odds unbalanced. 
I call for heads, 
You call for tails.
Nothing is won, nothing prevails. 
A coin thatâs single sided, 
Must have the odds unbalanced. 
There are two sides to balance your mind, 
Look deep inside itâs there that youâll find it, 
Spend all your life tying to hide it, 
Donât criticize until you have tried it, 
Youâre single sided.
