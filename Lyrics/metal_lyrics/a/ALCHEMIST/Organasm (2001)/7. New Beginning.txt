There's a new uprising coming for us. 
A new beginning from the difficult past. 
A smarter way for us to live out our dreams, 
And every move we make is better than it seems. 
It's a new beginning. 
A new beginning and it's starting right now. 
It's a new beginning and may all our deeds be done.
There's a new uprising coming for us. 
A new beginning from the difficult past. 
A smarter way for us to live out our dreams, 
And every move we make is better than it seems. 
We've been through all of it, the good and the bad. 
We just get over it, we know the best is yet to come. 
We deal with every type, the exploiters and the true, 
We don't rely on hype, quality always pulls us through. 
Sometimes it seems shrouded, 
Like we will never break through. 
On other times, the sun it shines, on all that we do. 
No matter what were dealt, were staying true to the cause. 
Breaking down the misconceptions, make our own laws. 
Today - Right now.
