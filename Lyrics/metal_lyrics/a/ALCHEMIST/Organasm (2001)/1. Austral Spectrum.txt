Iris reflects, your focus on beauty. 
Instant burning of stratosphere and ground. 
Visually harsh, the spectral extremes. 
Tempt you with shade, drawing you in. 
Don't be fooled by placid appearance, 
Like a colossal planetary vulva consumes. 
She tempts us with aqua, but offers us desert.
She shows her aggression, while remaining placid, 
And we exploit all that she gives. 
Burnt...Charred, yet continuous birth remains. 
Iris reflects, your focus on beauty. 
Intense blending of green and brown. 
Widen the spectrum. 
Colours the visual expression of nature, 
Visually harsh are the spectral extremes, 
Widen the spectrum.
