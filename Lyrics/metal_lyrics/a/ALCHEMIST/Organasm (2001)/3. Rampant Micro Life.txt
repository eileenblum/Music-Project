Slowly cells mutate, reform, degenerate. 
Reposes our stolen fate. 
Nuclei tears it's self in two. 
Reproduction breaking through, 
Confirming what is true. 

[REPEAT] This womb is warm, so life must form. 

Unaware of living, continue to divide. 
Through aeons of mutation, variety of life. 
Breaking through the masses, 
A form of life is born. 
Destruction in it's nature,
Humanity is spawned. 
Rampant Micro Life. 
Rampant Micro Life. 

Cells join and divide, 
New forms of life they seek, 
Destruction at it's peak. 
Rampant Micro Life. 
Rampant Micro Life. 
Rampant Micro Life. 
Rampant Micro Life.

Unaware of living, continue to divide. 
Through aeons of mutation, variety of life. 
Breaking through the masses, 
A form of life is born. 
Destruction in it's nature, 
Humanity is spawned.
