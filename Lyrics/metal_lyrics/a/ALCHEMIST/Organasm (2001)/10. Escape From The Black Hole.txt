Drawn towards, pull away. 
Mass compressed, and escape. 
Not knowing what the
threat has instore, 
Don't ignore the warnings they gave. 
It will try to tear us apart. 
But in unity we are saved. 
Ignorant and blind, 
It threatens from afar. 
No sense within it's mind, 
It's seeking ways to justify. 
And there's no cause to find. 
It let's us know it's plans. 
It's programmed to destroy. 
It's torn apart with it's own hands. 
Try to crush the seek that must grow. 
Wishing on a strongers demise. 
Thinking that you know all you know. 
Encrypting the truth in it's lies. 

[CHORUS:]
Poised on the edge of your mindless plans, 
Does the fear inside make the threat seem real. 

Attractive, destructive, resist the gravitational force. 
Appear as a lamb, revealed as a wolf, 
Enticed by promises true and false, 
Reactive, seductive, 
Fate is simply running it's course. 
Ignorant and blind, It threatens from afar. 
No sense within it's mind, 
It's seeking ways to justify. 
And there's no cause to find. 
It let's us know it's plans. 
It's programmed to destroy. 
It's torn apart with it's own hands. 
Try to crush the seek that must grow. 
Wishing on a strongers demise. 
Thinking that you know all you know. 
Encrypting the truth in it's lies. 

[Chorus]
