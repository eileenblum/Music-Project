As we awaken
And the thoughts of spirits and daemons
Fade from our retinas
And the gods up high fall from function
We arise alone
Our eyelids burn in the darkness
Not yet ready to open
And reap what was once sown

On that day in the endless blackness
When gods are remodeled into paradigms
With adze I must carve
And disfigure the deity into the zeitgeist

Mutilated and disowned
The fallen gods of old lose favour
Paradigms are hewn from the ashes of gods

Unquestioned and omnipresent
With calloused hands I heap axiom upon axiom

My feet sink deep into the mire
But unrelenting I am
As the edifice surges skyward

Stand back and gaze at our wonder
A contorted tapestry of taboo
A monolith of unquestionable questions

As lichen consumes the crumbling miscreation
Its beginnings fade from memory
And it towers as the wind and the stars

Bow before our orthodoxy
Merchants of snake oil
Within temples of aeons past
Now preachers of the bazaar
Peddling their filth
To the starving congregation
Stagnant ideologies
Deities of nouveau
Pungent and lurid dogmas
Blind my infantile eyes from the sinewy manacles
Which constrict my hands

Upon hands and knees I fall
Becoming one with the sea of rats that surrounds me
I see writhing heretics
Swept away in the formless swarm

Engulfed in the mass and the frenzy
I gaze as the crooked monolith
As it descends into the morass
