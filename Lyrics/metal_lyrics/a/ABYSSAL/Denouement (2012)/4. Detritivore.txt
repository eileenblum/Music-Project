A swarm descends
Their numbers swell
The stench of decayed sunlight fills my nostrils
Inhaled into lungs of steel and concrete
From subterranean halls of stone

Gripped by unseemly fetishes for ancient detritus
I gorge upon the future
I swallow âtil choking
No regrets are expressed

Come with me to the pool
Bury deep your face
In the skies of antiquity
Devour our elixir
Become like me

Viscous black fluid
Hangs at our mouths
Our muscles swell in its influence
Vast prostheses
Of steel and glass
Burst forth from our flesh

The nostrum of the colossus
The nostrum of us

I watch
Hordes of my offspring
Grotesque abstractions of form
Crawling on their bellies to the dying spring
Mists of frenzy descend upon the dwindling pools
I have done this

Colossi decay
Extremities rust in dereliction
A tumultuous hysteria of anguish echoes upon these stone walls
As they are alone and mortal
Bloodshed and death is all they shall know
