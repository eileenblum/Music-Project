Enter the translucent spire
And inhale the fragrance of oak and satin
Sever the wretched rags of turmoil
From mind and body alike
And cover your ears for words beyond the threshold

Take refuge beneath my wing of tattered skin
Bestowed upon me by leaders up high
And I shall shelter you from the scalding rain

Hear my augury
Of endless torment and sorrow
And choose your path with baited breath

Use my eyes to see
And watch allies and friends become as serpents
See the thick vines of treachery
Upon which you have never laid sight
Weaving grotesquely from roots ubiquitous

Pour yourself into me
And I shall channel your passions
I shall fulfill your longings and heal the scars of old and new

My prophecies are the blade
 And my proclamations the buckler

Take arms and heed
For knowledge is the foe
Speak not of mortal triumph
So paltry and arrogant
Dust and blood at outset and end
Nothing more

From my tower of ivory
I watch

In madness they flail
And with lunaticâs words they howl
The final dusk comes
And no thought for the morrow is taken
