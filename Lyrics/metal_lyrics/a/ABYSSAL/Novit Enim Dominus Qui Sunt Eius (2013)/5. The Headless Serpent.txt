A beast approaches
In this winding labyrinth
The walls moist with echoes

My blade finds no deathblow
No weakness is apparent
A battle so futile
From each wound pours a sea of serpents
No head to this nemesis
No end to this struggle
An endless ouroborus
Feeding upon its own demise
