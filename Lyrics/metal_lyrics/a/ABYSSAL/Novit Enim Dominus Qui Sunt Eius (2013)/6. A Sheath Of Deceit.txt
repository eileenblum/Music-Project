Hands drenched in blood and viscera
Yet none sleep sounder

I breathe poison
And scribble falseness

Incantations are weaved
I follow, mesmerised 

Symbology sears your lips closed
As all the waters are stirred
The tumult; a maelstrom
Meaning lost to a writhing deceit

Eyes seared closed
All is as I say
