A father and child in delirium
Vomit wrenched from the infant's gullet
Smeared across the stone floor
As penance and sacrifice

The pauper's emaciated form
With hollow eyes
Gazes to the bastion

With toxic words
He is bathed in gold
Bones are buried beneath satin

Bread and meat are left to rot
In ritual catatonia

Carry my burdens of dreams and longings
Watch in ecstasy
The procession of retrogrades
To the waiting of grinding teeth

Starving bowels
Cast aside the feast
And burn for the semen of magnates
