Ancient verses
Of nomads and wanderers
Burned upon my tongue
And as acid in my blood

Encroacher
No sky or lord may bind

In disgusting envy
Home becomes alien
The kiss of dust hath blessed this land
Stricken and listless
In this ocean of warring leviathans

In bitter malaise
Books become swords
And false promises are tarnished armour

Words of the foolish dead
Rise up as babbling kin
In their midst I am
Where millennia are as one
Jaded and formless in deafening vitriol

Entrenched by the fires of our past
With only visions of endless storms
They shall burn beneath my wretched sun
