A skyline of turmoil
Screams reach high
Over hills of iron

More falls from your lips
The words concentrate and shatter
Their naked falsity apparent

The bones of your shoulders grind upon mine
In the dust we drown

Teeth into flesh
Find naught but gristle and jaws

Numbers dare not speak our name
