In black and white
I navigate this journey
With right and wrong upon my back

In black and white
I choose my path
With good and evil on my lips

In black and white
I forge ahead
With truth and lies as my guides

In black and white
I find kinship
With sanity and madness lighting my way

Never faltering
Never wavering

In black and white
I pass my rite
With sanctity and heresy at my flanks

In black and white
I become myself
With otherness and mutuality at my hand

The erstwhile truth
Fading slowly beyond sight
The path obstructed

From the chrysalis I emerge
Into this world of grey
