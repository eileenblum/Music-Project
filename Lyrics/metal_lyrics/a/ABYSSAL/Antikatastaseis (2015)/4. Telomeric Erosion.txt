With catatonic eyes
And impetuous spirit
We gaze starward
While the wolves of old
Ravage our homesteads
While quicksand devours
Our steadfast stance

Legs of flesh strain to hold aloft
The ill conceived colossus
Chiselled so haphazardly from heroes and idols
Bones crack and buckle
Beneath the crushing weight
Of a yokesworth ambitions piled high

I run
With brittle fingers I claw for the horizon
Untiring death follow
The earth cracks beneath my fumbling gait
Our gazes meet as bodies wither
Indifference is my only courtesy

This death is final
For I am all

How I lament and revel
Within the romance of my decay
As ideals and endeavors become as ashes
Swept aloft in the faltering winds

Dreams of the stars
And intoxicating immortality
Draped like a veil so threadbare
Obscuring a death we share

Beneath this distant sky
In the twilight of our time
The fading light and dulcet tones
As the shadows grow long
And the stars dim

All that was made is unmade
All that was discovered is swept in to obscurity

All that I have been falls from recollection
And all that is ceases to be
