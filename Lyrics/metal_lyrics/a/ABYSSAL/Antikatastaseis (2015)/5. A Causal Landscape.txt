I am tethered to all
And all to me
With each movement, a cascade of consequence
Propagating about the epicenter
In chaos so amorphous

I watch these cast chains
Tear apart the innocent
Drive sane men to madness
Rip trees from the earth and erode the land

Yet it is us who paint the faces of villains
On the shifting sands

Laplace's demon does baulk
To writhe in helicoidal futility
Ignorant of that beyond

We are complacent
In our end
