As ancient stone I am
Here I stand for evermore

From high I gaze at this world so frail
And ignore its false pleas

For it is as I
Eternal
No paltry action can quake this titan
Hewn from might above

Before these gates to higher forms
I marvel at such intricacy
With myself at its center

For all which is here is made
And all which occurs is decided

The kiss of rain
Falling from the skies
Flowing down my face to the shambling ground

Pools grow beneath my feet
Betwixt the crops of stone and earth

Yet the droplets see no wonder
In the majesty of their order

None proclaim their divinity
As they grasp the rock so tight

Floods and fire see my end
Birthed into this realization
Yet flesh rots
And bone dissolves
Before dogma yields its ugly head

I see folly and failing
No longer distant whimpers
But eviscerating howls
Tearing at my eyes and face

But I am Alpha
I am Alpha and Omega
How do I crumble away?

This was to be the death of another
Not mine
