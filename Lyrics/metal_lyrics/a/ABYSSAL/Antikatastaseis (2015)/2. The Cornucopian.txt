A trembling sea of bulbs and blossoms
Flowering from dirt
From each, tenfold more burst
And tenfold more from all again

Hear my decree
Let perpetua guide and rule
Look around you
And marvel at the unwritten emergence

These words I take
And hold close to my sunken chest
In comfort I babble my creed

Yet lost I am
In the labyrinthine present
I gaze not into the shrieking caverns of coming time
