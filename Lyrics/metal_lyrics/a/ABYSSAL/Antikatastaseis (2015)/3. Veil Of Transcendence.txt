From chaos I am forged
Within me a churning maelstrom
Unimaginable in scale

I walk within endless halls
In suffocating cold

On the horizon I behold a pantheon
A speck of light against the sprawling darkness
Immense yet fragile
A structure with no shape
Each facet is me

My gaze widens
Spiralling threads intertwine and unravel
With no beginning nor end
Stretching off to infinity both before and behind me
And in all directions above and below

Winding helices and gnarled nexuses
Conjoined to countless 
Ablaze with searing entropy, they burn my eyes
With pulsing tones they scream unlistenable melodies

Each point of light so meaningless
Each tone so trite and drudging
Yet I am awash in a cascade
Of words, ideals and laws
I am bathed in the pale glow
Of whirring thoughts and longings

In majesty I weep
For one moment
Emerging from the howling cold
A silent clarity

I reach out to touch the reflection
But in an instant it shatters
Churning illusion sweeps me away

I am tempered in ancient twilight
My face bears the scars of colliding worlds
And my bones echo the dying roars of archaic stars
