Life - cycle
A constant rush for fabricated a luck
What is your luck?
A career? Money? An everyday comfort?
I am losing in this crowd rush
I see nothing, I do not feel anything, I am falling down
Bottomless hole of my despair
Go away! I am falling down deeper and deeper
This world gives nothing
A hypocrisy, an evil and a hatred are intersecting
our way everyday, are butting in our minds
We are taking them like matter of course
Rust of indifferences blunted our feeling
We are losing in this reek dirt
We are falling down, we are not realising the fall
We are falling down into a bog which we are creation
Go away!
A fall nowhere
