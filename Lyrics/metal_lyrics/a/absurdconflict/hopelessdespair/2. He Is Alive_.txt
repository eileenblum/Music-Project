He is alive!
By blood warped fragment
A young body pulled out
from a pile of crashed metal
He is alive!
For a present he is still alive
Help was fast
A basic step to survive
For the present he is still alive
A body stained with blood
Before a few moments
full of life yet
Just paralysed, utterly cutted
Dreadful puppet in its life-size
Warning synonymum of death
By tipple smelled paralysed puppet
He is alive!
For the present he is still alive
Help was on time
It is not as that always
This one is alive,
but majority like him is a pity
