There's a lot of places in the world
where violence and wrath engrave bitter wrinkles into people's faces.
Laugh has lost, fear and worries about their friends are killing the most vulnerable feeling - a love.
Over homes, which are in ruins, wind is playing in discs of smoke.
Hunger is everywhere, fertile fields have drunk more blood and tears then drops from heaven cloudy cushions.
The country, which is a lot.
Blood, tears and people heart's grief are there only trivialized and uninteresting non-essentials.
The country, which is a lot.
Countries, where instead of variace, violence and grudge they need most of all understanding and love.

Laugh has lost, frost burns deep in souls and new dawn is out of sight.
