Unvented rotter
Human dirt belonging to isolation
Sacrifice,
choice by a sheer chance
Without minimum planning
She is knocked down
Strokes, kicks, offences,
unconcealed depravity
Pain, ache
So unreal,
so vulnerabling
Dress is torn down
Horror of nightmares is reality
With knife on her neck she does not oppose
She must hold
Humbled,
lying under snorting swine
Horror of nightmares is reality
Rape
Feeling of dirt cannot wash off
Trauma, mental trauma
retains in memory for ever
It will not be such as earlier
Self-rejection, shackle of a shame
She will never forget
A cold-blooded rape
Death is ridiculous punishment
Unable to opposition
Unable to defence
Dishonoured with ineffaceabled
scar on her soul
Pain, lifelong smart pain
Dishonoured with ineffaceabled
scar on her soul
