Your daring plans into your future
changed suddenly into a dust
Blindness
The darkness instead of colors
You do not see
That is just terrible feeling
It came to you unexpectedly

All at once you need the help of the others
Your friends cease to know you
Despair, empty loneliness
You cease to exist for them
Just the memories are staying
Despair, empty loneliness

They depreciated you, they say you are different,
crippled, second-rated
You do not understand, but it hurts inside
They depreciated you and it hurts inside

You are the same as they are
Just the darkness in front of your eyes ...
Everlasting darkness and their prejudice
You are the same as they are
They do not understand that
They are blinder then you are
They do not understand that
