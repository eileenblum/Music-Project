[dedicated to Maximilien Varnier]

Hidden in creativity 
Manifestation of a noble concept
Shaping up within a sensitive mind
The message that will remain unheard

Misunderstood?
Rejected?
Communication objectiveless

The spirit speaks forth alive
The motives are strong and fair

To fly 

It's easy to regard one as mad
The only support you will find within society

Thoughts that breed in your mind
Dance on the edge of a nervous breakdown

The stream breaks against the deep sunk stones of rigid wisdom
The drops shine in the sun, ideas left falling down
It does little good trying to harness mind so eager
Before we find it we shall lose something we never had

It's easy to regard one as mad
The only support you will find within societyThe message remains unheard
Creating counter-concept of human tragedy

The river flows sublime
Frolicking over the rocks 
That meant little hindrance once
The final rhyme is yours - to fly and fall

The pent up visions aimlessly seek realization
Look back and lose your confidence being so naive
The substances that back your mind with artificial optimism
A pitiable existence with no alternative

Misunderstood
Rejected
Your motives were strong and fair
