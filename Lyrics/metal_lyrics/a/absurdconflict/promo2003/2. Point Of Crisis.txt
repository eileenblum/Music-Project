Standing in front of the mirror
An avalanche of searing emotions
Terrified and thoughtless
A subject to condemn

Feeling alone
Fearing away
Terrified and hopeless
A subject to regret

Energy of the young body
Pulsing under the mental
Closure, panicking within
Failure - the cardinal
Cause, devoid of motivation
The emptiness inside your mind
The obstacles drain you of spirit

Drain you of spirit

No thoughts, devoid of reactions
More desperation breeds
Nailing me down

No vision, I drown in social void
It still remains
Nailing me onto this cross

The struggle inside is pathetic

There is noone, there is no word, there is no way to set me free
There is noone, there is no word, there is no way to let me be
There is noone, there is no word, there is no hope - obscurity
There is noone, there is no word, there is no ho pe - eternally

The lack of friends, to comprehend
To listen, to find caressing words
I reach my hand to the void again
The beat of the young heart condemned

There is noone, there is no word, there is no way to set me free
There is noone, there is no word, there is no way to let me be
There is noone, there is no word, there is no hope - obscurity
There is noone, there is no word, there is no hope :

No thoughts, devoid of reactions
More desperation breeds
Nailing me down

No vision, I drown in social void
It still remains
Nailing me onto this cross
