My faithful companion
I've lost my way once again
A prisoner of darkness
I let you down my friend

The time has come to testify
All the feelings I've been holding back

How many times must a man fall down
How many dreams have to fall to the ground
Maybe I was born to wander
I have no high hopes any longer

So tell me my friend
Just where does it end
Will nothing free me
From this hell I'm living in

I cannot blame myself anymore
I've been beaten and accused before
Well I took some bad advice
And I paid too high a price

How can some people have the nerve
Hell hasn't frozen but it's on the verge
It has gone way past the point of greed
How many life times shall we need
How many times must a man fall down
How many dreams have to fall to the ground
Is nothing ever gonna free me
From this hell I'm living in

Why so much pain
I cry for forgiveness
I'm a destitude man
Who still remains

It's so hard to explain
Before I leave this world

The time has come to testify
All the feelings I've been holding back
It's time - to set them free
It's time - to set them free

I cannot blame myself anymore
I've been beaten and accused before
Well I took some bad advice
And I paid t oo high a price
