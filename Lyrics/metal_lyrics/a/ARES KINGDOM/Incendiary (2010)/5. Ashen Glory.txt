Across the deserts in flight to the Temple of the Sun
Ashen glory â winged monarch, alights upon the pyre
His wings outstretched to embrace destiny
Ablaze with light, five-century cycle

Renewed

Ashen Glory set to blaze, bring the Heavens to Earth
Descend to rise, symbolize immortality
Proudly the Phoenix reigns in immortal fire
Assuage the anguish and fear of...

Oblivion

At third light appears the reborn majesty
In gold, in purple, in victory over death
Descend to rise â resplendent wings ablaze
Illuminate â trace the contours of time

Ashen glory set to blaze, wings enfold, eternity...

Ashen glory
Ashen glory
Ashen glory â descend to rise â death and glory

Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
