A taste of radiation and the vision appears
Challenge infinity to chart the mind of God
Party dogma galvanized by blind faith
At the point of grace - place your faith and cower

Crawl the heroes' graves on your knees, waves and waves of sickness churn
Blazing altar of wormwood - half-life contaminate â endless burn

The beast shudders towards its destiny
One â twenty-three - forty-four, Prometheus' throne ablaze
The angel's dusty halo burns and radiates
Liquidators choke and vomit out their souls

Crawl the heroes' graves on your knees, waves and waves of sickness churn
Blazing altar of wormwood - half-life contaminate â endless burn

Dancing with the heathens
Bend your will - absolve your sins
Place your faith and cower
Clutching the savior's beard as he falls
To look back now would be your fall
There is no return...
