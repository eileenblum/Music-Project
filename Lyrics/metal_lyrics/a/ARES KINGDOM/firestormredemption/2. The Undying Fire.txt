Children of confusion awake!
Grasp the reigns of power
And as we master this world
Our cleansing fires consume the placid

The Hydra of modern piety beckons-
Provoking our deepest convictions
Our coils of strength &amp; virtue
Arise like a diamond backed serpent

Many heads of deviance clamor
Denying this new morning twilight
They spit poison &amp; contempt upon us
But we wear their scorn with pride

From the mountains to the hinterlands
Burns this Undying Fire...
Recreants could not extinguish it,
The everlasting standard restored

Restoration:the Icon &amp; Sword
An enduring standard is raised
Restoration of the Undying Fire
