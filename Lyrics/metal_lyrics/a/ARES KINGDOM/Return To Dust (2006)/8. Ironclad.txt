We've survived a firestorm of derision
And now their weakness is revealed
The hydra called modernity has failed
And wether or not the flock understands...
The blood of our fathers must be justified
Justified at all costs
This faul, faul world ridden with apathy
has lost its place in all things

I am as the serpent's crest
Ouroborous and Regal at once
The world at the center of my coil
My tail consumed, leaves me hungry for more

Finding courage in the spheres
Horizons dark as ever before
Once you come this way
You'll never wish to return
The path is of fire and lit by pain
Stark truths are their own reward
Dreams and illusions shatter like glass
Sans sympathy for its own sake

I am as the serpent's crest
Ouroborous and Regal at once
The world at the center of my coil
Sans sympathy for its own sake

From nothingness to nothingness
Black clouds parting for the dawn
From far beyond the voices still sound
Made wretched by the distance we've come
I've lived to fight another day
The day of infamy - declaration of war
