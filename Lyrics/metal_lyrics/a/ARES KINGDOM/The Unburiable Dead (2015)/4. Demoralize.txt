Let us surround them
Speak the language of fire â
Scrawl blasphemy upon your shells
And rip from them salvation

Churn the corpses in the earth
Rain their departed back into their arms
Cover them in their brotherhood to embrace
Demoralize

Mark each sunrise with terror
And horror-illuminated sunsets with blood
Their valiant entrails as ribbons
Shredded to decorate enemy uniforms
Awarded to every survivor

Leave nothing to chance
The clinched fist of God bursting downward

Churn the corpses in the earth
Rain their departed back into their arms
Cover them with their brotherhood to embrace
Demoralize

Let it give no pleasure but relief
For our fear is just as great
And our uniforms decorated as theirs
Shredded crimson ribbons of brotherhood
