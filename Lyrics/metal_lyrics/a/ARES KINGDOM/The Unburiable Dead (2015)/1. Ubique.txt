Awaiting its hourâ¦
Mobilisation means war
And He followed at midnight
Announced with incredible atrocity
Souls driven forward into the arms of death
Patriotism left at the railhead
Fervor even further back
Lions all, led by donkeys
All fed with steel - contorted
Seed slain one by one
Declarations mask a hideous face

Wave upon wave
Upon wave upon wave
Wave upon wave
Upon wave upon wave

Pronounced with incredible atrocity
Declarations shake the foundations
Give throat to the spirit of preservation through destruction
Have faith in your creator, War
Death comes to us all, after all

But who authors such a document?
When is stayed the hand of God?
(Left to) contemplate endless supplication

Wave upon wave
Upon wave upon wave
Wave upon wave
Upon wave upon wave

We are left to write the dedication - Do it in blood
It is âhim,â âthey,â âwe,â âthemâ - Dedicate it in blood
