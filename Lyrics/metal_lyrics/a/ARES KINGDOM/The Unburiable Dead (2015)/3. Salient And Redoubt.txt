A creeping barrage wakes the sun
Dawn breaks red, reflecting the blood
Upon the ground
Godâs hand seems a clinched fist
Bursting downwards
Gericht â Indiscriminate
Pock-marked, bruised earth
Daybreak welcomed with blasphemies
But we hold

Salient and Redoubt
Speak with the mouthless dead en clar
A code of blood, of sweat, of piss, of puke
Weâre here because weâre here
Hell no longer of fire and flame
Hell is mud
