A night so dark, stars cast my shadow upon the ground
The lights of civilization have been extinguished
Flares now compete with our memory of the sun
Searchlights dance as fire illuminates
Emblazoned with courage amid abject fear
Silhouetted across the sky
Who can sit by?
Mailed fist now outstretched
Grasps at dominion
Chosen, inviolable, predatory
The difference lies soaked in blood
Perish the carrion
A familiar dream of perpetual peace
History written in sand
A windswept shore full of revisions
Due the tide
And if I have slaughtered an angel
May the earth rest lightly upon my valiant enemy
Or cast him to Hell from whence he came
My nom de guerre â I care not
