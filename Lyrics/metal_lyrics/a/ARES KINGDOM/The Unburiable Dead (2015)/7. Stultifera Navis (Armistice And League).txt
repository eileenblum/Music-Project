Cease fire! Cease fire! Cease fire!
The Devil is sick of sin
Silence returns to tolerate vanities
The ram of pride lives on

Sick menâs hands direct a sham passion play
Ancient bulwarks collapsed into trenches
Recomposed in convulsions
Shed blood to rust the cuirass

Seething masses and courage rising visible
As heat above a flame -
Distorting all around
Days of hell let loose
Plaintive voice spoke delusion to the deaf
Beyond good and evil
Beyond hope and full of fear

Will to powerlessness
Push the salt further into the wound
While giving thanks to almighty God
For ending the violent miracle
Memories of guttering flares arc above
Another day dims in reverence for the departed
Tides bore and delivered -
Stultifera Navis
Adriftâ¦
