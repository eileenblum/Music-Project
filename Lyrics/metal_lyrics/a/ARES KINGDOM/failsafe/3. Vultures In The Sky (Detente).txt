Can't you see we don't care about you? 
Can't you see we don't want your kind? 
We give you weapons to kill each other 
Can't you see, or are you blind? 

Vultures in the sky, flying overhead 
Vultures in the sky looking for the dead 
Vultures in your sky 

You're doing just what we want you to do 
killing off your population 
We've got you by your stupid pride 
Rewarding it with frustration 

Vultures in the sky, flying overhead 
Vultures in the sky looking for the dead 
Vultures in the sky, flying overhead 
Vultures in the sky, they're looking for the dead
