Burning skies - raining fire 
Dowm on the helpless below 
Hell has come - storming legions 
Iron eagles - angels of death 

Searing wings - roar as thunder 
Burning the life right out of the night 
Heavens above - slaughtered outright 
Reducinf bodies to ashes and dust 

No more tomorrows - sunrise on a dead world 
Burning the shadows right into the walls 
Paying the price in self sacrifice 

Final breath - ends in fire 
Fallout snows its seeds of death 
Darkened skies - deadly quiet 
Nuclear winter settles its frost 
Pitiful end - human folly 
Centuries of work now scattered to dust 
Victor defeated - final chapter 
Closing the book and set it alight 

Failsafe - cannot be recalled 
Flee to nowhere - death consumes all 
Return to the earth from which you crawled 
Return to darkness - return to dust
