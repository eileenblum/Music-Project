They wander as motes of dust 
In a reserve as vast as all space 
(The space between the worlds) 
Here where the light shines but dimly 
Coiled and staring as the adder- 
Are courage and defiance... 
With eyes of fire and wings of gold 
They watch and they wait 

Images of the victory 
Burn as the central fire, 
Like the Lord of Worlds 
A great Creator, a great Destroyer 
With alpha and omega as standards 
(Convulsion, chaos and delusion between them) 

To symbolize omnipotence 
Beyond all litanies of man 
An awakening for the spirit 
The era of rebirth 

Courage grows like the tail of a comet 
As it falls inward - to destiny 

Rise red Star, God of war 
Midnight crimson eye on the skyline 
Riding high in the dawnlit sky 
Staring as if at an eclipsed sun 
Passing from the realms of light and life... 
The realms of sound now stilled 
Surging like the tide, empty skies begin to glow 

They wander as motes of dust 
In a reserve as vast as all space 
(The space between the worlds) 
Here where the light shines but dimly 
Coiled and staring as the adder- 
Are courage and defiance 
With eyes of fire and wings of gold 
They watch and they await... 
The era of rebirth
