Death Messiah
You're the one
Occult dreams
aren't your goal
Why you preach the Black Book
When handcuffs &amp; whips are
Your game
Death Messiah
Your religion
Only an excuse
Death Messiah
Diabolic desires
Are your major concern
Death Messiah
You're the king in your
Morbid fantasies
Death Messiah
You're insane
In your sick reality
(You reign)
Die for
Die for
Die for HIM!
