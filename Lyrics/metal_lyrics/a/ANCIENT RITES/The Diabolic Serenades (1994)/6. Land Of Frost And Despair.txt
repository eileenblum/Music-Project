Land of frost and misery
No hope for the future
Only the darkest goal
Only the darkest dreams
Darkest desires fill my soul
Land of Frost and Misery
Blasphemous games
No place for the weak
Only the Cold
No love
Darkest desires
Burn my soul
No place for a weak God
Only Black is real
No place for sun
Dark clouds
Land of Frost
Land of Frost
Land of Frost
No place to raise the children
Winter cannot bare new life
Land of the North
Only the darkest dreams
Touch my soul in
The Land of Frost
