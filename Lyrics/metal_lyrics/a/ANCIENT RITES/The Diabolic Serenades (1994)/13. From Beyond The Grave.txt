[Bonus Track]

My body is gone
My soul is dwelling
But this won't keep me from loving you
Forever and ever more
From Beyond the Grave
Just as I promised you
When I was alive
Death won't take away
My hunger for the Flesh
Forever I visit you
From Beyond the Grave
I love you to death
From Beyond the Grave
Join me on my journey to Hell

1994 After Dark Records
