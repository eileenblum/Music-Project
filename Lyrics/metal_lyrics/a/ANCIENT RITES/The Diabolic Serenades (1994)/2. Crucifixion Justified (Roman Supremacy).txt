Liar! False prophet! You must die!
Bastard! Spit on you! Liar! Weak loser!
Spit on your cross! Christ!
How can one possibly follow your weak rules
You promised heaven
Rather descend into hell
Die Jesus Die
You only played a game on earth
Only an empty grave awaits
Die Nazarene Christ!
You're hoping for a place in heaven Could be hell
Only an empty grave awaits
No resurrection! No place for weak idols
No one is our master
We create our own rules
The Roman Empire can't tolerate the weak
No partisan activities can bring our empire down
Don't threaten us!
