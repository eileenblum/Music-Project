Hate!
Take the blood, take the blood
Of my enemies
Total hate
I want them to die
Total misantropia
Who needs weak flesh or family
Total misantropia
Say whatever you want
Meant for me to hear
Hate is the only thing I feel
Destruction follows everywhere
Total misantropia
Hate!
I don't need this love
War!
Bloodshed
War!
Hate!
War!
Bloodshed eternally
I don't understand (love)
I don't want your love
Only Darkness and Hate!
Total misantropia!
If I had only more time (to)
Kill! Slaughter! Destroy!
The beauty of the pain
Destruction of the human race
