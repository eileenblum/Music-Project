Last man standing
Last man standing

Victory! Last man standing!
Valhalla!! Last man standing!

Shattered and mortally wounded
On the battlefield they lay
Farewell my fellow companions
Thy souls have gone away

(we shall not behold the green fields nor hear the birds sing
in may
to defend we have fought and won though with our life we paid)

Victory or Valhalla
Must again be the rallying cry
Ancient pride restored
Let the ancient banners fly high

Broken hilt in my hands
I saw my last break of day
Here and now we found our graves
Our bodies vultures prey
If our folk ever doubts
Or their souls have gone astray

Then lead the way to this place
Where our bones still lay
Stand strong with clenched fists
Withstand with all thy might

Stand strong with clenched fists
Until they are silenced right
Let the glory shine on thee
Lift thy ancient legacy... into light!
Lift thy legacy into light, so their spirits will
Shine on bright... shine bright!
Stand strong with clenched fists
Withstand with all thy might
Stand strong with clenched fists
Until they are silenced... right!!!

Victory or Valhalla must be
Again the rallying cry
Ancient pride restored
Let the ancient banners fly high

When the cause is noble and justice at thy side
To hold what is thine and the fight is right

Victory! Last man standing! Valhalla!
Last man standing!
Victory! Last man standing! Valhalla!
Last man standing!
