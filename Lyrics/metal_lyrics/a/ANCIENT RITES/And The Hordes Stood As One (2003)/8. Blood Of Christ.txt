One last look to the sky
Again my end is near
Declared 'criminal of war'
This is my final hour (Execution,
The end)... But the start of my dream
The start of my dream
Reborn I will be, forever I will hunt!
As a traveller throughout time
Reborn I will be
Forever I will hunt, forever I will be
As a traveller throughout time
The spear that tortured christ was mine!
Oh eva! Hold me once more, bite the apple
Who needs this paradise,
Who needs this paradise?!
I inspired nero to put rome into flames
A lieutenant I was, when napoleon
Set the world on fire!
Oh beautiful sight, mohammed being poisoned...
Bible or koran: Pathetic book of lies!
(We always lost a battle, eternally we
Won a war!!!)
The blood of god on my skin
The blood of allah on my hands
Porco dio! Porco dio!
Porco dio! Porco dio!
FÃ¼r immer! Voor altijd! Ainia!
Blasfemia eternal!!!!
