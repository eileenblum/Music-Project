Sieh das Morgenrot im Osten!
Die Welt ist ein Feuer!
Sieh das Morgenrot im Osten!
Befreit ihre Seele

(Behold the red dawn in the east!
The world is a fire!
Behold the red dawn in the east!
Liberate thy soul)

If Caesar crossed the Rubicon, so can thee
Rise like a Phoenix, conquer land and see
By will, Alexander emperor before thirty three
Set thy goals, let thy fierce spirit float free

History written by wolves, not written by sheep
No glory in hiding, no splendour in sleep
Victory or Valhalla might be thy fate
It does matter not, willpower one should rate
History written by wolves, not written by sheep
No glory in hiding, no splendour in sleep
Rise and fall, but above all rise again
Abolish past pains, thrown down thy chain

Let each of thee amid the fires
Search thy own willpower and desires
Dwell this earth like a wolf with hunger
Strengthen thy inner self and wander

Follow a path that made Pilate's laurel
Learn of a wolf packs much feared howl
Might is right when legions gather here
Cast out weakness, cast out fear
