A saviour that failed to save, preaching lack of will
A cave for a grave, midst convicts on Golgotha's Hill
The coming of a messenger, promises of a holy land
Dating back to Pagan days, another son heaven send

Crucified Nazarene thou did not bring the light
Poisened Mohammed where is your garden of delight?
Prophets of Christians and Muselmen, prophets of Hebrews
Turn man into lamb, an obeying flock to use
Crucified Nazarene thou did not bring the light
Poisened Mohammed where is your garden of delight?
Holy books cleverly written but by the hand of men
Beware of Gods' messengers and their enslaving pen

Guiding lines indeed required or else civilization fails
Yet pilate the one condemned in mythical religious tales
The worlds most known legends, but no historical facts
Devoted mass hysteria, although still evidence lacks

Each character in the books of faith an own epic part to play
But without Judas no martyr Jesus and did Mohammed not slay?
Hail to the lions, hail to the Romans, representing reality
Jehovah's or Allah's' chosen ones do not appeal to me

Galilean!
