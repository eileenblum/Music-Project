Clad in armour, strong of will
Eye for an eye, kill for a kill

"Allah Ahkbar", "God wills it"
Cross and half moon in total war
"Allah Ahkbar", "God wills it"
No quarter given, life evened the score
"Allah Ahkbar", "God wills it"
Moving into the holy land
"Allah Ahkbar", "God wills it"
Empires clashing in desert sand

Jerusalem a city lit
Did God demand? Did God forbid?

Pilgrims slaughtered by Saracen band
Saracens slaughtered by Christian hand
Templar Van Ruddervoorde in command
Templars' grandmaster of the Flemish land

Battling Saladin, knight of the moon
At the siege of Acre meeting his doom
Outnumbered he fell, in a far away land
The templars' life took an end

Azure eyed and golden haired
Forth the knights templar fared
While above troops devoted
Heraldic banners floated
