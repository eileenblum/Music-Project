Tired of obeying a God that always ruled like a tyrant 
We decided to create our own kingdom 
While being surrounded by creatures 
Who pledged their allegiance eternally 

We refused, we rejected 
We decided to have our own empire 
Not based on the Book of Lies 
Forever we refuse the Kingdom of Light 
Eternally... 

Satan's Legions, None Will Ever See Them Fall...
