Hail to the Celtic tribes 
Hail to my Ancestors 
Hail to my Forefathers 
Hail to the Germanic tribes 

No one could conquer 
No one could take our Land 
When fighting us with same means 
No one could see us 

FALL FALL FALL!!! 
FALL FALL FALL!!! 

Hail my Celtic tribes 
Hail to our (Germanic) ancestors 
Way too many tribes 
Tried to conquer us 

Outnumbered Outnumbered 
They did not despond - Molon lave 

There was true glory 
There was true pride 
True pride 

The darkness of the woods 
Inspired our tribesmen 
True cultural background 

I'm not a child of this time 
(Always) longing for those times 
I'm not a child of this time 

My ancestors, Hail to Thee! 
My ancestors: FOREVER!!! 
Their blood in my veins
