Captured in this paradise of light
I can only feel lost
No grief, no pain
How to maintain
This world is no longer mine
A warlord I was, cities we took
A warlord I was, cities we took
Melancholy fills my heart
Why did I lose my youth
Brilliant my battles were
No journey too great
Parades in conquered streets
While our banners were flying high
True glory could be found
Inspired by the root of all evil
Memories of battles
Like gods of war we were
Like gods of war we were
We sat at satan's left hand
Peace came... oppressed instincts
Reign my land
This land is no longer mine
Now our paradise is lost...
