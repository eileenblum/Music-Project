O infernal majesty
Condemn him to the pit
Evermore to suffer in
Perpetual anguish
Bring thy wrath upon him
Send forth thy messengers
To proclaim this dead
Call forth thy legions that they may
Witness what we do in thy name
The pain, the hate, the beauty
True strength, the force of evil
True strength, epebos aiÃ§nia!!!
Send forth thy messengers
To proclaim this death
The falldown of allah
Of christ, of eva
O lord of 'light'
Lucifer!
O lord of 'light'
Satan!!!
Infernal majesty
Infernal majesty - fÃ¼r immer
Eternal, eternal!
