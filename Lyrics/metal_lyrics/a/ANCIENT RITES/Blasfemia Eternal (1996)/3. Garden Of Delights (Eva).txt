Open the portals to darkness
So that the fire of hell
Will previal
Embrace the wicked beauty
Of the darkest instincts
Turn into a tender godess
And the ultimate queen of pain
Follow me on your left hand path
And discover my infernal reign
I will accompany you on
Your abyssic journeys
You will find the pleasure
...Beyond the pain
Be my innocent graceful virgin
Be my lusty gorgeous whore
Never question my power
Do not betray our flame!
Deal with my insanity
Eternal you will reign
Oppressed by all gods of light
Adored by the disciples of night
Female soul and body
Finest piece of art
Cannot be god's creation
Bite the apple once more!
