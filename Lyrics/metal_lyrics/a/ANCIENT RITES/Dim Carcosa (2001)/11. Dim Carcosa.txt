Black stars shine on the ancient fortified town
The sun invisible or since long down?
Over the dismal landscape

Above Carcosa
No sound, only the wind sighed
Behind mysterious moons, strange towers hide
But even more sitant is

Lost Carcosa

Tales that the Hades will sing
Vague stories of a yellow king
Must die untold in

Strange Carcosa

Mysteries hidden by lake Haliâs nebulous depths
A presence of bizarre beauty and dread
Remains unrevealed

In Carcosa

Above the desert high
Twin suns circle the sky
Nevertheless dim still

Is Carcosa

My voice turns weak, lost is my mind
I see, but I am blind
And no sign of life in

Dim Carcosa
