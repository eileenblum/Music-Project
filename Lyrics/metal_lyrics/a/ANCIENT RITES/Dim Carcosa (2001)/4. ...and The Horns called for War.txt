And the horn called for war!

The Franks strike on, their hearts are good and stout
Moors are slain, a thousandfold, in crowds
Left of five score are not two thousand now
No man on earth has more nor better found
In chronicles of Franks is written down
What vassalage he had, our Emperor
(Charlemagne)

And the horns...called for war!

Marvelous in the battle now and grand
The Franks here strike, their good brown spears in hand
Then had you seen sorrowing of clans
So many a slain, shattered and bleeding man!

Biting the earth, or piled here on their backs!
The Saracens cannot withstand the attack!

And the horns.. called for war
And the horns... called for war!!!!!!!!

No house stood there but straight
Its walls must crack
In full mid-day
The darkness was so grand
And no light was in the land

And many said, We in the judgement stand
The end of time is presently at hand
They spoke no truth, they did not understand
ât was the great day of mourning for Roliant

And the horns.. called for war
And the horns... called for war!!!!!!!!

Marvelous in the battle now and grand
The Franks here strike, their good brown spears in hand
Then had you seen sorrowing of clans
So many a slain, shattered and bleeding man!
Biting the earth, or piled here on their backs!
The Saracens cannot withstand the attack!

And the horns.. called for war!!!
