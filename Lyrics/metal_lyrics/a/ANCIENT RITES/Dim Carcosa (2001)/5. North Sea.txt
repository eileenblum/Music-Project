Once there sailed the North Sea
The North Sea wide and cold
A ship heavily loaded
With the world's most precious gold

The enemy ship was floating
To steal our precious gold
Floating on the North Sea
Our North Sea wide and cold
Our youngest comrade, the bravest of us all
Volunteered to sink the boat loaded with gold

He jumped into the North Sea
Our North Sea, wide and cold

Our valiant friend, approached the ship's hold
With his fairest knife he gouged out a hole
Down! Down! And down! Down went the boat!!
Our valiant friend, approached the ship's hold
With his fairest knife he gouged out a hole
Down! Down went the boat!!!

North Sea! Swallowed by the waves
North Sea! They found their seaman's grave!
North Sea! Swallowed by the waves
North Sea! They found their seaman's grave!

But not before a hostile archer
Had aimed at our youngest friend
Who got hit in the chest and also down he went
We pulled him onto deck
And on our deck he died
A seaman's grave became his part
The message (delivered) to his bride

Our youngest comrade
In his young pride
Now he embraced the North Sea
The North Sea as his bride!

North Sea! Our comrade young and brave
North Sea! Down in a seaman's grave
North Sea! Our comrade young and brave
North Sea! Down in his seaman's grave
