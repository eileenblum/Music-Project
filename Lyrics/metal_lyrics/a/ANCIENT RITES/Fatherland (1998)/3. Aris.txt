Hear me, ancient forefather (Ambiorix)
Honoured be Thy deeds
Leading our tribes against the aggressor
Outnumbered, a campaign that could not be won
(But forever Thy blood in my veins)

Gracious Spartan civilisation
Eternally blessed Thy war spirit
Surrounded by thousands of Persians
"Molon lave" a final proud statement
(None of thee survived
but Thy Hellenic glory is everlasting)

Noble was your cause, brave Vercingetorix
Sad the day of your sacrifice
An example to your Celt tribe
Dying in solitude
(But Thy soul) forever in my heart

Remember the moment Jerusalem fell
The shrieks of the conquered, the conqueror's yell
The roofs that we fired, and the plunder we shared
The wealthy we slaughtered, the lovely we spared

Aris! And Aris shone!
Mars! And Mars rose!

Geuzen der Lage Landen
Van Antwerpen, Amsterdam tot Den Briel
Helden der Calvinistische droom
Nachtmerrie der Spaans/Roomse overheerser
Voor eeuwig Uw bloed in onze aderen
Noble was your cause, brave Vercingetorix
Sad the day of your sacrifice

Hear me, ancient forefather Ambiorix
Honoured be Thy deeds
Leading our tribes against the aggressor
Outnumbered, a campaign that could not be won
Forever Thy blood in my veins
Noble was your cause
Sad the day of your sacrifice
An example to our tribe
