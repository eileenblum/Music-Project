The cause of the Templar's order
Was beyond religion
So brilliant their splendour
So wealthy their order

Channeling all esoteric knowledge
Into one universal thought
Innovating rituals behind closed doors
Occult traditions as well hidden secrets
Intelligence the reason of their rise
(Intelligence the reason of their fall)

13th of October

Grandmaster Jacques De Molay
Burned at the stake at "Ile de la CitÃ©"
A curse accompanying his last breath
Within the year his enemies dead!
Cultivating ideals so serene
Created by minds far supreme
