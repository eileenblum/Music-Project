Recruited in Ancient Gallia, sole foreign legion
Their status quite apart, remaining gauls at heart
Legio Quinta Alaudae, named after the solitary Gallic Lark
And their crested Gaulish helmets, their destiny oblivious and dark

Legio Quinta Alaudae named after the solitary Gallic Lark
And their crested Gaulish helmets, their destiny oblivious and dark
OH LEGIO QUINTA ALAUDAE
THOU ANCIENT GALLIC LARKS

ONWARDS INTO LEGEND, THEN PERISHED
INTO OBLIVION THOU MARCHED

Punished for their loyalty by a usurper, Alaudae promptly revolted against Rome
For in their Gallic minds, their oath sacred, regardless the old Emperor's fall
On their shields, a war elephant, a symbol of bravery, the 5th had won
For fighting war elephants, first in line, under a burning, African sun

In the year of 86, the Legion met their Doom
At the battle of Tapae, 5000 went down in gloom

Their standard and all men perished, on the Legion list so did their name
Thus was the end of the larks, now only in Legend they reign

OH LEGIO QUINTA ALAUDAE
THOU ANCIENT GALLIC LARKS

ONWARDS INTO LEGEND, THEN PERISHED
INTO OBLIVION THOU MARCHED
Oh Legio Quinta Gallica, in Colonia, a tombstone remains
