Onward into the Northern waters, onward!
Forward to tame unknown lands, forward!
Alfather Odin be our guide, onward!
Under the Laguz rune, forward!

WE BEHOLD VALHALLA'S GATES

WE BEHOLD VALHALLA'S GATES

Laguz representing, ebb and flow of life
Sign of the water and spiritual strife
The timeless sea, origin and source of life
Yet unpredictable element, of Death and of Thrive

The ocean, the domain of the Midgard Serpent
Giving, but also taking, the life of sailor and merchant
Oh symbol of the subconscious and dream
Of travel in flesh and mind, haven for souls to redeem

Sacred to Njord and the Aegir, deities of the sea
Laguz represents the Well of Wyrd, near the Yggdrasil tree
Laguz stands for mystery, revelation, fertility, growth, the unknown, life energy

Rune of the universal knowledge, collective ancient wisdom
Pre-dating more recent teachings, Islamic or Christian
