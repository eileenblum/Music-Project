Life is not a bed of roses
Wise words, most will admit
Struggles, ordeals in small or heavy doses
Final result:decay in a pit

From the Cradle to the Grave - THE POWER OF THE WILL
From the Cradle to the Grave - WILLPOWER!
From the Cradle to the Grave - MIND UNCONQUERED
From the Cradle to the Grave - SOUL INVICTUS!

How trivial matters indeed can appear
Some cling on to causes, others pray in fear, or think not

From the Cradle to the Grave - THE POWER OF THE WILL
From the Cradle to the Grave - WILLPOWER!
From the Cradle to the Grave - MIND UNCONQUERED
From the Cradle to the Grave - SOUL INVICTUS!
The human intellect, a blessing or a curse

Finding inner strenght, turn pain into gain
Important is one fought, even if in vain

Knowledge, no matter, is relevant to me
Yet no peace of mind offered, no man totally free
Cultivating self-pity is a way I do detest
Face life, face death, is life but a mere test?

How trivial matters indeed can appear
Some cling on to causes, others pray in fear, or think not


From the Cradle to the Grave - THE POWER OF THE WILL
From the Cradle to the Grave - WILLPOWER!
From the Cradle to the Grave - MIND UNCONQUERED
From the Cradle to the Grave - SOUL INVICTUS!

Rest assured, solitary minds find no rest
Alliances few, lone path, but what is best?
The mind blank, the soul of a sheep?
Rather walk the path of the Wolf, Soul will not weep
From the Cradle to the Grave! From the Cradle to the Grave!

Struggles, ordeals in small or heavy doses
Final result:decay in a pit

MIND POWER! MIND POWER!
