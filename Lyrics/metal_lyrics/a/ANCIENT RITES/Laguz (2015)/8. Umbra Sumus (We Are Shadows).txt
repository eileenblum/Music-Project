UMBRA SUMUS - WE AR SHADOWS - UMBRA SUMUS
If you lie in hiding and hardly breathe at all
You will see grey-clad weaver folk, like shadows on the wall
Dim shadows on the moonbeams
Of people of old times
Come trooping from the attics
Salute, talk, advance

If you lie in hiding and hardly breathe at all
One Day you and I appear like Shadows on the Wall
If you lie in hiding and hardly breathe at all
You will see iron clad soldiers, like silhouettes on the wall
Fierce shadows on the moonbeams
Of heroes of old times
Salute! In line! Advance! Salute! In line! Advance!

IF YOU LIE IN HIDING AND HARDLY BREATHE AT ALL
ONE DAY YOU AND I APPEAR LIKE SHADOWS ON THE WALL

If you lie in hiding and hardly breathe at all
One Day you and I appear like Shadows on the Wall
Umbra Sumus - Wae re shadows - Umbra Sumus

If you lie in hiding and hardly breathe at all
You will see elegant lady folk, like flowers on the wall
Dim shadows on the moonbeams
Of wenches of old times
Come trooping from the attics
Embrace, kiss, advance

IF YOU LIE IN HIDING AND HARDLY BREATHE AT ALL
ONE DAY YOU AND I APPEAR LIKE SHADOWS ON THE WALL

Forgotten shadows on the moonbeams, ghosts longing for past times
And you and I come trooping from the attic...Dead, Lost, In Trance
