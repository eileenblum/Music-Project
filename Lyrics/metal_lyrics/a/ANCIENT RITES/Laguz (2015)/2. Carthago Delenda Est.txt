Ancient Phoenician colony, reigning the untamed Sea
Formidable fleet built of the iconic cedar tree
Inventing an early alphabet, contriving transparent glass
Holding the key to purple, rare colour of the Empire Class

TANIT! BA'AL! TANIT! BA'AL!

An empire rising so sudden, startled the ancient world
Dominance at stake, against Carthago legions had to be hurled
For this closed civilisation was looked upon with fear and distrust
Whispers of infant sacrifice filled the ancient world with disgust

Carthago Delenda Est!

The Punic God Baâal-Hamon, the centre of Carthago religion
Demanded human burning flesh, in ancient sources is written
Whether dark reality or rumours, opinions are divided to this day
A clash of titans, the Punic Wars, and Rome made Carthago pay

Hannibal shook the Roman World, victory for Phoenicians within reach
"Carthago Delenda Est", Cato The Elder's famous repeated speech

"Carthage must be destroyed" Cato stated, a prediction harsh and dire
Scipio set the city ablaze, and thus Carthago went down in fire

Ancient Phoenician colony, reigning the untamed Sea
Formidable fleet built of the iconic cedar tree
Inventing an early alphabet, contriving transparent glass
Holding the key to purple, rare colour of the Empire Class

TANIT! BA'AL! TANIT! BA'AL!

Razed to the ground, ruins remained, 50.000 as slaves to be sold
It was the most absolute fall for a civilisation that old
That is the tragic tale of the once mighty empire of trade
Echoes of (Greek) tragedies come to mind, thinking of Carthago's fate
Carthago Delenda Estâ¦
