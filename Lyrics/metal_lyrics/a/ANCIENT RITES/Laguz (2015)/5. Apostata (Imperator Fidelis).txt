"Apostata", One without religion, a name given to Thee
That is how one sees Thee, through the eyes of history
But as a pupil and writer of the ancient Hellenist school
"Fidelis" more appropriate, Thou embraced a more Ancient Rule

People and Senate of Rome
Thou could not rely on Heathen Frankish Legions Allies to count on
history cannot be changed, irony or a trick of fate?
For Reformation Thy Life too short, Thy dream came too late
Philosopher, Man of Letters, Military Commander
Whilst Rome Christianised, Neoplatonic Pagan Defender
Last Heathen Ruler over a changing Empire
Restoring the Old Rome, enlightening the Ancient Pagan Fire

In the haste of pursuing a retreating Sassanid Foe
Taking only Thy sword, Front line, though
Choosing speed over caution, in 363 AD
A spear infliced a mortal wound, causing The End of Thee

AGAINST THE GALILAEANS! KATA GALILEON!
CONTRA GALILEOS! KATA GALILEON!

Against the Galilaeans! Kata Galileon!
Contra Galileos! Kata Galileon!
APOSTATA! APOSTATA!
Libanius the Theosophist wrote, it was Treason causing your fall
A spear hired by the Clergy against whom Thou stood Tall

APOSTATA! APOSTATA!

It was Basil of Caesaria, who ordered The Kill, later made a Saint
Well at least so John Malelas from Antioch always claimed
Restoring Ancient Temples, casting out politicians corrupt
Not even two years Thy Rule, Your Reing ended abrupt

For Life does not treat kind the Idealist Nostalgic Soul
Those chasing Dreams lost, must burn for Once...For All

"Apostata", One without religion, a name given to Thee
That is how one sees Thee, through the eyes of history
