In colourwaves... ...neverending streams.
When the stars sleep... ...they come !
Upheaved... ...above the freezing clouds.
I will welcome them !

Children of the dawn, in circles they advance
Bleeding the blue air, a paradise in bloodstreams...

"and together with their fall, I have collapsed by the snow...
Bathing in a godless grave, praying to the moon below...
It was not the darkness I embraced !!!"

This shattered dawnbreak, swathed in morning dust
...coloured the grey horizon... Like the sun...drowning
in my hands. And I did not desire more !

In the azure... ...neverending screams
When the moon awakes... ...they leave
Upheaved... ...below
I will forget them !
I will forget them !
