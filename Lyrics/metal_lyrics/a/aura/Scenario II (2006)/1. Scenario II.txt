Saw the face of dysphoria
Within a blink of an eye
I swept aside the loss of heart
Tore the unborn soul from its womb

The lens unfocused
The heart-strings out of tune
Crumbling, the walls stained with shame
Revolution breached the peremiter

Unraveled, I reject my inner turmoil
This order (disorder? ) in chaos, which pain contains
Unity in solitude, alone in unison
Deepen the thirst and hunger remains

Never was this body built to last
Taste this defunct love before the hours have passed
The absence of you stales in the air
Let me define it all in despair

To wrong past rights in a single stab
Into the future that has no name
I, the Judas and the apostle
Deceit is my face, betrayal my game
