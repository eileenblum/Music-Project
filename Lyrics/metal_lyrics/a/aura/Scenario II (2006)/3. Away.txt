Preparing for a journey
Behind your own eyes
Without hesitation
Numb from the disguise

She closes her eyes
And a tunnel appears
In front of her - The walls have eyes
The faces move and laugh

For a while she resists
But then is swallowed inside
Floating among beings
Recognizing their eyes

Some frightening, some sweet
She passes basilliques
Ancient deities with monstrous heads
And sweet female gods

Some wave at her
With blessing moves
Others try to hurt
With imminent claws

Yet she sees a point of light
In front of her closed sight
Unveiling to her in the blink of an eye
Growing large and bright

Yet she sees a point of light
In front of her closed sight
Unveiling in the blink of her eyes
This she saw after she tried

She slips unhurt along the slobbering mouth of a hell dog,
Catches a wink of a heavenly nymph as she leaves the hallway

Now she sees a point of light
In front of her closed eyes
Growing larger very fast
Growing large and bright

Now she sees a point of light
In front of her closed eyes
Growing larger very fast
Growing large and bright

She is no longer aware
Of her body and her soul
Above her head she sees
Colored paintings and glows
Beautiful, she whispers
Where are you now
As she hears the voice in the distance
Taking her away!
