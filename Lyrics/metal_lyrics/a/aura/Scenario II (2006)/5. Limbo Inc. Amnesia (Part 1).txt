The hidden is obvious
Disintegrates beneath walls of stone
Cold yet unendingly atrocious
This fire stopped burning long ago

The pain of longing is thousand times more bearable
Than the anguish of release
When the cogs of the godmachine grind no longer
Will it stir the soul in unease?

Shapeshifter, naked eye divinity
Introspective, face-deep misery
Motion stand still in stagnance
For one cannot divide himself into fragments

Desensitized, colonized, intensified, amplified

The hidden is obvious, disintegrates beneath
Walls of stone cold, yet unendingly...
This fire stopped burning long ago
This pain of longing is my only foe
