Arms outstretched
Eyes divert the light
Non-conforming
To the sullen souls in flight

Barricade the windows of your blood-stained eye
In stranger aeons, even death may die

Action provokes reaction, mind dissolving matter
Emotions cause the waters to stir (in violent rupture)
Beneath the surface of the mother ocean
What contradiction the mirrors shan't reciprocate?

Cyclopean, walker of unseen worlds
Cyclopean, do you know why you really are?

What we are yearning for
Is that which was lost before
Wisdom-knowledge-intellect, pride worn by man in disgrace

Fallen from grace,
Mankind- bearer of plagues-
Stricken with wounds the cross proudly borne in disgrace

Thus he spoke of a thousand aeons
"Hearken!" aloud he cried
"In this room no clocks are ticking
To measure is irrelevant"
