The utmost power grows
And emerges from its dream

Awake, oh entity!
Mistress of us all
Pagan goddess
Mother earth
I worship thee

Your final reign
In hallowed fury
I approve
I die with the sinners
In blasphemy

The utmost power grows
Ands emerges from its dream

Awake, oh entity!
Mistress of us all
Pagan goddess
Mother earth
I worship thee

Use all your powers
To slay the masses
Unleash it with earthquakes
And lightning strikes
End the future
We can enter our next
The words are spoken
It will be done

And as the ground trembles
And skies begin to break
I think about her power
And hope I will awake

Thunder and lightning
The sound so loud
Although this tragedy
Our spirits will dwell in shrouds
