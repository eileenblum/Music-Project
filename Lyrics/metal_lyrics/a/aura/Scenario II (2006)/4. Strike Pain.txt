The rise of the wicked, the fire that burns
The water finally moving, a lesson will be learned

For way too long time past by and winds just changed
But now a storm, a hurricane, is finally closing in

Strike!

What was only meant to sleep now slowly awakes
Violating its quiet place, inevitable release

Pain!

Annihilate!
It's your only goal
They brought all this
To themselves

The time is right
To strike when you please
Unleash your fury caged
Bring them to their knees

Your heartbeat grows
Your arms unfold
Adrenaline boosted anger
Ripping chaos
Burning hate
Finally the time has come to fight

Annihilate!
It's your only goal
They brought all this
To themselves

Devastate!
No mercy, no hold
The smell of blood
The pain you invoke

STRIKE PAIN!

The time is right
To strike when you please
Unleash your fury caged
Bring them to their knees

Rapid eye movement
Psycho-controlled brain
Total massive chaos
Striking fucking pain
