Eyes open wide
As the sun sets tonight
Hear them scream
See them fight

Nocturnal - Their shades take form
They come to flesh as they gather to guide their souls

Mincing the meat
Drinking the wine

Nocturnal - Their time to roam
They will never sleep before the last is gone

Nocturnal - The time is right

Light travels fast
And guides them back to rest
The dawn of a new day
Will send them into sleep
