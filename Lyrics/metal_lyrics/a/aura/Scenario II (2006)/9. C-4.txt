Sunset, red clouds, horizon
The smell of death pollutes the air
Breaching, preaching walking
A silent man crawls from his lair

Lights are all fading
Ravens fill the air
Winds start burning
The temperatures rise

Eyes are flashing
As they are fed with hate
They follow the road
To a terrible fate

Blind and numb they hail their leader
One sheep is leading the rest to their doom
Blind and numb they hail their leader
One sheep is leading the rest to their tombs

Bodies are burning
People are crying out loud
Ashes to ashes
As they all fade in shrouds

Brain washed they commit the murders
One sheep is leading the rest to their doom
Brain washed they commit the murders
One sheep is leading the rest to their tombs

Leafs fall, ashes are burning in the sky, whirling down
Blood stains, bodies lie all around this place, birds sing no more

Birds sing no longer
Numb from the blast
In one moment
Future to past

Distant sounds are approaching, coming close, yet all subdued

Birds sing no longer
Numb from the blast
In one moment
Future to past

These aren't the last of the murders
This isn't the end of the grief
