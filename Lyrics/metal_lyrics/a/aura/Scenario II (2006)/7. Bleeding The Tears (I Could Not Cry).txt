Now the sun has melted away
You keep it up

A moment to see things clear
It failed in my mind

I've been waiting for the end
I cannot explain

PAIN!
PAIN!
In my heart...

HURTS!
HURTS!
In my soul...

Feelings on the run
Waiting to die

I want my life back
Can't you leave me dead?

PAIN!
PAIN!
In my heart...

HURTS!
HURTS!
In my soul...

I bleed
I bleed

[Solo]

I bleed
I bleed
I bleed
I bleed the tears
