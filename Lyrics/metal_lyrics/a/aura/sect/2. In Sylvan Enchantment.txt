To reap this bitter harvest
From the wound that never heals
These hollow veins, the toxic nodes of man
Disease twines therein

Left me in sylvan enchantment
Where chlorophyl burned my skin
The blind fool that held so dear the memory
Afraid to let the darkness in

Inferno!
Thus heaven fell tonight
Burning arbors Of Bone and Sinew
Contorting skeletons of peace and virtue
-corruption heralds the new dawn
Yes, arborescent we stand tall under the firmament
And sigh under the cold winds of change

Scorned and strained,
arms outstretched
towards the heavens
Misericorde - uncrown the self- claimed kings

Behold the Architects of aeon-dead worlds,
Blindness leads, when weaving (their) ways divine

Redirect evolutionary paths from Cyclopea to Dystopia

"Leave me in sylvan enchantment
Where chlorophyl disintegrates my skin
Must let go so bitter the memory
and let this darkness in"
