Hey there anonymous, this doesn't concern you. Notice the expiration sly. Resignation imposed as I've been shedding the seconds and applying the formula, you see? Maybe we're all just numbers after all. Logically impaired, conducive to rapid exchange and repeating, repeating, repeating... till you've run out of those to exploit. Markov entrusts the significant while the steps are outlined. Moments like these are best expressed in binary and systems alike are best explained through song. Yet still, rumor has it you will not be missed and the truth is, I'd rather live by Sicilian proverbs than the words of a modern day savior. In the end, you won't mean much to me. Build a perfect life. Now, build a life and set it on fire.
