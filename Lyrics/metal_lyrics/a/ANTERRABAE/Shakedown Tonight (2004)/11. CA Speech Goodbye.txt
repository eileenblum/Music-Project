Night displaying the face of loyalty and my tiresome attractions were like blows to the knee. And it's all the same when there is no chance that you will ever wake up. So correct my passion and erase my speech and never let me feel again. While my newly painted carpet expresses your court-ordered burden. No I can't take back each and every defense and no I don't think I will ever understand Now life is playing me like a game of craps and it tends to roll snake eyes. Your first words stating we'd always be together...
