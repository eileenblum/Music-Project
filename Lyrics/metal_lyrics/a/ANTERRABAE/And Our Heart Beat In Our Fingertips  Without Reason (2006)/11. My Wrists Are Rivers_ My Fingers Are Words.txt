Friday night always seems to continue
in the cave of the minotaur
I see the outside world of the maze my father built
seeking the opportune time to attack
always searching for the meat on people
but all the ever bear are the scraps
it's best to hungry because the suffering and desire will feed you more in the end
my recovery time is quickest when I am hit and the reason is
my only perceivable enemy is also my strongest love
maybe I'm the minotaur pacing in my cage
or on the hunt for the weakened prey
but I won't let it kill me, let it kill me, let it kill me
(and even if someday you gain on my when I am crippled with intangible fear)
my companion will never allow even a single hair on my body to be touched by your breath
my recovery time is quickest when I am hit and the reason is
my only perceivable enemy is also my strongest love
distant and disconnected, I dream in sentence fragments
the constant rain, (I remain, I remain awake) silhouettes across the stage
I remain, I remain awake.
My only perceivable enemy is also my strongest love.
(With you by my side, I am proud to turn my back upon all the others, do you sense it?)
