Oh holy hatchet, this man has an axe to grind and you'll be my first witness to the death of chivalry
making love in the moonlight in a casket of ivory,
where's your standards
I'm the dirty gatsby, not quite the elephant man, the dirty gatsby
with the holy hatchet in hand
oh holy hatchet, you can do it alone or I can do it to you,
yeah I'll do it to you, I'll even do it to myself
Romance in the ivory casket, ever so sweetly and infinitely delicate,
we'll have you coming back for more
business or pleasure in the business of pleasure
waving white flags with a smile so big you'll never leave again
it's like getting fucked without getting kissed
no pills, no rope, no razor, no gun
these are the best kept secrets,
old bulls die alone
nice tusks
