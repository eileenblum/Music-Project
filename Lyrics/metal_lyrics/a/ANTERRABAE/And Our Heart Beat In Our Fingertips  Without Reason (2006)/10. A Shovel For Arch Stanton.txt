I must have left my heart in Buffalo
Beating between the rusty gears of a killing machine
and I'll wear you out for a buck or two
have I made your day? Have I made your day?
Tasteless memories scraped into concrete
ignite this city, a ruin of apathy
one light for every heart, one rat for every scar
heartless souls, where do we go from here
heartless souls, your just another ghost
this time I'm all ears but I'm not listening
Inspiration or adaptation of early 20th century
French Pornography
Plagiarism is planting seeds, this is not another cliche tragedy
when the body abandons me
obscenity exaggerates love at 72 inches of revolution and 1051 a head you better get your shovel
and those who dig
can you dig?
it's nice to know that I've touched the lives of others by wasting their time
my heart's too big for this cty
where everyone's strapped or strapping
what's the word for wishful thinking, there's a word for wishful thinking
I must have left my heart in buffalo and my brains between your legs.
