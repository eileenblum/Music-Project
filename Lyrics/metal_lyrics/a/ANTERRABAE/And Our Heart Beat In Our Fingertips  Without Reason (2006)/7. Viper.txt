A stolen kiss that lead me to the operating table left me lifeless, dear.
Glamorous, my spiders have returned, so let the clustered fragments of our fantasies
make their way to the surface, where they will be gelled together, ever so sweetly
destroying boundaries that we've fabricated
hold me closer before this last goodbye
wrap your lips around it before it's under the faucet
and if you cry as you choke, let the water allude you
into the miracle.
Rest viper, rest my heart, when have you ever been apart from me,
a shallow reputation mistaken for identity, cause there's something about us,
the white mask is in the closet
how I will I recognize you without it?
I'll be waiting with an orchid and psalm,
two orchids and a psalm
three orchids and apsalm
I'm all about shame tonight
Rest viper, rest my heart
After all, you're just a reflection of a reflection, and the water eludes me
