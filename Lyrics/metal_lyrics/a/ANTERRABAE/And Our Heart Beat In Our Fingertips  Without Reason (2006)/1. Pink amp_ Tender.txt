You don't know where I've been so could you bury it?
I am a tattered red carpet lying in the corner of a room in an empty white mansion.
You're a priceless cedar rocking chair teetering over me.
There is a gentle breeze blowing in from an opened window that puts us in perfect harmony.
When you wake up I am not lying next to you but you now sit still somewhere far away
Among the recesses of the soul lie two deep grooves
Pink &amp; tender
Inextricable as disfiguring imperfections
