The excess that burns me, the harmony that runs within me,
and I don't tremble before god, but with love
this is the fine art of dissecting human hearts
In spite of everything, I'll make you watch.
We sleep in the presence of kinves, in a whisper we're two of a kind
Beneath the perfect sky we kill to pass the time
Beneath a perfect sky, two lovers, two knives.
This time cupid's gone for the jugular
a real, literal, motherfucker.
and what will we become, and what have we become?
watch me fuck her, watch me love her
in spite of everything, these are not the sort of things to calm the nerves
still standing in the stairway, staring back after everything
I will love you as if it were always before
On the outside, above all the sweat of death, even shit looks pure to me
She even looks pure.
In the dead of night, we roll swiftly to the right, to the left, like assassins killing with our teeth
Please come back to bed.
