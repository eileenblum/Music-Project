The words across the grave read "god, how you've startled me"
All we can ask for sleep.
I moved across your grave, beneath the sunset
candlelight mistaken for moonlight
the intensity of these sensations means nothing to those around us
What's that noise?
Everyone is dead here.
Absence radiates, what kind of party is this?
Indecisive, these words are indecisive and I forgot the question, and I forgot the question.
No sounds except you, no sound except you.
I am liberated, I am lost. I shiver, with fever I am.
No sound except you, no sound except you.
All we can ask for is sleep.
I moved across your grave beneath the sunlight.
Candlelight mistaken for moonlight.
There's a knock at my door
God how you've startled me.
The name across the grave reads "Pontius Pilate".
(Boys, we're going home and we're bringing the plague back with us.)
Here's to the death of happy endings.
(Thanks for ruining my life)
