Who set the church on fire, a most courageous attempt at the assassination of god
what will you be dreaming when they kill you in your sleep?
There's martyrs in the cemetery. Arcane terrorists are vandalizing your grave
we're not dead yet, you tell them we're not saints
expire in your sleep
we might find it in the streets tonight
subcategorize, subdivide
we might find it in the streets tonight
subdivision
choose your side, we look the other way
destroy the self contained character of your participators
this is just a phase, we're dying through
give us something to touch or kill
expire with dignified composure
that's one good-looking corpse (if they find it)
they'll find you in the streets, when they find you, you tell them this love is biblical,
this light perpetual
Ignite this city, we'll cut every throat, burn every bridge, and let ourselves be free.
