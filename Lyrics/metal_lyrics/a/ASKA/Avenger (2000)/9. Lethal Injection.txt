Taken from the park on the night her mother cried
Masked by the shadows of darkness that belied
Grasped from the clutches of those who did no wrong
Taken by force violence setting the course - she was gone

Blood's on his hands and the public demands
The sentence of death he must face
Clearly a reason to deny it is treason
To spare his life's a disgrace

To the gallows
To the chair
Lethal injection
I simply don't care

Found in a pool of blood a young boy stares
Torn from a world of reason he finds despair
Filled with a void his father cannot drain
Life's so unkind now he's locked in his mind with his pain

His innocence lost to reality's cost
To fight it is pure genocide
With poison and rope now his death is our hope
The solution is nothing to hide

To the gallows
To the chair
Lethal injection
I simply don't care

Filled with a void his father cannot drain
Locked away from the world he feels no pain

Blood's on your hands and the public demands
The sentence of death he must face
Clearly a reason to deny it is treason
To spare his life's a disgrace

To the gallows
To the chair
Lethal injection
I simply don't care
