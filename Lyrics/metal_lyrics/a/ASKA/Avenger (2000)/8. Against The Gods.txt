The Empire is coming take cover if you can
The rays of ice are falling down eradicate our lands
We beg your mercy master to take our sacrifice
Supremacy acknowledged now that humans rule our life

The age of light that changed us laid waste to the land
And in the wake that followed we were slaves to human hands
Rebellious insurrection inspired by our plight
We'll avenge our young and Hivemates and crush their godly blight

Call our warrior-drones to arms
Shelter our elders from harm
Raise the battle flags this night

Against the gods we fight
Against the gods - carry on for sons of Errow
Against the gods - build the wall and they will come
(kill them all the rest will come)
Against the gods - tell your brothers I will follow
Against the gods - suddenly we've all run out of time

Against the gods - we'll take that chance
Against the gods - (this is) our retribution
Against the gods - in the hands of fate

Hail to the oppressed... Errow be your guide
Now raise your fists and cast away your fears of genocide
When the Empire has fallen we will send the humand back
To the distant star from whence they came
And once again we will own this land... our home
