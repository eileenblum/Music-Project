Sufferin' guaranteed
You go and take a chance baby
I know just how it feels - yeah, feels good

You're my leather, girl - crack down the whip
You're my leather, girl

And I talk that way to you about it
You can't help how you feel goin'
I'll knock you on your knees and bleed you
And I will make it clear

You're my leather, girl - crack down the whip
You're my leather, girl

Why? Your flesh wrapped tight around me baby
Why are they always dyin' on me
it's just a little skin - I stick it in
Can't help how you feel

You're my leather, girl - crack down the whip
You're my leather, girl
