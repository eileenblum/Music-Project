They were rulers in name of the greatest empire ever known on earth
Centurions and soldiers, patricians and killers of noble birth
They held sway over lands; the Sahara to northern Britannia
Barbaric Germania and what was then known as Hispania

The Julio-Claudian dynasty, the house of Severus
All heirs to the legacy of Caesar's slaying led by Cassius
XXVIII legions here led by Augustus - Imperator
Yet power of conquest was tempered by rights of the senators

The glory of Rome - Ancestral home
Of those that put Christ in his place
The glory of Rome - Imperial throne
All yield to her holy embrace

The Praetorian Guard keep the Emperor's law within the populace
The senate's aware that their dictators last words were "Et tu Brutus?"
Watch lions of Rome feast on gladiator bones
this here be true sport of Kings!
See the Pontifex Maximus - gain absolution for all of your sins

The glory of Rome - Ancestral home
Of those that put Christ in his place
The glory of Rome - Imperial throne
All yield to her holy embrace

Augustus, Tiberius, Caligula, Nero, and hail Cladius
Avitus, Olybrius, Zeno, and Florian and Julius Caesar!
Imperial Rome
Five Hundred years
