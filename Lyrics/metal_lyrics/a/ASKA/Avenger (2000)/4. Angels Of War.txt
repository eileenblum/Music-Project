You see the chaos in the streets
You feel your world is ending
So much violence has begun
Nowhere to turn your hope is gone

Yes there is something you can do
To pull you through the last days
Oh yes it's true believer
Take up arms and fight
(Arm yourselves and fight)
(Stallions dressed in white)
(You can choose your side)

Angels Of War

You feel the darkness fill your soul
You feel your life is ending

Angels Of War
