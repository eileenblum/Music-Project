I awaken in a strange place to find my wrists are manacled
To a stainless steel dissecting wall
I can't recall the order of events from nights before
Questions filling spaces in my mind
Bloody signs of torture evidenced upon my naked flesh
I become aware of excruciating pain
I feel my face my left eye has been surgically removed
Strange devices grafted to my skin

Escape: Victorious

I try to scream out but I'm much to weak from the pain and agony
The only thoughts that fill my head are will I live or will I die?
Suddenly out of the blue I feel impulses racing through
My neuroimplants to my brain telling me what to do
Microprossesors reroute, decode, the information sent
I disobey then feel the voltage

Escape: Victorious  - you won't keep me alive
My will sets me free
Escape: Victorious - I'll fight and I'll survive

I will live that I might see the ones
Responsible for doing this to me
I'm recalling wife and family
Worlds or suns away you'll see I will

Escape: Victorious  - you won't take me alive
Escape: Victorious - I'll fight you, I'll survive
Escape: Victorious
