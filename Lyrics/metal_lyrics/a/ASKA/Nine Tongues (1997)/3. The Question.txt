Who are you now? Where are you now?
Whatâd you become? What have you done?
Or evolution?
Stories to be told, told from the old
Passed on down through generations
Or evolution?

Soldiers are coming with swords in their hands
To torch down the village and kill every man
Raping the women as fear strikes the land
You will convert and kneel at their command

Romans crucify heretics

Legions of doom with proud standards held high
Some think salvation will fall from the sky
Accept it as truth or denounce it as lie
But youâll bow to Caesar or you too will die

Romans crucify seditionists

[Book of Genesis:]
(2:7) âAnd the lord God formed man of the dust of the ground,
And breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man
Became a living soulâ
(3:19) âIn the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou
Return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for
Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou returnâ
