Down on my knees, how could you do this to me?
This blackened disease you see
My flesh falls away in some putrid decay
Youâre gonna die with me
I burn as I burn, the hatred ignites
Itâs all Iâve got left
This place with the itch, you fucking bitch
You gave it to me

You gimme leprosy
Leprosy

Iâm dying today in an incurable way
Thereâs nothing that you can say
I bleed my infection in your direction
Youâre gonna pave the way
Iâm burninâ, I burn, now itâs your turn to pay the price
Infected with death you shouldâve never undressed
Time to take your last breath

Down on my knees, how could you do this to me?
This blackened disease you see
This place with the itch, you fucking bitch
You gave it to me

Youâre gonna burn
