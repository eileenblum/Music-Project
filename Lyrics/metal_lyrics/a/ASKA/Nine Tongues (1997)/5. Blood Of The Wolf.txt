Sixty eight, the year I was in womb
No one there to catch her when she fell
This, the blackest night, in the pale of the moonlight
Mother didnât live, I fare thee well
And as I took in my first breath
Familiar scent the smell of death
Awareness seemed to come at once
Itâs the call of the wild

Itâs the blood of the wolf

I run through the night, a man-wolf on the loose
I hunt my prey a howl tears through the air
Voices telling me âyou must destroy humanityâ
Have them peer beyond the veil without a care
The full moon shining overhead
My enemies will leave here dead
The rage and anger that I feel
Itâs the call of the wild

Blood of the wolf

Dark thoughts are assailing me
I change into my crinos form it sets me free
The wyrm concerns me theyâre on my mind
I know why I changed what was I lookinâ to find?
Perform the rite then I head for the site
Another black night in the pale of the moonlight
I take the path to the edge of the creek
Iâm a lot closer to the place that I seek
I often cry and sit and wonder why

They killed my mama âcause she was a wolf
She was a wolf, itâs the call of the wild, callinâ me

Sixty eight, the year I was alone
Before the pack, before the litany
Amari howls-from-soul
Black furyâs a-mauling me
I take her in the night I plant the seed
The metis cub my progeny
It will share my destiny
Avenging mother â my lifeâs quest
Itâs the call of the wild
