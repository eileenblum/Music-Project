Itâs close to midnight, youâre all alone
Footsteps behind you, theyâre getting closer
Youâre walking faster, heâs still behind you
Thereâs nowhere to run, what will you do?

Trapped down the alley, his hands reach around
You gasp for precious breath, but thereâs none to be found
Wire wrapped around your throat, blackness closes in
Twisted and broken â your life is done

Die by the hands of the stalker

Do or die wonât you get it out
Donât you know that heâs lurking about
He straps his wire around your throat
You never thought it would happen to you
