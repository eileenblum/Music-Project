[Music and lyrics by George Call]

Killashandra I love you - does it make you feel all right?
Killashandra I need you - to come into my life
Killashandra I want you - swirl through worlds of rain and mist
Killashandra be there - with your love I can't resist

Killashandra I've waited - through the corridors in time
Killashandra a meaning, a light, a sign to find my way to you
I continue my search, I'm so close
I can feel it

Killashandra I love you - does it make you feel all right?
Killashandra I need you - to come into my life
Killashandra I want you - swirl through words of rain and mist
Killashandra be there - with your love I can't resist

Killashandra I'm sorry - I've taken much too long
Killashandra a hero - to save you from your quantum world of pain
We've met in dreams surreal
Where your voice carried on the wind
I continue my search, I'm so close
I can feel it

Killashandra...

My colleagues at the Institute they say you don't exist
But I know that they're simply wrong
I gaze into the winter sky
Where your voice carried on the wind
I continue my search, I'm so close
I can feel it

Killashandra I love you - does it make you feel all right?
Killashandra I need you - to come into my life
Killashandra I want you - swirl through words of rain and mist
Killashandra be there - with your love I can't resist
