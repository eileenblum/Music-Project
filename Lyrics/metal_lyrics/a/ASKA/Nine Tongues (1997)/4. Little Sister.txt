Well the call came down to Dallas
They said âHey! Are you ready to rock?â
Well you know it and weâll show it
Weâre never gonna stop

So we rocked on to Miami
I saw this goddess playinâ out by the sea
She said âBaby, oh baby!
Come and mess around with me!â

I like your little sister better
She likes to do it under there
She likes to drink the margaritas
And sheâs got really kinky hair

She likes to do it, she gets to it
She wants to do it to me
Sheâs rough ânâ ready, rock steady
Sheâll make a man out of me

Well we rolled right on through New York
And they really rocked us down in L.A.
We were movinâ ânâ groovinâ
Partied âtil the light of day

And those Denver babes were out there
But I couldnât shake her out of my mind
I went crazy, so crazy
I had to have her one more time

Reminiscinâ we were kissinâ in the surf late after sunset
On the beach weâre out of reach and we made love
Under the moonlight
No te vayas de la playa quiero verte en tu bikini
Mamasita, mi cholita, ya acabamos vamos a chupaâ
