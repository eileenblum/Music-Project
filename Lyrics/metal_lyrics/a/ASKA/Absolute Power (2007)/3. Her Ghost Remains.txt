There she stood with her eyes in tears,
asked me to stay but I was far too gone
I've tried to understand it
I don't know what came over me that day
I was sure then
Were never going to make it,
I didn't want to hear it
I wasn't going to fake it
The issue was pushed and
I've made up my mind
There's nothing left here to say,
shell never understand

She fell her knees and begged
"Baby, please won't you talk to me?
Just turn, turn around and look at me!"
But I didn't have one thing to say to her
So she cut herself
as I walked away,
never looking back
She was gone
Her love was erased so she made
up her mind to leave her world of pain
I'll never be the same

The result of her autopsy came within four days
And showed without question
she'd been carrying my...
No!

Now every way place that I go,
I see her face that I know
Screaming "Liar!"
Getting higher

She was there,
shadowing me on the air
HER GHOST: REMAINS
The face haunting me holds
a soul to go to the end
The key to my soul and
eternity calls from the grave
