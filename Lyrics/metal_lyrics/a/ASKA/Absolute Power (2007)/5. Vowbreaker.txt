Life is too short,
my deeds are too few
Is this what we've come to,
It's clear that we're through
A gathering of crows,
there's no wedded bliss
The death of all reason has brought us to his

Make no mistake,
I've had enough
So pack your belongings and take all your stuff
I speak with clear tongue you've earned no reprieve
Look into my eyes you will start to believe

So go rouse the world,
sound the alarm
Tell them my arrival may cause them some harm
The gates are lifted,
I set myself free
And what's left of your grace keeps eluding me
I assign you no blame it's no fault but my own
Living with you has been like living alone
I want to be true,
I want to be loved
Not ignored and neglected,
rejected and cast aside
And put away then shuffled off for another day

Remember:
For Richer or Poorer
VOWBREAKER

Surely you know what you mean to me,
You know that I've loved you
And all that you took I gave willingly
but we all let it change

Remember:
In sickness and in health
VOWBREAKER
We agreed that it would be for Better or Worse
VOWBREAKER

Surely you know what you mean to me,
You know that I've loved you
And all that you took I gave willingly
but we all that is over

Stars will fall weeping down from the sky
Mountains uproot themselves from the ground
Birds lose their song,
flowers their scent
Everything wrong and I'm lying here

For Better or Worse,
to Love and Obey
VOWBREAKER
As long as "We both can live better this way!"
That's why they call you the VOWBREAKER
Heartbreaker,
Home wrecker

VOWBREAKER
