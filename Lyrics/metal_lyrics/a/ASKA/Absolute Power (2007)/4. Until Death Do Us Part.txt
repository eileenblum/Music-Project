You were my religion
and I was all your sin,
Thirty silver pieces,
Its where we've always been
You received my blessing,
I'm saddled with your curse
You lead me to the water,
Can you forsake my thirst?

Making vows for nothing,
So much wasted breath
You meant something different
I mean UNTIL DEATH DO US PART

Until death...
