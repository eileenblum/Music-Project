Things are often twisted,
a darker shade of black
Why do lovers vow their faith
then stab you in the back?
There right now they're smiling,
exchanging friendly talk
While in secret he's made plans
to meet around the black

And they will break you down
Humiliate you again

What happens when you find
out what they're done to you?
accusations handed out,
"Look what you made me do!"
So you play the hurt one
just to have her stay
sacrificing pride for something
you've lost anyway

As they lie naked
Lost something sacred

Once again I wish I could be
like the Vikings were before me
giant men of mirth
braving cold and ocean spray
They burned away their past loves
with high flames that licked the heavens
and sailed of the setting sun
bringing death to all in their way

They sailed away on their
Viking LONGSHIPS
Wish I could be on those
Viking LONGSHIPS

You think about that
trust you lost forever
and you consider what
if anything was real
while they wonder if you'll let
if st slide or if you'll settle scores
that help resolve this
mess that you now feel

Once again I wish I could be
like the Vikings were before me
giant men of mirth
braving cold and ocean spray
They burned away their past loves
with high flames that licked the heavens
and sailed of the setting sun
bringing death to all in their way
never to be seen again

They sailed away on their
Viking LONGSHIPS
Wish I could be on those
Viking LONGSHIPS
