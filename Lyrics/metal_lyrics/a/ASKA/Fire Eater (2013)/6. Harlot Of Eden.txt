Day and night I sit by the phone
I wait for your call, hope you're alone
When you thought it was over it'd only just started for me
All these nights wondering why I'm still sleeping alone
He's staying with you, you've got this man in your home
You've torn out my heart and you don't give a damn about it

Was it love you were looking for
Was it something you couldn't ignore
Was it all about the way that I caressed you
I can't take anymore

You threw it away like it meant nothing at all
You threw it away, could you do this to me
Harlot of Eden

I keep holding on, you've nothing to say
A void in my life, my soul slips away
Now my life's at a standstill, violence seemed the only solution
I'm not gonna take all this pain anymore
Senses are clear as I kick in the door
The pain they have caused me is all the reason I need

You threw it away like it was meaningless
You give it away, could you do this to me
Harlot of Eden

Love - was it all about the way that I undressed you
Caressed you, distressed you, I want you, I miss you
Thought I could take it but I was only fooling myself
Thought we could make it, then I found
You didn't give a damn about me at all

You threw it away like it meant nothing at all
You give it away, how could you do this to me
Harlot of Eden
You threw it away, you went and gave it up
Could you do this to me
Harlot of Eden
