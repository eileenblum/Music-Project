I was living in an empty place in my life
You were trying to contain a sadness inside
I could only try to stop myself going mad
While you were living through
The worst that you've ever had to face

Angela I waited for you
Angela I've thought it through
There's nothing I won't do Angela

And then remembered in half faded memory
Embraced in that unholy place
And it all came flooding back to me
I held you, I loved you, our hearts burning with desire
We felt it, confessed it, our bodies embrace the fire

Angela I knew I'd find you
Angela I've thought it through
There's nothing I could do

I turn and face the sky
Where your voice carried on the wind
My search is over Angela

"My one true love, forevermore you've existed
In the deepest recesses of my heart and soul
And in the twilight when the night is coldest
My heart calls out for you...
You found me, you saved me, and now I'm home"

And then remembered in half faded memory
Your face, this unholy place, it all came flooding back to me
The moment I laid my hands on you
I knew nothing could ever change the way I feel about you
And I'm never, never, never gonna let you go
Now that I've found you, can't live without you Angela
