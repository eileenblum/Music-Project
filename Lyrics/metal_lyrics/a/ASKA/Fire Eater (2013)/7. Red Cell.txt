Change - it waits for no one and no one waits for me
Fundamentally free but beginning to see for the first time
I myself a citizen, can tell you clear, I remember when
Everything I believed was thrown into the fire

I could feel their power grow stronger
I could keep this silent no longer

Defiant, I spoke my mind out
And I said all those things that I needed to say
Fundamentally free but that sealed it for me
I myself a denizen, can tell you clear, I remember them
Three and me, abducted then
I sent prayers to god and plead with the uniformed men

They've taken me, they've got me in this red cell
Red cell with blood on the walls
They've taken me, they've got me in this red cell
Red cell, they've got blood on their hands

"My country is sabotaged by fools, liars and whores
Killers who care nothing for this land I love
And seek to imprint their agendas of corruption and
Greed against a complacent populace"

We'll harbor no silence, do what you will
You will never break my spirit, no
Others will seek for me, do what you will
Though my body's broken I won't give

"Change it waits for no one
One bullet from a gun brings change
You think you're free, try being me"

They've taken me, they've got me in this red cell
Red cell with blood on the irons
Red cell - change it waits for no one
Red cell - and no one waits for me
