World violators, earth shakes beneath our feet
Mass desecrators, our journey's now complete
Ground fires burning, no one gets left behind
The tide is turning, exterminate your kind

Advance battalions, armored technology
Galactostallions, radioactivity
Annihilators, masters of time and space
Adjudicators, eradicate your race

War is coming, we tear across the skies
Fires burning, the stars are calling us tonight
Everyone dies

Exterminators, exposing underground
Anticipators, bringing the curtain down
The human race is, victorious this day
All alien traces, destined to fade away

War is coming, we tear across the skies
Bombs are falling, the stars are calling us tonight
War is coming, fighters burning in the night
Our destroyers light the air, on this journey through the stars
We oppress and rule by force, our mission plan is:
Everyone dies

It has forever been man's destiny to go forth and conquer
All that lies before him!
