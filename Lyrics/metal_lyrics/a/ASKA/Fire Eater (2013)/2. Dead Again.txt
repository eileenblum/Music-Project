Wondering what you take me for
Why you don't want me anymore
You broke my heart and walked right out the door
My life's come crashing to the floor

All those things you did to me, you think I'm blind but I can see
No one seemed surprised you disappeared
She's dead again

Once again I'm calling out your name
I'm all messed up here now yet who's to blame
I think I must discuss this with my friends
Sometimes the means don't justify the ends

I got this book that promises an incantation that she says
Is guaranteed to raise her from the grave
She's dead again

Midnight comes I weave my spell, securing me my place in hell
When the sun comes she'll return, when the night falls then she'll burn
No police - no mystery, though I act suspiciously
She roams the day but when the darkness falls
She's dead again
