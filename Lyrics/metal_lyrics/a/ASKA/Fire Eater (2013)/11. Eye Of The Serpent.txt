For centuries we were sleepwalking
Without light - guided by fear
So much sorrow and misery
We were lost - our time had not come

Kings and emperors in the palm of their hand
Without fear - religion in control of all the world
Acting under orders

But more and more of us awakened
Brave! Courageous we stand
To fight for all and fight for freedom
And we look without fear
Into the eye of the serpent

We recognize the game
We will change the rules now
Our numbers increase every day
We'll retake all control
Now we fight with genuine freedom
And we look without fear
Into the eye of the serpent
We're no longer afraid
The veil has been lifted
The charm has been broken

Discovering the world beneath the surface
Enlightened minds crack genetic codes
The moment of truth is finally here
The secrets of the moon
Now lay exposed for us to see
The world is ours again

More and more of us awakened
Brave! Courageous we stand
To fight for all, fight for freedom
And we look, discard the book, take a look
Into the tyrant
Into the eye of the serpent
