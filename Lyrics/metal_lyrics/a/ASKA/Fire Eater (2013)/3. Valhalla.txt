Valhalla awaits me
If I fall here in battle this day
The smoke of my sacrifice rides on the wind

Burning embers in the distance
Closing ranks in the dead of the night
The day of Ragnarok will signal the end of it all

Kill, kill
The Valkyries ride to on Odin's command
Kill, kill
To gather those fallen with weapons in hand

No quarter, grant no mercy,
They petition in vain to their god
We'll take what we want
And make payment in blood

They seek refuge in their holy place,
They pray that somehow their Christ will even the odds against them
Like all the rest, their god lets his worshippers die

Kill, kill
The Valkyries ride out, they take to the sky
Kill, kill
What need of a god lets his followers die

Valhalla

Kill, kill
The Valkyries ride to on Odin's command
Kill, kill
Norsemen will always keep rule of the land

Kill, kill
What good is a god lets his followers die
Kill, kill
Your god of peace requires of you to turn the other cheek
Kill
But you'd be better off battling against us,
Then we can meet again

In Valhalla
