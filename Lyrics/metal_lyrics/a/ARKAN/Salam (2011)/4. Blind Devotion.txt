Scourges as a warning from heaven
Aback by hidden enemy
Has the real reason been hidden?
So many lies got around me
Black skies laughing
Warning from the Almighty's heaven
Aback by a hidden enemy
The real reason hidden

Now that I am sure of my fate
I'll get it straight
Defined and freed from blind belief

[Arabic singing]
