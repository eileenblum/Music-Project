Here you are finally
You're the One I was waiting for
Hear my words carefully
We often face our fate
Through the ways
We've taken to avoid it

From the bottom of my soul
I will be your guiding sign
Through the sorrow and the pain
The brotherhood we've found
Can never ever fade
And will always be the same

I lead you to the other side
The new sun is rising
On Orshalim
Let me see inside your soul
Let me show you the way
Beside my silent friend

[Arabic singing]

Invaded by your pain

[Arabic singing]
