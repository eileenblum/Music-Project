This is the end of the journey amongst us
You've seen the craziest dreams and lived your worst nightmares
Is there anything left you have to sacrifice?
After all that we've been through, is there anything worth leaving?

Welcome to your nightmare
Vision obstructed
Pestilence could become your confidante
Your confidante

Now I see the light
Enlightening my heart
Can you feel the peace once again?
Like a newborn child
Like a new soul coming to this world

I awake in this darkened room once again
And I realize that the call from the city was yours
We shed the same innocent blood through all these years
I hope to see the light once again before we are taken away
