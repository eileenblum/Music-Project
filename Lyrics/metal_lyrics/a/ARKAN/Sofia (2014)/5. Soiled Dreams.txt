Innocent blood spilled on the ground
Do you feel my pain?
Fights broke out in dawn
Arms and hatred left their mark
Men are dead, fallen for their sons
And now they're rueld by the guns
Mortal coils are still here
Only sorrows stand in the air
Victory is a soiled dream
Woven with its lies
Victory is a soiled dream
Where innocent dies
Do you feel my pain?
Can you feel my pain?
