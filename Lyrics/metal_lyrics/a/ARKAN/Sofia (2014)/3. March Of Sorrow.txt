Angels are singing for our lives
Our steps are rumbling through the hall
We are marching for the funeral
We are whispering her name
We are beating our shame
For she, the one who we'll never know
And the bells are ringing
And the bells are shouting
And the bells are crying
Think, You are burning too
And the children are hoping
Think, You'll never be known
And the elders are mourning
Think, You cannot get through
And death keeps marching...
Into a dark cathedral
You're wearing her crown
Into a dark cathedral
