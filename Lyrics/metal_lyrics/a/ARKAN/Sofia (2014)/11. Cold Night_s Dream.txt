I can hear them laugh
Innocent children
Playing safe from wrath
Coldness and winter
Without seeing me
They're shouting in the streets
Destroyed by the war
I walk silently
I contemplate their lives
Destroyed by the war
Their faces are serious
In a room, an infant
Little girl, sleeps quietly
Scar on her head
Blood around her mouth
