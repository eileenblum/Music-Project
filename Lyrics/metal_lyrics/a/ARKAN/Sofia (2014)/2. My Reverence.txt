A thought rises up and goes down again
Wanders through the air and flies with humility
Everlasting dance, hope for their immunity
It's unreachable and it's my reverence
A sound resonates, whispers and leaves away
And it takes the earth and splits up the flames
It runs and catches the heart with ability
It's nowhere and it's my reverence
The world rides upon it
The sun embraces it
The night reverses it
'crosses the lands
'passes through the mountains
'flies with the birds
'dances with the sublime
