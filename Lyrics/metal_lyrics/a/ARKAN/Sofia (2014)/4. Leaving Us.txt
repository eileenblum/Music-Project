Freedom has left our lands
The one we cherished
The one that we really loved
The one we expected so much
The one we hoped for
She came closer
Saw what we were
Contemplating our lives
With the coldness of a blade
Leaving us for ever
The priceless welfare
Of which we know
Realizing we live in pain
