Long night
Bloody night
My vengeance is complete
I'm walking with the shadows
I'm as dark as the darkness
I know where they're hiding
Their weapons in their hands
I am at the threshold
I am trying to breathe
I know I mustn't go in there
I need to be strong
They are out numbered
They are around me
I only have my anger
In my veins like cancer
I can't breathe
Air is leaving me
No heart beats in my chest
I wish to be dead
I have my anger!
