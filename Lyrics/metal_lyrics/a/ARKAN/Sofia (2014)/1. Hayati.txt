She is disappearing and she won't turn back
She was close and seems so far
I reach out my hand and
I try to stand
She disappears and seems so far
Reach out my hand and I try to stand
Hayati
My everything, you'll never end
Hayati
I'll always be with you there
Be sure we think of you all the time
And anywhere
We think of you all the time
And anywhere
