The women heal the old
She's lost a lot of blood
She's not breathing anymore
Their faces are serious
In a room, an infant
Little girl, sleeps quietly
Scar on her head
Blood around her mouth
Coming
Don't let me down
All I've got is one its way
Now I'm coming for their fate
Lost, enchained
Their faces are serious
In a room, an infant
Little girl, sleeps quietly
