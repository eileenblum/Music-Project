Spirits are dark
The silence 'heavy
The moonlight in the sky
Stars are shining
Waiting for her to come
Symbolized by this life
Marching with envy
To our destiny
Blind and almighty
Proudless in our sins
Here no one wins but she who's wearing black
Brought misery and joy never came back
She gathers our souls while we're fighting
We put ourselves in holes whiles she's counting
Death is a dirty mother and she feeds us with our own pain
While we are fighting
Do you feel my pain?
