I will die for You My Lord
Revenge will be all mine
In Your name IÂll punish them
I will... kill... for You... My Lord
Becoming a martyr
A way to purify my soul
Eyes opened on this impure world
I will... kill... for You... My Lord

I am not afraid to die
My sacrifice will serve our cause
In the name of the mighty book
My sacrifice will serve my cause
I am not afraid to die
Through my act you will speak
They must know the path
They will feel the wrath
Evil among evil
Guilty of our pain
They must pay the price
Vision of children in mind
So we were as young and glad
Playing, laughing, innocently
Are they really guilty?
Are they really guilty?

I will die for You My Lord
Revenge will be all mine
In Your name IÂll punish them
I will... kill... for You... My Lord
Becoming a martyr
A way to purify my soul
Eyes opened on this impure world
I will... kill... for You... My Lord

Do I have to kill?
God is that Your will?
My struggle, my cause
I donÂt need their blood !

My suicide is near
I donÂt wanna die
These people are unguilty
I was blinded by pain
But I still carry my belt
I do have to throw it
IÂm afraid of a mistake
I was blinded by pain


I feel sadness
I fell pain 
Lost in madness
I feel pain 

I think of my parents
They wouldnÂt appreciate
I think of friends
They wouldnÂt appreciate
I think of God
He wouldnÂt appreciate
I think of me 
I wouldnÂt appreciate

IÂm afraid, IÂm afraid, IÂm afraid, IÂm afraid, IÂm afraid
IÂm afraid, IÂm afraid, IÂm afraid, IÂm afraid, IÂm afraid

TO DIE!
