Mother, why did you leave?!
Still need you so much
God! Why this curse on me
God! I am burnt to be

Why have you chosen me
Bloody life I hate you

We used to love you
We used to implore you
Lord is that a test?
Have I something to prove
I don't fear death anymore
Now, I am ready to die
I don't fear death anymore
Now, I am ready to die

GOD I got you
GOD I will kill
GOD I got you
GOD I will

No answers to my questions
No more places to search
My friends of misery
Will show me the way
The salvation gate
That will soothe my pain
I can't take anymore
Now it's clear, I'm sure

Mother, be proud of your son
I've done the choice
I know my way
Paradise...
I am opening the gates of heaven
I pass the mighty doors
I am eternal
I am eternal

I've done the choice
I know my way
Now I'll join you
In Paradise
