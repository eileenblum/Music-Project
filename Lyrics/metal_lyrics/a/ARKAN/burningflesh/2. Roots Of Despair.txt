Twisted family fate
Mother's health, fragile
Taken father's life
Fuck you filthy world

Stuck by injustice
Crushed by restless fate
Lord, we need you now
Lord, we hope for a sign

All I can see, misery and pain
All my life, misery and pain
I hear death and sadness
I've learnt death and violence

All I feel, misery and pain
Tortured by misery and pain
Sole thing I know, fear and cries
I've learnt hate and vice

Twisted family fate
Mother's health, fragile
Taken father's life
Fuck you filthy world

Stuck by injustice
Crushed by restless fate
Lord, we need you now
Lord, we hope for a sign

Why always testing
Making us suffering
Hell gates are opening
Towards death, marching
