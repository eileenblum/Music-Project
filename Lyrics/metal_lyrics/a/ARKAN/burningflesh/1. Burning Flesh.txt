Sacrifice in a crowded placeHuman bomb, death embraceExplosion inflicting fear and painOnly remains burning flesh Returning to ashes, dwelling in dustEverything is burning, vision of hellInnocents dismembered and charredAnd everywhere burning flesh Sacrifice in a crowded placeHuman bomb, death embraceExplosion inflicting fear and painOnly remains burning flesh Damage in the name of hateSore heavy misery weightSuch horror, who is to blame?Insanity has overcome Returning to ashes, dwelling in dustEverything is burning, vision of hellInnocents dismembered and charredAnd everywhere burning flesh Sacrifice in a crowded placeHuman bomb, death embraceExplosion inflicting fear and painOnly remains burning flesh Scared women shoutingFrightened people run awayBloody bones are burningOnly remains the smell of burning flesh
