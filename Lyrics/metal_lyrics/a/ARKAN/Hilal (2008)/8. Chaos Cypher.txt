Beyond the suffering
Mother gave birth to hope
From this fearsome chaos
A new era was born

No destinies are determined
Icy waters paralyze
It was time for the currents to meet
The sea propagates some sharp cries

Impossible to find relief
My answer will be terrible
The field of vision obscured
Traitors kneel down admit my absolute power

Disturbed... Annoyed
Aweless
Under the reign of despotism
They delight with depravity
Disturbed... Annoyed
Aweless
Under the smell of oppression
They prepare the final treachery

This is my blood
But this clamor disturbs my serenity
This is my flesh
But this disorder questions my authority
