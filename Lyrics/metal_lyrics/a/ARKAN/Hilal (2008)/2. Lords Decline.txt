Aroused
By the features beauty
The addiction
Under the sign of lechery

Hey, every time you need a sign
Falling deep into the abyss of their hell

Aroused
By Father's blood
It runs in my veins
Symbol of my longevity

Elated
Offered to the ultimate orgasm
Desire supremacy
Impure in thoughts
Excited
By the power to judge
Arbitrary is my law

Ishtar, I invoke your enlightenment
I, glad slave to insane impulse
Filled puppet in the hands of passion
Let me walk in the path of lust

Give me strength not to control my senses
Satisfactory way to realize eternal bliss
Sex energy entirely feels my mind
Show me the way of lords decline
Give me strength not to control my senses
Satisfactory way to realize eternal bliss
Sex energy entirely feels my mind
Show me the way of lords decline
