Anu made his voice heard
I shall not rise to see them
Impossible to go down
Let my messenger come
Ascending the long stairway to heaven
Respectfully stand for greetings
Duty-bound to kneel down
All stand except him

Pretending not to realize
Summoned to be punished
Make amends for your insult
A throne of chair as an offering
Pretending
Not to realize
Summoned
To be punished

She comes to me through falling stars
An endless ray of light
Piercing the skies and diving deep into my heart

Die!
Impotent
Do you feel my disgust?
I state my threat
Tears will flow down your cheeks
Die!
Impotent
Do you feel my hatred?
The dead rise up
They will eat the living

Deprived of light
Where dust is food, clay is bread
Kissing the ground in front of me
I sit down on his throne
He catches a glimpse of my body
And couldn't resist temptation
Cowardly, he leaves me asleep
And return to the Heights Above

He wipes away the goddess' tears
For being such an emotional coward
Remain forever in the Land of No Return
To rule over it with me beside you
