Here the cold winds bring the plague
Slow anguish as a fate
Namtar saving us this painful curse
Surrupu disease is being broken out

When the looks changed by starvation
Our despair bearing bowed
Clogging the river like dragonflies
Our well-set shoulders slouched
Let the heralds proclaim
Let them make some noise in the land
Let's search out the door of Namtar
And stop praying

The story scrolls before my eyes
Salvation
Have I begun to understand

Thunder god holds back the rains
A flood to wipe us out
The darkness gains ground there is no sun
The winds howl
Let the heralds proclaim
Let them make some noise in the land
Let's search out the door of Namtar
And stop praying

The story scrolls before my eyes
Unrelenting
Images of what life could be
And this story reveals me what I am
Deception
Through violence my time I will spend

All was born from bedlam
All will become dust
Such is the will of the gods
All was born from bedlam
All will become dust
Such is the doom of mankind
One World, One Cycle, One Pain
One World, One Cycle, One Slave
All cycles make slaves

Here the cold winds bring the plague
Slow anguish as a fate
Namtar saving us this painful curse
Surrupu disease
Let the heralds proclaim
Let them make some noise in the land
Let's search out the door of Namtar
And stop praying

Story scrolls before my eyes
Unrelenting
Images of what life could be
Story scrolls before my eyes
Unrelenting
Images of what life could be

When the looks changed by starvation
Our despair bearing bowed
Clogging the river like dragonflies
Dragonflies
