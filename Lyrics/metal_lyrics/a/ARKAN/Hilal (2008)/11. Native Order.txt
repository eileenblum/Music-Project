No means of nourishment
We had depleted the storehouse
Enlil decrees infertility
Wombs are too tight
They reached the gate of warriors dwelling
A rabble is running around the door
Do you fear your own sons?
Every single one of us declared war

Embargo of all nature's gifts
Only weeds grew up
Impossible to perform our duties
Nature's bounty disappeared
Embargo of all nature's gifts
Only weeds grew up
Impossible to perform our duties
Nature's bounty disappeared

Betrayal
My trust is fading away
No time for mercy
No healing
Every traitor will perish
In Hell

Serve up a daughter for a meal
Serve up a son for food
Thirsty as were our lips
Discharged only the rime of famine
They reached the gate of warriors dwelling
A rabble is running around the door
Do you fear your own sons?
Every single one of us declared war

More bloodshed, more pain
Brutality of the slave system
Desperate live teetering
We have no alternative
Let us scream as loud as we could
There is no law and no order
The chaos we are living now:
Death and retribution

Crisis aggravated
No limits, no rules
A chronic pain
Rape our mind
Crisis aggravated
No limits, no rules
A beam of searing pain
Growing worse day by day

Putting aside our spades for fire
We mix fight with battle
An uprising in their own house
Every day the Earth thunders
