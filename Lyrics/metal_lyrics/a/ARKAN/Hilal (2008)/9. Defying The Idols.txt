Trapped as a slave race
Kept in ignorance
Manipulated and oppressed
Bondage to the awareness

The "Grower of Truth"
Who brought "the power of the heart"
Witness of hidden truth
The one who gave the knowledge

Opposed to the harshly treatment
Teach the way to spiritual freedom
Spread of redemption
In harmony with all beings

Weapon of betrayal,
Knowledge is a two-edged sword
Tool of spiritual repression
A limited form of thinking

Obsessed by the will to enlighten them
Dissemination of wisdom
Seeking to release
From Custodial thralldom

Defy the idols

Opposed to the harshly treatment
Teach the way to spiritual freedom

Obsessed by the will to enlighten them
Dissemination of wisdom
Seeking to release
From Custodial thralldom
Spirit is the true source of
Awareness intelligence
Stamp cruelty into submission
By creating the brotherhood
