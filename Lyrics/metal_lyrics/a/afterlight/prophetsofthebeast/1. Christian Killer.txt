I have spake unto thee I have bared witness 
To the plague that strives to end your freedom
I am he that once was dead now I liveth forevermore
Behold! I possess the keys unto the world of death
I am alpha and omega the beginning and the end
I am the first and the last and beside me, there is no god.

No god, I am the only one dark lord of the earth
Black; the only light I, Lucifer the morning star bearer of Light
I am he that once was dead now I liveth forevermore
Behold! I possess the keys unto the world of death
I am alpha and omega the beginning and the end
I am the first and the last and beside me, there is no god.

Nations shall rise against nations and kingdoms against kingdoms
There shall be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes.
And Lucifer will come and he shall say
"All power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth."
