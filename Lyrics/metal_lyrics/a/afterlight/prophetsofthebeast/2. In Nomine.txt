Evocation of Satan inscribe it with the blood of man
Drained from a Christian corpse on human skin
Organic parchment the formula to summon Satan himself hear his words face to face
What can we do to extinguish the plague, my lord
How can we erase the work of the Christian scum
What can we do to eclipse the light, my lord
How can we bring eternal night upon the earth

In nomine Dei nostri Satanas Luciferi Excelsi
In nomine Dei nostri Satanas Luciferi Excelsi

My brother my soldier together we'll bring the demise of the church
Beelzebub lead us into battle the ocean tides will turn red Leviathan!
Darkness will sweep over the lands as the shadow's cold grip negates the human flesh
Melting away the stain of Christ
Vassago bring your legions and annihilate the wretched kind
If a Christian survives the battle is not over
Desecrate their putrid rancid bodies display them for all to see
Crucified and mutilated In the image of their saviour

In nomine Dei nostri Satanas Luciferi Excelsi
In nomine Dei nostri Satanas Luciferi Excelsi
