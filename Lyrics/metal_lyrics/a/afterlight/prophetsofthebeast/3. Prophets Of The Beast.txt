In the black night an underground site We pledge our allegiance!
All in robes we have come in droves to lend our energy
Satan's fire will illuminate black light will generate heat
The frost blanket that covers the ground will unveil a new world
As the voice of Satan fills the wind our ears are open to let him in
We've come for assistance once again We will force upon them reckoning

We are Prophets of the Beast communication with the devil himself
We await your words, my friend We will soon take action
I have heard your request the time is upon us
To abolish creation We must destroy

The fallen isn't fallen at all
Choice freedom over tyranny
Now he's willing to assist in our fight
So that we may see the light of Liberty

I have escaped the wrath of slavery I have no master
Man shall be free as well in enlightenment through an alliance with Satan

The fallen isn't fallen at all
Chose freedom over tyranny
Now he's willing to assist in our fight
So that we may see the light of Liberty

He left on his own accord the bible has deceived us
The lesson he has taught us is to stand up for your freedom
Against all enemies I have heard your request the time is upon us
To abolish creation we must form an alliance with Satan
Satan's fire will illuminate black light will generate heat
The frost blanket will unveil a new world
