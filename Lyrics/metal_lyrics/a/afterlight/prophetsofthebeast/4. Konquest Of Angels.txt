Over flames we dance in the absence of pain as certain as the sky above
Our vision can't be blinded our paths won't be deterred
Warriors soldiers of darkness
The scent of sulphur permeates the air the light of Lucifer begins to shine
I form the light and create the darkness make peace and bring devastation
Walk with me and leave the simple behind to rot
Over flames we dance in the absence of pain as certain as the sky above
Our vision can't be blinded and our paths won't be deterred

You will face no restrictions if you choose to walk with me
You will make your own fate if you choose to walk with me
You will be the strong if you choose to walk with me
You'll be your own god if you choose
If you choose to walk the path of Satan you must deny the words of Christ
Expelled from the firmament destined to lie in ruin
Atop the soil of the earth in the land of the human
As the traces of the past secede to the present
We are left to look forward enlightened future

Ask and it shall be given seek and ye shall find
Knock; it will open for you I form the light and create the darkness
Make peace and bring devastation walk with me and leave the simple behind
The righteous shall fall the evil will devour them all
Angels shall perish charred by flames of Satan
Their wings are bent bodies are broken their mission has failed
Struck down by the forces they were sworn to fight lying dead in the black of the night

Over flames we dance in the absence of pain as certain as the sky above
Our vision can't be blinded our paths won't be deterred
Warriors soldiers of darkness the scent of sulphur permeates the air the light of Lucifer begins to shine
The enslavement is over now Liberty begins her reign
The angels have been dealt their final blow
Now the Earth must return to Darkness return to Darkness
The soil is littered with the bodies of the once celestial beings
As the dust and decay sweep over them their memory of existence shall wither
And fade into ashes their carcass and memories
