Nobody trusted me but I am so sure
I saw this light, forever finding me
Nobody believed me but I'll prove it
There is no reason for you to be afraid, everyone will trust what I say

If this is a legend, I will keep it for myself
If I am a legend, I will be saved

This must be hidden
I will find out the answers shimmering
I'll show you all that glitters is gold

This must be hidden
This just cannot be something I created
I'll dig out what's untold

I'll dig it out, I'll find what's hidden within
I'll find it in the reflected rays

I've waited for you
You've called me tonight
I ran without a clue
I followed your bright light

You're the only thing that I knew
You're the only thing that I saw
Don't let me down tonight

What you take from me

I'll dig it out
It's time for me to find it out
I'm ready to find

Nobody has seen it but I know now
This is how, my reflection killed me
Nobody will find out but I tell you
My own grace beneath my hands, stop the pain now I understand

If this is a legend I will keep it for myself
If I am a legend I will be saved
