Talk, talk to those
Those who believe all your white lies
Everything you spread through word you rape
Walk, walk with those
Who follow you in your drone

I can't recall myself the way you lie
Sounding so perfect, pulled apart so easily
Have you ever tried to be you?

They fall on deaf ears
Lost in the sirens voices
Have you ever tried to listen

Noises so clear through all
All these whispers whistling

Brought it upon yourself, the way you act
Some I could accept with half of your smile
Have you ever tried to be real?

No matter what you say
Nothing will make you different
Words count more than I could pretend

What you say doesn't make sense anyway
I'm still a ghost of yesterday
Forgotten words won't reach me

All what you say does not make sense anyway
Words will never reach me
I'm still a ghost
