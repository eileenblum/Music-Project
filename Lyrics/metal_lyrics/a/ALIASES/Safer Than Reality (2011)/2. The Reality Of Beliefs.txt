They're coming close
Feel the heat of torches burning bright
Open your eyes
And see there's no one left to help you get away

Feet stamping all around, I run
There's nowhere to hide ourselves
Walls are collapsing all around
It's on

Please burn me down if you think that you'll be safe
To live another life without forcing yourself
They think we've turned to flames the story

So burn me down to escape, break free from chains
To find another day where you can keep safe this secret

So tear it down
They'll never hear from where you are
Become you own
Faint memory of what you were before we ran

Feet stamping all around and run
There is nowhere to hide ourselves
Feet stamping all around and run
It's on

Please burn me down, let me burn, burn only ashes they'll find now

Please burn me down if you think that you'll be safe
To live another life without forcing yourself
They think we've turned to flames the story

So burn me down to escape, break free from chains
To find another day where you can keep safe this secret

They're coming close
Leave now I'll start the fire, run
Open your eyes
And save yourself from those who thought that you were wrong
