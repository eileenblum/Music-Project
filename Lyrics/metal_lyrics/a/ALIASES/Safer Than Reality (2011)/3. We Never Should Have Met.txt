I am the ocean, I am the sun
Floating endlessly until I hit the ground
I am the ocean, I am the sun
Holding you in my hands

I came from the clouds
We never should have met
Swallow you up drag you down
Hold your breath until you
Drown, within, your, emptiness

Your heights in the depth running our to nowhere
The wind will never take you down

You drain me
Alleviate the paid and you suffocate
When all else is lost I run

Speak to me they speak to you
Everyday there's nothing in their sound
Resonate your own chant for me
I'll play no part until they're gone

I know it's always coming back
But there's no way you'll ever find a way out
I wait until you fall down

I force back down the thoughts inside
When everything moves so quickly from crashing down
I'll let the moment last for now

Burn the surface of the earth
You've got your head in the sand
I am chasing the horizon
Every time  I move it gets away
You'll never find another place to hide out
And renew yourself

You want to see me empty but you won't

Speak to me they speak to you
Everyday there's nothing in their sound
Resonate your own chant for me
I'll play no part until they're gone

I know it's always coming back
But there's no way you'll ever find a way out
I wait until you fall down

Down, you drag me down
You want to drag me down
