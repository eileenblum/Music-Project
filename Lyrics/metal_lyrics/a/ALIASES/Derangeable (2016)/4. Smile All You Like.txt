The weather's changing again
The rain and thunder will blow your mind
Colourful dreams in a colourful life

So smile all you like
So smile all you like
Bring those black clouds
Bring those black clouds

Don't need you to say a word

Paint me a picture that's based on time
I'm watching you, you're always mine
Inside my head
Die into the eyes of my kind
Everything you know is nothing but a lie
So open your eyes
The smiling faces glow
Look left, look right
Nowhere to go
Inside my head
Die into the eyes of my kind

[2x]
Smile all you like
Bringing black clouds

So smile and grit your teeth like yesterday
So smile all you like
Bring those black clouds
Bring those black clouds

The weather's changing again
The rain and thunder will blow your mind
Magical dreams in a magical life

Take every ounce of pain that I've got
Sleep in my skin
I'll know I've wept

Rain and thunder brings you down

Paint me a picture that's based on time
I'm watching you, you're always mine
Inside my head
Die into the eyes of my kind
Everything you know is nothing but a lie
So open your eyes
The smiling faces glow
Look left, look right
Nowhere to go
Die into the eyes of my kind

Now listen
It all turns to black

We're all something but not in your view
We're all nothing according to you

This time look inside
We're different
It's not apocalyptic or is it?
It's not applicable, magical or credible
This notion of life you found so edible
This time it's mine

You want something, so come and get it
Smile all you like for me

The weather's changing again

Give me a reason

Paint me a picture that's based on time
I'm watching you, you're always mine
Inside my head
Die into the eyes of my kind
Everything you know is nothing but a lie
So open your eyes
The smiling faces glow
Look left, look right
Nowhere to go
Die into the eyes of my kind

Now listen
It all turns to black
