We're gonna take you out

Now you break up
Corruption will bring you down
With your eyes you tell the lies
Everyone can see you

Don't look down you might fall
They're going down to damn us all
Don't stare it's not fair
You cannot judge us from up there

I swear the damned are gonna fall
Power to the people
Power to the race
Now I will never be the one
To lose humanity and disgrace

Can you feel the pain rising
Can you fell humanity
We will fight you we will strike you down

We're gonna take you out
And don't you think you've got enough now (You take so much)
You seem to bring that smile with a face of love
They're going to bring us down
Don't you think you've got enough?
I'll say it again I thought you brought too much
With a broken smile and a face for lust

But the day starts flying high
They tread into pretentious lies
Don't look up upstaged
They know just how to find you but they flock

In due time they're all mine
I'll take I'll spread I'll suffocate
When I have you in my grasp I'll take back all you need to take

I swear the damned are gonna fall
Fighting for the people
Fighting for the race
Now I will never be the one
To lose humanity and disgrace

Do you see the one
Do you know what you've done
I can't seem to find a way
I can't seem to find a face
I know that one day you will come for me

Say it again or run

It never goes away
This ain't the time of day
Do you pin and drag us down
Don't, don't

We will shut you down
We will beat you down
Be revealed show the world
We will shut you down
We will beat you down
Be revealed show the world

We're gonna take you out
And don't you think you've got enough now (You take so much)
You seem to bring that smile with a face of love
They're going to bring us down
Don't you think you've got enough?
I'll say it again I thought you brought too much
With a broken smile and a face for lust

We're gonna take you out
