Now feel the weight upon your shoulders
With this hand of mine, with this hand of mine
I'll make you crawl

Just find another way out now
With this hand of mine, with this hand of mine
I'll make you fall down

Crawl on your hands and knees for now

Guess there's no rest for the wicked
They're always running round trying and picking
And I sing to myself
About this moral high ground that we call earth

Seems like everything is upon us
Feel the weight crash down, on your shoulders

The weapons are here

Now feel my fingers upon you shoulders
So with this hand of mine, with this hand of mine
I'll make you run
I'm peeling back your skin as you get older
With the clench of mine, with this clench of mine
I'll make you fall down

Pick up another past time for me

Guess there's no rest for the wicked
They're always running round trying and picking
And I sing to myself
About this moral high ground that we call earth

Seems like everything is upon us now
Falling down
Feel the weight crash down on your shoulders
These bombs are crashing down

Send me the bill
This obsession is killing me
I'm not part of your thrill
This obsession is killing me

Send me the bill I can't afford it but I'll pay
Please I cannot afford this bill today
My pockets are empty so empty
Pockets are empty, pockets are empty

Send me the bill
I'm not part of your thrill
Standing so still
This obsession is killing me

Seems like everything is gone
Not yet!

Seems like everything is upon us now
Falling down
Feel the weight crash down on your shoulders
These bombs are crashing down

So I said listen to me now I gotta save my bones
And with this hand of mine, with this hand of mine
I'll punish you down
I'm alive
Or dead
I'm sure death

There's no more living with a sense of god
There's no more living with a sense of god

Take my hand and I'll show you the way
Take my hand and you'll live another day
