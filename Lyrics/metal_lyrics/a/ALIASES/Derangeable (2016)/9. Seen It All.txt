I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down
I'll follow you as I hold on
I've come so far, I've put down all these awful thoughts
What are you crazy?
Now everything is mine and everybody's blind

Seen it all and done it all
I'm not your witch doctor
Keep them close like fairy dust
But not to adopt her..?

I know now

Sleep tight my angel I know I can't be there
Whenever you need me just call me, shoot a flare

So take your guiding light back home
For everybody to see
Don't leave when you're not right
It's only gonna bite you back, like last time

Leaving you is harder than it seems
Let's go

I've gone so far
Reactions can't be compromised
Even though you're not there
I've still got the continuity

Seen it all and done it all
I'm not your witch doctor
Keep them close like fairy dust
But not to adopt her..?

I know now

Sleep tight my sweetheart not everything is real
Whenever you call me
I'll be crazy fucking seal?!

The little house on the hill stood proud in the midnight sky
With all to see but from no one to run
With all its wonder and glee
1, 2, 3 I followed you down
4, 5, 6 you showed me tricks and then you found

I'd like to tell you silence is born of man
But I'd be wrong again...

Human sanity
Is all that's right?
To come again

Holding my soul I can barely not breathe
I know that I can't be alive
Said I'm holding on, onto my soul

Human sanity
Is all that's right?
To come again

Holding my soul I can barely not breathe
And my life, never loves again

I'll follow you down
I'll follow you down
I'll follow you as I hold on
Said I'm holding on
Onto my soul

Pain is coming down

Destruction's all you know
Striking where you go inside me

Pain is coming down

No
I know now

So take your guiding light back home
For everybody to see
Don't leave when you're not right
It's only gonna bite you back, like last time
