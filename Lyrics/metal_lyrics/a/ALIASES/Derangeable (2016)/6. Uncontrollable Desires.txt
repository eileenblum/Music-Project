That's mine, my own, my space
That's yours, you're getting up into my face
There's no need for anger in a place like this
It's nearly midnight
Drown your liver 'til you can't see
But what I can see, there's hardly any difference in them both
It's what makes us different
Now remember violence isn't always the answer to everything
Yeah yeah, blah blah blah
That's all I can hear

Yeah
Now that I, I feel it coming around
With my silence
Yeah
These uncontrollable desires
The feeling of emotions runs wild

I can't see from here
Just a bottle of juice so wash me down
I'll pay my bar tab in my own time
I'm drunk distorted can't walk
Where are you hiding? Cannot find you now
All these people staring at me
Making me feel like a piece of meat and I'm telling them
It's not a free zoo

Drown your liver 'til you can't see
But what I can see, there's hardly any difference in them both
It's what makes us human

Yeah
Now that I, I feel it coming around
With my silence
Yeah
These uncontrollable desires
The feeling of emotions runs wild with your mind

You've sold your mind
You've sold your mind
You've sold your mind to all mankind
Don't you know you've sold your soul to all of your
Absent mindless

I've sold my, I've sold my mind
Sold, your, mind
I've sold my, I've sold my mind
You've sold your, you've sold your

Paint by numbers, paint by time
The fucking jumbled mumbled mime
Hot or cold I can't decide
Confused and dazzled by all this

Yeah
Now that I, I feel it coming around
With my silence
Yeah
These uncontrollable desires
The feeling of emotions runs wild
Feeling of emotion
Tie me down I'm going wild
There's still time for one more, I'm not done yet

Kept emotions running wild
Running through, running through my mind saying
"What's my name again?"
These drunken voices never lie
There's no way I can feel alone in here
"Get out of my way"
"Now sir how much have you had?"
"I'm not as think as you drunk I am"
"Drunk? I'd say paralytic"
"Para... what? I'm not a paramedic"
This is positively awful"
"Come on son let's have you"
"Get him out"

Throw me up spit me out
Just a bottle of juice so wash me down
Throw me up spit me out

"The suspect is down call for backup"
Throw me up spit me out
"What's the emergency?"
Just a bottle of juice so...
"Control... Where is my backup?"
"Hello?" ... "He's got away...over."
