Just another day in paradise
Everything is immaterial
Inside of me
This is everything I wanted
Didn't know it'd mean this much to me

But I didn't pray for this
I'm not an open-hearted soul
If I don't want it
I'll leave my heart as a whole

Stand up and
The rain falls on your face

Now I've found another part of me
The shaking down under
So let them know
And take control
It's just another day in paradise
Create a product of life and let them know

You're playing tennis with my heart
So take it back to the start
You know I'll never stand for love again
What makes us right from wrong
Defines love inside of us
Another minute now I'm there
Never knew that I'd care
Finding myself in the abyss once more
Another day gone wrong in paradise
So take it back to the start

This place is criminal
It's killing me
It's nothing that I wanted
Everybody is surrounding me
Those beady eyes
Keep staring at my face
If anybody's out there
Please save me, please save

Now stay away
I'm not the absence of your trait
I'm now the process of your trade
Not until you fade away
I've said it once I'll not repeat

You're playing tennis with my heart
So take it back to the start
You know I'll never stand for love again
What makes us right from wrong
Defines love inside of us
Another minute now I'm there
Never knew that I'd care
Another day gone wrong in paradise
Finding myself in the abyss once more

It's surrounding me
It's killing me
They're surrounding me
It's just another day in this paradise
So join me in this picture of fear
Dive in
There's no-one here

Starving you of pointless fear
You're in the know now
Give me everything that you want
It'll be returned
So lock me up with the key
Because now I've grown to know you and me

One too many times through you and I
Everybody knows that we're gonna be together one day
One too many times through you and I
You and me, the countless opportunity.

But now I've found another part of me
The shaking down under
So let them know, and take control
It's just another day in paradise
So scream it out loud and let them know
You're playing tennis with my heart
So take it back to the start
You know I'll never stand for love again
What makes us right from wrong
Defines love inside of us
Another minute now I'm there
Never knew that I'd care
Finding myself in the abyss once more
Another day gone wrong in paradise
So take it back to the start

Just another day in paradise
