Ask the man on the moon as his toes curl

Believe force fed lied about the unknown
Forget all these things that you have ever known
Take strides in this we call the evergreen
Turns out it's like nothing that you've ever seen
Take one more leap into the unknown
Ignore the emperor's cries
Just preach to those who look up to the skies
You know they snatch right up they steal from the poor
Ask the man on the moon as his toes curl

The silence reaches new highs
The secrets give me no ties
In this world I never knew

My secrecy has been lurking up all day
And now it's coming up
To lay for another day

Wake up don't scream this is only a silly dream
These things only happen when you're in between
And if you find yourself asleep with the rest of the sheep then
Ask the man on the moon? No!
Wakey wakey
Rise and shine

Just preach to those who look up to the skies
You know they snatch right up they steal from the poor
Ask the man on the moon as his toes curl

The silence reaches new highs
The secrets give me no ties
In this world I never knew

My secrecy has been lurking up all day
And now it's coming up
To lay for another day

Son I can see it in your eyes
Can you tell me it's no surprise now
Why do you have to run
Drive me insane and take it from me
All this secrecy I never knew
Never knew I swore to secrecy
I just wanna get out of this town, it's driving me insane
I just wanna get out of this town, it's driving me crazy with guilt
You better make some changes to this place
Because it's driving me insane

My secrecy has been driving me insane
And now it's coming up today

My secrecy has been lurking up all day
And now it's coming up
To lay for another day

The hidden cracks in our foundations are the relics time forgot
In and out of translation (translation)
But I can't seem to find a reason why these hidden structures
Are nothing but illegal highs

And eyes open wide
I can't stride too wide above the sky
Don't step on your toes
Because they will never know

And eyes open wide
I can't stride too wide above the sky
Don't step on your toes
Because they will never know

And eyes open wide
I can't stride too wide above the sky
Don't step on your toes
Because they will never know
