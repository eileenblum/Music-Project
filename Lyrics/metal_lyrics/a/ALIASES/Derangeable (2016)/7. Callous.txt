Who is civilised? No sparkle with their
Eyes that are so contrived

Why you gotta be so callous?
It just badgers me
Have you ever taken your own face seriously?
How could you...
Don't you know you pull straws from me
Help me through it, I can't breathe

In my shell I break
I collapse in my shell
I need to breathe

Don't you know the sun's glow
Wasted on a hollow shell
That once was
So free and
Sick
In my head
I don't know

Who is civilised?

Why you gotta be so pathetic
There's only one of me
When I'm done we'll get rid of this hypocrisy
So beautiful
All hail the beauty queen
Try and see what can't be unseen

Don't you know the sun's glow
Wasted on a hollow shell
That once was
So free and
Sick
In my head
I can't faint

I'm tired of this shit I can't do this any more
Every fucking day, all I ever do is play this game with you

Where do we go from here?
You've flown so far
Lost in uncertainty
I don't need you now

I can hide in my shell
I can hide in my shell
Don't come in my shell
Don't come in my shell
I don't... come...
Collapsing my shell I need to breathe

Do you think that I could not be rational in this state?
Confessions of my fate still hang
Until the time that you and I made out
Now don't you cry
I'm still right here where you lay
Confessions of my fate

Collapsing my shell I need to breathe
Don't
You
Know
How I
Feel
Bring me up for hair
It's so dark down here
So
Real
I can't breathe
How can people stare at that with a face like you?
I can't breathe
Don't
You
You know
I'm finished
I'm done here
I'm done
Don't you know?
