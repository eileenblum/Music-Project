I'm running down the road
It's quite a gentle stroll
Sorry son but not round here on deep sea avenue

Now there's people shunting by with their silk embedded ties
Nothing sparks inspires
Or flourishes within their cosmic mode
Their cosmic mode

Tell me everything you know
Give me all the facts that glow
Did you know money's packed with glitter

Nothing sparks inspires
Or flourishes within their
Their cosmic mode

I can barely hear the whispers
Under waters of extinction
And I think I'm going mad
Ear drums oh my god

I'm falling, I'm trying
And I'm drowning in myself
My distorted line of vision
You catch me, thought I knew you
Gotta hand it to you now
You discovered my ambition

Blindness left behind the kind, the gentle loving man
For these closed doors won't fix you now

Waters of your clan erased the boundaries of your fears now
That includes why when and how

Now take some quick advice or your head be in a vice
Talk to me, talk to me yeah
Before you're lost in your cosmic mode
Your cosmic mode

Now I'm walking down the road
It's quite a gentle stroll (on a sunny morning)

Nothing sparks inspires
Or flourishes within their cosmic mode
Their cosmic mode

I can barely hear the whispers
Under waters of extinction
And I think I'm going mad

I'm out of time
Too high to climb
Now on this day in deep sea avenue
Blindless left behind the kind, the gentle loving man
For those closed doors, won't fix you now

I'm falling, I'm trying
And I'm drowning in myself
My distorted line of vision
You catch me, thought I knew you
Gotta hand it to you now
You discovered my ambition

These closed doors
Open up new lives
These open wars
Need to be closed, upfront to the floor

Ideological mayhem does not give explanation
Upon gravitation, in which we take them

What the fuck are you talking about?

Say what?

Talk to me talk to me yeah
Don't lose yourself in your cosmic mode
Talk to me talk to me yeah, take some quick advice
Don't lose yourself in your cosmic mode
Talk to me talk to me yeah, take some quick advice
Don't lose yourself in your cosmic mode
