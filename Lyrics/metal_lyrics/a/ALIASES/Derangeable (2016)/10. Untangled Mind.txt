Underestimate and masticate
You've seen it right? You know you want it
It's changeable, derangeable
The untangled mind of a lunatic

You're just my type
And people with problems make the perfect kind of friends
Issues what issues? I said I'm telling you now
I don't need a bigger pair of shoes

We're all going to the same place and we're going
Just one of these ways
By car
By train
By plane
I don't care as long as you beat me there

Everything's alright, everything's alright
Everything's not alright...
What they say I don't care what they say it isn't true

I believe a million people up here not you
They say I'm fine but you're not qualified to look at my mind

Underestimate and masticate
You've seen it right? You know you want it
It's changeable, derangeable
The untangled mind of a lunatic
You're just my type
And people with problems make the perfect kind of friends
Issues what issues? I said I'm telling you now
I don't need a bigger pair of shoes

There's no stopping insanity overcoming
It's only human don't you know, well you know
You're no more than an entity telling me
How I should be, moulding me to fit in your world

What they say I don't care what they say it isn't true
I believe a million people up here not you
They say I'm fine but you're not qualified to look at my mind

Everything's alright, everything's alright
Everything's not alright...

Lock him up they said
Throw the key they said
Don't let him out they said
Well I'll tell you what I fucking said

I live in a place where unicorns fly
Where the rivers are milkshakes where the turtles dive
happy gas air that leaves you so high
Upon marshmallow clouds that fill the sky
Tell me what's so good about your life?
Tell me what makes you happy?
Just look outside, look outside

They pin me down
They pin me down

Falling to a place that I don't know
Can you hear me now?
No feelings are eternal nothing inside
Do you, do you know what it's like
To lose control

Now I've been back down the other side again
I've been waiting for a god
The only god that I believe in

Now please sedate me I know that I've done wrong in my, my life
Do you know what it's like to lose control?
Now please sedate me

I'll start by turning my back
Into the world of delusion
My loss, my love, my strife
Into this life
Gotta turn my back
I'll never live this madness
Never again
