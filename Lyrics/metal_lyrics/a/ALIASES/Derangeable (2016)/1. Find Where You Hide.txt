Tell me how you can burn it to the ground
How you could deal with my suffering

Tell me how you could burn it to the ground
Take you off your feet use your responsibility
How you could burn it to the ground
How you could deal with my suffering

This is my call coming, from my white abode
I know you see right through me
You'll point and laugh I'll only win
All this time I couldn't see your bloody face disgracing me

There's something waiting
Cold-hearted liars impaling my heart it grows numb

I'm not just gonna sit here
I'm gonna waste my time and watch you suffer
I'm gonna tear you apart
I'm sick and tired of sitting in the back lines
Everything that I possess has been taken from the bloodline
You'll never find what you're looking for

So now that you've taken my misery
Do you think you can take my heart
On a pedestal and run
You could run a thousand miles and I'll find where you hide
This is the last time that anyone
Will know your identity
It's useless shouting out loud
Now that I know your name I'm gonna find where you are

And you're disgracing me
Don't know what you're getting into

This is my call coming
I'll beat you down in cold blood
I know you see right through me
Sorry my friend you'll never win
Hang my painting on the wall it's standing there just inches tall
It's so disgraceful scratching the surface with
All these mad things I have done

Tell me how you can burn it to the ground
Tearing off your teeth with something scandalous
How you can Burn it to the ground
How you can deal with my suffering

And there's no light in my world

So what? Don't rain it up upon my head
Could you be a clown, not personified anymore?
All my scars they have a meaning in my life

Take off, I know I'll mean it when I'm dead
What's fucking funny now?
Happy now that I've got so far?
All my scars have a meaning in my life
You don't know what you're getting into

So now that you've taken my misery
Do you think you can take my heart
On a pedestal and run
You could run a thousand miles and I'll find where you hide
This is the last time that anyone
Will know your identity
It's useless shouting out loud
Now that I know your name I'm gonna find where you are

I'm not just gonna sit here
I'm gonna waste my time on you
And now you know that you've taken my misery
You can run a thousand miles but I will find where you hide
I will find where you hide
