Down the pitch black hole
Along with my frozen soul
By pain swallowed whole
Emotional holocaust
The past is an ocean without shores
And we are forever lost in the storm
Slowly going down...

The shadows follow me down
Lead my way
Through this hell of my own

Been here before
In the pit of broken thoughts
Emotional holocaust
The past is an ocean without shores
And we are forever lost in the storm
Slowly going down...
