Everything laid to waste
All those broken dreams
In front of me you fell from grace
Never to rise again
In your own ashes you crawled away
I shall never speak your name again

Bitter the surface
Just like beneath...

Everything laid to waste
All those broken dreams
In front of me you fell from grace
Never to rise again

Bitter the surface
Just like beneath...

In Reality Suffer
In vain wither and die
