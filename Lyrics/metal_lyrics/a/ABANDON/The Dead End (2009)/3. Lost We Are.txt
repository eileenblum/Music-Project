Lost we are...
This is the madness
Soon to swallow all
Lost we are, Lost...

Nothing for no one
For crumbs we crawl
Bleed to stay awake
And smile to hide the pain
Above, The vultures await

We are the madness
Soon to swallow all
Lost we are, Lost we are
Grey, Decay, Growing Weak

The vultures shall not await in vain...
