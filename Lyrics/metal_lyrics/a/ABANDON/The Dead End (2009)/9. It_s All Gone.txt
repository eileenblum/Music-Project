For one second
I saw hope in your eyes, eyes
Took one second to focus
Then you realized
It's all gone
It's all gone

And now you are drowning
Contagious despair, despair
The filth and the madness, madness
Spreads everywhere

The dying sun of liberty
And the daughters of hope
Drown in grief

Hang high the liars
Hang high the thieves
This epoch of denial
Must cease to be

Elegant machinery
Auto self destruct
We are not the victims
We are the prey
