In need of something
I find it hard to breathe
Please give me something
Find it impossible to sleep
What do they want from me?
Don't want their reality
I'm scared you see
Scared of their fuckin
Entity
Anyway, not meant for me..
Don't want their world..
Deeper I sink into their reality
I will deny...
