[Music &amp; Lyrics by S. Guadagnoli]

Just let me say what is goin' on
Here is something wrong
by me you just wanna take
That's not workin' out 
Break - I'm the logic answer
In - to your need of special
Break - we come from down
here's not Hollywood
Just gonna break in 
One, two, step. Just let me say what is broke in me
You talk of freedom's bills
Lies on lies just sharing to the world
Nothing more than vain for free
Break - I'm the logic answer
In - to your need of extras
Break - we comes from hell
here's not Hollywood 
[Chorus:]
Feel sick of everything they said of me
As they will call my name it never be the same
Just gonna break in over your world
Just gonna break in over your world
Just gonna break 
Boys we're gonna break
Girls we're gonna break 
Boys we're gonna break, 
Girls we're gonna...
