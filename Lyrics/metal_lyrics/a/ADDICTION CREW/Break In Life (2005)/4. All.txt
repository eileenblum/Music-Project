[Music &amp; Lyrics by S. Guadagnoli]

All we need to feel it's
Just like the others
So, I'm over you, I don't feel you, I can't see you 
When I was down the way
I'm callin' you, I don't feel you, I can't see you
When I was looking for
Something inside gonna makes me strong never change my way
See, what goes around
All we need to feel it's
Just like the othersJust feel free
Something inside taking over my hard times, when I step outside 
Now, what comes around
