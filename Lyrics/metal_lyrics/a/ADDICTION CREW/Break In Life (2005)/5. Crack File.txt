[Music &amp; Lyrics by S. Guadagnoli]

Think you're about to forget what you do remember now
Pray just another style to express
Reach out for a brand new connection to crack da file you miss 
Please don't tell me, don't wanna listen to
Your problem's not so big
but you know what
a real problem is?
but you know
You keep on fillin' my head with yr of bullshit, get da fuck out my way 
Pray just another style to regret
Shut up, like I don't know like I don't know, you feel so fuckin' bored
Please don't tell me, don't wanna listen to
Your problem's not so big
but you know what
a real problem is?
but you know 
turn around your head and realize 
[Chorus]
Are U feeling so much better than I know
What I used to know in my whole damn life just a fair affair
Get down for me
Breathing out, cannot blow your shell away
What I used to need all I used to need a Crack File for yr life 
Think you're about to re-load now, U've just got one more chance
Pray just another style to express
Reach out for a brand new connection to crack da file you miss 
Please don't tell me, don't wanna listen to
Your problem's not so big
but you know what
a real problem is?
but you know
turn around your head and realize 
[Chorus]
Take me out side
Take me inside....Break!
[Chorus]
