[M &amp; L by S. Guadagnoli]

Yes I wanna let it go...
Side 2 side, bottom 2 da top, from east 2 da west in A we trust
and its all about what what we're doing fine, we're gonna burn the roof
Side 2 side, bottom 2 da top, from east 2 da west in A we trust
c'mon and get aboard Addiction sounds like this yo
Stand outside the wave waiting for they're comin' on to detect this beating inside
cut you in and pull outside
Burn some more in you what we do is an overflow of the rage you're pushing this way
So are U gonna move 
[Bridge:]
make it, and don't forget,
funky, you're what you are
In Addiction we trust 
so make your move we're comin' to getcha
[Chorus:]
Side 2 side, bottom 2 da top,
from east 2 da west in A we trust
go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Won't you rock with me 1 time from the city light 'till morning comes just call on me 
when you'll get there I'll see your face 
Burn some more in you what we do is an overflow of the rage you're pushing this way
So are U gonna move 
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
once far someone said "I got the power to move 'ya" 
Yes I wanna let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Side, Top, East, West.
and I say, well I used to say "I got the power to groove'ya"
Yes I wanna let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
Side, Top, East, West, just let me hear!
[Chorus]
