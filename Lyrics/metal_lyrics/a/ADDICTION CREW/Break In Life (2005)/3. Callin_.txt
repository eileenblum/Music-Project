[Music &amp; Lyrics by S. Guadagnoli]

See it's coming, it's callin' 
D'ya wonder planet's callin' revenge
Look up overthere what a grey sky 
Comin'atcha does'nt really mater who U R
No fame, money, trust 
chorus
I hear you callin' as the drum beat goes 
WHO's 
WHO's 
Gonna lead your moves 
When its callin' you just gotta move on
Gettin' out of yr car to see it goin' so far 
Everybody's tuning with the frequency 
Bring the bass on the top of the car 
Get up! Get on it... there's million people down the streets
We're gonna raise this vibe up to the sky and he'll bring it back vibration's cut
See it's coming, it's callin' .............Down!
we were coming back from nowhere, failed decoding message from above
It seems we're goin' to light a new starChorus
When its callin' U're may ready or not
Taking all U can to the bag
But theres nothing you are leaving here
That you will not find in the nu place
No fear to the final edge ...B what U wanna B do what U wanna do
It's now or never take a chance to find your way
See it's coming, it's callin' ...down!
we were coming back from nowhere, failed decoding message from above
It seems we're goin' to light a new star
