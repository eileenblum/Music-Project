[Music &amp; Lyrics by S. Guadagnoli]

Double 3.5.....6.3.2.
And as U called me up to my mobile it's about 4 am and I had to wake up
Hey... so sorry it's me, just need to talk
I can't believe the words U're tellin' me, such a story heard from the bottom of a magazine
I went too late to her place, damn! She was just done 
[Chorus:]
It's always hurtin' someone like you
That you're closin' into a blindside get cold
Everytime you're fallin' into your wrong
I suggest my self it last 
I wasn't able to cut far away the pain stuck so deep in your eyes everytime you did lie 
She promised all and nothing, until next time
But realize you can't deny it isn't fine even after cuttin' off your mind &amp; soul 
I keep your head in my hand when you close your eyes
[Chorus]
I just don't understand why
Your body down 2 1 
It's always hurtin' someone like you
That you're closin' into a blindside get cold
All the things I used to say to remind U what a special being U R they wont work
Right 
[Chorus]
Fall out 
I pray it's getting over
Fall out 
I'm praying make it over 
I'm praying don't go
