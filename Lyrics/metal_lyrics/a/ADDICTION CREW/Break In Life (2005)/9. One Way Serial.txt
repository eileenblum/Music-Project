[M &amp; L by S. Guadagnoli]

Break down the way
One - Connect the laptop to the net
Two - I'm gonna show you how to flow
Break free don't wanna be just don't wanna be
Search - need a number to your .exe
Crack - damn free to fuck all charge
Break free don't wanna be just don't wanna fall
Down, all so down, make me feel right now
Just One Way 
[Chorus:]
That you need it for another day of life won 
I wish to be the one
Just one way
So you're fading even when right
I wish to let me fall
nothing's better
This is my way
One - Contact the liar mailing list
Two - Gonna spread the serial code
Break free don't wanna be just don't wanna be
Search - Warning the line cut over phone
Crack - Spyware contaminates 
Break free don't wanna be just don't wanna fall
Down, all so down, make me feel right now
[Chorus]
I don't give a shit what you think
I'm just a motherf****r straight in your face so
Don't waste your time
Shut your mouth and get away from me 
[Chorus]
that you need it, for another
Yes you need it, life now.
