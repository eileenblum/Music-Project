[Music &amp; Lyrics by S. Guadagnoli]

I'm fallin' down down too fast
And my face stuck on the ground
so, do you remember da words
you said to me 
'coz I hate you
once in my mind
but I need you
twice in my life
ever after you've dismissed my self behind you
just tell me why
[Chorus:]
'coz I'm hateful to everyone who lies 
isn't it about trust
that I'm thankful for every step I take to a brand new day
what about you, what about us
do you still care for
what about you, what about us
do you still reach for
I'm goin' down by memories
But the light still blind my eyes
So, all said and done
I still won't feel so cold
'coz I hate U
once in my mind
but I need you
twice in my life
ever after you've dismissed my self behind you
just tell me why
[Chorus]
Everything that I need is so far gone
As you're leading my arms to hold a stone
I'm giving up, put it down your embrace
Do you remember the words you said to me
I'm gonna improve my body, body mind &amp; soul
I'm gonna move my body, body mind &amp; soul
Open up the cage and I'll let you go
Do you remember the words you said to me
[Chorus]
