[Music &amp; Lyrics by S. Guadagnoli]

Wake me
'coz I'm in the place to be
Call me
just takin' a breath of you
Once more
Than I do realize you're gonna disappear as the daylight 
Voice wave
your body can't get to me
Lay down
what you can read about
So far
and close at the same time as we disconnect just to figure it out the two of us 
sun, rain, comin' again
so just layback layback I'm callin' you
Once more
Than I do realize you're gonna disappear as the daylight 

It doesn't come easy when I'm talkin' on the phone to you 
As you share the best of you share the rest of you it takes me down
It takes me down
Take me Down, take me deep down
'coz it doesn't make me feel good
You're my sun &amp; my rain but the rain flow away
So what you trying so hard, so where you going so fast
Can't you forgive for the past may I'm blowing you? No way 
I'm talkin' about your critical point of no return

Flow my fingers on da keyboard still
Flow the screen to my open wide eyes 
Eyes my fingers on da keyboard still
Flow the screen to my open wide
