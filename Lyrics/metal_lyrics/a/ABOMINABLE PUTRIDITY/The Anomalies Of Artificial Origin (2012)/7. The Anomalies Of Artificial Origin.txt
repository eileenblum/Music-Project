The Anomalies of Artificial Origin...[x2]

Taken from the mud and clay
DNA strands mutate and form
The sky not yet coming into being
As the gods had not yet been born
From the mounds of fertile black soil
Rise above the chaotic waters
The children of atum coming the be

The children of atum...[x2]

Down from the sky thry descend
Upon the rock - raise your bleeding arms
The symbol of ka your essence
Will be them
The Anomilies of Artificial Origin

Created as a slave race to mine gold
The keepers of the sky begin the cycle again
A new world of sustanance were eternal
Path on the great throne - enslaved

Opening the mouth of ceremony
Release the souls of corpses by priests
Performing at this funeral of creation
Sitting upon the mud and clay...[x2]

God of regeneration
Tombs of the craftsmen...[x4]

The funeral cults rise to dominate
After the collapse of the old kingdom
Period of the weak eleventh dynasty
Reigning over the region of mud and clay
