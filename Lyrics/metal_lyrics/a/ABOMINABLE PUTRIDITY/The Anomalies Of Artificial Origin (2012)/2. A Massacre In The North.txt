Bound next to each other
On the floor
Wire and tape tied
Stripped of flesh
Are wrists and ankles

Claw-hammered strangled and cut to death
Stab marks on the walls
Red stained the floors
Spray patterns throughout the ceiling 
A butcher knife and a hammer
Covered in blood lying on a table
Used with no precision
Claw-hammered strangled and cut to death...

The strangers come from the woods
Silently 
In a frenzy of violence...

A young one taken 
Not to be found
A memento of flesh
A memento of blood

Mortals are taking these souls
Misery holds the darkness
Solitude among the trees
Only the cabin remains
To speak in silence
A memento of flesh
A memento of blood...

Claw-hammered strangled and cut to death
Claw-hammered strangled and cut to death...
