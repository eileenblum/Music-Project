Intra-universe as the time escapes a bridge we walk back and fourth
Hyper surface of a constants time embedding our travels connecting through light
Cosmic string of mass destruction converted into time-expands
Though we seek general relativity - accelerating to a pattern in time
A twin paradox makes a journey - and return only to be younger
The ring has collapsed as we become joined again
A twin paradox makes a journey - and return only to be younger
The rim has collapsed as we become joined again
Faster than light we roam through the tunnel of conjuration
Faster than light we roam through the tunnel of conjuration
The ring has collapsed as we become joined again
The ring has collapsed as we become one again
The ring has collapsed as we become joined again
The ring has collapsed as we become one again
Faster than light conjuration
We roam through the tunnel seeking an eternal life
Faster than light conjuration
I can only see myself connecting
This machine holds my mind hostage
Trying to escape free from the grid
Faster than light conjuration
I can only see myself connecting
This machine holds me hostage
Trying to escape free from the grid
