Hymns of the season feast on weakened minds
Attending the divine liturgy recounting the word
The invisible reveals the word of truth
Kneel before the pagan symbol - repent...[x2]

The last communion
The last communion

Fashoined from clay - ashers of men
Serve the sun - fot it dies at night
And brings new life - come out of the netherworld
Navigate the abyss untill the hour od re
All cattle all worms he has created
The mud of the nile - fermented and decayed
Without seeds - watch as the sun shall rise

Gilgamesh the oracle...[x4]

A stone in the desert of set
The tablets of enuma elish
Long before the word was truth
The bread of life - the truth and the light
Hor-us

The last communion...[x4]

Pharoh of hor-us in life
Pharoh of hor-us in death
Pharoh of the sun of ra
Walking through the fifth dynasty
The elder of paganism
The identicle mythological origins
Stealing images from the pagan world
Speading a disease of resurrection...

Hor-us...[x2]
