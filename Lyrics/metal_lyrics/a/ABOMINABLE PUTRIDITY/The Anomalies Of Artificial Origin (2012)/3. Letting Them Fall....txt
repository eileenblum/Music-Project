Cobble stoned streets
Filling with red
The rise in pornography
Fueled his thoughts 
Of darkness and pleasure
Panic and fear fill
The autumn air
As precise calculation
Begins...

Giving berth to the 20th 
Century. Disemboweling 
The weak, catch me if you can
Prey for me father...

Method of operation
Modus operandi
Was not determined 
Letting them fall

Throats were cut 
Victims arranged awkwardly 
Straddling over the body
Splatter stains show, fatal wound imminent...

Taking pieces of there kind
Anatomical knowledge 
Known as I, remove the kidney
Bound are the abdomen and feet
Often near the darkness 
Experience with the knife
Shows through the victims

Suspects write letters
As aim not ready to surrender just yet
Some work is to be done
Mores organs to send

Committed to murder
I must fulfill my disease
Building servants for the afterlife
Letting them fall
Can they hear
The trees fall
Letting them fall
