Arcane rituals of death
Unholy praisings of his sinister powers
Poisonous waters flowing through my skin
Turning, twisting all of our weak hope

Hateful minds, these destructive feelings...
Slowly consuming all of our pitiful lives
Knifes cutting through the rotten flesh
Sinful joy, obsessions of self-destruction

Forever killing yourself
Madness of the mind! Painful pleasures!
End of all life..!
