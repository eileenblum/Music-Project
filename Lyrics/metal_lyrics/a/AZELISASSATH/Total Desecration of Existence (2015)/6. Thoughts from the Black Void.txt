Profane thoughts of the negative mind
Vile negative emotions, flowing through the pity of flesh
Hatred upon all forever hell the eternal death...
For what meaning has this existence?

Disgusting... meaningless...
Disgusting... meaningless....

Meaningless space within the void
Let the blackest darkness swallow it whole
Cursed be thy name and this foulful existence
Death has all within its rotting hands!
Malignant death worship, malignant death worship..!
