Demonic possession, I refuse the blood of light
Darkness within my mind, forever black!
Hatred, malignant hatred...
Spill the blood of man, for his eternal glory

Black as the night, death pass through our minds
Killing everything within our weak souls
I have turned away from the joy of life
Disgusting pleasures of mundane lives will

Nothingness, nothingness...
Put evil into your heart, follow the path of him!
End of life, end of all life!
