Behold the black manifestation of negative emotions
Poisoning your weak soul, put death into your heart!
Grant him your shattered lost will,
Follow eternity into the path of viciousness

Drained of all life, profane nihilistic cause
Nothingness for all and everything
Tombs of serpents devouring the essence of time itself
Into the mouth of satanic wrath

Nihilistic manifestations of profane power
Drained of life's will!
