Hatred... life... meaningless... the void is calling
Deathly pleasures of profound lust, endless sorrows
Filling the chalice of blood
Razors carving in the flesh of God

...the void is calling for you...
...the void is calling for you...

Obsessions of the mind
Death fanatic killings of the veil of flesh
Ending suicidal fear, lives weak will...
Leaving the path of life...!
