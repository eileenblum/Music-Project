My body soaked in poisonous waters.
My soul steaming from the veins buried under my skin.
I grab the tree of the blinded light.
Infects the lives of a falling god.
Weakens the spirit of their never-lasting hopes.
From my hands the evil prince eats from the holy spirit. Devours the earth.
Consumes cosmos in all its blasphemy and draws it into the flames of hell.
