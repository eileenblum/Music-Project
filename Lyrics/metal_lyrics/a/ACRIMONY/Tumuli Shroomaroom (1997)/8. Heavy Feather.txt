I was born a million years ago
On a blue star far away
I've talked to God for ages now
And he answered back today

Step aboard my spaceship, friend
This timeless - journey now
Don't worry if you can't free your mind
Take this - I'll show you how

Step aboard my spaceship
The spaceship of the mind

Made for magic wood
