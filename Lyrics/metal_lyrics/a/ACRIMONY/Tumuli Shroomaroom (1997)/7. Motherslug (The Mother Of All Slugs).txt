Dancin' mother, twirling round,
Barefood dancin'
Mother naked, sing to me
A song of wonder
Dancin' mother, up in the sky
As old as time
There's a wind amongst the trees
swirling round

Yeah...

Dancin' Mother, come join our tribe
And we'll get high
So dance the dance around the fire
I'll take you there. Dancin' mother
In these woods
Come mix your magic
So take me home, to our planet, far away.
Yeah...
