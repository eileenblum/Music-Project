There was a thought at the beginning of time
All lives were known yours and mine
A conscious thought
A thought of love

Dance round the fire
Dance round the fire

You say to me
A chemical reaction
To create new life
Create mankind
But don't you feel that deep inside

Dance round the fire
Dance round the fire

Won't you sell my soul

Down, down and down...
