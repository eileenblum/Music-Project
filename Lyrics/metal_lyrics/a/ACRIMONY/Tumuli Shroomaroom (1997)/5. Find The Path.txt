Look into my eyes
I see bizarre lights
Look into my eyes
Look into my mind
I see bizarre lights
Look into my mind

Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes
Look into my eyes

We pay the price for thinking
We pay the price for thinking
We pay the price for thinking
We pay the price for thinking

Is this what grows at the back of my mind
Looking down through your eyes
I just feel so fucking down
Give me some Valium

Do it, do it
Give me some Valium
