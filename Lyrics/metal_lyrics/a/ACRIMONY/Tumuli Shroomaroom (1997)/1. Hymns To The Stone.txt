Goddess, she brought from afar
A race of proud people from a blue star.
They came to this planet a long time ago,
and on their new world
they worshipped the stone

Hear the chants of the Celts
Drifting through the woods
Hear the voice of the druid
Hymns to the stone

Remember your homeland
A land proud and fair
They put magic elixir on body &amp; amp; hair
The blue star of Wode
Yet it is so easy send your mind to the place

Our heads to the stone, yeah...

Hymns to the Stone
