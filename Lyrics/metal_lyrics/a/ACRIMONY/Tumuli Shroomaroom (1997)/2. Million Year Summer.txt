I'm not fooled by the tales I tell,
so why the fuck are you my friend
I've never been as far as space
so tell me friend have you - yeah

I've never had a million year summer
I've never had a million year summer

But then again my memory fails
The smoke you know, it clouds my mind
I've never seen a spiral dance
Or try to kiss the planet Wode

Repeat Chorus

My summer was a million years
The sacred oak, my home, my dwell
I've touched the furthest depths of space
The holy stone is mine now - yeah

Glory to the day
