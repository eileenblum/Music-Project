Oh won't you sit with me?
It's time for us to see
For I gave you your life
How do you repay me

My child I've always loved you
I always will you know, my child
I gave you your life
How do you use your will
C'mon let's go

You are my creation
A star in my eye
Now is no time to cry
Oh can't you hear my voice?
