Bonded in leather
Pumping blood through my veins
Sweet virgins sacrificed
Screaming with pain
Drifting through night air
Life's so insane
Dark scattered figures
Shooting steel through my brains!

Taken by force, showing no mercy
Taken by force, lay your life on the line
Taken by force, your life's so dirty
Taken by force, save your soul while there's time

Living a nightlife
Life's living low
Low hearted beasts
Leaving tracks in the snow
Numbers are searching
Searching the light
Just to be crushed
In the dark of the night

Taken by force, showing no mercy
Taken by force, lay your life on the line
Taken by force, your life's so dirty
Taken by force, save your soul while there's time

Shattered and hopeless
You've poisoned your mind
Cast of your worries
You'll leave'em behind
Drowning in sorrows
Tomorrow's not seen
Never know where you're going
Or cared where you've been...

Taken by force, showing no mercy
Taken by force, lay your life on the line
Taken by force, your life's so dirty
Taken by force, save your soul while there's time
