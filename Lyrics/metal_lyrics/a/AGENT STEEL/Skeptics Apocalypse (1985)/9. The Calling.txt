In every living thing in this planet has an aura.
The area that you are discussing now is the aura of this planet.
It is the Communicative Channel to which the
Million Council governs this planet.
Anyone going into the area when the Communicative Channel is open
do not disappear, but they are in the timeless void.
They're all perfectly alive and well.
It is only area to which the Council can communicate with this planet.
