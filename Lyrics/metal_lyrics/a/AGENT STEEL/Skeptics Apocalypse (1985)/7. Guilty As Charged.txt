Genesis now we're to stay
Our evolution stunted Earth betrayed
Trapped inside this mortal cage
Repelling masses now your soul's in rage

You're all guilty as charged...
Guilty as charged

Eyes of fire stare into space
Carcass showing shadows grey
Living in the final age
You're falling in, in the hands of fate

You're all guilty as charged...
Guilty as charged

In the beginning the universe fell
Emanating the formula DNA the fraction 2/3rds
The number 23
Now we have one Adam and Eve before the jury of the Council
And she's been given her final verdict
Guilty as charged

Now you've become one of them
Nobody cares at all they'll never win
Lakes of fire forged in hate
Prepared for, for the skeptics race

You're all guilty as charged...
Guilty as charged
