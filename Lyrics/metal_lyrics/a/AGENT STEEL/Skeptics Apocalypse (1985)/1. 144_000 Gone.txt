As the bleak of dusk ordains the eve
For the chosen
Intensified magnetism blares
In through the night
Echoed whispers of patience led by no refusals
And all that remained were the leeches scratching for space...

Lift us up take us away
Leave us not behind to decay
Let us see the ascension
To know departure is sure

Colossal reap the skeptics muddy cyclones turn a blissfully
Awaiting fate with bitter taste life goes on just the same
All of sudden sorrow builds with no escape in view
Your time here is through
And the master of deception keep the secret
To the clue from me and you
How do we know where do we look to find
A way out from tormented territories
