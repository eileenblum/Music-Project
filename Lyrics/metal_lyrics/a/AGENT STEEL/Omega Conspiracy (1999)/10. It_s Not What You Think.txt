Something's wrong with the world
Something's wrong with the view from here
It's so hard to explain
The Visions I see are rarely clear
Just below the lie I am sure of hides the real
Reality-We feed machines-with minds in need of worth

Contact made with the truth
Through lines of code on my computer screen
Binary diamonds of proof
Shining stars unlock doors made of dreams
Beyond required imagination hides the hive
Born from AI We live the lie cocooned in lieu of life

With dreams we feed reality
Your fantasy a fallacy?
Imprisoned by your memory...a memory?

There's no promise of peace
There's no comfort and no guarantees
Once the systems been killed
We'll have no choice; we'll have to rebuild
And life won't be the pretty picture you recall
But it will be reality and you'll be free

With dreams we feed reality
Your fantasy a fallacy?
If you could see what I have seen-would you destroy The Matrix?
If you could see what I have seen-would you destroy The Matrix
and try...try...try?
live or die?
live or die?
