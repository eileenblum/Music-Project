[intro solo]

The lonely... 
They travel on and leave behind, 
The sands of time, 
The wind forgot 
The spy... 
He leaves his mark and then moves on 

The hatred, 
That people show is like their mirror 
The echoes... 
Of the voices crying out 
Ring out, 
Through... The Traveler 

[solo]

Their hatred is their mirror
