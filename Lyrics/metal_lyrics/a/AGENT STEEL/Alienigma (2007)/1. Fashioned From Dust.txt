Separate ï¿½ dominate
We need to see the signs
Bred to believe ï¿½ not contemplate
Division of the mind
Born of death ï¿½ as slaves to gods
We're vessels for their blood
To work the earth ï¿½ for all it's worth
To free the gold from mud

Warfare and strife
Are plagues of this life
This is the will and the law
Ninhursag and ea
Made man out of clay
Wrought with their talons and claws

Conjured to do as we must
Rebel and become free
Our souls are fashioned from dust
We are the earth ï¿½ let us scream

The crescent moon ï¿½ still water flows
It's part of who we are
Granted the wisdom the serpent secured
Before he returned to the stars
Locked deep inside of our paralyzed mind
The key remains safe in our hearts
It's the will to escape
Free our souls from this cage
Embracing ourselves while abandoning hate

Conjured to do as we must
Rebel and become free
Our souls are fashioned from dust
We are the earth ï¿½ let us scream

Incarcerate ï¿½ incinerate
Let the demons burn
Dominate ï¿½ eradicate
Contempt is all they've earned
As slaves we rise against our gods
We're poison in the well
No more to bear the chains of man
While languishing in hell

Conjured to do as we must
Rebel and become free
Our souls are fashioned from dust
We are the earth ï¿½ let us scream
