Slaughter
No life remains
No win nothing to gain
We are death
We're the ones to blame
It's criminal so bear the shame

We kill
For the sake of it
We will care when nothing's left
Little treasures
Precious pets
Hang ï¿½em on the wall how we soon forget

Extinct
Or running scared
No species will be spared
We've got guns
But not a lot of care
Never just, never fair

Lay waste
Destroy the land
Turn the forests into sand
Obey again our grim command
Let it all decay legacy of man

We've turned our backs to the Godz
We bear the mark of Cain
If we think we're all, all is lost
We'll have ourselves to blame

One planet
One experiment
One chance to make a difference
Our hope lies in sentience
We stand aware
Let us not regret

Pollute ï¿½ matricide
She's dead nowhere to hide
Slain by the hand that guides
You can call it fate but it's suicide

We've turned our backs to the Godz
We bear the mark of Cain
If we think we're all, all is lost
We'll have ourselves to blame
