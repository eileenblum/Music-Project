Liar ï¿½ have you no soul
Teaching the world how to hate

Ethnic ï¿½ cleansing your goal
Cause war the state dominates

Corporate ï¿½ fascist you are
Provide us with tools of deceit

Use the blood
Convince us that some is unsound race
Racial hate
If we run this race we'll be dead in the ground

Victim
Used as a pawn
Suffer your fate for the king

Supremist
Fool that you are
Blind hate you can't see a thing
Divided ï¿½ so easy you fall
The man has a plan to see through
Ignitor ï¿½ this fuse that you set
As it burns it leads right back to you

Follow the leader
A trail carved of lies
March to be conquered

Your mind is so narrow
You can't compromise
Lamb to the slaughter

Endgame ï¿½ in action
Response is swift and sure

Your herd ï¿½ immobile
Those motives were so pure

Your act ï¿½ their vision
Aligned now out of sight

Your death ï¿½ is certain
And with you dies your dream

Follow the leader
A trail carved of lies
March to be conquered

Your mind is so narrow
You can't compromise
Lamb to the slaughter
