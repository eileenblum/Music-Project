Vanish into the ether
My mind reaching for a reason
In this life are we tools that are used to teach
Meaning or treason?

Assaulted daily we breathe in the fuel
Of dissension ï¿½ breeding tension
Tattered souls hang from threads
We are damned we are dead
If you're not yet I'm sure you'll keep trying

Insidious the machine weaves its webs
Of destruction ï¿½ gaining power
Spiders stalk on the laws spun of lies
Paralyzed flies are then devoured

The stabbing fangs of the bureaucrats
Soften the pain of the feeding
Cocooned vanquished and unaware
Liberty lying bleeding

Watch her bleed
Leave her lie ï¿½ let her die
It's your life you compromise

Watch her bleed
Leave her lie ï¿½ let her die

When it's done and we are safely chained
Our freedom behind us the memory remains
Sour truth tastes like sugared rain
In this world where the liars have everything to gain
We're all to blame should this come to be
We watched while they raped our liberty
We watched while they raped our liberty

Watch her bleed
Leaver her lie ï¿½ let her die

It's your life you compromise
When it's done and we are safely chained
Our freedom behind us the memory remains
Sour truth tastes like sugared rain
In this world where the liars have everything to gain
We watched while they raped our liberty
We watched while they raped our liberty
