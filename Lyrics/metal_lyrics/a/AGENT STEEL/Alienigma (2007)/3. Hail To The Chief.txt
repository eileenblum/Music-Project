Denial
I will accept all the hate you sell me
Official
I will believe all the lies you tell me
I'm weak
But you know what's right
You know what's perfect for me
I'll answer with weapons ablaze
I trust you implicitly

New rules
I like your rules ï¿½ I'll gladly follow your lead
Dress me
In khaki and brown
Those colors look strong on me
Show me the enemy
You say he lives right next door
If you say so he dies

Now that the sky is burning
Lead me to war
Now with a future uncertain
Lead us all to war
After the bullet has sped through our heads
After we sing songs in praise of the dead
We'll sing hail to the chief
Lead me to your war

No shame
I feel no shame in becoming subservient
Guide me
Let me smell blood ï¿½ the hound dog in me is hellbent
Feed me
A diet of fear ï¿½ keeping me loyal to you
I'm a child inside

Now that the sky is burning
Lead me to war
Now with a future uncertain
Lead us all to war
After the bullet has sped through our heads
After we sing songs in praise of the dead
We'll sing hail to the chief
Lead me to your war

Paint the sand wet with blood
And satisfy my lust
Erase the history beneath our fear's corrosive rust

Exsanguinate the infidels and treat their wives as whores
I only need one sad excuse
You've led us to your war

True blue
Trust me I'm true ï¿½ red, white and blue
Through and through
Your foe
I'm not your foe ï¿½ I've spent my life loyal to you
Why me?
Now I've got questions with your missiles pointing at me
Too late ï¿½ I die

Now that the sky is burning
Lead me to war
Now with a future uncertain
Lead us all to war
After the bullet has sped through our heads
After we sing songs in praise of the dead
We'll sing hail to the chief
Lead me to your war
