Alone in the void
Primordial begetter
Apsu did reign
A spouse he creates
Tiamat, the mother
Beauty and pain

Celestial Godz
A battle ordained shall be fought
The chamber of fates
The son of the sun would be sought

Niburu by name ï¿½ avenger by nature
With seed he was born
Tiamat enraged
Bent on destruction
In two, her life would be torn

Celestial Godz
Together the pair must collide
Let matron be lost
Niburu in heaven resides

Charging evil wind
The mother will swallow
Arcing lightning bolt
The storm made to follow
Shattered Tiamat lay
Her army in shackles
Marking her remains
A shrine to the battle

The father remorsed
Spouse mortally wounded
Her waters they ran
The rays of Apsu
Gently reflected
The healing began

Niburu beseeched
This half to new life we give birth
Our father agreed
So naming this daughter earth

Firm the land appeared
Blue waters surrounding
Sweet the atmosphere
The planets resounding
Shattered Tiamat lay
In her place such splendor
Earth and moon shall be guardians forever

Seed of life
Creators legacy
Moon and sun
Celestial destiny
Reigning king
Niburu is the law
Son of the sun
Shepherd of the Godz

Charging evil wind
Birth from destruction
Let new life begin
A gift from the heavens
Born of Tiamat's fall
Fragile earth daughter
Kingu to shine earth night
A shrine to the slaughter

History ï¿½ astronomy
Prophecy ï¿½ forever unbending
Is there truth
Among the stars?
Have we come so far?
Are we only beginning?

A route to fly
A show of force
We chart their course
And claim understanding

We read the sky
And dare to try
To convince ourselves
We're the first and the only
