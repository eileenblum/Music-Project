We hear of strength in numbers
An army bound of will in unity
If you're not with us you're against us
But us is always you
And we is never me

I see a planned misdirection
Manipulate through terror
Ever threatening
The brotherhood will stop at nothing
Control the mind with pain and prophecy

If there's a god
Why do we need your protection?
If there's a god
I hope he saves us all from you

I watch the panicked masses
Believing desperately in outright lies
Connived facilitating slaughter
The order conquers and the order divides

If there's a god
Why do we need your protection?
If there's a god
I hope he saves us all from you

Terrorize, mesmerize, codify
As real as it seems
Homogenize, supervise, genocide
Wash this planet clean
