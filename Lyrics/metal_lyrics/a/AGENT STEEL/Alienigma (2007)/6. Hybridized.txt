Succumbing to forces
No hope of deliverance
Zeta probes minds
Follow like sheep

Serpentine rulers
Slow domination
I've seen their eyes
I've been taught while I sleep

How can I trust in my mind?
Whose thoughts are these that I think?
Am I sighted or blind?
But I've seen their eyes ï¿½ evil eyes

Into your world I shall fly
Winged lord of dracoid creation
Infused anointed am I Grey blood
I wreak devastation

Farther I fall
Steal the breath from you all
I am force and I will dominate

I am the son
Share my blood with The One
I am scarred I mutate

Faster I fly
Draw the stars from the sky
Changing the timbre of man

Through a harmonic ring
It's my song that he sings
I am death and discipline

Relinquishing nothing
No cell stands before me
I change for the better ï¿½ V.9 I improve

Mankind my victim
His dreams I will shatter
It happened in me it can happen in you

Lizard genes pair with my blood
Changing the way that I heal
A biodisaster in skin
Venomous tongue bone of steel

Into your world I shall fly
Winged lord of dracoid creation
Infused anointed am I
Cold blood I wreak devastation
