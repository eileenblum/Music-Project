This grand design
The earth in which we trust
A tidal wave of thought reduced to dust
The mounting signs explain our time is nigh
When Planet X prepares to ride the sky

Magnetic yarns it weaves to thwart the sun
In its control the many become one
This frozen rope unites us with our Gods
King of the heavens feeds us to the stars

Haunted turning black earth is burning
It's calling you back you have nothing to say
Wretched slaughtered death of the daughter
The mother is left in a state of decay

Fire dragon flies
A tail of swirling moons
Earth is rendered still and on it's surface we're marooned
Captive in it's grasp
The darkness yet to come
Shattered earth renewed
It's remnants become one

Denying history our fatal flaw
To know the truth ignoring what we saw
The ground erupts the waters quickly rise
When north is east and Wormwood's in the sky

Haunted turning black earth is burning
It's calling you back you have nothing to say
Wretched slaughtered death of the daughter
The mother is left in a state of decay

Fire dragon flies
A tail of swirling moons
Earth is rendered still and on it's surface we're marooned
Captive in it's grasp
The darkness yet to come
Shattered earth renewed
It's remnants become one

After the wind
Life in the rain
Shadow of death and a season of pain
Few will survive
Though life will remain
Biding it's time to begin growth again

Haunted turning black earth is burning
It's calling you back you have nothing to say
Wretched slaughtered death of the daughter
The mother is left in a state of decay

Fire dragon flies
A tail of swirling moons
Earth is rendered still and on it's surface we're marooned
Captive in it's grasp
The darkness yet to come
Shattered earth renewed
It's remnants become one
