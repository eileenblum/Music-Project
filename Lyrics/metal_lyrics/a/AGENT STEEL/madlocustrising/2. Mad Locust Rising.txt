Their mating has started, there's no way to stop them,
Brushed by the wings of the King, Nostradamus
Thundering black of the swarms are upon us
The cup of the wrath, the winepress of death

The whore and the beast, are having a feast
On mankind and his weakness
The scabs of the lustful, the womb is distrustful
Subsiding with pain, The Abyss

A small open country with wide open fields
The Villagers run from the pain that they yield
The bite of the locust, the witchdoctor's potion
The curse of the insect's infection

Deceit is upon us, the sores that won't heal
The signs they're preparing are being revealed
They fly in a pack, prepare for attack
Carnivorously lusting your flesh

Flying, striking spreading their wings
There's no denying their presence
The prophecy's done, they warned us they'd come
Soon they'll be coming for you

The battle is won, but losing the war, 'Geddon is so very near
They've broken the seal, their coming for you... ATTACK

Locust and Plagues, Locust and Plagues
Locust and Plagues, Locust and Plagues

The Mad Locust Rising, revealing his wings
Preparing to fly once again
Soon others like him will rise up and fight
ATTACK, the bloody command

The Swarm's moving north will attack destroy
Cities and Kingdoms we've built
Slashing, Chomping the ends of the Earth
They seek to recapture the child

Across the waters the swarm moving closer
Their destination unknown
Commanded by vengeance with blood thirsty teeth
The blood of the Martyr's they shield

The woman repents, but still she is spent
There's no hiding guilt once brushed by the wings
The threshold of fate, the furnace of pain
It's waiting for you, the coming of Locust and plagues
