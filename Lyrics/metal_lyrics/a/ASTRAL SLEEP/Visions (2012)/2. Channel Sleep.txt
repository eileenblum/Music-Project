A day of hard work is through
I'm more exhausted than ever before
Its good to lie down on my soft bed
And to see what's on the channel sleep tonight

A few disturbing visions
News tell about rotting corpses on my backyard
Tonights movie is about love lost forever
My favorite series with the episode called "pain"

Suddenly i see with my eyes open
I hear a strange eerie music flowing around
I try to move but all my limbs are numb
Then i can feel something is looking at me
Beside my bed is sitting a man

He has no face
He speaks a language
Unknown to me

Behind me, at the door, there a shapeless form
That came through aeons, now to finally take me away
Over my body, there are ghosts dancing
Wraiths weighing a thousand tons
They came from hell to take me

Now the man is sitting no more
He jumps on me and grabs my throat

I am choking, i am choking, choking...

Suddenly i can see with my eyes open again,
I am almost drowning in my sweat
My room is bright, i can look around again
I can move my limbs, itâs all quiet (for now)
