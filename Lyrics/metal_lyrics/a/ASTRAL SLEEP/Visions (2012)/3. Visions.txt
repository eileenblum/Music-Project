I had visions of things i always wish to see
I kissed your lips and together we flew to the moon
I had visions of things i never want to see
I ripped off your heart not even knowing the reason why

I am not sure if i am ready to face you
Cause my dreams seem so real
That i cannot tell the difference
And i donât even want to find it out

Pain (and suffering) i wish to see
Beneath the sky painted with dreams
Bleeding through the wall of sleep
Pain and agony i have to see

These visions are full of love and death
I cant tell the good ones from the bad
Sometimes visions of death give hope
When visions of love cause pain

These visions that i see
Reflect the darker side of me
When i think about those images
i know they are not reality
But many times it feels
That their meaning is
Not just black or white

Like when i see myself stabbing you
It sometimes feels like the right thing to do
And when i see myself hanging from the tree
I feel that i could finally be ready to die

Satanic visions
Of suicide
Divine visions
Of eternal lies

Hanging from the tree
Jumping off the tower
Drinking the poison
Taking the last breath

Satanic visions
Unholy incantations
Dancing with darkness
Throughout visions
