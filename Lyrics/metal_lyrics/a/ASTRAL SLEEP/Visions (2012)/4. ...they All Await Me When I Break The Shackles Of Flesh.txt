Who are you?
You who are looking
Back at me from the mirror

That image in the mirror
Why do you remind me
Of someone i used to know?
Everything has changed suddenly
Vet it all began long ago

My mind destroying itself
Dark corridors and empty chambers
Inside of me
Armored doors and locked shutters
Cover my mind
Is the door closed forever?

The demon of fear and lies

I cast my soul into hades
And i hope that it will all be over
waves of despair flood my mind
A thousand years of solitude
Dark red flow
The river from the other side
I cut the gate open
So he may ride through

Who is that person?
Who has been honest to no one
Blindfolded by chaos and deceit
False scenes and masks
Where have i been?

I have been away for so long a time
My search is never over
But the closer i get, the more i feel
All the emotions deprived of me
Through the unknown and beyond
Pain and fear, sorrow and exhaustion
They all await me when
I break the shackles of flesh
