The towers
Built of stone of all kind
The guardians
Of all species
The dimensions
With every possibility
This purgatory like void
I will take the first step

This is the secret mankind explores all the time
This is the secret man will never expose
Oh lord, tell me why were here!
What's the purpose of this dream

For ages we have wandered
Through the gates
For ages we have wondered
Which gate should we choose

But all the gates are closed
To those who do not know the answers
To the riddles that the guardians
Present to those who trespass
Oh lord, tell me why we're here!
Oil lord what's the purpose of this dream?
Is it to gather knowledge
And to take it back

Is it to prepare myself
For what's coming next

I wrote this part last night with the lizard king
But i no longer remember what he sang to it
I hope that i will see him again
So he would tell me how old is the snake

For ages we have wandered
Through the gates
For ages we have wondered
Which gate should we choose
For ages we've had the knowledge of the ancients

And maybe we will know all the answers
Before our world ends as it is
