I gaze out of my window
All I see is a gray landscape
Few bizarre creatures passing me by
Outside there is nothing for me
No sun, no moon
Just an empty vision
Still they seem to like it
Our true nature is raped

When I look in front of me
I see a new reality
A reality that's not for me
A place where very few can see
Hollow shells everywhere
Running around the circle
Only images of present in their eyes
Forgotten past and unknown future

When I look into your eyes
I see no image of your mind
All that I can see
Is a wisdom rotted by this reality
I must say I am disappointed
To the view that I now see
This landscape reminds me
Of my dreams when all is gone

I can't take my life away so I will take yours
You took my heart away and ask me what's wrong
You keep telling me that there's a hope
But you cannot see, that I am dead!

When I look into your eyes
I see no image of your mind
All that I can see
Is a wisdom rotted by this reality
