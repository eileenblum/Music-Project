Reaching out for moon of the sky
And stars in absence of night
Thinking is there a reason
For this existence's failure
Lord of the skies and dust
Hear me when I call your name
I want to be like you
And clear this filthy horizon

And now I hide myself
In this place there is no one else
Who can see through these eyes of hate
My existence will fade

You will die in no time
And I'm not afraid to try

At first you think
That your feelings are true
But then you realise
That your soul is torn

You told me you like to kiss the mirror
But then you went to the arms of a window
You hated me cause I was outside
But when I left you came there too
Now I won't worship the mirror of love
I will crush it and break it down
In this mission I'm on my own
Cause everyone has the blackened window

I look at you
You look outside of me
This life is empty now
I will never be free

Turns out
I exist in a paradox
Where you want to go through the window
And outside you want to go back

Now I gaze
At these ruins
And I can't remember
Why I'm still here

The sky is open
For me to go there
As a star at the night
I lead your path
Can you feel the air shivering
My spirit flows in the wind
You smell the air
But it's too late to miss me

Now when I fall asleep
I hope not to dream the past
I hope to dream another world
And be there when I wake up
