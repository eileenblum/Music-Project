Waiting for the signs from the sky, which bleeds black poison.
The signs to tell that the wait is not futile.

Everything we have witnessed for the past centuries is a preparation for the final battle.
Every man and woman from any culture or corner of the world will express ultimate hate.

Every action man has made towards harmony is erased, only the passion of nature's will is to be seen.
Man will destroy itself, like it was written in the ancient prophecy.

Man has made the enemy of nature, machine.
Machines are made by men, the logic of machine is a simplified logic of man.

When machine collapses, man can rebuild it.
But when Man collapses, only nature can rebuild it.

Nature is to man what man is to machine.
