What do you see, when you look at the mirror?
Do you see something that is new to you?
No, you see the form that you've took, and the form that is your sigil of individuality.

When you look at me, you feel something between love and hate.
But when you look the different me, you become confused.

Our keys to life are self expression, honesty and perseverance.

We will stand proud, no matter how much you want us to change ourselves.
We will not be standing ignored, our goal is to perform a sinister act no one wants to see.

We are not perverts, we are not foolers.
We are ourselves, and that is the greatest shock of all.

We are ourselves, yet we will always be something new.

That is the key to life, being honest and showing your true inner self, no matter what the shell says.
