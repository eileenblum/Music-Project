I see the great warlord of spaces chasing me through the dimensions.
The dragon, the conqueror, the destroyer, any form it takes.
It chases me and never let's me go.
I can escape now and forever.
But I will never know what is after me and why.

In this world I can't tell what I should be looking at.
The world of unbalance, yet so great harmony, the world of dreams and the depths of mind.

The things that I will see here are true to me,
I have to find the way to read them right.

The corners of cosmic expressions are the keys to find your true self.
