Walking home, wondering where this will lead, I look at the stars and listen what they say.
They tell me that I don't belong in this world, and thinking about earthly things will waste my time.

The nightly forest in solitude, takes me back to the times when the will to survive was greater than the will to have fun.
Suicide is the greatest event of man at the time, when there is no meaning in what you do.
All that matters is that you live to empty words and to empty life that produces emptiness.

The power to resist is what we need in the days of grey.
