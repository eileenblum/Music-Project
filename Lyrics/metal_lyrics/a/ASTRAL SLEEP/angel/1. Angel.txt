You are an Angel I am an Angel Hail to be Satan
Angels will die
Angel your god is dead Hell is not far away
In my dreams I've waited for god to tell me the thruth
But when awake, I see Satan all around me
Angel you worship Satan But Satan does not need it
Every soul like yours will perish in flames I belive that
in dreams, I see Hell as it is
She cuts herself to get a contact The devil tells her
what to do She needs to live, she needs to act To show
the might of Satan
Don't waste your life Trying to understand Who is
who And what is what
Satan lives in our hearts God lives but he is weak
Angel you will become one With the light of lucifer
