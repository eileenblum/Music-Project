No one ever will leave me behind
I cast no shadow, light is too profound
I am the way, all stars align
A new reign. Uncrowned

With wounds adorned, we stand in line
River of blood leads to the shrine
Hand in hand, side by side
We look our gods dead in the eye

Shaved for burial. Soul lost inside
Anoint my skin, nothing to hide
I take the first step in the funeral pyre
A truth fire upon me

Reside in me
I am the cold
The barren tree
Reside in me
I am the fire no one can oversee

Truth fire
Not unto me
One tear at a time,
You are a threat to mine
Flood trenches
Dredge remnants
Of my past
Wash away my longing for me
To be the last

Come rain, wash us all away
Here come the first wave,
Nothing will remain
Forever more
No more

Too cold to drown in.
No more. No more.
The deep. Allowed in.
No more. No more.
