I'm letting blood for you now.
Bury me where I die
Just here and now.
Nail my torn flesh to the cross.
Thrust a spear deep in my side.
I carried my cross long enough.
I wear my love like a crown of thorns.
You carried your cross long enough.
I wrote you a bible in blood.
With my bleeding heart on the cover.
And a teardrop on every page.
These wounds will always remember you.
