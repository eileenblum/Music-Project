Stigma your name onto my lungs.
Every breath I take.
Is for you.
Every prayer I say.
For you.
You cut your name.
Into my flesh.
All the blood is for you.
Like a prayer for you.
I am the breath going in.
I am the breath coming out.
I am the breather but only for now.
I want you to know.
It's time to trade those tears for scars.
It's time.
To make your life worthwhile.
It's time.
And.
Never forget.
You'll always be the end of everything I've ever done.
You will always be.
The end of me.
