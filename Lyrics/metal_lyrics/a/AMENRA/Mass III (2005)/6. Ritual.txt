I am cutting of my fingers one by one.
Needle and tread
(A ten bead necklace. For you).
You are smiling.
For the first and the last time.
Now.
My body still bleeds invisible.
Chains encircle my broken wrists.
But we can get out of them.
Now.

[Ritual II - Off of 2009 compilation "Mass III-II + IIII"]

That one night
went one
had no words to say
floating eyes
reach out
we're one touch away
fingers entwined
stroking your hair
and it all became
too much to bear
and there you were
the morning sell
the morning light
it hurts me still

and when we touch
we are one world away
and that night we met
amongst the grace
we were one world away
and that's where we met

that one night
went one
had no words to say
a movement
hands
touched my face
Iâve never seen
so much grace
your floating eyes
I had drowned
still one touch away
that one night went one
had no words to say
you are smiling
for the first and the list time
now.
your body still bleeds invisible
Chains encircle my broken wrists
but we can get out of them
Now
