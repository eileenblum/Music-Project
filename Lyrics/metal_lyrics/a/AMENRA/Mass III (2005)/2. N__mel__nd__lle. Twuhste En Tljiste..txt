Count stars and wishes fall.
Now wish the same for me.
For you and me.
I'd give my life to make us whole.
Now.
Wish the same for me.
For you and me.
I'll have to get out of my head.
And have to get myself into your heart.
Like night.
There is no place.
Where you stop and I start.
It is like.
You cry with my tears.
And we share a smile.
Heaven in your arms.
And life is calling out your name.

Sacred stars leave sacred scars.
And you'd scar me deeper than you could ever wish for.
The golden tears they feed the soil.
And in times of hunger.
I will forcefeed you.
My love.
