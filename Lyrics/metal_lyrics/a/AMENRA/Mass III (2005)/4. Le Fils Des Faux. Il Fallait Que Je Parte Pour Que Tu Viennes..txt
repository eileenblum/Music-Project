And I must go.
For you.
To come.
And I will praise you into heaven.
I will raise you to the sun.
All rise.
For here comes the son.
All rise.
The father.
He is my king.
And I am just a throne away.
I am the heir.
One breath away.
I will rise as your son.
And I will be the one.
And to the warmth of the sun.
You will.
Come.
I will love and guide.
You.
As you were my own.
To the sons of the sun.
I will pray.
That no harm on them will come.
It won't ever get in their way.

You will rise as my son.
You will be the one.
All rise
