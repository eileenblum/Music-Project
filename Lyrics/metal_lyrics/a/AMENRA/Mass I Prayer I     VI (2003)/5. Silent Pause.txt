Your silence rings in my ears.
Long after you are gone.
And silence hurts at times like these.
And silence can be very noisy.
(Trust me)
My dearest scattered heart.
If I only could shelter you from that pain.
(Just to make it easier on you. Or me?)
Can you see my pain?
Could you bear this pain.
Would you bear this pain?
Can you feel my pain?
