Prick my finger and watch the hurt bleed away.
When you see blood.
Don't forget to breathe.
When blood sees blood.
Don't forget to die.
The cancer is spread.
This is the dance of the dead.
I stepped out my body to lead myself through these darker of days.
I took my own hand to lead me through this all.
