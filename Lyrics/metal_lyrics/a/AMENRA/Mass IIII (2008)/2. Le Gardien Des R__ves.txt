.we read scars and were the wounds.we pained our way and we knew then.we were
not coming back.her light.was all that came with me.as I descended.I was
building a world for you.as I descended.I found you in the darkness.as I
descended.our eyes.meet.a mirror.and in our tears shimmered this song.i reached
out my hands.in hope you would accept.to travel with me.through these dreams i
have kept.i wish we were and we always are.that wound.
