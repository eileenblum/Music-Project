I will never kneel down.
Because the knives are too sharp.
I won't let a hand hold me down.
I won't let a foot mark my ground.
The day.
Where pain became flesh.
Since that day on.
It had begun.

The window
Hand me the razor
Feed me the pain

Heee heee heee
The window
Oh uh ah

I'll be bathing in blood flow and I, I call my own
Only then I wish I had no, no glory I will fall

Seek truth.
And you will find me.
Stay close.
And you will see.
Speak silence.
And you will hear me.

Stay close and you will see.
That light will always reign over your shadow.
And you will never die like I did.
Your fire will always be inside of me.
You will always be a part of me.
The heart of me.
