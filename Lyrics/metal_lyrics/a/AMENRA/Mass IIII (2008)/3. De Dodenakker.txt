When I reach your land.
Will you be out there?
I buried the day in that field.
And grew my past there.

Reach.
When I reach out my hand.
Will you be near then?
Buried myself in that field.
I hoped to find you there.
When I call out your name.
Will you appear then?
Or will it stay silent and will I die alone again?
I carried the void.
Down deep in me.
Reach.
When will I reach.
The new morning.
The new day.
And we will meet.
Death.
The harvest of blood.
In our blood.
In our eyes.
Give us.
A lamp before our feet.
A light before our eyes.
Give us courage.
To live.
A life dead inside.
There is no end.
That we will not reach.
