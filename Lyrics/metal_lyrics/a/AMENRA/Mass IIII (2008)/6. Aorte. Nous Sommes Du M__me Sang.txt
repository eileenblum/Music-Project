A heart full of roses and painted wings.

Thorns rip.
My heart outs.
A loud.
Allowed.

Incomplete.
I stumble.
Into you.
Glass.
Broken.
Like me.
Unseen.
Blood in my eyes.

I cannot see.
Myself.
Fall into you.
Blood in my eyes and now I realise.
I have fallen.
Into you.
And your presence.
Every second of the day.
Until my heart stops.
You will be my reason.
I died that day.
And so did you.

Feathers sprung from my shoulderblades.
And my black wings unfurled.
All your human features disappeared.
You come unseen.
As a guide.
To never leave.
To stay by my side.
Black feathered wings unfurl.
Touch the ground.
Human features disappear.

You arise to shine.
And I fell into you.
You lead the way.
And I trusted in you.
Then went away.
And I held onto you.

And I fell into you.
