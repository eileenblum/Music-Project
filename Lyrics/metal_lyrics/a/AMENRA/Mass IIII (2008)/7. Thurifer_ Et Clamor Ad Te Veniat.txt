Incense.
The scent.
The smell of my burning flesh.
I'm sent.
I am your burning flesh.
Flames burn bones to cinder.
I want to see you burn.
I want your ashes to bury the streets.
I want to see you burn.
I want your ashes to fall at my feet.
One fine day.
You will feel my warmth.
You will breathe my smoke.

I am mounting up to you.
As prayer.
For I am the sacrifice.
I am the carrier.
And I will wash my face in the flames.
Risen.
Now hidden.
Burn away.
Cleansing is near.
I would burn alive for you.
