one day I awoke
and I saw
the world. that comes from us

dearborn. I will remain. a world.
and death comes from my ashes.

we were called upon
and awaited a sign

there was a fire divine

remember us
and you will remain
we all fell
and overcame

bereaved
this is our soil
remember it
and it will remain

dearborn
when ashes reign
remember us

we were the flame

now when will I be wounded enough?
