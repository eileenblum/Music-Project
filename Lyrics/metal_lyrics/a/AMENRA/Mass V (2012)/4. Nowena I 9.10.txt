the darkest hours will seem long
they will feel like for ever
then new light breaks into dawn

novena burns for my brothers at night
a flame that burns the bodies of light

brothers burn. I see the fire in their eyes.

the past is your now
the present now passed

now is the time

(everything awaits you and the light will let you)
