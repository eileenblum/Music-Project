-your warmth is all i had-

I never wanted to forsake you
I never thought that time would take you
I hold a hand up above

a worn heart. love.

I never wanted it to break you
I always hoped for light to take you

let the light fall upon

your face. touch. grace.

I never thought that I could make you
feel so alone

the two. you. gone.

the rain of fire pours down on me
you. reign down on me.
down on knees.

guilt. come pound on me.
