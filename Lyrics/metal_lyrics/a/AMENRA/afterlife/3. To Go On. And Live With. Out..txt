To my child

For your eyes alone
All these years now gone

A love so real
Never dies at all
And what i feel
Will not fade away

To my child
Carry on

For your eyes alone
A life long and now gone

And all I ever wanted was to hold
You the forgotten way every day
I now belong to heaven,
I could not stay there with you

In a world without salvation
You will pain your way
In my world my salvation
My scream bares your name
All glory no shame

Rest assured that my wings
Can carry you too
Rest assured
That my wings they will carry you
To where ever you want to go
