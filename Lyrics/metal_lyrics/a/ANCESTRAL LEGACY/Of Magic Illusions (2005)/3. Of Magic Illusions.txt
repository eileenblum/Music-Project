Riding through the darkest night, everything so strange. Endless, timeless, fearless, behind this illusion. Nothing's what it seems to be, I cannot see my (future) destiny. My life and dreams are shattered, and left alone in tyranny. Dreams of a twisted tale, a terrible vision to behold, and forever gaze into time, feel the bitter tears, time closes near, can it all be true? Endless dreams, love and tragedy, Save us from this magic illusion, time closes near, take me to a different dimension. Dreams of twisted tale, open your eyes, it's true
