I'm standing here all alone, by the sea between life and death. Waiting for the ferryman,to take me to the other side. The life I had I leave behind, a life of eternal sorrow. Staring at the other side, knowing: there's my freedom. See the blood dripping from my wrists, feeling my pain drift away. Now I clearly see that, mortal life is not meant for me. He's getting closer, the man who'll take me there. I'm leaving this world, the world which didn't understand. Darkness in my mind, I've finally found peace in my soul. Come on over, cross the sea, you will find eternal peace of mind...
