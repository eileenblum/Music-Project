The shadows on the wall, that creeps up from behind. Abandon sanity, (when) it penetrates your mind. Whispers in the night, that makes the heart beat fast. A breath upon your neck, will this minute be your last? Just vague memories of unfinished dreams, in the end maybe nothing's what it seems?A scent of snow in the air, the silent season is approaching. Covers everything under the shining sun, leaves this earth white and pure.
