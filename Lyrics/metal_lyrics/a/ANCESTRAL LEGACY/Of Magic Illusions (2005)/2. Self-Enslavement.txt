Feels like a nightmare, I'm crawling, I'm falling, there's no way to break out, I'm trying, denying. Escape from myself seems so hopelessly useless, feeling so different, not knowing where I'm going. I have become a slave to myself, a victim of my twisted mind... Turn into someone I don't know, take me to places I don't wanna go. No one sees, no one seems to care, I just know things are getting clear. I'm changing my mind, I change to someone I have never met before. Who am I, please tell me, will I be lunatic from now 'till ever more? I'm changing my mind, turning to someone I don't know, I change to someone I have never met before. Who am I? Won't you please tell me, will I be a lunatic from now till ever more? Will I Fight myself to keep the sanity, who can say how will tomorrow be?
