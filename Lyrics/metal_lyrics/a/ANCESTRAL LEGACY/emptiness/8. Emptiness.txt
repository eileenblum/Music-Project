Take a walk in my mind, surely you will find... pain, Eternal emptiness, driving me insane. Dark forces of night, calling out my name, How much more I can take, I don't know, I don't know. Take me away, I can't take it anymore, Take me away, I can't stand another day. Empty eyes of death, staring into mine, Dead among the living, damned for all time. Silent screams for help, nobody hears, Eternal emptiness, I am in hell, I'm in hell
