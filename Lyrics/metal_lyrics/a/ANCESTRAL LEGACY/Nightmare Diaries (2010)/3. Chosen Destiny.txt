You are the chosen one
for this soul of mine
Come with me to the end of time
I lead you to the sacred heart
So you can heal my blood in a work of art
In a work of art

Find this treasure if you want to be free
Or you will never get rid of me
Seek for the light in the blackest night
Go to the lowest of the highest you know
Maybe it's there at the end of the rainbow

Dance on the sun
Dance on the moon
Can you feel my presence like I do?
You'll never find what you're looking for
So it's time to lock your door

If you can find a spark in the deep blue sea
Set the wings on fire and fly
Or just let it be
Blow the curtain without a wind
Then you will be free
And I will forget your sin
Forget your sin

Bring me a sign of the zodiac
Aries, Taurus, or Leo
If you can find it, then you are free
And I promise I will let you go
Be free, my soul, and see you bow

Dance on the sun
Dance on the moon
Can you feel my presence like I do?
You'll never find what you're looking for
So it's time to lock your door
