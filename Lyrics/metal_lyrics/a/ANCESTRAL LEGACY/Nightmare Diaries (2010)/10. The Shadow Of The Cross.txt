Illusions, smoke and mirrors
Fairytales and ancient lies
Naive, witless subjects
Shape and mold their weakened minds
Ascendance crooked masters
Subjugation lord of flies
Shameless supplication
Begging on their knees they cry

(Blind faith hides in the shadow of the cross)

Needing you follow
Empty and hollow
Concavity

Praying, raising your hands
Pleading to an empty sky
Sermons, endless preaching
Trust and never asking why

Callow congregations
Sheep who never realize
Vacant puppet bodies
Drained, forever live the lie

Mindless tunnel vision
Ostracized and turned away
Faith in blind salvation
Sterilized reality
Weakness and disillusion
Ignorance and power play
Spineless irresolution
Lay down in conformity

(Blind faith hides in the shadow of the cross)

Needing you follow
Empty and hollow
Concavity
