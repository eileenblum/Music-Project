We've been living with a grief
We've been up, and down and all around 
We've buried all our feelings too deep in the ground. 
There's more to see that can ever be seen 
There's more to find than can ever be found, 
There's more to life that our imagine surround. 

Close your eyes and drift away. 
Now you have shelter from the rain 
You're no longer lost in fear.

I'm scared of turning out the light
It takes my strength to face the night. 
I know when you are my guide 
Everything is alright. 
How can a memory last this long
When even stars burn out and fall
We know that in the end 
This happens to us all. 
I guess you know there's a reason 
Why I'm crying here tonight! 
Will you guide me like a beacon 
And make sure I'll be alright?

You try to sleep
But the fear has taken over the night. 
When you close your eyes you see faces and places. 
You see dead smiles and yourself crying silent
Between two faces that you can never forget

It's like a razor on me. 
Sometimes dreams are coming true
Sometimes life gets in the way. 
Turn around and you'll see me fall
Open your eyes and you will see me cry. 
I'd walk for days through pouring rain
Just for you, and you alone
