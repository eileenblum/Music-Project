Way out there all alone
The soft line where the sky meet ocean 
It is incomprehensible as existence 
Incomprehensible as death
Eternal as longing... 

In the dark green water
I see the color of his eyes, 
Captures the pain, the loneliness, and the raw emotion. 
I see the color of his eyes and the raw emotion. 
Nostalgia of the past always comes back
To haunt us at such times

The dark and doorless cave that I dwell in
Nothing can break through the wall, into my secret chamber. 

The swallow pool, open itself to me, 
Swallowing me, washing away the chains of deception. 
Cleansing me of the pain, and the suffering
Until I'm whole once more.

Perhaps I should just live here, amongst the dead. 
Perhaps I should join them? 
This night I feel your breath
This night I feel your voice. 
I miss your warm embrace 
The cold winds of death have come for me. 
And there in the night I will lay beside you
Perhaps in death... 

The swallow pool open itself, open itself 
The swallow pool open itself to me 
The swallow pool swallowing me 
Washing away the chains of deception.

I miss your warm embrace 
The cold winds of death have come for me. 
And there in the night I will lay beside you
Perhaps in death...
