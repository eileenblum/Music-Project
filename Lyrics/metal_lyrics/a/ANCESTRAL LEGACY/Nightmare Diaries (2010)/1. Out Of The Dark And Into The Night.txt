It's a waste of time,
Living forever chained to other's dreams. 
Give in because it's all you've seen. 

You're a fucking lie. 
Molded and shaped you cease to be yourself. 
You're a fucking lie. 
Tug at the leash that is your hell.

Stay inside the lines. 
Weak and diluted, drained you just concede. 
Useless you cover on your knees. 

Do you miss your spine? 
Safer to follow rules than take the lead. 
Do you miss your spine? 
Lost in the mass conformity. 

It's a waste of time. 
Stay inside the lines...
