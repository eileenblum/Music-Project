And if your heart of glass should shatter
I'd be there to mend it back together. 
Picking up every piece that scattered, no hurry
I'd sacrifice forever. 
But I guess it doesn't really matter
And it probably won't ever. 
As I'm no more than a feather
Trapped within the wind.

And if my shattered heard should find repair
Please don't think my love has ceased. 
There'll always be room for you there
Deep within the mended pieces. 
That's just how things are
As I'm no more than a feather, lost from home. 
The wind has taken me so far
Trapped within the wind...
