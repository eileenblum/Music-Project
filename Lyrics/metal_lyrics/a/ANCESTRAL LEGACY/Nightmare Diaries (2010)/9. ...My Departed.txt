I watch you lay there
Withering before me. 

I fixate on your eyes... I will become lost within. 
My heart a fading whisper 
Of the life I once knew
We drift away, knowing this is the end of my misery.

I watch you lay there
Withering before me. 
In slumber I find solace. 
Eternal darkness awaits you. 

I look to the window
Dead leaves fall to the ground... 
Graceful, they lure me away
Away from your loving gaze. 
I'm lost.

You watch me, I lay here, 
Withering with you. 
Our eyes meet one last time. 
Why must this love end? 
Emptiness awaits me
I take my last breath. 
These final moments
I must now cherish them.

My mind is free of this pain. 
I lay my head on your shallow breast and dream... 

As my heart fades, I become one with you. 
Please let me go... take with you the memories. 
I will never love again, this is my final goodbye. 
Your silence leaves this soul into pain. 
I would sacrifice forever to feel that love again. 
Embrace our shadow, the darkest of dreams... 
Memories are dying as we fade away...
