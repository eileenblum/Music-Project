One body, two different souls, fallen too deep into two separate worlds, don't be afraid to hold me tight, don't be afraid to close your eyes. Why do we stand out in the rain, trying to wash away all the anger and pain? Time is so unkind. Screaming, dreaming. There ain't no standing tall -in the shadow of the shame, when everybody knows -I'm a victim of the game. In my mind I see pictures flashing by, and I wonder if it's time for me to say goodbye. Trying to find a reason to fight, but all I can see is myself on a downward flight. I pray my saviour, and beg him to tell, that I'm bound for heaven, released from this spell, for I feel I've done my time in hell. There ain't no light when I'm standing in the shadow at night, I feel the fright when I'm the victim of the game at night. Things haven't changed since I picked up those broken pieces, I can only admit it, I have no future with my past. Why do we stand out in the rain, trying to wash away all the anger and the pain? Don't be afraid to hold me tight, don't be afraid to close your eyes. The big print was the truth, words I didn't understand...
