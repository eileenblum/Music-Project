Morning breaks, another day
Life still pulling at your feet. 
Fall in line, follow the way 
Another hollow face to meet. 
Minutes pass, it's just begun
Life still picking at your mind. 
March in step, start to run, 
Precious thoughts are left behind.

Sunshine pours, heat it grows
Life still grabbing at your hands. 
Keep focus on your path they chose,
Listen closely, but don't understand. 

Hours fall, time persists
Life still tearing at your heart. 
Just a number on a list, 
Thoughts that you can't take apart. 

Night approaches, darkness falls
Life still feeding at your soul. 
Marching still, the master calls, 
Your mind no longer in control.

Hours fall, time persists
Life still tearing at your heart. 
Just a number on a list, 
Thoughts that you can't take apart.
