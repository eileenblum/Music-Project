So I didn't find your heart today 
But there's always tomorrow's sun. 
Maybe someone's heart will change 
And this emptiness will be undone. 

It's so easy being down 
Falling through self pity, sinking further 
Blinded to your own abuse. 
And all the pain seeps through your skin so easily, 
'Cause you convince yourself you have some excuse.

Once again tonight alone I'll stay. 
There'll always be another day
I know it's such an easy thing to say 
It's so simple to keep running away.

So I didn't break a smile today 
There's always tomorrow to try. 
Maybe I'll see your face 
And I won't have to wonder why. 

And I didn't find your heart today 
But there'll always be tomorrow's light. 
Maybe one of our hearts will change 
And make everything alright?

So I didn't break a smile today 
There's always tomorrow to try. 
Maybe I'll see your face 
And I won't have to wonder why. 

And I didn't find your heart today 
But there'll always be tomorrow's light. 
Maybe one of our hearts will change 
And make everything alright?
