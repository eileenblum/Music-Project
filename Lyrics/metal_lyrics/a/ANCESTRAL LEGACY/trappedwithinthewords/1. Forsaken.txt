Forsaken - left alone I am. Tranquility - embraces my cold being. Morbid thoughts - of eternal suffering. Insanity - is slowly taking control. Existence - (is) the feeling of pain. But no answer - to my wondering why, Trying to breathe - in the vacuum of eerie presence. Realizing - that time doesn't mind at all. Daylight's gone, damage done.Spellbound by my haunted dreams, now it seems, the final hour's closing in. Feel the sin, the temptress' power... Raised among sheep, black is my colour, my -fate is sealed, shortest straw (has) been given to me. Drift into oblivion, I have lost, you have won. My tomorrow's dead and gone, my life's creation here is done. Left alone, embracing my cold being, eternal suffering is slowly taking control. The feeling of pain to my wondering why, realizing faith is healed, time to kiss this world goodbye. Drift into oblivion, I have lost and you have won, my tomorrow's dead and gone. Time has ceased to treat me right, giving up without a fight, now I kiss this world good night. You're still hanging on, blacking out the part that hurts, you are drowning, but you won't let go. You are blinding yourself, to the cold hard facts of life, someday you're giving up, simply more than you can take.
