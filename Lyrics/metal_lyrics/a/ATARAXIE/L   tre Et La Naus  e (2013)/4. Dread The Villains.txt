Here comes that glorious race of degraded beings
Smiling at those who will cross their usurped path

Premeditating everything required to establish fake links
But driveling in the back whenever they will be able to

All these scheming evildoers aspire to be surrounded
High are their hopes they won't refrain from trespassing
No real effort at all to make, they just shamefully wait for
The best moment to appropriate all thoughts shining

Mistrust the villains
Spokesmen of empty words
Dread the villains
Manufacturers of black phlegm

Will they ever get tired of overfeeding themselves?
Engorging more and more without absorbing once
Never satisfied, they're even able to eat your brain
So make sure to wrap ignominies with distorted gold

Keep on hand-feeding them but always string them along
Fill their hunger with scum until they can't forevermore
Envenom their thoughts until they are on the road to ruin
Then embalm them and use their remains as scarecrows

Teach your children how to identify double dealers
Do your best to fit them out with only strong weapons
Show them how to vomit astutely in their hollow brains
Sullying is the only weapon of those who envy
