Cutting your flesh, burning your skin repeatedly to try to ease your stifling despondency
Will lead you to a state where your mind will only be replete with suffering and self pity
Refusing to liberate your mind from obsessions and to be given any form of guidance
Will make you rule a self sufficient land full of anguish, phobias and mind expansions

Firm belief in demonic possessions (repulsion of your deficient human sides)

Deep inside of you, you can't convince yourself they're all staring at you in a well meant way
No trust at all, you have to live everyday with the judgments about your way of acting
Looking through those vicious eyes, you only see perversion and an upcoming conspiracy
They are determined to lobotomize you, steal all your might and forsake you in an institution

Voices in your head resonating again and again, communication with the world above
Feel the beast inside you being cheered by orders coming from your spiritual comrades
Hear the avenging spell guiding you into a bleak landscape where only treason dwells
Leave your humanness there and schedule your crusade against whoever can destroy you

Anyway, they all know what they have done to you so they will pay for their betrayals
They shouldn't have taken you for a fool, and left you here alone between these walls

Now it's time for retaliation, blood has to be spilled
Blades are sharp and ready to carve the flesh of traitors
Unholy sacrifices to take revenge against dire humiliation
Only impure remains will be laid in my row of coffins

In the battlefield, all your opponents have such a friendly face
They look like living deads (sic) who have been poking fun at you
Their laughters (sic) are now so piercing that they make you feel dizzy
Your ears are about to explode when inner allies start dictating

While wrath is exploding all these curs are now screaming for your mercy
Why don't they choose to fight and put an end to this unfair cruelty?
Yet, then come the lucid moments after the well deserved mutiny
After being beaten up you are now enchained like an enraged animal

Gisant au milieu des tes miasmes putrides, tu somnoles et t'enfonces
Contemple l'interdit de cette corde, salvatrice d'un fardeau qui te ronge
Renonce Ã  cette tumeur de vie que tu portes et abime ton destin

Las de reagir ou d'eprouver une quetconque sensation et Ã©tats d'Ã¢me
Ton sang se glace, la dÃ©livrance est proche, tet est dÃ©sormais ton destin
Ne plus Ãªtre au sein de ce bas monde et rester incompris jusqu Ã  la fin
