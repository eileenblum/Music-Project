Another day, another morning, you wake up with no urge at all inside you
You just open your curtains and look at people being through your window

No effort at all to provide, you are just an extra piece in a living scenery
Everything was there when you were born, it won't change when you'll be gone
How little we all are, almost useless in the centre of a disguised nothingness
Realize once and for all, you're just another drop in a self devastating ocean

Regarde-toi dans ce miroir et contemple toutes ces marques dur ton visage
Jour aprÃ¨s jour, tu te vides davantage et te flÃ©tris sans aucune rÃ©elle emprise
Tu dois supporter le poids de cete dÃ©fante dans ces yeux qui pourtant espÃ©rent
Nous aurions tous aimÃ© naitre sans aucune forme de conscience de soi 
Vivre simplement comme des animaux rÃ©pondant Ã leurs instincts primaries
Tout serait bien plus simple ainsi, oui tout aurait Ã©tÃ© bien plus simple ainsi
Nous n'aurions pas Ã  porter ce fardeau de vie conduisant Ã  cette nausÃ¨e
Nous empÃªnchant de vivre et de profiter de chaque instant prÃ©sent...

Alone at your table, nobody to speak with, staring at all this mess around you

Counting hours passing and waiting stoically for the end of that cursed day
Nobody remaining at your sides but just wastes and your own mortal emanations
They all remind you that routine of life gnawing slowly all your bones and soul
And wrecking that own free will to take part in all these kind of absurd scenarios

Finally, your stomach starts yelling, it's time to feed all that mass of living flesh
Maybe, tomorrow will be a better day and this time it will worth waking up
So your hands start crawling towards your cutleries (sic) like trembling filthy worms
Sorely you hold them tight like a little bird bringing painfully its prey to its nest
Enjoy the flavour of tasteless dead matter decomposing in your slobbery mouth

Now, it's time to foster your sociality (sic), bring back some fuel in that suffocating home
You must convince yourself you're above all of them to keep that faith towards life
You want to be nourished by complaints and weeping;
You want them to beg for your help

Domination is the key: ruling over their minds will help you to reach the end of the day
So you start visiting your usual places and take part into (sic) countless futile conversations

Walking back home, now you pray your legs to not leave you once and for all
Focused on your feet, you try to avoid the sharp stones and curious staring eyes
Let me introduce you other (sic) humans running after the same fatuous ideals
Begging for recognition, assuming their irresponsibility and ready to muck you
So be the first one at the starting line, don't hesitate to shove them and welcome glory
