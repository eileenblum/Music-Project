Tired of roaming among lie-thirsty deceitful living creatures
Snubbing their stinking venomous acts like escaping pestilence
I can't hold down that nausea towards these lugubrious beings
Force-fed of vain hopes and waiting patiently their ends to come

Claustrophobic but confined in my own expended carnal prison
Doomed to endure seeing them smiling, breathing, crying and living
Watching them disguise their falsity and emphasize their sociality
To finally decide to betray the faithful ones they're supposed to appreciate

Willing to crush their bones with my own hands and leave them in misery
To make them pay their fallacious betrayals and striking disloyalty
Then lacerate their flesh and make them drink their own impure blood
To finally break their necks and leave their remains to famished worms

Las de toute cette accablante puanteur et hypocrisie
RÃ©signÃ© Ã  vivre dans un monde n'exaltant que lÃ¢chetÃ© et infamie
J'aimerais tant que cette rÃ©alitÃ© disparaisse dans l'effroi gÃ©nÃ©ral
Et que tout cette pathÃ©tique humanitÃ© se noie en un onirisme lachrymal
