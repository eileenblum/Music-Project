O painful life when will you decide to leave this weakened body to let my soul rest in peace
O grieving heart when will you finally cease to beat and stop the stream that is flowing through my veins

Disilusioned are my dreams
My will to leave has expired
Rotten are my last hopes
Please death come and make it end

Sorrow has replaced my joy
So ephemeral in my life
Abandonned is my spirit
Once so strong in my dreams

And loneliness is killing me
Nothing is worth for evermore
Now nothingness dwells in my mind
Letting me rule the ruins of my life

Buried now are my last hopes
Please death end this agony

Sorrow has replaced my joy
So ephemeral in my life
Abandonned is my spirit
Once so strong in my dreams

And loneliness is killing me
Nothing is worth for evermore
Now nothingness dwells in my mind
Letting me rule the ruins of my life

Je voudrais vider ce corps de tout ce sang
Et purger ainsi tous ces membres contaminÃ©s par la mÃ©lancolie
Toutefois ma fin est proche car mon esprit a sombrÃ© dans la folie

Oh funeste prophÃ©tie accomplis toi donc et dÃ©livre moi de cette vie
