Lies upon lies, eat that smile right off your backstabber's face
The crown of cloaked duplicity keeps on holding you straight
So eager to see you stumbling with your head hitting the rock
Cracking your skull, marking you deep with open wounds

Yet, tough and solid like a rock, you shan't surrender
No matter how painful it will be, you shall surpass yourself
The prize of glory will ever light the end of this gloomy tunnel
Tread upon the issues, embrace slander and rejoice in solitude

Betrayals upon betrayals, see yourself as an ignored demigod
Open the holy gates of your realm to your dreaded friends of hell
Hand feed them, promise titles of gentry to all the ones swearing
Celebrate and divide up the fresh remains of your jester's rotting

RÃ©gurgite les restes et prends soin de les distribuer aux scÃ©lÃ©rats
Contemple tous ces cafards s'en dÃ©lecter jusqu'Ã  atteindre satiÃ©tÃ©

Preaching the divine will, securing a seat among the canonized ones
Convert all the wicked ones, let them hang on every single word
Make them cleanse their dignity, let them guide your own downfall

Hold unto your host, engulf his life
Never give up, always drill further

Preaching the divine will, not securing a seat among the carbonized ones
Convert all the ratty ones, make themselves useful and sing praises
Make them cleanse their dignity, let them be outraged with your own downfall

You're just a leech, nothing but a hideous and arrogant parasite
You must be plucked out and crushed before you make your host lifeless
I will sully your memoirs and abandon your legacy to a bunch of vultures
Then I will desecrate your tomb by converting it into a popular urinal
