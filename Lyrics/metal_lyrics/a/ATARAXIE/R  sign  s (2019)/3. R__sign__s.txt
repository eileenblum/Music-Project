Waking up in the morning, everything looks exactly the same as yesterday
Once more the light hardly pierces that infected smog, making the air suffocating

Nothing has changed, we are the apathetic accomplices of a dying world
Infecting and draining, we have already scheduled our own eradication
How great we are at destroying, wasting and pointing fingers at self-created culprits

Now behold the grime as far as the eye can see

Only ruinous saviors are ruling, they were given the reins of our own destiny
They've derided our miserable beings, numerous but still truly insignificant
Armed with deceitful compassion, their aim is to reach the hearts of the weak

Unfortunate mankind, blame your innocence as it's your sole fault
Destitute children, all of them have received the prize of your cupidity
Poison and parasites have already been concealed in your own bread
Earth's flourishing nature will be soon reduced to nothingness

Tomorrow already tastes bitter, lessons will never be learnt
Debauched procreation, only fouled wine will be soon awaiting
Thirst for power, enroll all your people in the era of the wicked
Starvation, murders and slaughters will be soon regulating the norm

DÃ©goÃ»t profond pour ce monde sans avenir
J'exÃ¨cre cette race humaine sans devenir

Que notre terre rende grÃ¢ce Ã  la maladie ainsi qu'Ã  toutes ses Ã©pidÃ©mies
L'horreur ici-bas n'a de cesse d'exceller, n'accordons-lui aucune misÃ©ricorde
L'homme s'est engagÃ© dans la voie de la dÃ©mence, l'assumera-t-il un jour?
Se dessinent dÃ©jÃ  au loin les contours du mur dans lequel nous nous Ã©craserons
Car la nature reprendra tÃ´t ou tard son droit en nous rÃ©duisant tous Ã  nÃ©ant
Prions juste que cette fin ne soit pas sous le signe d'un nouveau dÃ©part
RÃ©signÃ©s! A jamais rÃ©signÃ©s! RÃ©signÃ©s! A jamais rÃ©signÃ©s!
