Like an orphan child
Like a castaway
I am lost inside
Your everlasting hate

Just hide in the dark
Every single day
It's so hard to make you understand

We are falling down
But my heart keeps telling me

Maybe it's how the story ends
Maybe it's time for me to go
Where I'll be free
We keep falling down

What I've ever done
What I've ever felt
I cannot hide
But I cannot tell

Just hide in the dark
Every single day
It's so hard to make you understand

We are falling down
But my heart keeps telling me

Maybe it's how the story ends
Maybe it's time for me to go
Where I'll be free
We keep falling down

Maybe it's how the story ends
Maybe it's time for me to go
Where I'll be free

Where I want to be

Maybe it's time
Maybe it's how

Oh, we keep falling down
