Breathing on my knees
Ashes from the culling
Fading in agony
All hope burns inside me

As I run
As I trip
As I fall

I'm calling out to you

As I cry
As I die
As I crawl

Tear me down	

Cleaving cutting deep
Bloodlust taking over
Straying reality
All life burns inside me

Burns inside me

As I run
As I trip
As I fall

I'm calling out to you

As I cry
As I die
As I crawl

Tear me down	

As I run
As I trip
As I fall

I'm calling out to you

As I cry
As I die
As I crawl

Tear me down
