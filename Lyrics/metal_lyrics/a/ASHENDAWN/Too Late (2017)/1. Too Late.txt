Drag me to the haze
In the dead of the night
To another day
To another time
Take me to the place
Where I can deny
All I've ever been
All that I should be

But it is so hard to recall
When it's only pain all that I feel
And it hurts so bad to recall
I am confined inside

Too late to fight for what's right
I'm fading into the dark

Running dead and blind
Through the endless dark
Never ending plight
Everlasting blight
Memories arise
From another time
Of what I have been
Of what I should be

But it is so hard to recall
When it's only pain all that I feel
And it hurts so bad to recall
I am dying inside

Too late to fight for what's right
I'm fading into the dark

What does not kill you only makes you die a little slower
But darker times have fallen on other shattered lives
And it's so easy to see clear through unbroken soul eyes
But harder is the truth that lives in a scarred heart

Too late to fight for what's right
I'm fading into the dark

Take me into the light
I fade into the dark
