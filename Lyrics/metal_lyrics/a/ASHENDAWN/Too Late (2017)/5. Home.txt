Cold dead eyes
Hiding
Blinded
Cold dead eyes
Prying
Finding

Let the heavy burden fall
Down on me
Down on me

Let the heavy burden fall
Down on me
Down on me

'Cause I won't be there
To save you now
Finally
Must everyone stand alone?

The subtle sign of violence
That you never saw
Is tearing us down

I'm falling apart
Broken and on my knees
Take me where I want to be
Take me home

Cold dead eyes
Hiding
Writhing
Cold dead eyes
Prying
Finding

Let the heavy burden fall
Down on me
Down on me

Let the heavy burden fall
Down on me
Down on me

'Cause I won't be there
To save you now
Finally
Must everyone stand alone?

The subtle sign of violence
That you never saw
Is tearing us down

I'm falling apart
Broken and on my knees
Take me where I want to be
Take me home

'Cause I won't be there
To save you now
Finally
Must everyone stand alone?

The subtle sign of violence
That you never saw
It's over now

I'm broken and on my knees
Take me where I want to be
Take me home

I'm broken and on my knees
Take me where I want to be
Take me home
