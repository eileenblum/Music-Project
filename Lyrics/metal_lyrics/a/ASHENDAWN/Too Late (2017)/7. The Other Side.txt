I am lost in time
All alone
I can't take it anymore
All the light
Fades from your eyes

Take me on a ride
Take me to the light
Take me away
My heart is on the line
I can't deny
It's what I feel

Don't be long

I've tried so hard to let it go
All the world is fading
In the eyes of a broken heart
So take me to the other side

Take me to the other side

On and on
Dead and gone
I can't take this anymore
All the world
Dead in your eyes

Take me on a ride
Take me to the light
Take me away
My life is on the line
I can't deny
It's what I feel

Don't be long

I've tried so hard to let it go
All the world is burning
In the eyes of a broken heart
So take me to the other side

The other side

'Cause I've tried so hard to let it go
Take me all the way
Take me down with you
So take me to the other side

Take me to the other side

To the other side
The other side
