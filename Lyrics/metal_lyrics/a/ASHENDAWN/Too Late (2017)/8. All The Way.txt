It feels like the past still clings to me
It haunts me in every place I see
Just take me where I belong
Is there anywhere I belong?

Take me all the way
I want to break

Broken all the pieces of my soul
Stay with me, don't let me fall
You just take the world away
Stay with me until the end

I feel so cold among the rain
But there's still a fire so deep within
Just take me where I belong
There's nowhere I can belong

Take me all the way
I want to break
Take me all the way
I need to break

Broken all the pieces of my soul
Stay with me, don't let me fall
You just take the world away
Stay with me until the end

Take me all the way
I want to break free

I need to break free
