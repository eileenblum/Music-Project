You take
You fake
You break

You lie still
Your honesty

Every single time
Every single day

You lie still

With every step that I take
Each time is harder the fall
I stumble, I crumble
Curled up on the ground

But when the lights are gone
When there's nowhere to go
I will finally be
I will finally see

So take me away
From all that was
From all that'll come to be
I'll break away right to the place I want to be
So far away
From all you are
From all you've done to me
I'll break away, don't ever, never come back to me

With every battle I fought
Overcome all fears
But my only wish
Could the end be near?

When the pain is gone
When all the time is done
I will finally be
I will finally see

So take me away
From all that was
From all that'll come to be
I'll break away right to the place I want to be
So far away
From all you are
From all you've done to me
I'll break away, don't ever, never come back to me

Oh, no

So take me away
From all that was
From all that'll come to be
I'll break away right to the place I want to be
So far away
From all you are
From all you've done to me
I'll break away, don't ever, never come back to me
