Strung again
Noose up high
Body's going down, down, down
I won't give up without a fight
What has become of you?

On and on
On and on it goes
On and on
I'm fighting this curse

Someday
I swear I'll take myself back from your hands
Someday
I swear I'll pay you back for every tear you stole from me

Tied again
Stake's on fire
Flames are going high, high, high
I won't back down
I won't try to find
A way back into you

On and on
On and on it goes
On and on
I'm fighting this curse

A curse
A burden

Someday
I swear I'll take myself back from your hands
Someday
I swear I'll pay you back for every beat I missed
And now I keep finding you in every place, in every face
Somehow I must break out
I will not drown in my tears

Forever lost
Broken dreams
Broken paths
Broken life

Forsaken
For eternity

On and on
On and on it goes
On and on
I'm fighting this curse

It kills me
Destroys me
But I'll find the way
Someday

Someday
I swear I'll take myself back from your hands
Someday
I swear I'll pay you back for every tear you stole from me
Someday
I swear I will get back every beat I missed
And now I keep finding you in every place, in every face
Somehow I must break out
I will not drown in my tears
