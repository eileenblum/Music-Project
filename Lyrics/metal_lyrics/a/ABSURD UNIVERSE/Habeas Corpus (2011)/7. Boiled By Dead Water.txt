Boiled by dead water
Scurvy, rotten mass
Water infected by sickness
and slave body flesh

The bodies are sick,
beheaded and maimed
Purified sick bones,
now their lives are tamed

Eruption of organs
A pool of iniquity
These may be the lessons of malignancy

Malignancy, eruption of organs
Malignancy, boiled and dead
Malignancy, created by schism
Boiled by dead-water and without a head
