In a time when the oceans were ours,
the water turned into red
To create new standards,
we killed everything on ours paths

Extremely violent and armed with ships
Death gave them salvation
Preparing a deadly crusade,
to start new world domination

A deadly future
People must work till death
On their beloved ground,
they will never be fed

Corporal punishment
Blood floods everywhere
Broken bones, stab wounds and pain
Do you think they care?

[Refrain]

Red water, the punishment you deserve
Red water, blood floods on the earth
Red water, for the dominator you have to serve
Red water, the day of your rebirth
