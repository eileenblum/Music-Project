Polished and prepared
This stone with its sharp hooks
Especially made for your skull
Soon we will see how it looks

Beaten from above
Until the bone will crack
Explosion of the brains
Putrid remnants are left

Your skull will be bashed
Resulting in a mount of trash
Slave-brains lie on the ground
and more maltreated flesh

Your skull will be chiseled
with this special stone
A particular sound
Skull-burst is the right tone

An army of executioners,
is awaiting your death
This special piece of rock
is meant for your head

[Refrain]

A stone for your skull
Because life is rough
A stone for your skull
A stone... made with love
