Evil creatures armed with death and plagues
In a place of hate and absurd delusion
A time of evolution that makes kill-bots,
raised in chemical hazard pollution

A deadly crusade, to obey his deadly appearance
Extremely violent, armed with chemicals and radiation
Without compassion, they fight a war to win
Death gives them salvation and New World Domination

New World Domination
Forgotten... desecration
New World Domination

In a world, where darkness will be forever,
a place of frozen seas, acid-lakes and rivers of oil
Cyborg killing machines are ready to serve death
Bodies are left-over for mechanic vultures to spoil

Full of hate and afraid of what the lord demands,
they kill everything on their paths with their internal hate
Their beloved place became a dark desolated landscape
That's what the future squad has made

New World Domination
Forgotten... desecration
New World Domination
