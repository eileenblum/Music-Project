A statue of fear
to impress the captivated.
No sign of compassion
Now hope is slowly fading

In white-collars vogue
and with weapons to hurt.
They deliver punishment,
because the blood must squirt

Cruel techniques
used to cut off hands.
Liberty only comes,
when their life will end

Immense suffering,
is what they are waiting for.
A beating with hooks,
a nice recipe for... the blood collector

There is only one goal
That is creating a mash
By causing awful pain,
they create remainders of flesh

[Refrain]

Bones for breakfast
Slave skins for dinner
With juicy blood for last
Burned on coal for the dinner

The flesh collector
The blood collector
