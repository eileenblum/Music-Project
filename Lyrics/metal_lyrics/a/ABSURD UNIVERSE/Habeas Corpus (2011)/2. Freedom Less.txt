Recovering the land overseas,
submitted with guns and big ships.
A continent over-ruled by assassination
A sin God's rules forbid

An inferior race is changed
Nevermore being free
Ships overflowing with slaves
Dutch crusaders rule the sea

A journey to a new world
Maltreatment and hard work is waiting
Punishment, by torture with lashes,
is what executioner is stating

There is war on the seas,
to dominate and raise the flag.
Pre-dominating other people,
who for their life must beg

[Refrain]

Freedom less, bow for them on your knees
Sickness, domination overseas
Inferior, so worthless and abused
Freedom less, condemned to new diseases
