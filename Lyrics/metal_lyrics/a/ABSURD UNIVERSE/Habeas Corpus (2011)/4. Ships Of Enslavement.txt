Packed up in dark sheds, with blood on their wrists
Attrition takes control

The beating of the drum, goes faster and faster
The slave traders are on patrol

At a sign of fatigue, when weakness shows itself,
they must act very hard

Beaten to the bone
The have no choice, then to obey the guard

The ships of enslavement conquer the world
and leave trails of blood behind

Without any daylight
They must row their entire lives
Until their eyes go blind

Through their feet are nails and chains around their necks
They are less than vermin

Twenty hours a day
Continuous exploitation of bodies that bear no longer skin

[Refrain]

Ships of enslavement
Ships of enslavement
Conquer the world
Only flesh will be spend
