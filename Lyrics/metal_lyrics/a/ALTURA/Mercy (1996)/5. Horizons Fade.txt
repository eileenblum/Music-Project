Here we stand
Alone and so afraid
The pallid lights
Drift away

I've heard that time will heal the wounds
Still the wounds are all I have
In time, we'll find it only
It only fades away

I'll embrace the cold
The apprehension that holds me

Horizons fade
Into forever
As the memories
Echo your name

In remembrance, secured assurance
Never questioned
Oh, until the opaque eyes
Dimmed and turned
So cold and gray, disillusioned
I am alone

While beaten down, I'll stand
Crying out for the shelter of your smile

Is it all
An emotion to face
Or is it all
Embracing a need

Horizons fade
Into forever
As the memories
Echo your name

Horizon's fade
Into each other
Out of reach
And so far away
