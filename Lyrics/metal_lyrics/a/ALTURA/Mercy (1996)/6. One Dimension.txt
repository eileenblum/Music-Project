Step by step and further in
Walking blind in common stride
Like they told you

All along afraid to ask
A doubting mind masked by pride
The shadows hold the truth

When will you see
The words voice the passion

In one dimension
You'll wait
Holding back the fears
Once more in vain
In one dimension
Lost

A choice made in love
Or a choice made in words
On the surface the same
Wear the healing hand
Or wear a healing mind
In a white lie confession
Blue eyes, they will see
The word's aren't the passion

In one dimension
You'll wait
Holding back the fears
Once more in vain
In one dimension
Lost

I lost blind faith when it lost
The tone of sincerity
I felt the voice, I suppressed
In the name of belonging

And you will count the days
By regret, as faith lies bleeding
And you'll watch
As the years turn into a lifetime

In one dimension
You'll wait
Holding back the fears
Once more in vain
In one dimension
Lost

In faith . . .
Or just a name

Life's the living word
Learning, solace is the shelter
Life's the living word
Learning, solace is the shelter

All the while, faces burn
The ones you've known must learn
Learn to feel, learn to ask
It's a part of knowing

In one dimension
You'll wait
Holding back the fears
Once more in vain
Holding the candle alone
