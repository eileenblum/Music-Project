Waiting for the voices of reason
I can't see but to close the door

Open the new one
And walk towards the edge
Freedom in this one
So few'll understand

Ashes of passion
Once moved us all
A view we all fashion
And follow the same

Lonely's never far away
I remember its face
I vowed to restrain the gray
As I saw past their empty stare

One by one
We'll follow and fade away
One by one
Burned by regret

Waiting for the voices of reason
And I don't feel the need anymore

All I believed in was empty in promise
The shame found in these eyes
I've learned to wear

Lying awake and drowning in fear
It's part of the role
That I've learned to live

One by one
We'll follow and fade away
One by one
Burned by regret
