I felt the need this morning
To try this again
As I woke in a haze of
Helplessness

Looking back for a reason
To understand
How desire so inspiring
Drifts away

I've heard that life's a stream of regrets
I understand
I've seen how youth can steadily regress
As the night rolls in

Alternate lines
Bound to forever
Perspectives divide
Into their own lines

Sketching a scene within its fragile frame
A face that looks familiar, once a part of me
Reaching out towards the memories
Out of reach

I've heard that life's a stream of regrets
I understand
I've seen how youth can steadily regress
As the night rolls in

Alternate lines
Bound to forever
Perspectives divide
Into their own lines
