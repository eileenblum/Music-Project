I came to watch the water rise
Then saw the passion fall
A child born through these eyes
Must set the stride alone
The scars became our own

Rage incited by rage
Drowning out every choice
Alone

Rage in silence has come to be
Reflections of the anger in me
Emotional identity
A part of what I need to feel

Drifting lifeless, it feeds the trend
These wounds define us, and leave me here
The warmth confided within your hands
Is so enduring, just like despair
Afraid to wonder why
Hopeless vision, I walk alone

Where was I on the day my father died
These lessons get blurred all along
How can I give meaning to my life
When I don't know exactly where it leads

I long for the solace that somehow betrayed us
Left me frustrated and alone
With every empty promise the scars will define us
I closed my eyes again

Rage incited by rage
Drowning out every choice
That remains within this
Hate incited by hate
Drowning out every voice
That remains within this
