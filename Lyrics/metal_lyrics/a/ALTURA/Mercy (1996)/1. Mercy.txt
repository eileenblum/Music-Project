I remember the words you said
I could never
Never erase them

More than an impulse
That I have
So much more than
Anger and rage

Being caught in the dream sometimes
Leaves compassion constrained

As the clock slows down
I would wait for this to fall
To the feet of your guilt again

Mercy, falls from your eyes
Giving truth to this
Observance, I've come to realize
Leads to it all

I felt so empty
And grew tired of pretending
Turning angry
As the rage breathes in me

Burn pages burn
Like lessons I've learned
That only lead to bitterness
It's getting hard to remain
Detached from the pain
I can turn no more from this

Water rise above my head
Take me away
Away from this

More than an impulse
That I have
So much more than
Anger and rage

Being caught in the dream sometimes
Leaves compassion constrained

As the clock slows down
I would wait for this to fall
To the feet of your guilt again

Mercy, falls from your eyes
Giving truth to this
Observance, I've come to realize
Leads to it all
