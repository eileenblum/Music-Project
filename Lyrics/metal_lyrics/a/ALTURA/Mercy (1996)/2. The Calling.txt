Selectively blind
We draw the line
Between sympathy
And what we choose to believe

Thoughtless again
The burden that we bare
Ignore guilty eyes
All is learned in refrain
I feel there is
something that I must do
In a world whose eye's have grown cold
With no hands bound

I'll make a promise
To wait for the new
Vision that's calling me
Memories in the distance
Brought into view
Voices are calling me

A passionless voice
Lost in the rain
Reflections of out lives
In an emotionless face

A child is born in rage
All carried in vain
Your guilty eyes
Are all that remain

I said that I'd never fall
Into the trance of delusion's rage
Oh father I swear

I'll make a promise
To wait for the new
Visions are calling me
Memories in the distance
Brought into view
Voices are calling me
