This inside my head
Paint my head as red
Leave myself in pain
Leave me no strength

I might die here - weak as you are
This is so clear - cheap as you are
This is my fear
I might die here

Save me (spare me)

Growing
Coward
Knowing
Nothing

Hurts so deep inside
Tears roll down my eyes
Mirror laughs at me
I'm so broke within
Who ever told you lies?
