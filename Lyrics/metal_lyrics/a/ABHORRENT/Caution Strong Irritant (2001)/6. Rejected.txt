Breath
Don't let me breath
Until I'm still alive
Become, the scum
The fracture in

Bleed
You let me bleed
You let me see
The shit, the things
I'm within

Bend yourself
Break you down
Dumb
Fuck it all

Rejected
No fame, no life, no love no better life
Rejected

Breed
I'm born and breed
Until I'm not alive
You beat, me down
My fracture's in

Weep
You make me weep
You make me freak
My spine, my proud, my dick
