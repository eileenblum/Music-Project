We reached into the obscure
To change the course of the world

Now I'm become death, destroyer of worlds

At once the birth of a sun
Beauty and horror as one
A triumph for knowledge but yet what have we gained?
A pathway to peace or the door to the world's pain?

Batter my heart three personed god
In Trinity we altered the world

Now I'm become death, destroyer of worlds
