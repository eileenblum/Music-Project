This darkened world is collapsing on me
I've fought to hold it at bay but my back is breaking
Four candles burn in the dark
And they're all that's guiding me

I fear the choice that lie before me
I fear I have not the strength to return from Hell's path
They hold the key to the goodness in me
Four candles burn through the black
And they're all that's saving me

And should the shadows claim me
To walk the halls of nevermore
My heart with you remaining
Undying love

And should the shadows claim me
To walk the halls of nevermore
My heart with you remaining
Undying love

Undying love
