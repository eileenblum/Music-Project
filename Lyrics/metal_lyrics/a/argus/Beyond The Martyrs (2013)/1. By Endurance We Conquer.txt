1914, in voyage from England
28 cast their fear to the gods
Poised to conquer the frost covered base of the Earth
At 6 months ensnared in a solid sea prison
Men and ship are beset on all sides
Abandon all hope - what the ice gets it keeps for its own

To the lifeboat, the James Caird, went six men
For 17 days facing Poseidonâs wrath
On the shores of South Georgia they settled at last
Now to traverse the hazardous landscape
Over mountains and glaciers theyâd fight
Into Stromness where hope was now finally in sight

So far away - we lost no faith â in unity, in bravery, in honor
As one weâd live, as one weâd die and by endurance we conquered

1916 on August the 30
28 reunited again
Against all the odds they had outrun the cold clutch of death

So far away - we lost no faith â in unity, in bravery, in honor
As one weâd live, as one weâd die and by endurance we conquered
