The hands of time are bleeding
Drawing the hours from me
This once vital heart no longer beats
Darkness I do beseech you
Obscure this world from me
For these forlorn eyes wish not to see

Blind my eyes
Blind my heart

Dreams that once fed my spirit
As dust crumble in my hands
Hopeless I fall a broken man
Darkness I do entreat you
Obscure the light for me
It's far out of reach and tortures me

Blind my eyes
Blind my heart

Dark, dark blind my eyes, dark blind my heart, take all this pain from me
Dark, dark blind my eyes, dark blind my heart, take all this pain from me
Dark, dark blind my eyes, dark blind my heart, take all this pain from me
Dark, dark blind my eyes, dark blind my heart, take all this pain from me
