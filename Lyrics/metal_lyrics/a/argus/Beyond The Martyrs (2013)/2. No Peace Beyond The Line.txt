What measure a man's worth
When honor steals away and break from his beliefs?
Left clutching at nothing
No handholds as he falls into the grasp of grief

There is no peace, there is no peace, there is no peace

To crawl as a blind man
As upon shards of glass, this field of broken faith
Each cut scars forever
Remembrance of the Soul who feared not darker days

There is no peace, there is no peace, there is no peace

There is no, there is no, there is no peace beyond the line
There is no, there is no, there is no peace beyond the line
There is no, there is no, there is no peace beyond the line
There is no, there is no, there is no peace beyond the line
