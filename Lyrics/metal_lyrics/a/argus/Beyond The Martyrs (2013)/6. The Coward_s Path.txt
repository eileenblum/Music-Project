Baptized in pity's robes I've failed to dam the rising tide of fear
Unmoving and unmoved your words of hope have fallen on deaf ears

I'll burn our bridge behind to ash
Alone I seek the coward's path

Repelled by outstretched arms, that seek to lift me up and pull me in
And in futility they learn to loose the soul that pushes against them

I'll burn our bridge behind to ash
Alone I seek the coward's path

Deep seated origins, the need for isolation, the need to run away
To hide eternally to draw the shades on painful hurt to keep the truth at bay
To shroud myself in this, adorned in resignation, inside a silent shell
To shroud myself in this, in this my purgatory, in this my living hell

I can't let you in
