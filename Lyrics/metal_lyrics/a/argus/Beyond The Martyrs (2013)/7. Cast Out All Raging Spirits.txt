Hell â hear the coming storm â your heart seething
The walls quickly closing in â and you're paralyzed
No return to simpler times â only forward
No path forward through the past â nor through anger

Cast out all raging spirits tonight
Cast out all demons lurking inside

Regret â it wil eat away â at life's marrow
Your blood poisoned now with bitterness â it's your prison
No one else will halt your fall â you must break it
No one else will hold your heart - you must heal it

Cast out all raging spirits tonight
Cast out all demons lurking inside

Absolution - exorcism of the self
Dissolution - of the hell in which you dwell
