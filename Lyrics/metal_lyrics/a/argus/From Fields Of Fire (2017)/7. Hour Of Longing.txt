You were the rock on which I learned
Your wisened words would anchor me
In losing you I lost part of my soul
I felt deathly alone

Sometimes in the stillness I can hear your voice
Reaching out to me across the years

In the grips of anxiety
Cold flush of panic consumes me
Collapsed and trembling in pieces I fall
As into anguish I'm drawn

Sometimes in the stillness I can hear your voice
Reaching out to me across the years
And in my hour of longing I can feel your light
Giving me the strength to fight my fears

I hear your voice - I hear you calling
I hear your voice - in my hour of longing

[Guitar solo: Mucio]

Sometimes in the stillness I can hear your voice
Reaching out to me across the years
And in my hour of longing I can feel your light
Giving me the strength to fight my fears

I hear your voice
I hear your voice
