[Guitar solo: Watson]

Circle of fire - the final test along this road
To brave the flames there must be peace within the soul

Our journey here - a proving ground where there's no rest
To rise from fields of fire, to reconcile all regrets

[Guitar solo: Mucio]

Leave all the tears and the pain
To bring your soul peace once again
Leave all the tears and the pain

Leave all the tears and the pain
To walk into light once again
Leave all the tears and the pain
