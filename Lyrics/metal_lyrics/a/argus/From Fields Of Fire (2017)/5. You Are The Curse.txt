Beset by waves of misfortune
In pity you lie
Damning the world that surrounds
For your plight

Looking not to the evils
You've unleashed in your time
Now the cold winds of consequence bite

As all you've loved and all you've dreamed to ruin falls

Your fate reversed
Dark tidings' source
You are the curse
Your fate reversed
Dark tidings' source
You are the curse

Feeling the winds turn against you
For no reason or rhyme
Now take a good look deep inside

Consider the oaths that you've cast into flame
Consider your actions that brought only pain
And now dare to question these turning tides

As all you've loved and all you've dreamed to ruin falls

Your fate reversed
Dark tidings' source
You are the curse
Your fate reversed
Dark tidings' source
You are the curse

Your fate reversed
Dark tidings' source
You are the curse
Your fate reversed
Dark tidings' source
You are the curse
