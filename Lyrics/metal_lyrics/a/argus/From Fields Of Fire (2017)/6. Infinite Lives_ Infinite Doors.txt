"Freedom!" my spirit did cry
Bound by these mortal shackles no longer
Though in great I did approach these darkened portals of mystery
I now cry, "Freedom!"

Infinite lives, infinite doors
All that's to be has been before
Each breath, each fluttered eye
In parallel our never-ending lives
Infinite lives, infinite doors

[Guitar solo: Mucio]

Time and space melt and merge as one
The gates of transcending open to me
To live again
The truth that I've long sought laid out before me - before my eyes

Infinite lives, infinite doors
All that's to be has been before
Each breath, each fluttered eye
In parallel our never-ending lives
Infinite lives, infinite doors

Our lives as dreams - carry on when the body's asleep
Our lives as dreams - carry on when the body's at peace

[Guitar solo: Watson]
[Guitar solo: Mucio]

Far beyond the end of your life
Far beyond the end there is no end
Far beyond the end of your life
Far beyond the end you live again
