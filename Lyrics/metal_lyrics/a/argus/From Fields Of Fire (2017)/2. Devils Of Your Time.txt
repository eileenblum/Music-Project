Striking with swiftness and fury
An unbidden start in the dark
An unrestrained evil piercing serenity's heart
A fear that envelops you wholly
Contracting, constricting your breath
Its hands 'round your throat as you wonder if this is the end

Lies, lies - whispered deceits inside your mind
Rise, rise - against the devils of your time

Wracked by convulsions of hellfire
Yet shivering and drenched as by ice
Submerged in fear, suspended in dread, paralyzed
A descent into madness
A divergence from all that is true
Spit into the halls of confusion by engines of doom

Lies, lies - whispered deceits inside your mind
Rise, rise - against the devils of your time
Lies, lies - whispered deceits inside your mind
Rise, rise - against the devils of your time

Rise against the devils of your time
Rise against panic's crippling lies

[Guitar solo: Watson]

Fight against your fear!
Fight against your fear!
