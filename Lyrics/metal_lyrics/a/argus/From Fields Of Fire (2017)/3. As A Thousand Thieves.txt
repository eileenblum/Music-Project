I have crossed unto the shadows
I have sinned against my own
When life began to fold in on me
I turned my back and disavowed my home

Sinned against my own

Leaving you a thousand pieces
A wreckage of your hopes and dreams
You fought you would hold them forever
Yet I stole each as a thousand thieves

Sinned against my own
As a thousand thieves your dreams I stole

A million times or maybe more
I must have run it through my head
The light I gathered close
Was never worth the pain I sowed

There's no way to repay all I stole from you
There's no hell deep enough to pay the penance due

[Guitar solo: Watson]

What hell awaits me? What hell awaits me?
A million times or maybe more
I must have run it through my head
The light I gathered close
Was never worth the pain I sowed

Sinned against my own
As a thousand thieves your dreams I stole
