At eventide the sun set on our love
Into stillness you passed to the peace of beyond

Through my soul does rage I must hold it close
Though inside I break, I won't break my vow
The love that you gave belonged not to me
I won't twice break the heart of they who now grieve

Longingly, mournfully
To dark confined
In solitude, in silence I cry

[Guitar solo: Watson]

Memories flash, memories flood, memories washing over me
Never to touch, never to hold, never again your face to see
Never to kiss, kiss you goodbye - that path is blocked for me

Through my soul does rage I must hold it close
Though inside I break, I won't break my vow
The love that you gave belonged not to me
I won't break the heart of they who believed
Alone I must suffer
I've no right to grieve
