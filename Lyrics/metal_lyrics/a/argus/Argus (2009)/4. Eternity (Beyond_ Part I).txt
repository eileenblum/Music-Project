Crossing dark horizons
Taking leave of these turbulent shores
Through quietus bestowed the keys to this life's final door

Receive me now
In halls of stars
Enfold my soul
In your waiting arms

Follow, now the heartsong
The beloved who lie just ahead
What death hath divided, now let it unite once again

Receive me now
In halls of stars
Enfold my soul
In your loving arms

[Solo - Jason]
