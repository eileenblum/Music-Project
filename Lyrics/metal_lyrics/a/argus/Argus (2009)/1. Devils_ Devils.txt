I'm a phantom, my demeanor...facade
Broken smile speaks the truth of my soul
I am envy, I delight when you fall
I am malice, wishing ill on the world

Reflected Soul
A mirror though my eyes
Devils, Devils arise !

I am wicked with deceit in my heart
An imposter who will lie in your arms
I am selfish, operating through greed
Unrepentant in the quest of my dreams

Reflected Soul
A mirror though my eyes
Devils, Devils arise ! [2x]

[1st solo - Jason]
[2nd solo - Jason]

Reflected Soul
A mirror though my eyes
Devils, Devils arise !
Reflected Soul
A mirror though my eyes
Black hearted  Devils arise !
