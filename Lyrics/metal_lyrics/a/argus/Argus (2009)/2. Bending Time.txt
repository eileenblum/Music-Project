Welcome to madness
Here inside of your mind where the soul never rests
A place where we relive the pain of regret

You feel you can reach it
If you just close your eyes you can touch all the scars
But as you get closer you grow ever far

One deep breath - cast your self to the winds of your past
As you soar through your mind
Bending time

I've often felt it
I could roll back the minutes and right every wrong
The ill that I've spoken, the hurt that I've caused

To me it's tragic
When the good in my life somehow fades from my mind
While the wounds of transgression reopen
Time after time after time

One deep breath - cast your self to the winds of your past
As you soar through your mind
Bending time.....Bending time

[Solo - Jason]

You can't return  to times now long past 
You'll never change
The sins of your past

[Solo - Mike]
[Solo - Jason]
