We rise, lift our heads up to the skies
This day we anointed shall be saved
Our lord soon arrives the prophet says
We pray - on our knees proclaim our faith

[Solo - Jason]

In white, we ascend the highest hill
Our lives, here on Earth we've left behind
We wait - in the soil we now lay
We pray - to our Lord proclaim our faith

Thy kingdom will come, so let it be done
We wish to ascend the gates of Zion
But wait...as night melts to dawn
Can it be we were wrong?
God does not come!

[Solo - Jason]
[Solo - Jason]

Now we climb from our graves 
Return to the lives that we left behind
Our faith, lying in tatters, fallen and shattered
The lesson learned?
That none shall know the hour!

[Solo - Jason]
