Lonely road, this twisted path that leads out of despair
Unending struggle to reconcile with grief and carry on
The will seeks to submit, the heart to bleed all love away
The soul to lose all faith

Rise...Looking not to surrender
Embrace the hell, self-redeemer

From darkness...light, knowledge from pain
For each ounce of suffering, experience gained
From darkness...light, solace from pain
We must walk through the shadows to be whole again

Lonely road, a path beset by specters of the past
Each haunted doorway you open leading deeper down inside
Fear builds upon fear, each level must be overcome
To learn to breathe again

Rise...Looking not to surrender
Embrace the hell, self-redeemer

From darkness...light, knowledge from pain
For each ounce of suffering, experience gained
From darkness...light, solace from pain
We must walk through the shadows to be whole again
