[Intro - John Gallo]

Through divinity I dared to raise up Hell's minions to me
For four years and twenty as servants we lay at your feet!
The price for such power, my soul hath I granted in blood
The stars move, the time runs, the clock strikes for 
Faustus we come!

The wages of sin is death
The wages of sin is death

My God look not so fierce upon me, let me breathe awhile
Come not thou adders and serpents that Heaven reviles
Faustus, what weeps thou? Tis too late! Farewell!
Fool that will laugh upon Earth surely must weep in Hell!

The wages of sin is death
The wages of sin is death

Rend him asunder!
Beat him from one wall to the other!
Leave no piece of his body whole!
TO PERDITION WE CARRY HIS SOUL!

We pray
For the soul of the cursed, for the soul of the damned we pray
We pray
For the soul of the cursed, for the soul of the damned we pray
