Through divinity I dared to raise up Hell's minions to me
For four years and twenty as servants we lay at your feet
The price for such power, my soul hath I granted in blood
The stars move, the time runs, the clock strikes, for Faustus we come

The wages of sin is death

My God look not so fierce upon me, let me breathe awhile
Come not thou adders and serpents that heaven reviles
Faustus what weepst thou? Tis too late farewell
Fools that will laugh upon earth, surely must weep in Hell

The wages of sin is death

Rend him asunder, beat him from one wall to the other
Leave no piece of his body whole, to perdition we carry his soul

We pray for the soul of the cursed
For the soul of the damned we pray
