My blood's been thinned down too many times
It's wise to leave things be, Don't stir up old grief

Let Sleeping Dogs lie, tonight, or suffer

The mountain tends to call me back within it's stately borders
You've got a friend in oblivion, don't be mistaken, these hills have eyes
They'll cut you down to size, cut you right down to size
Let Sleeping Dogs lie

There is no escape from here, as funny as it is tragic, this place is magnetic

Let Sleeping Dogs lie, tonight, or suffer
