Welcome to madness, here inside of your mind where the soul never rests
A place where we relive the pain of regret, you feel you can reach it
If you just close your eyes you can touch all the scars, but as you get closer they grow ever far

One deep breath, cast your soul to the winds of your past
As you soar through your mind, Bending Time

I've often felt it, I could roll back the minutes and right every wrong
The ill that I've spoken the hurt that I've caused
To me it's tragic, when the good in my life somehow fades from my mind
While wounds of transgressions reopen time after time

One deep breath, cast your soul to the winds of your past
As you soar through your mind, Bending Time
