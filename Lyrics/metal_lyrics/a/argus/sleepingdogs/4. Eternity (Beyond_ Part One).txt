Crossing dark horizons, taking leave of these turbulent shores
By quietus bestowed the key to this life's final door

Receive me now, in halls of starts
Enfold my soul, in your waiting arms

Follow now the heartsong, of the loved ones who lie just ahead
What death hath divided now, let it unite once again

Receive me now, in halls of starts
Enfold my soul, in your loving arms
