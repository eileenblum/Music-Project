Death hath no conscience
When touching her hand to our heart
And show not compassion nor pity
When working her art
In silence in secrecy
Winding her way to our door
She comes uninvited
And ransacks all the we life for

So where is the light?
Is any hope here?
We see only back
We feel only fear

Death hath no mercy
When tearing out of all our hearts
Nor will she show fairness
in sundering families apart
The good here among us
Too young and too soon have been called
Yet the wicked will flourish
And outlast the best of us all

So where is the light?
Is any hope here?
We see only back
We feel only fear

So where is the light?
Is any hope here?
We see only darkness
We feel only fear

There is no light
Death Hath No Conscience there is only black
There is no light
Death Hath No Conscience there is only black
There is no light
Death Hath No Conscience there is only black
There is no light
Death Hath No Conscience
