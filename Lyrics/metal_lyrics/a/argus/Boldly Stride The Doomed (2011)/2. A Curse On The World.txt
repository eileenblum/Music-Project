Black - and so enters night, the dawning of evil
A darkness descending, the borders of hope are obscured
Lost - we've run from the light, our iniquity knows no end
As one drawn to fire out pathway to pain is assured

There's a curse on the world - Forward to Hell

Born corrupt - we are raised up in sin to know no moral bounds
Avarice deified, so dies the virtuous man
Silence - we turn a deaf ear as our brothers wretch in pain
Eyes blind to the carnage we look past the blood on our hands

There's a curse on the world - Forward to Hell, Forward to Hell

Black - and so enters night, the dawning of evil
A darkness descending, the borders of hope are obscured

There's a curse on the world - Forward to Hell
There's a curse on the world - Forward to Hell, Forward to Hell
