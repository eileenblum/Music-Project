Sleep now, oh my brother - let my voice now be thy guide
As you transcend earthly ties
Rise now, wake in slumber - what you see is not unreal
It is valid, it is true

For through dreams I have seen lives untold
And through dreams I have seen my own soul

In your mind parallel lives form the ladder you must climb
If you wish to realize
That locked doors of perception can be opened if you dare
Lay the universe open bare

For through dreams I have seen lives untold
And through dreams I have seen my own soul

Darkness...falling...summoning
Darkness...calling...calling me
Darkness...calling...calling me

Threadbare is the veil that separates the lives that bind
For those who wish to pass
Wake now, oh my brother, rise again a wiser man
You have lived beyond this time

For through dreams I have seen lives untold
And through dreams I have seen my own soul
