Heedless to the stars sinister alignment
Omens thus arrayed, willful eyes blinded

Each and every step - one step further from sanity 
Boldly Stride the Doomed - toward the jaws of calamity

They are the damned!

Heedless to the pleas of those who passed before them
Wisdom thus ignored, to extinction condemned 

Each and every step - one step further from sanity 
Boldly Stride the Doomed - toward the jaws of calamity

They are the damned
They are the damned
They are the damned!
