We till this soil of plaques 
Harrow discordant tongues of the depraved
We invoke the Gods of spite
Blessed be the wellspring of sorrows in our lives

Silver light fades, the empress dies

Stark remnants of our toils
Gaunt apparitions adrift in bleak turmoil
Moribund our kindred lie
Resolved to unfathomed seclusion for all time

Silver light fades, the scion wakes, the empress dies

Nomadic wind, find no peace, a pariah to the dawn
Monster cast out to the wastes, through dark prism soul divides
Nomadic wind, find no peace, a pariah to the dawn
Monster cast out, out to the wastes, through dark prism soul divides
