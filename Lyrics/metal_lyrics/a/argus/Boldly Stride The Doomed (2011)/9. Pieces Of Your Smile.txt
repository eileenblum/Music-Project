How is it that from beauty I have derived a type of unloveliness?
You - beauty, grace, boundless life's energy
And I - inward drawn, shrouded in misery

You - she of joy, stricken by fate's cruel plans
Victimized body and mind with rot and deathlike trance

I - downward lost in monomania
My mind transfixed for hours and hours upon the insignificant

And there you stood before my eyes, your beauty all but gone
Yet in the smile you revealed, I found the objects of my love
They said you left this world at dawn to tread the paths of death
And in your chambers you're prepared to enter final rest
And in my grief as my mind reeled you seemed as though alive
Driven away by lunacy I swear I saw you smile

Your smile no longer to be seen
Your smile's been taken away from me
Your smile no longer to be seen
Your smile's been taken away from me

As from a dream I awake, echoing screams in the night
Cries of a violated grave, a battered soul yet alive
Trembling I raise bloodied hands...it was I who defiled
Scattering now from my hands, 32 pieces of your smile
