Cold, the air - dark wolves of twilight lay siege at my door 
They cry for me
How fleeting time from dawn's first embrace until dusk's final kiss
How brief the light

Have mercy, mercy, mercy on my soul

In vain, I grasp at notions of youth, at memories past
To stay time's advance
Wisdom or fear? What path I shall walk til the end of my years...
Remains unclear

Have mercy, mercy, mercy on my soul
Have mercy, mercy, mercy on my soul

Winter's winds are howling, crying for my soul
Winter's winds are howling, crying for my soul

Winter's winds are howling, crying for my soul
Winter's winds are howling, crying for my soul
