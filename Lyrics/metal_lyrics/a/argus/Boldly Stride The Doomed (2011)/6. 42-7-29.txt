Cold chill of morning as we two meet again
I seek the answers you won't give

Did you know when you were leaving
you were walking out the door a final time?
If you knew you'd not return to me
why was it that you never said goodbye?

My eyes are choking with tears that will not run
My heart re-breaks my soul is numb

My fingers raw, my fingers bleeding
Upon my knees I rend this cursed soul
Yes, I will claw my way to closure
and hold you once again and say goodbye
