Crawling through the piles of scattered debris
Fragmented remains in the palm of my hand
A brilliant flash of light reveals this to me
In the distance there's an ancient city

Rise and behold
An ancient wall
We approach the unknown
âNothing changes in the City of Stoneâ

Advancing on the road towards our last hope
This device built by Exteria Serene
We're counting on the fact that this thing is real
The Catalyst of legend

A rumble from the darkness
A red light appears
The city awakens

âThrone of shame
Ancient evil remains
Here I sit on my throne
Nothing changes in the City of Stoneâ

Who dares disturb this ancient monument?
Who interrupts my sleep?
I was to slumber for eternity
to never be of need

I will strike down upon your heresy
I will inhale your souls
I will torment you forever
And you will be with me

An ancient A.I. in rampancy
Stands between us and what we seek
It will destroy us and consume our minds
to never be alone again

We only seek the ancient Catalyst
to defend us all
We are just fighting for Therenia
The Revenant must fall

I have consumed both Therenian and Revenant
Your innocence is a lie
I have observed you for a thousand years
I known all your lies and all of your fears
And I will watch you die

The A.I. disappears
And then we see our goal

A massive active portal
The stone ceiling cracks and falls

And as I reach the portal
I turn to the others and realize

The other members of my team
My love and my friends are gone

The portal takes me away
