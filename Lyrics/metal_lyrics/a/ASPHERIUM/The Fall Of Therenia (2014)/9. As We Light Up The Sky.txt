See the city laid to waste on the horizon
Power weapons and prepare to engage

And then we light up the sky
A version haunting my mind
A future of our world in fire
Troubling future ahead

Firing blasts of hot molten plasma
Throwing at them everything we've got
Revenant mothership rises through the smoke
Rising to the sky without a scratch

And then they turn to attack
Powering weapons to strike back
I feel the energy rising
Brace yourselves for the impact

Breaching the hull
Unknown energy sear through the ship

A rapid blast of endings
Streaming through my mind
Searching for a solution
Lost inside

And then she touches my hand
And brings me back to this land
A blazing vision of dream
The Catalyst here it's real

We lack their DNA strand
The standard attack will force cells to expand
And turn their ship into ashes
When their mothership crashes

Bleed for Therenia
Crash to your doom
Now just leave us alone
And we will watch the sun rise again
