We are on the search for the Catalyst
Lost for countless ages
Stories claim it can render
the Revenant each one cold and lifeless

Deception beyond
what we must go through
It's not who we are
But it may be our only choice

Power to attack specific
DNA strands just found
in Revenant
The Catalyst to save us
once and for all
all against what we live for

Deception beyond
what we must go through
It's not who we are
But here we all stand to face the...

Guardians of the gates
Standing through the age of time
Guardians of the gates
Staring into...

We will step forth and claim
the right to enter
We must prove to be
Therenia's defenders

The time has come for
the gates to once more open
This place has slumbered for
a thousand years

Guardians of the gates
Standing through the age of time
Guardians of the gates
Staring into my mind

Every step we take, I feel someone watching
I sense someone watching our every move
The scientist can't here any more
All dead and turned to dust

Guardians of the gates
Standing through the age of time
Guardians of the gates
Staring into my mind

Deception beyond
what we must go through
It's not who we are
But it may be our only choice

Something wants us to leave
A deep rumble trembles the room
I feel the ground giving in
I close my eyes as we all fall
