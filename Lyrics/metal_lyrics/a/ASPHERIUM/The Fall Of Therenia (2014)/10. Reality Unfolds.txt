Searching the remains
Of a Revenant site
Crashed to the ground
In a fury of light

We're stepping through
All the blood and the flesh
of the Revenant

Seeing the bloodbath beyond
Sharing their death in their bond

Sensing some movement
there up ahead
Someone still alive?
No all must be dead

No one can survive that Catalyst blast
I see a draped figure

Screaming 
I am beyond you all
I am the endless one
I will consume your souls
as you wither

Tearing
I am the pinnacle of evolution
Your race is the subject of my retribution
beyond bone and flesh

Your very own flesh
infused with our DNA
the Catalyst will destroy
All of you along with me

Load up the Catalyst
Enter genetic strand

It's true
We'll destroy ourselves
We must find another way

As reality unfolds
In front of our feet
I must do what's right

Gather and be safe
Go forth and journey through life
I'll make the sacrifice

As I journey through the void
Towards the unknown
I'll still be right here

We'll meet again in another cycle
We'll meet again in another lifetime
Take me away and regain your Therenia

As I journey to the void
Towards the unknown
I'll see all things right

We will meet again somehow
You will all prevail
But I'm leaving now

Your blind arrogance will be your undoing
I'll blast away your very soul in this field of fire

And the end is nigh
As I look to the sky
It's my own demise
A worthwhile sacrifice
