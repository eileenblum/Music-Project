Count the stars as I observe the horizon
A distant shockwave distorting the view
Two full moons as I stand in the twilight 
Blinded

I see all these dark objects coming down from
the apex of our world
Numbers obscuring the view of the sky
Will this be the fall of Therenia?
Please forgive me for doubting

Revenant approaching from a shattered sky
Ship setting down in a cloud of fumes
How can we have what is theirs?
This is our first contact

Tall figure
Draped in black
Burning eyes
Beckons me

The Revenant are here
For what you have taken

Foh'r yovh grah'l
Isah' nath'rakah

Prepare for harvest
Of all of your blood
Foh'r yovh grah'l
Isah' nath'rakah

We will not concede
To this misery
You speak all but lies

I see all these dark figures growing
Down in the abyss of my mind
Revenant searching my mind for the truth
Rampage through the heart of Therenia
Please believe our innocence

Counting the Revenant ships coming down
Shockwaves distorting my view
Two full moons obscured by a wall of war ships

Stand and behold all that you know
They'll strike us down
What have we done?
All can be lost, that is the cost
Is this the fall of our world?
