Climbing through remains
of what was once a place of peace
Dripping wet with blood of my brethren
I can barely breathe
Bleed me the truth
And stop their arrival
I must come to terms with this
And find a way to stop the slaughtering

Stop annihilation

Running onwards towards my fate
Searching for someone alive
Broken beauty beyond disgrace
All we can do is survive

Hearing the cry of survivors
Leading me towards a hideout
Everyone broken and helpless
But back in the distance
I see a familiar face

Searing above all 
Screaming
We will burn you with skyfire
The smell of burning flesh
Endless cries for help 

Running onwards towards my fate
But I am no longer alone
Broken beauty beyond disgrace
Another objective beyond

The search for the Catalyst
That can end this thing once and for all
Hidden deep underground
This can prevent our fall
