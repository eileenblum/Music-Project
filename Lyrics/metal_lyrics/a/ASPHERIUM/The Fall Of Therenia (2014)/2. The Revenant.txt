Revenant rampaging throughout the town
Burning it all to the ground
Claiming demands we do not understand
Epic scale battle at hand

What does our own future hold?
Beaten and broken down cold

I will search for answers
What are they doing here
I will find a reason
That will defy you

Now the sky is bleeding
And shedding off its soul
I hear distant screaming
And the sound of thunder

I will move through the fear
And I will step beyond
That which lies ahead
Imminent danger

I will find a way to gather up a team
And find a way to defeat this invasion

Watch your cities burn
We will burn down your empire

Cities bleeding
Raining down
People screaming
Haunted sound
Nation burning
To the ground
Revenant yearning

I seek thee
I deceive
I will feast upon your souls
And I will have my harvest

But I'm still alive
I look to the sky
I search for a truth
Asking why

Fire raining down
Fear running through my mind
Fearing what I will find
Am I the only one?

Where are the others?
Searching for someone
Searching in vain
Searching my mind
Finding nothingness

Hoping that this is a dream
A nightmare that will fade away
The darkness that rises is real
It tears at my soul
But it won't bring me down
