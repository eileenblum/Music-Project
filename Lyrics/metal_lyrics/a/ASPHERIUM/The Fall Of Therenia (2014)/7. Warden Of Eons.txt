I am on the steps of the doorway
Leading to the truth
Can this madness be made into sense?
Can I find an answer?

The weight of my world on my shoulders
I'm the only one
The sacrifice of the others
Will never be forgotten

And so I will step forth

Now 
I see the truth within my reach
I can sense it in my bones
The answer is hidden here
I reach out to grab it

Now 
On the threshold of knowledge
to save my kind
I need to find a solution
a way to survive

Standing in silence
My will is taken away from me
Standing in silence
Sensing an interloper stalking me

Revive me now
Revive my senses
Revive me now
Revive my senses

Searching in my head
For a truth that was once shed
That truth does not reside
Within the corners of my mind

Now just let me go
I will tell you what I know
A Revenant in my mind?
Or an A.I. I will find?

Standing in silence
Feeling the life draining out of me
Standing in silence
And here I stand in the darkness

Revive me now
Revive my senses
Revive me now
Revive my senses

I've run this facility
for countless eons now
I know everything the universe will share
Therenia was but a speck of dust to us
But you posed a threat when you went forth
And drew first blood

Revive me now
Revive my senses
Revive me now
Revive my senses

Now I'll let you go
I have seen you did not know
But still a threat you hold
Our technology you stole
