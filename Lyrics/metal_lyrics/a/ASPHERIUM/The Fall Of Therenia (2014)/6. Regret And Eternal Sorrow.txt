Where are they now?
Those I left behind?
Why didn't you listen?
I don't know how to return

My heart is in darkness
My structural weakness
There must be a reason
Will this be the end?

Traversing this wasteland
Why was I brought here?
No sign of significance
No sign of purpose

My heart is in darkness
My structural weakness
There must be a reason
Will this be the end?

No life here
No saviour
A light in the distance
Now I gather my strength

We'll meet again
I'll find a way
A flickering light
Illuminates my resolve

My heart is in darkness
My structural weakness
There must be a reason
Will this be the end?

Some hope here
Truth out there
Approaching a structure
of unknown design

We'll meet again
I'll find a way
A flickering light
Illuminates my resolve
