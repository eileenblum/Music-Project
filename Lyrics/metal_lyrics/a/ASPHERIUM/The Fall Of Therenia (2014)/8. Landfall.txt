As I exit the portal
Blinded by fright
My world's infected
by Revenant might
Is it too late
to restore our fate
Shattered harmonies
from the city of Theron Serene

The Revenant Blight
must end in this night
Exteria Serene
We were deceived
Must all of us pay
for the sins of the few

Therenia burned and raped

Oncoming drones
Stealthy approach
Scared and defenseless
Raising my senses
Shattered remains
Hide in plain sight
As a structure falls
Down from the sky

The ground starts to rumble
As a massive mothership sets down
Engines fill the air with acid
Lungs burn with every breath
I must run into the city
Find the members of my team
Did anyone survive this
No one alive is to be seen
What if I'm the only one left
All alone against them all
I don't know how to defeat them
I can't do this by myself

All alone in darkness
Withering 
All engulfed by sadness

Staring at my shadow
Into darkness I fade

Acidic air comes creeping from behind
I can't escape
My vision getting darker
Hurting more with every breath
As I stumble and fall down
I look up towards the sky
My last vision is a Therenian starship above

As I come to myself
I'm blinded by a bright white light
Is this what death is like?
Is there no more Therenia?
My eyes adjust and I can see a figure by my side
Neither a demon or a pale death
This figure holds my hand

The Revenant Blight
must end in this night
Exteria Serene
We were deceived
Must all of us pay
for the sins of the few

Staring at my love
Into her eyes I fade

Not alone in darkness
Withering
All engulfed by hope
