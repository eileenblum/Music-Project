Stuck in my mind
A vision of truth appears in front of me
A disturbing image awakens me
Reaching out for what once was real

Craving daylight
As I lay
Under a blackening sky

Raining sorrow
No tomorrow
Forces of war gathering
Creeping darkness taking control of our minds
Seeking to create insurgence
Aiming to reveal the truth
Now open your mind

Soulless worthless humans
Sicken me
Death reaching out for me
Shed serenity
Shed humanity

As we slither through the fire and rain
Our humanity meets its end
We're crushed by the weight of our world
Suffocation of our souls

Hordes of swarming locust
Dehumanized, feasting on ourselves
Burning our world to ashes
Violating our own sanctuary

This
Is
The
Cycle of extinction

Now
We
All
Slither away

As we slither through the fire and rain
Our humanity meets its end
We re crushed by the weight of our world
Suffocation of our souls

Hordes of swarming locust
Entering my deepest dreams
Our world is burnt to ashes
Violating our sanctuary

Soulless worthless humans
Sicken me
Death reaching out for me

This
Is
The
Cycle of extinction

Now
We
All
Slither away
