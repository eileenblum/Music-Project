The fallen monument of man
Utopia transformed into a wasteland
Piercing cries from the wretched
A world turned into ashes

Stuck in between reality and dream
Hollow inside, struck by the light
Empty now, we broke our vow
Soiled minds and broken inside

Wandering the forests of fire
Discordant streams of lost hope
Cast aside the human desire
Standing your ground
Refuse and resist

Now beaten by flame
Cities turned to ashes and dust
Is there still hope?
Can we be saved by the rain?

Look in your mind
Look in your soul

Searching for a seed of hope
To grow all new life
This fire engulfs all living
Lost in conflagration

Between the fire and the rain
