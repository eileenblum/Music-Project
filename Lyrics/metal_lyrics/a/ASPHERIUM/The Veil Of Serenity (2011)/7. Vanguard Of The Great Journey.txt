Imprinted in stone for millennia
Constructed in shadows eons ago
All remembrance of man
Gone for eternity
Our creations. bodies and minds
Turned into dust

Blowing peaceful winds
No destruction
Only serenity
Obliterated

Burning fields of misery
Laid to rest by sickening vermin
The wretched that burned our living skin
Obliterated
The cleansing of the virus
That plagued the Earth
Trapped inside the fear
For a thousand years

Walk into this light
Follow the path
All will be forgiven
Follow the great journey

No!
I will find a way
No!
To save ourselves. rebuild this place
No!
Be one with Earth again
No!
A new beginning

I see a vast and boundless dimness
I will engage in dreams of light
I will repel your filthy sickness
Know
The journey is a lie!

Now we stand before eternity
Unknowing of our fate
Falling tears from the sky
We will rise again

So here I stand again in solitude
Withered by despair
Contemplating tomorrow

The cold soothing fog enters my mind
Visions of hope and serenity
Dreams of light
No longer an escape from reality

So here I stand
Only my mind
The dawn is approaching
Silence is nearing
The power of our minds in harmony
What is written in our future
We will rise again
