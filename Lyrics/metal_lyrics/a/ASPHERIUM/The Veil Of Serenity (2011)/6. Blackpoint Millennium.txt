Under a burning moon we stand
Endless rain of fire
Walking upon this shattered Earth
Chaos at the center of everything

Blinding the eyes of the innocent
(Embrace infinity)
Weeping in solitude
(Embrace infinity)

Under a blackened sky we stand
(Embrace infinity)
Draining souls of hope
Empowered misanthrope
Blank dead eyes
Feeding upon the demise

And so we rise, to be once more betrayed
Witness this barren wasteland
And move towards the unknown

Empty laughs from the darkness
Of the utter hopelessness
Find a way to gain strength
A need for hope

If we re to sacrifice ourselves
Would it be better in the end?
Blood draped infinity horizon
Erased to find a new beginning

I'm walking through infinity
My body is withered by dust
The soothing sight of daylight
Emerging from the void
Beyond the veil is there a better world?

Disharmony revealed
We re drowning in despair
We stand under a cursed sky now
In mindful isolation
Are we all but lost?
Lost?

Destroy our world as we know it
Sacrifices made the new beginning

And the cries fell silent
All the spheres shattered into one another
And the world as we know it
Was unmade
As it was before creation
