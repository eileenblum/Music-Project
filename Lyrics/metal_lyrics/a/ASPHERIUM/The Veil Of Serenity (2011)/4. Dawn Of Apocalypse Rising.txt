Devastating bleak prophecies
In a vision of haze
A burning image of a world engulfed in death and decay
This voice of warning, still ring in my head
These words will linger

Human kind consumed by everlasting flames

A sphere with souls of sinners
Crushing earthly life
The time has come for the great cleansing of mankind

In this world of chaos
Darkness descends
Upon a rising sun we ll never see again
This desolate atmosphere
Obliterates hope
Devoid of life

Human kind consumed by everlasting flames

A sphere with souls of sinners crushing earthly life
The time has come for the great cleansing of man

The truth is dawning on mankind
Gazing endlessly towards the sun
A blazing wind of reality
Removes the blindfold from our eyes

This end is only a new beginning

Eradicate disharmony
Within the realm of possibility
Escape from the void of dissent
Another sun will light the way
A rising day

Human kind evading everlasting flames
Escaping from the void
Of non-existing life
The time has come for the great aeon of mankind
