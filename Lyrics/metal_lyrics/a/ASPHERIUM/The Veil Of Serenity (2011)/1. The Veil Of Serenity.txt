A crack in the mirror of our perfect world
Painted a picture we thought we deserved
Caught in this image we thought of as life
The truth is unveiled...

Our lives
Were all lies
Now we stare
The truth in the eye

Lost all hope
Lost all strength
No relief
No escape

A path through the forest of all our lost minds
Wandering wraiths in the vacuum of time
Bleeding the truth through a crack in the sky
Trapped in a prison world in our own minds

Our world
Revolving
Circling
A dying star

All lost. consumed by serenity
The truth unveiled the true misery
Deceived by an image of a perfect world
Deceived by the veil

All our minds wiped away by the rain
Lost inside with nothing to gain
Standing in line at tranquility lane
Fighting the light while exhaling the pain

Soothing sunset
Calming silence
Witness the revelation
Inhale the dust from the real world
