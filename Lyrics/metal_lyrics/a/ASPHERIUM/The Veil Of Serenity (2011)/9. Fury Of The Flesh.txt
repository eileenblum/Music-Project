Breaking down the conscious mind
Surfacing rage from the whispers inside
Dealing with the venom within
Struggling to defeat my demons of sin

The blood on your hands
Will never wash away

I defy the malignance
I am the voice of the tattered souls
You revel with the senseless transgression
Tearing apart your soul

The blood on your hands
Dripping down to the Earth
The blood on your hands
Will never wash away

Witness a soulless defiler
Witness desecration of the purity
Entrance of the reconciler
Escape from the body and open your mind

The blood on your hands
Raining down on the Earth
The blood in your soul
Will never wash away

Drowning in an ocean of blood
Suffocating under the weight of your sins

As the daylight fades
I wither as I stand
All my demons exhaled
I will prevail

Gazing upon the shattered sky
Scars of purity pouring down
I'll let my sorrows drown
Rip out your filthy spine

Now shed your sins and scream in sorrow
Grow your new skin, open your mind
And start anew

Escape the fury of your flesh
Escape the certainty of death
Escape corruption of your soul
Escape more powerful than all

Echoes of a boundless soul
Cleansing of the wicked in all
Blinded by ethereal dreams
Blinded by this beautiful horror

The blood on your hands
Is fading

The lifeblood of this world. ..
Casting down the chains of injustice
Casting down the monument to all of your sins
Penitent in silent serenity
Disturbed by an eternal shrilling lament

The scars of purity
Are fading away
The shattered sky
Is calling my name

Looking up to the sky
All is well in my head
Rain of purity pouring down
Washing blood and scars away

Dawning day
Rising sun
Cleansed soul
Cleansed mind

These scars are pure
Blood washed away
We've shed our sins
And cleansed our souls
