The time has come for me to rise
Natures blood has been shed
Flaming detonations of war
Thou scorch me with raining fire

Thou mock me and violate me
Scavenge my blood from my veins
Leave me to wither and die
Under the sky

Those whom speaketh of redemption
Their lies are venomous
Those whom speaketh of deliverance
They hide their lies

Those whom speaketh of forgiveness
They slither away
I will rise from the shadows

I see your lies
Corrupted and jaded abysmal human kind
Stop all your lies
Or I'll engulf the world in
My abyss of scorching flames
Now I despise
These vultures crafted in
The void of nothingness
I will arise
To yet again be restored to purity

I am the giver and sustainer of life
I will striketh down with terrible vengeance
Thou will all perish at my will
And I shall be reborn. whilst humanity
Will forever be forgotten

Those whom speaketh of redemption
Their lies are venomous
I will rise

Earth and soil
Suffocating. draining the essence of human life
Wind will destroy
Your pitiful existence that you call life
Fire will burn
And consume the entirety of the human race
Water will flood
And wash all of your filthy sins away

I am the giver and sustainer of life
I will striketh down with terrible vengeance
Thou will all perish at my will
And I shall be reborn. whilst humanity
Will forever be forgotten

Await the rebirth
The new beginning
No lament for humanity
