Bleed! Suffer! Scream! Die!

Strangling you
Feels so good
Hear you crying
Cry for me
Licking your blood
From your body
Wait to watch you
Die!

Where is the next?
I want to kill again
Where do you hide?
Come to Daddy little girl
Let me see you
Sssssuffeeeer
Let me rape you To death
Now take my hand
And feel the real madness

Torture you
Feels so good
Hear you crying
Cry for me
Licking your blood
From your body
Waiting to watch you
Die!

You try to call for help
Worthless human being
No one's gonna help you
I will only stand here
Enjoying watching you
Losing all your blood

Darkness around your soul
Feel my cold breath
I'm sucking your blood
From my knife
No take the hand of real madness

Bleed! Suffer! Scream! Die!
