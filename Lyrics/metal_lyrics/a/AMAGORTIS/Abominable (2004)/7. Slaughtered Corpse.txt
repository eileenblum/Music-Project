I hunt you this night, this is your sacrifice
I saw you in my morbid dreams
you should be the one who may feel my lust
I drift you around from place to place no time to rest
I'll show you my anger to night I'm your savage butcher

Slaughtered corpse Hanged up with ropes
Slaughtered corpse Worst dismemberment
Slaughtered corpse Chopped up with knifes
Slaughtered corpse You can't escape

I see the fear
in your face I will see you bleed
In my butcher's chamber you will find the end
I hang up your body, speak your last word!
Now I take my knife and will begin to cut your skin
The ground discolours redly From your innards and your blood

Slaughtered Blood flowed down the rotten corpse
Slaughtered Ripped flesh hangs of the body
Slaughtered Broken bones broke through the skin
Slaughtered The marks of torture were immense

With a saw I open up your fleshless, bloodred skull
Filled up with wine it will be in the sign of my triumph
