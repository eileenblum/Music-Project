It's a silent night, the moon is shining
Fog on the land, deep in the woods
stand a house, the light is burning
feel the music of death

The trees nod in the wind
The sweet smell of drugs
lures you to the house
all you hear are dying cows

Abominable Lyrics
Fucking sound from crazy heads
A virus in your mind
Control the brain
world in flames

You loose the soul
forgotten all hope
the sound needs a shape
the virus needs a victim

Abominable Music
Abominable Songs
Abominable People
Abominable Death

I just want to make you bleed
I bring your death with gore
