I want to be in rapture over watch you bleed
I'll show you if you don't know what I mean!

Strangulated I tear you behind me
My long stony way back home
As long as it needs to run to you
Your torture last, our torture last

You meet me
And will notice that
I'm not here to speak
Where will you going now?
Don't run away from me!

Cannibal obsession
And you are my meat
Your flesh is my desire
I'll show you if you don't know what I mean

Don't pray for mercy
Feel how it hurts
I'll just satisfied my greed
You deserved to suffer

Your desperate cry will not stop
Your captivity
I bring you the freedom you need
Consume you from head to feet
(I almost starves when you cook
And finally you get) quiet
Know I can rest for a while
With my delicious meal
