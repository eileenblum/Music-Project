There is something inside me
It feels like an other Soul
It, it's fighting me
Tries to kill all live in me

Blood runs cold over my face
skin explode, the floor is turning red
Pieces of my skin where lying on the ground
now I feel like resurrected!
It called me back
To kill all human life,
All things of Hope
Just to see the mankind rot

Walking through the endless night
Led by the dead voice in my head
It whispers me to kill
sacrifice and dismember

There is no way out
It is stronger, it instructs
It gave me the new deadly shape
I should be the chosen one

My lifeless eyes
only see
dead and suffer
On the path
I walked down this Night!!!
