I wake up
Inside of a dark cave
I don't know what I am doing here
I'm not injured
I still have my sword
I still got my armour
I can hear someone approach
Now I can even see him
My hated enemy

You laugh at me
Although I stab you
Seems not to hurt you
Sadistic Enemy
Your skin is bleeding
But you're still standing
But I'll not stop
I want you death

I start to fight, I want him dead
With all of my hate, with all my strength
I want to see his end today
Butcher his skin, butcher his flesh
His blood is flooding down his legs
But then I hear him laughing at me
I stab him more and more again
Don't understand why... he still laughs
Why is he not feeling the pain?

Feel the hate
Feel the pain
Your warm blood
On my face

Finally I rise my sword
Make his head fall
I want the victory to be mine
His head is rolling on the ground
His body falls to my feet
But he is still fucking smiling!
Can I not win? Cannot defeat him?
Will he always be haunting me?
Why don't you just leave me? LEAVE ME!
