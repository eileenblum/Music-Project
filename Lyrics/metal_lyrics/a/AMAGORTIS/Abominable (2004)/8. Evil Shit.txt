Welcome to the party
Feel free, feel free
And grep a beer

Burbs! Farts!
Sick people
Enjoy the trip

Evil shit pure madness
Don't try to kill yourself
Pure madness
Evil shit pure fear
You hear just desperate cries
Pure fear

Welcome to the massacre
Feel bleed and grep a

Sword! your head fooling in the blood
Gun! one shot in the middle of your face
Knife! I cut your eyes out and fuck the hole

Horror Story's in the party house
The murder had buried
The body of his victim
He had some deadly cuts
Killing is so funny
And when I die you're my slave in paradise
Something gives me
The most trilling experience
It is even better than
Getting your rocks off with a girl
The best part of it
Is that when I die I will be reborn
And those I have killed
Will become my slaves

Evil Shit, pure darkness
You'll never find the let out
pure darkness
Evil Shit, true death
Immortal and never forgotten
EVIL SHIT!
