I want to be in rapture over watching you bleedI'll show you if you don't know what I mean!Strangulated, I tear you behind meMy long stony way back homeAs long as it needs to run to youYour torture last, your torture lastYou meet me. And will notice that I'm not here to speak.Where are you going now? Don't run away from me.Cannibal obsession.And you are my meat. Your flesh is my desire.I'll show you if you don't know what I mean!Don't pray for mercy. Feel how it hurts.I'll just satisfy my greed.  You deserved to suffer.Your desperate cry will not stop your captivity.I bring you the freedom you need.Consume you from head to feet.I almost starved when you cook.And finally you get quiet.Now I can rest for a while.With my delicious meal.
