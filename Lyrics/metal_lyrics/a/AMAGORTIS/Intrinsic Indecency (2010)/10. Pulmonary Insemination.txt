Too much coke. Too much speed.Hey there, what's your name you pretty thing?It's not like I really care.  Eat this pill babe.Let's get wasted. Want to fuck you senselessly!Don't you worry, just this one time.Who cares on a New Year's Eve?Come to my place, party's over,Got more booze and shit at home.Hardcore porn's my favourite thing next to drugs and alcohol.Inhale my semen 'till you stop breathing.Lungs now stuffed up with my cum, start to spazz.Heaving, choking as you go blueThis I didn't expect to be happening nowBut fuck it, I'm gonna huff some glueWanting nothing more than to shove my cock back down your throatHad enough of your bitching around anyway.You'll get one final load.Need more coke. Need some weed.I was planning on having a nice and quiet night,Sadly my urge got the best of me again.Now it's you who looks like you need medicine.Coughing blood and rolling on the ground.Nevermind the fireworks outside the house,All I need to see is right in here.Didn't know how much harm that a load of jizz could do,Every single day one learns something new.As I watch you twitching and spazzing out,My dick starts to do some twitching of its own.God damn, how I love these experiments.So much to learn, so many studies in pain!
