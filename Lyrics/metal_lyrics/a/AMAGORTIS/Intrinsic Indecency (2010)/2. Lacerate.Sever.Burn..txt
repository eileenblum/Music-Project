You fucking bastard,My life's a hell, it's time for paybackI'll enjoy this final night.How long have I had to take your stupid shit? No more!Always had to hear you call me bitchTime's up, gonna have to draw a final line.Guess what? Now it's you who's gotta kiss his ass goodbyeIn the kitchen, I've prepared a nice and little snack for you.Chloroform the appetiser; dessert will be a pool of blood.Liquidate your helpless body, stop the begging.Severing your chains that bound me all these years.Burn all the evidence that might jeopardise me.No one will care, everyone hated you anyway.How long have I waited for this beauty day?No more, never again, will I have to suppress my hate.Time's up! You're the one who's on his fucking knees.Guess what? I don't care how much you scream and plead.
