A routine procedure, gone completely wrongA real fucking pity. That chick had such nice cans.Graduated from med school, might have done too much drugs.Shouldn't have dropped that acid on the night before my first mastectomy.Misplaced mastectomy. Now confusion turns into doubt.My hand was steady applying the cuts. I knew something wasn't quite right.Still thought I knew what I was doing. Wasn't like I was still drunk.As I remove the tumour, something seems to be missing.What felt and looked like a lump, was that really the right boob?A routine procedure. Gone completely wrong. A real fucking pity.That chick had such nice cans. And now they're in the trash.After the operation, the fuck-up came to the light.Husband going completely crazy.Not to speak of the soon-to-be-titless wife.One small confusion turned into truth.The tomogram hung up the wrong way.The lady was the one to payAnd now I have to run awayMisplaced mastectomy
