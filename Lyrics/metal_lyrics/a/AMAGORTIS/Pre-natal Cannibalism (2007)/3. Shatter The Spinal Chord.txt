Blasting through your spinal cord, scraping tissue from bone
Divide the cartilage, exquisite bloody art, sadistic glee
Skinning you carefully, explore your anatomy, lacerate perversely
Torment extreme, cracking your bones, your ribcage implodes
All splinters and gore, lusting for more, ripping the flesh
Carving my way, inhuman precision, tortured screams
Shattering your... spinal cord

Shatter the spinal cord â Splinters pierce your bowels
Shatter the spinal cord â Ruthlessly
Shatter the spinal cord â Blasted anatomy
Shatter the spinal cord â Scream

Ripping your dissected body, innards are exposed
Flailing loosened fat and muscle, cavities implode
Laughing while you bleed and bleed...you bleed...
I'm just serving to my master, lord of rot and malice free
He breathes pestilence, putrid essence of the darkest evil breath
I don't choose this, I'm just doing what the terror told me, bleed

He is watching every twitch of your death through his slave in me
Shattering you spinal cord

Shatter the spinal cord â Splinters pierce your bowels
Shatter the spinal cord â Ruthlessly
Shatter the spinal cord â Blasted anatomy
Shatter the spinal cord â Scream

Ripping your dissected body, innards are exposed
Sadistic glee, torment extreme, cracking your bones
Your ribcage implodes, all splinters and gore â lusting for more
Ripping the flesh, carving my way, inhuman precision
Tortured screams, blasting through your spinal cord
