Severed... in the... cemetery â Severed in the cemetery
Severed... in the... cemetery â Dismembered bodies pile around me
Severed in the cemetery

Decomposing corpses, munching on the half-decayed ones
In my cemetery, thrive on rot
Opening the crypt door, appalling stench so arousing
In my cemetery, I cannot wait
Decomposing corpses, I revel in sickening frolic

In my cemetery violent ecstasy begins
Opening the crypt door, commence hacking mindlessly
In my cemetery I do as I will
Decay enthrals my senses, I do not need a living cunt
Exhume them from their trenches, insides filled with writhing vermin

Severed... in the... cemetery â Dismembered bodies pile around me
Severed... in the... cemetery â Severed in the cemetery
Severed... in the... cemetery â Dismembered bodies pile around me

Decomposing corpses, munching on the half-decayed ones
In my cemetery, thrive on rot
Opening the crypt door, appalling stench so arousing
In my cemetery, I cannot wait

Decomposing corpses, I revel in sickening frolic
In my cemetery violent ecstasy begins
Opening the crypt door, commence hacking mindlessly
In my cemetery I do as I will

Severed... in the... cemetery â Severed in the cemetery
Severed... in the... cemetery â Dismembered bodies pile around me
