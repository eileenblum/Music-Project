Roaming the paths in the fields and the woods
Stalking my prey so they cannot flee
Blinded, they think I am half-man and half-wolf â Uncured sickness
Bringing the corpses back to my home, simply to keep feeding my family
The tastiest meat and the easiest prey â Uncured sickness

Now that they are mine, disfigured and raped, stripped of their flesh
The uncured sickness
What they think I am protects my true being, it hides my true face

A crippled son, result of fucking with my daughter
Made not much of an offspring but quite a delicious meal!
We cooked him, his flesh was soft and tender
The brain was most exquisite, a feast fit for a king!

The cunts I kill all serve the purpose of food, but also pleasure in pain
There's nothing supernatural, the uncured sickness reigns!

Now that they are mine, disfigured and raped, stripped of their flesh
The uncured sickness
What they think I am protects my true being, it hides my true face

The mob which fears my presence as a beast, blinded by belief and faith
They think I am a werewolf, the uncured sickness reigns!

You're accused of heresy and witchery, now condemned to unimaginable pain
On the wheel all your limbs are broken, wife and child will watch before they burn
Scalding tongs used to rip your flesh away as punishment for unfathomable crimes
And your heart removed and incinerated so we can live our lives in peace
