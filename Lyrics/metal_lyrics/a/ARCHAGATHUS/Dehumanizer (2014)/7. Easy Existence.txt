Some people's lives are very hard
Yes, they've been dealt a shitty card
And still you judge from your place of wealth
With your fancy car and excellent health
Your easy existence has made you a jerk
Condemning people for not having work
Life is short and should be enjoyed
But you act like a jerk because you're annoyed
