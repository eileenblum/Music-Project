Driving my Mazda and jacked up on monster (TM)
I wonder if maybe my life needs a sponsor?
I decide to upgrade to 'professional' level
So I take out my iPhone and Google "the devil"
He's into Metallica, the devil's alright!
Until he asks me if the kids are alright.
'But devil,' I say, 'DIY or die!'
'And so you shall, if you do not comply!'
A live music event helps me to meet this quota
Now I get paid in RedBull and drive a Toyota
