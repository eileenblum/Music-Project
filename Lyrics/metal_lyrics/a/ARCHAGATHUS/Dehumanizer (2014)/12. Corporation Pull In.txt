How could you play grindcore and not be aware
That scion and RedBull really don't care
It's not joke and it's certainly not funny
That these capitalist fucks are just after our money
Infiltrating our scene, promoting their cars
Handing out RedBulls and hundreds of dollars
Their free events to make you their friend
Make me feel like grindcore has come to an end

But this is just not true, and it never will be
If this corporation pull in is resisted by you and me
