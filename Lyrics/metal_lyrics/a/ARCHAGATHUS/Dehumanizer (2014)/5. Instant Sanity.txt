Accepting orders from above
Making money acting tough
High on life but low on love
You can never have enough

Until one day you stop to wonder
What's the point of all this plunder?
What's the meaning? Can it be
A dose of instant sanity

The life you chose is mean and gross
And bad for all humanity
Forget your pose, burn all your clothes
Accept a dose of sanity
