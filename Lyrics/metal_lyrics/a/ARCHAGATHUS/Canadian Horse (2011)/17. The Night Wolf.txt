If I could transform into a wolf in the night
I would hunt down those that don't know wrong from right
Vivisectors, cops, racists and rapists
Night wolf annihilates these scum fucking sadists
I hear the night howling it s calling my name
To seek out these bastards, to kill and to maim
Then the world would be full of people that are nice
Who don't find it necessary to torture little mice
But violence is not a very wise tool
Perhaps there is something else the night wolf should do
Like find ways to better his local community
Through respect, equality and generosity!
We could all learn a lesson from this nocturnal hound
And enjoy our lives being safe and sound
Free from racism and sexism and war
And free from a system that oppresses the poor
