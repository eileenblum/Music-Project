Each day I grow weaker, my life s come to an end
All because of this endoparasitic girlfriend
She lives deep inside my stomach and guts
Giving me ulcers and driving me nuts
She won't leave me alone, she won't let me be
She just thinks up ways to make me feel guilty
Sick fucking fiend - irrational being!
Endoparasitic girlfriend - not what I need!
