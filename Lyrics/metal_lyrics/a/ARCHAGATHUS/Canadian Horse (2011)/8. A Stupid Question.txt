Why do you ask what it means
That we must support the scene
By playing shows in greasy shorts
And writing songs that are also short
And never tuning our guitars
Except when we play in the bars
And take our time between each song
To laugh and talk and get along
Likes friends do at the mincecore show
What do you ask us: don't you know?!
