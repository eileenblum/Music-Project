It's been a tough year, I don't know who I am
Questioning my place in a world so dim
What do I do? Where do I fit In?
I feel a new personality growing from within
Mincecore fabio takes control of my mind
Soon I start eating all the protein I can find
I don't know what's happening, I'm losing control
I work out all the time so larger I will grow
My hair is long, it flows with the wind
And I prefer to wear all my shirts unbuttoned
My skills have improved in the ways of romancing
And suddenly horses just seem so enchanting
I listen to Rot and AGx everyday
My friends and family are concerned, they say...
But Mincecore Fabio is here to fucking stay!!
