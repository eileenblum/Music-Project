I speak as your average crazy banger
Who just downloaded the album "St. Anger" ...
I have to say my mind was blown
By your outrageous mincing tones!
Most bands are afraid to find a new sound
And then drive it into the shitty ground,
Or piss themselves in a full-length movie,
Or tour in a plane with no jacuzzi!
But Metallica is totally undaunted:
If you've got a Basquait, then flaunt it!
Hey Metallica, Hey Metallica, Hey!
