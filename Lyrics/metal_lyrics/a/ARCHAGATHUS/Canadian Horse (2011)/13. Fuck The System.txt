Society has a system, it s meant to control
Lock you in a cage, and trap you in a hole
We reject these standards, we won't cut our hair
We ignore the system, cause we don't fuckin' care

[Chorus]
We won't live a real life, with jobs and wives
Fuck the system!
We just wanna play some grind, drunk and high
Mincing system!
Blazing through conformist fools, fuck the rules
Fuck the system!
Drinking in the afternoon, party dudes
Punk existence!
Society says that we should get a fancy job
Wear fancy clothes, quit looking like a slob
Society also frowns on doing lots of drugs
But we frown on success, relationships and hugs

[Chorus]
