There s a dog I know who goes to shows
He doesn't give a fuck if his hearing gets blown
He doesn't play in the park or eat dog food
He just hangs around some shitty crust punk dude
I always wonder why he's riding those trains
Instead of living in a home and playing fun games
Most dogs I know don't listen to Consume
Or have a stick-and-poke tattoo that says DOOM
he's all on his own when his owner gets drunk
So he wonders into the basement and listens to punk
People crash into him and he cries out in pain
Crust punk dog is clearly just fucking insane!!
