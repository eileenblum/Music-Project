[Bonus track]

The days of rage are coming
I've devoted my life to mother war
I will fight until my last breath

Frozen landscape, screaming fury
Tragedy of human infamy
Poisonous heart, lethal injury

Before I'll rest in Elysium
I will make one last wish, my tender one
I will suffer, not surrender, pray and hope

Honour my last prayer, our father
Witness my sorrow and deliver us from evil
Unify our hands forever and deliver us from pain
Unify our hands forever

Memories of joy now are far
I am sailing the ships of penitence
I feel the fire on my knees

I crush the ground and now i see
Scenes of my life, finally free

Honour my last prayer, our father
Witness my sorrow and deliver us from evil
Unify our hands forever and deliver us from pain
Unify our hands forever

Honour my last prayer, our father
Witness my sorrow and deliver us from evil
Unify our hands forever and deliver us from pain
Unify our hands forever
