[Lyrics/Bedos - Music/Forte]

[Verse]
What is that shape in front of me
Spying through the looking glass?
This figure is haunting me,
Aping my every gestures,
Stealing my soul, my self,
The presence of menace is lurking
Behind the translucent surface

[Bridge]
I can't acknowledge that individual;
That reflection in the mirror is not my own
Oh, not my own!

[Chorus]
I can't face that figure
Who looks like me like a twin.
Who is in the mirror?
The similarity,
It can't be me!

[Verse]
The beholder may perceive the evil spark
In the clearness of the eye,
Mirroring the darkness of heart,
The horror!
And yet who can it possibly be?
"No one."
Not me, I know that it can't be me!

[Chorus]
I can't face that figure
Who looks like me like a twin.
Who is in the mirror?
The similarity,
It can't be me!

[Solos]

[Chorus]
I can't face that figure
Who looks like me like a twin.
Who is in the mirror?
The similarity,
It can't be me

I can't, can't, can't face that figure
Who looks like me, like a twin.
I just can't, can't face that figure
Who looks like me!
