In days of solitude
I see my sadness
Printed in my face
Sweet tears I drop
Such beautiful feelings
Suffering...

Alone and sad
Always along
I deeply breathe and leave

Everything is far away from my reach
Alone in the middle of this beautiful green
Landscape I see...

Flowers - Beautiful flowers
Flowers inside of my heart
Flowers - Beautiful flowers
Flowers - Red flowers as the passion

What do I fell
What I am?
What do I make?
Where am I going?

"If you were here
You would feel what I am felling
If you were here
You could see it with me..."

Flowers - Beautiful flowers
Flowers inside of my heart
Flowers - Beautiful flowers
Flowers - Red flowers as the passion
