I hear sad...
Serenades in the dawn
Romantic echoes...
In my mind
Sweet melancholy...
Of this life
Flowers that sleep...
In my garden

I hear sad serenades in the dawn
Romantic echoes in my mind
Sweet melancholy of this life
Flowers that sleep in my garden

The perfume of the roses
Wakes me up of my dreams
Flowered roads I travel to find a precious
answer of my deeper feelings

I appreciate and I love the nature
The wind softens my soul
I open the windows of my eyes

To see the soft shine of a pretty day of sun
Illuminating the dawn of my dreams

Romantic Serenades...

In the dawn...
