I sometimes think
that the life is eternal
I sometimes think
That the death is too...

If these are my fears
Why then will fear something?

Life is not a nightmare
And death doesn't make me suffer
It stamps all my secrets
Ending my destiny

Which I will never avoid...

My last good-bye to everybody
My last good-bye to all my friends
To my parents and my loves

My words are my salvation
I save my soul from darkness
And my tears which
I have no reason
Reason in dying for passion.
