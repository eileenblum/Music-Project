Cold tears as the snow
My body feel the pain and the fear
I want to leave but I can not

I have sad dreams
My depression is insane
Drowning my feelings
Enormous emptiness of madness

Lucid and crazy
I become a martyr
For wanting what not I accept
The pain makes me sleep

The death arrives cold and silent
I feel your soft touch
Tearing my soul
Destroying my dreams

Darkness...
My eyes can see

Sadness...
Is what I feel

Pain...
Calming my soul

Fear...
Silencing my destiny

Cold tears as the snow
My body feel the pain and the fear
I want to leave but I can not...
