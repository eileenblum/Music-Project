The sea
Is a sanctuary to me
I see "The Waves"
Wetting the sand
I walk on the water
To suffocate the sadness (that I feel)

I died here
In this sombre sea

The sea cries like me
With the deep eyes
Of a blue ocean
An ocean of tears

Shedding them on my tomb
A wet and cold tomb

I still feel waves
Flooding my coffin
My sailing leaves to the death
A melancholic and cold death

Alone!

Submerged in sadness eternally...
