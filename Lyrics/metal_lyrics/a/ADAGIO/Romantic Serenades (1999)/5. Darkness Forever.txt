In your mind
As a sweet madness
The deepest feelings
Trying to find an answer
You cannot see me
You cannot touch me
I am what you most fear
I am you

You...

Scream for your name
That I will hear
I am always close to you
But there is not a way to see me

All your fears
As an infinite nightmare
Destroying the dreams
Feeding the illusions

Out of your reach
Your last hope
Close your eyes and come to...

Darkness Forever
