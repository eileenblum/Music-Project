Your face is soft like wind
My hands want to touch you
But my eyes don't find you
In this dark place...

I look at the moon
And I see your cold beauty
The stars brightness is like your eyes
Deep and melancholy

Your face is soft like wind
My hands want to touch you

In this dark place cold like death...

Like the sad passion that I feel
Watching you leaving
To the death

I look at the moon
And I see your cold beauty
The stars brightness is like your eyes
Like the sad passion that I feel
Watching you leaving...

To the... Death...
