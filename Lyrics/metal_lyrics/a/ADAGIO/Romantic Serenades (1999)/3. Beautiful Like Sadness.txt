I see you, my beloved
I brought flowers to cover your body
Beautiful and cold flowers
Cold like your soul

The tears that I cry
Sweet tears of love
You sad beauty
Beautiful like sadness

I contemplate your face
Inside a coffin
Pale like the moon light
Moon that saddens me

I see you, my beloved
I brought flowers to cover your body
Beautiful and cold flowers
Cold like your soul

Now I'm alone
Alone to find you
Alone to cry
Alone to die with you...
