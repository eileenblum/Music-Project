In misty gloomy daydreams
Flickers among sighs
In the winding flesh undulation
In the gentle convulsion of a lecherous dance
A feminine spectrum actrum

Sinister synchronization
Viper movements
Twisting in desire spirals
Among black robes
A woman's silhouette
Reveals legs, arms and marble breasts
Lecherous hands that slips
Between the caresses and the sores
Feet that don't touch the floor
That walk in a semi-materialism
In the sphere of dreams

In the sphere of dreams..
In dreamlike places
Hung on profane minuetto
In the gloomy macabre
Between the teeth of pain
And the claws of pleasure

In the locks of night
And within madness
Dances magna lady
Dances the night nymph
Winding such as sulphuric
Smoke from corpses
Pale as an air demon
And treacherous as a ignis fatuus

A bone retine frames
Honouring the tortured dancer
That in front of my eyes
Takes off the shroud

I cover her
The coldness of her empty orbits
And her leprous flesh

In the bone dance
I find her arms
In ecstasy I lose myself in a kiss
Finding

The coldness from the lack of lips,
In the affections of a without flesh skull.
