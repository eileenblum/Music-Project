In the erect tower of flesh and nightmares
in the entrails of the libido of lovers
Corroded, lust excruciated her belly filthy
And from her blood created the carnal flower

From the flames of desire,
From the libido of the salamanders
Surfaced the prostitute of pain
The devourer of souls
The Succubus serpent

Succubus you lead from the places of pleasure
To the place of pain
Suffocating beasts between the legs
Blaspheming curses in the whispers

Succubus, the poison from your lips
Excruciates the guts of the lovers,
The cruelty of your thorns make the pure
dreams bleed.

Oh, impure prostitute of avernus
your throne is the sacrificed
Blood in the turpes orgies

Your balance if flash and your kingdom
Is the entrails of lust

Pleasure and pain are your name
Iron and flesh are your essence
oh, Succubus
