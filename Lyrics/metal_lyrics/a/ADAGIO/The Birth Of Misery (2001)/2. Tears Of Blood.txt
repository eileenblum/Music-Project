In a world without soul I live
Where I walk between the darkness
life which makes me cry
cry tears of blood

Look around me
Naked bodies suffering
Pleading for flesh
And their faces disfigured

In you beds, zombies
Search for flesh
Call me to death
They want to invade my soul

And suddenly the father of darkness appears
Bringing pain and fear
I try to run away but I can't
I'm in your hands

I request the pardon at this valley of tears
I walk for centuries in a search of light
The darkness pursues me
Now I'm the fallen angel

My sad walk in search of life
Of flesh, of blood in this dark world
Where I'll spend my eternity
Crying tears of blood.
