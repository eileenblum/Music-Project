Tearful eyes, exhausted, reflecting
Staring at the gloomy, empty, cold night
On the eyelids, dismal lethargy
The heart's passin begind to exhaust
The entire life briefly consumes itself
For one dies a little while one sleeps...

Dark shadows, sinister dreams
Heavy gates for putrid nightmares
That my bed of sad thoughts
Thirstily watch over in a
Way that I can't stoop them
Flying fast violating the world's veils
Reality and illusion unite
Themselves in dirty bonds

Distant outcries echo in darkness
Screams of pain scattered in the air
Laments in the wind, night sorrows
Night outcries of excruciating pain
Melodic music mysterious melancholy
Femnis funereal songs in the cold night

The laments of the night are motherly weepings
Through the birth of horrors in unmoving buds,
The pale mother of my macabre fears
Excruciates the filthy fertile belly in disenchantments
Bringing nightmares and unknown fears
In the form of fetid, fatal, torn foetus

The darkness baby sins of human lives
Appears the light in buds of nascent degradation
Children like skulls, corrupted children
Echoes of the birth of a sick world
Children of the repressed fury. Mrs funereal
Here are the heirs of the depraved human misery
