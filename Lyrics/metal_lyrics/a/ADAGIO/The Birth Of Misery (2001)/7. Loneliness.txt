In the horizon loneliness waits for us
I walk through empty and dark streets
Where the sound of wind has the smell of death
The sun is dying, with its life

I'm paying the price for my greed
In a place where pain and fear dominate me
Eternal loneliness, when will it end?

My sick body
Can't carry its sin
In this valley of death
I let the rage of darkness carry me

Wondering alone I can see yours souls
Trying to find an explanation
They don't know what they're doing
But I fell that they cry

Now we're immortal ghosts
Trying to find the way out in our bodies
We're like vampires
In search of eternal life
