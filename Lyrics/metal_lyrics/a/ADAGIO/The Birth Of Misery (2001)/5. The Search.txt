Dark and gloomy night
I cross secret passages
Wolves thirsty for blood
pursues me

World of illusions which tortures me
Earth time farther from you
Far from everything
And closer to our souls

Dark and gloomy night
Walking through strange places
Searching for my love
My soul lost

Far from this rotten world
Where everything is purer and farther
I try to find you in the silence of the night

Broken silence
A shout in the dark
A voice whispers about your pain
