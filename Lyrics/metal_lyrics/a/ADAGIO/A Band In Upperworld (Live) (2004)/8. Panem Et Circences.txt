[Japanese Bonus Track]

All we've done is provide them
With food and mindless entertainment;
They easily renounced their liberty.
Hence deprived of will of their own,
Lobotomised, forced into docility,
They were turned into obsequious slaves.
We've taciltly accepted this preposterous situation
In the name of that accursed social cohesion
Now they will tolerate no subversion
Retaliation is out, of the question.
They've insidiously concealed the truth
Ostensibly in the cause of Equality:
We've been coaxed into lethal apathy,
Desperately clinging to an abject safety.
Loathing our predicament in this inimical world,
Stultfied, we are unable to regain our blighted hopes.
We've taciltly accepted this preposterous situation
In the name of that accursed social cohesion
Now they will tolerate no subversion
Retaliation is out, of the question.
