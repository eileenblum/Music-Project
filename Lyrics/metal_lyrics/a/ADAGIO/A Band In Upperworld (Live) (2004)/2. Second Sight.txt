I foresee ages of chaos,
But my ordeal has yet just started
For these ominous signs,
Are bound to plague me
Haunt for centuries to come,
My healing incantations
Are destined for failure
My unremitting warnings and threats
Will go unheeded, such is my curse.
Why should it be incumbent upon me
To redeem their faults ?
You, The one who spurns the past Are now,
But worthy to be last.
Thy choices are errors;
I shall thus abandon thou
To thy gloomy fate.
I can see the future In the light of the past.
I cannot stop this ineluctable doom
From raining over the world.
Alas, this obnoxious portend
Will turn out to be abiding truth.
From time immemorial,
Man has taken refuge in oblivion.
They've exchanged there future for the present enjoyment.
Nothing will change,
History has set
Her implacable march into motion.
There will be no escape.
You, The one who spurns the past
Are now, But worthy to be last.
Thy choices are errors;
I shall thus abandon thou To thy gloomy fate.
