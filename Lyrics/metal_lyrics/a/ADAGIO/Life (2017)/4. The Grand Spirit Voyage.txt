[Music: StÃ©phan FortÃ©, lyrics: Kelly Carpenter]

Above the waves of swirling marble plains
Floating, soaring
As symbols pour upon a crystal shore
Shining, blinding

Drifting forever into the never
Swept into always been

Flowing, knowing and showing
Invoking the light within
Bending, ascending, transcending
The shell that was me

Whispering rhymes are rippling through time
Singing, weaving
The evermore beyond the puzzle door
Waiting

Drifting forever into the never
Swept into always been

Flowing, knowing and showing
Invoking the light within
Bending. Ascending. Transcending
The shell that was me

Drifting forever into the never
Swept into...

Flowing, knowing and showing
Invoking the light within
Bending, ascending, transcending
The shell that was me
