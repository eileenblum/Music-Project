[Music and lyrics: StÃ©phan FortÃ©]

This scream in my head
So frightening and cruel
Haunts me again
The darkness is real
It's wearing a veil
I'm locked within myself

I, no longer know
The reasons why
My spirit's so
Hollow

I, no longer feel
Safe within myself
Allow me to let

As if the sky was dead
There's no light
No love
No life around
And I cry
About my past, my youth, my solitude

I fall, I stumble over
I can no longer face my mind

Don't you speak to me now
Tour words are so cold
I know, I won't survive
This is, the last dance, for me

The curtains have closed
I bid you farewell, farewell

As if the sky was dead
There's no light
No love
No life around
And I cry
About my past, my youth, my solitude

I fall, I stumble over
I can no longer face my mind
