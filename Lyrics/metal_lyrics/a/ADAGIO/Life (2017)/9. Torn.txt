[Music: StÃ©phan FortÃ©, lyrics: Kelly Carpenter]

Lost in the dark I wonder on
Forgetting hope never knowing light
Like a broken melody, I'll find no home
This never ending night

I'm calling, just crawling
Howling in desperation
But I'll pretend
As I descend through pain and fear

Promise me a bright tomorrow
Show me that my heart's not hollow
Cover my eyes whisper sweet lies
Help me twist the words 'til the truth dies
Promise me a bright tomorrow
Tell me that my heart's not hollow
Can't you hear my cries?
I'm trapped within this never ending night

Tell me why I must go ever on
So many tears fill the underground
Why won't you lift me up?
Been here so long
Or will I be left to drown?

I'm calling, just crawling
Howling in desperation
But I'll pretend
As I descend through pain and fear

Promise me a bright tomorrow
Show me that my heart's not hollow
Cover my eyes, whisper sweet lies
Help me twist the words 'til the truth dies
Promise me a bright tomorrow
Tell me that my heart's not hollow
Can't you hear my cries?
I'm trapped within this never ending night
