Feel my shadow on your wretched soul
The un-creator, maker of war
I will soon be marching on your ashes, cold
Heed my final warning

I unholy fire
Bringer of dreamless sleep
Call the bodies down like rain, silence every twisting tongue
And when â our dance is over, I'll grind your bones to dust
Blood and shame soak the land I tame as I teach the world to fear my name

Subrahmanya
From the land of the dead,
Your end awaits
Unleash the hounds of war
(Conquer and desecrate)
Subrahmanya
Mighty lord of Suras
I decimate
And only lust for more

Footfalls echo into my domain
Your prideful anger, I'll soon rip away
As I taste your anguish and devour your cries
With the hand of darkness, rain death from the skies

I unholy fire
Bringer of dreamless sleep
Call the bodies down like rain, silence every twisting tongue
And when â our dance is over, I'll grind your bones to dust
Blood and shame soak the land I tame as I teach the world to fear my name

Subrahmanya
From the land of the dead,
Your end awaits
Unleash the hounds of war
(Conquer and desecrate)
Subrahmanya
Mighty lord of Suras
I decimate
And only lust for more
