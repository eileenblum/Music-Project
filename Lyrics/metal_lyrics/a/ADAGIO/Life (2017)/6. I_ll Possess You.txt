[Music and lyrics: StÃ©phan FortÃ©]

Hold my breath as I capture your perfume
Tracing a line down your spine
Bid farewell to your lost soul in silence
Now grieve for your innocence

I'm craving for
The fragile beauty of your curves
Your purest thoughts
Are brading the whip you will serve

I have yearned for centuries to own you
Bleeding on and feeding on, and burning in love evermore
Sore, these dark skies together
Endlessly enslaved to me you're mine

While my hands are gripping your hair tight
Pleasure beads are dripping down your thighs
Bleeding nicely with the red of your blood
I'll honor you in, this exquisite flood

I'm craving for
The fragile beauty of your curves
Your purest thoughts
Are brading the whip you will serve

I have yearned for centuries to own you
Bleeding on and feeding on, and burning in love evermore
Sore, these dark skies together
Endlessly enslaved to me you're mine
