[Music and lyrics: StÃ©phan FortÃ©]

I shouldn't have trusted
Those tales they've been telling
Those ancient rumors were false
Now I'm in the dark
Obsessed by tomorrow
I'm feeling lonely, so lost

Don't look back to the past
Pain moves on
Time will keep moving fast
So climb the ladder

Now you just need to believe
The stars are not so far
The dream is just a step away
Follow the truth within and run
To shed those tears away
The stars are not so far, so high
Nightmares will someday fade away
Follow the dream within

Remember those arrows
Deep inside the core of your mind
Betrayal, treachery, this is over

Don't look back to the past
Pain moves on
Time will keep moving fast
So climb the ladder

Now you just need to believe
The stars are not so far
The dream is just a step away
Follow the truth within and run
To shed those tears away
The stars are not so far, so high
Nightmares will someday fade away
Follow the dream within
