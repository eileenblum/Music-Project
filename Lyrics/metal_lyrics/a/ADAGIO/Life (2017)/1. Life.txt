[Music: StÃ©phan FortÃ©, lyrics: Kelly Carpenter]

Onward weary traveller
Although the hopes you've sawn in my garden wither
Each promise of forever, so unkind
Now drink of the memories bitter

It seems you're climbing a ladder
Just to find your questions unanswered

On and on
Through storms you're raging
Even though your heart is breaking
Every scar you wear
A lesson that made you stronger

As you watch the curtain fall after the movie ends
Walk, and fear not the dark for it made you stronger

So you're one year colder
Regrets like lead upon your shoulders
A fool who dreams of wings, when only time can fly
Can't see innocence is over

On and on
Through storms you're raging
Even though your heart is breaking
Every scar you wear
A lesson that made you stronger

As you watch the curtain fall after the movie ends
Walk, and fear not the dark for it made you (stronger)
As you recover from the wounds and all the tears you've shed
Take heart, give thanks and believe

It seems you're climbing a ladder
Just to find your questions unanswered

On and on
Through storms you're raging
Even though your heart is breaking
Every scar you wear
A lesson that made you stronger

As you watch the curtain fall after the movie ends
Walk, and fear not the dark for it made you (stronger)
s you recover from the wounds and all the tears you've shed
Take heart, give thanks and believeï»¿
