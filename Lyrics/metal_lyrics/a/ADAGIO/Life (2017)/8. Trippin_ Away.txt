[Music and lyrics: StÃ©phan FortÃ©]

Washing away my sorrow was not an easy thing
My feelings were gone, dead, and insecure...
I would never have guessed on that night
Behind those doors, a smile
Would lift my heart so high

And I see you, cheering angel, smiling at me
And I feel that, our eyes could dance, endlessly

Two months have passed, another door, taking you in...
We're now alone, in silence, on the floor
Our lips are joining each other, sealing our hearts forever
Tripping away, deep, in a lava lamp

And I need you, to hold my hand until the end
And I want you, to be my one, forevermore

What if we could fall together
Touching the stars, trippin' into space
While we're kissing the sky
I don't want no other but you
To hold my hand 'til the end

And I miss you, when you're away, half of me is gone
And I love you, our rings are sealed, come what may

What if we could fall together
Touching the stars, trippin' into space
While we're kissing the sky
I don't want no other but you
To hold my hand 'til the end
