Come with me, don't be scared
I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride
Hellish dreams, it's the time
You've been all waiting for

Let me please show you the way
The grim reaper awaits
Flat fifth whistle announces
The deadly departure

Like a wrecking bone
The train is gone
Next station please
Fasten the belts
Three minutes left
To the fear circus

Do you feel the winter?
The frozen kiss awakens your sorrow
Leave behind those ancient towns
Forget, bring thy pain and mourn

Let me please show you the way
The grim reaper awaits
Flat fifth whistle announces
The deadly departure

Like a wrecking bone
The train is gone
Next station please
Fasten the belts
Three minutes left
To the fear circus
