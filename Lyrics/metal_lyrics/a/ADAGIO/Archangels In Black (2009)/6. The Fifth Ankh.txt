Immortal
Ten centuries since I'm resting with shadows
Can you feel me rise

I am the darkness
I am the vampire
I am the neverending flame

Impeding death
Beneath the lands
Those beliefs are true

Free the flame lost for so long
Rise

Bring the legend alive
Open your world to me

Be not afraid to dive
Soul is no longer free

Do you like what you see
Giant walls painted with blood
Those beliefs are true
Here lies the corpse of my enemies

I am the darkness
I am the vampire
I am the neverending flame

Impeding death
Beneath the lands
Those beliefs are true

Free the flame lost for so long
Rise

Bring the legend alive
Open your world to me

Be not afraid to dive
Soul is no longer free

Hypnotic
Resting under the stone
For thousand years
