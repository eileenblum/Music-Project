The sun is dying day by day
After the rain, before the pain
Dead legions storming on the way
To the war, Roar to better slay

I can barely see the end
May the angels look for me
The Armageddon legacy

And if I see the stars above
Then I will cross my arms in peace
Be with me, at my side
Don't leave me take me away

Masses are coming from the north
The undead smiles behave with pride
Now hords of doom announce the end
I'll meet you some day farwell

I can barely see the end
May the angels look for me
The Armageddon legacy

And if I see the stars above
Then I will cross my arms in peace
Be with me, at my side
Don't leave me take me away

And if the sun cries forever
Then I will mourn those glorious days
Be with me, at my side
Don't leave me take me away
