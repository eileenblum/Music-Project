I hear you
I feel you
Smell the fear, coming near behind you

I'll charm you
Animate you
A new crown of dawn forever

Bring me fire
Bring me darkness
Do not fight, just succumb to my bite

Blessing the dead upon my lands

To the shadows
Of the nightside
I offer this life with pride
To the shadows
Of the nightside
Dancing for death and she's my bride

I seek you
I've found you
Hear me scream never hope anymore

I am life
I am death
Balancing fire and ice
Beneath the time I drain your life

Hypocrit
Just a liar
I'm your pain

To the shadows
Of the nightside
I offer this life with pride

To the shadows
Of the nightside
Gather yourself before my name
