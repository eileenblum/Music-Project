As I walk through the valley
Surrounded
By a millions fire wings
The moon glows, (white) bright on the sand
Mysterious
Almighty legend, land of the slave

Even if lies are never told
Even if night grows cold
If only I could understand
The meaning of lines on sand

Dawn paralyze me, I need to feed the sheep becoming
Corps waking through me, tomorrows eve I'll purify in
Blood open the grave, no sacrifice, can avoid being
Night repenting, the mist is black, the moon (is) imploring death

Grab those chains, unlock the gates
Let me leave
Tie the rope and behave brave

Lurking sight inside my cell
I am one
Lycanthropic murder yet to come

Even if lies are never told
Even if night grows cold
If only I could understand
The meaning of lines on sand

Dawn paralyze me, I need to feed the sheep becoming
Corps waking through me, tomorrows eve I'll purify in
Blood open the grave, no sacrifice, can avoid being
Night repenting, the mist is black, the moon is imploring death
