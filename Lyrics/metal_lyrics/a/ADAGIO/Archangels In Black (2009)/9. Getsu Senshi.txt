Watch the rising moon climbing far over the hills
May the light shine forever
Is there a sign to follow?
Avoid sorrow, carry me

Give me strength to carry on
Give me strength to carry on
Lit the candle to the night
I will walk within the dark
With the fire in my heart
Reaching the power of the truth

Come with me
Come with me and see
Come with me
Rising high in the sky

Come with me
Come with me and see
Say my name and you will see
My world inside

Time is still passing by
While the emptiness stands
I can no longer hide
My lonely feelings inside
Driving me mad
I'll follow

Give me strength to carry on
Give me strength to carry on
Lit the candle to the night
I will walk within the dark
With the fire in my heart
Reaching the power of the truth

Come with me
Come with me and see
Come with me
Rising high in the sky

Come with me
Come with me and see
Say my name and you will see
My world inside
