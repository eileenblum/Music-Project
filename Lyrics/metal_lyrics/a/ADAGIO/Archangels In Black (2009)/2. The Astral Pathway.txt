Day after day
Night after night
Creeping the smiles in the mirror
Obsessed by light
I'm in disguise
No more behaviour

Glittering stars
High in the sky
A million lights shining though
Misunderstood, a last goodbye

Picturing the past

Touching the clouds in heaven
Passing the season
Crossing the astral pathway
Blessing the night

And if the stars accepts us
I'll be one of them

Day is crying in the sky
Wash away my sinful eyes

Stand with me, I will carry out your sorrow
Stand with me, I will make your way through shadow
Don't ask me why
Never return

Centuries have past
Dying of dawn
Our mysteries rise from above
I'm one of them, I am their king.....

Touching the clouds in heaven
Passing the season
Crossing the astral pathway
Blessing the night

And if the stars accepts us
I'll be one of them
Day is crying in the sky
Wash away my sinful eyes
