Midnight has passed, those streets are cold,
Emptiness
I can hear voices in my back
Silent footsteps

Need to feed
Rotten corps and flesh
Devouring
Wormy earth keeps moving in stone

At, the next corner an old man appear
Is it me, is it him, is it fear?
I'm a lamb in the middle of wolves
There's no further life round here

Crawling and lurking everywhere
I'm not alone
Rough smell of death perfumes the air
I am eaten

Dig the tomb
In the heart like flesh
Burn the grave
Skin's exploding on stone

At, the next corner an old man appear
Is it me, is it him, is it fear?
I'm a lamb in the middle of wolves
There's no further life round here
