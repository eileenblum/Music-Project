Stay with me,
this night I'm afraid of death.
Stay with me,
I need to feel your hands.
I only want to be,
I only want to be,
and to run over my thought
with your love,
your love.
Stay with me,
on my quiet way.
Stay with me,
without saying a word.
This is my bet:
I want to change my life for you
and for your eyes,
with my strength...

AND MAYBE THE SKY
IS STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU,
MAYBE THE SKY
IS STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

First of all,
I want to fly over your pain.
First of all,
I want to stay down inside.
And then cry again,
again, again
and run over your thought,
with my love,
my love.
First of all,
I want to fly over your fear.
First of all,
I want to see your tenderness.
This is my bet:
I want to change my life for you
and for your eyes,
with my strength...
