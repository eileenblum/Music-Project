The sea is like a sheet
of glass, in this strange night,
but I'm so tired
as not be able to think.
I pray, I pray God it won't happen again.
Stupid tragedy.
Sword! I don't know where to begin!
Oh mother!...

"WARRIOR,
OPEN YOUR EYES,
THE WHEATHER LOOKS THREATENING.
WARRIOR,
OPEN YOUR EYES,
YOU ARE GREAT!"

Look at me! I'm a machine,
a perfect thing for you.
Look at me! I'm the death,
I'm the glory for your heart.
I pray, I pray God it won't happen again.
Stupid tragedy.
Sword! I don't know where to begin!
Oh mother!...

"WARRIOR,
OPEN YOUR EYES,
THE WHEATHER LOOKS THREATENING.
WARRIOR,
OPEN YOUR EYES,
YOU ARE GREAT!"
