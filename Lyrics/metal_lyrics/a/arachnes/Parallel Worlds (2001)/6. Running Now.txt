It's the moment to go,
I believe in me,
I wanna to change all my life.
It's the moment to say,
I believe in you,
the world is, now, in my hands.

Your face and your smile now are fine,
I'm living my strength, to believe,
oh...

RUNNING NOW,
RUNNING NOW,
OVER ALL THE FEARS,
DEEP INSIDE,
DEEP INSIDE,
IT'S TIME TO BELIEVE.

It's the moment to be,
I believe in me,
I wanna to change all my dreams.
It's the moment to love,
I believe in you,
because life is here, life is this.
