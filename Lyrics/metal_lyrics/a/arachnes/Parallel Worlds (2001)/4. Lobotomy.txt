To look at oneself in the mirror,
and to see all the history in one's own.
To look danger in the face,
to look at oneself and to die.
And in my old mind,
fog, a dazing noise;
I must escape,
it's not my end...

What a fear!
what a dread!
what a fear,
I'm afraid of death!
What a fear!
what a dread!
what a fear,
I'm afraid of fear!
"The boy was as good as gold,
the boy was as good as gold,
TRUTH!
Never tell a lie!"

MY MADNESS IS BREAD, WATER, LIFE;
MY MADNESS IS YOUR SALVATION, NOW.

To look at oneself in the sky,
tasting the flight and the tenderness.
Love, and love, and love,
everything is so heavy and dark.
And in my new brain,
fog, a dazing noise;
I must escape,
it's not my life...
