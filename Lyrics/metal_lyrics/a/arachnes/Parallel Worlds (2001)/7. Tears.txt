I like the peace of this place,
the calm, the calm, of the sea;
the stillness of the night,
the stillness of the air, when there is no wind.
And this song is my mountain, my old refuge;
and now I need to take a rest, with my tears.....

You don't know anything
at all about me!
It's the same situation as before;
nothing has changed.
But the sky is here, beyond my and your triviality,
beyond the difference between the right and the wrong.....
