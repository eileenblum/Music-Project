Opening my eyes,
in a dull and normal day,
I was saying to myself:
God, I need you!
Somebody to love,
and something to preserve,
I can afford it, my God!

I'm walking about the town,
I'm walking in the middle of the steel.
All is mighty,
all is so wonderful.
And yet, it's incredible,
this is not the world, life:
they're all pretexts,
because life is in the sky.

Without a number, a word,
just loving the light and the sun...

STARS AND PLANETS, OVER ALL THE WILL,
THEY MOVE IN THE UNIVERSE.
BUT WE'RE HERE WITH OUR STUPID MONEY,
WE ARE FAT,
WE'RE ALONE,
WITHOUT LOVE.

Desperately,
I'm walking on the road,
all is mighty,
all is so wonderful.
And yet, it's incredible,
this is not the world, life:
they're all pretexts,
because life is in the sky.
