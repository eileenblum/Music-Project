Where,
but where are you going? In loneliness,
it's dangerous, my girl, and you know it.
Is not the right time to live so free,
the sea and the sky are dark...
You,
you must believe:
our freedom is so big, and is so great...
The night is deep,
your sun is black... Take your dream!

O ARACHNE, ADYNATON,
O ARACHNE, ADESPOTOS;
ENKOMIOS, EPIKEDEION,
EPINIKION.

Light, over (the) black,
open your hands, pray your God!
Where,
but where is your strength? Where is your dash?
We need to believe in you, my God!
You're (the) first woman, we love you for that,
against the convention and the law.
