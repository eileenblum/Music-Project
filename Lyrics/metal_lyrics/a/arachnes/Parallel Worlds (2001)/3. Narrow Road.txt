Welcome, my sweet Queen.
Tonight you're so fine,
but your face is black.
Darling, I need you,
I need your strangeness,
tell me something, now.

Yes, maybe I'm crazy,
but this is my life,
and I want to survive.
I feel tired,
nothing keeps me here,
and this night is for me...

IN THE LABYRINTH OF MY MIND
I SEE ALL (THE) FEAR OF MY DREAMS.
WITH MY GUITAR,
WHILE I'M A CHILD,
I'M GOING INTO THIS NARROW ROAD.

Welcome, my viper:
This is my new sword:
a strange sequence of notes.
This is a new day,
and the sun is here,
on your white body.
