It's a wonder! It's wonderful!
This is the town life.
Telephone, and free will and light.....
a forced sale, and maybe.....
a sheet steel!

NOW, I WANT TO BE FREE,
TO BREAK THIS FINE FACE
AND ALL THE STYLISH SHIT.
NOW, I WANT TO BE MAD,
TO BREAK THIS FINE PALACE.
NOW, I WANT TO BE FREE.

It's a wonder! It's wonderful!
A black sky without stars.
A sea without salt and life,
and a neurotic rise.....
a sheet steel!
