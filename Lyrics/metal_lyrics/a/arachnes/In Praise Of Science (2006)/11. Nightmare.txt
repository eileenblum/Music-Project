It's complicated, the streets are full,
and I look at the sky, tonight;
all the things are so dark, and the air is strange,
my heart is strange, and then...

My life is an incessant work,
and the time is an old enemy,
while the dreams are running in my mind,
and the future is a snag...

And sensual lips
on the big play-bill,
but where is my life?,
and where is my time?

GOD, A RED, RED SKY,
A NIGHTMARE IN MY TIRED EYES.
LIE, A BLACK, BLACK LIE,
I NEED A REAL CLEARNESS, NOW!

Like in a dream, the streets are sad,
and I look at the sea, tonight;
and in my pockets there is a song,
a sweet music, but then...
