Sometimes, I'm looking down, on the floor,
I go without useless things around me, around me;
and maybe I'm crazy, maybe I'm crazy, yes,
but I need silence, I need a sweet absence...

Let me go, my love, let me go in my darkness,
because I need to know again, to know again...

I PLAY WITH THE DARK SIDE OF MY MIND,
AND I EXORCIZE THE MONSTERS OF YOUR INTRINSIC HATE,
AND I WILL LOVE YOUR EYES WITH ALL MY SCORN,
WITHOUT FEAR AND WITHOUT CANT, BECAUSE MY SOUL IS FREE!

... And now I'm looking over the stars,
and a little child are singing in my heart.
Oh no!, it's my brain, and this is the key, my friend,
to know our mind to love the things, the world, the life!
