You're tell me now, but my mind it's not here,
I'm looking down, yes I know, I'm sorry;
there is a light in your eyes, in these days,
a strange light of hate. And I think to our love.

... Going to the true with my pain,
looking right, now, with a new strength;
with a rock symphony here, in my heart,
and I believe in my life, so...

I'M CLOSING MY EYES
TO SEE OVER MY MIND,
I'M CLOSING MY SOUL
TO FEEL OVER MY SOUL.

... And your words are wind for my ears, in this time,
I need to be free, I just need myself;
and fuck you!, fuck you!, let's me go to my way,
my wonderful hands now are closed for you!
