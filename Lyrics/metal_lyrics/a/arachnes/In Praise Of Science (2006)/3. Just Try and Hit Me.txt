You, you are feeling the hate of your girl
While the television is glad
There is a stupid face without expression
Like in a mahlerian symphony

And today the sun is very fine
The air is very light
While you are like a big shit
And the air is light again

WHEN YOUR EYES ARE FULL
WHEN THE COLOUR OF YOUR LIFE
IS LIKE A BORING MORNING
WITHOUT A SWEET CONTRETEMPS

Take your notes and close your eyes tonight
While the television is glad
Now, you are the king of all the things
Like in a mahlerian symphony

And today the sun is very fine
The air is very light
While you are like a big shit
And the air is light again

WHEN YOUR EYES ARE FULL
WHEN THE COLOUR OF YOUR LIFE
IS LIKE A BORING MORNING
WITHOUT A SWEET CONTRETEMPS
JUST TRY AND HIT ME
AND MAKE A BETTER USE OF YOUR NOTES
BECAUSE THE MUSIC IS LIKE A GUN-SHOT
IN THE SOUL OF ONE OF US
