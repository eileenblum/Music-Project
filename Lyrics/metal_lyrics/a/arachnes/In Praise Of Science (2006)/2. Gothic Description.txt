A child in the womb,
magic silence of the life,
easy, like the sky and the sea,
always.
Day after day,
step by step, the things are clear,
the white, the black, and the time,
again.

Then, I take my heart, or my brain, and I feel all
the calm and the peace, wandering love, of the wait,...
wait...
wait...

GOTHIC DESCRIPTION
OF A MELODY LIKE A JUST WAR,
FLASHBACK IN MY EYES
AND NUMBERS WITHOUT A PLACING.
GOTHIC DESCRIPTION,
I NEED A NEW POINT OF VIEW,
LINEAR PERSPECTIVE,
NEW TOOLS AND NEW RELIGION.

A child in my arms,
magic knowledge on the skin,
easy, like the water and the wind,
always.
And now I know.
The liquid strength is in the hands,
the life is in the hands.
Just.
