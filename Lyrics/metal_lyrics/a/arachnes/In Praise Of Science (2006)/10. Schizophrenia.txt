My house is a great black sky
And I look at the things with my eyes of ice
My life is an empty cage
And my dreams are full of disjointed numbers

One. I go in the streets
Of my town with my magic brain, tonight
Two. Two souls and two formality
To see over without suffering...

... AND A DOUBLE LIFE, AND A DOUBLE MIND
DICHOTOMY, SECTIONING, NEED
A SCHIZOPHRENIA FOR YOU AN ME
AND PERFECT SONS, IN A SWEET DEATH!

In the eyes of the people, that
In the world and in a noble deed, madness
The madness of honest people
Without a dream, without somebody to love

One. I go in the streets
Of my town with my magic brain, tonight
Two. Two souls and two formality
To see over without suffering...

... AND A DOUBLE LIFE, AND A DOUBLE MIND
DICHOTOMY, SECTIONING, NEED
A SCHIZOPHRENIA FOR YOU AN ME
AND PERFECT SONS, IN A SWEET DEATH!
