The time
is like an hammer on me,
I taste a love without solution for us.
Fine,
like your black eyes,
like our days and your smile,
and we know, there is another life...

HERE,
YOU'RE WITH ME IN A SECRET SKY,
IN THE THINGS OF ALL THE DAYS;
I TAKE YOU,
AND YOU TAKE ME,
WITH ALL OUR LOVE.

Light
everywhere,
while the night tell of your life,
and tell of your life
slow,
like your slight hands,
hands that are skimming the waves,
and we know, there is another life...

HERE,
YOU'RE WITH ME IN A SECRET SKY,
IN THE THINGS OF ALL THE DAYS;
I TAKE YOU,
AND YOU TAKE ME,
WITH ALL OUR FAIRNESS.
