I know how brave you are,
I know how fine you are...
rocks, for me, for one of us,
and ice in our ankylosed brains.

I need to feel cold on my skin,
cold in my mind,
and to see things from high.
I need higher mathematics,
like all the men.

TAKE A TOP OF THE KING FOR YOU,
IT'S AN EASY THING, (A) SURE BARGAIN!
LONELINESS OF A WARRIOR.
(AND) YOUR LIFE WILL BE LIKE THIS LIGHT.

So, like in an Apocalypse
my world maybe destroyed,
because I will know the truth...
sky, I'm a new child for your days...
