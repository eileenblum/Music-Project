The little ghosts are here
in our minds;
and I know that,
I know my madness.
I'm walking on this black floor,
over my eyes,
over a dirty life.
Over (the) darkness.

MAYBE IT'S MY DESTINY,
AND THIS LIFE IS JUST A STOP.
MAYBE IT'S MY MORNING, NOW,
BECAUSE I BELIEVE THERE IS A GOD.

And now I'm here with you,
this is my life;
and you know all of me,
all of my dreams.
You, music, with your notes,
and with your smile.
I want your liquid hands,
just for me!
