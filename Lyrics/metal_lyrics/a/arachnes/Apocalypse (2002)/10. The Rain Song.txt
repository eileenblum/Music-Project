Water,
oh water
I need your sweet caress...

When...
I am a sick child, a sad man;
I am an eagle without wings.
I taste my pain day after day,
and I feel an old blade...
then, then I am sure...
I want your strength.

STORM IN MY MIND,
STORM IN MY EYES AND IN MY SOUL.
THE SONG OF THE RAIN IS MY CHARM.

While...
I am a fool in this white room;
I am a dolphin with no sea.
I taste my pain day after day,
and I feel an old blade...
then, then I am sure...
I want your strength.
