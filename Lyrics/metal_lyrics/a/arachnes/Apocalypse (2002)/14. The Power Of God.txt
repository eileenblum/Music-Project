You,
you are a little thing in this world,
feeble light in the universe,
misunderstood voice in the darkness,
in the middle of (the) planets and (the) stars...
Fear,
fear and suspicion hold sway,
but there's no trace of enemies,
and there's no danger for us...
this is an image of our mind...

BECAUSE THE RAYS OF THE SUN
ARE WARMING (THE) EARTH AGAIN;
BECAUSE THE RAYS OF THE MOON
ARE HERE, WITH ME AGAIN.
GOD, THE POWER OF GOD IS IN YOUR EYES,
GOD, THE POWER OF GOD IS IN MY MIND.

We,
we are a little thing in the sky,
feeble light in the universe,
think of it better, my friend!
the sea and the ocean are alive.
Dread,
dread and suspicion hold sway,
but there's no trace of a new end,
and there's no danger for you...
this is an image of your mind...
