I have enough,
I have enough for all;
come friend,
you must listen to me, please.
This is my trip...
a book in my hands,
and a little sweet talisman.

So, 
I can believe
in the creatures of this landscape,
free, 
without a lord and a clock,
just me and my life,
somebody to love, 
to dream, and now...

NOW, I'M DANCING WITH AN IMAGE,
AND THIS ROOM IS NOT EMPTY
LIKE THE MIND OF A CRAZY GUY.
AND NO, THERE ARE NO LIMITS FOR THAT,
LIKE AN INFERNAL DANCE,
I CAN FEEL A NEW BREATHING.

You have enough,
you have enough for all,
and you need a new drug, 
a new end.
But if you want to live,
if you want to live and to understand,
take my hand, we can cry and laugh again...
