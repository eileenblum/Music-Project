Now I know,
this is the end, the monster is here, with us.
Yes I know,
the sky is black, like the hate in our brains.
But our God knows good and the evil,
the sky and the ocean, the light and the darkness,
and all the creatures of the earth, and the sea,
and all our misery.
Over the rainbow and over the storms,
over all questions and silly desires,
now I am free, now you are free to love...

STRENGTH, THE STRENGTH OF WORDS,
THE WORDS OF THE WISE,
THIS IS THE ONLY ESCAPE.
STRENGTH, THE STRENGTH OF WORDS,
THE WORDS OF THE WISE,
THIS IS THE ONLY ESCAPE HERE!

Now I know,
I have to rest my eyes and to rest my hands.
Yes I know,
I have to rest my soul and to rest my mind.
