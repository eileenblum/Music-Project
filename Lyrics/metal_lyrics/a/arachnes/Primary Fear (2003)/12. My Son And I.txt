My son and I close the house,
And we look (at) the rain from the window,
We look (at) the rain from the window.
My son and I  close the eyes,
And we're dream a train to run,
A train to run over the wall.

WE PLAY A ROCK, TONIGHT,
AND A SYMPHONY FOR US,
SO WE'RE FREE;
AND NO CRY, MY SON,
IF OUR SEA IS SO FAR AWAY,
IT'S SO FAR AWAY, AGAIN.

My son and I  play with life,
With words and with our face,
With smile of the books on the floor.
And we know the name of the stars,
The secret love of a tree,
(and) the pain of the children in the world.

WE PLAY A ROCK, TONIGHT,
AND A SYMPHONY FOR US,
SO WE'RE FREE;
AND NO CRY, MY SON,
BECAUSE THE SEA NOW IS HERE,
IT'S HERE FOR YOU AND I.

WE PLAY A ROCK, TONIGHT,
AND A SYMPHONY FOR US,
SO WE'RE FREE;
AND NOW YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH ME,
AND OUR FEAR IS SO FAR AWAY,
LIKE THE TEARS OF OUR OLD DARKNESS.
