I feel a thing in my mind,
And it's strange for me.
I feel a war in my soul,
Something to shake.
My hearth is full of a new hate,
And it's very good:
Now I'm ready

I'M BREAKING SUGARY IMAGES,
SAINTS, AND AN OLD WORLD,
I'M BREAKING THE PUPPET STRINGS,
I CAN DO IT NOW!

To escape death, to escape death,
Running into the fear.
To be the eyes of a child,
And to reset all.
