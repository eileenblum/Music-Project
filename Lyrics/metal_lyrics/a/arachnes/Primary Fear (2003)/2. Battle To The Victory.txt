Thank, my God,
For all the things in our life,
And for this song,
And the strength that now I'm feeling.
Oh, my Lord,
Sometime I think that the world is not right,
When I see the children
Without water and bread

.. THIS IS MY BATTLE TO THE VICTORY,
BECAUSE I LOVE, BECAUSE I LOVE!

Listen to my prayer,
Mercy for them, no for my pain,
Mercy for a sky without stars
And without dreams.
