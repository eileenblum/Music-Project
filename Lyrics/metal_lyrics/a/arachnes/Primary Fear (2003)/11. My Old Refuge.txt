Dark road, without lights and tears,
Things without a solution, dear,
My soul is full of that, now,
And your soul too, yes I know.
Where is the sun of the hope, my God?
Where is the smile of an easy song?
With a secret dream in my hands,
I'm calling your name, I'm calling your name:

BUT YOU ARE SO FAR AWAY,
LIKE A LONG KISS ON OUR SKIN,
AND MAYBE YOU ARE SLEEPING, NOW,
ON THE WHITE FLOOR OF THE MEMORIES,
WHILE I'M CALLING YOUR NAME, AGAIN:

Why you are my old refuge,
Why we remember our words.
And I will be in your black eyes,
Black like this night, like this days.
