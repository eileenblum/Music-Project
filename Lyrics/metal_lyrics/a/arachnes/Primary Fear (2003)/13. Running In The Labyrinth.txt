The notes are falling now,
Like an heavy thing,
I take this dream, again,
The smile of a new song.
But tears streamed down her face,
But tears streamed down her face.

RUNNING IN THE LABYRINTH,
OVER A USELESS TIME,
STEADY HAMMERING,
I WILL FLY AGAIN.

And I will be the winner,
Of a raving life,
And I will know the things,
The white and black of death.
