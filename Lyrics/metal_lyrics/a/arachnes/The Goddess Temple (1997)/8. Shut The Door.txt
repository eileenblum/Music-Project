Shut the door,
shut your suitcase and come along,
we can't carry on like this.
Money, money,
(eh) I don't care about it,
I want to live to be old;
to fly in the sky over the town,
I would kill myself rather than give in.

SO, WITH MY MUSIC I CAN BE FREE,
AND I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO BE FREE;
SO WITH MY MADNESS I CAN BELIEVE,
AND I'D GIVE ANITHING TO BELIEVE.

Nothing ever
happens in this quiet land,
and my work is very foolish.
Money, money,
(eh) I don't care about it,
I want to live to be old;
to fly in the sky over the town,
I would kill myself rather than give in.

SO, WITH MY MUSIC I CAN BE FREE, AND I'D GIVE ANYTHING TO BE FREE;
SO WITH MY MADNESS I CAN BELIEVE,
AND I'D GIVE ANITHING TO BELIEVE.
