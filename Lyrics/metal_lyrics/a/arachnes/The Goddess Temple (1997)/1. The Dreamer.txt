"Hello, my tree, how are you?
I would like to say a word to you,
I just want to tell you that:
now I need your wisdom.
[PRE.]
I'm a dreamer without dreams,
I know the Earth and I know the sea;
maybe I'm a painter with no brush
and silence is my canvas:"

[INC.]
SHOUT,
OVER YOUR STORM,
OVER YOUR NIGHT,
OLD WORDS AND STRONG WINE IN YOUR HEART;
YOU, LIKE A CHILD,
WITH YOUR BIG EYES,
YOU ARE THE (ONLY) WINNER.

"It'll go all for the best,
over my storms and my nights.
I just want to tell you that:
now I need your big strength".

[PRE.]
