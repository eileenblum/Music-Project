Little dream of my life,
today I want to cry.
I want to do a special thing,
to feel only my thought.
Light, i need the light of the dream,
God, I need my sure castle, and dry:

THE BLACK RAIN!

But I'm feeling the darkness,
in expectation of the truth;
maybe this is the faith of the men,
so we are still here.
Light, I need the light of the dream,
God, I need my sure castle, and dry...

THE BLACK RAIN!
