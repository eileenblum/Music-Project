Hello, my dear,
now I must go,
I feel your skin in my hands.

Hello, my dear,
I want you again,
but our life is a strange thing.

Blind,
I'm lost, in your shining eyes,
while
a gold blade waits in my brain.

I NEED YOUR SWEET SCENT,
FOR EVER AND EVER,
I NEED YOUR DARK SOUL.

Take me again,
I am here with you,
touch my light shadow.

Fate, fate, fate,
you can't escape your fate,
I am the king of your secret nights.

Blind,
I'm lost, in your shining eyes,
while
a gold blade waits in my brain.

I NEED YOUR SWEET SCENT,
FOR EVER AND EVER,
I NEED YOUR DARK SOUL.
