The dawn is here,
and my eyes are ready
for a new day, and a new tale...
And you, again,
are over the sky, in an other world,
in the dimension of the time...

...And so your sweet hands,
and so your fine smile;
I'm working in this morning,
and you know...

MY FACE IS HARD, MY DEAR,
BECAUSE THE LIFE IS A STRANGE
GAME, A SWEET PLAY,
WITH ALL THE SURPRISE, LITTLE
STEPS, LIKE OUR EYES,
LIKE OUR LOVE...

And the dawn is clear,
like your old words in my power
mind, in a strange destiny.
But your voice and all our things
are here, with me,
while a number flows on the screen...

...And so your sweet hands,
and so your fine smile;
I'm working in this morning,
and you know...

MY FACE IS HARD, MY DEAR,
BECAUSE THE LIFE IS A STRANGE
GAME, A SWEET PLAY,
WITH ALL THE SURPRISE, LITTLE
STEPS, LIKE OUR EYES,
LIKE OUR LOVE...
