There is a song with a child and his
daddy, with a symphony, without sea.
And all this is so magic, so,
like a day after another night.

And this song is a prayer for you,
a sweet melody for our life.
Notes of childs, notes of a great heart
and hands, a sweet music, and sweet
music for all our new days...

NOW, TAKE YOUR LIFE, TAKE
THE THINGS AND ALL YOUR
DREAMS, BECAUSE THE WORLD
IS THAT YOU SEE AND YOU FEEL.
NOW, TAKE YOUR HEART, TAKE
THE THINGS AND YOUR LIFE,
BECAUSE THE SEA, MAYBE, THE
SEA NOW IS HERE, NOW IS
HERE...

There are words, there are words
and things, and a rock for you and
for me.

And this song is a prayer for you,
a sweet melody for our life. Notes
of childs, notes of a great heart and
hands, a sweet music, a sweet

NOW, TAKE YOUR LIFE, TAKE
THE THINGS AND ALL YOUR
DREAMS, BECAUSE THE WORLD
IS THAT YOU SEE AND YOU FEEL.
NOW, TAKE YOUR HEART, TAKE
THE THINGS AND YOUR LIFE,
BECAUSE THE SEA, MAYBE, THE
SEA NOW IS HERE, NOW IS
HERE...
