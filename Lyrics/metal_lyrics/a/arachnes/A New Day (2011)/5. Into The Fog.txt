Like in a dream,
to be a thing, or to be wind.
Like in the fog,
I feel all my white skin.
Like in a sea,
and my water... over me!

A new world is possible,
if you believe in you, and a sky in
your red hands, for all the days to
taste...
I go in this way, easy like a child,
easy like the time...

NUMBERS IN THE BRAINS
OF THE PEOPLE WITHOUT
SAINTS AND IMAGES,
ALL IS LIKE IN A BIG MOVIE, FINE;
WORDS AND WORDS IN
ALL THE STREETS OF THE TOWNS
WITHOUT A LOVE, ROLLING
THINGS WITHOUT FREE AND
NEW SOUL!

And a new life is here, if I believe in
me, and a sea in my hands, for my
little son...
I go in this way, easy like a child,
easy like the time...

NUMBERS IN THE BRAINS
OF THE PEOPLE WITHOUT
SAINTS AND IMAGES,
ALL IS LIKE IN A BIG MOVIE, FINE;
WORDS AND WORDS IN
ALL THE STREETS OF THE TOWNS
WITHOUT A LOVE, ROLLING
THINGS WITHOUT FREE AND
NEW SOUL!
