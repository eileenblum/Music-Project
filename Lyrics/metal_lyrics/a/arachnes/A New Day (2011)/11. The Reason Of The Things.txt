Now I see over my life,
now I feel the reason of the things...

...And the world is easy,
and it's so, all is a little thing...

MY DEAR, (THE) DEATH IS A FACT
OF (THE) LIFE, AND THE LIGHT IS
ALL IN OUR SOUL!

...Because we are animals, yes, but in
my pockets there's love...

...And the world is easy,
and it's so, all is a little thing...

MY DEAR, (THE) DEATH IS A FACT
OF (THE) LIFE, AND THE LIGHT IS
ALL IN OUR SOUL!
