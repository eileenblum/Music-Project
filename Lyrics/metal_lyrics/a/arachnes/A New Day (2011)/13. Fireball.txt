[originally by Deep Purple]The golden light above You show me where You're from,
the magic in your eye bewitches all You gaze upon.
You stand up on your hill and be bop all around You.
They wonder where You're from oh yeah
They wonder where I found You.
Oh my love It's a, long way,
where You're from It's a long way.

I tried to understand You, I tried to love You right.
The way You smile and touch me always sets my heart alight.
Your lips are like a fire wire, burning thru' my soul,
and people ask me where You're from
They really wanna know.
Oh my soul It's a, long way,
where You're from It's a long way.

Maaaaagic woman wreckin' up my soul,
things You tell me have never been told.
Magic woman I don't know,
electric before me I love you so I love you so.

You're raging like a fireball, dancing like a ghost,
You're gemini and I don't know which one I like the most.
My head is getting broken and my mind is getting burst,
but now I'm coming with You down the road of golden dust.
Oh my love It's a, long way,
where You're from It's a long way.

The golden light above You show me where You're from,
the magic in your eye bewitches all You gaze upon.
You stand up on your hill and be bop all around You.
They wonder where You're from oh yeah
They wonder where I found You.
Oh my love It's a, long way,
where You're from It's a long way.
