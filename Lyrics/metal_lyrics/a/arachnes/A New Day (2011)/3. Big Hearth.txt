Welcome my dear,
I'm here again,
with my old pain,
and notes in my hands.

...AND WITH A NEW STRENGTH
IN MY BIG HEART,  THE STRENGTH
OF A THING OVER THE WALL!

And I feel all,
all the light of that,
because my life
is full of a new love...

...AND WITH A NEW STRENGTH
IN MY BIG HEART,  THE STRENGTH
OF A THING OVER THE WALL!
