I need a new thing, I need a light,
the time it's going, and now I'm
here, and I need a God.
With my notes, colours, and sea,
and the sky...

And I take this life, and I take this
days, and in my white hands,
just numbers, now.
With my notes, colours, and sea,
and the sky...

I need a new thing for my days and
for my nights, because the life is
going, is going without a line.

Listen me, God, I am a new man, a
new man, but I need your hands, I
need your strength.

RUNNING IN AN OLD TOWN
WITHOUT NEW LIGHTS AND
WITHOUT SOUL,
DREAMING A NEW TIME AND
SOMETHING TO BELIEVE!

And sky and sea over my eyes, over
my mind, I need a new fire for my
soul and for my heart.

Listen me, God, I am a new man, a
new man, but I need your hands, I
need your strength.

RUNNING IN AN OLD TOWN
WITHOUT NEW LIGHTS AND
WITHOUT SOUL,
DREAMING A NEW TIME AND
SOMETHING TO BELIEVE!
