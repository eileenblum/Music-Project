It's dark, here, and (the) time
is slow like people's eyes.
Eyes without a way,
without a sky, without a star.
But my soul is full of a liquid smile,
and this is my life, my world...

AND I'M THE WINNER,
BECAUSE I KNOW THE DARKNESS;
NOW I'M A WINNER,
BECAUSE I TASTE YOUR SEA!

And so, over all the thing,
I see the light and the words.
And so, over all the pain,
I feel my love for you...
But my soul is full of a liquid smile,
and this is my life, my world...

AND I'M THE WINNER,
BECAUSE I KNOW THE DARKNESS;
NOW I'M A WINNER,
BECAUSE I TASTE YOUR SEA!
