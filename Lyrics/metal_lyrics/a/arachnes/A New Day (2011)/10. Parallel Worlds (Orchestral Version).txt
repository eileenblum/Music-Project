I really remember.
A strange sensation in my mind:
over the rainbow,
without God and without false religion.
And to look at the world,
to break the bonds in a sad, long night,
and unexpectedly to see
the white and the black of my life.

FUTURE, AND MIDDLE AGES,
I WANT TO CROSS BOTH, NOW.

Because, in this way
and just in this way, my soul will be free,
over my hate,
without saints and without false compassion.
And to look at the world,
to break the bonds in a sad, long night,
and unexpectedly to see
the white and the the black of my life.

FUTURE, AND MIDDLE AGES,
I WANT TO CROSS BOTH, NOW.
