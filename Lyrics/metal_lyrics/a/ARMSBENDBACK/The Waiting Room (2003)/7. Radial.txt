Can't wait for the day when we fall in love again
cause to be a friend is the best medicine
For love that ends and love that begins
so take my hands and let's move on
You are all I ever needed so take my hand and lets move on
Hand in hand we loved each other dispite all of lifes pressures
Don't change your mind please say that you'll stay
I can't wait for the day when you come my way
and just like before we'll love each other
And it's all I ever needed you're all I ever needed
