Shut up I hate
Now did you think it would bother me
I can honestly agree that you weren't in love with me
I'm dying
I believe that you aren't ordinary your living in a dream 
I believe that you've been playing around with my heart
Now do you have something to say even though we don't agree
Alls you do is walk away I'm drowning
I can't think about anything but you
Shut up I hate you
