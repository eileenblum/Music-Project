I'm feeling a distance something I never thought could be
Help me I'm changing help me I need your sympathy
Won't you save me and take me in take me in
If you say what a waste then take me in 
I'm asking
It gets harder the more that you don't believe in me
Hate me for quiting don't hate me for falling on my knees
Won't you save me and take me in take me in
If you say what a waste then take me in 
I'm asking
