I want to live inside you to see just what you see
It would feel so relaxing to know that you're with me
And it feels so good to live my life through your eyes
I look at who I am and I look at who you are
I cry to be just like you whatever you've become
And it feels so good to live my life through your eyes
It's all that I ask for so give me what I need
And it feels so good to live my life through your eyes
