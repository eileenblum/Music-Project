Running round and round 
ake me lose my mind any time now any time now
Make me scream and shout
make me blow my mount any time now
You made a way to shine my heart you know it's easy
You make me want to shine my heart you know it's easy
How can I avoid what I can't control any time now any time now
This is simply the best day that I know
and it's fine now any time now
The way you look at me I'm going crazy
