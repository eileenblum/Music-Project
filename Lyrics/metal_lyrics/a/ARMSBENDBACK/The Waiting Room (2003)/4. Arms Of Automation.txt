When a fool begins to explain he's in love
Where's the sympathy when he feels he should give up
Well I patiently wait for you
Where does truth begin when you know that it hurts
All the time you spent you feel it's time to give up
I know you'll never come
My arms will not take hold of you 
But instead of giving up I wait
I patiently wait for you in the dark 
To fall into my arms
When a fool begins to explain he's in love
Where's the sympathy when he feels he should give up
I know you'll never come
My arms will not take hold of you 
But instead of giving up 
I waited all my life for this
I wait
