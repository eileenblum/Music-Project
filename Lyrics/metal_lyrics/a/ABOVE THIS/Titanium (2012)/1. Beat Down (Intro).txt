Step back, this is our offering
If I could change the world Iâd stop the suffering
Step back, This is my final bow
My hands were meant to break, can we not do this now
Step back, I canât believe my eyes
My walls are standing tall, your walls are shaded lies
Step back, how is this relevant?
I canât afford your loss, just stop the arguement
Step back, Iâll fucking beat you down
Your walking down my streets I wear the fucking crown
Step back, who do you think you are?
If I canât take the heat, how did I get this far?

[4x]
Time will always win

If you listen to me Iâll tell you useful things
That you could take away and bring another day
Your brain is common minds, and if itâs worth the crime
You could just take a seat, and let the chorus speak
They say I grew up too fast, How the fuck did I last
That I was up to no good, I think itâs understood
That this is way past date, and if you fucking hate
I got my fingers up, cause I donât give a fuck

[2x]
I am a king where I come from, and weâre packing titanium

[2x]
Oh, Let me introduce myself

Bow down to me!
