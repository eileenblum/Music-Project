[4x]
Straight into my eyes, your demise
I got another one to my eyes, your demise

Iâm fucking great
Cause this is, the end of the world, yeah
I wasnt satisfied from the first time that I saw your fucking face
I couldnât help but laugh at the fact that you thought that I would back down
But not that easily, I have alot of hate built up inside of me
Take your opinions, and shove them right up your ass
Cause, this is the best time that Iâve ever had
Weâve been through all of the good and the bad
Take your mind set, and head for the hills
This is my life and Iâve got skills that kill
Oh, I'll shake the Earth as I'm stomping the ground
Iâll take this weight off me pound by pound
You really think that Iâd let you get through to me
Then suddenly, I come out of nowhere and push you into oncoming traffic
Ooh.. That really looks like it hurt!
What do we do?
Wait what was his name?
I think im going insane..
Letâs call this scene âpathetic hit and runâ

[2x]
Why canât I be like the other kids?
I try to fit into the crowd like you always did
I built myself up over night and strive to be the best
Tears are words that the heart cannot express

[2x]
Drop this motherfucker into the pit
I donât know why the fuck I try so hard, every chance I get
Whatâs wrong with my past?
I swear to god Iâll try my hardest just to make this last

Right NOW!

[2x] Turn me on, kill the bass, This is on, smash the place

I, must say
Iâm pretty impressed by all your failed attempts to embarrass me
Two wrongs donât make a right.. but do two rights make a wrong?

Whoa man, I dont know, do they?
