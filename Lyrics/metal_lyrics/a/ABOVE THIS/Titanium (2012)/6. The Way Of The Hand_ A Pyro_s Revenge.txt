I call this the way of the hand
Why would I sit when I can stand
I play my part
I try my best
My words are real
Iâve passed the test
If you were here
Things would work out
How could you lie
Whatâs this all about
Time spent times wrong (look at me now)
Fuck this I'm gone (look at you now)
I feel so good (look at me now)
You wish you could (look at you now)
Stop, before I lose my temper
Violations all the time
They really call this act a crime
All this time you never knew
That all these words were said to you
Ball your fist and stand your ground
Donât hesitate, donât speak a sound
Everyone is watching us
Where is the hate, where is the fucking trust?

[2x] We are so far from perfect
But in the end itâs worth it to me

When will you see, I will never

[2x] I will never, bow down to someone else
I will never, bow down to you

Bow down to you

Cause I know that this is best
And I will not tolerate any of the rest
Lay your hands down to the floor
And watch the gasoline slip under the door

Ohh, itâs my past, that fills me with hate
For heavenâs sake.. Haa Yupp..
Oh, it burns, please no more
Tie my hands, theyâre on fire now
Tie my hands 'cus theyâre on fire
I have the perfect way out
I have the perfect stand up, a--
I have the perfect way out
I have the perfect stand up, against them
I know the only way out
I know the only stand up, to--
I know the only way out
I know the only stand up, to--
Watch as the sun sets, lift up your broke hands,
Breathe through the smoke now, weâve been here for awhile,
No time for regrets, this place is a mess,
Set this town on fire

Cause I know that this is best
And I will not tolerate any of the rest
Lay your hands down to the floor
And watch the gasoline slip under the door

Oh, it burns, hit the floor, bitch, Iâm on fire now.
