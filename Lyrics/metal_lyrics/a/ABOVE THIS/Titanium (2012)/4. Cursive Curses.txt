My heart beats the only thing that keeps me from leaving your sight

Oh, That was the best make up sex that Iâve had
Get off the phone bitch you canât be that mad
I canât believe all the things we just did
I told you somethings I just canât admit
What is this pressure I feel inside me
Iâll take it back I swear Iâll put it all behind me
Take these steps back to take a step forward
Onward to new beginnings
