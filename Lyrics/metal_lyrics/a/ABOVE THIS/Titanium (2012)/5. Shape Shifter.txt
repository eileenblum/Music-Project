Letâs take a seat just figure all this out
Weâre standing on the edge of mountain tops
This is the final rage so donât you turn the page
This is for everyone who wants to know
Our world is constantly changing
Our world is better than yours
Our world is constantly changing
Our world is better than yours
And you know itâs true
Every single day you say it
Every single day you say it

[2x]
Every single day, I turn to you and say
Letâs change the pattern of the this off scale world (off scale world)

You canât take this anymore

[2x]
Transform, all of your continents
What is this vision of a perfect world? (perfect world)

If we all started to work together, our land would be cleaner
If we all started to change the weather, our skies would be clearer
Why donât you do your part

[3x]
East side, West side
Letâs come together and make change

[2x]
This is our effort, to clean up the world
Your either in or out, so are you in or out

[2x]
Oh, shape shifter
We are here, weâll make this clear

The world is changing for your hands to make
So what path will you take, what path will you take
This oneâs for you Thomy, cause youâll always be my friend
East side, West side, put your fucking hands up, here we go!
Oh, your dead to me,

[4x] Burn the nation down

I was sent from the sky to burn the nation down

(Battle roar)

Bitch your dead to me,

[4x] Burn the nation down
