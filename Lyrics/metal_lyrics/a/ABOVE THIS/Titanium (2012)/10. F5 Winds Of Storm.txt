To my land, my nameâs as it stands
To the world, I donât give a damn
Feel the air, Let it brush up your face
Make a plan, and fill in itâs place
We will rise, bursts of light, times on fly
We will rise
Forecast, howâd you know? TAKE THIS TO YOUR GRAVE!
Forecast, howâd you know? How would you be saved?
Forecast, howâd you know? TAKE THIS TO YOUR GRAVE!
Forecast, howâd you know? How would you be saved?

[2x] I will not fight, I will stay right, I will make you see what I have done

Forecast all those that you knew, all these feelings they have you ruin
We canât be the only oneâs doin this screwin this up
We will rise
Forecast, howâd you know? TAKE THIS TO YOUR GRAVE!
Forecast, howâd you know? How would you be saved?
Forecast, howâd you know? TAKE THIS TO YOUR GRAVE!
Forecast, howâd you know? How would you be saved?
Keep this in mind, that time never rewinds
The horizon, is so dark I canât even see my way
At the end of this hurricane, what will you have to say
To my land, my nameâs as it stands
To the world, I donât give a damn
Feel the air, Let it brush up your face
Make a plan, and fill in itâs place
Forecast, howâd you know? TAKE THIS TO YOUR GRAVE!
Forecast, howâd you know? How will you be saved?
