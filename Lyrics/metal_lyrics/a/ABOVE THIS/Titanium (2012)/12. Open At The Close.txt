You're still with me, And Iâll do this strictly for my family
Jr. Why? Iâll know that youâll always be here with me
I guess that Iâll just have to take the lead
I am the son of a respectful father
And you can see it in my eyes that I donât waste my time
If you could stop your lazy ways and open up to your surroundings
Your boundaries
I know that everything will be okay, your conscious loves to tell you things
You canât sit around and be a frod, Cause life goes on, let go, let God
I hope you look down on me and see what I have done
I have been pushing the hardest that Iâve ever gone
Everybody hurts, everybody is scared
But you have to remember the times that youâve shared
Let go, let go, let go
I could tell you stories about the good ol' times
Looking back at the past, when you use to be mine... oh god
I donât give a fuck bitch, Screamin' out my lungs bitch, Who the fuck are you?
Lookin' at me wrong bitch, Why's it been so long bitch? Tell me how you've been
Lookin' at me wrong bitch, Why you starin' hard bitch, Who the fuck are you?
Iâma make you cry bitch , Iâma make you cry bitch, Boo-fucking-hoo

[4x] Jr. Why?

I hope you look down on me and see what I have done
I have been pushing the hardest that Iâve ever gone
Everybody hurts, everybody is scared
But you have to remember the times that youâve shared

It must be faith, It must be God, That made me see, What I could not
It breaks my heart, To see you down, You know that I will always be around
I donât give a fuck bitch, Screamin' out my lungs bitch, Who the fuck are you?
Lookin' at me wrong bitch, Why's it been so long bitch? Tell me how you been
Lookin' at me wrong bitch, Why you starin' hard bitch, Who the fuck are you?
Iâma make you cry bitch, Iâma make you cry bitch, Boo-fucking-hoo
