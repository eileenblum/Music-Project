This is the beginning of a new world
Everything we once had was left in ashes
The friends you had are now gone, itâs time to make a new plan
Miles away, we try to find a home, something thatâs standing tall
Somewhere you canât go wrong
Needless to say, we travel by our feet, Iâve never been so worn, I couldn't keep my heat
Watch for the sun, itâs never done us wrong, if we keep wasting time we will be way past gone
Needless to say, we travel by our feet, Iâve never been so worn, I couldn't keep my heat

[Chorus]
I canât take the thought of you laying next to him when I'm not home
I canât take this pressure and now your stuck feeling the way you do
Leave it to me! Take my hand, Let me show you everything I am,
Take me down, I can see you're still staring at the ground
Take my hand, Let me make you want what you could never have
Take me down, let your new man know that I am still around

[4x]
Run and put your kids inside, run around the fucking streets
Time is up the end is here, run around the fucking streets

I canât take the thought of you laying next to him when I'm not home
I canât take this pressure and now your stuck feeling the way you do
At the very minute time stops running, My mind goes on an instant replay of my life
This one goes out to anyone Iâve ever lost,

Anyone Iâve ever left behind, anyone Iâve ever let down, anyone
Iâve ever lied to, anyone Iâve ever told off, anyone I couldnât help at the exact moment, anyone I ever made feel less than what they were, anyone
Iâve ever hurt,

Anyone Iâve ever blown off, anyone Iâve ever made sad, anyone Iâve
ever told to get a life and move on, anyone Iâve ever loved, anyone Iâve
ever trusted, anyone thatâs ever trusted me, anyone that I ever stole from,

I'M SORRY!

All my life Iâve been asleep, Iâve said too many lines it makes it hard to speak,
So can you tell me goodbye! Heavens collecting right on time..
Wonât you fill me in, Open up the gates to heaven.
