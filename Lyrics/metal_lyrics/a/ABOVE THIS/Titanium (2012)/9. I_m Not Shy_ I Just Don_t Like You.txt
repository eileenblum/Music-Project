There's always that one person in your life that you just can't impress
That one person that you just can't satisfy
Anything that you say, Anything that you do
They just won't listen
Well, this one goes out to you.

If you want it you can have it, Come and get it your way
You like to talk, I like to fuck, letâs do this every single day
Bring your friends, Iâll bring the noise, So roll on over to my place
And if them haters talkin shit, well they can say it to my face

I told her, this makes me feel like im back in â95
Everyoneâs getting older, get ready for the ride
Take my future and take my plans
My minds unsure of the person I am
Stop the anger and let it fly
Your only human, youâll be just fine

[2x]
I can not tell you how much that I care
Itâs about time that you had your share
I am the only thing standing between
The out skirts of trust and as it seems

[2x]
I donât want this, I donât want you
I felt so lost, my life was so through

I found my way back to my home

[3x] I'm not shy I just don't like you

If you want it you can have it, Come and get it your way
You like to talk, I like to fuck, letâs do this every single day
Bring your friends, Iâll bring the noise, So roll on over to my place
And if them haters talkin shit, well they can say it to my face

[2x] Whatâs left to say to you

If you want it you can have it, Come and get it your way
You like to talk, I like to fuck, letâs do this every single day

What is this substance, that fills my mind with such regret
I feel your presence, just like the first time that we met
We are, so far from being over
We are, so far from being over

[2x] For my friends, I will never forget.
