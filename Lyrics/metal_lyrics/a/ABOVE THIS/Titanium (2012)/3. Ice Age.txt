Donât just stand there, bitch move
Be apart of something bigger than me and you
Wonât you spare me? Wonât you dare me?
I need, you to care for me

[2x] Oh, unravel time

What do I have to say to get you back on track with today's reality
I cannot mother you like I used to do back in the day, I cannot say
How much I wish you were and everything was back to normal
For the sake of our future,
Why wonât you answer me, why donât you answer me?
Now that you're frozen, my voice has been chosen
To be the leader, a diligent speaker
Now that you're frozen, my voice has been chosen
To be the leader, a diligent speaker of time
I'm the best,
And I dont give a mother fuck, about the rest
Drain your sorrow, drop the bass..
Not another massacre
Nothing leaves my sight
Hold your troubles, it ends tonight
Whatâs my purpose?
Why do I walk this Earth
Iâm bleeding slowly and nothing can stop this pain
I was a lost man, I had my ups and downs
Will someone help me, find my way back to the ground
Donât just stand there, bitch move
Be apart of something bigger than me and you
Wonât you spare me? Wonât you dare me?
I need, you to care for me

[2x] Oh, unravel time
