We are nothing, they are nothing..
Whatâs the point of war?
We are nothing, they are nothing..
Wonât you stop this war?
We are nothing, they are nothing..
Stop this war
We are nothing, they are nothing..
Stop this war
So wonât you tell me why you always feel like you're alone
I had a feeling that you wouldnât make a show
But if you saw how much this really means to me
You wanna make an MTV show outta me
I hear your comments, you might as well stop this
Enough is enough now, you really make it sound like this..
Iâm looking down off a cliff right below my feet
Help!
I canât control my speed
Help!
My hand is slipping off the wheel

[2x]
Liar Liar
Youâve done it once again..
Liar Liar

[2x]
We are nothing, they are nothing..
Whatâs the point of war?
We are nothing, they are nothing..
Wonât you stop this war?

We are nothing, they are nothing..
Stop this war
We are nothing, they are nothing..
Stop this war

Oh, The atmosphere is being sucked away
These knives weâre made to kill, You canât fight the darkness now
Oh, The atmosphere is being sucked away
These knives weâre made to kill, You canât fight the darkness
These knives weâre made to kill
