What would you do?
If someone took everything that you had
Then turned against you and used it for bad
The answer is nothing but an alternation within one's first impression
Iâll be the ending of your lies
I donât give a fuck!
I donât give a fuck about the things that you tell me
I donât give a fuck because your only out to get me

I cannot remain this way forever
Itâs just too much
Well if it's do or die
Well if it's do or die then I will try
To be the man I was

Yeah!

[2x] Iâll be your sunset, Iâll be your light, Iâll be your armor, Letâs start a fight

Letâs pick it up! I feel, like I'm being threatened by your words
At the end of the day, you donât mean shit to me
You swore, that we wouldnât bump heads like we did before
Why is it all a lie, I canât keep putting time aside for this
I cannot remain this way forever, itâs just too much
Oh, all the shepherds are calling their groups
Just like them you follow as one
I donât give a fuck about the things that you tell me
I donât give a fuck because your only out to get me now
Across the fields of burning shrub
Iâm standing across the lake above
And at the end of the day
Iâll take this shit away
Whatâs the cure, to the feeling the boredom, and they tell me they tell me your lost
I canât fucking stand the judgement, Iâm blowing smoke cause I like getting high

I cannot remain this way forever
Itâs just too much
Well if it's do or die
Well if it's do or die then I will try
To be the man I was

Bitch Iâll fucking bury your face in the dirt
So eat those rocks bitch hope that fucking hurts
This is not the way that I planned
What the fuck right? Youâll never understand
Iâll fucking bury your face in the dirt
So eat those rocks bitch hope that fucking hurts
Iâll be the ending of your lies
Say, anything you want, Iâll have your throat!
