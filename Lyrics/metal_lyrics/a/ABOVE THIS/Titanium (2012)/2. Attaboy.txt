I dont need this shit

[x2]
Dont ever tell me i wasnt an impact on your life
Cause I know that I was and this is just the beginning

These are our last days and now is the time confess

Letâs burn this city to the ground
Weâll make up for all the lost time
Ignite our hate and make something of this life
Oh my thoughts
Are much darker than you think
Iâve passed the test, Iâve been through hell and back
To save you
I know, that you are broken
And I was just another mistake
Let out, all of your secrets
So I can finally see the real..

[x2]
You don't want another repeat of last year
Lookin like a rober when there was no cashier?
Tryna catch a break from this fucked up role play
I dont need a bitch I need a blunt, what would you say?

I am the chosen one, I am the falling sun,
I am the one you lost, it's time to pay the cost
Iâve come this far, and now
Iâve come this far
Look at me now, look what Iâve done
Look at me now, look what Iâve done
Whoa, it falls from the sky
And now I fell from the sky
AH! it falls from the sky
AYA-YA-YA! I fell from the sky
Oh I feel so different, from everyone
I feel so different, from everyone
Attaboy!
Thatâs what they tell me, Attaboy
