Drop Dead!
Your fucking purpose, you're worthless, you know that this wasnât just all about you
Drop Dead!
Your fucking purpose, you're worthless, you know that this wasn't just all about you
Take, your time for me, when will your drugs kick in?
I hate the pain, there is nothing that I can do
Try not to lay it down, then bring it to my eyes
So letâs just kill this shit just one last time
We are the lost ones, we are the broken!
So what the fuck you think weâre in this for?

(War Cry)

[2x] Destroyer Of Worlds, They call me..

Weâre back on top, feel the hours fade away
