Once again we see another rising sun,
But keep your head on straight,
Because this war has just Begun
I feel your pain
And thats the only agreement we have,
Nothings the same,Because im taking over your,
Part

Ill give you more than just a death machine,
Ill fucking smother you in gasoline
Ill flick a spark and Blow the smoke in your
Face, So save your breath And watch me put em,
in place

Fuck That Shit
And Fuck you Ho
You fucking little Bitch!

I fucking run this,Who are you to tell me,
Where I belong, Because I failed them
And I will fail you
Get the fuck out my way

So whats the matter, I save the best for last
And made your future Shatter
Well, you can hear it in my voice im fucking pissed off
And every little thing you make is a fucking rip off
Of us, This is Real, This is how I feel
My life is great, And all you do is Hate On Me

I don't give a flying fuck you motherfuckers
Welcome to my Life!

Ill prove to you that You were wrong
You cant fuck with us
Get real or get the fuck out the way
Im tired of this bullshit
Above this for life
Finish these fucks,

Maybe one day youll see,
Never underestimate me AGAIN
