I wont be another fake in this fucking society
Next to you I was a man but I knew what I had to do

All these colours are starting to fade
They're Starting to Fade!

Help me god
'Cus I swear that I'll never make it!

Backwards and forwards
The scene's getting lamer
I'll Stand above
All these ten minute famers
Look past the pain
And bring it to my eyes
I'll show you people all my demons in disguise!

Procrastinate
Your own disguise!
Is this what you wanted?

Will you remember me?

Now all these colours are starting to fade
Help me god
'Cus I swear that I'll never make it!

Now look back to the world
We will compromise
Never did I think
You would come back for me
Let's make the best of this

We're eleaked
We are above this
We're eleaked
