This is the ending
Our city burned straight to the ground
I screamed your name but you never turned around
So watch your step now
We turn our heads and look above
Weâre taking over this world 
So take your cover just because
WEâRE FUCKING BACK AGAIN!
Weâre fucking back again

Iâll spend my days just to find what im after
My eyes are burdened from the scene of disaster
My father always told me never play with fire
Iâll take my stand for the U.S.A Empire

God I love my fucking life
Get fucking low bitch.
