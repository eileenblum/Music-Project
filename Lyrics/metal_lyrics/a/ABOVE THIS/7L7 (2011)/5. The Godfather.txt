Oh,
What to do with a gun in my hand
What part of fuck off did you not understand
Weâre raising up on popular demand
This was a joke but now its way out of hand
I will never forget this moment
When you almost won this fight
Against me and a proper liar
Your dreams are going out the window tonight
Let the cause and effect kick in
And let the rain wash away my sin
You going far boy, thats all they say
Your dreaming big dont let that ever slip away
Cause today I am a king
Go and run your mouths, is it obvious to see?
This world is vastly drained and bit overrated for me
You can let your hope run out, thats what quittings all about
The ends will never meet and my fears are stuck on repeat
Never hold regret your life is all a bet
They wait to see you fail so they can put you up for sale
You push yourself too hard, youll only be left scarred
This is a battlefield and you have to keep it real..
[2x] Now I see you make me believe you
And if they agree with me..
[6x]
Light up that bitch, you are a monster
We are a pact, that makes us stronger
Let the unknown speak if we never meet
Just know I tried my best, and that goes for all the rest
I swore I'd never tell you this song is all about you
You never loved me did you? lets put this shit on redue
I can believe we went here, your love is so insincere 
Why does this always happen your such a weak contraption
You never told me goodbye, this feelings got me so high
Why all my friends just stood by I'll build myself up tonight
So much for fucking wishes you kept me so suspicious 
And now weâre fucking finished
That bitch is so diminished
[2x]
Why dont you fucking watch me I'll make you all see what this is doing to me
2x
I am the godfather and all you fucks dont even bother
