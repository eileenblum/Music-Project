[2x]
Never did I think that we would recover.. we're stepping in on this scene like no other
All of this work has us hooked on the repay, I'll say what I mean and I'll mean what I say
But you should know.. I have the temper that can lift me off the ground
You will NEVER cross me again..
[2x]
Oh liar liar tell me what do you remember
From that fight
Its all too easy.. its just all to easy for me
