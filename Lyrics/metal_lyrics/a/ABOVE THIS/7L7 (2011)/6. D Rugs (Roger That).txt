The days we count down to see a change in this life
Weâll make a change and weâre taking this town tonight
Weâre taking this town tonight
Stomp your feet on the fucking ground
Watch me ill fucking snatch this, I see you eyeing me
But you can never have this, I remember you
You said you knew me, but now I'm big and all you wanna do is screw me bitch
[2x] Tell me all your secrets, let me see your weakness
Pull back the curtains and let this light shine right through
Your far from perfect, oh I just wanted you to see that you were nothing to me
Pull back the curtains and let this light shine right through to you
Hold your fucking tongue, oh
Hold your fucking tongue
False steps led to, these times were so difficult, step back that crazy bitch
Im warning you, your next on my list push back the pit I'm done with all your shit
FUCK THEM UP
[4x] Bring the pussy to his knees
Roger that, I'm making money bitch roger that
Roger that, I fucking love it bitch roger that
Roger That
