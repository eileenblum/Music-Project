Whats the purpose of being dishonest, you think I'm out but I swear girl I'm on this
We can sit here for hours and argue, or we could fuck for the sake of your value
What do you mean when you said you wont doubt me?
You know I'm cocky yeah its all about me, take your pride and your heart and just let go
If you want it girl theres something that you should know.
Go, I like to spit game and leave you lost, you know me girl yeah I'm a boss
I do work I get it in, you like that hard shit so do your friends
I need something more than this
I will not be satisfied until there are no other guys, 
you and me make two in one but lets just have some fucking fun
everything sounds good to me pour those drinks and roll that tree
This is all I have to say that nothings standing in our way
[2x] I need you to be here with me
I must taste pretty good, cause my name is in everybodies fucking mouth
[2x]
Get on the floor, take a shot take another hit, never pass out, 
bring it back do some crazy shit
I must taste pretty good cause my name is in everybodies fucking mouth
[2x] Lets make them jealous, how hard could it be?
We are the guys that crash in on your party, 
we are the ones that make your bitch act naughty
All of these people came here for a good time 
so lets just kick it and put these haters in line

What this isnt your style?
This ones just for you!
You hear our flow
And you tell all of your friends we suck..
But we're ABOVE THIS and we will never give a FUCK
All of this work just to keep us together
I'll kill this verse just to show you i'm better
I never cared about you and your possy
I'll make it clear that you never will cross me
Make up your mind if you'll make an appearance
I'd keep my mouth shut it makes all the difference
Choke on your words you know nothing about me
I proved myself so you never could doubt me
You have no plan or no damn motivation
I'll end your world and your FUCKING CREATION!
[6x] I am one of a kind
