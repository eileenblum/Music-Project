All the saints and sinners please report to the battlefield
Karma has picked its next, report to the battlefield
Make your money make your profit running from us will never stop it
All the saints and sinners please report to the battlefeild
The war goes on.. Nothing can tell
Nothing ever changes its always the same
The battle goes onward and leaves us in shame
Look past your sorrow and seek the truth
Weâve been here months now with nothing to prove
We are the ones that protect your country
All of your towns have burned into nothing
Breathing this smoke will only make you higher
Keep your head down when the guns start to fire
Make up your mind, if you have what it takes
To be alive, and make some simple mistakes
Lift up your head, and make the best of this
Leave out the rest, and know this war was for the best
This war is for the best, for the best
I was the boy that you left back in Nile
Where have i been? but the war took awhile
This is the ending of all that we know now
Look for the main base and capture the home town
Pull through the hard times to get through this weather
A helping hand only makes you feel better
Make up your mind if this is what you wanted
Your purpose is rotten but never forgotten now
[4x]
Lets take a stand, for the ones we love
Scatter but what the fuck does it matter?
Scatter but what the fuck does it..
FINISH HIM!
This is no rio
What is the purpose of war? we stand here just begging for more
Lips quiver, theyâll never cross the river, theyâll never bring me down!
