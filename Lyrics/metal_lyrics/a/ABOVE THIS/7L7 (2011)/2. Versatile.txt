Do you remember when our trust use to be fucking gold?
You stole my heart, Its going once, Its going Twice, Its fucking sold
I keep friends close, Iâll hold you on every lie youâve told
This is way that i feel, your games are getting fucking old

Iâll change my pitch just start a fucking new bitch
I turned my life around i did it just for you bitch
Is it me or him? its time to fucking choose bitch
Your fucking kidding me, what else you gonna lose bitch noww

This is over
It started with you,
It ended with me
Iâll make this easy for you
Its time for me to leave
[2x]
Iâll be the man
And youâll be the girl
You fuck with my life
Iâll fuck up your world
We had it all
But you had your fun
This is the joke
That we have become

What is the point of being sober when iâm not okay
Iâll take everything back so you can have it your way
You leave me breathless lost without a word to say
I canât believe where we stand at the end of the day
[2x] Im not okay, with you leaving me

Your still apart of me
Iâll break it down bitch
Pick up your head, stop staring at the ground bitch
Bring back the bass..
And make it count bitch
Just let them know
That theyâll be seeing you around bitch
Let them know
Youâll be seeing me around
You fucking bitch.. (power up)

Was it worth it? Are you perfect? I get this feeling that youâll never be worth it
