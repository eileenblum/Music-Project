Weâve been through the best times weâve been through the weather
You told me to write back but you never got a letter
You fucked with the wrong crowd, I spoke my peace out loud
My mind fucking jumbled my hearts fucking stumbled again
I need real friends, With this moment, there wont be nothing left
They say, I'm so much better than this, I can do much better than this
You want the truth? I cut that bitch.. right across the heart
Well so much for trying you did it to yourself, well so much for trying you did it to yourself
I feel so alive, when I'm by your side, 
just let me stay another night, so I can finish what I started
This is the purpose of my desertion, I had a thin line I hope was worth it to you
[4x]
Read through the lines now, 6 words you.know.just.what.to.do
[2x]
Drugs will make us all feel better with our heads light like a feather
Dreaming has its consequences lose yourself and mind your buisness
Speak the truth and set your standard reach the top no time for manors
We are here for one good reason be a man say FUCK the treason
[2x]
Straight from the bottom to the top weâre on the rise
Straight from the bottom to the top well surprise surprise
Well surprise surprise..
Breathe in, breathe out, through my words breathe in breathe out..
Through my words your mother fuckers..
Through my words, fuck with my satisfaction
You never thought that this could happen to you
Do me a favor.. and SHUT THE FUCK.. UP
Small brains and such big mouths...
Your such a waste and you will never see
So back the fuck up away from me!
