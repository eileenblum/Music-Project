Here I am again
With a mouth full of senseless words
And It finally dawned on me
Whats a life without the royalty?
The strive to push yourself
And the pressure to achieve wealth
It never makes a change
Your the only one to blame this time
Look at all your friends, and look at all you know
Your such a little bitch
Your girlfriends a ho
Let me tell you something about your way of life
The only thing your worry about is where your sleeping tonight
But its never too late you make things right
So make a deal with yourself
Fuck the world tonight

Lift up your hands, say fuck what your told
This is your life, and your only getting older
Make up your mind stop wasting my time
Karmaâs a bitch and your next in line
You only talk like your the shit when your sober
I fucked your girl I guess thats why she said its over
Listen to me, they fucking lie straight through their teeth
I crave success and thats the only thing that matters to me
Open your eyes, you have to learn to walk before you run
So make your move bitch, times out your done
Fuck it
[2x]
Read through the lines, take my advice tonight

This is bow, to show the world what weâre all about
Scream your heart out, this is the movement and its too late to turn back now
I wont help you, your just a phase and Iâll always stand above you now
[4x]
The royalty
[2x]
We are the royalty
What has come over me
Watch and learn as I will..
Push past all the lies and bullshit
Iâve told you once that Iâm standing above this shit
But your still just a coward
How does it feel? cause you been over powered
Oh, break through the lock, break through the chains
Imagine my gun going straight through your brain
Push past all the lies and the bullshit
Iâve told you once that Iâm standing above this shit
