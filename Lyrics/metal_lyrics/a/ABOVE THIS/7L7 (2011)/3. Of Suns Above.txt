[6x]
Hatred aside,
Iâm nothing but a lost man now

Conflict, has never stopped me
Only in the end, do we ever see
What you did to me
Liar, take ever liar
Far away from me
Just so I can breathe, without you at my feet

Life flashes before my eye
The smoke we see billows high
Above the open ground that we used to walk on
As we await a brighter sun
These days seem like theyâll never come
Letâs take a stand for once
Just for once

Over and over
The pistolâs revolver
Higher and higher
My lifeâs growing tired
Look at the air that we breathe
Thereâs nothing left here for me
So let me go
Just let me go right now
[6x]
Tell your friend that Iâll be waiting for him
If heâs scared, then Iâll come looking for him
FUCK IT
[2x]
Tell your god that Iâll be waiting for him
If heâs scared then hell is looking for him

Lost without a word to say to you
What did I say? what did I do?
Open your mind, open your heart
Letâs turn our time back to the start
Over and over
The pistolâs revolver
Higher and higher
My lifeâs growing tired of this
[2x] The sun is falling from the sky!
