She was left raped and bleeding, freezing in the snow
A soldier I, returned from war, to find my bride like so
Her family dead, her father hanged at the gallows in the square
He was accused of witchcraft, a devil priest
By blood, revenge, is the oath that I now swear

Witchfynder finder
Witchhunter slayer
I shall be a grim reminder
of the lives he undid here

Destitute and surely deranged
I now drift from town to town
Maddened with my lust for revenge
In the bottle my sorrows drowned
I search the name of Hopkins
When our paths cross cross, I'll take away his life
I'll bash his fucking skull in and scalp him with my knife

Vengeance! Vengeance! On the Inquisitor, slay!
Vengeance! Vengeance! The hunter becomes the prey!
