I want to see the world burn
I am filled with hate and Disgust 
Sick of it all, my sanity is metal
and its starting to rust...

Emptiness
I have no soul
No conscience 
Its getting old

Happiness, a thing of the past
Death, is approaching fast
Afterlife, i don't believe
If hell exists, i'm already there, yeah!
