Birthed forth from the cunt of a sacrifical whore
My father wore a goats head as he raped my mother on the floor
From the moment of conception, my life to sacrifice
A demon soul now germinates,a toll for satan's vice

[Chorus:]
The Ceremony doth begin, in trance, they dance and sway
The chanting reaches fervor pitch, the organ blares away

9 months soon now pass, winter brings frost across the land
In a churchyard they commence tonight, the artists of the damned

The graveyard they now desecrate, the crosses they now invert
Holy relics used to masterbate, the altar they pervert

[Chorus:] 
Born into the arcane black, occult fodder for their lord,
Infanticidal sacrifice... To Magic, Sex &amp; GORE

Blade of cold black steel to exhume me from the womb 
Torn into this realm of life and placed into my tomb
Baptized in a cauldron of blood , oath of secret is now sworn
Bring forth the severed goats head and impale me on the fucking horn

[Chorus]
