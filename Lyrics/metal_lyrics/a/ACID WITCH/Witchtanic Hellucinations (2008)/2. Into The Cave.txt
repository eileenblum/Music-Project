[I.]
A foreshadowing opening like a hungry maw.
Shadows swallow you like a funeral shroud.
A dank miasma of moldering death.
The morbid stench churns your bowels...

[II.]
Bats' fangs drip with black sickened BLOOD.
&amp; vermin gnaw upon babes' tender bones.
Foetid carrion breath upon your neck
As she whispers curses in your year...

[Chorus:]
Into the cave, the horrid witch calling...
Behold your DOOM as the darkness is falling...
