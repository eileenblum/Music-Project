She was never content
With the rest of the coven
She mated with wolves
For their blood and some lovin'

Cast a spell on herself
Against the laws of her cult
She transformed at the full moon
By the power of the occult!

She's a rabid werewitch!
Blood-crazed, she casts her spell
She's a rabid werewitch!
She feasts then sends you to hell
