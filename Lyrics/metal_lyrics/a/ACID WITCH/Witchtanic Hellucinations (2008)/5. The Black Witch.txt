Salem 1692
Where 20 witches hanged
Sleepy village gripped by Satan
The devil's holding sway

Tituba, the black witch
Slave of the night
Possessing the minds of the puritan white
Casting her spells of African
Learned in the rites
Voodoo of the ancient macumba
The reverend's daughters howled and spit

They clearly are bewitched
Witch hunt blood lust for the general
Nubian priestess kept inquisit in bondage
The cross of the reverend torments her
For freedom and vengeance her plot has been laid to madness!

White flesh for the devil
Black demons dance in the minds of the children
Townspeople panic and charge their own kin

Crones dragged
Cut to be hung on the gallows
Into cursed ruin Salem was swallowed!
