The dead are out tonight
Spreading sickness to the weak
The dead are damaging the crops
Dirty pranks on farmers

October 31st scare the dead away
October 31st the harvest ends today

The slaughter has begun
To fill the winter stores
Live stock bones fuel the fires
Burning bright on this rotting night

October 31st scare the dead away
October 31st the harvest ends today
