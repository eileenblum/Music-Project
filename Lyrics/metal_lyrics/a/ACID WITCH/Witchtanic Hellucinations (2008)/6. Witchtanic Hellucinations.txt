A man possessed
I walk alone
To find the coven
'Neath the sanguine moon
Follow the wisps
And strange gloomy lights
For the cult of Lyseric is meeting tonight
From the drums on skulls comes their chant of Doom
I follow entranced to the ominous tune
I see the smoke rings ascending high
Lost in the woods
I'm fucking high!
Hallucinate through the forest's threat
And come upon this black witchcraft
Pentagram unbroken
The circle now complete
They beckon me to join their ritual Hasheesh

Enchanted with spells
By the crone's drone song
I inhale the evil of the witchcraft bong

Weed witch
Weed witch

Witchtanic Hellucinations
Witchtanic Hellucinations

12 are here you'll be the 13th
I sit at the fire
Smell the cauldron's dank reek
Into the boil a boney finger is dipped
And unto my tongue the acid is dripped

Witchtanic Hellucinations
Witchtanic Hellucinations
