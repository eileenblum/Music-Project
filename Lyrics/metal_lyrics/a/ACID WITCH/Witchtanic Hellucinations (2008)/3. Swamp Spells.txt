[I.]
Under the fullmoon, into the swamp you lurk...
In search of the horrid secrets of HELL
To the house made of Virgin's bones &amp; hides
The abode of the witch, of whence home return...

[II.]
Moss hangs from the roof like a corpse's hair,
Cypress roots stick through the scum like fingers.
Even reptile horrors do shrink in FEAR from it.
But all too curious, you knock upon Her door...

[Chorus:]
Into your foolish mind my nightmare spells shall sleep
&amp; deep under the black swamp-waters, you shall SLEEP...
