This house is cursed
My dreams have died
Replaced with somnabulism
And infanticide

The sealed loft above my room
From wence the impending horror looms
The violet light that heralds slumber
The portal cast th rough angled lumber

Walpurgis revels - hallow''s night
The beldame leads the DEMONIC RITES!
and I am cursed, and ive gone mad
For I am deaf...AND I AM DEAD!

The chittering speech of her rat familiar
Fills my walking hours with cold dark shivers
Nights drift by in vague abysses
Cylopean monoliths and glowing prisms
