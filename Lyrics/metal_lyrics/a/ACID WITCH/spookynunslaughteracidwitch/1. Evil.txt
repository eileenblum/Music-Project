[performed by Acid Witch]Once flaunted Christian crosses are inverted upside down
Jesus Christ, your savior, is a story the ancient's found
If your blinded eyes could see the truth...
Does it hurt you lived a lie?
There is no fucking light
When your dead you fucking die...

Evil...

Believe what you can see, worship what is real
Witches, greed, lust and hate run the world, that's how I feel
A mansion in the sky, that's why you can't see clear?
Those made up stories tricked you
And filled your head with fear...

Evil...

Common sense and the papacy have never been too close
Burn the book of lies, there is no Holy Ghost
Evil isn't made by Satan, it's just a human trait
Evil is religion and the hate that it creates...
