[performed by Acid Witch]Today's death is fucking tame
Leaves me feeling D.O.A
Stylish hair and "brootal" shit
Sanitized the putrescence

The cryptic past of mid-west death
Sends shivers across my flesh
Fiends of old sure spilled blood
At Michigan Death Fest '91

Eating acid
Smoking pot
Thrashing in the parking lot
Snorting lines
Drinking hard
Horror, pain, gore and death...the whole nine yards

The smell of death should reek of old
Flannel shirts and rotten clothes
Stealing pieces of the dead
Cause that's how Helga lost her head

The cryptic past of mid-west death
Sends shivers across my flesh
Fiends of old sure spilled blood
At Michigan Death Fest '91

Eating acid
Smoking pot
Thrashing in the parking lot
Snorting lines
Drinking hard
Horror, pain, gore and death...the whole nine yards

Eating acid melts my head
As I listen to "Season of the Dead"
Rotten clothes make my rash grow
Got a bad case of impetigo
