in zen, ChiMeras turn
silKen, sunLit, azure
suMMoning a Feral air
unlike arDenT
asHennnn orGasms

ninth sun, Crazier Me
in zen's salute I LurK
Alloyed, a markinG
a griM insane ForMula

nine hertz CraniuMs
raze sunK nulLities
saCruM, inner zenith
orgasM, aFlaMe in ruin
like Truth, a Grim hoMe

Taking god out of the equation
This is the Malkuth Grimoire

A grim insane formula
This is the Malkuth Grimoire

[Solo - Danny]
[Solo - Christian]

All that's needed
A universe of parts and particles
Waiting to be rearranged

All ingredients are here
Nothing needs to be added
Let alchemy suffice

[Solo - Christian]

Spirit - into form distilled
Nothing else required to build - a world
Architects of evolution
In Malkuth we reside

[Solo - Morean]

In Malkuth we belong
