Call on me - human source to nothingness
Blindly see through dreams
Unlock the key to a world by void concealed
On black ice beneath the sea

From Malkuth earth reborn
Walks the one to marry moon and sun
Be one refl ection

Sincere - your organic thought machine
Reckons the plane obscene
I can feel the deafening silence
Illusive asylum arriving for real

Contemplate on things that one
can't see for real or feel
Foresee the consequence your deeds reveal

Into earth withdrawn
Lies the one to carry moon and sun
In fractured action

Sincere - your organic thought machine
Levels the plane obscene
I can see beyond the horizon
A stellar asylum â illusively real

Wasteland on the moon
in which you drown
Sink down in silence
Wasted, seethe in bloom -
solid body in liquid ash

From Malkuth earth reborn
Walks the one to marry moon and sun
Be one refl ection

[Solo - Danny]

Sincere - your organic thought machine
Reckons the plane obscene
I can see beyond the horizon
Illusive asylum arriving for real

Coming off the sea
We have one desire - calculating infi nity

Sincere - your organic thought machine
Levels the plane obscene
I can see beyond the horizon
A stellar asylum - Illusively real

Sincere - your organic thought machine
Levels the planes obscene
I can feel the deafening silence
A string alliance â illusively real
