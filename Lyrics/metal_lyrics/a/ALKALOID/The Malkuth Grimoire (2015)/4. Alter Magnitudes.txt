Lucid delusion of force
Illusions refl ect on their source
Refl ections to weaker minds appear
True when by darkness concealed
Re-open your mind
- Magnitudeâs divine source -
Sync into your soul
Be torn by light
Away from the boundaries of death
Activation -
As neurons blaze
A cellâs invoking space inside your brain
Magnetâs connecting to you
By activating the prefrontal cortex
Denominations decline in time
Your soul enshrines what brightly shines
Through the void science unwinds

[Solo - Christian]

As neurons blaze
A cellâs invoking space inside your brain
Magnets reprogram your phase
A static base collaborates
When orange haze cuts through the maze
Lucid delusion of force
Illusions refl ect on their source
Refl ections to greater minds appeal
Fascinating, but unbelievable
Re-open your mind
- Magnitudeâs divine source -
Sync into your soul
Be torn by light
Away from the boundaries of death
