As gases flee 
And mantles rear 
Let's get it on 
This Dyson Sphere 

What night sky now 
What empyrean 
Too late to die now 

Rolling stria 
Glowing, Cytherean 
A stellar Pangaea 

Sucking giants into spirals 
With a pocket singularity 
Sucking giants into spirals 
With a pocket singularity 

Mercury's iron bones 
Venus' carbon wisdom 
Mars's rocks and stones now 
An astral nervous system 

An iron prison 
Sucking giants into spirals 
To catch a star 
With a pocket singularity 
An iron prison 
Sucking giants into spirals 
To catch a star 
With a pocket singularity 

Saturn was easy 
His moons a treasure trove 
Uranos made us queasy 
And Neptune downright sick; but Jove - 

- Torn apart between two black holes, 
a thousand earths almost fell, 
crushing all, out of control - 
That did not go so well. 

Darkness wanes - 
The Swarm's embrace 
Has been attained 
As everything 
clicks 
into 
place
