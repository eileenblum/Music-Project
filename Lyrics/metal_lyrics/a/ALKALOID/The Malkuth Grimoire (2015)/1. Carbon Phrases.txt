Thoughts are slowly moving on
Unseen where theyâre coming from
In disguise feelingsâ tension moves
- Strings to be pulled by intuition

Changing words takes precious time
Until great sense and suspense fi nd in line
To be perfect
Be the architect
To protect your realm of dreams

I am condemned to see things in youth
Kindness as matter, conceiving the truth
Like a spider in its web Iâm waiting for a muse
A kiss to be abused

So call me, reason, tell me your name!
Set me out of my mind!
Foresee the treason combining each frame
Shaping the perfect design

Find me all season cold in my grave
I am the father of time
Feed the horror that keep my veins alive,
To unwind the perfect line

And once you feed the fire
My will is set ablaze
Strings of thoughts move towards my consciousness
Prosaic cynicâs disease makes me crawl on my knees
Pulls me under in quick sand, makes me understand

Carbon phrases take all their ways to find you
A phrase of love Iâm afraid canât be shaped without heart

Carbon lines fill space to create the perfect stream
The Poetâs dreams are fl owing in it, incomplete

So call me, reason, tell me your name!
For Iâm the father of time
Find me all season cold in my grave
Setting my mind to unwind the perfect line

My creation
Through you my youth unholds its fire
Ideas reveal in semantic spirals, concealed

You can read between the lines
What youâll find is grace
At the bottom of humankind

And once you feed the fire
My will is set ablaze
Strings of thoughts move towards my consciousness
Prosaic cynicâs disease makes me crawl on my knees
Pulls me under in quick sand, makes me understand

[Solo - Christian]
[Solo - Danny]

Feed the fire
My willâs set ablaze
Strings of thoughts move towards my consciousness
Prosaic cynicâs disease makes me crawl on my knees
Pulls me down with her hand, makes me understand

Carbon phrases take all their ways to fi nd you
A phrase of love Iâm afraid canât be shaped without heart

Carbon lines fi ll space to create the perfect stream
The Poetâs dreams are flowing in it, incomplete

Creating you...
