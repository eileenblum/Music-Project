Meagre pickings in the Kuiper Belt 
But for the guardian on the cliff 
In her pelt comets melt 
And moons burst, but only if 

Her 13 brothers didn't get them first 
Out here, the dark hides more than gases 
Beyond Nemesis we celebrate 
Quite a few more Jovian masses 

The Oort cloud is demonic 
Giants crawl, robots trawl 
The Swarm went transplutonic 
All is spun towards the sun 

The Oort cloud is fantastic 
Tyche fell out of hell 
Times are dire, and measures drastic 
Gotta mash her before the crash	

They broke the lightyear barrier 
From the debris they spawn 
Navigation on radiation 
Ages at .c have dawned 

The myriads that sweep the fringes 
Conjoined they haul and hurl 
and hug and tug, so thinnest fog 
Becomes the oceans of the world 

The Oort cloud is demonic 
Thrusters heave, spiders weave 
The Swarm went isotonic 
Interlace Hilbert space 

The Oort cloud is surrounded! 
Higgs Fields retch, tendrils stretch 
Absorb what once abounded 
Move as one towards the sun 

They are now the Oort Swarm 
Dyson Cloud 
Oort Swarm 
Dyson Cloud 
Just a matter of time now 
Just a time now of matter
