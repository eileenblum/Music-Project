Sol Omega 
Now all is one 
Centaurus and Vega 
Let's join the Alpha party 
Sol Omega 
The seeding has begun 

Nurtured on boundless power 
Event horizons dawn 
There's more stars to devour 
Mite to raptor, we must spawn 

Sol Omega 
Let's get the fuck out of here 
Sol Omega 
Let's get out of everywhere 

Thrusters flow, star in tow 
Plasma grows where lasers nestle 
Iron rolls to the poles 
The Dyson shell becomes a vessel 

Our deceased 
Have been a gambit 
Greatly increased the swarm's 
Ancient ambit 

This orbit 
Grows morbid 
All gather! 
Ready? 

Pull! 
One last convulsion 
Pull! 
Every stratum now striatum 

We have propulsion 
We have embarked 

Sol Omega 
The God Atom 
Sol Omega 
Genesis Ark 

The God Atom
