Day and night have gone now 
Time to spawn now, a new dawn now 
Between twin skins 
Biogeny begins its spin 
Seeps along bionic skeletons 
Lines become vines become spines 

Holoplasma 
Growing, imperial 
A clasping miasma 

Conjoins 
Incubates 
What will awaken? 
Expands 
Incarnates 
What will awaken? 

An iron prism 
To hatch a star 
An iron prism 
To hatch a star 

Life seeking life finding life 
Surviving and thriving, the hive comes alive 
Lurching, searching, awed and flawed 
The church becomes god 

We cling, we dive, we float, we forever 
Calibrate and navigate 
Hiccups of wars 
Swamps of infection 
Distinction and extinction 

A sentient surge as minds merge 
What will awaken? 
Post-biotic ascension 
A continuous expansion 
All must converge now! 

What will awaken? 
The Great Beast stirs in a brand new body 
Profusion through astral veins 
Evolution sheds all chains 

What will awaken? 
Kaleidoscope to mosaik to hologram 

Code turns to spell 
Turns life forms to cells 
In circuits and covens 
The hive mind is woven 
Stirs in its shell 
The God Oven 
In its shell 
The God Oven
