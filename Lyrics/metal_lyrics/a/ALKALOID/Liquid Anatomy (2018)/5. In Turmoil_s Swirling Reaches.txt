[Music: Tunker/Grossmann/Morean, lyrics: Tunker]

Adrift in bottomless depths
A cold shroud embraces and protects me
I can do as please, yet
I only long to return

Everything in its right place
All where it should be
I can see and touch the patterns
Time and space no longer constrain me

I'm drifting in this great nothing
My inhibitions reaching out
My blood runs in the water
It won't be long before they find me

Whirling, hypnotic,
Descending into turbulence
Disrupting the flow of order
Their purpose to emerge and propagate

In turmoil's swirling reaches
I make my home

[Solo: Linus, Hannes]

Whirling, hypnotic
Descending into turbulence

[Solo: Danny, Morean, Christian]

I'm drifting in this great big nothing
Waiting for the stars to disappear
Sinking from sight beneath
Invisible waves
I submerge my consciousness
And dissolve

[Solo: Danny]

Turbulence
Disrupting the flow of order
Their purpose to emerge and propagate

In turmoil's swirling reaches
I make my home
