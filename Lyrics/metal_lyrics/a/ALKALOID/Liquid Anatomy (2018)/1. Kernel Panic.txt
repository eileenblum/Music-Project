[Music: Grossmann, lyrics: Morean]

The mind is willing, but the flesh is stuck
In evolution's lazy stride
The vision dies, the door is locked
Time and again, the dream's denied

Abjure the somatic tether
That binds our world together
Conjure the flesh under will

Spin, spin go the baryons
Round and round, a ballet in stasis
Unchanging they carry on
Lest chance and law start trading places

And lysergic amino acids
Levitate, free and placid
Elevate the woke of our physique

A new wind howls through
The gallery of thoughts
Athwart reality
Kernel panic
Erupts in synaptic galaxies

When descending deep enough
Into the heart of what we are
One soon discovers matter's bluff
Stuff is made nothing at all

A creature of habit is our universe
Profound the terror of the atom,
The molecule, the cell
When forced with change;
To desire it â perverse
Invoking it â an inconceivable hell
Until being dies
And becoming awakens

[Solo: Danny]
[Solo: Christian]

A new wind howls through the
Gallery of thoughts
Athwart reality
Kernel panic
Erupts in synaptic galaxies
