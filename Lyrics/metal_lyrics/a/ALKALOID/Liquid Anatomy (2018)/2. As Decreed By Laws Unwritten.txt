[Music and lyrics: Tunker]

I proclaim my wish
To become one with the darkness
Set ablaze all holy shrines
Desecrate every treacherous sermon

Every holy empire crumbling
Ill tiding for the flocks
Let them choke â on the flesh of their savior
And leave them drowning in his blood

A sickening truth transpires
Like sheep among the lions
Spoilers of life have risen
Corrupting mankind to its core

(Once more) as the world is watching me
(Once more) as the world is watching me

[Solo: Christian]

Enslaving feeble minds
Subvert inscrutable truths
Seeking to control all existence
With their despicable lore

(Once more) as the world is watching me
(Once more) as the world is watching me
Once more as the world is watching

Let the flames be the heralds
Consuming lords and kings
Hear their cries as their reign ends
(As decreed by laws unwritten)
May the mountains bear witness
And the heavens descend
Plunge the whole world into darkness
(As decreed by laws unwritten)

(Once more) as the world is watchingâ¦
I proclaim my desire
(Once more) as the world is watchingâ¦
Their hell shall become real

May they fall never to rise again
Withering in the shade of their non-existent gods

[Solo 'Misery â Lifeblood Of All Faith': Danny]

Let the flames be the heralds
How the cry as their reign ends
May the mountains bear witness
Plunge their world into darkness
