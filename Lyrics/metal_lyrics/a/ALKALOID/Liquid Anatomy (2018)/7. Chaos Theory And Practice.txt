[Music and lyrics: Morean]

Don't aim to please
Aim to dazzle
Time's a disease
An endless frazzle

Chaos, save us
Space cannot defeat us
The ecstasy of entropy
Migrate
Arrive
Repeat

Through space we wheeze
Let's end this hassle
Enormity shall be the key
Our grandest razzle

Chaos, save us
Space cannot defeat us
The ecstasy of entropy
Migrate
Arrive
Repeat

Lurch one

Shear the sphere
Spiral out
As one-shot pusher plates
We've had a lot of time to think

It has to be
The perfect shot
From megayears to nanoseconds
Gone in a blink

Lurch two

Why waste Sirius A
Conveniently in our way
Let's do this right
Triple the supernova blast
A nacelle of sentinels
Cannon sol into the dog star
To harvest our disaster type 1a

And the dice are cast
Set source
Release for impact
We're on the brink
Here goesâ¦.

Lurch three

The gravity of Sirius B
Spurs accretion
Into its monumental sink

Sol Omega

Get the fuck away from me

As the mass of stellar gas
And two collapsing hydrogen infernos
Are hurled into the carbon furnae

One last goodbye
As both stars die
Collapse the cores
And the local fluff shall tremble

Blow up the stars
Collect their mass
Detonate and resemble

Iron poison
To kill the stars

Lurch four

Accelerate
To breaking point
Then catch flying flesh of stars
At 20000 kps
Wrap around it like a mantle
Spin the loot into spheres

Silicates to patch up scars
Gases to collapse and shrink
Into hawking radiation engines
We've had a lot of time to think

There'll be us who'll ride it out in here
Bottom-feeding in four dimensions
And there's us who'll get right out of here
Once we're turning our attentions,

Gregarious, Nefarious, Temerarious,

To Sagittarius A*
Supermassive Typhon
Crowned in magnetars
A Perfect Siphon

The most pro we can gress
We meet in the center
Access and aggress
Concenter

To Sagittarius A*
Supermassive Typhon
Drowned in magnetars
A Perfect Siphon

The most pro we can gress
We meet in the middle
Doomed in this, unless
We solve this riddle

[Solo: Danny]

How to get the fuck out of here
On a quantum singularity
How to get the fuck out of here

Get the fuck out of here

Chaos save us
Get the fuck out of here
Migrate
Arrive
Repeat
