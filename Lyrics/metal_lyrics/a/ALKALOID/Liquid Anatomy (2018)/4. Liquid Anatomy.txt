[Music: Grossmann, lyrics: Morean]

Synethesia
In holy matrimony
With metaplasia

Eyes that form
Where there's truth to behold
Wings born from the need to fly
Flesh under will

Bodily be my magic
My alchemy
Secret my soul
Liquid my anatomy

Somaesthesia
Awakens to sentience
Hyperplasia its vessel

What the mind conceives
From Akasha's unseen flow
Becomes one
With Malkuth's pantheon

Ever-morphing shapes that grow
The spiritual eschaton has begun

[Solo: Danny]

My alchemy
My anatomy
