Your time has come!
Remember the time as entities lived
Which nobody knew
Only believed â only believed

Remember the time as we lived in harmony
With our gods â our gods

Beyond forgotten times
Flagellation my solution

Past is the day as all happened
Past is the life that was
Own and only remain the falcs
Of remembrance which never dies

This time we're weaponed to safe our Throine of Thorns
This time we fight together an union we form

Enchaned legions
Dawn of illusions
Moonshine in shadows
Damned in delusions

Oh almighty
Which name you're even called
We call you Sathanas
SATHANAS
