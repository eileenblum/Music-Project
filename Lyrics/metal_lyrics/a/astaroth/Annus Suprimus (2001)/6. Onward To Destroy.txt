Forward on the battleturn
We ride against you all
Demon rises, Christians burn
I see their crown will fall

Endless in time, memories will call
Rise the banner of hate
Eternal storm for all... all

Blood colored fields
Red colored sky
Mountains left behind
We are onward to destroy

On the path where the light shall die
And eternity ends
On the hills of glory where our fathers reign
We summon us to be one
Against you â Burn

Born with a sign
Mankinds tragedy
A blaze on your side
We fight for your glory
Destroy

Cross my wings, eternal sky
Snowland, Realm
See my raven fly
