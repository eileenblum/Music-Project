Time of transformation
Feelings of hate
Renunciation from this world
Into darkness

Dies mics jeschet borne docsef dovvema Enitemaus
Evil light shines in darkness
Evil light shines on our pagan rites
And the cratures of the night will rise

Darkest night
Demons awake
Cauldron is filles
With spells of blasphemy

Darkest night
Altar awaits
Kneel of blood
See the pentagram of hate

The crown of their church will fall
I can hear the demons call
I fulfill the Pagan Rites
And the creatures of the night will rise
