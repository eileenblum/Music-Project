As I enter tonight - in dark obscure dreams
Of enigmatic lights - in atmospheres supreme
Lost in mourning skies - Heaven is far beyond
Interventional demise - the essence of Meggido's dominion

Innocence is my pure conception
Of esoteric dark damnation
I'm unseen in grotesque spectrums
Arrival of the final constellation
Desire is my unknown name - return to pleasure complete in pain
Tonight

In silence we can hear - your crimson overtures
Whispering destruction storms - once again come forth
Beyond all shadows (you shall) burn - beyond eternity you fade
Cosmic whittered souls - into violent spectral dimensions

The last voyage starts (For those we hate)
Ass immortal passages pasts (Aura of the unforgiven)
Ancient secrets bleed (Frozen ornaments) -
In silent romantic memories
A forsaken breath I feel (On liquid soil)
In Heaven and in space (My kaleidoscope)
Fragments fall on earth (Sculptured jealous tears) -
Spiritual, monumental storms to uiverse

Enter with me the darkside of Eden - 
Ignoring the mourning stars
Enter with me the darkside of Eden - 
Introducing (spiritual) other sides
Into dreams of illusional ecstasy -
Endless energy unleashed jealous apathy

Supremed illusions, seduced dreaming hearts
Brilliant astral peace, velvet obscure eden

This is a dream of Gods' creation - Forced Angels
Take my hand, I'll show you Heaven
Their peace is only spawned illusion - Forced Angels  
Take my hand, I'll show you Heaven
