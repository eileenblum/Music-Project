When the day get  blacker as the darkest night ever
The waters turned to red from the blood of the tortured one
And the vermins marching to the daylight
When the birds of the sky, fall from the quiet trees to
the soil of the earth

Then, the arrivel  of his majesty is near
And we, wait with darkest proud
We slaves of the last eclipse
(And) we, await him now

We, princes of darkness
Accept no Lord of emptiness
We, the princes of darkness
Destroy the holy weakness

We are twelve creatures of the Allmighty 

The Lord of thousand cries
The God of all great beasts
Six slaves of the horned master
And with us, four children of the night

Mea Culpa Corpus Christi
For we have killed your son
We princes of dakrness
Rape the holy whore and destroy your kingdom

The hell will follow us, you will never know our names
With us will come the Astaroth, the producer of all pains
