As death comes over me
My heart will beat no more
And my eyes will close forever
I'll take my last breath and wait;...................and wait

I see my mortal skin, from a place of gold
Now free from my coffin, a seperate  life in freedom;.....endless

Confronted with a light of live
Legions of peace will take my soul away

I searched the dark, denied the light,
give praise, be proud to (and) worship the night

Another Lord the fallen one, you know his name, awaits my soul
Dark Angel called, icon of the underworld, my promised God
Come now, creature of onethousand  names, bring me away,
my king of sacrifice

This was for you, this was for me, this was my ritual suicide
A requiem for the light - is a symphony for the night

And with the night, came the death
