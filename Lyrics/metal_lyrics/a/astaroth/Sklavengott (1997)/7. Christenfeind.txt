Haunted by the light
I take refuge of the darkest night
and prepare to fight

I'll never worship their ridicolous  God
Jeshua ben Joseph, God for foolish men
I'll never kneel in front of the cross
Jehova you liar, I burn your book of lies

I despise your God
Christenfeind

I'm like snow, like an arctic demon,
burying all holy unred a blanket of frost
I'm like the night, like an eternal emptiness
suffocating all light under a blanket of darkness

I suffocate all light
Christenfeind

I will fight against
their spiritual enslavement
against their arrogance

I'll never worship their ridicolous  God
Jeshua ben Joseph, God for foolish men
I'll never kneel in front of the cross
Jehova you liar, I burn your book of lies

See you at war
Jesus, you whore
Christenfeind
