Soul: Welcome to your soul mister. May I invite you in hell?
Mind: Is there anybody out there?
Soul: Just close your eyes and enjoy the hatework.
Mind: What do you want from me? My heart still works.
Soul: But your soul is still dead.
Mind: Oh god... please help... me...
Soul: Sorry mister, the person you try to reach is not longer available
