Connected with systematic lines
To a trigger screen of feelings
Dysfunction of breeding mind
Explores the (principles) theories of being

Towards eternity, they try again
To unbound the secrets of my life
No need for the beating of a heart
Once more they wanted to be god

To hearts (beat) in one
An offbeat harmony
As my soul is trapped, but my body is free

Closed eyes awakes a deadline
To reflect the thoughts of inner tongues
Experiments bizarre (so) obscene
Hold back your soul, it just goes on

Leaving now the limits of wisdom
to reach dreams, the source of soul
Behold dimensions, no closed systems
Surrounded by his mind control

A demise of time â blinded to see
As a life to learn â flashbacks, fantasy

Like a soul in flames like here on earth
A damned evolution getting worth
As a voice proclaims, open your eyes
They found my inner paradise

Soulcloned, Soulcloned...
He's reaching out for what you (can) feel
What you can taste, smell â what you have seen

Like a soul in flames like here on earth
A damned evolution getting worth
As a voice proclaims, open your eyes
They found my inner paradise

They cloned my soul

Two hearts â one soul to be
As my mind is raped, but my spirit is free
