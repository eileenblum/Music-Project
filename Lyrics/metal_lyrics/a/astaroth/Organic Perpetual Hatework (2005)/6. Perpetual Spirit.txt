Riding on the winds of darkness with untold secrets deep inside
The innocent betrayer nailed by courage to be sacrificed
Illuminate the inner demons to slay his justice promises
Compassion of the elements are proved to fail this process faith
Distance â so far beyond in (spectral) skies
This cynic icons force mournful to my mind
Darkness â of fear to swap away â the powers â to unleash the judgment day
Arrogance â the principles of grace are fading paralysed existence of him away

The arrival of the beast â reveals to be unleashed
To celebrate grotesque â salvation of our wrath

With hands of blood given to rule â the consistence for life is worth beyond his pool
Our gathering is raged with zero tolerance â who wants to disappear gets punished by our strength

Discover â the secret issued breed â inside this theories â the principles of fate
So manual â endless perpetual â the minds apart â as the spirits of our hate

My poisoned tongue brings words of hell â to thou
Enchanted hymns for last farewell â to go
Unethical tools to reincarnate â no light
We are perpetual spirits of hate â tonight

We bring forth the death â to the natures of birth
Time is near to set free â his gifts of worlds' misery
We have sworn this oath â with perfection to kill
Perverts creations of god â for our perpetual will

Ill-natured spirits wake aside identities of outer space
Led bitter praying whores of creed with ecstasy this ways
Blinded are the blind to see of what was written and been done
The innocent open their eyes â a revenge has begun
So manual â endless perpetual â our spirits go ahead
To erase and end up all

My poisoned tongue brings words of hell â to thou
Enchanted hymns for last farewell â to go
Unethical tools to reincarnate â no light
We are perpetual spirits of hate â tonight
