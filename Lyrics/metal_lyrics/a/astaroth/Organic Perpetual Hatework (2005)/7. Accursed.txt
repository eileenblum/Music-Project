A shadow in the night
Feeding on blood, flesh and souls
Once burnt alive
Killed but not dead
Seeking bloody revenge
An eternal fight

Ancient spirits bestowed me â immortality
Immortality â as malediction

I am
Accursed â my veins are demonized
Accursed â by ancient gods
Damned â to hunt their souls
Life â my mortal agony

Awakened beneath the earth
Between mangled, bloody bones
An incantation â unholy blasphemies
To resurrect from my grave
Lust to kill â drives my brain
Anger runs through my veins

Killing is my destiny
Not able to resist

I am
Accursed â my veins are demonized
Accursed â by ancient gods
Damned â to hunt their souls
Life â my mortal agony

I am fighting against my curse
To regain humanity â to regain mortality
To escape from my undead existence â to rest in peace

I am
Accursed â my veins are demonized
Accursed â by ancient gods
Damned â to hunt their souls
Life â my mortal agony

Resistance is illusion, the devil is inside me
A summoner of eternal darkness
