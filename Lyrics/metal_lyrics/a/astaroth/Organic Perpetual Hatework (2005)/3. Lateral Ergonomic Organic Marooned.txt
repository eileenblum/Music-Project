As your eyes are closed
Reaching out to see
Sleeps hidden deep inside
Two (energetic) personalities

So many years unknown
Perfect it wants to be
Hypnotised intentions
Await â to be set free

Feels like a journey to my mind
In search your spirits left behind
Flashbacks the level of confusions
I explored the keeper of illusions

We are the lowest forms of life
In unknowledge we're still unite
We live beyond â we want to be
Like trapped (existence) in endless surreality

I am two entities â I am separated tuned
But still one character â like lateral ergonomic organic marooned

As my eyes are open
The system we won't to see
Subconscious down
The level of my energy

Feels like a journey to my mind
In search of spirits left behind
Flashbacks the level of confusions
I explored the the keeper of illusions

We are the lowest forms of life
In unknowledge we're still unite
We live beyond â we want to be
Like trapped (existence) in endless surreality
