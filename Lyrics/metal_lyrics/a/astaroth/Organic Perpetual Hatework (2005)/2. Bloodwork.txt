(Let's start the hatework)
Dream of hidden beings in genetic styles
As burial released effects â identities unite

I haven't slept for just one year
As mind and soul collapse â my spirit disappears
Those blackened coil ablazed â abduction of the astral kind forsake
Those dogma forms embraced â as misanthropic minds awake

Entering â the entering pain
Duality â within duality

My passion past their empty shell
Trough lust they crawl unleashed in hell
Dark voices deep inside. no battle can't resists the force
This caged beast tonight â brings judgement to those insane hordes

Blood â beyond divine fragments
Beneath the limits caught â the consequence of ignorance
Work â come see my mind at work
Deep from my heart it works
I'll be out there with bloodwork

The personalities replaced, the sense of spirits senseless waste
Designed identities erased, I'll bring you home

Onwards to spheres of mankind
Towards passages, seduce a dream
The answers are searched
And (wait) to be set free

Come enforce my soul â the things get out of control
In search of your entity â there is no perfect harmony
So these blood on my hands. Is a reroute to remain

As my dark sides invite â work of blood still unite
As these works have been done â self solution may come

Entering the pain
Within duality in vein

So I have slept for just one year
As mind and soul unite â my spirit gets unreal
Dark voices deep inside â the silence have revealed the force
This levelled beast tonight â brought justice to the holy hordes

Blood â beyond divine fragments
Beneath the limits caught â the consequence of ignorance
Work â come see my mind at work
Deep from my heart it works
I'll be out there with bloodwork
