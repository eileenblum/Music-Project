Inside my mind it dwells
The secret voices of my faith
No longer I can seek the truth
The feelings go insane

So just forgive me
For what may come

I call you enemy
I call you just messiah
I'm splitted up in two alone
I'm trough and lost in suffer

No longer I can wait
As your wrath is looking down to me
My mind is stolen and prisoned
So you given just birth to me... you given just to me

I call you enemy
I call you just messiah
I'm splitted up in two alone
I'm trough and lost in suffer... I'm through and lost in pain and suffer

Lay down and cry
Pray, fall and die

In time my mind was solved apart
You bringing down to me
Inside this mind
This breeding life has just begun... bring genocide to me

I call you enemy
I call you just messiah
I'm splitted up in two alone
I'm trough and lost in suffer... I'm through and lost in pain and suffer
