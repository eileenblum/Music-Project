You left me here feeling broken
Kicked me to the dirt and walked away
From your selfishness and unforgiving words, I had to pick up all pieces
So now I finally get up, and get back to the road I knew, watching the flames on this bridge you burned
'Cause it lights the path you'll never tread and you'll be the one left with nothing in the end
I'll take these words and hope it leaves you with nothing
Ive found peace in my misery
I don't wanna feel this anger
I just wanna watch you burn
From the damage done and the line I walked
For you, on this burning tightrope
It cuts deeper then wounds you see
With no one here to save me
Take the eyes of this storm and leave you with nothing
Remain, sustain, consequences
You weren't there to see the life you left behind
You just fell up into selfish arms of another man
Home wrecker
You're just a harlot in disguise
My eyes are hollow
And I can't grip this sorrow
Holding onto pain, and the fear I have instilled
It's what's kept me whole
Thriving in the shadows
With no one here to save me
Take the eyes of this storm
And leave you with nothing.
