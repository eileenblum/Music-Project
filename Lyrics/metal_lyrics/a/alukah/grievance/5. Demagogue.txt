Rusted gates from the tears of crying masses
Nailing in the silence on a cross of broken bones
The words preached aren't for forgiveness
They're only hear to fill the void
And comfort the arms of a lonely God
Who turned his back on your world

There will be no comfort
Only separation
These words you stood behind
But refused to act in the way we live
Let it come full circle
As it stems across your crooked veins
Carry on,claim your forgiveness
It won't be enough to be saved
From gods cruel hands

Your God must be lonely looking down on the hate we provide
You preach love and warmth
But in return you gave us warfare and genocide...
I hope you reach those rusted gates
They collapse upon your backs
So you can look into your saviors eyes
As he sets your soul ablaze

It's not enough....

Inner peace is found within the soul
But we kill off each other in the name of love
Cause we were born to choke

We were born to fucking choke

There will be no comfort just separation
These words
You stood behind
Let it come, full circle.....
