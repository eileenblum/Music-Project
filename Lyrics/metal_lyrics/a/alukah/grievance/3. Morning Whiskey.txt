Slipping further away
Can't catch your breath from the currents ahead
You know the worst is yet to come
But you just close your eyes

Are you blinded by pride
Or away for your dirty hands
As you hold your breath for me
Cause I can see, that you can't save yourself
And it's not enough to ask for your word when, these scars cut deeper
Then we could ever see
Cut this tension as you fall under the silence

So all that's left is memories
And they cut to fucking deep

Morning whiskey numbs the pain
(Morning whiskey numbs the pain)
Removing yourself as you stepped away
Bottom of the barrel bled the Tennessee river.......dry!

Morning whiskey!

Leaned your head back and slowly slipped away
Emotion lies in the wake of your dreams
Holding onto what's left me
You lost the will to live as the sun came up...

Now all that's left is memories
And the cut to fucking deep

Morning whiskey numbs the pain
Removing yourself as you stepped away
Bottom of the barrel bled the Tennessee river
Dry!

Bled it dry
Morning whiskey
Numb this pain....
