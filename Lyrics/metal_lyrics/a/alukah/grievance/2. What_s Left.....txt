Silence on your tongue speaks a thousand words
As we hold our breath in fear of finding answers to stones we left unturned...
Closed minds bury shallow graves
So why do we choose to live that way
Point your finger in the mirror
And accept wearing this shame
We don't deserve the right
Yet we're the ones to blame
So let the water begin to rise...
Fate sealed shut when our minds went numb
And the water began to rise
We can't hold our breath long enough to find truth within the road
We just close off our minds
Hope didn't come on time
So we settled for our own demise
We closed our minds and begged for fucking answers
But we're to weak to see the torch
So let us drown in sorrow
We're too fucked to see tomorrow..
We can find the door...
We cut the throat of our youth...
Fate sealed shut when our minds went numb
And the water began to rise.
