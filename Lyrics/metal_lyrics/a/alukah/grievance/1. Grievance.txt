Hands to the dirt, as we accept the pain....
It's gonna cut you down when you fade away
Trying to cover up shit with the shit you've been giving
Hopeless hearts feel nothing to your touch
You'll just burn like the rest of the fucking cowards
The cruel hand of karma will collapse around you
Waiting for your move in a room of broken glass
Hands to the dirt as we accept this ducking pain
Of digging our own graves in places that we stand
We are rotting, designing our own slow death

So let these violins ring a solemn prayer for the weakened ones
Cut open your hands

Hang you up high

Dig your own fucking grave, you rat
It's gonna cut you down when you fade away
Trying to cover up shit with the shit you've been giving
Hopeless hearts feel nothing to your touch
You'll just burn like the rest of the fucking cowards
Trapped like a rat
I hope life kicks you to the fucking dirt
So you can dig up all you have left
Trapped like a rat in a cage of your own misery
Hands to the dirt as we accept this pain of digging our own graves

It's gonna cut you down when you fade away
Trying to cover up shit with the shit you've been giving
Hopeless hearts feel nothing to your touch
You'll just burn like the rest of the fucking cowards
