Cries of joy, a helpless cause
Memories lost, insanity
Guilty mind, innocent blood
Spread for one, so helplessly
Death for one, no escape
Freedom be just steps away
Bargains bought, roaming free
Victims pray

Try to save
Forget the memories of today
Reach for the final breath
Born to be
Silent curse, mindless pain
Plagued by the surgeon's keys

Thoughts of pain, running wild
Bearing down upon one's mind
Unrightful justice in control
Changing time to time
Offering lessons to learn
Destruction carefree concern
Sinister lay awaiting
Observer closes the keys
