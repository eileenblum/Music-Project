Wasting days with the games that he plays
Something is just not right
Signs of weakness from an unknown sickness
Showing symptoms overnight

Hide from friends then try to make amends
By offering  peace from your sacrificial pipe
Try to change from a life that's so deranged
But don't give up without a fight

NO PLEASURE without pain
Not a single thing will you own
Not a single thing will you gain
One man's ecstasy
Synthetic dreams
Brought forth by hands made of gold
Left to die with tarnished memories
