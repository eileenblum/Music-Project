As lifeless as the midnight air
Into the eyes of the unknown
A void separation of mind
There's no way out for your soul
Do you remember the ashes of war ?
That opened up your door...
... to new worlds of darkness
Where the system of terror had begun

Sins exploit the key to your past
And for time ... it is the end
This endless horror has destroyed my life
And it's haunting once again
Oh, Mother Earth send me the powers of the night
So my soul will remain haunting
Haunting once again!

I'm just a victim of this never-ending nightmare
Where concrete souls collide
I've seen the magic that embeds the earth
And the memories that have died

You were so brave and you were so free
But now you suffer so painfully
Your mind is gone and you've lost your way
The dreams are real and now you pay for your ...

Visions of a memory that drove me so insane
A time for me to take control and help me break the chain
Secrets of my hidden wisdom helps my soul grow strong
Taking on my deepest fears that trapped me here for so long
