Did he have any discipline
And did he get to school on time
No different from anyone else
But they say he's a psycho !
But we raised you so well
Why did you play with the fire ?
This is hell, your new home
The American Zone... 1990...

Opinions do not exist, your mind is owned
And as for your life, you've got your future on hold

Heaven and hell, what do they all mean
It's  not what you make it to be

"20/20" you're going in circles
Do you know real from make-believe ?

Talking and listening, which do you choose ?
It's not a game of win or lose !

Take the time to figure it out
Take a good look and realize
This shit is real, yeah it's real !

Somebody take me away from here
What did I do to deserve this ?
What makes me so unacceptable
And makes you so perfect

Your future's on hold forever
