Darkness, trapped, building up control
Becoming a victim of your own sanity
Simple thoughts becomes and comes again
The rain falls dripping dry

Common wonder strange upon deranged
Freedom that locks you in a cage
Tunnels, falling, surrounding your soul
Blackness blinding, forever the soul

Justified, the problem is to know
Life that's dead before a helping seed is sprung
Breaths that are poisoning
Streams absorbing feelings of my sorrow
Sleepless, filling in your eyes
Something that you thought could never be unsolved
Calmness, the paranoia
Laughing with the game that brings you to die

Trapped around the game, darkness fills your open eyes
Forcing your pain, ignorance messing with your mind
Warning, the piece of flesh
Reach, reach out to the world
Lies, nightmares
Freedom that you found by falling deep astray
Awaken to the darkness that traps your life away
Life that's living to a wasted prophecy
Dying by a death that's happened helplessly

Scorching, blaze forces a still
Rhyme scheme beholds common fear
Creative, killing, enjoying cruelty
Independence stabs you in the back

Pounding down the sharpened quest
Leaving scars throughout your mind
Screaming, silence, whispered in around
Echoing voices filling up the sounds
