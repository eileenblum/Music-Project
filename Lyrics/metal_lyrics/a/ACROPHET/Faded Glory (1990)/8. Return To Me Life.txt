From nowhere at all what can it be
Unstoppable power grabs hold set me free
Darkened my eyesight fades show me the light
Confusion, delusions, insanity return to me life

Hot flash -- bone chilling cold rips through my veins
No laughs -- Acrophetamins deaden the pain
A movie's hell brought to life
Set me free

Feeling my energy drain unwreckable wall
Adrenalin melting my brain my saviour I call
Ready to meet my maker feeling his might
Last chance to give return to me life

Wake from madness
The smoke has cleared
A single moment
The end was near
