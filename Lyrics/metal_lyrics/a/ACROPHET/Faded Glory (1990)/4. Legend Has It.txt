Voices in the darkness sound like our own
Under the skies of God I've watched the people grow
For seven days and nights I've traveled far and wide
I still can't find an answer but God knows how hard I've tried

What happened to the life I led so long ago
What has become of me
Some say I've trapped myself in this world
Somehow legend has it

How long must we live in sin
You've taken away our rights
If you think the battle is over
You'll never win the fight
You'll never win

I think of all the times I could have changed my life
But I was so unsure, unsure of my mind
I think I figured it out, for too long I've been blind

What makes me feel this way

Legend has it
