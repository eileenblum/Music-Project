Break through depression from inside
Lost hope seems to be a state of mind
Can't stand it, hate the way I feel
Forced to dream of things that are surreal

Living hell
Can't subside
Fear existence
Count the reasons why

Put to death, my mortal soul
Heaven help me, my blood flows thin and cold
Race insanity, walk the line
Bad impression seen through selfish eyes

Abstain repression when it's useless to resist
The main objective is to sever thought being sane

Frustration, anger think about the cause
Fight a fight within yourself can't let the feeling go
An answer must be figured out to keep the system strong
An uncontrolled desire to dominate the soul

Little by little memories go bleak
The price you pay, the words you say a steady flow you seek
When time stands still give a little shove
When all seems lost that's time to rise above
