Can't hold back, must let go
Adrenalin search, arteries burst and head feels blown
Can't explain, gone insane
Twisted being burning everymore inside a...

...world of dreams isn't what it seems
The pain I feel just seems so unreal
It's been taken much too far
And now society...
...society leaves its scars

Pronounced unfit, a human waste
Trapped inside a dingy gate
Never did know wrong from right

Won't deny, don't ask why
Life is hell trapped inside a madman's spell
Mystic hate
Trapped inside has brought me endless...

...time to think, oh God what have I done ?
Now I hide because I cannot run
Fear surrounds me and it has found me

Feel the pain that burns inside your head
My nightmare becomes your reality
Bodies that are lying beholds your deaths defying
The anger never before seen
Echoes by sounds of voices underground
Deeper in silent insanity
