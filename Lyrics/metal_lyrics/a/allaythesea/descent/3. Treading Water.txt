say your worst

to my face
i know you want
more than
i can give

since the beginning of time
Ive fooled around within your sight
not giving a fuck what you think
coz you are nothing to me

you are what itches beneath my lip
i want to pull you from my ribs

no theres nothing to see
for whats been done to you

makes my life that much easier
makes my mind so much more relaxed

forget this face
forget that life

you think you see eye to eye
but what i see within you
just passes by

turbulence
rocks your buried memories
are you sick of me yet?

see what ive accomplished
see what i have overcome
when you look my way,
i hope the jealousy...

eats you alive

i want to forgive
i want to forget
but its back through time now
no turning back

no turning back
youve become what ive always hated

you are what i hate
