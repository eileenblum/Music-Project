He sits in lonliness,
watch him waste away
knives in a casket
heart between the blades
soul taken from him,
how could you take his soul?
hand full of liquor, to make it quicker
why take his soul?

it was a simple fucking day
no poisen, no cuts, no pain

dove soaring high, above him
bearing the message of shame

one swallow
twenty circlular deaths
forty torturess times
three years, no less
now youve
forgotten him
youve left him
behind

he cried to the sky,
he cried to the stars,
he cried to his god
but nothing so far

can it really be true?
this omen cant confuse a mind without a key
but cannons were fired,
burying all hopes to the sea

blood dripping
to the end of the bottle
of empty promises
in his hand
blue lips of the devil
weighting his fate down
sounds in the distance
he doesnt understand

help him god
bring her back

so he cried to the sky
and he cried to the stars
nothing will bring her back
he removes his scars

so he he cried to the sky
and he cried to the stars

let me free

these wounds will never
be forgotten

these wounds will never
be replaced
