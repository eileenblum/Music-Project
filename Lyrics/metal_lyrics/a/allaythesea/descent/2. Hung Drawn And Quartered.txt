this a time
when all we remember is in the past
in the past where it all belongs
the longing to find something
within these hollow grounds
well lead me to my death

and there i shall
stay within
these minds will
take away the heart Ive surely earn t

for now you see
this hour-glass
wastes away
the sand at which your feet lay

this feeling will chose this path

tidal waves
take away the homes been built from stone
where the rest of time
eats away at nothingness inside
there's no turning from me
for the way you seem
sunshine
is covered by the clouds above

here comes the storm
lightning crashes to the grave
if this is,
what you would want me to be?

here comes the storm
lightning crashes to my grave
if this is...
tell me what you want me to be.

follow me
if you see
an escape to my world 
swallow me
i can be
the air to your life

my hatred cant,
end this now,
because you are
so blind

because your blind

follow me
if you see
an escape to my world 
swallow me
i can be
the air to your life

the air to your life
