just months have passed by,
was the last time you said this to me
i want to freeze this time
ill end myself, before i take another lie

ill stare right into your eyes

ill say it this time
say what Ive held, for all these years
liquidate my fears
concrete this sweat

so come this way

close your eyes
make no noise

dont let me escape
from your heart
dont let me escape
from your mind

nows not the time
to tell me it was the truth all along.
youve failed me
and now youve proven what

what was my worst nightmare.
proctecting you from your own
got down me on my knees
screaming for a lie

tell me what i need   
to hear                    

all the things that you said 
all the things you'd done
when did you become so worthless?     
why did you leave me behind?           

why did you leave me behind?

how do you feel now
now all you lived for, is gone
read my hopeless words              
after me

you'll be no more

i thought id keep her
