Time marches on, you are left behind
Nobody cares if you live or you die
The powers that be they just can't find the time
To care for their own, now that's surely a crime
What can you do
When they turn their backs
While feed other nations
You know it's a fact

Forgotten no one to turn to
Forgotten society's burn
Forgotten left on the street
Forgotten should never be

We police all the world but we still fail to see
The problems that plague our democracy
The lack of humanity boggles my mind
While the government plays deaf, dumb and blind
Deaf, dumb and blind
Deaf, dumb and blind
Deaf, dumb and blind
You're like a disease
They won't look for a cure
Just let you fade away
Won't have to see you, anymore
