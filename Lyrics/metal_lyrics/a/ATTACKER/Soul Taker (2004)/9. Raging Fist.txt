Seasons change like night and day
This one being night
In shadows of solitude
Situation now arise
What's this they tell me
The tale of his sins
En route to emptiness
Relive the brutality

Here the raging fist
Feel the stinging kiss
Riots incite underground
In search of the man
Lifetime on the run
Oh what misery
Dragged through the mud and stone
The trial now unfolds
Violence and terror
It must now be told

Child on the run
What has been done
Prayers can't you see
Don't deny me
Master I beg you
What should I do
Silence! You're guilty
I hereby sentence you...now!
Mother don't forsake me
I'm your only son
I never bore you
As far as I know

Years, tears pass on
Inside the cell
Eyes, dead on me
What's on their minds
Silent and afraid "mercy"! I cried
Now I'm surrounded
Situations done on me
