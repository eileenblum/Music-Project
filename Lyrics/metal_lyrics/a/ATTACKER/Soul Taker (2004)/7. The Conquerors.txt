Victory and glory
Are all that you see
Conquer your enemies
Before they flee
Look at the fear
It gleams in their eyes
Realize tonight they may die

What will they do
Where will they go
Surrounded on all sides
Fight all their foss
Warriors we are
Fight to the death
A spirit born in us
To conquer our quest

We are the conquerors
Hail mighty warriors
We are the conquerors
Fear mighty warriors

Victory is ours now
So much blood on my sword
Enemy's beaten
Kingdom is ours
