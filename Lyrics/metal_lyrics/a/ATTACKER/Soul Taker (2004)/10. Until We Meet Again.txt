The days pass us in time
I don't want to learn of life too late
And then when they are gone
We seem to fill up with self hate

I wish I could have been
There to say my last goodbye
You never knew I cared
But then I never thought you'd die
I wonder why it was
I acted like a careless fool
I stand here all alone and wonder why is life so cruel

Your memory's forever, it can never die
Until we meet again
I know you're in a, in a better place now
In your loved ones embrace
I can't forget the day
That brought the news that you were gone
The pain inside my heart
It never stops, it just keeps on
I never got to say
The things I think and really feel
I wish this were a dream
Oh how I wish it wasn't real

Your soul will last forever, it can never die
Until we meet again
I know you're in a, in a better place
In your loved ones embrace

So as I sit here in my pain
I wonder of we'll meet again
And if we never meet again
Forgive me please for what I've been
