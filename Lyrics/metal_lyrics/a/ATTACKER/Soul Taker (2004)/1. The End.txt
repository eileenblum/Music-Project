Lightning flashers in swollen skies
Thunder rumbles, angels cry
Storms are coming from heavens above
The beginning of the end, has just begun

You were told (to clean up your act, you've got only one chance)
You've been warned (the wrath of the gods would come in every form)
You should have known (to scorn mother nature, deface her creation)
It's now too late
She is judge and jury time to ate your fate
Polar caps melting, tides on the rise
Volcanoes erupting, lava slides
Temperatures rising, planets dying
End is coming, people crying

Lightning flashers in swollen skies
Thunder rumbles, angels cry
Temperatures rising, planets dying
End is coming, people crying
