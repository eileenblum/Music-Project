A story is told, of a demon like man
Way back in the dark, a forsaken land

Taker of souls into the depths of hell
Taker of souls on earth he dwells
Taker of souls can you hear the cries
Taker of souls why do they have to die
A legend tells, of the vicious beast
Attacking the land, killing the weak

Hacking, slashing they fought the beast
Bodies lie scattered slaughtered sheep
Take on this creature, may be too strong
Fate of the village, destiny's born
Oh destroy the beast
Oh destroy the beast
Fought like true soldiers, for family and god
Losing no option, carry on
Women and children lives are at stake
With blood and sweat they died that day
Oh destroy the beast
Oh destroy the beast
Destroy the beast...
He'll take your soul, to hell, to hold
You'll never, be free again his servant until life's end
Can't fight this unholy force
In hell, life takes it's course
In hell, life takes it's course
