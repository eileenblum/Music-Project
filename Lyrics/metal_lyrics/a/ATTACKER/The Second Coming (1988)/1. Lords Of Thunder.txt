Nothing you do can prevent them
They're the keepers of the land
Nothing we do can even fight them
They can crush us with a hand

They're turning your head
Make you look at the dead in their eyes

Nothing you see is reality
You can feel it in your soul
No one you touch will even pity you
Be prepared to pay the toll
Nothing you hear will be total truth
When you're in a darkened hole

They're the lords of thunder
They've come up from under the ground
Nothing you say will make them listen
They're the only ones who are heard
Nothing you dream will be make believe
It can fool you with its word
Nothing you plead will have mercy
They're the hell rats who love war
Nothing you hope will ever happen
They're the key and they've locked the door

They're the lords of thunder
Their thunder has destroyed the world
