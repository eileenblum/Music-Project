All nations are summoned
Prepare for destruction
They're coming for judgment
Pray for their salvation

Scream out with sorrow
There's no tomorrow
Man wonders who's coming
The savior or beast
Life withers, oceans roar
Will we starve or feast

Scream out with sorrow
There's no tomorrow

Through the smoke, in the skies
I can see Emanon fall
As they come sorting out like numbers
The good from the bad

Now all of my allies
Have fallen to the ground
All evil has conquered
He's risen to the sky
