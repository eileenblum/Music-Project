The kings that rule visions
Their visions entangle your minds
Sound of footsteps behind you
Makes sanity so hard to find

Minutes seem like days
While you wait in fear
Hours seem like years
Knowing destiny's here

The queens that launch soldiers
Launch soldiers that cut like a knife
And the peddler of fortune
Tries to make deals to barter your life

Minutes seem like days
While you wait in fear
Hours seem like years
Knowing destiny's here

Well the bride of misfortune
Tries to make you look and believe
With her body of beauty
And her heart that can only deceive
While the souls of the perished
Make you listen and look at the light
Try to give you the courage
To stand up and go for the fight

Minutes seem like days
While you wait in fear
Hours seem like years
Knowing destiny's here
