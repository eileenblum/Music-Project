Who is the one
Who has put out the sun
Mother earth filled with fire
From the words of a liar
Stands the men with no minds
Who are the leaders of the blind
As the one plants the seed
Who can make all of us bleed

Please hear the cry
Of the ones who will die
As he raises his hand
Forcing fire through the land
Now the plague starts to spread
To the brave ones who have fled
But comes a man with no fear
Of the tyrant who is here
Smashing downward his blade
Forcing vengeance he has made

All is gone, nothing at all is heard
Because it has all been done before
But no one ever has learned

He has come to conquer the one
Destroy the man who has put out the sun

Crushing words of a liar
His vengeance has come to put out the fire

He has come to conquer the one
Destroy the man who has come to put out the sun
Condemn the one who has come up from hell
