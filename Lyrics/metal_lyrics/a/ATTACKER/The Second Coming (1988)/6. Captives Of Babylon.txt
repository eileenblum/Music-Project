Over raging seas
Crossing desert sands
Armies conquer the land

Captives cry for freedom
Chained without reason
Enslaving of man
Pagan feasts they rage in glory
Worship idols without worry
They live for the gold

People die with their families
Because they pray to their god
They treasure their soul

Gods of power rage like thunder
Gods of wealth wage war
Kings of fury rule the power
Chains of Babylon's soldiers roar

Slaves of hope await salvation
Swarmed in masses the time has come
Wicked ruler falls from power
Life's righteousness will be done
