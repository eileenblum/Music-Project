Nightmares of terror
Keeper of sin
An unspoken evil
That traps him within

Madness is building inside of him
Terror is taking control
Wickedness rules beside him
His terror will only console

Led by sickness That takes away lives
If you're dreaming alone
You might meet his knives

Few people said much about him
No one has lived to be sure
When sudden darkness surrounds you
Be sure to lock all your doors

Allies of darkness
Streets with no light
His arena of madness
Where you stand for your fight

No one has ever defeated him
No one has stared in his eyes
No one has moved fast and quickly
Those who move slowly will die
