Fallen ruins of a race no more
Winds howl with silence as they roar
Masses fight the crown we defend
Waiting for their savior to descend
They look for their salvation
Escape their own damnation
To the end
An island of sacrifice was once filled with violence
An island of sacrifice and rituals untold
The presence of evil is disguised as tranquil
A disguise when looked at is filling us all

Spirits of the restlessness
Drinking wine of the dead

Revealing the evil is part of the terror
A terror which cuts down all in its way
The haunting of demons are trying to pillage
A haunting that shivers you right through
Your soul

Spirits of the restlessness
Drinking of the dead

As we sit and wonder of it all
All the untold secrets of before
