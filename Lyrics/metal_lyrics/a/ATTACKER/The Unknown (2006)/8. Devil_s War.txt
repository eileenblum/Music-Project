Marching into war
Misery fills us all

Dread of our death
Permeates that we sense
Fear of death
Rings in my head

Battlefield lay strait ahead
No surrender now
Itâs life or death

Dread of our death
Permeates that we sense
Fear of death
Rings in my head

Fight like the devil
No one shall be spared

Mighty are we all?
Fight for the devil
Or we fall

Fight like the devil
No one shall be spared
Fight like the devil
No life shall be spared

Many a soldier
Take his fall
Now a machine
Will destroy all

Fight like the devil
No one shall be spared
Fight like the devil
No life shall be spared
