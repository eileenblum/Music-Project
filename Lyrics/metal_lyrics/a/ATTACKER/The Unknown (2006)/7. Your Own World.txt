I see through the broken side of your life
A wall made up of nothing but lies
Iâll never be inside the world you call your own

I cannot surrender to this grieving
My pride is crying for relief, again
Why does my faith test my belief
What have I done?
Show me the truth
Show me proof
Show me substance

Youâve been used
Iâve been too
Where should I begin

Standing back, see myself
Outside looking in

You were there
Always there
Like youâve always beenâ¦

Show me truth
Show me proof

In your own world
All hope has diedâ¦ inside
Whatâs done cannot be made undone

But in the real world
The hope is still alive
Whatâs done can always be undone
Whatâs lost is never left behind

Left behind
Left behind
