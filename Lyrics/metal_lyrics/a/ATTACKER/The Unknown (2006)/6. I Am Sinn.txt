Face your hate
Face your fate
Bleed your tears
Bleed your fears

A secret knock
A new world to enter
A secret knock
Hatred has won

Awake slowly rise
Decide agonize
Shrouds of dirt
Shrouds of poison

Enter the light, come from your darkness
Nothing you do will set me free
Enter my earth, gather your zealots
Nothing you say can make me see

Create, decimate
Thatâs who I am
Who am I?
I am sinn
