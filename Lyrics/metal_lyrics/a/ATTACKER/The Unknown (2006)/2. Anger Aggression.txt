Lost my mind
Have need, it feeds
From deep inside
Hatred will rise

[Chorus:]
Feel the anger
The aggression
Hear the anger
The aggression

Out of control
Dark thoughts, take hold
Brain cells divide
Whatâs coming, canât hide

[Chorus]

No turning back
Too late, gonna crack
Damage is done
Anger has won

No turning back
Too late, gonna crack
Damage is done
Anger has won

[Chorus]

Anger

Feel it now
