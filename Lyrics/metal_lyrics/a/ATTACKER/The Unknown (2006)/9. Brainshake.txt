You made it all so wrong
When all the time it was right

Accuse, abuse brainshake
Whoâll lose, we do brainshake

You ate my world broken heart
Weâre now a world apart

Accuse, abuse brainshake
Whoâll lose, we do brainshake
Combust, no trust, brainshake
We try, then die brainshake

Trapped within my rage
Lights out my mental cage
A deadly bribe, cerebral bribe
Cannot will not describe
