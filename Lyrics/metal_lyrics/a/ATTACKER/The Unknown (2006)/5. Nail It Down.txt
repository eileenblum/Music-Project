Four beasts in one man
Soaring down
Shrieks aloud
Fate steals with silent tread
We lived a thousand deaths

By the throat nail it down

Three beasts in one man
Grotesque enigma
Danger gathers
Treasures rise
A fortnight now itâs time
By the throat nail it down
Crush its spine nail it down

Two beasts become one
Weâve fed off our fright
Now unmasked, now revealed
Itâs no worse than you or I
