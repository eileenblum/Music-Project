The moon is full again
Dilating eyes begin to change
Shape shifting, shooting pain
Dominates my body, intense strain
Reborn eternally
New victim smiles while she bleeds

What will become of me (of me)

Sustaining life
My thirst is pure indulgence
Blessed with this curse
My thirst becomes my sentence
Sustaining life
My thirst is pure indulgence
Blessed with this curse
My thirst becomes my hell

Existing tragically
Alive by night
Dead by light
Once was the prince of peace
Now I am king of the damned
Left behind lifeâs remorse
Stand tall in shadows, feel the force

What has become of me (of me)
