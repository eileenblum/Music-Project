Runs through your veins
A surge of chaos
Metal takes control

Harness the light
Torches of fire
Loudness takes control

This is power

Crashing through walls
A wrecking machine
Metal takes control

Kill the foundation
Keeping it true
Loudness takes control

Skies turn to black
Grounds will crumble
Metal takes control

Roar of the strong
Armies of madness
Loudness takes control

This is power
