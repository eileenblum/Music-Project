Burning red
Within my eyes
All knowing despair
Deep down inside
Dark deceiver
Betrayer of man
Blackest of hearts

[Chorus:]
Escape the unknown
Be led to your demise
Escape the unknown

Spiraling down
Out of control
Swirling confusion
I just canât know
Being pulled
To the left and right
My faith is dying

[Chorus]

Burning red
Within my eyes
Lights going out
Iâm losing I know
Tore my heart
Wonât let go
This is my moment

[Chorus]

You are a riddle
Yet you shrink from me
You are beggar
Yet you take from me
Crawling inward
Fear can dominate
Find the answer
Find the answer

You are a beggar
Yet you took from me
You are a crawler
Yet you walk from from me
Free of your will
Fear will dominate
Find the answer
Find the answer

â¦you wonât
