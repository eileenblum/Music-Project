Rise up to your last hope
Rise up end of your rope
Reveal the tragic moment
Scattered among the ashes

Buried in walls of steel
Manger of death loss for feel

A face is dealt
An ace is dealt
Fear of disgrace
Cause carries on
A face is dealt
An ace is dealt
Fear of disgrace

Raging out of control
Cross the bridge
Pay your last toll
Death is truest of all
Promises rise and fall

Rise up to your last hope
Rise up end of your rope
Death is truest of all
Promises rise and fall
