Higher, higher the dragon soars
People fear his majestic roars
Louder, louder the storm brews
Killing the ship's almighty crew
No, no more despair

Slay the monster if you dare
No, no more despair
Call on the attacker
Call on the attacker

In the wind the children cry
All their loves had to die
Dark and wild waves the sea
No weapons left for me

In the wind the children cry
All their loves had to die
Attacker fights for your glory
Blood and guts all so gory
What now!
