I turn around, it's so unreal,
Dreadful sight, bloodstained steel
Reality begins to fade
All i see is slayer's blade
A warrior who feats on doom
Gathers darkness provokes gloom
Hang 'em high on gallow's pole
Slayer's blade will take your soul

Somehow I feel I don't belong
Hauntingly he chants his song
Dead soldiers in the field
Slayer's blade will not yield

A warrior who feats on doom
Gathers darkness provokes gloom
Hang 'em high on gallow's pole
Slayer's blade will take your soul
