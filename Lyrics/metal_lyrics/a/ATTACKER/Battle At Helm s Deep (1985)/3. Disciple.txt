Down, down in the valleys below
Children stare, but they don't know
Magic sparks fill the air
A maiden of beauty oh so fair
Oh oh so fair
Oh she's oh so fair
Oh oh so fair!

Bewildered you are
But do not fear
Bewildered you are
Peace will soon be here
Children once stared but now they know
The secrets that lie in valleys below
Disciple come forth
Eternal life is just up north
Oh it's just up north
Oh, oh up north
Oh it's just up north
