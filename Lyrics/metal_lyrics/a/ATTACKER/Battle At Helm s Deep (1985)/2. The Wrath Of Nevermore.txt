Behind the door, no one knows
Crimson liquid overflows
Witness the wrath of nevermore
Life is nearing the raging shore
Phantoms as white as the sheet i scribe
Haunting, taunting as they bribe
Red skies turning black
As the wrath reaches black

Tormenting battles within our hearts
Women and children walk through parts
A hopeful glow reaches my face
As the wrath is taking place

Faceless kinsmen look around
For they know not what they found
Darkness fills the raging shore
Witness the wrath of nevermore...
Once more!
