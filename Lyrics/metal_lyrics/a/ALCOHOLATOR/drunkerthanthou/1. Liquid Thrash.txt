[Lyrics by Matt &amp; Oli]

Drink, sink, there's no time to think
Liquid thrash is now time to bash
Forget your name and join in the game
A vicious party of violence and pain
Flowing crawling into your veins
Igniting signals into your brain

To crush to mosh 
this rush you maintain
To kill all in sight 
While violence flows through your veins

Liquid thrash
Smokin' hash
Liquid thrash
Need more cash

Drunk, sunk, spit blood from your lungs
Liquid thrash I smoked too much hash
Forgot my name, I'm not in the game
My head is spinning I'm fucking insane
Flowing, crawling into your veins
Destroying neurons into your brain

Too drunk to fuck
Your mind is in shock
Let's go to the pit
Thrashing in vomit

Liquid thrash
Smokin' hash
Liquid thrash
Need more cash
