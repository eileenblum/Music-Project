[originally by Exciter][Lyrics by Dan Beehler]

Goin' to the show
Pounding your fists to the air
Heads slamming, brains bashing
It's over the top you don't care
Headbanging rats rip this place
From the ceiling to the ground
Black night, metal fight
Tear it apart as we pound

Pounding metal, pounding metal
Pounding metal, pounding metal

Losing control, feeling the force
From the back to the stage
Caught in the spell
'Cause it's louder than hell
Gone past the pressures of pain
Leather 'n spikes strapped to the wrists
Of this metal brigade
Like pistons pumping
Headbangers pounding
The sound of an army in rage

Pounding metal, pounding metal
Pounding metal, pounding metal

Dark night intense fight
Bone crushing metal disease
Watts of power, wanting it louder
No one can stop us when we're pounding

[Lead: Oli]

Goin' to the show
Pounding your fists to the air
Heads slamming, brains bashing
It's over the top you don't care
Headbanging rats rip this place
From the ceiling to the ground
Black night, metal fight
Tear it apart as we pound

Pounding metal, pounding metal
Pounding metal, pounding metal
Pounding metal, pounding metal
Pounding metal, pounding metal
Pounding metal, pounding metal (rip it apart)
