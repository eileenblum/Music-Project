[Lyrics by Matt]

Catastrophic violence
You'll never live again
Bones reduced to ashes
Lives reduced to nothingness
The world raises its hand
Vengeance will turn upon thee
Catastrophic violence
We'll never turn the sand

Live by my hand
Swear by my hand
Die by my hand
Die with your land

Catastrophic violence
When sand turns to glass
Skies turn to red
Atomic violation brings the end
Nuclear winter arise
Water turns to gas
Hell freezes over
And the heavens meet their end

Live by my hand
Swear by my hand
Die by my hand
Die with your land
