[Lyrics Matt]

Crack the gate
Change your fate
Storm the gate
Break the hate

Raise your hand
Let's break through the wall
Take your stand
Let me stand tall
I demand please hear my call
Take my hand
To break the wall

Regret the past, the time
When there was no grime
Bright days and nights
Like two perfect worlds aligned

To gaze in haze
The sight of this barricade
To break this cage
I'm trapped and I suffocate

Crack the gate
Change your fate
Storm the gate
Break the chains

Raise your hand
Let's break through the wall
Take your stand
Let me stand tall
I demand please hear my call
Take my hand
To break the wall

Break the wall

[Lead: Oli]
