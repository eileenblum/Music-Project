[Lyrics Matt and Oli]

Can't sleep, lust fills your head
Diseased, can't leave your bed
Depressed, can't see ahead
Fantasies, I must be fed
Your mind reached a dead end
Afraid to raise your hand
Conflict you can't pretend
In murder there is no end

Abduction
Taken by force
Torment
Awaken your nightmares
Sufferance
Wish you were dead
Blood on my hands

Abduction
Taken by force
Torment
Awaken your nightmares
Sufferance
Wish you were dead
Looking down your useless corpse

Contempt, joy fills my head
Finally, you have been shred
Visions of your bloodshed
Your flesh I have been fed
Memories of severed heads
Blood, I still see red
Conflict, you can't pretend
In murder there is no end

Abduction
Taken by force
Torment
Awaken your nightmares
Sufferance
Wish you were dead
Blood on my hands

Abduction
Taken by force
Torment
Awaken your nightmares
Sufferance
Wish you were dead
Looking down your useless corpse
