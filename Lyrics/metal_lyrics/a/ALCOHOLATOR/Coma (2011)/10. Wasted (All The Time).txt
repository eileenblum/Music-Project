[Lyrics by Matt]

My mouth reeks of vomit
I'm gonna throw a fit
I feel like I drank poison
Holy shit I was gone
I get out of bed
Totally brain-dead
I can't feel my hands
Maybe it's the end

Wasting your time
It's not a waste of time
It's not a waste of time
You're just wasted all the time

I take out the whiskey
Not to pay the fee
I light up a blunt
To forget her cunt
I get back in the zone
Hell it feels like home
I can't remember my name
Am I going insane?

Wasting your time
It's not a waste of time
It's not a waste of time
You're just wasted all the time
