[Lyrics by Matt]

[Lead: Oli]

Intravenous sentence
No destiny no past
Perpetual grievance of your past
Future bypassed
You're drowning near
Low below the ground you found
You're inside out

Take me down to the morgue
Put me down like a dog
Breathe in the deathly smog
Twists your body into forms

Soviet reign, corrupted games
Testing methods of killing with no shame

[Lead 1: Oli]
[Lead 2: Matt]

Take me down to the morgue
Put me down like a dog
Breathe in the deathly smog
Twists your body into forms
