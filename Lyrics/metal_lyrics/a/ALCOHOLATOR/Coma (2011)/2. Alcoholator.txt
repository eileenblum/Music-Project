[Lyrics by Alcoholator]

Violence is better, nothing's worse
Fucking hypocrite I'm in for attack
Crush your bones, we won't be alone
Idiotic clown you should have known

Inside our heads, you're fucking dead
This place you stand is your deathbed
Make this time the last time you've bled
You shouldn't have touched my head

Alcoholator, nothing's better
Alcoholator, it's a fucking blur
Alcoholator, nothing's better
Alcoholator, it's a fucking blur

Got yourself to blame
We're not gonna bail
On a daily basis
We bash with our fists

Alcoholator, nothing's better
Alcoholator, it's a fucking blur
Alcoholator, nothing's better
Alcoholator, it's a fucking blur

Shotgun
