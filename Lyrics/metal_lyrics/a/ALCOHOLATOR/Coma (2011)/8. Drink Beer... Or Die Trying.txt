[Lyrics by Oli]

7 PM: we drink the first beer of the night
Shooting alcohol through our veins
Awaiting the moment to fight
'Cause we'll never feel the pain
Alcohol's by our side
Sobriety disappears
There's only one thing on our minds
Give me a damn fucking beer

Drink... beer...
...Or die trying

2 AM: fuck there's no more brews
So what will I fucking do?
We must go to the bar
But dammit it's fucking far
My buddy's got a car
So let's go to the bar
I wake up I see my friends
Fuck, they're all dead!!!!!

[Lead: Oli]

Drink... beer...
...Or die trying
