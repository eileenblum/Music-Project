Alcohol is your poison
Violence is your game
The battlefield your playground
You go through war in pain
Tension setting in
Hear the demons calling
Start to drink your ammunition
Instant satisfaction

Molotov cocktail
Taking you higher and higher
Molotov cocktail
Lights up your mind on fire
Molotov cocktail
Quenching your deepest desires
Molotov cocktail
Now you are casting the reaper

Now you're losing reason
But did you ever have any
No one comes to help you
Useless for your company
Going under friendly fire
Can you feel the sting
Drank all your ammunition
Now you're rotting

Molotov cocktail
Taking you higher and higher
Molotov cocktail
Lights up your mind on fire
Molotov cocktail
Quenching your deepest desires
Molotov cocktail
Now you are casting the reaper
