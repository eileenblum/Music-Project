Lay on the table close your eyes
Let your mind slip
Total comfort, just what you deserve
Nothing money can't serve

First world problems dispose of them
With a scalpel in your face
There's no need to be afraid
You'll receive what  you claimed

Burning the faces of the rich
Melting down the masks vanish
Showing them reality
Through pain and misery

Trade your fame for infamy
Plastic surgery
You could have killed yourself for free
Plastic surgery

No you wake up from your sleep
This is no dream
Look in the mirror feel the horror
Don't you look lean

Burning the faces of the rich
Melting down the masks vanish
Showing them reality
Through pain and misery

Trade your fame for infamy
Plastic surgery
You could have killed yourself for free
Plastic surgery
