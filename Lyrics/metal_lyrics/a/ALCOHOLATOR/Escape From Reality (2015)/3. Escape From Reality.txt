Live the life that people have wanted from you
Nothing that you ever have wanted to do
You socialized and compromised with the clowns in the crew
Now the joke that is your life is laughing at you

Escape from reality
Escape from reality

Your leaders are only there to finish first
No reality in any of their words
You fuck your life up fuck your brains up
You're dying you burn

To crush their heads up with no heads-up
And kick them to hell

Reality a fantasy a rule which we must fight
Society the enemy break all the guiding lines
Open your mind you'll come to find the pleasures of the vice
The only rule is to survive and escape this lie

Escape from reality
Escape from reality
Escape from reality
Escape from reality

The world has fell
Run to hell

Run to hell
The world has fell

Escape, escape
Escape, escape
From reality
