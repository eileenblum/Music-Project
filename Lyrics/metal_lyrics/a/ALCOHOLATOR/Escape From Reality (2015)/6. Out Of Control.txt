Spinning out of control
Standing alone
Outside this bar I can never go home
Blood's running cold
Too drunk to behold
I should be puking my guts on the floor

PUKING MY GUTS ON THE FLOOR

In my head all hell breaks loose
I'd pound some more brews
Even a moose looks more human than you

Can't find your booze
You're way too confused
What's your excuse for such crazy abuse

No time to lose
Got no excuse
No need to seduce a bottle of Grey Goose

Drunk to the core
Thirsty for more
Until you puke all your guts on the floor

PUKING YOUR GUTS ON THE FLOOR
