Living in a world of liars
Lying like a true blue bastard
Fighting for the wrong desires

Destined to a world of anger
Disgress for a different temper
Leaving your real nature

I'm cursed by my thirst
I'm driving my hearse

Listen to my song of fire
Burning for a real answer
Never to turn into cancer

Standing tall in front of lancers
Obeying a cruel master
Heading to a true disaster

Destined to a world of anger
Disgress for a different temper
Leaving your real nature

Shouting out my song of fire
Piercing through hell's laughter
Don't want to meet my own maker

I'm cursed by my thirst
I'm driving my hearse

This has been a whole disarray
My whole life feels like it's astray
Is this really what I purvey
It all feels like it's foul play

I am one that goes all the way
I have let myself slip away
A passion to bring decay
My whole life to throw away
