Born under the stars
My father was a king
The eternal leader
We were born to reign

Witnessing insanity
Deprived of liberty
Forced to thinktheir way
And do just as they say

Leaving the minds to decay
Free thinkers are the plague
Destroy the truths of yesterday
Create new lies today

Being the shepherd is a simple task
When your people are looking up to you
You'll torture and rape them and gouge out their eyes
So they won't ever look down on you

Cities are starving
Do you think I care
I only feed on greed
I've got none to spare

Leaving the minds to decay
Free thinkers are the plague
Destroy the truths of yesterday
Create new lies today

Being the shepherd is a simple task
When your people are looking up to you
You'll torture and rape them and gouge out their eyes
So they won't ever look down on you
