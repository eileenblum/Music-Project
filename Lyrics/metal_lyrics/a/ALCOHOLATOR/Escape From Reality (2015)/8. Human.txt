Human nature
The world's in danger
An insane stature
You shouldn't wager

Put on the jacket
Attach the bomb
Detach your mind
Tick off the bomb
Think of your god
Lay out the blood
Stripped to the core for virgin whores
Your sacrifice will satisfy
The appetite of your allies
Now you are dead
No tears be shed
Your sick attack we will fight back

Humanity gone off the track
Have we even meditated the facts
Why is it that we never react
Hatred, bloodshed, never dead

From all around we are attacked
Bonded by blood, we made a pact
Our self destruction is left intact
Kill yourself there's no time turning back
