Lust
The pleasures of the flesh I'm living for
Gluttony
My appetite is infinite for blood
Greed
I'm way too poor to give you any more
Sin
Take 'em all and shove 'em up your ass

Bleed for our sins
Merciless
Pray for death

Rise
Rise from the dead
Are you there to save us all from you
Save, those you have led
Those who throw the most coins at your faith
Convert, convert the facts
Brainwash the believers at any price
Hell, hunting your prey
You shall pray or else you'll pay

Die
Die in vain
We'll keep sinning
Who's winning?

BLEEDER
MASTER
LIAR BASTARD
