Walking in the night
Wanting to get wild
Come out for a ride
I'll show you all that's right

Let me get inside you
You know you want it too
Come on let it loose

I'll fuck your skull

I won't make you cry
I won't tell you lies
Now I know you're mine
And I will cross the line

Two holes ain't enough
I know you like it rough
You've got more in your head
So lay down on my bed
