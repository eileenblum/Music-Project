You can't always see the inside of me
You can't see what I must hide
When you look I turn my head and run
I'm in fear for my life

I can see you everywhere I go
Why can't you just go away?

When it's midnight and I lie there awake
In the darkness of my room
I feel your glaring eyes staring at me
I just want to be left alone

If I close my eyes
Will you soon be gone
I feel I'm going insane

Nowhere to run
Now there's no escaping
Nowhere to run
I am a prisoner
Nowhere to run
It's like insanity
Nowhere to run
I can see you in the shadowed night
Nowhere to run

I can see you everywhere I go
Why can't you just go away?

Nowhere to run
Now there's no escaping
Nowhere to run
I am a prisoner
Nowhere to run
It's like insanity
Nowhere to run
I can see you in the shadowed night
Nowhere to run

As the sun begins to rise in the sky
And the night is nearly through
Now my nightmare turns into reality
I turn around and it's you

My head it aches
What the hell is going on
I feel I'm going insane

Nowhere to run
Now there's no escaping
Nowhere to run
I am a prisoner
Nowhere to run
It's like insanity
Nowhere to run
I can see you in the shadowed night
Nowhere to run
