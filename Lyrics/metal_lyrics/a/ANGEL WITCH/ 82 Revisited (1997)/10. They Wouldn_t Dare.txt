What would happen if we all died tomorrow?
No one here to drown their tears and sorrow
Just remains of atomic warfare
No one cares, no they wouldn't dare

There's only shelter for the select few
No one else stands a chance
Till it's too late and it's on the news
No they wouldn't, wouldn't dare

They wouldn't dare
Who can really say
Wipe out the world in just on day
They wouldn't dare

The ones in power cause so much destruction
Destroy the world with one push of the button
It's okay when you don't have to suffer
I suppose to them it doesn't even matter

What use is the world when only buildings stand
Once people lived on earth
But they who live an eternal grave
Stay below, they will never be saved

They wouldn't dare
Who can really say
Wipe out the world in just on day
They wouldn't, wouldn't

They wouldn't dare
Who can really, really say
Wipe out the world in just on day
They wouldn't, wouldn't dare
