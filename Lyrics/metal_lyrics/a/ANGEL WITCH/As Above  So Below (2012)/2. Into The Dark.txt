It's a stellar vibration encirceling us
Turning our brains into dust
Cosmic rays of the pagans's fate
And the heathens travel beyond the void

Relative power indulges through the universe
Genocide to the ozone layer
The aliens from the stratosphere's curse
Blows our minds to an evil prayer

The black hole makes its mark
Sucks us down into the dark

Is there another of the force of life?
Through the hole we could escape
Into all, while we travel as life
To understand what we might find

Into the dark
