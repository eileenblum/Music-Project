The executioner stands with his machine
They want to see him slice without difficulty
Oh isn't it all he can retain?
Do you think that your death is a dream?

Guillotine
Guillotine
Guillotine
Guillotine

Can't understand what I've done
There's nowhere I can run
In god's name and his son
Has the revolution won?

Your life flashes past your altered view
When you die, doesn't mean everything starts new
Is this the cold-blooded death you think you deserve?
To the people all your life you tried do serve
