It's the witching hour and I seek your evil shell
But maybe I won't have the time to tell
I look from where your name that holds the key
To your immortality

I have crossed the black smell
The stench of rotting flesh

I just stand there
Feeling shame
At the thought of what I have to do
I should have known
I should have seen
The marks upon my neck
Were there for real

I can't believe you're standing there
Looking into my eyes
Telling me that we can now be one

Don't you know
You can't destroy us
When we're in the witchig hour

It's - it's in the dawn
Under the spell of the deadly swarm
And they're lusting for my heart
I'm awake and they're all surrounding me
It is time to tell
I now walk with them
I have never felt so clear
Of how I feel of what I have become
Now I feel reality
Out of the black a new life has begun
