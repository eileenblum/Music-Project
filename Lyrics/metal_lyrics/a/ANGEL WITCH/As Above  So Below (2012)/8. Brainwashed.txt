Maybe the story's true for believers
A victim's story of deception
A god alone, and we start with soldiers, a simple man
A lie to be made for the power of control

To scare them for the guilt
Wash yourself, start with their blood
To wear the symbol to what made the pain
To what made the death

Look into your own eyes
Your reflection shows you' re brainwashed
Restrain yourself inside
Stop yourself from being brainwashed

Conditioned
Conditioned for what?
Conditioned, manipulation, kept so far from the truth
Not for you to chose
