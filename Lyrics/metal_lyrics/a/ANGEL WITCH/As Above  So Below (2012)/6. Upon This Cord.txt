So I'm here, I'm here for you
Not a second thought for how I feel
In a conscious hell inside here
For I walked in a human being

I walked still within your lie
You won't hear my cries
I won't exist, I will not be
I will twist myself around this cord

I can't hear and feel out there
And I know it would be more than I could bare
So nutritient, you survive to keep me alive
I will release you of this burden

I walked still within your lie
You won't hear my cries
I won't exist, I will not be
I will twist myself around this cord
