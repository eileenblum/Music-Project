It's getting dark as a sea
Your unblessed body 
I walk past your grave see the stone has been disturbed
I look for a way that holds the key to your immortality
I approach the flats now the stench of the rotting flesh

First to the touch I start to shake at the thought of what I have to do
I should have known and I should have seen
The monster that I lived for then and just can't believe
That it's not really her, it's only a body uncontrolled without a soul

It's getting dark
I'm gonna smell at the Devil's spawn
and the last in the last in the last in the fall night blood
Then I awake and they are surrounding me
As they start to tell I become one of them

First to the touch I start to shake at the thought of what I've become
I should have known and I should have seen
The monster that I lived for then and just can't believe
That it's not really me, it's only my body uncontrolled without a soul

They waltz the night
They waltz the night
They waltz the night
They waltz the night

First to the touch I start to shake at the thought of what I have to do
I should have known and I should have seen
The monster that I lived for then and just can't believe
That it's not really her, it's only a body uncontrolled without a soul

They waltz the night
They waltz the night
They waltz the night
They waltz the night
