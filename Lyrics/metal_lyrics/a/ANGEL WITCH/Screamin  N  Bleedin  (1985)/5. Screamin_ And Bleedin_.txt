If the rain won't come
If the sun won't shine
If the sky turns black and there's no day or night
If the God's repent with their raging wrath and they're here

They're involved with anger and no shame of fight
They'll cut through your soul at the speed of light
You'll be liying in pain saying you're feeling the light

Please don't leave me behind
I have no fate in this massacre of hate
Come take me away from this hell and decay
Don't leave me this way
They won't take you down, they will just leave you
Screamin' and bleedin'

The sky is on fire and the lightening blinds
Hear the waling laughter drwoned by church bells chime
There's bodies writhing in twisted heaps on the ground
And they'll burn his body the unholy flock
See the devil burning, smiling with his flock

Please don't leave me behind
I have no fate in this massacre of hate
Come take me away from this hell and decay
Don't leave me this way
They won't take you down, they will just leave you
Screamin' and bleedin'

If the rain won't come
If the sun won't shine
If the sky turns black and there's no day or night
If the God's repent with their raging wrath and they're here

Please don't leave me behind
I have no fate in this massacre of hate
Come take me away from this hell and decay
Don't leave me this way
They won't take you down, they will just leave you
Screamin' and bleedin'
