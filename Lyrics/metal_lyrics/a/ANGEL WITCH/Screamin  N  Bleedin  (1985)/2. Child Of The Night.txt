Within this world of darkness who will hear us scream?
You would think that someone out there is in pain or tears
You go out to help someone distressed or trapped
But the trap for you my friend for you its cast

At first she looks unharmful
Plaintive offensive 
Till she turns around and then you see her face

We will twist your tongues you will curse with hate
Looking through you with whites of eyes and bleeding red
She licks her finger and waves it and to to and ties you close
And in the nick of time she backs away

She looks so absurd standing there just shaking
And she decides to run away from you

At first she looks unharmful
Plaintive offensive 
Till she turns around and then you see her face

Within the shrouded darkness, you will hear her scream
You will think someone out there is in pain or tears
You go out to help someone distressed or trapped
But the trap for you my friend for you its cast

At first she looks unharmful
Plaintive offensive 
Till she turns around and then you see her face

Child of the night
