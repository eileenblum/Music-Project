here i wait, within this timeless place. 
here against, my will. 
my nightmares all become reality,
in my own fear of, the dark. 
how can i live or escape,
your ill perpetual fear.
when my lifes in wondrous of the man.
im held here in hell and fire
its got souls and evil minds.
i just havnt got a chance in hell. 

what will become of me, my destiny?
will i live or, be saved?
if only i could die, i'd free my soul. 

how can i live or escape,
your ill perpetual fear.
when my lifes in wondrous of the man.
im held here in hell and fire
its got souls and evil minds.
i just havnt got a chance in hell. 

can ya hear me, in the dark nights ?
can ya help me, to get away?
can ya help you, when im screaming,
in my own fear, of the dark. 

can ya hear me, in the dark nights?
can ya help me, to get away?
and i help you, when im screamin,
in my own fear, of the dark. 

here i wait, within this timeless place. 
here against, my will. 
my nightmares all turned to reality,
in my own fear of, the dark. 

can ya hear me, in the dark nights?
and ya help you, to get away.
and i help you, when im screamin,
in my own fear, of the dark.

in my own fear of the dark.
