They laugh and shout for eveyone to see
When they are together they are happy
Little children with innocent smiles
Who knows what may hide behind them
The sadness in the eyes of old folk around them
The childrenâs spiteful games
They donât know youâre hurting
Stop and look around you
For Godâs sake, look about you
Evil games, evil games
They tie you up, they tear your heart in two
One day they love, the next they hate you
When youâre not looking theyâll be out at night
To wander streets investigating
The sadness in the eyes of old folk around them
The childrenâs spiteful games
They donât know youâre hurting
Stop and look around you
For Godâs sake, look about you
Evil games, evil games
The sadness in the eyes of old folk around them
The childrenâs spiteful games
They donât know youâre hurting
Stop and look around you
For Godâs sake, look about you
Evil games, evil games
Evil games, evil games
Evil games, evil games
Evil games, evil games
Evil games, evil games
Evil games, evil games
