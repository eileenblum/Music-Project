Masters of Queens to all mankind
And souls with superstitious minds
Never passing knowledge 
Here the ghost that sent us maybe 
Hear the answers written by the dead
Leads us to a place we all dread

No no never turn your back on traitors
No no never turn your back on a friend
Evil lies lurking leaving you alone and in danger
Waiting in shadows just to steal a soul away

With lips of fire and daggered breath
She holds the key to her disguise,
You pull her close, to steal a kiss
It's all so hard to realize she has you in her tangled web
And dozens have to be for long

No no never turn your back on traitors
No no never turn your back on a friend
Evil lies lurking leaving you alone and in danger
Waiting in shadows just to steal a soul away

Fatal kiss ohh that fatal kiss
Fatal kiss

No no never turn your back on traitors
No no never turn your back on a friend
Evil lies lurking leaving you alone and in danger
Waiting in shadows just to steal a soul away
