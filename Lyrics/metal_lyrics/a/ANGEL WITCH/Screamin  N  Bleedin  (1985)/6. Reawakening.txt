And so the witness stands wiping the sweat from his brow
Waiting for morning to embrace
The silence deafens him as moments pass like hours
His eyes gaze into the firelight

At the time, everything seemed to be going fine
But as he looked beyond he saw into her eyes
She has you now, desire takes over fright
There's nothing to stop her lust for blood
To and all time

Now he must take a stand 
Look at the realms of darkness to see what the judgment holds
Although his thought s escape him, he invites the stench of evil
Now she's gotta grip the one eyed foe

At the time, everything seemed to be going fine
But as he looked beyond he saw into her eyes
She has you now, desire takes over fright
There's nothing to stop her lust for blood
To and all time

Don't run, can't hide your fear
Can't move can' fight can't scream
You are the first to see
The reawakening

Why in the hell did he go
Why did he follow his dreams
Obsessions took over his mind
Now he has to live with his find

Don't run, can't hide your fear
Can't move can' fight can't scream
You are the first to see
The reawakening

And so the witness stands wiping the sweat from his brow
Waiting for morning to embrace
The silence deafens him as moments pass like hours
His eyes gaze into the firelight

At the time, everything seemed to be going fine
But as he looked beyond he saw into her eyes
She has you now, desire takes over fright
There's nothing to stop her lust for blood
To and all time

Don't run, can't hide your fear
Can't move can' fight can't scream
You are the first to see
The reawakening
