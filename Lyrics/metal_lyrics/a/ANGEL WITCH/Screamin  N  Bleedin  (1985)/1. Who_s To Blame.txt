When night betrays the day and when evil has its way
Who can say they never turned their heads away
You hear screaming in the night and your hand feels for the light
You thank God you're safe and not the prey

But how can you defend yourself when you don't face the foe?
All you do is hang your head in shame
How can you defend yourself when you're too scared to fight?
Looking for someone else to blame
Whose to blame for the shame

We all want to be free but none of us could see
We are all prisoners and we all forged the chains
From the cradle to the grave
We all like to think we're brave
But we're all cowards too scared to take the blame

But how can you defend yourself when you don't face the foe?
All you do is hang your head in shame
How can you defend yourself when you're too scared to fight?
Looking for someone else to blame
Whose to blame for the pain

Someone's fightin' in the street
We made a hasty retreat
Saying it's got nothing to do with me
Put yourself in his place
You got blood on your face
A helping hand and the night is watching

But how can you defend yourself when you don't face the foe?
All you do is hang your head in shame
How can you defend yourself when you're too scared to fight?
Looking for someone else to blame
Oh, the shame
