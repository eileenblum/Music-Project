Suffer suffer suffer suffer

You cannot see the reason for your feeling
We've heard it all before
You have to love to overcome the hurting
Fate will take its course
Suffer what is this game you're playin'
Suffer sure to understand
Suffer what is it you're sayin' suffer

What do you want to learn those who've hurt you
Can't you see it isn't fair
You know the world everyone's too smoothly
You're just another in despair
Suffer what is this game you're playin'
Suffer sure to understand
Suffer what is it you're sayin'
Suffer you have to make a stand

Suffer what is this game you're playin'
Suffer sure to understand
Suffer what is it you're sayin'
Suffer you have to make a stand
Suffer what is this game you're playin'
Suffer sure to understand
Suffer what is it you're sayin'
Suffer you have to make a stand
