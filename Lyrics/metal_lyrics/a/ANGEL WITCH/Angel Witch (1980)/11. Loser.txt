Why can't you understand
We're not out to get you
You say we're cheating,oh but
No one believes you
You fake it to believe yourself
You tell the tale of how I cheat
So well

Loser
Why can't you just accept the facts?
Loser
You only make yourself seem bad

I try to calm you down,
Trying to protect you
But who can help the man
Who will not see the evil?
You try to blame everyone else
You will not see you brought it all
On yourself

Loser
Why can't you just accept the facts?
Loser
You only make yourself seem bad

You try to blame everyone else
You tell the tale of how I cheat
So well

Loser
Why can't you just accept the facts?
Loser
You only make yourself seem bad
