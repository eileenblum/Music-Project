The book of god bleeding on the world of holy truth
Look you die for him religion's enemy
Dusk of age enthroned traitir on the ross
Crown of thorns damned killing human race

Universe will rise in violence
Then we'll see the ancient one
In the eye of the seventh day
On the rock of eternal sea

Kill again demon of light
Kill again Satan
