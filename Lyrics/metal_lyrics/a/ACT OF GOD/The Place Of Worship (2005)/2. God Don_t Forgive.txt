Deep in darkness exists the place
Reserved for men by lord
No time, no motion, no hope
No death only eternal pain

God why do you hate us
We must suffer but why
At the face of heavens basher
Loving father - who are you in reality?

No reason in death
In waiting for mass cremations
God don't forgive
It is written on the walls of hell
I see the angels
I feel their inspiration to kill
