Thursty murder is befitted to god
The creator of universe has the right to kill all
Trample the mankind as worms
Oh I feel this spiritual need

Soe people see loving father in him
Non suspecting what lives in hell
Someone can say I believe only in myself
I cannot say who o them is worse

The act of god they will die
Crushed damned unforgiven

We are created for carnage
Paradise blooms when we die
If he has killed his only son
Why do you think he loves you?
