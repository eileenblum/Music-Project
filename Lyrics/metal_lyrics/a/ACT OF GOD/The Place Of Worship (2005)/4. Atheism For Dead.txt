Father you stand in the ancient gates
Ready to make great flight
Hell is in the roaring abyss
Somewhere behind it
There's a new world
Soon it will belong only to you
Falling to rise is to be written
Blessed in blasphemy
For the truth is in it
Bible will burn in the hands of traitors
Behind the limit of self-preservation
Hear revelations accept
The creator or die
But for someone it's too late
Regretting that the man was born
Look at the dead man at the world extinct
Conscious essence of your savior
Vomit on atheism
At the gates of being
Of eternal suffering
