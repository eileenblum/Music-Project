The careless herd
Prepare to death
Evil was settled in my soul
The beast was settled
He requires the blood
And pain and suffering

I am a stinger infernal hive
The destroyer of life
The wave of the dark ocean
The creed justice promised by devotion

Curse you in your weaknesses
My hate shocks cattle
Destroying everything on its way
Filling heaven with the ash of the battle

My evil is my place in this world
Weak must be destroyed
Contagious die in disgrace
Slave will serve
