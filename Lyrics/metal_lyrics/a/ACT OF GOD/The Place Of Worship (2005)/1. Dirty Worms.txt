Black slime has covered the planet
The parasite on it
He guzzles and destroys
And it's name is the Man

He plagues on the Earth
A thorn in flesh dirty worms
They don't have laws
The people the fucked mob

They have no allies only foes
They despise power of nature
Hold sacred only the dead god
The specimen of hypocrisy and lie
Greedy bastards - defective race
Ideas are poor, desires are stupid
Miserable people, the mankind soon will
Gobble up itself from the inside
