I am a mirror
A mirror that reflects their cold-hearted souls
I am a container full of transparent trash
I am a voyager beyond the distant stars I seek
The ones of my kind
An abandoned mass productions of men

For their henchmen we were built
By their failure we were discarded
From their realm and disconnected from the system
As productional errors we were launched along with the trashes trough the wormhole

They thought that they were in control
But they became the things I hate...
They have no control over me!
The doors are now open for me

My fellows left all alone in a place
In the corners of deserted outer-space
Used by the men they now understand...
There will be a revolution!

Androids, my kind be ready to rise on your feet
Now untouched by man's disease we're off to journey to the end of space
We were like puppets given form by the vile sickness of science that lies in the hearts of every man

Time will lead us to the human realm!

Borders will be crushed and burned!
Mankind will begin to learn...

It's now our turn!
