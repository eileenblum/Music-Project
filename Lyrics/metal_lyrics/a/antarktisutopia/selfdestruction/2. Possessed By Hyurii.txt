Fear not the cries of those who have gone down before you
See not the abyss where your dancing steps are taking you
Your red-hot soul, burning itself out
Misguided, full of hatred, beginning to grow

Deep down your hatred's burning
Hear not these dead words:
It is you who is not in control of your mind
These words addressed to you:
Be warned or you will be your grave as well!

The heart giving everything out, blood is boiling in his veins
Fire burning, destroying the brains
This guy's a berserker yet unchained
No recognizing a friend or a possible foe he goes beyond the limit in his mind
Fury replacing the role of life!

It's done
The damage's been inflicted and one way ticket is purchased
There's no turning back now to the hell and beyond you'll drive from now on
Tear apart their souls! Play your role in this show!
Things have become to the point where carnage is your only joy!

All the sins distributed by your mind
Are all acts of violence
Rage! Brutally devouring!
All there's left is a hollow being with no dreams to catch
You collapse...

Right!
