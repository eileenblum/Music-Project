Like a fire from the sky,
We hear that prophecy
But Blind and Deaf,
Like the average human

For thousands years,
We've been waiting
For millions souls,
We are coming

Here We Come
Gifts From Hell
No Asking Why
Here We Are

That black lighting,
Shining for the blind ones
That Signals you ignored,
Will take you on you knees
