When you are drowning,
Without chance for survive
Forgetting view of light,
As clear as your own heart

Maybe tomorrow will come,
But without rage and hate,
Its like a bloodlust
No body can't stop us

Breathe, for first time
Taste of our power
And let your fury FLOW,
To all world sides

Just sound and light,
That never dies
Remember that desperate scream,
Imagine what you should be
