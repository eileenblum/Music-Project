Now, my eyes are yours
So tell me what you see

So show me that void
Now are you voiceless?

Now, you have a chance,
To breath the same air,
That i have to breath,
Every Single day

No, that is not a nightmare
Awakening is not a way out

I Want you to feel
What i feel every single day!
