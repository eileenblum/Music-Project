Like a, water in the river
So fast and deathly
I can feel it, clearly
My time is near the end

Tick tock runs fine clock
It's time to say goodbye
Lost in deepest fog
Without trace back

Through my veins,
From the sky like acid rain
That bitter taste,
I want to smash my brain

Trapped in swamps,
Eaten and swallowed alive
For the last time i scream
From the sky like acid rain
