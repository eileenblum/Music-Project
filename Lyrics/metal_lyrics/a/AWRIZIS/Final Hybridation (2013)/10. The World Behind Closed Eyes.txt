But gardens of heaven,
Are closed for You
Castle of dreams,
Is burning right now

Over the mountains of madness
Above the sleeping sky
Where creatures are fearless
Behind my Blind Eyes

Outer space inside my head
Living cosmos within my veins
That all is behind that wall
Behind my eyelids

The Story that never ends,
I'm living That dream is becoming
Real

---Without light in this hole---.
Just few seconds to breath,
Again
I cannot face this holy,
True

Behind the veil of light
Across the wall of noise
Far Away from ignorance
Between of colliding worlds
