I can't stay here anymore
Can you feel it with me?
Just violence and gore

That stuff make me bleed!
Look across the street,
People lost their souls,
Trying to find what they need,
It's too late, we are lost

Follow your inner compas,
Where cold winters are

Don't look back, just follow us!
Cause our home, the north is far!

We believe for so long,
All hope is gone now,
Carrying new flag
And going out of here!

All for one and one for all,
That rule no one knows,

Selfishness is only rule,
That everybody knows!
