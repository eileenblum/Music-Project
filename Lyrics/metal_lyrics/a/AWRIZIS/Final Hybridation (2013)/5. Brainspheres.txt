Flash before my eyes
Showing me the past
There is no way to
Erase the truth of mine

No body can't feel the same,
That feeling when the past
Is stronger than future
And present do not exist

Waves of the ocean,
Can't wash this Pain
For thousand years,

I remember all of this
Everything is written,
In my Brainspheres!

They are waiting
Inside my skull
They are watching

Me within
My reactions
