No body will believe
My worlds of the ending
Descending of human being
Doom of this soul

You always wanted to,
Reach the stars
But you way up,
Was your journey down

I saw your fall
That moment of time
Before you make
Last step to grave
I saw your fall
That moment of time
Before you make,
Last step to Hell

But gardens of heaven,
Are closed for You
Castle of dreams,
Is burning right now
