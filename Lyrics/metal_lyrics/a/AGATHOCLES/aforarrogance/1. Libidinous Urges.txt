I'm the one - you fear the most
I'm your dreams - your silent host
Look inside - what do you see?

I'm the entity - that rules your mind
I'm the system - that tells you lies

I'm the truth - from which you run
No way out - can't be undone
Reality - has come to call

I want, I need - a sexual greed
The again I seek - hate kills the weak
I'm so selfish - my needs are great
You give, I take - do you believe in fate?

A sexual lust - a greedy kill
Religious trust - a beautiful thrill
Libidinous urges - time after time again
We try so hard - but we always fail
