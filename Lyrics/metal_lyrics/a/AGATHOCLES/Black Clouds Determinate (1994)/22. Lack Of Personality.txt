An image - is what - you try to keep
You follow - the trends - society has breed
You're scared - of showing - the "real" you
Because - inside - you're a fool too

Just jump on the bandwagon
Listen to the stuff that's in
Go and meet your fashion friends
Then drop dead while you trendy dance

You might possess everything
Nice cut hair means girls to win
But there's one thing you can't see
Your lack of personality

Are you that important?
I guess that is what you want
Living just to show off
But beneath your mask... ??
