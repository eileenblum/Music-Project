What do you care?
Putting others in fear,
Enslaved by your disgrace,
But that's not my case.
Megalomanic-pretentious thoughts
Fill your head-personality sold
Megalomanic-pretencious thoughts
Make you think-you are a god
But let's face reality,
You're a slave of your stupidity,
But let's face reality,
You're a product of naivity?
A deformed mind,
Is what you are,
Conditioned by,
Sick system you support.
