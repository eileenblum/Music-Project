Considering life is just a play
Where we all are the actors
Where there's no individual equality
Just the abused and the abusers

A division of these actors
They always seem to win
While the others in this theater
Are doomed to commit sins

Take up the role of your position
Face up to your situation
Is it right or is it wrong?
Or just a result of euphorism?

Wearing a mask - for deception
Mixed emotions - detrunciation
Is this just a play - or reality?
How can I know - you are reliable?

Two divisions
Like a contradiction
Facing eachother
Leads to confrontation

My inner tention
Your invention?
Enslaved by dischord
And your behaviour
