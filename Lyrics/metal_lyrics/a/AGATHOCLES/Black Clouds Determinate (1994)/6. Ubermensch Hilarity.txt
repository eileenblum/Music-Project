You are so fucking sick,
Just another nazi-dick,
Thinking you are the best,
Way better than the rest,
With your dominant macho-pride,
You make your frustrations hide,
Egocentric views and thoughts,
With silly lies you can be bought,
Making the weak kneel for you,
Being the master is your rule,
But we'll make you kneel for us,
By hammering you on your swastikas.
