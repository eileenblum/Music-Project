You watch the horrors on the screen,
Still you refuse to fucking see,
Famine strikes the third world child
While eating burger, you don't,
The soja needed to save its life,
Was fed to the cattle, your burger right?
Still support this crudity,
By buying triple murder meat.

Famine strikes the third world child
While eating burger, you don't,
The soja needed to save its life,
Was fed to the cattle, your burger right?
Hormons used-an economical must?
The cow will die-by the butchers knife
Served for dinner-a sick minded manner
I hope the chemical-will infect you all
Holding on to traditions,
Makes you the slaves, makes you the conditioned.
