Years, years I searched for this
Found the right one? No I didn't
Hypocrisy is all what remains
Shall I be happier if I cut my veins?

Are you my well of happiness?

Here I sit again, cry
Wondering what's the point of my life
Are you the one I was searching for?
Or another deception which I can't take no more

Are you my well of happiness or not?
