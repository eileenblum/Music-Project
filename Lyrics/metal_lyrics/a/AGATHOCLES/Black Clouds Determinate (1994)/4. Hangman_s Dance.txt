This is a new dance,
Put a rope in your hands,
Get on a chair,
And put the thing around your neck.
Then jump around,
You won't feel down,
When you'll awake,
You'll realize life's just fake.
Your violet-blue body,
Swings on the rope around,
It was your last chance,
To do the hangman's dance.
Feel the grip-before you're stiff
Graveyard client-beloved ones crying
Feel the grip-before you're stiff
You wish you were dead-just go ahead
Get rope and chair-'cause I'll teach you the dance
