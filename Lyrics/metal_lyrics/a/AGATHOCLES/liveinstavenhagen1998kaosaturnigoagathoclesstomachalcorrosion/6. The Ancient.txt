It was August '87
And the butchers were working
In the bloody slaughterhouse
They killed so many animals
To satisfy your lusts
Some vegans want revenge
I think we know so
Well, what do you think of this?
The wife of the butcher
She suddenly pushed out
And this meant her death
'Cause she got impaled on a fishhook

The hook grinded her throat
And then it found its way
Through her mouth, to the brains
Oh god, she bled to death

Well ya vegans
Are you satisfied now?
Not that we are against you
'Cause we are vegetarians
But some of you vegans
Think they are more than us
That attitude sucks
Why do you ignore people
Who chose to eat meat
That's their choice
Some of them do care about animals
Doesn't that count anymore?
