tough macho hardcore clan, values gone, macho men
accepted by this so-called scene
but it's just and empty frame
trading creativity for safe conformity
expensive fucking tatoos, uniforms and shoes
nothing really matters, only the social ladder
climbing as high as they can, mister hardcore is back again
where has the social awareness gone?
it used to be fucking strong
it has been fucking killed, new school is dumb

not daring to speak out - scared of stepping on toes
but hardcore ain't about - a popularity pole
so act and react - and bring the spirit back
make hardcore a threat again - to the business mem
