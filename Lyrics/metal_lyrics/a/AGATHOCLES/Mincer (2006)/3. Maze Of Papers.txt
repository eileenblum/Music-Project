access to the social security system
is a right for every citizen
still many face problems to get in

administration kills

papers for this, papers for that
mountains of files, piles of crap
everyone's drowing in a paper-filled bath

administration kills

state is laughing because they don't have to pay
money from our taxes we have given away
they make it difficult to make use of our rights
they blind us with papes, our access denied
