they want to keep us working
until our last day
for social security is what the state's men say
but enough is enough
i will not work till death
fill the financial gap by the rich men's theft

it's easy for them to say to work
until our last day
when the state throws money away
while we fucking pay
sitting on their fay arse behind closed doors
they're making their fucking laws 
to opress the working class
