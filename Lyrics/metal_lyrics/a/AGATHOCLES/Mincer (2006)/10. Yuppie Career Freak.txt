crawling to the top
for my career i'll never stop
i just want more and more
wanna become chairman of the board

i don't care about you
for me you're just a tool

i don't have conscious mind
for friendship i am blind
i'm a yuppie career freak
fame and richness is what i seek

i don't care about you
for me you're just a tool

on the tope is my place to be
so i fuck over friends and family
