i don't need my fucking race
i don't judge by colour of face
people divided because of skin
this will only make the capitalists win

racial pride ain't worth a fight
save your anger and use it right

modern slavery doesn't know colour
only green, from the dollar
the only division is between rich and poor
and the first one are getting more and more

racial pride ain't worth a fight
save your anger and use it right

a black capitalist still is a fucking capitalist
a white homeless family remains
a family in poverty
so i don't need no race to face this cruel reality
end of the story: class-war necessity
