start your zine and start it now
start your label, you know why
set up gigs, underground wise
just do something, DIY

the scene has to be kept where it belongs
socially aware, active and strong
reject the worthless music business
deceiving, greedy, it ain't worth a piss

business men sucking you dry
promises, lies in disguise
for their profit, they will always smile
punch that face, business is vile
