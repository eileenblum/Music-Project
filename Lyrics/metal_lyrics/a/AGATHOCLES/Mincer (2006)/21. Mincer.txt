chop, chop, chop away
get the cancer away
which is infecting our earth
restricting us from birth

capitalism is a disease
on which the rich fucking feast
it should be cut away
into the mincer right away

sick kingdom of the rich
ain't life a fucking bitch
as long as we behave
we all will be enslaved
