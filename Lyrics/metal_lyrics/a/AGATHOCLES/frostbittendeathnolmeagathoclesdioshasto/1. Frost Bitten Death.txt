Snow, frost, winter has come
The season of death has just begun
People without homes die in the slums
No roof, good clothes, a frost bitten death

While we celebrate and have food on our plates
Homeless people cry, they're afraid to die
And the stations close, got kicked out in the cold
Still no fucking heat, only society's greed
