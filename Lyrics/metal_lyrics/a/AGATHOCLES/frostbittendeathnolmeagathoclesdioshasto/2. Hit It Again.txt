What the fuck have you done
You senile scum
You couldn't resist, resist the hit
For another trip
Messed up and hooked, chained for good
Became a crook
Money for dope, your only hope
Unless the rope

Stealing from the ones
Who gave you warnings
Abusing all the ones
Who gave you a chance
But now it's time to realize
Your fucked up mind full with lies
Has lost all chances for sympathy
Fucked up, drugged out, no dignity
