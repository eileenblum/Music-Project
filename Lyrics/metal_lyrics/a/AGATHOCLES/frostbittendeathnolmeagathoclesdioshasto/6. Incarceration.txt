Just be careful, with the things you say
State is watching, you and me
Reactive minds, are a problematic kind
They might open minds, which were kept blind

Incarceration, incarceration
Just because of what I thought
Incarceration, incarceration
Just because of my fucking words

Just fucking hear, what the state dictates
Get them back, by their own debate
But as you know, the state's afraid
Of active minds, which they can't enslave

Incarceration, incarceration
Just because of what I thought
Incarceration, incarceration
Just because of my fucking words
