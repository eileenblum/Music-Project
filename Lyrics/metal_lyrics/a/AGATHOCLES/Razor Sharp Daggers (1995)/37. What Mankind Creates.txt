What mankind creates will be mankinds'destruction
technology is every problems'solution,
well, that's what they say, but don't fucking believe them,
'cause these are just lies, of this sick fucked up system,
Two hundred years of industrialisation,
have fucked up this Earth real badly,
they say technology creates new jobs, for them capitalist bastards,
but what about creating a decent job for the others ?
