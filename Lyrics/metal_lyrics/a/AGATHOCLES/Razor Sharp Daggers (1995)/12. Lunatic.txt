Freezing void,
I'm lost,
They say I'm a lunatic
and that I've lost my mind,
But I'm not a lunatic,
I'm just dead,
Creeping silence,
In my head,
They say I'm a lunatic
and that I've lost my mind,
But I'm not a lunatic,
I'm just dead,
He's in my head, the lunatic
Desolation,
my destination,
I have reached,
the end....
