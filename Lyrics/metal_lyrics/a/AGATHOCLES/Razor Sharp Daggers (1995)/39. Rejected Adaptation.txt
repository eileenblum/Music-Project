We've read in a magazine,
How to belong to the scene
What to listen to, what to wear,
and how to cut our fucking hair,
But we, we don't give a fuck,
Because we, we think all conformists suck,
We just gonna stay ourselves,
dirty fucking mince-core scum,
you'll just have to accept this fact,
because we'll never gonna sign your pact,
But we, we don't give a fuck,
Because we, we think most people suck,
For some we might be assholes,
'cause we got different goals,
but all we ask is some respect,
'cause we never gonna join your sect,
But we, we don't give a fuck,
Because we, we think all conformists suck.
