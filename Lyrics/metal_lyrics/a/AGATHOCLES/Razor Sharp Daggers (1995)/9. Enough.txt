You always told me what to do,
but I've had enough, enough of you,
I can't take it anymore,
You make my head feel fucking sore,

What's going on in my fucked up mind,
What's going wrong in my fucked up mind,

Put a gun to your head,
and blow your skullm full with lead,
pull the trigger again and again,
that's when I'll be smiling again,

What's going on in my fucked up mind,
What's going wrong in my fucked up mind,
