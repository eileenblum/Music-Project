There's no reason to hide my hate,
Because when I'll be gone, it'll all be too late,
The hatred in me is the system you made
The reason I'm here is to make you all taste
GONE
PAIN
ANGUISH
AGONY
TORTURE
Still there's not less hatred in me
Captured in life, can not be free
Solution in hatred, solution in grief,
That's why I want the mass to bleed.
