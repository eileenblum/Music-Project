Oh, you're so fucking cool,
now you have become an army tool
mind frustrated, you joined their clan,
for legal butchery of innocent men,
Now you're a man since you joined their clan,
now you're a zero, a zero-ego,
And don't talk crap about human acts,
'cause you know it's a farce,
to hide your hunger for violence,
your need to hate and for suspense,
Now you're a man since you joined their clan,
now you're a zero, a zero-ego,
And in the pubs you beat us up,
for no reason, you macho stud,
but at least we've got an own mind
instead of following the army blindly.
