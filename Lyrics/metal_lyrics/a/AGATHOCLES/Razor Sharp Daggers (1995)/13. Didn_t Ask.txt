I'm not the one to blame,
for me going insane,
So who's to fucking blame,
for your face to be maimed ?
I didn't ask your bullshit,
I didn't ask for it
You're the one who made me do it,
by provoking me, mister prick
I've lost all control
became a violent asshole
no responsibilities,
frustrations have been unleashed,
I didn't ask your bullshit,
I didn't ask for it
You're the one who made me do it,
by provoking me, mister prick
