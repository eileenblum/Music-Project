Go to school and cut your hair,
get a job, the state pays fair,
get a partner, get some kids,
make sure that you will fit,
What about my future ?
Is it really mine ?
What about my future ?
Or is it the state's future ?
Don't talk shit about a free choice,
'cause it's only the systems voice,
I don't wanna walk any alternative ways,
just give me the nihilistic way,
Yes, it's my future,
and I will use it,
Yes, it's my future,
to crack the state's future.
