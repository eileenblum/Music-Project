People behave like sheep
conformists, but still they weep,
Weeping for their conditioned existance
determinded, but not by their own minds,
oh yes, people behave like sheep,
But at least we try to be the black ones....
Why are you so afraid to fight the system ?
Because we all take part of this system ?
Systems are based upon human minds,
but systems can be changed by our hands.
