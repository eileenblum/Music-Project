Doing pot, oh, you're so cool,
A would-be punk, wanna change the rules,
Hash and pot,
Controlled by the mob
You pot head-dorks
Exploit the poor,
Third-world farmers, exploited each day,
For you to have a hit, so you could fly away,
Hash and pot,
Controlled by the mob
You pot head-dorks
Exploit the poor,
Ridiculous wages is what they get paid,
Revolutionary hash-heads, another joke to me,
Hash and pot,
Controlled by the mob
You pot head-dorks
Exploit the poor,
