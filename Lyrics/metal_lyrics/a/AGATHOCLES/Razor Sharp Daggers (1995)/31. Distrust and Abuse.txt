You just hang around - and follow each trend,
Only for making money - you start a band,
You play the stuff - which is "in",
And in this stupid contest - you always try to win,
What's going on, in your fucking mind,
Are you that stupid, or completely blind,
Can't you see, you're just a clown,
Can't you make up, your fucking mind,
Can't you resist, or aren't you that strong,
When will you start, to think about that,
Try to be yourself,
Don't follow each trend
Then you'll get,
Some real true friends.
