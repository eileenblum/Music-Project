I watch them at our gigs
With an A on their backs
The A stands for arrogance
'coz respect they surely lackI watch them at our gigs
With an e on their jacks
The E stands for enemy
And egocentric

Dogmatic values is what they create
Another bullshit thing that i fucking hate
Telling me what I should do telling me what I shouldn't do
Another hardcore-master another punk-guru
Preaching about respect and so-called equality
But they're just creating and elitarian scene
Would-be gods destroying all the things we've built
Oh yes they're so punkâ¦
