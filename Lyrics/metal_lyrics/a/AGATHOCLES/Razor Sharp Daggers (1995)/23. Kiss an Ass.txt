You say our music is fucked, but what about yours ?
At least we are creative, autonomous and more,
We're not kissing asses, or sucking managers'balls
Corporate fuckheads, can't do it alone,
Puppets on a string, pathetic assholes,
Keep your jealous talks, your back stabbing and go home,
Go kiss an ass and lick some balls,
You say the underground is crap, but why are you so bothered ?
Oh yes, maybe it hurts, by business-men being fucked,
But you're just a one-day fly, the next day you will be dumped,
