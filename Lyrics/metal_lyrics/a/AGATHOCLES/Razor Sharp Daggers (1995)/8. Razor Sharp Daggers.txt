What's the sensation,
of a bull-fight show ?
For pain and mutilation,
sick people wanna go,
Tradition, so they say,
paid cruelty to me,
Bloodshed, tears fled,
sets the bulls free
Razor sharp daggers, stabbed in the bull's neck
barbarous entertainment, animals on the rack
Arena-sand turn reds, spreading the stench of death,
it's just a sick sensation, kill the bull fighter instead,
But when the Bull wins,
no-one is gonna clap,
Fair fight, fair price ?
still the final end is death,
bull-fighter received as a hero,
accepted, respected,
But just face the truth
of this legal animal abuse.
