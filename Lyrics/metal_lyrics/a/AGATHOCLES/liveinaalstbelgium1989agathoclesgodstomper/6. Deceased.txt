Capitulation to the reaper
My coffin is sinking slowly deeper
Shall I meet the gates of Heaven
Or the pits of Hell
My flesh submits into decay
My intestines start to rot away
But still I didn't see the signs
Of which (the) religious tell

There ain't no Heaven, there ain't no Hell
You are just gonna melt
[x2]

Satan failed to find my soul
And Heaven leaves me in this hole
Or both are only dwelling more
In human fantasies
Still I didn't face my fate
And I realise I shouldn't wait
To feed the hungry maggots
In the task of the deceased
