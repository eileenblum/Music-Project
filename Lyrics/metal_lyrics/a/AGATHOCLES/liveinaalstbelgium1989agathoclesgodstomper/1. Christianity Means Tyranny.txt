Did you even realise 
That millions of people 
Had to die 
For Christianity? 

All those people found their death 
Accused of witchcraft or charged with heresy 
And still they tell that Jesus loves people 
But why so many bloodshed of innocent people? 

And that stupid Pope 
He exploits poor, innocent people 
Why don't they admit 
Christianity means tyranny? 

All those people found their death 
Accused of witchcraft or charged with heresy 
And still they tell that Jesus loves people 
But why so many bloodshed of innocent people?
