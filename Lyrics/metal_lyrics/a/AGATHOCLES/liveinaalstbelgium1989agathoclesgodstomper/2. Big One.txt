Aggressive soldiers are coming near 
Whole the world is filled with fear 
First victims are falling down 
Will I be the next to die? 
Look at the sky, and what do I see? 
See big bombs falling upon me 
I get up to take my breath 
But instead some bullets in my head 

The first attack isn't totally completed 
But our Earth is intensely defeated 
I lay suffering on the ground 
And I hear the others crying 
Last strike raging with violence 
But what is the use, all is dead 
After the big one, there are none 
Only corpses rotting to the bone
