This world's leaders are going to decide
Above peace, war or suicide
And for this decision, we can't hide
'Coz these bastards rule us with fright

USA-USSR PROFIT &amp; POWER
USA-USSR PLAYING WITH LIFES

They'll open Europe's front door wide
The door of war where so many have died
The killing of mankind, day and night
And it's just the beginning of their might

USA-USSR PROFIT &amp; POWER
USA-USSR PLAYING WITH LIFES

They fight their wars out in our space
They play games with the human race
They've just counted our last days
King death has come to rule with hate
