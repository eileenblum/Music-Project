Why do you look at me
In that judging way
Is it something that I wear
Or my filthy fucking hair?

You there - you stare
You there - don't come near

I see you at gigs, with expensive clothes
I guess it's a must, for this fashion core
Image and scenery are number one
A hollow movement for hollow minds
