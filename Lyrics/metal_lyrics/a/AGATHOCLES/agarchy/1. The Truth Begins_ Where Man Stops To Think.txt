This philosophical topic - is really difficult to explain 
It's about the fucking truth - we are all searching, but in vein 
All we feel, all we think - it's all subjective 
Why not say it radically - it's all deceptive 

The truth begins - where man stops to think 
You ain't right - you ain't right at all 
The truth itself doesn't belong here 
Well materialists - you just be aware 

And this philosophical topic - it won't lead to an end 
It's so fucking immense - you won't even understand 
So why don't you admit - you don't know anything 
Despite your theatric - and your rational thinking
