âListening to all the birds
Black ones and brightly colored
Some are real, some are fake
But the latter one gets all the cakeâ

Agarchy, humanly not to be found
Agarchy, what we canât talk about
Agarchy, where philosophers stop to think
Agarchy and theatre, there ainât no link

Agarchy, free from materialistic views
Agarchy, understandable for a few?
Agarchy, is it out of this world?
Agarchy, it sure ainât this fucked up world
