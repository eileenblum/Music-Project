Culture of degradation,
it's a macho-nation,
culture of degradation,
fortifies the separation,

I'm sitting at my home,
me and my friend TV alone,
soon he will show to me,
all the things I like to see,

The degradation has got to stop,
no more "meat" for the macho-block
women are humans too,
satiated minds have got no clue,
TV-stations do their best,
to get the biggest breasts,
dollar-signs broadcast her on the screen,
because they know it turns on the macho-scene
