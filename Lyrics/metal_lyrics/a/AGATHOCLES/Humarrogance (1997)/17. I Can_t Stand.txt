I can't stand the hatred, the hatred in me,but still it remains there, it's a part of me, I can't stand the pessimism, the pessimism in me,but still it remains there, a little part of me, I can't stand the apathy, the apathy living in me,but still it remains there, it's a part of me, I can't stand the negativism, which is living in me,but it's all a part of me, I am fucking sorry!!!
