Heard that love is in the airbut the only thing I breathe is gas,gas of Misanthropiathe myth of love is dead, Feel like being not understood,god, I wish you fucking could,visit my island of sorrow,love today, hate tomorrow Walking among the trees,on my island full of sorrow,trees resembling corpses,ain't I a happy bastard? Just all in my head,these thoughts of of fucking death,maybe all fantasies,but oh so real to medon't wanna be positive,'cause there will always be "if"no need to fucking hope,for good times which won't come
