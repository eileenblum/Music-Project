Feel the pain of forests
as acid rain is falling down
taste the flavour of poison
burning in a fish's mouth

And as years pass by,
I still ask "why, why ?"
is it in our genes ?
to kill and maim and destroy beauty ?

Earth feel the greed of humans,
carving like a knife
Earth weeps 'cause she's desperated
she knows she's going to die

And as years pass by,
I still ask "why, why ?"
is it in our genes ?
to kill and maim and destroy beauty ?
