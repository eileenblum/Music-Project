Just heard the news on my radio,social security funds will be cut down, Just saw the news on my TV-screen,government decides "work or die", Government decides, wants us to bend,why should I listen? I did not vote them, Government sucks our wallets dry,for their stinking capitalist lives, Kneel and pay,for the ones the mass has voted for,Kneel and pay,for the ones who surely do not care
