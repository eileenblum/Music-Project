The closing of factories when there is no need,
reduction of jobs 'cause of capitalist greed,
fulfilling their wallets not social needs,
reason for actions, reason for deeds,

The bastards not willing to listen our griefs,
police protecting those who deceive,
no voice will be heard, except (those of) our fists,
reason for actions and to resist,

Another factory closed down, hundreds of
people on the dole, without a fucking reason
to be, closed down and shut down
