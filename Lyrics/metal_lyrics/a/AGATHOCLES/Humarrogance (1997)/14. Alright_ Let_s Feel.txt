Alright, let's feel,
with no civil rights,

Police stopped me in the street,
"open your bag, we wanna see",
asked me what I was doing there,
"show your passport, you filthy long-haired"

Was nothing wrong what I did,
just went home from a gig
police-officer, civilians' friend?
state-control till the end.
