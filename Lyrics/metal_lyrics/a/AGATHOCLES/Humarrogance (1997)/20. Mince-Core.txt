Oh yes, we do hate labels,
but they leave us no other choice,
grind is not a synonym,
for homophobic noise,
active and thought-provoking,
this is called MINCE-CORE,
so, joint our fight to protect,
the ANARCHO-GRINDCORE,

Mince - death to homophobia and sexism
Mince - lifestyle of socio-anarchism,

We don't need these ignorant,
discriminating talks,
we don't need this crap,
from those who think with their cocks,
is "fag-bashing" really that tough?
well, bash yourself instead,
'cause in MINCE-CORE there is no room,
for racist, fascist scum,

Mince - death to homophobia and sexism
Mince - lifestyle of socio-anarchism.
