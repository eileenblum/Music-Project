Smelling the odours of death,walking next to a macho-stud,his perfume taking my breath,tested on animals, tortured to death, Smelling the odours of death,on a high-society-bitch her head,her perfume taking my breath,tested on animals, tortured to death, Who the fuck wants to reek "swell",when animals have gone through hell,biting perfume in their eyes,to show off and smell good, they died, Smell death - captured in a perfume-spraySmell death - animals' pain, bottled awaySmell death - captured in a perfume-spraySmell death - who the fuck needs it anyway?
