Hate enlightens my dark mind,'what the fuck, do you think I'm blind/something was fucking up in my head,did not cause it was "them"giant ice-brick takes controlonce my mind, now ice-coldand as my feelings start to freeze"them" will die, on their knees ice - cold - brick,in - my - mind,it - won't - thawunless - they - die Battlefield in my head,"them" as victims, me as Death,swing my axe, my axe of ice'cut their feelings and strings of lifevictory is what will be,in this ice-brick living in mein my head, these fantasiesshould I hope they'll become reality?
