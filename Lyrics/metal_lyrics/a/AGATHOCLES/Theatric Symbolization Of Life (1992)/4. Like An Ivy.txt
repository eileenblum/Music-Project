You're lurking like an ivy for prey
For victims you want to betray
Eyes like roses to cover the thorns behind
The sweetness of your appearance
To cover the bitterness of your inside
With honey you attrack and trick
It's the paradox between nice and sick
But remember, a little flower can grow too
And can have thorns to show you!!
