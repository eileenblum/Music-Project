You are struggling with intense revolt
A thoughtless mind, but not too bold
I wonder where you left yer pride
To play yer music fuckin' loud

You were just a fashion pig
On threshold to senility

You turned into a different state
The silly dick you used to hate
You're dressed up nice &amp; cut yer hair
You even have perfumed underwear

You were just a fashion pig
On threshold to senility

But I'll rip out yer eyes
So I can **** on your brains
