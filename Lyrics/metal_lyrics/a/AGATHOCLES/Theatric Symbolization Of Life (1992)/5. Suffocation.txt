Just for you
I opened up
Is this true?
Or just another joke?

Insomnia
Reigns over me
Heart beats fast
Again another show?

Insidious
And false insights
Again I ask
Was I so blind?

What's the point of being here?
Misery is oh so near
Happiness has fled away
I hope it will return one day

Yeah, that's life
Where I am trapped inside
Why can't I be me?
Why can't I be free?

Suffocated
In my feelings
Suffocated
In hypocrisy

Still I hope
That I can hope
In my hell
Once a happiness-well
