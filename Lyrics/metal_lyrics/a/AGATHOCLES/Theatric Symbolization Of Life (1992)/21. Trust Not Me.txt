Grinding &amp; mincing &amp; cutting you legs
Do not think that I'll fall for your regrets
Because of radiation, I can read your thoughts
And now I can see thru your hypocrisy
Year after year, you fed me with lies
You were always pretending, pretending to be nice
Your abuse of my trust, has provoked my hate
Now I'll rip you to shreds, and I'll use you as bate

Things I believed as true, have now become lies
The ignorance in me, has flown away like flies

The kindness I used to have, is now replaced by hate
Don't talk shit about regrets, 'coz now it is too late
