Preaching things
You don't even understand
Being alternative
Just another trend

Acting depressed
To trick all the rest
You say you are you
But I can see through you

People believe
Your lie-based truth
Even I must admit
Your talks are really smooth

Alternative - another trend
Alternative - a disguise
Alternative - another trend
Alternative - just theater

By telling your misery
You try to earn pity
I only can say
Stop your STUPID GAME
