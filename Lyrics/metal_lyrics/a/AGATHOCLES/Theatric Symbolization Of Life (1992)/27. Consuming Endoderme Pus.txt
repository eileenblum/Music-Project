Animal slaughter, it continues all the time
The meat-industry is growing
But I'll tell you, what I'll do you to you
You, ignorant consumers!!

I'll undo you from your skull
Consume yer endoderme pus
I'll eat the maggots meal
By chewing on your corpse

I'll tear open yer thorax
Wind up yer innards
To feed my hungry stomach
And to stop yer filthy greed
