This philosophical topic - is really difficult to explain
It's about the fucking truth - we all are searching, but in vain
All we feel, all we think - It's all subjective
Why not say it radically - It's all deceptive

The truth begins - where man stops to think
You ain't right - you ain't right at all
The truth itself - doesn't belong here
Well materialists - you just be aware

And this philosophical topic - it won't lead to an end
It's so fucking immense - you won't even understand
So why don't you admit - you don't know anything
Despite your theatric - and your rational thinking
