Truth - based on lies
Covered - in disguise
Don't wanna be a toy
Nor consumption for human joy

Majority pounds on me
But I only wanna be me
I've told other about this
But now I'd rather take a piss

Few people understand
What this is all about
Human equality
Both physically and mentally

But why even bother
And are there any others
Who try to understand
And that I can call 'a friend'
