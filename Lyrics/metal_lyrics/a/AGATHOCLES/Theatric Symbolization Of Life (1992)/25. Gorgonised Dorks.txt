GORGONISED - Don't let people shit on your head
GORGONISED - Don't obey them like they've said
GORGONISED - Don't let them control your life
GORGONISED - Just remember that you're one of a kind

GORGONISED - Majorities always tell you what to do
GORGONISED - But a free opinion is not taboo
GORGONISED - Be yourself, then you are unique
GORGONISED - Or be influenced, and be a fake
