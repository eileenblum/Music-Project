[performed by Agathocles]Computers control conception
Through microscopic intercourse
No more natural procreation
Which delays the final race

Cybergenetic annihilation
In order to erase
Ceasing abnormality
Once again the Ã¼bermensch will rise

Processors are talking over
Alienating the brain
No more need for a name
All humans known by number

DNA-cloning becomes perfect
To start a masterrace
Programmed by computers
To forget the good old days
