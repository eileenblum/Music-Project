[performed by Agathocles]Elite-crew conditions
With dogmatic world-visions
Judging strange behavior
Punished with aggression

Do not be creative
Just bow down and kneel
Do not speak for yourself
Just follow the grey crew

Weak personalities - domesticated by this crew
Uniformised stupidity - obey and act like they do
Superior inferiority - massconcept not identity
Army of blaring sheep - no will, no strength, just weak
