Can't you fucking see,
There are so many things to change,
What we need is unity,
So we can break our fucking chains.
Put away our differences,
To fight the common enemy,
Put away our differences,
Throw away our stupidity.
Overcome your stubborness,
Because there's something worse,
Greed is threatening us,
And it's making us very cross.
