Love is an abstract
Because it's so unreal
Love is something
Something I just can't feel.
Is there something magic?
When two people kiss,
Is there something wonderful,
That I should have missed?
I call myself a misanthrope,
It's the only way I can cope,
I call myself a mysanthrope,
I have given up all hope
