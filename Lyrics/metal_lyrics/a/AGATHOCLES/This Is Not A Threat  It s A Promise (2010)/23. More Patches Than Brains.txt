Hey you, yes you, staring at the mirror, to check if you look cool
Hey you, yes you, sewing up those patches, to fit the HC school
Hey you, yes you, your jacket full of patches seems your âentrance cardâ
Hey you, yes you, DIY activist or a walking advertising board?

Your fucking dress code, is a fucking joke
Wrapped up nicely, the content empty

More patches then brains
A living painting in an empty scene
