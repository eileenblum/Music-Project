Public services, raising their prices
Not for more quality nor job security
At the same time, cutting jobs down,
To pay ridiculous big managersâ salaries
Who the fuck decides, that prices have to rise?
Public services are public property
And who the fuck decides, whoâs gonna be in charge?
Political manipulation above qualifications

Do we agree? With the corruption of public property?
Do we accept? Politiciansâ greedy quest?
