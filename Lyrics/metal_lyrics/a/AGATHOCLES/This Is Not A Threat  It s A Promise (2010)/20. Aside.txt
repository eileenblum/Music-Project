Wandering in the streets when the sun goes down
While my feelings start to freeze
Thinking about my life, things happened in the past
While kissing a misty breeze

Street lights popping on, sun has totally gone
My shadow starts to creep
I take its hand, as my guide
and together we softly weep

a cold fog turns our tears to ice
as weâre looking at past lies
itâs time to clear our constant fears
and to manipulate lifeâs fucking dice

while walking between grey concrete blocks
we realize our good luck
while crossing the street, we look aside
staring int(w)o white lights
