Returning from battle
Limbs gone, mind shattered
Stateâs fucking decision
Based on greed, not wisdom

Sent out to fight
Without knowing whoâs right
Thereâs no glory in dying
For fuckers whoâre lying

Marching towards death
Pumped full with led
The battle for liberty
A demonic black fantasy

During the battle
Slaughtered as cattle
Dead bodies sent home
While new ones need go
