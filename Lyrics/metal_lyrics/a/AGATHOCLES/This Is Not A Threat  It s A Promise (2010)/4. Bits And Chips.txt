Are you willing to be a fucking number?
Are you doomed to sleep and fucking slumber?

Weâre all reduced to zeros and bits
Our lives, all captured in a microchip

No way, lives canât be reduced to numbers
Each day, make your life fucking thunder

Weâre all reduced to zeros and bits
Our lives, all captured in a microchip
