self-made superiority
but what about responsibility?
the arrogance of the human race
only led to blood and hate
why would men be the upper-class?
while we represent the ignorant mass
why don't we use our rational mind
to see other species are less blind
superiority overdose-human fools
superiority overdose-man will loose
self-made superiority
but what about responsibility?
the arrogance of the human race
only led to blood and hate
