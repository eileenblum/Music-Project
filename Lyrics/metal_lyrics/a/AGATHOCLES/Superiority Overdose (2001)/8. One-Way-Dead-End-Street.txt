have you ever wondered,
if you are leading your own life
don't you feel controlled?
can't you feel no strife?
do you feel fucking free?
in the things that you fucking do
or could it be your very own life,
which is being lived for you
you're walking down a one-way-dead-end street
can't you see change is what we need
only we can make this system fall
be aware of today's state-control
do you feel fucking free?
in the things that you fucking do
or could it be your very own life,
which is being lived for you
state-control-leads to walking in a row
walking in a row-makes you a puppet in their show
have you ever wondered,
if you are leading your own life
don't you feel controlled?
can't you feel no strife?
do you feel fucking free?
in the things that you fucking do
or could it be your very own life,
which is being lived for you
you're walking down a one-way-dead-end street
can't you see change is what we need
only we can make this system fall
be aware of today's state-control
do you feel fucking free?
in the things that you fucking do
or could it be your very own life,
which is being lived for you
this system's show- is making you blind
it's making you blind- for manipulations and their lies
