what the fuck do you want from me?
what the fuck is there to see?
don't pin your stereotypes upon me
'cause you'll never, never know me
people judge me because of my looks
but I ain't no stereotype from TV nor books
how the fuck can they claim to know me
their distorted visions are labeling me
how can you know- what I feel
how can you know- what I need
how can you know- what I wish
fuck yourself- and take a piss
