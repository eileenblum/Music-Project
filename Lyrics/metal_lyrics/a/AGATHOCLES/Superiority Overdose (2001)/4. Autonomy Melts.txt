the older you get, the deeper you get sucked in
sucked into society, your autonomy melts
freedom a joke, follow their rules and choke
your autonomy melts, strapped by society's belts
autonomy melts, autonomy melts
but I refuse to kiss the arse of society
autonomy melts, autonomy melts
but I refuse to kiss the arse of society
