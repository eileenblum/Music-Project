oh Alexandra with your dog-shit head
I really hate the ideas that you spread
you think your little club reigns supreme
but we'll smash your fascist dream
Alexandra's end â I feel the urge to kill you today
Alexandra's end
Alexandra's end- if I were you I'd surely go away
Alexandra's end
Alexandra's end- we'll impale you if you stay
Alexandra's end
Alexandra's end- they say plants can't feel anyway
Alexandra's end
your homophobic thoughts make me sick
your fascist talks make me wanna throw a brick
a brick in your face, that would be a laugh
just suck the popes' dick and stick it up your arse
Alexandra's end â I feel the urge to kill you today
Alexandra's end
Alexandra's end- if I were you I'd surely go away
Alexandra's end
Alexandra's end- we'll impale you if you stay
Alexandra's end
Alexandra's end- they say plants can't feel anyway
Alexandra's end
you think your little club reigns supreme
but we'll smash your fascist dream
