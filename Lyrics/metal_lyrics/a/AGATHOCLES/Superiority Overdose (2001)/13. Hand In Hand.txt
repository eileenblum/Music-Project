They raised their arms at our gig
Shouting sieg hail, they think it is hip
They got kicked out and started again
Then cops came, defending them

Now they've pushed us, pushed us too far

Our state says they won't give them a chance
But cops and fascists go hand in hand
When there's trouble, we're the bad
The fascists go free is what the cops said

Now they've pushed us, pushed us too far
