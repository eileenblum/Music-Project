why divisions between movements
who are fighting for the same change
divide and conquer, is the game
the way the capitalists are playing the game
we should stick, stick together
'cause the aim is the same
forget those little differences
'cause the aim is the same
divide and conquer, is the game
the way the capitalists are playing the game
we should stick, stick together
'cause the aim is the same
