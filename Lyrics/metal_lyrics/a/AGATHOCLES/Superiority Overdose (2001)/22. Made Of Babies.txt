innocent baby-seals beaten to death
for a fur coat , all this bloodshed
for some this is normal, but it ain't for me
a sick status symbol made of babies
with hooks and bats they crush the head
of a little baby which ain't ready for death
who can justify this massacre
for a coat which only the rich can afford?
