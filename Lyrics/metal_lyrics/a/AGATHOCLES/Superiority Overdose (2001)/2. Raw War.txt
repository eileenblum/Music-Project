Hey my little friend, it is all up to you
to break down the group-pressure, which is forcing you
life is a raw war that you have to fight
but I believe in you because you're one of a kind
saying no to them is the power that's in you
the strength that I respect, the force that hides in you
life is a raw war that you have to fight
but I believe in you because you're one of a kind
the pressure that you fight, yes, those arseholes with their might

you can resist them all, yes, you can bring them down
