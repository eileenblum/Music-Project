new school, old school, all bollocks to me
seems a name means more, then the ideology
divided in two camps, no sign of unity
common goals put in the closet in a split up scene
no sign of unity-are you trying to be the hardest?
no sign of unity-are you trying to be the straightest?
no sign of unity-are you trying to be the toughest?
no sign of unity-are you trying to be the coolest?
new school-please, explain me what it is
old school-is there something that I've missed?
no school-I won't be put in a crew
fuck schools-I just do what I wanna do
