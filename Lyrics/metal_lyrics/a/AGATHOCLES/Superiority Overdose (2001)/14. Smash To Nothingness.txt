kiss my misanthropical grin
taste my urge to sin
to disobey the rules of conformity
forced upon us by our sheep-society
smash to nothingness
with my hammer of knowledge and alternatives
I smash their restrictive dogmas to nothingness
I know I might not come really far
but I'll never kneel to the conformist lord
smash to nothingness
kiss my misanthropical grin
taste my urge to sin
to disobey the rules of conformity
forced upon us by our sheep-society
smash to nothingness
