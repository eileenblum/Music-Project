shouting for a change of tide
but for what cause do you fight?
you keep on walking in the same line
next elections you'll vote the other one
useless judgement, useless judgement
only by judging what you see on TV
you won't be able to spread your idea
at least we do what we do best
we try to reach the critical mass
useless judgement, useless judgement
your useless judgement will not change
the problems that you have to face
salvation been preached on TV
can't you see through their hypocrisy
shouting for a change of tide
but for what cause do you fight?
you keep on walking in the same line
next elections you'll vote the other one
