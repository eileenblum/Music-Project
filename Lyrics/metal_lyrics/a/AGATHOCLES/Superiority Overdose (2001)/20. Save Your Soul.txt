why should I pray, when my soul won't be saved?
why be a slave, gods' salvation is just fake
another invention to prevent social change
in order to increase, the profits of the state
gods' salvation is states' creation
to prevent us to fight for a better nation
gods' salvation is states' creation
to prevent us to fight for a better nation
why should you stick, stick to your faith
and wait until, until it's too late
while companies are fucking and raping the mass
the ones they abuse, for them to make cash
gods' salvation is states' creation
to prevent us to fight for a better nation
gods' salvation is states' creation
to prevent us to fight for a better nation
religion and capital go hand in hand
a ruling class-tool to fuck the rest
sit back, act not, believe in a god
a life of suffering and then you will rot
