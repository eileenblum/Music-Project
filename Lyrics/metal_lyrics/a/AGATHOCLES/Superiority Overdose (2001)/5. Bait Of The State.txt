don't be a fool, don't be an army-tool
you'll be army-bait, a puppet of the state
without a purpose, without goals
you'll be used to slaughter innocent souls
bait of the state-so, what we're trying to say
bait of the state-don't throw your lives away
bait of the state-by bringing death and senseless pain
bait of the state-there ain't nothing to fucking gain
