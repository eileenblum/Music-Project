what a mess- the NATO has left in the Balkan place
a dictatorship- should not be fought with more tyranny
some casualties more- the NATO doesn't care
some targets missed- were the bombers fucking pissed?
more bloodshed- civilians bombed to fucking death
bomb-attacks- why not negotiating instead?

bombing at random
is cheaper than to store
all these deadly weapons
we've paid taxes for
