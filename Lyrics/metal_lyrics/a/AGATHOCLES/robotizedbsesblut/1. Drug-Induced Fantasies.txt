I was once at some party - oh yeah?
Guess who I've met - tell me!
Satan and his legions - really?
Having a few beers - no way!
Guess what he said
"I'm not real"
"I am just a fantasy"
"Living in your minds"
Tripped-out party - in your mind
Satans ' legions - having a pint
God and his angels - doing a joint
That's how religions have been born
I was once at some party - oh yeah?
Guess who I've met - tell me!
Satan and his legions - really?
Having a few beers - noway!
Guess what he said
"I'm not real"
"I am just a fantasy"
"Living in your minds"
