[performed by Agathocles]Who the fuck gave you the might?
To decide what's wrong or right?
Who the hell are you to say?
I'm no good because I'm gay!

Just sit down and explain tom e
What you think is wrong with me
Your judgements without consideration
Only lead to gay-discrimination

What's your problem with gays?
Why do you hate them anyway?
Why do you fear them anyway?
They're just like you and me

You say their ways are so wrong
Any proof to make your words strong?
You say you can't accept their choice
You should at least respect these boys!
