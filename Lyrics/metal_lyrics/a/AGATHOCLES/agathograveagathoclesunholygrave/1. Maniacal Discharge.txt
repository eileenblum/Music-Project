Life is full of despair 
Day after day 
Now you're maniac 
Time has come 

Lose control - manic discharge 

Life is full of suffering 
Night after night 
Now you're maniac 
Blind and insane 

Lose control - manic discharge 

Life is full of hatred 
Time after time 
Now you're maniac 
Out of sight 

Unpunished murderers everywhere 
Under the war
