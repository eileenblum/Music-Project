I feel so good among the human race,
I feel so good in this white place
I feel so good among the human race
They're so kind to my mental case
Cheers humanity - I'm happy as can be
Cheers humanity - if someone's crying it won't be me
Cheers humanity - I'm happy as can be
Cheers humanity - I'm the last one to complain
