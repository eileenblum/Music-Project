Having some fun, didn't mean much to me
my heart is filled with sadness because of thee
yes thee
why me
yes thee
leaving me empty, leaving me cold
nothing to do, nothing to hope
no hope
oh no
no hope
I searched for distraction, I searched for a goal
nowhere to find and no way to cope
to cope
oh no
to cope
still then it was raining in my brain
but now I feel fine, just read the head lines
yes fine
fine
real fine
lately felt better, lately felt good
golf is my sport, my game to play
to play
to play
to play
swung my club high and hit the ball hard
and imagined your head, that was being cracked
your head, it cracked, I laughed.
