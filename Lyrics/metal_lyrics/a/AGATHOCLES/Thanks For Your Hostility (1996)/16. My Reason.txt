Why does everything good - always comes too late ?
Is it to justify my - reason to hate ?
Abolishment of all respect, it's only give or take !
This all strengthens my - reason to hate
Silence yourself, words are trivial.
Without a meaning they're forgetable.
Your detachment shows this to me.
I'll never forget, all my reasons !
