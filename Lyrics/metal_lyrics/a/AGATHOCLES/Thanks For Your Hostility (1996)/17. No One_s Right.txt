Ever got the feeling that you're being controlled
not by the state but by friends you claim to know
being controlled is a common thing
but just act real and fucking win
I drink you don't, what a big deal
we still get a long and our friendship is real
being controlled is a common thing
but just act real and fucking win
you're not right and the same goes for me
we're just two friends with each our own ideas.
being controlled is a common thing
but just act real and fucking win
