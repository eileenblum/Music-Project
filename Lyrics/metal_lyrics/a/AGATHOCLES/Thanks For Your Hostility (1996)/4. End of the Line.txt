Your fire extinguished like never before,
cause it's a hard line that we draw.
Show you our gang's so much tougher,
'cause we joined to make fakes ones suffer.
If my words can't put out your smoke,
my fists will tell you it's not a joke.
If you don't join us in our walk,
my bat will be the one to talk.
Mirror reflects all that you fear,
following friends that are so dear.
Rejecting all that looks like fun,
enjoy your life before it's over and done.
Forcing people to change their ideals and be like you - end of the line.
Forcing people to change their respect, that's what you lack - end of the line.
