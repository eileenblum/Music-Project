Things done in the past, can be undone.
I can't close my eyes and wish they were gone.
There's nothing I can change, the facts will still remain.
It isn't fair of you to stay I'm to blame
Can you remember me ?
I guess I was wrong, to believe you're my friend,
Backstabbing isn't cool, so this is the end.
Things done in the past, can't be undone.
I won't close my eyes, 'cause they won't be gone.
Can you remember me ?
