Hey governement, do you give a fuck?
About the ones without a job
You say you create new jobs, but for who?
They surely ain't paid as good as you

Our governement promises to create new jobs
But what if they just ain't paid enough
To live a healthy and decent life
In their own wages, they have to put their knifes
