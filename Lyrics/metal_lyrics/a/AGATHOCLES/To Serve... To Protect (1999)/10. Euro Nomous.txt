The Euro-currency is coming near
I question why it's coming here
They wanna make Europe ''one''
But who will profit, when it's done?

United cash for the rich
Social security, what about this?

Promising a bright future
While homelessness still occurs
United Europe, but for who?
Will it be a glorious boom?
