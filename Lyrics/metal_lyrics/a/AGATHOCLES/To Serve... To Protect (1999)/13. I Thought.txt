Sat on the bus and had some beer
Went to a gig, quite far from here
Police came and asked my name
''Not your business'' was my reply

Cops were bashing up, up my head

I thought this was a free country
But some seem more free than me
Equality and democracy?
Act to make it reality

Cops were bashing up, up my head
