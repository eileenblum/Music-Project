Torrents of anger running through my veins
Lying in isolation in darkness I remain
In waiting for a sign of past visions of my life

Drift back to a distant primal self and visualize
Worlds locked within the make up of our cells
Transcend this life

Through the ages I've kept a part of us throughout time
I'm lost inside the mind in which I hide
I know what's seen by eyes is all a state of mind
If I'm dreaming I can't wake up

From conception we begin
Dying matter never ends
Are we only bred to die?
Just a shadow of our time

The mind brings the defiance of the soul

The history of mankind
The haunting images curse this life
I awaken and now realize it is all a state of mind
A prison well designed
Our limits defined
