Burning winds, celestial death
Inhale the torment searing me and consuming my breath
To ashes I am bound

Breathe the winds of decay
Oh fire, take me away from this place

Oh horrid obsession
Through death we meet again
Exquisite and formless the wind carries me
Drift now closer to heaven

No longer am I
Bound to this world of lies
Gone is the pain
Gone is this life
My remains to blacken the sky

Heavens denied
Blacken the sky

Oh horrid obsession
Through death we meet again
Choke on the embers of forgotten life
Blacken the sky

Heavens denied
Blacken the sky

Precious, godless, phoenix
One who rises from the ashes of a disembodied soul

I drift towards the abyss
Eclipse â the day is gone
Ascend to mournful heavens
To right what has been wronged
Displaced, I die to be reborn
I shed my flesh of scars once worn

Ignite the gates of heaven
Consume the throne of fraud
In tears I longed for her
Now I reach my hand beyond
Grey sinister clouds of darkness
Infest the world of God
Now watch the angels falling
From the scorched abysmal dawn

As they watched the angels falling
From the abysmal dawn
My soul begins to cry
Blacken the sky
