Conquering this poisoned land of dream
From this sleep I am now torn
A hatred vast turns this world to black
Fall unto your knees or you will suffer

Mute the screams
Of minds unleashed
Awakened from slumber
Servants will fall

For what we are we will now suffer
A mindless growing herd upon this earth

Servants to their knees

Awake at last drowning in this mass
Wondering now what is God?
Minds unleashed quell this wretched beast
Fall unto your knees or you will suffer...

For what we are

Mute the screams
Of minds unleashed
Awakened from slumber
Servants will fall
