Save me now from this plane
Liquefy my hatred
Give us shelter from the rain
Embrace your safety
heading through the fog
Floating in a dream
Awaken from the torment
We are obscene

Floating now in a dream
Holding back the urge to scream

Winds befall endlessly
Beating at a figure
Shout into the heartless gray
"What's next to conquer?"
Heading through the fog
Floating in a dream
Awaken from the torment
We are obscene

Unconquerable now we're salting the earth

I foresee the end complete
Ritually engulfed in suffering
Walk with me through fields of greed
Perpetually enslaved to selfish need

Will we find solace when we know the truth?
Will it bring us peace, or piece of mind?
Now bringing out our weakness; devotion absolute
Staring blankly at an empty sky

Unconquerable now we're salting the earth
Habitual, lifeless and born without worth

I foresee the end complete
Ritually engulfed in suffering
Walk with me through fields of greed
Perpetually enslaved to selfish need
Born to suffering
Walk through fields of greed now
