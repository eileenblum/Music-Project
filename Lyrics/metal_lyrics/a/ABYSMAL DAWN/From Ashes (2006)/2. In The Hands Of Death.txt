A darkest veil conceals the presence of us all
Through countless wages of war we find our kind
Ever elusive with time

Within the presence of another being
A failed kingdom shall fall
Distill the vengeance bestowed on me
Choose your allegiance for this war

Mankind's failed there's no escaping what's to come
In desperate times we cannot hide
Swift retribution is insured

Joining with destiny
Punishing without control
Cleansing humanity
What will be left of us all?

Life ending prophecy
The end has been right on the wall
Sands of mortality
Brushed by death, crumble and fall

Now turn these pages of insanity
Upon your threshold made of bone
Fading memories of what must be
Forgotten remnants of a throne overthrown
