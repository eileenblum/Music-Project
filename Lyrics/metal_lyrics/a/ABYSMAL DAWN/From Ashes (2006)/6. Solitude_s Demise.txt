Restless beings ones who walk this earth unseen eternally
Longing to be free

A new day has dawned
What's to become of them?

Ancient tongues of old once spoke of
Solitude's demise
Echoing from a silence broken
Only I can hear their cries

Spirits that long to be free enter my thoughts possessing me

Now I've seen the absence of humanity roaming free through out our history
The fallen of this age have come with weary eyes and broken hearts
Calling me to end this misery

Ancient tongues of old once spoke of
Solitude's demise
Echoing from a silence broken
Only I can hear their cries
Will they ever escape and be reborn?
Remnants of a past frozen
Kept alive in shapeless forms

A new day has dawned...
