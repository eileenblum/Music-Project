Wretched are those that be, search not for why
Cold demons barely alive
In wake of insanity why won't you rise?
Release us from evil that lurks inside

Father of mine
If thou art divine
When will you rise again?

For years forgotten pleas hung in the sky
Come to me oh serpent divine
Fall on hypocrisy bleed them of lies
Release us from evil that lurks inside

Father of mine
If thou art divine
When will you rise again?
I'm calling out!

Born of cancerous life all we touch withers and dies
The curse of humanity; a race against time
Wicked impulse to consume life

Wretched are those that be, search not for why
Cold demons barely alive
In wake of insanity why won't you rise?
Release us from evil that lurks inside

Father of mine
If thou art divine
When will you rise again?
Will you not rise again?
