Extracting cruelty
From those who go unseen
From a heart of malice
Comes grave atrocity

Cold is the flesh that yearns for the sun
Lying in earth forgotten, rotten and gone

Oh crown desire
Your thorns once made me weep
Pain now inspires
These wounds so bitter sweet

Roses once teardrops now fall in her hand
Woo the forsaken wearing the crown of desire

Gods cannot be failing now
Whores cannot be caring now
Worlds seem to be crumbling down
Time cannot be running out

Rotten and gone
Yearn for the sun
Woo the forsaken
Desire has come
