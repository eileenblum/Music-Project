Spiraling down into a world without a conscious
Selflessness a vision rarely seen
Crawling out of the sickness that surrounds us
Drifting from a womb of selfish greed

The righteous are long for death
Martyrs now cognizant

Filled with doubt my hatred becomes boundless
Cannot rest in dens of enemies
Let them pray for a change that they'll call progress
Renew their faith so that they may proceed

The righteous are longing for death
Martyrs now cognizant

I see the herds of passive flesh
Plunging to their untimely deaths
Our world is falling to pieces

[Chorus:]
The essence of this world is rotten
Decaying in a violent sea
Lost souls forgotten
In perpetual dormancy

I see the herds of passive flesh
Wandering from the hope they've left
Cannot forget their faces

[Chorus]

[Repeat 1st verse]
