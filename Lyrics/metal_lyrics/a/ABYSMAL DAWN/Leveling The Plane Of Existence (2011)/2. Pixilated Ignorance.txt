I am the new flesh
A distorted human being
Projections altered states within my mind
Is this a dream or another state of consciousness?
Reality of a fiction in my eyes

Violence engulfs the living dream
Reprograms me for control
Torture viewed upon the screen
Influence over us all

I am the new flesh
A distorted human being
A soldier in the battle for control
I see my new self in pixilated ignorance
An image condemned to leave me cold

[Pre-chorus:]
Perpetuation of fraud
Indoctrination of your God

[Chorus:]
Victimize masochistic masses
Dehumanize to gain control
Fortify your stranglehold

Pacify the living torment
Genocide of the soul
Mortified you come to an end
Humankind you're bought and sold

[Repeat 1st verse]

I live confined by all that I perceive
Kill me projections of life made to deceive

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]
