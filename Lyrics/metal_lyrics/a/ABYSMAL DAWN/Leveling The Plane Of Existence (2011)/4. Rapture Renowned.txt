My lust for power is my life
I align myself with those in darkness
I do refuse to see yet no I am not blind
Now I must endure this on my own

Ambitions and cold
Now die alone

I leave the ones I loved behind
Following my wanton heart of darkness
My selfish needs the change constantly with time
And now my dreams have turned to stone

Ambitions and cold
Now die alone

My disease â mortality
Long to live in memories
Selfish needs will bring no peace
Admit fault to admit defeat

[Chorus:]
My sins are atoned
In rapture renowned
My sins are atoned
I see the world through narrow eyes
You all were fashioned in my likeness
Am I not God and has my kingdom come?
No, I must endure this on my own

Exalt me and praise my likeness
Sickening being your time will come
Cut from me this rib of darkness
Set me free to carry on

[Chorus]
