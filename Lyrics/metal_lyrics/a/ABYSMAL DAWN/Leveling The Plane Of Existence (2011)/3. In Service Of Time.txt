Time moves in this vicious endless circle
Fulfilling the so called will of the divine
To enter this world alive is that same as when we die
Crawling on our knees in service of time

[Chorus:]
Chasing a dream you cannot seem to forget
Mistakes that you've made remembered in your dying breath
Time has a way of collecting its debts
Bringing us closer to death

Time adds to the weight upon heavy shoulders
With the knowledge that you will surely die

[Chorus]

Feel the decay of your life

Cruelty is false eternity
For the ones immortal in their own minds
We're born and raised to die
There's no meaning to this life
Indebted to a God enslaved by time

Man is a servant enslaved by time
God is a servant enslaved byâ¦

Time moves in this vicious endless circle
Fulfilling the so called will of the divine
There is no time for regret only regret with time
The fountains of your youth have run dry

[Chorus]
