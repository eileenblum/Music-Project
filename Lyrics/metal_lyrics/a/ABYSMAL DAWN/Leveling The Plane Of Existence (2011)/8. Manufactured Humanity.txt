They come to steal my soul
For this shell in their control
I look into darkness that stress back at me
Trapped in this cell I long to be free

My mind tortured day and night as I choke back a cry
Condemned to observation with this cloned form of life
Baring my resemblance I want him to die

[Chorus:]
Artificially grown
Manufactured humanity
We're genetically cloned

It's eyes now seem to look with a gaze made of stone
A morbid fascination to reap what they have sown
I murder this reflection this reflection so that I stand alone

The secrets of the soul
Unlocked as my sanity unfolds
Watch as this false form of life seems to fade
The essence of which I've learned to hate

In secrecy carried out experimentation
Horrific dream from which I cannot awaken
Heartless being soulless incarnation
Insanity â mentally deconstructed

[Chorus]
