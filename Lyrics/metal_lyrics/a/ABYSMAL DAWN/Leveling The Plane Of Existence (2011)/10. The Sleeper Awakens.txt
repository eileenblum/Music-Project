Empty as I lay here in waiting
Looking for a sign of life within this gloomy soul
Our time has expired but I will not let go
Inside of me I fight this battle alone

[Chorus:]
And the full moon will rise
On this world we've forsaken
Now that we've finally arrived
Let the sleeper awaken

Dystopia your children lay broken
Now sleep and dream through this future uncertain
Let the sun warm my face as my eyes burn with sulfur
Let me drink from your fountain just to die then of hunger

[Chorus]

Pain leaves their eyes
Now is there hope or only a fantasy?

Feel the change now with the dawn
Wondering what's to become
Expediency of death and birth
Descending into this blackened earth
Shadows cast to obstruct our view
Concealing us from a shameful truth
Cling the rotten breast and thirst for life
Hear the weeping brood of all mankind

Pain leaves their eyes
Now is there hope or only a fantasy?
