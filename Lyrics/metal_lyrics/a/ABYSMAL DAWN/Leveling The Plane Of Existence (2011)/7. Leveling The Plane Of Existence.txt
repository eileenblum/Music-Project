Endless seas of spontaneous generation
Extinction in the wake of the new dawn
Erosion of our species comes now in due time
Evolution at the cost of our own blood
Writhing in misery rapture comes now to us all
Hideous violent beings your decadence has come and gone

[Chorus:]
Worthless forms of life
Caught in the path of resistance
Your old order dies
We're leveling the plane of existence

Cleansing act of insidious evolution
Malignancy expunged now from this world
A new form of life â a new era has begun
Degradation the commencement of rebirth

[Chorus]

The waters will rise and your cities will crumble
Washed away with the tide drift off into nothing
The winter arrives and then turns to fire
No one will survive you're compost for creation

[Chorus]

Your old order dies!
