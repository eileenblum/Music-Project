Oh god is this the only path for me
Or is there some choice left?
While reaching for the stars we fall into regret
In deepest times of woe our destinies are met

The pain in me has finally left
I died to pay my last respects
To the thing I was and now I must endure
I know now I was weak and suffering's the cure

[Chorus:]
I'm my own savior
God lies in me
Reborn I'm my own creator
I control my destinyâ¦
Control my destinyâ¦
I control my destiny

We fall then rise with this everlasting ebb and flow

[Chorus]
