Spill onto canvas
Gruesome art stirs the consciousness
A last exhibit a masterpiece of mortal flesh
I'm falling down
My last breath is leaving now
I die wanting to show my truth
Poison leaves my eyes
A work of progress in the gallery laid to rest
I'm bought and sold an ornament in their control
Never wanted acceptance, so turn away in ignorance
My death is art and suffering is tortured bliss
I'm falling down
My last breath is leaving now
I die wanting to show my truth
Poison leaves my eyes
Absolve me and show my bleeding heart
For all to see in the gallery of grotesque modern art
A portrait steals the soul
Know me upon the wall
