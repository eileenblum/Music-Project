Lies are fed through structures quelling our mistrust
Ignorance is fodder for machines of want
Followers saturate the earth
Automate consumption and remove our minor worth
What are we, a collection of failures?
Fueling now what must be done?
Do we work for what we've created?
Just byproducts of manmade gods
I'm the end for you
Your impending doom
You must obey the limits
You're programmed to consume
Separate from feeling and hurt them when you must
Will is slowly slipping as gears turn to rust
Followers saturate the earth
Automate consumption and remove our minor worth
What are we now but untimely fissures
In a system soon to be undone?
Do we work for what we've created?
Just byproducts of manmade gods

[Chorus]

I am alive within your structure built against thought
Foundations bled now topple under sensation to fall
Man creates his prison
Blind and void of vision
Conditioned by the system you're never free
A symptom of the sickness that is us
Endless waking nightmare dilutes the dream
Rapid growing contagion of the soul
I'm the end for you
There's nothing you can do
You've created your limits
You're programmed to consume
