Children condemned by the light
Mourn their instinctive fears
Their questioning nature will disprove the lies
Containment of valor abandoned and now cast aside
Children born just to die
Living in mortal fear
Bring on dissension and break through their lines
You live an invention without meaning or true sacrifice
You cannot deny
A remission of life
Captive inside of their lives
Purpose never clear
The knowledge is there for you to find
The truth you may abhor
Questing for your human rights
In perilous longing forevermore
Children born just to die
Controlled by mortal fear
