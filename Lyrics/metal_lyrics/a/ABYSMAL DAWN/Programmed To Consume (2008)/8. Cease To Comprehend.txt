You hide behind a mask of ignorance
Your poor excuse won't last as your defense
You spend a lifetime living in contempt
Your end will soon come fast
Your time is at an end
I wreak vengeance on all of your kind
I bring judgment and the ending of lies
Step to the pulpit and hang your head
Live for this moment before we make you dead
Deceit that you've spread now is met with consequence
We reap the bitter fruits of this our sweet revenge
You seem to cease to comprehend
Words have a meaning, which you need to understand
I will your kingdom gone
Retribution swift and cold
You seem to cease to comprehend
Words have a meaning, which you need to understand
I will your kingdom gone
You take one last gasp pleading innocence
Your pain is all we ask as we make amends
You've spent a lifetime living in contempt
Your demise comes at least
Plead for the very end
I wreak vengeance on all of your kind
Bringing judgment and the ending of lies
Step to the pulpit and hang your head
Live for this moment before we make you dead
Deceit that you've spread now is met with consequence
We reap the bitter fruits of this our sweet revenge
