His DNA was reconstructed
The laws of nature which once obstructed
A mortal man to rise again
Have been rewritten to cleanse our sins
Hope in turn has made them blind
Cannot perceive the harsh realities that be
Their savior has risen to bring about the Christian holocaust
You must believe for this is a sign
Far beyond a dream he rises from torment divine
God is in me but now that I can see
They're putting out my eyes
Compulsory resurrection
Will bring an end to their infection
For how much longer can they defend
An artificial savior which bleeds like men
You must believe for this is a sign
Far beyond a dream he rises from torment divine
God is in me but now that I can see
They're putting out my eyes
Worlds they change yet reinstate their sordid martyrs up a upon a cross
