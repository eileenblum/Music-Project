Born into the realm of infamy
My mind secedes into the calm
Angels weep in the throes of their humility
Another day has come and gone
Twilight's fallen
Consumed by dark
God is forgotten
Your savior's lost
Kneel now at the altar of greed and hypocrisy
Gather strength to carry on
The cross they bear grows heavy on their weakened anatomies
The weight of guilt has brought them down
Twilight's fallen
Consumed by dark
God is forgotten
Your saviors lost
You can't be saved a truth obscured by lies
We are the plague from which you cannot hide
Twilight's fallen
Consumed by dark
Horrors forgotten
Return at once
This ripe disease has stripped them of self worth
The crows they feed and move for the kill
Spiritual oppression awakens iconoclasts
Violent processions are soon revealed
Set them free from the bonds of men
Let them breathe without despair
The things I've seen have sparked a new rebirth
Provoked by scenes that make me ill
Set them free from the bonds of men
Let them breathe without despair
Spiritual oppression awakens iconoclasts
Violent processions will rid them of false hope... false hope
Plunged into the land of infamy
A world consumed by rights and wrongs
You can't be saved a truth obscured by lies
We are the plague from which you cannot hide
