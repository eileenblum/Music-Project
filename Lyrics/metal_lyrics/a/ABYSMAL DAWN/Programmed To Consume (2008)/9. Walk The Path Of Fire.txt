We wanted so much but were doomed right from the start
The yearning, wanting more that comes with beating hearts
The path is shown and now we learn
Through trial and tribulation we grow and burn
Choose to walk the path of fire and return
With knowledge of a lost empire
We have forsaken dreams with envy in our hearts
The bitterness in me consumes my every thought
The path is shown and now we learn
Through trial and tribulation we grow
This haunted soul will never rest in peace
Until it learns it has expired
Remembering yet clinging onto nothing
We wander on this wretched earth all alone
Choose to walk the path of fire and return
With knowledge of a lost empire we now burn
Wallowing in the waste of doubt
Empathy given then taken
Misery will see this out
The truly free have nothing for taking
How should I feel when I feel nothing?
This void is growing now
Am I now free?
Now I have nothing
A smile can fool you all
When we finally reach those false shores of hope long desired
There's no turning back
In remembrance of things past we drift now and wonder
Why we've chosen the path of fire?
