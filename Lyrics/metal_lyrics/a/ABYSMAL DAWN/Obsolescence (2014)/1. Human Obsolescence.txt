Deterioration begins
The stage is set as we rush towards the end
You were programmed since birth
The epigenesis of a mechanized world

You live a life of regret
The harsh reality of the ends to be met
And in this lottery of birth
You were cast aside and made to serve

The experience of you life
A fading memory plagued by laws of wrong and right
But what could you have done?
The rules were already set before you had begun
It's too late to turn back now
No tears
Just lay your head in doubt
And accept now what's to come

[Lead: Elliott]

Our world of human obsolescence
Forever holds us in chains until we all turn to dust

[Solo: Elliott]

Your expiration is met
Your purpose is fulfilled; Make way for the next
You're at one with the earth
Your fragile anatomy released at last
