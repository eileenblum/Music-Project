In a constant state of over-stimulation
And we're not afraid to let our bodies die
We join the world of their cruel, cold design
Pacified, digitized beings are slowly inducted

Our prison state becomes a state of mind
Ambivalent towards everything
Constantly immersed in our misinformation
The truth we seek is pulling us in every...

Minds preoccupied
The trivial diverts our lives
A cage we can't perceive
Simulating reality

Distract and sub-divide
Voluntarily dehumanized
Accruing misery
Perfecting slavery

Crave a smile of vacant contentment
And find serenity in the machine
This mechanism for greed and hate
Drives us to exceed our needs

Can't you see our ambition makes us cruel?
Can't you see our ambition makes us ugly?
Capacity for love now dissipates
Join in the procession towards our fate

Minds preoccupied
The trivial diverts our lives
A cage we can't perceive
Simulating reality

Distract and sub-divide
Voluntarily dehumanized
Accruing misery
Perfecting slavery

Our anger subsides

No truth can be seen in any direction
Misled and deceived with no resolution
We thrive in our own complacent enjoyment
Bombarded by madness you cannot evade

[Lead: MÃ¼enzner, Elliott, Nelson]

Now imminent is the enslavement of mankind
Cannot believe in anything
Technological advancement hinders with time
Rest assured our faineancy will soon bring about this
Fall into our darkest days
As we witness the joy ripped from life
