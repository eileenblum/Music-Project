Grant us vengeance and nullify
These acts of treason that we despise
Restore balance far and wide
Their life-stock plummets as we occupy

As I look down on the world below
The streets are filled with bankrupt souls
Bodies falling from the sky
Life-long assets liquefied

For all that you want you're nothing to give
Our reason to hate a reason to live
No longer can you be bailed out
You can't enslave us!

We free ourselves of their control
Take back the freedom that they stole
Cast aside we cast you out
You can't enslave us!

I see a perfect world on percent incomplete
And now we purge ourselves of terror
Imperialistic genocide reanimates the monetized
Join us or live this lie

As they give back to the earth they stole
They pay the interest that they owe
Retribution from on high
On their deaths we capitalize

I see a perfect world on percent incomplete
And now we purge ourselves of terror
Imperialistic genocide reanimates the monetized
Join us or live this lie

Or maybe you always land on your feet?

[Solo: Nelson, Elliott]

As I look down on the world below
The sight of murder chills my soul
Bodies piling miles high
Will our history justify?

For all that you want you're nothing to give
Our reason to hate a reason to live
No longer can you be bailed out
You can't enslave us!

Freed us of their control
Give back the freedom that they stole
Severed the hand that handed out
Now what do we do?
