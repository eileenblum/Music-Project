Falling through dimensions
Once unknown until now
Existence spread like cracks upon a wall
Expanding over ages
Their imperfections slowly grew
And crumbled in the onset of eternity, eternally

These blinding streaks of light
Could they be our souls?
What do I wish to find
In these crystals made of gold?

The unraveling of the mind
I feel my body cold
But spiritually I'm alive
consciousness sustained by thought

Seeing such perfection
Magnified a millions times
Is when the faults we cannot see are shown
Firing in and out of our futile existence
Our energy is drifting through eternity, eternally

Devour the wisdom of the ancient ones
Devour the truth you can't touch
Devour the knowledge of eternities
Devour the essence of god

[Solo: Koelble]

Now returning to these shackles
Of my helpless human form
But haunted by the visions I now know
Shed this dying matter
And join the worlds of light
Reconstituted by the elements of eternity, eternally
