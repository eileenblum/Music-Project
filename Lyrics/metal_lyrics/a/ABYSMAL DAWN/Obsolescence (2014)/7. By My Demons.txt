The hatred within me, a gift I once revered
Grow now like a cancer on my soul
An unwelcome friend eviscerates the heart
Leaving a spirit withered and broken

I was torn apart by my demons
Now it's time for me to take control
I must rid myself of these demons
But do I want to let them go?

Reforged in fire and carved now into stone
A monument to obstacles overcome
Hurt the one you love and show you love yourself
This is all I've ever learned or known

I was torn apart by my demons
Now it's time for me to take control
I must rid myself of these demons
But do I want to let them go?

[Solo: Elliott]

Addicted to the cycle of this tumultuous life
Inspiring abundant tortured art
You know it's darkest right before the dawn
So bathe in eclipse and rope to be reborn

I was torn apart by my demons
Now it's time for me to take control
I must rid myself of these demons
But do I want to let them go?
