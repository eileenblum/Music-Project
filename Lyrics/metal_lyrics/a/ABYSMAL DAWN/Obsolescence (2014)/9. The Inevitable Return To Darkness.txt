A meteor rips clear across our skies
Bringing forth the death of all life
This distant traveler meets its journeys end
Bringing judgement as it swiftly descends

Wandering through these clouds made of ash
Struggling to maintain control
Mental capacities under collapse
Witnessing the final days of man

For all these years we reigned supreme
Returning now to celestial debris
The food chain collapses under vast scorched skies
This climate shift condemns us to die

Foraging through remnants of mankind
Scavenge the relics of our time
Retracing the footsteps of our past
Trying to salvage what is left

Balance is stricken from our mother Earth
Violence conceived our universe
So it will end as it began
Ready now for a second chance

This loneliness brought on by isolation
Maddens you to the point of craving death
Traumatized with no apparent destination
You soon pursue the only option you see left
The pain of life exceeding fear of death

Heading for this glowing luminescence 
Its gravity accretes a mass of churning souls
This single point is the origin of creation 
Itâs where it all began and where we shall return

Awakening as an enlightened apparition
Conscious of the truth once obscured from our view
Drifting from sordid realms of the living 
Aware of the purpose you subconsciously knew

Weâre all a disease
In an omnipresent being
A cancer inside of a god
Its defenses striking at us

Know that everything must serve a purpose even if that means to consume and destroy
And youâre a part of this infection; an agent of chaos on a quest to restore the darknessâ¦
