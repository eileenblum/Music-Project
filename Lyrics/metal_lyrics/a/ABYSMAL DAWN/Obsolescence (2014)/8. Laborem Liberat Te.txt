Dear friends
where have you
gone?
The silence
is very deafening
moments frozen in time
greet me
in blackest infinity
this burden has weighed a ton.
Embrace me
should I let go
crawling as we did at birth
bludgeoned by this mortal coil
one day closer
to our final breaths
and just when you have nothing left
they'll take that too.
Father I am your son
mother I am your everything
these veins run with your blood
I beg you don't leave me now

Crawling as we did at birth
bludgeoned by this mortal coil
one day closer to our final breaths
and just when you have nothing left
they'll take that too

If we endure the pain
brought by this barrage of torment
we'll see the things we love wither and die
vermin run in place
on a path unwinding
in a circle, a circle of lies
Coping with these stages of mortality
accepting the impermanence of being
stability, prosperity, longevity
futile notions and expenditures of time

Laborem Morte liberat te
We toil until our deaths
laborem morte liberat te
until freedom comes at last
this too shall pass in time
ride the winds into obscurity
hold fast to the things you love
they disappear once you turn around
things change until you don't belong
and it's true you can never go home

Crawling as we did at birth
bludgeoned by this mortal coil
one day closer to our final breaths
and just when you have nothing left
they'll take that too...
