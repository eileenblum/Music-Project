Like a hand of paper leaves
Stained from all the promises
That you never kept

All these dreams intensifying
That we dream
When will they come to something real?

But you go away
And you never stay
All these bitter years
That you leave me with

All these dreams intensifying
That we dream
When will they come to something real?
