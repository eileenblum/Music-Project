I don't want to fall in love anymore
I just want to avoid the pain
I don't want to be fooled again
I just want to avoid the pain

Stiff in my grasp through the endless embrace
Stroy goes on with no endless grace
Dark on my side, light is what I denied

Thank you for your body
Wasted time
Thank you for your secret
That will always be mine
