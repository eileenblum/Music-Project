Free like a bird
Crossing the sky
Just a dream

I want to be free
Just want to be free
I'm burning because of you
My light like fire
Without the flame
Can't you see?
Can't you see?

Please let me be free
Please let me be me

Can you forgive me
'Cause I can't
Crucified myself
And 'cause I destroyed all this
The dreams we made
