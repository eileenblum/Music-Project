I went down one day with you entwined
The hard rains of another April day
Pouring on us strange shades
Unravelling the story of your grace
Wishing we both stayed

I went down one day with you entwined
The hard rains of another April day

Take these tears and make them yours not mine
Lay me down besides you and make me shine
