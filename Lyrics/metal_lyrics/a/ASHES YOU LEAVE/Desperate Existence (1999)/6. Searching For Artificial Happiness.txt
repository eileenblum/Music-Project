I am burning for you, my life
Like a fire without the flames
I am smiling to you, my love
Like snow to the glowing sun
While sunrise sheds its golden blood
On fields of our hope
Colour of sorrow is our religion
We dream of our desired lover - death
The wind glorifies rusting leaves
Infinite time shines upon our hope
We are shadows of our own 
Light of fire
Guide me beyond my conscience
Death, take me into your life
