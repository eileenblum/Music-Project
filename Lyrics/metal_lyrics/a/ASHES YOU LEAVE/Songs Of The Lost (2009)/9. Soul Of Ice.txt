[Lyrics: Marko PetroviÄ / Music: Luka PetroviÄ and Marta BatiniÄ]

Soul of ice, soul of ice
Why rend my flesh, why burn my eyes
Feel cold within, see dark outside
No warmth can shed your paling light
Soul of ice, soul of ice
Why rend my flesh, why burn my eyes
Behold the pain, withstand the cries
Wretched slave of lies, soul of ice
