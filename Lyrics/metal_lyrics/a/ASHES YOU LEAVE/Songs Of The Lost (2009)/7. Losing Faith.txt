[Lyrics: Marko PetroviÄ and Marina ZriliÄ / Music: Berislav Poje]

I feel the way you look at me
You haunt me with fear
How proud and stupid can we be
To break off without a tear?

Deep in our hearts we know
That strangers we are
Deep in our hearts we know
That dying is not far

I never felt that way before
Your darkness drew me for more
You were my dark side of the moon
A misplaced note out of a tune

For you I laid there dying
My soul became so small
I am no longer trying
To feel somebody's love again
