[Lyrics: Marko PetroviÄ and Marina ZriliÄ / Music: Berislav Poje]

Your angels make me greedy
Your righteous light so bright
Are you ready for my evil taint
Can you resist my might

Let me take your hand and let the smouldering begin
Like grass under glass burning from within

There are no lies and there are no prayers
Your free world is your only care
There are no truths and there are no prayers
Your world will burn under my stare
