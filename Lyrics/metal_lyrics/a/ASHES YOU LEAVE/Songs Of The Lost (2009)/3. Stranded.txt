[Lyrics: Luka PetroviÄ / Music: Berislav Poje and Luka PetroviÄ]

(I feel) like a lonely ship on the open sea
The deep waters of sorrow are drowning me
My sails are broken and the waves are crushing me
My life is like a shipwreck how come this ever come to me?

I need someone
To save me from myself
And help me
find my way back home

The rains will stop pouring and the storms will cease
A new sun will rise, a new beginning for me
(I feel) like a lonely ship on the open sea
But the quiet shores of happiness are calling for me
