[lyrics: Marko PetroviÄ / Music: Berislav Poje]

Imagine me like a lie and offer me your smile
Discover my truth and you'll wish to die

The world isn't real, the illusion is strong
give me your hand and I'll show you how long

Take a bite and feast with me
The taste of sin will set you free
Take this gift to find your way
No need to kneel, no need to pray

You're welcome to this world of frailty
Or you can dream for a while in my reality

In my arms I hold your heart with blood running hot
Would you like to see the way it's going to rot?

Take a bite and feast with me
The taste of sin will set you free
Take this gift to find your way
No need to kneel, no need to pray
