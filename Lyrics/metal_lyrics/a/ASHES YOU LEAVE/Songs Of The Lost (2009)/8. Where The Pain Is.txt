[Lyrics: Marko PetroviÄ / Music: Berislav Boje]

Just beneath the surface a sinister realm is hidden
With failure, sadness and self-doubt is ridden
And here the impending shadow of all pain reigns
While the hand of weakness is the only one that gains

Dreams may come and dreams may go
But reality's always filled with woe
Do your best to live in bliss
But you'll find me where the pain is

Pain is a beast of darkness that survives on its own
Feeding on my defeats and emotional carrion
Sometimes so violent that I barely manage to see
That I have embraced it, it has become a part of me

Wherever you turn there is pain
You may fight it, but it's all in vain
Do your best to live in bliss
But I will be where the pain is
Always where the pain is
