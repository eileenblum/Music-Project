[Lyrics: Marko PetroviÄ / Music: Berislav Poje and Luka PetroviÄ]

How was I supposed to know
That a wounded soul would heal so slow
You needed love but love is dead
Ready to paint the world in red
Why did you ever let me see
The death in life and the death in me
The tears shall forever fall

Why do I find it so hard to breathe
And oh so easy to lie down and bleed
Drained of joy and left to rot in hell
There's nothing left but a soul to sell
Why did you ever let me see
The death in life and the death in me

Bring forth the tears caressing
My skin is pale and cold as ice
Bring forth the healing winds of time
This pain is both yours and mine

In silence waits the weapon cold
The key to freedom that I now hold
A dying reflection of a wasted life
My blood is ready to taste the knife
Why did you ever let me see
The death in life and the death in me

Bring forth the tears caressing
My skin is pale and cold as ice
Bring forth the healing winds of time
This pain is both yours and mine
