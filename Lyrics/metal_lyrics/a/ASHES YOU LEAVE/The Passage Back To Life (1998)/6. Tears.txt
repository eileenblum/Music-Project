Tears 
Like the mountains and the forests 
Endless rivers of red rose 
Your heaven is satanic poetry 
Your heaven is when I bleed 
Through the bleeding heaven 
Through the clouds of dying children 
Tears 
While my youth still lived and grew 
Horizon of wide sights 
Sadness only far away 
But where are you now distance... 
Blood of the holy body 
Are you here to hold me, to kiss me 
Go away you hurt me... 
With every sunrise, new sadness, new pain
