Bequeath the gift from the weeping skies
The sheer sight of it will burn your eyes
The raw primal power from the celestial portal
That will tear at souls of each and every mortal
Tender hearts will tremble, feeble minds will break
In a new Eonâs rise, this is Î§ÃOÎ£ awake

.... seeing is not believing

What we are seeing can be deceiving
Just like fire Î§ÃOÎ£ is ever-changing

...so start believing
...start living

And than you will see the future through my eyes
The world will become all that you despise
Creatures from the shadow of your mind will roam the earth
Weâll witness the downfall of your Eden and a modern Hellâs birth

But Iâll take pleasure in seeing you in that sad little world
Seeing you on your own
Squirming like a maggot in a wound
Iâll love to see you when you are all alone
