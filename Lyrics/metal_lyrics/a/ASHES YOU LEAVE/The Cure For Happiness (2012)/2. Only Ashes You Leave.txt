In the eyes of my soul-mate I gaze
But in front of a stranger now I stand
People say love is just like war
They always come to an end
We try to speak
But only silence we seem to utter
So motionless and silent we stand here
Like butterflies caught in butter

There are no feelings left
On this final eve
It has all been done and said
Only ashes you leave

Long has faded the sparkle in thy eye
You went down cold but so have I
Our years together just passed on by
All gone now, no more tears left to cry

We were never meant to be, this was only fate
Oppressive sorrow takes a leave, the funeral band is late
