Undress yourself beauty and lay before me
Reveal all your secrets to me, drive me into ecstasy
Kiss me, feel me, love me, embrace it all
In my sleep come to me and swallow me whole

Your lips spread poison
Your words reek of lies
Your caress is all but blessing
You are a Devil in disguise

I can't get you out of my mind, you're under my skin
Open your heart baby and welcome me in
Don't listen what other people say, embrace the sin
Open wide and invite me in

Your lips spew poison
Your words are venomous lies
In the end you're nothing but
A Devil in disguise
