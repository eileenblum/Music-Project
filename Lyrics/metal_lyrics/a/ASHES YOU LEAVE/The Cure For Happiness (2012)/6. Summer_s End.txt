Is this human nature
Are we designed this way
To be unhappy, so uncertain
To live in fear every day
Yet in the affairs of the heart we dwell naÃ¯ve
So childishly gullible and willing to forgive
And when weâre left with nothing but the choking pain
We hope it will be washed away by the autumn rain

If I could only
Find a reason to carry on
Not to remain lonely
When the burden inside weights a ton
Than I could only
Give this wretched life a try
Deny only
If you think this is a lie

You still linger and brood over your misery
But the only emotion you inspire is sympathy

So play me a mellow tune
Give me a darker rhyme
Letâs make this a sad one
This is a lovelorn time

Summers end...

We were nothing but actors
In this nightmare play
The trees are removing their cloaks
The autumn is here to stay

Summers end...
