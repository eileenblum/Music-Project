In these wastelands of emotions we all strive to find
Someone for our heart, soul and mind
A poet writes of a tale so drear
To grow old alone we all dread and fear

And out of nothing comes a love so dire
I feel it burning my skin like fire
My heart feels wrapped in barbed wire
But what a sweet, sweet desire

So come all the shadows from one's past
To haunt a lonely heart with a love so vast
As the fiddler plays a dreadful theme
A godlike apparition comes to fulfill the dream
