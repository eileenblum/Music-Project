Are you sure you want to let go
Are you ready to loose it all
Were we always meant to stumble and than fall
And wait for life to take itâs toll

It is the slow turning of the cosmic wheel
that hurts, that aches and prevents you to heal

The stars burned bright to light our way
But never so were we meant to stray
And though bliss seemed just a heartbeat away
Love will have to wait for another day

We were meant to stray, meant to stray..
Now leave...

You could have saved me, no-one else tried
You did fail me as the lovers died
And when all our failures are summarized
There is nothing left to remember us by

The stars burned bright to light our way
But never so were we meant to stray
And though bliss seemed just a heartbeat away
Love will have to wait for another day
Just like for grass in a gentile sway
A wind will come and blow all the pain away
