Guilt haunted,
Hate driven
All those promises so lightly given

Grief crippled
And heartbroken
Vicious lies so often spoken

We struggle
With each day
But mankind silently fades away

So greet a reality sad cast in pain and sorrow
Kindness seems pointless when no-one cares to follow
The last few tears I cry for a world with no tomorrow
Emotions are long lost, stares so distant and hollow

In this wretched
Human spawning
You sought humanity

So bitter
Was the truth
So cruel the reality

We all just fade awayâ¦.
