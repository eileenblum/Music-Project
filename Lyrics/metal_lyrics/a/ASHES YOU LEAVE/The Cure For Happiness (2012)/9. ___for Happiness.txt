Behind those green eyes hides a lady fair 
Nor among angels or demons could you find her a pair 
More and more she drove me deeper into madness 
I couldn't see it than â I am addicted to sadness 

You can't break a broken heart, my dear 
Still your heart I can't even shed a tear 
You cant even hurt a broken man 
Even if I wanted I couldn't be whole again 

I never felt passion 
So sinful and yet so pure 
Help me to find a remedy 
Help me to find a cure 

I am the brooding incarnated sadness 
Standing on the edge of sanity I am the cure for happiness
