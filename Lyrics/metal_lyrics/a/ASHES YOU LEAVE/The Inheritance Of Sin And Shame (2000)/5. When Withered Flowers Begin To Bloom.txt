I look upon the lightless sky
With drops of sadness from my mourning eye
I only heard the reckless waters roar
Those ways could not bear me from the shore

When Withered Flowers Begin To Bloom

She loved to dwell in darkness and dismay
Deeming herself predestined to do

When withered flowers begin to bloom
I want to remain unseen in the shadow of her mind
