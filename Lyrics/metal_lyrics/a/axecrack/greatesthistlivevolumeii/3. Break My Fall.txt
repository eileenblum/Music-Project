[words: Jason Raines]

I - I never thought I'd see this day
And I - I never thought I'd be the one
My life has taken on this path
And I'm on the run
I - I opened up my weary eyes
And I - I opened up both barrels wide
Instead of turning from a fight
The law has come to end my life
Runnin' - Till I find the one
Ridin' - Vengeance is done
They've taken everything from me
Killin' - Blood on my hands
Dyin' - Their laws be damned
They may kill me but my soul is free
Livin' on the edge of the hangman's ledge
Looking out upon you all
Never gotta think about falling down
Cause the noose is gonna break my neck
When it breaks my fall
I - I listen to the wind that screams
And I - I hear it in my waking dreams
The voices calling out to me
But I can't believe
I - I'm just a man without a name
And I - I ride across these empty plains
Always searching for the ones I lost
And there is no reprieve
Runnin' - Till I find the one
Ridin' - Vengeance is done
They've taken everything from me
Killin' - Blood on my hands
Dyin' - Their souls be damned
Take my life but leave my conscience be
Livin' on the edge of the hangman's ledge
Looking out upon you all
Never gotta think about falling down
Cause the noose is gonna break my neck
When it breaks my...
Livin' on the edge of the hangman's ledge
Looking out upon you all
Never gotta think about falling down
Cause the noose is gonna break my neck
When it breaks my...
Livin' on the edge of the hangman's ledge
Looking out upon you all
Never gotta think about falling down
Cause the noose is gonna break my neck
When it breaks my fall
