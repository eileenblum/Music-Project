[words: Jason Raines]

Endless betrayal and devious cries
Open your mouth and then honesty dies
Bullshit just flows from your head in a flood
Lost in denial and dripping in blood
I have a thought - a small suggestion
Your mental rot - the burning question
Liar - you have nowhere to turn now and no one is listening
Liar - your insincere, spiteful deceptions are done
Actions speak louder than words made of knives
Spitting and hissing and taking down lives
Truth is a virus and you're the vaccine
Lost in your violent pathetic machine
I have a thought - a small suggestion
Your mental rot - a simple question
Your soul has died - and you don't fear it
Your fucking lie - don't wanna hear it
Liar - you have nowhere to turn now and no one is listening
Liar - your insincere, spiteful deceptions are done
Liar - you have nowhere to turn now and no one is listening
Liar - your insincere, spiteful deceptions are done
(Open your mouth and then...)
(Bullshit just flows from your...)
(Lost in denial and...)
Liar - you have nowhere to turn now and no one is listening
Liar - your insincere, spiteful deceptions are done
Liar - you have nowhere to turn now and no one is listening
Liar - why don't you sit there and just fucking die
