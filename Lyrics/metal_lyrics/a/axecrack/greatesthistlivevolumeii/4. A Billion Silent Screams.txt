[words: Jason Raines]

This is the era of misinformation (I am lost)
This is a world without human connection (at what cost)
Digital lives are devoid of all meaning (close your eyes)
Emptiness causing a soulless machining (feed the lies)
Hear it callin' - Answer your master's cry
Instant immediate gratification (here and now)
Justifies digital intimidation (not allowed)
Memetically programmed our indoctrination (close your mind)
Unethical error is user damnation (end of line)
Hear it callin' - Answer your master's cry
We have fallen - Dance of a life denied
I can not hear you anymore (these mindless dreams)
Your voice is lose within a billion silent screams
Hidden in pixels the weak lust for power (no more games)
A haven for every anonymous coward (no more names)
Corrupting our moral and ethical system (I, me, mine)
Denying our god-given right to resist 'em (feelin' fine)
Hear it callin' - Answer your master's cry
We have fallen - Dance of a life denied
I can not hear you anymore (these mindless dreams)
Your voice is lose within a billion silent screams
Hear it callin' - Answer your master's cry
We have fallen - Dance of a life denied
I can not hear you anymore (these mindless dreams)
Your voice is lose within a billion silent screams
I can not hear you anymore (these mindless dreams)
Your voice is lose within a billion silent screams
