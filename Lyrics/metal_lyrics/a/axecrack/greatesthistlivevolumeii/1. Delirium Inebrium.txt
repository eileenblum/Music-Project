[words: Jason Raines]

Can you feel us pierce your skin
Can you see our dark device
Will you let us taste your sins
Emptiness comes at a price
Will you open up your veins
And spill your faded tears
Can you keep yourself insane
In a world built from your fears
(Descent) I can taste your hesitation
(Torment) I can feel your trepidation
(Repent) I can see your fascination
(Lament) But you will not see mine
I am the master of your flesh
I am the Hellbound Heart
I'll show you such amazing sights
And I'll tear your soul apart
You have called and I am here
The puzzle holds the key
Suffering and black desire
Agony will set you free
What a lovely game we play
Our puppetry sublime
May I slip within your flesh
This anguished pantomime
(Descent) I can taste your hesitation
(Torment) I can feel your trepidation
(Repent) I can see your fascination
(Lament) But you will not see mine
I am the master of your flesh
I am the Hellbound Heart
I'll show you such amazing sights
And I'll tear your soul apart
I am the master of your flesh
I am the Hellbound Heart
I'll show you such amazing sights
And I'll tear your soul apart
Descent
Torment
Repent
Lament
