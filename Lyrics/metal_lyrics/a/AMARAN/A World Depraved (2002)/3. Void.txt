Feel under my skin, these shivers run deeper than before
See it is so real, now my heart beats faster can you feel it

Longing for the sun, to bring it back to me once again
To eat it out the dark the pain
Longing for the sun, I want to be free from this void, rid of this void

This void is pain

See it is so wrong, the dark is getting darker, so hard to see
Feel empathy, the art is so much harder than it seems
