Maybe it's the sound of pouring rain that we love
Maybe it's the sound of running water

I like the way that it feels on my skin, keep pouring
What's your war about anyway
A little victory over me
A little victory over me to tear me down

Tear me down, rip me open, break me down

This is a little victory

Never try to make you happy
Never fail to make you cry

Don't close your righteous eyes, keep preaching
You're not the only one anyway
To try and change me into you
While I'm the one in power to tear you down

Tear you down, rip you open, break you down
