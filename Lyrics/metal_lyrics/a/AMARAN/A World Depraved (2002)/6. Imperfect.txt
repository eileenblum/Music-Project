It's not easy to avoid who we ought to be
We're sighing then we're dying

We're only human with our eyes closed
We're only children of the sun
Maybe we have forgotten or maybe it has always been like this
Maybe we have forgotten that this machine kills

Are busy sighing, then you're truly dying
Do you still pretend to hear the angels cry
Are you still suffering or is it okay now
I can't believe this one track mind
Emancipation is a two-edged sword
This is not what I call freedom

Imperfect

Come a little closer, little closer
Hear me plead

Have you seen the first dawn of a new tomorrow
Do you still pretend to stand branded by the light
Now we're still suffering and it ain't okay at all
I can't believe we're so small
Still not what I would call freedom
