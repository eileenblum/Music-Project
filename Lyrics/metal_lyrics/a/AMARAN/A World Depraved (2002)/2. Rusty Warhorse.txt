See this rusty warhorse, so worn out and old
Once so gallant now so pale, can you help us anymore
Once proud in harness, now proud in vain
Now restrained we welcome you
Can you save us anymore

See this rusty warhorse, it's our new warrior
A new born king, a shiny warrior
Rectify until it's sane
Rusty warhorse proud in vain
Dead old creed it won't decay
Shiny warrior

Still this rusty warhorse, fighting for its life
You better believe it, you better watch out, or you'll be surprised
Old rusty warhorse won't you hear me please
If I set you free and let you go
Will you leave us alone
