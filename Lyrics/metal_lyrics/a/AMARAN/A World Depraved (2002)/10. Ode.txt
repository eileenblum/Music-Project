The morning come not a day too soon
Wishing all the best to all that's gone

See these changes in my life
The torn away pain, is replaced by new meaning
An odd new feeling of changing it all

Only you who reach so deep down inside
Only you will know my name

It was you who said run to me

See this chaos in my life
Like washed away sand
Still they're turning to face me and dogfaced they rate me
They're charged with sin

Waiting, calling, riding, stalling
Rise to perfection, an ode to you

Watch me rise, right before your eyes
I am all, that you knew that I could be
The doubt it gone won't leave you standing all alone
