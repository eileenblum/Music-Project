Here we are again, though we lost our mother's love
Hear me, touch me, feel me, hold me, I am so alone
Never will I know when it's over, maybe it's over now
Is it too late to turn around

We run away, true perfection in the eyes of the world
We run away, one step closer every day

It still keeps happening
The karma in flesh

We're so much closer now, we keep telling ourselves
It makes us whole or hollow

It takes a lot of pain when it's all becoming clear
All the time you thought you saved is gone forever
Do you ever think it will all start when you want it to
But it's too late to turn around
