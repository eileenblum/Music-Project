I wanted it all, but couldn't get it all under control
Didn't realize how much I could lose this way
I'm cleansing my soul in the light, trying to get innocent
Will you lead me straight, or will I lose my faith

Faith, without faith, I will fail, without faith

Carved out of flesh, this is who you made
I have come to find I was never on my own
I'm trying too hard to claim originality
Still I'm no one new, I'm just like you

I always wanted it to be something different
I never wanted to be something other than me

Now it's come to this and I've not proved wiser than before
Neverending struggles wear different faces

The higher I climb, the harder I fall
And I've never found a way to break down softly
But the stars explode and help me reach the other side
That takes me from, what I've become
