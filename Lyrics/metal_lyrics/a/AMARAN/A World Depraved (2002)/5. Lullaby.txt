When we're in the final row, what direction will we go
I once was blind, but now I see this misery
How could this beso wrong when the desire is so strong
He's been wanting he's been wanting for too long

Good night sweet child, sleep for a while
Rest as I sing you a lullaby

A little angel came to life he smiled and turned away
This is no place for me, no place for innocence

And the demons come at night to feast on every beam of light
But don't be scared it's just a bad, bad dream or so it seems
