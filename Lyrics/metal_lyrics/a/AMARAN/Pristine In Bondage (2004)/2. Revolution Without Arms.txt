John Doe, the answer to my prayers
Won't you come alive in
the picture that I painted

Moon and stars won't
you come to my rescue
Let me enslave you, owning
you will make me whole
Green leaves won't you
gather around me
Keep me company
and I'll never beg again

Choose your revolution...

Without arms
We've got a war to fight
Can't you see?

My knight trapped
in shining armor
Take me far away,
I know that you are real.
