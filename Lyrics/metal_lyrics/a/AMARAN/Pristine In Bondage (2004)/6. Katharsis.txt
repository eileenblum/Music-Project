You smothered my beliefs to the point
of nearly killing me
When you gave me a name
to carry with shame
Show me mother, I've reached
the point where I'm supposed to say
Teach me again father,
yet for some reason I am still waiting!

Cast away now. Cut the moorings
I've lived through the resurrection
and can somehow say
I'm on my way now, any day now
Urged by my Katharsis

In my world there's no bitterness
I'm touched in more than one way,
so natural, so beautiful!!!
In my past world it was you who...
You who triggered me...

We need a burst of chaos
to become clean and purified
Neurotic cleansing disorder cease to be
Venting emotions, my demons are alive
Spiritual renewal, come come Katharsis
