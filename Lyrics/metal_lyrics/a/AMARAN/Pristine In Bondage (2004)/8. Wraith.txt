He held me so tight as if to protect me
From what? Maybe from himself
I signed the contract that
offers me protection
If I follow all the rules

See those wounds and bruises
don't really prove much
Some girls like it rough
Some mean yes when they say no
How is a man supposed to know?

You came just as you saw Marilyn
As if I wasn't there at all
As if I was only a dream

And you are my little angel but
your wings are without use
Cause you picked out all the feathers
To draw a little blood just to make sure
That you can bleed like if you where alive

A train from heaven where
we are the only passengers
Without their eyes shooting
out lightning of dirt
That penetrates our skin
And heads straight for our hearts

You are my little angel
High upon my pedestal
Yea, you are my little angel
God help man if you would fall
