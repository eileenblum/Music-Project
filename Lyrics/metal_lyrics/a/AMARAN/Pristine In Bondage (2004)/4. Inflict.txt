All of my nightmares you
leave me sleeping
Weighing my eyes down,
everything's fading

In the gutter of my mind
I found my hero
See I actually believed
in such a thing as a hero
And I crawled on my knees
just to please you
I'm just like all the rest, the second best
The one who takes what she can get

From where you're standing
I never suffer
Made of concrete I am breathless
You must've confused
me with someone else
Someone who settles for
being someone's whore
Someone more like yourself

And all the nightmares that I have
You own my awakening
But you leave me sleeping on
Enjoying the thrill of my scream
