If I was brave I'd shut my mouth
Put an end to our fights
I'd jump into a neon light
Taste the concrete and break my bones
I could be born again
As one of your lucky strikes

If I wouldn't fuck up my
mind from time to time...
Constantly, I would drive myself insane

I was always the December girl
I never noticed them at all
I slept through the summer
And was drunk through the fall

I am beautiful in the dark
Everyone can be beautiful
in the spotlight
From far below
All the praise falls to the floor
I stand empty handed
waiting for a little more

I pop 24 pills a day, 8 with every meal
Just to make it to the next place
