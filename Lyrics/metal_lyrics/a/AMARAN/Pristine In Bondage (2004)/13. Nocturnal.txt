[japanese bonus track]

These bodies all contain your souls
and are lighten by your lives
Molded to oblivion
to hard to see the truth

Have I told you,
it is not over yet
Have I told you,
This is just the beginning

Where did some go
to walk here again
Where is this life
to live here again

Close your eyes
and come with me
to find another way
A parallel universe
created by ourselves

Wanted something real
but I only closed wind in these skies
Wanted a deeper meaning
but I only found our empty shells
