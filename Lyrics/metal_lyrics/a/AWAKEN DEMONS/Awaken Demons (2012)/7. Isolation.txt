I satnd alone
We're still running
Over time and far away
We've lost our days
The days of grace and misery
I don't need anyone
To find out we're sinking to hell
Black flames on everyone
Can't you see whre you're going?
Too many things are changing
And people never change
Can i trust you anymore?
Well no
We're still running
Over time and far away
We've lost our days
The days of grace and misery
Turned into ashes
Memories are faded away
So i stand alone
Cause i don't care anymore
I don't care anymore
