They believed in your power
They believed in you
Over the power
I feel your intentions
We're slaves of the injustice
The fall of a nation
Death to all pledges
The dummy's resumption
Faith and corruption
I'm starved of destruction
We're back to take the crown
I've believed in a flag
They belived to your lies
Now it's time to dance
And take our future back
For myself or for the thousands
I'll scream my frustration
Against faith and corruption
My freedom is on check mate
(My freedom is much more)
They believed in your power
They believed in you
Now it's time to dance
And take the crown
