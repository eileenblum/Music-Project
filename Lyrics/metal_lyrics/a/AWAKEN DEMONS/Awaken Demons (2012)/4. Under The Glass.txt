You said nothing
Every moment
Every minute
Every hour
Was a mistake
Everything was just perfect
Everything seemed already done
But what i want now
Is nothing but to see you sad
You destroyed me
And i didn't deserve it
Fuck you
You deserve the worst
What a fool been i
I remeber the day i've cried in front of you
Begging for another day another night in hell
No warmth in your eyes, tellin me the truth
The fall, bitter tears of a broken hearted
Every moment
Every minute
Every hour
Was a mistake
You said it would be forever
You said nothing
You destroyed me
You destroyed everything
For you i've met my enemies
For you i've buried everything
For you
