The time has come for me
Something tht i can't explain
Has raised inside of me
It's something more of being sick
It's me against the machine
I can't stand here
Waiting for something more
I'm so sick of punching the wall
I think i'm going to fuckin escape from here
And i say goodbye
No wonder why
I say goodbye
I'll be alive
Their noises wreck my head
Their voices are the endÂ 
Many times i hold their hands
Fuck me, never again
I'm sick of punchin the walls
I'll give vent to my blood
I say goodbye
Time has come for me
I'll be alive
No wonder why
Time has come for me
Time to say goodbye
