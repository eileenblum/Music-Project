What do you think now?
Sometimes i think there's nothing going wrong
(I feel alone)
And i feel alone
Lonely without a soul
Trapped in the hole
Now i understand
I am the phoenix
Burning my desires, waking my dreams
Waiting and yelling till i'll rise again
They gather
They guard
They cure
Through the cage
What do you think now?
Sometimes i think there's nothing going on
(Nothing for all)
But my fire wings still burn
Your eyes cannot shove
My herat in the hole
What do you think now?
Sometimes i feeli like i'm nit alone
(Alone anymore)
And my fire wings still burn
My eyes can now show
My heart in gold
I will fight everyday
Till i will rise again
