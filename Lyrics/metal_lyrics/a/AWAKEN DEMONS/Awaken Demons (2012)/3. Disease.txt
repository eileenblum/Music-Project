Don't stop me now
Ain't time to rest
Cause their spoken knives
Are away to hit and kill
And we're next
Aim to the chest
All the lies
And my rage rises
Does it make proud of you?
To all these stupid wannabes fuck off
Say with me fuck off
They're all part of the disease fuck off
Say with me fuck off
And now you're gonna feel it
Just inside i'm gonna beat it
We're all part of this disease
Can you stop it now?
