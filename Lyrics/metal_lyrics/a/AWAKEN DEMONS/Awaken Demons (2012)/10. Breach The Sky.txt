Do you remeber
That you're still in my heart?
There are no words to say
And whispers inside me
Memories of you in grey
I know we're nothing
But ashes till the end
I'm not afraid of dark
I know you're keeping me
I'm feelingthe sky on the ground
I'm runnging away, off the bounds
Do you remember
That you're still in my heart?
For all things
We never share yet
I didn't give up
Waiting for
