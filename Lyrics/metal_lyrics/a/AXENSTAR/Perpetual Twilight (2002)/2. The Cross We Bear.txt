[M &amp; L: Thomas Eriksson]

Take the time to realize what we have done
We're standing on the edge of desperation
We've been blind by staring right into the burning sun
Yet pray to Heaven's might for our salvation

[BRIDGE]
It seems we've used up all her trust
We burned our bridges and turned our future to dust

[CHORUS]
Bring me back to the times, back when the future looked good
Finding signs of the cross, we probably would
Let me stand on the shore, breathe in the fresh magic air
We fear that it's too late but that's the cross we bear

Sowing seeds of pure minstreat we cannot take
Our children reap the harvest in another day
She just fades away unless we try to put an end to this disease
And bring the lost disciples right down to their kness

Don't let us leave it all behind
A war for all mankind
Oh can't you see, tomorrow is our destiny
