[M &amp; L: Thomas Eriksson]

Far away from twilight I'm searching for my soul
But still I can't find what I've journeyed for
All the distant places I've passed along my way
They seem to be fading with the remnants of the day

[BRIDGE]
See me now with the tears in my eyes
Hear my sight as I reach out for the light

[CHORUS]
So conquer the world in the afterlife
Peace now for my soul
A new revelation has just begun
Secrets left untold

Crossed the fields of sadness and oceans of true love
Now I enter the realm of the dark beyond
Embraced within the powers I've longed for all these years
Redemption must be close at hand to wash away my fears

[CHORUS]
So conquer the world in the afterlife
Peace now for my soul
A new revelation has just begun
Secrets soon I know

Fire in my eyes, I feel the pain inside that's ripping in my entity
Do I believe what I see?
And so many times I have failed to pass this test of faith
But now it's my turn, the rest of the world shall burn!

Far away from twilight you're searching for your soul
But still you can't find what you've journeyed for?
When you're on that journey just like me some times ago
Remember what the wise men said: "Go, follow your heart all the way!"

[BRIDGE]
See me now with the tears in my eyes
Hear my cry to the sky as I reach out for the light

[CHORUS]
So conquer the world in the afterlife
Peace now for my soul
A new revelation has just begun
Secrets now I know
