[M &amp; L: Thomas Eriksson]

You thought you knew what I was all about
A smile on your face but you're drowning in lies
You stole my heaven and put me through hell
One of us must go down, Well I'm not the one

[BRIDGE]
They try to push me over the edge
But you know in the end they failed
I'll live my life until it's over

[CHORUS]
You have not lived the life I've lived
Your words couldn't mean a thing
Don't care what you think, keep it to yourself
And let me be all I could ever be

Although you try you cannot bring me down
I'm free in my will and I bow down to none
You sinful ways must now come to an end
I am the one of a kind and I'll never die
