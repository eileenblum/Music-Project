Has this all been done before
Walking down this cold and lonesome road
Where dreams are forgotten

So I walk further down the line
Reach the point W here there's no turning back
Can't hold on any longer

The life you strive to live
Is just an empty illusion
Forever a blatant lie
Cause we're all gonna die

Time has come for me to carry on
One step forward into the unknown
It's a bittersweet farewell

Alone in bed gasping for air
Forced to relive the past
Every second of my life

Flashing memories right before my eyes
I pray for the end to come soon
Silently it covers me

The life you strive to live
Is just an empty illusion
Forever a blatant lie
Cause we're all gonna die

Time has come for me to carry on
One step forward into the unknown
It's a bittersweet farewell
