For years I've been walking here all alone
Wondering where you are
Eyes wide open searching everywhere
Not a sign, nor some evidence

When the lights go out
I am left all alone with the moon in the sky
When the cold gets a grip of the night
I return back home

Will you ever find the way?
Will you come here to stay?
Do you think that I'll ever be found?
Would you ever bleed for me?
Do you remember me?
Maybe I'm just a shadow that's left behind

Alone I've been walking around in the dark
It seems like an eternity
Wishing you were still here by my side
Together forever

When the lights go out
I am left all alone with the moon in the sky
When the cold gets a grip of the night
I return back home

Will you ever find the way?
Will you come here to stay?
Do you think that I'll ever be found?
Would you ever bleed for me?
Do you remember me?
Maybe I'm just a shadow that's left...

When the lights go out
I am left all alone with the moon in the sky
When the cold gets a grip of the night
I return back home

Will you ever find the way?
Will you come here to stay?
Do you think that I'll ever be found?
Would you ever bleed for me?
Do you remember me?
Maybe I'm just a shadow that's left...
Shadow that's left behind
