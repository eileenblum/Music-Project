Everyday I been living this lie
I let my life just fade away
Some days I even think about ending it all

For reasons unknown to me
I never seem to find my peace
Conspiring, delusional thoughts stranded in me

Another day, another way, another life
Another chance to realize my sacrifice

Once again I've been forced to find
The strength to carry on
But in time it only seems to be bringing me down

Through fire I walk the line
Between joy and misery
Cold desire a strange longing for death

Another day, another way, another life
Another chance to realize my sacrifice
