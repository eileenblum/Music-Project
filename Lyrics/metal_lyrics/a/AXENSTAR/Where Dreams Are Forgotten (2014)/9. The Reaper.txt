From the first breath when a man is born
He's destined to follow the path from before
The only truth that applies to all life
Without exceptions no one survives

Life as you know it will then fade away
Leading you fast to a final decay
Harsh and relentless the years pass you by
Like seasons are changing you wither and die

Somewhere far away you hear him coming
And you know your time is up
When death comes knocking on your door

All through life's phases you struggle to find
A purpose, a meaning it all seems entwined
Forever leaving the loved ones behind
A faded memory still in your mind

Somewhere far away you hear him coming
And you know your time is up
When the reaper is calling
Somewhere far away you hear him coming
And you know your time is up
When death comes knocking on your door
