I rule the day, I rule the night
I will decide if you live or die
I'm not another ordinary man

I hold the powers in my hand
My reign is all across the land
I do not fear any mortal man

Through the wasted endless nights
Through a lifetime of sorrow
When the final curtain falls
I'll be there to watch your demise

I was born inside your mind
Certainly one of a kind
Made up to serve as the other one

There's no boundaries to hold me back
I'm constantly on the attack
I fear there's nowhere left for me to run

Through the wasted endless nights
Through a lifetime of sorrow
When the final curtain falls
I'll be there to watch your demise

I woke up from a dream
I thought I'd died and been reborn
But then my senses became clear
And I realized that nothing had changed
Nothing at all, I'm still here in this human form
With no place left for me to call home

Through the wasted endless nights
Through a lifetime of sorrow
When the final curtain falls
I'll be there to watch your demise
