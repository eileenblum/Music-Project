I saw her one day long ago, in the mist of the morning
Her eyes were glowing full of life, a kiss was all she asked for

Now I'm bound to obey her
Trapped forever in this maze I'm held
I can hear her whisper in my mind
But I never understand a word she says...

Take me away I'm longing for life
I'm crying out from my tortured soul
I can't believe this has happened to me
Trying to escape this endless void

It seems like a lifetime I spent, just wanting to leave this place
I'm trying so hard to find the strength, afraid I can never leave her

Now I'm bound to obey her
Trapped forever in this maze I'm held
I can hear her whisper in my mind
But I never understand a word she says...

Take me away I'm longing for life
I'm crying out from my tortured soul
I can't believe this has happened to me
Trying to escape this endless void

So many nights I watched her die
I've seen the horror in her eyes
Too many nights I screamed in vain
But it just goes on and on and on again

I saw her that long ago, in the mist of the morning
Her eyes were glowing full of fire, a kiss was all she asked for

Now I'm bound to obey her...
