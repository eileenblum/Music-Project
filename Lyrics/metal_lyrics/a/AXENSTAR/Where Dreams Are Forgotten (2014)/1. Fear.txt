Night will come and swallow the sun
In the dark the feast has begun
We deny the creatures are real
Show them your fear and you have to kneel

Time after time
Night after night

As years go by we're always one step behind
We'll never find the missing pieces to our dreams
Beyond the grave there is no promise of peace
Behold a life free from pain and misery

Moving fast across the floor
Shadows appear on your bedroom door
Scraping sounds from inside the wall
Terror strikes will you answer the call

Time after time
Night after night

As years go by we're always one step behind
We'll never find the missing pieces to our dreams
Beyond the grave there is no promise of peace
Behold a life free from pain and misery

Time after time
Night after night

As years go by we're always one step behind
We'll never find the missing pieces to our dreams
Beyond the grave there is no promise of peace
Behold a life free from pain and misery
