Been sleeping far too long
I haven't seen the changing horizon
But now the time has come
To defend my home my nation

Awakened by the sound
Of a thousand soldiers marching
The footsteps pounding the ground
In the land that once was mine

The silent winds of change
Are sweeping across my land
Creeping up from behind
And destroying from within

Infectious like a disease
The new order has no meaning
No reason to believe
That they have come in peace

For the ones we've lost were still counting the cost
And suffer in this living nightmare
To save yourself never count on someone else
You hold the key to your own destiny

With the blood of my own brothers on my hands
I will fight 'til the last enemy fall
Over and over, again and again
Until the day when victory is won!

For the ones we've lost we're still counting the cost
And suffer in this living nightmare
To save yourself never count on someone else
You hold the key to your own destiny
