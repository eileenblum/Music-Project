Remember the times when you were young
And you thought you'd live forever
But the times have changed
And death will catch you in the end

At night when you're lying in your bed
He'll be right there beside you
In silence, patiently waiting to steal away your soul

The clock is close to midnight
Beware he's coming to get you
Was this all that I got?
Is this the end?

Run fur your life you better save yourself
If tomorrow never comes then live for today
We all need to find the reason to our lives
Before we close our eyes forever

You try to turn your back on the past
The memories will always find you
The scars are forever hidden so deep down inside

But know that you never can break free
For this is what you been chosen for
To lead us through pain
And struggle to reach the other shore

The clock is close to midnight
Beware he's coming to get you
Was this all that I got?
Is this the end?

Run for your life you better save yourself
If tomorrow never comes then live for today
We all need to find the reason to our lives
Before we close our eyes forever
