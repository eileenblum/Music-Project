The sirens break the silence, in the dead of night
The bombs filling the air, raining down everywhere
Run fast to the shelters, the only way to survive
Peace is no more, the war is at the door

We - Stand our ground
We - Won't back down

To hell and back we fight our way
Through the war, through the pain until no one will remain
To hell and back we find our way
No remorse no regrets we stay strong and fight 'til death

Strike back hard and fast, do the best you can
For every man that falls another one heed the call
Gathering strength from memories the past is the key
For us to unite to stand up and fight

We - Stand our ground
We - Won't back down

To hell and back we fight our way
Through the war, through the pain until no one will remain
To hell and back we find our way
No remorse no regrets we stay strong and fight 'til death

The guilt that's on our hands can't be washed away
Not tomorrow nor today the sins of yesterday

To hell and back...

The forces that will guide us soon lead us astray
What will we gain, pleasure or pain
We never ever fall, we never forget
The time has come to choose will you win or will you lose

We...
