[M: T. Eriksson, L: P. Johansson]

You have shown me the stars tonight
Yet I can still see shadows in the light
Dimensions of time are hidden in the sky
The stars are falling I'm always wondering why

The wind of ice has embraced my soul
Before you I will never fall
I can take you through the pain and sadness
As we're running from rage and madness

[BRIDGE]
Beyond the sky in the dead of the night
Candles are burning, stars of returning
Lightning strikes again

[CHORUS]
Now I am far from heaven far from the light
Sent from the darkest lands death on black wings
Found my heaven deep in the night
Riding through the clouds to the sleeping kings

How many seasons can I gather in my land
I come from hell with might in my hand
But I will my poisoned tears ever bleed at all for you
My journey from heaven to hell is true

Now the time has come for you to fall
In the end you won't see me at all
Alone in this cold world we'll be
Fighting me as I was your own enemy
