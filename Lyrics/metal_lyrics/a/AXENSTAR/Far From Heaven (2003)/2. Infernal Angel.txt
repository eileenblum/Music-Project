[M and L: T. Eriksson]

Born from the sun in an unholy bond
Between night and the day the creator has failed
Blessed by the light and cursed by the dark
This unification will soon leave it's mark

Banished from heaven and cast down to hell
Where the souls of the damned forever shall dwell
Baptized in blood and forge in the fire
Leading the way to the funeral pyre

[BRIDGE]
Her beauty withered away, revealed a smile of decay
A thousand screams of the unborn children remains

[CHORUS]
She came from the stars angel from far beyond
A creature without control, spewing her death upon us all
See, she spreads her wings turning the sky to black
Resistance is overthrown there's no turning back
