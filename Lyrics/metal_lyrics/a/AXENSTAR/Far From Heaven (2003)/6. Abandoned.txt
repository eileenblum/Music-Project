[M and L: T. Eriksson]

I gaze at the moon and it's staring back at me
I wonder if she could ever feel the pain I feel
Alone now I stand, is this the beginning of the end
I'm not quite so sure what all this sorrow was meant for

[BRIDGE]
All on my own the reaper has come to take you away
In sickness and health, the grief that I felt, I want you to know

Consumed by the pain
I'm felt here standing in the rain (by your grave)
Betrayed by our fate all that's left in me is hate
Now it seems to me, our lives a fading memory
I no longer know the reason for me to live on

[CHORUS]
Longing for that knock on the door
Longing for that knock on the door
