[M: T. Eriksson, L: P. Johansson]

[CHORUS]
Don't hide your eyes from the mystical lies
Don't run away when it's better to stay
Keep on your fight don't stop until it's right
Dreams are never die so don't hide your eyes

Can we answers the questions of a child
Can we somehow explain why the freedom is no wild
Can we only dream in black and white
Can't turn our backs against this fight

[BRIDGE]
We must learn the golden rule
Not see through the eyes of the fool

So many times you've said "don't you worry"
But the nightmare is back you should be sorry
In the nightmare it seems you're sleeping well
But outside your door there are millions who live in hell

Life's just a great mystery
Don't forget your own history
Why can't we just understand
No one there to take your hand
