[M and L: T. Eriksson]

What would you say if I threw it all away
The life that I lead could it be more surreal

[BRIDGE]
Searching in my mind in the order to find some sense of reality
I fear that I am beginning to lose what's left of my sanity

Awake again full of bloodstains on my hands
I wonder where I have been whose death I have foreseen

Breaking my will with the purpose to kill all shreds of humanity
To lose the control of body and soul is my main anxiety

[CHORUS]
Something's coming over me my reality slowly slipping away
I just can't remember but can't seem to forget
Who I am blacked out again

Can't longer say what is real and what is a dream
The demon is rising up from far deep down within

I have fallen into the depths of sin
Where the humanity ends and pain begins
Breaking free from this torment I must do
If I told you my secret, oh would you believe it's true
