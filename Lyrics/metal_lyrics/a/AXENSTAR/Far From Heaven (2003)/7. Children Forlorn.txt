[M and L: T. Eriksson]

Welcome to this tortured place of life
Where the truth is locked behind the doors and swept aside
We are the ones that are born to face this hell
What will become of our future, only time will tell

[BRIDGE]
Lost all control since the sacred times of old
They believe in what they preach but we're out of reach

[CHORUS]
We are the children forlorn
Nobody cares 'bout the scorn
We live and bleed, we die in need
We are the children forlorn

Our lives been beaten down with time
If you could look into our future emptiness you'd find
Another day, another soul astray
We always seem to wonder "is this the only way?"

There will come a day when all the fools  will sail away
All the promises they made to you are swept away
And when the smoke has cleared and you see us standing there
You will never be in chains again, yeath
