[M and L: T. Eriksson]

Our lives are taken too much for granted
And it seem we've lost the answers
The wheel of life, we live then die
But now I'm trapped between the oceans
And I'm losing all emotions
The future is calling but I'm not there to listen

[BRIDGE]
Seconds, years or days to me it's all the same
A hollow shell that once was me, my only legacy

[CHORUS]
Dying inside I can't break through the ice
Life applied, Death denied
Fading away I pray for sweet demise
Wait for the last goodbye, let me die

Tied to machines that keep me from leaving
In my heart I'm begging and pleading
Release me from this hell that I'm in
I want to close the final chapter
And face whatever's after
And maybe that I will finally be free

[BRIDGE]
Years they pass me by but still I can't rely
In death to bring me peace from here to eternity
