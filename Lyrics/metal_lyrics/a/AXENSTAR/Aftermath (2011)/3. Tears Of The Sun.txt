Creeping in from the cold, like poison through my veins
Solemn shores release m,e from this pain
But I believe this story is not to end
Until we all will break the chains

Ice cold winds
Roaming across the land

Oh the tears of the sun and when heaven cries it's begun
The tears of the sun in the light of the moon our sins washed away

Defend yourself or you will fall to your knees
Against the one that breeds insanity
The enemy will kick you in the teeth
And you will never, never be truly free

Ice cold winds
Roaming across the land

Oh the tears of the sun and when heaven cries it's begun
The tears of the sun in the light of the moon our sins washed away

To many problems on the way to paradise
Dreams of yesterday now reality
These are the warriors that will greet you when you fall
Past, present, future in this grim fantasy

The judgmental minds that are the rulers of this world
Strong they might seem, but they are weak in their hearts
Behind their smiles and their deceitful grins
Hate and stupidity thrives in a mind full of sin

Ice cold winds
Roaming across the land

Oh the tears of the sun and when heaven cries it's begun
The tears of the sun in the light of the moon our sins washed away
