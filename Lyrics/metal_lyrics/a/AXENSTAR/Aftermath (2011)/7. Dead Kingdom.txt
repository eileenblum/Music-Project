As I walk the path of no return
Down to the darkest side of the realm
Where the ancient dwell in their restless sleep

Reasons for eternal life
Long since gone, forever more
We are the conquerors of the night
And you must obey our lord

For my new kingdom of the world, I will slay them all again
Kingdom of the world, now I'm awaiting the glorious end

Because we are bound to dreams of life
Chasing rays of hope for our souls
The essence of our lives to come

Reasons for eternal life
Long since gone, forever more
We are the conquerors of the night
And you must obey our lord

For my new kingdom of the world, I will slay them all again
Kingdom of the world, now I'm awaiting the glorious end
For my new kingdom of the world, I am the guardian of light
In solitude I am reborn

For my new kingdom of the world, I will slay them all again
Kingdom of the world, now I'm awaiting the glorious end
For my new kingdom of the world I am the guardian of light
I will slay them again, kingdom of the world
Now I'm awaiting the glorious end..
