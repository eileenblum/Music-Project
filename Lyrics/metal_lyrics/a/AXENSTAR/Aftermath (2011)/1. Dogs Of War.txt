Searing for enemies all around the globe
Won't take a second before their guns explode
One mans fortune is another mans demise
They can't be reached behind a wall of lies

We are weakened, destroyed and betrayed
One more soul, one less race
Just as the devil will take his toll
Stand your ground before you lose control

They are not even in human form, not even close to a human mind
Predators roaming the earth searching for new victims to find

The dogs of war
Live or die it's all the same, soon as the world disintegrates
The dogs of war
Fear no one, feel no more shame even now we know your name

Paranoid illusions won't take the blame
For every one that will be slayed
Hunting and killing without remorse
This could be the ultimate force

What would they be without their spite
Nothing more than fools who die
Soldiers of fortune will carry on
To their graves if they don't back down

Riots and revolutions their most precious friend
Standing by waiting for the world to come to an end
These machines of war will rape and destroy
The screams of innocent victims will never cease to exist

They are not even in human form, not even close to a human mind
Predators roaming the earth searching for new victims to find

The dogs of war
Live or die it's all the same, soon as the world disintegrates
The dogs of war
Fear no one, feel no more shame even now we know your name

The dogs of war
Live or die it's all the same, soon as the world disintegrates
The dogs of war
Fear no one, feel no more shame even now we know your name
