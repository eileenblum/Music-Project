Never that close yet not so far away
Since yesterday the war have to wait till another day

Do you realize the danger of the one before you
To many prayers left unspoken, left unheard

So now you see what life can do to you
Never trust in anyone if you want to stay alive

Do you realize the danger of the one before you
To many prayers left unspoken, left unheard

Deep in the night the full moon is rising
Deep in the shadows the chosen awaits
And you will see the dawn of a new world
Plague and starvation follow the escape

Now I see death in your eyes
Frozen left here to die
So in a moment you will be gone
Close your eyes for the last time

Deep in the night the full moon is rising
Deep in the shadows the chosen awaits
And you will see the dawn of a new world
Plague and starvation follow the escape
