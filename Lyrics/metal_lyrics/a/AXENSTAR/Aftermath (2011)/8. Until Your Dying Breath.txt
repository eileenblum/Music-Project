When the morning comes and it all seems so far away
The night before an endless road of pain
We walked side by side along the shores of distrust
Whispering words of love and hate

I never leave you alone he said
Like a thousand screams echoing through your head
For all pain I caused, all tears
I beg your forgiveness, but feed you lies
until your dying breath

Strange how things might seem in a different light
But the wall between us is to high to climb
What can be done to save our souls from falling apart
Remember we are in this together until the end
Now we are pulling each other down

I never leave you alone he said
Like a thousand screams echoing through your head
For all pain I caused, all tears
I beg your forgiveness, but feed you lies
until your dying breath

I never leave you alone he said
Like a thousand screams echoing through your head
For all pain I caused, all tears
I beg your forgiveness, but feed you lies
until your dying breath
