Force fed with your blatant lies, your eyes as cold as ice
To ignorant to realize the reasons why you're still alive
Forgive me for my sins, as time has passed now I know
The answer to what will lie ahead

The light is shining down on me
The hour of judgment is right before me

For I believe that time is short
and the years are running out
Never will the world go back to what it was once before
We all need to find the strength to carry on
through these troubled times
We need a hero to save our day

The light is shining down on me
The hour of judgment is right before me

Forever the pain will live in my heart
Forever the pain will walk alone
Forever the pain stand in the shadows
Forever the pain will be my friend

For now I see what will come is no ones fault
Time has just passed us by without us even knowing why
Fear strikes like lightning in the hearts of man
when the time has come
You better run for cover if you can

The light is shining down on me
The hour of judgment is right before me

Forever the pain will live in my heart
Forever the pain will walk alone
Forever the pain stand in the shadows
Forever the pain will be my friend
