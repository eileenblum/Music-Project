Enter the gate and follow my lead into the unknown
Where ravens fly under blackened skies
and wolves howl in the night
These endless wars has forced us to rise up
from the ashes and into the light

Caught on the run where there's nowhere to hide
except inside your mind
We are the weak
and we have reached the point of no return
Baptized in fire, reborn inside the flames
No use in turning back cause it will never be the same

And I believe that there's a place for you and me
And I believe we live our lives together as one

And I believe that there's a place for you and me
And I believe we live our lives together as one

And I believe that there's a place for you and me
And I believe we live our lives together as one

No telling lies, the brutal truth cuts like a knife
Right through the heart of mankind
No use to fight, just stand aside, this new breed
Will never cease to kill us all
