I am the one that brings you so much pain
I am the one that watch you fall

Until you believe..
But you still don't believe..
You will never believe..

I am the truth and honor you strive to live by
The only savior in the night

Until you believe..
But you still don't believe..
You will never believe..''Confess your sins my son, I really think you should
For all the crimes that you committed there's no cure

I am the one that causes all your misery
Am I the one who shares your pain?

Until you believe..
But you still don't believe..
You will never believe..
