When the last of the great big cities has fallen
And the last stone crumbles to dust
We rise form the ashes of compassion and trust

To bring new life to where there is none
It's a task to hard to achieve
We surrender to the powers that be

Where lives once were lost, new will come alive
The an new city is born
But the struggle will continue on and on

The innocent victims of the disaster
They are now laid to their rest
Buried but always remembered deep in our hearts

All alone in the dark we are here once again
In the aftermath
Through the fire and brimstone we forged our way
In the aftermath
We are the ones who did survive this hell
In the aftermath
We will fight all this evil to unlock this spell
In the aftermath

All alone in the dark we are here once again
In the aftermath
Through the fire and brimstone we forged our way
In the aftermath
We are the ones who did survive this hell
In the aftermath
We will fight all this evil to unlock this spell
In the aftermath
