My eyes are blind, to the signs of a lie
I have never learnt to see the truth in disguise
Through all the years I have lived
I've longed to be free, from the lies and deception

Soon we will come to the bitter end
The final call
What we have learnt from the lives we've lived
That will soon be forgotten

Farewell my friend it's time to go, you'll be missed forever
Impossible now to go on, you don't deserve a place in my heart

Deep down inside, crucified, nailed to the cross
Those innocent eyes staring right back at me
You were never as close as you thought
Now you're drowning in flames 
For a new day is dawning

Soon we will come to the bitter end
The final call
What we have learnt from the lives we've lived
That will soon be forgotten

Farewell my friend it's time to go, you'll be missed forever
Impossible now to go on, you don't deserve a place in my heart

I see pieces of my life
Bruised and scarred reflects my mind
For I am alive, here I am, talk to my face and don't back down, no
Forever trusting as I bow my head for you down in shame

Soon we will come to the bitter end
The final call
What we have learnt from the lives we've lived
That will soon be forgotten

Farewell my friend it's time to go, you'll be missed forever
Impossible now to go on, you don't deserve a place in my heart

Farewell my friend it's time to go, you'll be missed forever
Impossible now to go on, you don't deserve a place in my heart
