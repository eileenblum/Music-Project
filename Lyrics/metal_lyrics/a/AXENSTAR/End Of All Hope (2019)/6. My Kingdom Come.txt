A journey far away from home I was left to die here all alone
Tired and deranged I kneel before the one I thought was real
Deep inside the question came, I was filled up with a sense of shame
Like lightning in the dead of night I was stricken by a rod of light

Fear and disbelief guided my way
Dreams and illusions led me astray forever
I don't know if I can hold on much longer

I'll never sleep, I'll never rest
Until my kingdom come
I'll bow my head down to my chest
My sins can't be undone

Through the fighting and the fears, I never thought it would end in tears
Things that once seemed so real, left a scar in me that will never heal
Feeding me with tales and lies, left impressions that never die
They follow me till the end of time, now I have to pay for all my crimes

Fear and disbelief guided my way
Dreams and illusions led me astray forever
I don't know if I can hold on much longer

I'll never sleep, I'll never rest
Until my kingdom come
I'll bow my head down to my chest
My sins can't be undone
