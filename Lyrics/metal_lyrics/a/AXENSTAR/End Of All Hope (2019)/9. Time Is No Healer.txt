Have you ever taken the time to listen to the story unwind
I promise it will bring comfort into your mind
In a time when peace is no more and everyone is longing for war
The lack of truth will surely be our fall

Time is no healer once you've lost your mind

Take the chance to dance
With the dead feelings you have locked inside your head
Come with me and I will release your inner strength in life
Hate the one you have become
And show the world that you can't be undone
Close your eyes and forget the past the nightmares will not last

Time is no healer once you've lost your mind

I see demons in my mind, shadows from another time
Ghostly figures reaching for my hands I scream and wonder
Will I ever stay alive and survive another night
Fearing what will come when I close my eyes

The night has fallen yet my eyes can see the face in the dark
Innocence no longer saves me am I lost forever more

Time is no healer once you've lost your mind

I see demons in my mind, shadows from another time
Ghostly figures reaching for my hands I scream and wonder
Will I ever stay alive and survive another night
Fearing what will come when I close my eyes
