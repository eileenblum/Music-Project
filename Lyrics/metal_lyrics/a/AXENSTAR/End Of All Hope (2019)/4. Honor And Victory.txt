In the dead of night the orders came
A call to arms for glory and fame
We are the ones prepared to die
Never leaving our brothers side

All for one and one for all
United we will stand or fall
Raised to protect, serve and fight
To defend our birth given right

As the ships sail on we say goodbye
Leaving the loved ones far behind

Onwards we march to the hall of the gods
Fighting for honor and victory
With torches held high we call on thee
This is our destiny
Onwards we march to the hall of the gods
Fighting for honor and victory
With torches held high we call on thee
Reaching our destiny

Into battle we charge, we will not give in
We never back down it's worse than a sin
Forever bound to my brothers in arms
I'll do anything to keep them from harm

A prayer for the fallen a toast to the brave
The enemy I will make my slave
Our quest will never ever be forlorn
The strength of our race will be reborn

As the ships sail on we say goodbye
Leaving the loved ones far behind

Onwards we march to the hall of the gods
Fighting for honor and victory
With torches held high we call on thee
This is our destiny
Onwards we march to the hall of the gods
Fighting for honor and victory
With torches held high we call on thee
Reaching our destiny
