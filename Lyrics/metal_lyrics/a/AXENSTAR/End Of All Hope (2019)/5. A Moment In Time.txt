We met on that day when fools are led astray
That day you captured my heart
With that light in your eyes
And a smile that could never ever tell a lie

Remember those days before falling from grace
I should have made you mine
But now it's all gone and life's moving on
I wish I could just hold you in my arms

But today I know
That our road has come to an end

If only just for a moment in time
The love I felt brought a tear to my eye
Now I don't even know where to turn
Lost love is a lesson hard to learn

If I could turn back the time
I know that someday
I'd find the real you hiding inside
But it seems like the past caught up with you at last
I wish I could just hold you one more time

But today I know
That our road has come to an end

If only just for a moment in time
The love I felt brought a tear to my eye
Now I don't even know where to turn
Lost love is a lesson hard to learn

Then in the blink of an eye, you had disappeared
Didn't know what had happened so suddenly

Like time was standing still, I could not move ahead
Couldn't break free from the chains that you put on me

Trapped in this heartless void, like a barren field
Stripped of emotions and memories

You took away my dreams, you took away my pride
You left me here with nothing but doubt

So lost and alone

If only just for a moment in time
The love I felt brought a tear to my eye
Now I don't even know where to turn
Lost love is a lesson hard to learn
