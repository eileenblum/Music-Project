Eyes are staring at me from the dark, I sense your presence inside my room
Hateful dreams scorns my sanity, your world my true enemy

Fear knows no boundaries at all, feeding off my emotions
Wishful thinking of things not to come, waking up screaming once more

Rise up from the deep, witch of ancient times
Come forth and show yourself, oh unholy one
Caught between two worlds you sense your time is up
Suffer the wrath of angels, burn upon the cross

A shadow rises up from the grave
A tortured soul that lost its way
A fallen angel that has been lead astray

Now I finally have found my peace, forever trusting myself
Innocence has since long been gone, no questions of doubt in my mind

Rise up from the deep, witch of ancient times
Come forth and show yourself, oh unholy one
Caught between two worlds you sense your time is up
Suffer the wrath of angels, burn upon the cross
