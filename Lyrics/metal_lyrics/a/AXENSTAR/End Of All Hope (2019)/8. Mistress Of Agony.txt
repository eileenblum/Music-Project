A heart that's made of stone, forever not alone
Intentions were the same but no one here to blame
I search for the one but you are long since gone
Left outside in the rain, I suffer through the pain

With the dark she arrives, mistress of agony
Unveiled in the morning light
In the nighttime she comes, mistress of agony
Hiding away from the sun

A poisonous affair, you were never really there
You're acting oh so cold, made me feel so old
I learned my lesson well, inside this mental hell
I played by the rules but I'll always be the fool

With the dark she arrives, mistress of agony
Unveiled in the morning light
In the nighttime she comes, mistress of agony
Hiding away from the sun

Not knowing is the worst, it feels like my own curse
I'll always wonder why, will this feeling ever die
I fear the day will come, when you and I are done
So empty deep inside, I've lived another lie

With the dark she arrives, mistress of agony
Unveiled in the morning light
In the nighttime she comes, mistress of agony
Hiding away from the sun
