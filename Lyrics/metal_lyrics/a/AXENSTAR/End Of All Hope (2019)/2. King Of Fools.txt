Up in the north beyond the icy wall
Lived a king and queen in wealth and prosperity
The fertile lands so full of life in bloom
No one could ever see beyond that peace and harmony

Then a darkness crept up from behind
And the jealous king soon would find
That when a doubting mind is set
There's no way to forget

Burn on the pyre
And begone evil desire
Smoke rising higher
As the flames will cleanse her soul tonight

The king would soon learn about her wicked ways
For years it had been known all inside the castle walls
Shackled in chains the queen was locked away
Waiting for the trial that would surely seal her fate

Then a darkness crept up from behind
And the jealous king soon would find
That when a doubting mind is set
There's no way to forget

Burn on the pyre
And begone evil desire
Smoke rising higher
As the flames will cleanse her soul tonight

When the day had come for the king to say farewell
He looked deep in her eyes
As the flames touched the sky
He turned his back and slowly walked away
But in the back of his mind he's so afraid
Of what he'll find

Then a darkness crept up from behind
And the jealous king soon would find
That when a doubting mind is set
There's no way to forget

Burn on the pyre
And begone evil desire
Smoke rising higher
As the flames will cleanse her soul tonight
