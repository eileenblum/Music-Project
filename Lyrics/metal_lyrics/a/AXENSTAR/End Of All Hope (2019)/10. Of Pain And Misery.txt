Minutes seem like hours as the days turns into night
Years go by without you by my side
No one can ever understand what you must feel inside
I welcome you to your final fight

Knowing I can never ease your pain
My life will never be the same again
Hold you in my arms and never let go

Now the time has come to open up your eyes
To accept your fate in a final sacrifice
Lost inside your own mind never to break free
Fighting hard with haunting dreams of pain and misery

Won't you please stay with me for another night
I don't think I can ever do this right
Follow me into the darkness and let me be your guide
Trust me when I say it will be alright

Knowing I can never ease your pain
My life will never be the same again
Hold you in my arms and never let go

Now the time has come to open up your eyes
To accept your fate in a final sacrifice
Lost inside your own mind never to break free
Fighting hard with haunting dreams of pain and misery
