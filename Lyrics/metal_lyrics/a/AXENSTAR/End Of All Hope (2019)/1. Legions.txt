In legions we've gathered, awaiting our fate
We are not the ones who will back down
Driven by hatred, anguish and fear
No matter what will come in our way

Lead us to glory and let the battle be won
In the light of the stars our journey has just begun

Fight for survival or killing for fun
There's a thin line between right and wrong
Facing our demons our enemy is strong
We need to find the way to carry on

Lead us to glory and let the battle be won
In the light of the stars our journey has just begun
