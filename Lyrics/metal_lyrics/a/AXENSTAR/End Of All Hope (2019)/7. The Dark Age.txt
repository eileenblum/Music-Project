The time of trust and peace are gone
Weâre heading for a darker age
A reign of terror has begun
The time has come to turn the page

The dragon has returned
The horror that you'll face
Will make you scream and it drives you insane
As he spreads his blackened wings across the starlit sky

Tonight our deepest fears will come alive
The flash of light in the sky will end us all
Tonight the dragon has reclaimed his land
Together we will face the end of innocence

Our lives will never be the same
But we are surely the ones to blame
Together we must stand and fight
If we want to survive this night

The dragon has returned
The horror that you'll face
Will make you scream and it drives you insane
As he spreads his blackened wings across the starlit sky

Tonight our deepest fears will come alive
The flash of light in the sky will end us all
Tonight the dragon has reclaimed his land
Together we will face the end of innocence
