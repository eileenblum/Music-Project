A journey without end, it seems like forever
We have walked alone
So maybe soon will know
Whatever future adventures lies ahead

Under the rainbow, beneath the sun
Tonight I wonder will all be undone
Unholy spirits shall seal our fate
Our cities burning with the flames of hate

Standing at the edge of the world, afraid to look down
To see what lies beyond the great horizon
And we all live on borrowed time fearing the end
We finally understand that nothing is forever

Tomorrow yesterday will seem like a fading
Flower a distant memory
And together we fight for what is right
But nothing can withhold the hands of time

Under the rainbow, beneath the sun
Tonight I wonder will all be undone
Unholy spirits shall seal our fate
Our cities burning with the flames of hate

Standing at the edge of the world, afraid to look down
To see what lies beyond the great horizon
And we all live on borrowed time fearing the end
We finally understand that nothing is forever

A journey without end, it seems like forever
We have walked alone
And together we fight for what is right
But nothing can withhold the hands of time

Under the rainbow, beneath the sun
Tonight I wonder will all be undone
Unholy spirits shall seal our fate
Our cities burning with the flames of hate

Standing at the edge of the world, afraid to look down
To see what lies beyond the great horizon
And we all live on borrowed time fearing the end
We finally understand that nothing is forever
