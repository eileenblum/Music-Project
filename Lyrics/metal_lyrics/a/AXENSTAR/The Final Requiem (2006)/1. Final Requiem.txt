Like a ship on the ocean, trying to find the wind to her sails
You are lost in confusion, trapped by the walls of hate

Turn back the hands of time
Write your own destiny

Step into the fire, step into the light
The final requiem
The oath has been broken, you're one with the night
It's the final requiem

Though you walk in the shadows
Without a guiding light by your side
Never stray from the path that's before you
Or you will never survive

Turn back the hands of time
Write your own destiny

Step into the fire, step into the light
The final requiem
The oath has been broken, you're one with the night
It's the final requiem

The minutes seem like hours
When you're inside the dark
Trying to be free from sorrow
The foolish stare in your eyes
But don't you know that you're dead

Like a ship on the ocean, trying to find the wind to her sails
You are lost in confusion, trapped by the walls of hate

Turn back the hands of time
Write your own destiny

Step into the fire, step into the light
The final requiem
The oath has been broken, you're one with the night
It's the final requiem
