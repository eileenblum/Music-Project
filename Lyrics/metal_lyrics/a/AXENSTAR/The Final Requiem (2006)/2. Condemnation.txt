Hiding in the dark, afraid of the light
Impossible it seems, to make it through the day
Hunger takes its toll, my strength is fading fast
The scent of blood awakes my lust
The hunt has just begun

Roaming through the streets, searching aimlessly
Finding the ones down in misery
Victims stand in line, waiting to be reborn
Their past sins washed away by blood
Cleansing their souls

And soon the day will come, when you will rise
My precious angel
Condemned to a life in the shadows
Until the end of time

And soon the day will come, when you will rise
My precious angel
Condemned to a life in the shadows
Until the end of time
