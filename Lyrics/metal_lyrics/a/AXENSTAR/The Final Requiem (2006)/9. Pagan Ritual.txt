Men all dressed in black, forming a circle around me
Alone I am standing there, naked, inside the ring of fire
Caught between two different worlds, hexed by a spell
Left somewhere in time
Drained of all my strength, I'm left here to die

I will walk alone
Into the shadows of my mind
Nightmares are coming true
There's no tomorrow

The lord of evil, awaits me at the altar
The shiny dagger in his hand, just waiting to strike
To pierce right through me
In a web of tangled dreams, eager to bite
The serpent lies waiting
It will soon just end, the eternal sleep

I will walk alone
Into the shadows of my mind
Nightmares are coming true
There's no tomorrow

I will walk alone
Into the shadows of my mind
Nightmares are coming true
There's no tomorrow
