Four hundreds of years they have strived to be free
From oppressions of the enemy

Riding with the spirits, guiding their way
Through the magical mist that surrounds them

Living life as simple as it was meant to be
Standing tall fulfilling the prophecy

Riding with the spirits, guiding their way
Through the magical mist that surrounds them

In the fire they come alive
The soldiers of ancient time
Dancing inside the flames
Like angels in heaven

In the fire they come alive
The soldiers of ancient time
Dancing inside the flames
Like angels in heaven
