Another day in a life full of fear
You're screaming out your anguish
The sense of knowing the reaper is near
You captor walks beside

You are the only one for him
Until the end of time
You ignite the spark in his twisted mind
Just open up your eyes

She was still alive when they found her
Beaten blue from head to toe
Every bone in her precious body, brutally broken in two
There's no tomorrow if you're trapped inside the hide
Slowly you will die, waiting for the end of your life

You feel him breathing down your neck
The foul stench of a sick man
He beats you into obedience
He's impossible to escape from

You are the only one for him
Until the end of time
You ignite the spark in his twisted mind
Just open up your eyes

She was still alive when they found her
Beaten blue from head to toe
Every bone in her precious body, brutally broken in two
There's no tomorrow if you're trapped inside the hide
Slowly you will die, waiting for the end of your life

You are the only one for him
Until the end of time
You ignite the spark in his twisted mind
Just open up your eyes

She was still alive when they found her
Beaten blue from head to toe
Every bone in her precious body, brutally broken in two
There's no tomorrow if you're trapped inside the hide
Slowly you will die, waiting for the end of your life
