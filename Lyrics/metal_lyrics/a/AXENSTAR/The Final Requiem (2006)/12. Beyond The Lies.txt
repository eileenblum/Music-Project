We walk through the fields of insanity
And life it seems has passed you by
Dark open wounds, caressing your soul
Never ever sane again

In laughter, in sorrow, we share all of life's seasons
Together as one, we go to war
Killing, fighting, screaming, dying

To see beyond the lies
We reached the final step
The end of our misery
It is a slaughter of souls

This seems to be our destiny
Far away from our sacred lands
Fighting someone else's war
It is a sad excuse for a legacy

In laughter, in sorrow, we share all of life's seasons
Together as one, we go to war
Killing, fighting, screaming, dying

To see beyond the lies
We reached the final step
The end of our misery
It is a slaughter of souls

To see beyond the lies
We reached the final step
The end of our misery
It is a slaughter of souls
