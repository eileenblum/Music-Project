The winds of tomorrow, blowing hard today
I see the ruins of the world I used to know
I hear the liars, and their words of deceit
Never-ending stories of their false prophecies

One glory day our kingdom will come
When all the wars are gone
We have paid for the sins of yesterday
Our dreams will come true
At the end of the line

Standing in the ashes of a million lives
Dead just because they believed in someone else
Forever trusting, always let down
The time has come for us to make a stand

One glory day our kingdom will come
When all the wars are gone
We have paid for the sins of yesterday
Our dreams will come true
At the end of the line

Take back what's ours and to be free
There won't be any room for forged sympathy
No more denial those days are gone
We've already dug our own graves hundred times around

One glory day our kingdom will come
When all the wars are gone
We have paid for the sins of yesterday
Our dreams will come true
At the end of the line
