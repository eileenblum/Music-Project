When the sun sets the night embraces your soul
The demon in you mind comes alive
Dark shadows dancing on the walls all around you
No lack of imagination, this cannot be real

So take hold of this moment in time
It will forever be lost

Down in the underworld where thousands
Of souls will forever be burning
All creatures of the night watch them fade away
Back to the ancient times when mankind
Worshiped the forces of evil
The alliance with the great deceiver is dead and gone

The tortured spirits of murdered men never sleeps
Doomed to forever wander here on earth
Haunting dreams you wake up screaming
Soaked in you own sweat
No fear of the unknown, you try to tell yourself

So take hold of this moment in time
It will forever be lost

Down in the underworld where thousands
Of souls will forever be burning
All creatures of the night watch them fade away
Back to the ancient times when mankind
Worshiped the forces of evil
The alliance with the great deceiver is dead and gone

Down in the underworld where thousands
Of souls will forever be burning
All creatures of the night watch them fade away
Back to the ancient times when mankind
Worshiped the forces of evil
The alliance with the great deceiver is dead and gone
