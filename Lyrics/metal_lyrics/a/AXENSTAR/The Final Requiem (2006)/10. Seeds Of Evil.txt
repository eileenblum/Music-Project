In this empty space, all alone in here, am I dead or alive
Feel the terror surround me, I wish I had never been born
Looking up to the sky above, hoping for some change
But life is never that easy and there is no one else to blame

We have sown the seeds of evil in the cradle of all time
We walk towards judgment day
Without fear for the end of time

Down and out, kicked to the ground, no remorse, no repent
A twisted mind in a fragile soul a deadly combination
Catastrophic lessons in life, they all end in rage
A foolish step and it all will stop the final destination

We have sown the seeds of evil in the cradle of all time
We walk towards judgment day
Without fear for the end of time

Within the dying embers life will begin
A child born so innocent while darkness comes alive tonight

We have sown the seeds of evil in the cradle of all time
We walk towards judgment day
Without fear for the end of...
We have sown the seeds of evil in the cradle of all time
We walk towards judgment day
Without fear for the end of time
