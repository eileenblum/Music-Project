I call out to the enchantress why, why?
We have crossed the line between what's right and wrong
what's right and wrong

In the name of the one that stands alone
Through torture and pain
Comes a man with a million faces
We will never see him again

I scream out through the open window
I reach out into the light
I reach the sun set slowly but never fade away
My soul's divine

Left inside the hollow shell that's life and death
Together we can conquer anything, anywhere

In the name of the one that stands alone
Through torture and pain
Comes a man with a million faces
We will never see him again

I scream out through the open window
I reach out into the light
I reach the sun set slowly but never fade away
My soul's divine

When the time is right the answer lies before us
Nothing you can say or do will ever change our fate
Because we're all destined for a better cause
But sometimes we are satisfied, just staying alive

In the name of the one that stands alone
Through torture and pain
Comes a man with a million faces
We will never see him again

I scream out through the open window
I reach out into the light
I reach the sun set slowly but never fade away
My soul's divine
I scream out through the open window
I reach out into the light
I reach the sun set slowly but never fade away
