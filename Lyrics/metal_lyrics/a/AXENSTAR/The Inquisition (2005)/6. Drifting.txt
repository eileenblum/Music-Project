Drifting away, to the place where I belong
I see the night transforming into dawn

Tonight I sleep beside you for the last time
Make sure that you won't hear me leave

Slipping away, into the endless sleep
Silent tears running down my cheeks

No matter where the winds of life may lead you
I'll always be there by your side
