He's running out in the night, being watched by the damned
He is running from the light, as fast as he can

Watch as the sun is going down
Darkness will enter this world

Is someone in the shadows?
Hiding from the light
Will you be ready to obey?
To the fallen one

Breaking through space and time, soon he will be here
He's been waiting so many years, now the end is near

Watch as the sun is going down
Darkness will enter this world

Is someone in the shadows?
Hiding from the light
Will you be ready to obey?
To the fallen one

Don't close your eyes
Face the rage of his tormented soul
He will not sleep
Until the final battle is won

Watch as the sun is going down
Darkness will enter this world

Is someone in the shadows?
Hiding from the light
Will you be ready to obey?
To the fallen one
