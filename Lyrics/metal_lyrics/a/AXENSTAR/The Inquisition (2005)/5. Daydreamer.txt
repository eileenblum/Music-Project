Have you ever seen a sun shine at night?
Have you ever seen a star in sunlight?
Do you sleep when the wolves are free?
Or do you lie awake thinking how will it be?

I'm not the kind of person with all the answers
I'm just a simple man who's searching the truth
Since you marked my soul with your touch
I see you in my dreams, I want you so much

Now I've scaped from my reality
Unleashed my soul just to feel your touch

I'm a daydreamer in the moonlight
A passion out of sight
I'm a daydreamer in the shadows
I'm your dream tonight

You're my reverie in the dead of night
Maybe one day my dreams can come true
Catch the day and leave life behind
Am I brave enough to follow my heart?

Now I've scaped from my reality
Unleashed my soul just to feel your touch

I'm a daydreamer in the moonlight
A passion out of sight
I'm a daydreamer in the shadows
I'm your dream tonight

I wish this dream would last forever
I wish it all would come true
I'm the only one who could change it all
But I'm just a daydreamer

Daydreamer

I'm a daydreamer in the moonlight
A passion out of sight
I'm a daydreamer in the shadows
I'm your dream tonight
