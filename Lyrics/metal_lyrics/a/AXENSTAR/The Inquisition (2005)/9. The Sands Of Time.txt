In a time when the world has gone completely powermad
We find the way to paradise written in the sands of time

Waking up to another day, with a strong will to survive
Searching the past, for the mistakes made by man
Take a good look at what what you see and let's get one thing straight
Nothing will ever be the same, never again

Greed is the fisrt step to ruin
Dishonour, the second to come
Third is the gruesome loneliness
The last one is death

In a time when the world has gone completely powermad
We find the way to paradise written in the sands of time
To scape from the enemy that lives within us all
Start all over one more time and pray we will get it right

Waking up to a tortured world, deprived of all love and hope
Misery has lead us astray and we'll soon be lost forever
Unless we can break free from the chains that holds us down
We got to learn from our mistakes and take control

Greed is the fisrt step to ruin
Dishonour, the second to come
Third is the gruesome loneliness
The last one is death

In a time when the world has gone completely powermad
We find the way to paradise written in the sands of time
To scape from the enemy that lives within us all
Start all over one more time and pray we will get it right

In a time when the world has gone completely powermad
We find the way to paradise written in the sands of time
To scape from the enemy that lives within us all
Start all over one more time and pray we will get it right
