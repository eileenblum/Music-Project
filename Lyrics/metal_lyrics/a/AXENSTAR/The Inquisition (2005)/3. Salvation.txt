From the dawn of time, the strong have always ruled the weak
Like a knife in the back the promises they made
Never fullfilled you're always betrayed

But now the time has come
For you to rise once more
To take back what's yours
And be forever free

Salvation is now close at hand
In union we stand
We'll spread the word across the land
In union we stand

Since the day they arrived
We all have known what will come
Too many times beaten down to the ground, never again

But now the time has come
For you to rise once more
To take back what's yours
And be forever free

Salvation is now close at hand
In union we stand
We'll spread the word across the land
In union we stand

The days of freedom are long since gone
For you and I the fight goes on
To bring back some sunshine into our lives

Salvation is now close at hand
In union we stand
We'll spread the word across the land
In union we stand
