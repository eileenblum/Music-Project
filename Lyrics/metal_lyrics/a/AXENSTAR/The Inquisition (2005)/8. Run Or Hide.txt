On that rainy night, when the angels tears were falling
I saw it for the first time
Coming out from the dark
With it's evil smile and it's wicked ways
Growing stronger as the night is falling
And the daylight fades away

It devours the light
The beast in the night
It will soon hunt you down
It tears out your heart
Beware from the start
You better run or hide

From the darkest grave up from the deepest ocean
It will rise with a fury so strong
The will to destroy, is the primal urge that keeps this beast alive
It summon the forces of darkness, rising up from hell

It devours the light
The beast in the night
It will soon hunt you down
It tears out your heart
Beware from the start
You better run or hide

But a new day will come, when all the filth and sorrow is gone
The beast will be conquered, slayed to the ground
Never to return and the world will rise again
From the ashes of the evil reign

It devours the light
The beast in the night
It will soon hunt you down
It tears out your heart
Beware from the start
You better run or hide
