A broken soul on the edge to insanity
Not knowing right from wrong or what is true or false
Making up your own rules of how to live your life
Don't you ever ever think about anyone else?

Inside your mind there's a never ending battle
Between the lies and the words that speaks the truth
Take what you can before is it all over
Your evil deeds will in the end bring you down

Go back in time to when you were much younger
The scars in your soul forced you to be strong
Aggression, disbelief, controlling your life
Confrontation seems like the only way

Inside your mind there's a never ending battle
Between the lies and the words that speaks the truth
Take what you can before is it all over
Your evil deeds will in the end bring you down

Searching for answers
In the emptiness between dream and reality
The secrets of life hidden deep in your mind
Carefully kept away from the outside world

Inside your mind there's a never ending battle
Between the lies and the words that speaks the truth
Take what you can before is it all over
Your evil deeds will in the end bring you down
