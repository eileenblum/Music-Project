Born into fire, rise up in hell
Hunting the storm always something to tell
Innocent child who's damned from the start
Searching a dream away from his past

But his memory was all he could see
His life so far was a slowly fading star

Wiped out his future with anger and rage
Blamed his gods through the early years
Always a prisioner, never let free
Under black wings he will always be

Born into fire, rise up with hate
Everything is known of his future fate
Punishing days and sleepless nights
To hold his nightmares off the day

But his memory was all he could see
His life so far was a slowly fading star

Wiped out his future with anger and rage
Blamed his gods through the early years
Always a prisioner, never let free
Under black wings he will always be

Beyond reality of how human life could be
The beast inside him grew much stronger
Forced him to grow up with rage right from the start
Would he find his dreamland deep in heart?

But his memory was all he could see
His life so far was a slowly fading star

Wiped out his future with anger and rage
Blamed his gods through the early years
Always a prisioner, never let free
Under black wings he will always be
