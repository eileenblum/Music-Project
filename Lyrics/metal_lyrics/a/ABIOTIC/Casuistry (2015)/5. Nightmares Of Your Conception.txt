In another realm of existence
There lies a beast inside of you that you did not know existed.

It is a monster that lives deep inside of you.
The malicious things that run through your mind are coming to life
In this evil, filthy world that comes from within you.

You are the terror that plagues the earth
Shrouding the light in blackness.

Merciless, wretched life taking being.
And in this world you devise a process to annihilate
This world is your own creation

Your heart beats to inflict pain unto all living things
No emotion lies in your eyes
Behold the mere image of what you are.
Stare upon the glass at your reflection.
But beyond that mirror are the nightmares of your conception. 

Turning against ever moral that you've known to believe.
Deep, hidden away in your subconscious lies a monster,
A creature, born from your darkest desires.
