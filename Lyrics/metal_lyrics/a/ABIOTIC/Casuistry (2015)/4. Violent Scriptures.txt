As you're crippling with fear for the blade as it's drawing near
You stare up to the sky and it is silent.
For this is the kind of creator you follow.
One who wears a mask and inside is hollow.
Three empty sects for this one misread book
To date there have been millions of lives that this leader has shook.
But for an entire population that lives with the sand,
They die day by day with their blood on the land.

Children are accustomed to bombs being dropped and shots being fired.
Wondering everyday "will this be the day I catch a stray?"

Catastrophic explosions are set off daily,
Religious extremist are taking their teachings and trying to dismantle the system they live in
Along with taking the lives of their kin, because they don't follow the teachings they are living with sin.

Driving along, just like everyone else.
Unloading a clip into the group next to them.
Following the crash, they get out of the car.
To finish the job, they unload one more.

Imagine what it's like to live every day in fear.
To be put to death for what you hold dear.
A knife to your throat or a bullet in your head,
Because you followed the wrong prophet and were mislead.

They won't stop.
The killing it won't stop. 
Thousands of years.
So many lives in vain
We are in debt and look up to the peaceful prophet
So many lies we have been fed
Until we are finally dead.
