Atoms splitting, 
A blast caused by my birth.
An unknown being forged from the depths of the unseen.
Brought forth to destroy. 
A degree of hear which cannot be measured,
A flash of light and life was born.
Something from nothing,
And now the destruction begins.
I have materialized into a living nightmare.
No beacon of hope, nor prayer can save your life.
My molecular structure is unlike anything you have ever seen.
To describe my form would be unnatural. 
My external design is made to annihilate.

I am not fear, for those who do see me have no stories to tell.
I have no interest in genocide, but complete and utter decimation to your kind.
The way you destroy what you are given.

Atoms splitting, 
A blast caused by my birth.
An unknown being forged from the depths of the unseen.
Brought forth to destroy. 
A degree of hear which cannot be measured,
A flash of light and life was born.

Annihilate.

Stripping the life away from the desolate planet.
Taking advantage and being controlled by your greed.
Open your eyes and you will see.
