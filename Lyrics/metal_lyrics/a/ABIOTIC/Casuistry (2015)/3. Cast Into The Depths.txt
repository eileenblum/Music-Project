They use fear to control the masses,
They use fear to control you all.

For those who chose to believe in reason,
Are doomed to death for their blasphemous treason.
They cast the wicked into the depths for he waits for them below the surface.

All hail to the king and he will spare your life.
Any sect willing to challenge his rule,
are condemned to torture.
For he stands upon his throne,
Commanding the breaking of their bones.
There is no mercy for the unworthy,
As whips crack and echo,
As flesh tears and blood is shed

A twisted vile creation one which breeds disease,
For they tell the stories of the slaves to be.
Shackles and chains hold them down as they struggle to survive.
The holiest ones offer only death, as they pray up to the sky.

There is no free will, from the one they write about. 
Claiming to be almighty, but silent when it counts.
"To believe what we cannot see, or death will come to us"
Claiming to love your creation,
Instead watching them suffer through total decimation.

For those who chose to believe in reason,
Are doomed to death for their blasphemous treason
