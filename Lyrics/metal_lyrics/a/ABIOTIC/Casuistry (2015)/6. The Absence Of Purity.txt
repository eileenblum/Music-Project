Stripped of all morality, like he stripped cloth from her flesh.
Bashed her skull to silence the noise and avoid an awful mess.

She swore an oath to keep her faith and stay pure until the day a man on his knees would bless her with a ring.
His plan destroyed her hopes and dreams with terror he would bring.

The defloration of an innocent girl who lived life by the book and tried so hard to
Shut out the nature of her desires caused her to be shunned and cast into the fires,
They see her as an evil being,
She was forced to give up her purity.

When tragedy struck they were nowhere to be found, as she was crying lying on the ground.

She wonders why she's cursed with a life of doom and shame.
Can't even turn the corner without flinching, life is not the same.
"He works in mysterious ways"
The one who loves her turned his back and then she was betrayed.
Her faith was destroyed when the pastor looked in her the eyes and told her she was full of sin.

Because she did not wait for marriage,
They decided to exile her for a crime done by a malicious man.
She cries out, "I was attacked."
"It doesn't matter your innocence is gone do not come back"

Left alone, defiled and impure with
Contamination from an unholy man.
Ripe with fear drilling down into her core.
Living with the title "blasphemous whore"

Now that she has nothing, roaming the streets where he life was destroyed.
Wondering where to go from here.
Praying everyday to not live in fear.
Faith won't save you when you need it most.
The father, the son, and a careless "holy" ghost.
