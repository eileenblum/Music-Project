Gaze upon those oblivious vermin
Suffocating in the illusion of materialistic decomposition
For those who will claim to have entrance through the gates of heaven
Are descending into a realm of nonexistence.
Mindless fools, who will believe what cannot be seen

They plan out lies of total corruption
The ones who lead, will murder all those who oppose them. 

An infestation slowly feasting on the impurities of these peasants

They fall so easily to a hand that draws the steel.
All hail to the king, down on your knees.

Pray to a fallen idol who will not spare you,
They have no mercy for you.
