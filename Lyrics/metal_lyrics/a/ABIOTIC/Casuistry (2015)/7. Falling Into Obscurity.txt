Trapped underneath the weight of the world
A pit of darkness consumes you.
Controlling everything. 
You cannot escape the fate you've chosen.

You took a mother from her child and you've not one ounce of sympathy
Just because you feel alone
You destroy every perfect living thing
A black hole to society
Terrorizing everything
Drawn to the darkness

You have fallen into obscurity, not seen by anyone or anything
Nameless and faceless amongst the living
No recognition from above or below so climbing the stairs to the rooftop you go.
Staring into the night sky, wishing to be among the stars.

You have reached your horizon
Another plane of existence awaits
Transcending this realm of consciousness
For you have decided your own fate

Every ounce of light that exists in this world
Is drawn into the blackness
No sympathy, no empathy, 
Spiraling downward, an end in sight
The world watches as you fall ten stories,

And in those last moments of your life
before you hit the ground 
Your life flashes before your eyes.
It is too late to change your fate
Like the light in the skies
You are also gone forever.
Only just a memory, one wishing to be forgotten.
Just like all the others your name will fade into dust. Into nothing.
