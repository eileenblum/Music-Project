Through the years of testing,
We have found the answer to immortality.
Though it is not all confined to one mortal form.

In the last few moments of your life right before the body dies,
We capture all your thoughts throughout the time you are alive,
Extract every precious moment and wipe it from your memory.
Inject the volatile substance that creates a monster.

Force fed images to manipulate
Snapping your morality for your ultimate demise
Vision skewed by psychotic hallucinations
Tortured, mutilated until your mind is finally taken.
Stare them right in the eyes,
When the blade goes in, they slowly die.
Perform the deeds which we hath laid right before you. 

Everything is going just as we planned
A mindless creation hell bent on destruction
You are the first of many to be changed,
A self inflicted genocide, for it is time for us to rise.

For years we have planned your judgment.
Plotting where we can't be seen.
Studying your movements and mastering your thoughts.
Exposing the weakness and all of your flaws
For this is the end, we will erase you all.

You will never be free
