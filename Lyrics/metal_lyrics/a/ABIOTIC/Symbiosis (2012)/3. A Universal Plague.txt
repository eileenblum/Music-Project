Vindictive hands have embraced the oceans before, but the shores had never recoiled so desperately. Entrenched in several principles of the ancients, but primarily twisted by a more cruel modern topography. The pure will enable the full embodiment of pestilences. Zephyrs avow the notion of widespread catastrophe. Clouds of tragedy and calamity extend throughout the lands. While some are weak and futile, others remain resolute within plateaus of extreme pessimism. Alarmed the cosmos pray amidst bleak auroras, in hope of crimson tomorrows for mankind. We're like an epidemic that seeks to expand beyond its terrestrial bounds. We will become a universal plague if we thrive afar from our margins. A mother will ingest the wine of her disemboweled sons, but their remains will not suffice to cleanse her filthy loams. We're like an epidemic that seeks to expand beyond its terrestrial bounds. We will become a universal plague if we thrive afar from our margins.
