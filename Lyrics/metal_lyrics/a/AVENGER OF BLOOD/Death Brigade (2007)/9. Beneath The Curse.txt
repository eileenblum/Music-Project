Curse of the dead
Blades of the scythe
Plotting revenge
Seething with hate
Now you will feel
The reprisals of evil

[Pre-chorus:]
Terrify
You will die
Mortal dread
Now you're dead

[Chorus:]
Fallacy - of a blinded mind
Infamy - killing through time
Evil plague - darkness in the land
From the grave - soldiers of the damned

Blood is the fluid
That oils our machine
Crushing the skulls
Smashing the bones
Thriving upon
All the screams of the wounded

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

Devastate all we see
Barren and wicked world
Killing all in our path
For we have always been
Beneath the curse

[Lead - Marc]
[Lead - Eric]

Axes to grind
Sharpen the steel
Push to the front
Battle macabre
Driven to slaughter
With power we kill

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

We are all
Underneath the curse!
