We stand against the world
Denying shame and scorn
We march on fearlessly
Into the rising storm

[Pre-chorus:]
The final curtain
Is all you see
In devastating
Reality
No tortured conscience
Will hold us back
With blinding speed
Comes the attack

[Chorus:]
All hail the death brigade
All hail the death brigade
Can't stop the death brigade
You will all fall to the death brigade

With armaments deployed
Destroying all in sight
No concept of defeat
We always win the fight

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Lead - Eric]
[Lead - Marc]

[Chorus]

[Lead - Eric]

A wall of sonic pain
A violent thrashing force
Machine is fed by war
The need for death it's source

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

Fall. Fight! Kill! "Die!"
