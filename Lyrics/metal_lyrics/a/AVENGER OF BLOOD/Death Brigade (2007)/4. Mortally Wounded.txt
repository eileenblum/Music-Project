Suffocating scared to die
Lying bleeding on the battlefield
Rushing blood to your brain
Hallucinations wreck your mind

[Pre-chorus:]
Your face is covered in blood
Now you die
Your life has come to an end
No more time

[Chorus:]
Death
Sentenced to die
Fear
Your demise

Fading conscious, blinding pain
Struggling to stay alive
Deserted in battle
Left to rot upon the plains

[Pre-chorus]
[Chorus]

[Lead - Eric]
[Lead - Marc]
[Lead - Eric]

Cut off from life
The flames arise
Abandoned hope
Help is denied

[Lead - Marc]

The stench of death
With final breath
You curse your place
Among the dead

Deadly battle, 'til the end
Cut down by the enemy
Mortally wounded
Feel your body growing cold

[Pre-chorus 2:]
Your face is covered in blood
Now you die
Betrayed on the battlefield
Never to rise

[Chorus]
