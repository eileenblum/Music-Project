Violent thoughts in their minds
You must die
Vicious ways rule their lives
Endless pain
Now is the sacrifice
Blood splattered everywhere
Now is the time of death
Flesh will melt from bone

[Chorus]
Heat like the core of the sun
Now face your death from above
Complete annihilation

Wave of shock - skulls collapse
Silenced cries
Watch the world scream in pain
All life dies
Warnings are in the sky
Soon you will evaporate
Death's lust will have you now
Watch the world incinerate

[Chorus]

Cruel intention
Desolation
No rebirth
Isolation
Ghastly future
Of the earth
Devastation
Man's invention
Evil seed
Fascination
Incineration
Watch it bleed

No life left - barren world
Darkened skies
Frozen winds - acid rain
Earth's demise
Violently pacified
Man returns to the dust
Scorched black the records lie
Underneath the planet's crust

[Chorus]
