Lost in the darkness
Tortured by evil
Torn and demented
Driven by Satan
I'm enslaved
Days without number
No human contact
Only my victims
Now they are silenced

[Chorus:]
Bound by torment
Face the mindset
Driven insane
Bound by torment
Slay the innocent
Driven insane

Total commitment
Hiding the bodies
No one will find me
Never repenting
I'm enslaved
Realistic visions
Paranoid hatred
Darkness from within
Creates who I am

[Chorus]

Lost in the darkness
Tortured by evil
Torn and demented
Driven by Satan
I'm enslaved
Feeling the power
Draining the lifeforce
This is my calling
It will never end

[Chorus x2]
