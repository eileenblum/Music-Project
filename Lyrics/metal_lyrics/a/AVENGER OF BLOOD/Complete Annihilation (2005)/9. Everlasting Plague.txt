Lost souls of blasphemy
Evil seeking out the dead
Self-made righteous destiny
Soon they walk upon the earth
New death biological
Desolation in its wake
Impure is this way to kill
Falling ever farther down is mankind
We will fight to the death
You will lose control of mind and soul
Feel the pain of life and death unfold

[Chorus:]
All is gone it has been forseen
Certain death by the war machine
Suffocate from a plague unclean
Millions die in a final scream

One man's vile fantasy
Is to conquer all the world
Minions follow mindlessly
Devastation is their goal
So sanctuary dies
No more hiding for the weak
As children fall as prey
Burning from within their flesh
Pray to die before time sends this plague
You will lose control of mind and soul
Feel the pain of life and death unfold

[Chorus]

Pray to die before time sends this plague
You will lose control of mind and soul
Watch the pain of future death unfold

[Chorus]

You will lose control of mind and soul
Feel the pain of future death unfold
Immortality has been denied
Cities burn as flesh attempts to hide
All is lost the plague begins to spread
No one left bury all the dead
