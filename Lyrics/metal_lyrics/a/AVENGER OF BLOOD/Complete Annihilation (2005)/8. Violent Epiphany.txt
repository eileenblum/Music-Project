Cortex of destruction swallows all within its wake
Violent epiphany of everlasting pain
Gravestones light the path - spirits wish to die
Mausoleum of horror shows the way

[Chorus:]
Blinded in their cell
Lost without a sign
Tortures await
Forever lost inside

Buried in a darkened state and clawing at the lid
Those you trusted laugh as you suffer within your skin
Daylight turns to black now accept your death
Eyes are widening realize the past

[Chorus]

Time for suffering
You are dead inside
Feel the loss of hope
And your demise
See the face of death
Fear that grows inside
Watch your life erase

Now you realize
You are dead inside
There will be no end
To your demise
See the face of death
Fear that grows inside
Watch your life
Watch it pass you by

[Chorus x2]
