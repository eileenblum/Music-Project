Dictators of death who desecrate
Orders must be followed to take life
Time is of the essence conquer all
Unleashed ravaging the land must fall
Forced down on their knees
Are the powerless
Fear of punishment

[Chorus:]
Birthed from the mind of the darkside
Cruel with their use of steel
Tyrants of the bloodlands

Genocidal visions fill their thoughts
Kill the ones who's time has come to die
All who rise against must be put down
Plagued and slaughtered are the next in line
Forced down on their knees
Are the powerless
Fear of punishment

[Chorus]

Sent down is the violent command
More left to die - butchered by their hand
The shackles of hell arise - the specters of finality
Too late to save your life - left to die in shadows
Look deep inside the graves of the dead
Kept from the world - buried in the earth
Forced to lie in rotten tombs - they waste away

Dictators of death who desecrate
Orders must be followed to take life
Time is of the essence conquer all
Unleashed ravaging the land must fall
Forced down on their knees
Are the powerless
Fear of betrayal

[Chorus x2]
