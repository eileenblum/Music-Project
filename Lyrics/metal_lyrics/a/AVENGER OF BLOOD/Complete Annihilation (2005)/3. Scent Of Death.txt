A life of punishment
Sick in the mind
A shell of twisted life
Empty inside
Thoughts deranged
Mental scarring
From the past
Tears of blood
Overflowing
No one cares

[Chorus:]
Nothing left (but the)
Scent of death

The voices came to me
Deep in my dreams
Eternal promises
Power unseen
So tonight
My assignment
Is to kill
I have been
Captivated
To the end

[Chorus]

I rise at night like the time before
My victim's blood spills upon on the floor
A display of banishment
No escape from my torment
I hear the call from beyond the gate
I am a vessel of my masters hate
As possession swallows me
Path of light I cannot see

Obey my overlord
Forced by his will
Voices tear me apart
Bloodlust my vice
Hearts are cut
From the victims
Of my rage
Reasons for
Seven slaughters
Are fulfilled

Nothing left
Final breath
Of your soul
Scent of death
