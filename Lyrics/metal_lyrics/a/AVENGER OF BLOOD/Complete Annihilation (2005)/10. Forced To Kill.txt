Time slips by like grains of sand
Depression lasts it will not end
Darkness falls before his eyes
Spiralling into demise

[Chorus:]
Flashback in his mind
All of those who died
Forced to kill from youth
Time heals not the wounds

No drug can destroy his pain
Lost inside without a friend
Those he knows want to forget
Atrocities they did commit

[Chorus]

A broken man is on the edge
Now the killing must be done
No return to normalcy
Must adapt to society
Adapt to society

A policy of hate enforced
Troops of death consume the world
This plague of blood cannot be stopped
The human race it propigates
