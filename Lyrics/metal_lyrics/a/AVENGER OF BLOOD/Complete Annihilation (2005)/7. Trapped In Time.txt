Soon I will bring to the world
The tortures of my mind
Fall to the bringer of death
And unrelenting pain
This is a shadow of victory
A persecuted world
I bring the evil to life
And turn the darkness into pain

[Chorus:]
Spirit of the underworld
Trapped in time
Spirit of the underworld
Forever trapped in time

Seeking to capture your mind
The entity of fame
Power to shatter your life
A master of this game
Listen to all of the lies of gold
A contract sealed in blood
Drown in the rivers of death
I feed upon your tortured screams

[Chorus]

I deceive
All of my chosen ones
Bathed in blood
Lust for torture
Bring to life
My morbid fantasies
Twisted souls
I devour
Bring to me
What I so dearly crave
Tortured souls
Feed my hunger

[Chorus]
