Intense the betrayal
Maze of broken mirrors traps my soul
Now dead I lie in torment
And in agony I scream towards the sky
One life spent just to kill
Isolation is now my reward
And now I feel the sorrow
In this darkened cell is where the pictures lie

[Chorus:]
The soul that's left behind
Hear them calling me

My eyes frozen open
Vivid photographs are haunting me
Transfixed I see their faces
As they smile at me justified at last
A cruel dark dimension
Is designed for me eternally
The proof of guilty pleasures
Dominates my mind I'm screaming out to die

[Chorus]

All is lost
And there's no escape
In my dark tomb
Blood drips from the walls
Bound inside
Shadows of my mind
They remember
They have followed me to my hell

Intense the betrayal
Maze of broken mirrors traps my soul
Now dead I lie in torment
And in agony I scream towards the sky
I have been forgotten
And I'm banished where there is no life
My lust consumes my body
And I rot in chains forever and again

[Chorus]

The soul that's left behind
Scream in agony
