Psychotic minds that lust for torture
Intimidate with ignorance
Haunted victims cringe in terror
Mortal strength is no defense

Blinded drones pay homage
Slaves are mastered by their lusts
Banished tyrants laughing as
They suffocate the heart of man

[Chorus:]
Spawned in war
Religious fanaticism
Controls the land
A vile choice

Morbid lies of anarchy
Pain consumes the netherworld
Souls betrothed to darkened masters
Spilling blood achieve their goals

Taking lives with no emotion
Ripping deepest bonds apart
Plotting terror in their minds
Families mourn in blackened skies

[Chorus:]
Spawned in war
Religious fanaticism
Controls the land
A vile choice insanity

Stripped of all that makes them human
Taught to kill no peace resolve
Brainwash tells them to control
The fallen land in which they dwell

[Chorus]

Conditioned to hate
Fear controls the choices made
Violent resurgence
Ancient trends in genocide

Conditioned to hate [2x]
