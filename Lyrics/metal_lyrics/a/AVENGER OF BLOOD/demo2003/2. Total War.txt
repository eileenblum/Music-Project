Within the deepest night
They gather secretly
A plot against us all
To seem to not exist

Driven to persecute
The goal to massacre
Control the weakest minds
And then they all must die

[Chorus:]
They will destroy
They seek control
Fight back or die
Soon a total war

Insane tormenting grip
Brought forth to dominate
Alliances of death
To seal eternal fate

While seeking endless horror
Arriving to destroy
Subconscious battle rages
And soon a total war

[Chorus]

Death in a flash of light
Drowned in the streets of blood
Maimed are the innocent
Traumatization law

Serving the prophet's demand
Faceless the ones who've died
Blindly obey the command
False martyrs of suicide

[Chorus]
