Tortured
Maimed bound and gagged they eternally lie
Murdered
Never repenting their war with the sky
Slaughtered
Still they at once chose the torments of hell
Butchered
Soul smashed to pieces the price they rebelled

Devoured
They constantly search for the light
Dismembered
Cut off from life it is death that they spite
Screaming
The fire engulfs their plagued souls
Haunting
The torments of hell takes its toll

[Chorus:]
Rebel human spirits

Strangled as they lie in their blood
Reeling from the guilt of their past
Inner void is never complete
Only companions are tormented memories

[Chorus]
