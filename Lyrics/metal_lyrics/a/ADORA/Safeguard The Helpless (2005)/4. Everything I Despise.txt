I've watched the filth thats become my fellow man,
I've seen the kingdom fall once again rise,
The world holds no ground along the road,
I've fallen to destiny I no longer find it
Necessary to become who I want the truth of it is,

I will always be who I am,
I've seen the tongues of man ripped from there flesh,
I've seen the hearts of man painted the darkest black,
My Struggle to turn myself from murder I come to find

That I'm he who cuts the throat of my brothers,
I am everything that is ugly in this world,
I am the result of my own lies,
I am everything I despise,
