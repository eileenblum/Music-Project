I need tomorrow more than then before
I have fallen again to lust
I need tomorrow more than ever
I have fallen to his games

Reckless thoughts brought up by thoughtless actions
"I will always provide a way out."
I'll wait until I fall to my knees again
Wait until I fall to sin

"I will provide a way out."
"I will provide a way out."

With hands around my throat. I grasp for air
Both hands around my neck. I need life
The snake around my throat. save my life
I need your love to survive, save me

Tomorrow has never seemed so far
This guilt has won again
What have I done to myself?
Jesus, save me.
