I have failed so many times to become the person
The person that I long to be
Perfection, the standard of my everything
Unable to realize I bring my fall

Perfection, a task not possible
I try so hard, not hard enough
My God, lived without sin
Myself, I'm indulged in it

My god how long I will sing this song
And my god how long til I come home?
My god I'll sing until I have no breath
And my god come and take me home

Blood stained hands carry my sins
My hands carry no such wounds
Your eyes have searched for me
I look away. I look away

I have failed to be the person I strive to be
I fall so short to the expectations
You wore the crown of thorns, as I wear the crown of shame

Your eternal sacrifice
Has torn a whole inside my heart
I fail to sin, not for the last time
I will rise back up, and carry on

My flaw of the man I shouldn't be
Is not the man you died to see
So I'll learn to be who I should be
And give back to you, and give less to me.
