As the stars rise
I see the farewell of my better half
Showered in the, the most sincere shade of red
And while the night has taken you, I know we will remain

Love, this world was meant for you and me
And while you've moved along with the night
I know that we will be just fine
I know things will me alright

My world is crashing down without you

I'll do everything I can to give you everything you deserve
I'll do everything I can to show you the world.
