Follow along the crooked line
The blind leading the blind
What's left to show from your grand idea?
A path of unnecessary death

Lead your men to die
A fight chosen for yourself
A nation torn by sadistic action
Silenced freedom being forced to comply

And for the first time
I am taking a stand
Against an era of destruction because

There is no tomorrow.
