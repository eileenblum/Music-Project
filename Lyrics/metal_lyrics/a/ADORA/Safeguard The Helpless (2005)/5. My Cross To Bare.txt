I try to be a person of you
These thoughts attack my soul from angels
I try to see
Past all the lies
Past the sin of the world
Faulse ideals tear me apart
Pray for and hope of change

This is my cross to bear
My cross
My choice
My life
This is my cross to bear

I work so hard to be what you wanted for me
You bore the cross so I could be
You died so I could live
You died so I could breath

I work so hard to be what you want
You were born so you could die
You carried my sins on the cross
You died so I could be alive

My cross to bear
My cross to bear.
