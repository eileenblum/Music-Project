Flow my tears, fall from your springs,
Exiled for ever, let me mourn.

Flow my tears, fall from your springs,
Exiled for ever, let me mourn
Where night's black bird her sad infamy sings,
There let me live forever.

My torture is thrown;
My Torture is thrown.

My torture is thrown;
My Torture is thrown.

Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell!

Down vain lights, shine you no more,
No nights are dark enough for those
That in despair their lost fortunes deplore;
There let me live forever.

My torture is thrown;
My Torture is thrown.

My torture is thrown;
My Torture is thrown.

Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell,
Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell,
Learn to contemn light;
Happy, they that in hell
Feel not the world's despite.

Hark you shadows, there let me live forever.

[Lyrics from John Dowland's (1563-1626) "Flow my tears"]
