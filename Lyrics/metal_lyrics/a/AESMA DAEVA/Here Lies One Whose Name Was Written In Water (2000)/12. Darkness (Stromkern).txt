Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell,
Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell,
Exiled for ever, let me mourn,
Where night's black bird (her sad) infamy sings.

Down vain lights, shine you no more,
Down vain lights, shine you no more,
Learn to contemn (lights).

Where night's black bird her sad infamy sings,
There let me live forlorn, never may my woes be relieved.

Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell,
Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell,
Exiled for ever, let me mourn,
Where night's black bird (her sad) infamy sings.

Down vain lights, shine you no more,
Down vain lights, shine you no more,
Learn to contemn (lights).

There let me live in shadows that in darkness dwell.

Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell,
Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell.
