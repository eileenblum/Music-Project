Do I know you from this cold life?
Soulfull filling love
Colors like no one
I feel I met you before this life

I will find you
I will find you

I met you before I was flesh
only you are real look beyond mankind
We walk beyond the thoughts of man
I will find you
I will find you

And if a soul is to know a soul

We walk the same spiritual land
You are my twin flame we need you to be
We wake beyond the world of man

When we meet again this journey will end
When we meet again this journey will end
I know you are there just reach out my hand
The warm harbor of truth you send

And if a soul is to know a soul
It must speak!
