I sing of the muse
I sing of the muse
My oar strikes the sea

I sing of the muse
I sing of the muse
My oar strikes the sea

Christ Christ can't save me
Christ Christ ran from me

I'm facing the gods
I'm facing the gods
So let the myth begin

Christ Christ can't save me
Christ Christ ran from me

Part II of Origin

Bring meaning to my life bring darkness into light
Were from the dust of stars how much truth is there to life?
Will the glories of Greece bring order to this life?
I myself when young did ask the saints of life
They said he wept for me a crown of shame for me
Will the glories of Christ bring order to this life?

Come walk the edge with me

The glory of Greece destroyed by our fathers
Most have Jerusalem
Who needs Athens

The storm of my birth the haze here after
Most have Jerusalem
Who needs Athens

Come walk the edge with me
The truth is lies in me
The force that forms and shapes brings order to this life
Now ask your saints of life
Now ask your saints of life
