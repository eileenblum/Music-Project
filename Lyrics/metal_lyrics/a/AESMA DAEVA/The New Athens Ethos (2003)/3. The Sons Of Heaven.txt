Man kind asked star light
Man kind asked star light
Those who heaven helps we call the sons of heaven
They do not learn this by learning

Those whom heaven helps we call the sons of heaven
They do learn this by learning

I will join the cursed on the lathe of heaven
I will find the cursed on the lathe of heaven

I myself when young did ask the world of this life
I came out the door that I went in.
