Since recorded time and since the dawn of man,
there have been three types of men.

The low man to the high man

The rending of the world into three great superstates
was long foretold in the halls of men.

A floating fortress guards the secrets of the ocean ways,
fending the floodgates from the sword of truth.

Since the machine!
The meek and low christen the kingdom's coming,
building the great machines of war.
Men feed machines this century of dark
coming of the hour of the kingdom of night.

Dies irae. Dies illa, solvet saeclum.
Dies irae. Dies illa solvet saeclum in favilla.

The act of war, destruction; mankind cannot grow stronger.
The act of war, destruction; mankind cannot grow stronger.

Teste Orwell cum sibylla.
Quantus tremor est futurus.

Keep the wheels of knowledge turning.

Power battles power battles highest hopes of men.
Smell horses breath and the sweat for lies.
Three times I dreamt this verse; three times I cast my curse,
as was foretold in the halls of man.

Since the machine!

Since recorded time and since the dawn of man,
there have been three types of men.
