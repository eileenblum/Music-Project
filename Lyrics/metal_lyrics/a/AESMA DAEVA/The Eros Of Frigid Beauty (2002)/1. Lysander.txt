Lysander
I pursue, I pursue invain
Cruel Lysander
Thus to fly me, thus to fly me

Let this begin

She must not, she must not obtain him
She must not, she must not obtain
Never, never, never, never must obtain
Frigid beauty

Who are you that you would deny me?
Who will, who will still deny me?
Deny me, deny me!

Lysander
I pursue, I pursue invain
Cruel Lysander
Thus to fly me, thus to fly me

Lysander

Lysander
I pursue, I pursue invain
Bring, bring
Bring, bring
Bring, bring
Bring, bring
Bring my trusty arms
