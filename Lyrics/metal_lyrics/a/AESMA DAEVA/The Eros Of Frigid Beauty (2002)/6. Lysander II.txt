The frightened earth looks pail and cries
It cries as war does consume the skies

My armies already join the battle above
The god of war fights the god of love

Stand firm my battalions, stand firm
The tyrants shall yield

Hold the line, hold the line
Hold the line

Stand firm my battalions, stand firm
The tyrants shall yield

They fly, they fly
My archers fly

Consume, consume, consume the whole world
Consume, consume, consume the whole world
Consume, consume, consume the whole world
Consume, consume, consume the whole world
Since she is burning

Frozen beauty lies blind in ice, no eyes to see
I've always been and always I shall be
