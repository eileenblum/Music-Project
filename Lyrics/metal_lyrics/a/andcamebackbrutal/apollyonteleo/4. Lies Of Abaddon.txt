I stand firm
But I am the CEO of the World Wide Web
I hire and fire and let complacency
But I am the CEO of the World Wide Web
I hire and fire and let complacency
lead you like a dance, you obey
And climb Jacob's ladder
Your steps harbor innocence
But your feet become mine
as you scream for help. but you cant get out
because the changes that youve made to have your eyes sewn shut
where is your god where is now where is he now?
Who's all listening???
LIAR!
You're in my grasp
You're in my hands
I breathe embers from my master, now time to watch you quake
Your knees split and I watch you fall
You seem to have forgotten this one thing
No one will end your suffering
Even you breathe, you see, and you hear the words that I speak
Hear the words I speak...

Well look where you're standing
Look where greed's gotten you now
I fear nothing!
Even as I bleed I watch your descent
And clinch the noose and break goes your neck
My limbs may be torn
But your broken with no death
And clinch the noose....AND BREAKS YOUR NECK
