He is the alpha and omega

Te beginning and end we are just miniscule beings
a spec on this earth and our life is but a glimpse.

Cleanse these sins make me whole again and
Burn my flesh so i breath your fire.

Its time to teach the masses who who fear
give or take 70 years to meet the maker
even he who prowls around in search of your stumble fucking answers.

I wont let the rocks cry out any-longer im scorching this earth
in your fire tonight.
