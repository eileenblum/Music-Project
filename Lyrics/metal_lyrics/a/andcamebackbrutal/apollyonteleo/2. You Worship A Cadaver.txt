Worthless speech into the sky grasping the air at what is alive you think something is there praying pity on your life welcome to reality

This earth is all you got and you're worthless with your brain all tied in knots you say I worship a cadaver but you're wrong

I feel sorry to know that the famine of the earth has made you believe all that's left skin bone and flesh is all u see so blind to the big picture.

Our lives mean nothing and your flesh will rot along with everyone else's you thought mattered when all is done this universe will implode

Without even a thought to your pitiful existence .
you give your life for an empty shell a lost cause that is
your own life for u I feel pity for you I feel sadness, to think you're life is 70 years with nothing to show then

3 bastard children idling to you is without cause .
3 bastard children idling to you is without cause .

So step up to the plate
And show me what you've got
Prove me wrong

And with nothing to show nothing to look forward to you worship a cadaver
And with nothing to show nothing to look forward to you worship a cadaver a flesh being in your own existence.
