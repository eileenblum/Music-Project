We used to be so close, now we're to the point of no return...I could never help you live this lie. Even though you're sinking, it's too hard to say good bye.You can't sleep, all you wanna do is dream of better times.When did you become so damn weak?

I don't know you anymore. I can't find a way to bring you back.

I'm afraid that you'll kill yourself one day. But I can't decide the choices that you make.You're fading, you're weak, all you wanna do is scream "Fuck the world!"

Your grasp on life keeps getting weaker and the grave you dug is only getting deeper.

I don't know you anymore. I can't find a way to bring you back.

Who are you and what have you done with the person that I've come to know and love?

It's not the end of everything me and you will go through. It's just that we used to be so close and you strayed too far to the point of no return. I can't stay to watch you burn.
