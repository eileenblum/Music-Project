I can feel that this tension is growing. How can I stop it when I don't know you anymore or how you really feel about me? It's alright we can't see eye to eye, but haven't you ever heard of compromise. What will you do when there's no one left to blame?

Open your eyes. You may think you can see but you're blind to the truth and your ignorance is killing me. So go all alone. I will still be waiting here when you want to come back home. You think you know everything and you think you can really make it. so go. 

We both think we're right when everything's all wrong. Set these differences aside, go back to the days when we were young and naive. Can't you see i care for you so much? But i guess that's not enough. 

Open your eyes. You may think you can see but you're blind to the truth and your ignorance is killing me.

You think you know me but you never will. (Don't even try) How can you judge me when you don't know your self. Don't let this go under. If you're gonna give up then you're just like the others.

Open your eyes. You may think you can see but you're blind to the truth and your ignorance is killing me. So go all alone. I will still be waiting here when you want to come back home. You think you know everything and you think you can really make it. So go. 

If you decide to take this away, then in the end you will have hell to pay.
