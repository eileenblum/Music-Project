I'm upset I can't be your everything. It's been said nothing good can ever last. And no matter what we do, it's always the same old story. What were you expecting? There's no such thing as happy endings...

I will not let you tear me down. This is not the time for playing games, so why don't you just stay away.My heart is holding all the doubt. Back and forth, why can't I make up my mind?

You've got my hands tied behind my back. How has it come to this? Now that it's finally over, I can't stop loving you after what we've been through. The only thing I have to say is that I'll never leave again. There's nothing more that I can do 'cause i can't stop loving you.

Please don't make me decide between you and my mind. 'Cause right now I'm losing both. You've got me in the palm of your hand so let's take a chance, we've got nothing to lose. My heart is made of paper, it's yours so tear it up. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. This fire baby, it will burn us both. These memories could never be erased.

I will not let you tear me down. This is not the time for playing games, so why don't you just stay away. My heart is holding all the doubt. Back and forth, why can't I make up my mind?

I can't stop loving you.
