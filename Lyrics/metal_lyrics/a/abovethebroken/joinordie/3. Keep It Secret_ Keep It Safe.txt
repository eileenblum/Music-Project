No regrets! I took it with the good and the bad, and I loved every second. Come back to me, back to the place you could never leave. When we were all care free. How could I be so carelessly oblivious to all of this? Now I'm finally feeling it... I think it's called happiness. 

Take me back to the place where you will remember me. Looking back we can make this more than a memory.Hold on, 'cause i'll never let you go.Take me back to the place where I can learn to believe...

That things are not the way they used to be. How could we be fine when our lives were so out of sync?At least I'm trying to get my life back on track. All I wanna know while you're passing by is... what do you have to show for all this wasted time? Is that all you've got, keep up with me. Pick up the pace!

Come back to me, back to the place you could never leave. When we were all care free. I'll be waiting here with open arms like time had never passed at all.

Take me back to the place where you will remember me. Looking back we can make this more than a memory. Hold on, 'cause i'll never let you go. What will it take to make you believe I'll sweep you off of your feet?

(Off your feet!) I'm so sorry, but there's no time for apologies or regrets. This is just the end and I'm a fucking mess. But you said: "It's all temporary... look down the road and you will see things will all get better. So pull yourself together."
