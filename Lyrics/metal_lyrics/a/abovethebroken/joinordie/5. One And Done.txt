No! This can't be, I can't breathe. This is too much to take at one... Time, and time again you decide to fuck me over. When will you learn I am not a person that can be ignored. I don't think this this will ever end. 

Finally I think that it's time... To put my foot down and draw the fucking line. I should have seen all of the signs.

Sadly I still don't know why... was it so you could watch me fall? 'Cause you left me hanging by a thread.

And you think that I could be ignored? Well you were wrong!

We will never be the same. Pray we won't meet again for your sake.

Finally I think that it's time... To put my foot down and draw the fucking line. I should have seen all of the signs.

Yeah, I don't know if I'll live through this. What we used to have is something that I'll miss. You were my family, how could you do this to me? The person that I used to be died with "you and me." So go and have your sloppy seconds this one's on me. Don't act like nothing's happening.

I should have seen all the signs... It was you this whole time.

You were my family, how could you do this to me?
