Fuck. It's not about the rivalry, I just want to see the terror in your eyes. So join or die. Take my hand, you're on the edge of oblivion. When it ends you'll be okay. We took it back, don't take it away. So tell me, are you really listening? All you want is fame and glory but you don't know what it takes... BITCH. You either have it or you don't. Fuck what you know.

Just walk away, I'm only offering once. This is your chance now take it and run. And do you really think you'll make it out their on your own? You've lost your way, this is the moment you leave or you stay. Just shut your mouth and say goodbye. This is your last chance.

Now it's time to pay the price for this. You're so damn selfish even after all we've done. Beg for forgiveness and you might be redeemed.This is a world that you don't know. The more you resist the deeper you will...GO.I can't sleep when you're constantly breathing down my neck. If you're not with me then stay the hell out of my way.

Just walk away, I'm only offering once. This is your chance now take it and run. And do you really think you'll make it out their on your own? You've lost your way, this is the moment you leave or you stay. Just shut your mouth and say goodbye. This is your last chance.

I can't believe that you choose this over me. Take back your lies, take back your memories. I will not find what I need in you.
