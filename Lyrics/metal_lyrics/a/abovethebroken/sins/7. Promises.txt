There's not a single day that this pain hasn't washed over me
i wonder if it will ever fade but i don't think it ever will
good bye old friend you died with my innocence
there's nothing you could do
in the end you do what you're told
so i'll stay young, i'll stay young while you grow old
we saw a future full of light and hope
that's a life we can never live
good bye old friend you died with my innocence
there's nothing you could ever do
it burns in you, it burns in me
deep down inside we struggle to be free
like on a tide we begin to drift apart
the paths we took are so different
maybe they will lead us to the same end, and maybe not
but nothing, nothing will tear us apart

this is more than just a game you could play with my heart
i don't think you understand this is tearing me apart
the friend you had in me has been washed away
maybe now you will believe this is what we really need 
after all we came to be you had to ruin everything
the life you used to lead will just fade away 

I'll just watch you fade away
