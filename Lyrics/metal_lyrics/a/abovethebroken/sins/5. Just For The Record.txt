Is this how you're going to repay me?
you cannot change what's been said and done
so just hold your tongue and i'll hold my grudge
your dead to me but you haunt my past
I gave you a life but i can take it back
you sold me out, you ran and hid

can't say i wasn't warned

I just can't believe you would do this to me after all we've done
our hands have been washed clean and we've been given the chance to move on

The flames of hate will burn us both
but the fire that runs through my veins 
it fuels my rage and it will seal my fate
you used to be like a brother to me 
but you're knife in my back has no sympathy
We spent all this time, now it's come to this

Can't say i wasn't warned

I just can't believe you would do this to me after all we've done
our hands have been washed clean and we've been given the chance to move on

Are you afraid to look in the mirror?
Are you afraid of what lies in the future?
You should be

I just can't believe you would do this to me after all we've done
our hands have been washed clean and we've been given the chance to move on
