If you think I have it that easy then you must be so naive
I cannot carry all your weight on my shoulders
Hold your head up high and stop playing the victim
There's nothing you can do except to give credit where credit is due
I've work my hands to the bone to get where I am today
you will have to settle before you fade away

Let me in, so I can understand the way you live your life
is this more than I can handle
I know this jealousy is more than you can take from me 
I'm just looking for some answers

there is no difference between you and me
there is no secret to the life that you seek
just know in the end, that we both bleed red

Let me in, so I can understand the way you live your life
is this more than I can handle
I know this jealousy is more than you can take from me 
I'm just looking for some answers

no one is perfect 
everyone has their own demons that they have to fight
