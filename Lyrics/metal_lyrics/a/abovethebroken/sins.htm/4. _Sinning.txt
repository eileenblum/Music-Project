When did I start to slip away?
I'm the monster you created
this is not what I want to be I will tell you just what I need
I need somone's help to get back on my feet
I'm no better than a beast but I have the right to live

My eyes have been waiting for so long to lay their sight on somewhere I belong
my heart has been waiting for too long to feel this way

I'm living life in a bigger prison, when did i start to slip away?

Save me from burning

My eyes have been waiting for so long to lay their sight on somewhere I belong
my heart has been waiting for too long to feel this way

Laugh and the world will laugh with you 
Weep and you will weep alone
