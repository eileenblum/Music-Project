You think you know everything
but take a look at my face
does it seem like i give a fuck what you think of me?
just walk away like you do with everything

I'll do this on my own, i will not stand for this, this is my only chance.
And I'm calling out for help now, when i needed you most you just watched me drown
i hope you know when this is over, you'll be left all alone with the world on your shoulders

And I'm calling out for help now, when i need you most you just watched me drown

The last thing I need is someone like you over my head
I'll do this on my own, i will not stand for this

And I'm calling out for help now, when i needed you most you just watched me drown
i hope you know when this is over, you'll be left all alone with the world on your shoulders
