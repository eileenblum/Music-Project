If you have a problem with me then speak up and say it to my face
there would be nothing that would please me more than to put you in your place
you two-faced bastard when will you see you're falling faster

I don't have anytime to waste to sit around and hear you complain 

you two-faced bastard when will you see you're falling faster
into your own grave

I try to keep my head above the water you know something keeps pulling me down
I can't belive this is why I even bother when all you do is run your mouth

It's not what you did it was something you said
behind my back to all your friends
God damn
how many times will this happen again
shut your mouth we cannot pretend that everything's alright 
everything's fine

I try to keep my head above the water you know something keeps pulling me down
I can't belive this is why I even bother when all you do is run your mouth
