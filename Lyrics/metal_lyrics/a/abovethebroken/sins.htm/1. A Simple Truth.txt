Can't you see this is all I've known, don't fear for me i will reap what i have sewn
i will succeed no matter what it takes
I know you'll always care for me, but i'll leave eventually
you will always care
trust in me and let me live
'Cause i'll never stop, 'till i reach the top
i just need you to remember

i will not let you down no matter what they say
i will not let you fall right by your side i'll stay
if you believe in me, i'll face the simple truth
no matter what it takes i'll make my dreams come true
you were the only one who believed in me

things are getting harder but we can't let our dreams die
We can never let our dreams die

if you believe in me, i'll face the simple truth
no matter what it takes i'll make my dreams come true
you were the only one who believed in me
