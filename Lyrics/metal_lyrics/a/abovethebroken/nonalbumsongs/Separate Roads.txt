Oh here we go, into the unknown
I wish things were different but fate can't be controlled
If sacrifice is what it takes
Then losing you is the sad price I had to pay
We all had our reasons
Things come and go just like the seasons
Now that it's all been said and done it's time for us to go our separate roads

I made the promise that I'd never let it change me
We'll keep our heads up always looking on
Do you remember when we used to be nothing
Look at us now and how we stand so strong
I always knew that you would be the one to leave me
It always felt like you were moving on
Do you remember when we used to be something
I don't remember where it all went wrong

This is not the end of my dreams
I don't back down from anything or anyone (I'll never back down)
It took you this long just to lead me on
You tried to bring me down but it only made me stronger
You turned your back on me
You turned your back on me but what you couldn't see
is that I'm finally free
But the good times that we had are the memories that will last

This is not the end this is only the start
Live it up for tonight before it all falls apart
As I stare at the sky maybe just for tonight
I can tell myself it's gonna be alright
This is not the end this is only the start
Live it up for tonight before it all falls apart
As I stare at the sky maybe just for tonight
I can tell myself it's gonna be alright

I made the promise that I'd never let it change me
We'll keep our heads up always looking on
Do you remember when we used to be nothing
Look at us now and how we stand so strong
I always knew that you would be the one to leave me
It always felt like you were moving on
Do you remember when we used to be something
I don't remember where it all went wrong

This is not the end of my dreams
I don't back down from anything
This is not the end
This is not the end
