There is something that you're always running from
But you can't run from me
I am your conscience speaking and this is
What I see... I see the fear in your eyes
As you run &amp; hide
Your body's going numb, you're slowly dying on the inside

This feeling haunts me everyday
The only thing to do is pray

No one can save me from myself or this hell I've created
I'm trapped in my mind, it's a prison cell
When I become so jaded?

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Is there any point at all?
The reflection that I see
Only shines to show me
Better days and better nights,
And better times when I felt alive
The deception that I see
Has sadly taken over me
I cannot run, I cannot hide
I cannot find myself tonight.

I know, I know
This isn't easy
When you let go,let go
The pain stops
Because I know it's hard to see now
But I promise, it'll be okay
I know, I know
This isn't easy
When you let go,let go
The pain stops
Because I know it's hard to see now
But I promise you that we can change

Yeah!

This all makes me sick to my stomach
You can't run from your past so give it up
I see the void in my eyes, it's always calling
I hear the voice I try to hide, it's always calling
I can't always believe what's looking back at me
All these voices that I hear
Are they angels?
Are they demons?
Or the dark half that I fear?

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Is there any point at all?
The reflection that I see only shines to show me
Better days and better nights
And better times when I felt alive
The deception that I see
Has sadly taken over me
I cannot run, I cannot hide
I cannot find myself tonight.

I know, I know
This isn't easy
When you let go,let go
The pain stops
Because I know it's hard to see now
But I promise, it'll be okay
I know, I know
This isn't easy
When you let go,let go
The pain stops
Because I know it's hard to see now
But I promise you that we can change

I thought I can make myself change
Just give you're up worthless
No!
I'M NOT!
I CAN'T!

I can fight this

I CAN FIGHT THIS!
