War or death
birth or marriage
rite of passage
the dead will listen before burial
lamentations begin before funeral

the body of a sinless white
wishing reincarnation as a swan

called as a living body
kept in the cabin on the board for two days
talked and sang
weeper sitting on a stool at the head of the body
and to keep the cloth in hands
sometimes with eyes
sometimes in front of the mouth 
wondering of the deceased to live and remain in silence
dressed in white for departure
wake up cry begins at midnight
pondering why the deceased doesn't rise
lamentations for the coffin maker
what is created can only
lead to one assumption... death

on the third day saying goodbyes to the dead
the coffin was raised and all the chairs
in the house were repealed

funeral cries with hopes of a ease for the spirit to rise
no stones
just leaves on top and a small
hole from the surface to the coffin
so that the spirit may have passage

after the burial weepers come and look for the dead
behind the shed
in the woods 
then look for inside a house 
perhaps arrived as a bird to home before others
no more cries on the funeral meal...
