The gift  of speech I do not posses
only the words of confusion shall be revealed

sun and nature
father and mother of us all
respect for family
respect for nature

cleanliness of mind and body
celebration of the harmony
between nature and humanity

(being the power that infuses
the universe and everything in it)
how can ever be repayed the greatest gift...

only efforts through expanding
present day awareness
humble (not servile)
discipline
respect
love...
to live a good life in harmony
with great nature
