Farewell of the summer
longing for separation and tears of the rain
restless mind calms
I am humbly grateful
clear sky has fallen a step lower
feeling is more cosy
there's safety in autumn
soft autumn twilight

after frosty night I find the sun from soil
maple's golden skirt has fallen under the tree
illuminating the black soil

blaze of Ruska colouring still it's sheathing
before the arrival of Marras
(it is time to rest and calm down)
