Piercing flesh with a sound of twinge
cries of death was sung and so begins the washing of body
wash away the earthly filth so that the departed 
may be as while as a swan
dressed in white clothes and carried home
dignity your speeches and cries
for those who are dead still hear them

may wailer cry for the dead
wake
a great feast combined tales of life
singing and prayers for the dead before the great journey
cry for the dead wailer but no disturbance of peace at night

take greetings to the underworld
tell your stories of life...
