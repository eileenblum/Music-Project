What is lost from the times of elders wisdom?
So many unrevealed secrets...
enemy has buried them in deep depths of their rotten souls...
Is there a time for a new awakening

To feel hatred
to feel anguish
its like you live in eternal pain (yet I desecrate them all)
To hate my enemies
to make them suffer and bleed
that is what I creed and in the end is my joy...
