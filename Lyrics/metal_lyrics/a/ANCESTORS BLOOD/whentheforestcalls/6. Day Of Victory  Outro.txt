Holy spirits, gods and ancestors

(To the last breath the enemy has been slain, enemy corpses piled to be burned in honour for the fallen brothers, raise your cups and hail the fallen ones!)

Mighty celebration for the day of victory

Rest and feast brave warriors
Your fighting is over tonight
And tomorrow you shall again meet your enemies
(The battle is won, but the war still reigns until the day of great victory)
