Can't you hear the echoes through the wind
And feel the warm summer breeze upon your skin

Embrace the winter (the frozen snow realms)
Embrace the autumn (the winds of chaos)
Embrace the spring (awakening of earth)
Embrace the summer (the mighty sun)

Towards the end of the seasons
Towards the end of the nights and days

What once was will never be the same
Only the nature prevails...

(Seek the truth and wisdom through your heart, cleanse thy soul with the knowledge of the ancient ones)
