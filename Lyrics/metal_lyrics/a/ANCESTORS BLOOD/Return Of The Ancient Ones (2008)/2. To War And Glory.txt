Rain pours down
The final moment, the final breath to take
Awakening from (the deepest) thoughts
My heart pounds
But not by fear, but by hate

It is a new days dawn and the gods have
Brought the storm, their final blessing
Lightning strikes down upon
The enemy. Many of them are now dead
The moment has come
The sign has been given
Time of all the enemy to die
And the holy four winds are
Whispering: Thou are today vicorius...
