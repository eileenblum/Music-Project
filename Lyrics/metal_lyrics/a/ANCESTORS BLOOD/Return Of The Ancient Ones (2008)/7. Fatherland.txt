Land of the thousand lakes
Land of the beautiful sights
(every part of you is so different, always new and fresh)

Many enemies have tried to submit thy powers
Under their will but always you have hold your ground

O, (mighty) Fennia
Land of the greatest powers that can be wielded
The mighty shamans and brave warriors are
Standing by your side

Thought times and dust our ancestors have
Always shed their blood when needed for fatherland

People of north
People of sisu
(and the holy sauna)
