All the hatred
All disgust
All the things that envokes my darkest side
I don't need no one to see what I feel
(cause the gods are always by my side)
There are no more limits
People are only outside, never inside

What can they achieve if dead are already their thoughts
Gods will punish the weaklings and bury their
Rotten flesh in the deepest pits
Out where no glimpse of light nor hope never reaches

(Honor the gods, love your woman
and fight for your fatherland!)
