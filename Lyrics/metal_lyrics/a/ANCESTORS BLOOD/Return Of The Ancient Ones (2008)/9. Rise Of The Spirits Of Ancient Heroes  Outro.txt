Spirits of ancient heroes, rise
I summon thee to come forth and grant me with
The holy powers
Let me be the flesh that wields your swords of revenge
Brave men who lived in those days are not forgotten
Heroes will once again emerge
And the holy spirits shall awaken
From their slumber to aid them in battle
Weapons and shields are forged
Now the enemy is approaching
...arrows flying,
Plunging the enemies
Swords cutting the flesh
No one spared
Priests are sacrifised to the gods
(for the great warriors who
have gone to the underworld, we salut you
and you who fought along our side will be remembered)
