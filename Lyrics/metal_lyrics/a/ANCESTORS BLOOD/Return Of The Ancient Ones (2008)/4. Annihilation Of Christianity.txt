Under the cover of darkness we ride
Nothing to be spared, only ashes and flames
Fulfilling the will of my gods
Purification from the scourge (eternally)

Black is the night
Dark our way (towards the night)

Wraith in me...
The hunger for devastation (against them)
Desecration reigns supreme (in their holy temples)

My heart, it cries for vengeance in my fathers name
Pain that rottens inside... (and shall never give me peace)
