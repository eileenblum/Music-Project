This world was never mine
It was cursed by those who brought the eternal
Struggle those who live their lives in total vain
Destroyed the holy tree of life (so the dead leafes are falling)
But a new emperor and order shall arise from
The ashes and scars

Crush the unholy faith
Burn their book of lies
Kill those who will stand by the crumbling
Cross of weakness

The withered tree will once again spread its
New roots deeper in the soil
(and thus create a new fountain of life gods have blessed
the emperor and he will bring us out from the shadows)
