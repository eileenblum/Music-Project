[Van Drunen / Daniels, Van Drunen]

Lust is our motive
a divine gift
burning sensations
let your mind drift
lust awakes feelings
we usually hide
lust is desire
sets your soul on fire

Lust gives ecstasy, lust is a thrill
hidden emotions, allow you to kill
lust is combition, lust brings greed
lust will show you what you need
lust for passion, lust for sex
lust for life and lust for death
lust is infinity, lust is our beast
reflectiong mirror of forbidden feasts

Lust creates frustrations
burning psychic pains
manic depressions
will drive you insane
put your mind open
enter yourself
discover the savage
behind its mental shell

Lust is our freedom, lust is our curse
lust will guide us for good or for worse
lust is a tear, lust is a smile
anger and joy dance on in your mind
lust is a woman, lust is a man
war between sexes, who understand?
that we're still children
when our spirits break free
