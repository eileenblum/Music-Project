[Van Drunen / Daniels, Van Drunen]

I am the heritage
From the years of corruption
I'm on the intelligence side
I have no identity or nationality
I'm the one who chances the tide
I've got no real name
Revolution is my game
And there will be mercy to none
I'm like the pest
I will never rest
'Til all the cleaning is done

I am the nightmare of all systems
The anger burns deep
A perfect killing machinery
Hey Mr. President get some sleep

Hijacking in the east
A murder in the west
For the good cause it's all justified
A killing in the north
A bombing in the south
Another couple of bastards died
No negotiations
Or worthless conventions
I throw over regimes by force
I'll butcher world leaders
With arms that they feed us
And no one can stop this man's war

I'll tear apart your society
Change the course of history
Time to break their passivity
End their bullshit diplomacy

I'm gonna end up in fucking prison and...
...and in hell!

Beat the bastards down!

Justice, terror, reforming the world
Raging fury burning every state
Bullets, mines, explosions, bombs and guns
Gonna make them eat their nude air waste

I am the annihilator
I control the detonator
Smiling as I push it down
I blow up your embassies
Undermine democracies
I even will hunt for the British crown
I precisely aim
At the life that I claim
The bullet will enter the head
Confusion all around
But I will not be found
World near my serenade in lead
