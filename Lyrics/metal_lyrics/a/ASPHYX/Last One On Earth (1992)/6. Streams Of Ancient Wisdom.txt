[Daniels, Bagchus / Daniels, Bagchus]

Streams of ancient life
flowing down below
visions of the past
enter your mind
the past goes by
as you sleep at night

Journey of forgotten souls
through the ancient night
walking through
as you scream temfied
those who once were
cry out to you
the past goes by
as you sleep at night
