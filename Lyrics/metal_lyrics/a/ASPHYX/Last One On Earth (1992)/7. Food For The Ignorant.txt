[Van Drunen / Van Drunen, Daniels]

Two religions both so wrong
but both will preach they'll make you strong
one means evil, the order good
terms I never quite understood
two opponents with so much in common
the choice is yours, angel or demon

Holy or unholy, written in black and white
theories coming from books of dirty lies
different views on life, the magic word is fear
two sides simplicity. Am I satan? Am I God?
Idolatry that's floating on rivers filled with blood
history covered with hypocrisy and pain
the souls of unawareness are what they want to gain

Sacrifices, ceremonies, desecrations
tranquility, blasphemy, desperation
divinity, impiety, indoctrination
afterlife, eternity, mind consumption

Food for the ignorant
for those who do not know
but I learned enough in life
to see right through your show

Hold your flock in a sacred embrace
forbidden pleasures for the bastard race
glorification on the supreme mind
suffering redeemer, saviour of mankind
hollow words from a church that's almost dead
empty views out of an empty satanic head

I get sick from hearing all your shit
I believe what I want and I'll stick to it
no one in this world can make me change my ways
why don't you fuck off if you're got nothing to say
