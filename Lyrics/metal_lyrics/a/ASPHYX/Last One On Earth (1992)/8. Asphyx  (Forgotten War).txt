[Van Drunen / Daniels]

Marching into battle
to a war you do not know
read the fearfull faces
make them look so old
the homefront says its prayers
wishing them all well
but they will never return
from this bitter living hell
the trenches are awaiting
cold and moisty graves
obey the insane orders
a soldier is a slave

They will die in the war
between all the filth and gore
is there any glory
in this heroic story

Look at the ones who cause this
and analyze their games
you'll find that they're all guilty
wallowing in their shame
elected by the people
by promising a war
but now you've seen the butchering
you don't want it no more

Politicians hiding
cowardly stinking scum
display of all powers
in the war they've just begun
planning defense budgets
guess who gonna play
think I'll start the uproar
and sweep them all away
