[Lyrics: Van Drunen / Music: Daniels]

Her name it means power
her silhouette brings fear
no mercy for the dreadnought
when the sight at sea is clear
she's defying every dancer
through mist, ice and snow
dominates the oceans
and its depths below

She spreads terror and death
when her cannons spit lead
she the ruler at sea
gladiator of steel

In a dark and misty night
she went for open sea
slipping through the allied maze
whose radar couldn't see
now the deadly game begun
with the home flee on her tail
and in the demonstration
she sank the hood and the prince of waves

Steaming on with dignity
continuing her mission
enjoying every victory
reloading the cannons

Solemn iron majesty
goddess of destruction
with her banners high
to the last confrontation

Seventy-one torpedoes
couldn't sank the battleship
The Bismarck become
rudderless because of one lucky hit

She was to proud to bow
sunken by her own crew
now the glory lives on
gladiator of steel
