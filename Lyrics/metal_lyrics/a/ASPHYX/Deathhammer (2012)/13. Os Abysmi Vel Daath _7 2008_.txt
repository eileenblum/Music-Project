[originally by Celtic Frost]A pallid sun sheds dimmest glow
On mute and pallid soil
I am the one, a life long gone
A refuge raped in search of life
Like a shadow on this earth
In embraces pale as human flesh
I am unborn, and I'm undone
How much of me is lost

I deny my own desire
I deny my own desire
Lying one among the liars
I deny my own desire

Dark in darkness I can see
Nothingness is blinding me
Os abysmi
Os abysmi
Os abysmi
Os abysmi

I'm drowning in this sea
For those I loved I hurt
So you taketh from me
My name untold and numb

I deny my own desire
I deny my own desire
Lying one among the liars
I deny my own desire

Where I am there is no thing
No God, no me, no in between
Os abysmi
Os abysmi
Os abysmi
Os abyss

I deny my own desire
I deny my own desire
Lying one among the liars
I deny my own desire

Os abysmi
Os abysmi
Os abysmi
Os abyss

Os abysmi
Os abysmi
Os abysmi
Os abyss
