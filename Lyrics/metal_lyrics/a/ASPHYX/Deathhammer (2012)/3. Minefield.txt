All await the signal
The dead of night
Regiments rise up
To storm before light

Out of the trenches
Run into the black
Anxious the many
That will never come back

Zig zagging soldiers
Bayonets on
Onward to victory
Before the dawn
Murderous crossfire
Bright shining flares
Machine guns mowing
Troops in despair

Crawling through barbed wire
Into no-man's land
Soil soaked in blood
The crying of men
Terror unveiling
In between the lines
They scream mutilated
Detonating mines

Trapped in this minefield
Invisible death
Desolate wasteland
Corpses without heads
Mounted leftovers
Bones splintered, they lie
Distant explosions
Herald how all die
