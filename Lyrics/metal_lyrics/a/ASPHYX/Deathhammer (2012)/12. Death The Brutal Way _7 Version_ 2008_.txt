Crushing at the Party San, hear the hordes rejoice
Filth to feed the Vermin, 'n beer to oil the voice
We'll beat your eardrums useless, and tie you on the Rack
Bones and nerves are grind to pulp, we are fucking back
Again we set the standards, get the message clear
Leave the fucking stage bitch, no room for you here
Mercy won't be given, as we enter our domain
Endlessly you'll suffer, on the altar of pain

Merchants of brutality, death our only rule
The doctrine of true metal, gods of the old school
Die by fucking Asphyx, ultra loud we slay
Skinned alive you humbly beg for death the brutal way!

Pouring molten mayhem, controllers of the saw
A liquid iron overdose, we'll have it fucking raw
Never shown respect for ya, spitting on your age
Turn the spotlights on, unleash the monsters from their cage
Feel the trembling earth, eating away your dignity
Watch the blood pour out as you lose virginity
We don't need no make-up, slugs from armored stacks
Honest to the core as we make you bastards crack

Merchants of brutality, death our only rule
The doctrine of true metal, gods of the old school
Die by fucking Asphyx, ultra loud we slay
Skinned alive you humbly beg for death the brutal way!

Hitting pandemonium, bring the sacrifice
Swallowing this dish of steel, diving in dry ice
Razorblades cut through your skull, painful as the pox
We'll break the fucking speed of light, the afterlife will shock
Order will be chaos, the watcher now will see
Born for immortality, eternity will scream
Pouring molten mayhem, controllers of the saw
A liquid iron overdose, we'll have it fucking raw

Merchants of brutality, death our only rule
The doctrine of true metal, gods of the old school
Die by fucking Asphyx, ultra loud we slay
Skinned alive you humbly beg for death the brutal way!
