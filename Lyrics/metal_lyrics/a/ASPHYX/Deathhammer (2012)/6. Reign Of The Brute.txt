global climate changes
damping permafrost
both world poles have vanished
icecaps forever lost
progressing mutation
forming a new race
improved evolution
altering earth's face

the gruesome breed is hatching
birth of perfection
pure terrific beauty
born for domination
logical natural fusion
of insect and reptile
equipped with intelligence
cruel, merciless and vile

billions rot in agony
in unbearable pain
mountains steam from roasted flesh
bones cover the plains
intensify the torment
terror absolute
as continents are drenched in blood
reign of the brute

8 ft. high tall termites
feast on human meat
rape the remnants of mankind
bearers of their seed
hear the last ones begging
with ripped out tongues they yield
broken impaled corpses
scattered on endless fields
