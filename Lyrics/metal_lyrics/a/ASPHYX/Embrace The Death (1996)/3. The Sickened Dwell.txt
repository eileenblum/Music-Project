Stench of Death welcomes you
In a crypt of agony
Dwelling in morbid thoughts
Awake, forgotton misery
Crawling maggots paradise
Rats consuming flesh
Hanging stiff on hooks
In the statement of his Eden
Searching for the truth
Root of life
Sickening experience
Reaper's knife
Sick, evil, god,
The abomination
Right, wrong, human
Beast, angel, divine, morbid revelation
Labyrinth of mind
