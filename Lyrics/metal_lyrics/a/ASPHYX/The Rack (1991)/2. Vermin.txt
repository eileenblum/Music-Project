Hordes of disgust
Hungrs, hasty, roaming at night
Red eyes leering
Apparitions of the darkest kind
Heinous rodents
The past of the modern
agglomeration
Living terror
Indestructable abominations
Symptoms of the fulminant deseases
The number of infected ones
increases
Inimical towards the human race
Death in it's most efficient way
Ghastly creatures
Enticed by decayed filth
Abjective vectors
Crawling in fermenting dirt
Seat in stinking slime
Malicious horror
Still unaffected by time
Spreading an awful and deadly
zymotic
Whole parts of mankind
contaminated
Bubonic plague, immortal enemy
Several populations attained
Verrucous corpses lie in the alley
Mephitic cadavers are rotting away
The livin covered with furuncles
Vermin, infesting another decade
