Words written in blood
And the book was bound in flesh
Rites from a distant mind
And the source was unrevealed
Pages in blood
Defiled words of truth and life
Invocation of the gods
The meaning of the seven seals
I have heard the unheard cries
Of a thousand dwelling souls
No one ever dared to go
Where the deceiver is the god
On a throne of thousand lies
And the wisdom never dies
Conjuration - Choronzon
Invocation - ritual defiled
In a land beyond my mind
An evil yet unseen
An evil that is called life
Spoken were the unholy names
Anger from behind the seven gates
I have seen the pleasures of the paradise
Pleasures known to the human race as sin
Pages in blood
Defiled words of truth and life
Rites came from a distant mind
And the source was unrevealed
