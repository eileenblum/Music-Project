Born to bow to the altar of the lord
Learn and pray
Watching you from above to dominate
Manipulate with this book
Caress an abstraction
It's only in your mind
Useless denial of reality
Diabolic existence
The root of evil is you
Centuries of inquisition
to burn your own mistake
Your eyes are the eyes of malevolence
Your horns are your faith and your cruelty
Your thoughts are corrupted with deceit
Honesty was burned at the stake
Agonize, brutalize crawl in disgust
the end of the truth is the beginning of your fate
The horns and the eyes of malice
Deceit is the name of the game
