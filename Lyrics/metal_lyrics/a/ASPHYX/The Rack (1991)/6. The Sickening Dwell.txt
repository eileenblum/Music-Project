Stench of Death welcomes
you
in a crypt of agony
Dwelling in morbid thoughts
Awake, forgotten misery
Crawling maggots paradise
Rats consuming flesh
Hanging stiff on hooks
In the statement of his Eden
Searching for the truth
Root of life
Sickening experience
Reaper's knife
Sick, evil, god,
The abomination
Right, wrong, human
Beast, angel, divine, morbid
revelation
Labyrinth of mind
