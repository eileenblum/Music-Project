i have this terrible urge
the need to take what is yours
a vulture circling in the sky
preying upon the weak

run away - you're my prey, fear my greed

the weaker you are the stronger I get
i feast upon your helplessness
show no mercy and have compassion
because this is your own fault
remember who started this?

don't be afraid to die

run away - you're my prey, fear my greed

my greed is here to stay
it will haunt you till the end of days

what do you think that will happen now
don't expect me to let go
my teeth in your neck, I'll suck the life out of you
just as you tried to do to me

don't be afraid to die

preying upon your weakness
like a vulture in the sky
the need to take what is yours
there's no way back for me

my greed is here to stay
It will haunt you till the end of days

run away - you're my prey, fear my greed
