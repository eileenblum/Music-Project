i can't control my bloodlust anymore
there's no way back for me
after all these years of pain and oppression
my eyes are now to see
the maggot that you are and i'll crush you
i'll crush your cenotaph

my sympathy is gone
my conscience passed away
it died yesterday

for years you squeezed the hatred out of me
until it consumed me
and when the gates to my soul opened up
there was nothing but darkness
so I can't control my bloodlust no more
there's no way back for you
after all these years of pain and oppression
my eyes are now to see

my sympathy is gone
my conscience passed away
it died yesterday

i'd like to see you beg
i'd like to see you suffer

but you died yesterday

you always had me beg
you always had me suffer

the torment lies fresh in my memory
the scars will never heal
so you had to suffer the ultimate anger
that tore your soul apart
and I licked the fresh-spilled blood of my blade
the work is done

my sympathy is gone
my conscience passed away
it died yesterday
