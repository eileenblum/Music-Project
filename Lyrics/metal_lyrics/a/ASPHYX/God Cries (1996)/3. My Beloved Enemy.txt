i have to get out of this godforsaken dream
and it's time to see my beloved enemy

your loved ones are the ones that stab you in the back
among the family is the judas
betrayal and apostasy are the things
that come your way
when greed overrules the blood

and now that I see the real you and the real me
your share is my thorn, a jackal is born

your loved ones are the ones that stab you in the back
among the family is the judas
betrayal and apostasy are tne things
that come your way
when greed overrules the blood

what turns people into vultures?
is it greed or is it in the heart?
my beloved enemy
close enough to hit me where it hurts

when will you know that you cannot betray me
because the blood tells me to punish my enemy

your loved ones are the ones that stab you in the back
among the family is the judas
pain and misery will come their way
when vengeance overrules the sense

you have to get out of your godforsaken dream
and it's time to see your beloved enemy

what turns people into vultures?
is it greed or is it in the heart?
my beloved enemy
close enough to hit me where it hurts
