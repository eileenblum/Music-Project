the masses are going to battle
and as we learn from history now
they'll all die tor nothing and nobody even cares

slaughtered in sodom

living your life on a battlefield
where no one knows your name
your head blown off by a thousand guns
to me it makes no sense

rage burning inside, and sometimes it explodes
now I got blood on my hands, I kill tor no reason at all

blood is my fuel, violence an urge and not a goal
in my own private sodom, the bloodshed never ends

two minutes to midnight, everything will go fast
you'll never know what hit you,
but this breath will be your last

god and satan are no opposites
they're one inside your mind
you can worship both or none
it doesn't change who you are
because sodom is a place far away in your mind
where pleasure and pain are united

sodom is here

take my hand and fly away
to the dark realms of ignorance
there's no way you can deny
that you've been ignorant too
in worshipping something that only exists
in your own mind
