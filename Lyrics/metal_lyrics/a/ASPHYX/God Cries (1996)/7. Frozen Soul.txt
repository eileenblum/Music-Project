a soul made of ice
and the invention of fire
didn't melt my heart
it got even colder
my soul remains frozen
as it has been for a thousand years

no feelings at all
you know I got no feelings at all
frozen soul

at the beginning of time
i was born
into a family of conquerors
destined to do death
stonecold obsession
for the destruction of life

you know that i'm the son of man
you made me to what I am
the fear of me is a product of your past
forever, that's how long I'll last

no feelings at all
you know I got no feelings at all
frozen soul
I exist-
by the grace of your coldness
by the grace of a breed of rats
by the grace of a god who failed
by the grace of the one you hail

you know that i'm the son of man
you made me to what I am
the fear of me is a product of your past
forever, that's how long i'll last

a soul made of ice
and the invention of fire
didn't melt my heart
i got even colder

no feelings at all
you know I got no feelings at all
frozen soul
