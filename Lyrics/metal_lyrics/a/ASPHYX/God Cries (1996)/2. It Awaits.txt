you're devastated by the fear of a horrible death
constantly anticipating on your last breath
thinking about the many times you've already died
nothing I could do and you know i've tried

you know what awaits
you know that it awaits

there you lie on your own rack
god gave you a nightmare, so you gave one back
the pleasures and the pains that were shown to you
you have enjoyed them and you know what to do

you know what awaits
you know that it awaits

get out of your hell
i try to reach you and get you out of that hell
but you decide to end it, all by yourself
will you have peace of mind, or will yon dwell

you know what awaits
you know that it awaits

and now it's over
you are gone and you won't come back
i feel that you are freed from this ungodly pain
the memories are there and they will remain

you know what awaits
you know that it awaits
