Entered with perturbation
Unexpected hospitable spirits
An experience by mortals
Threnodies and death-bells

Prevailing silhouettes
At this place of calamity
The ceremony, the exhibition

A lack of sounds
Idiosyncrasy scenes
Without any signs of tangible life

A detached world
The abode of the dead
Originated by transfigurations

Perceptions
Consciously carried out
The initiation into the ossuary

The shining light, subdued by obscurity
Gloryng in inauspicious atmospheres
The environs, ruthless and pertinacious
The ceremony, the exhibition

The unassailable leader of the initiation
Veiled in shrouds and dejected in prayer
The solemnity, surrounded by mysteries
The ritual of death, surrounded by non-attendanse

Prevailing silhouettes
At this place of calamity
The ceremony, the exhibition

A detached world
The abode of the dead
The initiation into the ossuary

Now admitted in the spirit world
No possible way out
Incarcerated in the ossuary
Damned to dwell forevermore
