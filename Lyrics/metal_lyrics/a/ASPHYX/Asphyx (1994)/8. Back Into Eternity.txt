Hazy prospects, londing for established order
The valleys are calling, fallen into oblivion
To reign and flourish at own environs
No settled conceptions, defined to earthly criteria

Shrouded in mystery, considering the return
To the depths, where the quick won't be allowed
Taken possession of souls and lost spirits
The evil task is fulfilled, needless to prolong the stay

Satisfied, the return has begun
To the valleys, the foretold shelter of evil
Assigned by the inexplicable symptoms
Roaming through the vast darkness

Searching, groping after the hidden passage
Despairing yet resolute
Longing for established order
To reign and flourish at own environs

Actuated by the intuition of beasts
Guided by the commission of evil
Now disappearing back into eternity
A release and relief for the terrestrial life

Back into eternity ...
