Destitute of concealment for ages
Vestiges, which meant earlier life
Again brought up on an unnatural way
Every stone, every grave, every remain,
Obtained with memories

Remaining from generation after generation
The valleys, where distant ancestors
Battled, triumphed and survived
They eventually became vanished
By the unpredictable forces of nature

Archaeology is the key
For the present generation
Scarcely or not suspecting
What could be damaged by mankind
It's just a matter of time
The same could happen to us
Presumed to be left alone
Like the valleys in oblivion

Powers from the long ago
Could be too strong
Curiosity of manking is
Always an imperfect danger
Attended with inexperience and cupidity

Valleys in oblivion ...
