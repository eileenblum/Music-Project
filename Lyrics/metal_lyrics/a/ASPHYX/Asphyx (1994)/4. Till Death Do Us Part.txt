The birth of life
A preternatural wedding
Between body and soul
The oath, we all have taken
Perilous to forget
Till death do us part

Cherishing each other
Through sickness and in health
For better and for worse
Till death do us part

Till death do us part
The harbour of souls, left behind
Till death do us part
Dissolving the covenant for life

Violation of the vows, death is soon to come
Divorce is final, your life is no more
Your flesh will decompose and return to nothing
Your soul will vanish to a place, where no man has gone before

No life or after-life
In the spirit world
Only Asphyx will know
Till death do us part

[Chorus]
