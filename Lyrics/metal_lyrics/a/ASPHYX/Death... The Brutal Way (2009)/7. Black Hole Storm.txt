A primitive phenomenon
Unknown in theory
Bursted from its quasar
Erractic mystery
Ouf of the supernova
Comes whate no-one could suspect
Invisible interior
Mortals can't detect
Supermassive entity
Primordial force
Chaos in cosmos
Upturn physical laws

Celestial bodies
In orbid collide
Satellites are drawn into
The continuum inside
Absorbing any matter
Interstellar dust
Univeses torn apart
Galaxies combust

Black hole storm
Electromagnetic
Black hole storm
Intergalactic
Black hole storm
Extinguish suns
Black hole sun
Armageddon

Bursting protoplasma
Thermal energy
Solar radiation
Crushing gravity
Inside event horizon
A surface in spacetime
Lies the point of no return
Where no light can shine
Mass devouring voyager
Consume infinity
Deafening roaring silence
Ending eternity
Vanishing in darkened spheres
The final glowing sun

Compressed to zero volume
All nuclei are gone
Black hole storm
