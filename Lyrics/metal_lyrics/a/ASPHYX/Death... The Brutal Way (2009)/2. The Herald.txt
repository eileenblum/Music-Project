The heralds 's arrival
From beyond outer spheres
Forecasting damnation
Doomsday is near

Hear his words of wisdom
Truthteling prophet
His appearance followed by
The dark cloak of death

In pathetic disputes
A race for oil and gas
Cremating in the cauldron
Incinerating fast
Arctic shrinkage
Drastic alteration
Chawing permafrost
Subsurface refridgeration

Poles are melting
A cascading release
Mankind's drowning
In oceans of tears

Reaching critical stage
Glacial minimum
High-explosive event
Ignite the methane bomb
Save humanity from pain
In afterlife fantasia
Spare the species their suffering
With global euthanasia
