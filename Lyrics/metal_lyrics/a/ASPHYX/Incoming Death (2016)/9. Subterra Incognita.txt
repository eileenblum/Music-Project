In sinister labyrinths
A world deep down below
Live the tunnel dwellers
The people known as moles

Network of forsaken caverns
Extensive catacombs
Compounds of several thousand
Who went down called it home

Small ordered societies
Efficient communities
Existing under the streets
Between rats and neglected hounds
Building thriving shantytowns
Underneath, underground
Foundations of humanity
In the bowels of the city
Establishing autonomy

Here is where you'll find the lost
The ones who failed and paid the cost
Where everyone bears his own cross

Illegal electricity
Anonymous pregnancies
Hidden away from charity
On the walls, occasionally
Decorative graffiti
Remarkable art galleries
Here they feel where they belong
Residents speak the same tongue
'Up top' everything is wrong
Degeneration process
Evolving nonetheless
In despair and hopelessness
