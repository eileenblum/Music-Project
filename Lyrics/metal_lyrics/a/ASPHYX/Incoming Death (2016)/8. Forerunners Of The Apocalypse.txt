Thundering stampede
Storming hordes
From the depth of hell
Born on the horse
Mongol warriors
Heralded by their stench
Advancing cavalry
To siege Urgench

Boiled and hardened leather
Steel plates in chest
Catapulting corpses
Infected with pest
Whisting arrows
Curved sabres slash
Battering rams
Resistance smashed

Massacre those still alive
Masters of genocide

Survivors of the carnage
Assembled on the plains
Calculated cruelty
All shall be slain
Methodical beheadings
Pile up the dead
Mass decapitation
Pyramids of heads
