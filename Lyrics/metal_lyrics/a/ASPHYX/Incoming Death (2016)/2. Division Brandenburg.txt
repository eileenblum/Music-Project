Phantoms in no man's land at twilight
Secretly behind enemy lines
Small units of Abwehr commandos
Assignment ultra-classified

Specialized in foreign language
For infiltration and espionage
Outstanding in hand-to-hand combat
Experts in sabotage

Capturing bridges
Securing docks
Seizing detonators
Wreaking havoc
In mountains and deserts
Arctic ice plains
Bleeding to death
And bled dry again

Receiving the highest decoration
Rarely mentioned in any report
Canaris' Brandenburg Divison
Simply disappeared after the war
