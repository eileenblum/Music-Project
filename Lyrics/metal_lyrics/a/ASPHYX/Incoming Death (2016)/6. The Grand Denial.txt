Packs of the Nippon beast, scavenging the East
Expansion of territory with primeval savagery
Decades in torment, a mourning continent

Women their first reward, pleads for mercy ignored
Coercion and abduction, dragged to "comfort stations"
An army institution deployed for prostitution

Forced into the brothels
Abused and brutalized
Whole families murdered
Daughters dehumanized

Commodified rape centers
Virgins, underaged
Raped, stabbed, beaten, starved
Enslaved and caged

Injected No. 606, containing arsenics
Tens of thousands died of disease or suicide
A life of constant pain, forever in shame
Apologies never made, and if ever, they come too late
