Through remote galaxies
Beyond cosmic rays
Unobserved phenomenon
Traversing nameless space
Outside the solar system
Unidentified zones
Hidden in Nebulae
Composition unknown

Intruding explored cosmos
The menace now exposed
With hypervelocity
And it spreads unopposed
Atmospheric entrance
Disaster imminent
Gigantic collision
Impact event

The surface penetrated
High megaton yield
Rotation mechanism disturbed
Collapsed magnetic field

It came from the skies

Global eruptions
Cracking crusts and plates
Acidic waters
Species disintegrate
Re-entry of ejecta
Radiation intense
Ecology disrupted
The Cenozoic era ends

It came from the skies
