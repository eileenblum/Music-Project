Sighting the chariots spreading their tales
A storm of fire taking land after land
Evoking a scenery of a joyful death
A skyline swallowed by the inferno's breath

Perished by the fist of steel
Waves of fire consuming the earth
The stench of war can be smelled
Spreading its message across the land

Shrouded in darkness and aiming to kill
Defying the odds, survival unknown
To hold the hordes is their will
Holding the line as they stand firm

The roaring of the guns is deafening to the ear
Steel strikes upon steel, flames reaching high
Penetrate the core, horrorfying sound
Destroy the demons, protected by steel

The ultimate feast on human lifes
Consumption of blood, bones and flesh
Shredded bodies, hanging in trees
The end of humanity, victory for thee...
