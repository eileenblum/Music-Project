Tasting the scent of obscurity
While adoring the wisdom unseen
Extract most fiendish emotions
From beyond the irrational world

Inhumanity caused by frenzied reactions
Shroud from visions of inhuman perfection
Evoking the tide of insurrection
The wake, disturbed by sulphurous dimensions

Absorbing mental energy
Transforming it into an inner sanctity
Caressing an entity
Raving divinity

Hollow shell, destructive spell
Denied by this mortal hell
Six feet under, cenotaph crushed
Casted back to the wasteland where you fell
