Feeding on angles of the human mind
We transform thoughts into mental food
Sucking the will out of your untouched soul
Your energy feeds our world

On the wings of inferno we thrive
The extraction of impiety we drink
The carrion of sanity we eat
The sulphurous air we breathe

A hallowed world, reality to some
Dimensions, grotesque, abnormal to thee
A spectre of  the wind, incantation of chaos
Beyond bewilderment, the realm unseen

On the wings of inferno we thrive
The extraction of impiety we drink
The carrion of sanity we eat
The sulphurous air we breathe
