From the deepest darkness of the spiritual dimensions
It came to proclaim the word of death
Darkness in all its blackened glory
Powerful and fulminate against the world of the living

The extinction of gods creatures and mortal paradise
Without any sanctified and compromises it achieved its goal
With the tools of devastation bringing the earth to roar
To conquer the weak and unbelievers, the strong and believers

Corrupting the minds of the mortals and tasting their freezing souls
The nightly frost will slowly devour their emotions
Yet the power of aggression will forever stay in their minds
As it is the only way to get hold of their upcoming intentions

Hear the rage and experience its presence
While roaming through wastelands of terror
Fear shall live on in every human soul
As the shrouded entity is gathering the bewilderd pale faces
While marching towards the styx...
