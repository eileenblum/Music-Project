A deadly perfection, skilled to kill
Draining the blood of the ones who resist
Our only aim is crushing
The damned must be wiped off the earth

Ruling by aggression, abstract vicious world
Our means are weapons created to kill
Insanity is the only way out
Uncontrolled and efficient causing the red lust

Through the speed of light we move in hellish rapture
Ignoring the rules of compassion made by mortals
Denying life, back to bestial basics
Decline of humanity, profane way of acting

(The)gods won't approve our acts, blasphemy of human doctrines
Marching with the breath of death, no life will be spared
The scourge of all, the bringers of hate, the flames are clearing our path
While spreading a hail of lead, laughing, smiling, joking

Cleansing our souls with the blood of the dead
Lust for carnal deeds
Mutilating hostile thoughts and acts, our ranks are decreasing
The few who live are outcasts of darkness
