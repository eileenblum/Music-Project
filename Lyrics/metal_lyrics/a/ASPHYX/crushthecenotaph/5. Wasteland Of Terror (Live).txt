Beyond the horizon
A frightened nightmare begins
The ultimate agony
Dimension of sin
Gateway to Death
Realm of darkness
Empire of chaos Engulfed madness
Wasteland of Terror
Blasphemous Land
Shadows in blood
The slumbering damned
Scream at the gallows As raven pick out their eyes
Eternal torment
Suffer in this paradise
Absorbed in insanity
Souls dwell in depths of pain
Roaring with laughter
As the dead die rattling again

Thanks to jonathan.m.berry for correcting track #3 lyrics.
