How many times you'd like
To say that it's the end
That you can't listen to
All those things they want you to

Your life is too short,
Time is running very fast
You'll have to strike back,
It's to late to repent!

Your long hair has
Always being annoying them,
The symbol of your life,
To them is just an illusion!

Centuries will pass by,
Only one thing will not change
Warriors we've been
And will be until the end!

Just like Samson,
With a sword in your hand,
Go fight them all!
Tame the lions!
Just like Samson
With strength in your hair
Go fight them all!
Fight them to death!
