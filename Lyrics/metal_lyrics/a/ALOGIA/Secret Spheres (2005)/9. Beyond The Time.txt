Where words lose their power,
Dissappear - There music starts.
The whole new form it gives me,
Calls me up - Above reality...

I'm opening strange new worlds
Carried by the hands of destiny,
Which take me up beyond the time...

Where awareness and dreams become the same
Beyond the start and the end!

Messages, signs and the magic
In the air - The vision starts.
The notes are playing
Games of fantasy - Maze of a genius.

I can feel ancient times,
They are so distant but so well-known to me...
I'm sailing to infinity...
