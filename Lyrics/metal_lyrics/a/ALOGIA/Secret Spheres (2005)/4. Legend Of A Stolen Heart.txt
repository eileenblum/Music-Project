It was an age of wonders
In a land far, far away
A beautiful queen was on the throne
Her kingdom had no end.
In her chest there was a heart
Beyond her knowledge it was made
A curse of darkness it contained
For her kingdom the very end!

Evil eyes knew all of that
Dark conspiracy has been hatched
The heart of beautiful queen to break
The dark lord a spell prepared
As I remember, my good friend
The dark lord has reached his aim
A terrible curse fell over land
Eternal darkness fouled the day

The Sun dissappeared
Heavens turned in the dark
Eternal sorrow and night
Had no end and no start.
Deep in the heart there's
A voice that still calls
I can hear it sometimes
In each of us it tolls
