I am the vengeance, a snake in disguise
Obssessed with dominance, obssessed with lies
I am the chaos, controller of minds
Perfect Machine, evil divine.

Look into my eyes and tell me what you see?
Fear and despair - your own destiny.
I am the strongest, I have the force.
Your life is mine without any cost.

Bleed, die, under command!
You're falling fast to hell and back!
Don't try to understand!
The politics of war games...

I am the patriot for cash and gold.
Making the money, making the war!
Who cares for peace I have my own wish!
Open the gates of hell, unleash the beast!
