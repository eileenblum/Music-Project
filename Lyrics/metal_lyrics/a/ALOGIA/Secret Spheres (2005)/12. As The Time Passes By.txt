As the time passes by,
You wonder where we're standing now
Are we in the eternity?

Someday when all of good days are gone,
You will realize where we are.

Is the nature cheating us
And everything is just a game
Or we are just a part of it?

Why does every story has its end
Is there a second chance
Or my feelings are deceiving me?

Are we far away from eternity
Or we can see
That it's here somewhere near?
