The clock is ticking, time is running out.
The world keeps turning every day and night.
So many circles, so many lies,
Darkness is falling in paradise...

I keep my dream deep in my heart.
It gives me hope, out in the dark.
I have to find a way how to survive,
To find some answers and reach out the sky.

Dreams! Visions!
So many things are deep inside of me!
Freedom! Wisdom!
Look into my eyes and you will see!

So many misteries and sleepless nights
Show me the way to live, wake up my sights.
Deep in my secret sphere I see the light,
I feel the fire, in rage we shall rise!
