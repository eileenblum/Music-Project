I still remember of those
Years that we had wandered freely
Under the stars in the skies of our destiny
And I still remember your smile
And your eyes full of sadness and tears
Things you said before you went for good:

My dear friends, I'll go now
Please listen this words I'm about to sing
Life is just like a beautiful
Dream it will end very soon
November day in the sky
Rainy clouds have covered all over the stars
Peacfully one of them have
Its beautiful dream dreamed away...

All fairytales are far away
All of our dreams are empty today
Some painful silence has covered our memories
And maybe you're looking at us
Maybe you're laughing with all of the stars
I see your eyes - beautiful glow up in the sky

We were friend 'til the end
Same dreams we dreamed together
And we haved flied
On the wings of eternity up to the stars
Never doubt until then
That you'll stay forever high in the sky
May the stars now watch you
Over up there instead of us...

Eternal glow
May reach of the corners of universe
May the time stop once again
Voice of youth may
Hollow the way of the shining stars
Please save a place for each one of us!
