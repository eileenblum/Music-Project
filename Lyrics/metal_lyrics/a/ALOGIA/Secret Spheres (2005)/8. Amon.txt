Thousands of ages
In the sand empire
Hidden secret lies
Night full of stars
Still knows the old damnation
Blood on the sand still cries!

May the eternal darkness doom
Every man who enters my tomb!

The crypt is standing
With the help of gods
To beat the eternal wheels of time
For afterlife is made up
To the sky eternaly!

In the sand of time
The hidden pharaoh's dreaming
The moment to be born again
Rebirth of Amon...

Rha... Come wake me up!
Gods of the Sun, forces of universe
Rha... Come praise me up!
Give me the strenght of immortality...
Rha... Come raise me up!
Gods of the Sun, forces of universe
Rha... Come raise me up!
