["Flashdance" soundtrack)]

FIRST, WHEN THERE'S NOTHING
BUT A SLOW GLOWING DREAM
THAT YOUR FEARS SEEMS TO HIDE
DEEP INSIDE YOUR MIND
ALL ALONE I HAVE GRIED
SILENT TEARS FULL OF PRIDE
IN A WORLD MADE OF STEEL, MADE OF STONE

WELL A FEELING, BEIN'S BELIEVIN
I CAN HAVE IT ALL, NOW I'A DANCING FOR MY LIFE!
TAKE YOUR PASSION AND MAKE IT HAPPEN
PICTURES COME ALIVE, YOU CAN DANCE
RIGHT THROUGH YOUR LIFE

NOW I HEAR THE MUSIC,
CLOSE MY EYES, I AM RHYTHM
IN A FLASH IT TAKE HOLD MY HEART

WHAT A FEELING (I am music now)
WHAT A FEELING (I am rhythm now)
I CAN HAVE IT ALL, NOW I'M DANCING FOR MY LIFE!

WHAT A FEELING (I am music now)
WHAT A FEELING (I am rhythm now)
I CAN HAVE IT ALL, NOW I'M DANCING FOR MY LIFE!
