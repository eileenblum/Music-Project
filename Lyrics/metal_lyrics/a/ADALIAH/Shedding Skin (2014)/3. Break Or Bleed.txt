I see my Dad glaring at me and by the hole in his chest I can tell he knows just how I feel
(With nothing to say)
Silenced, with nothing to say.
You have nothing to say
No peace of mind and nowhere to rest your dissonant thoughts that keep us up at night
I get a feeling of deep understanding
How do you get rid of whatâs already gone?
It seems so unmotivating to me to just move on
A constant reminder youâre living in fear, youâre staying up later for things you hold dear
I get a feeling of deep understanding, I feel like Iâve lost this fight
The sound of a voice youâll never forget slipping away
Repetition has gotten the best of me again
I try and stray from the cycle but these things are just so hard to ingest
You always seem to forget
How come you always neglect the things you say you will do?
Days seem longer as I sit alone and waste my time
I know thereâs got to be a way to simply feel alive
Anchored at the bottom of the fucking pile
This is not the place for me
Iâll break my way out
Just let me out, get me the fuck out
The only way to the bliss I know
I will break my way out
Just let me out, get me the fuck out
The only way to the bliss I know
Break or bleed , itâs clear to me the things I need
No longer will you hold me back from who I need to be
I canât keep up with all the shit you say
We can both agree that you will never see my face
Break or bleed
Itâs clear to me the things I need
