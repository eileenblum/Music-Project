Separate from everything that I hold dear
Iâm walking into everything that I fear
Thereâs only so much that I can bare
You know what they say, life is always unfair
I feel the woe as it grows, being torn from within
Anger truly exposed
Forget all Iâve ever been taught
Iâm not wasting time, itâs just a feeling Iâve got
Iâm not wasting my time
Iâm not wasting my life
Youâre supposed to guide me but youâre leaving me behind
I have put everything into this just to have you turn your back and leave me blinded like the rest
You forced me to believe that life is preconceived
I will not abide by this normality
Break free from expectation
Maybe then youâll find a life worth saving
Your doubt piles onto me
I wonât live your American dream
My head being torn in different directions
Your grip limits me through suffocation
I wake addicted to affliction
The frustration always wins
I feel it constantly
I feel it in my skull
Hiding underneath
I feel it in my chest
Always choking my breath
Always there to intervene
Nothing Iâve ever felt really compares to abjection
I will release myself from your fucking suffocation
