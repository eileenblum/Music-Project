I watched you walk as a dead man, pale skin
Blue lips, crystal balls behind your fucking eye lids
The color flushes from everything
But you keep that air pumping in and out unconsciously
Suspended by a string
I bet those blues keep you on your feet
Before the chair gives outâ¦and Iâm still sitting here calling you out
And Iâm still calling you out
Cast yourself to the darkest corners of your own mind
Self-doubt consumes you like no other
And now Iâm losing, losing you as a brother
I know youâre not afraid to die
I wonât be there to watch you go
I wonât be there to watch you go
And if you start to sink belowâ¦.I wonât be there to watch you go
Every day you keep yourself from doing what you say
Maybe I should stay, Maybe I should fucking stay
Keep your head down cause you just when to walk away
Iâve had enough and when you die I wonât be there to see the day
Iâll keep my head pointed at the sky
Lifted with affection that will not let you die
And if you start to sink below, just knowâ¦
I wonât be there to watch you go
I wonât be there to watch you go
And if you start to sink below, just knowâ¦
I wonât be there to watch you go
Cast yourself to the darkest corners of your own mind
Self-doubt consumes you like no other
And now Iâm losing, losing you as a brother
