It was all part of the plan
Just think a year from now you wonât remember my name
We hydroplaned
And I watched us crash and burn before we hit the wall
Stepping stones donât exist when Iâve fallen off a cliff
Selfishness, ignorance, fucking bliss
It wasnât enough, Iâm never enough
You say that you cared, Iâm calling your bluff
Iâll never be fucking good enough
I tried to erase you but the words smeared on the paper
I need aâ¦mind eraser
One so vile and abrasive that I wonât remember all the pain you put me through
This was all part of your plan
Itâs been a year and I canât remember your face
My minds gone blank but nothing feels the same
Memories replaced with the let-down of an empty promise
I should have called this from a mile away
But I was blinded by what was and what could have been us
And so Iâll stay awake at night haunted by the thought of years lost
And time spent caring for someoneâ¦
Who didnât give a fuck whether I was still breathing at the end of the day
I still canât believe how easily you dropped everything and pushed me away
So let me set this straight
I am everything you hate
Iâm the grime that lines your sink
Iâm the fucking demon seed
All I wanted was for you to fucking care for once in your selfish life
The time we wasted
The feeling of being alone, out in the cold
A misguided soul, destined to spend his life on his own
I hope youâre happy
Iâm standing here with a sense of regret for the things I have said
