Oh please I hope these wounds will stay with me. Like the words you left me with, I hope they scar.
I hope they harden in my soul so I never forget the unforgettable.
It hurts to see, so I don't bother looking anymore.
What a terrible chapter, what a horrible book.
I see dead flowers everywhere I look.
I can see the reasons for the cruelty of this world because of you.

Let's burn these pages, let's agree to burn these pages.
So I can stop myself from being out of line.
Let's burn these pages, let's agree to burn these pages.
So I can stop myself from being out of line.

So I can save myself, so I can get out alive.
Who's to say if you choose if I live or die?
Can you clarify the thoughts in my mind?
So let's burn these pages.
So I can save myself, so I can get out alive.

You're such a waste, a waste of skin. You're such a waste, from limb to limb.

You fucking waste, I can't stand to waste my time on the thought of you.
I'll rid myself of this old skin. I'm feeling lost, where have I been.

Oh please I hope these wounds will stay with me. Like the words you left me with, I hope they scar.
I hope they harden in my soul so I never forget the unforgettable.
So I never forget the unforgettable.

So I can save myself, so I can get out alive.
Who's to say if you choose if I live or die?
Can you clarify the thoughts in my mind?
So let's burn these pages.
So I can save myself, so I can get out alive.

So let's burn these pages.
So let's burn these pages.
So I can save myself, so I can get out alive.
So I can save myself, so I can get out alive.
Let's burn.
