Here I am again trying to forget the past but I canât pretend that it wonât make its way back
I canât look at you the same as I could before
Even though apologies were made I feel it more and more
In the back of my head lies memories repressed as I begin the salvage the happiness I have left
Too young to take in all the problems at hand but old enough to know exactly where I stand
Rebuild, rebuild
Iâll do whatever it takes to have my mind sit still
Cut you off cause Iâve had enough
Iâm sick hearing I need to âtoughen upâ
This is not the way that Iâm supposed to be
Iâm fucking drowning and youâre letting me
Please, no more
Iâm too far gone to float back to shore now
Youâre still reading the book but guess what?
I skipped to the last chapter
We all die at the end.
Regardless of the way you pretend that my best interest is at hand
Itâs just the way you pull me down
Itâs like I canât do a thing for myself without youâ¦
Pulling at my sleeves
All you want to do is drag to my knees
Pulling at my sleeves
All you want to do is drag me to my fucking knees
And now I find myself believing in fictitious heroes
Iâve come to know at the end of the day itâs just the way that the wind blows
I can only save myself without your help
So if this is what it has to come to, youâre another burned bridge under my belt
The calm before the stormâ¦forming around me, closing me in
The feeling begins
Here I am again trying to forget the past but I canât pretend that it wonât make its way back
I canât look at you the same as I could before
Even though apologies were made I feel it more and more
