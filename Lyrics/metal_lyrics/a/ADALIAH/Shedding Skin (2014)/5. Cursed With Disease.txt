[feat. Caleb Hatton]My insecurities will be the death of me
My insecurities are all I ever see
I canât seem to find the normal in myself
I live with burdens, I live with self-doubt
Unmotivated, just hanging on by a thread
It seems so selfishâ¦but sometimes I wish that I was dead or just in someone elseâs shoes
To see this world in a different view
I need something newâ¦

Cause all my problems keep raining down on me
They throw the chains around my neck and I can barely breathe

For three years Iâve felt like this
Iâve been searching for someone to bring me bliss and put me at ease
Iâm not asking for much just a sigh of relief
And when I saw your face that dayâ¦something told me that I would, Iâd be okay
You showed me a new way but now Iâm leaving and Iâll be back some other day
Please take me back
I want to release myself
I want to leave it all behind
Cause every day Iâm fucking losing my mind and waking up every day is such a waste of my god damn time
Straight to the bottle, it drowns my pain and in this sorrow Iâll slowly waste away
Iâm wasting away
Please take me away
Cause all my problems keep raining down on me
They throw the chains around my neck and I can barely breathe
