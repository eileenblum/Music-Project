Can you feel these phantom limbs?
These memories will stay memories that I no longer sway
Iâve fallen short and Iâm still broken from the path youâve chosen
I will no longer dread, I am no longer dead
You were never alone, it was all in your head
And I canât denyâ¦I canât deny my chest is swollen
I did this to myselfâ¦and Iâd go through hell for you and no one else
And can you feel these phantom limbs?
Here I am with hands behind my back
I will break the mold around me
You swear that I have changed but Iâm starting to stabilize
Your passion burns out
Only time will rid this shame that sits inside my brain
Reoccurring patterns never end unless something in here changes
Iâve got to fill empty spaces
Distractions and familiar faces
Itâs getting harder every day
Itâs getting harder to pretend that youâre still there
I guess I still believe in ghosts
All I do is stare but thereâs no one there
I guess I still believe in ghosts
