[feat. Storm Strope of The Last Ten Seconds Of Life]I canât get over the fact that itâs building up since the day we met
Say what you need cause you donât even know this is the last chance youâll ever get
Coming from your truest friend, I see why you turned and fled from all the things I never said
I kept my word I stood my place butâ¦
Look who pulled the gun out first.
You have been elusively building my casket from day one
Hammering every nail day by day
I am starting to think that things will just be getting worse until the day I get inside
Until the day Iâm lying in my coffin
Iâve been fading away
I wouldnât be surprised if Iâve gone blind from staring at the light
These thoughts are killing me faster than the smoke from your cigarette
I can predict the future
My eyes they see the truth
We are bound together forever
You just never knewâ¦
Forgive me
Who knew that my hand would end this and there would only be silence
I never took you for grantedâ¦
Who knew that my hand would end this and there would only be silence
I never took it for granted; I just mistook it for guidance
Fuck you
My shoulders are broken from the weight of the world I saw in you
I saw the truth for what it was and then I turned away
Engulfed in flames, I am surrounded
Iâve been waiting to seep through
I am the end and youâve always known about me
My eyes see the truth at last.
