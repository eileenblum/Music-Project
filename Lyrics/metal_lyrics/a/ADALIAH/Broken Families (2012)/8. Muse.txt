The empty promises keep us coming back for more, too clueless to realize whatâs in store.
Too fucked up to save yourself from the end.
Where is your so-called family now?
Too fucked up to save yourself from this hell.
Where is your so-called family now?
You'll hold this close but ill hold it closer,
wishing things could be different.
But there is no faith in false wordsâ¦

How much longer can you keep this up?
I can tell youâre running on empty.
The color in your face is fading, and your trembling voice is weak.

Why would you betray what has built you to be who you are?
Why would you hurt the ones you love?
No amount of medicine can fix me, and nothing else can redeem your morality.

A manic state of mind, a violent temper.
A growing addiction to a growing secret.
We didn't leave you. You left us.
Your disease ripped your mind from your body.
Your disease took away from your family.

Too fucked up to save yourself from the end.
Where is your so-called family now?
Too fucked up to save yourself from this hell.
Where is your so-called family now?

You'll hold this close but Iâll hold it closer.
Wishing things could be different
But there is no faith in false words coming from the mouth of a sinner.
No faith in fucking false words.
