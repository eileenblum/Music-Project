Cold hearted kid, he lives his life with no rules, heâs just a man of misfortune.
Cold hearted kid, he thinks heâs so fucking cool.

He walks alone with his lit cigarette, through the alleys filled with scum and regret.

Drink your pain away, send your sorrows off to see and be the loneliest being.
Drink your pain away, there is nothing left to see. Your life is a haunted reflection.

Know that true love doesnât always exist but he never knew it would end up like this.
You picked him up when he was down and out and showed him what the meaning of life was about.

But as he sits and thinks, how did he end up like this?
And now he wonders why his life turned to shit.

The drugs are starting to tear him apart.
His mind is racing, he hears the beat of his heart

Heâll walk alone with his lit cigarette, through the alleys filled with scum and regret.

And all he wants is his family back; to get his fucked up life on the right track.

Drink your pain away, send your sorrows off to see and be the loneliest being.
Drink your pain away, there is nothing left to see. Your life is a haunted reflection.

Know that true love doesnât always exist but he never knew it would end up like this.
You picked him up when he was down and out and showed him what the meaning of life was about.

His mind is racing, he hears the beat of his shallow heart.
