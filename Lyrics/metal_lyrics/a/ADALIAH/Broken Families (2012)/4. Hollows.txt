Iâve had this dream one thousand times, and counting.
What does it feel like, what does it feel like to be awake in your sleep?
I bet it feels so...

Familiar, all the same. I swear to god Iâve seen this face, so frequently in my past.
This cant be coincidence, this cant be coincidental.

Why did you cut your ties from all of us?
We are isolated.
Left with only eyes looking back at me.
What are you staring at? What the fuck are you staring at?

How many times will I go through this nightmare, knowing that Iâm still awake?
Why canât I remember who I am, how did I get so far from everyone?
How did I get so distant? Itâs getting harder to see through the rain.
but I can still see myself.

The only thing you've ever really done for me is pull me down the furthest that Iâve ever been.
You took my hand, you told me it would all be fine.
The darkest blues Iâve ever seenâ¦

I know this cant be real.
I would rather die at the bottom of the sea, than watching things turn out like this.
I would rather die.
