Pick it up, a vessel, to keep you in your thoughts.
An unquestioned action, you do it automatically.

I lie waiting to be released; you never see what keeps me up.
Whatâs making me like this? You canât see my dreams.

Keep running your selfish mouth, your letting this fall apart.
Keep running your selfish mouth. Iâll show you what this is about.
Keep pressing your luck.

You never see the effort I put into things.
You concentrate on my weakness; I'm scared to see what I can do.

Iâll make my way outside of thisâ¦
You never thought you'd see me, you never thought Iâd be here standing right in front of you.
Here to remind you who you are, who you really are inside.
Iâll make my way outside.

Donât fucking hold me back.
