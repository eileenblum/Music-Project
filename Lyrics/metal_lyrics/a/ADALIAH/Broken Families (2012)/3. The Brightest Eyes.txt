Under a crooked palm tree, Iâm lying in the grass wondering what life will be.
I know it will be hard, but Iâve got heart.

Set me stray, set me stray like a dog.
Send me off to this world alone.

I never knew much about family, mom and dad never got along. Brother and Sister died before they knew my name.

Send me off to this world alone, with a fire in my heart.
Give 100 percent, get thrown to the curb.

Iâll learn to see these days, in a shadow, in the dirty streets, in the alleyways.

Look at me, they could have been so much more.
With the brightest eyes, looking back has never been so hard. 

It was all a game, with every move I make follows a consequence.

Hope, the only thing keeping me going.
Hopeâs the only thing I ever had.
