A sharp splash of glass upon my broken grave.
Thereâs only one way back home. 
Death looks into his eyes; he looks back at his face.
Cold windowsill beneath his bare feet; heâs not the man to make these kinds of decisions.

Maybe someone will catch me.
Maybe someone will save me.
Short breathes of air, the only thing left to take.
He closes his eyes and feels the wind on his face.

âThese pillars of hellâ¦â
Destruction of trust, they fall to the ground.
Descending to heaven, a breathe of fresh air. 
The whole way down.

Maybe someone will catch me.
Maybe someone will save me.
Short breathes of air, the only thing left to take.
He closes his eyes and feels the wind on his face.

He goes back to his childhood, to where he felt at home.
He envisions his mothers face, and smiles one last time.
Will he feel this long enough, will he remember her face then.
Will I see her again? Will I see her again? Will I still wake up when I hit the ground? 

No, donât let me forget. Please donât let me forget. What i fought for this long, please donât take it away.

I came so far only to cause more pain.
Iâll leave a scar along with every shattered dream.
Iâm falling so fast, they canât see through my eyes.

Theyâre so blinded by this act, but its much more than that.

Lifeless bodies, they canât go back home.
Fallen bodies, broken families.
