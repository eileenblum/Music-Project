Iâd like to say Iâm from this place, its never felt that way.
To me I've always felt so far from everything.
Youâre slowly hacking away, Iâll tear and scar.
I wont compare, manipulation at its lowest form.
No longer aware of this incarceration.

You find yourself so close to this. No turning back.

And all along, you made it like she was making everything up.
And I believed it all, I put my trust in you.
No longer will I see eye to eye. You made a promise. You made a promise to me.

You told me you would stay, you told me she would leave.
So tell me what should I think, when youâre driving away?

Pick up the devil and take a life away again. Murderous eyes; no one stands in his way.
You've taken enough from our broken home.
Leave me behind. Let this swallow me whole.
Iâll never last, leave me here to die, but Iâm glad you left.
See how far you really are from everything now?

And all along, you made it like she was making everything up.
And I believed it all, I put my trust in you.
No longer will I see eye to eye. You made a promise. You made a promise to me.

You told me you would stay, you told me she would leave.
So tell me what should I think, when youâre driving away?

I never knew it would come to this. All along you failed to tell me what I was doing wrong. I thought you were treasure, but really you were fools gold, in an empty chest.

So pick up the devil and shoot this down.
Youâre a man with too many regrets.
