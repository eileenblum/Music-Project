Looking back on the past, through a charred pane of glass,
wondering where did i go wrong?
wondering where his bright mind turned to shit.
He through his shell into the sea, lost under a sea of blues.

Days go by, heâs still a burden on his family. Years passing by, heâs still long gone.
Now just a memory, that I stay haunted by. His voice still lingers through my head. I never said goodbye.

As he sits dead in his chair
Full of the poison he so cleverly sought.
He tried so hard, to leave us behind.
His mother barely just hanging on.
She's still waiting for him to come back home.

A diamond necklace.
His youthful innocence
still shining bright in her eyes.

But she was never shamed..

Looking back on the past, through a charred pane of glass, wondering where his bright mind turned to shit. She through his shell into the sea, thatâs how she remembersâ¦

Her pride and joy, still shining bright in her eyes.
