Open your eyes. You keep them close to him.
There are people around me everywhere, but I canât help but feeling further than I have ever felt before.
I'm growing anxious, rivers of noise flowing through my insecurities.

Come feast your eyes, this was expected. I sat there still. I didn't say a word.

Yet through the worst of times I stuck by you, gave everything a friend could give. And in return you took it for granted, spit right in my fucking face. And now your gone, I'm glad, I've never been better. I hope these words will make an impact on you. Iâll be fine. Donât worry at all. Not that you ever did.

The lies are starting to cover the windows. Youâre lost in yourself.
Your apology will not be accepted.
What makes you think I can feel any longer, I have turned to stone.
Just bear with me. I can make this better.
I can make this better. I will make this better.

The furthest thing from perfection, you make it so real I want to believe. You are making this more than it actually is, youâre making it more-youâre fucking it up.
A mask for the puppet you'll always be.
A mask for the puppet you will always be.
