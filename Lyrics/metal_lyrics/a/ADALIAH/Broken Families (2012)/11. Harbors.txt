Constructing my world with clouded imagination.
I have created my own ghost.
Fall and hit the floor. Feel the pain and take in some more. Youâll never know what its like to be like me.

All these jaded roads that I will walk alone, all these faded memories of the ones I no longer know.

80 more years, today I still cant find myself. And all I have is emptiness for you.

Tell me the reason for your actions, why must you always tear me down? Constant battles bring a wave of depression, I am a broken man in an endless struggle.

When will this end?
