All the leaves were red like burning fire
Among the air
Among the branches
My thoughts where racing against the walls of my head
Falling down, an autumn shower
To show me how
To remind me what I left behind
This could have been mine
I watched it fall, I watched it crumble,
he stands still, with no reaction
And he stands still
And I can feel your love
Your Strength is all I will ever need
And i can feel your love
A burning passion that shall set me free
Your given life, yet take for granted what it really means
Your given life, become the person you have set to be
A burning ember
It burns a hole right through his frozen bones
Only the memories
To remind me of what I left behind
This could have been mine
