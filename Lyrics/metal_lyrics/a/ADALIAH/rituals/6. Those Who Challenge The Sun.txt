And if the clouds swallow the sky,
the sun will never breathe again.
And if the trees start falling down,
Our foundation will not be saved.
Our waters tainted black with the stains of the human race.
What have we done? We don't appreciate this world.
We seem to have misunderstood this world.
They told me you would never fall, coward you proved me wrong.
They told me you would never fall, now remain under the ground.
This unforgiving wilderness is begging for more space.
The more space we give, the more reality we see.
And if these dark clouds swallow the sky,
the sun will never breathe its light again.

Oh, these passing clouds bring a smile to my face.
We oversee the real beauty that has been left upon this place.
I wont forget.
Don't turn your head the other way.
