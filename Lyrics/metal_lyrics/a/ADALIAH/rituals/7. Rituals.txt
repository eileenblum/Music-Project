I always try to prove myself in their eyes.
Ill take them to the ground with me.
I always try to prove myself in their eyes.
I'm just never enough for them.
I can't believe,
My finger is on the trigger, I can't pull myself to do this.
But I have to...
Mountains crumble, the sun sets.
I've got so much to learn, so many things I regret.
I found my home, I found my family.
We'll make it through this,
This is our destiny...
