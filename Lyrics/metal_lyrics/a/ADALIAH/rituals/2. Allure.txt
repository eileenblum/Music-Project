[feat. Johnny Crowder]I see you running, searching,
Looking for something to make you more...
Hopeless, down on your knees, I can hear you praying.
Empty chested, scarred up faith, take a look around you.
Pathetic.
I have you to blame for this.
Pathetic.
Searching to find meaning for your worthless life.
Broken branches crack under the weight of your weary soul.

I see you running, searching,
Looking for something to make you more...
Hopeless, down on your knees, I can hear you praying
For your god.
Where did he go? I am bleeding.
I am bleeding through, we're breaking boundaries.
Waiting for a day, waiting to be still.
Say bye to all of them,
They try to put an end.
Nobody is better than you,
nobody is better than this place.
Nobody is better than you.
