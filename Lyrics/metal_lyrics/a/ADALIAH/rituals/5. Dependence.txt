Their voices slip into my head
Breathe slow
And when I let it out, you always take a part of me
Evaporating into the air, with a smile on my face.
You never seem to let me down and I,
I can see it coming...
And I free my demons.
The part of me I caged in.
What goes up must come down,
And now I find myself hating every bone in your body.
Because every time I try to keep you out of my head,
You always find a way through my dependence.
You always find a crack to crawl through.
Why won't you get out of my head?
I'm amputated from my release.
