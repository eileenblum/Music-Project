I know what you're looking for
When the night comes to city
You act like you did before
Always so smart and gritty

Sky is darkling, night is crawling
Wishes turn to mania
And you steadily keep falling
To euphoria

Hey (hey) gambler with the fortune
Don't think twice. Make your choice and play
Hey (hey) gambler with the fortune
"All in" is your way

Visions in the neon lights
It's looking so attractive
Crazy megapolis nights
Make you so overactive
