It's new generation
Perfection dictates human rates
Oppressed weaker nation
Accepts the foregone wretched fates

Bit by bit
You row against the tide
Vainly, no matter how hard you have tried
Don't give up
Stick firm to your goal
Sometimes small body contains a great soul

Just look forward
Nowhere to flee
Burn all bridges
It's time to subdue destiny

You're dreaming of bright stars
Alas, you're since childhood unblest
But you've set a high bar
And efforts were crowned with success

Step by step
You strive for ideal
Now it's the strength and the might you reveal
Keep it up
Your dream is so near
Prenotion defeated, your way is clear

Just look forward
You're almost there
Burn all bridges
Take chance if you dare - now you're

Higher, higher, higher than the stars
It's your dream that you've reached
Taking down perfect bars
You are ascending up high
Leaving limits far behind
