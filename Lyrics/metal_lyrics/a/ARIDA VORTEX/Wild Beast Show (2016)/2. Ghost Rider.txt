So here I am, there's no way back
My pure soul turns from white to black
Such rotten price to save the lives
Of my own flesh and blood

C'mon sell your soul
I need your precious soul

The devil's foot is on my neck
He's running right behind my back
The evil's will - I need to kill
Escapee demons out

C'mon sell your soul
I need your priceless soul

Chase the fallen angels to the last gasp
On wheels of fire
Hell power flows in flaming chain

Daredevil dance while bell tolls
Hellfire glance burns dark souls
You shall not hide no matter
How far you run

Ride through the wind of vengeance
My heart pounds fast with engine
Wheels cross the night, by sunrise
You'll be undone

I've done my part, the demons gone
The devil's tricked, my soul withdrawn
I want it cure from black to pure
The ghost rider is back

For your sins beware
I'm riding somewhere there

My hellish bike hunts for the sin
I see it clear beyond your skin
The mercy kill is my goodwill
If your heart's raven-black

For your sins beware
I'm riding somewhere there
