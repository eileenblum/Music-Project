Changing TV channels searching for some breaking news
You just wanna know what's going on there
Drink your beer and scratch your balls
My friend, don't feel confused
I'll wise you up while you sit in your armchair

Some perfect pretty faces
With their perfect smiles
Some war, some sex, some races
Some secret files

Turn on your screen
Just relax and they'll show you
All that you wanted to know
Promotion machine
Shrewdly sees all your needs through
Welcome to the great wild beast

Some celebrity's gone nuts, some briber's caught at last
Thousand people died in local conflict
Don't forget to buy some stuff to cure the dandruff fast
From your desires we both derive some profit
