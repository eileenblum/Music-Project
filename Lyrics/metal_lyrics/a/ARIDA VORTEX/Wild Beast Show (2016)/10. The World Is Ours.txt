I am a perfect liar
I have (I've got) a mask to spend my day
But when the night comes down
I throw that ugly mask away

I know you'll really like it
And I won't stop
To bring you up over the top

Full moon's rising up in the midnight skies
Who are we in these darkest hours
Don't need to pretend, let your feelings rise
Now the world is ours
Throw your doubts away show me what you feel
You should know the rules of this game
Live your life right now 'cos this moment will
Never be the same

You're wearing your mask either
To fool your nature all day long
But I'm a skilful hunter
I read your mind I won't be wrong
