Engine roaring loudly - you are speeding proudly
Managed to escape and cut your firm strings
Just another rascal craving for the rescue
Gives way to the seven deadly sins

You spread death and horror for your heart is hollow
Human sacrifices launch your weird plan
Now your days are numbered - punishment will follow
I will make you repent that you ran
Watch out - there'll be no mercy
For your deeds so unworthy
Here I am the law

I won't let you go

You took things too far, man, I prepare my armor
I will kick your ass just when you show up
You've crossed all the borders - now let's strike a bargain
I will let you live when you're locked up

Watch out - there'll be no mercy
For your deeds so unworthy
Here I am the law

I won't let you go
