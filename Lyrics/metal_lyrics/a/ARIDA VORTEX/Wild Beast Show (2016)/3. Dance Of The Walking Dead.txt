Can you feel the cold
When degrees fall down to zero
Who will save the world
From the spell of modern heroes

World is going crazy
So am I
Who can answer to me - why?

Dance of the walking dead
- It's time to spread the disease
Dance of the walking dead
- It brings you down to your knees
Dance of the walking dead
- It came here fast like a storm
Dance of the walking dead
- That's what you have to perform

Can't you see the blood
On the hands of new messiah
Who can stop this flood
Of pathetic wicked liar?
