Not so distant future
Humans and computers
World is addicted to chaos
Shall we stay and die (or)
Shall we leave and fly
To the dark corners of space

(It's) not a family picnic and it's
Not a summer day on the beach
Ship is ready tore flight and
Monkey's ready to flip the switch

So far away from our homeland
We came here to face
The hostiles of mankind
Searching some places for shelter
To save human race
(We're) strangers in space!

Earth united forces
Wasted last resources
To send the lifesaving team
There's no second chance
To start once again
Journey of hope should begin

"Alfa-prime" now seems so far
And we wonder where we are
We have to break through the sun
Hey! There is no way to run!
