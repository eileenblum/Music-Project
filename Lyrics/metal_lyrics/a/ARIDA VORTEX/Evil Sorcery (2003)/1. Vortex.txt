You will never come in to my world
Full of blind fury, full of passion
I'm the one who makes your blood run cold
And I follow my own destination

And velocity is my best friend
And swiftness is my second nature
I'm the one who will conquer your land
I will demonstrate my domination

You can scream but you can't be heard
You can run but you cannot escape
I'll be soon you can pray to your Lord
I will bathe you in your hate

Vortex is my name
I'm walking through the land
Vortex is my name
I'll always be the same

I will send you my message by winds
I will send you my message of danger
I will cover you with my black wings
And I'll subject you to erasure

I will send you my message by rains
I will send you my message of sorrow
Can't you feel the blind fear in your veins
I will paralyze you with your horror
